{"text":"Tried the seafood pasta (forget name) and it was terrible and for $22 the price is ridiculous. The staff seem friendly and the decor is very nice but blegh."}
{"text":"A friend and I discovered this spot after trying unsuccessfully to secure reservations at several Distillery District restaurants. We were looking for a nice meal before attending a play at Soulpepper. The entrance to the restaurant is actually inside the entrance to a commercial building. Our wait staff was friendly and efficient. We shared a large roasted beet salad which easily could feed three and a zucchini pizza. Both were tasty although the beets were a tad on the mushy side and the pizza crust was somewhat soggy, not crisp. We also split a 1/2 bottle of wine. The washrooms are outside the restaurant itself and are available to anyone in the building in general. All in all a reasonably priced, good meal within an easy walking distance (10 minutes) of the theatre."}
{"text":"Everything is made fresh. Pasta and Panini are good, but at M&B it is ALL about the pizza. I would say that it is truly incredible. Terroni and Il Fornello pizza cannot compare to M&B. My two favorite pizza's are Burina and the Patta & Pancetta. Pizza this good is an art and takes a bit more time. It is absolutely worth the wait. Lunch is very busy, so call ahead for a reservation and especially if you are going between 12- 1 PM. They are also open evenings and weekends. Much quieter and great for a romantic dinner.

{"text":"This is a great Italian: cozy and casual with delicious thin crust pizzas.  

I have been here twice and the pizza & service were good on both times. Their tomato sauce was incredibly tasty! I had the one with salami and sun-dried tomatoes, yum! Had a good spiciness balance. My friend had the one with tuna and arugula. It was a lot lighter in taste but not bad. The one called parmigiano had a good amount of parmigiano on it. My friend had the tiramisu and it seemed like a proper one. 

It might a bit difficult to find the place as it kind of isn't on King St. You need to turn to a smaller alley from King."}
{"text":"This place is good for a casual lunch or dinner for either a small or large group. If you're a couple or group of 4-6, you probably don't need a reservation. For larger groups, there's a high top table that fits about 8-10 people and a room that fits over 20 people. This place is a bit hidden - located on Ontario Street just north of King St. East.

Food: 4/5
- Favourites are the Bufalina salad ($19 - which could be shared with 2 or 3 people to start) and the Carbonara ($18)
- also tried the Commendatore ($19 - sausage, spinach, leeks, pistachios, cream) and Affumicata ($19 - spicy sausage, tomato sauce) pastas which were also good but preferred the Carbonara
- Tiramasu was also good ($8)
- The portions are pretty large and I usually can't finish a pasta plate 
- Can't comment on the pizzas which I haven't tried

Service: 5/5
- friendly and attentive
- food comes out fairly quickly

Location & Ambiance: 3/5
- not located close to any other restaurants or bars
- inside is a bit brightly lit, not well-decorated
- it's on the lower level of an office building and the washroom is in a hall outside of the restaurant in the main building
- there's usually just enough people - not overly busy or crowded and you will most likely not have to wait for a table

It's not a trendy or dressy restaurant, but more of the go-to spot on your way home from work (if you live closer to the east-end) when you don't feel like cooking and want some good italian comfort food. I would recommend if you're close to the area or you're looking for a restaurant for a large group."}
{"text":"What a gem! Tucked away between two office buildings off King is Mangia & Bevi. Make sure you try their weekly specials too - the best pizza I have ever had in the city was here (a white pizza with figs, walnuts, Gorgonzola, and honey).

How can a place that makes their sausage in house be wrong?"}
{"text":"Did take out for their %10 off deal. I can't say it's the best pizza in town... I got the margherita, and there was a tiny little basil leaf in the middle of this whole entire pizza. Scaddabush had better margherita. I also had high hopes for the beet salad but it fell really flat. Can barely taste the pistachio (candied walnuts would have been better) and sugar beets would have made this dish a lot tastier. The fungacrema I think was the best dish. But seriously, three dishes with tiny proportions for almost $60? I dunno, if I was taken there for a date then yes, I would have enjoyed it for the nice atmosphere and the free food. But I don't think I'll be coming back here again. There's just so much better off pizzas everywhere else."}
{"text":"I'm lucky to work in the same building as this place! Some of the best pizza I've ever had. Authentic Italiano for sure! I went for their \"white pizzas\" the first few visits (no sauce) because I usually find the sauce to be my least favourite part of any pizza. But after having a bite of my friends margarita, I can say that this some good sauce! And not too much, to boot! There is also a great selection of sandwiches, and pastas. And the beef carpaccio was a nice app treat my first visit. 

Be sure to try their \"Bomba Italiano\" hot sauce. It's one of the tastiest hot sauces I've ever had. And you can buy it to take home complete - with a cute little packaging idea."}
{"text":"This is the second time that I've been to this restaurant and it just keeps getting better. We decided to go for a Sunday dinner, sit outside and have some nice wine and share a pizza. Since it's on a side street, it's nice and quiet. We had heard that the pizza was as good as Terroni and it was. The prices are comparable to Terroni too. If there is one thing that I have learned about this city, it's that you have to pay for great food, service and atmosphere. This is a hidden gem that is worth a try but don't tell too many people, it's still a secret spot."}
{"text":"A hidden gem on the east end. Finally found a good resto close to home with good Italian food and a nice patio in summer. Menu is decently priced And staff is friendly plus book with open table and earn points."}
{"text":"Great chewiness for a neapolitan styled  pizza.

The tiramisu is a little small but it compensated with flavour."}
{"text":"Firstly lemme begin by saying that the address is 260 King Street East but the entrance is on ONTARIO STREET! We were a little confused by this. So I just wanted everyone to know :)

Secondly....the service was extremely friendly which was awesome.

Thirdly and most importantly the food....was good. Really good crust on that pizza man. Thin and crispy and delicious. The toppings of the pizzas we ordered were a little on the boring side. The pasta I had was slightly under cooked which took away from the beautiful flavours.

The wine recommended to us was amazing. There is an adorable puppy outside just waiting to be loved. But I probably wont come back. If I am going downtown for pizza, I am just looking for more flare and creativity.

But, as mentioned by other reviewers, its a solid italian resto :)"}
{"text":"Tried the restaurant on a whim after not been able to make reservations to some trendy Italian spot in TO. Very pleasant surprise, will definitely return. Excellent food, good service, excellent food again, some of the best pizza in Toronto. Ordered the Carpaccio and Polipo, both where perfect, and pizza Parmigiana was amazing. The Parmesan Cheese Cake was a nice surprise, and the espresso machiato right on. Great ingredients, perfect execution."}
{"text":"Unpretentious place. The pizza is really good although  it's not the best I've had. Service was quick but it was a Thursday night and it wasn't that busy. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"excellent food, knowledgeable waitstaff, and fun atmosphere.
...not the easiest place to find."}
{"text":"Outstanding authentic Italian food.  The atmosphere and service was great!  Another place I would frequent often if this place was in my home town."}
{"text":"I live a few blocks from here and still had a hard time finding it.....260 King E, but......that's an office building? We drive by a few times and finally decide to try the main entrance, sure enough there it is but wait, you can't enter from here after 6 pm,  a sign says enter from Ontario St., which is one way.....Mama Mia!

Finally! What a cosy, inviting little trattoria, feels like you are walking off an italian back street into someone's home, but without doubt the first thing you notice is the aroma of inviting Italian comfort food.

This place is tres casual guys, come in your jeans and with a bunch of friends or with a loved one, and have a glass of wine (or three), relax, stay a while.

The service is personable and friendly, though not every one is in a rush, the menu is somewhat limited, pizza, pasta, sandwiches and salads, but that's what it is, and the price for two without wine if you have salad and pizza is about $50 without tip

I will go back again (soon) when I feel like a good warm plate of pasta and a relaxing glass of wine and feel like I'm amongst friends or at home.

Vinnie"}
{"text":"There with a group of 20. They kept on top of things. Fabulous Pizza! The pasta is to die for. Best suggestion is to go with someone, order one pizza and one pasta dish and share everything! You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"An instant favorite; this has got to be one of the best Italian restaurants in the city.  I'm pretty critical when it comes to pasta and the fresh pasta and pizza here was simply delicious.  Service was friendly and prices were also very fair.  

I noticed that they had an area that could be used to host a party of 20 people or so - would not hesitate to hold a group dinner here."}
{"text":"It really depends on the day. My favourite thing to order is the ragu. One day, it'll be rich, delicious and one of the best sauces in Toronto... on another it's so bland and tasteless that my $25 is better spent torn up and eaten instead. The decor and staff are nice though. They just need to sort out their ragu sauce so it's not a coin flip of whether I'll get tastiness or watered down tomato juice."}
{"text":"Best thin crust!

I didnt have any pasta but the pizza was great - thin as can be but still with a crunch and not in the least limp or soggy. Perfect. Also good service."}
{"text":"Abit tricky to find the front door, but as most of the reviews tell you, this is wonderful casual Italian experience with a pizza unlike anywhere else- all pizzas will now  be  compared to the pizza we had here.  We could not decide on a wine initially and the waiter even gave each of us samples (there was 6 of us !)    Friendly staff, relaxed and divine food!  would go back and well worth the trip to find it!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place as there were so many good reviews here, but it was far from what I expected it to be. I came here for dinner with a couple friends on a week night. Our server was very attentive and kindly explained to us the menu specials which lead me high hopes for this place. While we were waiting for our drinks, one of my friends spotted a couple of tiny crawling faux friends (aka bugs) on the corner of the floor. Now I can tolerate one as it may have just crawled into the restaurant, but seeing a number of them in one area? That to me is definitely not a one off. 

As for the food, the pasta portions seem to be just right for my friend and the pizza size was extremely generous, so there was food left for take out. We were offered a piece of chocolate each with the bill which we thought was a nice touch, however don't think we would be back here again."}
{"text":"Very unique and good italian pizza. I can say it is better than pizza libretto.

The soup and panini was not that good, why doesn't the chef care?

I can recommend this place for pizza to others!"}
{"text":"\"Everybody loves Raymond\" -- false
\"Everybody loves pizza\" -- true

So it would seem from the record attendance of the UYE: Epic Thin Crust Pizza Stuffing @ M&B Resto Bar. I've never seen so many Yelpers at one table (13!) and a small part of me thought, \"Oh, no. It's going to be The Service from Hell Like the UYE @ Kenzo Ramen*, Part II.\" 

But props to our waitress; she was tiny (and looked all of 14 years old) but she was working as if the rent was due tomorrow. She was patient with our ever-expanding group and brought us some comp bread with olive oil & balsamic vinegar while we waited for the kitchen to fire 13 pizzas all at once. A good thing because nobody ordered antipasti, and we were getting pretty loud and obnoxious, seeing as how we drank two glasses of wine on an empty stomach and we normally don't handle alcohol well without food to absorb it.**

My order was the Giudaica (Jewish in Italian?, $13) pizza which was topped with grilled artichokes, shavings of Pecorino cheese, and torn bits of fresh mint. Each of our pies had a crackly thin crust and was the size of a steering wheel. Delicious. My only quibble is that the crust was a little too crisp and cracker-like and not more supple and chewy the way I like it.

Overall, M&B has a casual and convivial vibe that's great for large gatherings at prices that are student-friendly.  I'd definitely go back again with a group of friends but next time, I'd maybe order some antipasti so I don't end up inhaling an entire loaf of bread before then going on to eat an entire pizza.*** 

Note: M&B has two entrances. If you're not driving, use the entrance on Ontario Street.

**OK, it wasn't \"we\" but just \"I.\"
***Ugh. I felt like a snake that swallowed a goat."}
{"text":"Meh - the pizza is okay!  After all of the positive reviews, my expectations were too high I guess. I ordered the \"Buffalina,\" which is like a margarita except they use buffalo mozzarella.  For me, the sauce was subpar. It was super bland.  I've had some exceptional margarita pizzas and this wasn't it. 

The servers were nice, but service wasn't as attentive as it should have been. We waited a while after being seated to have someone come and take our drink orders. And waited even longer to get our water and beverages.  The food, however, came out quick.  They were not busy at all for a Saturday night.  And after we were done our dinners and they took away our plates, we waited a while to have someone ask us about dessert.  We saw several servers/staff just \"chilling\" at the bar area while we waited and waited and waited. In fact, we had to catch the server as she was leaving another table and ask her for the tiramisu. 

The tiramisu was actually very nice - it was light and fluffy.  

Don't get me wrong - our servers were very nice, just not very attentive. 

Subpar pizza and okay service - I'd give it a miss."}
{"text":"I can see this restaurant becoming our go to Italian! 
Ordered the Burina Pizza to share, which was fantastic. Best Pizza we have had so far in Toronto.
next ordered pasta which was freshly made, one Ragu and one Cream sauce, both of which were fantastic, particularly the creamy one which was not heavy at all.
Coffees to finish were also good.
Only thing lacking was the service - there was only one waitress looking after a lot of tables, will not stop us going back just hope they have more servers next time."}
{"text":"What a great hidden little find. 

My partner and I were looking for a place near the Distillery District to eat because it was absolutely way too hectic to eat there this past weekend. 

It was a perfect short walk away! 

At first we were seated at this big long empty communal table because there were no other tables available, but the waitress must have sensed our discomfort and offered to move us to the main dining room once a table had cleared. That was great of her. 

We ordered: 
1) Piccante pizza: tomato sauce, mozzarella, spicy sausage, chili flakes and red onions. 
This was so delicious. The centre bits were a little soggy but the rest of the crust was very tasty! It still makes my list of top 3 pizzas in the city. 

2) Amatriciana pasta: pancetta, red onions, parsley, pecorino shavings, tomato sauce, chili peppers, white wine. 
The first time the waitress brought this to us, it was very obviously undercooked. It was much more raw than \"al dente\". I tried taking a few bites but just couldn't eat it. Since the waitress came by to ask how it was, I told her and she immediately offered to take it back and bring out a better one in a few minutes. The 2nd one was much better!! Perfectly al dente I would say. The pancetta and pecorino went really well together. 

Overall, really great service. The waitress seemed to be one of only perhaps 2 other people serving the dining room, so we didn't mind at all waiting a bit in between things. The food came relatively fast, and it was only the bill that took awhile to get. But still! Really great Italian food, and I'd love to come back here again soon."}
{"text":"I'm now a regular here, and yes the pizza is the best I've had so far in TO. This place is sometimes packed depending on when you go, it's tucked away and definitely a neighbourhood gem. I keep going back so that says a lot. A must try!"}
{"text":"4.5/5! Definitely one of Toronto's best kept secrets when it comes to thin crust pizza! Recommend the antipasti minto to start and the famous Bufalina pizza (large enough to share depending on appetite)!"}
{"text":"Not sure how to describe this place. It's a pizza place that's attached to an office that I never knew about despite having lived in the neighborhood for years."}
{"text":"Mangia and Bevi is my all time favorite neighborhood restaurant and I go here all the time.  This time though, I had with me a service dog I am raising and training for the Canadian Guide Dogs for the Blind. I called ahead to advise them and they accommodated us with our favorite table.  They were extremely welcoming and kind with the dog.  On top of that the food and drink were superb as always. Service is always great!  It's a wonderful, relaxed and warm place to eat.  Stout and I will see you soon!   Thank you!"}
{"text":"Had lunch there today. I realized that I had been there before for a Christmas dinner and this meal was just as good.

The location is smallish but quite nice (exposed brick, blah blah blah) and the food was exquisite. I had a special which was buffala mozzarella, wild boar sausage, and green onions. Popped some of the hot sauce on it and basically inhaled it. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"It was very hard to find this place and at first it looked like it was in an apartment building, but we tried it anyway and I'm so glad we did.  This was one of THE BEST Italian restaurants I've ever been to and I'm an Italian from New York!  Delicious homemade pastas and yummy, inventive pizzas.  This is a must try for tourists and natives alike."}
{"text":"love this place. my go to spot when i'm in toronto.

the pizza is the italian way, not north american. the salads ... wow again."}
{"text":"I LOVE PIZZA!

Especially this pizza, though I can't give M & B 5 stars for the following reasons:

1 - Restroom are part of the office building, not the restaurant, and I didn't have the code to get in.
2 - Terrible beer selection.  I opted for the steam whistle, but I don't like steam whistle.
3 - Service was pretty hot and heavy when I first got there, but fizzled towards to end of the meal.

I'll be back, nonetheless."}
{"text":"Everyone here was great. We did not have reservations, so the owner had his sister give us her seat at the bar. We sat next to his wife and son, they were great!

We had the fire roasted tomatoes with fresh mozzarella and arugula for an appetizer. It was amazing and filling. Super fresh dish and the flavors meshed well!

For dinner we had the canadese pizza this is a traditional Italian pizza with great crust. It was also delicious!!! Everything tasted very fresh. My wife and I couldn't finish the pizza. We were stuffed!! 

The owner asked how everything was and we chatted for a bit. During the chat, he found out my wife and I were on our honeymoon. He gave is a free tiramisu and two dessert shots with espresso, Bailey's, and pure magic!!!! It was quite the gesture. He congratulated is on our marriage and we both had huge smiles.

The food is great and the staff is great. Everyone was happy to be there. If we are back in Toronto, we're coming back for sure! Definitely eat here you will not regret it."}
{"text":"Have to start off with the menu being really hard to read, which lead my to getting the most simple stuff to read. I got the ragu and there were so many selections of pizza we just picked a random one. It would be nice if the font was bigger and with simplified terms under the fancy Italian name. They only have certain types of pasta available on the night, it was very fresh. They only do one type of crust in the pizza which was pretty thin and crunchy."}
{"text":"PREFACE: Of all of my time on Yelp reviewing businesses, I have handed out less than a handful of one-star's and what these establishments have had in common is either questionable business ethics or extremely flawed business practices. I am filled with disappointment to now add Mangia & Bevi to this list as it is my neighbourhood Italian resto and it was one of the earlier date spots that my partner brought me to. Unfortunately, we will no longer be returning because I will not support a business that has a visibly negative energy, whose employees and owner scapegoat each other in front of the customer, whose owner cannot assume responsibility for her own establishment, and I will not tolerate business owners who treat their patrons and employees with disrespect. 


Abridged play-by-play:
- Starts off with a cold reception every time we have come here
- Typical Torontonian \"pfft you don't have a reservation\" attitude
- No one took our food orders but Good Guy Busboy noticed and got the owner to personally come take our orders
- Our salad was the wrong order
- Over 1h00min passes after our mistaken salad, still no sign of server nor our food
- Good Guy Busboy noticed and checks on the order
- At 1h15min, we get the wrong entrees.
- Grumpy server finally mumbles a word of apology: states that the owner made a mistake but does not want to tell her because she is the owner - I extended my empathy and understanding as it is quite clear that apologies are hard to come by from this server
- 1h20min, entrees finally come: special tagliatelle and commentadore - both very underwhelming, dry and bland - hmm probably because they rushed to make it 
- Server assured us that she adjusted the bill

THE KICKER:

- TWO HOURS after being seated we go up to pay and the adjustment she talked about was less than 10% of our total bill Server offers for us to speak to the owner, we agree
- Owner came out apparently withdrawn and defensive. I started with a compliment of how the evening started out great, but things kind of went downhill after the salad...
- Her response, direct quote, was \"Well what do you expect? What is your expectation? The salad was wrong and the food was mixed up, but you got the right one in the end. You got what you ordered\" 
- Us: \"We were thinking an apology would be a good place to start? We aren't here for a free meal\"
- Owner: \"Yes I believe my server apologized to you already. She admitted to me that she screwed up\" 

...???? My mind was BLOWN: did she actually just say \"my server apologized to you!?\" rather than offer a personal apology? If I were not upset about my experience up to that point, the way this business owner handled the situation was unbelievable. The only consistently great thing from the night was the Good Guy Busboy, I can only hope that he received our tip.

Listen Yelpers, we all look for so much more than flavours and food quality when we go out to dine. Yelp is about so much more than food, but supporting local businesses who exude positive energy, provide excellent service, and demonstrate respectable morals and business practices. We are blessed with many wonderful Italian restos who do it right and treat you well. I would strongly urge you to go give those a try instead."}
{"text":"The meal was great... We each had pizza and they are served hot and deelish. Servive was quick and attentive. 
Or server Jenn walked us through each of the choices and was helpful with the wine choice as well. Jenn was very knowledgeable with an upbeat personality. 
Highly recommended for a casual dinner."}
{"text":"Maybe our hopes were too high from all the positive reviews written on Yelp.  Walked a great distance for a \"meh\" meal. The pizza was very good but not \"walk across town\" good. Cap rede salad was below average. However, the dipping sauces mentioned in other reviews were fabulous."}
{"text":"4.5 stars!

Excellent food.  Top to bottom, the menu rocks.  The pizza is of course top notch as many have said, but the pastas and salads are great too.  I recently dined there with some vegetarian friends from out of town, and they were thrilled with the number and quality  of choices they had

The prices are very reasonable, and the service is efficient.  I read a couple of reviews that rated the service so-so, but I think we all have different preferences in this regard.  I'm not a big fan of the super-bubbly \"Hi I'm so-and-so, and I'm gonna be your server today, isn't that awesome?!\" style of service.  I have always found the staff to be knowledgable, friendly, and efficient.

I go regularly, and they are usually able to accomodate for a table at the last minute, as they have a mix of daytime and nighttime clientelle, and seem to be steady and never super-busy.  

If you have questions about the food, or even just show an interest , someone from the kitchen will usually come out and chat.

This is not the place \"to see and be seen.\"   It is a very unpretentious place to have an excellent meal with excellent service."}
{"text":"I'm from out of town and found this restaurant on Yelp. It is located in a larger business building, they gave good directions on their web site (\"use the red door on the Ontario Street entrance\") but when trying to find it after parking was difficult. After we were seated, a friendly guy filled our water and after his third time walking by our table I asked if we could order some wine. He said that he needed to get our server. I thought he WAS our server! Our server was ok, she seemed not too interested in helping us work through the menu or explaining some of the their specialty items.  Anyway, I ordered the lasagna and I was not very pleased; there was not much in the dish, mostly tasted the pasta (is this how it is served in Italy?). BTW, the wine was delicious. 

I'm glad that others have a good experience here; I liked the ambience. I could go on but I don't want to bash on the restaurant.  It may have been an off night for them but I'll probably find another place next time I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"The special of bass fillets and vegetables was excellent, and the service was perfect. Great value neighborhood restaurant."}
{"text":"Best Pizza in Town!

I've recommended this pizza joint to many people and all have loved it. The only person who didn't like it preferred frozen pizza tasting Belissimo pizza (see previous review). 

I've only had the pizza and mushroom salad, but both were outstanding. It's a bit pricey at 20 bucks a pizza, but comparable to other high-end pizza. 
I think it's far superior to Pizza Libretto and QMP. The crust is light and crunchy and is a real treat with their chili oil selection. 

The only negative thing about the restaurant is that the washroom is shared with the entire building as it's actually in the lobby of the building. 

I've been back many times. So good."}
{"text":"we have always enjoyed dinners here - pizzas have thin crust+ are crisp; salads interesting and flavorful; service + ambiance friendly and casual. Every neighborhood needs a  \"Mangia and Bevi\"!"}
{"text":"I had the Carbonara.

The front patio is quite nice and the service is friendly, though I feel like this particular restaurant was understaffed and would benefit greatly from having at least two servers on the patio.
The carbonara was quite generic and in no way awful, but it is clearly undeserving of the current price.
I shall have to see if their pizza will be a saving grace."}
{"text":"Tried this place before going to theatre with friends.  Called the day of to make reservations and they were accommodating as they were busy.  The place is a little tricky to find as the address is on King St but the entrance is off Ontario.  This is clearly explained on their website but if you haven't read that you might miss this place.

I hope not, because this place rocks.  First the ambience is lovely, warm and comfortable vibe.  The servers attentive and friendly.  The food - awesome.  The  lasagna was one of the best I've ever had and my friends dinners were also delicious.  Fusili with a tomato sauce and rigatoni with a creamy mushroom sauce were all given thumbs up.

I asked for one tiramisu to be served with 5 spoons and they were thoughtful enough to split it five ways on five bills.  Great idea.  Loved this place.

I can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"We were a party of 45. Service was exceptional. Antipasto platter was huge. Had a few different pizzas and all were great. Rigatoni with bolognese sauce was awesome!!! This is one of the best hidden gems in the TO food scene!"}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had in a long time.  Maybe ever.

M&B is a bit tricky to find the first time (enter from Ontario Street) but well worth the effort.  They serve up a high-quality casual Italian experience with old classics as well as some creative flair -original, but not out in left field.

My companion and I shared the Caprese salad to start.  In enjoyed the light, bright dressing and loved the touch of coarse salt that gave an occasional crunch-and-punch without getting in the way the rest of the time.  Some pepper for the tomatoes would have been dandy, although I'm sure some purists would argue that next to the mozzarella, they're better without.  I'm a firm believer that tomatoes should be seasoned once cut, and I'll be sure to ask for the mill next time.

The pizzas are must-try's; although flesh was sparse on the menu I found myself spoiled for choice once I resigned myself to the reality that a real pizza isn't supposed to look like a killing field.  As it happened, I had the Tirolesse (speck, brie and arugula) and was happy to see enough dry-cured ham to put the greens in their place when my dish arrived.  My date had the Margherita, but swapped smoked provolone for mozzarella - a nice choice.

The pizzas were served uncut but without pretense (unlike a certain Terronto joint known for its unyielding adherence to traditional presentations), with a trio of hot sauces that made great dips for the crust.  The crust was delicious on its own, and I found myself dipping sparingly.  As for the toppings, my trio made a great combination although (carnivore that I am) I found myself pulling the speck off and moving it down on its own on more than one occasion.  Not to worry - Brie and Arugula enjoyed time together all the same (they make such a cute couple).

I also found a new wine to enjoy - the Toscana Chianti was absolutely fantastic and I'll be sure to make it a part of my home stash just as soon as I can hit the LCBO.  

Just two gripes, and minor ones at that.  While we were competently accommodated, I felt a few times like we were getting a big-box-style upsell.  And some sharper knives would be nice if you're not going to cut my pizza for me.  Neither issue was nearly enough of a bother to cut into an otherwise spot-on meal.

I now find myself looking for a reason to head east again - I'll be back to try the pasta post haste."}
{"text":"Very unassuming, but very good. We had a large group of 14 members of a swim team, they all had various pizzas and antipasto platters along with salads, everything was delicious. Cheers"}
{"text":"So after reading a sea of great reviews, I was pretty much expecting the sun and moon from this resto bar...Sadly, that was not the case. We went there last nite to celebrate my sister's 25th and I couldn't have been more disappointed with the service we received. Our hostess was curt and rather surly, to the point it seemed like she didn't want to be there. Here's I usually review restaurants:

Ambiance - The layout (quite open spaced) is friendly and the decor inviting.

Food: Great food but very limited in terms of options.

Price: Very affordable...most pizzas and pastas will set you back only by $14-$17. 

Service: As mentioned before, the service was deplorable. We mentioned to our server that since our Mum was ill, she couldn't drink water with ice. She returned back with a glass of water filled with ice for her. She was curt, surly and very unprofessional. 

The restaurant itself seemed nice but the service left us with a sour taste. 

That being said, we didn't skimp out on the tip and would suggest other people not do it too since all the tips are usually gathered at the end of the night and distributed amongst everyone including the line cooks, dishwashers, bussers and host/esses and most of the time, its just one person who messes up but everyone else has to pay for their mistake."}
{"text":"Great potato pizza. I had mine without pancetta so the flavours were mild. Pizza was perfectly done.
The staff are extremely fast. Almost like a fast food joint. I tried my boyfriends pasta pomodoro. A bit too oily and not enough salt even with the Parmesan added. (Almost a citric or acidy taste). Definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"An awesome find! The best Italian food in the city! Delicious lasagna, pizza, and pastas. Perfect for toddlers! Great service! Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Went for a Birthday. I was craving pizza and was disappointed by the lack of non-dairy choices. I understand that most pizzas have cheese, but even when I asked for no cheese, they told me my only option was sauce and basil.  I rate it four stars because it was delicious.  I just won't go back very often due to lack of choice."}
{"text":"Great service and food. Pasta and pizza were delicious. My favourite was the Bolognese! Lasagna is also very good there."}
{"text":"I decided to try out this place based on the good reviews. I wasn't disappointed,food was good. I had a pizza which was good not the best compared to the other great pizzerias in the city but still very satisfying. Ask for the fresh mozzarella on your pizza it'll be a small charge but worth it. Pasta, they make fresh daily. Restaurant address says king st but you'll actually find it on Ontario st. It's in a good location close by other good bars to have a drink afterwards. I give it only 3 stars because there's too many great pizza spots in this city and I would probably go to those first over here. But if you're in the area definitely try this place out."}
{"text":"Hidden gem located in the downtown eastern core. Great service and good traditional pizza. If you're in the area, definitely check it out."}
{"text":"First of all, I know nothing about Italian food. My opinion on the taste of Carpaccio was just okay...maybe its because I was not familiar with Italian spices. I thought it may taste like Japanese beef tataki but i was wrong....
Our pizza canadeses was spicy + all three side toppings were even more spicy...I didn't expect that...
Finally I tried this panna cotta for the dessert that I've never heard of and i really loved it. 
As for the price, I think it's a tinny bit over priced...I was expecting a little more topping on their pizzas.
I had no complains about the service, although she didn't say goodbye to us when we left, she patiently explained the menu and offered her recommendations."}
{"text":"The staff are fantastic and the food is even better!!! It NEVER disappoints! Everything (pasta and pizza) are homemade and you can't go wrong with anything on the menu!"}
{"text":"Ambience - really cozy and casual, a great place to have a nice dinner & be able to talk

Service - good!

Food - I'll start with the bad. They serve some pretty terrible bread as the starter. I mean, I get it's free, but you're an Italian restaurant, have some GOOD bread! It was stale, hard, and lacked flavour. Worse than day-old bread from grocery store!

I ordered the BUFALINA salad (roasted cherry tomatoes / balsamic reduction / bufala mozzarella arugola / basil / x-v oil $22) which was PARTLY disappointing. The bufala mozzarella was creamy, rich  & delicious, BUT it was served atop way too much arugula, which sat on top of MORE of that stale sliced bread! 

The entrees though, were SPECTACULAR. We were a group of 7 that ordered 4 pasta dishes, 2 pizzas, and 1 salmon entree that was on the daily special. We only disliked the one salmon dish which was bland, dry, and overcooked. But really, if you're going to an Italian restaurant, you really should be ordering pizza or pasta! Shame on them lol. 

All of the pasta dishes were delightful - perfectly executed and FULL of flavour. We ordered the FUNGOCREMA, COMMENDATORE and PUTTENESCA. All great, but the first 2 were stand out dishes. The 4th pasta dish was a lasagna from the daily special which was top notch too!

Their pizza is also done really well. The crust is airy, but chewy, and perfectly crisp.

All in all, I'd highly recommend Mangia & Bevi and will definitely be returning soon!"}
{"text":"Probably my favourite pizza in town, slightly edging out Queen Margherita. Simple, fresh thin crust. Far superior to Terroni for the same cost."}
{"text":"Mamma Mia! Just like the way mama makes it back home. 

Authentic home made tasting pizza with a friendly neighbourhood vibe. 

You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Pretty good food but very overpriced.
This is also a silly complaint, but delivery comes in Styrofoam containers and it melts and flavours the outside of the food like rancid plastic. (Also for 22 bucks, throw in a napkin or something).
Pasta is fresh and salads are great."}
{"text":"After reading the positive reviews, we headed out to try this restaurant. Our waitress suggested we get pizza as \"it is what they do best\" instead of the pasta. The pizza was average. It had a thin crust which quickly became soggy. Wish I had tried the pasta."}
{"text":"We went for brunch today.  Fantastic!!  Service was great and the portions were HUGE.  
Would highly recommend for brunch."}
{"text":"The restaurant was not so easy to find from the street address - there are actually no signs visible from the road! You have to go inside an office building and then you'll find the restaurant. Having said that, our search was well worth it - the service was excellent and the food was excellent. I had the 1/2 panini and 1/2 salad lunch combo, and my brother had a 1/2 pasta and 1/2 salad lunch combo, and both were fresh and tasty and attractive, and the restaurant had a very pleasant decor. I would go back for sure."}
{"text":"- legit italian joint hidden off of king near parliament. 
- definately try the bresaola (air dried beef loin served similar to carpaccio)
- good neapolitan pizza and even better pasta. try the limone!
- thank you yelp for helping me find another gem. i'll be back.
- also, take advantage of the 15% off for checking in through yelp!!! we did!!"}
{"text":"Best for pizza. If you wanna try out authentic pizza,  this is the place.  The three stars is mainly for the pasta.... I've had better."}
{"text":"As usual, pizza is great! Patio could use a bit more pizzaz, some flowers or something...."}
{"text":"This place is a great find as its hard to spot from the main street. I had it bookmarked for a while as the review on the foodie forum kept raving about it. The setup is your neighbourhood simple pizza/pasta joint in the main dinning area. They do have some private dinning rooms which will provide a more intimate setting (the main area had quite a few people with kids).
The pizza was said to be a must try so we ordered two (Puccini, Napolitina) and one of us ordered a pasta (Chili, garlic, pepper and parsley). 
The wine list is decent and I would recommend to ordering it by the glass as there quite a few  worth trying. 
The place was busy even for a week day. Service was decent and we were checked on regularly. We were given bread with some dipping oil (forgetful). 
The main on the other hand were worth writing home about. Pizza is very good with a nice thin crust, light tomato sauce, good cheese and other fresh ingredients on both the pizzas we tried.  The did provide some condiments and boy those chili flakes pack a punch and will give you a kick if you like your food hot. 
The pasta which I tried a bit was a surprise. I generally avoid having pasta outside but this one is worth trying out. Light yet highlighting the core ingredients. 
This place is worth a detour if you like Italian food.
4 Stars.
Update second trip elevated this place's position on the good pizza in the city/
This time we wisely selected less saltier pizzas and they were just right.
Dessert hmm Panna Cotta was decent Tiramisu was below average (not recommended)"}
{"text":"Highly recommended, loved the food. Enjoyed a shrimp pasta dish in a rose sauce. Incredible."}
{"text":"Spent a great, hot day walking around Toronto, and ended up at the Distillery District.  As I'm not a tourist, I know that despite the charm of the bricks, the allure of the patios, and the line-ups out the door suggesting otherwise -- most of the food in the Distillery sucks.  They charge you a premium because it's a tourist destination, but the service and the quality is usually lacking.

Instead, my friend and I started walking along King, not sure where we were headed.  When we passed Mangia and Bevi, totally inconspicuous and only a stone's throw away from Distillery, I mentioned I had read it was good.  You could tell they had a patio, even though no one was sitting on it.

Upon further inspection, they were indeed open.  I went inside and the server came out and brought some chairs for us.  I though the service was lovely - we were outside, but we never had to flag her down, we were never left without water.  Our food came out as we asked (appetizer with the pizzas) and the bill came out promptly after being requested.   

The food was awesome.  Pizza crust was delish.  I liked the pizza we had with the grilled artichokes, mint, pecorino....soooo good.  The white pizza we had, with mushrooms, was good but made better when we added the meat from the carpaccio appetizer to it.   Definitely a cute little spot; washrooms are kind of weird and in an office building with a number code to get in so ask before you go hunting for them.

Kitchen closes at 9 pm too, which is good to know before going.  They take resos even for the patio!"}
{"text":"Pizza was amazing.  Service was incredibly attentive and friendly. Overall experience was great. A little overpriced would be its only downside."}
{"text":"Delicious outdoor dining on a side street you wouldn't  expect. Good food and good hospitality!"}
{"text":"We went here for my birthday tonight.  Nice atmosphere inside but it was gorge outside so we are out there. Bug free!! Pizza was absolutely delicious.  Our server, didn't catch her name, was great.  She suggests a perfect red blend wine.  Our food was hot and as ordered.  We also took home tiramisu. Portion was small but still delicious.  I didn't pay but I would definitely go back.  It is somewhat hard to find but its the only thing on the side street.  Big Coca Cola sign; can't miss it."}
{"text":"Hard to find firstly. Bathrooms not in restaurant but down the hall and not very good signage. 
Was late for my reservation as the weather was horrid and was apologizing to the greeter when she kind of cut me off and said 'welcome to the club.' Not sure what she meant and thought it was rude. 
The food was amazing thank God! Great thin crust pizza and the caprese salsa was really fresh and the mozzarella excellent! 
Would return to try more dishes."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place we stumbled upon. Loved the ambience, food, and friendly service. Delicious salads and pasta. Good for the price."}
{"text":"My co-worker suggested we try out this spot so the four us headed there for lunch just down the street. We had reservations for 12:00pm and were happy to be greeted at the door promptly and sat right away. The small space is quaint and inviting. The restaurant was busy. We unfortunately waited 20 minutes to get our food orders taken. While waiting for our food we've asked for extra bread.
By 12:50 we've received our food which was mediocre. My chicken panini could have been less dry by adding some sauce or anything.  It was difficult to get a refill on water. As we only had an hour lunch, we asked for the bill right away. The bill showed they've charged for the extra bread in which my colleague brought to the server's attention that he had never been charged in the past. Although it was a minimal charge, the server protested with obvious annoyance and it was very off putting. Of course we've asked to have this removed. The server had the manager involved, and they reluctantly removed this charge. We were out by 1:20pm. Unfortunately this experience was horrible and not worth the time.  A panini from Timmies would have been great."}
{"text":"YELPERs speak the truth.  This is the best thin crust pizza in town and I live only a block away from it.  Dangerous.  It was my first time here and I thoroughly enjoyed the food and atmosphere.  Our server was helpful and on top of the orders.  I had the Quattro Stagione pizza which was perfectly cooked.  They accompanied the pizza with 3 types of hot peppers, flakes, oil and dense paste.  I love the pepper oil, which I liberally drizzled on my pizza.   I usually leave out the crust but I could not help myself and ate everything.  My sister had the Caprinia pasta which was creamy and delicious and they left this cunning Grana Padano grater, which means you can put as much cheese as you want.  I love this place and the prices are very reasonable.  They are consistently good and my goal in life is to try each and every flavour.  Excellent and it is in my hood.  I am so happy and proud!"}
{"text":"The last time I came, I tried the Commendatore pasta with the squash puree sauce, and it was just ok. The ingredients looked good on the menu, but when all combined in the plate I wasn't enthused. Large portion though! I was super full. I also started with a small arugula salad, and found it to be coated with too much dressing. 

I have been here before though, and have tried the pizzas which I recall being very very good. I would come back to give this place another shot - and next time I'll be sure to order a pizza.

Ambiance is nice and prices reasonable for a nice night out."}
{"text":"We recently frequented M & B for a work function, 17-22 people and it was fantastic!  We were able to book a separate seating area which featured a beautifully crafted harvest-table with accompanying open benches for seating, perfect for accommodating a relatively large group, yet also allowing for a relative degree of intimacy. 

We each contributed 35$ and were rewarded with a selection of antipasto's,pizza's and pasta's! my personal highlight was the Bufalina pizza, an ethereal combination of zesty tomato sauce, buttery bufiliana cheese and peppery arugula piled atop a crunchy thin crust.  M & B is a cool trendy spot, yet it is not the type of place that sacrifices quality food for overt hipness.  This is a real deal spot."}
{"text":"Eat and drink. It's as simple as that. The food here is quite simplistic, but they do it well. Mostly Pizzas and Pastas, but I found the flavours and options a little more diverse than the usual Italian standard. 

Also was really nice the semi private dining area for dinner. We had a large group, and the space was perfect for us to mingle and be loud on the large communal table.  Outside are smaller tables, all with the same rustic wooden tables and feel. 

All the pastas are the same type of noodle, something that looks house made. I got the sausage, pistachio, in cream sauce. It had a mild flavour and was really good. Although, I did prefer my friends mushroom version a bit better. 
We also shared the Patata and Panchetta pizza which was really tasty, even better with some spicy chilli flakes on them. The pizza was thin crust and perfectly crunchy. No sogginess here!

The service was really good. On a tuesday evening it wasn't super busy, but there was a decent about of customers.  All out food came out piping out all the same time with a good quality. I was impressed for a group of about 20, they were able to pull this off. 
Our server was friendly and although not able to do separate bills, let us just pay for what we ordered at the cash as we were leaving. 

I've already booked it for my office party in a few weeks!

Price wise, it's a bit pricey for just pizza at $16+. At least they do it right."}
{"text":"Lovely Italian restaurant. I didn't expected the nice cosy decor from the outside. Best tiramisu I have tried so far in Toronto. Good service.
Not much seating for couples or table of four."}
{"text":"This is place is a hidden gem. Great pasta and great  pizza every time. We love coming here because the flavours are delicious and they have unique ingredients beyond \"classical\" Italian."}
{"text":"Food, service and super cozy, chill vibe are awesome. 
Am never disappointed when I leave here."}
{"text":"Came here one weeknight without reservation for an early dinner and got a table for 2. The place was not packed and had several small tables available and a few occupied larger tables for a midweek dinner time. Even as the night went by, it wasn't very busy for 6 or 7 o'clock. 

Service: We had an attentive waitress who watched our side of the tables as we enjoyed and picked at our appetizer and didn't bother us. Since it was a small table for 2, we were not rushed to finish our shared appetizer and not forced to start our main course yet. 
At first, we were wondering what took our pasta dish so long to arrive since we saw other tables who sat after us receive all their orders. But after asking our waitress about when our pasta would come, she wanted to be sure we were done with our one shared appetizer first.
With that being said---- we have perfect HOT AL DENTE pasta!

Food: We each ordered a wine by glass (price ranges from $8-11 per glass of red). 

Appetizer-Grilled octopus - surprisingly, this was rather a large platter to share. It had a large plate of greens (spinach, olives, potatoes, peppers) and topped with a vinaigrette. 
Between the two of us, we couldn't finish the appetizer (leftover greens)

Main- Frutti Di Mare - The pasta was really fresh. Plate was hot enough and we devoured it quickly!! Love the flavours. It was a simple seafood dish with red sauce but we enjoyed it very much. Proportions were great (shared between two people since we were not that hungry- mostly full from the large appetizer). 

Atmosphere and location: So this place was a little awkward to find. It was hidden away at what looked like a residential/corporate OFFICE type set up. I wasn't sure if I was walking towards the correct plaza since it looked like a residence just based on the parking area (good thing is, I saw there was a parking lot area and a large furniture store). 
As you enter into the building, it is on the main floor - no need to go up elevators. 
The place can fit lots of small tables and definitely, if you need private dining, they had a whole area curtained off and secluded. You can also sit at the bar as well (I did see solo diners by the bar area). 
Good space to hold events for a large group. 
My friend went to this place for a yelp event before and recommended it. 

Overall: next time I'd like to try some of the pizza on the menu as well -It looked very appetizing and smelled great from the tables next to us."}
{"text":"This is one of my go to spots in the city. Amazing fresh pasta- just as good as any overpriced Italian place in toronto- but with very reasonable pricing! Also deliciously rich pizzas fresh from their oven which can be seen (and smelled!) from the dining area. I hate to give it 4 not 5 stars but the ambience could be a bit nicer. Overall a city favourite!"}
{"text":"Came here tonight for dinner with some girlfriends.
On the whole, nothing to complain about.

Unassuming joint.**
Great low-key atmosphere.
Portion sizes were great and reflective of the price.
Bread basket had amazing bread; butter was cooked in the bread.

I have to give props to our server.
He was very attentive and patient with our indecisiveness. Three of us ordered the Mista Salad and our server recommended that we order two instead of three and share it. Nothing irks me more when a server knowingly encourages us to order way more than we can eat.

I ordered the pizza special - arugula, red pepper, and goat cheese. It was AMAZING. 

A solid 4 star.

---------------------------

** - After 6 PM, use the entrance on Ontario Street."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood restaurant with great and fresh food!!! The staff is friendly and helpful! I'll def be coming here again."}
{"text":"Tucked away in the corner of Ontario and King, this place is truly a hidden gem. The service for starters is impeccable; very attentive and our orders came quickly. They also start you off with complimentary bread which is very nice, but the real show stopper is the pizza! The pies are very large and the crusts are super thin, reminiscent of pizza from Sicily. They have a wide selection of pizzas and pastas, so you're bound to find something you like! Also, the interior is so cute. Perfect place for a second date :)"}
{"text":"Very good food! Ordered a pizza, and came fast, but the only thing I would say is that you should make a reservation if your coming here, I didn't make a reservation and they said we can eat there but only for an hour- which we were fine with. Loved the atmosphere, and people were very friendly! Would recommend if your going to the Christmas Market and want to go somewhere to eat, it was about a 10 min walk, but was worth it!"}
{"text":"Love the setup. The food was great. Service was excellent. Noise level was low. All in all my family and I had a good experience."}
{"text":"I thought it was amazing because it's been so long since I've let myself go (Italian-style cheat meals are the best). Partner and I came here tonight because I'm currently carb loading for a half marathon this Sunday. We've been here before for brunch only and found the restaurant very heartwarming, welcoming, and romantic with the twinkling, wicker basket style decor. In the warmer season the sidewalk patio is also open. Unfortunately they are located a bit off the downtown core - still super convenient of a short walk from the Financial District (10-15 minutes) with parking spots everywhere. However, might be hard to find for some folks since the front door is located off to the side, not facing King Street East.

Food- 3.5/5. Again, how could one not love carbs and fat. Italian is always a favorite. However, after consulting my partner, who actually eats Italian food very often when he goes out, he said the pasta and pizza were only \"ok\". A complimentary bread basket featuring \"nice\" bread and EVOO+BV was given at the start. 

Many vegetarian options here for pastas and pizzas compared to other Italian places like Mercatto where vegetarians are pretty much stuck ordering the same 1-2 items every time, i.e. margherita pizza. Not vegan friendly though. We ordered the tricolore pasta (vegetarian), which contained white wine braised zucchini, very few roasted cherry tomatoes, red onions, bocconcini (mozzarella), and basil. All of their pastas are homemade and cooked perfectly al dente (gluten-free pasta is also an option but these are store-purchased). Partner said the pasta was mediocre, better than at Mercatto since more veggie toppings and more veggie options, but comparable to Hot House pastas. The fresh mozzarella bits were my absolute favorite - so chewy and no after taste, very fresh. We also ordered the zucchina pizza, featuring tomato sauce, grilled yellow & green zucchini, bufalo ricotta, red onions, and mint. The dough was thin and a bit soggy due to the tomato sauce except at the crust, which was thick and not too hard, cripsy, or bitter like usual pizza crust. I loved the crust omg, chewy and perfectly risen. The ricotta was also perfection.

PS. The panini sandwiches (around $10) are only available at lunch, sorry.

Value- 4/5. Pretty good value for a romantic, fancy-ish. Mains are between $20-30, but the portion sizes are pretty big and filling unlike at fancier Italian restaurants like Buca.

Venue- 4/5. Twinkle, twinkle little star. Lots of space inside with large tables available for group seating. Perfect for large groups actually, but do make a prior reservation. Lost 1 star for being a bit hard to find.

Service- 3/5. Very warm staff. However, after serving the food and bringing a jug of water we barely saw them again. No offers of fresh pepper or cheese with our mains, but no big deal.

Will be back again, but perhaps after trying a few other Italian restaurants to build up my critic credentials lol"}
{"text":"YUM! I've been wanting to try this place for a while and finally with the Yelp crew, I was able to go. 

Honestly, I tried coming here a few weeks ago and had a hard time finding it. I came upon an office building in which the automatic sliding door did not open...how was I supposed to get into this establishment that clearly states that it is held in 260 King St. and the LARGE numbers above also states that this door is 260! I then went to read the list of tenants and didn't find anything about a pizza place. Ok, dead end. Finally was told that there's a separate entrance on Ontario St. Ok...

It was a small little place and we basically took up the entire restaurant with our 15 people party. The majority of the menu were pizzas, which was perfect because that's what I wanted. I chose the salata which had cheese, tomato sauce, roasted tomatoes, olives, arugula and fresh ricotta. I opted out of the olives since I don't enjoy them. 

The food took a little longer than expected but we were a large party and put them in a crunch making all of our pizzas. That wasn't a big deal to me. The pizzas finally came and wow they were so good. Usually people complain when they don't have enough toppings, well I'm going to complain about having too much. Not that having an abundance of toppings isn't good, it's just it was an overload of ONE topping. Arugula. It completely overpowered the pizza with the bitter taste of arugula, I like arugula but not like this. I felt like I was having a salad with no dressing. I looked over and saw someone else had ordered the same pizza with olives and clearly did not have a full sized salad on his pizza.

I still enjoyed my pizza and the crust was perfect thin without it being too flimsy when picking it up to eat. Waitress was a-ok, we had to ask for more water on separate occassions but the fact that they came in a pitcher with lemon and lime was a plus. 

When visiting again, try not to come with your own entourage of people, a select few, max. 4 people are perfect for this little space. Oh another downer on this place, girls' bathroom has a code key entry. I believe it is 1 and 4 pressed at the same time."}
{"text":"Great quality pasta and the sauce in the pomodoro was delicious! Staff were also super friendly and accommodating. I was a bit disappointed that the prices in the menu were jacked up from the menu on their website though. The amazing pomodoro that I had made up for the prices on the menu though!"}
{"text":"I'll never turn down a pizza, no sir! Pizza is one of those foods that I could (and probably a lot of people out there!) could eat just about every day. On this recent Toronto trip, I was craving pizza on a Sunday night. 

Most importantly, the pizza here was INCREDIBLE. I inhaled every bite of the goeey, thin crusted goodness. We ordered and split the Burina with chili flakes, sausage, and pancetta along with the Patata & Pancetta with it's potatoes, pancetta, and rosemary. I'm a sucker for pizza, pancetta, and thin crust so this place was certainly calling my name!

I will say, the restrooms were incredibly hard to find and the space does have a bit of an identity crisis with lots of random halls and rooms. But it does make the place a tad cool, if a bit confusing. The place was about a third full on the inside but the patio was packed. There was only one server in the whole place that Is saw but she was incredibly efficient which was a nice surprise. Typically when a place looks understaffed, you worry you'll be waiting around all night. 

But in the end, full tummy was full and I was happy so a SOLID four stars for me!"}
{"text":"Best and most authentic thin crust wood oven Napolitano Pizza. Take it from me - I'm definitely a Pizza snob ;)"}
{"text":"Came here for a lunch for a table of 6, on a wednesday around 1pm and luckily there was no wait. Tucked inside an office building, with a coca cola-isque sign on side on the outside, it can be hard to find. 

Got a caprese salad to start, the balsamic dressing was really good and the cheese, tomatoes and arugula felt fresh. Then got the Commendatore pasta ($19), it came with spiral pasta ( I do wish they tell you want type of pasta on the menu) It was delicious a mix of ground sausage with lots of pistachios in a cream sauce, it wasn't overly salty and just really hit the spot. The portion was large. You can also ask for a bunch of hot sauces and chili flakes which made it even better.

Would definitely come back to try their other pastas and I really want to try their pizza!

fyi - Sparkling water is $2.50 per person and bread is an extra $2"}
{"text":"Usually I wouldn't even consider eating at such a high priced Italian restaurant.  I just can't see myself paying more than a couple of bucks for pasta or anything else I could easily make at home. Take Subway for example, I can make all of that crap at home. The only thing I can't provide is the overwhelming number of fruit flies (pre and post-mortem) that Subway includes.  People act like they don't see those fruit flies, when in reality they're embedded in those awful sandwiches. 

Anyway, Mangia & Bevi is sooo expensive! I can't hate, cuz that's how you keep the freaks out.  I couldn't really pronounce anything on the menu, so i got a pizza. It was hands down the most delicious thing I've eaten this year.  It was paid for by my employer, so I savored every free bite.  I can't ever eat at pizza pizza again now; I wont. Up theirs.  I can't believe I worked so close to this place and never had lunch there!   You'd never know that as early as two weeks ago a squirrel was brutally electrocuted and fell 50 feet to it's gruesome death right in front of this restaurant.  I saw the whole thing happen. The squirrel's fried body lingered around the entrance for quite some time..  I don't think they noticed though, they were too busy making delicious pizzas :) FIVE STARS!!"}
{"text":"It's kind of difficult to find this place because, although the address is on King street, the entrance is on Ontario street.

Our group ordered the lunedi (special), carnivora, and patata & pancetta pizzas. They were all delicious! I would say they live up to their claim of being the best pizza in Toronto because I have not tasted better pizza in the city.

We found the size of each pizza to be enough for one person.  Others in our group ordered pastas and were disappointed by the portion size.

The decor is nice and the restaurant isn't too noisy. However, it is odd that the washrooms are not located inside the restaurant.

Overall we had a great experience and will be coming back for more pizza!"}
{"text":"2.5 rounded up. 

Good pizza, love the thin crust. I ordered the Patata & Pancetta for $13.67. Lovely decor; comfy seats, warm light, suitable art. 

My friends and I stayed for about three hours as we waited for latecomers to arrive and eat and also taking this resto's name literally for its \"social hang out.\" Thus, it was rather disconcerting to have our server constantly badgering us to leave, :/. lol, even when she did come by she'd ignore the empty jug of water. I'd understand if it was a busy afternoon or whatnot but, it wasn't (Sundays are more brunch-y days, no?) and that kind of ruined the experience for me.

Prolly wouldn't make a return-visit."}
{"text":"I ordered the Octopus salad for lunch. Portioning of the Octopus could have been better. I only got one small tentacle..but the salad itself was huge- I was stuffed!"}
{"text":"Not bad for mediocre Italian food. Quite close to the financial district on King. The beet salad was solid. Will try a different pasta next time though. The tiramisu was disappointing. But the panna cotta was good but super tiny. And they want to charge you $2.75 per person if you want extra bread. Really?!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is really clean, and the food is above average. The workers are friendly, and it's in a really nice location. The pizza, while extremely delicious, is really, really, small. It took 2 pizza's to fill me up. If you get it with extra sauce though, it's sooooooo good. I'll be back whenever I'm in town. :)"}
{"text":"I love MB! The pizza is up there with the best I'm the city, but you don't get the long lines and pretentious crowd. Prices are the same though...lol. Service is great - almost feels like a family owned restaurant. Big kudos ! Happy I found this place!"}
{"text":"What an incredible find this gem of an eatery is! I came here for lunch and ordered a chicken and brie panini and a Stella on tap.  The food was incredible, the atmosphere was pleasant and I got to overhear some interesting conversations! Such a lovely restaurant in Corktown. Have to return for dinner."}
{"text":"Friendly service and quite good service in this Terroni clone. Love the patio."}
{"text":"M&B does pizza and they do it right. Probably the best thin crust pizza in Toronto. Step inside if you can find it. There are 2 entrances, one on Ontario St. that has some sort of M&B signage, another on king inside the office building. I recommend coming in through Ontario St. and come up the stairs where you will be welcomed with the delicious aroma of pizza and a surprising decor. 

Don't be fooled by the blue glass and white concrete exterior of the building, there interior is rustic but chic. Exposed duct work, wood ceilings, white brick walls, worn wood banquettes, black leather cover chairs, and what I like to call \"THE TABLE\". 

\"THE TABLE\" is probably the coolest table in the entire place. Great for holding a large party and possibly used for communal dining. This table has inlay tiles, fancy brown suede seats, and seats up to 15 people.

Service was great as far as large tables go. I came in a very large group of about 12 and the server greeted all of us and was very accommodating. She brought out some free bread and olive oil since it took so long to fire all our pizzas. She had great pizza recommendations and was more than happy to split the bill up so everyone could pay separately. 

The pizza is tremendous. Since coming back from New York a few months ago I've been craving some good pizza and all the pizzas I've had in between just wasn't up to snuff. Mangia e Bevi was a refreshing burst of life in my pizza-world. It's not a New York style pie, it's a thin crust pizza and a good one at that. I got the Prosciutto Funghi pizza. The crust is thin, crisp, and slightly charred, sauce is fresh and not too seasoned, and the cheese is fresh and they don't put too much. The one gripe I have about the pizza is that the crust needs a bit more of a chewiness as I found it to be slightly dense. That being said still the best pizza in our fine city.

Overall, probably my favorite thin crust pizza in the city. At an average price of $12 it is definitely worth a try. Don't be discouraged by the awkward building and location like I was the first time I passed by as I'm still kicking myself for not trying it sooner."}
{"text":"Best Italian style pizza in town. I eat here at least once a month when the pizza craving hits and you want a delicious one."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came on a Monday night for dinner after receiving a recommendation from a friend. It was 1/2 price bottles of wine (select bottles) so we tried the Ripasso which was great and only $23! (After the discount). We ordered a Large Arugula & Parm Salad which was delicious and large enough that we both had good sized portions. We then split the Pancetta & Potato White Pizza which was great. I ordered well done. Next time I'd ask for a little extra sauce on it as it was dry in sections. Overall it was delicious! Their oven gives the wood-fired finish without being soft or floppy in the middle of the pizza. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I was on the quest to try a great Carbonara pasta so i began my search online and came across Mangia & Bevi from a couple of reviews here on Yelp. I opted for this place due to its convenient location with it being a short walk from my college. Being an Italian Cuisine fanatic i was quite excited to try it out.

As i made my treck to the restaurant i made sure to keep my eyes peeled for it because according to other Yelpers who have been there its located in quite a secretive spot. Luckily enough for me i made my way easily there.

The restaurant has a little outside seating but unfortunately it was raining and therefore it wouldn't have been ideal to sit outside. Up the stairs you go to a little quaint place. Dimly lit with a couple of tables as well as a bar seating. However , first thing i noticed  or should i say smelled upon entering was the wiff of fresh pizza being made , which made me question what it was that i wanted to order. Was i going to opt out of having pasta and have pizza instead ? I stayed by my words and ordered the pasta. 

The waitress who served me was quite attentive which would be one of the reasons i gave this place a 5/5 rating. I went ahead and ordered my pasta impatiently waiting as i was quite hungry , but then i was served some bread along with balsamic vinegar and EVOO , i only had some of the bread which mind you tasted fresh and delicious but only negative thing i would say is that they should have added more balsamic vinegar to the EVOO

Finally out came my pasta. For those who dont know what Carbonara is its a pasta cooked in egg , cream and pancetta.  First things first , the pasta quality itself was superb , thick and fresh. The sauce was delicious , pancetta to pasta ratio was perfect and so was the sauce its saltiness from the pancetta made this dish perfect and not overwhelmingly salty.

I  would definitely come back here next time and go for the pizza !!"}
{"text":"Tried this place after reading a few reviews, and was very impressed with this place. The biggest complaint was finding it....it was a mission and a half.  Its inside a building, and the entrance is actually not on King, but off Ontario st.... 

The outside looks like it will be a very local pub if anything but once we got inside, it was really cute and quaint.  Very impressed.

Drink prices were very reasonable, a 19 oz stella 9 bucks.

Now the good parts, the food.  
Ordered the Carpaccio, with arugula...and it was so good.  The dressing on the arugula was perfect.  

I ordered the comandetore, and my friend she ordered the frutti de mare.  The pasta tasted fresh and was cooked to perfection.  The flavours were all there.  Her muscles was cooked perfectly.

Desert was great as well.

Service here was extremely good as well.

Now why not 5 stars , its just little things that really don't make a difference of me comping back or not but still.  One was finding it :)  2. the bread wasn't that great IMO personally, and also according to the menu, you have to pay for extra bread lol.  We never use a full basket (even the little one giving) but still...."}
{"text":"The food is good here. I came in for lunch, ordered a lunch size pasta. It came with a salad but I found the lunch sized pasta very small, plus the salad isn't enough food. For the price, I was expecting more. The service is decent. I think overall I don't think the price is worth it. It's pretty much mandatory to make a reservation otherwise you won't get a table, especially if it's a Friday. The place is not big so seating is limited. I wanted to give it 3.5 stars because the food is decent, but overpriced for the size. I'm not sure it totally deserves 4 stars so I rounded down. Room for improvement."}
{"text":"Amazing pasta, wine, and service. I ordered the Commendatore and my wife ordered the Carbonara. Both dishes reminded us of the quality of pasta and ingredients we experienced on our honeymoon in Italy. This place is a gem! Arrivederci!!!!"}
{"text":"Surprising to see everyone rating the pizza so high. Way overrated - I'd give 5/10 at best. For the price I paid ($22), the pizza is 1/10. The pizza literally had tomato sauce, cheese, and wild boar sausage only. The dough is comparable to the ones you get at pizza pizza. The server was friendly until she realized that we weren't getting any alcoholic beverages with the pizza. For beer, they only have steam whistle and stella on tap, and they're $9 each. It also seems like they reuse the chilli dips that come with the pizza & I'm sure some people double dip into those without using the spoon that comes with it. Extremely overpriced mediocre food - don't come here. 

+1 star for location & patio decor."}
{"text":"This unassuming little gem is full of deliciousness! You walk in the door and the aromas are just a teaser. Every bite was a feast of flavors. The octopus was pretty good, though not spectacular. The pasta and the pizza, however, were super yummy! My only complaint was the limited wine selection, especially when it came to the whites. We were seated at one of the smaller tables and asked to move. (That \"table for four\" was a tight squeeze because the table doesn't really seat four grownups. The party that did sit there could not fit either so someone sat at the head of the table, on the bench next to it... kinda awkward.) I digress...The service was friendly and attentive and  the food was simply excellent! They also do take out, so consider that the next time you want Italian in the comfort of your own home (and you're not hitched up with one). It was my first time there, but certainly not my last!"}
{"text":"@MBRESTO #YELPTO #PIZZAS #PASTAS #LUNCHTIME

The Brand: On point (fleek, as they say)! Check out their website, and you'll see what I mean. 

The Restaurant: Rustic, intimate, great for work lunches. Mind you, this place fills up fast. 

The Food: I ordered pasta - the Fungocrema for $18. That's steep for pasta - especially the serving they provide. Regardless, it's the best I've ever had. So I'm not complaining. 

The Service: Speedy. We were in a rush to get back to work and even though we had to wait to be seated, we were done lunch on time. 

The Verdict: Can't say the name yet, but I'd love to be back."}
{"text":"Tucked away between two office buildings, Mangia & Bevi is definitely not a place you're just going to stumble upon. But that's okay because you shouldn't leave your encounter with this wood-fired haven to chance.

The service is casual but the food sure isn't. At around $14 a pop, the pizzas are perfectly priced and obnoxiously sized. I'm not one to leave 'za on the plate (it's a problem) but I had to concede defeat. Or at least that's what I did until I got back to my hotel an hour later.

Expect a bit of a struggle to pick out your pie with a full page of fantastic options to choose from. I went with one of the veggie options combining fresh ricotta and arugula with incredibly flavourful olives and roasted tomatoes. It was absolutely delicious but I feel I'll always be wondering what might have happened had I been lured toward one of their gorgonzola features...

Next time, M&B. Next time..."}
{"text":"Discovered this place when we moved to the area a few weeks ago and our first visit was outstanding.  Unfortunately the second time we went we were disappointed.

We made  a reservation and we seated beside a large group.  We sat for 15 minutes without our server coming by even though she was in and out with the large group that was finishing up their meal.  I finally went to the bar and asked the manager (?) if we had a server.  'Our' server snapped she would be over when she 'had a minute'.  

When she did arrive a few minutes later she was unapologetic and rude.  The manager did not spot check our table during our visit.  At the end the server mumbled a have hearted apology.

The pizzas were great but 2 of us ordered pasta which was undercooked beyond al dente - needed another 30 seconds.

It's a shame because our first experience was so positive I was actually a bit embarrassed to have brought friends there.  Not sure if we will return as there are so many great Italian options in the city."}
{"text":"We had a solid lunch on the patio here the other day. The patio is nice and shady under big red umbrellas, and the seating is comfy. I had the soup and the grilled ham and cheese - both were good. My lunch mate had the spicy sausage panini and a side salad. The panini was a bit bland, as the sausage wasn't spicy at all, but otherwise it was fine. The side salad was a rip off at $4 - when are restaurants going to learn that lettuce with dressing is not a \"salad\"!?!? Despite this, we'll be back to try out the pizza (they looked delicious)!"}
{"text":"I tried their brunch sampler menu the other day. It's pretty hard to find as it's hidden inside an office building. The restaurant in itself isn't too shabby. It's a bit small so if you have a big group, you're probably going to be really cramped together.

I tried their pizza which was delicious, extremely thin crust which I liked. Their sandwiches were also really good. I have no idea what they did to it but the crispiness combined with the bacon and sauce just made it soooo good. I also got to try their french toast which was ok. Nothing too special about it. Out of everything I tried, I actually liked their sandwiches the most.

This place is probably best to hit if you want a casual lunch/brunch. Just remember, their brunch is only available on Saturdays."}
{"text":"Very tasty and most everything on the menu has gluten free. Pizza looked good but went with some very nice pasta. Good experience."}
{"text":"My husband and I recently had a date night here and while the food was pretty good, their service determined that we would not be going back. Basically we had to make an extra extra effort to be acknowledged when we walked in, and throughout the meal for service.

Overall....unfriendly atmosphere but decent food. Maybe it was just an off-day, but there are too many places out there with wonderful food and great service, to bother trying this one out again."}
{"text":"This is based on the food that was delivered.

The carbonara came with fresh, chewy pasta that didn't go soggy from it being delivered. The four cheese pizza was also great!"}
{"text":"Every restaurant was packed in The Distillery District so we opted for this simple and affordable eatery that offers all the Italian essentials.

The weather was mild so we sat on the rustic terrace with wooden benches. We were given our menus right away, and the bread came soon after. Everything smelled delicious which put us in a good mood.

My fiancé ordered COMMENDATORE pasta which costed $21 and had sausage, smoked provolone,
spinach, leeks, pistachios, and cream. I took (stole) a bite of it, it was creamy and comforting like being wrapped in freshly laundered blankets.

With that said, I enjoyed my own pasta immensely better. The actual name of the dish escapes me but it essentially had fusilli with squid and sausage in a spicy tomato sauce. Did it hit the spot? Totally! The level of spiciness was perfect for me and I loved how chewy the squids were. 

Why only 3 stars then? Well it was just another run of the mill Italian restaurant that lacked creativity and refinement but did everything that they are supposed to."}
{"text":"After running away frightened from crazy lines at the Christmas market, our group tried this out. It is a bit tucked away, but was really cozy and we had no trouble getting seated without a reservation. We were all really happy with the pizzas & chianti we ordered. They were great with customizing for a few in our groups with allergies. Minus one star for SLOW service, but we had great food and a great time. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Decked out in Coca-Cola memorabilia, cute at first but eventually you find yourself looking for the Applebee's sign at the door.

It's kinda like what Queen Margarita will become when it starts opening up in strip malls throughout town.  

Suburbanites flock here because it's \"downtown\" and has foreign words in the title.    It also serves 'expensive pizza', which is essentially white people kryptonite. 

There's better pizza to be found in the city, but this ain't terrible.  

Great service.   Decent ambiance.   A totally safe bet."}
{"text":"It was very good, I had the ravioli funghi and my husband had the pasta commendatore. The ambiance is very cute and trendy, the prices are about $20-$25 for a pasta dish, so not too cheap, and the service was friendly. I would give it a 3.5/5."}
{"text":"With all the 'rustic Italian' restos opening lately, it's easy to overlook Mangia & Bevi, a brother and sister run restaurant which has been around since 2005. But anyone who is willing to give this place a shot will be in for a treat! 

I imagine this place is busy during lunch hour from workers in the building and nearby offices. But I came on a Sunday evening and it was nice and quiet. We got a table without a reservation. 

The address says King St., but there is no sign on the entrance on King St. (an office building with a large parking lot in front). Just look for \"260\" and enter the front door. Alternately, there is an entrance on Ontario St. (And after 6pm and on weekends, the King St. door is locked, so for sure go through Ontario St.). 

FOOD: simple, homemade Italian staples. You will find a selection of antipasti, paninis (lunch only), pastas and pizzas. Unlike many other Italian restaurants, there are no 'primi' (or meat-based entrees). 
My party shared the Bufalina ($14) (vine tomatoes, bufala mozzarella, arugula, basil, olive oil) and the Funghi Nordica ($14)(sauteed mixed mushrooms, shaved parmigiano, arugula, olive oil, balsamic vinegar) to start. Both were spot on. 
For the pasta dishes, they don't specify the type of noodle because I think it changes from day to day. On this day, they were making all the dishes with fusilli. I had the Norma ($14) -- eggplant, fresh basil, and a generous dollop of ricotta cheese, with a tomato sauce. The pasta was really firm. Definitely al dente, but I actually would've preferred it just a tiny bit more cooked. The sauce was really flavourful and fresh. The ricotta on top was cold, which made for a nice contrast. Had a bite of one DC's pizza (the daily special -- which had artichokes, onions, and porchetta), and it was delicious! 
For dessert, they only have one offering. But when that offering is an impeccable tiramisu ($6), you don't really need anything else. The tiramisu is one of the lightest I've ever had. I don't know what they mixed in with the marscapone cheese, but it is celestial. The cake at the bottom is drenched in grand marnier without being soggy, and has just a hint of orange flavour. I smile just thinking about it...

WINE: good selection available by the glass/half litre/bottle. There are a lot more reds than whites. 

AMBIANCE: the space is cozy and warm with vintage Italian posters on the exposed-brick walls. There is a huge rack of magazines at the front, presumably for those waiting for takeout or solo diners (or I guess, couples who have run out of things to talk about:P). There is a separate room off the one side that looks like it would be a great place for a small private party. At the back, you can see (and smell) pizza coming out fresh from the oven. There's a TV at the bar, locked on TSN. When we arrived, they were playing the hockey game and it was kind of noisy. But shortly after we ordered, they put it on mute and started playing some music (some bossa nova, then Adele's CD).

SERVICE: our waiter was relaxed and friendly. He was able to give some advice to indecisive diners about what to order (everything sounded so good!). I like a waiter with an opinion. He almost brought us our tiramisu without the cocoa powder sprinkled on top, but right before he got to our table, turned around to correct that. So we had a good laugh about that! The back of the servers' t-shirts says: 12\" uncut. Referring to the pizza, of course. 

ETC: the women's washroom is actually outside of the restaurant just across the hallway in the little alcove. You need to push #1 and #4 to unlock the door. Just make sure to lock it behind you too!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a casual Italian place to try, and was excited to spend Friday night at Mangia & Bevi based on all of the glowing reviews.  After a lackluster meal however, all I can say is  - really?  

Bad sign #1 - easily being able to make 8:00 reservations at 6:30.
Bad sign #2 - the restaurant being at 50% capacity on a Friday night at 8pm.
Bad sign #3 - being ushered to our table and forgotten about for 15 minutes . . . 15 minutes . . . in a restaurant that was half empty on Friday night . . . 

and then we met her, our server, Red Hair, No Brains (RHNB).  I'll spare you all the gory details, but the highlights included: having to ask RHNB to fill up my water four times, and a glass for my husband never arriving, having RHNB SPILL WATER ON MY LAP with no apology, just a casual 'oh, that didn't work', and the icing on the cake, having RHNB serve our pizza with her bandaged thumb touching the crust - ummm, disgusting?!

The food was okay.  The portion sizes for apps and pizzas were generous, the salad was fresh, and the pizza crust was thin, but honestly, for atmosphere, service and food, this place does not compare to Libretto, QMP, Terroni or Mercatto.  

Suffice to say, we won't return."}
{"text":"Love the thin crust pizza but it was a bit too thin and didn't hold the toppings well. That said, the actual crust was one of the handful of crusts that I ate at any pizza place. Good atmosphere except for the large coat rack in the back room and lack of authentic music. Very good service. Great bread with olive oil and balsamic served before meal. Would return to try the pasta."}
{"text":"Finally tried this restaurant after living in the area for over 2 years. Yes, it's taken me that long. It's tucked in on a quiet Ontario St. When you walk in, the restaurant has a nice casual, rustic feel. It was pretty full on a Friday evening. We had been seated in a booth and our server brought some waters over.

We ordered some wine and pastas. I had the Commendatore and it was really good. It was a mix of sausage, provolone, spinach, leeks etc. My friend had Affumicata and they also enjoyed it. 

Service was good as well. I would go back to Mangia & Bevi if I was craving some Italian for sure. It would be a nice spot for a date or a night out with friends."}
{"text":"Amazing food!! Went here with a group of friends and everybody loved their food.

Taking a point off for rude waitress; who was very impolite and had no common courtesy. She made such a wonderful experience negative for us."}
{"text":"Was looking for a new spot to try for my birthday dinner and came across this restaurant on the app. Couldn't be happier! Such delicious food and great service (I had this weekend's special). It's on a side street so it's easy to miss, but definitely a hidden gem. Will be back soon. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Went last night as a group of 4. Pizza was pretty good, the mediterranea had great olives on it. But the real star of the show was the Commendatore pasta dish, one of the best I've had in a long while. The pistachios were the perfect finishing touch. I highly reccommend it! Atmosphere of the resto was great too; un-assuming, rustic, and warm. They've got a private curtained off area for dinner party sizes- will def book for my next group outing."}
{"text":"First time going there... Had a meeting in the area and client recommended the space....

They have great paninis which make for a nice light lunch and service was awesome... We were discussing business so the staff didn't come and bother us over and over to see if we wanted to get anything else... The bill was sent when we asked for it.

Will definitely come back again for biz meeting next time in the area..."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went here the other night.  It was kind of hard to find but that may be because we weren't locals.  Luckily we ran into a couple that was going to the restaurant themselves and must've noticed the dazed out-of-town look in our eyes because they led us right there in that friendly Canadian way.  

Their beer selection was limited at two beers.  But they ARE an Italian restaurant and I'm sure their wine was lovely. 

We started by splitting the Funghi Nordici which is an arugula salad with mixed sauteed mushrooms, balsamic vinegar and parmigiano.   She then ordered her pasta dish, Tricolore, and I ordered my pizza, the Peperina. The pizza was some of the best thin crust I've ever had, it could've used a bit more goat cheese though, like a piece of cheese per piece of pizza.  The pasta was excellent as well.  From what I understand the pasta is made there, fresh, daily.  And cooked perfectly.  It was hard to narrow it down to what we did.  If you like a variety to choose from, knowing everything is going to be good, than you'd like this menu. 

The atmosphere is a bit trendy for my taste.  Trendy, but not pretentious. But I know some people like that.  Our waitress made us feel at ease as we struggled to pronounce everything correctly.  Because, what is more annoying than someone who pretends they know how to pronounce something and doesn't?"}
{"text":"Came here the other day to try out the brunch menu. The restaurant is a bit hard to find at first as it is tucked away. The restaurant itself is quite nice. It has an industrial type look and has a good amount of seating (combination of stools, chairs and benches). The servers were very friendly. As I had attended as apart of a yelp event I had the opportunity sample a wide variety of their items all of which were delicious - especially the pizza. I would come back if I was in the area.

Feedback: To make the restaurant easier to find it may be helpful to have a sign on King street directing customers to the store. I have seen many other restaurants do this effectively."}
{"text":"The pizza is just as delicious as Pizzeria Libretto but with way less attitude and a lot more charm.

The ambience is great for a date night and the restaurant always feels 'just busy enough'.  We never feel crammed or rushed here and there is a nice rustic vibe to the restaurant.  The one kind of annoying thing is that there is no washroom in the actual restaurant, so you need to leave through a side door to use a washroom with a key.  (You are still inside the building though - you just exit the restaurant into an attached hallway area where the washroom is located).  

The warm, crusty bread and olive oil served as soon as you sit down is always perfectly fresh and very high quality.  The servers are not pretentious at all but are very knowledgeable and are happy to chat about food and wine pairings.  We ordered a bottle of Monte Zovo Sa Solin Valpolicella Ripasso 2012 ($50).  While this felt like a bit of a high price point for that wine, it was outstanding with our pizzas.  The wine service was also very good, and our server made sure that our glasses were always full without rushing us to guzzle down the bottle as soon as our food was gone.

The pizzas are so so good.  We shared a white pizza (patata and pancetta) and a 'red' pizza (trenta).  The gorgonzola, speck and arugula on the trenta pizza was delicious and you can tell that the ingredients are very fresh and selected carefully.  If you ask for it, they also bring out a plate of two types of chili oil and crushed chili flakes and it adds a nice amount of heat to the pizza.  The crust of the pizza is flawless too - the perfect combination of crispy and chewy.

We were lingering as we enjoyed our wine and ended up sharing a panna cotta for dessert.  I think that the panna cotta was infused with Bailey's and coffee and was pretty well done.  The texture was nice and velvety, but the actual dessert was very small for the price (I think $7).

This is a great place to head to on a night when you have time to just sit and enjoy delicious things."}
{"text":"This place had excellent food made with high quality ingredients.  The service was pretty darn good too - considering that my table for two came at the same time as a few other really huge (6 or more people) tables. I was very impressed overall.  The food was what I like to call 'frankly italian'... while the presentation was obviously curated, it was straightforward, simply good food. No flowers on the plates or anything stacked up precariously to enhance 'presentation' (and skimp on your portion), just well presented, lovely, and delicious.  Get a pizza.... so tastey - mine had a touch of mint on it (I was feeling adventurous) and it was heaven.

This place has a big party room at the back with long bench-style tables, perfect for a semi-casual get together with friends.  Honestly, my only complaint (if it could even be called that) is that towards the back of the restaurant, there are some windows that look out into a florescent-lighted hallway - thats where the bathroom is - and the light pours into the restaurant.  They have put up some sheer curtains, but as a hater of headache-enducing florescent light (also not a flattering look on date night) I was slightly put off by that.  Again, its just at the back, but thats where we sat.  Time for darker curtains perhaps???"}
{"text":"Très bonnes pizzas ! Assez bondé donc il ne faut pas hésiter à réserver. Ambiance détendue. \"Best pizza in town\" dit une affiche à l'entrée, oui c'est possible."}
{"text":"I have been craving pizza lately. Oddly enough, I do not eat much pizza at home in Toronto, but I do a lot when traveling. I did some research and became intrigued by Mangia & Bevi. People rave about their pizzas, and they seem to consistently fall in the lists of the best pizzas in Toronto.

I had a hard time deciding whether to give this restaurant a shot because when choosing a pizzeria, I first confirm that they have a wood burning oven, and Mangia & Bevi does not use one. Yet, I made a reservation here anyway because reviewers consistently pointed out how much these pizzas tasted like or were better than wood oven pizzas. Gasp!

The Good

Reservations were easy to make. I did not have a problem getting a large group reservation
The pizzas were good when hot
Prices were decent and comparable to other pizzerias (e.g., Pizzeria Libretto-my favorite pizza in Toronto)
The pastas looked delicious, and the one friend that ordered it loved it-but too pricey

The Not-So-Good

Service was horrendous-we were in a private room and had to go out to the main room to get service. Even after making it known to the manager that no one had taken our orders, or been asked about drinks, we were still ignored and had to get up and search for staff to request for assistance-every time we needed something. It was like the staff pretended that we did not exist
The pizzas turned into cardboard once they cooled. I ate half of my pizza, and did not bother taking the other half home-could not fathom how it could be saved
Bread was not included. We had to pay for every basket of bread

In Sum

You are better off going to Pizzeria Libretto or Pizzeria Defina! Don't waste your time with Mangia & Bevi!

{"text":"I first learned about Mangia & Bevi when my friend introduced it as an \"awesome place with great food\" and made it the venue for his birthday dinner. What a true hidden gem! It was hard to find even when we literally had the address in our hands. However, the confusing layout was all but forgotten when we were finally inside, warmly greeted, and sat at a long, classy high top by bar.

The antipastos we shared were bountiful. The wine service was timely. Everyone's meals were reported to be delicious. I must admit that I didn't get a chance to try anyone else's dishes other than a slice of thin and tasty pizza, but my Commendatore pasta featuring sausage, smoked provolone, spinach, pistachio, and cream was so good that I found myself getting a little protective when I could feel other people's eyes on it. 

With such delightfully executed food and service at such reasonable prices, M&B is the perfect example of how curiosity might get you into the door at least once elsewhere, but that only a great experience like this will have you coming back time and again. I can hardly wait to go back and try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"We wanted really good pizza with lots of meat and cheese and flavour and this place delivered! Cute little restaurant with a good sized menu. The pizzas are 12in and thin crust so my hungry friend and I were able to polish off two. Maybe we were just eating our feelings though.
Anyway, the staff was great and helpful in suggesting menu items and the beer and wine list was excellent.
It was a tad on the pricier side ($20-22 per pizza) but it was well worth it!
Will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"excellent four cheese pizza but the senatore, one of their paninis, was pretty tasteless and dry! 

so

go for the pizzas, and stay to see who walks in from the toronto sun building. sunshine!"}
{"text":"We just had our annual Christmas bash at Mangia & Bevi.  The food and service were excellent.  The thin crust wood oven pizzas are to die for.  Also the lamb shank was delightful."}
{"text":"I was a regular here for a long time until I moved out of the city. It's just phenomenal. Once you go a few times, you're considered a regular and are treated as such. They remember you/your name and suddenly you're family. The pizza is to die for and the sandwiches are a great take-away lunch option. The service is super friendly and the espresso is divine. 

I can't think of anything I don't like. It's a great date place, lunch meeting place, take-away option, or just a \"drop in and say hi\" kind of place. 

I love these guys and their two gorgeous dogs, Aria and Charlie."}
{"text":"Excellent food. They have take out and delivery as well. My GF loved their lasagna. Close to the best she has had. Not the cheapest place in town but the food is 100% worth every penny."}
{"text":"Beef carpacio is good, pizza is fresh. Good, over priced Italian food at best. However, great patio for drinks located on a surprisingly quiet street."}
{"text":"This place is soooo amah-zing! My fiancée and I went for a late lunch. The building is just around the corner from my place but I never noticed it. I read the positive reviews on Yelp and thought I'd give it a shot. We were the only people but it was raining so we weren't concerned. 

I ordered the blood orange S.Pellegrino, I really like that they put a slice of blood orange in my small rocks glass. Nice touch. We got a beet and goat cheese salad to start. The portion was awesome and all the flavours were on point. I think the salad had some fresh herbs which was very tasty.

We then got a pizza and pasta to share. The zucchina (tomato sauce / mozzarella / grilled zucchini / goat cheese / mint /we added prosciutto) and The commendatore (sausage / smoked provolone / spinach / leeks / pistachios / cream). They were absolutely delicious and we had half the pizza for take out. 

Prices were good for the huge portion sizes. My only suggestion would be to have a different way to pack the take out. Ours was just wrapped in tinfoil then put in a paper bag. 

Overall great lunch and the server was friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Walked by this place many times, but never saw it because of the location. Is this a good thing or a bad thing. I believe location is important, but at the same time if the food is great there is not necessary where they are located. 

Started of with the antipasto misto. It was a nice touch.

finished off with a margherita pizza. Good Italian style pizza. 

Thanks."}
{"text":"Great pizza! Loved the parmigiana (buffalo mozzarella, tomatoes, arugula, and prosciutto di parma)"}
{"text":"Solid place for Italian food in the neighbourhood serving what I think is authentic Italian food. It is very lively inside and they have a nice outdoor patio. They offer paninis during lunch time for an affordable price, around $7-9 - I had the Italian BLT (pancetta, tomatoes, avocado, friulano cheese, arugula, bomba sauce) and it was so much better than a regular BLT because of the interesting toppings. Also whatever bread they used was reeeeally good - it was kind of like a baguette but not overly hard or anything, and really delicious. Some kind of Italian bread? On a second occasion I ordered the fungocrema pasta, which was mostly mushroom and cheese and pasta. I thought it was a good pasta, a good lunch portion, not too heavy despite the sauce being cream-based, and enjoyable and delicious despite not having any meat in it. They do takeout as well, but only for their paninis and pizzas, which also look quite good, thin crust and authentic. Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend threw a suggestion for lunch out of left field today! 

One of her customers came and raved about the pizza at Mangia and Bevi - a very cool looking joint on the east side (right across from the Toronto Sun building) on King Street East ... and I was excited to try something different. 

We had a simple lunch:  I had the Salata Pizza, pretty nice with ricotta, black olives, roasted tomatoes and arugula and my girlfriend had the Giudaica, which was excellent! It had percorino, artichokes, mozzerella and mint. One of the nicest combinations I have tried. We shared both pizzas and unanimously declared the Giudaica the champ!

If they had a wood-burning oven, it would put their pizza over the top!

I also love that they serve hot antipasto with the pizzas!

The wine was basic, but the portions were quite generous for the price.
Good simple quaffing wine. I had a really nice glass of Nero D'Avola for eight bucks!

Service was really nice and the everyone appeared to be very down-to-earth.

I would love to return for dinner sometime ... and perhaps try one of the pastas or even the funghi nordici salad (sautéed mixed mushrooms / arugula x-v oil / aged balsamico / parmigiano)

Ciao for now and head out to Mangia sometime soon!"}
{"text":"Had dinner there last night with my partner, our baby , my sister and brother in-law. We didn't have reservations, but they were able to seat us in 10 mins, even though it was busy. We had a good server with blue hair. I had the Carnivora and it was delicious . Hope to go back soon."}
{"text":"If you didn't have a cool friend like Angela H. to tell you what's hot in the city, you'd never find a place like M&B, which stands for Mangia & Bevi (\"food and drink\" in Italian). It's tucked away on the first floor of 260 King Street East, which is a recessed office building near George Brown College. Luckily I *do* have a friend like Angela, and we met today to have a fabulous quickie lunch at M&B. I will definitely be returning. 

We split a big buffalo mozzarella salad ($10) made with arugula, sliced tomatoes, cheese and balsamic vinegar/oregano dressing. Very yummy. But it was all just in anticipation of their mouthwatering pizza, which I may very well have devoured in its entirety (it was huge) had Angela not been there to stop me (and finish half of it). The quatro formaggio (\"four cheese\") pizza had the mildest of blue cheeses (I think it may very well have been \"Bleu d'Auvergne\") along with three other savoury, good quality cheeses all topped on a thin, perfectly baked crust. This pizza was so great it rivalled Terroni or Pizzeria Libretto - seriously. 

As a bonus, the atmosphere was fun and friendly and we sat at a huge table atop plush backed barstools with some other folks who were clearly enjoying their lunch as much as we were!"}
{"text":"You would never know this place was there unless you went specifically looking for it.

Feels like a casual, neighbourhood pub. They have a small patio area in the back on a quiet side street.

Ordered a prosciutto & funghi pizza. Looked uninspiring and tasted rather bland. I'm not purposely being harsh. I've had the pizza at Bottega Pizzeria in Montreal several times now and they've raised the (pizza) bar pretty high for me."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza, and a very cute spot. Only reason it's not getting 5 stars is because it failed to have that wow factor. But I will definitely return"}
{"text":"My favourite Italian in the city. Discovered it when my brother lived in the area about 5 years ago, he moved out and we would still all drive down here from other parts of Toronto to congregate. I'm partial to the Burina Pizza - have a hard time ordering anything else. Great decor and vibe, awesome service."}
{"text":"Quite delicious pizza!! Someone from work made a reservation here and even though we worked right across the street for almost a month, most of us had never heard of this place before. 

When we got there, we were the only people in the restaurant even though it was past 6pm. I guess that is pretty early for dinner, but still. 

We had a wonderful blue haired gentleman seat us and take our orders. He was quite genial and was great with giving suggestions about what to order. We placed our orders, and were given some bread with olive oil and balsamic vin. It was pretty tasty. 

We got our food and boy was it good! The pizza that I got was AMAZING! It was thin crust (which I usually don't like), but this pizza was top notch. They had fresh parm to put on the dishes as well as three dishes of red peppers. 

I had half my pizza left over for dinner the next night. It was just as good night 2 as it was the first night!

The only reason that I give this place 4 instead of 5 stars was because after we were given our food and asked if we needed anything else, our server disappeared for a while. He finally came back and gave us our check. About 15/20 minutes later, we had all finished our meals and were just antsy to get going, but we couldn't find him...we finally had to go and waive him down. He said he had forgotten we were even back there. 

As pizza was all I tried, that is all I can personally attest to. The people in the group who had the pasta staid that it was good, but nothing to rave about... I would definitely go and have their pizza again!"}
{"text":"Found on yelp and walked from our hotel, The King Edward. Excellent service, food, and ambiance. The pasta was delicious. The pizzas were a perfect thin crust. Great wine selection. Our server was wonderful. We sat in the side room with our kids and it was perfect. Overall, a wonderful experience."}
