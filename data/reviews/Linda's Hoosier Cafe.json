{"text":"I firmly believe everyone is entitled to a \"bad day\", so I'll count this as Linda's Hoosier Cafe's bad day. Went in for breakfast the first time hoping to have the same level of service/food quality at the other place called Hoosier Cafe on Warner. Didn't get even close. 

The goods: Waitress was an absolute sweet heart! Place seemed really tidy and well kept. The prices seem really reasonable. There was a good selection of breakfast \"specials\" posted up front.

The bads: The food took FOREVER to come out. My over medium egg had runny whites. The bacon was thin and nearly flavorless (cheap bacon probably kept too long in a steam table). I love me some bacon, and the fact that I didn't even eat more than 1/2 a piece really says something. My coffee cup went empty several times before I got refills. The syrup served with the pancakes was awful. It was very bland and tasted more like Karo syrup with brown coloring as opposed to maple syrup. I know REAL maple syrup is expensive, and for the price I wouldn't expect it here, but jeez, spend a little more on some higher quality syrup please. Mrs. Butterworth's would have been better.  Even the Tabasco sauce was sub-par. The bottle label was all faded and peeling, making me think this place refills with watered down Tabasco. Is that even possible with the tiny bottle openings?  

All that said, I will go back and give another chance because the waitress was so nice and apologized for the syrup and slowness with the food. I also want to try the B&G.  I think this place could be really good if the management would heed all the negative comments and make some modest changes."}
{"text":"Yelp states this cafe is closed on Sunday, this however is incorrect. The cafe is open, very busy and the servers were hustling. Good breakfast at a good price. Give this place  a try."}
{"text":"I was happy with Hoosiers, very friendly service, diner atmosphere and the food was good.  

I got the chicken fried steak breakfast,  and it tasted homemade.  The gravy had wonderful flavor and the steak was nice and crisp.  The eggs and bacon were standard, and hash browns seemed fresh as well.  I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Had a late breakfast but a few things were not perfect.  Greeted with a wave from the hostess who was seated rolling silverware. Took a few minutes for menus.  Coffee was brought but hubby's question about the types of available  juices was met with a questioning look.  He finally said orange juice but later said he would have preferred apple juice.  He used ice from my water to chill his room temperature glass of juice.
I asked for sugar-free syrup and regular syrup was brought first then replaced. My French Toast came first and Hubby's food came much later and was WRONG.  Waitress had picked up someone else's order.  It went back and a longer wait.  I also specifically asked for for EXTRA CRISPY BACON and it was only \"sort of\" crispy.  Had to also ask for a coffee refill."}
{"text":"Went for dinner with friends, asked me if everything was okay at register I said no and waitress said okay!  I said you don't care?  Her answer was no!  We will never go back there again!  I ordered salad with blue cheese dressing, brought me a 7.49 salad with most lettuce centers and ranch dressing.  My wife ordered fish and fries and the fish was so over cooked it dried out.  She asked for lemon twice before it finally made it to table.  I ordered soup that was horrible. They don't care!  That's a business?  Not from me!"}
{"text":"This place really sucks, they boast of homemade food, I don't think so, Gravy from a package the biscuit was not home made the sausage was not homemade, Eggs were cold and running. And I ordered over med. It was all around a terrible experience will not ever go back.!!!"}
{"text":"Came for the Friday fish & chips. Wait  staff very  nice & friendly.  Fish & chips nothing to write home about. We won't be back. Anyone in Mesa Arizona area who can recommend a good place for fish & chips?"}
{"text":"We ran across this restaurant and though why not. This place does not disappoint! Wow large portions, great prices and wonderful staff. We will come back when we come back to Arizona."}
{"text":"My wife and I spotted it this morning and the sign \"Voted best breakfast in Mesa\" sign on the front.

I was served the worst bacon I have every had in a restaurant.  It had been fried with a meat press and then very overdone so had an oxidized taste. Plus it was cold.  Waitress admitted they fry it in advance and keep it \"warm.\"
Eggs were fine and the additional sausage.
The breakfast included toast OR biscuits and gravy and I don't like biscuits so asked for toast and gravy. Had to pay a small extra for the gravy which was akin to the flour glue I made in grade school. Pure flour and water with a few bits of sausage running in it.  Not real gravy.
It was our first time and our last."}
{"text":"Did the one star  only to write a review. The waitstaff is HORRIBLE they don't bring anything with food. Like syrup or butter for pancakes. No salsa  for breakfast burrito. Bad cream curled in coffee. Half and half is to be refrigerated. We just moved on this side of town. So definitely won't be back . Thanks !"}
{"text":"It's solid, but nothing amazing. If you're in this part of town and need a cheap breakfast, this place fits the bill. I'm not sure what makes the food particularly Indianan? There were pennants from all the Indiana colleges hanging up, so maybe that's it. It was pretty standard breakfast fare geared toward the neighboring snowbird communities."}
{"text":"This place is great! I'm not sure why anyone would say otherwise. The service was fantastic, the food was amazing, and staff seemed to know everyone. I had the Spanish omelet and my fiancé had pancakes. We shared because everything was so good! My two year old had the cheese omelet and ate almost the whole thing. We will defiantly be back!"}
{"text":"Authentic mid-west dining in a clean, friendly atmosphere. The walls are dotted with state school pennants and other Indiana celeb collectables. 

My first visit was right at opening, 6am on Wednesday August 28, 2013. I ordered steak and eggs. Everything was cooked to order and served within 12 minutes, hot and tasty. Service was good. I left a good tip.

I will return! I might obtain a pennant from my school to offer for their collection since I graduated from college in Indiana myself.

{"text":"Went in for fish and chips on a friday, thats what i ordered along with an appetizer of zucchini sticks. The food was horrible all around!"}
{"text":"good service & clean but food was sub par.  we were disappointed & would prefer other cafes in the area over this one.  pancake were OK but potatoes and corn beef hash were dry & flavorless."}
{"text":"Awesome Midwest breakfast food and even better Midwest service! You have to try the home made sausage patty and blueberry pancakes.    Ask for Sharon."}
{"text":"Been passing this place for years and finally stopped. Breakfast was simple and yummy. We'll definitely come back again and again. We had the Spanish omelet and steak burrito. Just the right portion of yumminess.

Prices are good, and the restaurant is very clean."}
{"text":"My experience was not an enjoyable one. I walked in and waited 5 mins to be approached and it was not busy made my order which was very simple breakfast with extra crispy potatoes. The next time I saw the server was when my food was delivered. Was not able to request any condiments for my food because the server disappeared again. The extra crispy potatoes I requested were almost raw. I finally see the server again and ask her if the potatoes looked extra crispy to her. Her reply was I put it on the ticket. No offer to make it right and I paid full price for a meal that was extremely substandard. I will not return and will not recommend this establishment"}
{"text":"Iceberg salad with dry chicken. Not a fan. One meal came noticeably earlier than the rest of the table. Edible food. But not worth paying for."}
{"text":"YUCK! This place is terrible. The food is VERY subpar and the service is not that much better. Waitstaff acted like they were doing me a favor for refilling my tea... Skip this place and head over to one of the other 50 diners in this neighborhood."}
{"text":"Heard about this place and decided to try it this am for breakfast. Arrived around 930am. The sign said to seat ourselves. Place isn't too big and not too many tables available or cleaned off from the previous guests.
They only had 2 waitresses and 1 much older oriental lady busing tables. Appeared to me that she was a family member that was yanked in to help the understaffed diningroom.
We waited 5 min before my husband got up and got us a menu. Then a few more minutes went by before a frantic yet pleasant waitress took our drink order. We got our drinks a few minutes later. We gave her our order when she came back with the drinks. Our meal came about 30 min after we ordered it. Way too long to wait for breakfast. I had the Atkins plate. Eggs Bacon and tomato slices. I also ordered a side of biscuits and gravy. The biscuits and gravy were the only thing that tasted good. The tomatoes were brown on the inside so I sent them back and opted for cottage cheese instead.
The cottage cheese tasted spoiled. The eggs tasted old and bacon was dry as if it had set out for a long time.
Husband had corn beef hash with eggs. He wasn't impressed and he usually likes everything.
So with the service and cook being very slow and the food below average, I give this place a 1 star. I only give a little 1 star because the waitress was friendly."}
{"text":"I have been here at least 3 times total for breakfast. I have never had a bad experience. Food has always been good. Coffee really good. Our waitress was real nice and kept checking back to see if we needed anything. I had the corned beef and hash, eggs, potatoes. All was tasty. The place has a homey feel. Usually the crowd has been quite a bit older, retirement age, but that doesn't bother me. Also my meal was under 10 dollars. I will be back."}
{"text":"Our food did not all come out at once.  Had to repeated ask for refills.  Waited 15 minutes for our check.  Could have walked out without paying.  Had to track down waitress to pay for food that came out warm, not hot."}
{"text":"My Indiana-born boyfriend took me to Hoosier Cafe for breakfast the other day.  The walls are filled with Indiana school pennants, so I'm sure he likes this place in particular because of his roots.  However, the food was really good.  I ordered over-easy eggs, toast, bacon, and a pancake.  It was all cooked to perfection, the bacon was so crispy and delish.  I have a small appetite, but almost licked my plate clean.  He ordered the Spanish Omelet (chorizo, green chiles, onions, tomatoes and cheese) with biscuits and gravy instead of toast.  Yes, you can substitute toast for biscuits and gravy.  He liked his chorizo, though it wasn't quite what he was expecting for the flavor.  He couldn't quite place why, but he would still recommend it.  Our waitress was really nice and gave us plenty of attention, like refills on our drinks before we were completely finished.  The pricing was great; we left with very full bellies and it was less than $20, including a soda.  I would definitely recommend coming here for breakfast/brunch."}
{"text":"We have gone here for Sunday brunch after church. The portions were nice sized and the omelets were good."}
{"text":"My dad and I stopped by this little neighborhood cafe for breakfast and coffee.  The staff was friendly and attentive they kept the coffee flowing. Breakfast was huge and delicious."}
{"text":"I'm from Indiana originally, so I just had to stop by. And like Indiana this place is nothing fancy. It is simple breakfast faire. Nothing unique or crazy going here. You will probably never see any experimental cuisine, but overall it was good and inexpensive. I got a chorizo burrito with salsa and paid about $5.  The problem with chorizo burritos is a little chorizo goes a loooonnnnggg way and I have been overwhelmed by other restaurants' versions; however, the Hoosier Cafe did a fine job of balancing the flavors of potatoes, eggs, and chorizo. The salsa was also delish.

Overall, don't come with grand expectations. This is a simple, kitschy place. But the food was good!  And ultimately, isn't that what you go out for?"}
{"text":"Not all Hoosier Cafe are created equal. We have been regulars at the Hoosier located near Warner and Ray. We love it. So when we saw a Hoosier café while we were running around doing errands, it was a no-brainer to stop and have breakfast. This location is not related to the one in Chandler. I ordered corn beef hash, my wife ordered Spanish omelette. The corn beef hash was an odd, almost pancake looking, it is unlike any other corn beef hash I've ever had. The flavor was OK but there was very little corn beef in it. My wife's Spanish omelette with egg whites tasted like there was a chemical in it. For the side I had biscuits and gravy, I know that a lot of places use package gravy and I'm OK with that. However at Linda's Hoosier Café it had absolutely no flavor. Overall our experience was very unsatisfying. I do have to say that our service was excellent. I would not recommend coming to Linda's Hoosier Café."}
{"text":"The food was just ok and even the fountain drinks were iffy. It was recommended we go there for breakfast and we were very disappointed."}
{"text":"I have eaten here every sunday for 2 years and I love the staff, the food, and the consistent quality of the of good."}
