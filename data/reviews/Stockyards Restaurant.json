{"text":"Ordered open face brisket sand. $13 for tough meat and the meat was difficult to identify under the gallon of super sweet barbecue sauce. My eating partners salad was pretty good though."}
{"text":"Great food! Service can be on the slower side but food has always come out hot and how I ordered it! My new fav steak joint!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!! DON'T GO HERE!!! Worst service I've ever received!!!! Felt extremely discriminated by the staff. Never coming back and telling everyone I know about the terrible service here. If you have to go and get a waitress named Alex, REQUEST A DIFFERENT ONE!!! Extremely rude!!! Such a shame too because the food was good, but the service experience I received had completely ruined my night."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in a town full of chain restaurants.  I have frequented Stockyards over the last 6 months or so.  Most of the times for business lunches---once for dinner.  Service is typically very prompt and courteous- though from time to time when very busy during lunch it is not always exceptional--but always good (hence this 4/5 instead of the 5/5).  I have enjoyed all the items that I have tried---the filet is delicious.  As far as lunch options, I don't think you can beat the grilled chicken sandwich.  Absolutely one of my favorite lunches in town."}
{"text":"Service was very good. The building is very nice.   The filet was cooked properly, but was not the best cut of meat, especially for the price. The part of the steak that was not full of parts I could not chew were ok, but plain ( plain- best word to describe the taste). I'm admittedly a steak snob. I frequent the higher end steak houses from coast to coast and have to say I have eaten at some great places. This food wise on this night was not one of them. The cream spinach was not good. The mashed sweet potatoes was good, as was the salad and dressing.   Doesn't compare with Ruth's Chris, Sullivan's, Del Monaco's, Morton's and not as good as Longhorn."}
{"text":"Stopped here after getting off plane in Phoenix for lunch . What  a great place it is , everything  our   group  had was excellent . Onion rings  , corn bread, sandwiches , soups all top notch. .Place is decorated in old west style with an old time saloon in back for dining  and  drinks also.. Service is great  and people are friendly as well . Will be back for sure"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere but there's lots of room for improvement in the steak department which is ironic considering restaurant name.  I make better, more tender steaks from the local grocery store in my backyard."}
{"text":"On the 4th of March my husband and I had lunch at the Stockyards. I was so disappointed in the plating of my filet. At $26.00 I thought it was outrageous. The food was flopped on the plate with no thought, or imagination. Since then I received a gift card from the owners with an apology. I was not expecting that. So today we visited The Stockyards again and ordered the same meal.  The plating was better and the texture and flavor of the potatoes were better but only after I added butter to them. Also, ordered a dinner salad that was very diverse with greens, cucumbers and tomatoes, really good! The filet, again, was exceptional. The vegetables were also very nice in flavor and texture. When I go back again I think I will forgo the mashed potatoes and order a different side dish, which I wasn't told about the last time.   My husband ordered a prime rib sandwich on marbled rye, $16.00 but he said it was the best he ever had!   I can not say enough about the waiter. He was very prompt, polite and thoughtful. Thank you for the excellent service."}
{"text":"I was so looking forward to going to Stockyards.  I picked the Hubby up a the airport and off we where for a great dinner.  The staff was great , infact everything was really nice.  The Ceasar salad was great, my husbands filet and rice was really good.  I choose the prime rib which flavor wise was terrific, but so tough I couldn't chew it enough to swallow it.  I HATE complaining about food/or sending back, but I really couldn't eat this.... So they quickly brought me another piece, but guessing it was just another slice off the same piece of meat because it to was extremely tough.  I don't want to make it sound like you shouldn't go there, everything about the place was a good experience except my main course...it happens.  They gave us a dessert on the house and we called it good."}
{"text":"The service was great. (Alice) our waitress was really helpful and gave us what we needed. The food was good. Buffalo meatloaf was tasty, chicken was good. Vegetables were a little garlicky."}
{"text":"My husband and I had the pleasure of dining here last night. We arrived a little before our 5:00 dinner reservation and were seated within minutes. The up front staff were very friendly. The restaurant had just opened for the evening and as we entered the dining area it exceeded my expectations. Every table set pristinely, the lighting perfect. Our server came over promptly and almost immediately after taking our drink order our veggie and bread basket arrived. These were delicious. Corn muffins, homemade ranch for the veggies, but we knew not to fill up too much on these. Our server recommends to us the wild boar and venison sausage which my husband couldn't pass up. They were delicious and the cinnamon apple chutney compliments them perfectly. I ordered the filet and my husband got the prime rib. We were both in food heaven. The filet just melted in my mouth, it was perfectly cooked and season and my knife just went right through. My husband loves prime rib and usually orders it whenever he has the opportunity. He said this was the best prime rib of his life.   The service was flawless. We are both sticklers for service and this place delivered the best we've had in quite a while. Every dish or drink hit the table what seemed like immediately after we ordered it. And you would finish and lay your fork down and boom a buser would appear and ask to clear your plate. Go to the restroom and our server would come and fold your napkin up like brand new. Our server was also great when talking about the rich history of the restaurant and explaining the different items on the menu. I would ask for a recommendation and she would respond no hesitation with definitive answers, I like that. It tells me that she knows what she's serving and she feels confident.   We were here for my husbands birthday, it was s great place for this special occasion, I don't think that it is a place for children of any age younger than 14."}
{"text":"I love the name of this restaurant!  Stockyards.  Stock-Yards.  So, far, none of the reviews of this restaurant that I have read mention its name.  Why not?  Are the reviewers afraid?  I'm not going to judge.  Stock-------Yards!    Although I've never been to this restaurant, I believe, because of its name (as I mentioned before) and based on all of the great reviews on Yelp, it should get a good rating.  5 Stars!"}
{"text":"Went there for a business lunch and was very impressed.  They got us seated right away even though the parking lot was completely full.  It appeared to be a very popular business lunch location due to its location.  Our waiter was efficient but I did not feel rushed.  The atmosphere matched the menu.  The steak was outstanding and the portions were adequate for a lunch time meal.  Everyone at the table enjoyed their selection as I did."}
{"text":"Food was ok, Atmosphere was ok.  However our waiter had a big table sat concurrently with ours and we got the short end of the stick.  Service was mediocre - we sat with dirty plates in front of us, needed to beg for more water, and were pretty much ignored.  It took forever to get the bottle of wine we ordered.  My husband & I worked in restaurants for many years, and we have a lot of sympathy for wait staff stretched between tables - but this guy didn't even try.  Nor did his assistant waiter/bus person make much of an effort."}
{"text":"Had the 16 oz prime rib. It was delicious. The service was attentive even if the restaurant was fairly full for lunch. Will definitely go back"}
{"text":"The 3 stars reflects the good service more than the food. We went here based on the reviews of the restaurant having great steaks & prime rib. To be honest, we didn't find the steaks or prime rib to be exceptional at all. Very average compared to other steakhouses we've been to all over the country, big chains included. They bring out veggies with ranch dip & warm baking soda rolls while you look at the menu. I was happy about veggies since I'm GF. Salads (house & Caesar) were fine - nothing special. My husband wanted a Cabernet with dinner. The server brought out one for him to try. He didn't like it, so she brought out a second one that he did like. I've not seen that before for a single glass of wine. Very classy. When our food came out me husband's steak was overdone & he had to send it back. My prime rib & my son's steak were cooked fine, so we ate while my husband waited for his dinner. For dessert, the guys shared a piece of pecan pie which they said was very good & I had the cheesecake which was very smooth & creamy. They comped our dessert because of husband's steak. The atmosphere is okay. Kind of an upscale coffee shop almost, but a touch better. I wouldn't return or recommend to anyone. There are better steakhouses in the area."}
{"text":"Received a recommendation from the hotel. What a refreshing experience from all of the chain steak houses (maybe this place is a small chain, don't know). I think the original Cartwrights work here, Hoss was our waiter! The steaks were great, decent wine list; affordable and tasty. The only quirky thing and I'm sure it was a one time thing, but my boss and I each ordered wedge salads, and Hoss came back and told us they were out. Running out of prime rib or 48 oz porterhouse, but a head of lettuce? Great service as well. Will possibly return, but I'll brown bag my head of lettuce."}
{"text":"This place is FANTASTIC.  It is our favorite place to celebrate our anniversary, and anything else we can think of.  Our first visit was during Restaurant Week several years ago.  We were treated as well as any of the other diners, the service AMAZING, and the food FANTASTIC.  That experience has led us to return, over and over.  Our last anniversary (our 4th celebrated at the Stockyards) was no exception!  While the new doors aren't as impressive as the old solid copper clad ones (sorry guys!) nothing else has changed.    The service is impeccable.  We have never had less than an amazing experience here and it is all thanks to the staff. I love that we are greeted by name, everyone wishes us a happy anniversary, and everything is always on the ball.  Between that and the food - you'll keep coming back!  The food is just wonderful.  We usually have Prime Rib, but I have enjoyed the Wild West Mixed Grill, which consists of Elk Medallions, Walleyed Pike and Wild Boar Venison Sausage.  All DELICIOUS.  The Steak Soup is fantastic.  I could happily eat it every day for lunch and dinner!  My Prime Rib is always cooked exactly as I order.  The Chocolate Mousse is my personal go-to dessert, and it goes fantastically with the Ice Wine on the menu.  My husband has enjoyed the Sorbet Trio and Sour Cream Cheesecake desserts.   While this place isn't the least expensive meal, it is worth it. I do not recommend bringing children.  This is a fancy, adult place.  Be sure to turn off your ringtones and use your indoor voice - this place deserves it!  My only detraction is the decor, which is dated.  I'd love to see the art be rotated out with some local art - photographs and paintings from local artists in the southwestern theme.  It'd be nice to see the art rotate in and out with the seasons perhaps.  Otherwise, there is nothing bad I can say about this place, and that is more a personal preference anyway.    TL:DR - go here.  Celebrate.  Eat delicious food and enjoy!  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing the food is phenomenal always taste great. The staff is friendly and always strive to make each visit better than the last. I always tell my friends to come here if they want the best steaks in Arizona."}
{"text":"I love love love it. You have to check it out. Food and service is 5 star all the way!!!!! Bison steak is a must have."}
{"text":"I have had better steaks at Quincys when I was a kid. Ordered Prime Rib and after it twice came cold they attempted to charge me. No water, no bread, pathetic service. Overall horrible experience."}
{"text":"Writing this review breaks my heart.  Multiple generations of my family have come here; my grandfather brought my dad as a young boy when in Phoenix for business in the '30s (with cattle all around back then); all of us kids had our 16th birthday in the Pink Room; my uncle would visit from dry SLC and my dad would treat him to martinis and dinner at Stockyards; it was the place for serious dates, the place we unanimously chose to go for dinner when we were all home, and so many good times.  When Tom and his crew took it over back in the 90s, he essentially left its classics alone. For lunch you could have a burger or orgasmic BBQ beef sandwich to die for; for dinner you could surf and turf and enjoy yourself more than you could at the high rent district places. Oh, the biscuits and  what we called \"crack honey butter\" - one died and went to heaven, it was so good.  Then it closed for renovations - much needed and overdue; the electrical was shaky back then, part of its charm - and everyone I know looked forward to its reopening.  They killed it. The look was the same, but the food.. oh no. My dad was in mourning for months. I tried it again several months later - same thing. Tried it with husband some months after that.. same thing. I was even there in February (2011) after over a year of absence, and if anything, the menu got more trendy and more cutesy and more expensive. So much for my birthday treat to myself. So you see, I want to come back, but they killed the perfection of simpler, tasty, perfectly prepared meals in favor of the rare, the trendy, and the expensive.  Prickly pear butter? Jalapenos in the cornbread? While the steaks are fine, all the cutesy crap on the menu seems to me as if they're trying to attract tourists a la Scottsdale... what a travesty. It's not just an long-time patron and family lamenting the old days; it's the truth.   It can't be explained by being screwed by the light rail line or \"changing tastes.\" It's called they want to attract the business, moneyed and trendy crowds and that's the reason why you'd better bring your platinum card here.  If an edgy, expensive steakhouse is what you're looking for, this is it. If not, go to Morton's for the money."}
{"text":"I like steak. After wanting to try this place for years, I had the open face steak sandwich yesterday for lunch. When it arrived I thought ok, I'm taking half of this home. Yeah, right, good luck with that one Anne ol' girl, as I licked the last of the juices off my plate. Onion rings, slaw, pickle...all good but a waste of stomach space compared to the meat. My associates both had the prime rib sandwich and loved it.  The atmosphere is completely old school, and the crowd was mostly men who, from the sounds of the conversation, are in the construction/mining/manufacturing/heavy equipment industries. I can't wait to go back for dinner - maybe take the light rail."}
{"text":"Yum, can you say great steak?  This is another of my father's favorite haunts after the car races at Manzanita.  Back in his day they did not serve alcohol and he and his racing cronies would bring their own bottles. My first trip here was over 40 years ago when they still had the stockyards next door.  Worst imaginable smell in the world greeted my nostrils when we got out of the car and rushed inside.  Once inside the only aroma was that of sizzling steak.  The stockyards are long gone but the steaks are still there."}
{"text":"All in all a pretty good establishment. Their Steaks are above average but are on the pricier side. My biggest issue was being charged $32.00 for a double Single Barrel Jack Daniels. Had I known ahead of time how much they were going to charge I wouldn't have ordered it.  It certainly spoiled my experience there and I will look elsewhere next time I'm out for steak or taking a customer out for a business dinner."}
{"text":"The decor and atmosphere captured me immediately and I knew I had selected the correct restaurant for the evening. The menu has everything you would expect from a solid steakhouse. We ordered the grilled liver and the meatloaf, both were very good. Under the heading of excellent was the strawberry shortcake. So very authentic and delicious. The best of the evening however was our amazing server. Parker cheered us immensely. We were low and she really picked us up. She is a wonderful representative for Stockyards restaurant."}
{"text":"We've lived in TVoTS for over 8 years and passed by Stockyards a lot. It was just not a time to dine. Today my wife and I decided on an early dinner. Our son had given us a holiday gift of a top-of-the-line steak house. Funny...we were looking for it and passed it right by about 4:10pm. A U-turn and a very slow speed did the trick. However we thought it was out of business. The parking lot was void of cars and not a human was in sight. I decided to call because so many restaurants have closed all over the area. Bingo! They just do happen to open at 5pm. No biggie. We ran an errand and the few moments didn't seem that long. The staff was friendly and the decor was perfect. Our meals were served as ordered. And a great 5stars was awarded because they serve milk....real regular milk for the great coffee after the meal, not the watered down 1%, 2%, skim, fat free stuff. Ugh. The mashed sweet potatoes and the mushroom side were absolutely mouth watering. Be careful of the pecan pie, though. I don't mean taste wise. It was served hellish hot and almost burned my tongue. We always chill our pecan pie. Notwithstanding that hit surprise, it was one of the best we have ever had. We highly recommend the Stockyards. It is a bit overpriced, though. Kudos to our waiter and those who bussed the tables. Our water glass was refilled without our even knowing that. How do they do that? Go...make a reservation and enjoy."}
{"text":"Excellent food  excellent service.  It was a bit more expensive than their online menu shows. But it was already pricey. Good portions of food but we were not overstuffed. Had the chateaubriand. Yum!!!   Really lovely interior"}
{"text":"Wow, where do I start?  Stockyards is an absolute SH*TSHOW of a restaurant.  There, I guess that's as good a start as any.  I've been to restaurants where I spent double what I spent at Stockyards ($130 including tax+tip) and thought the meal was worth every penny.  I don't mind paying good money for dinner, as long as I get a good meal and a quality experience.  Obviously by the 1-star rating, you'll get neither/nor at Stockyards.  First, let me commend the service.  From the hostess to the server to the assistants, the entire staff was first-rate -- polite and welcoming, attentive without being intrusive.  They were awesome, which is why I almost hate to write such a negative review.  As nice as everyone was, in the end you go to a restaurant for the food, and the sh*tshow came from the kitchen.  First the munchies, bread & butter and a crudité plate.  The bread basket contained biscuits and jalapeno corn bread.  Both were OK, maybe a bit dry, but I get that it's the desert and baked goods dry out quickly - dry doesn't mean stale in places like Arizona.  The veggies in the crudité were a bit tired looking.  The ranch dressing that came with it had to have come from a bottle.  I splurged a bit and got the most expensive appetizer, the seafood gratin -- lobster (although I couldn't find any), shrimp and scallops baked in a garlic cream sauce, served with garlic toast.  The shrimp and scallops (and the ever elusive lobster) had to be frozen.  I could almost see the sous-chef cutting open a plastic bag and dumping frozen chunks of seafood into the microwave to thaw.  If the garlic cream sauce wasn't Prego, then it was a remarkably close approximation.  Frozen seafood and sauce out of a jar for 24 bucks.  Can you understand why I'm pissed off??  I ordered the elk medallions because I love good venison, and an elk aficionado once told me that elk was even better.  The elk wasn't gamey, but it wasn't much of anything, really.  On its own, it didn't have much flavor.  The kitchen did try to drown it in a ghastly juniper-something sauce, which tasted like brown gravy out of a jar (again with the jars!) plus a few spices thrown in.  They were served with chive potato cakes that were so salty that one bite easily doubled my BP.  It also came with carrots and string beans, and in all fairness, the string beans actually tasted fresh.  They were probably the only part of the meal that did not come out of  a plastic bag, a can, or a jar.  I asked for the salad (included with the entrée) after the meal, dressing on the side.  It came out drowning in dressing.  There was so much Thousand Island in my salad bowl I half-expected to see a little plastic Titanic capsized and adrift.  I tried to redeem the meal with dessert, which can often salvage, at least in part, a bad meal because I have a wicked sweet tooth.  The pecan pie was decent, but no better than the little pecan tarts at Starbucks.  The Starbucks pecan tarts actually have a better crust.  The Stockyards' pie crust tasted like they bought it frozen (like every other bleepin' ingredient on the menu).  I don't eat at places like Friday's, Bennigan's, or Applebee's because it's all reheated frozen food.  But in fairness to those establishments, the fare is priced accordingly.  My problem with Stockyards is that it's far pricier than Friday's et al, yet it's still cuisine from a freezer bag, a can, or a jar.  Save your money and go to a REAL steakhouse (I went to J&G's the next night, spent far more, and LOVED it), or go to Outback, where you'll get the same out-of-a-jar/can/freezer bag sh*tshow, but at least the check is half what you'd spend at Stockyards.  PS: I almost never click the link to share my reviews on Facebook (not what I use Facebook for), but I will with this review because as many people as possible need to be warned about what a complete waste of time and money Stockyards is."}
{"text":"Dinner on a Friday night.   Our first visit to the Stockyards restaurant and we were happy with everything. The place has the feeling of a hundred years old supper club because thats what it is.  The prime rib my wife ordered was first rate, butter knife tender and well seasoned. My ribeye was cooked as ordered, seasoned and flavorful. Just not a tender as the prime rib.  They have a buffalo ribeye on the menu that I'll try next time. Service was great. Our server was helpful with the menu, professional and just chatty enough. Share a pecan pie and coffee for desert."}
{"text":"I took a party of 7 here on NY Eve, 2017.  Admittedly, we made the reservation at the last minute, although that shouldn't have made any difference.  Our server was attentive and pleasant and did reasonably good job of explaining all the various menu choices.  I want to say up front, it was good. NOT great.  I had the $50 cut of Prime Rib and there was a lot of inedible gristle and fat in it. In addition, our server had made a mistake on my order and at first brought out the small cut, and had to return it to the kitchen for the correct order.    The taste was OK, again, not great.  Two of the kids had the filet, and it was GREAT.  I would have it next time.  The stacked potatoes/parmesan were quite salty.  Two of our guests had bison, and enjoyed it.  I just don't think it was remarkable, and the final price tag of over $500 (including a bottle of champagne) would prevent me from choosing it again.  IF I did go, it would be the filet for sure! For that much money I expected more."}
{"text":"I went last night (Mon, Feb 8, 2016) with 2 friends.  They had a large party in the dining room which was quite noisy, so we sat in the saloon area which was far quieter.  The hostess showed me the way to the saloon prior to my guests arriving to ensure I would like that area.    We were served by Henry, the bartender and he was perfectly attentive to our needs. My guests got a porterhouse and the liver.  He enjoyed the porterhouse quite a bit.  She did not finish the liver.   I got the \"famous\" prime rib.  Barely any flavor (although the au jus was decent albeit a little saltier than I prefer), and not tender like I would expect for a $30 \"prime rib\".  It looks like they actually used a lower grade standing rib roast and called it a \"prime\" to justify the higher cost.  I didn't have to saw through it with the steak knife, but found it to be much tougher than better quality meals...    I hate to say it, but I've had much better quality products from Outback.  I see many people rave about their food, but this was a massive fail for my side.   I brought 1/2 of it home, and am not sure if I will eat the rest or feed it to the neighbor's dog.  I will say, $32.00 for a double shot of a medium quality blended scotch (that's the cost of a full bottle) was pretty ridiculous. If it was a higher end single malt it would have been a different story.   On a positive note, their complimentary muffins were enjoyable, and their small relish dish with bottled Ranch dressing a nice appetizer.   Did I mention that Henry gave us really nice service?"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I ate here in 2012. We both took violently I'll within 12 hours. We alerted the manager in person, via phone call from both of us and in writing via email. Their response was one of denial, lack of empathy and a complete disregard for customer service. We notified them not to finger point but out of public health concern and Casey the manager was put off by this. She stated \"do what you need to do to make yourself feel better\". I caution you to eat here, they may make you sick. They don't care about their customers,  suggest try another steak place."}
{"text":"Easily best choice and much worth the commute for this place. Undoubtedly the best steak in AZ and best chowder."}
{"text":"Decent food but certainly not worth the prices. Dry rolls and muffins, thin cuts of meat and nothing special about any of it."}
{"text":"Great place for date night with the right atmosphere and wine selection. Waitress was super friendly and the food was great. Way overpriced but we knew that going in."}
{"text":"Excellent ! Steak is very tender and flavorful ! Bring your wallet but worth it ! Very popular, gotta have a reservation. Must try !"}
{"text":"I want to start off with saying that everytime I drove by stockyards and saw that giant bull/cow on the top of the big, plain, white building, I always imagined it being a casual steakhouse with straw or peanut shells on the ground.   It's totally not.  It is like a rich Texan's house inside.  Cow rug, leather, old cowboy photos on the wall.  So the ambiance inside is totally nice and upscale-cowboy feel.  got sat in the main dining room and I also want to add like I felt like the place was \"dusty\" I don't know why, or what made me feel this way, but \"dusty\" was what I got from the place.  I ordered a half slab of ribs with garlic potatoes and a salad. So- my ribs were just \"okay\" and my potatoes were SUPER SUPER garlic-ey and it was weird how they were plated.  They came out like in a square shaped form of scalloped potatoes.  Like my mom makes potatoes and squares my piece out for me sort of square.  The square was small, but actually I didn't even like the potatoes so that did not bother me too much.  OH! and \"cole-slaw\" my other side I ordered was \"cole-slaw\". Notice how I put \" \" around this word \"cole-slaw\".  I do that because it wasn't cole-slaw AT ALL!?!?!? It was literally just shredded up dry cabbage!?!??! So... yeah, didn't eat the slaw.  their famour bar that is completely hand carved and the murals on the walls are hand-painted and restored from like the 1900's so the bar was very cool.   Go for a drink at the bar.  I wouldn't do dinner again."}
{"text":"Big fan of unique steakhouses across the country and this one joins the club!  First of all the Wild Boar and Venison sausages as a starter with chutney were full of flavour and so delicious.  The Buffalo Rib-eye may be a bit pricey but come-on, when is the next time you can complete the Boar-Deer-Buffalo Trifecta in one sitting??  The Buff rib-eye is full of deep, rich flavors and worth every penny....Service was excellent and the whole experience was a delight  - will return!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal. Seriously phenomenal. In the last year I've been completely let down (and won't go back) to Ruth's Criss, Flemings made it right, but had to send a steak back on our last visit... Etc.   Better flavor (less salty etc) than Flemings, durant's, Criss et. al. This is seriously my new favorite. The boar and venison sausage appetizer was phenomenal and a great suggestion by our waiter. The steaks were perfect (always over cooked when we go out, but not here), they believed me when I said rare. The mushroom soup was silly how good it was.  Now it isn't cheap, but for the quality... Well worth it. Appetizer, multiple drinks/wine, and she had a fillet and added a lobster tail/me the ribeye; all for $150? (Plus tip) that is a steal for special occasions. Do yourself a favor. I have to reevaluate my \"5 star\" review quality now! There is a new standard."}
{"text":"This is THE best place to get your steak, fish and even burger fix!  They are all melt-in-your mouth amazing. My favorite dish to order while enjoying happy hour in the bar is filet bites and a ceasar salad, and while in the dining room I thoroughly enjoy the prime rib with mashed potatoes.   The wait staff is courteous and efficient. I have dined here several times and they never disappoint.   Stockyards is my husband's and my favorite place to go for date night. It is also a fav for starting girls night out!  You can't beat the free happy hour food with a cold adult beverage.   Do yourself a favor and experience this historic steakhouse and it's amazing food and drink!"}
{"text":"Great old school resturant! AZ Local thru and thru, notice how any review that is negative plugs a resturant that is claims to compete. From my experience The Stockyards is exactly what it claims to be a  Historical Prime Grade Steakhouse.   Ive been eating there for years and the food has never let me down, and if something was not as it should the staff bent over backwards to remedy the situation, ie steak temp over and dining with guests and the server offered prime rib at same temp so that I could dine with my guests and threw in desert to boot!  As the resturant goes back to 1947 and my patronage goes back over 30years I can testify to the old school approach to steak that doesnt require foo-foo pitches or explanations of gluten free options! If you are looking for a great meat and potatoes meal with soda biscuts and relish tray and salad or soup to boot, do yourself a favor have lunch or dinner there and try to call me a liar!"}
{"text":"This restaurant-saloon combo enjoys a location very near to Tovrea Castle, my favorite Phoenix landmark. So close are they, in fact, that if you handed the pigskin to a good college football player, he could throw it and hit the Castle from the restaurant's parking lot. The restaurant's décor and old-west ambience also deserve high marks, as does the staff.  Why, then, am I giving this place such a low score? Quite simply, the food is subpar. My companion met me in the saloon, where we sampled their sliders. Verdict: passable. Then we moved to the restaurant for the main meal. The pork porterhouse that I ordered was so bland as to border on the insipid. The shredded seasonal vegetables I ordered were unidentifiable, either by sight or by taste (we finally guessed that it was squash). My dinner companion's 8-oz tenderfoot tasted much better than my pork did, but I regularly cook better at home. The meal had one high point: my companion's side of sweet potatoes was quite good.  How much did this second-rate meal cost? After tax, $84.16. When one adds in the tip for the service, the total came to just under $100. If paying $100 for a subpar supper is your idea of a good time, then this is the place for you, partner!"}
{"text":"Had the 20 oz bone in Bison with scalloped potato. Cooked perfect. Everything was awesome. Great wait staff.  Food is worth the $$. Yummy."}
{"text":"Lunch visit, service was 5 star by our waiter Bob, great sense of humor. Food was excellent, hot and fresh. Onion rings were excellent. We all had different entrees and each one was out standing. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Went to dinner with 5 other people and we left disappointed. Service was not what you would expect at these prices. The food was just ok. About half of the items were over cooked. Sides also were unimpressive. Maybe it was just a bad night for them, but not even close to the standards I would expect for what they charged."}
{"text":"This is a place for business people not for a romantic evening.  If you are on the way to the airport after closing a deal somewhere in the valley, definitely come here.  The lights are turned up and the tables are full of business people loudly recounting their work stories.  Its also down the street from a brightly lit gentlemens club which doesn't scream classy neighborhood.  But, the food is top notch and the service is very personal and friendly.  I think our server really set this place apart from other great steak houses.  This place is not stuffy at all and that came through in fun and casual staff.  It is very good I will come again.  4 stars only because we were here for a quiet date and this wasn't really that type of place."}
{"text":"In town for business. Judged this restaurant from their yelp review. Was not steered wrong. If you are in the mood for steak stockyards is the place to go. Went with 12 coworkers and everyone left extremely satisfied"}
{"text":"Stopped over to Stockyard for dinner. Did not know about this place and I am not from the area, but thank the food gods for yelp and the yelpers who helped direct me here. A little on the pricey side, but if it is good...it's totally worth it. In the end, the place did not disappoint.  Pros: 1. Steak was cooked perfectly, I asked Medium and I got Medium. 2. The bread was very good. Can't go wrong with biscuits and cornbread. 3. Excellent service. 4. Along with the bread they had veggies at the table, which always a plus! 5. The steak actually came with two sides. Up in the Northeast you almost never see that.  Cons: 1. Pricey, but what steak house isn't  From what I gather the place has been around a long time, and if they keep pumping out food and service like they did when I was there I will keep coming back next time I am in the Pheonix area. Enjoy yelpers!"}
{"text":"Thought I would try a different steak house so, I went here what a mistake!! I love wine and the wine list didn't hold up to the price of the steak. Not enough selection of big reds. Lets talk service server looked at me like I was crazy when I asked for my steak med.rare plus this IS a steak house right? This Mansgaers whom I never meet during my dinner should also try to teach TABLE MAINTENANCE I HAD TO PUSH MY DIRTY DISHES TO THE END OF THE TABLE. Much more happen so take my advice go down 44th street to camelback road to the many steak houses down the steet. Steak 44 is 44th and camelback,go west to Donovan's They have a walk in wine celler and a GREAT wine list' DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!!"}
{"text":"Excellent steak, salad, baked potatoe and Harry made one the best old fashions 8 have had in years!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Restaurant! Excellent atmosphere... less casual than dressy but not entirely dressy. Polo and Khakis is prevalent. A dress shirt and dress pants is about the end point for the dress code.  Excellent place to hold dinner conversation as it's not noisy.  Excellent menu choices. The made a great Filet for me. Even the Baseball Sirloin looks good. This place isn't meant to be a get in/get out eatery. You go here so that you can enjoy a good time with some friends or business associates over dinner."}
{"text":"Now, my 5 stars is solely from one lunch there, but it couldn't be beat.  Their signature \"Maverick\" burger is one of the best burgers I've ever had.  Complement it with some fries and potato salad, you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Pretty good meal. Loved the local beer: Sonoran Amber Ale on tap. When I tried to buy it at a nearby liquor store, I was told Sonoran doesn't bottle much beer.  Casual dining- waiters in pressed white button downs and dark jeans. Super friendly and attentive staff.  Loved the corn bread and butter, but the biscuit was just ok. Loved the fresh veggie plate!! I ordered the potato soup and it was the hit of the meal.  My steak came to the table ill prepared. The waiter recognized it and sent it back for a new one without making me feel like I was at fault. I ordered the stacked potatoes but wish I hadn't. They weren't great. Overall, nice experience. There is a separate bar area, too, made of mahogany with murals."}
{"text":"The Stockyards is an iconic Phoenix restaurant I've always wanted to visit.  The service was mediocre at best with a persnickety waiter who presented himself ineffectively, somewhere between \"howdy tex\" and \"bon appetite\", it didn't work.  When asked if grilled chicken could be put on a salad the answer was \"we don't do that\".  I showed the waiter the bottom of my wine glass was half sediment and he did nothing, didn't even acknowledge it.  The food was sub par and, for the money, I'd go to one of the other top shelf steak houses in town.  The Stockyards appears to have become a tourist trap and was disappointing to say the least."}
{"text":"Was  here today with my Red Hat group.  The food was good and the staff attentive. Prices were very reasonable.  Our waiter was courteous except for the condescending phrase to our oldest member \"what would you like young lady\".    Why do young people say that?   Older people really are offended by that phrase.    We know we are not young, why say it?    Loved the dark wood and the fact that the restaurant has been there for so long....makes you feel as if you were part of Phoenix history."}
{"text":"This place was awesome. I don't eat red meat but do eat seafood, so I had a shrimp Cesar salad and is was probably one of the best I've had... Huge shrimp cooked perfectly! The bread rolls/biscuits they give you in the beginning are out of this world... will be thinking about this food until I go back! Great place. Glad I was told about it!"}
{"text":"What a beautiful building.   The bar is gorgeous with a nostalgic feeling for the good ole days.  The shrimp cocktail was good and the 5oz filet was well executed. A little pricey for what you get but still a good option.  Cheers"}
{"text":"A great place for something new in the steak world and meat world. The boar and venison sausage was awesome and the elk and porterhouse was cooked to perfection and it was a great dinner for our time in AZ."}
{"text":"Service was terrible my husband and I went with another couple and his wife ordered a steak that should have been cooked med rare when she received her steak it was more like med well and when she advised our server his response to her was could you do me a favor and cut your steak down the middle ummm excuse me?! Then we waited a good 45 min for her next steak which was rare NOT medium rare and when she advised him once again that her steak was not cooked the way she wanted he argued with her and eneded with what would you like me to do box it up so you can take it home and cook it to your liking?! HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE!! And in all this the manager came to our table just to let us know she took it off the check no apology or offer to order her something to hold her over while she waits for her food to be cooked correctly. SAVE YOUR MONEY!"}
{"text":"Wonderful Pinot Noir. The prime rib is to die for. All steaks are great !! Service is pretty good, very friendly staff. It's a great experience for us."}
{"text":"Loved this restaurant. It felt historic yet well maintained and upscale yet had a nice western ambiance. Superb top notch service and the food is deelish! We of course opted for steaks, I went with my go-to (rib eye cooked medium rare). It was juicy and tender and very flavorful.   The bar area is awesome, like an old fancy saloon. It's spacious and great place to wait and have a drink while waiting for a table or for an after dinner cocktail. I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Very nice upscale steakhouse. Very rich in AZ history. So we had a big family group here to celebrate a special event. We enjoyed wonderful service and were treated so very well. Our waiter was great - very attentive and he made the evening really fun. They even had food to satisfy a picky 4 year old (PB&J)! Good wine selection too.  Within my group we had a variety of apps, steaks, ribs, and prime rib. Everyone walked away very satisfied. I ordered my prime rib medium rare - but next time I'd order a medium - it was really pink - which is unusual. But I was hungry so I ate it all up!  Typical prices for an upscale Phoenix restaurant - the bill for the 12 of us was almost as much as my monthly rent (I wasn't paying).  But we ate good - and drank some really good wine. Too full for dessert tho.   I must comment on the strange location - more of a office building/warehouse neighborhood than where I'd expect an upscale restaurant.  I was surprised that it wasn't busier for a Saturday evening and I am more surprised that more people don't know about the Stockyards for a really good celebration type restaurant.  Well now you know- go eat some steak!"}
{"text":"Stockyards has unique clientale. Being out in Scottsdale & limited hours, most of the visitors are locals and out of town guests.  Had the Grilled Chopped Steak. Huge serving of steak spread over a bed of mashed potatoes. The chopped steak was chopped but yet presented as if it were still 1 large patty. The meat was still moist and had good texture.  Dessert - brownie a la mode. The rich, chocolate brownie was made just right. Not burnt that you see at most chain restaurants. The brownie was warm but not hot that it melted the ice cream.  Overall, I'm a fan and would visit here again."}
{"text":"A long anticipated return visit to this Phoenix landmark after a 10 yr absence met or exceeded all of our expectations.  Some of the best prime rib that I've had in a long time.  Seating was prompt, service was really good and the food quality and portions were outstanding. This is an authentic steak house and not some hipster pop-up. A meal at the Stockyards should be on any bucket list when visiting the Phoenix area!"}
{"text":"I'm torn while writing this review. The staff was very professional and friendly during our visit, so I hate to give a low review to good people and a really neat establishment. The CHEF(s) earned this review for the restaurant.  A good friend and I are currently on a mission for the valley's best burger. Lately we have been going to high end steakhouses to see how they measure up. One of his coworkers raved about Stockyards and how they grind their meat after you order the burger. It doesn't get anymore fresh than that. Or so we thought.  I agree it's a little weird to order burgers at dinner time from a steakhouse, but every time we tried to go during lunch it was a holiday. The waiter wasn't too excited about recommending the burgers, but we went ahead with the two burgers **Medium Rare** and added bacon/avocado.  The bread basket was superb, as were the complimentary veggies and ranch. The smoked chicken soup that came with the burger and fries was very good. The Stella's were fresh. But the burgers came well done, and well, well done. It was shocking I must admit, but an easy fix the second time around, right? WRONG. After a maybe 6-8 minute wait, fresh bacon burgers came out. WELL DONE + , again. Grrrrr. Bland meat, no taste, no juice, no grease/moisture.  At this point the manager had apologized multiple times and offered us free beers and burgers which she didn't have to do, so I respected that part of the embarrassment of a meal. Maybe even worse than the fact that the chef cannot cook a burger to order was the meat itself. As we drove away we decided that the patties seemed like they were boiled in water (if that's possible)- which may have explained why they had no redness and they couldn't drip a drop of grease/juice.  They ended up taking care of everything which was nice. Altogether it was a trek into Phoenix that left us very disappointed, embarrassed for the restaurant, and unwilling to come back to take the chance next time for a nicer steak dinner."}
{"text":"Very expensive, but well worth it. The wine, apps, and the steaks were perfect. In towm for business, heard about this place, hoped I'd found a decent steakhouse. Exceeded my expectations. Our waitress really knew her stuff. Will definitely be back for more, cant beat good food and great service with it!"}
{"text":"Always wanted to Come here and so glad we did.  Great food, environment and great service.  I"}
{"text":"I came here with two of my work colleagues while on a business trip. We had been researching nice steakhouses and saw plenty of raving reviews for this place. We were not impressed.   Right off the bat, our waiter seemed to be annoyed with us. I don't know why, the place was empty on a Tuesday night, but I presumed because of our age (all about 25), he might have thought we would not tip well. I am only making assumptions though. Since I always leave at least a standard 20% tip, I had a very hard time giving our server that. I did though due to my guilt and not wanting to be hated, but my colleagues I was dining with all gave me a hard time for leaving such a decent tip. The couple of busboys who came out with the bread baskets & water, on the other hand, had a lovely attitude. I hope they got some tip share with what I left our server.  Prices are reasonable as far as this type of steakhouse goes, but not worth the price. I ordered a NY strip steak which was pretty flavorless. I ordered medium rare, and it was just not juicy at all. Our server did not even have us cut into our steaks and ask how they were. I would have expected that at a place like this. I have had a much juicier and flavorful steak at much more casual, chain steakhouses.   With the steak you get a choice of a couple of the sides (not the exhaustive sides list). I asked if I could get a different side and the server told me there would be an upgrade charge. Fine I said, thinking it would be like a differential amount, but not the full price of the side. Sure enough, when I got my bill I was charged the full amount for the side. So I paid for my additional side, but didn't get a side which I was entitled to with my meal. It would have been lovely if he would have told me to get one of the included sides as well if I was going to be paying full price for the side I picked. Speaking of this side, the creamed spinach, this was definitely the highlight of my meal. Well lies, my glass of Malbec was the best part. The creamed spinach was the second. The third most delicious part of the meal was the jicama on the raw veggie plate they bring to each table as a starter.   The others in my party were equally unimpressed. As we were here on business, we had been saving up our dinner budgets for a few nights to come here and left disappointed."}
{"text":"My sister and I chose this place based purely on its rich history - it's been around forever.  The hospitality was great, and unlike other stuffy steakhouses, I preferred the light airiness to the restaurant.  I had 12oz ribeye. It comes with either a soup/salad - I had their delicious seafood chowder -  as well as a side - I chose their loaded baked potato.  A steak is a steak is a steak, but here at Stockyards, they make a mighty good steak. It's so tender, juicy, and flavorful and that you don't need any sort of condiment to offset the flavor of the meat. It was so good.  Our waiter was great. He comped our dessert when he was informed it was my sister's birthday. If you're looking for a nice dinner option, or some place for a celebratory meal, I would highly recommend Stockyards."}
{"text":"Very, very pricey....  The big Rib-eye Steak I got was excellent.  However, my wife had the Elk and she could not finish it as it was mediocre at best and the Creamed Spinach and Rice Pilaf and Bearnaise sauce was edible but not enjoyable. (usually we just LOVE those items but their versions were a disappointment)  Wine is too expensive and the hours of operation are rather short.  I recommend the steak as it is after all what they are known to do best but be prepared to pay a lot for it.  The service was very good and atmosphere nice.  I would go back for the steak but the price is prohibitive when considering the quality of the whole meal.  We will give it another try someday."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner!  Cocktails were reasonable and a nice bottle of wine.  My wife had a filet that melted in her mouth!  I had the ribeye with the peppercorn sauce that was excellent.  Our waiter was Mark who was fantastic!  Very helpful, polite, engaging and always checking in on us.  A great evening."}
{"text":"Great service, great food, love the atmosphere, love the prices.  It's not cheap, but it's not the most expensive steak house in Phoenix, either.   We had lunch there. I had the southwest smoked chicken soup and a bison hot dog. Couldn't resist. The soup was amazing and the hot dog was delicious! My friend ordered the soup and sandwich. She had the Western Dip sandwich and said it was excellent.   We are planning on returning for dinner. I've already downloaded their menu so I can plan ahead.   As a bonus for those visiting for the Superbowl, this restaurant is right on the Metro line. Easy to get to!"}
{"text":"Do not go here unless you want to be ripped off and told YOU do not know what you are tasting.  The Stockyards used to be our special occasion higher-end steak restaurant.  In addition to exquisite beef, they had the world's most delicious New England clam chowder, made with a splash of sherry.  We went today, thinking of the delicious chowder and steaks.  What we received as New England clam chowder was a loaded baked potato soup, into which had been dropped a dollop of sherry and one speck of clam.  We told the waiter, and he gave us an explanation about how you have to know the difference between seafood chowder and clam chowder.  (At the end of the meal, when I repeated that it wasn't seafood anything, he said, well, we do have a loaded baked potato soup...) My filet mignon was actually a tough-ish sirloin.  The assistant manager either pretended to be surprised about the steak or truly does not know meats.  She tried to tell me that some filet mignon is tough! We will not be returning!"}
{"text":"My favorite place for steak. Great food great service! We get the 18oz prime rib and split it. Works every time!"}
{"text":"Great bar for a Filet Mignon. Awesome bartender with quick, courteous service. Went on Friday night and had quick service... Better than many places in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"we hadn't been here in a while and decided to meet up with some friends from out of town...it happened to be Restaurant Week and they had three pre-fixe menu options for only $44...included desert....the food was great and the service was fantastic!  I had deviated from my usual med rare bone in rib eye and had a new york strip...med rare...beefy and juicy.. three had the prime rib grilled and just loved it...loved the ambiance of the bar...1800's saloon...only negative was the construction and the drive....we live in the West valley and it was a 30 mile drive...worth it..."}
{"text":"My wife and I left dinner at The Stockyards last night and both had the same reaction: \"meh\". It's a nice, purposely kind of stodgy facility, and the service was definitely top notch. But the food left us thinking we should have gone to Outback. Perhaps if it weren't so expensive I'd have a different opinion, but when I paid $60 for just my meal, I was expect to be blown away. Instead, just \"meh\"."}
{"text":"They have four peaks root beer on tap and it is AMAZING. The service is very good, professional. The rooms are decorated nicely with mural walls, dark wood, and chandeliers. Great food. I had the salmon."}
{"text":"I had the pear salad, an 8 oz filet mignon medium rare with veggies (green beans & summer squash), and pecan pie for dessert. I sat at the bar. The salad was excellent. The steak was chewy the first two bites but the balance was very tender and cooked as ordered. The pecan pie with its dollop of creme fresh was the best I've ever flopped a lip over. The accompanying cup of black coffee was also first rate. It was pricey but I had two call drinks before dinner. My server, the bartender Harry, was attentive without being pushy. All in all a fine dining experience. I shall return."}
{"text":"Well it sure isn't steak 44 and should not be recognized as even a comparable option. Prime rib ready in less than 10 minutes. Barely warm, not hot. Service was fair but refills were an act of congress. Don't get the garlic bread as it appears they are made of rubber. One huge thing, the strawberry daiquiri was perfect. That's it."}
{"text":"Honestly, for the price, I was disappointed.  We've had better food at $$ restaurants.  Pro's 1.  Excellent decor and setting.  They weren't too busy and they spread people out to allow each group to have a more private experience. 2.  The service is top notch.  Con's  The food wasn't what I'd expect at this level.  Our daughter had the sirloin and while it's one of the cheaper steaks it wasn't done correctly, so we had to send it back (she asked for medium and one end was a very bloody medium rare  In addition the texture of the steak was quite  grainy.  I've had better steaks at Denny's.   My wife had the pork chop.  It was ok.  The sides which came with it, not so much.  Our son's girlfriend had the NY Strip.  It was outstanding.  Our son had the fillet - Cooked on the very rare side of Medium Rare.  It was ok.  I had the Ribeye - it was good.  Soups and salads were very good.  Appetizers were good too."}
{"text":"Fair seafood gratin, prime rib, sirloin, and awful sweet potatoes.  Good mushroom soup."}
{"text":"April 16, 2016 I took my 2 granddaughters to the Stockyards for dinner.  The appetizers, biscuits and cornbread were great.  We ordered the chateaubriand.  The meat was cooked to perfection.  The vegetables and sweet potato mash was excellent.  The garlic mashed potatoes tasted like boxed or canned but definitely not freshly made.  The Whiskey pepper gravy was tasty but would have been so much better had it been served on much tastier mashed potatoes.  We would definitely go back but next time we'll have baked potatoes. The service was also excellent."}
{"text":"Wow what a kick ass place to get a good steak.  We came here for VDay last month.  The service was fantastic.  The food was super good.  This trip I got the meatloaf and it was really good.  I loved the gravy that it came with too.  My honey bunny got the strip steak and it looked good too.  This place in my opinion is one of the best steak houses I have ever been too.  I think if you are coming to visit here you should try it."}
{"text":"Food was great. Not sure what happened to the Garlic Ranch Dressing they use to serve on the Wedge salad, but it was missed by everyone at our table. The service was great and the ambiance is perfect for entertaining friends and business associates."}
{"text":"This is a top notch place to eat.  A favorite for steak lovers the menu includes salmon and chicken too.  Not a cheap place to eat but you can dress casual."}
{"text":"Very good. Two great experiences. Both with exceptional service and excellent steak. This is not a new fangled restaurant, more of a old school down to earth awesome all the way around."}
{"text":"After many years hearing all about Stockyards, my first visit did not disappoint -- Great Experience!  Since personal expectations influence everyone's perception and experience, it's useful to arrive at a new place with an accurate idea of what to expect (i.e., there are a few harsh reviews here that seem, to me, unfair).  Stockyard is a historic, local steakhouse, and its filled with a local, historic decor... old photos, plaques, and antiques.  It's more in the line of Durant's (downtown Phoenix) than Ruth's Chris or The Keg, but with a Western or cowboy-ish flair.  So, sure, you walk in and it feels older, and perhaps, maybe, it would be nice if the carpet was replaced or the ceiling was higher, but, personally, I walked in and thought \"this is gonna be awesome\".    Huge steakhouse booths (we were in #26, both Senator Goldwater and John Wayne's favorite, apparently, as one may scan the entire room), dimly lit rooms, beautiful woodwork in the bar which is separated from the dining area... all the good stuff.  And, Holy-Shmoly, I cannot overstate how exceptional the service is.  The wait staff is truly exceptional, genuinely welcoming and friendly, will share the restaurant's history for newcomers, is very knowledgeable about the menu, cocktails, and wine selection (by the way, they have an EXCELLENT whiskey selection, including some very rare bourbons that I've only had here which are all reasonably priced).  When my ice-water was empty someone immediately filled it; when my plate was empty someone immediately picked it up, but no one ever hovered over us. They really take care of you.  The food was just as we'd hoped it would be, great quality and cooked perfectly. The service could not have been better (THANK YOU, MARK, YOU WERE AWESOME!), and the evening was really quite perfect.    If you're looking for a very formal steakhouse, go to Ruth's Chris or Morton's; if you want a steakhouse that's all about the social scene, go to The Keg or Houston's; if you're looking for Phoenix's authentic steakhouse, then go to Stockyards."}
{"text":"The meat was very tender and juicy. It was stringy for a bit but a good seasoning. However the price was very high and would recommend gettin something a bit cheaper."}
{"text":"I've only ever been to the saloon, but it's always a great time. You can't find a better Happy Hour. With free sliders and well poured drinks, it's a nice hangout.  Do yourself a favor and order the filet tips!"}
{"text":"They served a buffalo ribeye with asparagus. It was cook to spec and tasted wonderful with a mushroom sauce. Asparagus side was very tasty. I skipped the potatoes ... A carb thing. Service was very good. It was a full house but none were overwhelmed, just delightfully busy."}
{"text":"Big disappointment. Eating at several top rated steak houses such as The Metropolitan Grill, Seattle, Morton's in Dearborn, MI, Ruth's Criss, I had my expectations set for a memorable steak dinner. Ordered the Chateaubriand and was very disappointed to receive a like warm plate, with multiple dinner items surrounding the steak. A very poor presentation for the dinner. Visually great to look at, however, when each dish was plated, cool to the pallet. The amount of steak, for a $90 dinner was maybe five thin slices. UNIMPRESSIVE. Our dinner guest had the Fillet Mignon. Darn, far superior steak for cut and flavor and value."}
{"text":"Want a piece of the best Prime Rib in the Valley?  Go to the Stockyards Restaurant!  We've been there several times, and it's always just as good as the time before. Well worth the drive we make from San Tan Valley, AZ."}
{"text":"I had the Pear Salad and added salmon. It was very yummy - but very expensive  $23  The menu is a little misleading... The way it was laid out I thought the salad was $18... but when the bill came it was $23  The most expensive salad I have ever had...  The service was good,... They keep our water full Friendly staff greeted us when we arrived"}
{"text":"The atmosphere and the service is as good as it gets for a higher end eatery.  We had constant attention from our server as well as the bus boy.  The decor is very appropriate and inviting.  Definately an excellent experience overall.  The only downfall is the price of the food according to the price.  There isn't a huge discrepancy but a $40 Filet that is a $30 quality is my main concern.  All the garnishment was very good and appropriate for the entre.    Overall, the stockyard is an excellent place to dine with a quiet atmosphere and excellent service.  I expected a better quality steak for $40 and that was enough to drop them from 5 to 4 stars."}
{"text":"I give this place a 2 star based on price vs quality. I have eaten at just about every top steak house in phoenix and I would put this meal on par with an Outback steakhouse at best but almost top steakhouse prices.  $440 for 6 people and one had meatloaf and one had a chicken dish.   The atmosphere is warm and presents a very Arizona flavor to it. I enjoyed the decor. However, we were put in a back room in a corner which I am sure is the overflow room and is not as nice as the front.   The wait staff was very attentive and did a good job. Not a problem there.  My brother and sister in law were in town from Baton Rouge and we wanted to go to a local place of history. We picked this place after we could not get in to Don &Charlie's based on yelp reviews. Yikes, bad call.  3 people had the clam chowder (soup of the day) and it came out cold and sent back which I am sure they microwaved it hot.  4 of us had prime rib and I have had more flavorful at Outback or Charleston's . It was just ok. They do not advertise prime meat but grass fed which can be graded as choice which I assume it is. For the price is should be prime beef.  The mashed potatoes were just average mashed potatoes you can make at home with no thought of enhancing them....garlic cheese, something, etc??  The creamed spinach came out bairly warm. After the clam chowder we did not want to cause any more trouble by sending it back. I just chalked it up to not having the kitchen equipment of the top steak houses to serve pipping hot food.   It is not quite as expensive as Ruths Chris, Mortons, Durants, Capital grill, Donovan's, Mastros, City Hall or Flemings. However, I would suggest spending the extra and having a far superior meal.  The place was just average but at top prices. I will be going back to Flemings when I want quality sizzling hot food and am never dissapointed.  I will not be back."}
{"text":"First time here, ordered the prime rib cowboy cut med-rare, it was so tender and juicy, pure delicious! Server was also very friendly. Will be back again."}
{"text":"Had a Baseball cut steak    my god it was one of the best Steaks I've ever had.   I would also have to tip my hat to Bob our server."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was great and the food was amazing. Service was prompt and courteous. I had the Prime Rib and it was delicious and my wife had the Rib Eye steak and it was possibly the greatest steak ever. The Parmesan potato stack was a great side, very flavorful. I will definitely go again next time I visit Phoenix."}
{"text":"A very nice place to dine and enjoy the finer things.  It is kind of old school charm if you will, but they make it work.  Service was spot on, cocktails were masterpieces, and the steaks made to perfection.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Went in to the restaurant with a group of ten folks. Our service was pretty slow. I ordered a Caesar salad with steak on it. The salad came out overly dressed and soggy, very small in size, and with five small pieces of steak on top. I had to order more lettuce to \"fix\" the salad. The menu was confusing, I thought I was paying $18. for this salad, but instead they charged me $30.00 just for a lunch size salad! WOW! Where do their cows come from? Are they made  of gold? Expensive or what? Would never go back. Oh, by the way, I spoke to the manager about it, and he was defensive, and did not care."}
{"text":"Stockyards was very very good. I went with my boyfriend for our anniversary, we got the filet mignon with mashed potatoes, we also got a side Caesar salad with their moscato white wine. Everything was superb. The ambiance of the restaurant was nice. The service was really good. Also, we treated ourselves to a strawberry shortcake desert we will probably never forget! It was the best I've ever had! I think this restaurant is perfect for a date night!"}
{"text":"Came to eat during the lunch hour with a client and it was not packed at all.  They move fairly quickly as we were seated immediately, had server arrive, and our appetizers and main entrees all came out in less than 20min (a plus if you have a tight lunch schedule).   I had the soup of the day: clam chowder. It was very well seasoned but I couldn't get to the quality of the clam meat itself because of that. My main entree was the steak burger and that too was well done. It was on garlic toasted buns and it was delicious. Coleslaw was good too. This is definitely a restaurant that knows it's beef so I would recommend."}
{"text":"Wow. I love a well-done happy hour and this steak house has it (pun intended). I had never even heard of this restaurant before some co-workers invited me out for post-office drinks on Friday afternoon. Our office in the \"no man's land\" of 48th St./Washington area, where the only restaurant within a mile has saguaro wearing a pair of sunglasses on its sign. So imagine my surprise when we pulled up to this Durant's-style retro-classy steak house. First of all, the door's are copper, a fact I find amazing due to my new-found love of this material in Arizona. I can't help it, it just always looks perfect out here.  So we headed straight back to the bar area, through the dark wood with brass accents, dimly lit area of the restaurant. The bar is pretty big, several tables and seats along the bar itself - which is just incredible. A huge, ornate, wood carved saloon style behemoth (that puts Prescott Whiskey Row's The Palace to shame even!). In this magical place, Four Peaks 8th Street Ale was just $3. I will repeat that: Three Dollars. And they offered FREE happy hour snacks, and good ones at that. Sliders with condiments and chips and salsa.  Just. Wow. The atmosphere and history makes it a perfect spot for out of towners, the happy hour deals make it great for an everyday pit stop after a crap day at work."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Came here with some people from work. We all go steaks. I got a filet medium rare and it was cook perfectly! Service was great all in all it was a 5 star experience."}
{"text":"I know this place has been around forever and is well established in the Valley. But I think its about time for some CPR! Everything about this place inside and out screams old school...all the way down to the service staff's uniforms! Ummmm...has anyone else noticed that this place used to be their parent's old stomping grounds? That's cool but how but making it inviting for the 30-40 yr old crowd?   I had prime rib that was barely warm and I swear had the flavor of a dry piece of toast! The most bland Prime I've ever had. The \"fresh\" horseradish I requested on the side was even bland. My friend had the buffalo meatloaf (half buffalo/half ground sirloin). Now that my Dear Reader was a home run! Tender and full of flavor!  The ribs were decent and the \"baseball\" fillet was par at best also.   We went on a Friday night and were 4 of perhaps 20 other people in this huge place! The website reads like its scrumptous. When in fact, the experience was more like waiting in line at the new hot club only to find no one inside!   Oh....the only redemption was the desert. Pecan pie and their citrus creme brulee....Both make you rub your belly!!!  Bon Appetite!"}
{"text":"Got there about 5:30 left at 7:00. Very slow service. Our waiter seemed to lose interest in our table when we didn't order cocktails or appetizers before dinner. We didn't see him much after that. Other staff took care of the table. We just wanted to eat dinner. The salads were good; my spouse upgraded to Classic Caesar, the waiter said it would be a \"slight\" extra charge. $4.00 is slight at the Stockyards. The 12 oz. Ribeye was good, but not worth $36, I've had better. My spouse ordered the salmon and our friend the walleye. The waiter disappeared for a long time leaving us sitting with empty plates waiting for the check. I'd thought about dessert and coffee, but it took so long for the waiter to come back we didn't order any. It was my Birthday, so it was kind of a special evening for us. Sorry we went to the Stockyards to celebrate. The last time we were there during the summer, the service was excellent. We won't be back, too many good restaurants in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Old western steakhouse.  It has a definite Southwest theme to it, including very comfortable leather chairs.  Although the interior is kind of dark.    this place has a great crudités platter with home made ranch dressing, as well as some of the best biscuits west of the Mississippi.    The salad was classic steakhouse.  Could not be better.  The Mushrooms Rockefeller was so so.  I liked the mushrooms and the garlic spinach on the side.  But the spinach and sauce on the mushroom was not doing it for me.    The Parmesan potato stack were essentially really good scalloped potatoes.  Garlicly and creamy all in one, but still presented as a pretty dense cube.    The medium rare prime rib was perfectly cooked.  The horseradish sauce was pungent reminding me of St Elmo's steakhouse in Indianapolis.    This place was Awesome sauce.  I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I've lived in Phoenix almost 20 years and had never been here...  It's a solid put-meat-on-your-bones steakhouse.  Drinks were tasty, pre-dinner cornbread and biscuits were all kinds of yummy and the steaks were cooked to perfection.  Service was excellent and there's all kinds of memorabilia on the walls - get up and walk around between courses."}
{"text":"I loved this place!  It has been on my list of places to dine for a few years, and I wish it hadn't taken me so long to get here.  The atmosphere is very nice and there are a lot of things on the walls that are very interesting to look at.  We went for lunch, and I can't wait to get back to Phoenix so I can go for dinner.  The steaks we ordered, ribeye and prime rib, were great.  The mashed potatoes were REAL - clumps of potatoes and all. Service was great and the free birthday dessert was fantastic.  It was so nice of them to ask me what I would like as my free dessert!  I didn't realize I got a free dessert for my birthday, and it was even nicer to get exactly what I wanted!"}
{"text":"I was traveling from out of town and Stockyards was the nicest restaurant around. Not only was the food amazing, the service was great too. I got a filet, a glass of their house Cabernet, and the brownie for dessert. Great food, great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I went here last night with my boyfriend and a good friend of ours. We came around 7PM and were sat immediately. We were quickly a bread basket and a crudites platter. The crudites were yummy, however I found the biscuits a bit floury and the jalapeno cornbread nothing too special.   Our waitress was very attentive and gave all kinds of recommendations. I ordered the filet oscar plate, my boyfriend ordered the new york strip and our friend ordered the prime rib. Our food arrived not too long after we ordered and it looked GREAT! The filet oscar was fantastic, however there was no bacon wrapped around it.. but I may be ignorant to what filet oscars are supposed to look like since my only experience is at the Keg. My meal was served with asparagus spears and shredded carrots and french green beans which were room temperature.. still tasty.  The new york strip was excellent and the prime rib looked pretty good.. It was very rare to my friends liking, I didn't care for the texture but apparently he liked it since he pretty much scraped his plate clean.  We had the chocolate mousse for dessert which was ok.. nothing too special.  My only gripe is that it did take a bit for our check to arrive and for our waitress to cash it out. Other then that, no complaints."}
{"text":"Overwhelmingly delicious steak house! One of the oldest restaurant/steak houses in Phoenix, the Stockyard boasts classical photos, old school menus, and interior decor that makes for a unique place to dine at. They take reservations but there seems to be plenty of seating if you get here early enough. A variety of seating types to accommodate any group size. The menu is plentiful and many options. Unsure about a wine to pair with your dinner? Our server provided sample recommendations to choose from. Dinner starts with a small serving of veggies with ranch, and a small bowl of dinner rolls. A small menu in the center details the specials for the day. Our waiter was Bob and he was awesome. Very helpful and through, and our drinks were always filled. I had the rib eye and upgraded to the mushrooms on the side. My husband had the elk medallion and loved it. This was our first visit, and definitely not our last."}
{"text":"My parents actually took me here when visiting. Thank god because the prices are a weeee but more than what I can easily afford. Pretty pricey. I had elk medallions. Now, that...was..amazing!!! So tender and juicy. Good flavor and sear. It was awesome. Had some potatoes and carrots on the side. Great meat but a little pricey for what we got!"}
{"text":"I visited this place based on Yelp reviews and it was dead on- great Steaks ! I was on Business entertaining my Partner and we had Tammy provide great cust service all nt. We had the sampler platter Apptz and everything was good. We all had Steaks- mine was a 8oz Filet cooked perfectly and it was a tender delicious steak dinner! I highly recommend this Steakhouse and its a historic bdlg as well."}
{"text":"I really wanted to be able to give the Stockyards a higher rating. It was satisfactory, and I might go back, but I wasn't knocked out, sadly. Perhaps it was just my dish, or an off night.  The prime rib was a little tasteless and not very tender. The whiskey mashed sweet potatoes were great (and I absolutely plan to try to duplicate them at home) although they needed seasoning. Shrimp cocktail was impressive and yummy, salad course was excellent. I just was not very impressed with that prime rib. If I ever go back, I will try a steak instead."}
{"text":"First time here, the restaurant is very nice.  I really like the look of the place.  It is very clean.  I went at about 5:30 on a Sunday so there was barley anyone there.  I and my date both ordered the 12oz ribeye.  The steak was great!  I ordered the garlic mash and my date ordered a whiskey sweet potato mash.  She did not like the sweet potato mash.  It tasted very Thanksgiving to me, I thought it was ok.  A lot of holiday spices in the sweet potato mash.  The garlic mash was good.  The bread they bring to the table is good and the maple butter along with the bread is really good!  My overall experience was very good, solid 4 stars."}
{"text":"I had a nice meal and the bartender was great but I left wanting more.  Stockyards really isn't expensive compared to other big city steak houses because your steak includes a salad and starch.  I had a 12 oz NY strip(cooked perfectly), salad and a baked potato with 2 glasses of wine all for under $80.  Pretty reasonable.  The issue I have with this place is how boring it is.  There is ZERO energy.  Thursday night, Coyote's playoff game on TV and there was one dude at the bar from Alabama telling me how great  football is.  This place needs Restaurant Impossible to come in and liven the joint up.  Make it brighter, play some music and attract people under the age 65.  The 1950's are gone."}
{"text":"First time I came here that I can remember was 1965. Loved it then and loved it tonight and every meal in between.   Best jumbo shrimp in the Valley of the Sun. Fantastic chocolate mousse to top it off."}
{"text":"My rancher grandfather raised cattle,  but he never raised any more tasty and tender than the rib eye served here. BUT,  I will never go back.   The noise and slow service ruined the evening.  We were there at 6 pm on a Thursday,  but the beautiful rooms were packed.   There were too many tables with too many people crowded together. We had the same miserable experience when we shared a delicious chautobrian in the bar area a month earlier. Delicious.  Miserable."}
{"text":"Steak was over-cooked and tough. Sides were bleh. Decor was tacky. For the price, I'd rather go to Ruth's Chris or Morton's."}
{"text":"I came here for a work lunch, which is my excuse for being a vegetarian in a steakhouse. Not that surprisingly, there aren't many vegetarian options but there are salads and 1 wrap/sandwich. I got the pear salad and really liked it, but thought it was a bit on the small side. It's a classic combination of sweet pear, tangy cheese, and spicy pecans, and they do it very well. Thankfully it comes with buttered and cheesy bread crisps, which makes the salad a little more filling.   Overall, the service was okay. The waiter kept interrupting our work talk with questions on how the food was, which gets tiresome after the first time. I found the room we were in to be on the loud side, though there weren't a lot of people in it, so the acoustics are a little off."}
{"text":"We went into for the summer special with friends and were very pleased.  Everyone passes by SY and wonders what it is like.  Stop in for a great steak or prime rib and you'll be back.  The decor - let's just leave that at the food is very good.  Huge shrimp in the cocktail.  We had a t-bone and prime rib.  Both were prepared perfectly and served promptly.  Also, don't skip dessert.  The brownie was fantastic."}
{"text":"Spare your expense account. The steaks aren't hot. The veggies aren't fresh. The service is the kind that sticks their fingers in glasses to carry them. The steak knives are old and dull. The clientele has no qualms about putting their feet up on chairs in the dining room. Granted, I wasn't expecting even Ruth's Chris, but a steakhouse this is not. I can cook a $9 strip on my Weber and it comes out better than their $38 16 oz strip. Their parking lot is full of rental cars, but there must be better options. Spare your expense account."}
{"text":"I was staying down the street at the Crown Plaza so there were few choices nearby. This was closest. It's an average steakhouse. Nothing was memorable about my prime rib except it seemed kinda pricey. Service was good."}
{"text":"As a native of the area, I remember the stockyards operating back in the day. On a hot summer day, us kids would hold our noses when we'd drive by!   Am so grateful this valley landmark has survived so graciously over the generations so visitors and locals can enjoy a real steakhouse with flavorful cuts of properly aged meat in an elegant historical atmosphere.   There's no cattle shipping pens anymore, but the quality of beef Stockyards serves takes me back to the days when the restaurant was full of cattlemen - the kind that take their hat off indoors!"}
{"text":"Went for our anniversary. It was awesome! The appetizer with shrimp, crab and lobster was excellent! Steaks were perfect. We had ribeyes! Definitely will return. 2 people, steak dinner, wine, under $130."}
{"text":"Great place! Food was good, service was excellent! All the staff were very attentive and polite. Would put this at the top of the list of places to go."}
{"text":"Ate dinner at the bar.  Service was excellent as was food.  My only complaint is the place was super busy and it is inexcusable to have one bartender!"}
{"text":"We are visiting from Texas and decided on The Stockyards per Yelp reviews. We were not disappointed. This steakhouse rivals any in Texas. My husband had the filet mignon, and I had the prime rib. Both cuts of beef were tender and prepared perfectly. The biscuits and cornbread that come complimentary were delicious, as well as the roasted chicken soup that started my meal.   We finished our meal by sharing a slice of pecan pie. Again, pecan pie is a Texan food but I would have to say this was one of the best versions of pecan pie I have ever eaten.   We walked in on a Thursday evening about 6:30 without reservations and were seated immediately. Entree, one alcoholic beverage plus dessert for each of us was only a little bit over $100."}
{"text":"First time here, after a nice swim and jacuzzi next door at the Virginia G Piper Sports and Fitness Center.  Michelle is taking good care of me in the bar area. Just doin' their half lb burger today, with fries and an Arnold Palmer.   I should mention, the \"extras\" include two thick slices of a garden fresh  tomato, lettuce, red onions, a kosher dill pickle...the freshly cut fries complete the effect.  The Stockyards is one of the better known steak houses in Phoenix. Today their burger...a nice expensive steak is around the comer.  GREAT SPOT."}
{"text":"I think this place is way too overpriced and their food was not as amazing as the hype surrounding it. I went for AZ Restaurant week on a double date; the food was supposed to be affordable. Even after splitting it with my girlfriend and getting a drink a piece, we had to drop over a hundred dollars."}
{"text":"My hotel staff recommended this place, and I am glad they did! The waiter (Ron) gave us time to settle in and relax before he took our order.  His recommendation on the NY strip steaks was right on.  My friend ordered the dinner special that included elk. This place is how a restaurant should be, we weren't rushed after dinner and allowed to finish our cocktails while chatting. Next time I am in Phoenix I will be stopping by again."}
{"text":"Very nice happy hour. Its dark inside but the beer prices are good and they have free sliders, chips and salsa."}
{"text":"My wife and I were in town from Indiana for the Fiesta Bowl on New Year's Day. We stopped in here for dinner after the game. This is by far the best restaurant I've ever been to. Absolutely fantastic! My wife got the 8oz filet and I got the NY strip. Hard for me to imagine how they could've been cooked better. Amazing!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a special place for birthday dinner and my favorite is steak.  We are new to Phoenix, so I checked reviews and we tried Stockyards.  We won't be back.  Good:  The service - our server was attentive, water was always filled on time.  Wine list had some nice selections.  We got the strawberry shortcake dessert for my birthday for free, which was awesome.  Bad: everything else.  Bread was OK, nothing special.  Crudities were clearly not fresh and the ranch dip/dressing was terribly watery.  My filet was cooked to order, but the server really talked up their carving and aging process, but I certainly couldn't taste it.  The steak desperately  needed seasoning and a nicer char on the outside.  I ordered the Parmesan potato stack based on the servers recommendation and it came out COLD.  I placed it on my bread plate and asked the server if they could warm it up, as it was basically inedible.  When it came back out (they actually gave me a new one), I was almost done with my steak.  It was definitely delicious, it's too bad it wasn't hot when they plated it so I could have enjoyed it with my steak.  My husband said his steak was good, but nothing special; same with his fries.  Again, seasoning was lacking.  It was a very pricey, disappointing dinner.  We moved to Phoenix from a much smaller city and our special occasion steakhouse has much better range of choices and significantly better tasting steaks for the same, or lower, price.  Seems like there are many other steak house choices here in Phoenix, we won't be back to this one."}
{"text":"Amazing service and a romantic atmosphere. The prickly-pear sweet butter is delicious on the biscuits. I thought the prime rib was a little dry but still tender and tasty. My wife and I will add this to our date night list."}
{"text":"Their steaks are great!! Its a bit on the pricey side, but completely worth it! They're seasoned a cooked to perfection! I wish I remembered our waiter's name, but he was phenomenal!!  I would definitely recommend this steakhouse to anyone!"}
{"text":"Wow!  What a great old-school steakhouse.  While they do actually have other items on the menu, if you don't eat red meat, I wouldn't bother showing up. Not because the non-red meat items aren't good but really, why bother?  This place is known for steaks and they deliver.  They also do the old school relish tray (who does that anymore, right?) and a basket of biscuits and corn muffins.  Yum.  Our service was flawless.  And if I were you, I'd catch an after dinner drink in the bar.  Impressive historical tidbits all over the restaurant, and the bar is great too.    I see some people whine about the price.  Yeah, they're pricey but it was well worth it and from what I understand, their lunches are just as amazing and much cheaper. This is way better than any shiny Scottsdale steakhouse any day.  BTW, they actually followed up with me the next day via Twitter and thanked me for my patronage.  How's THAT for good customer service?!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with clients. It's a very classic steakhouse. We came during the holiday season and they had cowboy boot stockings hung up on the fireplace. How cute right?  They are known for their steaks but I was detoxing from Thanksgiving weekend so I order the salmon with double veggies. The salmon had amazing flavor to it. All food at the table that was ordered was well received - we had people who tried the club sandwich and the salmon salad and everyone really loved their meals.   The ambience here is great. It's definitely not trendy and it's more \"old school\" :). Some people told me you only have to come here once...I say you could come here more than that and be just fine!  Definitely give it a whirl!"}
{"text":"\"Fine dining\" is not just a setting.  it isn't just good food.  It is many things that add up to an attitude. I have had the opportunity to find it in different cities. I found it the other night at the Stockyards.  We were seated by a host who took us to our table and when we were properly seated gave us menus.  Our server came to the table and introduced herself and said she would return shortly.  It was nice to have a moment to chat before we had to think about ordering.  When she did return,  our glasses were filled-not something we should have  to wait for her to do when the service is right.  She knew the selections on the menu and all available options and could make sensible comments concerning them.  Our salads were served promptly by two additional people and were as fresh as I could ask for.  When my friend was finished with hers they asked if they could take her plate.  I was pleased when they didn't ask me if I was finished with my salad and could they take my plate.  If I'd been finished I could have told them.  We were able to continue our conversation uninterrupted as I finished my salad.  The salad plate was removed  when it was appropriate and we had a few minutes before the entrees were served.  All was in keeping with a relaxed dining.  At no time did I have to think about having drinks refilled, it just happened quietly.  After a few minutes our dinners were served by the two gentlemen and our server appeared to make sure they were to our satisfaction before we started.  There was no room for error there that couldn't be resolved before we started.    My friend had ordered a small steak. My friend is  quite elderly and Kathy, our server, discretely asked her if she'd like it cut for her.  A potato also was served with her dish.  I asked my friend which of the condiments she would like it prepared with.  She look at me and said \"Prepared with?\" She didn't understand what I was getting at but Kathy did and was already reaching for the potato.   She opened the potato and smiled while my friend said a bit of everything.  One doesn't go to a restaurant like the stockyards to have to deal with opening a hot potato and preparing it.   When serving is done properly, these things don't have to be discussed.  Kudos to, Kathy!!!.  That is part of the fine dining experience.  I had a full rack of ribs which were so tender the meat fell of them.  The sauce had spice to it but not so strong the flavor of the meat was concealed.  I also can tell you that unless you are a big eater, half a rack would fill most people.  My friend said, \"Yummy!\"  and I agreed.  I am used to getting a finger bowl for clean up after eating, but I can't complain about the two extra napkins and several ways of cleaning my fingers that accompanied my ribs.    My friend let them know we were celebrating the 17th anniversary of my 39th birthday so they served me a free desert.  I can assure you the pecan pie is a delight!  Warm and laced with brandy, it was perfect way to finish our dinner.  The stockyards, I might mention, is not inexpensive, but what an enjoyable way to spend your money. They do offer two dinner specials you won't find at most other places.  They do have a luncheon menu that has lower prices.   Don't expect chrome and music that is a bit to loud as many of the new places offer.  Instead, just enjoy a time and place where they pamper you as you should be when you go to the Stockyards.  I don't consider the stockyards to be a place you where shorts and Nike's, but of course there are always a few.  I would say a nice shirt and slacks at least."}
{"text":"really enjoyed my experience here. food is really good.   filet mignon medium rare is cooked perfectly. the Elk is also very tender.  I love the mix berry desert it's really delicious not too sweet. It goes really well the  the 20 year desert wine on the menu. service is outstanding. the only thing I didn't like is the steak soup, it's a bit too salty."}
{"text":"My mother was in town and this restaurant was recommended to us. I've been to a lot of fine dining establishments and a ton of steakhouses. I was by no means impressed. Our service was good, the environment was very clean and inviting, but the acoustics are horrible. It's terribly loud and hard to hold a conversation in.    My partner and I ordered two very pricey filets (don't mind the price if it's high quality meat and prepared/cooked well). I ordered mine MR it came out very MW and she ordered hers MW (they asked if they could butterfly it and she said ok) and it came out like jerky. She didn't complain, I did and when the second steak came out it was still only medium. I couldn't handle a second wait and just stomached it.   The server gave us a free dessert because he knew the food wasn't prepared well at all.   Not horrible but would never recommend or return."}
{"text":"By far the best happy hour deal in all of Phoenix...free burgers, chips and salsa and 1/2 price beer!"}
{"text":"I had no idea this place was so fancy!  I'm glad we went for a late lunch when there were only a few people there.  When we walked in, we looked like a small ninja team.  All we needed were our turtle shells and goggles!  Had it been crowded for the regular lunch crowd, we might not have stayed.  I was thinking this restaurant would be similar to Cattleman's Steakhouse in Oklahoma City.  WRONG.  That being said, the service we received was as if we were dressed in our Sunday best.  It was phenomenal.    We were presented with the lunch menu and I immediately found myself torn between the sliced prime rib with cheddar cheese and the BBQ beef sandwich.  The combo of the cheddar with the prime rib didn't sound too appealing, although our server told us he loves it so much he eats one three times a week (I wouldn't admit to something like that!).  I decided to get the BBQ sandwich to be safe.  My sandwich arrived on a regular sized bun with a huge heaping of meat in it.  I didn't eat the top portion of the bun; only the bottom with the meat on top.  The taste was both tangy and sweet, with just a nice hint of spice.  My sandwich came with an order of skinny fries and a pickle.  It wasn't exactly cheap (9.00), but I didn't have any regrets about ordering it.    I'm still curious about the prime rib sandwich, so I may have to go back for that this week some time."}
{"text":"I usually try and steer clear of red meat but since I came to the original steak house in Phoenix, I don't regret the filet at all...very great place for a nice dinner"}
{"text":"Our first visit.  The steak was good.  The chili, DENNISON'S.  I have eaten Dennison's chili my whole life. I buy it at Fry's.  The service was very good and a beautiful restaurant."}
{"text":"Really outstanding meal...filet was perfect, and grilled scallops just put the meal over the top.  Parker served a great meal and a great attitude.  I will come back."}
{"text":"I am always amazed when I find a great..NO! ... An AMAZING steakhouse ! The Stockyards has a rich history and that makes it even more special. Upon arriving at Stockyards, I am a little taken aback about where it is. Here's the deal though, this place started in 1919 as a packing house and eventually grew to a huge feedlot with more than 40,000 head of cattle.  In 1947, the Stockyards Restaurant opened on the feedlots property and was THE place for cattle baron, politicians and bankers to meet. With beef 'homegrown' , fed and plated right on property, the Stockyards Restaurant was THE original Arizona steakhouse. Much of the glory of the cattle days has since gone, but the history in the building still exists.  The bar was bustling and a standing room only when I arrived on a Wednesday night to meet up with a few other people. There are ample premium liquors and an extensive wine list to be enjoyed. We were seated promptly at our reservation time and given an overview of the restaurants history by our great waitress. A small silver terrine of fresh veggies are left for pre-dining munching. Reminds me of old school parental type restaurants. Love that!  Many of the steaks are cut on order and are aged on property. They even have Chateaubriand for two!  I had a 5 oz. filet and it was like slicing warm butter. So thick and amazing flavor! I highly recommend the Parmesan Potato Gratin Stack to go with your choice of meat. I started with the very ample Green Goddess salad and that can be split. Our waitress paired a wonderful Cabernet with my filet; ON her game! For dessert, we all ordered many things and sampled each other's. I personally loved the Burnt Creme .. Rich like a brûlée , yet with enough of a citrus finish to not be too, TOO sweet. I paired that with a Frangelico on the rocks and I left, NOT finishing any of one thing I ordered ! I was stuffed! No worries , it was nicely boxed up for the next day :)  I did not find this steakhouse to be pretentious, as some can be, or snooty. People dressed from casual to dressy and no one batted an eye at that. You will need a reservation. The Stockyards was busy from the time I arrived just after 6pm to almost 10pm , when I left.  This is a great steakhouse with amazing food and history and service to go along with great prices for hand cut and seasoned/aged steaks and meats. A awesome dinner for about $50-80 p person with wine .. Best thing, is , it's local!"}
{"text":"Ordered the 12 oz filet mignon w/ backed potato (loaded) and house salad with ranch. Meal was B+ overall, filet was cooked perfectly, steak was pretty tasty. The sauce they provide with the steak was ~ C+.   Ambience is exactly what you would expect for a former stockyard/pack house, and that is what I like about the place, A on ambience.  Service was an A. My 5 yr old had some chicken nuggets that weren't all the way cooked, and they removed it from the bill (he ended up sharing with his 3 yr old brother, what to expect when it is finger fried food - not the reason you end up going).  Draft beer was good, had the Moose Drool.   Best item of the night was the honey whipped butter that came with the rolls, A+ on that.  OVERALL, same as rating, solid B to B+"}
{"text":"My team and I truly enjoyed our experience at Stockyards Restaurant.  Great food, and a great staff.  The staff was very attentive to our needs for water, drinks, plates etc which we all appreciated.  The portions sizes were very good and everything tasted great all the way through.  You even get free biscuits and cornbread.  Awesome.  I would definitely recommend Stockyards Restaurant."}
{"text":"Such a unique, classy, delicious, throw back to an older time steakhouse.  Quality of the meats is fantastic and if you appreciate a little bit of Arizona history and a legit old fashioned bar, this place is sure to please.  And they have free sliders during happy hour at the bar! Are you kidding me? I just found this out, how do people not stampede this place for happy hour? Fine by me, my little secret haha."}
{"text":"Great meal, but very overpriced. There once was a time for places like this, but there is better value, and in some cases better food, to be found elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is easily one of the best steakhouses in town. I've been to many of them more than once, and steaks are simply superb. Not to mention the prompt, and sometimes over-enthusiastic service.  It was a rainy Tuesday, and although I am an extremely patient person, traffic and gridlock really vex me. So when I see the freeway signs warning me that there are prolonged stretches of road that are just littered with crashes, I either have to rant and rave to my wife as to the bad drivers; especially when it rains. Or, I can take a detour and pass the time away at one of our favorites restaurants.  My wife had another business symposium she had to attend in Tempe, and it always runs later than advertised. So, on the way back, we decided to cut through SR-143 due to the gridlock on the I17/I10. As I was barreling through this shortcut, my wife speaks those 4 simple words...\"When are we eating?\"  Well, it happens to be that I was by Washington St exit already, and just a block from the exit is Stockyards Restaurant. So, I quickly exited, and pulled into the drenched parking lot. Our appetites whetted due to our expectations of enjoying a great dinner here.  However, my wife who was dressed in a Business Casual outfit looked me over and was concerned that I was not appropriately dressed. I allayed her concerns by stating that I may not be dressed in Business attire, but my perfectly matched and stylish jogging outfit, and my matching Puma shoes would fit right in - I commented facetiously! I also assured her that after eating here for many years, their attire is quite casual.  So we entered the place, and lo and behold; nearly everyone we saw was dressed in either formal or business casual attire, and I stood out much to her chagrin. It didn't bother me the least bit as I have little care for the opinion of people I have no relationship with, but I could sense the trepidation in her demeanor.  In any case, they promptly and courteously seated us. And there began our wonderful dining experience, once my wife's uncomfortableness waned.   Our server, Chris, was just a wonderful host. He promptly mentioned that chef's specialties, and the unadvertised special of the Buffalo Ribeye with seasoned potatoes and Asparagus. I was immediately sold and had him sign me up. My wife had the Campfire Sirloin.  In a nutshell, she couldn't say enough good things about her Sirloin. And my Buffalo Ribeye was simply splendid. It was just an awe-inspiring piece of steak.  In addition, the service that Chris and the rest of the wait staff provide was spot on.   And to top it all off, by the time we made it out of there, the freeways had been cleared of crashes and traffic, and we were able to speed on home unfettered!   Not a bad experience at all for an impromptu dinner for the both of us for $140.  It was definitely worth our detour."}
{"text":"I miss the rugged decor I remember pre-renovation but I they retained many of the original features and personality of the old SY.  Pleasant greeting at the door, comfortable seating for me and my guest.  Great menu selections, good food presentation and unobtrusive high class service.  No pressure to turn over the table even though it was a busy night. Only ONE THING MISSING - where are all the single women in the bar area?  By 5:30 this place was packed with men between 30-50  and if I were still single this is where I would head after work!  You have to hunt where there's good huntin' gals!"}
{"text":"Good hometown place. Don't expect Mortons or Del Frisco. Food was good and atmosphere is vintage Fort Worth in the 1970's."}
{"text":"The best steak I have eaten in the US.  We ate there twice while we were in town for a training class. Both times the filet was like butter, you didnt even need a knife.   The cheesecake was very yummy as well.   I dont remember which sides I had with my steak, that could be due to the fact that they weren't all that great or it was because I was so focused on my delicious steak.   If I ever travel to AZ again, I will make sure I stop here to eat."}
{"text":"A bit pricey for the quality. Two of our four steaks were grossly overcooked and had to be sent back. They didn't return the mushrooms that were on one plate and they were extra cost. When the bill arrived there was no discount to the total for their errors. I'm sure Phoenix has better to offer. The ambiance is nice as are the historical photos on the walls."}
{"text":"Had the worse experience at this rest. Our server was rude and arrogant. The worse service I have ever experienced. We went there for rest. week. I ordered the 8oz. filet med with a little pink in the middle. When I received my entrée it was two small medallions. (not a filet ) I brought it to the attention of the server and was told that this is was what I ordered. I said no it is not. He got rude and nasty and arguing with us. Did not even offer me another filet. My husband and him we getting into a heated argument because of the way the server spoke to us. We had to find the manager on our own. We explained that it was not about the money but of the experience we had with the server. She offered to buy us our drinks. So when the check came she did take off our drinks but not my dinner. I can't believe that she did not comp. my meal.We paid and left. I WILL NEVER GO THERE AGAIN....THEY NEED TO GIVE THEIR TEAM A COURSE ON CUSTOMER SERVICE SKILLS."}
{"text":"Gosh, where to start? Ambiance is great. Would be good for business or personal time. History of the restaurant is impressive. The food is delicious! I'm craving it now. One of my favorite aspects of my visit was my server, Alice. She was funny, kind, and awesome at her job. Very grateful for my experience here at Stockyards. Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"Scott Schumann gave us THE BEST service. He was very attentive and the food came out at perfect cadence. He also very gracefully slid in with napkins and club soda when I spilled on my clothes. Kudos to the entire team for the wonderful food and service. Thank you Scott for making us crave the return trip already!"}
{"text":"I had dinner here last night with a coworker. We completely spaced on it being Valentine's Day and it was packed. We were able to sit in the bar area and enjoyed dinner and drinks there with no wait.  I started with a dirty martini which was very well made.  I ordered the filet, rare, and it came cooked as ordered.  The baked potato and salad that accompanied the entree were both very good. The salad was fresh and crisp.  My coworker ordered the prime rib and he thoroughly enjoyed his meal, as well. This is a very solid dinner option near the Phoenix airport."}
{"text":"Yum! Steaks were great! Corn bread  large portions definitely worth the price!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to eat here for many years but with so many choices around we always seemed to forget about it. My wife finally remembered and we came here for a birthday dinner with my daughter and her family. We arrived for our 7 PM reservation and there were a handful of cars in the parking lot. Should have been our first clue. The service was great, the reason for the 2 stars. The food was ok at best, but not equal to the prices charged. We all had steaks and 4 of the 5 were not prepared as asked for. Shrimp cocktail looked great when it was served but was not fresh and had a very fishy smell. $249 before tip and not worth half of that. Once again, the service was actually very good. The steaks were not high quality, have had better at chain restaurants like Outback. Got it out of my system but we will never return. We will stick to Roaring Fork, Ruth's Chris or Don and Charlie's for steaks. Same price, much better steaks."}
{"text":"Excellent Prime Rib! We had a great meal here, very good service and an old West ambiance which is actually authentic. The restaurant while very good is spendy. I would absolutely go back as the service was wonderful and the meat really is this good."}
{"text":"I don't usually write reviews but I feel compelled to for Stockyards.  Our food was excellent, every last bite from the salad to the filet and parmesan stack potatoes to the chocolate cake!  Our server,  Dan Hill, was the best!!!  Hands down best waiter ever! He was so knowledgeable about the history of the restaurant and the food.  He was so friendly and fun,  he chatted with us for a while and took our picture near the old flag.  Awesome experience,  and I will call it that.  We were there for 3 hours and did not realize it.  If I am ever back in Phoenix, it will be my first stop!  Thank you Dan and the Stockyards!"}
{"text":"Would not recommend to my friends or family. The quality of the food was below par and for the price go to Steak 44 or Mastro's. Everyone in our group felt the same way. The porterhouse steak was about 1/2 thick and not tender at all. The sides were not good either. The best thing we had was the strawberry dessert. We were overcharged for a extra bottle of wine and when we brought it to our waiters attention we was arrogant and said he would have caught it if not brought to his attention. We left hungry and disappointed."}
{"text":"A quick business trip allowed the chance to stumble upon this joint. Aside from it being close to both the hotel and airport, I was running with a big group of guys. And what do most guys prefer after a long, hard day at work? MEAT!!!  Now this stable ain't your typical chop house. While the dry-aged beef is delectable enough to be cut with your fork, the ambiance is nothing you'd expect. Yes, it is white tablecloth. Yes, their wine and meat selection is quite vast. Yes, the place bustles, hard. However, when you walk in, you actually feel like you take a step back in time, a time of farming, ranch-handing, cattle-calling, slaughtering, etc...   When in Phoenix, this is a must do, see and eat. They will give you something to remember and talk about for days!"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good, service was a disappointment  MAJOR problem- we used a gift card and cc to pay and we ended up paying about an extra $20 because she overcharged us. won't return due to that fact, hope she enjoyed her extra tip on top of her initial 20%"}
{"text":"When I want a pound of flesh I come to THE STOCKYARD for steak. Let's face it when you want a steak you defiantly want it coming from a business that builds its reputation on cattle. At one point The Stockyards of Arizona were the largest cattle stockyards in America with over 40,000 heads of cattle at anytime.   Now I came in tonight and ordered up a giant  ribeye steak seared to a perfect medium ( light pink inside) pulse a twice baked potato. My steak was sensational yet my spud didn't match My own twice baked style it taste. Yet it was a solid potato to accompany my meal. I started with a cup steak soup. A rich creamy base with plenty of steak bits with a robust flavor. Each meal comes with some choices and I could have also had the salad or chili to accompany my meal. I tasted my lady friends chili and OMG a winner. I'll be back for a bowl of the frontier chili for sure.  Wait staff was exceptional and informative. Waiter had a pleasant demeanor which made our family meal one of the best meals of the trip.  You didn't feel rushed to order. He was on top of our personal needs and provided a history narrative of how the restaurant was formed and shared with us about the famous handcrafted bar made of a single piece of wood.    Needless to say I'll be coming back very soon for another delicious steak. If I'm lucky maybe even desert. Come see why it's an amazing place and worth every penny you spend."}
{"text":"Where else can you go and get Wild Boar and Venison Sausages or Buffalo Meatloaf?  Name me just one place where you can get Walleyed Pike.  If you choose to dine here you will be eating at ARIZONA'S ORIGINAL STEAKHOUSE est 1947 but restored and added to City of Phoenix Historical Register for roles in AZ Cattle industry and Architectural style.  Something struck me as different when we entered here we were greeted by a host that greeted us like VIPS and seemed genuine not rushed although other people were coming in. You see the extra care that went into your setting everything is polished till it sparkles. Wait staff is dressed professional and are knowledgeable.  We were started off with complimentary fresh cut vegetables and dip on a very shiny well polished relish tray and piping hot  biscuit's bread muffins that were rich sweet and moist  and soon we received salads (house salad or soup is included) the salad was large and fresh but very mildly seasoned.  My husband had the Wild West Mixed Grill of Elk Medallion, Walleyed Pike, Wild Boar and Venison Sausage that included potato cake ,rice pilaf and vegetables. Everything was prepared well and seasoned mildly.   I had the Walleyed Pike it was lightly pecan dusted and buttered this fish is very mild and rich textured and was also served with fresh vegetables and rice pilaf.  Both meals were large enough to feed two people for us a few things were less than 4 stars but that is due to just not being our style nothing was wrong with anything.  I was impressed with the hospital cleanliest of the Ladies room.  The Stockyards is Dining it is not just going out to eat"}
{"text":"It was a late night, so I only had Creamy Tomato Soap and the Wedge Salad.  Both were great!  The wedge salad had creamy ranch dressing with fresh bacon chunks.  The lettuce for wedge salad was perfectly chilled."}
{"text":"On Tuesday Feb 1, 2011 Gary Lasko responded to my Yelp complaint, apologizing for the service, stating the actions he has taken to train the staff in resolving my service issue, then invited me back.  Upgrade to 4 Stars for the diligence, concern and fast response. Besides, the food was excellent, portions were generous, and the sides were great.."}
{"text":"It is one of my all  time favorite steak houses.  Great atmosphere and amazing food!"}
{"text":"This is a top notch steakhouse. Not a cheapie steakhouse like some. But it is definitely worth the little extra cost. Steaks are cooked the way you like and there are several choices. If you don't want steak there are other great choices also. The biscuits are served with honey butter and delicious.  They serve you a small relish tray that is part of their long tradition. The desserts are excellent and big enough to split for 2. This place has been here a long time and I have visited a few times over the years. It started as a restaurant next to the Phoenix stockyards of years past. The cows are all gone and now a small business park. But the food is still excellent. Great place for family, small groups or couples night out. Come casual or formal either way the Western styled staff will make you enjoy your meal."}
{"text":"Solid establishment for steaks. I wish they had more dry aged beef options, but oh well. According to my business colleagues, the cut of meat that day was even better than usual. I ordered the ribeye sandwich, cause thats what was highly recommended. For starters, we ordered onion rings. The onion rings have a good batter, a nice crunch, and overall were tasty. You do have to chomp down on the onion or the whole thing will slip away from the batter.   The ribeye was a great cut of meat indeed. Coked medium rare, it had a good flavor and no gristle. I was expecting more of an actual sandwich with two pieces of bread, but one piece was just fine. The bread itself was good, even though there was nothing special about it really. The coleslaw was creamy, but just enough to where it didnt feel drowned. The pickle was a nice touch.   I would have loved to have tried the buffalo ribeye, but maybe another time. I cant help to shake away the idea that the food is supplied by a mass distributor (like sysco or ben e keith) but if they are, they do a good job with what they have."}
{"text":"Wild Game platter?  SIGN ME UP!  The Wild Boar sausage was near orgasmic.  The fish wasn't bad either.  I liked the atmosphere here...it was cozy.  I'd definitely visit this place again when I'm in town."}
{"text":"Awesome place!  Took my wife here for her birthday and wasn't disappointed.  Food and service was wonderful.  Had the filet mignon and it was juicy and oh so tender.  The parmesan potatoes were delicious.  Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've ever had. It wasn't cheap, but worth every penny.  Five guests enjoyed everything that came to the table.   Very very enjoyable. I wish there was one in my town.   The wine list was notable as well."}
{"text":"Service was awesome. Waiter was attentive and very friendly. Brought out a refill of my drink before I was done with my first.   The chili is a must! Usually eat tons of crackers when I eat chili but didn't even miss them. Was so good on its own. But there are crackers if you must have them.   My main was the filet. Ordered medium plus wanting just a little pink in middle. Had pepper corn sauce on the side but didn't use it. Flavor of steak was good on its own. Mine was a little more pink in the middle than I would like. Whipped potatoes were great! Will b back!"}
{"text":"As  a steak house reviewer most the time, I like it.  The Sausage with the cranberry chuteny sauce appitizer was great, their bread and soups were top notch.  The steak was made good by their sauces.  Their wine selection was good and the waiter new a lot.  the abmiance is your typical Durants, Don and Charlies, Donovans old school vibe. Service great, btu it was a late lunch too."}
{"text":"The restaurant is very unique and a enjoyable atmosphere . It's also causal and kid friendly. My husband and I ordered a 12oz and 16oz ribeye. Both steak where delicious. They also offer a kids menu.  The family will come again."}
{"text":"While I appreciate a good steak occasionally, I don't appreciate $9 baked potatoes.  I'm sorry, but if I'm paying $40 for a piece of meat, is it too much to ask to throw in the potato? This quirk has eliminated a growing number of steakhouses from my list of dining options.  I'm happy to report that Stockyards agrees with me.  Although the area leaves a lot to be desired, I love that this restaurant is rich in Arizona history.  I love the building (check out the bar) and it's Old West charm.  And I love that it's still here after decades of change in the Valley.    The restaurant is quite large with several rooms.  Nice enough to dress up a little, but still comfortable enough for casual attire.  That's \"casual,\" not pajama bottoms and bed head.  This isn't Safeway.  My dining companion and I shared the Chateaubriand for Two (in other words, me and the dude I married ate a big tenderloin).  The steak was really good and perfectly tender.  It was served with the expected Bearnaise (which I didn't care for) and a house steak sauce which was better.  Also included were mashed potatoes, whiskey sweet potato mash, mushrooms, and \"seasonal\" vegetables, in addition to the salad, corn muffins, and biscuits served at the beginning.  A lot of food for $80!  The mashed potatoes were average (but they weren't $9), and the vegetables were a disappointment, consisting of nothing but julienned carrots and some broccoli.  The sweet potato mash was very tasty, however.  Did you know it's possible to eat sweet potatoes without marshmallows?  Crazy, I know.  While I thought some of the food was closer to 3 stars, I can't help but bump it up to 4 given the overall experience."}
{"text":"Excellent grilled prime rib done perfectly. Superior service, great sautéed spinach. All in all great experience."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and it was a great experience overall. We were greeted and seated right away, even though the rest of our party had not yet arrived.  Kudos for the complimentary raw vegetable sticks and dressing they bring to the table along with the bread! How considerate! I try to do low carb (even though I made an exception here, lol) and I appreciate when businesses make an effort to accommodate for alternate ways of eating. The bread included corn bread and biscuits, with sweet whipped butter.  We did not have appetizers but the main dishes and sides were excellent. I had the ribeye, plus seafood chowder (very generous amounts of seafood) and the baked potato with all the toppings. I had not had a baked potato in ages and it was delicious. Hubby had the filet, with sides of chili and beans with chorizo. Our friends had the prime rib.  We were celebrating 2 birthdays and they treated us to 2 delicious desserts. Our server Parker was excellent, very friendly and attentive. The 5th star was earned by her, hands down.  We stayed late and ended on moving to the bar after dinner. Nice and quiet for a good conversation."}
{"text":"This place was just \"okay.\"  I would use the term \"old timey\" to describe it.... I would also use that term to describe the clientele.  I went there for a business lunch, I would say that most of the older male population of Phoenix did the same.  I must also note that there is ZERO ambience-- it looks like a Best Western dining hall.  On to the food.  I had been craving prime rib, so that is what I ordered.  Though it was accurately cooked to be medium rare, the texture and flavor were not great.  The meat was bland, and it was not all that tender.  Even the au jus lacked flavor.  It was served with some sort of potatoes that I didn't really like either.  However, I have to say that my companion ordered the filet-- also medium rare-- and said that it was really good.  I am not going to give this place a bad review, but I can't give it a stellar one either.  Im addition, the prices are a little high for such boring food.  I am truly ambivalent about Stockyards.... and life is too short to eat mediocre food.  ;)"}
{"text":"I had a great meal here last night.  Had a salad, then the stuffed pork chop with stuffing and green beans.  Pork cooked just the way I ordered.  This place is an upscale old style western steakhouse.  Big leather booths, great ambiance.  Excellent attentive service.  Well lit dining area.  And the bar is far enough away from the dining that you won't be disturbed on a date.  My third time at this Restuarant.  I'll be back\""}
{"text":"Chris P. and the Chef served a wonderful buffalo meatloaf.  The steak soup was delicious.  The buffalo chili is savory.  The atmosphere is elegant. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Anyone who doesn't rate this 5 stars doesn't understand steakhouses. In a world full of exotic, overpriced, over the top frilly steakhouses, Stockyard's keeps things the way they should be. Can you go somewhere else and pay more for a steak that may or may not have been blessed by a Japanese Rabbi? Probably. But why would you?  If you appreciate the old school, high quality steakhouse this is the place. Not the least bit pretentious, walking in you will immediately realize that Stockyard's is a true Arizona experience, and pays homage to it's own wild west heritage throughout the restaurant.   Now, let's not misconstrue this: it's still a damn nice restaurant. What Stockyard's does so well, however, is be true to Arizona in that while the place feels like a special experience, you won't feel out of place whether you are wearing a jacket, your golf outfit or your cowboy boots.   I suppose you aren't reading these reviews to find out if you can wear your boots, so let's talk about the food. I have tried at least 1/2 of the menu, and can't say a single bad thing about it. When they run the baseball cut on special, do NOT pass it up! I am a huge fan of baseball cut steak, and this one is the best there is. I am not a big fan of filet, so if I am going off the regular menu I usually go with the NY or the prime rib if I m feeling like prime rib.  The best thing about Stockyards hands down is the value for the food and service you receive. It's not cheap, so don't expect to walk out with a $20 steak, but for what they do charge you are getting far more for your money than the other allegedly \"esteemed\" steakhouses in town. Your dinner includes fresh veggies and dip as an appetizer, fresh bread (which is superb), a salad, and a starch of your choice on top of your choice of meat. How many places even offer that anymore? And did I mention that their steaks easily rival the more expensive guys in town?   To top it off, their wine and drink selection is top notch. Service has always been excellent, and their servers and bartenders extremely knowledgeable and helpful.  If you are looking to spend some money on a steak, and want the best quality, value and experience for your money, this is the only choice in Phoenix."}
{"text":"A little on the expensive side but WOW! Best steak I've ever had. It's the only place I'll go for steak now, I don't see the point of getting steak from Outback or any of the casual places any more. Of course due to the cost, I only go a couple of times a year but that's how good it is...I've drastically cut down on my steak consumption because it's turned me into a steak snob!!  Waiting staff are excellent! The decor is pretty damn cool. In a city is relatively young, it has a sense of history. Love it!"}
{"text":"Best service we have had on this trip. The kids meals are great. Steak excellent.  Love that they have both a 12oz and 16oz ribeye."}
{"text":"The food was fabulous. Our bartender/server Casey was very attentive and friendly. We couldn't ask for anything more. The filet bites on the saloon menu were to die for. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Had the rib eye. It was good. The bread and butter that comes with the meal is amazing! Sweet butter. Yum yum. Wine list non impressive but the bar tender knows his bourbon! I would come here again. Awesome location. Feels historical"}
{"text":"How hard is it to serve a hot baked potato?  Impossible for this place. All 6 people had cold bakers. 1/2 of us had how we ordered the potato prepared incorrectly. That was the best part of the meal.  The steaks, $50 each, were dry, overcooked and completely underwhelming in flavor. For a top priced steakhouse, I wish we'd gone to Golden Corral."}
{"text":"Great steak, I'll take the Stockyards over a Morton's or Fleming's any day.  Both steaks were perfectly cooked and came with a soup/salad and choice of sides, about 80% of which were some form of potato :-)  Cocktail was reasonably priced, though a bit watered down.  Server was super friendly."}
{"text":"Very good option for steak lovers.  Historic restaurant with great service.  Unique dining experience with many options for everyone.  Very easy to get to from all surrounding Phoenix areas.  Definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"Loses star due to price. But the Elk is one of the best meats I ever had! The loaded potato I ate instead of the potato cake which wad perfect size. Meal came with salad too."}
{"text":"I was with my customer on a business trip to Phoenix we visited the stockyards and had a delicious dinner and excellent wait staff I would highly recommend it and definitely will go there again"}
{"text":"I finally got to eat at the Stockyards. They don't believe in an early dinner service like 4 pm. Got there around 7 pm and the place was packed. So I got the NY cut for $45 bucks. Not bad. Did ask for extra bleu cheese for the salad and didn't get that. Not a big deal. Will I go back? I don't know. Kind of overrated."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited stockyards the other night to celebrate his raise. There was plenty of parking and no wait for a table. With all the large roomy booths available, we were stuffed into a tiny one situated right next to another table; oh well. Our server Jeff was really great; heck, even the guy filling up our water was pleasant.   We started by ordering two Manhattan's; they had both Woodford reserve and bookers, kudos for a fine bourbon selection. However, it seems like the bartender really shook up the cocktails instead of stirring them, as they both came out bubbly and watered down. The complementary biscuits, cornbread and relish tray were a nice touch.   As for the rest of the food, I was both impressed and underwhelmed. We ordered the clam chowder that had bacon in it, but sadly it wasn't as amazing as it sounded. The prime rib was amazing, cooked to perfection and melt-in-your-mouth good. The mashed potatoes that accompanied it were bland. We ordered some type of smores in a jar dessert and I wasnt in love.   Overall we had a nice experience, but the prices are really expensive for what I feel you get. We had two Manhattan's, two glasses of wine, 2 entrees and a small dessert for $141. That seems a bit high to me."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic! The meat was cooked just right, and the sides were tasty. I brought clients here for lunch, and we all had various cuts of meat. The decor was also really cool and old western.   Why not 4 stars? The hostess and wait staff were excellent, except one racist remark made by our waiter. The server accidentally filled my Pepsi with tea, no big deal. I flag down the waiter and let him know. In an arrogant and condescending way he says, \"Hard to find good help these days.\" Um...excuse me!? Are we literally in the old west?   Probably would return and give it another shot some day."}
{"text":"Stockyards is an amazing restaurant. You instantly know you're in an ole western  Steakhouse/Supper club when you go in.  Its dimly lit, clean, serving expensive cocktails and red wine with the finest steaks.  There's a reason some restaurants endure the test of time.  I ordered a wedge and filet mignon.  when i was surprised the filet was smaller than I thought, the waiter said if you can give me 7 minutes, I'll fix that.  When my friend ordered a martini, the waiter said with gin or vodka?  The stockyards is on point.  Cant best it value or experience."}
{"text":"I can't rate the food since we were turned away. We walked in with a small group and gave the number in our party. We were asked if we made a reservation, in a snotty tone. We explained that we were from out of town and didn't know we needed a reservation. Again we were rudely told yes and offered no other options. There were plenty of tables open at the time and customer service was no where to be found."}
{"text":"It had been years since we'd dined at the Stockyards, but our out of town family wanted steak, so we found ourselves there a  few days before Christmas. Since I'm not much of a red meat lover I was anxious about the fish options. I needn't have worried. I ordered the salmon and it was cooked to perfection and served nice and hot! My son ordered the half chicken and said it was delicious. The 4 steak eaters were quite happy as well.  Unfortunately I don't remember our server's name, but the service was excellent! He was knowledgeable, very friendly and on the ball. My water glass was never even close to empty (which I truly appreciate because I drink a lot of H2O).  I'm not sure why years had passed without us dining at the Stockyards, but we won't let that happen again."}
{"text":"Service was great and food was even better! I came here with my work colleagues and they handled our group of 17 with ease (we did have a reservation, so that probably helped).  The wine list is quite extensive and offers a good selection. For the whiskey drinkers, they have a special menu for the nice whiskeys. Beer selection was a little weak.   They serve cornmeal biscuit/muffins at the table which were warm but a little too crumbly for my taste. We got the shrimp cocktail and a grilled shrimp plate for appetizers. The shrimp they serve are massive!!  For my main dish, I ordered the bison meatloaf. It comes out with 2 large pieces of the tasty meatloaf (I was only able to eat one), mashed potatoes, and steamed carrots and green beans. The mashed potatoes were positively delicious and my favorite part of the meal.  They have a good dessert menu and after-dinner alcohols. I was too full from the rest of the meal to order dessert though.  It is expensive but a great spot for a special event or a date night where you want to impress."}
{"text":"Awesome steaks. This place has certainly changed over the years. It has recently been updated and given a face lift, but the top rate service and food has remained a constant. The Prime Rib is one of the best in town. Some people are dressed up and others are in Jeans or nice shorts."}
{"text":"Excellent food, pricey, great waitress, empty the night we went. It was well worth the money once."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a great steakhouse, this place is not it. The price is that of a high end steakhouse but not the quality of the meat. I would go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times for lunch and loved it.  I finally came here for dinner with the family, early Mother's Day gift for my MIL.  Loved the old saloon (bar), it is so old west.  We sat in the back room.    Every dinner seating comes with cornbread muffins and baking soda biscuits.  The cornbread had a kick to them, I think some kind of peppers were in them.  The baking soda biscuits were good!!!  The boys had the wild boar and venison sausages for appetizers.  They said it was very very good.  I passed!  We also got the garlic toast for appetizers too.  Yummy, warm, right amount of butter, and not burnt!    I ordered the new york strip with bearniase sauce on the side and parmesan potato stack as the side.  The NY strip was cooked perfectly and tasted very very good.  I liked that I could taste the beef flavor, it was a good cut of meat.  YUM YUM!  The parmeasan potato stack was excellent!  Everyone else enjoyed their meals too (prime rib - cowboy cut, calves liver, top sirlion, and crunchy fried shrimp platter).    We worked our way to dessert too:  Mixed berry shortcake and chocolate chip fudge brownie.  Both desserts were so so so so SO GOOD!"}
{"text":"Service was great as was the food. The ribeye was cooked as ordered, medium rare. Will be back next time I am in town"}
{"text":"Just came for Happy Hour. One tip- stay away from the calf fries on the appetizer menu. Not even sure what it was, but it wasn't good. Some kind of ground something in batter and fried. Calf balls should have texture and flavor. This dish had neither. The free sliders were worth the money.   Beer was cold and the clam chowder was good. , so can't say it was all bad."}
{"text":"Hostess: 1 star.  Stared at us entering in casual clothes then sat us in the middle of the dining room at a table when all but 2 booths were open. When we asked to be seated in a booth she seemed bothered by the request. She did move us, but it was uncomfortable to say the least.    Server: 5 stars. He was friendly,  knowledgeable,  and prompt. He shared a lot of history about the restaurant that was so interesting. Also made great recommendations for our table.   Bussers: 4 stars.  Attentive and also knowledgeable. That's impressive.   Food: 3.5 stars.  Nothing to complain about at all. Steaks were good. Sides were good.  Really loved the Caesar salad. Just wanted to dream of having this meal again, but I won't.   All in all,  I think it's a place with rich history and can appreciate that. I'd return if I was a local,  but wouldn't make this my top steakhouse choice as a traveling foodie."}
{"text":"Loved it! My husband and I decided to come here for our anniversary / Valentine's Day dinner. The food was great! I was looking for a new spot for Prime Rib since Monti's closed. This is it. The prime rib was delicious. The sweet potatos were so good too! They start you off with some veggies and a bread basket which had biscuits and corn bread with a sweet butter that was so yummy! The waiter was very attentive. There were also bus boys that stopped by multiple times to make sure our drinks were full. Again, very impressed with everything about this place. It was a little pricey so I'd recommend it only for special occasions."}
{"text":"I went with my husband last night. The bread and veggie starters we great. The salad had a perfect amount of dressing and the clam chowder was delicious. The onions on top of the soup was tasty. I got the prime rib and my husband had a hamburger. The mashed potatoes were good. The prime rib was to salty. The hamburger was over cooked with no pink. We finished with the bread pudding and cappuccino which were to die for. I wish the beef was cooked better for the price we paid. The service was on point though."}
{"text":"At the recommendation of a friend, I met a client here for lunch.  My client was arriving from out of town and this joint is very conveniently located near the airport.  I guess once upon a time, it was an actual stockyard.  Now, it's an old school restaurant that has a lot of character.  After browsing the menu, I opted for a BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich & Fries, $10.  To wash it down, I ordered Iced Tea.  The Pork Sandwich was awesome, very tasty and a large portion.  You will get full.  The Fries were tasty as well.  My client was impressed with the restaurant and put it on his \"best place near the airport to have a lunch meeting\" list....+++  The service was great and we were able to have a good lunch meeting that left us both satisfied.  Return Factor - 100%"}
{"text":"During a corporate meeting a group of around 20 of us came to the Stockyard on a wednesday evening. I found the atmosphere of the restaurant to be great, and the food top notch. I had the petite filet and it was cooked to perfection. I had the berry shortcake for desert - the home made whipped cream and berries were delightful, but the short cake was a bit overdone and dry. Our servers were efficient and met any special requests/allergies with ease,  but did tend to cross the line a bit when making jokes about it. Overall I would come back here when we are in AZ again because the steak was so good."}
{"text":"An absolutely outstanding restaurant from start to finish. Excellent prime rib. Cut in house every day. Ask for Alice as a server. She knows everything from start to finish.    Would say not to leave Phoenix without visiting."}
{"text":"I use yelp everyday to decide on places to eat, visit, shop, etc but rarely do I wrote reviews. This place definately meet our expectations. I had the special, a mix grill, and it was fantastic. My first time trying elk and the waiter picked up on my nervousness and reassured me that it would be worth it even helping me understand some of the comparisons to excellent cuts of beef. The meal was delicious, even days later as the portions are large and I had to take a to go box; the wait staff was knowledgeable and courteous. 4 stars only for the price. It's hard to swallow $200 for one dinner but 2 entrees and 4 glasses wine later we were definitely fat and happy on our way home."}
{"text":"Considering the price I would not recommend this place. It is in need of a remodel for one thing. It does not have a clean appearance.  The host was wearing worn jeans and a plaid shirt. Not presentable and No other employee was wearing similar clothing so I don't think it was the theme.  The food: ordered a 12 oz prime and it was probably my least fav prime I ever had. Chewy to where I had to just stop eating half way thru my meal. Rice was cold. Best thing we had was the smoked trout appetizer.   Service was really really slow and there was about half of the tables empty.   Again for the price. No thanks."}
{"text":"Restaurant was pretty and had good decor. Shrimp from shrimp cocktail were the biggest I have ever seen but the sauce was a little too spicy. Bread and butter were delicious and I loved that they also provide a free veggie plate with the bread. Ribeye was amazing although the sweet potato was just ok."}
{"text":"Excellent service, atmosphere, and portions! Our waitress was quick and super friendly. We had a salad or soup with two sides that came with our entree. The soup happened to be clam chowder that night and it was amazing! And we also got veggies and bread as a starter. My mom and brother went for happy hour and got some free delicious sliders. Really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"The Stockyards is in the running for the title of \"Phoenix's Original Steakhouse.\" My dad worked here when he was in high school and he is about to turn sixty, if that gives you an idea.   And I think it was my dad's residual loyalty that brought us back here many times during my formative years. It stands out in my mind how friendly and courteous the staff always was, which, as I know now, isn't always easy when you're dealing with little smartasses like I undoubtedly was as a six year old.  As a grown-up, the two things that strike me about the Stockyards are the quality of the food they serve and the authentic feel of the Old West decor. I think the only negative I can think of is its location: almost too close to the airport. Then again, it makes it a perfect \"celebrate someone is back in town\" by picking them up and making the four minute drive over to chow down on some amazing beef."}
{"text":"Good steaks and attentive service."}
{"text":"Still WORTHY! After 40 years, came back and the food, service and ambience same! Which is very reassuring! If it ain't broke, why fix it! Mark, our waiter, was exceptional! His knowledge of the history of the restaurant and area was impressive! Of course, we selected the special he recommended, the bison. Perfect! Needless to say, we were relieved to find out the biscuits, cornbread, steak soup, relish tray was EXACTLY the same as it was 40 years ago! WOW! How refreshing! We've been to many expensive, well-known popular steakhouses in Scottsdale, etc., but they all pale in comparison. We can't wait to return, but at our age, we won't wait so long! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Got in town early, 5 pm, seated quickly and server was here immediately.  Ordered 8 oz prime rib  with Parmesan stack and it was awesome!  Waiter was very professional and prompt."}
{"text":"Great sense of anticipating our needs/wants! The ambience cannot be beat! Service was excellent. Steaks were terrific. Sides just average. We had a vegan for whom they were accommodating. Dessert was great. Salad was average. Soup was average. Overall a pleasant experience. Great place and all very cordial/friendly down home kind of people. This is a do NOT miss place."}
{"text":"this used to be right between  to the phoenix stock yards and cudahy meat packing plant. real western place the bar realy was shiped around the horn.     great steak   order the steak and the best margaretta  any where"}
{"text":"check the hours before you make a visit!  i ordered the new york strip as medium rare.  it came out to perfection.  the seasoning, tenderness was right on.  eventhough i liked my experience i still feel like  i've had better.  it's still a top experience just not the best.  all the history in the restaurant is pretty cool.  if i'm wearing my fat pants i'm not going there to read."}
{"text":"Reasonable prices on food and wine. The steak was great here. Not too many choices on appetizers but i think you go here just for the steak."}
{"text":"Dined here while we were in Phoenix.  We were seated and they brought out a basket of warm corn bread with the menu's. Let me tell you, it was some of the best corn bread I ever had.  As an appetizer we had the Wild Boar and Venison Sausages with Apple-Cranberry Chutney.  The texture of the sausage seemed a bit \"off\" to me, but is was quite tasty.   I had the Porterhouse and my other half had the Petite Filet Mignon. Both were delicious and tender, like a hot knife through butter.  We finished off by sharing a Pecan Pie A La Mode. Delicious.  And the service was super attentive.  I thoroughly recommend this steakhouse."}
{"text":"We were a party of 12 and had a waiter with a very bad attitude.  He is definitely in the wrong business as he made us feel like he really didn't care if we were having a good experience.  It was all about him being rude and condescending."}
{"text":"If you have a meat craving, this is the place to go.  Went there for lunch had the prime rib dip sandwich.  Definitely a sandwich I would go back and order again.  They provide great service.  The place reminded me of a WI supper club.  Definitely will be back for dinner and try one of their steaks."}
{"text":"Warm welcome.clubby atmosphere suits occasion. Sad salad. Good drinks. Amateurish wine list ,Politely hostile waitress. Assurances of USDA prime = 6/10 Smallish ? 20oz.? Porterhouse. Pathetic dull pink rewarmed Prime rib. Dessert very good.No relish tray.Try ClubA in NYC or BobR's backyard for charcoal grilles organic free range grass fed corn finished bone in Heaven . Avoid this place."}
{"text":"Had my wife's birthday dinner at Stockyards because they are participating in Restaurant Week, and so I made reservations for she and I and two of our daughters for this past Wednesday evening.  We arrived about 15 minutes early for dinner, and the hostess already had prepared our table.  We wanted to hit their awesome bar for a drink first though, so she told us not to worry, our table would remain ready whenever we were.  Very cool.    We sauntered on down the long hallway.  I love this bar, classic old west design.  Cozy.  There were a fair number of people, but lots of spots open at the bar, and 2 or 3 bartenders.  I ordered our 4 drinks directly from the bar (2 of the same pinot noir, 1 of Côtes du Rhône, 1 virgin mojito).  Inexplicably, it took 20+ minutes for us to get those drinks at which point we sipped for a few minutes and then I cashed out.    As we sauntered back up the long hallway to the hostess stand around 6:30, I was asked if we'd like to transfer our bar tab to the restaurant.  Now, normally, this is not an option anymore, so I really liked that they offered to do that.  We were immediately seated in the Gammage Booth, and then greeted by our server.   He did a fantastic job and was quite informative, friendly and prompt.  Moreover, there was a separate employee doing nothing but monitoring water levels in our glasses, and he kept them pretty much full at all times.  I would say the service was excellent.    It being restaurant week, I had the $44 prixe fixe where I selected the Stockyards Steak Soup, the Gold Coast Seafood Gratin and the Cheesecake.  The steak soup was dense and so, so good.   I savored every spoonful.  They were generous with the steak!  The seafood gratin, replete with lobster, shrimp, and scallops, baked in a garlic cream sauce, and served with garlic toast with side of their Parmesan Potato Stack was quite rich (I love rich food), and was DELICIOUS.   The seafood was all cooked perfectly and tender.  I ate 100% of what was on my plate.  The potato stack was a fan favorite of the evening too.    My wife and one daughter both ordered the Restaurant Week prixe fixe with a salad and petit filet rare / medium rare.  They both said they loved their salads, and that their steaks were perfectly seasoned and perfectly cooked.  Our youngest daughter decided to try something new and ordered the American Bison Meatloaf, which I of course had to try.   It was deliciously prepared, perfect consistency, massive portion.  She had never before tried bison and was not previously a huge fan of meatloaf in general, but she raved about this dish.  Kudos Stockyards for getting it right!   Wife ordered cheesecake as her desert and daughter ordered pecan pie.  We took all the deserts home.  Daughter subsequently ate her pecan pie and said it was awesome.  We have not yet had the cheesecakes.    All in all, I was a little disappointed in the wait at the bar, but the rest of the experience more than made up for it.  My wife loved her birthday dinner, and everyone loved their meals.  Love the history behind this place, and will definitely do Stockyards again."}
{"text":"Went tonight while on Spring vacation. This restaurant came highly recommended. I am giving two stars for good food. And zero stars for service!!!! So disappointed in our service I can't even tell you. Thursday night. Not that busy. Was a manager on duty?? They never came by? Food forgotten. Drinks went unfilled. Left to sit for long periods of time. Actually said when dropping off check  \"Was everything ok after it all came out?\" BIG surprise he was attentive then!! We saw him more then than we did all night. My husband actually wanted to leave 2%!!  We left ten percent on a $180 bill. While leaving I asked front hostess for something tiny my daughter wanted.... plastic picks of some kind. She went to check and came back and said \"Was your waiter_____? With a beard?\" (I will at least be nice enough to not put his name.) We said yes. She said smiled and said \"Yeah he said we don't have anymore of those.\"  Checkmate.  Anyway. If you want to drop a lot of money and pay a large bill for good food and then 20% tip on top of it for poor service come here. Otherwise I think your money is better spent elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great meal at a reasonable price. Loved the corn bread and the spinach salad.We loved the old west atmosphere and the down home quality of the food. The prime rib was excellent along with the sides of sweet potato mash and regular mashed. Enjoyed the house cab with dinner and the excellent decaf coffee with the chocolate cake. We will go back soon."}
{"text":"Thank you cattle barons of Arizona for this delicious steakhouse! An eating experience starts the minute you walk into the restaurant..... and it was sheer bliss! I'm talking about stained glass panels, a mahogany countertop bar, a 100 year old American flag of when the United States only had 48 states, I'm taking about John Wayne's PERSONAL booth- yes honey! Then we move to the food- the most tender & well seasoned filet mignon & fluffy mashed potatoes, you can't go wrong.  To add the icing to the cake- the sauteed mushrooms- so full of flavor- I could have just eaten that all day!  I thought I couldn't eat another bite, but I just couldn't say \"No\" to the cheesecake! Oh, the strawberry cheesecake is, by far, THE BEST cheesecake I have ever had. It was so rich, moist, & just melted in your mouth. This amazing experience, from start to finish, was courtesy of our server Dan- he is Dan the man! So thoughtful, and full of knowledge of the history of the place, being from Kentucky and all. Just an amazing place to enjoy great food & appreciate some history of Arizona"}
{"text":"What an amazing looking place. When we pulled up we thought we where in for a great steak. Well the steak was very good but the price was more then what we where ready for. $91 for 2 with only water to drink. Not sure it was that good. we did order the prime rib so we did expect to pay for that. The horseradish was lass horseradish then anything else. It had all the bit of mayonnaise. Blah! We where a group of over 10 and yet there was no way for all of us to be at the same table. I got to be at the kids table. (we had no one under the age of 25) The waiter seemed to get upset with us for asking for water. We had been on the road for 3 hours. One of my table mates asked for a pitcher of water if it would make things easer. We where told in no uncertain terms that he would bring plenty of water! For the rest of the evening, for our table at least, he was very cold. Would I go back? Probably not. For me it would have to be the waiters attitude that killed it for me and the rest of us."}
{"text":"My wife and I were celebrating our 13 wedding Anniversary here.  We were greeted with a Smile and a Happy Anniversary Mr. and Misses Kelly.  Your Table is ready, right this way please.  After being seated we were immediately visited by one of the servers and our Drink order was taken.  After looking at the Menu for a few minutes our waitress cam over and asked if there were any questions.  Asked and answered.  We ordered our meals I had the  Prime Rib with a baked potato and a vegetable. along with a salad.  All I can say is that from the salad to the desert this was a GREAT MEAL!!!  The Prime Rib was cooked PERFECTLY the best Prime Rib in AZ. to this point and I have eaten a lot of Prime Rib over the last 13 years.  My Wife had the same meal except she ordered the Rib Eye.  I had the privilege of tasting the Rib Eye and it was great to say the least.  I feel my wife and I  will become regulars at the Stockyards Restaurant.  Our Dinner came to approximately $140.00 and I left a $50.00 tip.  Thank You Stockyards Restaurant."}
{"text":"It was real treat finding a local restaurant with so much history and tradition. The Stockyard is a landmark and I'm so glad I dined here!  Our waiter was really informative since he's a native of Phoenix and knew the history behind this establishment. Check out the the beautiful hand carved Mahogany bar in the saloon. It's pretty amazing that this sits on what use to be the largest cattle auction stockyard in North America. This stockyard would pass 40,000 cattle through here per daily during cattle auctions.  Enough history on with the food.  I made reservations for 7:00 pm and we were seated at a plush leather booth. I really enjoyed the decor here from the stain glass to the large ceiling lamps which contained hanging branding irons.   We were greeted with a relish dish, baking soda biscuits and corn poblano muffins.  The raw veggies were fresh served with ranch dressing and the biscuits and muffins were warm and incredibly delish.  For my main entree I chose the 12 oz prime rib which actually seemed larger and was a thick cut. The entree included soup or salad and a side which is a rarity now a days with all the absurd priced Ala ca rte steak houses. The house salad was solid and the blue cheese dressing delicious. My prime rib was cooked to perfection - medium rare with hot Au Jus and the potato gratin was also delish.  Currently The Stockyard was offering the centennial dinner which was a bargain at $40.00 it included a incredible tasting pear salad, campfire sirloin steak with whiskey peppercorn sauce, grits, cowboy chili made with Chorizo and roasted corn. The dinner included dessert and we went with the warm pecan pie with bourbon flavored whip cream - OMG it was the BOMB!  Overall a great dinning experience with excellent service and quality. I would definitely return here again."}
{"text":"Awesome steakhouse deserving of the 5 stars for the atmosphere/service and the chateubriand for two.  First, the atmosphere.  If cowboys went to a black tie dinner, they would feel right at home here - formal yet rustic at the same time.  Nice dim lighting, great for a date (my wife agreed).  Service was phenomenal - prompt, courteous, just attentive enough without getting overwhelming.  I am still not sure whether the complimentary veggie plate or the awesome cornbread were on our table when we sat down or if they were brought out later but they were already there when I wanted them at just the right temperature.  Now on to the chateaubriand - to me this is their staple as I have not seen this cut in Arizona yet.  This is basically a large cut of tenderloin, too large for one person, hence offered on a large plate cut for two with different veggies, potatoes and mushrooms.  To me this was the best non-Kobe steak I've head in a long time - tender as a filet mignon but with more meat flavor.  My wife and I were barely able to finish it just because of the sheer amount of food - but it was so amazing that we did.  I've heard that things at this place can be hit or miss, but to me the chateaubriand is an awesome hit, so can't go wrong with this.  Throw in the amazingly attentive service and the nice atmosphere and this is one great steakhouse to visit."}
{"text":"Was invited to dinner here by a good friend, part of a group of 7. The service was top notch and we immediately got our basket of fresh tasty warm biscuits and corn bread. For appetizers we got Onion Rings and Shrimp Cocktail. Excellent. For main, wifey chose the Prime Rib, grilled \"Stockyards\" style, she says it was fantastic. I tried the Rib Eye and this was one of the better steaks I've had in recent memory. Everyone loved everything served and was a great dinner. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great experience at lunch here! Yummy steaks, good wine selection and very friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Attentive service. Delicious Ribeye. Would have had prime rib but was gone. I bet it's good too."}
{"text":"We arrived in the area early to drop my sister-in-law off at the Phx Airport and decided to try something new. We arrived early and were escorted to our table by lovely hostess without delay.    Our waiter John was polite, helpful and the entire staff was attentive without being obtrusive.  I went with the recommended seafood chowder as John explained the chef was from Boston and knows how to make an excellent chowder.  It was thick, packed with seafood and was really tasty, but was not like other chowders I enjoyed while visiting the Boston area. I also ordered a salad with the recommended orange balsamic dressing (not really a fan).    The Ribeye was excellent, as was the baked potato although it was rather small. Desert consisted of chocolate cake that would have been excellent with a red wine if I had more time to indulge...  Overall we were glad we experienced it, however there was a birthday party two tables over. The staff delivered a cake with several candles and thankfully they didn't sing, but some obnoxious female in their party did and we understood when another large party got up from their table and left the restaurant before ordering. She was loud and was not entertaining. The staff was great, it's too bad the patrons weren't.   Overall this is a great restaurant with an incredible bar. They do have private rooms for parties and the atmosphere is really nice. Everything was clean including the restrooms. It is a little pricey, but not unreasonable considering the level of service, quality of the food and the atmosphere. We will be back, hopefully not at the same time as the singing patron."}
{"text":"We ate here and had the ribs which were very good and had a lot of meat and I had a side of soup that was no joking the best soup I've had in my life, I believe it was called seafood chowder. I could've eaten that as a whole meal! I'm told the cook that made it was from Boston. Delicious! Great job with the soup!"}
{"text":"Celebrated my birthday here and we couldn't of selected a better restaurant in Arizona. A true authentic piece of Arizona history and a complete gem through and through. From the point we entered the restaurant we were greeted by the hostess whom immediately wished me a happy birthday. We had a few drinks in the bar. First of all the bar is stunning, bartender was great I believe his name was Harry. Once seated for dinner the experience was personal and intimate. In a dining room completely full this is hard to do but with the superior  professionalism of our waiter John he made it seem easy. I have truly never been that impressed with a waiter as he remained connected with our table the entire time. Even down to the bus boys working in perfect order in the dining room to ensure the optimal experience for all. The food LORD where do I start, we had venice sausage with cranberry and apple chutney, prime rib, bison rib eye, and NY strip ABSOLUTELY cooked to perfection and AMAZING. The clam chowder is simply to die for. The chili is on point. The potato stack a taste buds delight. When you  think it can't  get better along comes the pecan pie and cheescake. From the time you enter to the time you leave the entire staff makes you feel like family. Hands down the best money I have spent on a meal. Deserves more than five copper stars. We were exceedingly pleased and can't wait to return!!! A perfect gem!!!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place but the service we experienced here was awful and soured everything. It didn't start off bad, we made reservations and the hostess was friendly. She seated us promptly in a nice comfy booth and we received a breadbasket with crudités to munch on. When our waiter came to take our orders, we informed him we'd be ordering off the Restaurant Week menu and he made this face of dismay and haughty superiority. Apparently Restaurant Week offended our waiter? This is where it went downhill as from here on out, our waiter had an attitude.   As a first course, we had the option of salad or soup. We asked if we could have Caesar dressing on our salad and at first the waiter looked upset that we'd make such a request and looked ready to refuse but relented and said yes. However we found out later that this was an additional charge that he did not mention to us. (Extra $10, really?) The salad was average, nothing to write home about.   For our second course, both of us ordered the prime rib with creamed horseradish, which was disappointing. (Again, when placing our order, the waiter seemed really upset - like we were asking him to butcher the cow and then cook us the meal himself.) The prime rib was average thickness, about half an inch and a rather large portion, but the flavor was lackluster. Even the horseradish, which my husband loves, didn't help.   For dessert, I ordered the chocolate mousse and my husband ordered the cheesecake. I wasn't very impressed with the mousse as it had a citrusy flavor - which was not mentioned on the menu and ruined it for me. (I like my mousse decadent - a deep chocolate flavor. This wasn't.) The cheesecake was good, but my husband would eat any cheesecake.  Then, we waited. And we waited. The waiter had disappeared on us! We waited for a good 20 minutes before we saw him anywhere near our table. My husband had to flag him down and request our bill. Again, the waiter looked like we were asking him to chop down a tree, make both the paper and ink, and then write our receipt in calligraphy. After a few minutes, he came back with our bill and promptly disappeared again. We were shocked to see the extra fee for our salads, as it wasn't explained to us (we would have been fine if it was expressed to us) but unfortunately we couldn't find our waiter. Obviously we couldn't use our credit card (no waiter to process the card) and we had enough cash to pay for the meal plus tip. This is the first time we ever did not want to leave a tip but lucky for this waiter we felt so unwanted that we just dropped our cash and left.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Came here for the Arizona restaurant week deal. We both had the prime rib and really enjoyed the steaks. The soups for appetizers, chili and chowder were both excellent. Finished with the cheesecake which was very good. Service was excellent.  Saving the pecan pie for home."}
{"text":"Okay, I haven't been here in years and had been wanting to check out the area \"stockyards\" again since.  So Arizona Restaurant Week had them on their list and I thought, 'what better reason is there to go than this?\" Maybe it was the option I chose but I wasn't very impressed.  Don't get me wrong, the food was good but I was hoping for something more like the meal I've had at the Silver Spur in Tucson (OMG -Gooooooood stuff).  My prime rib was a small portion and seemed to have a lot more fat than mere marbeling.  The sweet potatoes were okay but heck, just leave 'em in the skin and serve 'em if you're not going to make them something special. Cornbread and Baking Powder Biscuits served before the meal were fine, but I make better cornbread right out of the box.  And what do they mix in the butter that created red looking drips?  Honey? I liked the crudites - cukes, jicama, celery, carrots, black olives.  My son, who happens to be a good eater, ordered the rack of ribs and hardly got through half the rack.  He said he was hungry but apparently didn't like the flavor. And he was about as impressed with the sweet potatoes as I was.  Desert was alright. Brownies a al mode for myself and son and hubby had the shortcake.  The special online menu that I viewed said it was mixed berries but the server said strawberry -that's what he got, strawberry.  It was all fine but I just felt that being one of the restaurants on the Arizona Restaurant Week meant those businesses were out to impress. I just wasn't impressed.  I love steak but about the only time I order it when I'm out is when we're at a steakhouse.    Love the decor and the history of the place.  Service was fine -except when I asked for a couple of biscuits to be thrown in with my leftovers.  That didn't happen."}
{"text":"Worst Steak house I have ever been to! The steak had absolutely no flavor and was very chewy! The steak came out with gravy on it! Disgusting. Mashed potatoes tasted like they were instant potatoes. Service was poor and we will not be going back! You can get a better steak from outback or Applebees and save yourself some money. I'm all for paying for a good steak from Ruth Chris, Morton's or Donovan's but the Stockyards is the worst I have ever had! The area isn't safe either. There was a customer whose truck window was broken and items stolen from his vehicle. Stay Away!!!"}
{"text":"Taste just as the Southwest should when you get steak. Yes you could go other places and possibly get more flavor from all the stuff that is pilled on top but this place is for the steak lovers out there who like a good cut cooked just right!"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with their shave prime rib sandwich! It is so moist and flavorful. Their portion is large so you won't leave unsatisfied. For a lighter option, get their Caesar salad with filet mignon or just the prime rib (and skip the creamy delicious mashed potato)."}
{"text":"I was skeptical about dining here. We weren't dressed appropriately , and looked liked 5 miles of bad road. But, we were greeted warmly, seated promptly and our waiter was very friendly and knowledgeable. It was very hard to decide what to order because everything sounded amazing. The charcuterie they bring prior to your meal is excellent and the bread was lovely. He ordered the big prime rib, and it was the most tender, well seasoned piece of prime rib he had ever had. I had the beef and reef (filet and seafood gratin) and it was so rich and delicious.  We had the citrus burnt creme for dessert, and it was better than perfect...we split it, but wish that we hadn't. I wanted my own :)"}
{"text":"Great food! My wife and I visiting one of our daughters here in Phoenix. Went out and enjoyed ourselves. Started with an appetizer of Boar and Venison Sausage;  excellent.  My wife and I ordered 2 Top Sirloins which we both couldn't finish and they came with a Salad and a side. Our Daughter ordered the Pear Salad topped with a Steak Filet. And we all shared a Chocolate Mousse. Expensive and worth it! Phenomenal service.   John our Server was excellent."}
{"text":"The waiter was fantastic - great sense of humor and attentive without being overbearing.  The lunch menu had a lot of interesting items.  I got the wild rice and turkey soup - yum with a nice spiciness to it.  The buffalo meatloaf was delish and the texas toast topped it all off nicely.  My co-worker got the western dip (they dont serve french food) and liked it a lot as well."}
{"text":"We come here every time we are in town. Great food and service. Do dinner in dining rooms. Bar is noisy. Kent took care of us tonight and is a professional and personable. Will be back."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. I don't generally like \"fancy\" restaurants but this one is different. Not white table cloth, but conservative style, old fashioned, almost western like.   Excellent food. I got the 16oz ribeye.   Wasn't as expensive as I was expecting.   We will be back."}
{"text":"The Stockyards 5009 E. Washington Phoenix, Arizona  85034  Companion and I arrived at 5:30 to try the menu for Phoenix Restaurant week. While this is created by and supported by the Phoenix Restaurant Association, each restaurant creates its own special menu which has 3 appetizers, 3 main courses, and 3 desserts on it at a prix fixe. The idea is for people to try the food at a special price. Of course, some places provide less than their usual portion size or quality just to get customers in unfortunately.  We were seated immediately as we had a reservation (recommended). Our waiter was extremely nice and friendly. When we found that there was a problem with our table rocking, our waiter arranged for us to go to another table in a different section of a different waiter. This is true customer service. Our new waiter was just as nice and friendly as the first one was.   A basket of warm biscuits and corn bread muffins was brought to the table and was served with honey butter with a drizzle of honey on top of it. The first basket was emptied in short order. I ordered a Beefeater martini, and it was made to perfection with a double olive as I asked for and just a wave of the vermouth bottle over the glass. It was ice cold and really started the meal off nicely. Companion just asked for a Shirley Temple to start with and received it in short order.  Next were the appetizers. I ordered the house salad with honey mustard dressing. I was pleasantly surprised that the dressing coated all the salad and wasn't just drizzled on top. The other surprise was the slices of ripe tomato on the plate instead of the requisite cherry tomato that most places put on their salads. Companion ordered the tomato soup, which was nothing like Campbell's! It almost seemed to be made on a minestrone base and was definitely not something from a local purveyor. While companion felt the soup wasn't what they wanted, I tasted it and found it to be delicious and well made.  At this point, companion decided to order an alcoholic drink that is old time and that is often used as a test of how good a bartender is. A Brandy Alexander was ordered, and other than being presented in the wrong glass, had the proper taste. A touch of nutmeg on top was all that was missing. It should be noted here that the drinks have a full pour in them - no skimping here.  For our main course, we both ordered the prime rib. Mine rare, and companions medium well. I ordered the veggies with mine instead of a starch, and companion ordered a starch. The slabs of beautiful beef came out cooked exactly as we asked for, and the veggies (Pattie pan squash, slivered carrots and baby zucchini) were perfectly cooked. No limp, soggy veggies here. They were delicious, as was of course, the meat. Everything came with the proper accoutrements and was nice and hot.  For dessert, we both ordered the cheesecake with berries. Companion asked for some whisky whipped cream as well and was happily accommodated. The cheesecake was tall, dense, and a large flavorful portion. Doggie bags were brought home, and if the dog touches it he's in trouble!  The restaurant was clean and efficient though just a bit loud. My only ding is the use of serrated knives. With a beautiful cut of beef, one does not need a serrated knife which tears the meat apart. Just a nice sharp knife will do nicely.  5 stars for excellent food, great service, overall cleanliness, and an honest barkeep."}
{"text":"They don't do anything fancy but DAMN they do a great job with steaks. great basic meat and potatoes dishes. Food tasted great the warm bread and flavored butter, superb.  Would get 5 star but the prices seemed a bit high. wish I could go 4.5"}
{"text":"Staff is on point!! Dinner was phenomenal... the pricing not so much, so I won't be back. But to try it once I say yes!"}
{"text":"Visiting from Cali... ordered the Chopped Steak which was delicious. The service is excellent and the place is very clean. The only little set back, is that the prices on the steals are on the high side, but other than that it's a must to come and visit."}
{"text":"The filet Mignon was cooked perfectly and I had no complaints. It was a good steakhouse. Reservations are probably a good idea as it was busy. Casual atmosphere, seemed kid friendly.  ***** The staff deserve 5 stars. VERY professional. *****"}
{"text":"My boyfriend found this place by reading the inflight mag on Southwest. It hit all the right buttons; old school, steak, close to the airport. I was surprised I hadn't gone here before. I was born in Tucson & much of my family lives in Phoenix so we've visited AZ 1000's of times. The Stockyards has been here since 1947! Well, better late than never. Luckily we made it in time to have lunch before they closed for dinner prep. OK, I'll cut to the chase. Everything was delicious! Were we super hungry? Yes! But, the food was really good no matter what! I think we went with the prime rib & rib eye. Each came with excellent mashed potatoes & squash. The BF isn't a fan of squash but he enjoyed this. They were cooked al dente and chopped into very small diced cubes, sautéed with onions probably. We shared a tasty Spinach Salad. Service perfect, bar appreciated, atmosphere clean, classy but not snobby. Prices are typical steakhouse & worth it. Stockyards, where have you been all my life? And can you open in The OC?"}
{"text":"The steak was burnt on top and bottom and pieces were uneatable. When I mentioned this to the waiter he was flippant and said, \"That comes along with eating in the oldest steakhouse in the area and with the oldest grill.\" With the price we paid for the steaks, I would have thought they would have been cooked the way we wanted them and not brushed off. Even though the steaks were quality, the way they were cooked ruined them."}
{"text":"so we went for restaurant week yesterday.  someone in our group found a roach in their water glass.  it likely came from the refill pitcher.  photo is attached.  mistakes happen.  roaches happen.  seriously, we were pretty forgiving and nice about it.  what irks me is that they didn't go out of their way to make it right.  no manager came to apologize, they didn't give us any comp or discount, just a \"that has never happened before\" and an apology from the waiter.  we even had to specifically request that they replace all the water glasses at the table since they were all refilled from the same pitcher.  that was somehow not intuitive to the staff there.  as for the other customers who drank from that pitcher?  well....  i could go on about the poorly seared steak and the mediocre food, but the roach issue sort of trumps them all.  food aside, this is supposed to be a classy joint, and i think i would've had a better service response at a fast food chain."}
{"text":"Hubby and I had an amazing dinner tonight, and we went with the Arizona Restaurant Week menu.  To start, I had the house salad w/honey mustard dressing and he had the seafood chowder.  Both were wonderful starts to our meal, of course after scarfing down the biscuits, muffins and crudite that they serve when you first sit down.  For our entrees, we both went with the filet mignon and parmesan potato gratin stack.  The steaks were cooked to perfection, the bearnaise sauce was killer and the potatoes were incredible!  I'd never had those before, and will definitely be getting them anytime we dine here.  The ARW menu included dessert, and we weren't disappointed.  Hubby got the pecan pie and I got the chocolate mousse.  What a wonderful way to finish off our meal.  Everything was delicious, the service was spot-on and the atmosphere of the dining room was somewhat romantic.  We had only sat in the front dining room on previous visits, but this time, we were escorted to the back dining room (past the bar) where we were met with soft lighting and old-fashioned murals on the walls, which seemed to transport us to a time long ago.  What a wonderful night!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here with my husband, his nephew and girlfriend for dinner last week. It was nephew's birthday and he loves steak so I wanted to take him special. Since this was the oldest steakhouse in Phoenix and a historical landmark for the city, it fit the bill. We all enjoyed our meals. My fillet was cooked perfectly. Nephew said his ribeye was a little salty but personally I enjoy some seasoning on my steak. I don't like it when places serve it totally plain... or worse, with a bunch of butter. A steak should be juicy enough to stand on its own with just a little salt and pepper to enhance the flavor. I did enjoy that we also got a very rich and beefy demi-glace as well (served on the side). I also liked that you get your choice of starch included with the steak as well as a soup or salad. I ordered the sweet potato mash which unfortunately I did not care for at all. There was something off about the taste and it wasn't as smooth whipped as I would have liked. I did really love the soup, though. That night it was a cremini mushroom bisque that was delectable. It would have gone really well with a good earthy red wine but unfortunately I wasn't drinking that night. Other people at the table enjoyed a few beers. They have the usual domestic and European choices as well as some taps from local Sonoran Brewing Company. For dessert hubby and I split the strawberry shortcake and they also brought out a chocolate brownie a la mode for my nephew. So nice!  Overall, maybe the food was only worth about three stars but checking out the old photos of downtown Phoenix and all the cowboy art on the wall made it a cool experience. I really liked the old school saloon as well. This is definitely someplace every Phoenician should come at least once."}
{"text":"Had an awesome lunch. Waiter had no personality, hard to hear and zero energy. The shave ribeye & cheddar was amazing."}
{"text":"After talking about it all summer, we finally met our favorite friends for happy hour in the saloon.  Enjoyed the discounted drinks specials AND the complimentary sliders.  Free food?  Who does that any more?  This place does!  Didn't really need to, but ordered the filet bites, onion rings, and the calf fries.  Girls didn't like the calf fries as much as I thought they would. :)  Would have been ok with just easting a few sliders, but we figured what the heck!  Great Phoenix landmark and a great way to spend a happy hour."}
{"text":"I ate a pound of prime rib, some mashed sweet potato, and a hefty piece of pecan pie yesterday. Ay dios mio! We came here for the restaurant week menu and left with full bellies and pleasant memories.   For $44 you have your choice of soup or salad, entree and dessert. I had the salad, prime rib, and pecan pie. The salad was your basic salad, but I did enjoy the orange vinaigrette that it came with. I tried some chowder and chili which were both rich and well seasoned. In addition to the prime rib you have your choice of 8 oz filet mignon or seafood gratin. The inner pig in me couldn't resist a full pound of meat so I went with the meatiest, biggest option. I requested the prime rib medium rare and it came out closer to medium but it was still enjoyable and tender. I do think that the best prime rib in town is probably at Durant's but the portions here were amazing. You have your choice of starch or vegetable to go with your meal, I went with the mashed sweet potatoes. They had a light texture and went well with the beef.  Dessert was a sizable slice of pecan pie for me, although there were additional choices of sour cream cheese cake and chocolate cake. The pie was super sweet but the filling was a good consistency and filled with a lot of pecans. The whipped cream on top helped to disperse some of the sugary sweetness of the pie.   Service was excellent. Our server was friendly and drinks and plates were taken away as needed.   Overall it was a very nice experience here and The Stockyards is a great place for your beef-fueled needs."}
{"text":"I have wanted to go to the Stockyard, but had not previously had the pleasure. I don't want to drive back toward work and try a pricey restaurant that might not be worth the trip. Rachael Ray recommends trying a place for lunch when it is cheaper and less of a wait - so that is what I did today. One area where Rachael's advice was incorrect was the wait - Friday during lunch was very busy. When I entered the host recommended that I go to the bar because the dining area was already full. The bar contains seating as well as seats at the bar itself.  With the available seating taken, I bellied up to the bar at looked over the lunch menu. A positive note is that the menu is the same in the bar as the dining room. Being during work hours I could not enjoy items from the behind the bar, but the guys just down the bar from me were ordering and I was excited to learn the Stockyard has Moose Drool on tap. Instead, I had the diet Pepsi.  When the waitress asked if I was ready and I indicated not yet, I didn't realize that might be my only opportunity. I imagined she would only serve those at the bar; however, she also worked the room behind the bar and was constantly running back and forth. It took about 15-20 minutes, but eventually she returned to take my order. I went with the Grilled New York Strip Steak Sandwich. I don't know if the recession has caused a bread shortage, it is homage to Dr. Atkins or Webster has changed the definition of \"sandwich\", but typically I picture two pieces of bread surrounding the integral ingredient. Last week @ Robbie Fox's I was surprised that a sandwich came open faced. With the Stockyard menu providing a heading of \"Sandwiches\" and the brisket sandwich being called \"Open Faced BBQ Beef Brisket\", I foolishly assumed the other items not named \"Open Faced\" would have two pieces of bread. Not so. The sandwich arrived in about 10 minutes and was served on a single piece of bread with a side order of fries. Hmmm. That said, it was a regular sized steak - and for $15 a descent price. The steak itself was among the best I have ever tried. Tender, juicy and flavorful. The fries were crisp and tasty.   Although I am not a fan of Westerns, the bar had a nice feel. A copper cash register in the back corner with a picture of John Wayne to the waitress' attire and appearance screamed Old West. It had a nice feel. I don't blame the waitress for slow service because she was hustling the entire time. I think management needs to monitor customer flow and if it is busy on a Friday afternoon, there should be a server working that room and letting the bartender focus on  the bar and the libations.   The dinner menu escalates in price, but given what I had for lunch, the history and the atmosphere, I would like to come back and experience dinner in the dining room or maybe spend a quiet evening at the bar enjoying a Moose Drool or two."}
{"text":"This steak house has very nice steaks and also a good wine selection. Our waiter was very theatrical and at least had me entertained. I do think they are a bit overpriced and hence my three star. The steaks were good but I wouldn't call it  phenomenal."}
{"text":"This was a great experience.  Went on a Sunday evening.  Had drinks at the bar then moved to the dining room for dinner.  Fantastic service all the way around.  Well worth the cost."}
{"text":"So good! The biscuits are amazing, and I highly recommend the filet. We learned that they butcher a couple cuts including the filet at the restaurant. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"My first visit to this steakhouse was a company lunch.  The sandwich I had was pretty darn good, the salads my coworkers got looked pretty decent albeit with too little meat proportional to the amount of veggies, in my opinion, but I wish my experience with this restaurant ended here.  After the luncheon, I decided to bring my boyfriend here for his birthday, and well, I was sorely disappointed.  That amazing sandwich I had had before wasn't on the dinner menu, but that's to be expected.  What truly annoyed me, and leads me to write this one star review, was the snooty service.  We were given the smallest table in the room, with servers walking right behind me, in and out of the kitchen, and treated as if our patronage didn't matter because we looked like college students.  Of course, they might just have had horrible service in general and our age had nothing to do with it because I did hear an elderly couple nearby complain about their service as well.  But hey, this was just my experience, and you might have better luck than I did.  Though I'd recommend The Keg over Stockyards any day."}
{"text":"Here on business a lot and decided to check this place out after a long day. The venue looks very upscale. However the patrons were in attire ranging from jeans and sneakers to heels and dresses.   I sat at the bar and was attended to fairly quickly. I ordered the 5oz filet, it comes with a potato of choice (I went with the baked potato) and a choice of soup or salad. I chose salad considering the rest of my meal was going to be fairly heavy.   They brought out complimentary jalapeño corn bread and honey butter along with an array of vegetables and dip (extra points for being creative). The cornbread was phenomenal. This could have been because I was starving, but it took a lot of will power to eat only a half of one.   The salad was nothing special, just a house salad, but it was fresh and the homemade balsamic was really good.  The filet was tender, juicy and flavored perfectly. I thoroughly enjoyed every bite. The baked potato was a bit too loaded. I'd guess at least 1/3rd cup of butter. I scooped most of it off but I don't even want to begin to think about how many delicious calories I consumed there. My suggestion would be to ask for butter on the side so you can control how much goes on.   The guy at the bar next to me convinced me to have a nightcap. I chose the Guinness. It was on top and well, it tasted like Guinness.   The service was good. Ambiance was calm, inviting and romantic. Food was great! The price was extremely reasonable.   I will definitely be back and recommend this place to my fellow business travelers staying at the numerous hotels surrounding this joint."}
{"text":"Excellent from top to bottom. Our waiter made the meal. He was a very dramatic verbal wizard. He knew the menu cold and just said things as if on stage.   The food was cooked perfectly. I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"I take a host of clients here for lunch and dinner for the simple fact that the service is great, food is tasty, and you feel like it's an appropriate place to discuss business (not a fast food operation). They have been at this location for a very long time and have grown with it. I was actually here on Monday night with a group for business. They are always accommodating in securing a large party and have the wait staff to provide more than one server when needed. From start to finish the meal was superb. We started with a Cajun array of shrimp, bread, and rice along with shrimp cocktails, then moved to the main course which I had the half chicken which was cooker to perfection (a host of other restraints seem to over cook the chicken and dry out the meat), had some desert which they offer a great selection to choose from. Also, if it is within your budget you must try the Caymus wine, pairs well with numerous dishes."}
{"text":"We had nice Mother's Day dinner here last night. Service was great , I don't remember the last time we had such an attentive server , he had excellent knowledge of wines as well. Food was made to order and we saved some place for deserts. My only complaint would be very short appetizer menu."}
{"text":"We came for our anniversary dinner and the employees made us feel very welcomed :) they brought out the bread and veggies instantly and took our drink order. Alex or Alexis was our waitress and she did an excellent job telling us about the history of the building which we enjoyed hearing. We ordered the Gold Coast Seafood Gratin as our appetizer which was delicious! Although, we did wish there was more lobster. The prime rib was cooked to our orders perfectly and came with a soup of the day (which was clam chowder). The horse radish and an jus fit perfectly in combination to our meal. I ordered the Parmesan potato stack as my side and my girlfriend ordered the Whiskey sweet potatoes as her side.   Complimentary of our anniversary, they brought out strawberry short cake for our dessert!   Overall, we had a really fun time dining here and it was interesting looking at all of the historical photos displayed on their walls as we left."}
{"text":"Glad I stopped by in Phoenix... Best cut of bison, I've ever had... Not to mention the service being spot-on and everything else being tasty."}
{"text":"The food is delicious but too pricey for portions served. Waiter was a bit stuffy. Wouldn't recommend this restaurant unless you have lots of money and don't mind spending it."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the Stockyards Restaurant. It's a vintage steakhouse located in the area where the old Phoenix Stockyards used to be. The atmosphere is classic. Dark wood, heavily padded booths, a magnificent bar. I love the places that have the \"wedge\" salad, and the one at the Stockyards is very good. My steak was cooked perfectly, and was also very good. I had the whiskey mashed sweet potatoes as my side, and they were a treat. I went on a Monday night, and it was very busy. But the service was excellent.  It's a bit pricey, but sometimes you've just got the urge for a good steak, and deserve to spoil yourself."}
{"text":"This place was amazing!  Food was excellent and the atmosphere was very unique! Loved the veggies!"}
{"text":"Great premium steak house. Top notch food with top notch service. Very popular, need a reservation unless you are by yourself and can sit at a bar table. Fresh hot biscuits and cornbread and veggies with dip with every meal. Classic cuts of beef cooked to perfection. Great sides, and nice atmosphere. Walkable from the hotels."}
{"text":"We arrived at the door at 9:04pm and we were told that they closed at 9pm. Our party of 5 went elsewhere. Hard to below they could not use the extra business. Very short sighted imho."}
{"text":"Everything about our experience there tonight exceeded our expectations. Veggie dish and bread were brought to our table quickly. Nice touch. The waitress was knowledgeable, friendly (but authentically and not overly), accommodating, and professional! The timing of every part of the meal was perfect. We even got to finish our salads before the main course was served--a lost art today. The food was hot, and prepared exactly as we ordered it (oh, and delicious). Every staff member we encountered was friendly, helpful and unobtrusive when it mattered. We ordered pretty standard cocktails, but they were better tasting than most. Extensive wine list. What a pleasure to have such a fantastic restaurant experience in this \"fast food\" age."}
{"text":"Stockyards is the best of the best, of the best with honors.  This is the real deal, the food is about as amazing as the history and the décor.  All the way down the to ATM in the parking lot, which is a landmark by the way.  Never before or since have I had a steak prepared so perfectly.  Stockyards is where you take your in-laws to be, you bring that next big client here, and it'll be the talk of the week in their circle of friends."}
{"text":"Get the new york strip sandwhich for lunch, awesome. Great business lunch place"}
{"text":"I was in Phoenix around two weeks ago, and the first stop I made along with my husband was to Stockyards Restaurant. This establishment is historical and has been around forty-seven years! A steakhouse rated as one of the 85 best restaurants in Phoenix, I was eager to try it as soon as our plane touched down. It was even mentioned in the in flight magazine as one of the best steakhouses in the United States.  Upon our arrival, we found that Stockyards was located in a more industrial section of the city, not downtown. It had a more formal feel with historical photos of the stockyards on the walls and a saloon, but not in the touristy sense, more somber and dark. Our waiter was attentive and had a great sense of humor. I think he may have been mentioned in other Yelpers' reviews. Now for the food...I had a beef brisket sandwich with many slices of lean meat on it. The meat was smothered in barbecue sauce, which had a flavor I was not wild about. My sandwich was accompanied by a large helping of fries, tasty and crispy. My husband ordered the steak sandwich. When it arrived it was a large juicy steak, but served open-faced. My husband didn't like this. In fact, he requested a another piece of sandwich roll for the top. The steak was ultimatey too chewy to eat in this fashion, and had to be cut in pieces with a knife. In other words, the steak was not very tender. His meal also came with fries. Our waiter had recommended a roast beef and cheddar sandwich that is a Stockyards specialty instead, but my husband did not listen to him!  Overall, I would give Stockyards a solid three stars. It did not quite live up to our expectations, but it was not bad, either. The sandwiches we had at the Oak Creek Brewery in Sedona were way better, however."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been here for many years, this is my first visit, I of course found it on Yelp. Great steak house, from the bread to the dessert, wonderful.  It is now on my list to visit every time I visit Phoenix. Old style steak house, where deals are made and the steaks are great."}
{"text":"This is my go to steakhouse. Been here many of times and always enjoy my time here. This time we came here with a large group. They basically have a large main dining area, a smaller back group which is quieter, and the bar area. Not too many people hang out in the bar area so it's pretty quiet there. Today we got all the tables in the bar area so it was almost like a semi private party.   They start you off with their jalapeño muffins and raw vegetable tray. Everything is so good but I always have to watch myself cause I don't want to fill my self up. Next came their seafood chowder. One of my favorites. It is so good. All I remember is the salmon in there but I know other seafood is in there.   I ordered the 16oz ribeye with a baked potato. The ribeye was cooked perfect. Juicy. Not too much fat and just melt in your mouth meat. I'm an fan as you can tell.   My wife tried the buffalo meatloaf and she really loved it. I stole a bite and it was so tender and smooth. Really liked it with that gravy. She had sweet potato mash and grilled vegetables. The veggies where cooked perfect and tender. It's a really good dish.   To top it off I had the pecan pie. It's was good but I had better. Taking nothing away from this pie. It was really good and not to sweet with a nice flaky crust.   Our service was great. Got our drink orders and always filled out glasses without being asked. We had one person at our table who had there steak cooked a little too much for their liking and they made no fuss about it and brought her another one while continuing to apologize to her.   So I've been here and had multiple ribeye, prime rib, and baby back ribs and it's all really good. The reason I like this place is they give you so much for your money. If you go to those other steakhouse you got to pay for all your sides and appetizer. Here you get a soup or salad and a potato side. Well worth the money. Of course, I'll be back."}
{"text":"02.08.10  This place is super old school, down to the waiters.  It's like I stepped back in time, in a very good way.  According to our Southwest in flight magazine, Spirit, this is one of the best steakhouses in the US.  I'm glad I got to try it!  I had the prime rib [http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jZ8ogksrNzUmREJggc1YOQ?select=uhk-7dQUEY6biQk7i8zZ7g] and the others had the filet mignon ceasar [http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jZ8ogksrNzUmREJggc1YOQ?select=sFNlHqzPuqrBhvNkCxUD6Q].  The prime rib came out perfectly.  Juicy, tender, extra au jus sauce for the dipping.  No complaints!  The filet mignon came out a bit overdone, I've been told.  Order down!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to the Stockyards for more years than I care to admit.  Every time I been here it was always above average.  Never Steak 44 or Durant's quality, but good.   Came for a special occasion with my ex-wife, her daughter, boyfriend and 4 month old granddaughter.  Seated promptly and had a very nice, though overly solicitous waiter.  Just trying too hard, but nice enough.  We had a range of food from my ribeye, MJ's prime rib, Corey's filet and Molly's chicken.  Summer, the grandbaby, scarfed the relish bowl of celery and other wonderful finger food. However, my rib eye was a thin cut, dry and basically tasteless.  I've had better at Black Angus for half the price. At the prices Stockyards charges, it should be a prime cut prepared well.  Not tonight."}
{"text":"Arizona's Class Act Steak House for so many years running. My own father even worked here back in high school when there was still cattle on the property! There are so many amazing things about The Stockyard: the best steak in Arizona, the location history, the visitors who have come to visit and eat at the fine establishment, and the amazing bar service. No other restaurant in the valley even compares in my opinion and for that reason, when I'm ready to be seduced by the finest of steak dinners... take me to The Stockyard.....please!"}
{"text":"Worth the price! The most amazing, meltin your mouth prime rib and definitely get the chili. My boyfriend was able to cut his porterhouse with a fork. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"The service was amazing and the free bread basket and vegetable bask was delicious. My boyfriend and I went for a late Valentine's Day dinner and got the chateaubriand for two. It was definitely plenty of food but it took forever to come out and wasn't hot...it was warm and the sauces were cold. Would come back but would definitely ask for them to heat it up."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to go to SY for more than a year, because I keep seeing it on my commute and it's advertised in Phoenix street maps. When I finally got there... I wasn't that all impressed. The decor is very steakhouse-y, with dim-ish lighting, big tables, leather booths, etc. The food was about 1.5 notches above your average Outback. Our table ordered the calf fries just to taste them, and they were gross. It was my first time eating them, and I've eaten a lot of gross things in my day (frogs, snakes, alligators, cricket teas, pork brain/livers, etc.) and this was up there. It came with a lemon wedge and cocktail sauce, but that didn't do anything for the taste of the testicle. It was like a cross between chicken liver (taste) and sweetbreads (texture), but with a confusingly fishy aftertaste. And I did give it the ol college try by eating more than 1 of them.   But given that it was my first time eating them, I didn't fault the restaurant for that experience. I got an 8oz prime rib, with a clam chowder and the parmesan potatoes, and au jus on the side. I didn't think their prime rib had a lot of flavor... maybe my piece was too small to get a nice searing on the outside, but without the jus, it was a bland piece of meat without a good beefy taste. The parmesan potatoes was like a napoleon, except with layers of potato slices and cheese in the place of flaky dough and custard. It was good, although I found some of the potato slices to be less cooked than others. And overall, the look of it was a little off, because the whole thing was off-white, and didn't have an appetizing crust/color on it.   The service was excellet and attentive, so 1 star for that."}
{"text":"Went for Valentine's day first time.  Fun server.  Great service.  Great food.  Did not love the sweet butter for bread.  Bread was good.  Wine was great!  $80 Buffalo rib-eye was awesome - different.  Yes, a little gamey - but supposed to be, yes?  Biggest Grilled prime-rib a first for us was great!  Yes, it melts in mouth.  But there was stringiness involved.  Not that into prime rib, so I don't know what to expect...  Potato cheese bake  was just  okay.  Rich...  Baked potato was nice with crispy bacon - yes!  Good salad!  No dessert this time:)  Neat to try.  Lots of elderly.  Will be back someday.  Not a place for us to frequent:)"}
{"text":"Classic and comfortable steakhouse with a great atmosphere. Had a salad and the prime rib...super flavorful and cooked on the money. Service was fantastic and the wine, Caricature Zinfandel, was spot on! (Cool label too).  Make it a stop while in PHX, lunch or dinner they do it right."}
{"text":"We came here for a team outing with our company.  It was very busy for a Tuesday but the service and food were excellent.  The waiter was extremely knowledgable and had a great southern accent. They have a great selection of whiskey and the steak was cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"Only ever eaten in the bar during happy hour, so this review is not for old school steak house fare with all the fixins.   That's cool though because I can't bring myself to eat a ginormous hunk o' muscle very often anyway. I can go years without ending up in a steakhouse and when I do it's generally a meh experience regardless of how orgasmic people tell me the slice of cow is supposed to be.   Saloon 1889 on the other hand is right up my alley. Hey, we all have our vices.   The atmosphere is pure Arizona. It's the perfect combination between the slightly nauseating Rawhide's folksy old-Zona and the Rat Pack old school Arizona exemplified by Durant's, with maybe a dash of Monti's La Casa Mediocre tossed in for good measure.   The bar is a massive antique-looking dark wood relic from another era, with ornate pillars and a huge gilded mirror along one side. The bartenders also look like they could whip you up a classic cocktail, the stuff with bitters, or a girly sugar bomb. They got skills.   The happy hour is really where's it's at here. Free sliders, chips and salsa. Couple bucks off the bar bites, which are substantial meal replacements. Cheap wine, well, beer, all delivered with a smile."}
{"text":"First of all there's a great staff working in this place. Now I'm not one to usually rate a place but this restaurant is great the food is 100% genuine and delicious and if you feel like chilling at the bar then dawn will take very good care of you all in all it's a place I see myself going back to and it's not too pricy so if you want a good piece of meet they have it."}
{"text":"A flawless experience at this icon of old Phoenix, and a better value than most other premium steak places I've visited.  In more cases than I can recall, a place with the history and legacy of the Stockyards would have fallen into complacency long ago, milking the same group of dedicated customers and giving less value to anyone who's not a regular. However, our visit was great from the moment I made the reservation.   The menu is very traditional, and they've even played the retro angle by bringing back a prix fixe option that includes Steak Diane. We opted for the Chateaubriand for Two, and it was some delicious melt-in-your-mouth beef. No complaints on the service, either.   As far as attire goes: It's a fancy restaurant in some ways, but remember that it's in Phoenix, and that it was originally located next to one of the largest feedlots West of the Mississippi. You won't look out of place in jeans and a polo."}
{"text":"This is one of the better steaks you can find in town. Excellent service. The antique bar and the history of the place is nifty too. However, the location is weak - unless your staying near the airport. This is an upscale steakhouse for special occasions, so dress up."}
{"text":"Me and my girl went here last night for dinner and I had heard good things but was not sure what I was in for. To my surprise when i stepped in through the large copper doors I was amazed. This is a very nice place to eat. It challenges any top tier steakhouse in the phoenix area and in my opinion beats them. The reason is the value of the menu. You get great cornbread and biscuits, a relish plate soup or salad and a side of your choice included in the price. Mastros, Mortons and all the other greats are ala carte, and here its all included, and honestly i felt like i got a better steak. I went with the prime rib dubbed \"best of the west\" and they were right. It was one of if not the best I ever had. My sweetheat had the combo oscar which had a small peice of salmon and a filet. Everything was cooked to perfection, the oscar sauce was delicious..so were the soups and salads. Service was over the top and even though it was my first time there, i felt like a regular. Would I go back...you better believe it.   This place seemed to attract an older crowd, but it was very nice and classy.I can't understand why it  was not more crowed than it was. After eating there i feel obligated to spread the word. This is the best steakhouse in Phoenix. Give it a chance and you will be pleasantly surprised.  Eat up and enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"Another very good lunch outing today with more clients.  The restaurant was pretty busy . . . but the food was unbelievable.  The reason for only getting four stars was there was a considerable wait . . . about 20 minutes . . . from the time that we ordered until our food arrived.  And though that is not a long time . . . for a salad, a wrap, a sandmich, and a burger . . . it seemed a little excesive . . . maybe if the waiter had checked back at some point to give a quick update it would have lessoned the wait.  Well, on to the food . . . the Steak Burger was out of this world . . . the seasoning and flavors were great and it meat was cooked perfectly medium . . . just a little pink and still juicy.  The fries were nothing special, but they were hot and crisp.  The iced tea was fresh brewed . . . how do I know . . . it kept melting the ice.  All in all . . . a very good dining experience today . . . hope to be back soon to try something different from the menu."}
{"text":"Boar and venison sausage was delicious! The side toppings and garnishes gave it the perfect salty-sweet combination.   The NY Strip was pretty mediocre and wasn't worth the high price. My colleague said the prime rib was awesome though!   Service was excellent. Our waiter was extremely knowledgeable."}
{"text":"We were greeted and seated promptly when we arrived, a little early for our reservation. I have only been here for lunch, and it had been a few years since I my last visit. That was due more to the location than any negative experience: I don't work or live anywhere near the restaurant any more.   The restaurant has that old-time steakhouse feel with servers dressed up and doing their best to take care of you. I would suggest dressing up more than jeans and a t-shirt, but I don't know if it is required for lunch. At lunchtime on a weekday, the place was filled with business people conducting meetings. I suspect the number of lunch meetings contributed to the amount of noise I noticed. In the past, I may have been part of one of those meetings, but not today. This visit was for a quiet lunch meal with my wife for her birthday. She had never been here, but it has been on her \"to do\" list for some time. Since we were driving through Phoenix on the way home, I figured it would be a good time to take her here. The noise was noticeable, but not terrible. Just don't expect silence, especially if you come for weekday-lunch.  My wife ordered the shaved prime rib dip sandwich and said it was one of the best she's had in Phoenix -- she is always looking for good dip sandwiches. I had the beef and cheddar on rye with steak soup to start. The steak soup was something I remembered from my last visit and had to get it again to see if it was as good as I remembered. The best way I can describe it is \"pot roast soup,\" complete with beef, veggies and gravy. I recommend it if you like pot roast.   We both had fries as our side, but they were nothing special. I'm not a big eater of fries anyway and should have probably ordered cole slaw (they also offer mashed potatoes or cottage cheese).   Our service was excellent and everything was handled promptly."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my dinner. I ordered the salmon Oscar & it was good but not great. Next time it will be a steak. I really enjoyed my cup of chili & Caesar salad w/anchovies. Service was very attentive & soup came immediately followed by salad. Had to wait then on the entree. I'll come back again.  $56 with no alcohol."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner last night, on a visit to Phoenix.  My BF had read about it here on Yelp and decided it would be the \"fancy dinner\" for this trip.  There were plenty of casually-dressed patrons, so don't think dressing up is a requirement, tho'.  We arrived a little earlier than our reservation, so hung out in the bar for a bit after checking in with the hostess,  When we returned to the hostess station about 20 minutes later, we were pleased that the gal remembered who we were and sat us immediately.  Our server, Bob, was jovial and very helpful with the menu choices.  Scott had the baseball cut steak (essentially a huge lump of beef -- very very tasty), and opted for the \"Wild West Mix Grill\" - elk, pike and wild boar & venison sausage.  The plate was enormous!  It was the first time I'd ever eaten elk, so I wasn't sure what to expect... I wasn't crazy about the first bite, but it grew on me.  The pike was well cooked and flaky, and the sausage was tasty as well.  I thought the chutney that came with the sausage was a little too strong in flavor, but others might like it.  My dish did not come with the whiskey sweet potato mash, but I wanted to try it so our server brought me a sample of it - YUMMY!  For dessert we shared the warm chocolate brownie with ice cream.  We were both stuffed.  Table service was really good.  My water glass was never empty (one of my personal measurements of a good restaurant).  The waiter was very attentive, but not invasive.  It's not the quietest of restaurant - sound and voices really bounce around in there - but the atmosphere and decor are quite nice, and worth seeing.  Prices were a little high, but it's a high-end restaurant so you'd expect it.  The final tab for two entrees, a couple glasses of wine and dessert were still notably cheaper than a comparable dinner in Las Vegas.  We would definitely consider going again on a future trip to Phoenix.  Tip: even if you're not a drinker, you should go take a look at the bar in the saloon.  It's huge, with really nice carvings,  Looks really Wild West authentic."}
{"text":"I usually take my brother in law here for his birthday. Last year it was fabulous. This year, not so much. We got to the bar (Happy Hour) about 4:15, ordered our refreshments and saw the sliders, the oh so cold sliders. Remembering last years visit we were disappointed. We finished our drinks and sauntered into the dining room. We both ordered the prime rib and after we were served I cut a piece of my cold to the touch $34 prime rib. My brother in laws meat was so tough the steak knife had to be used like a saw. We told the waitress about the cold meat and in as professional a manner as I've ever seen she removed it and apologized. Forward 5 minutes she returns with my second prime rib. I touched the top and it was minimally warmer, although the plate was so hot it couldn't be touched. Cut into this one and again barely warm. I now asked for the chef knowing some line cook had plated my food. Who appears? The owner. I explained my concerns and on the third try received a warmer, still not hot piece of meat. By now the serving and returning had spanned about 20 minutes, I had already finished most of my baked potato and just wanted to leave. So after ordering two end cuts we ended up with inside cuts and more frustration than needed. They knocked off an iced tea and one alcoholic drink. Simply stated, I'll never return. If the meal was free I wouldn't go back just based on the frustration aspect. The front room and owner were extremely professional, but I'm thinking they're cutting corners with the kitchen staff and that's unacceptable."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was good. Steak appeared to have been frozen and lacked any taste. We are huge steak fans and this was one time that we  left half the steak."}
{"text":"Happy to say the Stockyards remains the best steak restaurant in the Valley.  Fish options are also good and one of our party enjoyed the chicken.  We appreciated their flexibility in changing out side dishes so we could try things.  Also fun choices in salads.  I love the Green Goddess, but the wedge looked good too.  The Stockyards holds its place in Arizona history and does a good job introducing new comers to the time when we were all about cattle and cotton.  The bar(saloon) has been beautifully kept, fun to see whether you drink or not.  Go if you have not been.  Take your friends who don't know  about it."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a cool place to grab a steak and drink a little further from the scottsdale old town craziness then Stockyards is a great place to go!  I came here just because it was close to the hotel and I yelp said it was good... but you never know! I can say that I was pleasantly surprised with my steak and dining experience here!"}
{"text":"wild boar sausage was awesome.  dinner for two was excellent as well. Only complaint is I ate WAY too much."}
{"text":"I'm really confused how this is \"Arizona's Original Steakhouse\" when the quality and method of which they cook their steaks seems amateur. And, that's me putting it lightly.  I would absolutely NOT recommend this place. If you're going to spend this kind of money, go to Durant's.  Ribeye: Texture/Quality is very sub-par. No flavor. They claim they cook with gas, but I'm lead to believe it's a griddle with gas heat underneath. There was no char or flavor to the steak.  Buffalo Meatloaf: No texture, bad flavor. Someone left this in the food processor for about an hour too long. It's extremely mushy.  Potato Stack: These aren't bad. A little mushy, but not bad.  Wedge Salad: Overall very good. However, their bacon is like dust. It's more like powered bacon."}
{"text":"I researched online for the best Prime Rib in Phoenix and The Stockyards lived up to their name.  Excellent Prime Rib, attentive service.  Can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Ribeye was good but this not a $46 cut of meat. This does not rank up there with many more memorable steak houses I have been to over the years. Friends enjoyed the filet. No rave reviews on the prime rib. Nothing special about the sides. The shrimp dish was good. The venison sausage was not very good. They provided good service. Bottom line is that this was not a top steak house experience. The reviews I saw on this restaurant are out of line with my experience and I have been to a huge number of the nation's top steak houses. The price is not warranted either."}
{"text":"Hadn't been here for at least two years.  Met friends at the bar here and so glad I did!   First, I would give 4 1/2 stars if I could figure out how to.  And the only reason for not giving 5 stars is that their bar stools are not good.  So it's a comfort issue.  But the bar itself is beautiful and old and carved and cool.  Nice wine pours and then there is the food.  I really didn't need to know about their onion rings. Truly delicious and decadent!   The mushrooms Rockefeller was great and I am sure loaded with calories but eating spinach and mushrooms made me feel slightly less guilty about the steak bites with Bearnaise sauce and garlic bread and onion rings!   A great experience and tasty treats!"}
{"text":"The Stockyard was good. My filet was exactly as requested. The shrimp cocktail had huge shrimp. It seemed like a reasonably priced steakhouse for the quality. Have I had better, yes, but it was still good. If you are looking for a more romantic style of restaurant, this isn't your place."}
{"text":"I sat in the bar and completely enjoyed myself.  Steak soup was tasty.  Bread and veggies came out first and were great snacks.  Then a salad and a perfectly cooked filet mignon.  Steak was a little thin but very tasty. Whiskey peppercorn sauce on the side was a nice addition.  Cheese cake for dessert was a huge portion.  A nice Bordeaux was the perfect accompaniment.  I would come back for sure.  A very historic building with cool history and upgrades that respect the history while giving a touch of modern."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by the front desk at my hotel when I asked about a good steakhouse close by.  When I arrived the front was not attended but it did only take a few minutes to be seated. However apparently if you dine alone the service is lack luster at best.  11 minutes before my sever arrived to take my drink /dinner order. The salad arrived promptly after I ordered it and was good.  The filet arrived and was warm but good. Dan did ask to cut into to make sure it was to my liking.  I appreciated that. The Parmesan potatoes were sickness and piping hot.  And just for those I may give it a second chance."}
{"text":"Started with a nice side salad dressed with a tasty balsamic vinaigrette. Next, we had filet mignon seasoned nicely with some salt and grilled to medium rare along with string beans and julienne carrots. Good lunch!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't reviewed this restaurant yet, I eat here at least twice a month and have for years. This is a great place for large groups given the size of the place also for business meetings. I appreciate the daily specials but you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. The prime rib dip sandwich and pastrami are my lunch favorites. Staff is on point, friendly with great service. This is must if your looking for great restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Amazing waitress Alice!! Great job! Food very good. Decent selection of wine and spirits! Great history of restaurant!"}
{"text":"Stockyards has never failed me. My most recent dining experience was to celebrate my grandparents birthdays. They'd actually been to stockyards a few decades back when they first started dating and were excited to return. Our waitress, Alice, was exceptional. She insured that all of our needs were met. Love the history, service, and of course the food at this place!"}
{"text":"Great place to bring clients.   Service was EXCELLENT and sincere. Food was delicious. Food cooked to perfection. The decor is classic.  Linens on the table."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, laid back, not overly pricey for a really good meal.  Can get busy so reservations are a good idea.  Ribeye was delicious."}
{"text":"This restaurant was recommended by aloft.  I travel 80% of my working life, so I've had great steak.  The steak rivaled Mahogany in Oklahoma city.  I am not sure which steak was better, but I can tell you the filet is extraordinarily tender and flavorful.  Everything was excellent, biscuits, baked potato, sauces. Don't miss this opportunity."}
{"text":"The husband and I decided to come to the Stockyards for his birthday this year, and, I must say, it was very enjoyable! I made a reservation on opentable and noted that it was his birthday. This was not ignored, he was greeted with a 'happy birthday!' and given fabulous service all night. We had a wonderful waitress... I can't remember her name (sorry!), but the service was friendly, funny, timely... everything you could ask for. They start you with a basket of delicious cornbread and biscuits paired with honeybutter and a crudite plate with more than your usual veggies (watermelon radish, jicama, etc). Every entree comes with soup or salad, I had the soup which was seafood chowder and was pretty good, packed full of seafood. The husband had the salad, also tasty with a nice balsamic dressing. For mains, I had a filet mignon and the husband had a new york strip... I had the au gratin potato stack thing and he had mashed potatoes. Both steaks were tasty and perfectly cooked. The sides were also great, mine was garlicky and full of flavor, his were perfectly creamy. After dinner, we were so stuffed, but our fantastic waitress brought out a rich chocolatey brownie with ice cream and a candle..... I can't say we didn't eat the whole thing. Thanks to the Stockyards for the delicious and memorable dinner!    PS the whole dinner was under 100$, pretty good!"}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed this place. Its a pretty traditional place. I came here during restaurant week. The corn bread and butter is pretty darn tasty. I got the prime rib which was a bit salty but very tender. The smoked corn chowder? was really good. Probably my favorite part of the meal. Staff was pleasant. Decor reminds me of an era gone by - more of a sinatra era type of decor. I would definitely come back to visit."}
{"text":"Old school greatness!  Prime rib and filet cooked just right.  The BEST beef I've had out in the Valley. Go there now."}
{"text":"Whenever I have out of town guests, I usually bring them here for a taste of classic Arizona.  The food is superb and service is wonderful.  The bar is classic."}
{"text":"I first heard of Stockyards back in the late '90s when I was living in OC.  A co-worker kept raving about it, reminding me over and over to be SURE to hit \"Cattleman's\" for a steak if/when I'm in Phoenix.  Whoops, he had the name wrong, for like 2 years.  I was out here on business at one point and tried to find it.  Not surprisingly, the wrong name made it, uh, impossible to locate.  Fast forward a couple more years, and suddenly I'm a Valley resident.  Somewhere along the line, I'd figured out that the target joint was actually Stockyards, not \"Cattleman's\".  I've had dinner here a handful of times since, and have always enjoyed it immensely.  The beef here is to die for.  Probably the best steak you can find anywhere in the Phoenix area.  Lots of other choices on the menu, but you're really missing out if you don't order steak here.  Lots of side order choices, all of which I've tried I've loved.  Beware the \"calf fries\", they are actually a certain body part that you might not want to eat.  Let's just say that Beavis and Butthead would be amused by the fact that they're on the menu.  The light rail construction along Washington dealt a severe blow to business, and now that it's done, the economy apparently isn't helping either.  All of my recent visits have found the joint sadly semi-empty.  The location is odd.  They could use some sort of marketing boost via the local hotels.  Nobody I've dined with here has ever been the least bit disappointed with either the food or the experience.  Stockyards rates a solid 4.25 stars on the Brak-o-Meter.  It's quite expensive, and that keeps me from giving it the coveted 5-star endorsement, as the value factor is just \"ok\".  But if the stiff tab doesn't deter you, I can virtually assure you that you will find your steak to be top shelf, comparable to any snobby steak joint in the land.  Without the snobbiness."}
{"text":"Solid steakhouse, nothing more--nothing less. Very good service (thank you, Alice) in a comfortable setting. Cocktails were okay, though my Old Fashioned was unremarkable (a little more focus on the muddled fruit than the bourbon, for my taste). Dinner salad was chilled and lettuce and vegetables were fresh. Our party all had steaks: cooked to order and those of us who got 16oz later concluded that 12oz would have sufficed. Steaks had okay flavor, though I thought the prices were a tad in the high side. My side of whipped potatoes came to the table on the low-end of warm, which was disappointing.  Lastly, for a nice restaurant serviced by a professional staff, it's always a minor irritant to see men wearing ball caps and/or sitting in a booth with their legs stretched out and their back to the wall -- it's not a diner or an everything-fried national restaurant chain -- get some class, for cripessakes!  Otherwise, an ok dinner experience.  Cheers! RS"}
{"text":"Awesome steakhouse! The vibe is always on point and the food is amazing!! Truly the best steak you can get in Arizona!"}
{"text":"This is a long time Phoenix favorite and I haven't been there in several years but I was very disappointed I ordered prime rib that had absolutely no flavor wasn't bad just wasn't good no flavor my companion for the evening ordered a steak done medium and it was overcooked on the outside just not what I expected from the stockyards"}
{"text":"Highly over rated steakhouse! I had a 12 oz ribeye that had too much gristle and fat. I asked the waiter if the restaurant served choice vs prime beef - He stated it was sterling (between choice and prime). I've never heard of that cut.  In any event, I would neither eat there again, nor recommend this restaurant to anyone. I should mention that the server provided a dessert at no charge - It was fine."}
{"text":"Good restaurant, but just that.    I had a 12 oz. New York Strip as part of a $40 prix fixe meal for Phoenix Restaurant Week.  I started with the steak soup.  Good flavor, plenty of meat in it, but they sure skimped on the portion size.  It was a tiny cup (I'd hope and assume that for the non-Restaurant Week patrons a larger bowl would be on offer).  As for the main course, it was a really good steak, cooked a perfect medium rare per my order, but there was nothing truly special about it.  Seasoned with peppercorn and served with--if I recall (it was pretty forgettable)--a fairly generic barbecue sauce. It was served with a choice of potato.  I opted for the scalloped potatoes and they were really good.  The pecan pie I had for desert tasted good but was crumblier than I'd prefer.  It fell apart after the first couple of bites.  Again, it tasted great, but I've had better pecan pie that held it's form until I'd finished it.    The service here was excellent and the decor was fairly elegant for a steakhouse.  Ultimately, I'd probably eat here again if friends invited me, but I'd likely try to sway them towards somewhere with a more creative menu that perhaps offered a bit more bang for my buck."}
{"text":"I'm rating this based on the value for the cost of the meal. The service was very good but just what I would expect for the money. I had soup to start, chicken and wild rice and it was superb. I had a 12 ounce NY strip which looked more like an 8 ounce strip. It was good but not excellent. The potato stack that I ordered with it was a 3 inch cube and it was mediocre. The asparagus was terrible. It was overgrown and exceedingly tough. I had two glasses of Reisling that were just okay and I had some bland chocolate mousse. This was a group dinner that everyone seemed to enjoy. Considering my steak was $42 and the asparagus was about $12 I expected a very good meal. So my meal and drinks start to finish was just under $100. I was disappointed. Probably the thing I disliked most was that we were celebrating a special occasion and it was so loud that we couldn't even carry on a conversation. So not impressed for the money. Probably won't return."}
{"text":"We had been invited back by the owner Gary Lesko due to a few disappointments on Father's Day and so glad we returned. Service as always was stellar! Parker is so wonderful, she is warm and friendly but most importantly has great suggestions and is very attentive to the guests needs. I had the 12 oz. rib eye which was perfectly cooked medium rare and very tender along with the mashed sweet potato (has to be the best side). Parker introduced me to the house steak butter which is a combo of butter, garlic and sage and  it was wonderful not only on top of the steak but also complimented the sweet potatoes fabulously.  My husband had the 1/2 rack of ribs and they were tender fall-off the bone good and he loved his side of the cowboy beans that he raved about. Stating they were the best cowboy beans he ever had. For dessert we thought we would try something different and got the chocolate mousse. It was very thick and creamy. Of course the Stockyards has the very best biscuits and cornbread and topping it with the softened honey butter always makes this restaurant memorable. We will be back!"}
{"text":"My parents and I dined here yesterday. We were greeted immediately and promptly seated. The fresh biscuits were wonderful and tasted like they were homemade. The fresh veggies and dip were excellent too. I was very surprised by the wide variety of dishes listed in the menu. We all ordered prime rib. The size of the meat was very generous. The meat was very flavorful and cooked perfectly. We also ordered the whisky sweet potatoes. These were also very good. I love this restaurant. The next time I'm in Phoenix, I will visit again. The only thing I regret is accidentally forgetting my leftovers in the hotel refrigerator."}
{"text":"Stockyards doesn't try to compete with the gastropub and cocktails trend. They are a steak house and have been just that, with little or no renovation, for years. In a really good way, when you step inside you step back in time.   The wine list is not overwhelming and includes some local varieties.The dinner menu is filled with classic steak entrees which have all been cooked perfectly to our liking. There are several salad options and fish options on the dinner menu as well for those who don't eat steak.  What brings me back are the consistency in preparation and the fact that Stockyards is no nonsense and doesn't try to be something it is not."}
{"text":"We had 26 people for dinner! The room was great, since the bar area was a little loud. The food was good, everyone seemed to enjoy their meal. I like my steaks medium-rare so I enjoyed mine. But they did not ask the temperature when you ordered so several people had to send their steaks back. I feel they should have explained that for the room. The service was good, but there a few times we needed something or someone and no one was around.   I would definitely recommend if in the area! The memorabilia is a great addition to the food!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best meals at any restaurant. As we arrived for our Valentine reservation, we were greeted and the young woman offered to take our picture. We were then escorted immediately to our table where our service was impeccable. From our waiter to each member of the staff serving us, we were treated with the utmost respect and five star service. We had Chateaubriand for two...it was cooked perfectly and was arguably the best we've ever had. From the atmosphere, to the friendly and caring staff, and the savory meal through the last bite of desert, we were very pleased. We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a very cool older vibe. Cool back room with the bar.   They brought out biscuits & veggies for the table, all were good!  I got the ribeye & it was DELICIOUS! The side salad was very tasty! Best steak I've had for awhile. I've had steak at 3 different restaurants in the PHX area in the past 2 months, and this place has the best!   We got creme brûlée & s'mores. Both were good, but I liked the creme brûlée better! (They name it something else on the menu)"}
{"text":"Amazing setting, one of the most beautiful bar areas i have ever seen.  As well they have the best Prime Rib i have ever had.  Its like butter."}
{"text":"I was here against my will, having been dragged along with 23 other work people, to have a group dinner after a very long flight.  I had wanted to try out Four Peaks Brewing Co. or Camus, since the Yelp reviews were quite good for those two places.  Anyway, I was pretty impressed with the fact that although we had 24 people, and reservations, they were able to seat us immediately. We got a room to ourselves, and dedicated wait staff. The staff was friendly, and attentive.  I admit that I didn't try the appetizers because I could tell there would be a lot of food. I had one of their biscuits, which was fluffy and tasty with the sweetened butter they served it with.   My dirty K.O. martini was tasty, too. They had a crudite plate (raw veggies) that was less than appealing... just some sticks of jicama, carrots, black olives and radishes rolling around in a bowl that looked like a horse trough. The quesadillas they put out looked really good, though, and people enjoyed them. I tried half of a grilled portabello mushroom app, and while tasty, it was grilled a bit too much and was a little tough. Flavor was good, though.  For dinner, I had the half-rack of baby back ribs. They were VERY good. The mashed potatoes weren't that hot anymore, so they had gotten kind of hard on top. I understand it's hard to cook for 24 people, and have the food arrive around the same time, but it seems like they could've waited to slop your potatoes on the plate until before they were going to serve them up. The meat was tender and very tasty on the ribs. I could only eat half of a half. Gave the rest away... if I had a fridge at the hotel, it would've gone with me!  Couldn't even fathom dessert. The food was plenty enough for me!   The ambiance was nice. Would've been better if there weren't smoking allowed in the lounge part of the restaurant. That was the worst part of the experience. Being from California, I\"m not used to having to smell second hand smoke while eating anymore.   It may have been a better experience if we didn't have 24 people... I probably won't get a chance to rate it again. I'd really say that it was about a 3.5, if I'm going to be honest about it. I really did love my ribs and drink and the service was exceptional."}
{"text":"In Phoenix for business and saw the Stockyard was near my hotel. Checked out yelp and decided to give it a try. Excellent choice. The service was exceptional. My server Dawn was outstanding, but from the hostess, to the wait staff everyone was friendly and professional. I had the 16oz NY Strip and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of cut. The steak was cooked perfectly. The pecan pie recommended by Dawn was fantastic as well. Overall excellent value, great food and great service."}
{"text":"Service was decent and I actually like the decor. High tin ceiling, pretty airy for a traditional steakhouse, and definitely more upscale than other cowboy joints like Bill Johnsons.   Less impressed with dinner.  I make ribs at home occasionally and these tasted as if they'd been reheated from the the lunch shift, or maybe even the previous night. Just not as fresh and good as a place like Houstons or Don&Charlies. Coleslaw and fries were blah. $28.   Other people seemed to enjoy their steaks more and my cup of clam chowder was buttery good, but you can tell the quality control and attention to detail in the kitchen doesnt justify some of the price points.   Still glad I went, just to take in a very historic location.  I'd recommend having a drink here instead."}
