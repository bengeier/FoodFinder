{"text":"Just went here yesterday to buy some paneer and just noticed today, while opening the package, the expiration  date for both of them was July 22 2014...I'm pretty sure that that's not legal. So if you shop at the India House may want to check the expiration before buying."}
{"text":"Delicious food, authentic South Indian food. Loved the idly sambhar but honestly rasam was ultimate.
I would recommend this place to everyone who loves vegan food. Spice level is mild to medium, you can probably ask for less spicy too. 
Overall a must try vegan Indian place."}
{"text":"Everything was fresh ,sambar was really good ...sambar vadai which was out of the menu was made for us which v all loved it...appam could hv be little better ..but the Kurma was really good ...some taste was missing in masala vadai ..don't miss the onion pakoda which was out standing ...over all I liked the food and felt like eating at home ..."}
{"text":"Food is so good! Tried puri and lemon rice, they are so delicious and fresh! Love to try more items here next time!"}
{"text":"Awesome vegetarian food. Can't beat the price as well. Now have a place to go to most of the time week."}
{"text":"Most authentic South Indian food we tried idli sambhar ,onion spinach pakora, dosa , dahi vada every single order was worth dying for."}
{"text":"First time here & the food is delicious! Great personal attention to your order & willingness to describe the dishes you are not familiar with. Comfortable dining inside & quick take out. Will stop in again soon!"}
{"text":"This is a new Indian restaurant, off to a good start. I tried it for lunch first. Traditional vegetarian presentation: a stainless steel platter with small compartments for the various components of a light vegetarian lunch favored by Hindus. Between the rice and the lentil 'donuts' and papadom (lentil tortillas), and the flavoring broth and pickled vegetables, and fresh salad, it really was sufficient, probiotic, gluten free, and tasty. I will be back for dinner. Very reasonably priced. Try it, your diet will like it."}
{"text":"Welcoming staff but slightly short staffed. food presentation was nice but didnt taste good. cauliflower curry in thali was stale and rotis were not soft. Also, I have had much better filter coffee before. I am not regretting my visit because the food looked homecooked and less oily (nowdays rare to find) but at the same time don't feel like going back because I wasn't satisfied with the thali. Other items in the menu looked expensive."}
{"text":"best south indian food in the state!!! the thalis are a must try!!! Service is great and the food is almost oil free!"}
{"text":"I was at this restaurant in August for lunch. Was quite excited that we finally have an indian restaurant without a buffet. Tired of people thinking indian food as just curry dishes that are served in the buffet. Well, frankly after visiting this restaurant may be we should just stick to the buffets, even though they taste nothing like the real Indian food (not even half as good as home cooked Indian food). This restaurant has it all wrong. The taste doesn't belong to the south or North Indian tastes. The rasam/Sambar that was served didn't taste like either, just hot water with some bad flavor. After two months of visiting this restaurant this comes up on my yelp search with surprisingly high reviews."}
{"text":"This is the only Restaurant which serves Beetroot Halwa and Beetroot chutney!! 
Never seen a purple food anywhere. 
Amazingly Delicious! 
Also you can't get Medu Vada and Masala Vada everywhere. Tastes like mothers food. 

Best Onion Uthappam I ever had. With Ghee aroma, Wow! 
Got poori's that looked exactly the same as in the picture! 
A Girl came and talked with Innocence n smiling n said she's the cook. She's got some real talent and magic on her hands! 
The price is little high though. But the quality of the food is awesome!"}
{"text":"My Girlfriends and I went to the restaurant, the food was amazing. Didn't know there are so many varieties in Indian food. In love with the Masala dosa n combination of chutneys. 

We got Thali for lunch and it came with gajar ka halwa. Wow!! Loved every bit. 
Again went for dinner n got Aapam veg kurma. Best rice aapam. Other place I went for aapam, they used all purpose flour for making it I guess, so rubbery n elastic. This Rice Aapam made my day. 

Asked the waiter if can meet the cook, and immediately She came with a Bigg smile. 
Also she offered Beet halwa as a compliment!! 
Never knew that we can make halwa and chutney with Beets. Amazing cook n amazing food! 
A recipe has no Soul, only a cook can bring it!! Proved"}
{"text":"right next to the DMV. I visited India house today for breakfast,craving for some idly vada and was utterly disappointed. 

Idly was badly out of shape , vada undercooked and took them a good 40 mins to get the dishes out . I also ordered a puri bhaji and it looked good and home made but the bhaji was so bland, I had to add salt and give it a good whip before I ate it. may be i caught them on one of those days and since our service was good I'll give it another try for sure."}
{"text":"Masala dosa, sambar and idly were delicious.  There was so much food for the lunch thali and it was really good.  We will be back often."}
{"text":"Love this place! My new favorite lunch spot (I live downtown so not likely to come here for dinner, unfortunately). This restaurant is a god send.  South Indian vegetarian and delicious. And all the food pictured is only $9.99. What! This place is awesome."}
{"text":"More like 3.5 stars. 

The masala dosa wrap was thicker and spongier than I am accustomed to. The samosas were pretty standard, and served with ketchup? Service was friendly but slow, even though we were the only people there. 
Overall it wasn't bad, exactly, but even though I'm vegetarian I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Decent place, with OK South Indian food and good service. 
However, I'd rate the quality if the food to just about  above average.  The Sambar lacked punch, the coconut chutney could have been thicker,  and the quantity of vegetables provided with the puri-bhaji could have been more.   My suggestion to the owners:  We want you to be successful. To do that, please visit Saravana bhavan, mithaas or a comparable South Indian restaurant in New Jersey, and try and match that quality.  Also consider adding lower cost appetizers, and chaat type items to the menu.  If you can do this, you will have no shortage of customers."}
{"text":"If you are looking at this review to find great tasting food, just go there.It is authentic home style, South Indian food. Thali was fantastic and reminded me of home! Wish they had branch in MD/VA/DC."}
{"text":"I have eaten here on several occasions - both breakfast and lunch. Breakfast has been my favorite meal here. Lunch I have only ordered their plate of the day and not ventured from the menu - it has been both delicious and just ok, as far as lunch goes. But I love that it's vegetarian and made from scratch and that the owners are passionate about serving quality homemade food - certainly my criteria to what makes a restaurant worthwhile. Not heated up from a can."}
{"text":"I was in the Frazer shopping center looking for a place to eat in between appointments. I saw a breakfast sign in the India House window and walked in and asked the proprietor what was good. He said \"everything \". I believe him. I am not very familiar with India food. He helped me choose. I got a spicy dosa stuffed with potato. It came with four tasty chutneys and sambar. The dosa was like a giant crepe. Everything was delicious. I will be back for another meal! And, if you haven't tried Indian coffee - you should!"}
{"text":"This is our 2nd visit as our 1st visit was average on weekday, so we thought to visit on Mother's Day on weekend but got very disappointed with the service and meal. The meal calls as unlimited but its served less than limited in a smallest cup that we use for dessert. Special full thali items which was charged $12.99.
1 - Roti - this was ok
1 - burnt pappad
1- s.cup plain rice
1 - s.cup some mixed veggie that was burnt with noodle
1- s.cup jackfruit payasam
1 -s.cup left out idly podi upma
1 - s.cup highly salted ladies finger dry curry
1- s.cup some kind of kootu (it was tasteless)
1 - s.cup moor kuzumbu (never had tasted such disgusting buttermilk curry)
1- lemon pickle
1- s.cup not sure tamarind/lemon rice but all I could taste was sourness.
1 - s.cup MTR sambar masala sambar
1- s.cup partially cooked or overly refrigerated yogurt rice (the rice was totally uncooked or should have been prepared and refrigerated for quite a long time)
1- small banana bajji
One should wonder which one they should use as a side dish for the roti and rice. If you have lot of patience, then you may request for more rice (which would be another small cup of rice and some tamarind water rasam (on request you may get it) but it would take at least another 20 minutes to reach to your table. *IMPORTANT* pls dare not to complain on the quality of food or service otherwise the owner (lady) of the restaurant would say that \"you have planned to eat food at their restaurant without paying\" and if you are getting on nerve and reply she will insult you more. There are no professional cooks and the owner also cooks those disgusting meals and would charge for full money without any guilt feeling. Also she neither would ask for apology for her unethical statements to the customers. They are not ready to work to improve on negative feedbacks instead they say Americans like their bland cooking (I am wondering....I too have American friends with whom I go out for office lunch and dinners and never have seen them with such bad tasting mouth to accept any kind of foods) and we are the only one who is complaining. Better save your hard-earned money. If you are desperate about eating out, then find a good restaurant or if you can cook at home than spending on such unprofessional so-called restaurants.
I am attaching the picture of the meal. I was terribly hungry but still wasn't able to eat anything other than the bajji, noodle, roti and burnt papad.

I doubt those reviews with high ratings whether they are really true? It may be posted through paid reviewers or by the owners themselves. The taste had only gone down to poor since my first visit. We fully paid money for the poor food and left with heavy hearted insult from the owner lady. We would never ever recommend this place to our friends or colleagues."}
{"text":"I had the best thali . The points you can take away from the restaurant are quick service, hot curries, fresh papad, tasty sambar and rasam. Wow amazing experience"}
{"text":"Amazing!
Me and my wife were looking for a good indian breakfast on Saturday morning and randomly went to this place. Amazing food great place to eat. We ordered Puri, dosa and idli, masala tea. Felt like home food back in India. The staff were friendly and curtious. Definitely suggest this place!"}
{"text":"It's been about 9 months that I have been living in the greater Philly area now, and though I moved and live even farther than before from this amazing little gem, I make an effort to come back as much as I can. Many thali meals later, it's still my favorite all time restaurant! It's all delicious, each and every time. The only thing that has changed is that they now have the Saturday lunch crowd they deserve. I'm glad the word is spreading. Over time I've had conversations with some of the family members that own this business and they could  not be nicer!"}
{"text":"After being in the US for close to 18 years, finally we have a place that serves South Indian vegetarian breakfast in our area! We went a Sunday morning and before going I called and placed an order for Idiyappam to be ready when we arrive because we were in a hurry . That saved time - they make everything fresh everyday and if you are in a hurry, you can preorder before you arrive. 
We also had Masala dosa, Puri bhaji and filter coffee. Everything was yummy! Good quality South Indian food. The place opens everyday at 8am. The owner was nice enough to come, chat and made sure we give them feedback as well."}
{"text":"Came here to have some Indian snacks.
The food was great and also the people running the restaurant."}
{"text":"Average food! Liked their coffee though! Service needs to improve! Wait time was a lot!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best place which serves traditional Indian food with proper Indian spice...When i feel like having Indian food, India house is the first place that comes to my mind. 

Thanks guys for serving such great food!!"}
{"text":"This place is just great!  I have been here three times as of this review but each time I leave I am left thinking 'what a nice little shop'.  Usually the owner of the shop is there asking questions about what you're looking for. On my last visit however there was another staff member there and she was just as pleasant. 

I asked for samosas which they had; already cooked in the fridge.  She also showed me the frozen samosas that they carry as well; I bought a box to try!

The reason that I stopped there that day was for their goat meat.  It is well priced at about $7.00 or $8.00 per pound and it cooks really well.  They also have some veggies that I have picked up on previous visits.

When it was time to be rung up, the cashier gave me some sample cookies but also shared with me that the owner of this shop recently opened Minerva Indian Restaurant by Middleton.  This was a pleasant surprise as I have always had a positive experience at that place as well.

There are a decent amount of specialty stores like this in the city; especially in this area.  This place will however serve as my go to as they have consistently provided great quality products and service!"}
{"text":"PROS: Great variety of Indian spices, legumes, frozen foods, and snacks
CONS: Not everything is price-tagged

Whenever we run out of spices, or want to stock up on some frozen naan, we come to India House. The staff is very friendly, and the store is small but organized. On weekends, they have fresh-from-the-kitchen samosas for $1 each --- which, obviously, is the best thing ever! Sometimes, I dream about the samosas in my sleep."}
{"text":"Food and service were wonderful. I be back to try the lunch and dinner menu! I highly recommend, India house. For those with dietary restrictions: the Server was knowledgeable and helped me navigate the Manu."}
{"text":"extremely long wait, bad food (no taste at all), insufficient portion size ( we were group of 6 and we shared chapatis ), at one point we had food with pickles (roti and pickle emergency food at home ) . Stay away from this place

be prepared for a bite of pizza next to this place to finish your meal.."}
{"text":"Best place in town to eat South Indian food!! You will get the feeling of mom cooked meal in every bite. Satisfying, delicious, flavorful!! 

Crispy onion pakodas, tasty Meduvada, best Thali platter.. reasonable price! 
 
Great place to order food for House Warming Ceremonies and other parties.
 
They serve Thali for lunch! It's a combo of all South Indian food. 
Don't forget to check out the Kuzhi Paniyanram!!"}
{"text":"This place has a great selection of things you won't find in a regular grocery store, and the staff were very friendly."}
{"text":"Excellent South Indian food choices... kind staff... loved the food. Definitely something to go for considering they are open right from breakfast time
.... spoke to owner about her Vision for the place and how they want to serve clean food.. I definitely recommend to go give this place a try!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome vegetarian Indian place! Great service, flavorful food, and extra of our favorite chutneys for free!!! Plenty of food for the price. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This is an excellent South Asian grocery, a little roomier and a lot cleaner than most.  They have products from Sri Lanka, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala, which isn't that common.  They also have some Indian cooking and serving ware at reasonable prices. Nice selection of Indian taste snacks and sweets, good selection of frozen goods, convenient parking lot.  The owner has a doctorate, which would be surprising in any other town, but here I wonder if it's a requirement."}
{"text":"Good food, good experience, good service just a little pricey..

Came on a Monday night for idly, had a and poori night 

3 people = 16/ person...

Alsp.ordered two cups of coffee - 1.99/cup

Total = 55.00

Beat service - priceless"}
{"text":"This is the best South Indian restaurant in the vicinity. We had dosa and uttampam. Both the things were delicious and sambhar was yummy. Coconut and tomato chutney were light, fresh and tasty. Also they made us taste the beet root chutney, which was new to taste. So nice of them. I would recommend it to anyone for South Indian cusine."}
{"text":"India house is great! The portions are big and the food is very flavorful and authentic. Being someone who doesn't know much about Indian food it was all explained to me and our waiter was great."}
