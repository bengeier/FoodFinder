{"text":"We went here because High Street Fish & Chips was closed. We were pleasantly surprised. The haddock fish & chips were delicious the batter was light and not greasy. Excellent service and very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"The seabream was barbecued to perfection, in simple olive oil, lemon and garlic. Skin is crispy, charred but not burnt. Moist and tender inside. Calamari is fresh, and nicely deep fried and not over. dry outside (not oily) and tender inside. Nice and very friendly service. Price is reasonable. We'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"Seriously delicious grilled dish. I recommend the seabass singari or Seabream with lemon and garlic."}
{"text":"Unbelievable fresh fish,  excellent food cooked to perfection, very nice owner , will go again and again."}
{"text":"Great for lunch as they have a wide variety to chose from the lunch specials menu. I've had the haddock and chips, which was lightly battered  with delicious chips. 

I also had the singari style fish and that was seasoned very well with rice and salad. 

Definitely will be back again, no other place with fresh fish in the area. 

Try the baklava, a sweet treat!"}
{"text":"Went to this place once and loved it. Real sea food restaurant and I liked their fish and chips. Crispy fries make it even better. Nice and friendly guy."}
{"text":"Authentic fresh food. Owner is extremely friendly. I come here very frequently and I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I would give this restaurant a 4.5 as the food was really super fresh (chose our own fish) and the staff was very friendly and patient.

Had a sea bass with rice and salad.  Fish was really fresh and tasty.  We had it deboned and barbecued.  The salad was ok as well as was the rice but really the highlight was the sea bass.

In addition, we had a haddock fish and chips which was exceptional!  It was cooked to perfection and lightly breaded.  The sauce paired with this was also very yummy and the fries also were cooked to perfection.

Overall, a great experience and I will be back soon to try the calamari and shrimps!"}
{"text":"Food was great but the place could use a little maintenance. Still recommend the place though. The portion sizes are huge for a fair price."}
{"text":"Best calamari I've ever had in my entire life.

Fish and chips were also excellent, as was the fish, \"singari\" style."}
{"text":"Meal was grilled to perfection, served on time thanks to ordering ahead, and management was very courteous and organized. Owner is very friendly and patient despite being bombarded by orders and customers. The variety of food is just enough and the technique for preparing and displaying the food is quite special for a little place in Scarborough that is very unassuming and hidden in plain sight."}
{"text":"The singari style fish was phenominal!"}
{"text":"Best fish and chips around! My fianc√© and I are so addicted, we don't go anywhere else. 

We always get the basa because it's cheap and tasty. It's least expensive fish on the menu, I can only imagine what the more expensive fish tastes like! 

The owner is a great guy and he remembers my family and I when we come in. He's very friendly and he makes me feel like I'm back home. 

Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"The fried fish is good. We found a hair inside our food which sorta sucked! But they remade the piece of fish for us. This at least tells you the fish isn't frozen boxed stuff. Shit happens. Good food. 

Ambiance isn't bad. But nothing to rave about. Small place and its trying not to seem like a take out but it's likely better to munch this food at home or in the car. 

Affordable place which is different than most. Make sure you go with the expensive fish. The cheaper stuff isn't worth going here for."}
{"text":"In a city as eclectic as Toronto, finding a place that would let you select your fish - fresh off the ice - with the option of fried, BBQ, grilled - Mermaid Fish is the place! Fried calamari is amazing - lightly coated with their own special spices, offering the slightest hint of cumin and garlic. I went with the BBQ Saba - and I was not disappointed! The spices and seasonings used at Mermaid all have a middle eastern undertone, offering a balance of flavour and mild spice. This is a great, unassuming restaurant you won't be disappointed with!

The ONLY reason I didn't give a perfect 5 out of 5 is due the limited side options for the more health conscious (like myself). The option of a side of steamed vegies would be a great addition to the existing fries, potatoes, rice and salad. 

I'll be back again next week for the fresh red snapper!!!"}
{"text":"I loved the idea of picking my own fish and cook it the way i like it ... it's simply nice and fresh ... very friendly and clean restaurant ... price is very reasonable .. variety of fish and different styles of cooking ... the fried calamari was amazing with the homemade tahini sauce and the baba ghanoush ... loved the brown rice and their grilled pita bread ... it was such a delicious and healthy meal ... i am definitely going there again and bringing in my friends to try ot out ... little tips for you ( ask for the homemade hot sauce ... it's awesoooome )"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. Fresh fare, hearty portions, and very gracious staff! 

I had the bream, barbecue style with rice and salad. I shared fried calamari (lightly breaded, perfect!), baba ghanouj, and hummus with the table. Also at the table was the fried cod and chips which were devoured.

The prices are the best around for a seafood restaurant. The fish is displayed in the counter on ice and I can't stress enough - it's fresh! It's lovely. 

The service is quick and available when you need it but not hovering. The owner, Hashem, is friendly and knowledgeable. I will be back for sure, because I'm lucky enough to be within walking distance of this east-end gem!"}
{"text":"Had a lovely dinner! The complimentary bread came with an amazing baba ghanoush (and hummus). Hesham recommended the Pharaoh style sea bream and Singari/Alexandria style sea bass (fish shipped fresh from Greece!) my brother and I enjoyed both immensely, tasted fresh and crispy but not oily (the side fries were great too). Definitely come with room in your stomach, the portions are very generous."}
{"text":"Tried it out for the 1st time today. 

The food and service was amazing. 

The Basa was absolutely scrumptious. Their fried calamari was very lightly breaded and not greasy. 

I enjoy freshly made, well seasoned, tasty food. 

I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I loved this place , best fish in the city . And the food is super super delicious and the owner is very friendly ... For sure I will be back ...."}
{"text":"Saw reviews- went to try.

Prices are not matching with the quality and portion of food. Yes the fish is fresh (on ice) but it's about $20+ for a medium size piece of fish. The calamari and shrimp basket 1/2 lbs had about 6 shrimps and 8 calamari pieces on top of a mountain of fries. 

Most importantly is I am not sure how clean the food was handled because after the meal Me and my partner both had severe upset stomach and whatever follows. 

The same woman that is serving is also on cash/ kitchen/ prep. I think she's the only person in the whole restaurant. So again I am not sure about the cleansingness."}
{"text":"This unassuming restaurant is a gem one finds unexpectedly.

We visited with the help of Yelp and Yelpers who left raving reviews.

It's a small cozy place one can relax and enjoy fresh fruits of the sea.  When we did walk in, there was a table leaving that had 2 full tables of plates mounted with the bones of any fish imaginable.  This led me to believe that we were in for a treat.

You'll find a wide selection of fresh fish sitting on a bed of ice and one can assume you may have a different selection daily.  To me, this is probably the most important aspect of a seafood restaurant because of the vast variety the sea has to offer.

Unfortunately our night was decided on fish and chips.  We ordered a 4 piece halibut platter, with fries, and a side of coleslaw.  Everything was fresh, tasty and filling.  We had our work cut out for us.

The pleasant owner asked us if we like calamari.  He prepared for us a sample of 4 pieces.  They were properly dusted with flower, spice and herbs.  I think the spice was cumin, but not entirely certain about the herb he used.  Anyway, one of the best fried calamari dishes I've had.

We did a pretty good job finishing off all our order despite the generous portion size.

4 piece halibut with fries platter, side of coleslaw and a couple of soft drinks for only $27 including taxes.  That's a solid price and the quality was more to the tune of $40. 

Nice owner who cares about his food and his customers.  Will be. A regular."}
{"text":"The baked sea bass I ordered was great. Along with the naan bread and multiple sauces. However the place is very small,without a fishy smell. The chose you're own way style isn't really their with only 4 cooking styles and a few fish to chose from."}
{"text":"Hidden gem in Scarborough. The location is small with a few tables, and the owner is friendly and welcoming, and is the one making the food for you. 

Ordered the fish Singhari style with fries, and fish n chips (haddock), and 1/2 lb grilled calamari. You also receive salad and pitas with hummus, babaganoush. Delish! 

Excellent customer service, great affordable prices, and delicious food. Have been here a couple of times and will continue to go there!"}
{"text":"Im like being transported to an Egyptian/Middle-Eastern place, its clean, nice ambiance, friendly and fast service. The food was delicious ."}
{"text":"This place is just the best. 

Pick your fish from the counter of ice and they will debone it, grill it whole, BBQ it with delicious Mediterranean spices, or even with wheat (apparently this is how the pharaohs ate it!). It's delightful experience even if from the outside and surrounding businesses look uninviting. The owners are very friendly and helpful, give generous portions ... and also make the best Baba Ganoush I've had in Toronto. 

5/5 worth the drive. Dine under the beautiful photographs of Alexandria, Egypt!"}
{"text":"Saw the great reviews on yelp and decided to take the family to try it out. 

Initial thoughts: I quickly glanced at the yelp reviews and decided to head out to try the restaurant out. I expected it to be fancy place but when I got to the plaza it turned out to be a small restaurant with a fast food kinda look to the exterior. I had my doubts... And while walking towards the door, I told the wife \"maybe we want to go somewhere else\". But boy was I wrong, the food was ....AMAZING! 

Stepping into the restaurant: 
Small but very clean. Menu was simple. If you are looking for scallops, oysters lobsters they don't have these on the menu. I guess these items don't fit into the style and culture of the type of seafood that is served here...the main focus is on fish. If they can focus on fish and cook it well, that is absolutely ok with me. We ordered baked sea bass with potatoes, haddock fish and chips and calamari & muscles with tomato sauce. Went up to the counter to pick the fish and it didn't have the tiniest odour of a fishy smell. Everything looked smelled really fresh! It would have been great to pick live fish, but I understand with a family run business, there are budgetary constraints. If it keeps prices low and the fish is still fresh on ice, then hey that is good for me. 

Eating time:
The baked sea bass was cooked to perfection, lovely flavours, potatoes were soft melt in your mouth. The calamari & mussels were tender and fresh. Fish and chips were of great value. And what a surprise....we got served complimentary pita bread... It was warm like it was freshly made served with two hummus like dips. I can't get the meal out of my mind. It was that good! 

Conclusions: 5 star experience. I love the family run type of feel to the restaurant. Looks small, but huge flavour, great value, friendly staff, what can I say more? Go to this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Food was fresh and delicious. We chose our seafood ourselves. 

Place was clean.

Owner/chef was very accommodating, friendly and respectful. Me and my guests didn't know what we wanted so he suggested type of fish to get and best way to cook them. It turned out better than expected.

Summary- would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"They had said we could get 5% discount when we said we found them on yelp, but the staff refused to give me the discount. I asked about it at Mermaid Fish at Yonge and St.Clair and they gave me the discount. That is the only reason of three stars, otherwise I would give them four stars. We got take-out, so I did not know much about the service. They cooked very fast, so I did not wait so long. The portion was big and foods were very good."}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood. They were giving flyers for the last few weeks and I had been interested in going Mermaid Fish and Grill House at Yonge and St.Clair. Today I finally tried and it was so good. I ordered today's catch with lemon and garlic with two side orders rice and salad. 

The food was so good. I had never tried Seabass. I did not know what to order from today's catch and the owner helped me to pick the fish. It was always good to listen to the owner because the owner usually knew what would be the best for customers.  The side order rice was pretty good, too. 

I like the service and food. I did not eat in, but the place was clean and pleasant. The next time I will try their lunch."}
{"text":"Very homely feel. Great service. Very affordable for fresh seafood. We got the calamari plate: very well done, not greasy nor overly battered. Whole seabream singari style was amazing. Shrimp platter was equally good. Came with complimentary pita bread and hummus. If you're looking for a good homestyle seafood restaurant you can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Saturday past my husband and I went here for lunch. We both ordered the haddock fish and chips. Usually I would order halibut but their prices were over the top and I love haddock so...
 The fish was overcooked with tasteless batter. It was so hard the batter came apart with every forkful. The fish was not cleaned well as there was the brown mushy stuff that was not removed. It tasted and smelled very fishy.The fries were dry and tasteless.
We ordered coleslaw and they were out of it. Also out of fried eggplant. Finally we ordered a green salad which was fresh and good.
 Their prices are over the top for their fish and chips when you consider The Old York and High Street are always excellent and in a much nicer atmosphere. My husband used the washroom downstairs and was shocked how dark and dirty it was.The broken urinal was wrapped with a garbage bag.
 We will never be back.A waste of money!"}
{"text":"such a surprising take on fish and chips. Nowhere else have I seen the fish on display up front and nowhere have I tasted fresher tasting fish. a Hidden Gem for me while many of you may already know about this awesome location."}
{"text":"Mermaid Fish and Grill House is a small Egyptian style seafood restaurant that serves fresh seafood, flown in daily from the Mediterranean. 

Their menu revolves around seafood that are cooked to your liking: Fried, bbqd, steamed. Everything is priced by weight, with whole fishes averaging at $25-$40. The calamari and shirmp can range anywhere from $5 to $20, it really depends how much you want!

My first visit, I dined alone; and opted for the bass plate served with rice and a salad, along with a small order of the fried calamari. The fish was tasty, however I prefer a whole fish rather than just a fillet. The calamari was fresh and hot, however gets soggy over time, so squeeze some lemon and this quickly!

My second visit I came with a friend, and ordered a whole seabream (flown in from Greece today) sinigiri style (extra spicy). After being served some appetizers of baba ganoush, home made hot sauce, hummus, salad, and fresh pita bread, the fish came out with a plate of rice.

The fish was butterflied and cooked over a grill giving the fish a smokey taste. The fish itself was well seasoned and had many different flavour profiles with the squeeze of lemon: spicy, salty, sour. 

The fish tasted very fresh and it was just the perfect size for 2 people ($30). The owner is a very kind man who works hard at serving the best and freshest seafood.  Parking can be tight, as the place is located dead-smack in the middle of a strip mall.

{"text":"I feel kind of bad being the first to ruin the 5-star rating, but ah well. This review is for takeout that I got at 1:30pm on a weekday while in the area though, so it's probably not the most representative dining experience.

The food I ordered was just very unexceptional. Grilled salmon was rather greasy on the outside, and dry on the inside. I was pretty disappointed given that salmon steak is actually my favourite type of fish - I much prefer it to filet since it's more flavourful. Unfortunately the taste of this one just fell short. The salad was good, mostly owing to the heavy touch of olive oil in the dressing. I also got a side of pickles to try, which I enjoyed BUT warning: it's definitely an acquired taste lol.

Service was pretty warm and friendly; then again, there was literally one other customer in the restaurant so there really is no excuse for poor service. Food came out very quickly (again, as expected). The place overall was quite nice in terms of ambience and space (no rubbing up against your neighbours here!). Perhaps I simply ordered the wrong thing? Will check out the other location next time :)"}

{"text":"One of the best grilled fish and calamari/ shrimp fry i had. The place wasn't fancy and we were bit sketchy but the food was just amazing. The starters baba gounoush, hot salsa, 2 other dips and salad filled us up. You pick your fish and pay by it's  weight. Ordered singari style sea bass, sea bream bbq style and 1 pound shrimp and calamari fry. The singari style bass was the best out of all. Definitely recommending."}
{"text":"Amazing food and a great looking restaurant.
Fresh and great quality fish cooked in fillets or in an Egyptian style reminiscent of Alexandria. Super nice owner and very helpful"}
{"text":"Love the place! Very kind, people friendly. Fish is fresh & made to order. The menu is a little confusing, just have to ask. The fresh pita bread, along with the hummus is amazing! Been going on a regular basis"}
{"text":"The food is very tasty and fresh. You choose the fish you wanna it, the sauce you wanna cook it with, and the cooking method. The bread, humos, baba gnoj, and salad are complimentry. Excellent customer service, and amazing of sea food taste.
The best!!"}
{"text":"The lady provided me with a free drink, when I showed them the yelp promotion. 

Between 2 not-so hungry girls, we chose a plate of fish and chips, and the half lbs calamari/shrimp mix. We knew 1/2 lb isn't alot, the seafood mix came out to be about the size of my fist, with a basket of fries on the side. Although all the food was good, we both agreed the best value is the fish and chip. 

We chose the cod, as it was in the lower price point.  The fish was flaky and tasty. The batter was not overwhelming and light. My friend witness the lady take the whole fish that was on display, to the kitchen in the back for instant fillet and cook.

I will return for JUST the fish and chips.  Please be mindful this is still about $15 for 1 piece."}
{"text":"We were looking for red snapper for my father-in-law. My husband called on Sunday and Hesham the owner made sure to have red snapper for our visit on Monday. We had sea bream, red snapper, grilled and fried shrimp, calamari, and seafood soup. The sides were salad, tahini, baba ganoush and humus. Everything that we had was AMAZING and it was the best baba ganoush that I have ever had!! We had absolutely no leftovers.  The owner was so nice and the service was great. We would definitely recommend Mermaid! They also have takeout. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Came here today for lunch and for what it is, this place is really great. They cook your food fresh on the spot. We ordered spicy seabream cooked singari style, with a side order of calamari and rice. The seabream was absolutely delicious. The calamari was also really tasty and was fried with a light batter. Will definitely come back to try the seabass and other fish."}
{"text":"Definitely worth the trip. Everything was cooked perfectly. Had calamari, halibut fish and chips, and shrimp. The quality of food was a plant surprise. Definitely will come back for more"}
{"text":"Delicious! Service could be very slow depending on the day but worth it! Just go early or call first to see how busy they are. I've had the haddock fish and chips and bass and they are just delicioso. The fries are really good too. Very affordable as well."}
{"text":"Ate here with girlfriend, fish was absolutely amazing! 
Both of us enjoyed our meals and portions were very large. 

Don't worry, it does not smell fishy inside because of the raw fish, actually didn't have any smell as all.

The owner is very friendly and helps you make your fish choice if you tell him what you feel like."}
{"text":"Location/Area is pretty sketchy looking. 
This little restaurant is located in a small strip plaza.

So.. The decor is meh~ Can't complain much from where it is standing.  The food is pretty good. I ordered grilled basa with fries $9.99 and delicious 1/2lbs  fried calamari with fries for $9.99. The fried calamari was so tasty and so addicting!! I wanted more more more!!!

The salad and sides are decent, nothing to rave about.

I have to be honest, at first I came in having low expectations of this restaurant because of the surroundings. But it surprised me that the food was actually tasty and the owner seems like a really nice guy.  

Although, I probably won't be back, first being because  the location is pretty far from where I am, second being the area is just too sketchy for me  to feel comfortable to eat at. 

But by all means, this is one of the best fairly low priced fresh seafood restaurant you can get around! 

Would definetly recommend you to give it a try !! And must must must get the fried calamari!!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent for the price. You can get a 4 piece basa and fries for something like $8. The fish pieces are quite small, so I think you'd need 3-4 to fill you up (unless you have a small appetite). They do have an option for 2 fish + fries though. I did like the fish... not the best I've had (high batter: fish ratio), but good for the price.  

Wife got the 4 piece haddock + fries which was about $12. I actually couldn't really distinguish between the haddock and the cheaper basa, although she said that she could. But my recommendation is to stick with the basa to save some $$. 

If I'd read the reviews before I came, I would've tried the calamari and/ or grilled fish. Will try those next time. 

Parking lot out front. Accepts credit card. 5% yelp check in discount"}
{"text":"Do NOT go here expecting traditional \"fish AND chips\", because, while they do indeed fry freshly battered fish, and at a very good price, they curiously serve anemic frozen supermarket french fries to accompany the fish, rather than freshly cut chips, as one would expect from any \"fish & chips joint\". Any reviewer that calls these french fries delicious, must be the same ones who call Pizza Pizza exceptional Italian food, and keep it #1 in Ontario. Lol. 

If they instead cut their own chips from fresh potatoes, like any respectable fish & chip shop does, it would lower food costs for them, and be a massively better product for the customer.

On the other hand, if you don't mind paying a bit of a premium for well-prepared, fresh fish, but in a questionable neighborhood, you could do much worse than coming here for a dinner of nicely grilled, hand selected, fresh fish of the day.

The neighborhood, and the plaza are sketchy, and the restaurant itself is odd and kitschy, but the fish is very fresh, and delicious, especially if prepared by the very charming owner in the traditional singari bbq style, which is much enjoyed by the largely Arab/Egyptian clientele, and accompanied by yummy fresh babaganoush, ok hummus, lightly seasoned rice, salad, and vegetables, plus pedestrian supermarket pita bread.

We found the grilled fish to be excellent, especially if you skip the cheaper bream ($30*) and purchase a quality whole Snapper ($39*) or Grouper ($$*) etc., the kalamari ($22 lb*) and fried shrimp ($26 lb*) to be solid, the owner Hesham, to be an enthusiastic, friendly man, but the prices to be a tiny bit on the high side, *based on changing market prices, especially given the location and ambiance.

Overall, this place gets a solid 3 stars, which would be upped to 4 stars with fresh-cut fries, and/or the addition of fried scallops (my fave), and/or better pricing, but that is based on only one visit, and I will be back."}
{"text":"delicious! 
my fianc√© and I were sitting in another popular seafood restaurant around the corner from this one when we discovered that the fish and chips were only sold at lunch. 
so we took to Yelp to find an alternative to drive to to fulfill our fish and chips craving.
The reviews are super accurate. small, quaint and delicious.
We both had basa fish and chips which did not disappoint."}
{"text":"Amazing, fresh seafood. Service was very mom and pop style. Rice and fries weren't their speciality. But would definitely recommend the seafood!"}
{"text":"So happy we found this place! The owner and service is super friendly and the food is DELICIOUS! First time we went we tried the seabream singari style, grilled shrimp, fried shrimp and calamari and our friends got the red snapper singari style. Both fish were super fresh and grilled perfectly and the grilled shrimp came in this vinegary butter sauce that was so good we kept dipping everything in it. The fried shrimp and calamari came with fries and everything was cooked perfectly. The fries were super crispy. Yum!  The second time we went we had the sea bass singari style, grilled shrimp and fried calamari again. The sea bass was even better than the two previous fish we tried. The grilled shrimp didn't come in the same sauce as last time but it was just as delicious. The owner also graciously gave us a salad, hummus and baba ganush both times we went. Can't wait to come back and try some of the other dishes."}
{"text":"By far the worst fish and chips i have ever had!

First off the place is filthy, walking in to the place and the floor was sticky like a movie theater.

Food was way more expensive than what is on there online menu, and it was horrible!!

The fish was soggy and tasted like nothing, and the fries were half cooked and super oily, had to wash my hands twice after eating.

DO  NOT go here if you want fish and chips, you have been warned!"}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday lunch for a friend and we all enjoyed the food..the owners were great and hospitable. We ordered an order of haddock fish and chips (halibut was sold out), shrimps with rice, fresh grilled seabream and a side of baba ganoush. All the food was deliciously favoured and grilled perfectly. The fish and chips had a great batter and the portions were a lot for the chips, rice and pita bread. The only complaint would be that the side of baba ganoush was small for $3.99. It should have been priced at a lower amount based on the portion size."}
{"text":"I do indeed have two checkins here...though the first was parking lot only as I would've assumed they'd be open for lunch on a weekday by 12:15. Turns out they open at 1pm apart from Fridays when they open at noon.

Having learned my lesson and checked their hours, I planned my second visit. I was going to go with a couple coworkers, but it snowballed and we had about a dozen of us. Fortunately, they take reservations and the owner suggested that I call ahead with the orders. Brilliant idea which probably shaved off nearly a half hour of ordering and waiting time.

Some in our group went for the fish and chips. Most reported it was pretty good, though I didn't hear any comments of it being amazing or anything. My own take was I could find F&C anywhere; rather I'd want to go for what they're famous and unique for. 

I went in family style with a couple others and ordered the grilled bass fish singari style. I can't fully described what the singari taste is, but it's a bit peppery with citrus taste to it. The fish is fresh since they literally pull it off the ice on display, and then prepare it. It was cooked perfectly, and deboned. 

As others have mentioned, the babaganoush really stands out - almost surprisingly for just how good it is. It almost has a smokey flavour and the texture is a lot more appetizing than others i've had. The hummus wasn't as remarkable, but still pretty good.

I loved the freshness and taste of the food. Truly a pretty unique experience, especially for what appears to only be a hole in the wall."}
{"text":"Great food, me and my partner got the fresh grilled fish. Mine was sea bass and his was the sea bream, both in Singari style. For sides we got salad and rice, both were on the small side and we wished they were bigger portions. 

Price is decent for the size of the fish you get but not for the whole meal which includes the two sides. The area is a little sketchy and the restaurant itself is very small but we will likely be back because the fish is so good. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Went after seeing reviews. Got only fish and chips. Price was affordable and fish okay. Didn't try the popular fish on the menu. May try next time. Small establishment and not very inviting, ambience so-so, felt like that of a fast food joint. May give the restaurant another try."}
{"text":"What a concept and what DELICIOUS food!! 

1. Pick your seafood at the counter, it's all sitting on ice. A plus if you know how to pick fresh seafood. They weigh it and give you a price.
2. Tell them how you'd like it cooked (they have a variety of styles, but apparently you can ask them to do it however you want)
3. Choose your sides.
4. Wait at your table. Try to contain your excitement. CONTAIN YOUR EXCITEMENT.
5. EAT.

Came here with a couple of friends for dinner. We chose the sea bream Singari style (deboned and grilled with seasoning) and deep fried calamari. For our sides we had salad, fries and rice. The seafood was incredibly fresh and the calamari was cooked perfectly. Not a chewy bite to be found, and not greasy at all. The fries were also perfect. The fish reminded me of seafood that I've had on vacations to seaside/oceanside towns. The man at the counter was able to tell us where the fish was from and also recommended options to us. 

Service is incredibly warm and friendly. 

Check this place out! Parking can be pretty dicey as it's a busy strip mall."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh fish and friendly service. Stumbled upon this place using yelp and went back with another friend. We all love it! So reasonable as well."}
{"text":"It's hard to find good fresh fish restaurant in Toronto. This is a true gem in one of the more ghetto areas in the GTA. Most seafood places use frozen seafood. And I've never been a fan of fish n chips. Deep frying takes away some of the fresh seafood flavors of fish.

Don't let the outside fool you, this isn't a sandwich place. This is a place where you can get good seafood. They have fish n chips for a somewhat reasonable price. But IMO if you get fish n chips here you're missing out. You need to get their fresh seafood which they display in the front. They have various fish, shrimp, calamari, and mussel. Prices by weight. 

We don't visit the area often so we went all out. We had 1 fish, some calamari, and some shrimp. The calamari we had fried and it was one of the most fresh, and chewy calamari we ever had. The shrimps were ok, we had them bbq style. Big, and juicy with that fresh flavor. We had a fish singari style. It wasn't as good as we expected but it was still ok. I was expecting more flavor but I don't find anything incredible about \"singari\" style. 

Overall, I would definitely recommend this place. Fresh seafood is not cheap. But this place isn't terribly expensive. The restaurant is not much to look at. It's one of those places you come exclusively for the food, not for atmosphere."}
{"text":"This restaurant is in my neighborhood, so i came in for fish and chips. The fries were not like any fries I had eaten before. They didn't have much taste, i don't think they were deep fried. I think the fish was okay."}
{"text":"We all want to find those hidden gems.  You know, the tucked away place that makes a few dishes shockingly well?  The thing is, mostly there will be something about them that sucks.  Sure, a few dishes will explode in your mouth, but most items will disappoint or the service will be poor or some other thing.

Not here.  Mermaid Fish and Grill House proved to be an exceptional.  An amazing experience all round.

I was in the neighborhood with family and searched Yelp reviews by rating.  A few people seemed to give it decent ratings to I stopped by for lunch.  A few minutes too early, we waited outside until it opened.  Some graffiti artists had driven by and I saw them trying to negotiate with an employee there, offering to redo their signs.  They were rejected.

While I would have rejected them and their shabbily painted cube van, they did have a point.  The place is in a strip mall, replete with about four barbershops (I counted).  The windows are covered with shoddy pictures of their fish and other offerings.  All in all, there is no hint that this place is the gold-mine that it is.  I was concerned.  But what the hell, my parents and I needed a quick bite...

Entering, I was surprised.  While it's not a fine dining ambiance by any stretch of the imagination, it's a clean, sit-down place.  The catch of the day is well-laid out on ice by the cashier.  You pick your fish, calamari, or other items, they weigh it, and you pay by the poundage.  They'll serve it grilled, baked, tagine (spicy north aftrican cooking style), or a mix of the above.

We ordered the Tilapia and Calamari.  Tagine all.  We were NOT disappointed.  The Tagine was phenomenal.  Spicy, but just enough for flavor, with the tang of the tomatoes not overshadowed and enhanced with just enough lemon.  The hummus and other sauces were top-notch.  I commented to my family that this was pretty much how I remember home-made hummus (which is a HUGE compliment).  We didn't order any special rice, but the side of rice came with shrimp and a goodly amount of spices mixed in.

They kept bringing fishes and giving service that surprised me.  The cook?  Very friendly and helpful.  The staff?  Always coming to our table.  Even the water they brought had some limes and other flavorings tossed in that gave it just that extra edge.  And the caviar?  What?  Did I order a caviar condiment?  

No, but they brought it anyways.

We had such a good time, were so impressed, that I told my family that the food was too good there, we had to make it a celebration.  So we did."}
{"text":"Got the grilled white bass and WOW! Unbelievably delicious. Flaky, soft, juicy...wonderfully spiced! Came with rice and salad. It's not super cheap, but not crazy expensive either. But worth every penny! Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. We came at 1 pm or 2 pm for late lunch. We were the only ones in the restaurant and were served by the owner Hashem. He was courteous, friendly, and very helpful (made great recommendations). The place was clean and the decor was a bit tacky, but fun.

The food was simply amazing. The baba ganoush is tasty and very flavorful. My fish was grilled. The meat was moist and succulent, well seasoned and cooked perfectly. My wife's fish was fried. Hers was crispy without being oily. The fish is amazingly fresh and the preparation is quick. This is really a jewel of a place."}
{"text":"Mermaid Fish and Grill House is an Egyptian owned casual Mediterranean seafood restaurant that is located in a small strip plaza in Scarborough.

I dropped by on a Friday afternoon since I'm always on the lookout for great restaurants in Scarborough. I ordered the basa fillet plate ($10.99 plus tax) which comes with two basa fillets, rice or fries and a salad and some fresh calamari ($7.60 plus tax) which you have the option of choosing barbeque, fried or tagine, I went with the fried. I didn't want the calamari plate, so the owner gave me the option of choosing how much calamari i wanted and priced it by weight.

It took about ten minutes for my food to be made which is very reasonable for food that is made to order. First the fried calamari was cooked perfectly with a light batter. The seasoning is different than say Greek calamari because Egyptians use paprika instead of just salt and pepper but nonetheless it was pretty good. The basa fillet plate was also very good, the fish was cooked perfectly with nice seasoning, the brown rice was good and the salad was fresh.The food isn't amazing but it's definitely pretty good and very reasonably priced. Fresh seafood isn't cheap unfortunately.

The restaurant is small, casual and clean. The service is really good and friendly. At the time I went on a Friday afternoon, it was one waitstaff and the owner who was looking after the grill and front which was adequate.

If you're looking for delicious healthy Mediterranean seafood cuisine at a reasonable price, I definitely recommend this restaurant especially if you're in the Scarborough area."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out on a Friday night after reading about it in Toronto Life. I brought my dad along since he loves trying out new restaurants and we are all fans of fresh seafood. The five of us arrived at 7pm and realized that we should have planned this better. The restaurant is very small and a table of 8 was reserved for a party that hadn't arrived yet. They didn't have enough tables left for us and we were told it would be 20 minutes or more before a table would be free. I asked him to call my cell phone when a table was ready since there was clearly no space in the restaurant for the 5 of us to wait. Unfortunately, the plaza offered little amusement while we waited 30 minutes. The owner suggested we order in advance to help things along which we did: 1) half pound fried calamari (with fries), 2) half pound BBQ shrimp (with rice), 3) red snapper Singari-style (with rice).

We were finally seated after 7:30pm and were served free pita bread with babaganoush (smoky and delicious) and hummus (just ok). We were given a plate of salad, followed by our orders of calamari, BBQ shrimp and rice shortly after. The fish arrived and eventually... the fries (after I asked). The calamari was very tender with light and crispy batter. The BBQ shrimp was perfectly cooked with fantastic char and deep, smoky flavour. The fish was also incredible, perfectly executed and nicely seasoned. Overall, the food was truly enjoyable and extremely fresh. The seafood was definitely the star of the show, so much that despite a few other issues, I would still give this place 4 stars. 

About those issues... Service needs some work unfortunately. The whole seating thing kind of upset me: When we arrived, a table of 4 was being used by two people. The reserved table of 8 ended up being only 5 diners. There was an unoccupied two-top when we arrived which could have been combined with the other spare seats to \"spare\" us the long wait. When you have two young kids in tow, these kinds of things make a difference. I had to request glasses of water. I had to remind them about my order of fries. The salad was literally swimming in so much vinegar that the waiter spilled it and the server had to mop up the puddle on the floor afterwards. I think we were supposed to get a third dip for our pita bread but we didn't."}
{"text":"Haven't eaten in in a while. Did today. They got tablecloths and they clean them. It's lovely. We saw a lady using some kind of sanitary spray on them too.

They've upped their prices. $4.99 for 2 piece basa and chips. $7.99 for 4 pieces. Most of the other prices seem to have gone up as well.

Tried the calamari tagine today. Tagine tastes like tomato stew? It's got bits of celery and stuff in it. Calamari was tender, as usual. Hesham (the owner) gave us flatbread and a trio of dips (hummus, baba ganoush, and something I don't recognize) on the house. He also gave us some home fries to try. Home fries were lovely. Crispy and not overly greasy. My parents got the 4 piece basa and switched the chips to salad. The basa was also amazing, as always. They very clearly put seasoning into their batter (you can see it in). Huge bonus is that it doesn't leave that gross batter aftertaste/texture in your mouth after. 

Total damage for today (1/2 lb calamari tagine + 4 piece basa fish and chips) is about $20 after tax, but before tip. We had leftovers too =)

Oh. They supposedly have WiFi. I didn't try it though."}
{"text":"Last week, my friend suggested an Egyptian fish restaurant that she had found, Mermaid Fish and Grill House. This St Clair location is the newer one after having been in Scarborough for some time already. The restaurant was a mix of formal and informal; nice dark-coloured tables and chairs with some benches, lots of bright fish-themed pictures along the walls, laminated menus that showed the various options, then a fresh-fish counter at the back where you choose your fish. The server was quite helpful in explaining the various options, and the food came in a reasonable time considering everything is made fresh when ordered.

I had the Basa Platter, which was a large fillet with rice and salad. I think my friend chose the fresh sea bass and had it done Singari-style, where they fillet the whole fish, season it, and then bake. Everything was very good, the fish was tender and very flavourful, as was the rice. Other options for the fresh fish were to have it barbecued or fried; other platters include salmon or shrimp or calamari, as well as a few types of fish and chips. For drinks, they have pop / juice / water.

Overall, a very hearty lunch, large portions excellently prepared. At market prices, some of the fish can be rather expensive, but pretty much the same as you would pay elsewhere for the same. Our bill came to $54 for two. I would certainly recommend a visit if looking for a quality fish plate."}
{"text":"I am craving for grilled food this summer!
Found Mermaid Fish on Yelp and \"sent\" husband to order some takeout on a late summer night:P. 
There was indeed only the nice owner serving food that night. Ordered the whole fish (fresh, a bit too light for me), the best fried calamari I've tasted so far. Rice looks ordinary but you just can't stop eating it....
We both love eggplants hence the baba ganoush !
Overall, slightly pricy but worth going back for more!"}
{"text":"Food is OK,  drab drab decor not that I was expecting much to begin with,  seems out of place,  nothing special like the reviews would have you believe,  basic mom+pop, not terrible and not noteworthy to enough to garner a second visit"}
{"text":"Mermaid fish and grill house is a simple place to enjoy some fresh seafood in a relaxed spot. While I wasn't blown away, I was impressed with the freshness of the food, and the hominess of the service and restaurant. I'm glad I came here to try some new things. 

This might be confusing so I'll explain how it works: you can choose a lot of varieties of fish here (note: you pay per fish here and not by pound), and then order them to be cooked in a variety of ways - in singari style (more on that later), fried, grilled, barbequed, with potatoes, etc. A lot of yelpers seemed to have gotten the grilled seabream in singari style so that is what we ordered. It was really light tasting with primarily cumin coming through with some other spices, and it wasn't overpowering at all. Lemon, tomatoes, and onions also added to the overall taste. It was actually very simple and I liked the simplicity of it. I expected more flavor and for it to be a tad more grilled but it was still very tasty. The fish was very fresh and flaky. We also ordered grilled Basa fillet, which again was seasoned very lightly and was tasty.

We also went with a pound of calamari, half fried, the other half grilled. I did enjoy the fried one more. Both were quite tender. The fried one was crispy and the grilled one tasted somewhat similar to the singari style. I was really hoping for some kind of tomato based dipping sauce to cut some of that oil but we just ended up dipping them into our hummus and baba ganoush.

All set meals come with a small order of salad, with an option of fries or rice. Salad was lightly dressed in an oil based vinegrette and the fries were Costco-eque - the Cavendish extra crispy ones, and I was never a big fan of them in the first place (lack of potato, and overly salty) so I would suggest going for the rice which was really fragrant and has some delicious mushrooms in there. We were also given hummus, pita, and baba ganoush as appetizers which were nice compliments to the meals."}
{"text":"3.5-4 stars. The fish is fresh. Taste good, (but below expectation from the 4.5 stars review ). The staff is friendly and nice, but he charged me the price of 1 lb calamari, when I ordered half pounds. In general, this place good to have a try."}
{"text":"Love the seafood market/eatery all in one concept; you can't eat seafood any fresher than this! Small but clean eatery with no fishy smell. Whole fish, fillets, steaks, calamari and shrimp on ice. 

WHAT TO DO?
- order per pound: market prices are posted on back wall. Keep in mind the fish are shipped by air mostly from Turkey or Greece so it's reflected in the price.
-tell them how you want it cooked: fried, baked with potato or barbecued (with wheat bran, oil and garlic and lemon, Singari style - mild or spicy)
- grab a drink from the refrigerated case or enjoy their water infused with lemon and mint (see my pretty pic).
- seat yourself
- enjoy the complimentary pitas with their house made sauces (hot sauce, tartar, smoky baba ghanoush, hummus) and fresh salad.
- the side rice (you can substitute fries as a side or have half rice and half fries) that comes with your meal is ok. When the owner saw we weren't thrilled with the rice, he insisted on cooking us his special seafood rice. It was aromatic and flavored with big succulent shrimp, mussels, calamari and crab; you can taste the freshness in the seafood.
- staff delivers your meal to your table. We had the pompano Singari style medium spicy (should have ordered it hot) - fish was cooked perfectly. We also had the fried calamari: the small pieces still had some chew to them (hubby's style) and the large pieces were tender (just the way I like them).

The owner, Hesham, was the one who served us because two of his staff called in sick. He was running a one man show today: host, cook, server, cashier, and clean up crew. Lovely, jovial man with a beautiful smile. He was an engineer back home in Alexander, Egypt but that didn't work out because his true passion was in fishing and cooking. Impeccable service! Will definitely recommend this place to friends and family."}
{"text":"Cute little place with unbelievable tasty seafood. Cooked to perfection.  You pick your own fish and they make it for you. The lady at the front was super nice and friendly. She helped me decide on the fish and the best way to cook it. Everything was delicious. The fish and chips were amazing. Calamari and shrimp amazing."}
{"text":"I've lived in the area for a few years and was surprised I just found out about this place now.

Came in wanting to get the fish and chips but the owner recommended the fresh fish and boy are we glad we did!

The experience was fun, we got to select the seafood we wanted, it was weighted and we got told the price we would have to pay. You also get to pick how you would it to be cooked.

We got the sea bass grilled in the Singari style. We were told it was the most popular and I can see why! It was seasoned with cumin and topped with tomatoes and onions. So delicious! The sea bass was deboned, fresh and grilled to perfection. The price is dependent on weight and we paid around $20 for ours.

We also ordered the breaded calamari. It was tender but quite expensive at $11 for a  1/2 pound. I've had better calamari elsewhere. 

I didn't like the fact that water bottles were brought out when asked if we wanted water and we were charged for them. It wasn't a huge deal the delicious fish and the friendly service won over the night. I definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Tried the Fish and Chips. I found it average but I girlfriend loved it. Would go back to try the grilled fishes next time. They definitely looked far more appealing and fresh."}
{"text":"I like good fish and I wasn't a fan of there fish at all. Mine was all dry and didn't have much flavor!!!!"}
{"text":"4.5 STARS

So let's say you have about $5-6 in your pocket and you're thinking what on earth could I spend this on?  Some crap at the dollar store...perhaps a combo meal at a fast food place OR you could come here and order the 2 piece fried basa with fries...for get this..$4.99!  BAM!  Yeah I just let out the secret.  This place is D-to-the-licious! 

It's a small place in a nondescript plaza.  Definitely not first date material (if you are dining in...maybe 4th date).  There are only a few tables and they have some cheesy netting on the ceiling.  But look past that and order the fish, you would NOT be disappointed.

My fish has a lovely golden fried crust on it, while the inside was perfectly cooked.  Light, crunchy and flaky.  Oh so damn good!  I inhaled those 2 pieces

My friend had the shrimp (sold by either 1/2 or 1 lb) grilled with some sauce (can't remember) and it was the most succulent and flavourful shrimp I have eaten in a long time (and not the puny shrimp, nice big pieces).  We got the 1/2 for $17.99 and it comes with a plate of fries and a salad.  I believe with their fish and chips you can substitute the fries for rice or salad for an extra $1.

I am definitely going back again...like maybe tonite :)"}
{"text":"The service was very friendly. Fresh fish on ice in the front display for you to choose. Been here twice, once for the lunch special and once for dinner. Notice that it doesn't smell fishy in here, but rather fresh like the ocean. 

Come here for a quality seafood meal. It won't be a cheap dine but there's great value here for the money."}
{"text":"Quality food doesn't always have to be expensive & fancy. I got the basa fish with rice ($11ish), and my friend got the fried basa with fries ($7ish). We both really enjoyed our meals and were very satisfied with the large serving size for a good price. My fish tasted very fresh and was seasoned really simple but was still super tasty. Rice could of had a bit more flavour but overall, it tasted just like a home cooked meal. It's a fairly small place, and it's easy to miss since it doesn't look like much, but I would definitely recommend checking this place out. The waitress was also very friendly, and overall the place is my definition of comfort food, will be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"My fellow Yelpers certainly did not disappoint with this one. This is one of those places where you have high expectations going in but once you're inside and you look around andyou have serious doubts. As shady as this place may look, as un-inviting as it seems, you should stay.

I had high expectations going in and most of the time that is the perfect setup for huge disappointments. One too many times have I walked away scratching my head wondering what was all that hype about? No.. not this time.

These guys deliver! The food is homey and spectacular! The seafood is is incredibly fresh, tender and ridiculously delicious! And I haven't even gotten to the fries! What?? The story goes like this. I was offered rice with my meal but I am wasn't quite feeling it that day. The guy over the counter cheerily says \"I make-a you da fresh fries\" (with a heavy accent). I looked at him all weird and scared but I couldn't say no to fresh.

The fries took this meal over-the-top! As much as I enjoyed the seafood, I couldn't stop eating the hand-cut fresh fries as ridiculous as it sounds.

O ya, the decor sucks and there's no service. Pretty much everything else sucks but the food is top notch. And if you don't like the sight of dead seafood to accompany your meal then you should avoid. Otherwise, this is place is a gem and it is a must visit."}
{"text":"This place is a hole in the wall, but we exited off the DVP and Lawrence stumbled across the place via yelp. Surprised to say that the food was pretty decent, got 3 dinners with fish 1/2 pound of shrimps $54 that is the cheapest price for fresh quality seafood! Its prepared in front of you and the fish is fresh to cook so is the shrimp... If the place was prettier id have given it 5*."}
{"text":"I can't say I'd ever noticed this place before yesterday. I had some time between clients and this place was in vicinity. 

Outside, they have a partial menu posted and nothing on that appeared appropriate for 1 person. Regardless I went inside to investigate further.

They are both a restaurant and a fish market. An additional menu was posted inside with individual meals.

I decided to have their fish and chips. The cod was really fresh and the light batter hit the spot. The fries were also fresh. Easily one of the best fish and chips I've had in a while. 

Lots of seating is available and prices are reasonable. Servers could be slightly more attentive. After I got my meal, I never saw them again (although they did yell thank you as I was leaving).

Overall, if you like fish this is a must-try."}
{"text":"I know people have been raving about this place so nothing more to add. This is truly a hidden gem which is steps from the St. Clair sibway station. I really hope people support this small hole-in-the-wall place so it doesn't close. The seafood is fresh, how they cook it is simple but flavorful, the service is quick and non-obtrusive, and the dining area is really spacious. We've had our fish cooked different ways and so far all have been hits - I'd recommend Pharohs if you want it a bit more spicy, and lemon and garlic if you want to taste more of the fish meat. Also they're other stuff like the calamari and shrimp are also good quality. I would definitely recommend this place if you want a seafood fix!"}
{"text":"I had the fish and chips with one piece of basa. The server was very informative and nice. And the portion sizes were great for the cheap price! I paid $7 for one piece of basa fish with the chips. My friend got a rice platter also with basa. My fish was fried perfectly and the chips were crispy and not too salty. I tried a piece of my friend's fish and it was seasoned very nicely. I will be back to try the other fish dishes!"}
{"text":"Our expectations were much higher when we drove 50km to come to this place.
The food is average, no complain but nothing special either.

We had grilled Basa Fillet and Salmon Fillet. We cannot endorse it as \"fresh\", but it was ok. The server and service just made it to the mark of average."}
{"text":"It's actually very fresh and tasted really good. Only problem is it's too pricey! It was $20 around , where other restaurants take max $15"}
{"text":"5 stars for this small fish restaurant: good quality mediterranean fish and good appetizers.
Very decent prices and friendly owner :-)
Freshly made, but could improve on the quality of the shrimps. Too many fried options, luckily what was grilled was delicious.
Delivers in the area.
Will come back. definitely."}
{"text":"Came here on a weekend during the afternoon. It just opened and no one was inside. I was expecting this place to have a weird fishy smell due to the seafood being 5 ft from the table. However that wasn't the case. The owners were welcoming and handed us our menus. 

We got the calamari with fries as well as the 2 pieces of halibut. The calamari was fried perfectly it was soft and flavourful with the lemon. Nothing is more frustrating the chewy overcooked calamari. The 2 pieces of fish were huge..enough to feed 2 people if you include the order of fries....and oh man the fries. Crunch on the outside, fluffy on the inside. They are fried twice, once to cook and once to make them crunchy and crispy. They definitely know what they are doing. 

Its a little pricier then most restaurants but it is well worth it. If you want seafood and fries cooked to perfection head over here."}
{"text":"This place is what one would call, \"don't judge a resturant by its extrior\"! I came across this place through yelp and decided to go by the spot and was a bit hesitant about eating here due to the sketchy plaza. But once you go though the door, you feel as if you're at an intimate fish market as all their seafood is fresh, with you selecting the fish of your choice based on the catch that day. I have came back here on several ocassions with my parents, friends and my boyfriend; and all have been pleased with the food and friendly service.

My personal reccomendations of must gets at this place is the spicy Singari styled grilled fish, spicy grilled shrimp and Egyptian rice. But honestly, everything here is damn good and well priced. It has become my favorite seafood spot!"}
{"text":"Saturday morning and looking for a food lesson for the boys.  From the outside, I wasn't sure what to expect but on entering we found ourselves in a clean, fresh smelling, bistro style restaurant with blue checkered table clothes and a mediterranean feel.  We picked out our fish from the helpful staff.  The fish laid out is very fresh.  They make it custom to order.  

Hummus, baba ganoush, all home made and fresh.  The portions are very generous.  Calimari cooked to perfection.  

5% discount was great from checking in on Yelp."}
{"text":"I can vouch that this is one of the best seafood joints in the GTA....I was craving for some seafood in the area and didn't feel like paying for the high prices at Diana's so I thought I gave this place a try and I am glad I have found this place....its in a strip mall on Lawrence and I would not even notice it if I hadn't went into the plaza....very small place with probably about 8 tables max....

They had a little seafood counter with various fishes such as seabass and tilapia, where you pick the fish you want and they will prepare it for you in different styles such as grilled or fried....the owner was very kind to talk about the different fish and their taste, we decided to get the seafood grilled and deboned.....it was sooooooooo fresh and delicious, the fish combo came with salad, side of fries or rice and pita bread with dipping sauce like hummus, we also got a 1/2 pound of calamari and let me tell you this is real authentic calamari that is freshly cut, you can see it in the seafood counter and it is just lightly breaded, BEST calamari in Toronto period, the calamari also came with a  generous portion of fries....the owner was nice enough to give us some complementary grilled shrimps to try

All this came out to $33 tax in, what a deal for seafood that is generally pricy in Toronto.....portions are huge here, the 2 things we ordered could have fed another person

Will definitely come back and try other the other things, heard the fish n chips here are pretty"}
{"text":"Great find! In town working for a few days and saw this as 4.5 stars. Don't let the outside or inside fool you. The owner is super friendly and prepares some amazing grilled fresh fish. We tried a few different styles and my friends mom had fish n chips. All of it was awesome. Grilled shrimp too! And their hummus was amazing! Definitely worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Just walking by from Yonge to Sobeys, and saw their sign for Shawarma. Had a bit of an appetite, so why not just try it out. I walked in, up the steps to the counter and ordered. Overall it took around 10 minutes to get my sandwich. But meanwhile I looked at all the fish menus around and they looked DELICIOUS! If I wasn't in a rush, I would love to sit down and try out their fish, but today was for Shawarma! Cost me around 7$ for the chicken pita, and it was worth every dollar! Chicken was well cooked, the sauces fitted in just right, the hot sauce just spicy enough for me. Everything was just right for my taste. Definitely going to try again!"}
{"text":"Its my 1st time coming here. A friend recommended it to me and it was beyond incredible. The owner was soo friendly and the food tasted amazing. Very clean place. This is def a hidden gem :)
Pricing is also very reasonable"}
{"text":"It's as close to a great hole-in-a-wall place for fish-and-chips as it can be. Batter was light and crispy, not oily at all. We can really taste the difference between the cod, haddock and basa that we have ordered. I was a little disappointed that they ran out of halibut for the day. But it's all good, made us try every other fish on the menu 

However, as much as we loved the fish, the one that took the top spot for us was the Tagine Calamari Platter! The calamari was made so soft and nice that I could have eaten it even without teeth... I do have teeth, btw. LOL

We went to the Lawrence and Victoria Park store. Apparently, there's also one in Yonge and St. Clair. We'll definitely come back.

You owe it to yourself to try it out."}
{"text":"Fresh squid, fish, and shrimp cooked to order. Yum! Definitely would pick fries over rice though."}
{"text":"Takes a while for the fish to arrive on your table but it is definitely worth the wait. You get to pick the fish you want from a fresh selection and hoe you want it cooked. Pricing is based off weight and type. The fish were seasoned perfectly and we gobbled it down hastily."}
{"text":"I had lunch today at Mermaid Fish and Grill House.  The sign outside advertising shawarmas had caught my eye so I went in.  They seem to focus on fish and the inside smelled a bit of fish.

I ordered a chicken shawarma.  There were lots of condiments I could have included but I just got chicken, tomatoes, hummus and tahini.  It was a good shawarma.  After it was filled, it was grilled for a bit to heat everything up.

The fella at the counter was friendly.

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I went to the Mermaid Fish and Grill House restaurant for dinner. It is a brightly lit, plainly decorated diner restaurant that offers middle east food and fish meals. You go to the counter and ordered your meal. There were a fish counter where you can choose your fish and how you want to cook it

I ordered the haddock fish and chip. It took around 25 minutes for my meal to arrive I got two large pieces of haddock that were delicious. The fries also were pretty good. The only issue I had was that there wasn't enough tartar sauce.

The service was not very good. The counter person was gruff and impatient. Also I did not get any water which left me very thirsty.

Would I got back? Probably since the food was pretty. But the service could be improved."}
{"text":"Had the seabass grilled with some fried shrimp and a tahini sauce. Everything was fresh and excellent. 
Very warm and friendly service. Will certainly be coming back."}
{"text":"Food is ok but please be aware of scam techniques they use. I ordered takeout two times. First time - Fish and chips (Basa, 1 piece) and got very nice, big piece that could be almost shared. The last time I order the same thing but I asked for a two piece menu version. Obviously the more expensive option compered to the first but I got exactly the same thing where the one fish bigger fillet was only cut into two pieces. Not cool so I won't be returning there any time soon..."}
{"text":"My meal: butterflied sea bass cooked in the style of singari, deep fried calamari, bbq shrimp, salad, rice, 2 dips, french fries, naan

Yes, I shared it with 3 others who thought the same as I...damn that fish was cooked perfectly! On point with the texture, and seasoning! 

This was my second visit and have declared this deep fried calamari the best in Toronto!^^ Lightly battered and again on point with the texture...cooked to a perfect tender bite!

Service - it can get really busy with takeout orders and only one staff working O.o"}
{"text":"Best fish and chips in Scarborough. So fresh and light, I'd come back in a heartbeat. 

Halibut and chips 4pc $19.99
Calamari 1/2lb $9.99 with side 

Fish was lightly battered and not greasy. Calamari was generously cut and so soft. It was amazing. 

There was absolutely nothing there that was horrible. Even the water was fancy! Glass bottle with lime and mint. Faaaancy!

I've been waiting for a fish and chips place that could rival the ones I had in Australia and this place definitely comes close. A slice of heaven in a cold winter scarbs.

The owner is so sweet! Very nice guy and gave us extra tartar sauce :) he gave us 10% when he didn't have to, thank you!"}
{"text":"I like some of their dishes, staff is nice. Price is a bit much, but I guess it's somewhat reasonable being seafood - although there are more competitive places I know of. D√©cor is super simple - can use a little reno. I've been there once. I might go back if in the area and REALLY wants seafood, but otherwise, not too likely."}
{"text":"Yes.  2.5 stars.  For the price point they charge,  the service should be reflective. Not a cafeteria bare bones style with sit down pricing.  There a a large selection of fish but I found the sea bream (porgy) and sea bass lacking any flavour/ natural sweetness.   There are spices but still a little bland. For approx 30/ fish,  I do expect a little better than mushy fish texture.  The calamari  (half pound) was again lacking flavour and a bit chewy.   Again I am comparing by price point of similarly priced restaurants.   I have tried and will seek out other alternatives going forward."}

The setup of Mermaid Fish and Grill House does remind me of my trip to Spain where I was visiting restaurants right by the ocean with the Catch of the Day. Of course, it is not fair to compare that experience to what Toronto can offers where ocean is no where in sight and in the coldest month of winter.

Mermaid Fish is quite impressive compares to what one would expect in a small strip plaza in Scarborough. 

Selection of Fish cooked when order based on the type and the size. For the night I was there they have: Sea Bream, Sea Bass and Grouper/Shrimps/Calamari.

We shared:

Grilled Sea Bream Singari Style ($25) with Rice and Salad
Deep Fried Calamari ($6)
Fish and Chips: Halibut 2 pc ($10)
Side of Naan Bread and Dip Complimentary

The verdict:
- Calamari was the best dish of the evening. The batter so light and the calamari so tender
- Grilled Fish was nicely done. The seasoning was really light but enjoyable
- Fish and Chips though a huge disappointment! The 2 small piece of fish was heavily battered and the fries was not cooked properly with some of them still raw. The fries were cold too by the time it was served to us.
- The rice and the side salad were meh

The owner is really nice and friendly. I really appreciate the Yelp check in offers of 5% off. 

Will I be back? Probably for the Calamari and the smile and the hospitality of the nice owner."}
{"text":"This place is a bad place because the price is depend on your nationality.. If you are egiption he will give you a good price and if you are not he will play with the price. The fish scale is not shown up for the customer, so he give you what ever a price and weight he wants. The first time I pay 100 dollar and we leave hungry from the restaurant, the second time he charge us 130 dollar. I think this place is not worth going because he is cheating people. If me and my family go to red lobster we pay less than that and we leave the restaurant more than full. Also we show him the 5 percent discount but when we leave we find that he is a layer and he did not give us the discount."}
{"text":"Love love this place since our first visit there. I am so happy we found this place during one of our trips to Scarborough.  
It's a small family-run restaurant with less than 10 small tables; staff are super friendly and helpful. This restaurant is quite far from us but it's worth the drive for fresh seafood. 

They have different types of fish, squid, mussels, crab sitting on ice. The selections vary depends on what's available that day. The concept is simple and genuine: You pick what you want from the selections of the day; they charge by weight; and chefs will turn into delicious food. 

We come here a few times and have tried: 
1. Calamari: this is one of the best calamari in the GTA. It can be grilled or fried; comes with rice or fries/salad. 
Fried calamari was so so good, well seasoned, tender and crispy with the light batter.
Grilled calamari was equally delicous. My husband prefers this to fried. You can taste the freshness and quite flavourful. 

2. Fish and chips. Fish tasted fresh and not overly battered or greasy; came with generous portion of fries. It's very cheap too. 

3. Bbq singari style seabass was so good. Fish was just over a pound. You can choose one of the 5 styles. We went with bbq singari and were  happy with it. It came with rice or fries. 

4. Pita with home made hummus and baba ganoush were good. Pita was warmed up on the grill and went well with the dips. 

We were pleased with food and friendliness of staff. Will return to try other items"}
{"text":"My group ordered a variety of menu items. We got the calamari, haddock fish and chips, fried shrimp and their basa fish platter. Out of all these items, i would have to say their basa fish platter and shrimp ($30 for 1 pound, a bit overpriced because you get around 13 shrimps) had the most amount of flavour. I would recommend those two items, very good! Their fries are also amazing, so if you're a fry lover you're gonna love em, very crispy! On to the fish and chips, the Haddock we ordered was very bland. I had to sprinkle quite a bit of salt and eat it with alot of tartar sauce to really enjoy it.  

If you check in, you can get 5% off your meal!"}
{"text":"A few years back I visited the location on Lawrence and loved it and so I was really excited to see that there was a new location near St. Clair Station - much more convenient for me.

The location is quite a bit bigger than the Scarborough location, but the food is still equally wonderful. 

My partner and I ordered whole Singari style fish. This style is marinated with garlic, salt, lemon and cumin then after being barbecued, it is topped with tomatoes and onions. 

While we waited we had some baba ganoush and hummus. They both were wonderful but the baba ganoush was particularly good with a delightful smoky flavour. It was so good I'm not sure I will be able to enjoy any that I get elsewhere - they won't compare.

The fish was perfectly grilled and moist. A single fish was enough for the two of us to share.  When the fish arrived, all conversation stopped. We were both focused on the delicious fish. Though we were absolutely stuffed at the end of the meal we also were sad that it was over - the food was just that good.

We'll definitely be back again - especially now that there's a more convenient location."}
