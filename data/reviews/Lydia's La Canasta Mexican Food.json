{"text":"Delicious. We come for lunch as often as possible. The only downside is the teeny tiny shot cups for salsa and hot sauce."}
{"text":"Love this place! Went to the wrong one a few weeks ago and was disappointed. I am so happy I found the correct one. Amazing food everything fresh and the staff is super nice. Muy bien!!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  It ain't fancy but it has great  food, reasonable prices, and friendly staff.  Best green chile in town."}
{"text":"Chips and salsa are the best!!!! The red Chile burrito and green Chile burrito are the best ...... if you want to try a breakfast I would say the pancake breakfast or the egg and bacon there so oooh good friendly staff too ..."}
{"text":"This place has great food better than some restaurants here in phoenix. The the guy at the register kept apologizing for been late with food when it had only been 10 mins after we irdered 10 more mins later and we got our food. They also have art for sale which i enjoyed seen the paintings that decorate the restaurant."}
{"text":"The problem with a lot of restaurants in recent times isn't the quality in the food, it's the poor quality customer service and even worse customer treatment.  I felt I was treated in a demeaning way simply because I asked to have my beans separated from the deep fried burrito -so that by the time I made it home the bottom of my burrito would not be soggy from the beans. This turned into a rude and condescending talking down given to me by the proprietor. I worked in catering so I know inventory costs are a consideration-but was the 5-10 cents saved for the additional container really worth losing a 20yr loyal customer!"}
{"text":"Omg.  The food is so good I had to write this before leaving.   We are here for breakfast.  The blending of flavors is unreal.   So good!!!     My husband had eggs,  machaca and green chili.   He is currently experiencing a food-gasm.  I had a vegetarian breakfast burrito.    I never want this to end . . ."}
{"text":"So good and priced well! Their fresh tortillas are amazing! Buy a bag of them on your way out. The staff is friendly and Their salsa and chips buffet is great! Can't miss the pink building!"}
{"text":"Great chorizo & egg burrito. Red & green sauce is great! Will return many more times!!!"}
{"text":"Service is good. Menudo buffet is worth the trip but everything else is overpriced for value of food."}
{"text":"I have been hearing for years how this restaurant was the best Mexican food I would ever taste. N its true, it melts in your mouth!!! Literally"}
{"text":"I've been going to La Canasta for as long as I can recall. I live in Tempe and can't go as often as I'd  like but I go at least once a month. I love this Canasta because they have a green chile salsa and menudo every day! Always quick and fresh. I either get the ground beef tacos (yummy), the red chile burrito (watch out), or the menudo (got a hangover?). It is very consistent and prices, well it adds up, but it is worth it. I have yet to have a bad experience after 28 years!"}
{"text":"Worst mexican food restaurant I have had in my life, and Im Mexican!!!!!!!!!.  I order a green chile burrito, which basically consists of green el pato sauce from a can, and cubed beef from a can.   hahaahahhahahahahahaha this place is a jocke!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and a really bad one!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely dirty didn't even get to order so gross    and unprofessional unorganized environment its a shame the appearance ran me out of there"}
{"text":"Take the meanest rodeo bull in history: 'Bodacious', carve him up into tiny chunks, and serve him in a green chile burrito and you'll come fairly close to one of La Canasta's delights.  The meat was like a dog's chew toy, save for the chirp when I bit into it. They should discount any menu items containing chunks of beef due to their DIY tenderizing.  They should also have a conspicuous warning on the menu reading:                                                 !!   WARNING  !!  OUR BEEF PRODUCTS REQUIRE CHEWING.  LOTS AND LOTS OF CHEWING.  IF YOU POSSESS ALL 32 ADULT TEETH, PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK!             IMPROPERLY CHEWED CHUNKS OF OUR BEEF COULD RESULT IN A HIDEOUS, BYSTANDER-REPULSING DEATH FROM CHOKING FOLLOWED BY ASPHYXIATION SINCE ITS PRETTY MUCH A LOCK NO-ONE HERE WILL KNOW, PRETEND TO KNOW, HEARD THE TERM OR EVEN PRONOUNCE 'HEIMLICH MANEUVER'.   ACCORDINGLY, MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDS A CHEWING REGIMEN SIMILAR TO A STARVING HYENA; MAULING, GNAWING, AND EVENTUAL MASTICATION.            THANK YOU, MANAGEMENT  Stopping here was NOT my idea.  My spouse, who still lives in the eighties, will do anything to once again sample their green chile of yesteryear. I keep telling her it doesn't exist, but she keeps sending me back every few months, hoping it was 'just a bad batch'.  Tonight's bad batch left her with five chunks of un-chewed beef on her plate, followed by a bathroom clearing bout of diarrhea. My bean burrito was really tasty, as usual.   Five stars for their bean burritos. I'm deducting four stars for their diarrhea inducing comida that cheated me out of my Friday night freak."}
{"text":"The best Red and Green Chili period. Been going here since 1978. Still same owner family with upgraded storefront"}
{"text":"It was nice it was opened at 6 o'clock in the morning.  anything you want on the menu at that time. Breakfast lunch or dinner I had the chimichanga and it was delicious. I will be going back for sure"}
{"text":"Never coming back plain and simple. We called in an order and they were nice over the phone until we arrived to pick it up. First we checked to make sure the order was correct and it wasn't so we asked to get it fixed and they got upset like it was our fault. I had clearly mentioned how we needed our order of tacos. My son like his tacos plain it's very simple, but still managed to add toppings. Then when he actually started eating them they tasted awful, and at first I thought maybe he's exaggerating. Nope I tried them and honestly had to spit it out (sorry tmi). I was concerned about trying the menudo and it did not taste good at all. It was super greasy the meat was super big and some of the pieces of the meat I wasn't even sure it was the correct meat you expect in a menudo. The garnishes that were provided were green onion, cilantro, and 2 lemons for 3 bowls of menudo. If anyone knows this is not what you put in your menudo only the lemon... Also the bread they gave us was very hard and chewy and again not the correct bread you pair with menudo. So basically it was like throwing away $40 in the trash. Never coming back."}
{"text":"Awesome place enjoyed it so much I went there twice while I was on business in Phoenix.    Amazing green chili sauce.  Burritos are huge but can get pricey if you keep adding on extras.   If you dine in they have an all you can eat chip option (flour and corn) and a good selection of salsa."}
{"text":"Green chili burros are awesome! Nice chunks of soft pork in a very tasty green chili sauce. The salsa also is distinctive, they put something extra in it, great w chips and also on the burros. Street neighborhood is run down but no worry the food is the best."}
{"text":"This is the best La canasta restaurant in phoenix..It has been here years..Its family owned. The food is great and on SAt and Sunday they have the best menudo...yummy....Its very clean,friendly..delicous food...."}
{"text":"this place is great for Breakfast and Lunch.  we stop by about once a month, usually for breakfast (the nana's breakfast w/green chili)  The inside is small, and not many seats inside, but we always make it work.  The area is very \"questionable\" though, and i think it's the reason it's not open after dark.    major downside to this place is the parking.  the small lot is SMALL, tight spots, and anytime i pull out we almost get hit cause of the blind exit so be careful"}
{"text":"Great food full of flavor! Very reasonable prices too. We has the breakfast plates and were very good. They have menudo every day and differnrt types of salsa. 99 cents for unlimited chips and salsa. Will come back here again!"}
{"text":"Haven't been here since I was a kid. I grew up down the street on Melvin and couldn't believe Lydias was still around when I was looking on maps. I'll be home in August and am coming by to grab a bite to eat!   Good food never dies out!"}
{"text":"I have been to this location many times. The owner is very rude. My co workers have experienced the same service. They nickel and dime you for EVERYTHING. I ordered a bean burro enchilada style. I was charged extra for the enchilada style, which I expect. When I got the burro it barely had any sauce on it. I asked for a little more sauce and was told it would be another dollar on top of already paying for enchilada style. On another occasion I asked for a taco with just guacamole, no meat. I got the taco with guacamole and meat. When I asked to have the meat removed she wanted to charge me for that. I had already paid extra for the guacamole and asked for no meat. I also had a piece of broken plate in a burro there once. When I called to let them know they wanted me to bring back the broken piece of plate. No apology whatsoever! I will never go back and I recommend you don't either."}
{"text":"One of the best Menudos in Phoenix and it's all you can eat ! 7 days a week ! ....I make my own Menudo and pozole and if I dont wanna make it I come here ...all you can eat with your choice of bread or fresh tortillas and chip and salsa bar .......delicious Menudo ..not canned and home made"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I grew up not to far away from it.  I now reside in Oklahoma and we always make sure to put this on at least one stop sometimes we go back again  Their menudo is hands down the best I've ever had. I also love their fry bread. Let's not forget their salsa bar, I sure would love to learn how to make their salsa !! If you in the area be sure to stop by, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Awesome menudo, both red and white, and you can even get it buffet style (All You Can Eat) Great customer service, don't remember her name, but while I was there, she made sure chips and salsa bar was stocked and fresh and clean, menudo bar clean and fresh, will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"MY VEGETARIAN DAUGHTER WAS FED MEAT. today 11/26/2016 my daughter ordered green cheese enchiladas she asked the cashier Luz does it have meat she said no. My 12 yr old has not ate meet in 2 years. After we ate to our surprise we found meat.  I tried to address the issue not even an apology the cook said well what do u want me to do ABOUT IT?? Shame bad service my daughter has strong beliefs in not eating meat and u guys did not give a rats ass about it. Now my baby is making herself through up . ALL BECAUSE OF LYDIAS CANASTA FEEDING HER MEAT!!!!"}
{"text":"A random stop by while checking out a brewery nearby. We ordered the nachos and carne asada tacos (3). Both were very filling and exceeded expectations. The nachos with green chile was delicious and not too spicy. I wish they allowed us to pack some of the toppings at the buffet bar but it was for dine in only. If there is a next time, I shall get fat with multiple servings of chips/salsa!!"}
{"text":"Picked up the nachos and carne asada tacos. Both were really good! Didn't try the red chile, but the green chile on the nachos was amazing. The tortilla chips themselves were amazing too.  If I'm in the area next time, I'll probably dine in since they have buffet style tortilla chips, salsa, cilantro, onions, etc."}
{"text":"This La Canasta is OK. I'm sure some of you have your favorites but this defiantly is not mine.  We went here at lunch and it was busy but not over packed. It was around noon.  They don't clean off tables as soon as people leave so we were standing awkwardly asking them to please clean the table.  The waitress looked at us with this are you talking to me look on her face when we asked if we could get a table cleaned so we could sit down.  The chip area is a mess.  My food didn't arrive until half my coworkers were done eating.  I ordered the soup and when I went up to check on it they looked around for my ticket and then said it takes a little longer to make the soup.  BS you make that stuff in the morning.  You just have to slop it in a bowl and put in the microwave.  I know how it works back in the kitchen.  Finally my soup came 20 minutes later.  Do they offer me a refund? No of course not.    To be fair the food is good.  But its the same food at every la canasta its owned by the same family.  This particular one is part of a group so you can consider it a local chain not a mom and pop.  They also own Silvia's.    I would recommend not going to this one as the staff is terrible.  There is a way better one right off 7th ave in Phoenix."}
{"text":"The tacos are good. The salsa is os not worth paying extra for. The chips are basic but cooked in house so pretty fresh. The menudo bar is not something that looks remotely safe to eat from because it's free standing in a self serve caddy like you would put salsa in next to a door. No thanks."}
{"text":"The beans and rice here is fantastic. The tacos? Not so much which is a shame because tacos + beans & rice is a fantastic meal. I don't know if the tacos are made the same, but the very last time I ordered them, they were no good. The taco grease destroyed the bottom of the taco making in inedible. My Nana and mom love the burritos, tamales, and the chips. Yummy. Good place to go but avoid the tacos."}
{"text":"We are regulars here and at another La Canasta location. Every time we go, the food is delicious and fresh. The salsa is TO DIE FOR. I always make sure I get my pint of salsa and pound of chips every visit. It won't go to waste in my house. My favorite items are the red enchiladas, quesadillas, and carne asada burrito. My boyfriend lives for their machaca burrito."}
{"text":"I guess since they feel like they are the only game in town now that Oxaca is closed, La Canasta has the SLOWEST service and cavilier attitude of \"who cares if you had to wait.\"  I'm soo done w/ the excessive wait; unfriendly attitude of probably a son of the owner.  I'm going to take my business to Carolina's despite the distance.  I can't stand that arrogant attitude esp. since the area is soo in need of another competitior."}
