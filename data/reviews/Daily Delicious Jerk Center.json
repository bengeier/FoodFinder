{"text":"When a roti costs $12-15 there is a problem...maybe they are loosing business and need the money for rent.  Oh and that was the sale price!  On top of it the roti's were cold!"}
{"text":"Ackee & Saltfish! No longer an Ackee & Saltfish VIRGIN as I got a small portion of Jamaica's national dish. I can see why it was only available for Breakfast before as the Ackee had Scrambled Egg consistency. 

Ackee reminds me of a bit of Durian with the mushy texture except with more VIBRANT yellow color. There wasn't an abundance of Saltfish within the Ackee but enough to give it a savoury flavour while black peppers and other spices give it a spiciness.

Ackee & Saltfish is A-OK and it is definitely a good alternative for VEGETARIANS but I miss my Jerk Chicken and Curry Goat.  Student Special & Lunch Specials keep this place going which I'm glad to see."}
{"text":"Why! Why did this place have to close their doors?! It was so so good. 

I was craving stewed chicken for lunch today. I walked back and forth staring at the other restaurants and grocers, thinking to myself that I must have been on crack. I swore I had been here many times, but was it just a delicious dream?"}
