{"text":"Their burgers are big and delicious with generous fries, and veggies.  Would definitely recommend eating in, it seems to have a nice bar and restaurant atmosphere, with curteous decent servers.   Nice place to meet up, hang out with friends, and just watch the game on their large screen TVs.    Cheers."}
{"text":"Good for: Drinks. Watching a game (many TVs).  Not so good for: Food: Soggy Calamari, the saddest \"Greek\" salad I've ever eaten. Also not good if you want to just chill with your friends as they will ask you if you don't mind sharing tables with others (Not really given much of a choice, either). With a packed restaurant you are making money, asking if people could share tables felt desperate and money hungry.  The service was also disappointing. Our server seemed angry, didn't talk to us, and watched my husband as he was using the debit machine."}
{"text":"We're new to this neighbourhood and thrilled about this restaurant. We've enjoyed four meals here and each one has been excellent. It's been our experience that the food takes a little longer to prepare, but it always comes out hot and delicious. The service is friendly and attentive. The vibe is great and the prices are more than fair. I recommend without hesitation."}
{"text":"We just walked out, very annoyed and very hungry. Let me set it up for you:  It's a Sunday and we went there for brunch.  There were only 3 tables occupied, including us.  The obvious conclusion: not busy at all. Another conclusion: we will get fed pretty quickly.   WE WERE SO VERY WRONG because 45 minutes in, still no food, which is unacceptable even on a crazy busy day. We wasted so much time! And we have a busy Sunday planned! I am pissed.   I do not recommend going here. And I definitely will not go back. Even if I'm starving and it's the only place open.   And FYI, the 1 star is there only because Yelp does not allow zero star."}
{"text":"Obviously the bartenders do not have any experience or adequate training. Selection is poor and the food are over priced for the quality being advertised. There are plenty of other bars in the area that provide over the top customer service and  quality for a fraction of a cost to what the longest yard is demanding."}
{"text":"Definitely my favourite neighbourhood pub.  Friendly staff and outstanding food.  Their wings are local, fresh and never frozen.  Some of the best wings in Toronto."}
{"text":"I came in for lunch with a colleague and I tried their burger and fries. The burger was cooked to well done and it suffered from the consequent dryness. If this burger had been cooked to medium or medium well, it would have been a much better burger experience.   The fries were pretty good, but not particularly memorable.   I would recommend asking for your burger to be cooked to a lesser doneness if you are worried about a dry patty.   The service was warm, friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"We've been countless times for breakfast and brunch and have never been disappointed. I'm a huge fan of their eggs maritime. Staff is friendly, and the menu has a good variety. They also have a small patio outside for enjoying drinks on warm summer days."}
{"text":"I don't understand why restaurants do this: Be cheap.  We ordered wings today and in the take out package we found exactly one carrot and one celery stick. They shouldn't have put anything in if there was such a shortage. At least I would have said, \"Oh, they forgot, that's OK\". I would have paid them more if I it meant I could get more vegetables. Oh well. They saved a few cents, lost a customer and received a poor review on Yelp."}
{"text":"Typical bar food.  But not worth the price.  Avoid the pizza. It's not even real pizza, so thin it disappears as you touch it."}
{"text":"Found a luscious grey hair in my drink... It was replaced but I still had to pay for it. I was thoroughly disgusted and unimpressed with their solution and lack of concern when I brought it up. It means a lot to a customer when you receive an apology and prompt action towards resolving an issue.   I ordered salad... Being gluten free it was one of my slim options. So basic. I feel guilty paying for something like that. It was a teaspoon of store bought dressing and some lettuce. The only props going to them are that they used Renee's Caesar dressing.   My boyfriend picked a burger and fries... basic.  Sad.  We came here to indulge his \"I used to live around here and eat here sometimes\" thing and left wishing we had wasted our money on subway."}
{"text":"My wife and I have gone here for brunch countless times and are never disappointed by the friendly staff and fresh quality ingedients.  Their meat is local and organic and it shows.  I strongly recommend it for weekend brunch or a light dinner.  The portions are small... But adequate.  I only mention it because if your are use to gluttonous portions when you hit your local pub, you may be disappointed.  The prices are not great... But the value is apparent and u can tell the ingredients are worth what you pay.  I can't say you'll be blown away by the plain atmoshpere but like I said, the brunch on weekends is really what I love most and it's never too busy to get a table, a refreshing change in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to try this place forever and I'm glad I did! Great drink selections, nice front patio, and nice friendly service! Food was yum and the fries made your mouth water (what is IN that seasoning) it's apparently a secret recipe! Definitely will go back since it's a super chill, great value and decent pricing."}
{"text":"I've been a few times over the last couple months and like pretty much every other place on this stretch of Bloor St, I have good but not great feelings about it.  My favourite thing so far is the lamb burger. I've had it a couple times and it was quite good, despite one time being a bit dry (a common risk of ground lamb). I also had a chicken and red pepper panini which admittedly looked awesome but was actually rather bland to the point of having to dip it in ketchup to finish it.   The food is good, the service is adequate, and prices are reasonable. I'll continue to come here every once in a while until something better opens nearby, I suppose."}
{"text":"Been going here for the Super Bowl (Go Pats!) for the last five years (I think) and even though it's not perfect, my buddies and I have no real need to search for a new place. I think the reason we chose it in the first place was that it was fairly equidistant between a few of our places and wound up a good compromise (i.e. Mississauga person doesn't have to trek downtown and vice-versa) with its proximity to the Islington subway station being the ultimate clincher. It's the one single day of the year I have to take the bus (on account of wanting to enjoy LOTS of beer and not spend a fortune on a cab ride) so Longest Yard it is!  They always have lots of pretty sweet Super Bowl specials (notably half price pizza and chili, both of which are very good), various giveaways and the usual prize squares etc. I do miss the \"buckets of Bud\" (4 bottles for $10!!) that they used to have but I guess it was probably too good to be true...oh well, not one of my favourite brands anyways. Still the cheque worked out to something like 65 bucks per person for the five of us and considering we were there drinking for a solid five hours and each ordered at least one plate of food, I think that's more than reasonable. But my beloved Patriots won, so I wasn't TOO concerned with the amount of the bill!  Other than one time (not during the Super Bowl) the service has always been just fine, especially during the big game and what has to be one of the busiest days of the year...not sure what other people are complaining about but I don't see it. John (the manager) and Debra (the owner) were both there and were more than friendly. They were even willing to accommodate some rather daft people who didn't think to make reservations...seriously people, Super Bowl! What are you thinking!? Call ahead!  I do have a few quibbles but they're not huge. There is the one aforementioned time I was there with a large party and the service was pretty horrible but again, it seems to be an aberration.   The TVs are a little small for my liking when it comes to watching a major sporting event and even though it is something of a gastropub rather than a sports bar, the flat screens are a little puny. I know it's a bit of a fine balance considering that bigger screens might otherwise be obnoxious given the place's layout and general vibe but a little bit larger really would improve my enjoyment of the game. That being said I'm truthfully not a huge fan of massive screens that take up the entire place or TVs at every table so it is a tough call.  Finally, they actually ran out of chicken wings! One of my buddies went to order some close to half time and they were sold out! I'm a vegetarian so it didn't affect me personally but come on guys. I don't care how busy it is (fairly but it wasn't a madhouse), you don't run out of wings on Super Bowl Sunday. Pretty weak-sauce.  Overall though the food is almost always very good (got to mention the nachos, they're among the best around), nice selection of beer on draught and the place has a crisp, clean modern look. Nothing about it is really earth shattering but it's totally a great neighbourhood pub that, well, isn't in my neighbourhood!  So although I may not usually go out of my way to drop in, we'll definitely keep it at the top of our Super Bowl list, provided it remains convenient for all parties involved!  Oh and don't run out of wings again, please. My friend Eric is usually pretty easygoing but he's a hungry boy and if he misses out on chicken two years in a row...well, I don't want to be held responsible for what happens."}
{"text":"I went there with a bunch of colleagues one night after work for some drinks.    The service, especially John the manager, was exceptional.  Very friendly and polite waitresses, attentive, drinks arrived on time, etc.  My complaints were that it was way too hot in there (early August) that people were sweating (I don't think they had air conditioning), the only toilet in the ladies room downstairs was clogged but the bathroom itself was clean, my beer was warmish and the food portions were small.   Again, very nice staff but nobody wants to be sweating during happy hour."}
{"text":"We tried The Longest Yard (Bloor location) a couple of weeks ago for the first time. The location is nice and the food was pretty good but the service was horrible.   We're pretty nice and friendly people but the waitress seemed indifferent and uninterested in her job. She took our orders and it took quite a while to receive our drinks...even though there was only 3 of us, she somehow managed to only deliver 2 drinks. We asked about the third drink and it eventually arrived.   Our food seemed to take longer than expected even though it was just 3 burgers. The waitress also managed to get our orders wrong too (fries instead of salad). She got that fixed up and then delivered the corrected order with no salad dressing. We asked for it but she never got around to bringing it. She was too busy chatting with another waitress or farting around with balloons. Finally, some busboy was kind enough to get us salad dressing.   At the end of our meal, the waitress seemed to wake up and warm up a bit but really, was it because she figured she better show some effort for tip time? Like its sister located on Mt Pleasant, The Longest Yard on Bloor offers up pretty good food but very poor service."}
{"text":"I've been to the longest yard up at Mount Pleasant and Davisville but this one is different. It lacks the same cozy feel that you want in a pub and the layout seems to be an afterthought. For some reason this place just has a very cold feeling and considering the food was just ok and the beer selection nothing special, I don't think I will be returning. It's a real shame because I feel like this place could have so much potential and if only they put the same effort on the interior and food as they did on the outside."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere terrible service. Will give it another chance as we may have just ended up with the one bad waitress. Each drink took far too long to arrive and we were often forgotten. Had to ask four times for a glass of water. Really liked the vibe and crowd."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Friday evening to try and satisfy a poutine craving.  Ended up ordering the organic beef burger ($8.95) with a side of poutine ($3.99).  Poutine was okay...no curds but fries were good and decent gravy coverage.  Burger was flavourful.  We also ordered the small nachos ($8.50) which for the price was quite tiny. Pints were $6+ each so a bit on the pricey side.    Overall, a nice neighbourhood pub and better than the Firkin down the street which I have found to be one of the most depressing pubs in Toronto.  Just one visit and you'll see what I mean.  The Longest Yard feels like BWV's Dr. Generocity's but further west."}
{"text":"Met up with a few business colleagues for dinner last night.  I will only comment on my meal. It was the first time in a long time since my last visit. Had my go-to meal - roast beef au jus - and it was fine. Not a large portion of beef, the bun was warm and soft, the au jus was quite nice.  Overall, an ok meal but nothing to really write home about.  One thing - the baguette might have been cut by the chef. It came in one large piece that was hard to handle on its own."}
