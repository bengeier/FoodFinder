{"text":"When I want to eat korean food at FMP, I only get bibimbap. Out of the two korean stalls that sell bibimbap, this place offers the better choice. Here is why:  1. Larger side dish portions - some people don't like the sides but I do so the more the better. Also their kimchi tastes fresher and they don't replace their sweet potatoes with the spring rolls you can get from the frozen aisle in the supermarket.   2. Better rice. Last time I had bibimbap at the other korean stall (I believe its just called Korean BBQ) the rice was mushy! Seriously? Never had this problem at korean express."}
{"text":"The pork bone soup is actually pretty good here.  You get more than enough side dishes as well.    I recently tried the pork tofu soup,  pleasantly surprised I might say.   Although I think it needed more meat.  But,  am a meat person. Lol"}
{"text":"My new go to place for Korean food takeout!  Great tasting combos: beef bulgogi, grilled mackerel, bibimbap....  A bit dry with the chicken katsu.  Though the order had generous portions.  We call in advance for take-out as we noticed it does take a bit of time to cook up.  Not so express after all?  Though food is tasty and we do come back."}
{"text":"Great soup and side dishes. Almost five stars, but need to sample the other dishes to be sure.  The kimchi is good and the pork bone soup is huge! Can feed two easily!  Obviously since it's in a stone bowl, expect a 10-15 minute wait, but it's worth it. It's like going to a restaurant, but without the hassles."}
{"text":"The best pork bone soup you can get in the GTA . everything here is ethier really good  or good, they have excelent kimchi on mondays or sometimes late sundays. but i wish they could offer some spicy cold buckwheet noodles"}
{"text":"The ladies that work out front aren't going to give you amazing service. They wont tell you how long it's going to take, or that they charge extra for takeout. But the food is a great quantity, and youre not sacrificing quality for price. I paid 11.25 for chicken katsu, it comes in a large portion, with all of the sides including a small miso soup. Im not exactly coming a distance for a food court location, but if youre in the area I would recommend."}
{"text":"Like the food sooooo much! Really yummy~ I've tried hundred of times~ The pork bone soup is my favorate!"}
{"text":"Came here for takeout on a Tuesday night. I got the bulgogi bento box ($10.10). Overall it was okay. You get what you pay for.  Pros: - cheap (comparatively, bulgogi at other korean restaurants nearby would be $5-$10 more expensive) - substantial amount of food (sides include spring roll, 1 kimbap, japchae, bean sprouts, etc.)  Cons: - the bulgogi was a bit dry but still tasty  - the spring roll was soggy, but I did get take out so I didn't expect it to taste as fresh and crispy  - cash only, no receipts   I did see everyone else after me get the pork bone soup, so I will be back to try that. The service wasn't bad. I went at around 7:30pm and only waited a few minutes for my food."}
{"text":"although it's located in the foodcourt, I find their food better than most korean restaurants. been coming here for years!!"}
{"text":"Their side dish is YUMMY!! so far I only tried Pork Bone Soup, it only cost $6.25 + tax = $7.00 Cheap & Tasty!! Most pork bone soup price go up alot but only this place remain good value and good quality! I have to mention their side dish again, large portion, fresh, and delicuous! :)"}
{"text":"What's with the loud music and singing and dancing by the owner? It's disturbing. She seems \"high\""}
{"text":"I don't normally leave reviews but I'd be doing a disservice if I didn't for this place. The Bulgogi here is literally the best I've ever had by far! Korean is my fav cuisine so I've sampled a lot of Bulgogi from all over the GTA. I keep coming back to this place just for the same dish. Forget the fact that it's in a food court. You will not find better Bulgogi anywhere!"}
{"text":"Got japchae (glass potato noodles and beef) number 8. Said if I add a dollar they would give me all japchae instead of half japchae, half rice. Was pretty expensive. $10 plus tax.   They didn't give me a drink or any side dishes. I got takeout so found out when I got home. Only a soup. No kimchi, potato, no side dishes at all or drink.   Tasted okay, it was really bland. I was hoping the japchae would be the same stuff they put in the side dishes. The japchae in the side dishes had egg and was very sweet. Thinner noodles. The japchae they gave me was thick, thicker than ramen. Had no seasoning/bulgogi sauce.   The only good part was the portion size of the japchae was good. THERE WAS BARELY ANY BEEF/BULGOGI. refer to picture attached.   Won't be getting this again"}
{"text":"Decent stuff at decent price. Enjoyed the pork bone soup. Would come here again.  So I did get their pork bone soup again, twice, and they still don't disappoint. So props to them."}
{"text":"If it wasn't clear from the name, this is is a 'fast food' type place, located in the food court at First Markham Place. Now, anyone who knows me knows that I am a big fan of Gamjatang (pork bone soup) and is usually the thing I get the first time I visit a Korean restaurant. This time was no different. So after paying $9 and waiting less than five minutes, my number was called and away I went with a tray of pork bone soup, a bowl of rice, a little dish of sides (kimchi, bean sprouts, jap chae, potatoes).  Typically, I like my Gamjatang on the spicy side, but seeing as this is the first time here, and having learnt my lesson before elsewhere asking for extra spicy, and receiving a melt-your-face Gamjatang, I didn't bother asking for anything special.  The good: the pork was extremely tender and fall off the bone, with the bones easily separating, but not to the point where the bones were falling apart when you breathed on them. The pork meat seemed to have had ample time to soak in the broth, which allowed the flavour of the soup to penetrate into the meat. This is a win in my books.   The okay: the broth had a higher than average salt level which prevented me from consuming as much of it with the rice as I would have liked. There was still a certain underlying savouriness to the broth which made it enjoyable, with a subtly mild amount of heat. But the bottom line here is less salt, more peppers.  This place is good for a quick lunch, although I do feel that there are more, and better Korean places for Gamjatang at very comparable prices."}
{"text":"My sister ordered a spicy seafood noodle here and thoroughly enjoyed her meal. In fact, the order was so large that she could barely even finish it! It was laden with seafood too, and not with inexpensive, cheap, fake seafood like crab cakes, but squid rings, clams, and shrimp!"}
{"text":"Great proportions for that price, comes with decent side dishes. Food tastes great as well. Excellent value."}
{"text":"Great quick dine in or takeout place. Good food, only complaint was that it could have been served hotter. The family that runs the business is very friendly and we tipped them on the way out."}
{"text":"I love coming here when I want some Korean food, especially for the pork bone soup. Great portions and I always have trouble finishing the whole bowl by myself. I noticed that they have increased the price from reading past reviews however it is still a great value and I love that tea and side dishes are also included. My friend tried the mackerel but it wasn't as good."}
{"text":"I started coming here when I started working at a now closed Computer Shop when I was craving some pork bone soup. I walked along inside FMP and noticed that this place had a longer line up and decided to try it. Pork Bone Soup is amazingly tasty and a little spicy as well, with addons like rice, side of kimchi and noodles/potatoes! Whenever I'm close to this area and craving some pork bone soup, this is the place to go!  If the cashier/owner recognizes you, she's bound to give you extra sides and pork bone without tipping!"}
{"text":"I tried the Gamjatang (pork bone soup) and it was just a little over $6. It came with the main soup, bowl of rice, and some side dishes (potatoes, kimchi, bean sprouts, kelp, and starch noodles). I think it was a good sized meal for the price (relative to other food court eateries), but I think the taste could be more spicy. The gamjatang could definitely use more Korean spicyness to it!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best Korean places around. Their pork bone soup is a must-try. Not only that, but the owner is very friendly as well and makes an effort to get to know returning customers!"}
{"text":"THE BEST KOREAN FOOD EVER! Absolutely love the owner. Everything my lips touched I loved."}
{"text":"So good. One of the best kimchi jigaes in town! Tastes better than 80% of restaurants I've been to. The sides are average but their main dishes are great. Lady working there was friendly too."}
{"text":"We come here a lot for the pork bone soup. It is sometimes a tad salty but the flavour of the soup is really good. It's a lot better than Nak Won(which is not as flavourful and has a strong ginger taste) but not as good as the Owl. But for the price you pay, the pork bone soup is great.  We've tried some other dishes too. Had the stone pot rice and the chicken katsu too. Both dishes were quite good and you seen to get a really decent sized portion. The people that work here are all nice and pleasant. Always smiling and welcoming.  Would highly recommend you try the food here."}
{"text":"I like to eat... and for me the food is the star and service and ambiance are important but secondary.  This is a place at the food court in First Markham place. Some of you might scoff at it and say if I want real Korean then I'd go to a restaurant. For me I like to find these gems... The food is authentic, and the execution on the food I'd give 3.5 stars but the personality of the owner easily boosts that to 4.5 stars.  She makes you feel welcome and happy. Points out if you are ordering too much and tries to steer you right.  When she notices we were slowing down she got take out containers ready... and ever offered us some fruit as desert no charge... feels like a family atmosphere... Great customer service enhance the already good food.  We had the staples Pork bone soup, Kalbi, bulgogi box, and tried some out of the ordinary items Kimchi fried rice.  The pork bone soup was good but nice portions of pone and meat.  Cooked for a lonf time and the mean just falls off the bone,  You get a nice richness from the broken down cartilage and fats... a little more spice and perilla leave would be perfect. Kalbi was good as expected... bit the best I've had but good... portion good for the low price.  The other items are also good as expected."}
{"text":"My go to place for Pork Bone Soup!   I had quite a few from various restaurants and take-out, so far this has been my favorite. Meaty pork bone and richly flavored soup. The included sides are delicious too! Own and operated by a Korean lady, so this is authentic!  Wait time can be problematic though. On average it's about a 10-15min wait after ordering. As they only have 2 ppl running the show on most days (the owner and a little old lady in the back). Once in a while they'll have an extra 3rd hand (part-timer)."}
{"text":"Love this place! Love their #20 (Tofu Kimichi) order, I always get it. The owner is super kind and friendly. When I order I ask if i can change something, and she would always allow it. So, whenever I go there, she memorized my order, and also she speaks a bit of Cantonese, but she is korean. If your new to Korean food she would explain to you what each order contains. I would recommend this place. It's affordable, cheap, quick and service is very friendly."}
{"text":"This is probably my favourite place to eat at the food court in First Markham Place.   One of the employees is super cheerful and on my last visit here, she was listening to music, dancing, and singing, while cooking the final meals for the evening. It was definitely a breath of fresh air, since most of the people working in the food court don't exactly look happy to be there.  I've had their rice cakes and bulgogis. Both are very good. The rice cakes have the perfect amount of sweet and spiciness to them with a generous amount of fish cakes. The chicken bulgogi is also very good and the portions are very generous for $10. My favourite thing about Korean Express is that they don't cheap out with the banchan. You get kimchi, soup, japchae, fish cakes, a spring roll, a sushi, and bean sprouts with every meal. The bang for your buck is awesome!"}
{"text":"For the price and the service, I think this is the ultimate Korean take-out in the area! The lady at the counter is so cute and chatty. But most importantly, the pork bone soup ($5.95) is so flavourful! The sides are great too!"}
{"text":"Their kimchi fried rice makes me happy. For a bad day, it'll warm you up and satisfy your hunger!"}
{"text":"Food court quality food. Generous portions at a reasonable price.   The biggest challenge when you've never been to this mall is finding the place. Look for one of the touch screen directories and follow the directions. When you get to the food court look to the right of the stage.  I ordered the #2 Samsun Jam Pong (Spicy seafood noodle soup) and boy was it spicy! It didn't look spicy in the picture but when I got it the broth was bright red. Tasted it a few times and handed it over to my hubby who likes his spice levels hot. Hubby got the ham bone soup. Decent amount of tender meat still left on the bones, broth was ok. The bean sprouts, noodles, potato and kimchi sides were decent.   I would eat here again if I was in this mall and in the mood for Korean food."}
{"text":"Gamjatang for $8.00!  This is one of my go-to's in the FMP food court.  I've only ever had the #5 Gamjatang combo, but it's so good that I can't bring myself to get anything else.  With the combo, you also get a side plate of the appetizers - glass noodles, kimchi, potatoes, bean sprouts.  The portion of meat you get in the Gamjatang is huge too!  I don't think the quality of the gamjatang is anything special, but you get a lot of bang for your buck."}
{"text":"This is my first time trying Korean food express due to the good reviews on Yelp. My BF tried the pork bone soup and found it was very good. It's quite tasty actually and $9 is a decent price. Over-all I would say Korean Food express is definitely one of the better places to get food in this food court.  Now I would try Galleria Supermarket's pork bone soup to compare quality..  Review 3 of 100"}
{"text":"My husband and I frequently return to this wonderful little place and have literally tried every item on the menu. There has never been another place where we can say that every item is good!  Can you find another restaurant that serves better Korean food? Probably, but it will also cost much more. For the reasonable prices they ask, you will not find another place with more generous portions or better taste.  Pork bone soup, spicy seafood noodles, Bim bim bop, spicy chicken with rice, spare ribs with rice, Jeyuk Deopbap (spicy pork with rice) and so on, every item on the menu as delicious and solid as it gets.  The lady at the front is a very nice lady and does everything out of love. Very frequently, other patrons would ask us where we got our food because it looks so good.   NOTE OF CAUTION: since everything is made completely fresh, the wait times can be quite long, sometimes up to 15 - 20 minutes during busy hours. That being said, it is completely worth it!"}
{"text":"This is one of the reasons I love FMP food court for lunch. My office is a few minutes away so this is a great choice for me when I've been dreaming about delicious korean food all morning while doing my work...  The lady that works here is very nice and she's BADASS! She has a shoulder tattoo sleeve, which is rare in korean women. She's always smiley and appreciative of your business. My favourite thing to get here is the naeng myun! Aka, cold noodles for the summertime. OMG, it is delicious!!! Everything is seasoned just right and the chilled broth is to die for... every bite I was taking made me question myself \"Is this deliciousness REALLY happening right now?!?!?\" I also love the jajangmyun.. so creamy and delicious... wow... I am making myself hungry just by writing this review.  The food also comes with typical korean side dishes (jap chae, kimchi, potato..) Prices are typical, not 'chinese food court cheap' but it's reasonable!  Overall a very good choice for a food court and will return."}
{"text":"These guys are right beside Tasty House (crepe shop) in the FMP food court. The staff are friendly and the portions were enormous. One downside was the flavor was fairly uniform throughout and it was pretty heavy on the carbs. Still, a great choice in a hurry."}
{"text":"Simple, authentic and the owner lady was very friendly to recommend dishes or even speak Cantonese! Their soon dubu jigae and Kimchi jigae are always reliable, tasty and steaming hot."}
{"text":"Great food for the price. I ordered bulgogi on rice meal bento to go. The food is always fresh and hot. The bulgogi rice comes with a side of clear noodles, spring roll, kimchi, miso soup, maki roll,  potatoes and beans sprouts.  I always love coming here, the lady is super friendly and cheerful. This is definitely my default food court restaurant at First Markham Place."}
{"text":"The Kimchi fried rice is so worth it. Good portion and really tasty.   The pork bone soup is another good item. Bulgogi bento box is cheap for the amount t of food you get.   Cash only though."}
{"text":"i love this joint!!!!  the pork bone soup is such value for your money!  the bim bim bap or whatever is perfect.  not too much rice and the perfect amount of veggies and meat.  that red sauce is to die for.  so appetizing.  i have not tried the rest of the menu but i will.  two thumbs up for this place.  it's inside first markham place in the food court."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm craving kimbab, I seem to remember this place every time. One of the many food court options at First Markham Place, so there is plenty to choose from even if you aren't feeling like having Korean. The kimbab is on the expensive side but it pairs well with any of the soup options for a substantial healthy meal on the run. If you are eating in the food court, they give you the soup in a heavy ceramic bowl that keeps the soup hot for longer!  Cus who really wants to drink cold soup??  The service is always cheerful and friendly. The owner thanked me for being patient when the person in front of me was struggling to put their order in. Little details and courtesies that you don't usually encounter in a food court environment!!"}
{"text":"This is located at FMP Foodcourt. The lady always have a smile on her face and very friendly! That's the main reason why I go to Korean Food Express over the other ones. Ordered combo #27 (Bulgolgi glass noodle soup) The soup is very light and pretty good for food court food. Very generous portion and the sides are really good!"}
{"text":"Took the recommendation of Amy Z. and got the cold noodles $9 taxes in. Meal comes with small plate of side dishes (potato, bean sprouts, glass noodles, kimchii). The side dishes were all good and tasted fresh. The cold noodles was excellent. Smooth and had good chew to it. You also get some beef slices, raddish and boiled egg. Everything went well together. Portions were filling and it was a refreshing meal on a hot summer day.   For food court type food it is definately really good.  Solid 3.5 stars"}
{"text":"Pork bone soup - meat is good, but the soup is too salty.  Kimchi fried rice is ok..a bit too oily. Overall, food is 3 stars out of 5. Loaded with MSG. I like that the side dishes are warm and not cold like many places. Most likely will not be getting Korean food from this place again."}
{"text":"The lady who works here is so nice and funny! Been coming here a lot more for some quick take out (usually the spicy rice cake dish) and recently tried the kimbab- it's yummy!!! They don't skim on the brushed on sesame oil!"}
{"text":"Me and my sisters favourite Korean food place in town! The portions are great, the food is the best Korean food you can get in the GTA and to top it all off the ladies who work there are THE sweetest most kind ladies ever! It's a food court shop so if you're looking for a fancy place to eat this isn't it, but if you're looking for a great place to kick back and enjoy great food you MUST check this place out! The bibimbap and deokboki are a family favourite, the tofu stew is my personal go to meal! They're also generous with the side dishes, which are included with every meal, as well as green tea!"}
{"text":"Good Hearty Korean Home Food , Cheap, Good size serving, accepts pick -up. What more can you ask for really?? Tried this place on a whim with my EX-BF (now husband) based on the number of people ordering and lining up. We were just looking for a shop at FMP to eat. We were lucky to have discovered such a place. Having it so close to home is a plus . Each order comes with at LEAST 4 different appetizers including a Miso Soup. Dine-In the foodcourt itself and you'll even get good Tea with free refills. Well worth what you pay for. We didn't want to fill ourselves to the brim so we ordered the #13 Pork Cutlet for the two of us and sharing the meal did us just right. We both went home full but NOT overly to the top that you'd feel heavy & bloated wanting to puke it all out.  The Ladies in the counter are very nice as well, original Koreans not Chinese who knows how to cook  Korean cuisine (lol) . Not that I have anything against this but for me just adds a little more credit to the authenticity of the dishes itself.   Get ready to wait a bit though, there's definitely a line although they have a good priority number system so your able to sit down on the tables around while you wait for your number to be called."}
{"text":"Have been coming here for years and have never been disappointed!  They sell quality Korean food for a fraction of the prices at Korean restaurants. I always order their kimbap and japchae, SO. GOOD. Food is always consistent and super yum!  The ladies that work there are super friendly and it's always nice to chat with them!    Overall one of my go-to places for whenever I'm craving some Korean food!"}
{"text":"Tasty, inexpensive, no-frills food in a pretty laid back food court. Will definitely be back. Big servings too! They only take cash though!"}
{"text":"This place is located inside a mall. I haven't had kimbap in a really long time so when I saw it I knew I had to get it. I was at the counter waiting to give my order and another family came right up to the counter and ordered the same thing I was going to order!! Gosh I sure felt like it was a Princess Diaries moment where I was invisible. The lady behind the counter was so nice. All smiles and polite. When I got my order she apologized for the lady who cut me and gave me a free app. Awww so sweet!  The kimbap doesn't taste the same as back home but it did the job. The app was bean sprouts with glass noodles. The meal comes with miso soup so I made myself a noodle soup.   Will definitely come here again because the lady was so nice and while waiting someone ordered the number 5 on the menu and looked so mouthwatering. Going to try that next time."}
{"text":"We had a craving for Korean Seafood pancakes so we tried out this place inside First Markham Place. This was a pleasant surprise as it was a huge order and they provided small dishes of appetizers as well. Great food - it is a bit pricey at about 12-13 for the pancake but given its size and amount of food - this was well worth it. It was enough to split for 2 meals :)"}
{"text":"My go-to place at the FMP food court. Hand's down one of the best bi bap bap in Markham! Staffs are always really nice and they have really good sides as well (The potatoes and Japchae are my fav). Definitely a bang for your buck."}
{"text":"If you looking for some non Chinese food option inside First Market Place's food court, Korean Food Express is one of the choices...   (Why I am looking for non Chinese Food in FMP is another story....)  Samgyetang ($8.95) - Strong aroma for ginseng with thin sliced of ginseng - 1/2 young chicken stuffed with rice and dates... - really comforting for on this rainy/cloudy afternoon  Korean lady is really friendly and nice... will answer all sort of questions about the menu.  I will be here for Naengmyeon ($6.95) next time!!!"}
{"text":"I always come here with my boyfriend whenever we're in the area!! Our favourite Korean food place in Markham. We tried pork bone soup, jap chae (my favourite dish), bulgogi, and the spicy rice cake. True authentic Korean food at a very affordable price. Owner and staff are very friendly and recognize us because we always go back . Also gives free water & tea. Definitely must try!"}
{"text":"I had the Pork Bone soup of course, and it was delicious. I'm no food expert, but it tasted just as good as a restaurant's, except the price was lower. Really good. I would go back, obviously."}
{"text":"Of all the awesome restaurants crowding the FMP area, Korean Food Express is one of my favourites. They offer many staple korean dishes including Pork Bone Soup, Cold Buckwheat Noodles, Spicy Rice Cakes, Bibimbap, Kimbap, Soon Tofu Soup, Kimchi Pork Stew, Bulgogi on rice, Seafood Pancake, etc, etc. Each dish comes with three side dishes on a small plate: 2 types of kimchi, and japchae (glass noodles). Unlimited genmaicha brown rice green tea is also served upon request.  The Kimbap portions are great. It's the size of two giant sushi rolls and is filled with lots of vegetables. I seriously can't imagine how one person can finish the Kimbap... especially since it's the cheapest item on the menu (~$6). It is however, a little bland (as most kimbap are) compared to the other dishes, so if you are going for a lighter option, go with this.  The Pork bone soup? Didn't live up to the perfection I imagined it to be based on prior reviews. Nonetheless, it does deliver for its price. Super flavourful and three large chunks of pork. Delicious.  Their bibimbap is pretty good too. It's a lot cheaper than most stores, which I appreciate. They give you a decent amount of toppings (includes sunny side up egg and bulgogi). The bulgogi was kind of dry though, so I would suggest asking for extra veggies in place of bulgogi if you don't mind meatless food.  The Zhajamyeon wasn't stellar. Maybe it's because I've had the instant noodle version of it so many times. The texture of the noodles just doesn't compare to the quality of the rice cakes and rice dishes they offer.  Side dishes - good (love their kimchi). The tea - traditional and great. A good bang for your buck indeed."}
{"text":"The portions are great and the food is always delicious!! One of my favourites in the FMP food court and always my go-to for some quick and delicious Korean food! I always get the kimbap! So yummy!! And the lady behind the counter is so sweet and wonderful to chat with!   Also got #11, which is the beef bulgogi combo! Portions were also really good and the bulgogi was so good!! Also really enjoyed the japchae. Overall, really amazing food and service! No complaints at all. :)  - @eatwithtoronto on IG"}
{"text":"Really amazing food from this small food stall at first markham place! Menu offered typical korean dishes such as bibimbap, bulgogi, soondubu etc. I ordered the seafood soondubu soup which including tax came up to $10. It came with a small cup of barley tea and a plate of side dishes including kimchi, bean sprouts, and fish tofu. The soondubu was very flavourful and did not taste watered down  at all and there is a generous amount of tofu and seafood pieces in the soup. Be careful though because i underestimated when the lady (who was also very friendly) asked me if spicy was ok and I said yes...it turned out to be quite alot spicier than I expected/am used to from other restaurants. So if can't handle spice that well, make sure to ask for less spicy when you order. Overall, the meal was really tasty and i will definitely come back here to try other things on the menu!"}
{"text":"Pissed that the owner hired some people who neither understand what the menu items are in Korean or English. Food quality is slightly worse.  This mall is reeking of chinese herbs, half the stores are closed at 7pm, quickly becoming Scarborough 2.0, what a shame this food is stuck in here.  SMFH"}
{"text":"Korean Food Express is a small family run Korean Fast Food in the First Markham Place plaza. It has been open here for as long as I can remember and the food made here is quality and is run by 100% Korean mom and pop. They are generally cheaper as they are in the food court but dont mistake that for a lack of quality. These guys have an excellent Gam Ja Tang (next to Owl of course), Kalbi Tang and their Bi Bim Bap is my favorite here.   Even though they are in the food court they are not shy to provide full bowls for soup based items all you have to do is return the bowl when complete. The pork bone unlike some places in the food court aren't just bone there is plenty of meat. If you want to shy away from the bone and want a more clear broth I would highly recommend the Kalbi Tang all meat no spice. The food comes with a complementary drink and side dish as well all for under $10 tax in. They have a generally small menu and the food is made fresh on the spot no pre-made or preserved food here.   If you have never given this place a second look you dont know what you are missing they do take out as well! You wont be disappointed."}
