{"text":"Usually when you think of a bar you think good beer and not as good food.  That is because you do not go to a bar for food you go for the beer, this place you have the best of both worlds. I had the Cyclops burger (fried egg atop a big ground beef patty) I did not even have to put your typical condiments on it.  Onto the more important topic, the beer.  You have a vast variety of beer from all around the world including some local brewery beer.  I am not one that normally will drink beer with a glass but the bartender was adamant about me using one with my beer.  This place was fairly busy and the staff was nice but did not spend a lot of time with us, but everything was correct and I never sat without a beer in front of me.  All in all if I found myself up in the Cleveland area again, which I am sure I will, I would defiantly stop in again"}
{"text":"Came here with 3 friends on a Saturday night. Slight wait for a table.. maybe 15 minutes, the place was busy, but that was expected. They have a very very very extensive drink list, which includes beer, cider, meade and other tasty beverages! A definite go just for the drinks alone! We all ordered food, I had the burger on special - a twist on a Thanksgiving sandwich... that slightly reminded me of Melt's turkey bomb sandwich. Came with sweet potato fries - which were good! While the food might not blow you out of the water, having a good bar with a good selection of choices and decent food is nice. Will be back!"}
{"text":"More catching up on reviews, The beer engine is lakewoods orininal gastro pub. As the brewery style restaurants continue to morph to better food and realize it is ok to serve other breweries masterpieces the beer engine has been doing this for years now. I have a property that is close to this place and I find myself coming here more each time I visit it. 
The beer selection is great and they have sampler selections of just about everything. The food is eclectic bar food centered around the beer. I dont even know if they have wine here and wouldn't even ask because there are so many great beers to discover. 
The blue cheese tomato soup is superior and unique. The bar chips are great with the sour cream dip they give you. 
All the sausages have never disappointed. Any sandwich or burger on the pretzel roll will knock you out. 
Very reasonable prices...beers a re a bit pricey depending on what you order. Service a bit slow..not sure why. Patio is great for people watching."}
{"text":"One of my favorite casual hang out spots. The beer menu is always great and the food is pretty solid (although it is not the most extensive menu). Great place to grab a drink with friends and hang out on the patio for the afternoon."}
{"text":"The Buckeye Beer Engine in Lakewood is one of those places where the beer list is a small novel and the food menu is full of gourmet burgers.  I enjoyed delicious homestyle pierogies with my burger and it came with a delicious breaded pickle. The portion sizes were enough for two meals.

The service was slow but I didn't mind: it was a busy time and it took me long enough to eat my food. Their vast menu is available online if you'd like to check it out before going: I got pictures and a link to the menu on my blog: http://whatsincleveland.blogspot.com/2011/07/buckeye-beer-engine-lakewood.html"}
{"text":"Love this place! Beer and food are amazing and the folks do a lot to bring business to the neighborhood. Big meals and big hearts to match. Check it out."}
{"text":"After checking with a bartender, she directed us to pick any table on the patio that we wanted.  We sat down with no menus, and waited 8 minutes before we were acknowledged.  We finally received our menus and waited another 6 minutes before the server came back to get our orders.  We received two beers, which were both delicious!  After finishing the beers, we waited and waited and waited till the server came to check on us.  At that point we were hungry, but didn't want to wait longer, so we decided to get food elsewhere.  We asked for our check and waited another 9 minutes until the server gave it to us.  
I wish I could say they were busy.  They were not.  Such a shame because the patio and the beers are awesome. (the only reasons this place got 2 stars)"}
{"text":"Go for the beer, not the food. The food is decent but most of it is heavy, although the hummus is really good. The service is slower than molasses and the bar is so loud that it's difficult to have a conversation. The patio is nice but it's right on the street. Parking is tricky but that's Lakewood."}
{"text":"I have been going here since it opened. One of my top five places to spend a night with friends. Service is always very good. I'd rate the selection an \"A\" and the food a \"B\". Sunday brunch is a \"C\" but it's cheap. I wish there were more happy hour specials on food though. 

Only thing I would complain about is the music selection. Terrible music but that seems to be the norm in gastropubs or breweries. No clue why as you would think if your clientele is has good enough taste to be drinking an Orval they would want to hear music that isn't mainstream schlock. Oh well. You can't have everything I suppose.

Beer Engine is a winner for selection alone though."}
{"text":"Staff educated more than most. Selection more than IPA and Belgian wit like most places. What ever happened to a good old brown ale? A good place to eat and drink. A solid mustard game!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years & have loved this place until today. Not sure if the GM is new or maybe has a drug problem. It was seat yourself when a friend of mine came in to get a table for our party of 6. She was early because I had an issue at work & others had traffic. Most of our group was at the table enjoying our beers when the GM came over to tell my friend who got the table that she was sitting there a while by herself with no one else at the table.  Mind you there were several tables available.  She & I had already ordered dinners & once he acted like a complete douche I told the waitress I needed to cancel those we were leaving. GM doucher came over again to argue that we had to pay for our meals etc... We again had to argue our point & the poor waitress came to apologize.  It's a shame always loved the place I'm done patronizing. We have a very large extended craft beer drinking cycling group who this will be shared with. 

I had to edit. I'm so upset about this interaction & dropped it to 1 I'm at a much better venue who is treating us great."}
{"text":"We used to love BBE but our most recent visit will sadly be our last. The server was extremely rude and slow. The food was sub-par. We normally love the potato pancakes but we could tell this time they were very undercooked (soggy). The burger was well done (ordered medium) and their normally delicious chips were soggy. We almost left after waiting for our food for so long, and when we asked our server she told us there was an hour wait for the kitchen (!) and we would have to just deal with it. No apology of any kind. There are too many other good places to go in the area for us to justify going back."}
{"text":"Something's changed. The beer list is still overwhelmingly good and service first rate. But the food isn't what it once was. We ordered sliders and the house chips. The chips were cold and stuck together. I think they had been sitting for a while. The 'sliders' were just a regular burger chopped into 4 pieces and stuck into flimsy dinner rolls.  Not what I remember from previous visits. A real slider burger is distinctive in taste because of it size and shape. The place wasn't crowded, so no one was overwhelmed in the kitchen. A shame. This used to be my 'go to' place in Lakewood."}
{"text":"Best Burgers ever... hands down.... I always get carry out. I have ate in. Burgers always hot and fresh. My favorite is the fried pickle. Order is always right. never a mistake... Cannt wait to eat there... workers are friendly."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a number of times in the past year due to family business bringing me to this neighborhood. Four stars for burgers averaged with two stars for service adds up to three stars. The primary draw of the place for me is that the burgers are some of the best in Lakewood. I've tried the non-burger items, such as breaded sausage bites, beer cheese, and pretzels, a couple of times but once you get away from the burgers the food is not that great in my opinion, and some of it tastes like it came out of a freezer bag. Stick with the burgers (many varieties to choose from and only some of them weird), fries and onion rings and you will be fine.  

The downside is that I've been going to this place a few times a year for about the last 6 years and the number of issues with service here far outpace any other brewpub restaurant I've been to. Servers are reasonably friendly but tend to disappear for many minutes if you're eating in, which coupled with the crowds at certain hours makes me more inclined to order my food for takeout. The place is on the tiny side and there is a wait for a table here on many evenings and weekends, and I stopped bringing family here because we never knew if we were going to be able to get seating within a reasonable time and had some bad experiences in the past.  If you must eat in, or want to drink with your meal, then I recommend sitting at the bar.  Even the takeout process can get weird as sometimes they just do not answer the phone for 45 minutes (last time this happened I drove down there expecting to see a busy restaurant keeping them from the phone, and found exactly one guy eating and three servers just standing around) or do not appear for many minutes to ring up your takeout when you go to pick up. I keep going back anyway because it's a close place to get a good burger and the type of shoestring fries or battered rings I most enjoy (as opposed to the wide soft fries some of the other local burger bars push).

As for the beer, sometimes I enjoy having one of their on-tap selections with my food.  But for bottled beer, I'd rather just buy it at the store to have with my takeout, or go to a different bar with more reliable service."}
{"text":"We're talking about 30 beers on tap and a bottle list that's maybe 5 pages long. If that wasn't cool enough, the burgers are delicious! For all you craft beer lovers: what are you waiting for? Get here now. If you watch sports, they have a number of large TVs so you don't miss anything.

It's really busy Friday/Saturday night but if you don't mind being patient, the hostess does a good job of keeping track of people and getting you seated ASAP. It does get pretty loud in there but it's a friendly crowd. Don't bring a Bud drinker here, however, because they'll feel left out and that's not nice. If the parking lot is full, you're sure to find a spot nearby on Madison."}
{"text":"Great place! We're out of towners driving through. Looked up places in the area on Yelp. We were going to go to the taco place down the street but it looked just crazy obnoxious out front so we kept driving. Found this little gem. One menu they give is is just beer, :) Burgers were perfect, beer refreshing, and cool atmosphere and staff."}
{"text":"They are known for their burgers and their beer selection, and for good reason.  Except for some of the other sandwiches, everything else on the menu pales in comparison.  I especially like the option of being able to sub out the burger for a grilled chicken breast.  I never cared for chicken breast sandwiches until I had one at the Beer Engine.  Whatever they do on that grill is working.

You can order a plain burger, I assume, but why would you? When there are choices like these, you'll never be happy dining at Wendy's again: The West Side (caramelized onions, sour cream, cheddar cheese and a cheddar pierogi); The Fatty Melt (a half-pound burger between two bacon and tomato grilled cheese sandwiches); The Tuscan, one of my favorites (Applewood smoked bacon, rosemary goat cheese, roasted red peppers and caramelized balsamic onions); or The Porky...mmmm (burger comes topped with mustard-BBQ pulled pork and pepper jack).  And that's just getting started.  Monthly specials include a \"Burger of the Month\" (a unique creation every time) and a \"Wildly Improbably Sandwich of the Month.\"  I've had The Caddyshack before and was full for the whole rest of the day.

The burgers come with chips, but you can sub out fries for a small additional cost.  However, I'd say stick with the chips.  They make their own, and they're pretty good at it.

It deserves a big shout out, but I won't go on about the beer...mostly because I always order a Franziskaner.  It comes in a really tall glass, and frankly, it's just a pretty beverage.  One of my favorite wheat beers.  I feel like it goes with anything I order there, too.

The only downfall about the Beer Engine is that some of the time the service is a little slow -- not when they have things to bring you, but in between.  Waiting to get the check takes the longest.  Whether that's because they're always busy, I don't know.  Take-out only takes 15 minutes, though, and it's just as good as eating the food there.  Not as noisy, either.

If you have out-of-towners in town, I'd definitely recommend bringing them to the Beer Engine.  There's no way anyone should miss it."}
{"text":"If you're craving a good juicy burger- THIS IS THE PLACE!

Walked up and saw a lot of people gathered on their full service patio. We walked in to a smiling face at the door. We decided to sit at the bar. We were promptly greeted by a very cheerful bartender who seemed to have good relationships with the regular patrons. Huge selection of beer at reasonable prices including their own brews. Had heard rave reviews about their burgers and was not disappointed! My fiancé got a specialty burger called the \"firecracker.\" It came with pepper jack cheese, bacon, and pepper relish. House made hot sauce came on the side. You get your choice of shoestring French fries or thick cut fries as a side. A little bonus on the plate was a fried pickle spear. YUM! I got the \"Bob'z Big Boy'z Burger,\" which as you may have guessed is an homage to the classic Bob's big boy burger. It came with shredded lettuce and Bob's sauce, 2 slices of American cheese, and dill pickle chips. I was craving cheese fries so I asked to have cheese and bacon added to my thick cut fries. Our bartender was very accommodating and even recommended their house made beer cheese! (It was a $1 up charge and WORTH EVERY PENNY!!!) 

I anticipate we will be back frequently and if we can stay up until 11, we would love to try their late night $5 burger specials!"}
{"text":"The only reason that this is a one star is because the food was decent. That being said, it took over an hour to get our food, and it was not during a lunch/dinner rush. Our waitress was terrible, only checking in on our table when we asked a different server to check our drinks. I know the waitress doesn't control the kitchen, but her service was awful, being rude to the table. If you're willing to sit through awful/rude service for a burger, go here. Otherwise, Lakewood has too many other great places to go."}
{"text":"Great food,although I found a hair in my appetizer and did not receive an apology for it. They remade it and it was good the second time around but I just felt like it wasn't a big deal to the bartender because when I received my bill I was still charged for it.I've worked in the restaurant industry for years and expected at least some kind of compensation for the incident."}
{"text":"They're not kidding when they say this place has the best pub grub in the area. Naturally, as a teenager, the only things I can speak for is the food and service. However, if you're looking for a good bar, it looks like it's got a hell of a selection of drinks, so they'll have something for you.

The food is soooo good. I love getting their burgers and I love their boneless wings especially. You should DEFINITELY get a basket of fries with anything you eat there because they are the best fries in the city. They're shoestring fries that have the best blend of seasonings on this side of the Cuyahoga river. They come in large baskets, so you'll have plenty of flavor to enjoy. The food is absolutely wonderful and the service has always been swift. The atmosphere is pretty great. I always play music on the electronic jukebox (but not really a jukebox...it's that thing that's in every bar these days). The place has really become a regular stop for my family. Speaking of which, the whole family is welcome, and there's plenty for the young ones. It's an ideal place for families with kids of all ages, despite the bar being in sight. We have had nights where there's a wait, but it's very worth it."}
{"text":"I've eaten here in the past and have had great food, especially the meatloaf, but I just ate here recently and the burger I ordered was not good.  I ordered the burger medium, it was fried so much to the point that the edges were hard.  Also, it was advertised as a 1/2 lb burger, it was not a 1/2 lb burger.  Also the food was cold when it was brought out to the table.  The service was great, but the food quality was not where it has been in the past."}
{"text":"Not my favorite Lakewood establishment. I've eaten here a few times and each time I was not very satisfied with the service. This is an awesome place to do drink beer (as it's name would indicate). However, if you're thinking about going there NOT to drink, expect a different level of service which is why I gave a 2 star rating. As a former service industry worker I understand the temptation as a waiter or waitress to expect a lower tip of alcohol isn't involved, however, it is still a restaurant. Patio is cool! Serves fried pickles which is fun. Vegan and GFree options available but limited. I hear their burgers are delicious."}
{"text":"Never again.  4 of us Monday night.  Once again, they did not have my 1st choice nor my 2nd choice beer.  Seems to be a recurring problem.  At least mark them off the list if you run out.
Waitress fouled up the order for our companions, bringing only one entree for both of them.  She said she thought they were sharing.  That might have flown had she brought an extra plate.  Nice try.
Nobody came to ask us how the food was.  Had anyone bothered, I would have said my medium burger was dry & overcooked.  My dog ate it later.  And potato chips as a side.  How inspiring!
Worst of all was the social boors who were seated after us.  Obnoxious, rude, horribly loud.  Too obtuse to take hints or too piggish too care.  We even moved our seating, but there was no escape.
No more.  We will leave the fat, boorish, socially inept to lap up remainder beer and less-than-mediocre food.  Too many other places to try."}
{"text":"This place is properly named.  Beer is number - one ... The variety is constantly amazing and changing.  The staff is knowledgable about it too.
 But you also get friendly service and an atmosphere worthy of bringing friends and or your kids.  This is not a snooty place though- it suits Lakewood well and is definitely worth a visit.
The food is above average.  the menu is big enough to satisfy most and I've never had anything I would return."}
{"text":"Best burgers in Lakewood! Not that pricey and insane beer list."}
{"text":"Everything about the BBE screams eclectic and delicious. Went there back to back days with 2 different groups and couldn't have had a better meal. Service was a tad slow but a very busy place so to be expected. Definitely caters to the younger, hipster crowd but still great family fare and atmosphere. Coming back!"}
{"text":"Went there last week and ate the best burger in a while. Asked for it medium rare and it came out just that. They have super unique burgers (mine has grilled peaches) that you dont want settle for just your plain cheeseburger. I definitely will be back"}
{"text":"Noooooo! My favorite fried bologna sandwich wasn't available the last time I was there. Their vendor changed their bologna. I hope they are able to resolve this quickly.

All of their specialty burgers are also quite good. Their smoked turkey reuben is also very good.

Their draft beer menu is huge and I like trying a different beer every time that I go.

Buckeye Beer Engine is definitely one of my favorite places."}
{"text":"Very good food, and awesome brew! Even though I don't like them, they have a bloody Mary bar on Sunday for brunch, and that's pretty neat. I like the patio in the spring and summer, and the staff is very friendly. The burger of the month is always awesome. Overall you should definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"The Beer Engine is a weekly stop for me and a friend.  We have \"Sunday Funday\" here and we get together after she gets off work and have a bite to eat and enjoy a beer or two.

The atmosphere is awesome and chill, no fighting crowds or having to shout to have a conversation.  It is clean and the perfect size for a bite to eat and a sweet beer.

I have tried to many things it would be impossible to list them all.  I am a vegetarian and usually get either the black bean burger or the black bean burger sliders (they are wonderful, sometimes veggie food is cooked horribly but not here).  I've also had their tomato soup with blue cheese crumbles, and I don't even like blue cheese but this was divine.

As for beer they have at least 25 different beers on tap at any given moment along with a 10 page list of bottles imports and all sorts of other crazy things.  Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Went here for my 21st Birthday and was pleasantly surprised.  Let me start by saying that I was BLOWN AWAY by the 28 beers on tap and then the 5 pages...yes, I said 5 pages, of bottles that they had.  To top off the amazing selection of beer, the food was also excellent.  We started with boneless wings and Perogi which were both perfectly prepared.  For my entree I had Fish & Chips which was also just perfect.  The shoestring fries were perfectly seasoned and crispy and the fish had the flaky, rich beer battered breading on it which I absolutely love.    Overall, Awesome service, great environment and even better food and beer.  Can't go wrong at the Buckeye Beer Engine!"}
{"text":"In the 1870s, Cleveland was home to over 30 breweries. That rich history paved the way for some of the state's best beer bars. In Lakewood, longtime brewer Garin Wright runs the popular Buckeye Beer Engine, a tavern that showcases selections from the best breweries around, including Wright's own Buckeye Brewing. The cozy bar is a beer-lover's paradise, boasting 25 hard-to-find gems on tap, including cask-conditioned ales and unique seasonals. The tap handles stay busy, but so too do the cooler doors, filled as they are with 200 top-flight bottle pours. Navigating the brews is made easy thanks to a descriptive beer menu that lists style, bitterness, alcohol, price and glassware."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go if you are a fan of beer.  They have a huge tap selection and an even bigger bottled beer selection.  The food is great here as well.  Friday and Saturday evenings it can get pretty crowded, so I always try to head there a little early so I can beat the crowd.  They have indoor seating and also a pretty nice size patio for the summer months."}
{"text":"I went here for a late lunch/early dinner with two friends visiting from out of town. Upon entering, we waited to be seated. A waitress told us someone would be right with us. Meanwhile, a few employees stood off to the side talking and greeting a family that came in behind us. No one seemed in any hurry to seat us. When someone finally came over, we asked to sit outside. Instead of sitting us at a big, clean, empty table with an umbrella, we were shoved in the corner of the patio at a tiny round table with dirty glasses on it and no chairs. As a bonus, it was literally right next to a table with a loud drunk girl who was sharing her wise words with the entire patio. A few minutes after we sat down, a couple was seated at the large empty table referred to earlier. Oh, cool guys. As if all this wasn't bad enough, my turkey Reuben was soggy. It also took our waitress forever to bring the bill. We were done with our food and drinks and sat around twiddling our thumbs waiting for it. Although there is a good selection of beer and the food is alright, the poor service will probably keep me from returning to eat any time soon."}
{"text":"Best place for a beer snab. They even have their own brews! Try the hot dog pretzels!"}
{"text":"Amazing beer menu and beer to go on the sly. Don't forget the FOOD! They have amazing appetizers and burgers rule."}
{"text":"Located on Madison Ave in Lakewood, Ohio, The Beer Engine is one of over a dozen bars in Lakewood. Unlike the \"hole in the wall\" bars the infest Lakewood, BBE is one you should be putting on your must visit list.

First time I went was the night when Lebron announced his Benedict Arnold on Cleveland, so it was pretty busy, and I am unsure of the traffic on a typical weekday night. But I would imagine it gets pretty tight in the building considering the bar is tiny and there is a hand full of table to sit at.

Other then the extra small size of the building, not much is wrong with BBE. The beer list is great and the bartenders know which beer is good and which was to stay away from. BBE also houses their own beer from the Buckeye Brewing Company. You can request samples of the beers, which is great because  you never know what a house brew will taste like. The food menu is basic and features burgers, sandwiches, and etc. I didn't order a meal but did order the mozzarella cheese sticks, and they were great, warm, melted cheese and the batter was delicious.

The one thing that makes BBE so great is the quality of people you meet while relaxing over a pint of beer that you probably never heard of. Grab some friends and take some time to check of the Beer Engine."}
{"text":"I have been going to the Beer Engine since they opened up.  The beer selection is the best on the west side, hands down - they might just have the best selection in Ohio - I have yet to see its match.    Granted there are some good breweries on the west side, but none have such a diverse sampling of craft and interesting import beers.  Where else can you get a Japanese beer that had been aged in Saki barrels?  Also, the staff really know there stuff when it comes to the beers on tap.  If Jason is behind the bar, follow his suggestions.  He will listen to what you are looking for in a beer and give you some great suggestions.

The food here is good - over time I have eaten about everything, but after several years I am not as gun ho about it as I once was.  The burgers are very decent, and the Fatty Melt is exactly as it sounds - a burger sandwiched between two grilled tomato, bacon and cheese sandwiches.  Most of the entrees are good, but I am not really a big fan of there chicken papakash.  If you can, you have to check out their 4/20 IPA event - make sure to take a cab if you are an IPA fan...."}
{"text":"My wife and I finally gave this place a shot on a Friday evening. We were seated right away for it being 6pm.  The staff was friendly and efficient, with the only problem being it was difficult for them to hear us order because it was loud inside. I guess that's to be expected due to the size of the place.  The aged red ale was outstanding with great cherry flavor.  The Petraus(sp) lager was good too. I had the mammoth melt and my wife had the west side burger. They were both outstanding and perfectly cooked and juicy.  We split an appetizer of onion rings and these were phenomenal.  They were large in portion and size, and perfectly breaded and fried.  The homemade chips with the burgers were very good. The only negative I have to say it's about the fried pickle. There is only one place we've been to that has done this right. Unfortunately Buckeye did not.  The breading came off of the pickle, and the pickle itself was mushy and warm. This was the only negative and it certainly won't prevent us from returning. We will be back very soon because we want to make our way through the menu...both food and beer menus."}
{"text":"craft beer lovers rejoice. this is your place. great draft offerrings. amazing bottles list.  neighborhood atmosphere yet serious about the craft.  not just the usual tired encyclopedaic run down. constantly new brews will surprise even most well travelled beer fans. everything from an occaisional norweigan spiced barley wines to a rare scottish engine oil. can be pricey at times. but you get what you pay for. kitchen menu is varied and no less satisfying."}
{"text":"The absolute best! Relaxing atmosphere, friendly servers/ bartenders. AWESOME brunch on the weekends.  The food overall is amazing--I've never tried anything that I don't like. Probably my favorite spot in Lakewood!"}
{"text":"Got take out for the family, (to recover from the earlier Gorilla incident) and am so glad I did.  Got the poutine which is rich and spicy, the hummus which is fresh and the texture is perfect, pierogies which are not like rocks but lighter, filled with potatoes and smothered in onions, and potato pancakes (also, quite tasty).
When I picked it up, I was met with pleasant staff who greeted me and my food was ready, and expertly packaged.
Had I more time, there were plenty of beers I would have liked to try but I had a purpose...feed the family...sigh.
All in all, I recommend this place - I am always happy with the service, food, and beer!"}
{"text":"This place has the best burgers. Everything is alway delicious and they have a good beer list. Best place to get a burger hands down. I recommend this place to anyone who loves burgers as I do."}
{"text":"This place used to have really good burgers but something happened over the last couple months. They're pretty gross now. But they have beer, so there's that."}
{"text":"We originally went to eat at The Melt, but they had a 3 hour wait for what seemed no apparent reason as they didn't look that busy. We decided to try Buckeye Beer Engine and we are so glad we did. The beer selection was amazing and the Festivus Burger was delicious! We had two waitresses due to the shift change and both ladies were attentive and knew the beer menu well. It was worth the drive from Akron."}
{"text":"Overall this is a nice place to eat. The service was excellent and our server, Chelsea, was extremely sweet and accommodating and the food came out really fast!

The food itself was pretty good, too. 
We had the big Juan burger, which was tasty, and some of the crispiest tater tots around. And the blue cheese coleslaw is to die for. The fried pickles were just OK, and the dipping sauce was not very good. 

A couple of the menu items lacked flavor but were easily cured by a little salt
And pepper. 

Overall a very pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch on an overnight trip to Cleveland.  The service was a little slow for the fact that only two people were handling both the bar and serving tables. There were plenty of places to sit.  Our server still was friendly and gave recommendations for our meals when asked a question.  The beer selection was ok considering they have Beer in their name. I tried one of their specialty craft beers and was disappointed. The food was the best part which is why I am giving 4 stars. All round our party of 5 was satisfied. I tried the Tuscan burger and it just melts in your mouth, best part was the slice of fresh goat cheese. The house made chips were very good. Other items ordered included sliders, pulled pork sandwich, pierogies and a sausage platter. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"This place is tried-and-true. Better than bar food, though it does seem the quality has gone down from a decade ago. Overall, a place we like to frequent. Try the burgers, chicken chorizo burger, and salads. Chicken paprikas is not as good as it was."}
{"text":"Great service and great food. I am a huge fan of their ever changing beer list. They are a bit pricey in the beer region but you won't be able to find beer on tap anywhere else like thiers."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a beer, a burger and some fried pickles this is the spot! I've yet to have a disappointing meal. We usually go late afternoon to avoid waiting for a table during dinner rush."}
{"text":"Of all the craft beer establishments in the greater cleveland area, the beer engine is the one place that you can have:

good food for a great price
great selection on draft for a good price
great selection of bottles to drink or to go
a flat screen tv to watch a game
a short wait for a table
cask beers
informative staff members

all in one place. 

now there are better places for one or another of those categories (la cave du vine has the MOST informative staff i've ever had at any bar, but no food. comparable food at melt, but the wait is insane. better food at tremont tap house but the food is insanely priced so is the beer and the bartends/wait staff aren't that friendly). 

Last week we went and they had KBS in bottles, $9 to drink it there or $7 to go, that's only a $2 markup from retail for the to go price. Really really great value for money. i got the lent perch dinner specail and was stuffed after. there isn't anything i would change about the place. i'm moving down to columbus for a job, and this is the one place i am really going to miss."}
{"text":"After moving down the street from Buckeye a few months ago I've spent more Saturday afternoons drinking on their patio than a graduate student should. Service staff has always been patient with my multiple-hour stays and very attentive. Carly was particularly attentive and friendly on my most recent visit. The food is nothing too special but there are a few highlights in my mind. If you like potato pancakes try Buckeye's! It's cool that you can even order such a thing at a bar! The beer is amazing  too!"}
{"text":"i'm sure i'll be back to this place again due to my now-residency in lakewood and proclivity for craft beers, but it did not blow my mind at all on this maiden voyage.

had festina peche draft (gotta drink it while its in season, can't resist it) and tried the buckeye strawberry tart which was the pinkest beer i've ever had, but still good. wouldn't drink more than one though. the beer selection is awesome, didn't even look at the bottle list because there were plenty of draft options.

the food - meh. i had the '76 burger and it just seemed greasy.. like beyond the level i can tolerate. i don't expect a LOT from bar food, but i expect to not be grossed out. the shoestring fries rocked and i ate all of them, deep fried pickles don't do it for me either, i'm just interested in pickles straight up. 

the service was attentive but apathetic, and that's fine. i don't expect servers to be my bffs. 

bbe, i know i'll give you another go round, but this one left a little to be desired."}
{"text":"One of my favorite breweries on the west side of Cleveland in Lakewood. The food is delicious and they have a variety of beers that they brew themselves. The prices are very reasonable after an appetizer (Buckeye Pubs Chips & Dip, the chipotle ranch dip is a must!) 2-3 Buckeye Brews and a meal, I leave out spending less that $20 bucks every time. The service here is also phenomenal every server/bartender I've ever had has been wonderful, entertaining and is always welcoming the next time I come back!"}
{"text":"Teriffic.   A wide selection of great food."}
{"text":"Got the turkey Reuben .  Wrong bread cold fries.  Told the bartender it was my husbands birthday he ignored me because he was  busy.  Manager could have stepped up as well.  Not happy:("}
{"text":"I've eaten here 3 times for lunch. I luv these burgers ! The Harissa, Wagyu, & Cajun. Everyone seems to like what they get. I get the homemade potato chips with my burger. Last time the chips were greasy & had an off taste to them. We don't drink cause of the work break so I can't comment on the beer selection. It's our favorite lunch time spot. Did I mention the burgers are Delicious !"}
{"text":"Best beer, burgers and fried jalapeño slices.  Love the place soo much.  They have the real deal old fashioned beer taps and a great selection.  The chef is great and the beer master is awesome."}
{"text":"Great service, and amazing food! Definitely will go back! Surprised with the fried pickle with a burger meal, fun and delicious touch! Also mac n cheese bites where huge and a huge hit with my 5year old son."}
{"text":"Beer was good. Food was ok, service was slow. Friendly....but slow. Not sure if it was servers fault..maybe the kitchens. As we only ordered a hot dog...."}
{"text":"I have heard so many great things about the food here, but one thing no one ever tells you about is the service. 

After a hard day at the office I wanted to escape.  I rarely go out to eat to get fed, I go to be entertained.  I want the food to take places I have never been.  I want to be catered to.  Buckeye Beer Engine's food lives up to the hype.  One thing that was left to be desired was prompt service.

It is one thing to go to a busy place on a Friday night and wait to get your food.  It is quite another when you arrive on a Monday night to empty tables on the patio at 8:30 and you leave at nearly 10pm. 

I am not ready to chalk it up to bad service.  Throughout the evening I noticed only two servers on staff.  It seems these servers were also doubling at bar backs, bar tenders, and I wouldn't be surprised if they actually cooked our meal. 

I just think this place had a case of the Mondays."}
{"text":"We went there with family for a Saturday night dinner. It was extremely crowded which was a good sign of a excellent meal to come. We ordered an appetizer of hummus and also an appetizer of boneless wings with a honey Golden glaze. Both were delicious and very hot in temperature. The waitress recommended some seasonal beers which all were very delightful. It took a while to get the hamburgers but it was well worth the wait. They were stacked high with toppings cooked to perfection and hot to the last bite. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This place never fails to please my wife and I . Always top notch food and the service is always friendly and prompt. We will not hesitate to drive out of our way to visit when we are in the Cleveland area . Just love it !!!!!!"}
{"text":"Brew was great. I am kind of a beer nut,  and I love it when I find a place that has variety and unique selections. BBE definitely gets an A for effort. Food was pretty fresh, which is pretty remarkable for bar food! But if you are looking for spectacular, it's not here. Just decent eats. On to the service....well, we have come here three times. My husband and I are in the mid twenty crowd, so I don't think the over thirty discrimination theory applies....BUT be assured fellow citizens you are not mistaken. The servers are bitches!! Terrible service!! Nasty looks!! Why?? Who knows...maybe it's a shitty place to work. I know it's not the clientele, it's too diverse to be oppressing."}
{"text":"The Reluctant Bartender would be a better name. The place was great when it first opened but has been in a steady decline the past few years. The food quality/consistency is atrocious. Wait staff is generally apathetic and inattentive. It can be relatively easy to get a first beer but nearly impossible to get a second. I've actually challenged friends with this task and they all agree. It's like they have a \"no eye contact' rule. The entire place is riding on the reputation they made in the first three years. Oh and be careful, they'll deep fry your purse if you leave it laying around."}
{"text":"I had been here several times, but not for at least a few years.  Came back for lunch with my husband last week and was pleasantly surprised.  This place has things that we both can love.  He adores the burgers.  I liked the grilled chicken spinach salad, which is definitely on a higher level than most bar food 'healthy' options.  The service was great.  Our server even brought me out a whole tray full of samples to help me choose my drink."}
{"text":"Great local place for burgers and beers. It had been awhile since I had visited Buckeye Beer Engine, and my boyfriend and I decided to go do some patio drinking. When we got there, there was a wait for the patio, so we sat at the bar. I was very impressed with the bartender, Ryan, who asked us our names and continued to address us by them the rest of the time we were there. I can't say I've ever run into a bartender who did that, esp when he was so busy. We were just about to order at the bar when the hostess came up and said we could move outside if we wanted. It was super quick, so we happily moved outside to enjoy the fresh air (and we left Ryan a tip). We ended up just splitting a burger since we had been to a fundraiser with appetizers earlier in the day. It was very good -- perfectly cooked, and you can't go wrong with the tator tots there."}
{"text":"Awesome bar in Lakewood. From the outside you'd almost think it was a little hole in the wall, but the interior is clean, nice, and well decorated. I highly recommend their wake n bake tots and fried pickles. Our bartender did a fabulous job on our Bloody Mary's. A huge plus...they serve Columbus Bodhi IPA (the best tasting beer). Need to go to their trivia night on Tuesdays still"}
{"text":"Excellent beer choices, including their own.  Best burgers in town.  Service has always been fine, even during its busiest times.  The chips that accompany the burgers taste like they are homemade.  Do yourself a favor and ask for some cucumber wasabi dipping sauce for the chips.  It's a small extra charge, but well worth it.  Tasty!   

While I find it difficult not to get a burger here, I have pulled myself away to have some other menu items.   The meatloaf dinner is really good, and this is one of the few places I know of where you can order a nice and thick fried bologna sandwich.   The onion rings are also top notch.

Love this place."}
{"text":"After watching a particularly revolting episode of Man vs. Food, I was in the mood for a cheesesteak. When we went to the Beer Engine last night, I tried theirs, which had roasted red peppers, onions, and provolone cheese. It was fantastic! Very surprised. The bread was soft but not soggy. There was a LOT of flavor, and the meat was extremely tender.

Although I was really craving cheez-whiz on my sandwich, the provolone gave me the opportunity NOT to feel nauseated afterwards. Thanks, Beer Engine!"}
{"text":"My dad told me about this place almost two months ago. All he had to say was bloody mary bar at brunch for $7 and I was sold! 

We got there around 11:30 on Sunday...the first warm day and 80 degrees at that. They were in the process of cleaning the patio and already had several tables seated. By the time we left, it was full. We chose to eat inside...I don't know why when I think back on it. There were plenty of open tables and spaces at the bar. 

The prices of the food, the portions served and the quality of the food is insane. For three meals, two beers and bloody mary's $40. I know some may be thinking that a really good breakfast can be had for under $5 easy, but I really feel like this was no ordinary breakfast. I had the Tuscan omelet which was packed from end to end with filling. My dad had the greek omelet and it too was generously filled with the ingredients. The potatoes which I don't eat looked amazing...red skins with green peppers and onions. The bread was unreal. Two slices equal a half a loaf anywhere else. The marble rye was so soft, with just the right amount of butter it melted in my mouth. I also checked out the 420 menu while I was in the bathroom and I will be back next week to sample. 

Reasons why I gave 4 stars? Service was slow. The bartender was our waitress and she seemed pretty busy. I asked for a spoon and after trying to get her attention for ten minutes when I realized she forgot, I finally got one. Also, as I mentioned I don't eat potatoes so I asked if I could substitute fruit or even tomato slices. I even said I would pay more if necessary, but was told no. This I really didn't understand when fruit is listed in other areas of the menu so they clearly have some."}
{"text":"We came to Buckeye from out of town and reading the great reviews were very hopeful! We arrived about 7 on a Friday night with a 40 minute wait (very reasonable). We went to the bar to get a drink while we waited and were greeted with very unfriendly service. It took us over 15 minutes to even get a glance from a bartender, despite the bar only being mildly busy. We waited an appropriate time for our table and were greeted with friendly service when we got there (which is the only reason I gave 2 stars). We ordered bar drinks and waters...the bars drinks came quickly. We had to request waters two additional times, and one member of our party is pregnant and ONLY wanted water which took over 15 minutes to arrive. The appetizers were good, not great, but good. Our party's food came out in a reasonable time, however my food was never delivered. After a few minutes delay, the server came out and acknowledged her mistake in not forgetting to order  my food and said it would be out shortly. 10 minutes later, my party was finished eating so I politely requested to cancel my order so we could go home. I think this place has great potential, but our group was sadly disappointed with what was reviewed to be a 'Cleveland staple' for pub food."}
{"text":"Great beer choices, great food! Pierogies and the Tuscan burger made for an awesome meal for my fiancé and I. One of our new favorite places."}
{"text":"Good service, good food, great selection of beers. 

Came in on a Saturday afternoon at 4pm. Couldn't get into Bario next door, and if I had, I would have been the oldest in the joint x 2. 

Had a couple of beers including my favorite, Lagunitas IPA, and something made in a monestary called Orval. They were donating 50 cents of every beer sold to a help the kids charity, but I'm not sure if they'll get the half dollar, as they didn't charge me for the beer. 

Having dinner at another joint in a bit, so I ordered the fried pickles to get me over the hump. The breading was outstanding and the house made wasabi dip was good, but would have been great with a bit more wasabi. 

The place looks very nondescript from the outside, like an old Denny's, and I almost didn't come in, but I'm glad I did."}
{"text":"I always walked by this place but never went inside. It was kind of cold inside but the atmosphere is really nice. There's no host during the day though so seating is a little confusing. I sat at the bar since it was easier. The bartenders were extremely nice and efficient. Both took my orders and made sure I was being attended to. I ordered the bumbleberry which is one of my favorite beers.  They have an extensive beer list that's really impressive. I ordered the breaded Mac and cheese bites which is served with a side of ranch. I took one bite and it wasn't really warm inside but it was okay. It just tastes like mozzarella sticks which I love but they weren't really warm although I did get distracted by my phone for a minute or two afterward which didn't help the coldness but they're still delicious! So no serious complaints and I'd definitely come again especially for the beer & lovely bartenders."}
{"text":"Never really got to eat here because we had a party of nine.  They told us 30 min wait when there were plenty of open tables.  We asked to have our party split 5 & 4 at two different tables.  The tables were only separated by a door in between.  First they said we couldn't do 5 at a table & then we couldn't split our party because that would be in two different servers sections.  Really?   They couldn't just swap tables?  They said that was too confusing & not in their \"policy \".  Ridiculous.  We left & had a great meal at Angelo's."}
{"text":"My OH friends always seem to take me to the most interesting places for food & atmosphere. It has TONS of beer options, so much so that there are 4 pages worth front & back. Foodwise I went w/ their signature sandwich called the 'Fatty Melt'. It comes w/ 2 grilled chesse sandwiches w/ a buger in the middle of it. The burger patty itself was a bit bland, not much flavor. Next time if I get it I'll get it w/ a fried egg on top for flavor. For an extra 50 cents I got the shoe strings fries which is the business. The grilled cheese sandwiches were solid w/ bacon in them. The melt only comes w/ a tomato, but ask for anything else for more flavor. The plate is served w/ a fried pickle. 
The atmosphere is a mixture of sports, divey, & randomness. The service is good & the food is top notch compared to most bar food I've eaten at. Stop in if you're in the neighborhood for a drink & eats."}
{"text":"Service was great, very attentive. Food was actually really good!!! You wouldn't think from just looking at it that the food would be good but it was. AKA don't judge a bar by the looks of it. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This was my 2nd time a Beer Engine and unfortunately had a pretty bad experience.  Each time I've been there the service has been sub-par, but this time was worse.  We didn't receive our food for about 1 hour and 45 mins after sitting down.  We all ordered simple dishes, including mine, which was the portabello mushroom salad.  I could not believe what the salad looked like when it came out.  I could have made a better looking salad at home with what I had left over in my fridge.  

The waitress was nice, but didn't apologize for the wait and blamed it on the chicken taking longer to cook??  Checking back with the table was rare also, and think she wanted to stay away because the food was taking so long. They also screwed up one of the girls orders, but did offer to comp that meal.

I live a few blocks from this place and now have no intentions of going back for the time being."}
{"text":"I can't say anything for the food, so that'll have to wait until I come again and give it a whirl .

The beer list is (obviously) impressive and I was excited to see one of my faves (White Rascal) on a menu other than Melt's. I also tried a new (Matilda or something like that) brew that was fantastic! This really is the perfect place to branch out if you so choose, since there are so many options and the chances of  finding something you like are greatly improved with such a selection. So, that said, I'll move on to what brings their rating down from a potential four to a three.

The atmosphere is a little different from what I expected. I enjoy that generational gaps are really covered here and that the crowd seemed to get along quite well the night I was here. The problem that I found was the noise level. I loved looking at the wide variety of bottles and decor on the wall and found myself lost in my own head quite a few times because I had to quit trying to hear what the person next to me was saying. I'm not sure if it's the building, the music, the voice volumes or all of those combined, but I really couldn't hear a thing when we were here. That makes it all the more difficult on the BF, since he has hearing damage and I find him \"what\"ing things in a normal volume environment.  

Other than that issue, I really like this place. Maybe next time, it'll be calmer and quieter and I can get a better feel on my opinion."}
{"text":"great place in lwood.  if you only drink beer like miller light, etc. you won't find it here.  which is fine with me.  the only non-micro brew you'll find is pabst.  they have a great beer selection that they rotate regularly and the food is good too.  you gotta try the cyclops burger.....it's deeeeelicious!  nice place inside too with a nice patio.  the only question is.........will the basement ever get finished?  oh, and if you try to sneak in beers, make sure it's a beer that they sell.  sneaking in miller light doesn't work, jenny :-)"}
{"text":"Finally tried the Fatty Melt and it was amazing! A half pound burger sandwiched between two grilled cheese sandwiches with bacon and tomatoes. I ate the entire thing and I'm not ashamed. A must try!"}
{"text":"In my mind this place is rock-star status...some of the best pub grub in the city and a hugely extensive beer tap list to boot, what more could you want?

We love their wings and fried pickle appetizers (but we always get the wings!). Burgers are extremely solid, or favorites are the version with the fried egg and also the blue-cheese bacon (truly one of the best burgers in the city).

Excellent selection of local and hand-crafted beers to go along with spicy wings and burgers?  Yes please!"}
{"text":"I love taking people (family/friends, not hostages) to Beer Engine because there is something delicious on the menu for everyone's individual tastes. Everyone is always super happy with their meal and the beer options too. 

The burgers are some of the best in CLE. Super flavorful and juicy and always perfectly cooked to order. Really love the thin cut rosemary fries as well. I was really surprised to like the fried pickle spear that tags along with the burger. I think you have to order the fries (or another side) separately and at an additional cost).

I'm not too knowledgeable about beer but they have a fantastic selection of bottles and drafts. I always find something great to drink. 

I've always had decent service. Usually pretty easy to find a parking spot. Patio for outdoor drinking and/or dining. I will warn that they get really busy during prime dinner hours so you might have to wait for a seat at the bar or a table."}
{"text":"Awesome beer list here of bottles and taps."}
{"text":"First time there and I was impressed. Their beer selection is amazing with what must have been a list with over 100 different selections from all over the world. Best part of that is that their own brews (~15) are always on tap and ready for sampling. Their menu is better than you'd expect for a small, local brewery. Our group tried the hummus, perogis, cyclops burger and a few of the beers. I was so full afterwards that we decided to walk the three blocks to get ice cream instead of moving the car to make some room.
BBE is a great place to bring out-of-town guests to get a true taste of Cleveland brewing."}
{"text":"additonal review
cajun dry rub wings - cannot be beaten anywhere stateside
harissa burger - was the burger of the month - love it !!! this would be my choice everytime
beer selection - incredible
if you havent been here you have to try it, you do not know what you are  missing"}
{"text":"I have lived in Lakewood for about 5 years and I can walk to the beer engine. That being said I recommend a to go order. 

The food is great, one of the better burgers in Lakewood, but the service is just awful. I continue to give this place a chance thinking maybe the staff has changed but no. If you sit at the bar you will see 5-7 employees continue to pass by you but never smile or acknowledge you they seem to be too busy cleaning or stocking supplies to be bothered with saying hello. If you sit down you get better service but when you ask a question about the beers they would recommend it's usually an annoyed response of \"idk I've never tried it\". 

My friends and I like to try different spots around town and make friends with the service staff especially at the places by our home but all of us hate coming here. 

I have eaten most things off the menu at this point because I will call for a to go order. The patio is nice and it's an enjoyable atmosphere but my interactions with the staff just make me never want to come here."}
{"text":"Great food, beer, and atmosphere. This place has always been a go to for me and my friends. Their burgers are bangin' in addition to the rest of the menu. Each month brings a new burger each more creative than the next.  

Another favorite of mine are their wings.  While I'm not the kind of person who picks the hottest thing on the menu I can handle my fair share of heat, but I will caution you the hot wings have a fair amount of heat so I typically steer toward the Mild.  With every visit I believe more and more that there is nothing bad on their menu. 

A recent facelift on the inside brighten up the space but all brought with it some odd changes to the hostess station. With interior updates came their new brunch menu. I recently went with my boyfriend and we had a hard time deciding on what to get with so may great options.  We both settled on the Beer Engine Chicken and Waffles. This dish was a combination of chicken and Waffles and Biscuits and Gravy, my two favorite breakfast food came together to make an out of this world brunch baby. While I'm not a Bloody Mary enthusiast my boyfriend raved about the make your own Bloody Mary Bar. But keep in mind if you want to get your bloody on you will have to visit on a Sunday.

While on occasion the service can be a little lacking the atmosphere and food make this place a great place for a hangout or a great meal."}
{"text":"I can't drink beer, but everyone I know seems to like their beer. I will say that the crowd is very eclectic at BBE. I can believe the service is poor...but I have never seen hot, young, men or women in the bar. Perhaps that is why they are trying to cater to the hott customers when they do come in? Perhaps management is trying to up the sex factor? 

I wanted to warn people that most of the food is cooked or prepared in some manner with beer."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! Vegetarian burger choices are far as the eye can see but this place was designed for meat eaters. Prices are great and beer choice is endless. I can't think of anything negative."}
{"text":"I can here hungry and wanting a drink. I left drunk and full. Our waitress was fantastic and entertaining in her unconventional appeal. Tatted up, shaved portions of her head, and with strange jewelry. She was interesting to look at and a great servicer with very exemplary knowledge of craft beer.

I had like 4 beers all pretty kick ass. We had the bottle caps for an appetizer which is fried jalapenos. They were spot on! Soooo good!

My chicken paprikash was the jam. Lean chicken, soft spaztle, and just enough seasoning. I can't wait to go back to try a burger."}
{"text":"The menu is worded wonderfully. The food sucked.
Beware of the mega wings. You'll get better food at RALLY'S."}
{"text":"I thought the food was overpriced and If you're  not a big lover of craft beer they don't carry domestic brands unless you consider Pabst a choice."}
{"text":"First off, I've been here on many occasions and had nothing but fine experiences.  Today's experience was just baffling.  Got there early on a Sat. evening around 4:30.  They were promoting a Lakewood brisket challenge (6 examples provided, 1 oz. each, $9 - you vote on the favorite).  A hemp salad special and the fries poutine from the specials menu caught our eye.

We asked our waitress about the size of the brisket challenge - she informed us 1 oz. each competitor - 6 of them.  We said we would do 2 orders of them and split the salad (with no onions please) and the fries.  She said 1 sampler of the briskets is probably plenty.  We said we are starved as we didn't eat since 8:00 am.  She even laughed and said sure you could always take home the extras.  She didn't write anything down.

Meanwhile I was selecting six beer samples - no pen or paper on the table so I borrowed a pen from my wife and I wrote our selections down on a napkin.

Salad arrived via another waitress - onions were on it.  I don't mind picking them off if they are in one spot but these were very thin and everywhere.  Within seconds, the brisket was coming out (after we had told the original waitress we would do that after the salad).  We sent the salad back to correct the onion situation and also deferred on the brisket.

Meanwhile we had asked the original waitress and the second waitress for waters - never arrived.

Salad arrived corrected.  We split it.  Then just one order of brisket arrived - we had ordered two.  Oh well, didn't say anything.  Then the fries arrived.  All these items were brought out by two different hostesses.  Then a third waitress seemed to take charge at the end of the meal.  This situation is just bizarre.

Ordered beignets at the end as I was still hungry.

Overall, the food is still impressive and it was fun to compare different briskets.  Waitress #3 brought the voting page for the best brisket as we were nearly done with the briskets.  The beer samples were fun.

We asked waitress #4 for waters before the dessert. Sure she said, ... never arrived.  We asked a fourth time when she delivered the dessert - yes, finally they arrived!

Food was very good, as usual - I'd say 8 out of 10.  Service was a bizarre - 3 out of 10.

Will I return - probably but I won't be rushing to return."}
{"text":"Great bar food, extensive beer menu, and great service.  We loved the Coffee Porter on draft.  And we really loved that you can sample any draft beer.  Boneless wings with Sweet & Sour Plum sauce were great as were the shoestring fries.  I look forward to going back when we are more hungry and getting a burger."}
{"text":"Beer selection is consistently good.  Food is good.  Service is lacking.  I used to frequent this place quite a bit but over a year ago things changed for some reason.  There was a time I believed DRAFT mag when it said this was one of the top 100 beer bars n America.  Now not so much.  If your driving by and want to take a chance they'll have a beer on tap you like I'd recommend if but I would not tell you to drive out of your way to get here."}
{"text":"Great location and atmosphere. My husband and I come here quite frequently when we're looking for good bar food and a relaxed dinner. They have a pretty big menu with a bunch of options and their beer menu is never ending! I normally get a big salad and my husband likes the burgers and we love their tater tots. Depending on what you get your bill can be much higher than you anticipate for a bar atmosphere. Also have a good brunch with nice Bloody Mary bar!"}
{"text":"Great food made from scratch, and also the workers are great."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best beer selecions in Cleveland.  Good food, good atmosphere, GREAT BEER!

Beware of the Dunkle Weiss.  It will kick your ass!  The food was ok.  It's the beer that makes this place SHINE!"}
{"text":"Danielle and I made the trek to BBE tonight for a late(ish) dinner. The pictures on Yelp looked promising but reading the menu online left me a little discouraged (hamburgers and sandwiches, whoopie).
i'm happy to say i was completely wrong. first, i ordered a beer - a Reissdorf Kölsch. it was great - kinda sweet and very refreshing. 
we also ordered and appetizer of boneless wings tossed in a Korean garlic sauce. these weren't frozen, mostly breading style nuggets. these were fresh and handcut/breaded, good sized chunks of chicken and were delicious. 
for dinner Danielle got the Cuban wrap - like a Cuban sandwich - but in a wrap. she thought it was great and I agreed after tasting it. I had the Hippy Burger and fries. my burger was topped w/ bacon, bbq sause and blue cheese slaw. i was concerned about the slaw as i'd never had it before and i usually only eat blue cheese w/ my wings. my concern was unwarranted as the burger was incredibly tasty.
we look forward to going back. each month they have a specialty menu and we can't wait to see what's on it in the coming months.
my only gripe is that the parking here (and all over Lakewood) is very limited. 
see you next month, BBE."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. The burgers were fresh and tasty. Gotta try the beer caps they're awesome. Will return soon"}
{"text":"Great food, fun atmosphere. Always a good choice to take anyone there. Parents, friends, first date. Whatever. Great place!"}
{"text":"I love this place: it's walking distance from my house and the beer selection is great.

They have a rotating menu of beer.  Many small breweries and imports, plenty of IPAs.  You can also take a \"beer flight\" and select as many samples as you like if you are feeling adventurous. Beer Engine makes their own beer and sells some cask beers which I have not yet tried but have heard are excellent.  Do not expect too many \"macro brews\" (Miller Budweiser, etc). In fact, they may only have PBR for those desiring such libations.

Their food menu is good, my brothers loved the hog wings and my girlfriend enjoys the fried pickles.  Have a fair number of flat screen televisions for your viewing pleasure."}
{"text":"Went to Buckeye Beer Engine in Lakewood after going to Progressive Field.   Place is a very nice bar with a pretty good menu of mostly burgers.   I had the 76er burger which was a ground beef burger with cheddar cheese and bacon.   Burger was VERY good, one of the best I had in a while.   Beer menu had a choice of about 30 beers,  the server recommended me a good beer after the one I wanted was out.   Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Went in around 11:00 pm Friday July 4th, 2014.   The place was dead but there were more workers than customers so having to give this review makes it even sadder.  Sat at the bar, Waited 10 minutes and left.  2 \"bartenders\" and 2 other servers? walked by several times with not even a \"hi, how are you we will be with you in a moment\"  The one male bartender stood behind the bar to the left and seemed like he was hiding while trying to look like he wanted something to do.   I will not return."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. I had the Devil Made Me Do It burger with blue cheese Coke slaw. I loved every bit of it. The Coke slaw was the best I have ever had as well. I will make this a \"must stop\" when I am in town."}
{"text":"Used to really dig this place, but it has kinda gone down hill. The beer list is still solid, but when I drink around here local beer is what I'm after. I know they have house beers on, the question is why more local breweries don't help each other out and tap each other's beer more often. As for the house beer, it can be good... very good. The thing is, it seems the brewer has been mailing it in for a while and that is a shame because he can brew great beer.

The food is ok, but the burgers are always a mess and kinda oily/greasy for my taste. I know what you're thinking, 'who wants a dry burger'?. Not me, but there is a fine line there. Other than that it is typical fare. Do like the fried pickles.

Atmosphere is divey, but fine for me. Like the pic of Michael Jackson on the wall(not that Michael Jackson, the important one)."}
{"text":"Every time I've gone, the staff was friendly and attentive, the beer selection was definitely on the money and the food was delicious!!!  I haven't had a bad meal there yet!!!   Definitely a go to spot of mine when I'm in Lakewood!!!"}
{"text":"It was okay, nothing to brag about...and definitely not making a mad dash back there.  Had a brat on a pretzel bun...meh"}
{"text":"I really enjoy every visit to BBE, maybe because I always get loaded off their amazing list of beers to choose from. Their burgers are really nice too. All in all, a really good spot to watch Indians/Browns games."}
{"text":"i *heart* buckeye beer engine. service can be a bit dicey, unless you're at the bar. the black bean sliders + wasabi mayo are fantastic, and st. bernardus christmas ale, even once, will make you swear allegiance to the beer engine. plus i like to go here when i can't stand the music at tap house for one more minute. oh and it's exactly ONE mile from my house. what could be better?"}
{"text":"Awesome food and a great beer list. It does get busy and there's a wait but that comes with the territory.  The service is always great. The parking can be tricky it's best to get here early before it fills up. I like to park on the street and just walk to all the awesome places in this street."}
{"text":"We love this place. Always lots of unique beers available. Food is very tasty. Burger, beer, patio... Now that's a winner. Sometimes the staff can be hit or miss."}
{"text":"Why pack the 3 kids and the wife in the suv then drive 30 mins to get lunch?  Because this place is awesome.  All 5 of us had great meals."}
{"text":"Great service and good food!  I really enjoy the chopped salad, always fresh and enjoyable!  We order from here a lot for lunch and everyone in our office is always happy with their lunches!"}
{"text":"Burgers, beers, wings. Thy have buckeye brewing beers I had the Christmas girl which I really liked!

Overall the food was good the burger selections were very unique I had one with poutine and pulled pork. Burgers are grass fed beef. Burger was a little dry but still good. 

Was pretty packed on a Saturday around 8 - good crowd though, had quite a few tvs with the games on."}
{"text":"A great place if you are a beer snob.  And if you're not, their knowledgeable staff and huge selection of microbrews (rotating selection of 15-20 draft, many more on the bottle list) might turn you into one.

Lots of good eats and way beyond the level of usual bar food.  They clearly use good quality ingredients, make most things from scratch (applesauce, bean burgers, ketchup, etc.), and have a wide and interesting selection.  There's beermeister favorites like sausage bites and pretzels, everything fried, ethnic specialties related to holidays coming up, and tons more.  And their burgers are some of the best out there, with topping combinations that are very original, like fried eggs & bacon (The Cyclops), BBQ sauce and blue cheese slaw (The Hippie), and goat cheese and roasted pepper (The Tuscan).

Very friendly staff and quick service and a nice atmosphere (dark wood furniture, microbrew beer kitsch, etc.) and fun for all ages--everyone's here from the college set to elderly locals--makes for one of my consistent favorite spots around town.

A caveat: not the cheapest place to drink/eat.  But worth it if you have more than $20 on you for the night."}
{"text":"Looks like nothing from the outside but once entering, I felt like I could be back in Oregon.  Great beer, decent food and friendly service.  My favorite brewery in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Went to Buckeye beer Engine for dinner last night- Had the Bob's Big Boy Burger. It wasn't that good. The toppings of cole slaw on the it  overwhelmed the the burger. The sweet potato fries were way too salty and tasted like they had sugar sprinkled on them. They were limp and way too greasy. Didn't like the food at all, I wouldn't go back. Actually I thought it was at best mediocre and overpriced for a bar."}
{"text":"Great place.  Food was great.  Did the beer flights to try all the Buckeye Beers they had on tap.  I enjoyed the place.  We went during Labor Day Weekend on the Saturday.  Place was packed but service was great and fast.  The girl that was serving us was really nice and talkative.  I forgot what her name was but she did have a tattoo on her shoulder.  So if you ever hit this place, look for her, she was a great and wonderful server."}
{"text":"Burgers, fries, and beer list are excellent. Wish the appetizers weren't from a freezer bag and were as good as the burgers. Love the inventive offerings for burgers and sandwiches. Service is always good and friendly."}
{"text":"I'm not much of a craft beer person but if I ever crave one, I know the knowledgeable staff of BE is more than capable of recommending something that fits my likes...

The burgers the burgers the burgers! Such a great variety for everyone's taste. Delicious high quality meat, generously portioned toppings, and CREATIVE!! I've also enjoyed their hog wings, schnitzel, and love love love their Cuban Wrap for brunch.

Before moving to Lakewood 7 years ago, I visited BE with a friend and we tried the fatty melt. What can I say? It eventually led me to moving here 

The staff is always super friendly and quick. In all my years of eating here I have not one complaint."}
{"text":"The Beer Engine, despite the name, isn't just a bar, it's an eatery with a menu that morphs monthly into a variety of fascinating, tantalizing foodstuffs. When we stopped off, I got a change to try...Elk Ravioli? It was GREAT, and we got the poutine and shared, which was wonderful! The place has got a VAST number of beverages and a fun, light atmosphere. I have also been there for their Sunday Brunch, (breakfast foods to DIE for:) 

They have a small lot next door, and there's street parking too. The prices are decent and overall, we had a really good experience. 

So, if you're looking for something on a weekday or a Sunday to get yourself revved up, check out the Beer Engine to get running!"}
{"text":"SIT AT THE BAR! The table service sucks....bad. Last time I went there was ONE server for all the tables. She was running around like a mad person and totally neglected us. I don't think I have ever really had a decent experience in the table section. The service has always been slow as heck and less than enthusiastic. The bar, however, is a much different story. The bartenders are always on top of it and give great service. The food is a step above regular pub fare. The beer list is obviously great, but a little pricey. 

I will not eat here if there is no room at the bar. I have given table service enough go's to know, it isn't getting better."}
{"text":"Cool little bar with great prices on liquor! I'm from Florida and a Bacardi/diet is $8... here it's like $4! That alone I'm sold on lol but the food we had was tasty too, pirogies and the big boy burger (I think it was called)? Anyway I recommend"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a place to explore specialty craft beers, this is one of the better places in Lakewood. You are provided a lengthy list of beers organized by region/country and their current drafts. All of the choices can be somewhat overwhelming, as well as the \"lingo,\" especially if you aren't a beer connoisseur. However, the servers are usually willing to provide helpful suggestions and a sample if on draft. 

On weekends, you should expect to wait for a table. You can wait at the bar to have a drink, but don't expect a seat there either. Also, the waiting area can get a bit cramped, which can get uncomfortable and there aren't many places to sit. The volume can also get a bit loud once it starts filling up given the smaller dining room size. 

Can't say that I'm too thrilled with the food, but it does the job. I used to love ordering the meatloaf entree, but it was unfortunately taken off the menu. Some of the better choices are the beer-battered cod, pierogis, and the schnitzel. If you are a health nut, there isn't much for you, other than a few salads. Vegetarians may also enjoy the salads too, fried pickle spears or hummus. I guess one can expect an abundance of fried food given that it's a beer joint. 

Given all that, the one thing you can count on is a tasty beer. Give it a shot."}
{"text":"Great Bloody Mary bar, great beer list, and decent menu. Ambiance is a little too sporty for my taste but it's worth a trip if you're bar/restaurant hopping. Not really a destination in my opinion. Super nice staff!"}
{"text":"This place is good for only one thing. The chicken sandwich with goat cheese and red peppers. Other than that, don't go here. The fries are shoestring, I love shoestring but these are just eh. Also, if you aren't a fan of fried pickles let them know."}
{"text":"This is one of the places I like to go to slightly less than frequently since moving to the area. It's a walkable distance, they have good brews, and their burger choice is awesome!

As far as the beer goes, it's got a pretty good amount of drafts available. The in-house brews are also on draft. The prices are par with most other bars in the area. They even serve the drafts in the proper glass for each one, so that's always nice to see (it will make the beer snobs happy).

Food-wise, I've only eaten here once, but the burger I got was excellent, and there were no complaints from my companion on her burger either. I got the bleu cheese & ranch burger with bacon. The flavor of it was incredible, but think the bun could have improved on. I'll have to try more of their food in future visits as I hear it's all good.

I would say this is pretty good place to eat and get some beer, I'll definitely be making more trips in the future!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat!! But a warning, do not park across Arthur in the Dollar bank/dentist parking lot. We live on Arthur and the tow trucks park in front of our house in the street, watching and waiting to see people parking after hours in the lot and walking across the street to the restaurant. They tow several cars, especially on the weekends."}
{"text":"If you love microbrews, you will absolutely love the Beer Engine. Located on one of the main streets in Lakewood, this is a beer lovers paradise. If memory serves me correctly, there is a 5 page listing of beers, bottles and taps. If you are looking for a Bud Light, this is not the place for you. Also has a great menu with pub grub selections and satisfying burgers."}
{"text":"Love love love the Buckeye Beer Engine! When you walk in it's small but not cramped. It's got a cozy feeling to it. If it's your first time there and you're not sure what to pick get a burger because they will never disappoint. Their patties are so juicy. I recommend the cyclops burger. I just loved fried egg on a burger and you can dip the buns when the yolk breaks. Their burgers and sandwiches come with their house chips. Their chips are cooked to perfection they have just the right amount of salt and crunch and it isn't oily like potato chips can be. If chips aren't your thing you can always upgrade to fries. The shoestring fries are my favorite. 

I recommend buckeye beer engine if you're looking for a Cleveland gem. They have great prices for the food they serve. Their service is always top notch. They have weekly specials. And if you don't want to eat that's fine too because they are also known for their IPAs."}
{"text":"Great beer selection and good food. The service can be a smudge slow but  I've never had a bad experience"}
{"text":"Great burgers and the best beers in Cle. Been a fan of the brewery since 2000.  Creative burgers and excellent jalapeno chips.  Cask drawn beers and great IPA's make this place top notch"}
{"text":"Yes this is a burger place. But almost every burger can be replaced with a black bean veggie burger or portobello mushroom, making it a great place for vegetarians or vegans.  

I got the special: a burger (black bean substituted) with grilled peaches and BBQ sauce.  It was fantastic. It came with thin crispy chips that tasted super fresh. We also got some delicious beer battered onion rings that were huge.  I also got two small half servings of beer, which our very knowledgeable server knew a lot about.  Everyone on staff was very friendly. The owner even came out to tell me more about their homemade veggie burgers.

Beer lovers and vegetarians will love this place."}
{"text":"I frequent this place often.  The people are friendly and knowledgeable about beers.  The burgers are outstanding!

This is my Graceland!"}
{"text":"We were passing through the Cleveland-area and were in the mood for burgers. A local recommended Buckeye Beer Engine to us. Wow! We were blown away. My wife had the Nov2015 burger-of-month \"ARTI-burger\" and I had the \"Bourbon Bacon Burger\". Both were awesome, as were the sweet potato fries. The fried pickle was also surprisingly good. All paired well with a Troegs Dream Weaver Wheat draft. 5 stars! We came away very satisfied. Note that this place has a dark old bar feel to it and bathrooms were a bit gross. But the great food and drink out-weigh any negative initial impression from the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Burgers are A+ most of the time. Fresh and tasty!! Get the shoe string fries.
Great tap selection.

Wish there was one of these further WEST!"}
{"text":"I need to come here one day when I have a DD because the beer list is very big.This the food is here is really good and the beer is good too.They have a nice selection of beer from small brewries from around the USA.The only problem I have here is that I live 60 miles away and half my friend are drunks.So I cant drink much here because they leave the place drunk from the floor up.I will hit the Beer Engine up again in a few weeks with a DD and money in my pocket for a night of fun."}
{"text":"I honesty don't know why we gave it a 4th chance. Yes, it's the perfect place for 'late night bar food' but the service has ALWAYS been horrible. I don't know if they're trying to save on labor so they schedule literally the bare minimum or if the people that work there literally don't care. We got greeted within 5 minutes. Which isn't horrible. That's where the 'it wasn't horrible' turned into 'an awful experience'. It took about 10 minutes for drinks. Another 10 for a food order. And (we timed it) 24 minutes for artichoke dip and fried macaroni bites. Mind you, only 6 other people at the bar. We didn't get checked on until about 12 minutes after our food was dropped. We asked for 2 waters and a condiment.... 15 minutes later, never received any of it... We left with no water, no condiments requested and a bad taste in our mouths. All in all, we paid $40 for horrible service, slow and barely ok food. We gave more chances than deserving. We will never be back. Ever. And the word will spread. Disappointed."}
{"text":"My girlfriend & I visited this place while in town for a wedding. We selected Buckeye's based on the interesting brunch menu. We were immediately greeted by the hostess & promptly sat. Our server was very sweet and accommodating. They have an amazing bloody mary bar with so many ingredient options. We made ours extra spicy...delish! We ordered the the breakfast platter. Food was amazing & cooked exactly as ordered. Manager even made a table visit to check in. Highly recommend Buckeye's. We will definitely come back next time we're in town!"}
{"text":"Buckeye Beer Engine are wonderful Cleveland Beer Week participants.  

They had a Rogue tap takeover this past Saturday.  The oysters from the State of Washington were flown-in to accompany the Rogue beer selections.  The options were fresh  or fried.  We tried both.  There is something magical about the fresh oysters, so we weren't too sure about tainting them w/ a fryer.  Whoooa! Glad we tried the fried oysters - - off the hook delicious.  The batter was incredibly light, well seasoned (borderline peppery), crisp w/o being greasy and enhanced the oysters.  If you opted for the oysters to be fresh, on the half shell or as a shooter - there was an accompaniment bar.  The accompaniment bar included a delightful shallot - champagne condiment.

The Buckeye Beer Engine  had 18 +/-  of their  taps dedicated to Rogue.  There were many that were new to me, including \"Yellow Snow\".  Thank you BBE for bringing Rogue to your joint!!"}
{"text":"This place had a great beer selection. Which is good since 'beer' is in their name. Some of the beers were pretty expensive though. We had pierogies to start and they were pretty good. Then we each had a burger. The bf's had bacon and egg on it and he said it was just ok. I had the southwestern burger and it was similarly good but not something I would get again or need to come back for. And I'm personally not a big fan of shoestring type fries. And the fried pickle was pretty good but like all spears the breading kinda slides off, which is why the burger chips are a better pickle cut to fry.  Our service was very attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"Hands down... BEST burgers in Ohio! Yum! 

Great staff, fabulous atmosphere, good beer and the food is fabulously comforting, not good for me and delicious!

I also went to a party in their party room, great space, our private bartender was friendly and funny and once again, the food was fabulous!!!!"}
{"text":"As someone who loved this place, I have to say it's been perpetually going down hill for awhile. The service is mediocre at best, and the beer selection doesn't live up to the competitors coming up around them."}
{"text":"A very solid craft beer (and food) spot in Lakewood. My wife and I were visiting home from Chicago and met a couple local friends here for a late lunch in December. In addition to BBE's tasty house brews there was an amazing list of draft, bottled and canned varieties that encompassed the very best of what is distributed in NE Ohio. The waiter/barkeep was super attentive and friendly and suggested the 'World's Best Fried Bologna' sandwich which fit the bill nicely. I've never been so happy with a processed meat sandwich with its generous griddled cut of bologna with grilled onions on a fresh pretzel roll. The presumably house-made stone-ground beer mustard was a standout and went particularly well with both the sandwich and the accompanying house-fried potato chips. Can't wait to make it back to BBE and ride down the beer and food menu a bit more."}
{"text":"really good bar food and great specials on burgers for 5 bucks after 11 !"}
{"text":"The beer selection and the atmosphere deserves 5 stars, but everything else kind of dragged it down. The food service was crazy slow. (20 minutes for chips and dip?) And everyone's food was okay, creative and very Cleveland, but just OK. 

My burger came out well even though I asked for medium and when I asked about my very soggy lower bun, I was told if I wanted a dry lower bun I should go to McDonald's.

So my recommendation is sit at the bar and enjoy their crazy wide beer selection and go somewhere else for dinner. BTW The bartender did a great job recommending beers off of beers we normally drink, try new things!"}
{"text":"absolutely loved it here! I've been on the search for a really good burger and finally found one! The menu looked fantastic, it was really hard to choose.
I went with the Tuscan burger-the creamy goat cheese really complimented the smoked bacon and the burger. My husband got the brisket burger which was very good, maybe could've used more seasoning of some sort. The homemade chips were great, I didn't get the fries.i would've loved to try more of the beer selection , which just means I'll have to go back again! :)"}
{"text":"Great burgers! And an awesome beer selection. Bloody marry bar on Sundays is a bonus."}
{"text":"I'll come right out with it: I love the Beer Engine. I love the food, I love the people, I love the service and servers, I love the atmosphere, I love the beer. Unfortunately, each of those loves comes with a caviat that ultimately take it down a peg here and there.

The food, is usually fantastic... unless you get a cook who doesn't much care that day, and just slops whatever they feel like on a bun. Having worked in food for the majority of my years on this rock, I know that sending food back to the kitchen is akin to saying \"No, please give me whatever disease you have today.\" The head chef, an older, bald man with a great goatee (who's name escapes me) is always great, and his food is always the picture on the menu. 

Of my menu favorites: The Andouille Sausage Bites are tremendous when done correctly (The later you're there, the odds are they won't be, often fried to a terribly untasty char with the consistency of a pretzel stick) and the Cyclops burger is a favorite. (when the egg, bacon and cheese are stacked correctly so that when you break the yolk, you don't wear it) Our favorite though is the Chipotle Blue Burger, a slightly spicy burger with bacon and blue cheese, sure to spike your cholesterol from the mere mention of the delectable treat. As an extra bonus, you can replace the beef on any burger with a black bean patty, a chicken breast or a portobello mushroom (which is never done right and has rosemary like crazy, most of the time. Beware)

The people are also fantastic... after around 10PM, when all the kiddie hipsters who feel the need to scream their converstaions at the top of their lungs decide it's time to head down to Tremont where the action is leave. When busy, every surface inside the building reflects sounds directly into my ears, making it impossible for me to hear. Yes, I'm also close to the age where I yell at kids to get off my lawn, but, c'mon. Keep it down a bit, yeah? Saturday afternoons are fairly perfect, however. Just loud enough to hear a crowd, quiet enough to hear yourself think.

The service is great... when you get a waitress who cares. There aren't many of them left who simply wander around aimlessly, while the poor, poor beer you want next calls out to you. There are a few, and they're never the beneficiary of an outstanding tip that they could have waiting for them. I'm not asking to be the focal point of your service, but I should at least be at your periphery every once in a while. That said, when you get a good waitress (and waiter) you're in like Flynn. I won't embarass by mentioning names, but, they know who they are, and we show them our utmost appreciation for their time.

And I love the beer... as long as it's not a Buckeye Beer. I like them, but, they're consistently mediocre and not very different. There's about seven IPAs that rotate into selection, each one tasting somewhat remarkably similar to the other. Again, to offer a caviat: Their non-IPA offerings are good, and their Strawberry Tart is exemplary. By far one of my favorite beers and if marketed, could be what puts Buckeye on the map with local favorites Fat Head's and Great Lakes.

All this said, and three stars (which would really be 3.5, 3.75 -- I'm not feeling generous today, though) aside, this is my local. This is my bar. It's the place I take friends from out of town, it's where I take people to initiate them into the finer points of beers beyond the Big Three. It's where I eat and laugh.

Unless something else gets in the way."}
{"text":"I lived in Lakewood until I was 18, and my family still lives in town, so I get back a few times a year. For most of my life, the BBE location was a normal-looking restaurant. When I discovered that the Beer Engine had moved into the location, I was pleased... when I saw their beer list I flipped! The Beer Engine is another great example of the rise of the craft beer and brewing scene in Cleveland - a bar that focuses on getting great drafts from all over the country and keeping things interesting. 

The biggest draw to the Beer Engine, of course, is the beer! A great selection of their own beer, rotating drafts from around the country, and a fantastic bottle list, and all at fair prices. They routinely have fairly rare or interesting releases that other bars would never bother getting. The food is really solid and routinely great, and they have a good variety of food for vegetarians. If you want to have a food experience, go for the Fatty Melt - a half-pound patty in between two grilled cheese and bacon sandwiches.

The Beer Engine isn't the most attractive place in the world, but it has nice sturdy wood tables and a nice big wooden bar to sit at. It's kinda rowdy at certain hours but I've been there plenty of times and it's really laid back. The bartenders are really nice and the majority of the servers are younger women who seem to like what they do and usually know their stuff.

The Beer Engine is a great asset to any beer lover in the area. I go there nearly every time I'm back in town. For a beer geek, this place gets 5 stars. For the general public, I'll give it 4."}
{"text":"I love this place!  The beer is always changing with great ones to choose from. Kudos to their beer guy Brendan! I also love their menu. However I specifically came for CBW's oysters as I try to do each year!  I love the atmosphere, outdoor seating and tv's over the bar. I have always had good service as well. The only bad thing is that there is only 1bathroom and lord knows that is tough for women!  Otherwise I always recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Been coming here since it opened. Strong micro beer lineup. Took a few moths off and came back in recently. Lots of great burger options. Menu hasn't changed much, but that's ok. You will find a burger you like for sure. I like the Hippy, it has home made blue cheese coleslaw and Tangy BBQ sauce on their pretzel bun.  I had to try it, but now I'm in love. 

Try the Beer Engine Marzian ale if they have it. Been my favorite from this brewer since his last place. 

Lots of other pub favorites too. Meatloaf. Fish and chips and a Cleveland sausage platter. 

Kind of \"kichy\" decor. The tap handles under all the beer bottles round the room are very cool. Wish I had that collection in my man cave. 

A twenty something crowd with two big tv's always tuned to sports. I don't feel weird as an older businessman in here having a burger and a beer."}
{"text":"Been coming here since they opened. Service has become very slow, to the point that I no longer wish to visit anymore (even though the food and beer is still good)."}
{"text":"The beer selection is awesome.I always feel comfortable asking for samples before I order. There are two parts to the space. You can sit at high tops or the bar and it is loud. You can sit to the side of the bustling bar at a booth or table and be able to talk more. I haven't been disappointed by the many burgers and sandwiches I've tried, but the burgers can be a bit greasy. There was a time when my husband and I went here just about every Friday for a burger and beer!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been here twice since moving to Lakewood. The first time was great. We tried a few different appetizers and were just blown away by the Wake and Bake Tots. Our burgers were also very good w/fresh toppings and cooked as ordered. The service was over the top good. 
The second time we must have hit a completely different cook. The Tots (which we were craving and real reason we came back) were not crispy and only had about half of the toppings as the first time. Our burgers were over cooked this time and sloppily made. The service was again great, but we were bummed about the lack of consistency. 
Also, my wife tried a couple of beers that we have never heard of. Their beer selection rivals any in Lakewood.

Would have rated higher if consistent in product preparation."}
{"text":"Great selection of beers, fun atmosphere, parking lot, fantastic burgers, awesome tater tots, clean and did I mention great selection of beer??"}
{"text":"I was not impressed by this place. Granted I came in on a Sunday I didn't have a beer my experience was just blah. The bar was sticky and the service wasn't that great. I ordered the 76 a pretty basic burger. It was good but it really didn't knock my socks off. It also took 30 minutes to come out which I thinks a little long for a burger joint. Loved the fried pickle though. Great place if you're looking for some bar food and beer just not the craft burger place I though it would be."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a handfull of times now and I'm thoroughly impressed every time! 

my boyfriend and i just moved here back in June and have been trying to find a good regular spot. pretty sure this is it!

The last time I went in was probably my most notable experience. We came in to catch game 5 of the world series, we got there maybe into the 3rd inning and there was a perfect booth available for us! Adam took care of us and did an exceptional job!!! no exaggeration, I will be back to ask for him every time I come in. He hunted down a special beer for me by recommendation. I  loved it. It was exactly what I was looking for. I also had the burger of the month, the Korean street burger. This is the third burger I've ordered here and every time it was cooked to perfection. It's not common to get a perfectly made mid rare burger. The street burger was incredible. The homemade spicy kimchi I could have eaten a bowl of, and as always, I got the sweet potato fries. 

Basically, I cant rave about this place enough. I'll be a regular for life!"}
{"text":"No! No! No! too many beers to choose from. Wait.... that's not a bad thing. Actually there really isn't a bad thing at BBE. Food is generous and comforting. Be sure to treat yourself to a burger if you  have not already. They specialize in a variety of concoctions for any burger eater. I had the pork schnitzel last visit and it was pretty good for a bar."}
{"text":"A great place to chill on the patio and watch the day go by.  Can't go wrong with fried pickles! Vegetarian friendly, burgers are really good as well! Beer selection is HUGE!!"}
{"text":"Wooowweeee that pulled pork sandwich is the size of a cantaloupe! Waitress was lovely and very helpful in choosing from the menu. The peach tea is pretty addicting and also cheap! It was a little crowed so I'd avoid it during game times unless you like a crowded bar for that. But overall great burger and fries joint"}
{"text":"Love this place. Most of the food is great. I've had all their wings and they are easily the best around town. Cajun with a side of your favorite sauce is a good way to order if you like crispy wings. All the burgers are great and they always have two special burgers every month so you can try something new. And obviously the best beer selection around."}
{"text":"4.5 stars. Went to the beer engine for dinner. At first I only wanted to give this place about 3-4 stars because it essentially serves pub food that was a bit expensive, but after thinking about it again this place has many positive attributes. I had the madison burger, which tasted great. It was cooked exactly how I wanted it, was fresh, and it had an interesting assortment of toppings. In fact, I liked how all of the burgers on the menu stood out because of their distinctive toppings, and I would love to go back and try a few others. This place also brews their own beer, which is a big plus, and as a big fan of cider I was happy to see that they carried at least one seasonal variety of this as well. The blue cheese slaw is delicious, and an awesome take on the side that makes me wonder why more places don't serve slaw this way. And finally, the fact that the pickle which comes with every sandwich is deep fried, is unexpected yet deeply welcome. The service is friendly and outdoor seating is available too."}
{"text":"My friend took me here for burgers one night, and I was surprised how much I enjoyed the food. The burgers are a bit unusual, especially the cheese options. If your into brie, goat, blue, or peeper jack cheese, than you would definitely find these burgers to your liking. I myself am not as found of the more fancier cheeses, and I still really enjoyed them. I wasn't a fan of the potato chips though, they tasted good, but I much prefer fries, (substituting for fries costs more).

As for the drinks, I felt that the Winking Lizard had more different types, and I only found one or two drinks that sounded good to me. They have a black board near the bar listing a lot of drinks, but I could barely read the hot pink scrawl. 

I guess my only complaint is the size of the area, which is rather small. The beer is a decent size, but the tables around were relatively small, and all occupied. There was no area to wait, so you kinda just stand there awkwardly by the door till someone leaves."}
{"text":"Since my last review Buckeye Beer Engine revamped its menu and I have to say they did an exceptional job.

The beers are still great. Still enough on tap that even the snobbiest of beer snobs can find something they like. 

The appetizers are yummy squared. I recommend the beer caps (batter dipped jalapeno slices fried of course with this amazing spicy mayo sauce)

The burgers are what you always wanted in a burger. Large, juicy, covered in whatever toppings you want, and very tasty. The specials are amazing. The cabbage and noodles was a revamping of the classic dish. Red cabbage instead of green on speatzle instead of noodles butter salt pepper. What more can an Eastern European girl want? Beer? Oh wait they have that :).

Don't miss
The 76 (classic bacon cheeseburger)

Hit or miss
The service can be a little slow so order your next beer if you've got less than half

Avoid like the plague
Friday and Saturday nights are kinda crazy so avoid the hassle."}
{"text":"Incredible beer selection and delicious pub food! Buckeye Beer Engine offers small \"tasting\" sizes of beers - which is perfect if you want to sample lots of beers without necessarily getting drunk. I ordered 3 of the smallest size beers (3 different beers) and collectively they were smaller than one normal glass. This is also a nice feature if you're like me and love beer but keep an eye on your carbs when you're drinking.

I ordered the Bottle Caps (battered and fried jalapeño slices) and fried pickles - both were AWESOME and have become some of my favorite bar foods ever. The apricot, pear and apple ciders I sampled complimented my food really well.

My bartender was super friendly both times I was in here with friends. Cozy and intimate bar space that I loved immediately.

TRY BUCKEYE BEER ENGINE FOR SURE!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat in Lakewood. I live in walking distance which makes it even better. It's a tiny little bar open 7 days a week. They have a very dialed brunch menu if you are into Sunday Funday. If you're into Bloody Mary's they have a Blood Mary bar on Sunday as well (helps with that hangover). 
Their burgers are bomb! Never had a bad one. My favorite is the Cyclops burger. It's got a egg on it! What more could you want. Also if you're into pierogis, they are pretty banging here as well. You won't be let down by what you try. 
Fast service and everyone is friendly. 
They have a wide selection of booze on tap. It changes all the time, which is rad because you can discover something new. If you like what you're tasting, you can get a growler to go!
The cherry on top, they have a patio. 
Summer patio hangs. 
In the area and need a place to grab a cold one and a burger, stop here."}
{"text":"Decent meal and beer selection.  Pretty typical bar food and about 30 beers on tap. They always have a special. 
There is not as much space as I would like. But the service is a bit above average."}
{"text":"Great Beer and Grub -  A fun joint to hang out with friends..."}
{"text":"Tbe service was pretty decent when the servers did not have attitudes (but they put on a good face). When tout ask for the \"raw veggies\" make sure to ask if they are fresh. The first bowl was \"raw and molded\". The 2nd one still had older vwggies but edible. The Grilled chicken sandwich was pretty decent."}
{"text":"i've been here a few times and have always been happy with the food and service...until now.  the greeter did not seem enthused or at least respectful, she walked up after a minute or so, had an attitude, and just showed us to a table and then quickly scampered away.  it made me feel like we were bothering her to be seated.

we had two servers, one was very nice and i appreciated her efforts.  the other one was a bit older and exhibited similar attitude as the greeter...somewhat pushy, and i noticed her looking over in a annoyed tone to see if we were done so she could give us the check.

i really didn't feel comfortable at all here, and it's a shame because i enjoyed the food and love the beer variety."}
{"text":"I've been here enough times now that I think I must update my stance on the place. Unfortunately, the luster has worn off. Admittedly, my judgement was clouded by beer lust during my first review, so there's that. But the beer goggles are off now and I can finally see clearly.

Allow me to summarize for those of you that like to get in and get out of your Yelp reviews as quickly as possible:

The Buckeye Beer Engine is a small beer bar that has staked its claim using a time-tested method: crazy large beer selection and greasy pub food. In Cleveland this will pretty much guarantee you at least some asses in your seats. They've got average service and average food. If you're a beer geek this place will be like the lone girl in the bar at last call and you won't even notice all the warts. If you are not a beer geek you probably shouldn't even bother going in this place; it has nothing for you.

For those of you that are still with me, here's some more to chew on:

Sure, there are a couple of things on the menu worth mentioning. The cheddar ale soup is pretty tasty, the Angus beef hot dog on a pretzel bun is just about perfect and I could eat hundreds of those fried jalapeno chips called beer caps. I also like the Cajun grilled chicken spinach salad but hell, it's spinach and a chicken breast, not rocket science. As for the burgers, they're just OK. The few I've ordered have been overcooked and underseasoned. There are definitely better burger options in the area. The applesauce is awful, served warm with chunks of unpeeled apples and the pierogi are doughy, mushy and lackluster. Like I said, the food isn't bad it's just a bit all over the place. It's a gamble, kind of like produce at the supermarket.

As for the service, our last visit showed just how disjointed and phoned-in it could be. The waitresses, all female, all wearing skin-tight wifebeater t-shirts and all sporting forced smiles and tattoos, appear to work in teams covering whatever tables they feel like covering. We were greeted by one girl, seated by another and served by yet another. And there appear to be hundreds of them. But for all their numbers they are a model of inefficiency. A request for water was missed, twice, as was a side order of sweet potato fries. A word of advice, sit at the bar as it will slightly improve your chances of not being ignored and don't sit outside unless you've got hours to spare.

Back in the day, having a huge beer selection was a novelty and you could get away with the aforementioned shoddy service and and allovertheplace menu. The Beer Engine was among the first to pull from this playbook and I have a feeling they've been resting on their laurels for years. Now, even shit bars have dozens of taps and bottled beer lists that would make Tolstoy envious. It's not enough. I've outgrown this and I have a feeling that others are getting tired of it, too. Give me a clean, polished eatery with a concise, well-executed menu and intelligently constructed beer list any day - who the hell needs or even wants 400 bottles?!."}
{"text":"Cavs playoffs and customers had to listen to some DJ play 80s music. The waiter agreed it was ridiculous and gave a recommendation of where to watch the game instead."}
{"text":"Three words: get the hummus. 

You never would guess by looking at this place that they'd have good food. But they do. Even when you're sober. 

Drinks are incredibly reasonably priced and they have an extensive beer list. 

But let's talk about what's really important: the food. 

I've dabbled in a few different items but my favorites are the hummus plate (homemade, fresh and the perfect amount of garlic!). The burgers will literally blow your mind. I ordered the one with the fried egg (only $5 after 11!!!!) and during my first bite I was transported to flavortown. Juicy, thiccccc burger, and a yummy, warm, fried egg on top with a buttery bun... omg it would turn a saint into a sinner. That's how good it was. 

Do not pass this place up! It's a Lakewood gem!"}
{"text":"Great food - different from most pub food. They have a lot of interesting stuff on the menu: spaetzle, schnitzel, lots of things with blue cheese. The biggest issue was trying to decide what to get it - so much sounded really good! One complaint I have is the ladies restroom is just a single stall (so of course there was a line)."}
{"text":"The burger selection is seriously out of this world. I think everyone in our party of 9 ordered burgers. I had the Tuscan Burger with rosemary goat cheese, carmelized onions and red peppers. (I subbed arugula for red peppers.) We also ordered tater tots for the table which were delicious and disappeared almost as soon as they arrived. 

For those into beer, they have a large selection for the connoisseurs out there. 

Our server was fantastic and made sure our party was well taken care of. Edit: Forgot to add that our server divided all the checks without asking which made paying super easy."}
{"text":"This was the first restaurant my husband and I ate at when we moved to Cleveland and to this day it's still a fan favorite! The pickle spears are what you go for and the service, beer, food and atmosphere is what keeps you coming back! To say BBE will be a forever favorite is an understatement!"}
{"text":"This is such a great place, both food and service were excellent. I came here with my boyfriend and sister. We were craving burgers and this place caught my boyfriends eye. They have both inside and outside seating. We chose to sit outside and enjoy the refreshing cool weather (we're from Miami, Florida where it's hot and humid). Their menu has a lot of options for both food and beer. With so many options we had trouble deciding. So we asked our server who helped us stay away from some things and pointed us towards better options. We of course, all got different burgers so we could try each other's food. I like that they also have a good variety of drinks, and I decided on a cider our server recommended, it was good! The burgers-also delicious! I like that you can substitute the chips for skinny, thick, or sweet potato fries. We each chose a different option so I got the opportunity to taste the beer engine chips (they are seasoned and delicious), skinny fries (so good), and the sweet potato fries (also good!) After we saw beignets on the menu we knew exactly what we would have for dessert! (I've had beignets from Cafe Du Monde in New Orleans so it's hard not to compare.) These beignets were stuffed, we chose the chocolate ones. They were sprinkled with sugar, chocolate and raspberry syrup. I didn't particularly like the raspberry syrup and felt the chocolate syrup was too dark, I prefer milk chocolate. I feel the dish would have been better without all the syrup on top and around it but it was still really good. Overall, I'm really happy I stopped by, the food more than satisfied our craving and everyone was really friendly, made us feel comfortable and welcomed."}
{"text":"A nice selection of local beers and specialty beers a wonderful outdoor seating area a nice indoor area clean bathrooms, attentive and knowledgeable staff and good food. I had a handmade grilled tenderloin which was very good and very filling high-quality pork.   My brother enjoyed the cheesesteak sandwich and said it was excellent."}
{"text":"This place is great! The staff know their stuff and the rotating beer list is always good. There are different events and burgers of the month so they try to keep things interesting over there. Every once in a while I end up meeting a big group of people over there and whomever the server ends up being is always patient with us. Big groups that just trickle in can get very annoying, but they never put up an attitude about it.

The food menu has a variety of items, but I really like their burgers. There is a dining room area, a larger bar area, and a nice patio. Good beer selection, good burger selection, great people!"}
{"text":"Me and my wife live 3 streets away and really tired to like this place because of all of our friends gave this place raving reviews! We tried this place 4 times and every time we when we didn't really receive good service and food was average a best with my burger bun being soggy twice(other two times I would order burger). I don't like to give 1 star unless they did something absolutely terrible but I'm just not a fan.(to many other place in lakewood to keep trying here)"}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed with my lunch or dinner when choosing this great restaurant. Just recently I had the most awesome Wiener schnitzel, homemade warm applesauce, sauerkraut and potato pancake- wow! There were no leftovers!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and beer selection. Service is top notch. Very friendly attentive staff. The cyclops might be my favorite burger of all time. A lot of restaurants do the fried egg on a burger thing, but the beer engine knocks it out of the park. The egg is perfectly cooked and the burger is as well. Consistently awesome. You can get good veggies  here and the tots are magnificent. The beer is also good and constantly rotating so it's perfect if you want to try some new beers. They brew their own great brews also. In the words of a prominent judge; \"Top notch. Top notch!\""}
{"text":"Terrible service. After waiting an incredibly long time for my order, I had to flag someone down who wasn't even my server to check the status of my food. Also had to get up from my seat to go to the bar on two occasions to ask for silverware and plates. Ended up taking the food to go because we ran out of time."}
{"text":"Whenever people ask me where a good place to get a burger is in Lakewood, Beer Engine comes to mind. They have some really unique and tasty burgers. Last time I was in, my table tried the bahn mi burger, a burger with goat cheese and arugula, and some Philly cheesesteak.  This is also a great place to have a few drinks, with or without a burger!  Small patio outside, parking lot nearby, prices reasonable."}
{"text":"Been here now twice, very good service, late night menu is limited, but decent selection. You can still get any drink you want, have the simpler burgers to make and a fryer appetizer menu. Over all good experience, late night, I'll return for either menu a good local burger spot with good selection of craft on draft and bottled. They have a huge selection of imports and euro inspired brews. Go check it out, recommended."}
{"text":"i really want to love this place. its 5 mins from my apt, they have a great beer menu, and are open late, BUT I DON'T : (
4 out 5 times the 1st beer i order is always out
the burger tastes like its a frozen sausage patty and way TOO greasy
the fried pickle spear was OK, but the batter falls right off

i don't know if it's because i'm not a hippster, but this place lets me down every time i go and hope it's gonna be better."}
{"text":"So, wings.... Let me just say this, their flavors are PHENOMENAL! I really wish I could buy their sauces but they don't sell them :/ They are a bit pricier than the beginner/amateur wing eater is used to but I would say they are definitely worth it. I've been here multiple times just for the wings and never disappointed. Well that's not true. I'm always disappointed they still won't sell me a bottle of their sauce :( that's what I'm saving that last star for. Once they make that available to me I will grant hem a full five star review. :)"}
{"text":"Talk about a place that has a serious beer selection. I don't even know how people begin to pick a drink here. It's nice that they separate it out by the different types (IPA, Amber, Stout, etc.). I would like my goal in life to try every beer that they offer, but I don't think it'll happen. They have amazing freshly-made chips. I had the chopped salad. It was average and the bowl it came in made it impossible to mix everything around and dress properly, but that's just getting technical.  Nevertheless, good, fresh ingredients. Great parking lot on the side that makes it very accessible. Can't wait to come back and try other things on the menu!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection. Packet full of beer and they make their own beer too! Burgers are awesome, had the burger with pulled pork on it and it was amazing. Great menu items, with array of food. Definitely will be going back."}
{"text":"I'm happy to report that the Beer Engine is becoming one of my favorite spots if only for the beer list and bar chairs with backs. I'm a simple girl, what can I say?

4 oz taster pours allows a person to try just about everything on the frequently-rotating guest list and I am all for that. The staff is easy going and pretty attentive, even when I ask them to bring my small glasses without the metal carrier thing - there is absolutely no way I won't knock that thing over at some point. 

The food: ok to be fair, out of my two times at Beer Engine, the only food I've had has been fried, don't judge. Fried pickles, fried meat, fried onions, fried chicken pieces, fried fried. Tasty, but that's not why I'd go back. I go for the beers, the multiple, delicious beers."}
{"text":"I found myself at Buckeye Beer Engine when there was a 2-hour wait at Melt.  (I mean, Melt is good, but not good enough to wait 2 hours for!)  And, I'm glad I found myself here!  

The list of beers is extensive and impressive.  I wound up enjoying the one I chose; one of the people I was with didn't particularly enjoy hers.  I wish the server would have been able to give us more guidance as far as what all of the different types were, but other than that, she was great.  It also may have been nice to have a, \"If you like xyz popular beer, try xyz beer.\"  I think it would have helped us narrow down our choice.

The food was also good.  Actually, it was better than I expected.  I'm not a huge burger fan (I have to be in the right mood), so I was happy that I could substitute chicken for the burger.  I got the Tuscan and the flavors complemented each other nicely.  The pierogies were OK, nothing to rave about, but solid.  And the fried pickles that came with the burgers were excellent, as were the fries.

I'm surprised to read about the bad service others received; our server was prompt and friendly. But, I've only been here once, so I'm guessing maybe the service is just touch-and-go.

I'm docking one star because I would have liked more guidance on the beers and because one of the people I was with had to send her burger back to be cooked more, but it was fine when we got it back.  Overall, I'd definitely recommend Buckeye Beer Engine!"}
{"text":"This is such a great place!  It has the atmosphere of a neighborhood joint, but the service is exceptionally friendly, and the menu is eclectic and always delicious.  Great beer selection, excellent cocktails, and in my opinion, the best burgers in town.  They can also accommodate vegetarian and gluten free."}
{"text":"Oh man. My boyfriend signed us up for a Jolly Pumpkin Beer tasting that was being held here. We showed up a little early because we didn't know how seating was going to play out and finding a parking spot was tricky. But they have signs posted as soon as you walk in, to inform you that you may need to move you car if you happened to park in the dentist lot on the side. THAT was pretty courteous - and definitely appreciated cause we don't like being towed. 

The event was sold out, and we got really good seats next to all of the action. Everything went really smoothly. We learned about the beers and the brewery. The chef explained his take on the dishes and how they complimented the beers. Food came out super timely. Almost too timely, I felt like I didn't get to take my time and savor my bites. 

The final course wasn't impressive. (Take that worth a grain of salt... I'd rather have a basket of fries for dessert any day.) I also get spoiled because my boyfriend makes really awesome homemade ice-cream (dare I mention, I'm not even an ice-cream eater... because... as I stated, I'd rather have fries.) But this ice-cream... the texture... the flavor... the dark chocolate sauce drizzled on top - it was a lot of blah... (Go read my review on Malley's... That's some GOOD ice-cream.) Yeah, this tasted like it was store bought and I'd have prefered to just enjoy a second portion of the chicken and waffles course instead.

I'm gonna venture to say that this isn't like most of the reviews for Beer Engine, since this is specific to a tasting - just promise me you don't read too much into the dessert thing. This was a tasting and sometimes you don't like the taste of certain things; I wasn't upset. Promise. And as for the beer - that was A LOT of fun. I'm an IPA/Saison kinda girl, and it was nice to have the focus on sour beers since it's a style of beer making that I'm not used to and I wouldn't have sought out otherwise.

I'd TOTALLY go back for another tasting. The price was reasonable and the event was great! Keep these things coming Beer Engine! We. Want. More!"}
{"text":"Great burgers but a tad overpriced. Beer selection is diverse and usually good but some of the more rare beers are incredibly overpriced."}
{"text":"Stopped in Christmas night, one of the only places open, fairly busy
Staff was great, really nice
Had a solid beer menu and a good list of burgers (many w bacon ;)
-Fried pickle spears: good, crispy, no extra flavoring, just pickles covering in tasty crispy fried. 
-Bourbon bacon burger: tasty greasy flavorful burger: cooked as asked, pretty greasy and good in that way 
-My wife had a burger and said the same - greasy and guiltily tasty
-Sweet potato fries: crispy as requested, thin, good
-Dessert: described as fried toaster strudel in chocolate or raspberry: pretty accurate, not super impressive, would've been better w ice cream, but still not worth the calories

Reasonable bar restaurant food and nice place overall"}
{"text":"I have been to Beer Engine lots of times; it's basically a Lakewood staple. So my review isn't based on one single visit but my general knowledge of the establishment. Most of my experiences have been golden, but every place has their off days. Let's break it down, shall we?

As my employer says, here are the areas of opportunity:
This place is always packed on weekend evenings or during sporting events. It can be very difficult to find a seat, especially if you come with a group. You may even have to wait around and stalk another table/seat at the bar before you can claim it. But move fast, because it can get pretty competitive. 

When it's busy like that, the service struggles to keep up. You will get your food & drinks... but you likely won't have a designated bar tender or server. Don't expect eye contact. They are in a hurry, there are lots of hungry and thirsty people to serve! Just be thankful you got what you needed.

I don't think the service is intentionally impersonal, it's just kind of survival mode here. You may have to catch someone's attention to get another beer or place your order. That's just how it is.

Strengths:
Beer Engine is good bar food. The burgers are inventive and yummy. A favorite of mine is the West Side Burger which is topped with a pierogi and sour cream. I mean, come on! That is just sooooo the west side of Cleveland! This would be a great place to bring someone who is visiting Cleveland and wants to really experience the culture. Maybe not the foodie scene, but this food feels distinctly Cleveland to me.
There are lots of fried foods to indulge in, in typical bar fashion. Burgers are served with a deep fried pickle too. Ugh, and they have poutine on their menu! *drool* I had fried macaroni and cheese here for the first time in my life... and that's not something you forget. 

Another reason to go to Beer Engine is their massive beer selection. Lots of craft beers available on tap. I know you can get that lots of places, but that happens to be one of their qualities. 

Beer engine has a private parking lot. FULL STOP. 
That's not something you come by often in this neck of the woods. Especially at a bar. 

And lastly, Beer Engine is just a fun place. Yes, it's dark and sticky and you may have to stare down a lingering table so you can get a seat... but once you do, you will have fun. It's crowded but there are lots of warm community vibes. The food is comforting. There's lots of beer to drink. You feel like family. You feel like you belong. It's all good."}
{"text":"Hands down the best burger I've ever had - I would recommend the West Side burger. Great beer selection, although about half the time they are out of the bottled craft beer which can be expected for a small business serving a speciality product. They have a good patio. The serving staff can be a little bit inattentive/slow but overall a great place with great food."}
{"text":"Very large selection on tap. Friendly quick service. Food was passable. Kind of pricey."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times and stopped by today for lunch with a friend I haven't seen in a year. I ordered one of their gourmet burgers. I believe it was called The Tuscan but I am sure of what was on the burger: herb goat cheese, roasted red peppers & bacon (it does originally come with onions as well, but I passed on these). I chose the shoestring fries for an extra 50 cents. Boy do I love the fried pickles that come with the burgers here! :) 

What's better? The burgers were $2 off since we came during what I believe is Happy Hour (11 am - 7 pm Mon - Thurs) and the draft Buckeye beer was $1 off. Wonderful! I LOVED my delicious sandwich. This is a place I will always visit on my trips to Cleveland! YUM!"}
{"text":"I was feeling all Lenty - I know recovering Catholic guilt!!  I decided to order fish and chips - thinking I would get a couple few pieces of golden fried fish o'day, some fries, a bit of vinegar and my ale.

Ale was great (#28), fish - not so much.

I got what was probably a whole friggin filet.  In one piece. Bully on for portion size.  But.....

Breading and frying a whole half of fish leads to uneven cooking.  The breading was far too dark.

Make the thing better by:
1.  Changing the fry oil AND
2.  Cutting the fish.  You know, with knives.

Just dont run with knives.  You got this Beer Engine...."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite burger place in Cleveland.  Their burgers are just AWESOME.  They have lots of interesting combinations, but I honestly usually just go with a patty melt and it is phenomenal.  The fried pickle that comes with their burgers is always excellent, and their beer list is phenomenal.  I used to frequent this place when I lived in Lakewood, and now that I live on the east side, I will still drive over to Lakewood to have a burger here every now and again.  I'm sure the other food they have is excellent, but I love their burgers so much I haven't bothered to try any of it!  My fiance has sampled several of the more adventurous burgers and loved the one with the fried egg on it, the one with the pierogi on it.  It can be crowded and a bit loud, so if you are looking for a more restaurant-y environment, I'd definitely recommend going during the week."}
{"text":"Nice neighborhood place. Fast courteous service. Hamburger and fries were delicious. Chicken wings were very good but undercooked I am afraid.
I will return here,the burgers are good and it is a friendly place."}
{"text":"I've never had bad food here. This is also usually our go to Sunday brunch spot for an awesome Bloody Mary bar!"}
{"text":"This place is seriously so good.  Their food is great, their beer list is even better. The only thing I don't love about this place is the cleanliness of the bathrooms. I kind of avoid going there as it seems like they don't keep up with the cleaning"}
{"text":"I LOVEEEEEE this place!!!! I have been going here for years and with good reason! The staff here is very friendly and attentive. If you're new to craft beer, they're always willing to help find something you'll like based on what flavor profiles you're into or other beers you've had in the past. The draft list changes consistently and offers a lot of different ways to explore beer. The food is amazing and also very accommodating to vegetarian and gluten free if you ask. The burgers are ALL great, but my favorite is probably the Tuscan with roasted red peppers, bacon, and herbed goat cheese. A great place to bring family and friends and gather people together. Takeout service is also quick, and you can also take beer to go with you if you so desire. (; 420 hopfest is amazing if you're into hops!"}
{"text":"Fantastic burger with mediocre fries. Their sandwiches come with chips as a side but you can switch to fries for an added fee. Perhaps I shouldve gone with the fries. Their ketchup tastes like its mixed with bbq sauce - whether this is true or not or a mistake I think I liked it. Tasty delicious spicy ketchup.

I did not order any alcoholic beverages but instead had plain old water. It was cold and the waitress kept it topped off.

Overall if I wanted a burger and I was in the neighborhood then I might just stop here again. The service was great and the price was right!!"}
{"text":"I'll start this off by saying I'm no beer snob, authority, expert or historian. I do consume mass quantities of it but I can't tel you what hops are good and what barley is bad. This place has a TON of speciality beers and can even be intimidating to a regular domestic drinker like myself. This review is mostly about the amazing food and Bloody Mary bar. Bloody Mary bar BLOWS away most I've tried. A ton more ingredients and options from 12-4pm Saturday and Sunday. The menu is huge but I always recommend trying the monthly special first. They have some monstrous burger where it's a grilled cheese then the meat and another grilled cheese. Bartenders are always friendly and offer suggestions on food and beer. Patio is great as well. Don't miss the keg Christmas tree during the holidays either."}
{"text":"Lets get this out of the way fast.. I don't drink Beer.  so... I'm reviewing the food.  I'm not dumb enough to let the fact that they can't make a mixed drink at a beer place well taint this review. 

The food is pretty amazing.  I tasted a few appetizers, Potato Pancakes that were KILLER and friend Mac and Cheese balls that were standard fried heaven. 

Next I moved on to the Farmhouse burger which was pretty epic!"}
{"text":"This was a boyfriends pick for his early birthday celebration... And let me tell you he knows how to pick them! We went with a group of 12 on a Saturday night around 7... Now I don't know what it is about places in Lakewood, but NONE of them take reservations! That was the only frustrating part of the night. We had to wait a while which led to a fussy boyfriend until we went across the street and got him a beer. We checked in a couple of times and were sat within the wait time the hostess told us when we walked in. They had a great beer selection, but honestly their \"buckeye\" beers were not our favorite. The boyfriend said their Cleveland IPA was undrinkable, but there were many others to choose from. The food made up for the not so great beer. The boyfriend had the special Cuban burger which he really enjoyed and I had the burger with perogies on it. Really good. 

We would for sure come back to this place again for a fun Cleveland experience. We had a great night and the staff was so willing to work with our large group."}
{"text":"I've heard lots of raves about Buckeye Beer Engine and I can see why.  It's definitely an experience.  Their list of bottled beer was like 15 pages long!  If you like to experiment, or just like beer, this obviously is the place for you.  They have a limited amount of drafts but they all seem like a special experience to try.  I really like fruit beers and my favorite was the EPIC Brainless Cherry.  It is aged in a Chardonnay cask with cherry puree.  (OK I'm ready to go back!) 

FOOD
Like everyone has mentioned they have a great menu too.  This place is like MELT for burgers.  They have tons of different combos and unique ingredients.  I wasn't in the mood for a burger but I tried the Adobo Beef Egg Rolls for an app because my friend I was with had them before and said they were amazing.  This time she said they were a bit dry.  They were okay. They had a little spice and they were actually pretty filling (you get 3).  For dinner I had the Turkey Rueben. 3 words - BLUE CHEESE COLESLAW. I'm not a huge fan of blue cheese or coleslaw but this stuff was SO good!  I've never even heard of blue cheese coleslaw before so props to them for being inventive.  I tried my friend's hot dog on a pretzel bun. It was good. Nothing special though.  Their hand cut potato chips or whatever are really good as well!

SERVICE
I read some reviews that the service was nothing to write home about.  It was just fine I thought.  Everyone was very personable and efficient.  Before they got busy, our bartender, a blonde girl was really helpful with suggesting beers to try and picking them out.  They did all seem a bit rushed but anyone that works in the service industry knows how it is!

WAIT
I was surprised at how small it is!  For some reason I had pictured it being a lot bigger but theres just a main bar, which seats probably about 30, with some bar tables around.  There's a mid-size room to the left with bigger tables.  I got there right before five on a Thursday night and it was empty.  When we left right before 8 the bar was full and most of the tables were as well.

I definately want to go back to try a burger and sample some more beers!"}
{"text":"We love coming here. Staff is great super friendly and helpful. Food is delicious. I love the Cubano. And the burgers are spot on. Sunday brunch is great! The Bloody Mary bar is fun and the tots with hot sauce and eggs are a perfect way to ensure an unproductive Sunday!"}
{"text":"A great place for beers and great food. Im not the biggest fan of IPAs or speciality beers but the food is def on point...no doubt about that. My family and I have had their wings, burgers and turkey rueben...all met and exceeded our expectations. Plus the kitchen is open til 230am (limited menu)"}
{"text":"That cyclops burger was greasyyy"}
{"text":"Fuck me silly, this place is some dope titties! 
Me, my main squeeze, and a couple friends were drunk as hell one night and had a hankering for some tasty treats. Lo and behold Buckeye Beer Engine presented itself to us in our time of need. We scarfed down a couple burgers and wings in our drunk stupor, and let me tell you that this place is top notch when it comes to wings. I got some mild boys and scarfed those down at an embarrassingly fast rate. I then forced my hubby to give me a bite of his burger and I nearly climaxed out of the party that was happening inside my mouth. 
They also had a great selection of beer and other libations, but felt it unwise in my already inebriated state to consume more alcohol, so I opted out of ordering a beverage. I shall return though because of my great food experience to consume more food and partake in some adult beverages!"}
{"text":"If the Beer Engine ever closes I think I'm going to need to be pink-slipped.  For real, we're talking 72 hour psychiatric hold in a hospital.  I've been coming here for years now and it never gets old.  The food is delicious, the beer selection is out of this world, prices are reasonable, and it's a great place to sit and relax whether you're at a table with friends or at the bar by yourself.  

The menu is made up of a pretty broad selection, with a leaning towards German food and burgers.  There's the usual pub fare thrown in, but it all begins and ends with the burgers for me, specifically the Tuscan.  You put bacon and goat cheese on a burger and I'll eat it, any time, anywhere.  The menu's pretty big, and every time I go I tell myself I'm going to branch out, but then I think about the Tuscan and....yeah, branching out doesn't happen often.  I've managed to pry myself away and get the chicken chorizo sandwich a few times and it's been just as delicious.  Chorizo chicken patty, tomato, and avocado?  Those are three of my favorite thing all on one sandwich.  The andouille sausage bites are also not to be missed.  My friends have branched out more than I have, and none of them have been disappointed.  For vegetarians or those avoiding red meat, all the burgers can be made with chicken or vegetarian options.  

Forcing myself to be objective, there are a few downsides.  The service CAN be slow at times.  Servers are always friendly, but if you're in a huge hurry this might not be the best choice.  And while I haven't sampled the entire menu, I've had a few things that weren't so great.  The tomato soup is basically just a bowl of chunky spaghetti sauce, and I'm not a huge fan of the mac & cheese bites (but my friend absolutely loved them, so that could just be me).  The burgers also tend to be cooked more on the \"medium well\" end of the spectrum regardless of how you order, so if you're someone who likes their burger rare you'll probably be disappointed.  It's also not the largest of restaurants, so it can get pretty packed, especially in the colder months when the patio is closed.  They also used to do this crazy brunch, which I miss.  They had a sandwich that was a homemade sausage patty (roughly the size of a baseball) with egg, sandwiched between two pieces of french toast.  Not something you see very often.  They still do the Bloody Mary bar on Sundays, but I wish they'd bring that menu back.  

I really had to stretch to come up with something negative to say about the Beer Engine, and the positives completely outweigh the negatives.  I should also mention that the kitchen is open late and also open 365 days a year.  I've spent more than my fair share of late nights, as well as a few Christmas's, here.  

Whenever I hear someone talk about coming to Lakewood to go to Melt I always tell them to skip the 3 hour wait and come here instead.  Laid-back and unpretentious, it's a must if you've never been."}
{"text":"After asking a local business (Breadsmith) where I could get a good burger for lunch I'm thankful I was routed to Beer Engine.  I've been craving a burger for weeks...problem solved.  This place is a great find and I'll be back.  The burger good quality meat, flavorful and juicy, but not greasy and of course I indulged in the fries (they also have homemade chips) and enjoyed the perfectly cooked shoestrings along with a nice cold amber ale of their own making.    I'm going to come back, bring some friends and try some other menu items.    Hopefully the same quality will flow through the whole menu."}
{"text":"I adore Beer Engine like you would not believe, and I have a really tough time believing all the people who say the service is poor -- it's nothing of the sort! Every single time we've eaten there (and since we live nearby, that's a lot!), we've had excellent, professional, knowledgeable service. 

The waitstaff are great at recommending beers you'll like based on other beers you've tried in the past. The pulled pork sandwich with blue cheese slaw is BEYOND amazing, as is their cheddar ale soup. My only complaint is that I really hate the tall-stool tables, I find them uncomfortable, but I'll sit wherever I can in order to eat the fantastic food there.

Now that I'm thinking about it, their chicken paprikash would be really tasty right now!"}
{"text":"Come for the beer, stay for the burger topped with pulled pork.  That's right, I said it.  You can get a beer and meat topped with meat.  If that doesn't sound good, then you're probably a vegetarian.  But there's nothing wrong with that.  Anywho, if you've done the beer tour at the Winking Lizard a couple times, you're probably ready for something new.  This is the place to find that something new.

I think most everything about this joint has already been said, but what the hell, this is my review.  They have more bottles than I care to count--who has time to count to 100 that's not a little kid showing off to their first grade teacher?  Not me.  I need to spend that time trying to sample all the awesome beers.  Some of the bottles on the menu, from time to time, are even aged items they cellered for a bit.  They also have ton of taps and a couple firkins of cask beer.  That's firkin awesome, har har har.  (Go ahead, groan).  

It's essentially a beer drinker's paradise with micro-brews of all sorts as far as the eye can see.  I always find something on the menu I've never drank before.  And if you're really confused, just ask one of the awesome bartenders for some help--they know their stuff and they are awesomely nice and helpful... and excited about beer.

Oh, and then there's the food.  It's good bar food: burgers, fried things, sandwiches, more fried things, etc...  That's not to say it's bad, just don't go here expecting caviar and bone marrow.  Actually, I really like their burgers and sweet potato fries myself.  The food is always consistent and I never have any complaints.

Well.... I do have one complaint.  This place can get crowded and you might be stuck waiting for a seat.  When the patio is open, it's generally not an issue.  Get here early or come on an off night if you really want to have some space.  Otherwise, be happy with the crowd and have fun.  Crowds aren't always bad.  Especially when you have so many beers available to drink and a burger stuffed with multiple meats."}
{"text":"I give the beer engine five stars this time, because I didn't have to wait as long this time, and I had something to compare it to. I still love the crazy huge beer selection, which alone gets five stars. The burgers and fish, awesome as usual. I loved our corner table, where we had plenty of room to relax. Towards 8:30/9ish on a Saturday, the crowd gets a little rowdy...Glasses dropping, women in fishnets, drunken idiots, you know. Entertainment wise, pretty exciting."}
{"text":"Even though they got rid of their white BBQ sauce, the food here is great bar food.  The burgers are great, the tots are amazing and those Mac n Cheese bites doh!"}
{"text":"Holy cow this place is awesome!  We recently moved to the area and were pleasently surprised about how reasonably priced BBE was for lunch or dinner.  They even have brunch on Sundays!  Big fans."}
{"text":"I have always had a good experience here. They have a fantastic beer selection of both their stuff and guest beers. The staff is really knowledgeable and will make recommendations. Food is delicious. The fried jalapeños are a great appetizer and the burgers are great. There is a small parking lot adjacent to the building but that fills up quickly. It's pretty easy to find street parking in the area though. Definitely recommend stopping by if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"I appreciate the different selection of Buckeye Beers they have on tap. Food is always good. Overall I would reccomend."}
{"text":"We were out here last weekend. We weren't really that impressed. 

Our service was great! However, I feel like their food is basic bar food. I was kind of expecting a bit different. Especially because of reviews. 

I had the corned beef hash and it was dry and lacked flavor. My husband ordered a burger and only ate a few bites because of the grease. We also had wings. They were not what I would consider wings. 

I don't think we'll be returning."}
{"text":"An excellent collection of craft beers and dynamic burgers. No other place like it! Not sure about a beer? Ask for taste samples."}
{"text":"Of course with a name referencing beer, their Beer selection is outstanding.  That being said, I went here with a large group and we were all really pleased with our food.  We started with some appetizers, fried pickles and cheese sticks both were very tasty.  Then for our meals we all had different burgers (there are like 20 to choose from).  I personally had the West Side burger that had a pierogi and sour cream right on the hamburger...this may sound disgusting, but let me tell you it was awesome.  I went ahead and got the pub chips with my burger and was very pleased.  A few people in my group, did spend the few extra bucks for the shoestring fries and they too were happy.  

It all was certainly tasty, and I plan to go back soon :)"}
{"text":"Buckeye Beer Engine?  My first thought is someone stole the name of my first born.  Second thought Beer... done thinking.

The event for this day was a cask aged beer tasting.  With a total of cask beers on tap of about 7 and average AC of 8-10%, happy fun time ensues.  I highly recommend a try of cask aged.  If you don't like the first one, make sure you don't stop there.  Casked aged beer has many varieties, and many good selections for the beer snobs and beer hogs alike. 

But this is about the Beer Engine.  Place was full at 2 in the afternoon on a Saturday.  I was able to quickly find a table though.  After trying each other's samples, I needed to cleanse the palate (pallet shmallit, get food in my belly stat, fun fact Palate: is the roof of the mouth in humans and other mammals.  It separates the oral cavity from the nasal cavity.  Does not taste things.)  I have been a good boy eating salads, and modifying my diet to be healthier.  So the veggie basket was the perfect choice.  What's this under the veggies?  Beer Battered and Fried Andouille Sausage with chili mayo dipping sauce.  It was as good as you think.

With other items on the menu such as chicken chorizo burger, and  My Big Fat Knockwurst Sandwich, you will find me returning.

Pros: above average food, very good beer selection (pages and pages of bottles including meads)

Cons: Parking, amount of seating, will power breaker"}
{"text":"This place had a really great, relaxed atmosphere, but the food was less than average. We had a burger and the potato latkes, which were not great. Our waitress was pretty rude too, she made us seem like we were an inconvenience. We did go back for late night $5 takeout burgers which were awesome."}
{"text":"The Bobz Big Boy Burger miiiiiight be the best burger in Cleveland. The house made veggie burger is also really good."}
{"text":"Friends.... 

I referred to this bar on a previous review of the AWESOME Brew Kettle, so I feel I must address it... ugh 

I have avoided this review for so long because I cant get over my ANGER about it. 

I have been reviewing for a bit of time and have a few cherished friends on the Yelp service ...not an elite guy.. just someone who loves Yelp, and uses it when I travel and always at home also. Yelp has been an agent to many many good times...so I want to give it back. 

So I feel I should not be so rank and angry to the point of becoming a cartoon of myself., and that is why I have avoided posting this review. 

I still avoid it today by being vague, I will give you a clue as to how FUCKING PISSED I AM. 

I live 1 mile from it 
They have great beer and very very good wings 
They are a bit pricey for Lakewood 
The unit is very well built...nice layout ... slick 
The service is the WORST SERVICE I HAVE HAD IN MY  LIFE 

I HAVE RUN RESTAURANTS FOR 20 PLUS YEARS AND IF ANYONE TREATED MY CUSTOMERS THE WAY I HAVE BEEN CONSISTENTLY TREATED AFTER 5 OR MORE VISITS ... AFTER TALKING TO THE MANAGER ( WHO TOLD ME HE WAS SORRY BUT THOSE SERVERS WHO TREATED US LIKE CRAP WERE HIS BEST...HERE IS A FREE BEER...THEN THE NEXT TIME WE RETURN THEY ARE STILL THERE AND TREAT US THE SAME W/O HIM THERE) 
I WOULD FIRE THEM SO FAST THAT A GOD DAMN BREEZE WOULD FOLLOW THEM THROUGH THE  BACKDOOR AS THEY RAN FROM THE JOINT WITH LAST CHECK IN POCKET!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

Well.... sorry for the caps ..

But the service is so OVER-THE-TOP-HORRIBLE ... I FELT LIKE A RUBE FOR PAYING MY BILL EACH TIME I WENT!!! 

I will detail my experiences on an update...just needed to say this today. 

Sorry to be this angry, but I cant find another place that treats anyone that is not a \"hot\" , \"young\" \"dude\" or \"babe\" like they are INVISIBLE until now... we AVERAGE PEOPLE made up the most of the crowd, but received very little service. 

And no..... I would not stand at Studio 54, in 1980, hoping to get past the velvet rope... perhaps they should have a fucking velvet rope at the BBE so that those customers whom the waitresses find  too pedestrian will not throw money at a business that will not respect them!!!!!!! 

You embarrass all of us who are in the service business ... 
I wish you could rate -1

{"text":"BBE. hhhhmmmm. i am only giving this two stars because i am not wow'd by the place. 
yes, lots of beer choices. hello, name. BUCKEYE BEER ENGINE. 
but the service is never that great. at times have to wait at a table for what seems like over 20 minutes just to put a drink order in. not cool. 
food. eh. just that. mediocre. i wanted to really like BBE, because i love craft beer and i love food. they do have a pretty big menu, but the food is just ok. nothing that is mind blowing. would i go back again? of course! just can not give a great rating, because it was just alright. someplace fun to try a variety of beers if you are into that whole craft beer thang."}
{"text":"All of my lakewood residing friends love this spot. The amount of beer on tap is something special. And their food is great to boot. We came on a Sunday after their brunch for some mimosas and lunch food and boy did they deliver. I was strictly juicing, meaning only drinking mimosas. The blood orange was so tasty. My other girlfriend had the peach and she was dying over it. 
One ordered the pierogis and the other got the 76 burger, with chicken and bacon and was so thrilled with it. 
When their food was brought out the smell alone was making me jealous. Not only did it look incredible they seemed to have got it down to the last detail of their order, aside from the extra mayo for the 76 burger. They brought it out in a hurry and all was good again. 
I will definitely come back this spot and try their brunch!! Our waitress was so lovely and on her stuff!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in Lakewood!  i love the beer selection and the food is wonderful!  I love the wings especially and usually get the beer caps.  The patio in the summer provides some of the best outdoor drinking around! When i have friends in from out of town, their sunday brunch is my favorite place to show off what fun it is to live around here."}
{"text":"Honey Golden wings wer great! The burgers are super delicious and the shoestring fries in the homemade ranch were a delight! Great beer selection"}
{"text":"Delicious! 

We both liked our dinner and that's a feat in itself! 

My husband ordered the wake and bake tots - so good and he had the waygou burger which he said was fantastic. The chips were delicious, as was the fried pickle 

I ordered the sausage platter - my husband ate my bratwurst - my kielbasa was yum, potato pancakes were good (hubs said they were the best he's ever had), the sauerkraut was delicious and the homemade applesauce was like baked apples YUM

Hubs also had two beers: the Fuller's London Porter and the Epic Big Bad Baptista. He enjoyed them both!"}
{"text":"I get it..Cavs game..they were busy....we went in assuming it would be packed.   However, we got a seat at the bar and waited at least 5 minutes to even get acknowledged. We had to ask for a food menu twice just to have them forcefully placed in front of us (sorry to irritate you).   So we wait...and wait....and wait....
The game is now over and finally we get approached to place a food order.   At this point, we already had a Lyft on the way (cuz we were starving) and we're chugging our drinks beyond ready to leave.   Paid cash so we wouldn't have to wait 3 hours to have a credit card ran.    I was really excited to check this place out...unfortunately I will not be back."}
{"text":"Having just moved to Lakewood from the Parma/North Royalton area, the Buckeye Beer Engine had some pretty large shoes to fill. You see, I am spoiled by the awesome splendor that is The Brew Kettle in Strongsville, a place my wife and I hold very dear to our hearts.

I was told by several people that \"if you like Brew Kettle you'll love Buckeye Beer Engine.\" I guess I won't be listening to those people any more.

Like BK, BBE has a large menu of micro brews that you can drink my the pint or sample several. It also has a nice selection of burgers, wings and other semi-upscale bar food selections. But that is where the similarities end.

We decided to sit outside in the patio area. That's where the problems began. Two gentleman were sitting one table away chain smoking the entire time. I am not sure if this is permitted under the smoking ban, but regardless I did not appreciate their smoke in my face the entire meal. The waitress was aware of this, but did nothing about it.

I ordered a burger that came with mushrooms and cheese and a garlic butter sauce. Could have been delicious, but the meat was so undercooked I was sure I was going to get food poisoning. Thankfully I didn't.

I also ordered some wings, which is a must at any establishment such as this. They came out over cooked and had barely any sauce on them, Just tasted like charred chicken skin with a hint of BBQ sauce. 

The burger came with a fried pickle, which was a new thing for me. It was the most interesting part of the meal.

All in all I think I'd make the drive from Lakewood to Strongsville for Brew Kettle before I drove 6 blocks back to the Beer Engine. I recommend you do the same."}
{"text":"There was a time in my life when I ate here twice a week. I also gained a considerable amount of weight in that time (coincidence? Doubtful). But I still come in a couple times a month. Great food, great beer. What else can one say?"}
{"text":"The black bean patty here is awesome. I like to pair it with sweet potato fries and one of their microbrews.  Beware Mondays are not good for ordering the black bean patties because sometimes they run out over the weekend. Our waitress told me they batch them on Tuesdays."}
{"text":"I really enjoy going to Beer engine. I love the variety of Stout they carry. However all 3 times I have come to this restaurant, I always find a hair in my food. I've ordered different food each time; Veggie burger, cheese steak, regular burger. Each time I have a hair of some sort in my mouth by the end of the night. I have alopecia so it's obviously not my hair. Lol If that could be taken care of, I'd come a lot more regularly."}
{"text":"In my past visits to Cleveland, I always end up in Lakewood for a majority of the time. I really like Lakewood. If I lived in Cleveland, I would almost certainly live there.
But I don't live in Cleveland so, when I come to Cleveland, I want to partake in all that is great about Cleveland. Beer is one of those great things there. I don't know what it is about Northeast Ohio, but they make some fantastic beer there, especially when comparing it to the stuff in the rest of the state.
I came in at an off hour and found the place virtually empty, which is what I like when I hit a brewpub. It was also their happy hour, which means $2 off burgers and $1 off Buckeye pints. Yum for both.
I ordered a black bean burger and started in on the beers, not holding back because I had come there and was returning to my hotel via public transit.
Out of 26 or so taps, they only have four Buckeye beers. This really threw me off and, as I asked them about it (the bartender and the brewer, who was just hanging around the place, it seemed), it got more confusing. They have a brewery down the street but no store or tap room for that brewery. They brew more than four beers, but have only four on tap here. Others are bottled and those are available as bottles at the Engine. However, they also distribute kegs to a few places in town, all of which have beers that are not on tape at the Engine, but do not have any beers that are on tap at the Engine. Make sense?
First I'll talk about the food. The black bean burger patty was homemade according to the menu and bartender, so I had to have it (love these). With the chips and a huge fried pickle, it came out to $4.75 with the happy hour special. It was called the \"spicy black bean burger\" but wasn't spicy. It was actually pretty bland: mostly black beans and little else. HOWEVER, it came with what they called a \"wucumber sauce,\" which was a sort of wasabi/cucumber mayo type thing, similar to horsey sauce but a lot better. That did make it spicy, and it worked fabulously for the chips as well. My complaint about the burger was that it was served with a ton of red onion on it. I could have pulled it off though. I just didn't notice it had that much at first.
And the beers. Cleveland bars seem to have a spectacular tap and bottle selection. I was told by a local friend that this is not always the case and we were just lucking out, but I don't see how that's possible that many times. This place really tries to be #1 in that respect. They have some great California (Stone, North Coast), Ohio (Thirsty Dog), Colorado (Great Divide) and other taps. Like I said, 26 of them and only 4 of their own. But then you get into the bottle list, and it's just overwhelming. You've got these regional small batch ones that you've never heard of, but then this fantastic California stuff like Ale Smith (I didn't even know you could get that in Cleveland), Belgians, etc. And, like all of these bars with great bottle selections, you can almost always feel certain that you're going to like the beer as long as you like beer in general and like that style of beer.
So I ended up with their 76 IPA, their imperial stout and their farmhouse. If you go there, you very likely will not see all of these beers on tap, if any of them. Small breweries like this don't always make much of a particular type of beer and, even if they do, this place apparently switches out their taps quite a bit.
Definitely give this place a shot if you really like your beer."}
{"text":"I live in the area and the staff is consistently rude. I recently came in to get take out and a sever asked if I was picking up. I said yes, they just walked away and started cleaning? I also didn't get the right dressing."}
{"text":"Still unmatched as far as beer selection goes, although there's rumor of a new world of beer coming to the detroit/warren area in downtown lakewood.

I just recently tried the brunch and I can't believe I didn't come sooner!  I ordered the Chicken & Waffles and I declared out loud that I was not going to be able to finish it.  Nope, I was wrongI I practically ate it all because it was that good.  I couldn't stop eating because each bite was more flavorful than the next.  The chicken was crispy yet moist and the waffle had a delicate crispness to it.  Also, I loved the chipotle butter it came with.  I treated myself to their Bloody Mary Bar, which was quite impressive.  I appreciated the fact that they had olive juice AND Blue Cheese stuffed olives.  I will be back soon fo sho!"}
{"text":"Buckeye Beer Engine is one of my favorite bars/restaurants in Lakewood. The menu changes often but is always full of unique mouth watering burgers, wraps, sandwiches and much more. Moreover, the vast beer list can surely please all beer type preferences. The restaurant is equipped with friendly staff, a full bar, dining area, and outdoor patio. I highly recommend trying Buckeye Beer Engine for Sunday brunch. They offer a Bloody Mary bar and a brunch menu that is to die for."}
{"text":"Ordered the double sasquatch with their coleslaw and it was amazing.  The beer selection is massive and the place has a great atmosphere"}
{"text":"Took a trip to this neat little town of Lakewood Ohio. 
  Couldn't decide where to go so we picked burgers and beer. Most of the dining in the area is on the same street and everything looked pretty crowded for a Friday night. 
   The food was really good burgers were cooked spot on. I would definitely get tater tots on my next trip because the fries were over cooked because they were shoestring fries. The cooks must have been backed up on this particular night because our waitress was pretty good but it took some time to get our food. (Hence the 3 star review). If you like craft beer this place is the place to go. They have a huge selection and the waitress was nice enough to let us try a few sips of 4 of the beers she thought would be close to a bud light. (Lol) gotta have my bud light. 
    I would recommend this little place to catch an Indians game and get a good burger but I would like to return to this little town to try a few of the other places on this little strip thanks to all the reviews on yelp."}
{"text":"I'm probably a little biased because I can walk to Buckeye (and then stumble on home), but it is easily one of my favorite restaurants/bars in the Cleveland area. Their beer selection is fantastic, even though I can say that the Buckeye beers themselves have never impressed me. You have to love a place that has a several page long beer menu (that's the bottles, they have probably 20-25 on tap). They take their beer seriously, and have 2 cask beers most of the time as well.

The menu isn't huge, but everything I've had is fantastic. As someone who doesn't eat a lot of meat, I love that for any burger, you have the option of a regular hamburger patty, chicken, or a black bean burger. The chicken is decent, but I love the black bean burgers. The West Side burger, with cheese, onions, a pierogi, and some sour cream is a favorite. I prefer to swap out chips in favor of their onion rings. While you tend to only get 4-5 in a serving, these aren't your wimpy frozen onion rings from a drive-thru. These are HUGE sliced up recently onion rings. I can't finish a full serving typically, but they're the best onion rings I've ever had. 

Sure, it's bar food and not the fanciest place, but I love it. The decor is fun, and the patio is a personal favorite come summer time. There does tend to be a wait, especially on weekends. I've always had stellar service, even when the place is super packed. They also occasionally do special evenings (the Southern Tier event a year or so ago was amazing - beers paired with a large meal with several servings), check those out if you can. When it's busy it can also get super loud, so maybe not the best romantic place - but that depends on how you define romance (for me, this totally works because we can geek out over beer)."}
{"text":"Poor service & the are always out of several beers I love. I went twice and will not return for a third time."}
{"text":"God bless the perverted genius who invented the Fatty Melt: a delicious burger equipped not with a bun, but two grilled cheese sandwiches with tomato and bacon. Even ordering this burger in mixed company led to a tiny bit of shame, followed by a sense of pride when it arrived and I became the envy of everyone within a 10-foot radius. \"Why didn't I order that, dammit?\" was the silent cry that I could feel piercing my shell like arrows. Thank goodness I was too busy trying to fit the burger into my mouth to let the needs of others get me down.

I was also totally impressed by the beer made at this place. They have an obscene amount of stuff on tap (and in bottles), but there's no reason not to get one of the house brews. I recommend the unfortunately named \"Buckeye Bling Bling,\" which is their strong, ambrosial pale ale."}
{"text":"Been here many times for bar and tables.  Food always good and bartenders can be anywhere from overbearing to downright non-existent.  Depends who ya get.  They never seem to make small talk though.  Place gets packed for brunch.  White people LOVE brunch.  Bloody Mary bar is cool.  Only thing that gets me is that the place is WAY overpriced on their booze.  Snifters of beer for 12.00?  C'mon.  Better come with a reach-around.  Guess now they have a limited late night food menu that has good deals so just have a few and mosey on down the road...."}
{"text":"This weekend wasn't the first time I've been to BBE, but it may have been the time that I was finally won over.  I mean, it wouldn't have taken much - we were exhausted from a full day of Memorial Day weekend cookout nonsense, and just needed to Eat Something Right Now Please And Thank You.  BBE was open, it wasn't too busy, and drinks and food made their way to our table and then into our bellies in no time flat.  Good stuff.

In all seriousness, though, I'm glad that BBE is around the corner from my in-laws for a couple of reasons.  First, the beer selection is fantastic.  With pages and pages of regularly updated options, you have no excuse for not being able to find a beer that you like.  That is, unless you just don't like beer, and then maybe you should ask yourself why you're in an establishment with BEER in the name.

Second, as far as bar food goes, BBE is SOLID.  And you will be too if you eat too many Fatty Melts - two grilled cheeses with a burger patty in between.

Third, I just feel like this is the kind of place that every neighborhood needs.  Average service, solid food, good drinks - the kind of the place where you could be a regular if your arteries can stand it, or where you can stop in for a good sandwich and a growler when you're in from out of town.  I really wish we had more places like BBE in Ann Arbor, though I'm not sure that any of my clothes would fit if we did."}
{"text":"Been here a few times prior to trying the food. The beer selection is totally unique, but  in the best way. (Also always changing, so expect that.) First time in was the night a couple friends of mine got engaged. Plenty of drinks were ordered but the ones that stuck out for me were their own Buckeye Cleveland Porter and Sam Adams Rebel! Some serious delicious treats here.

Tonight I came back, this time with my parents to try out some dinner. I want to commend them on their winter seasonal specials. Chicken Paprikash, House Spaetzle, and Corned beef Reuben were the quickest picks my parents and I had ever made at a restaurant. They really make these dishes their own at the Beer Engine! I originally came here to try a burger (with the help of Yelp) but couldn't pass on these seasonal plates. An Energizer (appetizer) of Pierogies only completed the experience. Everything so good! This is my type of restaurant. Great food, even better beers! If only they delivered.."}
{"text":"Cool spot with lots of great beers on tap! The food was really good and I especially enjoyed the appetizers we had. The pierogies were very good and so were the deep fried pickles. I guess you really can't go wrong with that though lol. However, I would pass on the pretzels and mustard appetizer.

I had the grilled chicken sandwich and shoe string fries. It was cooked just right! Luckily I saw that they served shoe string fries on the menu because our waiter didn't list them when he told us our choice of sides. The service was decent and we enjoyed our time there. I like that they have a front patio. I'll definitely be back to eat and enjoy one of their many delicious beers!"}
{"text":"We had the Fatty Melt which was a burger between 2 grilled cheese sandwiches. The flavor was amazing as were the fried jalapenos and sausage."}
{"text":"I don't eat burgers and I don't drink beer, so I'm not even quite sure what possessed me to drop in to the Buckeye Beer Engine.  Maybe it was the fact that their menu boasts that they're vegetarian friendly?  Which they are, if you're looking for deep fried vegetarian goodness or a mushroom sandwich.

I tried the fried pickles and thought they were pretty tasty.  The breading was good.  Had the deep fried mushrooms and thought they were ok.  You could tell that they were made fresh at some point...but definitely not the day I was there.  They were a little funky, as in \"this mushroom is reaching the end of its life expectancy\" funky.  Oh well.

Wanting to eat something that wasn't deep fried, I opted for a portabella sandwich.  I'm not the biggest portabella mushroom cap fan to begin with, and the one on my sandwich was not good.  Not sure what it was marinated in, but the sauce plus the roasted red peppers and goat cheese was not my cup of tea.  I only ate a couple bites of it.  Good thing I opted for fries, or I would have been staring sullenly at my boyfriend while he ate.  Although the addition of fries to me meal made my entire meal, well, fried.  Healthy eating FAIL.

My boyfriend was able to enjoy a couple of craft brews and had what he called an ok burger.  He's a bit of a burger snob, so it would be hard for anyone to top his burger creations, in his opinion, so I'd say that they burger was probably great.  If you're into that sort of thing.

Definitely worth checking out if you like burgers and/or beer.  If not, you might want to drink and dine elsewhere."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here awhile ago with friends. We live around the corner so we popped over for a burger. It was really good. We don't eat out a ton now and with all the Lakewood restaurants we hadn't been back there. 
I worked the Lakewood Car Kulture show on Sunday and my husband came up and we got lunch. He had the burger and I had the brats they were slingin' outside for the festival. Holy man alive were they good. And the homemade chips? Definitely stopping up there again soon!"}
{"text":"My word, the Beer Engine is the cat's meow if we may say so!

From the delectable hamburgs to the vast list of malt beverages, our party left full and favored; all while sparing a few clams on the reasonable prices.

The Beer Engine is on the up and up in our book!"}
{"text":"This place is very over rated. They are suppoused to have great burgers but I have definitely had better. Kinda dissapointing."}
{"text":"Somehow I always end up here for happy hour, and I'm not particularly sure why. It's a local feel bar with a pretty decent drinks list, but it's certainly no place you'd pick for an excellent night out. Good for an after work brew, but that's about it."}
{"text":"Wake and bake tots? So fantastic.  Great service too."}
{"text":"Beer is good. Food...not so much. My wife chose this place for her birthday. We had the pretzel sticks and beer cheese dip, but the dip tasted overcooked, lacked flavor and came in the smallest side container.. My wife's boneless chicken wings were burnt and rock hard that her fork bent when trying to pick up a BONELESS wing. Waitress said they overcooked the chicken in fear of listeria. My pulled pork sandwich was okay, but nothing to write home about. 

...We won't be back."}
{"text":"Great little beer bar. Excellent rotating tap list and knowledgeable staff. I read a few bad reviews, mostly complaining about the food. If you're looking for a fine dining experience, this place is not it. However if you want a good selection of beer, decent pub menu, and a nice atmosphere to enjoy it all in, this is your place."}
{"text":"Great Selection of Beers the food was average. Everyone was making a big fuss about the burgers, I thought it was average at best. I will agree with the guy who said the burger was flavorless. The beer was phenomenal. Ill be back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were visiting Cleveland and decided to give this place a try!  It was so great we decided to come back the next night!  We both had their burgers, which were excellent. We recommend the brisket burger and the don't hold the bacon burger. Wings were also some of the best we've had!"}
{"text":"In my opinion BBE  is the best choice for burgers and craft beers. They had a chicken and dumpling soup that I could eat everyday. The hippie, big juan, Tuscan and Cyclops burgers are some of the best to are going to find in NE Ohio. If you want comfort food, the Smoked Mac and Cheese is pretty amazing on a cold winter's night. The burgers of the month are always spot on and if you have a cheat day in your diet the wild improbable burgers are totally worth it. Other great menu items are the hot Italian sandwich and the Turkey Reuben.

I also suggest BBE to people who are coming to Lakewood for an evening out, whether it is for a special occasion, date night, guys/girls night out or just wanting to try something different and new.

The staff at BBE is some of the best you are going to find.They are warm, friendly, inviting, attentive and knowledgeable about beer and always will to assist customers in finding their new favorite beer. They are so personable that going in alone is more like meeting up with a friend in how well they engage and create conversations with the customers. I highly recommend it to everyone and look forward to many more trips in the not too distant future.

With that said do not let my previous review detract from your interest in trying this Lakewood treasure. The chowder was not great in my opinion but the menu is full of wonderful options and worth the trip. So three Cheers to BBE"}
{"text":"Maybe if I drank more this would be a good choice... food was icky- I ordered a daily special- ham and cheese on a pretzel bun and it mushy microwaved mess."}
{"text":"I would not recommend this place. Myself and 3 other guest dined there today and it was a terrible experience. We sat down at 5:10pm and it took our waitress, Lisa about 30 minutes to even come take our orders or check if we were ready. Then we did not receive our appetizers/salads until 6:30pm. When we arrived it was not very busy. There were several open seats in our section and it is not a very large restaurant. From the time we had our order taken to the time another waitress brought our salads/apps our waitress, Lisa did not even bother to let us know a status update on our food and totally avoided eye contact at all. In fact, the manager was the one who told us our salads would be out soon. The second the salads hit the table she all of a sudden could see us again and quickly came over. We did not eat until 7pm. By this time several other patrons had decided that they waited long enough and left. The food was just mediocre and might I add the salads were tiny. The manager came back out and added he felt bad and offered a free app the next time we came in. Thing is I wont be returning because of the poor service and mediocre food."}
{"text":"Buckeye Beer Engine is always a favorite because they really do have a very robust beer selection. We stopped in on a Saturday evening, and they had a barleywine takeover from Sierra Nevada and Lagunitas. It was pretty cool because they not only have a wide selection of barleywine beers, but also different vintages of the same beers. 

We sat at the bar, and the bartender was very attentive the whole time we were there. We also ordered some delicious mac and cheese bites to go with the barleywine! When I'm in Cleveland, I will definitely be sure to visit the Buckeye Beer Engine again."}
{"text":"I had a great time when I have been there.  They carry some beers that can't be found on tap anywhere within 150-200 mile radius.  When I was there they had Chimay on tap (Hmmmm ... beer).  Ironically enough, they also have PBR on tap.

Didn't have anything to eat, but everything I saw go by my table looked very good."}
{"text":"This place is darn near perfect in my mind. A beer list as long as my arm, great food, and friendly service. I really couldn't ask for more. On a recent visit my husband and I were craving cheeseburgers, so he went with the Tuscan (goat cheese, roasted red peppers, caramelized onions) and I chose the sliders. We both opted to substitute their shoestring fries for the chips (which are very good). For our beers, the husband had a Wyder's Pear Cider and a Hofbrauhaus, and I sampled an oatmeal stout and Brooklyn's Cuvee Noire. The beer list changes frequently and beer snobs will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"If I lived in the Cleveland area this would be a place I would be at often. The selection of beers is amazing. 

The day my finacé and I stopped in, they had four of their beers on tap, so those where the ones I ended up trying. We ordered the Buckeye 76 IPA, Buckeye Arthur Ale, Buckeye Wheat Cloud and the Buckeye Yuppie. All of them were very good. I love that you can get a sample glass of any of the beers they had on tap (and they had a lot of different beers on tap), its such a great idea. You usually only see that option at brewpubs for the house brews.  I wish I was there for longer so I could try some more of the beers they had on tap - there were a lot I'd never seen before.

To go along with the tasty beer my finacé and I ordered up the beer caps (deep fried jalapeno slices), boneless wings with the honey gold sauce and a schnitzel sandwich. I don't think either of us had tried schnitzel before so we were happy to give it a try. I enjoyed it but it was really greasy. The spicy mustard mayo they serve with it really made the sandwich. But my favorite thing was the beer caps. I love jalapeno poppers and these little guys were just as good. Oh! I can't forget about the boneless wings the honey gold sauce- they were great, it was a honey mustard sauce and was just a very, very tasty sauce for the wings.

If you live in the area you need to check out Buckeye and if you are making a trip to the Cleveland area and love beer make sure to add Buckeye to the list of places to visit."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite burger place in Cleveland. The Cyclops burger (sunny side egg, applewood bacon and cheddar cheese) is hands down the best. 

I'm not a big breakfast person, but my boyfriend also loves their brunch. Plus, beer selection is unique."}
{"text":"Great food service at the bar. We we there on a busy Saturday night, and drinks were never empty, and food was prompt and good. Had the hottest boneless chicken chunks with were blazing hot. I like hot, but this was a little too much for me. If you like inferno hot, give them a try."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing burgers. Huge beer list. Hopefully they get the strawberry beer from last year again this year - it was delicious and a very lovely and alluring shade of pink!"}
{"text":"Wonder how they came up with the name??  Buckeye...Ohio.  Got that part.  Beer.  Well, HELLLLOOOO....amazing selection.  Engine?  Hmmmm.  Maybe the beer is the engine that drives this establishment. In fact, I'm kind of picturing beer cans as pistons driving that baby!  Works for me.  

What else works for me is the BURGERS!!!!!!!!  These guys know how to build one creative and delicious mouthful of meat.  And I mean that in the nicest way, of course.  Twenty, count 'em, TWENTY kinds of burgers on their regular menu...that doesn't include the burger of the month which usually is yet another stupendous creation.  Then there's the Fatty Melt.  A half pound burger, bacon and tomato nestled between TWO grilled cheese sandwiches?  Be still my heart.....sure do hope there's a defibrilator available to start it again!

Brunch on weekends is pretty satisfying, too.  Rocking French toast, pancakes, corned beef hash, eggs and omelets....but the best (if you read my stuff, you know my weakness)...Bloody Mary Bar!!!!!!!  

Relaxed, delicious, friendly....good food and drinks!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Went Xmas eve and food and server were great! But we were refused a. larger (open) table w 2 more seats badly needed. It wound up being taken later by less people. Just wouldn't cram people in a booth on a holiday like that. Ambiance lacking  too. I remember dimmer lights and maybe a bit more music for a dining room filled w people celebrating..."}
{"text":"This place is great. It's a go-to when I have family in town. Laid back atmosphere, great beer selection, friendly staff. Vegetarian friendly and a carnivores favorite as well. My favorite thing to get is the west side burger, sub for a black bean burger, and add sauerkraut-give it a try!"}
{"text":"They had a very large, [over 100 bottles and probably 20+ taps] Microbrew selection, listed on laminated sheets, with the prices, IBUs, ABVs, and a 10 word description - awesome, I wish every bar did this !!). The microbrew selection was quite varied and reasonably priced, and included some more expensive ones ($20+ for some Meads and Barley Wines), plus ironic choices of Genesse, PBR, and Blatz. I was surprised that they didn't have 
any Great Lakes (although that is their competition, I guess). 

80s pop from Sirius/XM filled the air until my table commandered the jukebox [the B-52s crossed my line] (2 credits, usually means one song, for $1, meh). I have to admit though, I couldn't decide what to look at: the menu, the game, or the talent. [that makes me sound really sleezy, yuck]. 
During my first visit on Thursday night, the atmosphere was laid-back, all ages, middle-class. The Cavs-Celtics game on TV drew little attention from the crowd. 

I had a sampler of beers, which our server wrote down the identifying brews on a slip of paper. The Buckeye Oatmeal Stout wasn't as thick as I hoped but my other choices were fine. They also had a range of burgers [including free-range chicken, beef, or a black-been patty); I had a sandwich of 2 chicken breasts, lightly grilled, with fresh red peppers, and bacon - very good. 

Although it was very crowded when I first arrived and waited for a table, the service was solid at our table and at the bar.
Definitely will be back again to check out the patio in the summer and is shortlist for my bars to go in Lakewood."}
{"text":"Buckeye Beer Engine is a beer lovers paradise in Lakewood, Ohio.

An ENORMOUS selection (probably the best i've ever seen, in one place) of craft beers, imports, and local selections will provide you with whatever you could possibly be looking for. The staff, while pretentious, knows their beers backwards and forwards and is more than willing to help you find something to suit your tastes. Cask beers make for special selections, and always make me happy.

(Don't make the embarassing mistake one of my girl friends made and attempt to order a cocktail. They will stare at you like an alien)

Prices are very reasonable (at least to my east coast standards) and the atmosphere is warm and bright. The food is standard pub faire for Lakewood. There's lots of seating, i've never had to wait for a table even during the busier times."}
{"text":"I was greeted with rudeness by our waitress, that continued throughout the night..   In till the point that I just had to get up and leave.... 
the beer selection might be good, but its not worth it because The service at this place is awful, and rude."}
{"text":"We have considered moving to Lakewood to be closer to the Beer Engine.  Serving tavern food with a twist, I've never had an average meal here: the fried bologna on a pretzel bun is so good, I have to resist ordering it every time we go.  While the cooking isn't super-refined, BE is one of the few places I would order anything off the menu knowing it would be tasty.  Even the black bean sliders were delicious, and I feel like vegetarian options often play second fiddle.  The beer selection is excellent - really my only gripe is that BE isn't bigger, because the wait is sometimes a drag.  Go, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"High quality affordable craft beer, what else do I need to write."}
{"text":"Came for lunch and ordered a hot dog with chips. Not only was it a big ol' beefer bursting with hot-off-the-grille flavor, the special that day brought my meal down to $4. Are you kidding? For that quality of Frankfurt for $4, the Beer Engine can expect me back for many more lunch hours."}
{"text":"Amazing beer selection, and great food to go with it.  

So many beers here it takes more time to decide which beer to drink than what food to eat.  

The fried andouille bites were a great start to a meal, and went great with a nice IPA.  The burger was great.

It was a little crowded and loud, but a nice place either way."}
{"text":"Great beer selection, always friendly service, great bar food and a cool atmosphere.  There isn't much to not like about this place.

The Burgers of the Month/Wildly improbable Burgers of the month are always a treat.  I especially enjoyed the Firecracker Burger that was available this past July.  They also have some pretty fantastic appetizers especially good are the Adobo beef Egg rolls and the beer battered sausage bites.

The beer selection is staggering; There  are usually 30+ beers on draft and countless beers available by The bottle.  The Buckeye beers I have tried have been average in my opinion but with such a huge selection it doesn't really matter as no matter your beer preference you will find something you like."}
{"text":"No no and no! We went several weeks ago in the middle of the day on a Wednesday. They were out of all kinds of beer, mainly the IPAs which we typically get. The food was so salty that we could barely eat it and I'm pretty sure we left half our meals. The service was slow and there wasn't even that many people there. It had been a while since I was there before this and don't remember it being so bad, so I hope I caught them on a bad day, but regardless I won't go back to find out."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a place with great food, great beer, and a great atmosphere, this place is for you! The first time I tried this place was honestly because barrio (right next door) had an hour wait and we were starving. We decided to try Beer Engine and were not disappointed. They have a great selection of beers at a reasonable price and an extensive food menu. Some of my favorites are the beer cheese cheesesteak or the buffalo chicken salad. Everything I've tried has always been awesome. They also have a great brunch on Saturdays and Sundays with a full Bloody Mary bar. I'm not a huge fan of the Bloody Mary, so I can't say I've tried it, but I've always heard great things. For brunch, I got a huevosdilla (egg quesadilla) that was spicy and delicious and perfect. Point is, no matter what you get here, you will never be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I sort of want to give this place only 2 stars but there were a couple of redeeming features. It's also possible that we are spoiled by the quality and variety of restaurants in LA so maybe judging by LA standards is too hard... But nonetheless here it is.

Service: Weak. The server seemed mightily irritated that we wanted food. Her back-up was good which saved her from going completely tipless.

Food: Avoid all the appetizers, they are ALL horrible. The fried portabellos had a batter that must surely have been created using the old dishwater. They also held so much scalding cooking oil that it literally blistered my lip even though I had waited a good 5 minutes to try eating one, and had taken a very cautious bite. The mac n cheese squares were like battered tire rubber, the andouille things inedible.

The good: Their BBQ sauces are delicious and the sliders were very good. We ordered 2 with goat cheese and 2 with American. The goat cheese with some of the BBQ sauce made for a very tasty little slider. But unfortunately yet another complaint - we ordered with the onions on the side but received food with the onions on it. The grumpy waitress offered resentfully to take the plate back but since I prefer no spit in my food we just took it as it was presented.

So overall, this place is a hardcore no for me. I'll find some other places to try, maybe in Tremont instead. Tremont folks seemed overall very friendly and service good."}
{"text":"Stopped by for dinner w colleague after a late night flight arrival. One of few places open at 10pm. Looked dark outside and parked on street a block or so away, but realized they have their own parking lot and it was fairly bright inside. Ordered the pretzel sticks with beer cheese sauce and sausage schnitzel platter. Generous portions. The cheese sauce was good, and sausage platter was huge! It had apple sauce, two types of sausage (good but the Pinker kind was very salty), sauerkraut, two potatoe pancakes, and a large piece of fried pork. I took it home for leftovers. For the portion relative to price, I was pleased. Service at this hour was slightly slow. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Seasonal Cobb.  For $11 it came out with nothing but lettuce and red cabbage.  Sent it back and they threw on capers, garbanzo beans and avocado.  Couldn't see the avocado.   Too much red cabbage.  No tomatoes. No cucumbers.   No red onion. Even the regular bar tender was crabby.  Disappointing."}
{"text":"Great stop after picking up my sis from the airport. Have been in the evening when it was jam packed, so it was nice to go for a late lunch when things were more low key. Although it clearly caters to adult taste buds, kids are still welcome. No kids menu, though.

My boys both went for Bobs Big Boyz burger: can you guess why? Perfect size for these growing kiddos. Except they did have me scrape the load of lettuce mixed with mayo off. Think they skipped reading the burger description.

Sis had the Purple Haze burger, aptly named based on the beet aioli. Also had goat cheese and spinach. Was supposed to be arugula, but they hadn't received a shipment due to holidays. Chef came out to ask about the sub and apologized profusely.

I had the special - O'Canada burger. With fat polenta cake, Canadian bacon, spinach and some other aioli. It was tasty, but the polenta cake was maybe a bit too fat. Or needed aioli on both buns otherwise it was a bit dry.

Good beer selections. I had a seasonal Buckeye - Ho ho ho and sis went for their Porter. Both ok."}
{"text":"Before St. Patrick's Day this year, I might have given the Beer Engine 3 stars. *might*. We had been there a couple times before and it was just ok - food is average bar sandwich/burger type of stuff. Yes, they have a good beer list but who doesn't anymore? That alone really doesn't earn you many points in my book these days. Some will say, 'hey the service sucks and the food is just ok, but hey they have an awesome beer list'. NOT THIS GIRL. Sorry, I'd rather go somewhere with a good beer list, good food and decent service. 

Aaaanyway, on St. Patrick's Day, we had plans to meet up with people here since they are enamored with the beer list and they were supposed to be serving breakfast. So around 10am, we headed here to meet up. I was starving and excited to get some good grub. In my experience, bars do often have really yummy brunch so I was hopeful - especially since my friends assured me that they have  a good brunch menu here.

When we arrived, we were able to find a table quickly and the service was fine. We ordered some beers and began the day. When it came time to order food, we were surprised to learn that they were not only not serving their normal menu, but they only had ONE option for breakfast. ONE! Corned beef hash and eggs. Ok fine, I'll eat that but would have appreciated another option or two. All would have been well because I do eat most things....but the food was bad. Nasty even. My eggs were totally overcooked (if you have a brunch menu and cannot cook an egg properly it drives me insane!) and the hash was totally mushy and gross. You could tell they just had a giant vat of it with a scoop back there. NO GOOD at all. 

Not only is there one option for breakfast - the rest of the St. Patrick's Day 'menu' (consisting of mostly corned beef sandwiches) - wasn't available until hours later. What? You can't get me an f'ing corned beef sandwich? The waitress said they 'might' have their regular menu available around 3pm. You might? Apparently the Beer Engine was taken by surprise by this phenomenon known as St. Patrick's Day. 

On top of it all, they have a single bathroom. NO. You are a bar. Do what you have to do to get more than one. 

Now you might say - come on you can't judge a place by St. Patrick's Day. OH YES I CAN! Plus, I've been there other times. Not a fan of the Beer Engine. Would rather go to 10 other places if just for a 'great beer list'."}
{"text":"This place is OK. Staff is friendly, beer selection ok but it is a little expensive, food is pretty good. Usually a pretty busy place."}
{"text":"Fantastic customer service!! The only reason I gave it four out of five stars is because the first three drinks that my husband and I requested were out and we had to choose again. The waitress was extremely patient and suggested similar finds. Can't really fault them though, the selection was easily worth accommodating to. We will be going back for sure!"}
{"text":"Great Food and wide selection of craft beers.  The serving staff was there to meet our every need."}
{"text":"Service was great, food was great, location was great and we could win a trip with our beer purchase... What more could you ask for?!?"}
{"text":"I was in here for a drink a few months ago and had been excited to come back for dinner after reading all of the positive reviews! We came last night at 8 and only had to wait 15 minutes when we were seated by the nicest hostess ever. The service was prompt and friendly!

We started with the honey gold chicken wings and when we got them we literally  laughed out loud. They were the smallest baby chicken wings we have ever gotten at a restaurant. After the initial shock of the size, we realized they were really good. But none the less we will definitely never order these again because they weren't worth it. 

Onto the star here, the creative burger combinations!  There were so many to chose from! I chose the Tuscan and my other half got the Cajun burger. I'm not usually a pain at restaurants but when I cut into my burger it was brutally overdone. I sent it back only because I wanted them to stand a chance when it came to reviewing them. They handled it really well and my new burger was brought out in five minutes. I'm glad I said something because the second try was awesome! The burger tasted so good  ands he flavor worked so well with the bacon and rosemary goat cheese. My boyfriend also liked his burger a lot, although the Cajun was a little intense for my liking. We also went with the shoestring fries, no complaint here. 

Overall, this is probably a three star restaurant but due to the really affordable prices and the way they fixed my burger no problems asked I happily give them four stars!"}
{"text":"Really great burgers! Also would suggest getting the tots as opposed to fries - they are amazing! For an appetizer we ordered the mac n cheese bites and they were awesome! The place is pretty small and waiting is a little awkward as there are lots of people crowded usually, but its definitely worth it! And if you like craft beers, you will love their selection. Some even come with a free glass!"}
{"text":"Wow! What a great selection of beer and food! I spent the evening here sampling both and was not dissappointed with any of the selections I tried. I finally ended up with a local sour and the Gnocchi and it was delicious! I was seated at the bar and the service was attentive, but not overly so. I'll be back here the next time I'm in Cleveland."}
{"text":"This place is a great bar. Nice selection of beer and the customer service is great. I went to this place on a first date for drinks and just a relaxed environment. We both loved it and definitely went back!"}
{"text":"Went here with my wife for my birthday as a surprise - since we're new to town and I love beer, she thought it would be a great option. As a beer place, it certainly was. For the food? Not at all. 

Pros:
- The beer selection. 100+ bottles, 30ish taps, and even a couple cask beers.
- Our server, though new, was quite friendly and knowledgeable about the beer menu. She explained a couple beers to me that I wasn't familiar with, as well as their options for tasting glasses.
- Great patio. I could certainly see sitting outside for a beer or 3.

Cons:
- The food was terrible. I had the meatloaf, and it was essentially 3 hockey pucks, canned gravy, corn that was too oily, plus some pretty decent rosemary potatoes. I was not at all impressed, and should have asked for a refund. It was terrible.

Overall, the beer selection is great, but I can't recommend the food. Mine was terrible and my wife's was slightly better - I'd say save your stomach and eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"Good food with some solid deals & great beer selection, but I was very disappointed after sampling several of their beers."}
{"text":"Made me fall in love with Cleveland all over again!

Out here on the West Coast, there are a handful of places where you can get fancy beers, but most of them are named after Trappist monks and done over in dark wood. (Not that there's anything wrong with that!) But Buckeye's beer selection is second to none, and they up the ante by pairing it not with a giant pretzel and imported mustard, but with the Fatty Melt, a hamburger with grilled cheese sandwiches used for buns. Deee-licious. I was going to give this place just four stars because their shoestring fries were merely okay, but they sold me Pannepot to go, in a paper bag -- like it was Miller Light! One million stars."}
{"text":"Here's the problem with this place...

there is no doubt that they have an excellent beer selection...
there is no doubt that the food is very good...

SO, WHAT is the PROBLEM with the SERVICE?!?

We've been in the Beer Engine probably 4 or 5 times over the summer and it's ALWAYS the same story with the service/servers. It has occured to us that being over 30, we may not be part of the cherished demographic here...

I don't know...perplexes me really...
if this place could get things together in the front of the house, they'd have a really good thing going. The way it is now, no need to bother even going. There are too many places to get the same quality, but with excellent service too.

Try the Brew Kettle - excellent all around!"}
{"text":"Awesome little joint!  Great food and great beer, and I've always had outstanding, friendly bartenders.  This place has become a must stop whenever I am traveling to or through Cleveland.

The food has always been great.  The fatty melt (a half pound burger nestled in between two grilled cheese sandwiches is a fatty, calorie loaded train to deliciousness.  The andouille sausage bites are really good.  They always have a burger of the month and a wildly improbable burger of the month.  Last time I was there, the burger of the month was the \"Red Rum\": a half pound burger with cottage ham and rum raisin sauce, and the wildy improbable burger was the Stroganoff: a half pound burger with pot roast, gravy, grilled onions, grilled mushrooms and sour cream served on a hoagie bun.  I, of course, opted for the stroganoff.  It was ridiculously good.

The beer selection is always interesting, and they also sell bottles for consuming on premises or for takeout.  Buckeye beers are always interesting, and they choose their other selections wisely.  Almost always some good Bell's and Founder's on tap, among other notables, such as Hoppin' Frog and Thirsty Dog.  Last time I was there, I was able to get a growler of Bourbon Barrel Aged Thirsty Dog Siberian Night! Awesome!  But it was almost too good...shared it with some friends and got stupid...wait, I mean stupider..."}
{"text":"Consistently good food. I love how the service staff works as a team here. The beer list is a bit overwhelming for me, but I love learning a little bit more about beer every time I come in. Try one of their incredible burgers! The ham and cheese melt on a pretzel roll is also to die for!

Negative: They could use another ladies room. 
Positive: They have a patio!"}
{"text":"Great bar food and good vegetarian options but limited to no vegan good unless you want fries. Amazing beer selection obviously! Service can be really slow unless you go earlier in the day. Try to grab a bar stool and you'll be just fine. Their burger offerings and German specials are their best menu items."}
{"text":"Definitely a fan! Great beer selection and outdoor seating. We only had appetizers and I wish they had more options that were healthy. Their appetizers list is mostly fried and/or breaded. It's a hard to make \"healthy\" choices here but their food is good. Use this as your \"cheat day\" and you will enjoy every minute of their delicious food and beers."}
{"text":"I love this place. They have a good selection of beers and the food is something I will keep going back for. I've had two different meals here, and they both make me want to go back to try something else. The place is clean and the servers are friendly. Classy enough to bring your parents to, casual enough to bring a group for drinking. 

They will let you taste any of the beers that you are thinking about getting, just ask the server for a sample (or a couple). I've seen a few beers here that I haven't seen anywhere else, so I always try to go out of my way to try one of those. I had the Victory Hop Devil and loved it. It's really a great summer IPA. 

I have gotten the pierogies twice and they are fantastic. Definitely get this appetizer when you get a chance. The first time I had the BBQ beef brisket and it was delicious. The BBQ sauce, crispy onions, and tender meat were perfect together. The second time I had the fatty melt, which is two grilled cheese sandwiches in place of bread for a burger. You can never have enough cheese. Comes some bacon and tomato.. It was my perfect hangover cure.  You can get lots of tots, fries, or chips with most of your sandwiches. 

Check out their burgers of the month! They have some wild stuff on there."}
{"text":"I have been searching for a good bar to hang out at in Lakewood for a while.  Some bars are too fratty, some are too boring, and some are just right.  The Buckeye Beer Engine is the Baby Bear to my Goldilocks.  

The interior was pretty clean: a dark bar and high tables.  There is also a lot of outdoor seating if you're into that sort of thing.  

The selection of beers was great.  The Beer Engine's own brews were okay, but the one I had was nothing to write Yelp about.  Still impressive though.

The bar food is just perfect for someone who had a few beers.  Beef egg rolls?  Yes please.  Fried everything?  I think so.  It's the perfect food for a midnight beer snack.

I think I am going to find myself at the Buckeye Beer Engine many times in the future."}
{"text":"This place has all the potential -- great beer, great location, a menu with everything you could possibly want -- but the service is questionable. We have been there a couple times when no one attended to us for 15-20 min, even after talking to servers who passed by.

I'd recommend sitting at the bar (unless it's a beautiful day out) getting one of their brews and burger."}
{"text":"Great Food, the fatty melt rules, awesome beer and the owner is really cool too"}
{"text":"The selection here is INSANE. Just the selection of beer around the world gives it four stars.

I was pretty stuffed by the time we hit this stop in our west side mini-tour (even after walking around the Rocky River metropark), but still wanted some type of sandwich. It was pretty packed in here on a Sunday afternoon.... which is always a good thing.

My friend ordered 2 drinks that I don't remember....I got a pear cider. Way too sweet to my liking, but it was good to try, nonetheless. I got the mushroom burger..which wasn't the greatest. I looked around though- and the food looked pretty amazing. Next time I'll try one of those burgers with the egg. haha. 

It's pretty funny too- inside they have tvs with non-stop man vs. food episodes. Guess they're pretty proud, eh? Well, they should be."}
{"text":"Great beer selection (obviously) and I've liked most everything I've tried, for the most part. The reason I don't give it 5 stars is because sometimes the service leaves something to be desired. The house made chips usually make up for it though :)"}
{"text":"Fun, beer-filled bar! Although I would probably prefer the greasy burgers to cure the hangover I'm working on, rather than create a brick in my stomach that night, it's still a great place to get your grub on. Pretty much anything is fried on the menu: pickles, mushrooms, macaroni and cheese and the list of beers is countless. YUM ALERT: sample stack of beer that lets you try a few of the listed beers before you buy. Ready for a challenge? how about a liter of beer in a boot? Either way you'll keep warm these upcoming Cleveland winter months."}
{"text":"I'd like to start off by saying that I'm not one for the typical bar scene. Once I discovered Buckeye Beer Engine I knew I found my new favorite bar. I actually enjoy the staff in a bar for once. Normally the people employed in a bar simply blend into the background, not at BBE. Jeff has to be one of the best bartenders in the area. He's very knowledgeable about my obscure tastes in booze (I'm your typical high brow beer snob) and he never lets my glass get empty. If this is your first time at BBE make sure to grab a Lakewood Lemonade with a burger from their Burgers of the Month, I've never been steered wrong. Gotta love this place."}
{"text":"\"The Devil Made Me Do It\" burger is a must try.  Great idea to have their beer list on a TV.  Large selection of beers too."}
{"text":"Great food, great beer, and a great atmosphere overall! I feel confident meeting coworkers for happy hour, going out with friends, or bringing my parents for lunch on a Saturday. One of the best choices in Lakewood for an overall great experience!"}
{"text":"Came in for the Cleveland Cavaliers game, but you had on 80's music instead of the game. Several people we're complaining, but no one would change it over, so we left. If you're  a bar with game on play the game not crap music! This was during the play off no less! Worst bar to watch a game...."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I used to go to the Beer Engine once a week for some great beer and good food. That has dwindled down to maybe twice a month. We are regulars so you'd think they would say hey and chat for a minute, no. Couldn't care less. We are good people, we always tip well and are laid back. Recently we had gone in and had a few beers and between the two of us we got four tastes, bartender informed us that we exceeded our limit and he had to charge us for a sample. Seriously? we spend like 75$ every time we are there! Last night we went for a beer during the last 30 minutes of the Cavs game. Big mistake. I'm pretty much done with that place. Our money isn't gonna impact that place too much, but we used to love that place. It's gone down in the last two years. Every time I give that place a chance I'm more disappointed."}
{"text":"I LOVE Mondays.  Nobody is out anywhere and I get the best service ever.  We were 2/10 people at the bar with two friendly bartenders.  We got dinner and a couple of different beers each and a break from the cold.  We've been meaning to come for a while, however there's ALWAYS some sort of sporting event going on where the place is PACKED.  Again, thank you Mondays in February.  

I'm not getting into the beer snobbery of this place because I'm nowhere near a beer connoisseur and will pretty much be satisfied with any beer.  So, read everyone else's reviews for that.  

I ordered the brat on pretzel bun which was delicious.  Fries were good, and handcut, which is like the hottest trend, right?  They're EVERYwhere.  (or is 'frites' the proper term these days?) I'm actually getting a big bored with them, to be quite honest.  Either way, I was happy with the meal and comfy bar. 

Three stars cause it was the only time I could fit in the bar out of 5 tries.  That's annoying, but I suppose good for their business.  (Stop advertising so much until you expand.)"}
{"text":"You haven't lived until you try the Hippie burger. It is phenomenal! The kitchen really understands medium rare and I love it. It has everything a carnivore wants and needs. It has bacon. Enough said. And it has this amazing blue cheese slaw that is just to die for. The draft selection is excellent."}
{"text":"Fantastic place for Sunday brunch. Try Phoebe's Southwestern Chicken & Waffles. A very weird combination that I never thought I would have in my lifetime, but it works extremely well. The crowd was manageable & comfortable. The servers were friendly, including Phoebe & Renee. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"BBE is rapidly becoming my favorite place to eat in Lakewood, mostly because of the monthly Wildly Improbable burger specials which throw culinary caution to the wind. 

The most recent of these was the Soul Burger which consisted of a 1/2 pound cheeseburger served on a \"bun\" made of two slices of fried macaroni and cheese.  You read that right.  It was amazing!

Others have included- 
The Caddyshack- a Burger, Hot Dog, Fries, and Onion ring on a pretzel bun.

The Big Kahuna - A burger, ham steak, pineapple and BBQ sauce on a Hawaiian roll.

The O'Fatty Melt- a burger served between two grilled Ruebens.

The list goes on.  A lot of people ask \"How do you even eat that?\" I spoke with the chef and he told me he just comes up with it, you have to figure the rest out yourself.   Right on!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love this place, mainly for the beers. This is the perfect place on a hot summer day to try tasty brews and sit on their patio. The food is above-average bar food. The service is excellent and the staff are friendly. The only problem I have is that I wish dogs were allowed on the patio. You have to keep them on the outside of the fence which we really don't like."}
{"text":"Decent food and good beer, but you can hardly breath in here. The air conditioning must be broken or something and it feels about 100 degrees inside.  They weren't serving on the patio for some reason, which was cooler than inside."}
{"text":"I first went to the beer engine almost exactly 7 years ago for my first legal drink. I have loved that place ever since. Obviously their beer selection is ridiculously awesome bur so is their food. Over the years I have probably had everything on that menu and really have no complaints. The Cajun chicken spinach salad is my favorite followed closely by the goat cheese and mushroom salad. The sausage bites are almost god-like and the hummus is awesome. Pretty much all of the sandwiches and burgers rule (fried bologna dudes). So as you can gather,  I'm saying pretty much the entire menu is great. Sundays, they have brunch.  Super awesome cinnamon rolls and a build your own bloody mary bar. 
The atmosphere is awesome. While it can be very busy, it never seems chaotic. The staff has a handle on everything and never seem to be weeded. They are helpful,  knowledgeable, nice, and seem like all together rad people. Jeffery and Kat have waited on me multiple times and have have just been awesome! In conclusion, I'm so happy to have such a great place around the corner from my house. I'll totally keep coming back for years to come."}
{"text":"Service improved a ton over the past few years, and this place is a stop of mine every time I'm in Cleveland - it's become a holiday tradition with my family even, as they're open on Christmas. The food and beer selections have always been superb, and I'm pleased that the service has stepped up to match. The marsala burger is still a favorite, and sitting on the patio when weather permits is always a good choice."}
{"text":"We thought we would like this place because of the beer (which we do!!  Lots of stuff on tap including 6 or 8 beers of their own), but the food knocked us off our feet.  Really really good food for pub fare.

I highly recommend the meatloaf - it is a giant portion and very tasty... it's not your mother's meatloaf!"}
{"text":"Buckeye Beer Engine is my favorite burger joint in Lakewood! Every time we go we get a great burger (I prefer mine medium well and is always perfectly juicy) and their shoestring fries are like no other. My girlfriend and I typically let the bartender or server choose a good cider for us and they have never let us down. Service is typically quick, and when it is slower than normal the servers are apologetic so there is never a real problem. Highly recommend! (See photo of GF with giant bacon cheeseburger)"}
{"text":"Saw the great reviews and used it as an alternate for Melt and with a 90 minute wait at Melt, we ended up here.  Me, hubby and cousin.  Cousin got a salad and the hubby and I got the Cheddar Ale soup for starters because it was freezing with the wind gusts today.  The soup was okay but I was expecting a lot better given the description.  A little thin and runny but still tasty.  I got the '76 Burger (basically bacon cheeseburger) with onion rings and the boys got the Fatty Melt (a burger between 2 grilled cheese sandwiches) with shoestrings fries just because it sounded so ludicrous .

The 76 Burger was average at best.  There was no seasoning in the burger at all, not even salt and pepper and it was really greasy (or juicy depending on your definition).  The size was pretty big but it was the lack of taste that made me stop eating the last quarter of it.  The onion rings were decent though.  The guys seemed to like the Fatty Melt. The hubby finished his and the cousin stopped 3/4 of the way through because he said by the time he got to the end it looked like an accident because it had fallen apart.  The hubby's was cooked medium and was so bloody it squirt out all over his shirt on the first bite.  So beware if you like it a little on the \"juicier\" side.  (Maybe cut it in half first?)  All of us agreed the shoestring fries weren't worth an upcharge and pretty bad.  (Steak and Shake's are better and we're not big S&S fans)  They should've had more than one waitress (bartender actually) in charge of one side of the restaurant.  She was stretched a little thin.  It wasn't a bad meal, just not one that any of us said we'd ever come back for."}
{"text":"We visit the Beer Engine once every few months and always have an enjoyable experience. 

Their monthly burger specials are definitely worth checking out, and always live up to the high expectations set by their descriptions. 

The tap rotation is excellent, and always includes a good range of different options. Take the time to read through the beer menu and check with the servers for tips. They've always had good advice to give insights about the different options."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner Saturday evening because I really wanted a burger. With the good stars and reviews from yelp I decided to try it out! For early Saturday evening the place was busy. I sat at the bar for food and drinks ! They have a long list of beers you can choose from and they are all great! They also have special burger of the month in their menu and a variety of burgers and sandwiches you can choose from. I went for their bourbon burger on a ciabatta bread and mayo on the side. I asked to try their bourbon sauce first before getting the burger and they had no problem doing that! I wasn't big fan of the bourbon sauce because it tasted like  thicker version of gravy. I personally do not like gravy ! I got everything else with it besides the bourbon sauce with a ciabatta bread and it was great! They do charge extra for everything else you do get such as my bread and if I wanted to add anything else ! I got shoestrings fries with my burger and it was delicious ! I definitely will come back because they have really good burgers, fries and some really good beers!"}
{"text":"This was a great choice for a solo business traveler. Sat at the bar and had a local belgian christmas brew - it was really good. Chatted with the bar staff who recommended the pierogies since I was in the mood. They are prepared by a local bakery in Parma so they did not disappoint. Very good pierogies!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  Absolutely love the burgers and the beer selection.  If I have someone visit from out of town, I take them here.  It can get difficult to get seating as it is normally pretty packed. We usually end up sitting at the bar. This is an enjoyable place with great food."}
{"text":"The food here is alright. Everything that I have had satisfied me. The beer list is second to none. It is a little bit heavy on the IPA selections, which is fine by me. Tonight they had some of my personal favorites all on draft, which is pretty damn good. Maharaja from Avery, Sublimely Self Righteous from Stone and Nugget Nectar from Troegs. All of these options made it hard to try something I was not familiar with. I came here back in March for my Ma Duke's birthday. We had a good time although they did not offer too many options for my vegan brother. One of the best beer lists in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Went here twice in one week, mid February of this year.

The first day was a Thursday about 10pm. Me and my girlfriend sat at the bar since it was pretty empty. (Sometimes empty is nice when you're trying a place for the first time). Huuuuuge beer list, like we spent 20 minutes trying to decide what to drink. Bar tender (sad I can't remember his name!) was super nice and attentive, saw we were struggling and made some great recommendations. Learned alot about different beers and the different glasses they're served in. Alot of their beer is actually made in their in-house brewery or from other local breweries. Prices were fair, prices range from 6-9$. Would definitely recommend for beer lovers or adventurous beer
 drinkers.

Second day was a Sunday.  Great brunch menu. I ordered the chicken and waffles. Literally some of the best fried chicken breast I've ever had, crunchy and juicy at the same time. Served with a super moist waffle warm maple syrup. A strong Mimosa topped of the entire meal. 

Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I remember the food being better. It had been a year since we've been and I remember the Thanksgiving burger being the best celebration of a holiday in burger form. I ordered the blackend burger which you would suspect to have a lot of spices in it, didn't. The burger could have settled a bit longer before applying to the bun too. It was extremely bloody when I bit into it and I had ordered it medium which means a warm pink center. This was clearly not the case. Maybe it was an off night. Who knows?"}
{"text":"The food here is typical bar food but sooooo good. Amazing beer selection. Sometimes the service is a little slow but I imagine that's because it's very busy. Everyone is super friendly. The patio is great too."}
{"text":"In honor of my new breweries list, i decided to go back to the one four blocks from my house. I really got a feel for the place now, and i'm still a bit underwhelmed. Don't get me wrong; i'm glad it's here. The patio is always alive all summer long and is probably the only reason there aren't more muggings on Tombstone, er...i mean Madison. But the decor is way shoddier than i remember. Just internet bought beer signs stapled haphazardly along the walls. The place looks like my basement, but without the charm of Simpsons action figures or dirty laundry. 

The beer: Lots of drafts, but only a few of their own. I ended up getting two Dogfish varieties: a tangy peach and a robust chicory stout. Both soothed my sore throat. Yes kids, mix dayquil and alcohol when you are sick. The others in my party ordered two house milk stouts and a St.Louis lambic. The girl who got the two 8% abv milk stouts was clearly showing signs of inebriation. Don't worry, she doesn't work for RTA.

The service: very attentive. So much so, that i felt bad about hogging a table for four and only ordering fried mushrooms and beer. She even put up with my friends' indecisiveness. This leads to the last bit...

The food: We got two orders of eggplant schnitzel. So so eggplant on buttery, but burnt rye, with swiss made for a pretty dry sandwich. I think they forgot the sauce. The onion rings were very thick like a cake donut(plus), but the buckeye chips were a bland side. The mushrooms were good too.

In all, it's a convenient way to sample beer from around the country in a laid back atmosphere....hold on, isn't that what Winking Lizard is? But with better food? I'll give Buckeye another go this summer."}
{"text":"I really love this place and have been going for years. They used to have quite a few vegetarian options but recently they changed their menu and there are a lot less which has caused me to go there less. Great beer choices....just keep your veg friends in mind. :-)"}
{"text":"This is our go to spot, so I'm probably a little biased. Beer Engine is THE shit. They definitely have the best burgers in Cleveland, it's not even a question for me. I love this place, it feels like old school Lakewood, is humble enough to be comfortable and we are always able to get a seat. I love their patio in the summer, but inside is just fine, too. This is a weird comment, but their music selection is always on point. 

Their weekend brunch and Bloody Mary bar are the cause of many of a wasted weekend. It's just so hard to stay away. My usual menu go-to is the Tuscan Burger, tots or house chips -- dipped in ranch (I don't know why, but their ranch is magical). On the weekends, I've been a fan of their new avocado toast (yes, I'm basic), but everything is always phenomenal and cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in Lakewood for food and beers.  Service is always great & the poarch rocks in the summer."}
{"text":"One of my most favorite joys of traveling is trying new restaurants in different cities. To me, restaurants are the backbone of a town's culture. So on a recent trip to Cleveland, I set out to find a restaurant that served pierogies, a Cleveland culinary icon. Turns out, most every restaurant in Cleveland serves pierogies. So now I just wanted to find a place that served Eastern European fare, and Vegetarian burgers. Enter Buckeye Beer Engine. Pierogies, potato pancakes, and black bean burgers. Game, match, set.

Mr. Beet and I ordered a few appetizers. We started with the fried pickle spears served with a wasabi-cucumber sauce. Most places that serve fried pickles serve pickle chips, but here at Buckeye Beer Engine, you get the whole spear. And they were crunchy, not at all soggy.

We also tried the potato pancakes with sour cream and applesauce. The applesauce itself was a treat, it's obvious this stuff is homemade as it was chunky. Potato pancakes, sour cream and applesauce are always a great combination.

Next up, the pierogies. While they do not make them in house, they are from a famous bakery up the street in Parma, Ohio called Rudy's Strudel. And they were delicious. Stuffed with potato and cheese and topped with grilled onions, they were also served with a side of sour cream. Sour cream is everything.

Mr. Beet ordered the black bean sliders. They were good, topped with lettuce, tomato, onions and a side the wasabi-cucumber sauce. He liked them but they were definitely more bun than burger. Not my favorite but the fries were good.

Buckeye Beer Engine is a great place on a corner in the Lakewood neighborhood just west of downtown Cleveland. Certainly worth a visit for the pickle spears and pierogies. 4 out 5 sprouts."}
{"text":"Seriously, I'm in Cleveland on business, I happen upon Beer Engine for lunch. The food was so fantastic I had to come back for dinner! How was dinner you ask? EVEN BETTER!

Cannot recommend this place enough!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to give the Buckeye Beer Engine a try for some time now, but you know how that East side-West side thing goes!  For whatever reason, I don't tend to cross the line too often!  Well, last night my husband and I grabbed our passports and headed west!   
I was worried about hitting the dinner-rush on a Friday night. As I expected, we arrived to a packed lot but there was one lone space left.  Hooray!  When we walked in we were promptly greeted and seated at the last remaining open table.  Hooray again!  Our server quickly appeared and explained the specials on the decently-sized beer list.  They have a fantastic selection!  Something for every taste!  We placed our drink and appetizer orders and continued to peruse the menu.  They have some good looking comfort food for weekly specials, such as chicken paprikash, cabbage and noodles, meat loaf, and schnitzel!  All of those looked delightfully hearty but I opted for the Chipotle Blue Burger While my husband went with their Burger of the month.  Our appetizer quickly arrived...the beer battered andouille sausage bites!  While these crispy fried round bites were quite good, they didn't completely blow me away!  Next time I'll try something else...perhaps the adobo braised beef rolls or the cheddar ale soup?  
On to the main course!  My Chipotle Blue Burger was DELISH!!! It was covered with crumbled blue cheese, chipotle ranch sauce and smoked bacon.  It was juicy and perfectly seasoned!  I would definitely recommend this one!  My husband's January Burger of the Month was the Yaxi's Relleno de Papa-a half pound burger with a the Relleno De Papa, a deep fried mashed potato dumpling filled with a beef, pepper and adobo mixture, topped with Pepper Jack cheese, sour cream, pico de gallo, chile threads, and fresh jalapeno slices. It looked incredible!  He said that mine had more flavor, though.  Interesting!  Since January's almost over it probably won't be there when you get there but I wanted to tell you about it anyway to show the variety that comes out of their kitchen!  
One thing that I absolutely must add:  their burgers are served with a fried pickle spear.  Pretty cool, no? But wait, there's more!  I love pickles!  I REALLY LOVE fried pickles!  When I took a bite of the crispy, tangy goodness what did I find?  Cream Cheese!!!!  Yes, nestled next to that pickle under the breading was cream cheese!  Genius!  
Our visit was a hit!  Incredible beer selection, fast and friendly service, delicious food, and reasonable prices!
If my papers are in order and I can travel west again, I'll definitely go back to the Buckeye Beer Engine!  You should go too!"}
{"text":"Thinkin about a great burger and even better beer to wash it down with? Take a trip to the Buckeye Beer Engine, me and my friend go there often and plan on trying everything on the menu. So far so good, everything i have had has been amazing. Burgers with pierogies, eggs, excellent fries. Try substituting your burger for chicken if you return and want the same thing , but something different at the same time. They got me hooked. BTW, be prepared to wait for a patio seat on a nice day, not to worry, sit at the bar drink an excellent beer and before u know it you're on the patio mowin down one of the best burgers you have ever put you lips on, lol! Like Frank the Tank says, \"It tastes so good when it hits your lips!\"."}
{"text":"I met a good friend here for lunch recently. Unfortunately, it was midday during a work week so none of the unique brews were slung. We only indulged with modest & refreshing iced teas. The atmosphere was old & rustic wood, pub tables surrounding a spacious bar area. The menu was extensive with so much good food to choose from.

I chose something I had not had since I was a kid -- a fried bologna sandwich!!! After ordering, the food arrived promptly and hot. OMG! The bologna wasn't cut like Oscar Meyer's at all!!  It was a good 1/3\" slab of bologna fried to a deep reddish color, topped with dijon-beer sauteed onions and served on a yummy pretzel bun!!! Absolutely delicious & perfect food fare for a micro-brew restaurant! Definitely will make a return visit to try other sandwiches -- and a brew!! :)

I LOVE Cleveland food!!! Hearty, large portions, middle European (German, Polish, Czech, Hungarian) spicy foods - and not afraid to use the word \"fried\"!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent beer selection. Great atmosphere. Food was good; nothing remarkable, but still good. Waitress was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Ninja cow stout brewed by the engine. Very good, nutty , chocolate vibe and creamy.  Bar pub feel. Waitress friendly and helpful to find something for my 5 year old to eat. Decor typical for a bar and grill in Lakewood, taps and beer displayed everywhere. Got the Tuscan burger, Charlie got the sliders with cheese. Chips made fresh at the bar. Chips tasted like the oil was used too long. Burnt oil tasting. Asked for burger to be prepped medium. Came out medium well. Expected it to come out that way since they asked how I wanted it done. Overall better than average burger but not in my top 25%. Tuscan burger with carmelized onions, red pepper and goat cheese was good combo. I would come back here."}
