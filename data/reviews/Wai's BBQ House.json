{"text":"Hidden gem in Chinatown that sells fresh & delicious Chinese style BBQ meats.  Shop is family-run and staff is very nice.  Awesome deal of $8 lunch box - choice of 2 BBQ meats (roasted pork, BBQ pork, chicken, or duck) + rice and some veggies.  They also sell the big sticky rice dumplings wrapped in lotus leaves."}
{"text":"This is a review of their rice box that includes cabbage and 2 choices of meats.  Current price is now $9 per box, still reasonable, but used to be $6 a few years ago.  And it's cash only.

The rice is not as good as before.  Texture was chewier and better in the past.  Perhaps the quality of rice was better in the past.  The bbq meat is still good, particularly their soy sauce chicken and bbq duck, in my opinion.

One complaint:  the ladies there don't chop the meat very well.  The pieces are not uniform and often not even chopped right through.  The guy (there's only one) does a much better job and is more generous with the meat quantity and presentation."}
{"text":"The BBQ meats here are tasty and a fair price, 
the nice crispy skin of the pic adds a nice texture,
the duck meat is tender and the skin is crispy,
and flavorful.

It's  a good price for the amount of meat you get in a  box,
you can select the meat you want duck/pork"}
