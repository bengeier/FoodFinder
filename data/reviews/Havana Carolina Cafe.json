{"text":"The food is awsome, the prices are good and the staff is great. Love The Cuban sandwich!"}
{"text":"Delicious little hole-in-the-wall.  Must stop when ur in Concord."}
{"text":"I grew up in Florida eating Cuban food made by people who had grown up in Cuba, so I was skeptical to eat here. My mind was quickly changed. These Cuban sandwiches are just as good as any I ever had in Florida. The price is great. The staff is friendly. It's great for dine in or carry out. Go try it!"}
{"text":"Fast, friendly, fun- but it's all about the food.  Cuban sandwich- get it, fried sweet plantains were a great side The espresso machine looks like it came direct from Cuba & makes coffee that tastes like it.  Great casual lunch or family spot, nothing fancy but the food must be the old family recipes."}
{"text":"Okay, let's begin with the pedigree... I'm a Cuban from Miami, Florida that relocated to Charlotte. I've eaten at hundreds of Cuban restaurants and know what is good and what is bad.  1. For all of you that are unsure, this is NOT good Cuban food. 2. Cuban bread is supposed to be crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside. 3. The portions (especially the black beans) were small as compared to Cuban food restaurants in Miami. 4. The mojo (Spanish bar-b-que sauce) we Cubans love was overpowering.  I'm not sure where everyone else that left a review ate, but I don't think it was at Havana Carolina Café. I suspect they are paid reviews.  I'll never go back again."}
{"text":"Best Cuban place in this area.  I recommend the media noche HIGHLY.  The owners are Cuban, have settled here in Concord, and this restaurant is their passion.  Good food and a cafe feel.  Love to eat lunch here!"}
{"text":"I am on my second trip this morning to Havana Carolina Cafe and I must admit, I'm totally addicted. Both times I've had the Cafe con leche and I may never be able to drink Starbucks again. the coffee is out of this world amazing. Yesterday was an empanada for breakfast and today it is a stuffed potato. Both were superb. I cannot wait to find a day to come and enjoy lunch. If breakfast is this good I'm sure lunch will be too."}
{"text":"Authentic Cuban Sandwich - I asked for no mayo, they yelled at me because a REAL cuban doesn't have mayo! I knew that!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely stellar food...I never liked pork (other than bacon and prosciutto of course!) Until I had their Cuban! It was the best combination of mustard, pickle, and succulent pork I've ever had. I'm not sure how they make their shakes but man are they flavorful! The empanadas are good if you need something fast and delicious. The decor might not be like chilli's or apple bee's but it certainly is made up with in the price and power in its menu."}
{"text":"Our Waiter sang!  Great Cuban Food! The Cuban Sandwich is very good!  The Cuban style Espresso makes me more Insane though it is nice feeling that good for hours and hours.  Our waiter may have been the owner!  Charming shop with bright yellow walls and a energetic though still laid back staff!  A Map of Cuba and another mural on the walls.  A Pastry case with the desserts meets you as you walk in and as soon as we were seated I went back to look at the treats.    We ordered Flan, Cuban Style Espresso, Sweet fried Plantains, the Cuban Sandwich (Ham and another Pork, Mustard, Swiss Cheese and Pickle on a roll, slightly pressed and warm).  They served us something neither of us had tasted before: Chopped Pork wrapped in Something (maybe mashed potatoes) then deep fried!  Jupina! !! !!!  This was my first!  Jupina is a Pineapple Soda, or more like Pineapple liquid Candy Special Guest posing as Soda Pop in a can!  I LOVED it!  Even wrote a song about it and will be seeking some in a few days if not by tomorrow!  Malta India, is a non-alcoholic Hopps and Molasses Soda Pop... I do NOT recommend this one."}
{"text":"I lived in Florida for 13 years and had a few Cuban sandwiches in that time.  Based on the rave reviews here I was expecting something great, but was very disappointed.  The bread was crumbly and dry, as though it had been frozen for months and then reheated.  If the bread is bad, what's the point of eating a sandwich?  I doubt I'll return.  North Carolina continues to be a gastronomic wasteland."}
{"text":"--- TEMPORARILY CLOSED. MOVING TO A NEW LOCATION. ---  I was craving a Cuban sandwich, some fried plantains, and I don't know what to drink - so I drove all the way to Concord to check out this bookmarked restaurant.  Wouldn't you know it - the place was closed, curses foiled again.   A sign on the front door said that they were moving to another location, and they would reopen, if I remember correctly, sometime around March 14th-ish. The new address is posted on their front door, but I was so disappointed by their not being open after my long drive, that I didn't make note of the new address.   I will try them again in a month or two when they have settled into their new location."}
{"text":"Yep, a fan indeed.  I met a friend for lunch at Havana Carolina.  As I pulled up, I was a little bit concerned about where I would park, since there is no parking in front of the restaurant.  Fortunately, I drove just a tiny bit further and found a free parking garage.  It was quite convenient for me.  Upon entering, I found that there were maybe 8 tables, 4 of them 2 tops.  NOT a big place.  Walls are painted with Caribbean-esque images, and fairly cheerful.  There is one unisex restroom stall, but my friend said that it was clean (as was the rest of the restaurant).    I really appreciated that the menu gave some detail about the menu items (what was included, or the English equivalent to the Spanish name).  I mean, *I* know what a Papa Relleno is, or Ropa Vieja, but not everyone will.  Just a small amount of detail could be enough for someone to try an item that is new to them.  I do wish that the server had been better able to answer my friend's request to describe the mojo marinade, however (it's a garlicky citrus marinade, btw).  Drinks are sold in bottles or cans.  They do serve Cuban coffee (cafe con leche, as well).  My friend ordered the lechon (roast pork) sandwich (5.99), and I ordered the lechon plate (7.99).  Her sandwich came on what appeared to be a fairly authentic Cuban bread (crispy on the outside) but did not include any sides.  Mine included rice and beans, as well as 3 slices of fried plantain (love these).  The pork was STELLAR.  SO tender, juicy, and flavorful.  My favorite Cuban pork EVER (don't tell my MIL, lol.  Hers is good, but this is so craveable!).  I was not overly thrilled with the beans.  The flavor was fine, but they were extraordinarily thin.  The pork was so good, however, that I will overlook the beans 100 times.  They do sell some limited bakery items (guava and cheese pastries, Cuban bread, flan, tres leches cake, etc.) although I did not sample any on this visit.  I really wanted to bring a guava pastry for my husband, but they were out.  I will most definitely return to Havana Carolina soon, and encourage you to give them a try, as well."}
{"text":"Great hidden gem!  I went here a few times in the past and let everyone know of this wonderful place.  To my disappointment, the meat portion on the sandwiches were 1/2 of what they were last time.  I guess they are struggling but should not take it out on the food portions if they want repeat business.  The picture shows more meat than what they actually do these days."}
{"text":"Must try! Living in South Florida for about 8 years and being of Cuban decent I know a true Cuban sandwich (or as my mom would say sanwishé!) When I see one!!!   I had the media noche which is a Cuban but with sweet bread and it was as close as it gets to Miami food in Charlotte. The Cuban espresso with milk (cortadito) was really good as well. Not too strong or too sweet l, just right.   I will definitely be coming back for lunch or just for a simple shot of Cuban Coffee."}
{"text":"I too grew up in Miami and I've been burned with fake Cuban places BUT this place is the real deal. The pork sandwich is so good and fresh. The Cuban bread is hot and crispy just like the Cuban bread I grew up eating in Miami. The pastelitos (Guava Pasteries) were amazing. The guy that runs the joint is so nice and a real hoot! And he bakes his own Cuban bread which is out of this world! This place is not romanti and has no ambience so I wouldn't bring a first date here but the food is too good to be in NC!"}
