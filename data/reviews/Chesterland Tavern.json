{"text":"Customer service is lacking.  We had an issue with our reservation and they really gave us the runaround.  Food is good which helped.  We had 6:30 res for 10, they gave our table away, wouldn't sit us any where else! The manager, Terri, was useless and has no business being in that position!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite local places to eat. Good food at reasonable prices. Only the second time here since they reopened. Can't wait to check the patio when the weather warms up."}
{"text":"Chesterland Tavern is a great little place to grab some food, drinks, enjoy live music! The renovated outside patio and bar area is top notch."}
{"text":"The wife and I stopped by a few nights ago to check out the Chesterland Tavern, and we thought it was pretty good.  The service was great and the food was satisfying.  I ordered the \"Pulled Pork BBQ Mac/Cheese\" and it was more than I could eat.  Very good!  The wife got a shrimp entree that she said was good.  Pleasant experience overall.  The only thing I think they need is an update to the restaurant area.  Looks a little dated to me.  Other than that, keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Very large patio, lovely trees in the spring and summer. Tasty food overall, large wings are what they are known for. Fast service and they give large portions."}
{"text":"Went there during happy hour at outside  bar. Draft beer tasted flat and watery. Vodka with splash of soda/cranberry tasted watery and like no vodka. Asked for and paid for shot of vodka added. Still very watery and weak. Appetizer flatbread was not flatbread but thick doughy and short of being burnt. Only could taste burnt cheese on top. Chicken plank appetizer was dry and overcooked Might be cheap, but was awful. Not a Happy Hour.  Too bad, nice setting but terrible food and drink"}
{"text":"Why did I go!??  Food was, you can't really screw up toasted cheese, par.  The service or lack there of, simply put, horrible.  It was just a reminder for me to suggest a different place next time.  Don't go, not even for the music."}
{"text":"I drive by here every day and finally decided to stop in after picking up the kids from school for a quick early dinner.  Food was ok, nothing special but not bad for the price.  From the kids menu we ordered pasta with Alfredo sauce as that's all the kids seem to eat when we go out.  Once the pasta came it had black pepper all over it.  Kids took a few bites and that was the end of that.  Not sure why they would put black pepper on a kids menu item but oh well.  I had a simple burger and fries which was ok.  Will give it another chance w/o the kids and try the wings."}
{"text":"The updated restaurant is great, and we were hoping the menu would follow suite. Nope. Mediocre food.... Go for a drink and maybe an appetizer, but the entrees leave much to be desired :/"}
{"text":"Decided to try Chesterland Tavern again last month.  WOW have they now changed.  We have gone back every week since.  Hats off to the chef.  FOOD is great.  Prices are great.  Bartenders are the best.  Plenty of bar sitting available.  Nice happy hour and beer selection.  Couple of food items that we have had ... mac and cheese with bbq pulled pork, chicken paprikash, meatloaf over mashed potatoes with onion rings on top, chicken carbonaro (which was a special for the night) ... and also have a great happy hour and specials every night.  Chesterland Tavern do not change anything because we love eating here!"}
{"text":"Great food, friendly, attentive service and the Beer glasses are better than most places.... just request a non-frosted glass when ordering a craft beer."}
{"text":"During the reign of the previous owner a friend and I used to come in and order 50 garlic wings for starters.  A second 50 was often ordered as the first order wound down.  The new owner has really terrible garlic sauce that is runny and oily.  I can hardly gag down a dozen. (for pretty near the same price, to boot).  Ambiance is a tad better than before, but the wings don't hold a candle to what was once here.   Buffalo Wild Wings, Winking Lizard, Cleats, Danny Boy's, Quaker Steak & Lube, and even Wing Street (Pizza Hut) have better wings.   Not open for LUNCH. Not open SUNDAY.  TWO HUGE negatives."}
{"text":"Horrible: decided i would try the\"special\" shrimp and Scallop linguini. A very bad decision. Not only were they the smallest bay scallops i have ever seen and the shrimp a very high count,  probably 30-50, but somehow they burnt the spinach leaving such a horrible taste that i still cannot vanquish. The table next to us asked what  i thought of it, as he was thinking of ordering, i warned him with the waitress overhearing what i told him.  She thanked me,  as now she knew not to recommend the \"special\". She took it off the table after i had a couple bites, and charged us fully for an uneaten meal. Cost her a high tip, leaving just a bit less than 20%. I had intended to tip the price of the meal,  oh well,  Oak and Embers is right up the street."}
{"text":"Chesterland Tavern has the best chicken wings I've ever eaten in my life. No joke. They are huge and beautifully fried. On Tuesday nights, they are $5 for a dozen. Highly highly recommend checking these wings out, especially if you're used to the little crappy wings from places like BW3's, Quaker Steak & Lube, etc."}
{"text":"Nice patio with live music on a Wednesday night.  Food was pretty good. I ordered a chicken Cobb salad and a side of Mac and cheese.  Buffalo wings were nice and spicy. Kid's pizza was judged a \"meh\" but the French fries were very good.  Service was friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Outside of building is great.  Nice landscaping.  I guess considering the outside I expected the inside to be a little better.  The hostess station is in an odd spot, opposite the entry point.  The watiress was ok, the food was ok, very bar type food.  I guess I was hoping for something a little bit different... Clean.... Just nothing to make me say I want to try that again."}
{"text":"Neat little tavern.   Our seat seating looked pretty but was too chilly for us to eat outside.   Ordered the chicken bruschetta pasta. Absolutely delicious. Great size portion. Nice amount of chicken and ingredients. Balsamic glaze was yummy and they used just enough so that it wasn't overwhelming.   Side salad was nice size.   Service was a little slow, but there seemed to be only one server working our room.   Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"After the updates of a few years back, we've given the Tavern a couple tries to get it right. We live in the area, and the options are limited if one doesn't want to drive 25 minutes or more. Sadly, on each occasion, the staff has been either disinterested, clueless or just flat out rude. Tonight we stopped in to catch a couple innings of the Indians game. It was 70ish degrees, so we thought we'd opt for the indoor bar, where there was another couple having a drink. After waiting for at least 10 minutes, husband went to find a bartender. A number of minutes later, a woman who did not identify herself came out and informed us that \"This bar is closed. If you want, you can go to the outdoor bar.\" Mind you, no apology, and no sign that the indoor bar wasn't being staffed. We moved to the outdoor bar, which is enclosed on 3 sides and smelled like an ashtray. We shouldn't have stayed, but husband had his heart set on wings. The bartender, as per previous experiences, seemed annoyed to be doing her job and was not at all friendly. We left a 15% tip, which is our minimum, but totally left with a bad taste in our mouths. The food is not bad for bar food, but come on, we don't go to such a place for culinary masterpieces. We're just looking for a place to have a drink, a snack and watch the game, It shouldn't be hard to get that right."}
{"text":"7:30 on a Tuesday night.  Fairly empty dining room filled with dirty tables.  Hostess offered to seat us at a bar hightop, or we would have to wait 5 min for a CLEAN table in the dining room. We chose to wait. After 15 minutes, approached the 4 employees that were socializing at the hostess stand.  I was treated rudely, and reminded that I HAD TO WAIT. We left.  Last time that we go there!! * not certain, but I believe it was the manager that was rude of us."}
{"text":"I have lived in the area for 15 years and this place has gone downhill. I hate to say it because it used to be one of our \"go-to\" restaurants. Every time we go it's just OK. The service is average and the food is average. Plus, they updated their menu and removed two of the best items."}
{"text":"I had several disappointing experiences here right after they reopened. Must have been several years ago now. The patio environment  is so wonderful that I decided to give them another try. On two separate occasions recently I had meals with friends there and was very impressed. The menu is varied and much improved. All of our entrees were excellent. The salads were Very good also. If you haven't been here in a while, please give it another try. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"had the Tavern Burger kept it simple to check them out. the burger was very good. the fries how ever were a bit disapointing when they were served to me. They were shoe string fries. i was expecting hand cut fries or steak fries or something like that. the fries were good as shoe string fries go. The service was good. they are not open for lunch. would i go back? sure if someone wanted to go there to check it out. or the just wanted to go there."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out. Nice warm atmosphere. Good food. My entire community goes there. Its where you can go and be at home at the same time."}
{"text":"I've driven by this place so many times I can't even begin to count. We finally decided to try it and had no idea that they had this awesome patio and outside bar. We were hooked right away. Great atmosphere, Great service, fantastic food with plenty of choices. Outstanding. This is a must go place."}
{"text":"Awesome place! The patio is excellent and the bar is beautiful. Great food and really good service! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We have visited Chesterland Tavern on approximately 10 occasions. Most of the time on the patio, which is fantastic. However last night 6 of us ate inside (patio closed) and we probably had one of our worst experiences at any area restaurant. Our salads and soups were delivered and before we could put dressing on our salads our entrees were delivered. We said we would like a chance to eat our salads. They returned them to the kitchen. When they were returned they were cold. Mine was retuned to the kitchen and I agreed to have it \"nuked\" and it still wasn't even warm. They offered to remake and I agreed. The finished product was delicious but I was eating alone. We called the very rude manager to the table and he blamed everything on a \"new\" server. Hey manager you are in charge of the kitchen and training. He offered to buy the table a round of drinks which we accepted, but we had all just ordered a drink and instead of just comping those they brought another round, consequently a warm beer.   Evidently a new manager who needs some training."}
{"text":"I had to update my review and drop a star for primarily two reasons. One: the food quality has been inconsistent. We have had some really improperly seasoned food, mostly over salted. Easy fix, but it has happened more than once. And Two: they can't poor a decent beer. It tastes like they mix the tap lines with different beers or don't clean the lines properly. OR there is residual soap on the glasses. Either way, no matter what I order my beer doesn't taste like it should, and it just doesn't taste good."}
{"text":"I went here 2-3 times last year, don't remember anything significant [good or bad]. I play in an ultimate league nearby and we occasionally go here after the games. Experienced teammates who has stopped by the chesterland over the past 10 years said they've gone through 5-6 owners in that time.   During my first and only visit so far this year almost a month ago, about 15-20 of us showed up around 8:45, very thirsty and hungry. The patio, which is very nice, does not bring back memories of a typical sterile, suburban patio. Probably built long before the smoking ban, the patio is large, with over a dozen tables, amid mature trees [and shade] with trellises[SP?], secluded from the main building and relatively quiet back there.   Our server was friendly although ostensibly, he was newly hired. We've ordered pitchers in the past, and our server said they didn't do pitchers there. Fortunately, one of my teammates, a regular there, informed the bartender at the patio bar of our scenario. Pitchers, arrived, one by one, several minutes later. In response to our asking whether they had any IPAs, the server was unfamilar with the term. I felt a tad sorry for the chap [And I was in a good mood that night, from our studly 20-7 win !], since he was suddenly slammed, and only had an older couple and their dog on the patio before we arrived.   We also asked for a couple pitchers of water and waited about 10 minutes to get waters.  After waiting for 10 minutes or so, I went inside, saw the place was at least 75% capacity. I asked for a pitcher of water, and tons of cups. As I waited, I was making small talk with the lady next to me, whom I later found out was the owner [Luckily, I was pretty diplomatic stating that our server was inept and overburdened. She immediately went to the kitchen and turned things around. They dispatched 2 extra servers for us, and our service improved as the night wore on and the owner came out and apologized for the scenario and the things they were out of [pulled pork and Great Lakes], as they had been slammed Memorial Day weekend and didn't have things back in stock yet.  The menu is of a typical tavern. The fish sandwich, breaded, but not very oily, hit the spot after the game. Fish sandwiches, as my teammate said, they're hard to be very good although hard to be bad. I concur, and this was on the better side [less than $10] for the less oiliness and came with a small cup of pasta salad.   Despite our mediocre service on this last visit, I'd go here again if I found myself in the area, definitely for the patio, and relative reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Went here the first week we moved to the east side and I am so glad that we did. The food was decent and they had a large selection of drinks, but the atmosphere is what I love the most. It truly feels like your local tavern. Filled with Familiar faces where everyone is saying hi or hi-five G during a game you are watching on one of the (feels like) thousands of TVs. It also has a great patio that is so nice in the summer that makes you forget you are in chesterland Ohio. But it's not just good in the summer, it feels like a winter lodge in the winter with tons of snow piled around and everytime of beer hidden inside to make you forget about the freezing temperatures. I really do enjoy this place and can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"So we're out here visiting our son. We drove all the way from California! Decided to try the chesterland tavern. They have a hamburger topped with pulled pork that is off the charts. French fries were hot and crunchy with a tender center. I didn't ask but they seemed to be twice fried, best way to do fries! Service was top notch. Place was clean and smelled good. Hard to do when you have a big bar in the room. No old beer smell! So go and enjoy."}
{"text":"I haven't eaten here since I worked here two years ago. I'm home visiting and decided to stop in to see if the food was as good as it use to be and was not disappointed! The spinach artichoke dip is still my favorite, along with the buff chicken wrap and margarita flatbread. I highly recommend the french fries and mac n cheese too. The bartenders are great and the food always comes out hot. I definitely over eat, but the leftovers are always good for later. It does get packed on weekends and around dinner time, but worth it for the live music just understand that the food will take longer. I like going when it's quiet around 3-5! Overall, great food and great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I, once again, struggled between 3 and 4 stars.  As Max stated the wings are fantastic.  I've also tried the pizza and the french onion soup.  The soup was 4 star and the pizza was 3.  Given that Chesterland is really limited on bar / restaurant options, I could see myself making this my weekly hang-out.  They really do care about their food quality and making your experience enjoyable.  Good place to watch the game or if you wanted to hide from the wife for a while.  If it was just a little closer to SOM then I could see myself bringing friends and family to the Chesterland, but until then, I will make it my usual stop when I decide to take a drive, which turns out to be about 3-4 times a year.   Really friendly place so do yourself a favor and stop in."}
{"text":"We were excited to try this restaurant as they're aren't many choices in the area. They actually stopped taking/submitting food orders (including ours) for a while as the kitchen was backed up. This is about 6pm on a Saturday night. We waited over 1.5 hours for our food and then my order was wrong. Twice! The waitress also would take our empty soda glass and never bring another drink. We asked for water or soda repeatedly and she never brought another beverage to the table. I finally told them don't bother to try to bring the correct food dish and they removed it from our bill. They should have offered to comp the entire meal. We will not return."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Great drinks, good food, and better service. Bartenders will make anything you request. This is a hidden gem."}
{"text":"I went to the Chesterland Tavern to sit at their nice Indoor air conditioned bar to have dinner and watch The baseball game.  I arrived at 8:20 P M.  I was told that I would have to sit at their \"outdoor\" bar. This space is enclosed on three sides with one side open. As soon as I ordered food every one around me lit up cigarettes.  I felt like I was in the 90's when you need to have your clothes dry cleaned after eating. I am very surprised smoking is allowed in such an enclosed space. Needless to say this was not a good experience.   Service was good, food was a salt mine, but making customers eat in a smoke filled room deserves at best a one rating."}
{"text":"I agree with another reviewer; kinda wish there was a 3 and a half stars. But I've only been there once, and I am planning on going back, so 4 stars is the winner for now. I really liked their friendliness, and casualness, while receiving good service. I also love that they have liver and onions and stuffed cabbage on the menu. Reminds me of my mom's cookings. The menu is pretty good but the food quality was pretty mediocre. Still, I really enjoyed the atmosphere and a place that makes me want to come back is worth 4 stars in my book."}
{"text":"A spontaneous suburban Saturday night landed us way out east of Cleveland at Chesterland Tavern -- and we were pleasantly surprised!!    Upon our arrival we saw a well-designed, casual, inviting patio space in the back.   There was a live band rocking the sun to set, and ages ranging from 22 to 72.    My wife and I were impressed with the selections and options on the menu.   A broad variety all of which sounded delectable.  Food was great;  staff were friendly and personable but not overly involved in your meal.  And the venue was clean, well-attended, and comfortable."}
{"text":"One of our favorite neighborhood spots! The lemon drop martini is easily the best I've ever had and the margherita flatbread is awesome! Great spot for a happy hour with friends!"}
{"text":"I have been to Chesterland Tavern twice, and I want to like it more.  The bar is fun (especially the back bar/patio area).  The first visit I had the pizza flatbread that was completely burned on the bottom.  Try number 2 was made with the wrong toppings.  I decided to hold off on try number 3.    My next visit I tried the fish and chips.  I love coleslaw, so I made sure I got that on the side.  I have never tasted huge chunks of onion in Cole Slaw before, but I have now.  And WOW is it terrible.  Overpowering everything in the slaw.  Not good.  Fish was \"ok\" but nothing special or flavorful about it.  I'll come back - just not to eat."}
