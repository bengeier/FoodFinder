{"text":"I am still very confused at how I am now at pho nho. I am now getting tasty things. Hurrah!

I went to phoenix as it is a stat holiday and everything was closed but I was coming down college and saw the open sign. I yelped it and it was good in my books :)

I got the hue style beef and pork pho and the fresh rolls. 

The fresh rolls sucked, they had a weird curry like noodle that was crumbly in it. Almost rice like but then a massive hoard of lettuce that filled it. I ate half of one and decided it just maybe wasnt my thing. 

I got the pho and had a few sips with noodles and could barely eat another bite. It was so insanely spicy I thought I should ask to maybe have some broth poured in to even things out a bit. The guy beside me noticed me not eating and asked if it was too spicy. I said ya! Its crazy! And he said oh ya sometimes they do too many chili peppers, dont worry theyll take care of ya! So I was like great, thank you kind eavesdropping sir :) 

I decided to bring up the bowl as nobody was around for awhile. The guy grabbed the bowl and I started to explain that it was very overly spicy and I couldnt quite keep eating it as it was. I asked if he could add a bit of broth or if I could change soups. His phone rang and he handed the soup off. He talked on the phone for 5 mins and once he got off didnt say anything to me still standing there. 
I asked him \"oh, hi, helllooo...yes me here...\" If I was waiting for the soup to come back. He said you dont want it wrapped up? I said no no, its too spicy to eat and explained again. He looked at me and said HA well youre paying your bill. You dont just get a free soup. I didnt once even think about this until he said it. I certainly didnt come here to get free soup. 
I looked at him very, very confused. The last thing I wanted was to remain hungry and have a back and forth with someone. I said Id be happy to pay if we could alter the soup in any way. He said no. You order it. You pay it. Literally those exact words as he pretended to read through take out orders as to not make eye contact. 

So I paid. He started muttering in what I suppose is vietnamese and the server came over and his hands went up and they spoke back and forth as he fumbled around for my change. 

My god I've never felt so belittled and stupid for trying to figure out a solution to something that certainly is not very hard. I wasnt mad or even looking to not accommodate their needs as a business. 

I went to say bye to the guy who had spoke to me earlier, who heard this all, and he just put his hands up and said oh miss, im sorry thats not right. 

He was one of the most awful people ive met and one of the worst TO restaurant experiences ive had. I hope the 15$ he got from me makes him very, very entitled and pleased. 

Now thank goodness pho nho is open and im re doing the exact order I just had but with awesome service, amazing food and a warm atmosphere. Happiness. 

Please please dont give awful people your business. Pho ling across the street (if proximity is your thing) is the top notch option.

{"text":"Sad when you're in biz, and right across the street, the same fare resto is packed while yours has two tables filled.

Yes, I was in the neb to try out Pho Linh, forgot cash, but still in the mood for pho, jaunted across to the Phoenix, ya know, if I ever open a pho place it's gonna be called Pho Kyu (Viet with Japanese influence from the Kyushu prefecture, ok the latter is bull, unless I offer a salmon shake).  Once that takes off, open up a branch in Mtl called Phoque Moi, specializing in seal.  (Did I, did I go too far?  I would never eat seal, well, I wouldn't unless I was the Governor General and it was offered raw.)

Pho is pho, right?  How badly can it go?  It didn't.  

SOUP

It's got kick, I wanna drink it, it tastes too \"delicious\" which translates as msg-infused.  

NOODLES

A bit hard.

MEAT

Got med rare, fatty meat and balls.  Ahhh, ok, I guess.

VEG SPRING ROLLS

Odd, mushy, glad they p-toweled the heck out of it, what did they do? microwave it?  Ahh they prob did ... that's why it came so fast.  Lazy, lazy.  OK, let's not be quick to judge, if these rolls had been deep-fried, then the deep-frying process left them soft and mushy in the centre.

MANGO SHAKE

It's all sugar ... mango syrup .. condensed milk ... nil or near nil real fruit.  Soooooo sweet.


These are the standard bearers of any viet place and by which I judge and proceed to file yay or nay.  Thumb down, way too many other phos to slurp.

I walked by Pho Linh.  Now two large groups are waiting.  Frick, Phoenix folk, why don't you get yer butts over there and figure out what Linh is doing.  Are they putting crack into the soup base?  Or did you open for business as overflow for a successful resto in the neb?"}
{"text":"Not worth the hype. Don't get tricked. This is an average pho place at best.  Not enough meat. Watery-boring broth. Tasteless."}
{"text":"Large portions, lots of variety, large sitting area, and clean. Their food quality has gone downhill: Less abundant veggies and protein, lower-quality shrimp, often frost-bitten questionable chicken. The owner is quite grumpy and the staff is not particularly friendly. 

However, their fresh rolls are delicious: Slightly warm and filled with grilled chicken. Their chicken soup, pho, and other soupy dishes are very comforting and not too salty. The broth is always very aromatic. Their rice-based dishes are LARGE and tasty. 

I really hope they re-inject some care into the quality of ingredients, as the last couple of times I have eaten here I have walked away with stomach-aches and that suspicious \"maybe I shouldn't have had that chicken...\" feeling."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely wonderful. The staff are always so accommodating and it's so close to my house. I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. 

I've been introducing my friends and family to Vietnamese food, and this one takes the cake. It's neck in neck with Golden Turtle, though more Vegetarian options exist here :)"}
{"text":"Great pho, courteous service and plenty of street parking.  We filled our stomach for $15 bucks.  My other favourite places in the neighbourhood is pho Phuong and pho Linh."}
{"text":"This place is quite a find. The service is quick and efficient. There's none of that awkward waiting for ever and ever for a server and wondering if they'll reappear. 

And the pho is a complete delight! Best I've had around here. And a small bowl (which is cheap cheap, though I can't remember the dollar amount) is more than enough to fill my belly. To be fair, my belly is quite small, but still..."}
{"text":"When I was in university I used to live on top of this restaurant... And it's just as I remembered it then (yup that deer head that scared me then, still hangs on the wall). I have yet to find another Vietnamese restaurant that makes their Vietnamese sausages sometimes called meatballs the way this place does. If you like sweet meat that's exactly what these are. I am pleasantly surprised that this place is still around. Happy it is! The owner even remembers me because common I used to live on top of it! I ate there all the time! Now the truth about their Pho, it's broth is sweet filled with different flavours it's quite great however there is quite a bit of oil in it. So I warn you if you like you broth clear without oil floating oil patches, get something else on the menu. The other thing that is great, mind you I only got them in the summer is their avocado shake, it's delicious! Glad this place is still around and I will always go there when I'm in the area, worth the hassle of finding street parking!"}
{"text":"their lemon grass tofu is so good I want it every night for dinner, it's that fantastic!"}
{"text":"Plats copieux, authentiques avec un menu très fourni. Ce restaurant vietnamien familial est essentiellement fréquenté par les habitants du quartier ou ceux de passage le long de College Street. Bon rapport qualité prix."}
{"text":"This is some of the best pho in the city. Staff are also crazy friendly... and they are licensed!"}
{"text":"I was never a huge fan of Vietnamese food, but this place changed my mind. I'm a vegan, and was happy to find many options for me! Yes, asian food places tend to be good that way, but at least a whole page of the menu was dedicated to vegetarian dishes. 

My favourite dish is the stir-fried rice noodles with deep-fried tofu and vegetables. (you usually get onions, peppers, carrots, cabbage, and bokchoy) YUM!"}
{"text":"The pho was PHOnomenal. This is how the conversation with the server went:

Server: Hello, how are you?
Me: I'm great! How are you?
Server: *pauses* I'm.... so-so.
Me: Aw :(
Server: :(

But he took my order and brought it quickly and it was amazing. I ordered the usual ph bò (beef pho) and the deep fried spring rolls (heavenlyyyy)."}
{"text":"I had the vermicelli with grilled pork and spring roll ($8).  It was ok.  Next time I will get the grilled chicken.  The pork was a little fatty and chewy for my taste.  And the spring roll was oily.  It had mushroom I think in it.  

I also had the grilled chicken cold roll ($5 for 2 rolls) which I liked a lot better and would order again.  

Place is spacious and run down.  Just strip mall decor, but pretty clean.  They have two TVs.  They were watching the soccer game while I was there."}
{"text":"I don't normally carry cash on me so Linh across the street wasn't an option today. Though this place is better so I'm not disappointed. Vietnamese is in my top 3 favourite foods. I've been to quite a few restaurants across Toronto. I would say this restaurant is one of the top 5 for me. Great portion sizes and they don't skimp on the meat. 
Service was quick and courteous. 
Really tasty fresh rolls that were just stuff to the brim with fresh ingredients. I ordered a vermicelli grilled beef & meatball dish. I think I'll order a dish with one type of meat next time since they give good portions of it. 

Lots of vegetarian options which is cool too."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for years.. always thought it was mediocre until today. With a new menu and prices comes better service and fresher food! Phoenix has really stepped up their game. There are quite a few pho places in the neighbourhood and this one definitely wins! It's never busy (even at peak time for some reason) and if you go around sunset, there is the best view! Lovely lovely lovely."}
{"text":"Our go to place in the neighbourhood. Friendly & efficient service...food is always hot and fresh and the portions are generous. Nice big clean space and good prices.  Their menu is extensive and I have enjoyed everything I've tried so far. Not a vegetarian but I love their vegetarian options and find myself ordering those more often."}
{"text":"We live fairly close to here and have been frequent customers.
I get that Pho linh is considered superior but I'm veggie and I've got 0 options there. I'm fine settling with middle of the road veggie broth pho and v average congee. 

Honestly it has been great sometimes. lots of fresh herbs and veggies in a really clean tasting broth. other times...

-half a pepper mill dumped over the top?? owner refuses to change anything. I do my best to scoop most of it off.
-different toppings, different days. occasionally no tofu as advertised. broth also tastes different day to day.
-owner closes whenever he wants. we came in with an hour before close... nono. can't serve, closing soon goodbye goodbye. *restaurant has 6 tables of people eating/being served*... another time the restaurant was just dark 1.5hrs before close.

Like, I'm just kinda fed up? I don't know, it's just not worth it anymore lol.
I feel like I'm playing viet roulette."}
{"text":"My absolute favourite spot in the city for pho, hands down! Service is super fast and efficient, with no BS. I usually order the rare beef/fatty beef pho, and it never fails to satisfy. The broth is rich and tasty, and the beef is of good quality, nice and fresh. 

Also, I saw that someone said it's cash only. This is false, they take cards as well."}
{"text":"Simple Vietnamese place with great food. I live in Little Portugal and really believe this is the best Vietnamese restaurant in the west end. 

Their deep fried vegetarian spring rolls are one of the best in the city, in my opinion. 
I also regularly order the lemongrass tofu.
Good vegetarian options.

I once made the mistake of going to Pho Lin across the street - never again! Pho Phoenix is the real winner on the street."}
{"text":"This place is great. I'll be honest, I don't understand 90% of the menu - I always have my wife select for me - but have loved every dish I've had. especially the pho and cold spring rolls - I've read reviews about the owner not being very friendly - but he's always awesome when I'm there. Very chatty, seems happy to me!"}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I've been here... Place still looks the same and the pho is still great.    The service is quick albeit a bit too eager to get your order I think.

The vegetarian spring rolls are really good.  They use rice wrapper rolls and they come out flaky and explode into crispy shards of crunchy goodness when you take that first bite.  Yum....   Be careful vegetarians as I did find a chunk of meat in my roll."}
{"text":"After being sorely disappointed with Pho Linh across the street, I came upon Pho Phoenix and decided to give it a shot.

The spring rolls were fantastic. Absolute best spring rolls I've ever had. However, the soup was just OK. I had the vegetarian pho and I thought the selection of veggies was strange: celery, tomatoes, okra....where are the mushrooms and the onions?! 

That said, the space is big and bright and looks relatively clean. The bathrooms are fine. The experience was OK."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrendous! The service is poor. The restaurant is unclean. 

My husband and I came here for dinner. He ordered Bun Bao Hue and I, the Hu Tieu. The food came and there was plenty of noodles to go around with very few other contents in both dishes. On top of that, a dead fly was floating in the Bun Bao Hue. We told the manager and within two minutes the same bowl came out with pho noodle soup mixed in with Bun Bao Hue soup. 

I would NOT recommend anyone to come here. This place is awful, disgusting and needs to be shut down due to unsanitary conditions. 

If you want to go to a pho restaurant, just cross the street to Pho Linh."}
{"text":"On our way to another Pho place we decided to try Pho Phoenix just for some variety.

Their food, it's decent. When I walked out i looked into the kitchen to see them making something. The guy there said it was something off the menu special for Chinese New Year. He said it must be ordered days in advance. Ohhh, how elitist. But I get it, sometimes you just need time to prep and stuff.

They have a lot of tables that are relatively clean and they have tvs for you to watch sports. How better is that pho and sports?

The food came very fast, they got everything we need. Wasn't refined or anything, just what you'd expect."}
{"text":"Unfortunately a place nearby was packed, as usual..
Phoenix has better seating and a tv!
Unfortunately the pho here is average, at best.
Chicken cuts aren't great..
Same for the beef.
Also, really slow..."}
{"text":"I believe this place is called Phoenix Pho now... My friend said it was one of his top choices when it comes to pho in the city so I popped in one night and wasn't disappointed at all. I ordered the small beef bowl and it was the perfect size, and very delicious. I also ordered a cold spring roll and it was the size of a banana! I think my favourite was this grilled chicken vermicelli dish? Me and my friend split our food I was too full to finish everything. Top marks for all the dishes though!

The place itself is your standard Vietnamese atmosphere (concrete and too bright) but they have two HD televisions to watch while you eat. The service was very fast and no nonsense. I like this. I seem to recall the prices being your typical pho range. I think I ended up paying about 20 dollars (including tip) for a bowl of pho, an iced coffee, spring rolls and shared the vermicelli. Will definitely be coming back to this one. I'm hungry just thinking about it."}
{"text":"Now called Pho Phoenix.

This place is...not good... for multiple reasons

1) A small pho bo had ONE freakin slice of beef in it.WTF? 1, really?

2) Service is shite. Took 20 mins to get our bill after asking twice.

3) The first menu item I chose, they couldn't make (no wontons in stock) OK. But they couldn't make the second item I chose either. Get some bloody inventory.

Everything else was average.

There are two stellar Viet places right across the road, choose those."}
{"text":"Had never been but was a refreshing surprise when a friend brought me there about a year ago. 

First off, the broth is fantastic. It doesn't separate as the soup sits, which is a sign of high quality soup. I also like that the beef is thinly sliced and a good cut. The noodles are a perfect consistency. As far as side orders go, the grilled chicken rolls are a nice option if you want to cut back on the grease. Lots of seating. Worth going to any day. Oh, and they do debit and credit. A rarity in the pho and pan Asian food world. Bonus points ;)"}
{"text":"I cannot express how much I hate(love) this place, because I now hate(hate) every other pho place in the city.  

My girlfriend used to live in this neighborhood so we frequented Pheonix, and are now finding that we are riding our bikes out to brockton because we cannot seem to find pho that compares to that of Pho Phoenix.  Really, the pho is fantastic, you should go.  Also, this place does not chince you on the beef, and the pho is just hot enough to keep the beef rare without cooking it.  

Service is always prompt with no bullshit, the food comes quickly, and you can get up and pay near the door if you really want to get going.  

Patio seating in the summer is a must, I can usually feel my blood pressure dropping."}
{"text":"I had the fresh vegetable spring rolls and a rare beef and beef ball pho. The spring rolls weren't too bad. Didn't feel as fresh as I would have liked. The pho was ok. I liked the ratio of meat/noodles/broth which is good. Taste wise nothing to call home about."}
{"text":"So, I'm kind of obsessed with this place. If you have a hangover - it's cheap and satisfying. I always stick to the same thing - 118! It has vermicelli noodles, cabbage, carrots, lettuce, grilled chicken and a spring roll. Let me stop there; the spring rolls are enough to get me excited but combined with the food - so good! All the spices/sauces you want are on the table. 

My only gripe is sometimes the chicken is a little fatty but I can get passed that. It's fast, friendly and delicious. It's got something for everyone."}
{"text":"If I could give them a zero I would. Order vermicelli with chicken and a spring roll. The amount of vermicelli was so small - about half of what you would get at pho xelua or 88 or anywhere on spadina. They burned my spring roll black and flipped it over to hide the burnt side. It was late and we didnt want to wait in line at pho lin across the street. I had a feeling i would regret coming here. Stay away - go to pho lin or drive to spadina."}
{"text":"I enjoy this restaurant for Pho - it's proximity to my home notwithstanding - its better than most I've tried (and I've tried a few, my bf LOVES Pho). I often have trouble with Pho places as a vegetarian - I find the dishes slimy and bland tasting but here, the vegetables are big, fresh and properly cooked. The spring rolls are delicious, the noodles are yummy - everything you want in Pho. And my bf assures me as a meat eater the quality is good. And you can never complain about the price! 

Its a good size, nice windows all around, clean and efficient. Service is decent, not amazing but adequate - they take debit and credit and are open late - all bonuses! I like it here, some Pho places feel like a slightly dirty diner but I feel quite at home at the Phoenix."}
{"text":"Decent food for a decent price.

Pretty standard pho restaurant - both in terms of food and aesthetic. Definitely a better option for vegetarians compared to lots of nearby pho/Viet places. The faux pork was super delicious."}
{"text":"I work at the coworking spot next door, so Pho Phoenix is a regular lunchtime spot for me. 

The staff is always quick to welcome you with a smile.  There is always plenty of seating, which is a bonus. But the best part: the menu is quite robust and fairly cheap. Two can dine here (with apps) for under $30 and leave full. That is what I call value!

Now I may not be an expert in all things pho, but the broth is rich. The cuts of meat, tender. And the bowls, so very large. Each table is topped with lots of add-ins like sprouts, herbs, chilies and sauces to spice up your life.

My experiences have always been positive, so much so - I've started taking pals along with me. Mmm, now I'm craving pho."}
{"text":"Came here with two friends and we tried their pho and bun. 

We had the grilled beef vermicelli bun and rare beef and tripe pho. The vermicelli according to my friend was pretty good and smelled very good.  My pho was ok; the best part was the soup base. 

This place looked relatively clean and the tables were not sticky but I did see a bug on my pho which they quickly changed it for me."}
{"text":"I was more than hesitant to give \"Pho-nix\" (as it is affectionately nicknamed by someone who introduced it to me) a chance for the longest time, but seeing as how it is consistently busy and considering how large and varied the menu is, I've since become something of a regular.

Despite the numerous other Vietnamese beef noodle soup restaurants that are but a stone's throw away (and are argued to be superior by people who know their pho), there are a number of reasons why Pho Phoenix is just right sometimes. 

For starters, their \"small\" size is actually small. Hallelujah, anyone else!? I can't be the only one who doesn't want to walk out of a pho restaurant literally holding their belly after every bowl of pho. If you also enjoy pho for its warming and flavourful qualities, but don't want the guilt of wasting so much food by not being able to finish it, this small bowl's for you.

Secondly, if you're lazy or in a hurry, their wall to wall corner windows allow you to check out how many free tables (ideally, not too many, but not too few) there are and whether there is a line up without skipping a beat. The large dining area and differently sized tables accommodates everyone from solo diners to families and allows lots of buffer space if you come in earlier.

Last and strangely, one of the main reasons why I am ultimately convinced to go to Pho Phoenix so often is because they also serve Chinese food. They are the only option for congee in the immediate vicinity and have decent fried noodles. Apparently. I have grown skeptical once I arrive and defaulted with pho or bun every time, so I don't actually know.

The service can be slow when the place is packed, but it's never been horrible. Besides, the food is always worth the wait, if any. Television screens and people watching will keep you plenty occupied if you don't bring company or reading material."}
{"text":"This is that worst place to eat ...coffee lid was covered in dust and washroom was not cleaned for Days! Do not eat at here 

One star is still to much 

Go across the street for better and cleaner service aka pho Linh"}
{"text":"The place was very dirty. The lady who was serving us was very rude. We asked for water and she rolled her eyes at us. When we got the water, we saw there was a dead bug floating on it! When we got out cutlery and plates, it seemed like they just rinsed it and not washed it with soap. The cutlery I received was very dirty too! The napkin just seemed used. The food wasn't anything special. I wouldn't suggest going here. There's better pho places to go to like the one across the street or the one on dundas which are far more cleaner and have more taste in their food!"}
{"text":"3.5* 

Cash only.

Pho Phoenix (try saying it fast a few times!) gets an extra star for being one of the few places that was open on a cold and snowy Sunday night. 
The restaurant doesn't really have the cozy feel of some Vietnamese joints I've been to, but one could appreciate how clean it's kept. The menu is the typical dictionary format that includes factorial combinations of every Vietnamese food you have ever heard of!

The deep fried spring rolls were decent, though not as good as the ones I've had at Pho Pasteur. The vermicelli with ginger beef is also pretty tasty and light. 
The pho I found the most interesting; first, don't skip out on the 75 cent price jump between the small bowl and the large! The difference in size, and the amount of meat is HUGE! I'm really not sure how the math works out at this place! 
Second, the broth is different in a way that's very refreshing at first, but get's a bit overwhelming by the time you're halfway through your meal. The most likely reason for this is the rather generous amounts of cinnamon that was used at the time of my visit. This would be a good ingredient to add to your own pho halfway, but a whole bowl's worth was a bit too overpowering for me. 

Overall, Phoenix is worth a visit if you live in the area. The service is pretty decent, and the ingredients seem to be fresh! The fact that there were a few cops eating here during my visit was a pretty good sign for me as well!"}
{"text":"We used to go to Linh, but they dropped the ball pretty hard about a year ago, and Phoenix picked it up and ran with it. We LOVE coming here. The pho broth is aromatic without being overwhelming,  and the bun is possibly the best in the area. And the family who runs it are so sweet! I love, love, love them! The owner is always friendly and in a good mood, he's been teaching me about Vietnamese ingredients (it's impossible to find good nem nuong in this town!).

There are also many vegetarian options here, more than I've seen in other Vietnamese restaurants in the city, and it's great with groups, too. They take cash and debit, too!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying, if you're a vegetarian, this place has good pho for you. Ask for the Veggie broth when you order it. If you don't they'll either put beef or chicken broth with your veggies. 

I've been a few times with friends and the girlfriend and I have my choice of what type of pho I get (or don't get). The beef broth is way too salty. I can't enjoy it at all. I usually get the chicken udon as it's pretty delicious but the can skim out on the meat sometimes and the prices are a bit high for a sub-par pho place. The fresh rolls are pretty tasty and the service can be sketchy sometimes. If you eat meat, head across the street to pho linh. It's worth the wait if there is a line up."}
{"text":"Standard Pho place. If you're in the area and want Pho  I highly doubt you'll find better for cheaper. Friendly staff too."}
