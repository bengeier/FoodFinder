{"text":"I won't judge the décor, though old and dingy, I've only come to judge the quality of the service. Tasty Pizza is a greasy pizza joint located near Jane and Steeles. The food is NOT at the same level of other major pizza restaurants but I am all for supporting local/small business and so from time to time will arrange to receive food from them.   When I arrived I saw the usual sign that indicated I could get a large pepperoni for $8.99. I asked the girl at the counter if it had to be pepperoni or is it one topping. The girl informed me that it didn't have to be pepperoni. I ordered the large with half pepperoni and half pineapple & bacon. She said it wasn't going to be the regular $10 (cost of the $8.99 special after tax I suppose) and I said of course, knowing that my half with pine & bacon would make my pizza a 2 topping pizza and I would have to pay for the extra topping. Instead of telling me my price right away she walks away and starts to work on the dough and passes it on to the woman who was also behind the counter. I signaled to the girl numerous times to come back and finish ringing me in. I looked at the cash register and it read $10.37 (not sure about the exact cents but I know it said $10). Finally she returned after several people came and ordered slices and she rang me in. When she did, the price of the pizza DOUBLED. When I asked why the price doubled because of just 1 extra topping I was told that \"if I don't want it I don't have to buy it\" by the other woman who was also working behind the counter. Miffed, I still insisted on explanation. Why not just walk out and instead ask for an explanation? Well . . . If I buy a medium 2 topping pan pizza from Dominoes and add a 3rd topping, I pay for the 3rd topping and not REGULAR PRICE. And . . . If I am to pay regular price after adding the extra topping I would be able to know in advance because the \"experienced\" person at the counter would inform me that the \"special\" is one topping only and not expect me to just know after saying \"its not going to be the regular $10\" because as I said, this doesn't mean I'm not getting the special. Two, the problem would be quickly fixed because at Dominoes, I know the price before they make my order and I feel obligated to buy, this way, I am able to correct my toppings and order in line with the special. This was not the case at this store .   This pizza place has been at this location for years and its décor suggests it has been there since circa 1980 something. Nothing about this location suggests it is growing as a business and after my experience today I now know why.   Never again."}
{"text":"Fast and quick pizza. Cheap price but good quality. The service is amazing. The only thing I don't like its that they dont have the pizza slices in view, they have to go to the back to get it. I wish they had them on display so I can see what variety they have.  The pizzas are done quickly and they are delicious!  I like this place."}
