{"text":"Check it out.Simple Gourmet has Lenten Specials only offered on Fridays. I had the Veggie Tuscan which substitutes homemade hummus for chicken with greens, red peppers an balsamic dressing on a ciabatta bun. She also has Lobster Bisque but it was sold out when I got there. Finally, she has Italian Motz Salad. Unbelievable good and a great break from fish."}
{"text":"Very good sandwiches made by a personable conversationalist.  Seating is very limited.  Two stools inside and two chairs outside on the sidewalk.  It seems most clients call ahead and stop in to pick-up their orders.  Soups are seasonal and weather dependent.  Ambiance is classy."}
{"text":"First time at this little gem of a sandwich shop in Forest Hills!  Will go back as much as I can to try the different sandwiches. My first sandwich experience was the Southwest Chicken by recommendation of the ladies at the shop. It was amazing!  I will try the The Havana and the Tuscan Chicken next too. The wraps look delicious as well."}
{"text":"Amazing, fresh, quality ingredients! Warm, friendly atmosphere! Very affordable, nice portions. You can't go wrong eating here! I suggest the Tuscan chicken sandwich or a salad! Love it!"}
{"text":"Two words: Tuscan Chicken! It is amazing- fresh, quality ingredients. The owner and staff are very nice, A+ service. Highly recommend this sandwich shop. Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"When someone is extremely passionate and great at something and they take a chance at a dream awesome things can happen.....sandwiches and soup in this case.   I'm a sandwich and soup kind of guy.  And Simple Gourmet is as good as it gets.  As soon as I walked in the door it was all good.  A friendly hello and have you been here before as I pondered the large menu of salads, sandwiches, wraps and soups.  They don't take credit or debit cards which wasn't a big deal as I had some cash on me today.  I had a tuscan chicken on ciabatta.  It was just fantastic.  Fresh local bread, roasted chicken, spring mix, roasted red peppers, red onion, roasted garlic basil mayo and balsalmic......sooooo good.   I also had some kicked up tomato soup that I'm still stretching out and enjoying as I write this.....  Do yourself a huge favor and Go Here!  Great job Julie and Sandy!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches that was obviously made with heart.

I passed by this place on my way to work for a whole month and finally decided to check it out. The owner is an extremely sweet person who talks to you while she makes the food and it just makes that \"home\" feeling.

The owner told me that, \"Everything on the menu were things that I thought would work well together.\" That statement does not do justice how well all of the ingredients marry each other. With homemade sundried tomato mayo, fresh greens, and juicy tomatoes, my turkey sandwich was absolutely delicious and I destroyed it as soon as I got into my car. The portions were large and I was certainly satisfied.

It is obvious that the owner puts love into all the food she makes. I unfortunately will no longer be working nearby there, but I will definitely make the extra drive sometime to grab a delicious sandwich."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches! A welcome respite from the fast food establishments that dominate the lunch time landscape in the Forrest Hills area.  The owner is super nice and very accommodating.  I will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Great, fresh food. Nice people. Cash only, but not a big deal. Great lunch / dinner take out spot!"}
{"text":"Been here twice in one week because the owner is so nice and the food is so good. Portions are never skimped and friendly conversation every time. Will be going here twice or more a week for lunch!"}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best grilled cheese sandwich I've ever had. Super friendly staff. Will definitely be stopping here again!"}
{"text":"Can only speak of the soup and salads for now (but I plan on sampling almost everything in the near future!).  The homemade Mushroom soup was very tasty and the Mediterranean Salad was more than I expected.  I don't think they could have fit another piece of a walnut in the take out container, it was that full.  And yes, they prepare the salad in front of you, no pre-chopped greens.  The flavors were fabulous, finished off with a balsamic dressing made for a fresh delicious lunch.  The staff are extremely friendly, more like your best friends.  Looking forward to the sandwiches and wraps.  Always great to find a diamond in the rough!  Thank you."}
{"text":"Best cobb salad out there and the paninis are great also. Never been disappointed and the owner is so pleasant. I go a few times a year and she doesn't remember me by name but asks about my kids and asks how my school is going. I joined yelp just so that I could leave her a 5 star review."}
{"text":"I think I'm in love!  I couldn't leave Forest Hills without visiting my favorite Sandwich Shop.  Once again my gourmet queen was a hit! Southwestern Chicken. All I can say is if you haven't tried Simply Gourmet,  shame on you! Can't wait for my next visit.  I'll  be trying the Tuscan Chicken next, then the Havana! I love a good sandwich! And they have it!  Til next time! Smooches!"}
{"text":"A gem in Forest Hills. You can't go wrong with a panini and the soups are creative and delicious. The Tuscan Chicken and Turkey Proven√ßal are highly recommended."}
{"text":"After many lunch trips to Subway and Panera I yearned for something a little different for my noon sandwich runs.  After doing some searching online, I found this little place called Simple Gourmet and decided to give it a try.  

They have both cold sandwiches and hot paninis and there's a good selection of both here (I prefer the roast beef and swiss).  The ingredients are fresh and the sandwiches are very good.  Since the place itself is so small there is no seating inside, however there is a small table outside.  Also, the ladies that work there are total sweethearts and are very warm and welcoming.  Every time you come here you know your business is appreciated.  

The place itself is very small and definitely a \"blink and you'll miss it\" establishment due to all of the other places on Ardmore.  However, if you're looking for a good local sandwich shop for lunch and are sick of the usual chain sandwich shops, don't pass Simple Gourmet up."}
{"text":"The owner is very nice and friendly.  She goes out of her way to remember your name and what you like to eat.  

The soups are the best - unique and flavorful.  Sandwiches are delicious and easily customizable.  Very fortunate to have this little gem in Forest Hills!"}
{"text":"Great food and great owner/employees. Very welcoming atmosphere along with a very appetizing menu. Staff was very pleasant and food was prepared once my order was placed right in front of me. Very clean and professional."}
{"text":"Awesome spot for sandwiches, soup, and salads! Owner is VERY nice and friendly. Definitely will go back next time I am in the area. 

...Chicken Chili Soup is a MUST when she has it."}
{"text":"OK... I was really skeptical of the reviews of this place since they were ALL 5-star reviews. That is just fishy, right?

Wrong. Gawd. I didn't realize that standard lunch meats in between bread could be this good. I mean, there are special things like the garlic mayo, and of course the incredibly fresh and amazing bread makes a big difference, but this girl know what she is doing beyond that. The sandwiches are big, and made with care and you can't go wrong. You just can't. This place is amazing."}
{"text":"This place awakens the taste buds!  Extensive menu of salads, sandwiches, homemade soups and sweets.  Something for everyone that is made to order with really fresh ingredients.  When you're tired of everything tasting the same, give this place a try and you'll be hooked!  Call ahead about 30 minutes to place your order and it will be ready for you to buzz in and out.  I love the Cobb salad with chicken...it's huge!  The Havana panini is THE best and hopefully you can catch the broccoli cheese soup."}
{"text":"I had the most delicious Mediterranean Salad.

Contents: Roasted red peppers, blue cheese, artichoke, walnuts, and roasted, sweet onions mixed in a delicious vinaigrette on a bed of lettuce.

It was $7.50 and worth every penny."}
{"text":"Simple Gourmet is simply delicious!! I have had both the tuscan chicken and veggie sandwich. I have also had the Greek salad and it was huge! Worth every penny. The sandwiches were  delicious, especially the tuscan chicken. Next time I am trying a panini and soup, which will be perfect for this beautiful fall weather. The owner is so friendly and nice. Everything is made when you order it and it's so fresh and tasty that you can't resist going back for more."}
{"text":"I'm so sad that Julie closed her doors but I understand..  I have many memories her her shop. I moved away a few years ago and would always make a trip to visit and have something to eat. I'm so happy I was able to visit before she closed."}
{"text":"Ok this is fresher then fresh. We went late and the food started to run out. She only makes enough for the day so you know it's fresh."}
{"text":"I grabbed some sandwiches for lunch with the family for the first time last week after reading the reviews on yelp, and Simple Gourmet did not disappoint. The ladies who were working were lovely, and seemed genuinely interested in us as people, vs. just customers. The sandwiches were each delicious, and everyone was happy with their choice (Tuscan Chicken, Turkey Prov, Southwest Chicken, and the Havana). The chicken is marinated, making the sandwiches excellent instead of just very good. I highly recommend stopping in and giving them a try."}
{"text":"This place is as good as it gets. It's a little out of the way, but well worth the trip. Not only is the owner so pleasant to chat with (I also learned a lot more about Pittsburgh), but the sandwiches are absolutely fantastic (homemade made to order style). The Tuscan sandwich and Havana Panini are definitely the go-to options for here, but don't be afraid to give the daily specials a try. The Italian sandwich I had the other day was great. Generous sizes and tasty. The owner really knows how to make sandwiches with heart"}
{"text":"Excellent, large portions, and super friendly. I was passing through town and they were very pleasant. Food is fresh!
Very small, best as a to-go, and call before you come to order, they can get very busy."}
{"text":"Amazing food!  We loved it, from your Cincinnati customers :)

The owner was very accommodating to my wife who has severe food allergies.  Made her a wonderful salad.
I had the roast beef and swiss sandwich, again totally awesome food.  Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"The panini was one of the best I ever had. Would definitely go back before leaving Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Simple Gourmet is truly a gem in Forest Hills. Julie the owner is such a wonderful person and I am so glad to see her shop do so well. She is friendly and caring with everyone she meets. The food is excellent. A simple sandwich, which can't be beat in any store or restaurant. 

I enjoy talking with her as she makes the handmade sandwiches. This is a must on everyone's sandwich lovers list. 

The homemade soups are better than my grandmothers and that is saying a lot. I love the Roast Beef & Swiss. Ed's Classic Italian is to die for. I highly recommend any sandwich she offers. I am not a huge Paninis lover, but I know of others that have tired and have enjoyed. Her homemade treats are always good and yummy! 

Great food and excellent friendly conversation!  Try it, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"i am OBSESSED with this place! i was one of the 1st customers a couple of years ago and i cant stay away! the owner is SO sweet and the food is ridiculous.......im moving out of the area but i will still be going to this place weekly! lots of TLC put into it.........very fresh......just good :) she also customizes everything for my special diet and is happy to do so!"}
{"text":"Best sandwich ever. Owner is friendly and nice. A wonderful place for a relaxed lunch to go! Don't be in a rush, the owner is so amicable, she draws you in!"}
{"text":"Owner was so friendly and helped me choose which of all the amazing sounding sandwiches to get. Got the roast beef and Swiss and it was unreal. Definitely one of the sandwiches in Pittsburgh"}
{"text":"The sandwiches are as nice and warm as the owner! She makes you feel like a friend who stops by for dinner when she happens to be in the middle of cooking something reaaaaalllllly good which she invites you to have (and take home). The Tuscan Chicken is something to crave for. It was fresh, bold and well put together. Looking forward to trying more from her menu!

The little charming shop may be easy to miss but for the new and old patrons, the glare of 5 Stars definitely leads the way again and again to something worth driving for."}
{"text":"Simply Awesome. 

I don't know how many times I've driven by this place before I noticed it. It's in a dense business area, and can be easy to miss while driving by. After seeing this place here on Yelp, I though it would be a great idea for a lunch, made even better because I'd be supporting a small local business. 

What a gem! The food is fantastic, and there are seasonal variances to mix things up. Fantastic service and lively conversation really add to the local feel. I don't get there as often as I'd like, but I'm quite happy every time I get lunch here."}
{"text":"My only regret is that the shop isn't bigger! It's such a warm and inviting atmosphere. The kitchen smells wonderful, and the selection is fresh and delicious. I got the Turkey Cobb wrap which was wonderful.  She starts with a giant flour tortilla, and she layers fresh turkey breast, avocado, crisp bacon, tender little blue cheese bits, some red ripe tomato and crunchy lettuce to cut through the richness, and red onion to give it a bite, and voila! An amazing sandwich.  

I also bought two of the cookbooks available for purchase, because the money goes towards a charity. And you can't beat a cookbook for $1! 

I will be coming back again and again. They do salads, soups, sandwiches, and sweets. That's basically everything I could ever ask for in a a lunch spot. I also chatted with the owner for a little while, and she is absolutely delightful, and you can tell that she takes pride in what she makes. It comes through in the food. 

Do yourself a favor and the next time you find yourself looking for something substantial and high quality, Simple Gourmet is the way to go."}
{"text":"So I currently live in Memphis, TN. Dug this place up while in town and could not believe that I was looking at ALL 5 star reviews. It was something I'd never seen before w/ 25+ reviews. I had to see it to believe it. And boy am I drinking the kool aid! This place has everything I want in a sandwich..... very fresh ingredients, tasty, good value, use gloves, amazing service. 

If I lived nearby, I'd be here every week without fail. You need to check this place out!!!!!"}
{"text":"The BEST. I got a tuna wrap, and the tuna salad was the best I have ever had and all the ingredients were fresh and some were grown in the owners garden. She also piles on the ingredients and is very generous with her portions so you don't end up with a weak sandwich. We stopped here based on the yelp reviews while we were on tour. I can see why everyone gives it 5 stars. Everyone in our band said their sandwich was the best they had ever had. Definitely one of the better gems we have found while on tour for the last 2 months. You will not be disappointed going here. Amazing fresh food."}
{"text":"Very pleased with the quality of the sandwiches. They were fresh and the portions were large. 

The ladies were very friendly as we had exchanged stories while she made our sandwiches. She def didn't skimp on the amount of lunch meat in any of the sandwiches and you could tell that the greens were fresh. 

Only thing I wish they had was seating to eat these delicious sandwiches, other than that will def come back for more."}
{"text":"This is a great place to grab a sandwich or salad. Everything is made fresh to order, I have been working my way thru the menu and it is all good. So head on down you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"What a great lil hidden treasure! I had the BLT wrap and mediterranean salad, which I split into two meals. Everything was so fresh and delicious.I will definitely be returning to try another wonderful sandwich,wrap or salad. I'm looking forward to many awesome lunches in the park thanks to Simply Gourmet!"}
{"text":"Incredible.   A little back story; I was having a bad day and had just tried to goto a pizza place to see if they had slices.  They didn't and the service was extremely rude, almost hostile.   I'm not normally sensitive to these sorts of things but yesterday I was.   I make my first trip to simply gourmet and thought \"please let the service be friendly and the food good\"

The owner was so personable and friendly and brightened my day right up.   I had the southwest chicken panini and it was incredible.   I cannot recommend this place enough. It deserves your business."}
{"text":"Best place ever! Lived in the area all my life & randomly noticed it about a month ago & decided to visit. Was greeted at the door & felt extremely welcomed by the friendly owner. I tried the Ed's Classic Italian & it was one of the most satisfyingly delicious sandwiches I've ever had. I'd recommend any & everyone to give this place a visit because it is well worth it!!!"}
{"text":"My coworkers and I were looking for a new place for lunch so we checked Yelp and found this place. We were wondering if all of the 5 star reviews were accurate for this tiny place on Ardmore Boulevard, of all places. 

Short answer: yes, or as much as I could tell from one meal. I had the chickenberry wrap, which was huge for the price and delicious. The other food that I happened to spy there looked just as tasty. The pasta salad was good, not great, but with how huge the wrap was, I definitely didn't need it. 

Small sample size, but highly recommended. I will definitely be going back. 

Oh, and a nice friendly atmosphere as well, although I didn't see any meal seating and it was a bit loud with the cars on 30, but you should go for the food anyways :)"}
