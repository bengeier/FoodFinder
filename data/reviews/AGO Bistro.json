{"text":"Before we decided to wander through the AGO yesterday morning, we stopped into Frank for brunch. The server was awkward, stiff and extremely formal (in a way that seemed unnatural), but overall very attentive and helpful, so I wont hold her attempts at trying too hard against her.

Frank has a vegan dish on their brunch menu, the roasted shiitake mushrooms with heirloom squash, which was nice to see. The server suggested a slightly more substantial dish the chef could make for us with braised lentils and eggplant (also with heirloom squash and tat soi salad). It was phenominal.

Beautiful presentation, and absolutely delicious.  But, with phenominal food, comes a phenominal price tag, so that part was an unpleasant surprise."}
{"text":"I went to Frank's for a late night dessert and I was really disappointed. I thought that it would be good, from positive online reviews and the fact that the AGO Cafe's treats also get positive feedback. I've also heard lovely things about their brunch. Unfortunately, the desserts were not fresh at all - way overpriced for what we got. Is it worth returning for a meal?


Summer Berry Pudding
Raspberries, strawberries, red currants, and vanilla whipped cream
While tasty, I think that this would've been better topped on top of a cake rather than being served as a messy slab of pudding. It was more mushy than pudding-y.

Coffee and Donut
Chocolate espresso pot de creme with dulce de leche whipped cream and cinnamon sugared mini donut
Cute presentation - chilled pot de creme had a nice chocolate-espresso flavour, but I wish it was a bit stronger or denser or had bits of chocolate in it.
The donut was quite disappointing. Despite being made in-house, both the twist and the donut were stale and lacked flavour. I would have been happier with a Timbit from Tim Hortons - for 16 cents!"}
{"text":"Eating at Frank is always a treat... especially before or after a visit to the AGO! The host / servers are warm and welcoming, and very attentive. The food is a bit pricier than other restaurant options in the area but I like the fact that they change their menu for every season - and sometimes even in between.  If you're looking for a three course meal at a more affordable price, check Frank out during Winterlicious."}
{"text":"Menu is pretty basic, food is creatively plated.  Staff is pretentious and rude.  Menu prices are as high as they are because you are paying for the atmosphere... Not the food.  If you are expecting an exceptional meal, not the place.  But good spot for coffee and a quick basic dessert."}
{"text":"I'd been meaning to go here since it opened.  Finally had brunch here and i highly recommend it whether you're going to the AGO or not. One of the more family-friendly high end places in T.O. The 2 course brunch was friggin' great and the staff was nothing but accommodating and super-friendly. Come for the kick-ass food, and stay for the amazing service!!!"}
{"text":"I dined here for lunch during Summerlicous with some co-workers as it was one of the closest participating restaurants to our office.
-Ambience-loved the open, modern ambience. It didn't feel pretentious.
-Food-I ordered the seafood ceviche (loved it), grilled steak (good but nothing to rave about) and strawberry pudding (good but I've had better).
-Service-Attentive. We received great service even though we came for Summerlicious and ordered water. The waitress even agreed to give us separate bills (we were 3) without showing any attitude or shock.

I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Frank had been on a long list of \"must try\" places for at least a few months and finally my birthday rolls around and yayy brunch! 

One thing to note before I start: dont expect to get every penny's worth here but do expect to be impressed by at least a few things including those lovely coffee stir spoons (see pictures)

We skipped past the mostly salad appetizers right to the mains. I had the Lobster scrambled eggs and my bf the Eggs benedict. I'm generally not a big fan of scrambled eggs but these were absolutely delectable. Soft and fluffy complete with just a tinge of added spice and chunks of lobster tail. Impressively large chunks of lobster tail. The presentation on the food was good with cute orange flowers topping your meals. The fries were only slightly greasy.

The brunch menu is extensive and yet not so much. There arent enough egg concoctions but a lamb burger and steak and eggs have graced it with their presence. 

The coffee was good and strong, Georg Jensen cutlery everywhere on the table. The service was the only thing that deserves 3 stars but it wasnt surprising considering toronto service in general. Our waiter was not rude, but it was apparent we werent making his year either.

I wasnt flabbergasted with the bill..we got fries on the side, coffees, flat bottled water and 2 mains = $50

Definetely worth a try if only for the lobster scrambled eggs based on only my recommendation. Yelp!"}
{"text":"I organised a Summerlicious dinner for 6 (3couples) on Friday Evening.

We were very much looking forward to dining here as I have always heard great things.

Upon arrival we were sat away from the main dining room in a slightly awkward looking (and very cold) side room.

Apps - Chilled Soup - not good, Green bean salad - ok, Tuna salad - ok.
Mains - Fish - not nicely presented - dry. Beef brisket - very chewy - overly sauced.
Desserts - cobbler - good, strawberry cake - ok, Chocolate hazelnut - just like whipped Nutella.

We were Asked mid way through dessert if we wanted coffee, which we did not.
We were having cocktails and had planned on staying for another 1 or 2.
A moment later the server commented \"you have the biggest purse and laid the bill in front of me.
I was not impressed with the restaurant in general and do not plan on returning."}
{"text":"This is the kind of slick-looking restaurant where you're paying more for the atmosphere than for the food itself.

Don't get me wrong. I was happy to try this place out. My friend suggested it because she gets 10% off as an AGO member, which was a nice bonus.

Sunday brunch was immediately busy from the moment it opened at 11 a.m. My butternut squash and cheddar cheese soufflé was quite nice, but sat on a tiny pile of wilted greens with six apple slices; overall, it paled in comparison with my friend's hearty chicken pot pie for the same price.

However, I was impressed with the attentive service - my water glass never reached below the halfway mark (and I drink A LOT of water.)

And I thoroughly enjoyed sitting in Frank. The decor is warm but contemporary with bright potlights and fun frosted glass tabletops in primary colours. A nice fit for the reopened AGO. Deceivingly comfortable leather chairs!

$40 for brunch for two people, lounging in the lap of luxury."}
{"text":"Yes, this restaurant is chic and expensive but what more do you want from an art gallery restaurant?  The atmosphere is a little pretentious so save this place for a special occasion unless you have oodles of free-flowing cash.  

They have an in-house sommelier who pairs the wine with your dinner.  Their wine list is extensive and expensive.  The portions are actually quite good for a more upscale restaurant, you won't go hungry!  Try the Cornish hen!  

With a bottle of wine, appetizers, main course, and tip for two persons was around $200."}
{"text":"Went on the Saturday night after Valentine's and the place was empty, despite most restaurants in town being fully booked. The waiter was more suited to Kelsey's than a supposedly upscale restaurant, and the appetizers and mains were all very salty. Cocktails were all champagne-based and quite pricey for the small flute we received.

Best part of the evening was when the receipt came and listed the Valentine's special as \"VD Menu.\""}
{"text":"Went for summerlicious. 

It's a nice place, somewhat fancy, with really nice atmosphere. The staff is friendly and the seats are cozy. 

For appetizer I had the charred corn salad, which was quite good. My friend had the shrimp roll, which was good as well. We both got the steak for entree, and it was good, but not amazing. The steak was nicely flavoured but not as hot as it should've been, however I really like the papaya salad that it came with. For dessert I had a pudding sort of thing, and it was not very good. Too tough and not memorable at all, I should've went with the cheesecake.

But overall pretty good, definitely worth going for summerlicious, thought rather over priced for regular days."}
{"text":"Wow! This time around, I'm the one giving credit to the service while other have marked it poorly! Maybe they read the reviews and have since improved service? Hmmmm.

Frank was my birthday dinner. I thought, why the heck not? I want to go bougie tonight. We ordered a couple of servings of the perogies and some frites to start. Both were good. But now, I'm going to RAVE about the melt-in-your-mouth perogies. Oh. My. Goodness. \"Truffled potato and porcini mushroom perogies with buttered bread crumbs truffled sour cream sauce and fresh chive\" and they WERE as good as the description makes them sound. I swear I could've eaten 3 plates, but at $13 a plate for 4 (2 of each), that would've been a little TOO indulgent. So...my tactic was to cut them up in small pieces and...savour. 

For my main, I got the open faced ravioli with braised beef short ribs and mushrooms. This thing is literally a piece of ravioli skin, topped with chunks of short ribs, then maybe another piece of ravioli skin on top of that and short ribs. Now going to a place like this, you wouldn't expect the plates to be very big. Well, there was a meat-bonanza on my plate. I normally can tuck away a lot, but I was quite stuffed and thought the portion quite generous. The meat was tender and moist. My other companions got this as well, but my sister got the gnocchi which was delish! 

Dessert was a beautifully presented trio of rhubarb ice cream, pastry and something else (I forget), but all were good! We also had a super rich, heart attack inducing chocolate pudding, that the server so graciously insisted we try (comped). It was really nice but probably would've tasted amazing with a large glass of milk. I should've asked for a glass of milk. At Frank. 3 people could probably share this, from the sheer richness of it. 

I really enjoyed my experience at Frank, service was lovely, and the food was delicious. I think it's worth it for a special occasion. If anything, get the perogies."}
{"text":"Lovely atmosphere, modern curved wood interior- akin to the Gehry staircase inside the AGO. We had brunch, my 70 yr old parents and I (38). Most people there were in early to mid thirties. Good acoustics for conversation, piped music was jazz standards, food was good. I had the smoked salmon Benny. Perfectly made Hollandaise, poached eggs to perfection.... Cheese scone that it was served on was tasty but heavy and maybe wrong pairing with the lighter eggs/fish combo. My meal could have been hotter... Perhaps the kitchen had a timing issue.
The beef brisket hash with sweet corn salsa was enjoyed by my Mom, the chicken & buttermilk waffle by my dad. The Brisket seemed filling and enjoyed, the chicken & waffle didn't seem large enough, so I gave one of my cheese scones from under the poached eggs to my Dad.  
The service was 9/10,  super friendly, warm and sincere. Just would have liked coffee and tea water refills without having to ask... 
The alcoholic drink menu looks amazing, I will have to return for an afternoon, evening with some friends to enjoy those! 
Overall, a refreshing change for Brunch- not noisy chaos like most of TO's brunch joints."}
{"text":"My 1 year anniversary just happen to fall on mothers' day. Looking for a place for brunch was not easy, all the popular spots are fully booked. 

After extensive yelp search for brunch, FRANK was one of the spot that keep popping up for brunch. why not! It's part of AGO! What can go wrong? right? It was perfect. :-)

I love the decor at FRANK. Modern. Very AGO. The service was great. Very attentive staffs. The food was great. Beautifully present. The place was not overly crowded. We were seated in a corner. It was a nice \"intimate\" brunch experience.

Food:
-fruit gazpacho: It's like a fruit smoothie.
-valencia orange salad: Arugula salad with light citrusy vinaigrette 
-poached eggs parisienne: amazing amazing fresh croissant.
-churros: it's good. But to be honest, you can probably get the same at Kensington market for 1/3 the price. 
tarta de santiago: delicious. I wish I had a bigger stomach to enjoy it."}
{"text":"I went to Frank with friends for brunch. I would say their scones were excellent but everything else was terrible. There was about 12 of us and nobody was satisfied or happy with what they ordered. It simply was not good. The atmosphere of course is nice. I think I would go for tea and scones but nothing else."}
{"text":"I wouldn't call this a Canadian restaurant of the same level as Canoe or Boralia. But the food is good and the location (next to AGO) can't be beat: you can look at art and after enjoy a nice glass of wine and a meal.

For my visit, the service was impeccable. My server was very attentive and everything on the menu could be altered to exclude wheat. He recommended a great wine pairing.

The food was good. Not exceptional. I had the streak frites with bone marrow and house made aioli. The steak was cooked exactly as requested but a bit bland. I've eaten a fair bit of bone marrow around the world... this was a bit over cooked.

Overall, the 4 rating is a bit misleading. I would rate the restaurant as follows:

Service: 5/5
Food: 3.5/5
Ambiance: 3.5/5
Location: 4/5
Overall: 3.75/5
Price: 3/5

Overall: it's easy to find a table, the food is good but overpriced, and the service fantastic. If you're looking for a place to eat after a night at the gallery, this is a good option. However, I wouldn't make a special trip or go out of my way to eat here with so many other great restaurants in Toronto."}
{"text":"Upon entering, we wondered where the art was. The restaurant felt a bit like an airport waiting area, with its grey ambiance, muted music and stark walls. Why so glum, chums? You're part of the AGO! You literally have creativity bleeding from the walls around you. No excuses for staid interiors, am I right?

Okay, now let's talk Winterlicious food.

For appetizers, the mussel soup was tangy and smooth and was even poured right at our table. Although it was lukewarm, the balance of flavours was still very, very good.

For our entree, the sea bream was our top pick. The crispy fish skin was the best part. The only thing was that the official menu promised grits, but on the day we went, I believe they served celeriac puree in its place. Although celeriac puree sounds like a diseased dish for decaying retirement homes, it was delicious, and honestly, I'm still thinking about it.

Dessert was where everything fell apart-- literally. \"Rassembleu\" meant that they served a deconstructed pear dessert, and oh, it was a sad, sad thing to behold. It was like a bland, plain cookie crumbled underneath a cold, almost-raw pear. There were some token crumbles of blue cheese hiding among the cookie rubble. What's with Toronto and this deconstruction trend? Some of the Neanderthals among us still prefer our tarts intact. 

Lastly, the service was perfect-- there was none of that snobby \"Oh, you're here because it's a prix-fixe menu\" vibe that you get at other restaurants. I appreciate that. Winterlicious is about exploring new territory-- in food, in experiences, in the city-- and overall, I'm glad that we tried Frank."}
{"text":"Oh, good ole Frank. I have a love-hate relationship with this place. Since I'm an AGO member, I get 10% off when I eat here so I always eat here when I visit the AGO. Food is inconsistent. They make prix-fixes based on who/what is being exhibited. For example, couple months ago, they have a renaissance exhibition, so they served italian. The good thing about it is that their menu changes every couple of months, so it's not boring. If you're an avid traveler, the menu will feel pretty boring because they generalized each country's cuisines. Plating is pretentious, just like how most of the servers are. China town is next door and so is cheap college food because it is close to UofT and OCAD. However, this is the only place close enough and don't make my clothes smell. I wouldn't come here during winter/summerlicious though. Service is pretentious enough during regular times."}
{"text":"I have been to Frank several times before and have always enjoyed it. This time, however, something was definitely off with the food: my duck breast was nicely cooked, but the foie gras on top of it was not pan-seared as listed in the menu: it was either lightly poached or completely raw, but had never seen the inside of a frying pan. The entire dish was lukewarm, and the side of yams was cold enough that I left it on the plate. The soup special, although quite hearty and full of meat, lacked seasoning. My husband had the halibut on risotto, which he said was good, although I didn't try it.

The restaurant was almost empty on a Saturday evening, but there seemed to be a full complement of staff. The service was excellent. I realize that Frank is not the hot spot that it was when it opened, but sad to see that it has gone downhill."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with a group of 8. Half of the group ordered prix fixe menu. The portions are fairly small and the main dishes don't come with sides- you have to order those separately. The food was good but nothing special. Mashed potatoes and fries taste like they would at Swiss Chalet. Really just the type of place rich people go for a casual lunch. Definitely overpriced. Our server (Stephanie) was great, though."}
{"text":"I had Winterlicious dinner here.  The staff was friendly and service was exceptional.  They have a coat check area when you enter, convenient for big, bulky, winter outerwear.  I found that the tables were well spaced out, at least at the end of the 2nd floor where we were seated, so you didn't have to listen to the conversation at the table next to you.  I ordered the arugula salad with deviled eggs & anchovies to start, the bison burger & fries for my main & the bourbon pecan pie for dessert (mmmmm!!!) Everything was delicious!  Good experience & I would be happy to come back to sample their regular menu."}
{"text":"Was at Frank for Winterlicious lunch and was impressed by the food, even by non-Winterlicious standards.  I thought maybe because the Winterlicious dishes were produced en masse it wouldn't be as good quality, but if that is the case, then I can only imagine what it's like during normal operations.

I had the calamari salad to start, quinoa risotto as a main, and bread pudding for dessert.  All three dishes were great, and I was really impressed that they could make quinoa taste so good.  My tastebuds weren't exactly fooled into thinking it was risotto, but it was still really tasty, and I felt good about making the healthy choice for lunch.

The service was also very well done, not overly obtrusive but there with everything that we needed at the right times.

The demographic of the other diners was definitely a lot older and umm...how do I say it..less ethnic?  Think stereotypically art gallery type. =)"}
{"text":"Second time going to Frank for brunch. Had the eggs benny. Delicious as always and great service."}
{"text":"This is a review only for the cocktails at the bar.
Outstanding service, gorgeous setting. Their cocktail menu, just like their food menu, synchronizes with featured exhibition at the AGO.

We went there during the Mystic Landscape exhibit. I loved both the Emily (Carr) and Van Gogh. Drinks are very beautiful, and the bartend had a heavy hand (Thank you Lord). He also went out of his way to inform us of the purveyor the wildflowers they use in their cocktails when we inquired of the source. The bar at Frank has outstanding staff - and they all genuinely look like they enjoy their job posts there. 

This will be a regular for us from now on."}
{"text":"Went to Frank for Valentine's Day 2009. What more could a romantic evening ask for then fine art & fine food?

We chose the Valentine's Day 3-course meal + wine pairing and it was quite impressive. The poached pear, walnut, blue cheese and prosciutto appetizer will never be forgotten (I've even made it at home a few times afterwards) and the mains and chocolate decedent dessert made for an overall fantastic romantic evening.

For fine dining with a local twist at a great venue for pre/post-meal entertainment Frank is a great option."}
{"text":"This is a review of their Espresso Bar inside Galleria Italia. 

Ambience: 4.5/5 
Food: 3.75/5
Everything served at the cafe is good. 
Service: 3.5/5

Notes: Great cafe, only issue is on weekends and during special exhibits it can get overcrowded with little room or privacy to catchup with friends. To access the Espresso bar you will need to have either membership or purchased tickets. 

Repeat: Yes"}
{"text":"Frankly, I do give a damn about the food and drink at the AGO's fine food shoppe. They serve local-ish foods and certainly seasonlly-inspired dishes. I actually went for brunch on my birthday.  
I had a lovely time eating and then taking a little trip through my AGO. 
The salads are heavenly and pair really well with sparkling wines. 
The heavier dishes like steaks and eggs also looked pretty delicious.
Local wine list is a highlight. Even if you just pop in after the gallery for a drink, I would suggest coming here. Open kitchen allows you to view all the precision of the master chef."}
{"text":"Stopped in here before the Infinity Mirrors show at the AGO.

Been here before when it was Franks, so wasn't sure what to expect.

The place is the same, drink menu looks very similar, menu was different but very interesting.

we went for a could of the Bistro small dish specials for $8.99 each.

Both were great

Stop in if your are at the AGO"}
{"text":"FRANK offers fine dining next the the Art Gallery of Ontario.  The cuisine is twists on traditional dishes.  We hand Sunday brunch with French toasts ( with macadamias) and Basque Style poached eggs.  The food was good, though a bit pricey.  Our server was very friendly and the dining experience was relaxed.  The dining area is one great room so it tends to be loud as voices carry from wall to wall."}
{"text":"I've never given a Yelp review before, but Frank inspired me to try my hand at presenting an opinion. I'd like to say it was for all the right reasons, but the phrase that best describes my experience is \"rather bland\".

My partner and I stopped into Frank on whim--we've passed by several times, from the outside it seemed like a great spot to grab a bite, but once seated a review that describes the ambience as similar to that of an \"airport waiting area\", is rather appropriate. For a restaurant housed within an Art Gallery, there is a serious lack of character, which is unfortunate given the resources available to the restaurant.

We ordered the Cornish Hen and the Sea Bream. For dessert we shared the Stuffed French Toast.

The texture of the cornish hen was great. It had a nice crunch, exactly what I love when it comes to southern fried chicken. The crunch was the highlight of the meal. The chicken itself lacked seasoning, and the spicy plum with whipped parsnip really didn't really pair cohesively as a flavour combination. The corn bread was relatively moist, but again the flavour left much to be desired. Overall, it wasn't terrible--but i've had much better...everything.

The Sea Bream struggled from it's own challenges. Where as the fried chicken lacked salt, it tasted as though the sea bream had been crusted in it. And, the amount of pea broth that was poured over the fish, left the cut swimming--I expected a drizzle and ended up with a pool of green. Again, none of the flavours were terrible, but I expected a bit more.

Finally, the stuffed French Toast was anything but. It tasted as though a caramel maple butter had been sandwiched between slices of pound cake. I perhaps should have read the menu description a bit more carefully, because I was definitely expecting stuffed French Toast, and I definitely received cake.

Overall, while the presentation is good, the quality of food (from a flavour perspective) is closer to a Jack Astors than a Canoe or a George. You can definitely find better at that price point."}
{"text":"art, overeasy
:Dundas and Beverley: 

I love Frank Gehry.  He's on my list of people who amaze me.  But we're here to talk about Frank, all caps.  It's inside the AGO and presents exactly as you would imagine.  A contemporary space that's inviting and chic with lots of natural light and modern decor.  I particularly loved the chairs.  They were comfortable and they swivel.  

Frank takes reservations, and that is a bonus considering there are very few places in Toronto that will take reservations for brunch (Boiler House brunch buffet and Hot House brunch buffet are two others. Both of which I love, for the endless food and the live jazz.)

Yesterday afternoon a group of my favouritest friends joined me downtown.  They're the type who don't question the cost of food because they enjoy quality.  Always being \"cheap\" is a necessisty when you're in your 20s.  Always being \"cheap\" in your 30s is just sad.  My dad once told me (because he thought I was a little too frugal) that a person who is selectively cheap is wise, but those that are wholly cheap are tasteless beggars.  He then followed it up with, \"'so you a beggar?'\"  Asian sarcasm is always so much more intense.

It's always special when I get a chance to catch up with my favourites.  It puts me in a good mood.  It didn't hurt that it was a lovely fall Sunday.  

We had a wonderful chow down and service was great throughout.

We started witha  few plates of the AGO's signature black currant scones with vanilla crème fraîche and housemade preserves ($7).  They were good, but to be frank, no one has yet to hold a candle to Windsor Arms'.

Minnie had the Croque Madamme ($17).  I am a huge fan of the croque sandwiches, so I took a bite.  It was well-made, but I thought the mustard seed mornay sauce was overpowering.  It might have been better had I not been comparing it to The BEST Croque Monsieur I had in Miami.  Oh, I miss that Miami.

I had the corned beef, bacon and mixed mushroom hash with yukon gold & sweet potato a poached egg, and a mushroom jus ($17).  My egg was cooked perfectly.  My buddy's wasn't.  It happens.  Overall, it was delicious.  Smoky and full-flavoured with delicious corned beef and crispy, chewy bacon pieces.  Caveat: The portion was small, especially compared to everyone else's. I felt jipped. 

A few people got the braised beef brisket sandwich on red fife sourdough ($19). The only complaint seemed to be the fattiness of the beef.  Brisket is usually a fattier cut, but there seemed to be much more fat than usual.  Note that the ketchup was different.  We tasted it several times, and the general consensus was that there were beets in there.  Beets, neat.

The beef brisket burger ($19) smelled amazing.  I think it might have been the apple wood smoked cheddar.  Aerie and her man liked it, but she prefered the flavours of the brisket sandwich.  

And finally, the eggs benedict ($20), because one rarely goes to brunch without someone ordering a benedict.  It was your basic poached eggs, buttermilk biscuits, pemeal bacon and hollandaise sauce. Not outstanding, but good.

The dishes were good.  Nothing was spectacular, and everyone took issue with something - either the portion was too small, it was slightly salty, or a bit too fatty, etc.  

But In the end, we'd all go back.  Frank is a really great space and more than made up for the limitations of its dishes, especially because overall, the food was good and there is nothing wrong with good."}
{"text":"Had lunch with hubby here yesterday. I usually like the food at Frank, but was disappointed yesterday. Everything was very salty.  We shared Caesar Salad with tiny salty pumpernickel croutons that resembled cat food, not so appealing. We both had the hanger steak which was delicious but the fries that came with it were incredibly salty. However, our waitress was  really super and provided excellent service."}
{"text":"My experience for this spot was for a brunch before going for an exhibit.
They have a brunch menu on line which was sadly not up to do date so I was left to make a new choice from what I had planned already as the menu is very limited and doesn't cover a wide range. 
My choice was the following item
Ahi Tuna Tartar
Burger 
Poached Pear with a cappuccino
The beer selection is not available on line but is actually quite good. 3 big bottle Italian beers (750 ml) along with an interesting mix of small sized offerings (Blanche de Chambley would be my choice for those)
We were a somewhat larger group of 6 so people took our time in ordering. Service was prompt at this time. Since no one else ordered an appetizer my tuna tartar was first to arrive.
Visually appealing this was the best dish for my meal. Nice crispy won ton with yuzu and sesame provided a nice tang. The edamame wasabi hummus was surprisingly bland and didn't have any kick associated with wasabi. The side of salad was decent.
Then the wait began and the server disappeared for a bit and the main took their time in arriving. The burger didn't look appetizing as the patties was just overwhelmed the dry over sized bun. Poor meat to bun ratio IMO and the condiments didn't help much either. Fries were just run of the mill and spicy apple ketchup was forgetful. I couldn't finish the whole burger even and left most of the bun untouched. Others in the group had a similar opinion of the place as well.
Then came time for dessert the portion isn't what one expects for starters. The poached pear was half decent.  The rhubarb pie and pineapple cake went well the crowd. 
All said and done one can do a lot better for the amount you would spend here. 
2.5 stars."}
{"text":"Another Summerlicious lunch outing!  The space is nice.  The food was just OK.  Corn and tomato salad was about 4 bites worth.  The shrimp sandwich wasn't bad. It felt like I was eating a mini grilled shrimp Banh Mi sandwich.  Side salad of greens was pretty basic.  The dessert was a peach cobbler, not very exciting.  I didn't finish it.  Service was very good.  Oh, the margarita was very well balanced.  2 stars for food, bumped up the rating to 3 stars for service."}
{"text":"The service was good, never had an empty glass. The food was average and a bit bland, nothing special. The restaurant was empty on a Saturday night, we were 1 of 3 tables only. It was expensive for what it is and I probably wouldn't go back unless the food improved significantly. Too bad it's a great spot with a nice design"}
{"text":"Had a terrific lunch here with my family.  I loved the themed Diego and Frida menu to accompany the exhibit I had just seen.  The decor was chic, the server was perky and efficient.  

The prix-fixe menu was an upscale, modernist take on Mexican classics for the theme that day.  I loved the Christmas salad of avocado, greens, pomegranate, papaya, pepitas and such, and so pretty on the plate.  The short rib burrito was perfect as were the churros with dulce the leche and chocolate dipping sauces.  Hubby had the brulee rice pudding and fish tacos, equally satisfying.

The one star loss was for the snotty, incompetent hostess(es).  Really? 2 of you and neither one can disperse the 10 people waiting in line?  Really blondie?  You have to roll your eyes at someone waiting to be seated for over 10 minutes while you chatted with your friends and seated the ahead of someone with a reservation that had arrived before your friends with NO reservation?  It was a negative start to what would have been a perfect lunch."}
{"text":"Doing TIFF film tonight so decided to try Frank.  

Ordered a couple of cocktails (graffiti and the daiquiri), Californian salad, and duck and bison striploin for mains.

The salad was delicious.   A perfect blend of greens with strawberries, blackberries, tomatoes, grapes, quinoa, pumpkin seeds, and avocado.  I would never put that combination together myself but will now definitely try it at home!

Duck and bison were delicious and perfectly cooked with a nice accompaniment of veggies and starches.

Dessert was sublime.  The pineapple corn bread was soooo good.  It came with a popcorn accompaniment and matcha creme.  I could eat that again and again.  The spelt molasses cookie crumble with ginger ice and a delicious chocolate enrobed treat was also delish.

Service was friendly and attentive.  I accidentally dropped a roasted tomato into my partner's cocktail and our server brought us a complementary replacement beverage.

It is a hidden gem, especially on a Saturday night in TO and definitely worth a trip back."}
{"text":"Went here with my family for my birthday during the summerlicious three course meal.  The food was very interesting and really good (definitely what I would consider \"food art\"), the panna cotta and pork ribs were absolutely delicious and my favorite of everything we tried.  The pink lemonade tart was yummy, but I've definitely had better tarts/pies from specialty bakeries.  The flat iron steak that my husband ordered was good, but definitely a small portion.  THE SERVICE WAS AMAZING!"}
{"text":"So it's the holidays.. And the word Brunch is almost synonymous with Santa during this time, lol.  I went to Frank with my best friend. 

We were promptly greeted by the hostess and our coats taken to coat check. 

The service was top notch, my water was always re-filled when running low.  We were given a bread basket with unsalted butter and sea salt.

We ordered the following:
Beef Tongue Sandwich to share
Egg on Brioche (Eggs Benedict Style)
Goat Cheese Souffle - The goat cheese souffle was served over a fennel salad.  The souffle was nice and soft, and very creamy and savory.

We also ordered 2 cappucinos, a Kir Mimosa and the Espresso Pot de Creme and Chomeur Pudding.  I found the pudding to be a tad bit heavy on the sugar, and too sweet for my liking.  The espresso pot de creme was very savory, served with a cinnamon churros and 2 shortbread cookies... However, I would've liked it to be less like a fudge consistency and more like a custard.  So ixnay on the texture, but great taste. The first cappuccino I was served was not quite hot enough for my liking, the second one was better.

I would've liked to have seen more innovative dishes, and perhaps more variety in a brunch menu."}
{"text":"I came in here twice for Summerlicious lunch and more recently for their actual dinner menu. Both summerlicious experiences were on pary with most other summerlicious lunches I've been to over the years, good food but always leaves you craving for more. So it was with excitement I showed up for their dinner menu. 

But before I get in to food stuff, the actual restaurant seems to fill in every possible corner that the AGO could afford to give it, resulting in a very unusual and unnatural sense of space. They have a maître d that stands out because he has a mean handlebar moustache all gel'd up and ready to go, and everyone else in the staff showed great personality and service on both my summerlicious and \"non-licious\" dining experiences. 

I had a grilled octopus appetizer followed by my first ever go at scallops as an entrée, and the octopus was delicious in all it's dressing and had an almost poultry texture and the scallops were very \"fish ball\" in taste which I enjoyed and definitely did not regret my decision. My dessert was an apple tart if I remember right and was a great finish. 
My only negative about the experience was their drinks menu, it was very expensive for drinks that look great on a menu but come out extra strong (elite event-like) and don't go great with a meal. But at least they don't cheap out on the alcohol ounces. 
Add all that up and you're looking at around $100/person for a full meal, so go in expect to dish out some dough, but it is easy to spend only $50 here and leave feeling satisfied and sober. 

And the fact that you can wander in to the AGO (hours of operation permitting) as an after meal destination is a minor plus too since the AGO shop has some neat stuff you get to play with."}
{"text":"First of all, they score points for taking reservations for weekend brunch and actually honoring your reservation time. That's something I greatly appreciate in a city where waiting an hour plus for brunch is supposedly an acceptable thing (it really shouldn't be). I ordered the tuna nicoise and my boyfriend ordered the basque-style eggs with chorizo. We both enjoyed our food and as we were eating, I saw many ordering the eggs Benedict and it looked amazing. I will be sure to come back and try that. Overall, beautiful food presentation and great service. Great place to come before visiting the AGO or even if you are just in the area."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place. As an Art Gallery of Ontario member, Frank Gehry fan, and museum nerd, I think I brought the right attitude. However, the food was simply not very good, the prices high for the quality and quantity offered, the service unwelcoming, waits very long, and the \"atmosphere,\" if one is seated upstairs, non-existent."}
{"text":"Is it weird that the museum restaurant is one of my favorite meals, so far, in Toronto? I had the burger with salad.  The salad was simple, fresh, light and perfectly dressed. The burger was stuffed with provolone & topped with a roasted roma tomato.

My husband had the roast, which was beef tenderloin with broccoli, asparagus, fingerling potatoes and topped with an egg.  The meat was perfectly cooked,and it was a beautifully composed dish.

We were impressed with the freshness & the quality of the cooking.  We came here by accident, as we were starving when we arrived at the museum, but we would return on purpose."}
{"text":"Frank has always been a first stop destination for dinner when overnighting or visiting Toronto. Located in the Frank Gehry redesigned AGO, this restaurant has offered great decor, farm to table food and world class cocktails. I have counted it among my top ten restaurants anywhere. 
In my visit the other night the kitchen delivered delicious and creative food. The cocktails were wonderful and made by the same bartender that's been here for eight years. The service was good as always. The only negative, and it's a big one, was the music they played in the background. It was not only intrusive--fine dining restaurants shouldn't provide a soundtrack to compete with conversation--but inappropriate. it sounded like a lot of Shakira. 
Whatever person or consultant put the playlist together has done a disservice to Frank's loyal customers. It detracted from and cheapened the pleasure of our dining experience."}
{"text":"Bae and I visited for a quiet brunch after enjoying a private viewing of the Guillermo Del Toro exhibit (side note, if you can catch the exhibition I would recommend checking it out - very cool/creepy!) and enjoyed our experience.

Service was attentive and the food was delicious. I enjoyed the eggs benny florentine and bae had the lamb shaskuka. Our waitress was kind enough to offer us brewed coffee refills at no charge after we finished our Americanos. She also allowed us to enjoy the \"starter\" of bae's prix fix at the end of our meal, which was a dutch baby. For those who don't know, this is a thin, crispy, slightly sweet pancake. Ours was served with whipped cream, powdered sugar, and fresh berries - oh so good!

The restaurant itself is very beautiful, with a nice chill atmosphere and a few art pieces throughout.

Would like to return to try lunch/dinner soon!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised at how good the food and service were. The server was accommodating and made great suggestions. The food was verging on exquisite. We celebrated a milestone birthday with family and it was quite memorable. I am generally a minimalist in terms of design,but I felt the table presentation could have been warmer. Not a deal breaker, however. Pricey but special."}
{"text":"Went on tour to Toronto and one of many stop we have to have lunch at downtown Chinatown,my wife and me we desired to go on our own to a different restaurant and was the best decision, we end up at 'FRANKS' you feel the elegance of the restaurant very modernist at the entrance the reception is very polite,waitress bring as the menu and we chose the tapas all of the six choices were delicious,crispy cauliflower,Cesar salad crostini ,grilled cheese,kung pao chicharron.and mussels cover and a delicious chef own specialty and the merlot wine was great aromatic and good flavor and a pisco sour cocktail very innovative ,We didn't regret walk way from our group specially when a delicious food is"}
{"text":"Call me a plebe, but I simply can't imagine paying $15 (including modest tip) for a martini, especially one that's served at almost room temperature and with small, seeded olives.  

So there."}
{"text":"In general people seem to like Frank.  My experience wasn't as good.  The atmosphere is on the dull side (the previous restaurant at the Art Gallery of Ontario, before the renovations, was much nicer).  No complaints at all about the service.  Very friendly and efficient.  The food was dull and overpriced.  See the photo of my Monte Cristo sandwich.  Nothing special at all.  Pretty bland and sort of a sad presentation.  $18 for this sandwich.  With absolutely no sides.  I suppose I could have ordered sides separately and upgraded to a decent sandwich (for what?  $30?).  No salt or pepper on any tables and fresh pepper wasn't offered so I didn't ask.  I suppose if you have a bottomless expense account, or just won the lottery, then Frank might be enjoyable.  But for me--I can't recommend it."}
{"text":"I recently had brunch a Frank. The food was pretty good, but not amazing.  The presentation was excellent, but the service was crap. 

The food, and even water took forever; the servers weren't friendly at all, and made no effort to make us feel welcome or cared for. Things were so bad that we canceled our desert order and asked for the bill because things took so long. Why does it take 15 minutes for a plate of cookies??"}
{"text":"I decided to devote a whole day to wandering around the newly 
reopened AGO, including indulging in lunch at Frank. The restaurant itself seems to be an extension of the Gehry redesign of the gallery. It is as if everything in the restaurant, right down to the colourful iridescent acrylic tabletops is about art. It's sort of a Warhol meets Gehry meet Bauhaus. True to Gehry style though the restaurant is flooded with natural light and on a blustery winter's day it was a perfect oasis to partake in a lunch time repast. 

To start I had the Risotto Coquettes on a bed of sauteed chanterelle mushrooms. The cakes were crispy, golden and when I cut into them the centres were filled with a Quebec cheese that just oozed out. I made sure to use a piece of Fred's Bread to sop up all the cheese and mushroom goodness. 

My friend ordered a Chicken, Sage & Apple pot pie that came sided with what is some greens as well as some Apple Sage jelly. The pie was chockful of juicy pieces of white chicken meat. It had a great balance between the savory of the Sage and the tart sweetness of Cortland apples.  The salad greens were simply just some greens lightly dressed. 

Ok, again I'm predictable. I opted for the Steak Frites which is a Cumbrae skirt steak marinated then topped with a beetroot coleslaw and some creme fraiche horseradish. The frites where okay, not great, not as crispy as I like. The steak was cooked perfectly but I begin to work my way through the meal the beet coleslaw bled into the frites and the horseradish turning my plate into a huge pile of pinkness. 

For the happy endings we order the Ice Cream Triptych which was three perfectly rolled balls of ice cream, one is Seville orange sorbet, one lemon cream and the middle a bittersweet chocolate. Sitting atop the ice cream was a pencil think biscuit that was absolutely stellar. It was almost like a piece of chocolate shortbread. 

My gripe with Frank is the wine list. Its is strictly Ontario wines. I begrudge paying $13 a glass for a glass of local wine. As well there were no wine flight offerings. 

Frank is not a quick or cheapie meal spot. Gehry's influence is evident in the plating, the actual plates, the place settings and even the napkin folding encasing the bread and finally in the price tag. I've eaten in both the other city's gallery restaurants (C5 and Jamie's at the Gardiner) and I will say that Frank would be my destination of preference. Hold on to your wallets though, this lunch was $100 (two glasses of wine) before tip."}
{"text":"Went for winterlicious. Their menu was diverse and well worth the visit. I had the chowder, bison burger and pecan pie which was a winning combination. The mushroom risotto I tried was bland and boring as was the apple tart. Servers were warm and attentive and made us feel very welcome. Frank is a great venue to have a drink at the bar (although it seats probably 10 max). I will definitely be back! I would have gave it a perfect but for such an expensive restaurant, their risotto should have been better, same with the tart as these are staple items.

PS: expect weird art installation stuff if you dine on the 2nd floor. The overall decor is wonderful and hip though."}
{"text":"Came here for Valentine's day for a special dinner. They had a Valentine's day prix fixed menu which was delicious! The first was the oyster, as the amuse bouche or something of that sort, I normally greatly dislike oysters but they added some spinach and cheese on it with like a bechamel sauce or something and it really transformed it, it was delicious! Next we had the appetizers, a salad, and a goat cheese creme brulé - the salad was forgettable to be honest, but the goat cheese was sooooo good. The presentation was spot on too, especially when you consider the restaurant is located inside of an art museum. It was beautifully presented, a work of art in itself. 
Mains were the black cod and the duck breast. Both of which were very tasty and well made. The black cod specifically was fantastic, both my boyfriend and I agree that was probably the highlight of the meal. 
Lastly the desert, it was a 3 desert combination, a French vanilla ice cream, a chili chocolate cake with chocolate mousse, and a chai cheesecake. They weren't mind blowing, but they were good. 
I've read some reviews here that the food wasn't up to par, but as my first experience I really enjoyed the food. It's true that it's a bit pricey, but it's nice to treat yourself once in a while. The wait staff were also great. Super friendly and really tries to make your experience enjoyable. 
The cocktails were also really great, I forgot to mention. There were a few that were inspired by Guillermo del Toro, I'm guessing cause they had his exhibition recently... Not sure exactly where the inspiration came from, but it was pretty tasty. The presentation of the cocktails were impeccable as well! One of them had edible liquid gold! Crazy! 
The only reason I wouldn't give it a 5 star would be because of price, but if I could I would give it a 4.5 star."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to Frank, but my first for dinner. A friend was in town and we wanted to sit somewhere on the quiet side so we could drink prosecco and catch up. We chose Frank because it just so happened Summerlicious was on and we thought it would be a great way to experience the restaurant at the more affordable rate of $35 per person. 

I arrived to spectacular service. The gentleman who greeted me even went as far as to pull my chair out for me when we arrived at the table, which I found quite lovely. Our server was prompt and pleasant, though a straight-to-business kind of girl. I started with the pineapple salad and my friend had the cod fritters. We both enjoyed our meals, but I found the turkey bacon unnecessary and a somewhat funny looking garnish. I didn't eat it, but loved the tangy pineapple dish. For our mains, we both went for the flank steak. I'm not much of a red meat person, but our server was adamant that I would love it--and she was right. I ordered it medium and was pleased with how it was cooked as usually I'm more of a MW girl if I order beef at all. It mostly tasted like roast beef with a giant ravioli stuffed with mushrooms and gravy rounding out the comfort food feel of the meal. The arugula salad with bursting cherry tomatoes lightened it up and completed the pallet. 

Finally, I opted for the mango passion fruit smoothie while my friend went for the cookie. Both of us enjoyed our meals and I must confess I kind of regretted not getting the cookie as it looked so good. Despite my dessert envy, we truly had a great time at Frank. I only wish we had arrived earlier to check out the gallery beforehand. Next time I'll be sure to do that."}
{"text":"I was really surprised to see such a low rating for Frank @ AGO. I think it deserves five stars, I really do. I like that it has such a casual ambience and interior and yet served up fine dining quality food and service. It's not pretentious and it's refreshing to find a restaurant that's not at this price point.
My friend and I shared the steak tartare - really enjoyed the kimchi puree and the popcorn was a nice light touch.
As for mains, my friend ordered the clambake and the server was kind enough to point out there are a good amount of mussels in it. At some restaurants, they wouldn't care until the order comes to the table and the customer say something. 
I really liked the seared scallops. The apples at the bottom is a nice pairing with the scallops and more filling than it looks.
No desserts were ordered as we had other plans but definitely wouldn't mind coming back and maybe go for their prix-fixed menu!"}
{"text":"I've been to Frank, the restaurant inside the AGO, twice.  The first time was quite good. The food was tasty and well presented, and the service was excellent. The second, it was so horrid I can't imagine ever going back. So this is the sort of review that's based solely on a single bad experience, and you should take that as a word of warning. I am a member at the AGO, so I really wanted to like this place. 

My wife, cousin, and I were seated upstairs in the restaurant by the hostess. The restaurant was reasonably busy, but not overly so. The hostess is the only person that spoke to us that night. We looked over the menus at waited. And we waited some more. And then the hostess seated a fellow by himself at the table next to us. And then we watched a waitress bring him some water. And another came by, but he informed her that he was already being served. And we waited a little bit more. And then we watched two waitresses quite obviously chat about us from across the room. And then we got up and left. And no one asked us what was up on the way out either.

Fuck Frank. I can't recall the last time I've been treated like that in Toronto. And I can't for the life of me imagine why. The whole experience has left a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"Don't let the descriptions on the menu fool you. Although it seems like many of the options are a bit plain, the food is excellent! A great place to have dinner after the gallery closes for the day."}
{"text":"Same restaurant space with a new name and a new menu. I'm happy to say AGO Bistro is just as wonderful as FRANK was. And those were big shoes to fill. 
The new restaurant opened back in August of 2017 but this was my first time here since the change. It was nice to see they kept the same relaxed feel. It's the perfect place to grab a bite before or after seeing one of the many great exhibits at this wonderful gallery. 10% discount for members. We had two dishes. One was the Okonomi Fries which were, in fact, very nommi fries. Sprinkled on top were bonito flakes and togarashi spice which was not only a surprisingly delicious flavour combination-think Poutine with a Japanese twist- but it was also visually engaging with the shimmering silvery flakes of dried fish moving like little waves on top of the hot fries. Mesmerizing!
Our second dish was the special which was, in fact, pretty special. Ok. I'll cut that out. But seriously, it was one of those perfect shareable snacks. Perfectly seared tender cubes of beef on a nest of crispy noodles. And the cocktails are superb. I was so happy to se the saketini was still being offered complete with a happy little marigold blossom floating on the top. 
I should also mention out waitress was great. So friendly and nice. I can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"Loved the Happy Hour at the bar here! I visited the bistro before the Yayoi Exhibition and was impressed how they changed their bar menu to Japanese appetizers and cocktails. 

I ordered the pork belly that was slow cooked with the right balance of meat and fat, full of flavour, and served with pickled veggies. The chicken karaage was amazing with the yuzu miso aioli! The AGO Bistro's Japanese fusion was delicious and I wish I could try more on their menu."}
{"text":"We had the Guillermo Del Toro prix fixe, and the food was good but not exceptional for the price - although the salad with grilled cheese was amazing.  

Service was great although a bit slow - I got the feeling they could have used another server on this particular shift.  But the cocktails were a genuine standout, and the only thing that I could see on the menu that was related to the Del Toro exhibit.  The bartender came to our table to describe his inspiration and his research into Del Toro's movies was clear.  I ordered a drink inspired by the movie Chronos which was fantastic - complex, delicious and thoughtful.  My friend ordered the rum-based take on the old fashioned, served with cherry wood smoke, which was a highlight in terms of presentation and aroma.  

Definitely ask to speak with the bartender if you have any cocktail geek in you!"}
{"text":"The front of house staff was very friendly and made me feel at ease, the decor was very cool and modern which is expected being at the AGO and all. FRANK offers a $45 prefix menu that looks delicious, but as a gluten free eater, it would need some investigation. The server offered to be my guide through the menu and expressed that 90% of the menu can be made gluten free by their chef. After checking out the goods I went with the Cod, it was the best fish I've had in a long time. I also had a bite of the sliced Adobo Steak, the Adobo marinade enhanced the flavours amazingly, it was truly a work of art. I really enjoyed the portion sizes, they were small enough to allow for other courses but enough to fill your tummy. The only negative about this night out was that they were out of my go to gf vodka 'Chopin' however the wine list more than made up for it. :) Consider me a regular from now on!

{"text":"I came here for Summerlicious 2011 with a few of my former co-workers.  I made a reservation with OpenTable for here on Wednesday at 11:30 AM.  We were quickly seated.

The restaurant is within the AGO and has a very comfortable atmosphere.

Service was impeccable.  I wish I had the name of our waitress, but she was absoltuely amazing.  She came by every once in a while to check up on us.  We had a friend who was late by half an hour, and she kept on asking if she should serve the food or not just in case or if we should pack up her food for her to go.  I was thoroughly impressed.  Also!  Food came in a very timely matter as well.

I ordered myself the following:
1) SEAFOOD CEVICHE: Beautifully plated; amazing taste to it.  Definite recommend.
2) GRILLED LAMB BURGER: Delicious, however, was too filling for me (especially for lunch).
3) SOUR CHERRY & ALMOND COBBLER: Really delicious as the sour cherry was complimented very well with the creme fraiche on top.

My friends had the rainbow trout and definitely recommended that.  They said the fish was cooked to perfection.  The summer berry pudding was a hit as well -- very refreshing especially during the hot dog days of summer.  The flourless chocolate gateau was a little bit too sweet for my liking - but that's also because I'm not a huge fan of choclate cake."}
{"text":"Amazing brunch!  My friends and I go for brunch regularly around the city and we all agreed Frank was a stand out.  We had the asparagus with poached egg, avocado toast and the pastry board to start and all were delicious.  Then we shared 2 eggs Benedict for main and the pain perdu for brunch dessert.  All were dishes outstanding. Frank pulled off 5 perfectly poached eggs in one meal which is the real deal.

For the quality of dishes $35 prix fixe is a steal as it includes a appetizer and main along with juice and coffee.  Service was excellent as well.  Frank also takes brunch reservations so what else can I say other than we will be back."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times I have had awful food. Not sure what's up with this place. Even after giving Frank/AGO Bistro a second chance I was left with a bad taste in my mouth, literally. 

The first time I was there I had the Sturgeon and it was un-chewable. I tried sending it back but was told 'that is the nature of this type of fish'. Un-chewable and un-cuttable with a knife? Something seems wrong there. I was also not offered anything in replacement of my uneaten meal, which struck me as odd. 

At the next visit I tried the Beef Cheek, which I'd had before and loved, but this one was pure fat -- but not in a good way that Beef Cheek is supposed to be. In a weird way like the fat wasn't properly rendered tender - it was shoe leather. Another disappointment. 

This place tries to be fancy and serve weird/cool food items, but take my advice - if you're ordering anything other than grilled cheese or fries, you're going to be disappointed. 

Sorry Frank, the 3rd time won't be the charm, I won't be back and I don't recommend this place. There are so many great places nearby the AGO, so skip this one."}
{"text":"After taking in the Frida and Diego exhibit my companions and I headed for a light lunch at Frank.  It's a pricey joint, this I knew.  As tempting as the Mexican themed prix fix menu was, at $35, it just wasn't in the cards this afternoon.  We all opted for the daily soup: a corn chowder with beans, chick peas and tortilla chips with coconut milk and a little kick and the Mexican street salad with fennel, papaya, pistachios, pomegranates and white radishes.  Our just barely warm enough soup was served before my companions' wine and they sent the soup back.  I guess I'm a little less picky, but I understand the desire to enjoy a few sips of wine before being served one's food.  Our server said that the soup was coming out too quick today.  Tasted great to me!  Nicely balanced and a diverse array of textures.  The salad was crisp and fresh.  A light but satisfying lunch.

By now I would hope they would have wireless POS terminals.  I didn't really mind getting up to pay by debit, but their machine wouldn't accept it (this happens more often than not I'm told).  So, bring cash or credit and hope the kitchen jives a little better with the servers than it did with ours today... you're certainly paying enough to expect that much."}
{"text":"To summarize: this is a trendy restaurant exuding a classy vibe befitting of its venue, but the menu overpromises and underdelivers. Service, however, is fantastic.

Dropped in for the Winterlicious menu. At $38, this would be considered to be more along the mid tier of restaurants. It basically equates to getting a dessert thrown in with your meal (as the most expensive combination of the prix fixe options, if ordered off their regular menu, would come out to be just about $38).

You'd hope to be getting a pretty decent meal for this price. I was able to try all three starters, of which at least two are offered on their regular menu. The squash salad was the star here and by far the best of any of their starters (and also the highlight of my meal). The mushroom salad was pretty good, but nothing too special. The flavour of the crostini was quite nice, but the bread was overtoasted leading to it being too crunchy and hard. As for the entrees, we found them rather lacking in flavour and just not satisfying. The desserts were ok but not particularly impressive either. You could very well walk out of here not quite feeling like you got your money's worth for the quality of the food.

Service was terrific. It did take me a rather long while to be greeted after I was seated and just to get some water, but after that, I think our server did an excellent job. All of the staff were quite excellent, courteous and helpful in many ways, with good attention to detail. Ambience is modern, chic, classy, so dress for the occasion (smart casual at the very least). It would be a good place for a special occasion or date, if not for the lackluster food."}
{"text":"Went here before going to the AGO in November 2016. My wife ordered something that was supposed to be French Toast ($18) but was more like a hard piece of Birthday cake with syrup and berries on it. She took 2 bites and we sent it back. I got the same thing and choked down half of it. The waiter replaced my wife's meal with an order of potato wedges - basically one potato with some seasoning on it - $10.

When the bill came - plus one OJ and 2 coffees - the total was $57. Yikes - we were charged for everything including the meal we sent back. Not happy about that.

I will never go back. Pretentious menu that simply was not tasty. Simply for people who want to be seen. Would have been better off going to the McDonalds around the corner."}
{"text":"The decor was really nice and the restaurant itself is pretty large. When I was there, there were not many other people so it looked even bigger. The service was excellent but I didn't find the food to be amazing, though It may have been just the food that I chose"}
{"text":"I came here after a free night at the art museum. I got the burger. It was delicious, the fries were nice and crispy w side of aioli. They said the burger was made fresh to order. The pickles were nice and tangy"}
{"text":"I think my experience at Frank is considered memorable. 
First of all, the food was mouth watering. The presentation and scent was one of a kind, and the taste of the dishes were extremely unique. 
My friend had a nut allergy and we made sure to mention it. Both the waiter, and the chef came to our table personally to tell us what is exactly included in his dish...never happened before. The manager then came up to follow up with us about how the food tastes, and some quick and short small talk. 
I will come to Frank for a meal if i'm ever having a terrible day!"}
{"text":"Had brunch today at Frank before enjoying the AGO. Gorgeous restaurant, great service but definitely a pricey experience.
My husband had the pancakes ($17) with strawberry rhubarb compote - said it was really delicious. I had scrambled eggs with asparagus and mille feuille ($19), also very good.
Tea selection was amazing, and served in wonderful dual-wall glass mugs on a fabulous little tray.
Nice environment if you want a fancy brunch, but not if you're looking for a greasy spoon breakfast. :-)"}
{"text":"HOLY CATS! Why doesn't this place have a higher star rating?

We came across this place while touristing around in Toronto. We wanted to go to the museum but wanted food first so we were SOO happy when we saw this place attached to the museum ready for us to eat some brunch.

We had to try the Bloody Caesars... spicy of course. They were perfect and refreshing.
For food we had the Huevos Rancheros and the Burger with fries. So good and nothing else to say about that.

I really wanted something sweet so we ordered this blueberry tart...it was practically the best part..or it was the last thing I remember.

It's worth the extra price tag especially if you are visiting from out of town."}
{"text":"Not great, not horrible.  On the weekend they have a brunch menu for lunch. The French toast - two slices of bread but didn't realize there would be 2 types of bread and didn't like the one with nuts. Generous portion of fruit compote and syrup. The monte cristo was very tasty but very filling as it has 3 slides of bread which was not expected.  If you really want to eat here I would recommend reservations."}
{"text":"Chic and Trendy!

The restaurant is located off the lobby of the Art Gallery with clean open lines and large windows filling it with light.  You are paying the for location and to see and be seen of course, but the service is excellent.  The menu is gourmet and tries a bit too hard, but is decent - not outstanding but solid.  The price is fairly high as you would expect from its location, but the location is terrific and it is wonderful to have a nice breakfast or lunch and then see the museum without leaving the building.

Our waitress was absolutely excellent and very friendly."}
{"text":"YUMMY!!! 

I love the locally sourced menu and the passion that staff displays when they talk about the food. 

Beautifully presented, the food is a perfect balance of freshness and flavour. 

The Cumbrae streak was perfectly cooked and the duck breast was amazing. 

Staff was warm and attentive - happy to offer advice but not overbearing. 

The location is lovely with an aesthetic that is heavily influenced by the AGO's collections. 

All in all a fantastic restaurant that will keep me coming back."}
{"text":"My husband and I finished viewing an exhibit at the AGO and headed downstairs to have dinner at Frank. We waited at the entrance from the gallery to the restaurant for about 6 minutes until I finally asked one of the dozen waiters that kept rushing past us if we could speak to the host. The waiter actually rolled his eyes and rudely pointed to the front exit all the way across the room and said that we should talk to the host, at the \"actual\" entrance.  We are AGO members, we just came from an exhibit from inside, why wasn't there a sign or why didn't one of the waiters point us in the right direction before we had to ask for help?  
Any how, we made our way over to the host, let her know we had reservations and she told us it would still be a 15 minute wait, and that we could wait by the awkward bar at the window. We let her know that was fine as long as we could order an appetizer with our drinks... except we waited and waited and no one even came over to get our drink orders.  20 minutes later and we finally got up and went to one of the several amazing restaurants on Baldwin street, just a block north of the AGO.
We wanted to go to Frank to support the AGO, fully aware of the fact that our meal would be three times the price of that of surrounding restaurants (let's face it, Toronto is a large cosmopolitan city, there are amazing restaurants with great service all around), but now we are so turned off by the pretentious snootyness and lack of service at Frank that we are going to make it a point to NOT eat there.
What a shame."}
{"text":"This was my third visit to Frank, and yet for some reason, this is my first time to review. Yesterday I stopped in for lunch with friends before checking out the Moore Bacon exhibit : )  They were offering a Summerlicious menu for $20 - a very good value compared to the regular price point of the menu - so I went for it! I started with the salted cod fritter; it was a generous portion and I enjoyed the mango sauce though I tasted no jerk in it. The downside was the fritter was very salty. Fortunately for us, we had a bottle of Chardonnay to wash it down (only $28 and quite a nice wine). For my main, I tried the quinoa and sweet potato burger. It was stacked so tall that  I figure you'd have to unhinge your jaw like a snake to be able to fit it all in your mouth! Even cutting the burger in half, I struggled. The final course was dessert. After a burger and a deep fried appetizer, I figured what the hell? I went with the ice cream sandwich. It was nothing fancy and perhaps because I am not a huge sweet fan, I could have done with about a half of the serving, but it was still a fun way to round out the meal, and I must confess...I ate it all.

The best things about this meal other than the company were as follows: firstly, the plating of the food was very nice. My friend even had an orchid on her pineapple salad. Secondly, our server was warm and efficient and made the meal that much more pleasant. All in all, the third time was a charm and I really enjoyed my time at Frank."}
{"text":"My friend works at the AGO and we've been meaning to drop into visit for along time now!  We finally got the chance for a quickie personalized tour and dinner at Frank. 

It just so happens to be Summerlicious time.  I know there are a lot of mixed feelings about the 'Licious events.  I'm not a huge fan myself but I'll generally try one or two restaurants on the list if I'm meeting up with friends for meals during that time.

We arrived around 6pm with reservations for four.  The restaurant was still pretty quiet for a Friday night.  Server was friendly and took our drink orders.  The drink menu was tailored for Summerlicious and themed for the current Abstract Expressionist exhibition with cocktails ranging in the $12 to $17 area. 

We decided to go for a bottle of wine (reds and whites reasonably priced from $40 - $75).  We ordered the Cabernet Merlot, the server brought Meritage.  Didn't notice under she unscrewed the cap...ooops, too late but not a huge deal and we're not wine snobs.

Our server brought a bread basket that came with unsalted butter and 
an oyster shell filled with sea salt...nice touch.

Liked that we had a view of the open concept kitchen so we could watch the chefs scramble around.

We started with appetizers - garden pea soup and seafood ceviche.  Both good although the octopus in the ceviche was a bit chewy and the corn chips on the side, slightly stale.

Mains came up quickly after appetizers were done.  We had the grilled skirt steak with fries and the grilled lamb sausage with lentils.  I ordered my steak medium rare but it came a little more rare than I usually like.  The medium steak looked just perfect.  Tried a bite of the lamb sausage although I'm not a lover of lamb (Lisa, please don't eat meeeee) but tasted decent. 

Desserts were a hit with the flourless chocolate cake, cherry cobbler and berry pudding.  I was hesitant to order the berry pudding as I don't generally like bread puddings but at the recommendation of the waitress, I decided to try it.  The pudding was more like a sponge cake, very moist and soft, not hefty hunks of hard bread.  Very delightful and my favourite of the three desserts offered.  Excellence in the desserts was certainly unleashed.

So, a overall positive Summerlicious experience with good service, generous portions, tasty food and an upscale dining experience for a fair price.  I'm sure I will be back again for more behind-the-scenes tours of the AGO and a bite to eat at Frank."}
{"text":"Name is not reflective of the up scale ambiance.  Very accommodating wait staff and welcoming host.  Lunch menu was limited but were offered alternative dishes, such as salmon in the salad.  Hamburger was tasty but fries soggy and barely room temperature.  The restaurant could do better..."}
{"text":"I almost don't want to tell you this because it is the best kept secret in town - EXCEPTIONAL brunch, they take resos, service above and beyond. They have a fixed prix that we spilt between three people and couldn't finish it. Zero weak links. Seasonal, Canadian fare. Asparagus with perfectly poached egg, mushroom and manchego eggs benny, and banana bread French toast were highlights. Sophisticated in every way."}
{"text":"Frank is the kind if restaurant i feel at ease in instantly. The dining room, although fragmented by landings and separate areas, feels open and modern and relaxing. The service is a relaxed fine-dining style that i enjoy - pleasant but not overbearing. The menu is written so that i want to order everything- it's too bad they don't have a tasting menu. Local ingredients and playful plating make me want to return again and again. Also, a delicious cocktail menu worth trying."}
{"text":"Came here for weeknight Winterlicious. The menu wasn't anything special, but we wanted to try the place for the experience/atmosphere. 

Atmosphere - Big and open, but I personally found it lacking in décor and artwork considering where its located. 

Service - Our waitress was slow and un-attentive. It took her 20 mins after we sat down to greet us and another 10 to bring us water. She was apologetic however. Normally I feel rushed at Winterlicious events and they try to kick you out quickly, however this was the complete opposite. I personally didn't mind so much as it allowed more time to chat, but I could see many people being annoyed by this. 

Food:
Apps - Most boring app menu!! It included 2 salads, which were NOTHING special. One was literally a bowl of cold lettuce with 2 half tomatoes and some blue cheese, we were not impressed. The soup was ok. 
Mains - Good and interesting flavours. 
Dessert - Standard. Nothing special, nothing terrible. Bread pudding flavours were good, but texture was a bit off (dense) in my opinion."}
{"text":"Got the okonomiyaki (Japanese pancake). Personally didn't like the sauce, a little too sweet for me.  The rice from sukiyaki (hot pot) tasted a little weird."}
{"text":"3-1/2 STARS

Service was top notch at Frank.
I was pleasantly surprised to be greeted at the door by name and was immediately seated.

The space was very comfortable, broken up in smaller sections and surrounded by warm wood walls. All of the furniture was designed by Gehry, including the very comfortable swivel chairs (which don't look very Gehry-esque). One downside is the lighting which felt very flat and dim (which made the restaurant look closed from the outside). A simple candle at each table would have made a big difference.

The selection of wines were great, with some affordable bottles, a couple demi bottles and a great choice of wines by the glass in two sizes.
Being a restaurant with a Canadian theme there were plenty of good Ontario wines.

The server was very attentive, courteous and friendly. Our water and wine glasses were constantly filled.

We started off with a starter of smoked sturgeon galette which was okay. Making a paté other than some kind of liver is hard to do right and this was no exception. The flavor of the smoked fish was nice, but the meat was too flakey and dry to make for a good paté. The traditional layer of fat on top should have helped, but it lacked the buttery richness and flavor of say a duck fat. Next time i would order the grilled octopus started instead.

The rather large basket of assorted breads was very nice, especially the pumpernickel which seemed to be made with coffee stout -- very tasty.

The rare duck dish I ordered was perfectly cooked. The bed of beluga lentils which it was sitting on was a little too much and felt heavy. The grilled baby leeks were nice, but I would like to see more char and less mush. The cloudberry sauce was a bit too sweet and strong for the dish, however the occasional crunch of cracked black pepper did help.

The scallops with crab was very nice and light. The scallops were cooked perfectly and was served with both a crab cake and loose crab meat topped with micro greens. The sauce was too rich and buttery, but luckily was only on the bottom of the plate and not served on top.

For dessert we ordered the tarte tatin, which is a dessert I really like. The crust was a little hard in some parts and the drizzle of caramel sauce was way too sweet (it really didn't need the sauce). I really liked that it was served with a sour cream ice cream, which tasted much better with it.

Being a member of the AGO means a 10% discount off the tab, which is a good thing as a meal here is a bit on the high side.
Generally a good restaurant, but still needs a little improvement in the food."}
{"text":"FRANKly, my dear...

(I can already feel it; there's a lot of wordplay potential here)

...Frank is an excellent option for a visit pre-, post- (or even mid-) AGO show.  Heck, bypass the art gallery entirely...Frank won't mind.

I love to slip into a bar stool at Frank for a glass of wine en route home.  The surroundings are modern, sleek, and there's something incredibly relaxing about watching the scramble of Dundas Street pass by on the other side of the window while you sit and sip on a carefully chosen somethingboozy.  There is impressive choice, so prepare to do some reading when you are passed the wine list.  

The service here is excellent: super-attentive, unobtrusive (great spot for a business drink) and - even when the dining room has had reservations - I've never had a problem finding space immediately at the bar.  Water top-ups seem to be amazingly managed by some ninja waitstaff.  

I've only ever had bar snacks (meaty olives, frites with lemon aioli) and desserts (dense chocolate cake, every time) so cannot speak to the complete range of food on offer.  However, speaking Frankly (here I go again)...I have no reason to think that the full menu wouldn't be as wonderful as the bits and pieces I've tested already.

Yelp note: Frank participates in Summerlicious, so if you want to try 3 affordably priced courses at a restaurant you might otherwise bypass...this is the time to go."}
{"text":"Enjoyed dinner at Frank the other night. It was as cold as a meat fridge inside, but I think this was a passing glitch. Service was top-drawer, but our server's voice topped off at 4 dB. Not sure if I can hold this against him, but honestly it was weird. My lobster ravioli and veal sweetbreads was decent, but the portions are preciously small; one of the pratfalls of expensive dining I suppose.

Obligatory Title Pun: FRANKLY speaking, a tad on the expensive side.

Menu Readability: Stark, two-pager, wonderfully readable.

Need to mention: The atmosphere is actually quite cool. The work of Patterson Ewen and other artists adorn the walls.

What this place teaches me about myself: I don't hate EVerything with Frank Gehry's name on it."}
{"text":"First rate in ever sense of the word. The menu ranges wide enough to satisfy most tastes, the food is fantastic, the space is beautiful, the service is excellent - this is a great place to enjoy lunch, and there's no reason to \"try\" any other place if you're visiting the museum.

AGO has a very casual alternative that seems quite popular with the PB&J / pizza / mac & cheese crowd, too."}
{"text":"This is a review for lunch, Winterlicious 2014, not their regular service: first, the server- she was just a ball of misery and completely unhelpful. When my salad came, I noticed there wasn't any (or barely any) dressing, I asked if she can get me more and her reply was to inspect the salad closely, which at that point I said, if she had to inspect it that long then there's nothing there, she then points to A SINGLE LEAF and says \"look, it's there\". ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!? It would have been faster if she just went straight to the kitchen and gotten the damn dressing. Then our table waited about 20 or so mins for our second course to arrive, during this time she did not notify us why it was taking so long, when it was coming, nor refilled our waters. 

Ordered the lorco (South American veggies stew). It was ok. I have nothing to compare the taste to. Perhaps it could have been a bit more stew-y than broth-y. Friend's steak was tasty except the meal was advertised with 3 sauces, she got ONE plus salt. Other friend's piri piri chicken was good and was a big enough portion. 

Dessert also took nearly as long. 

I know it was Winterlicious and all so I didn't expect 100% of the service but c'mon, if y'all don't want to participate in Winterlicious, then don't! so people like us don't waste our money on horrible experiences such as this.  It was also handy that 15% gratuity was already included in the bill because if it wasn't, that miserable, miserable lady was getting nothing from me."}
{"text":"I have been to frank once for brunch, and did a full course brunch.
Pastry basket, two appetizers and two main dishes ( I was with a friend).

Everything (minus the typo on the Menu, which oddly hadn't been fixed, considering the place has been open several months...) was pretty delicious, except for my main dish.. the pancakes were not what i'd say were.. delicious.

The hostess was nice (granted I knew her from university) and our server treated us well. He was there when we needed him.

The goats butter with the pastries is amazing!

In the end, my friend had a great breakfast, and mine was great until the main dish.

All in all for two people to brunch it cost us around $80, without alcohol.

To recap:
Good food (if you choose better than me)
Expensive (either for the rich, or a once in a while)
Great start if you plan to go to the AGO after"}
{"text":"Frank was a good time...  but I wasn't overly impressed with the restaurant.  Actually, let me switch focus here for a second.  I think I'm done with Winterlicious.. I feel like the price has gone up, while portion size and quality has gone down.  We came to Frank for Winterlicious.  

I'm always annoyed when the host doesn't take my jacket, or at least acknowledge the fact that we are wearing jackets (it being minus 15 out) and point us to the coat rack. 

Restaurant has nice open decor... the staff was very friendly, service was generally good.  I had the following items:  

Crostini
Fresh ricotta, marjoram, olive oil, tomato jam
Milk-braised pork shoulder
Creamy polenta, roasted parsnips, fig jus 
Caramelized apple cake
Almond oat crumble, wildflower honey

It was pretty good, and the main course reminded me of Thanksgiving Dinner... comfort food.  I thought the Crostini was overly simplistic.  I did find it strange that we were not offered any sort of coffee either during our dessert or afterwards.   

Our dinner reservation was for 8pm, and we were the last people in the restaurant.  They were getting ready to close up, but no one asked us to leave etc.  So, it was good.  

And not the pick on this restaurant, but maybe back to the Winterlicious thing... I normally don't get a dessert anyways, so I am now asking myself, is it even worth it.  It's probably the same price or cheaper to order an app and main, and call it a day.  

Anyways... food was tasty, service was nice... the AGO is a beautiful building.  So, it was a nice evening."}
