{"text":"Not good at all. Whose idea was it to replace Popeye's with this place? The waffle fries were crispy and drenched in grease and the tasteless chicken was also drenched. How does a chicken place run out of breasts and ketchup???"}
{"text":"Only giving one star because it's as low as it goes.  First the staff is the most unfriendly I have ever encountered.  Girl at register didn't even great us. Guy behind counter was playing more than working. Five people total working and with us as the only customer they were slow.  We ordered 2 chicken tender plates and 2 drinks. $24.00. They were out of sweet potato fries as they opened at 12:00 pm.  After ordering we took our drinks to the table. The coke was flat. Was summoned over to find out they have no Mac and cheese.  I asked for refund for meals and they couldn't even run the register for that. Had to get manager to refund our money.   Should've know better since they had no one in line at noon. Never again.  Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"I know it's mall good but holy crap. No. Never again.  Way overpriced for the small portions you receive, the staff is rude and unprofessional and the food is very bland."}
{"text":"New concept, similar to Chick-Fil-A but they use olive oil instead of peanut oil to fry their food.  It's great food but if you compare to larger nationals you will be disappointed. I like that they have tons of sides and combo choices. The serve chicken & waffles! There is also traditional fried chicken on the menu."}
{"text":"It's mall food.. it's average mall food. I felt the portions were decent. My buffalo chicken waffle sandwich was missing something, like spiciness. There wasn't any flare to it. The potato salad had peas and carrots in it which kinda made me step back for a sec. The potato salad was missing flare as well.. needed celery seed, stone ground mustard, pepper, something to bring the flavot out. I can't say anything GREAT nor can I CONDEMN it. Will I eat here again? Sure, but it will be the chicken nuggets since they looked to be made with real chicken."}
{"text":"Slow service (15 minute wait for fast food at a mall)  Blah sandwich. Roll tasted like wonder bread.  Not cheap.  Not eating there again."}
{"text":"I thought I would give this  place a  try since I was in the mall and it was new plus I love chicken.  The food was good I had a 3 piece chicken meal a bit pricier than most chicken spots but it was good."}
{"text":"Chicken waffle! Yes..yes..yes. I make it at home at time, however, their chicken is phenomenal. The only problem at this location was that there was a worker who put in one waffle french fry in the sack one at a time. It was absolutely ridiculous how long one had to wait for fast food. All people waiting wanted to jump behind the counter and show em how its done! The fries were not good, but the chicken was great. For a fast food restaurant-- it is decent. But it is a fast food restaurant after all."}
{"text":"When the space in Concord Mills Mall was occupied by Popeyes Chicken,  there was often a long wait after ordering. But the food was pretty good. Oliver Chicken now is in the same spot. They have taken the slow service aspect of Popeyes and integrated it seamlessly with almost inedible food. Dry chicken. That special flavor you get when the fry oil hasn't been changed in a while.  And onion rings that exist. Coca Cola was easily the best thing about the meal, so thank you Coke for quenching my thirst after the abomination that was Olivers Chicken. Oh yeah,  and thank you salt packets for helping make the food have even a semblance of edibility.  Do yourself a favor and eat the napkins, they are free and with the salt taste pretty good comparatively."}
{"text":"What were they thinking? First of all, all chefs agree that you can't fry chicken in olive oil. The smoke point is way too low. What you end up with an unpleasant taste, or chicken that is soaking in oil. To mask the unpleasant taste they apply a horrendous concoction of spices that do not go together, slathered in some kind of mutant Cajun hot sauce. A simple rule for fried chicken seasoning, salt and pepper, that's it.   The waffle fries were also oil soaked and, once again illustrating that olive oil is not for frying based on the bad taste and strange seasonings.  Add on the price for what you get and Oliver's chicken is a bust."}
{"text":"You can tell they use real chicken here, but the waffle fries are terrible, and as real as the chicken tasted, it was still bland it tasteless. it doesn't compare to the Popeye's that used to be in it's place. I will not he eating here again"}
