{"text":"My family likes the baked pastries such as the chicken pie, BBQ pork puff and also the desserts here.  However, I ate the BBQ pork puff and while the skin/pastry was quite flaky, there was very little filling.    Don't get me wrong, it was tasty, but not amazing. I just feel that if you advertise something with meat in it, it should at least make up 20-30% of whatever it is.  I think I maybe had one tiny morsel of meat and that's about it.    If it were up to me, I don't think I'd buy again from this place."}
{"text":"I have class in the area, so I decided that for Mother's Day, I'd grab a couple sweets for some of the moms in my life. I ended up getting a durian pancake, a mango pancake, and a slice of chocolate mousse. My total ended up around $6.40. Something like that.   I had wanted to use a deal they have where you pick a hot drink (lemon water, lemon tea, milk tea, horlicks, ovaltine, etc.) and you can add a slice of cake for $1, but they didn't have horlicks, and I'm a sucker for horlicks, so I decided I'd just buy the slice of cake (not sure how much this was, but probably around the $1.80 mark). The mango pancake was $1.80 and the durian pancake was $2.50, so I suppose one can sort of do the math there.   My mother ended up eating the chocolate mousse, and she said it was good and not too sweet. My grandmother and my aunt had the durian pancake. My aunt said it smelled of durian, but was mostly cream on the inside (I'm not surprised). My grandmother enjoyed it though, so that's what matters.   I had the mango pancake today, and while I was a bit miffed at the portion (they put it in a box that looked like it was fairly deep, but it actually had a partition on the middle holding up the two ends of the pancake, which were fairly large and rolled under the pancake itself), it was a tasty dessert. It wasn't too sweet, and was filled with fresh cream and a decent amount of fresh mango chunks. I do wish that the entire pancake was filled though, as about half of the pancake was actually tucked underneath the entire roll, making it seem more filled than it actually was. That being said, I would still buy it again because it was cheap and it was tasty."}
{"text":"Found the bakery items very overpriced and there wasn't a large selection of breads or cake whatsoever.  One of the ladies behind the counter was extremely rude and impatient, we're definitely not coming back here again.  Even though they offer beef balls, it wasn't that good.  Interior was kind of dirty, but expected because it matches the outside"}
{"text":"We ordered a cake and told them we will pick up today.  Today we went to pick up and they told us it was SOLD. It is the worst location. You need to pay for parking and bad bakery"}
{"text":"This used to be Dynatang http://www.yelp.ca/biz/dynatang-bakery-scarborough#hrid:zMormgn7LfxbnWYg-J-J8g and now it is New Dynasty.  The set up is identical to Dynatang. The interior is clean and neat and tidy. Love the little area for customers to drink their beverages and pastries they purchase.  But sadly, their Egg Tart (75 cents) though is the worse one I ever ate. The shell is so dough and chewy.. the egg custard itself doesn't have much flavour.   I should have pick up those mini pastries, 6 for $2.50 instead! They are just so cute!"}
