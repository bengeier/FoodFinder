{"text":"Some of the food was really good but the sablefish had a horrible aftertaste that didn't go away. What really was bad is that despite complaining about the metallic taste in our mouths after the fish, we were still charged for the entree ($35). No matter what I do this taste is still in my mouth. I have never felt so ill after a meal. I will not be back."}
{"text":"The decor is fabulous, the food and service, awful.  I have cooked all my life and expect when dining out, that the food would at least taste a little better then what can be made at home.  Beef cheeks with turnips, I think, none were discernable.  Trout, over salted and swimming in butter. The best part was receiving the bill. We were charged for 3 glasses of wine when only two were ordered and then charged again for another glass of wine that was more then listed on their menu. We asked for more bread and without advising us, we were charged an additional $6 for our extra slice of bread.  Were they hoping we wouldn't notice?"}
{"text":"Went for our anniversary and ordered the tasting menu with wine pairings. Everything was superb, especially the dessert, after which I could not help licking the plate. There was a large boisterous family next to us who all shouted \"plate licker!\" At the top of their lungs, which only added to our happy mood. Will go again, if YYC would stop opening new restaurants at the speed of sound! P.S. we also tried Keys Please for the first time, being way too sozzled to drive. The driver got lost on the way to our place (we were no help) and ranted against Nenshi the whole way. Might try to avoid that service in future by planning ahead better."}
{"text":"Fabulous dining experience, service was great. Appropriate time between courses, prices appropriate for this style of dining. The cheese soufflé is to die for. Our party of seven had a wonderful dining experience. Fish, steak and fries and duck were all great. The Ice Wine dessert was simply superb. My new best place, would highly recommend."}
{"text":"My very first time here... although the food was ok, mediocre at best. The service! The service was horrendous.  After half an hour we had to ask someone to send our waitress so that we could order dinner. We had to ask twice for olive oil and the look on our server's face was one of annoyance. She was not very welcoming at all even though we spared her any knowledge of our disappointment. The room is beautiful but other then that - I'll pass on this one."}
{"text":"A friend and I take each other out for a ridiculous meal every year for Christmas - she pays for me and I pay for her... It works. We have been to some great places and thinking Whitehall is in the lead for sure!  Went when the location was still Il Sogno and they have done a great job working with the space to make it light and airy. The decor is just awesome and you can spend ages checking out everything in the bookcase style wall.  One thing I did notice is that all the items on the chef's tasting menu were on the regular menu - and the tasting menu cost $5 per person than if you just ordered those items off the menu. Just saying.  Anyway we ordered off the menu to maximize getting to taste as much as possible. You start off with a little cheese biscuit that comes in the cutest tin. Oh man! If this is how it starts let me tell you it only gets better! The house-made bread that follow is a delight - couple slices of white bread and a nut bread were outstanding. They also give you butter and whipped pork drippings butter which blew my mind. Next time we may just come and eat bread. But seriously though!  For starters we shared the foie gras & chicken liver parfait pate - large portion that comes with frozen shaved pate on the top). Also tried the Bison tartar - which was very tasty and unusual in the fact that the pieces of meat were larger diced cubes.  For mains my girlfriend had the Walleye fish dish which came with spiced onion bhaji, butternut and a salad. So moist and flavourful, and not fishy at all. Good size piece, if you are a heavy meat eater you will have space for dessert.  I had the pork belly which came with turnip, grren apple slices, spinach and a small piece of black pudding drizzeled in gravy. Pork wasn't too fatty at all, they had done a great job of trimming it down. Black pudding wasn't overpowering. Gravy just added to an already great flavour.  We were so full at this point that we had to order dessert... no idea where we found the space, but shared a warm ice wine soaked sponge cake with honey ice cream. Had shaved frozen ice wine on the side of the plate almost as a sorbet. So tasty. Really well soaked with wine - no idea how many oz per portion.  Will I be back? Lets go right now! Want to impress someone? This is the spot. What a great celebration spot? Yes indeed. Just looking for an unbelievably tasty meal? You have found it!   Would love to go back again for some wine and the cheese board, with enough space to try some of the heavier desserts. Oh man now I'm hungry just thinking about it..."}
{"text":"We joined a couple of friends for dinner on a Saturday. We went along a little early for a cocktail at the bar. The setting is excellent and they make a great cocktail.  Once the table was ready we sat down and proceeded to wait for quite some time before the server arrived. She was very pleasant but not particularly informative and very slow in bringing drinks, etc. I had the beet salad which was awesome but the halibut main was very over cooked and soggy. In general we enjoyed the visit but for the price I expected snappier service and better quality of food. We would try it again to see if they were just having an off night."}
{"text":"From the moment we stepped up and opened the door to Whitehall, we knew we were somewhere special. In the historic DeWaal building, this former bank and Calgary's elegant Il Sogno restaurant has been completely redone with a modern British inspired decor and casual atmosphere. This includes shelves, mirrors and animal art as well as the \"Other Room\" for private functions. They also added a nice touch before our arrival by calling to confirm our reservations and have complimentary parking on the side of the building.   Our hostess and server Kelly greeted us immediately and we chatted away about Calgary, the food and many other interests prior to going to a concert at the Saddledome. It was our Anniversary but this doesn't have to be a one time a year restaurant. The servers wear jeans and a white button up shirt and are all professional and know how to make recommendations and credit to the kitchen!  I started off with the \"Two finger Salute\" a bourbon, rye, cherry liqueur and egg white creation that was bold and full of flavour. My husband had a local blonde wit.   Next we were served a chefs taster; a Sesame Encrusted Stilton Biscuit served in a retro candy tin. It was quaint and delicious!  We ordered two amazing dishes as appetizers thanks to other Yelpers. Le 1608 and Beetroot. This Cheese Soufflé is double baked for extra crunch and cheesy gooeyness. It paired perfectly with the homemade bread that they brought to the table as I was able to dip it into the cast iron pan so that there wasn't even a drop of cheese left. The Beet appetizer is done three ways; charcoal, salt baked and pickled. I love beets because of my Ukrainian-German heritage and my husband couldn't agree more. This was a winner!  For our mains, I ordered the Sablefish and my partner ordered the Braised Beef Cheek. The servers were quick to make suggestions of a wine pairing when they saw me struggling with my cocktail. Presentation was beautiful and our entrees were expertly prepared with the addition of love -you could taste it!  Dessert has two \"s's\" for a reason. So you can have 2 different kinds....We had the Chocolate Pine and the Cheesecake! Did you say Stilton Cheesecake? Why yes, when in the U.K. why not have British cheese in your cake. The plate was served with three small pieces of cheesecake paired with ice cream and slivers of Granny Smith Apple and delicate drops of green deliciousness.   Kelly came with the bill and gave us pieces of salted taffy finishing off our meal. This won't be our last time at Whitehall. We're going to make this our new pre-concert restaurant!"}
{"text":"I've been looking at so many pictures of their baked cheese soufflé on social media.  However, it is regularly $18 on their menu and that to me is just a tad expensive.  So when I found out that it is part of their Sunday Roast lunch menu ($38 for two courses, $45 for three) I decided to try it with hubby.  They did a great job renovating the place from the old Italian restaurant.  Everything inside is white, bright and clean.  It wasn't very busy when we went at 1:30pm.  We quickly ordered our food and it didn't take very long to come either!  Hubby and I both got the cheese soufflé to start because we didn't want to share.  It was so good.  Light, airy, fluffy, cheese but not heavy or greasy.  It was really tasty.  I still think $18 is a touch pricey for this dish but it is probably the best baked cheese soufflé I've ever had! For our mains, we decided to try the beef and didn't realize it was a prime rib.  It was done to a beautiful medium rare and you can taste that the meat was great quality.  It also came with all the appropriate fixings! Oh, and it was a lot of food.  We couldn't finish the \"platter\" and packed just about half to go.  For the dessert course, I found the flavors a bit muted and mild, especially when you compare how flavorful the appetizer and mains were! By the way, each course was the full serving!  Overall I really enjoyed our meal and would love to try their tasting menu for dinner one day.  Service was friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"This place is going to be fabulous! The service was warm and friendly. The prices were reasonable. The portions were appropriate. The new decor is fantastic. We had the beef cheeks and the duck and they were excellent. The cheese soufflé was killer! It spread beautifully on the homemade bread. The Sable wrapped Egg was divine, not something I would normally go for , but the waiter was confident on how good it was, and he was right! This place was elegant and casual with great food."}
{"text":"Excellent food and presentation. The bread & butter  is so tasty,  cheese soufflé was fluffy & delicious, squid tagliatelle tasted fresh, beef was tender.  My one BUT : salmon salad was more of a salmon appetizer or something that should be served on a piece of bread/bagel rather than a well rounded meal (tasty & fresh, but not what I expected)."}
{"text":"We came here as a group of 8 for a friend's birthday. My husband and I looked at their online menu ahead of time and were excited to try their chestnut honey glazed duck breast. However it was not on their menu at the restaurant. I ended sharing with my husband the Alberta Beef for Two with aged striploin, dripping chips, marrowbone, anchovy & radish salad for $75 and the birthday girl had the poached cod. Another friend ordered the (off menu) risotto option. The restaurant started the table with complimentary Stilton biscuits encrusted with sesame seeds and a bread basket with two kinds of spreads: butter and pork drippings. The biscuits and spreads were quite tasty. We were disappointed with the entrees though. Before ordering, we asked how big the portion was and the server said the striploin was 16 ounces. When it came out, we were disappointed to see it was much smaller than 16 ounces. It was barely 10 ounces and was supposed to feed two people. The \"dripping chips\" were very crispy on the outside and soft on the inside but their purpose was rendered useless since our striploin was virtually drippings/juice-less. The marrow was melt in my mouth and the Cole slaw was okay and had a hint of fennel. My tablemates were not impressed with their dishes. The poached cod was flavorless and the restaurant forgot to bring out the risotto until our server was flagged down about the error. When the risotto did come out, the portion was the size of an appetizer for $21. We were able to overlook this since they did not charge gratuity, and the service was good in general. Oddly enough, the menu the server gave us to order dessert from (which was the whole entire restaurant menu) listed the aforementioned duck entrée. It's odd that the second menu would list the duck but the first one did. At the end of the meal, I was not overly full and luckily I ate an instant noodles cup an hour before the reservation in case the portions were small. Unfortunately my prediction was correct. Overall, Whitehall tries its best but the experience was underwhelming for the entire table due to the flavorless dishes, the small portion sizes for a high price, and the uncreative sides for a $75 meal. I can get deep fried potatoes at McDonald's."}
{"text":"This restaurant has exquisite decor and is beautifully designed. As for the menu I cannot say it was everything I expected. The plating is beautiful but I didn't find everything as good as I had hoped. Don't get me wrong, the food was tasty but I just wasn't feeling it. There wasn't anything presented to me that made me think, wow I would totally come back to have this again!  The back dining area can get quite warm if seated by the window. I think the placement of the restaurant can be quite uncomfortable for patrons in certain areas. We had the squid appetizer and it was tasty. (Also as close to a salad as you can get here.) Our entrée was the Wagyu beef for two. I'm accustomed to very well marbled Wagyu beef (and perhaps a bit spoiled by the Kobe beef we tried in Japan) and this just didn't seem marbled enough for me. The Wagyu we get from Costco grilled at home was better even!   It's close to home but I don't think we'd come back. The decor doesn't justify the mediocre food presented."}
{"text":"Our dinner tonight was underwhelming. While there was some things that were outstanding the overall experience was completely neutral. The pate with foie gras was phenomenal, I would go back there again for that but that would be the only thing that I would return for. The bread and butter that we were served first was great especially the butter from PEI. The appetizers were hit and miss, the pate was great. The bison tar tar on the other hand was good, not great but not bad. The pickles inside of the tar tar tasted like McDonalds ones. I tried the components individually, then tried them together. When tried all together it tasted kinda like a Big Mac. That is the memory it jogged, but even with the association it really was the pickles that did it. The mains that we had was the tongue and cheek and the pork shoulder with blood sausage. The blood sausage that came with the pork shoulder could not have been better. The pork shoulder on the other hand was ok when hot and accompanied by other components, when tried on its own it was in edible. I actually had to spit it out because it was quite funky. The beef cheek that we ordered was super tender, it melted to nothing. The braising liquid was ok, slightly bitter but was not noticeable when eaten with the beef. The food was very inconsistent The pate was phenomenal then the pork left a terrible overtone to the whole dinner. Our server was a sweetheart and did an excellent job, the manager was a little less professional however and barley acknowledged our issues with the pork. I think there is a lot of potential maybe it was just a bad night and they made some mistakes. In 6-8 months I would be willing to try it again once they have worked out their issues."}
{"text":"A thoroughly underwhelming experience.  I appreciate that they'd like to serve their meat very rare, but the meat for our entrees that our table received was cold in the middle as it was so undercooked.  In addition to a significant chunk of my meal being undercooked and inedible, the service was abysmal: waiter didn't take our drink order for a very lengthy time after arriving, brought wrong drinks, and left the bill at our table for over a half hour while we sat there waiting to pay. If you want to eat here, I suggest going soon as I don't see how this place will stay in business long with their half hearted attempt at fine dining."}
{"text":"I came here with a business group for the Taste of Calgary event, and had the tasting menu. The food was outstanding, and the service was very friendly. I enjoyed the cheese souffle, the squid, and the beef.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner last weekend for their Summer Feast. Unfortunately, we were not able to try their menu, since some at our table didn't want to have the fish and their policy is that all at the table had to have the Summer Feast, if one person wanted it.   That was a shame, but we decided to order off their regular menu anyways. We figured it'd give us the chance to try more dishes and truly get a sense of the restaurant.   The atmosphere in the restaurant is quite charming. It is well decorated, dimly lit, lots of space and has good music playing in the background that isn't too loud to talk over. The servers were also very attentive; we had one poor waiter come around to ask if we were ready for our order at least 4 times, since we were too busy chatting to look at the menu. He was very very understanding though and even offered to give us suggestions for our dinner.   Although I did not have any drinks that night, my friend ordered an old fashioned that was made with a hit of smokey whiskey. He said it was one of the best drinks he's had in a while, so I think they should have some credit for that!   In regards to food, I thought it was either a hit or a miss. We were quickly given bread with butter & pork drippings (yummy!) and also some double baked cheese biscuits that were also very good to start.   As for our mains, a lot of dishes were fantastic; the mushrooms, the cheese souffle and the spring lamb stood out as being quite memorable. Unfortunately, some of the other dishes were very... standard, and I felt like I could have made them at home without having to pay 20+$ for each dish. In particular, I was not overly happy with the fish and chips and their heirloom tomato dish. We were served your average fish and chips that you could get at any pub. In fact, I thought the batter was soggy when it came out. They also include a housemade \"clamato\" ketchup, but it tasted honestly like tomato paste and did not do anything to the dish. The chips were delicious though - very crispy on the outside and fluffy inside. I just didn't feel right having to pay 45$ (what!!) for a dish I could have had at a pub for 15$.   All in all, I think it's a good experience to try at least once, but I won't be coming back to order the fish and chips or the heirloom tomatoes or the beef. These are all dishes that I feel you can either easily make at home or get at another restaurant/pub for a quarter of the price. Expect it to be a very expensive tapas-like meal, where you may walk away a little hungry still."}
{"text":"Well, not my worst experience in a restaurant but pretty close. I don't even know how to start. As soon as you walk in, you understand that the staff is not professional. The welcoming is the same level as any sports bar in town. You walk into a room surrounded by speakers, playing an horrible playlist (i was wondering if they were playing a radio station) and so loud that you can barely talk to your friends. Once seated, the server is was too pushy to sell drinks, putting guest in an uncomfortable situation. I wanted to order a bottle of wine that finally arrived 1.15 hrs later...We ordered small plates and big plates. We got a first wave of what we considered \"starters\". It took an hour to get them on a table and they have not been served all together. It took around 10 minutes at least to get them. I got my cheese souffle, and I was ready to enjoyed it, I got the smell from the kitchen of some sort of pork belly burnt...not exactly what I want to smell while I am eating cheese. Rapidly, the room temperature exceeded the 25 C. Extremely uncomfortable, making you focusing on the best way to cool or at least not to sweat. TERRIBLE! Finally after we finished the starters, the server decided to bring the bottle of wine...useless...We had to wait another hour before we got the main course...that took 15 min to get all of them on the table, with the tartare served at the end...everything else was COLD!! I decided to shorten that extremely disappointing experience, but my partner decided to have a dessert...that she almost spitted out. The risotto could not be called a dessert...or please go to some other restaurant to understand why. I can't understand why that restaurant pretend that they are in the top ten best restaurant. Go to BLINK, DEAN HOUSE, ALLOY and you will understand what quality means. Save your time and money and go somewhere else."}
