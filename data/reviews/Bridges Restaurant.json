{"text":"The food is very greasy, almost disgusting. I was so hungry and yet still could not finish my food because it tasted so bad. Don't eat here unless you stay in the hotel and absolutely need food asap."}
{"text":"I don't understand why the reviews are so negative. Went here twice with my debate team when we were traveling through the airport and both times we loved it. 

Ordered the quesadillas were there. The service was fast, the tables were nice, and the food was really good! Not what I expected from an airport restaurant!"}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast with my dad when we stayed at the Wyndham. Their menu was pretty standard, as was the quality of the food. Overall, the restaurant was rather pricy, especially considering that the food wasn't particularly special. However, it's very conveniently located, especially if you're staying in the hotel."}
{"text":"We had a luncheon on Sunday in conjunction with a family event in Oakland. Our guests (about 30) were given the choice of chicken romano or grilled salmon and both were excellent. The service staff was superb (attentive and pleasant)  and the sales staff who helped us plan it were accessible and accommodating. The desert (a blueberry cream cake) was impressive and delicious. I highly recommend them when planning an event in Oakland, Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"For a hotel restaurant it is about what you would expect. I will give them 3 stars for effort as they really try to make this place better.  They tried a lunch buffet which I liked as you had many options but they did away with this. Bridges also gives a discount to Pitt employees! They have a nice seating area at the bar as well as a covered patio great in the summer. Typically they have a nice draft selection and a good happy hour special. Working in Oaklamd we stop here every so often for lunch. They recently updated their menu to add more healthier options. The menu items I recommend are the appetizer quesadilla which are double stuffed and enough for a meal. Don't forget to ask for quacamole. Another tasty menu item is the spinach dip appetizer and chicken sandwich. The chicken sandwich comes on cinnamon toast with cheese-the combo was very tasty. What I like is you have a few sides to pick from including fruit, chips or fries. I highly recommend the fresh fruit option. Entrees I do not recommend are the salads and the chicken wrap.  The service is slow even though it is never usually busy in there so be prepared."}
{"text":"We stopped in for dinner with my parents, who were staying at the hotel. The atmosphere is nice. Very spacious.

We started with the spinach dip with pita bread, which was delicious. We could definitely have polished off two bowls. Their French onion soup was alright, which I find to be the unfortunate norm with French onion soup these days. I had the barbecue chicken tortilla and black bean soup (say that five times fast), which was... odd. The texture and flavors weren't very appealing altogether.

The entrees (with one exception) were the big disappointment. I will say, firstly, that my mother's Popeye Salad with steak was very good. My father and I both had the ribeye with baked potato and asparagus. The steaks could have been trimmed better, but I expect to cut a ring of fat off of my ribeye anymore when I order it. Both steaks were cooked perfectly, but they had no flavor at all. A little salt and pepper doctored that up instantly. The asparagus suffered from a lack of seasoning as well. And the baked potatoes were undercooked. I took mine home to finish baking later.

The worst of it was my girlfriend's breaded chicken dish. The chicken itself was fine (although \"fine\" isn't my preferred adjective for a $20-$30 entree). The pasta underneath it was overcooked, totally unsalted penne sitting in a pool of what looked to be olive oil. The menu listed a \"tomato\" relish which just seemed to be chopped tomatoes and not much else.

Dessert, on the other hand, was fantastic. The Italian lemon cake, Reese's peanut butter pie, and chocolate lava cake were delicious. We didn't leave a crumb behind.

Service was very good, if just a bit sporadic. Our server offered to replace my soup (I declined optimistically), took the chicken dish off our check, and apologized for what we didn't like.

Overall, though, the entrees kind of put a damper on the whole experience, especially at the high price point. I saw a few nice looking sandwiches go by, which are the bulk of their food menu. Maybe stick to those if you eat here. I just can't say I'd recommend it."}
{"text":"Just Horrible!
Hosted 2 friends for breakfast.
Rude staff, low quality food.
Total regret!"}
{"text":"This is a nice restaurant especially for breakfast.  Keep in mind it has a captive hotel clientele and so prices are high, like those in tourist areas in other cities.  It is is nice place to meet a visiting guest to the Universities, etc.  If you want a cheaper meal go elsewhere.  If you are entertaining guests from out of town this is a nice place to stay and to eat.  It is very convenient to the universities and accommodating of university guests."}
{"text":"Ok, so I came here 3 times during my trip since it's in the hotel, and that is pretty much the only reason. I was very disappointed in not only the quality of the food, but also how long it took for them to get you your order. I has 2 hours before I had to leave for a flight, and I pretty much ordered immediately after I sat down. My order took a full 45 minutes before it arrived. I also expected the food to at least taste good for the prices they were charging and for how long it took to get ready, but I was sorely disappointed. The plate was hot since it was sitting under a heat lamp, but some of the sides that were on the same dish were lukewarm. The food is bland and was very lacking. It didn't matter if it was the breakfast omelet, calamari appetizer, or the steak dinner, everything food item was subpar. We had a great server the first day, but on the second day they were rude and grouchy, so I can't even say something good about their staff due to lack of consistency. I'd you want. Something to eat just go somewhere else. You have much better choices in town. Don't let the convenience fool you!"}
{"text":"While staying at the Holiday Inn for a conference, I didn't have the time or the energy to explore Pittsburgh's culinary scene--especially not in the rain--so I decided to grab dinner at the hotel restaurant, Bridges.

Normally, I avoid hotel restaurants like the plague. With a couple notable exceptions, most serve up pretty boring food on par with what you'd get from a cafeteria lunch lady.

I was pleasantly surprised to find that Bridges is one of those exceptions. The food here is better than most hotel restaurants.

I started with the soup-tonight tomato watercress. The soup had rich flavor, but wasn't heavy. And I appreciated the kick of spice and the cooling hint of herby watercress. I was a little disappointed they forgot about the crostini and goat cheese on top. My server apologized and brought them out, and they did really help pull the dish together. There's just something classic about a rich tomato soup and creamy goat cheese.

I tried the eggplant \"crepes,\" which were really more like eggplant cutlets rolled around spinach and cheese. I was impressed how flavorful the spinach was. The accompanying romesco sauce was a bit sweet for my tastes, but not terribly so. 

I was pleasantly surprised by dinner at Bridges, so I decided to drop in again the next night since it was convenient and I had an early start ahead of me the next day.

This time, I tried the stuffed peppers. Man, these were spicy! Don't get me wrong, I love spicy food, but I wasn't expecting these to be *that* spicy. 

I paired the peppers with an appetizer portion of pasta. I chose a fettuccine tossed with cream, sun-dried tomatoes, mushrooms and other veggies. It was a filling portion of pasta, topped with grilled chicken. Was it the most creative dish? Not exactly, but it was a good way to take some of the heat away from those stuffed peppers.

The price tag was a little steep, I have to say, but I managed to stay on budget by ordering from the appetizers. And the appetizers were actually remarkably filling--a generous portion you could easily substitute for an entr√©e."}
{"text":"Poor hygiene! The wooden corner of the banquette was grimy with the dirt from months of sticky hands, which is not removed by the regular but casual wiping with a damp cloth. The wooden pepper mill was also grimy and sticky. My water glass was not clean. The food was adequate and the service was courteous. I was surprised and disappointed to find that an egg cup was not available for the soft-boiled egg I ordered."}
{"text":"Due to the location and the fact that I've worked within steps of Bridges for the past decade I've dined here many times - for breakfast, lunch and dinner.

The breakfast options are pretty good with a nice assortment of omelets.  I believe they have a breakfast buffet occasionally but I haven't had that for several years.

They will give discounts to Pitt employees for lunch, which is nice.  Good assortment of burgers and sandwiches and some interesting pizzas.  Prices for lunch are a little high.  

I like Bridges best for happy hour when the weather is nice.  They have an excellent patio outside that can accommodate large and small groups.  They have specials on drafts and appetizers.  

If you're in town for business and staying at the hotel this is a nice option for a meal.  If you're here to visit campus with potential Pitt students I'd suggest going out and about in Oakland to try something else - this is more of a business persons restaurant and not a fun college student spot.

Servers are typically very friendly and hardworking."}
{"text":"We have used this location for many retirement and farewell parties for work. Normally everything is seamless, its a positive experience. Tonight was not.
Ppl would wait 30+minutes for drinks and longer for food. The waitress seemed confused, stressed out and extremely unorganized.  Our guest of honor had to wait 45 minutes to order  after the other guests had food. Guests who asked for boxes had to wait almost an hour to get them. Our checks seemed to never come.  We sat waiting for checks for a long period of time."}
{"text":"This hotel restaurant does not have an Oakland feel. There are no college students; the clientele is mostly professionals. The atmosphere is quite laid back and quiet as opposed to the typical bustle of Oakland. Bridges is sort of an escape from Oakland if you can't leave the area but would like a break from the college scene.

The food is fine. I had a fish sandwich. Which was a run of the mill sandwich. There are certainly better options in the area food. I think the restaurant's appeal is the change of atmosphere.

Lastly, there was only one craft beer available as a draft out of about ten taps."}
{"text":"Erzatz food. Reasonable prices. Relaxing atmosphere. Quiet. Terrible wine list. OK for a rainy day if you are staying in the hotel upstairs, hungry but are not quite ready to go \"out\"."}
{"text":"The food is just fine, not amazing, not terrible, nice and average. But the value is poor... very expensive for what you get.

That said, they have a great porch when it's warm out and their bartenders rock!!

If I'm visiting Pittsburgh (which I do frequently for work) I'd rather eat elsewhere in Oakland and come back her to drink and work on my laptop on their beautiful porch."}
{"text":"My dining at Bridges came about as a result of a doctor's appointment across the driveway for the best friend, and since there is absolutely nothing else within a reasonable walking distance for a blind woman.  So we (she) decided we'd have our lunch here.

I have never been a fan of any hotel restaurant, unless a voucher for free continental is involved, usually due to hyper-over-inflated prices for regular ol' food.  And this meal pretty much sealed that deal.

The basics of the meal, honestly, were not 'awful' or even 'bad'. 

Two cups of coffee (a little bitter, but at least it wasn't brown Pittsburgh water), Ilene had a Turkey Club Sandwich with Onion Rings and I decided to brave yet another attempt at someone's offering of a 'Reuben', hoping within hope to find a good one. I ordered mine with fries.

The decor is a bit typical hotel overdone and VERY spacious (I assume they hope within hope for larger crowds) with an equally large bar area.  The music in the background was that kind of Muzak pseudo jazz - lulling but not inspiring - and no recognizable tunes, and through it could be heard the droning of the sports channel on the TV in the bar.

The food - was basic food, presented with the industrial food service tricks.  My Reuben was cut in half, and served so that the open inside of the sandwich could be seen.  Upon inspection, yes indeed, the old trick I'd been taught when working for Gladieux at the old Pittsburgh Airport was there before me. They take the meat, ball it up, place it in the center of the bread, top it, cut it, spread it, and display this thick pile of meat poking out of the sliced sandwich.  The trouble is, when you actually open the sandwich, all of the meat is in that center ball - it doesn't spread out to the edge of the bread. They fill that gap in with the sauerkraut, thousand island dressing and cheese.  The bread was a marble bread, and was basic bread slice size, not the usual larger size that a Reuben would come on.  The fries were real potatoes, but kind of soggy. 

Ilene's Turkey Club was - well - a Turkey Club. Take a BLT, and add Turkey, and voila. A Turkey Club. Then take one half of a medium onion,. separate the rings, batter and deep fry it, and voila, Onion Rings.  No big challenge here.  When Ilene had finished, there was a chunk of bacon on her plate, and I snuck a nibble. The bacon was downright weird. It almost tasted like pork jerky that had been soaked in black pepper. 

My big question for any hotel restaurant is generally, do you really WANT people to eat at your establishment? Then why charge double for something basic, especially in a neighborhood like Oakland, that can be easily gotten half the price and the same quality simply by walking five or six blocks?  They're already charging huge amounts for rooms above - a sandwich is a sandwich - and can be gotten anywhere. Charge a 'normal' rate for the sandwich, and maybe locals will consider YOU at the same time they're considering the pangs in their belly.  It has just never made sense to me, in any city.

Both of our sandwiches were in the $14 range, and add the coffee and the check came to slightly over $30 for lunch.  Two Lat Tokes at Spice Island Tea house, about six blocks away, is not only more flavorful and unique, but BOTH salads would cost the same as ONE sandwich at bridges. It just isn't logical.

The service was fine, pleasant and helpful.  But seriously, for me, it's a F.T.L.T. visit.

First time, last time.

It wasn't a 'bad' experience, or a necessarily 'bad' meal - it's just that in a neighborhood that has SO much different food to choose from, unless you're strapped to a dialysis machine from the kidney clinic across the driveway, why would you spend your money on this?"}
{"text":"The only reason I ate at this hotel restaurant was that I was part of a meet up group that was having a holiday buffet here. This is not a place I would venture on my own.

The buffet consisted of salad with berries and goat cheese, salmon romano, veal osso bucco, chicken saltimbocca, pasta, red potatoes, and vegetables. There was also rolls and butter.

For dessert we had a choice of creme caramel, chocolate lava cake, or lemon tarte.
soft drinks, coffee, and tea were included.  The food was okay I didn't care much for the salmon  bu did enjoy the veal, the chicken, and the chocolate cake.

Service was good. They were a bit slow cleaning off the tables but it was not too much of a problem. Note they do have WiFi but again you need a passcode so I would imagine it would be paid.

Since I was attending an event we got a very deep discounted rate on our meal. We had a nice luncheon and they did validate our parking in a nearby garage.

Keep in mind this place is located near a medical facility in Oakland and is in the heart of the University of Pittsburgh campus. Again I wouldn't recommend it while school is in session and I probably would not go out of my way just to eat in hotel now known as the Wyndham garden."}
