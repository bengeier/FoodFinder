{"text":"The friendliest, most comfortable place to grab a bite in the immediate area!  I go to this Chilis at least once a week. Every time, I get great service. The servers are attentive. The atmosphere is pleasant - not too noisy. It's just a great place to get lunch with a friend or a colleague (dinner too).  One additional plus is that they have their own free parking lot. Being so close to the university, parking is at a premium. This makes it easy and stress free to get to the restaurant.  I would comment on the food but it's typical all American fare. Everything seems to be of high quality. The hamburgers are particularly tasty. Plenty of variety.  Although it's a chain restaurant, you really get a neighborhood feel. I highly recommend this Chilis."}
{"text":"the Worst experience ever we have, when we have been seated we mentioned to the waiter that we have someone birthday and she mentioned that she will get her people to say HBD but nothing happened and we did not ask again by the end because we were already frustrated with the very very poor service, we ordered a soup and entree and they got both of them on the same time with the soup cold and then the waiter asked us to take the entree and put it in the kitchen so it will not become cold and he said that he will bring later a new one and will be hot after we have our soup, we said to him be honest as u will take it back to the kitchen and they will bring it again after they heated it in the microwave, these guys have a lot of problems and very poor service don`t buzzer to go there just go to chilli's in USA and see the service these guys in USA are amazing, the manager came with a five dollars coupon by the end of this stay to say he is sorry for anything and that we can use this coupon on our next visit, he is dreamer we will never ever go back there and will never recommend to anybody."}
{"text":"Food was good but fries were barely warm. Server was good, and friendly."}
{"text":"We are from out of town with three kids, were looking for reliable fare.  Service was excellent,  thanks Ryan!  Burger was great,  fajitas ok,  beef cut could have been better but shrimp sizzling.  Great El Presidente margarita! Kids ate well.  Wish they had the peanut butter cookie in a pan! Like the soccer decor.  Reliable fare,  could be taken a step higher."}
{"text":"I've been going here consistently for the last 4-5 years. Either with my buddies or with the family. Never had a problem with the order coming out wrong and the food is always good. If you want GREAT service sit in the bar area if Dave is working (short stocky white guy with a shaved head). Always on top of things, always in a really good mood and remembers your name if you've been in consistently."}
{"text":"Who would want the chips and salsa at the end of the meal? In the middle of a meal maybe yes but not in the end of a meal... And you do know that other customers are complaining about the service too that time right? I know your very much aware of it. Anyways thanks for the very unique experience though. As they say theres always a first time..."}
{"text":"My cravings of food and drinks are always met. The experience is always enjoyable to put my hunger cravings away and leave happy with great food and great times.."}
{"text":"it's valentine's day and it is my first time to had dinner with my family at chili's and it was so great.from the hostess he is approachable, then when we met our server she is very anticipating and friendly to us."}
{"text":"The beer was ice cold and service was great.  I ordered the classic sirloin with onions and mushrooms on the side.  Steak was cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"Food was up to par today. My last experience was mediocre and still decided to give this place another try. We ended up with the same unfriendly and rude bartender.  It was like once he realized we were only doing margaritas and an appetizer, we were not worth his time. I had to walk up to the bar to get my food warmed up and had to wait 10-15 mins to get a refill on salsa after I initially requested it. It also took him another 10 mins or so to bring the bill after I initially requested it. He didn't have a problem stopping at other tables within the bar area to make small talk, provide refills or tabs to the two other occupied tables. If he was overwhelmed my advice would be to get an actual server in the bar area and he could stick to making drinks."}
{"text":"Terrible experience! From the attitude of the hostess to the overcooked cheese fries TWICE. Hey atleast I didnt have to pay for the overcooked fries. The manager defended the kitchen the first time by saying they were right out of the oven. Waitress was friendly but once there was an issue with the fries, she disappeared. If I wasnt desperate for a place to eat later at night,I wouldnt have stopped here. Avoid this location at all costs, go up to Happy Valley rd instead for a better experience."}
{"text":"Great service and food! We have never had an issue and are always happy to return. There is something to be said about good customer service, more places should concentrate on that."}
{"text":"Good clean Chili's. Friendly staff, although that can be a bad thing... since I have to tip them extra because they refill my cup every 5 minutes. I have been going a little bit more than usual because of the \"2 for $20\" deal. Never had a bad experience here, just wish there was more on the 2-20 deal."}
{"text":"Cassi is the best server I've had at a restaurant in a long time! The food was delicious. The restaurant has been remodeled on the inside...it looks good & it's clean. This Chili's is my fav!"}
{"text":"The chilis on mill is always better its downtown tempe right next to asu so crowded is expected. However the service here is so slow we saw our server like twice and we were there for nearly two hours. The food is decent like any other chilis bit man they need to work on their spred."}
{"text":"There is a new chicken quesidilla that has breaded chicken in it. The 1st time it was ordered it was burnt and folded very strange. Didn't taste good at all. Second looked better but still had breaded chicken in it. Management did not offer to refund us for 1st ruined item but offered another item like an appetizer for free and then was rude when we commented about the fact that we didn't like the fact the chicken was breaded. Bad service in these areas and really ruined our visit."}
{"text":"It doesn't surprise me this place closed down I was here with my family a few years ago and never again. The one thing that really stands out about this place was dealing with the manager. A paper clip is more useful then she was i really hope she sees this review because   I think that the job was to difficult for her there's always chucky cheese something little more your speed and you don't need a personality to work there. Perfect for you."}
{"text":"I go to chilis about twice a month  love the chips and salsa and blackberry tea normally the sercives is great but this time was a complete disaster ! The hostest didnt know our server was going to be and raddles off five names of possible waiters not a big deal just super awkward when the sever eventually did arrive we placed our order after about 20mins appetizers and meal arrive at the exact same time my Boyfriend mashed potatoes had a hair in them(f***ing disgusting) it took so long to get someone's attention that he decided that he would just eat the rest of his food instead and not mention it knowing it would ruin my appetite.durning the whole meal we were checked on ZERO times every time  we tried stopping an employee's including a manger to ask for refills  and more salsa. they rushed right past us the restaurant by no means was backed and even if it was thats no reason to give piss poor service when we did get a mangers attention he seemed very aggravated and rushed never once asked how our meals came out and just hurry up and basically threw our to go boxes on the table .To top this all off there new payment systems on the table wasnt reading my card for i had to walk across the street to the bank where my card worked just fine and didnt get to redeem any point for my puchuse may seem stupid to some people but i love getting points for my puchuse to eventually receive a free desert needless to say we won't be returning any time soon."}
{"text":"I've never even been to this restaurant in the US but we were in the mood for burgers and after looking at their menu online it sounded appeitizing.  We order the Smokehouse burger and the Jalapeno Smokehouse.  First off, the place and the cutlery/glasses/plates are dirty. We order a pitcher of beer and the glasses had what looked like BBQ sauce on the rim. I took my napkin and wiped it along and sure enough it was some sort of sauce. I mentioned it to the server and she brought me another one and the second one was clean-er... it has less BBQ sauce along the rim but nevertheless it had to be wiped off.  The cutlery/plates looked banged up as if this place had been around for 100 years, its only a few years old I dont know why everything appeared so run down.  As for the food, it was alright. The burgers were decent. If it werent for the bacon, which was very flavorful, the burgers would be nothing.  Btw, my boyfriend ordered onion rings, and instead got a side of onion straws, you know the same topping that was in his burger- which didnt make any sense.  Would I go back? Nope"}
{"text":"Yeah, I know you probably already know what to expect at Chili's - I mean, it is Chili's, after all. But this one's for the vegetarians, just in case you didn't know they've got a black bean burger patty available. A pretty good one too. Not sure where they get it, it's definitely not Morning Star Farms. It's much bigger, for one thing - thicker and chunkier. And they'll swap it into any of their burgers without an extra charge. I usually order the swiss & mushroom burger myself - hold the burger, bring on the black bean patty. Definitely gets me my veggie burger fix when the time comes.  I've always received friendly and efficient service at this particular location - they're aware you're probably on your lunch break and they bring the check early, just in case."}
{"text":"What can I say, it's Chili's! Just a 5 minute drive from our house where we know we're gonna get average but pretty good food & drinks.   My Hubby is a fan of their chicken fajitas, he gets them every time! I haven't really had an entree that was amazing but I must say, their mashed potatoes with black pepper gravy is so good! Their desserts are ok as well, nothing that stands out. The best one is probably the paradise pie.   On our most recent visit this past Saturday, I had one of the best margaritas of my life. It was the Patron pomegranate marg & it was to die for! So good I ordered 2 & didn't even care it was $20, so worth it!!   We will continue to eat at Chili's & order take out from time to time since the location is so convenient."}
{"text":"I guess as I'm getting older I'm seeing the value in things a little more clearly. I used to really enjoy going out to eat and didn't ever stop to wonder if I was getting a good deal. Lately, though, I've been paying close attention to what all of the foods cost and comparing them to other eating establishments.  My daughter's school was having a fundraiser at this Chili's last night. It was the kind that they donate a certain percentage of the total bill to the school. We try to help the school whenever we can, so we decided to make it a fun night out with the kids. My daughters enjoyed themselves and saw a few friends, and we all got to relax and let other people do the work.  My issue with this restaurant, though, and why I gave it two stars, is strictly with the value of the food. I understand that the costs of everything are increasing, so business establishments have to raise their prices accordingly, but they should still be able to offer a decent value.  We ordered the Southern Smokehouse Bacon Burger for my wife and I to split, and the kids ordered a corn dog and a quesadilla. My wife and I usually split meals because they are so big and calorie-laden, and it helps to keep costs down. Most of the time we leave feeling full and happy. When they brought out our food this evening, though, my half of the burger was tiny! The burger was supposed to contain bacon and onion straws, and according to pictures, was supposed to be packed with them. There was a tiny piece of bacon on my half, and a few scattered onion straws. I looked over to my wife's plate, expecting to see the bulk of the toppings on her burger, but her toppings were as pathetic looking as mine. The size of her half of the burger was not much bigger than mine, either. She said hers was exceptionally greasy and didn't taste how she expected it to taste. This was a little burger to start out with, and splitting it only made it worse. And it was $10.99!!  The burgers are, like most places, served with french fries. When we split meals at other restaurants, they usually give us both a full portion of fries. I know it's not the healthiest thing to be chomping down, but because we go out to eat so infrequently we don't worry about it. We want to get a pile of fries with our meal. The amount of fries delivered with our meal last night was a joke! My wife had maybe fifteen fries on her plate, and I had about eight. Seriously?! I know this restaurant is in business to make money, so they don't want to give everything away, but how much does an extra handful of fries cost for the few people that are splitting meals.  The kids meals were, in their opinion, good. The corn dog and celery sticks were quickly devoured, while the quesadilla and oranges were left mostly intact. (typical kids!). I tried a few bites of the quesadilla. It was ok, but was pretty small because of the meager amount of cheese. The kids meals, with the included drink, are $4.99. Not cheap, but not outrageous either.  I like to leave every restaurant feeling that I got a good value for my money. I know that a good restaurant can give me that, while still making a decent profit off of me. When we left last night we looked at our bill and reminded ourselves why we don't go out very often. My wife said that she's going to keep the bill, so that any time she craves this type of food she can look at it and remind herself that we can eat much better and cheaper at home. Or at least at a restaurant that gives us our money's worth."}
{"text":"Food was great, as were the prices. Shared the 2 for $20 with my husband & left full. I had the chicken fajitas & he had the honey chicken crisper things. Also had the cookie skillet for dessert, yummm! Service was good."}
{"text":"Love this chili's. Friendly bar staff and always quick to serve. Victoria it's the best!"}
{"text":"Waited forty five minutes to be seated at lunch time with no one in the restaurant.  Waited another 30 minutes before a waitress even arrived at the table to introduce herself.  Prices are high compared to competition.  Just try another place."}
{"text":"Service was slow. Chili's food is bland."}
{"text":"Good place to go for a few drinks and an ok meal. Tvs With the games. Its as standard as cookie cutter restaurants go. Good female bartender, makes good drinks, by good i mean strong"}
{"text":"Made my day: I got a free Tostados entrie from Yelp :-) But really, the Cowboy Steak Fajitos (new item on the menu) was fantastic as well as their Southwestern Rolls. Nice atmosphere, quick service. Oh yeah, and the Tostados is a free refill!"}
{"text":"Chili's in Tempe. Chili's in Maine. All the same. I suppose that is what corporate wants. What makes this place appealing is the staff and the clientele. You can sit next to a Timex one day and a Patek Philippe another day. No matter here, you are still the same."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of the Chili's in New York and was very excited when it moved to Toronto.  It's definitely not the same, but it's not bad.  I still love my Presidente Margarita.  I usually get the veggie burger (they are quite good with accommodating vegetarians), and I heard that their regular burgers are also delicious.  In the summer, the patio is a nice place to chill and have a drink."}
{"text":"If you want to get your travel off to a bad start, then eat at this Chili's. The hostess didn't act like she cared if you came into their establishment, which must be a management issue as the same attitude was carried out by the waitresses. Food was the average Chili fare."}
{"text":"Only a 30 min wait to be seated and great food and drinks.  Only draw back was that it seemed they forgot about us, food took longer then usual but was great once it arrived.  But after being at the fair all day it was good to sit down!"}
{"text":"Nice. The service was wonderful.  Thanks Mandy.  Steak was cooked perfect, philly sandwich was messy like it should. My 8 year old orserws two kids meals and could not finnish. I will go back."}
{"text":"It's a chili's. Pure and simple. if you go when everyone else does, it's going to be crappy, if you go at 3pm on a Thursday, it's going to be slow and you're going to get the best service. It all depends and it's just a chili's. Come on now."}
{"text":"I really love Chilis because it is a great place to get food and dine with friends.  I love going with a group and ordering the great tasting Awesome Blossom and flavorful margaritas.  They have a menu that pleases everyone and it is just a fun place.  The service is always great in a good atmosphere for a fun dining experience."}
{"text":"This Chili's isn't a lot different than the one on Mill.  However, not being on Mill does have its advantages with not being full of college kids all the time.  The service is pretty good and it's crowded all that often.  You can have a quiet dinner here more than at the one on Mill.  Pretty good Chili's here."}
{"text":"Chili's is one of the best chain restaurants in Tempe.  The food is pretty good, although the steaks are kind of small.  Can't go wrong with the baby back ribs.  Burgers are pretty big and the appetizers are well done.  The Awesome Blossom is my favorite.  They have a lot of margaritas and other assorted drinks.  However, they are more expensive for the kind of place it is.  The atmosphere is great.  However, I would avoid going on Friday and Saturday nights.  That is when it's the most crowded full of bar hoppers eating before they get their drink on."}
{"text":"This Chili's is awful. The service is ridiculous and the food is gross. I have tried three various times to eat here and each time was a disappointment. The food did not taste good at all. The service was slow and rude. When I spoke to the manager to advise him that we did not have a good experience he hung up on me."}
{"text":"I have always loved Chili's. Being Texan, I guess chili is almost a genetic necessity.  lol.  As with most Chili's, the service is great. I am very disappointed that the walls are virtually naked. The Chili's I am used to going to in Dallas, Texas, have what some would call an over abundance of decor... Pictures from the innumerable Texas Chili Cook-offs, and random fun memorabilia from who knows where, to create a terrific atmosphere. All-in-all, I shall give 3 stars. If they choose to add more, so that it is on par with other Chili's, I shall re-rate this one with 4 stars."}
{"text":"I was surprised, the food was actually pretty good! The service was ok, not  superb, but definitely not horrible. Our waiter said he wouldn't charge us extra for Mac-and-Chesse...and he did. Besides that, not really any complaints. It did feel a little crammed in there. Maybe they tried to squeeze as many booths and tables into as small a place as possible? Who knows. Chips and salsa were to die for. Very tasty. All in all, a good meal for an ok price."}
{"text":"The food was ok, but.... me and my child both got food poisening, woke up to throw up everywhere. The service was horrible as well, had to remind the waiter 3-4x just to get silverware, and then was sitting for 20 min trying to get someones attention for the bill."}
{"text":"Had an incident while we were there but not a big deal. Informed the manager and he handled the situation very well. Definitley appreciated and would come back to this location."}
{"text":"Food was just OK (I mean, it's Chili's) but my review is based on the waitress. Came here with my husband for lunch and we were brought our bill not even 10 mins after we got our food and we weren't even half way through the meal. Wow. Thanks for making me feel valued....NOT! This makes me not miss going to Chili's.   I didn't have the patience to get a manager."}
{"text":"Obviously not many veggie options, but you KNEW this!  I don't expect much from Chili's (haven't been to one in about 5 years), but surprisingly the Avocado Bean Burger is REALLY good!  My friend's Santa Fe Chicken Salad was TINY and my friend's Crispy Chicken Taco looked yummy, she loved it!  Service was a little disjointed, but friendly server nonetheless."}
{"text":"Went too Chili's for a late dinner tonight! Was really good.. We were broke so we didn't want too spend too much so me and my hubby got the 2 for 20$ at chili's..  It included 2 dinners and a appetizer.. we got some cheese fries.. were Really good.. My hubby got the bacon Burger(typical him.. loves burgers..) and I got the chipotle chicken quesadilla.  Service was very friendly..(checking on us every 4 seconds.. lol) got our appetizer out in less than 5 min.. the food was nice and hot.. ready to go.. I was SO hungery!  I loved there Cheese fries! yumm!! Think i will get that next time again! lol  Right after we finished.. they had out food out.. Was really quick!! Good thing too..i was still hungry.. lol Nice and hot.. Just the way i liked it!!   Was nice and full!! If ur on a budget.. get the 2 for 20$ really good deal!! I will be back soon too chili's!!!!!"}
{"text":"Chili's.  I haven't been in one for years, but on a recent trip through the Charlotte airport- I stopped in to have some lunch and to grab a cold beer.  The service was efficient, although not particularly friendly but the food came up quickly so I was able to make my connecting flight easily.  I had to laugh when the server asked me for ID before she would bring me a beer.  Must be their policy as a guy that was obviously older than me at the next table was also asked.  I decided the drinking age must be 50 in North Carolina! (kidding)  The food was okay.  Their namesake chili was bland and lacked anything remotely interesting in it but it was hot and filling.  And know to ask when they say, \"the beer is in a bottle\" what kind of a bottle they are talking about.  I thought I was going to get my fav beer in a glass bottle, but what I ended up with was a wide mouth aluminum bottle.  Not my favorite.  But all in all- still probably one of the better choices in this airport.  And my lunch didn't cost an arm and a leg.  And the treat for me?  Given it was the holiday season- there was a piano player nearby playing with abandon beautiful music.  Made me almost forget for a minute that I was stuck in an airport."}
{"text":"i used to go to this location a fair bit then something changed. The portions were smaller and the service was slower. One time I waited 15 minutes for the server to come to the table. When I complained the manager was abrupt and rude. Won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"just letting all those who want to eat there. I went with my friend to share a penne pasta and I told them to put the cheese on the side because my friend was lactose but not severe. not only did the chef not do that because he forgot. he added a little (wasnt a little) of cheese and added more on the side. when the server came and asked how our food was I told her there was a little too much cheese. and she offered to re-make our food but I said it was ok I didn't want the hassle. she then told the boss and he came over and CONFRONTED us telling that penne pasta originally has cheese. NO it doesn't for those chefs out there that know what I'm talking about. on top of that, the boss not only didn't apologize or offer a discount, he made it seem like it was our fault to begin with by ordering penne pasta. he said this exact sentence \"just letting you guys know penne pasta originally has a cheese base. just be careful what you order.\" I will NEVER go back to the restaurant because it was VERY unprofessional of the MANAGER to talk to us like that and he even lied to cover their mistakes!!!!"}
{"text":"Overall a very comfortable and relaxing experience!  Love the different types of food and alcohol drink choices.  Have gone a number of times to Chili's and always seems to be pretty consistent with the food and service, which is hard to find these days. Love the Bottomless Chips and Salsa and Presidente Margarita"}
{"text":"Our waiter was very friendly and tried hard.  He was very busy and received no help.  Not even with clearing tables.    There food was typical Chili's     I'd give 3 stars if there was some teamwork and or waiter could have done a better job"}
{"text":"This is the first time I can ever remember leaving a restaurant hungry. Craving some ribs, my husband and I decided to go back to the Chili's where we had previously enjoyed great ribs. Because I am a small eater, we opted to share the Three Course Meal Deal for $10. The meal included a salad, 1/2 rack of ribs with fries and Hot Molten Cake for dessert. We also ordered an additional 1/2 rack of ribs so we would have leftovers.   Although the ribs were just as flavorful as ever, they were dry and there was hardly any meat on the bones. Normally, I can only eat two ribs, but tonight, because there was so little meat on the ribs I went through an entire 1/2 rack by myself and was still hungry! Thankfully we had their amazing Hot Lava Cake to eat after our meal.   I have always loved Chili's ribs and I am really disappointed. My husband makes great ribs himself and is very picky about where we go when we go out to eat them. Now, I am almost positive he will never want to go back to Chili's for their ribs again. :(  Yours Truly, Sad and Hungry"}
{"text":"Last night the Savour York Region Restaurant week brought a cast of yelpers out to Chili's for a taste of Tex-Mex at an incredible price. The promotional menu offered us our choice of Appetizer, Main and Dessert for the very appetizing price of $25/ person! More on the food in moments...  The weather may have kept some of the regulars at bay BUT...Sitting at the bar last night with my friends we were treated to an amazing, educational experience by Chili's Owner Heath. As I ordered a round of Presidente Margaritas (their premium Margarita) for my friends Heath began to give us a Tequila 101 session. Speaking the varying grades and types of Tequila. Explaining how the taste of tequila changes from the lower grade stuff used in a tequila popper up to the premium grade tequila used in their margaritas.  Then came the best part...the taste. Being a summer margarita fella, these really impressed the pants off of me. Not overly limey, smooth finish, and without the harsh shudder of tequila. Heath was right! A better Tequila (Casadores - Reposado) DOES make a better Margarita. I can honestly say this was the first time I've ever enjoyed sipping on ANY drink that had tequila as an ingredient. And at $8.99??? Bargain!!!  The real treat was when bartender Robin and Heath saw how much we enjoyed our Presidente's, they offered to let us try the Platinum Presidente's (we shared to get the taste). Similar in taste to the regular one but with even less notes of the tequila and an even smoother flavour - officially SOLD me on the stuff!  After our education in tequila we got our dinner on. Canchi (Billy) and I shared the Cheesy Poppers and the Eqq Rolls. Cheesy poppers were freshly made and the cheese inside was gooey and had a nice kick from the Jalapenos. The Egg rolls were great and I loved the black beans inside of it :)  For my main I decided to pass on the ribs as I had them the last time I was in and went for the Beef Fajitas. While it was fairly standard Fajita fare what set it apart for me was the tenderness of the beef. Cooked to a perfect medium rare and so tender I could cut it with a fork. Awesome!   We concluded our dinner with Desert - I opted for the Chocolate motlen cake which proved to be more than I could handle. Tasty, Chocolatey and a nice scoop of ice cream on top tipped in chocolate.  Chili's has impressed me and is my new guilty pleasure in Vaughan. I'll be there using their free wifi more often and maybe taking advantage of more President's Margaritas during Happy Hours!  Thanks Heath and thanks Chili's  24/30"}
{"text":"The shrimp alfredo that my server chris recommended was good but I thought it was small for $12.09 it costs. I kinda at least expected a salad or something not one small portion of noodles with 7 shrimp and one piece of garlic bread. With ice tea and tax $15.72 for about $5 dollar value.. It tastes good but too rich for the scotsman in Me! next time I'll find a taco truck! Chilis would be a great place to take a casual date or meet friends but not a place to go by yourself to just cause your hungry...."}
{"text":"Came here for a To-go, waited 30 minutes when told it would 10-15 and watched employees eating food in the kitchen. Also saw a male employee go from restroom to kitchen with the same apron on. GROSS, poor service and huge lack of management on that shift!? Couldn't be more disappointed usually love the food when I have eaten here in the past."}
{"text":"Something about bad experiences and Chili's that seem to go hand-in-hand. (https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/Chilis-Apologizes-After-Manager-Takes-Meal-From-Veteran-401029745.html%3famp=y) I've had a couple of bad experiences at this location, but the last straw was when they wouldn't provide us a high chair for our infant because it would have been \"in the way.\" They offered me a booster seat, which isn't very helpful if your kid can't even hold her head up. Get your act together, Chili's. Certain things are basic."}
{"text":"Really good food and great service. I've only been here twice so far and the second visit I got my dessert free because of their rewards program. We saved about $7. Definitely worth signing up for and actually coming in to eat."}
{"text":"Horrible overpriced food. Service even worse. Go to McDonalds instead it's way better!"}
{"text":"I went in for lunch around 330pm on Wednesday 12 of April, our hostess was so rude!??? We asked for a table and I had asked her later on about lunch (to just check on it for me) (oh she was walking right by my table so I just so happen to ask her) and  she rolled her eyes right in front of me?? I couldn't believe people act like that at chilis. Don't get me wrong, it's a step up from Denny's partially but she acted like she was so busy and I was wasting her time. It was dead in the restaurant. She was bigger with long blonde hair. So, enjoy your meal. But watch out for the question nazi."}
{"text":"Went for some late takeout after a long week of moving. Cheap. Quick. Easy. Ordered the Chicken Crispers, they were Chicken Not Crispers. Soggy as can be, despite receiving them \"as soon as they were ready\" (didn't call ahead. Ordered while at the bar I hopes of fresh food). Ordered my wife a grilled chicken salad without knowing I should have asked them to hold the dime sized piece of hard, white plastic that came with it an almost broke her tooth. *if your kitchen staff is looking for their missing plastic ... don't worry, we found it.* Didn't go back and complain or request a refund because they were closed by the time she found it (walked in at 9:30 and ordered). The only pleasant part of this experience was the bartender. She was cool. Just check your salad for hard plastic and don't expect \"crisp\" to be a part of your chicken CRISPers."}
{"text":"Decent time to get us seated. Everyone was friendly. The food tasted much better than our typical past Chili's experiences. My husband got the ribs and said they were very tender. I ordered chicken. Good seasoning and presentation. Service was good as well. We also got chips and salsa and the chips were very fresh. If there is a way to my heart it is through fresh chips. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Over 15 minutes to receive waters. Brought the wrong drinks, but did eventually correct it. Burger was way under cooked and fries were not cooked all the way through. Kind of like eating an uncooked potato at the center. Was not a busy time of the day, at the time only 3 or so other tables in the dinning room."}
{"text":"The food is your standard, crappy Chili's food. However, as far as airport Chili's (and even regular Chili's) go, the staff here was the nicest and most efficient I've ever encountered. (Note: No alcohol is served anywhere in the Char airport before noon on Sundays.)"}
{"text":"If I could rate a ZERO I would.  No one will see this review because when you're in an airport you take what's there.  Except at this place you apparently walk in and become invisible.  Horrible service??   How about NON-SERVICE!!!.   I left.  MAD!"}
{"text":"Used a free coupon for the email club members to try a new flatbread which was an $8.99 value. Not sure I made the best choice of the three new varieties, but it sounded good on the menu. My choice was the chipotle version which was way oversauced/doused with chipotle sauce. The spice rubbed chicken that dotted the fairly large appetizer was the highlight and ended up picking off most of that good protein. Alot going on with salsa fresca, cheese and other stuff dumped on top, but the crust was too soggy to hold everything up, so you needed to use knife and fork. It all didn't work really well, so the California version would have been the better choice. Still, nice of Chili's to give us a freebie finally unlike their usual buy entree, get something free deals. Bartender was nice and USA today was available for my reading pleasure and free refills. Dish wasn't spicy either and less sauce and well done would have made this version better."}
{"text":"Chili's experience was great!  we start of with a tequila pop. it's something I haven't seen for a long time. (when I first started drinking, me and my friends always do tequila pop...)  then we are back on the right track with the Presidente margarita, we were shown what kind of tequila were used, and the way they serve it was great (for both side of the business and customer) we learned a lot about what great margarita is.  then we get to try the Blackberry Margarita and Strawberry Margarita. I like them all! XD ranking would be  1. Presidente Margarita 2. Strawberry Margarita 3. Blackberry Margarita  then we were served the best of the best, the Platinum Presidente Margarita!!!  it's much smoother than the Presidente Margarita (it's already smooth, I didn't know it can be better!)  oh, and I wanted to get the Platinum Presidente Margarita glass shaker as a water bottle... XD  (I forgot to check-in to the place, so I forgot about the check-in offer that they have, it's free Tostada Chips + House made Salsa)  (we did have food afterwards, that's the Savour York Region Restaurant week, from Oct 18 to 28, 2012. I will probably write that one when I get a chance to try more from their menu.)  10/15"}
{"text":"I love Chili's Bar & Grill. Try the new Shinerbok burger, its the best!"}
{"text":"Bar service very slow. Only college games on, but food was good."}
{"text":"went here yesterday with a date. Food was delicious. We sat at the bar and our server Jessica. had no personality and was a total snobby jerk to us, Her stomach was hanging out of her shirt and she didnt care , she was , well lets just say, not fit. and it looked tatcy, She was one of the worse waitresses Ive ever had."}
{"text":"Awesome yummy food and good service too. I ate chicken enchilada and margarita change chicken Bowl both dishes served quickly and it was delicious. Waiting time is around 5-10min."}
{"text":"There were so many dirty tables when we got there. The place looked old and dirty. I ordered the Margarita Chicken. The plate had sat under a heating lamp for a while...the food around the edge of the plate was all dried out. The chicken was on the cooler side and didn't have the texture of real chicken. Just hoping I don't get sick. I won't eat there again."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner on a Sunday night.  A decent crowd and had to wait ten minutes for a table.    Hostess was friendly and polite.  Wait staff is professional and act as if they enjoy their job.  I've eaten at Chili's several times in the past few months and there is always a slight lag in the time between the order is taken and food is delivered.  Right before the lag starts to become noticeable, the food usually arrives.  This lag rarely bothers me because the quality of the food is so good.  The Chicken with the Fajitas tasted fresh and juicy.  All the food was really good.   If it wasn't for the barely noticeable lag in food delivery time, I could easily give this well run chain restaurant five stars.  Looking forward to many more visits.

{"text":"Let me explain the 3 stars. I know the place is corporate, mundane and not all that exciting. However, when I first decided that I would be moving to Tempe it was inside this Chili's. That was more than a decade ago, but I know that I made the right decision in moving here.  The food at Chili's is worth 2 stars. The ambiance, maybe 2 as well. But at least mill ave is walking distance afterwards. The location of this Chili's is pretty good. But there are much better places to eat in the surrounding neighborhood."}
{"text":"Came in late one night after a friend came into town and we did not want to cook.  Tim was our server and WAS AWESOME. He was incredibly attentive and accommodating.  We did the 2 for 22 and I got the bacon burger and my friend got the chicken tenders. We were pleased and the guac was also good!"}
{"text":"Quick service, friendly servers.  I usually get the enchilada soup  Sometimes I take it to go if I'm in in the airport for a departure.  Usually I sit and have lunch after an arrival. Love the lunch combos.  The menu is limited but still offers some favorites. Nice central location too."}
{"text":"I know a lot of people seem to despise chain restaurants and everything, but I'm a fan of Chili's. My parents used to take me to Chili's all the time as a child and I used to love getting their tasty chcicken chrispers, grilled cheese, or their cheese quesadilla along with their delicious chocolate shake with chocolate sprinkles on top or a root or coke float. Now that I'm a vegetarian I don't go to Chili's for entrees anymore, but when I'm craving a decadent treat and want to really indulge I always head to Chili's. Along with the Cheesecake Factory, they have the best desserts of any chain restaurant I've been to. If you haven't already, you've got to try the Chocolate Molten Cake, it's super filling and the mixture of warm molten cake, hot fudge, and cold vanilla ice cream is just an amazing experience. I also really like the Mill Avenue location because it's the old design and I like the decor and ambience and looking out the window onto the main stretch. Anyways, Chili's is a great place for decadent desserts and is a big step above similar chain restaurants like Applebee's and T.G.I.Friday's.

{"text":"I am from West Texas (Tejano) but now reside in Arizona and where ever there is a Chili's; I am sure to be there as well!  The customer service is always great! The atmosphere is always relaxing! and almost every dish you serve is fantastic!   When friends want to go out and eat and they choose another location, I always convince them to go to Chili's; especially my ex girlfriend and 10yr old son. Wow, now if you ever met two skeptical people in this world, it is here. I have been trying to convince my son and my ex girlfriend for years to go. Then one day, I offered them a truce (if they didn't like it, I would take them to Disneyland for vacation) and they agreed, of course lol. So, we headed to Chili's, I had them order the baby back ribs and guess what? They loved it! They live in West Texas still and they now go often to Chili's, (even without me) and they absolutely love it!  PS: yes, I still took them to Disneyland...  You guys rock!!  JJ Tempe AZ"}
{"text":"I typically really enjoy Chili's and think the food and service is great. This is the first time at this location and will be the last. We went there for lunch last week and had horrible service and we were not even there during \"lunch rush\". The waitress was not busy had maybe two other tables the entire time we were there. Yet, two tables that were sat after us in a different section received their food before us, even though we had ordered first.   Chips were greasy, food was cold and was impossible to get a refill on drinks. Next time we are craving Chili's we will drive a few extra miles and go to the Chili's at PV Mall."}
{"text":"I try to make it here at least once a week. Consistently good quality food and great service every time I've been in. Pretty good happy hour menu but I usually do their dinner for 2 promotions and Presidente margaritas."}
{"text":"Never been to Chili's? Think south western. The place is great. The food is consistently good. It has that Tex-Mex comfort that goes beyond nachoes and burgers.  Have you been to Chili's? This is just like the others. Being in Canada hasn't screwed it up. It is normal.   While I was there, I checked in using YELP and I was given a free coupon. I showed my phone the waiter and I was given complimentary tortilla chips and salsa. Thanks YELP!"}
{"text":"On a fun day of random-adventures with a rental car, my grew-up-in-the-States boyfriend saw the sign for Chili's.  I decided not to be my usual restaurant-snob self and let him choose.  Unfortunately neither of us left happy.  Warning: the following review is very restaurant-snobbish.  This reviewer is clearly spoiled by Toronto choices  When we walked in, I was immediately struck by how so many chain restaurants look so similar.  Big signs all over the huge space, cartoon-y images, even the tables.  Opening the menu I was kind of surprised though - for lunch, there was nothing under $10.  I was really hoping to get something light (to save money for future better restaurants), and figured since it was a chain there was a good chance they would have cheaper options.  I ordered the cheapest thing that looked appealing and somewhat filling: a turkey club sandwich.  The boyfriend ordered the Grilled chicken sandwich.    We got our meals shortly after...and wow.  Flavour, presentation, uniqueness....all completely absent.  I could have made that club sandwich when I was 12 years old.  It was basically on Wonder bread!  The fries, I'll admit, had good seasoning.  It's too bad they were completely undercooked and limp.  Not undercooked to the point of being raw, just not at all crispy - they drooped when picked up.  I didn't try my DP's sandwich, and I'm usually all over everyone else's food.  Zero interest this time.    The boyfriend kept apologizing for the choice, but it wasn't his fault.  Apparently they've gone seriously downhill in the last few years.   All in all...if you're thinking of stopping in here, keep driving."}
{"text":"My husband and I love to go to Chilis for a quick, easy, good meal. This is the second time we have been to this location and I'm sad to say I am not impressed. We moved here a year ago and the Chilis we used to go to was always on point. Our last experience was similar to this one. The waitress was nice enough but the food was not good. I ordered the new chicken crispers salad that was completely drenched and soggy. Not to mention there was barely any lettuce on the plate! I really wanted a nice salad but there was a small handful of lettuce! The salad was almost $11... way overpriced for the amount of food. The chicken was ok but a little soggy. My husband ordered the quesadilla explosion salad which was also so drenched he couldn't finish it. Also, my side of the both was also uneven and kept moving the entire meal and the little checkout thing at the table was broken. We both left hungry and disappointed. Unfortunately I don't think we will be back... there are plenty of other great restaurants in the area to dine at."}
{"text":"Love the Chicken Crispers!  The staff is always friendly and fast.  My stories make the restaurant not just a place to eat food, but a destination and hangout.  Additionally, it's a great place for a date.  The only Chili's date I've ever had was in October 2005 at lunchtime with Shauna.  The date went well although not exceptionally well.  The highlight was at the end in the parking lot.  She told me she liked my Pro-Bush policy sticker on my car thinking it was funny (Yes, I still liked President Bush in 2005, but by 2008, I realized Bush was mostly a failure.  However, I still support that particular policy today).  I told her that I was nervous about mentioning politics because I figured you might be a liberal.  The parking lot was the best part of the date.  I'd like to have an even better date story at Chili's in 2010 with Aubrey; we just had our third date tonight, which went very well and seems to be a bidding relationship.  Another memory of Chili's was also in Fall 2005 while at ASU.  I would hang out with friends from my major between my afternoon and walk to my evening class next door in the Design Building.   An El Presidente Margarita or two made my Environmental Planning class much more interesting.  One day in September 2005, one month before the Shauna date, I told the server, Angela, \"Has anyone told you that you look like Lindsay Lohan?\"  She smiled saying, \"Yes, I get that all the time.\"  Wittingly, I had the perfect response.  \"Except your more pretty than her.\"  Blushing, she said, \"Thanks, that is so sweet of you.\"  My friends said that I had major guts.  We all left to go to our environmental planning class, but the story does not end there.  The night class was practically next door to the Chili's.  For the first 30 minutes of class, we met our groups.  I told the group that I had to use the restroom, but I actually ran back to Chili's.  I had an ingenious plan.  I ran back in and dropped my CPS unit on the ground where I was sitting.    When Angela came out, I told her, \"I came back because I left my CPS unit here.\"    She said, \"I'll go back and look in lost and found.\"    After she went to lost and found, I picked it up, and she came back about three minutes later.  I said, \"Oh, never mind, I found it.\"    She said, \"Usually, they are really good about retrieving left items.\"  I said, \"Hey, Angela, you seem really cool.  Do you want to get coffee sometime?\"    Of course it was the same old story, \"I have a boyfriend.\"  And I said, \"I didn't know, but it was worth a try, right?\"  She totally agreed.    The conclusion to draw from my story is that somehow I graduated Magna Cum Laude from ASU in May 2006 after leaving class and pulling a stunt like that."}
{"text":"We ordered through their online service. The earliest option to pick our food up was about 15 minutes after We placed the order. I out the pick up about 40 minutes out from when I ordered it. My husband was there before the 7 o'clock pick up time didn't pay until 20 after and they said our food wasn't ready. At one point my husband asked again if she had missed his food and she said she must have lost the order. Turns out our food had been sitting there for 40 minutes and she was calling the WRONG name (even after my husband asked her at one point if that happened to be our order and she said no). She then picked up the food and called the correct name. My husband refused to take the food because it has been sitting there for so long. We understand it's busy but when you can't even process the people in line in a quick manner everything is going to fall apart."}
{"text":"Chili's is a branch of the US restaurant located in Vaughan, Ontario - hometown of the worst drivers in Canada.  If you don't get run over by a paisano going through the 4-way stop out of turn in his Ford F150 you're on your way to good food, and poor service.  This restaurant has been The Red Devil, and East Side Mario's in it prior existance.  We came here on a Saturday afternoon to celebrate my son's birthday.  Our group of 9 was seated promptly.  SERVICE Our drink order was taken quickly.  However it took 20+ minutes for our collection of soda and chocolate milk to arrive at our table.  At one point my daughter was asked if she wanted a refill on her chocolate milkshake.  We should have been told that it was not a free refill. Our order of bottomless nacho chips and salsa arrived at our table less than 10 min before our entree did, so we weren't really able to enjoy it. The ice cream for the kids arrived well before my son's birthday brownie slice.  About 20% of the ice cream was melted by the time the brownie arrived. I think the manager overheard us complaining about how incompetant our server was, so we were compensated 2 lava cake desserts for the table. Final point - if you're going to automatically include a 15% gratuity on the bill, can you please ensure the service merits that kind of gratuity.  My parents taught me to be a 10% tipper, and I will tip 15% only when either the food was amazing or the server went out of their way for us.  FOOD My son had the mac and cheese and loved it.  Older daughter had the grilled cheese and devoured it.  Youngest daughter had the cheese pizza - I tried a taste and it was icky.  I think it was a microwave pizza from M&Ms.  The wife had the honey chicken crispers.  She felt they were comparable to the Chili's in Buffalo (that's a good thing).  I had the Jalepeno Smokehouse burger.  If you like a burger that's a balance between pain and pleasure - then you've found it.  You have the heat from the Jalepeno's offset by the taste of the bacon.  For dessert we were compensated a chocolate lava cake.  It was darn good, especially the lava.  On its own, the food could have netted 3.5 stars.  Service and Ambiance killed this.  AMBIANCE The restaurant was good.  Well lit, fairly new feel to it. The men's washroom was a different story.  One of the urinals was broken and spewing water all over the place.  Putting a caution wet floor sign up doesn't really cover you from slip and fall lawsuits.  If the plumbing were up to current code, someone with a wrench could have shut off the water flow from the urinal, and the entire washroom floor wouldn't have been a mess.  I had brought this to the manager's attention.  I was told that she had to wait her her guy.  I'm assuming it was someone under contract to corporate.  Managers should have the power to call whomever they want.  This is a business and there are a lot of 24-hour plumbing services that would be willing to help out.  There has to be a balance between frugality and maintaining the image of the business."}
{"text":"My guilty pleasure go-to place for junk food when I am having a shit week or after a big test. Sure it is a chain but that means consistency. Don't expect Wolfgang Puck flair when you just need a quick and easy bite. The location is super-convenient for students and for those who work on Mill."}
{"text":"This Chili's seems to be so hit or miss -- sometimes I've gotten great service, had the food come out quickly, and was happy to tip 20% or more.  But then about every other time, we seem to get an \"I'm too cool to be in the food industry\" frat boy turned waiter who is completely blase, takes forever to get our orders, disappears for 20 minutes at a time, doesn't know the menu, and to be honest, is a complete jack ass.  The food? It's average, but you know what you're going to get. It's worth it when there is a deal, or when I have a coupon. Otherwise, not worth the risk of shoddy service, empty glasses and cold food."}
{"text":"I love Chili's! And this place has excellent service. The waiters/waitresses are attentive and really nice when you use coupons. Definitely one of the better Chili's locations I've been to!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was OK. Our food was alright and the servers were *VERY* attentive (I say very because it was a bit off-puting when the waitress runs away with a huge smile on her face and asked us three times if we need anything and how our food is..in addition to the manager coming around to ask us if we need anything. We began to question if the restaurant was in trouble.) Overall, the food is what you expect from a chain restaurant--nothing to write home about. It's worth the visit but I'm not sure we will be back. With all the options in Toronto, I hardly ever return a restaurant unless it really knocks my socks off!"}
{"text":"It was my first time at Chili's and I had high expectations. I guess the bar was raised too high or I just picked the wrong menu item? I had the guilt free buffalo chicken sandwich- it was Luke warm like they microwaved it and there was no flavor at all in it. My friend ordered the Texan jalapeño fries or something like that- he said it was alright but that the dip was the best part...I must agree. Again probably just the wrong menu items although the other review have me doubting that as well. However.. (drum roll please..) their salsa which they make from scratch I found rather tasty! Thus, earning 3 stars!"}
{"text":"My good friend and I went for lunch. We were seated right away and the waitress was really friendly. She was ok with taking our orders right and bringing our drinks on time.The only thing was that for an american restaurant it was quite dissapointing...the portions were not \"american-sized\" and their take on south of the border meals was not authentic..or even close...I had nachos and i won't go back.My friend had fajitas and they were the same as you'd get at kelseys and jack astors...so u pay $20 for fajitas and all these places are all the same. If u want a GOOD fajita...go to LONE STAR TEXAS GRILL!!!!  I don't see myself going back to chilis."}
{"text":"A sentimental favorite, not only for the chicken ranch sandwich (crispy breaded chicken breast w/tangy wing sauce, cool Ranch dressing, lettuce & tomato), but also because at 16, I met my first Pinoy boyfriend here (he was the busboy).  It didn't last, obviously, but I'll always look back on that moment fondly. You know, before he dumped me on my birthday and asked for his jacket back."}
{"text":"Been to better Chilli's for sure. The staff here is usually nice and seem to be helpful, but I have had major issues with food quality and slowness recently. The last 3 visits we had something go wrong, whether it was a long wait for food or the food arriving under cooked. It seems that the kitchen staff needs to get their act together."}
{"text":"I'm sticking to my 5-star review! I don't understand why this place has a horrible star rating.   We've been here a dozen times and it's always great. I've never had a bad meal or bad service.   We came in again last night for dinner and like normal we get the 2 for $20 deal. We always get the chips, salsa and guacamole. I'm unsure why someone would just order the chips and salsa when you can get the amazing guac for the same price. I'm not kidding on it being amazing, it's loaded with yummy avocados and CORN.   James ordered the fajitas and had comments like, \"wow, these onions are cooked perfectly\" and \"mmmmm this chicken sure is good\".   I had the grilled chicken salad, it's the right amount of food for the price.   We'll be back...many more times!"}
{"text":"I can't say that I've ever had a bad experience at this particular Chili's. That being said, they have definitely stepped up their game. Our waitress was Savannah and boy was she amazing. She thought about bringing sides of ranch for my daughter before we even did! Drinks were great and she seemed like an expert on the menu. She even helped me choose my meal which was the sirloin with grilled avocado. Never thought I'd say it, but it could have been one of the best I've ever had. And I think I paid $12 for it! I used one of the frequently emailed coupons for a free appetizer as well!! Overall, I felt very welcomed here, food was amazing as was the service! If you're skeptical, give them a shot!!!"}
{"text":"Went here last night for date night with my hubby. The staff was super friendly.  They opened the door for us and were very fast with seating us and getting us our food. Amanda was our server. She was ao nice and took such good care of us. The prices are great and so is the food. The portions are awesome, I always get to take home food for lunch the next day. I love this place."}
{"text":"If there was a no star button trust me that would have been my choice. Lets start off by saying I usually I'm not one to do reviews yet after tonight I couldn't keep my mouth shut. When arriving there their was a small wait understandable it's Friday night yet that doesn't justify TERRIBLE service our server forgot about us and took a food order from a table that sat after us, once our food arrived only the plates where burning hot but not the food, my kids mandarins had CHEESE and CILANTRO! When explain the situation we didn't get an apology from the server and manger on duty. HORRIBLE customer service !!!"}
{"text":"I love Chili's having worked there for about 4 years in a past life, I grew accustomed to their menu, and Brownie Sundae!  of which is the absolute Bomb.  I think Chili's has some really good food for a chain restaurant.  Snazzed up the Chicken Sandwich the last time around.  Super good.  The Chicken Nachos are awesome as well.  Fajita's rock.  What is there not to like."}
{"text":"First time here was also the last time. I came here for lunch to meet up with my Aunts on a Monday afternoon. The place was pretty packed, but they seemed to be staffed pretty well, however...you wouldn't know that with the service we received.  12:00 (noon) - I walked in and found where my Aunts were sitting. Sat down, was greeted by the waitress immediately and ordered my drink.  12:15 - ordered my $8 mini burger plate with fries.  12:30 - tables around us finished eating and new customers sat down, then ordered.  12:45 - new customers received their food...we were still waiting for ours...   1:00pm - after several apologies from the waitress, and several trips she took to the kitchen to find out where the hell our food was, we ended up deciding to take the meal to go.  1:15pm - we finally got our meal, to go. Thankfully the waitress said the bill was on them, and apologized for the unusual wait.   The only reason I'm giving this place 2 stars, and not 1, is because the bill was taken care of and we didn't have to pay for an hour long wait with no food. Also, I was tweeting about the service, and the @chilis twitter account wanted details, and tried to help during the last 10-15 minutes there. Oh, the food was decent. It's what you would expect from any other Chili's."}
{"text":"Have you ever gotten to a restaurant and then wanted to stab yourself in the hand with a fork? Me neither.  This was my reaction to chilis. I don't ever remember this local neighborhood joint being tasty, but the boyfriend and I edge starving and decided to give it a whirl.   Our whirl was consistent of waiting in the lobby for over 5 minutes for the hostess to acknowledgments us. Not sure where she was but we waited patiently. As a side note, it was 9 pm, and we were the only folks on the lobby.  When we finally got our table, the table was still wet from being cleaned. This does not feel good when one is wearing shorts. The menus were disgusting. They were sticky, ripped, faded, food stuck on gross.  Needless to say we actually walked out of the restaurant.  One star only because I cant put zero and the waitress didn't ask us to pay for our iced tea."}
{"text":"We were hungry and I was thinking Chili's would be much like Applebee's. You know great food and service? Well boy was I wrong.  The restaurant was super loud and it was difficult to talk. We were hungry and ordered  Nachos. Seems like an easy plate to make, but they bring us 5 chips (no kidding!) with beans and cheese on them (sort of like mini cheese crisps). The presentation was horrible, they tasted even worse. I end up ordering a chicken salad and my friend something like a rice black bean bowl. I was brought a huge salad that looked awful and tasted worse. Just wilted lettuce and chicken (that tasted like it was old). I ate two bites and had had enough. The waitress had no desire to provide us with any level of service and kept on coming back to us almost rushing us to leave. This was almost the worse dining experience ever! Stay Away! $30 for a awful appetizer and two entrees. Never again."}
{"text":"If you just need a quick lunch it's probably okay to go here, but NEVER go here at 3pm-4pm. There will be no one to seat you. And worse, i forgot my credit card and the server doesnt even know.. Drove 30mins to go back here and forgot to bring ID so they got to asked all sort of questions. The food is okay, but the server wont refill you until you ask."}
{"text":"I'm sorry. I'm not ashamed. I love Chili's  Went here for lunch with my mom The service was better than most fine dining restaurants. Friendly, fast, efficient, tasty.... what more can you want???"}
{"text":"Had dinner with the girls before our Evita engagement at the ASU Gammage. We only had about 45 minutes until the show starts. They got us in and out really fast, this is when they were busy! Wife and I shared their triple platter, came with burger sliders, potato wedges, and their chipotle boneless wings. Very good! Glad we opt to eat here, their crew were very courteous, and knew we had a time limit and got us out!"}
{"text":"The staff was so nice and everything was cook cooked well and fast. They're new \"tablets\" are helpful seeing what the meal looks like and helps paying a breeze."}
{"text":"I never thought I would be giving a review on a restaurant in the airport. But I must give acknowledgement to the great service and food at Chili's Bar & Grill at the Charlotte Airport. I has a simple turkey sandwich, fries and my Arnold Palmer and it was absolutely delicious. The server was very attentive and timely. This will be my restaurant of choice when I have a layover in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in quite some time but my daughter got a gift certificate and I decided to try it shin and Unfortunately my experience here was not so good again.. Ordered the Tito's punch & it was watered down with no alcohol taste, ordered the low calorie steak with avocado medium n it cane in medium well I told the waiter and he said well u ate a lot of it (its only a 6 oz with 2 ounces of fat) or else I would've told my manager.. Really! Ya I'm done with chillis all together..!  So many other restaurants to choose from.."}
{"text":"My family and I were quite disappointed with our meal at this Chili's, located in the Charlotte airport. We were starving and had a lengthy lay-over here, so in we came. Despite half the tables being unoccupied when we arrived, the hostess still sat us at the rear of the restaurant, by the bar. The table was tall, with high bar stools and a ceiling vent right overhead, blowing out freezing cold air. We were shivering. And although the table looked clean, there was a sticky, tacky clear syrup all over the table. I only discovered this when I picked up my napkin and my hand became sticky. We called the waiter over, who then sent someone else to wipe down the entire table.  And the food was really sub-par. I ordered a breakfast dish with hash browns, but no spicy spices in the potatoes (the waiter said no problem, they could do this). When our orders all came out later (after a fairly long wait), my hash browns did have the spices on it. Something wasn't right with my hubby's order (although I forget what the issue was). And the prices were really high, for breakfast dishes. In retrospect, we definitely would have gotten our breakfast at the bagel shop further down in the terminal. And I have to mention the coffee: it was horrible. Neither my husband or my teen kids would have it. We all thought it was really bad (and my kids LOVE coffee, especially because we rarely let them drink it). Even they passed on the coffee, after sampling a sip. That alone speaks volumes.   It took a while to get our check, too, despite the place being half empty.  A disappointment, all around. But at least the place was clean."}
{"text":"I recently went into the Chili's on 7th st and Bell in Phoenix and had a nice experience. It was a friday night so it was busy of course but we only had to wait about 15 minutes to sit down, if that. Our waitress, i cant remember her name but she was a young blonde girl, she was very personable and helpful. My step dad is a handful (he likes to joke a lot) and she handle him very well and laughed along with us. She was also very helpul with the menu and the questions we had towards it. Last but not least, its VERY important to me to have a drink refilled pretty soon after its been emptied because I drink a lot when i eat and she was very on top of my drink.  It was great."}
{"text":"We live close to Chili's so we occasionally will eat here for convenience! It's the typical Chili's experience. Host greet and seat you- they were friendly! Our server Angela was very upbeat and friendly as well! The place was hopping due to the holiday weekend, but our service was prompt and our food came quickly also! I'm a fan of their ribs, and my husband loves hamburgers- so they have things for all appetites! Granted it's noisy with lots of families and tots crying but that's family dining. The food was very good, with fresh ingredients and large portions. If you want a casual dining experience and food food Chili's is a nice option!"}
{"text":"Ok so I am on vacation and generally love to try the local hot spots.  But we decided to come to Chillis.  After all I did want ribs.  Our service was pretty good.  He recomened a few late night hot spots and brought me a great local beer.  Devil ale I belive. A great hoppy little beer.  The ribs were.. well they are what you come to expect.    Chillis has great queso dip and friendly emplpyees  it was a good choice."}
{"text":"If someone asked me what I thought of Chili's, I'd say  \"Chili's reminds me of my childhood. Walking on Jumierah Beach, we'd go here after for the unlimited chips and salsa...and for every occasion we had to have the molten Lava Cake...  Seriously though, Chili's was my favourite place growing up in Dubai. It's everyone's . We love it there. (Too bad they don't serv the alchz there)  So when I heard that they opened up here in Canada, I got mad teary eyed and grabbed all my friends from Dubai and we headed over here.  The menu was almost the same,  I was so happy.  So we got the trio appz to start (called The Triple Play)  which was the texmex egg rolls, wings and chicken crispers)  Firstly, In Dubai you get wings, the egg rolls and the dip. WTF with the crispers.   They were okay. Definitely not what I remembered.   To eat, I got the Chicken Crispers meal with the Corn on cob, mashed potatoes, and Chicken Gravy.  The Chicken was maaaad salty. The Gravy tasted like despair. But I think that's just how I feel abut chicken gravy anyways.  My friend got th fajitas, which were relaly good.  And ofcourse, we had to have the piece du resistance, the MCLC (Molten Choco Lava Cake)  It was a tad bit burnt, but otherwise...just like we remembered it.   We've been back a few times...mostly for the MCLC.  And the Sangria in the summer. I drank like three pitchers of that in one sitting. Also, the friend I was with at that time didn't drink. I'm not an alcoholic."}
{"text":"Lets play a game: What are restaurants associated with? McDonald's......... the Big Mac Burger King......... the WHOPPER Denny's....... (drunk) breakfast anytime Olive Garden...... unlimited bread sticks, salad and soup And finally, Chili's...... The awesome blossom!!!  Guess which one of those restaurants/fast-food joints have lowered themselves from passing grades to a mere one star standard? That's right Chili's removing the Awesome Blossom from their menu, not cool man. In fact, that is uncouth, un-american, un-awesome. We were giving eyeteeth for those perfectly sliced, breaded, deep-fried, stank-breathed onion bites with the horseradish sauce all week.  Now we know what you are thinking: \"C'mon guys you cannot base an entire chain of restaurants solely on one appetizer, now can you\".  Yes, we can; and we did. How are you going to discontinue the commodity that made you? You don't see Dave waking up one day saying, \"Ya know, think we are going to murder the Frosty; yup, put a big fork in it: DEAD\". It's the establishment doing away with the establishment. I know, back-ass-ward; and it hurts a little.     So what are you know Chili's: an over-salted, priorly frozen, submerged in fat, microwaved-to-perfection (without the awesome blossom) chain lost in the sea of other over-priced with low quality American chains; that has lost her only \"it-factor\". Kudos on that."}
{"text":"Chili's is a great place not only for a quick meal and hang time with friends, but especially for the days when your wallet is light. Everything on the menu is delicious and simple. The best times I've had there are the times when I was hanging out with a friend or two and catching up.  Yeah, you can do that almost anywhere.  But Chili's invite it right away.  And it's open till midnight.  Chili's is a great place to chill."}
{"text":"First off, let me explain what the HELL I was doing at a horrible chain restaurant (I don't even feel comfortable calling this pre-fab big box pre-frozen place a \"restaurant\"). I just started a job in Office Space near by on Elliot and needed a place I could get to, get served and get out within an hour with my friend on my dinner break. As we cruised Elliot, the lights blinking of Wal Marts, Costcos, JcPennys, and all the gruesome fast food chains like a garish consumerist Las Vegas, I decided on Chillis b/c at least their memory had not been horrendous.   The last time I ate at one of these, it was TEN years ago-when I was 17. It was next to Borders Books in NJ, and I thought it was kind of sophisticated (hey, I had been brought up on Malls, okay?).   The decor of this place confused me. The bar is right at the entrance with a supremely low ceiling. Seated at a tall table with some plush booths on the side and surrounded by five televisions, the waiter was fast with the iced teas. The bar was actually designed kind of cool, with beers in ice on the bar, kind of like the practice of picking out lobsters out of tanks. The drinks were disgusting looking (not our iced teas-they were fine-if served in PLASTIC beer mugs) in the menu, with all drinks mysteriously splashing and semen-resembling.  The decor...okay, there were also windows that looked out back into the restaurant...I mean I don't understand. Is it supposed to be bohemian? Like a \"mexican shack\"? Country? The decor confuses me instead of comforts me. I feel like I am in a bad stage set of a western town, like a rompus room for tourist's kids or something.  We ended up with Southwestern Egg Rolls (which has like pureed chicken in it) and I did sneak a taste (yummy in the worst for you way-better than I remembered-but guarenteed to make my vegetarian stomach shrivel up and die) and the chocolate molten cake, which was OUT OF CONTROL. A fucking huge chocolate cake with hot fudge stuff inside a huge dent, with a large vanilla scoop of ice cream encased in a hard chocolate shell.   These things were fine, standard, but expensive. Do people realize they are paying like 7 bucks for an appetizer and like 6 bucks for a dessert they could get a LOT more for their money at an independent \"real\" restaurant?  The stars go to the service-all nice, helpful, and not in a scary generic way.   As David B. said...this Chilli's isn't a lot different than the one on Mill...or anywhere else in the world."}
{"text":"Worst dining experience ever. NFC AFC championship games playing and very few customers in the restaurant. Food was not cooked to order. Brought out the wrong food. Not once. Twice. Kitchen was a complete disarray. Wait staff had no idea what was going on. Server was trying her hardest but to no avail. Absolute disaster."}
{"text":"Very nice inside and our server was attentive. The food was great; we both ordered off the lite menu and we were very impressed. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever not only did I sit 30 minutes longer waiting for my food while people were coming in and ordering and getting your food before I did we got the food back home I forgot to put the dipping sauces for our chicken crispers along with the chicken crispers being soggy and cold or cold are appetizer that they up sold us on it was also cold and been sitting for awhile when you can tell and Jamie the manager would not replace my meals or comp them for me so I will never step foot back in that establishment again with that type of customer service or management hope they get their stuff together because I wasn't loyal customer for 20 years never again what a waste of $25 all I wanted was to replace my meals"}
{"text":"Comfort food at normal off airport prices.  Leanne took good cate of us and kept our drinks filled. The food came fast and tasted good although the portion size seemed a little smaller than off airport. Overall good food at a good value."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Chili's when I visited it in New Jersey, so imagine my excitement when it's announced that a Chili's is opening a mere 20 minutes away from home. No more pulling out my passport just for some fajitas.   However, like most things that cross the border up to the Great White North, it just didn't feel the same. The moment we walked in, we were warned that the wait would be long. \"Long\", as I was told when I asked what that meant, was supposed to be around a half-hour. Definitely long, but reasonable considering it was around 6pm and dinner service was sure to ramp up.  My girlfriend and I stood there, as there isn't really anywhere to sit when you're forced to wait inside the doorway as not to get in the way of people walking to and fro in front of you. About an hour later, we were finally seated.   I don't know why I waited that long for a table with all the other options so nearby, but we did. We were determined to simulate the great experience we had in Jersey as best as possible. The good news was, we were right next to the kitchen. No excuse to miss us.  They did. A bunch of times.  We sat there for about another half-hour before someone finally came and asked us what drinks we wanted. Having all the time to review the menu much too thoroughly, we decided to order our entrees as well.  I got the fajitas, as I would State-side, and I have to say that they were pretty good. Just not good enough to wait the extra 45 minutes it took for the meal to get to us.   At 9pm, we finally got the bill and got the hell out of the packed Chili's. What was supposed to be a quick meal ended up being a three hour test of our patience. Good for them, I'm a sucker for branding and I waited through that mess.   I hope the service improves because the food is actually quite good, but if I can get to a Chili's in New Jersey before I'm seated in Vaughan, it's definitely not worth visiting this Chili's."}
{"text":"A quick stop with 7 people.  Host greeted and made a special attempt to seat us in the bar area. Our waitress was wonderful.  Cheerful, quick and always one step a head of our needs.  We visit many Chili's and this one we recommend.  Thank you for great service, food and price."}
{"text":"Queso dip is media oker. Cheese cake is good, the trio is good."}
{"text":"Oh Chili's. You really let me down this past Friday night. From the cheese fries being old (as if they had been reheated and reserved)  to the cooler than average steak. I did send the cheese fries back  and got a piping hot new order but I didn't send back the steak for fear of what may have been done to it after sending back the fries and also for fear that it would come out a hockey puck. I will say that even though it was not as warm as it should have been, it was at least cooked to perfection.  I will say that I was not the only patron sending food back in my area. The table in front and beside me also sent back food for various reasons. At least I wasn't alone in my food unhappiness. Eh I may come back again someday but you are not on my go to list anytime soon."}
{"text":"It's a must to pay a visit to my local neighborhood Chili's located in the Moon Valley area. Was greeted at the door immediately and seated right away, which is nice when hungry! For the first time I ordered the chicken/steak fajitas with black beans and rice. I do like how the came out at an appropriate time and how the plate and metal skillet with sizzling! The smells of the the meats mixed with the pepper and onions is so distinct. I was very impressed with the authenticity of the plate, comparable to a Mexican restaurant. Set aside had a good dinner and got a chance to watch the NHL finals at the same time."}
{"text":"There is finally a Chili's in the Toronto area! Chili's brings back a lot of great childhood memories for me and this Chili's had all the new digs with a touch of the old stuff that made it fun.  Ever see those Chili's commercials where the hostess opens the doors and says \"Hi, welcome to Chili's!\" in a super friendly way? Well that is exactly the way I was greeted coming here. I was a little taken aback by how much the hostess resembled the girl in the commercial. Then another hostess opened the second set of doors smiling happily saying hello. Then at the podium we were greeted by the third hostess who was to show us to our seats. I though it was a bit of overkill to have so many hostesses but I did like how welcoming it was and how I didn't have to open the door.  Walking in I was surrounded by the familiar sights and smells of Chili's. Random things on the walls, sizzling fajitas, sports on TV, red and yellow almost everywhere, and a bad ass margarita bar. This margarita bar, although a regular bar, looks cooler than most bars seen at chain restaurants because of the addition of a giant blue neon sign. Just the sight of this sign alone makes you want a margarita.  I sat in the bar area since the dining room was full and extremely busy. I thought the service would be lacking since it was packed inside and because we were in the bar area but the service was as on top of their game as the hostesses opening the doors. Service was literally full of smiles; our waitress had a permanent smile on her face and seemed extremely happy to be here. She seemed genuinely happy to be there and genuinely friendly but having everyone else in the establishment act the same made it almost surreal. I thought to myself that they must have an awesome training program.  The food was good. It's your typical American chain restaurant choices with monster salads, sandwiches, burgers, steaks, ribs, and fajitas. The menu is absolutely monstrous! I had a very hard time deciding what I wanted because it all sounded good and there were plenty of pictures to boot so every turn of the page would change your mind.   I had a turkey club. It tasted great but was soggy from the amount butter smeared on the slices of toasted bread. I didn't even realize there was a piece of bread in the middle until half way through because it became soaking wet and molded with the turkey. The fries were not the same that I remember as a kid growing up in Texas. Although they had that great seasoning to them they weren't crispy at all and seemed a little under done. The place is new and they are probably still training their kitchen staff, so I can let it slide for now.  Overall, this is probably one of my favorite chain restaurants because they have great margaritas, tasty food, and the place reminds me of my childhood. The service is great if you can stand it and the prices are reasonable. The food needs work though, the taste is there but the execution is poor. Maybe with more time they'll iron out the kinks."}
{"text":"OH MY GOD.  I completely understand how employees want to go home and not have people walking in when they are closing; but one day my mom and my siblings came to this location maybe 2-3 hours before closing time so  we thought we were okay. NO. The waitress barely had that many people to wait on and it took her a million decades to get us anything whether it be drinks or food. You almost did not want to ask for anything just because we wanted to get the hell out of there ASAP. We already knew what we wanted for a good 30 minutes before she came back and took our order.  Then we got our order maybe another hour to an hour and a half later! SWEET. By that time my mom being the feisty little Filipino lady that she is was absolutely livid and was complaining about when we would get our food. I don't rush people yes i am irritated and hungry but i will not rush you or get loud.  God only knows what they could do to my food behind closed doors.       So after staying at this location for 2 hours or so because of the long wait for everything i am slightly scared to go back to any chilis but i love their strawberry lemonade so its hard to refuse based on one girls performance or lack of.  As i finish my review on their not good food quality and piss poor service i cannot help but notice another girl had the same issue in june and i almost wonder if we had the same female who had waited on us and literally waited before taking our orders and giving us anything. If i went to this location which i highly doubt we will, i hope to god she is or was fired because if you cannot handle a couple tables and are no where to be found majority of the time something is just not right about that.  I am sorry. This is Arizona honey work laws suck here and if you aren't a decent worker you should not have a job unless you are being a brown noser with the managers and that's the only reason you are there is one of the many reasons i hate hate HATE Arizona work laws with a passion. But that is a whole other story."}
{"text":"It's a chain restaurant what do you expect? ..... Chips and salsa to go... Watching the cowboys hot chips seems like good start"}
{"text":"This Chili's understands that people are in a rush, but want to eat something better than an overpriced premade turkey sandwich. They are quick, friendly and the food is the same quality you would get at any other Chili's. If I'm not in a full out sprint for my connecting flight, I'm stopping here when I'm in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Took my partner here for a birthday lunch. The chips were fresh and so was the food. All delicious and served by a great server. He was attentive and ensured we had all we needed. After we mentioned the birthday, he brought out to bowls of ice cream with chocolate topping, YUM!!! This resturant was clean. Keep up the great work here. You all made our lunch enjoyable."}
{"text":"I went to lunch here the other day the service was terrific the food was good. The atmosphere was very welcoming. We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Let's talk kids, about customer service and sympathy, shall we? So, I placed a to go order today with this location. I've done it in the past with no issues. Food is well prepared, service is nice enough, pretty good for a large chain eatery. Oh, but that was until today my friends. See, I accidentally forgot to delay the order at checkout (totally my mistake, I own my errors). I caught it 5 min later and called as soon as I caught it which ended up being 6 min after hitting the order button. I thought I caught it in a reasonable amount of time, considering it was supposed to be done and ready at 438pm. The first guy I talked to took up about 3 min just to check on my order to see if it could be stopped, concluding it was all currently being made. So, I was on the line for it. I asked him if there was anything they could do, since my husband was getting the food and he's off at 5. He said he'd ask the manager. A min later the manager comes on and after explaining that I made a little mistake and that I thought I had called in a reasonable amount of time he proceeded to essentially shame me for my error. He proceeded to tell me my food was done already ( about 10 min after ordering and about 15 min before the original pick up time. So I'm guessing my food would have been sitting out for 15 min, great). And that now he's have to just throw it away. He told me 3 times he was going to have to throw away the food. Are you kidding me. First of all, don't, that's a waste. I'm sure you guys can find someone to give it to. There are more than a few hungry people out there. Not to mention, I worked in the food service industry, and I know staff tend to take it home. Also being that I worked in the industry, all be it that it was a fine dining establishment, but you don't shame your customer for a very simple mistake. You do what you have to do, and you make it happen. Look, I wasn't asking for the World, and I wasn't blaming anyone but me for my error. However, I caught it quickly, and tried to correct it. In the future, this establishment's staff should consider that mistakes happen, and a little bit of understanding can go a long way. And again, I'd like to point out that my food tgat was supposedly done, would have been just sitting out for 15 min, which is also really quite terrible. You get 2 stars since you \"remade\" my order. So, uh, thanks?  **Update- it is the next day and my family has food poisoning. How do I know it was Chilis? Well, none of us ate the same food in the last few days, except Chilis. WE ARE NEVER COMING HERE AGAIN. **"}
{"text":"What's to say here?  It's another Chili's.  What you get here is the consistency of a nationwide menu so that's a good thing and something you can bank on when in need of a quick meal.  That was the case for me, traveling in and out of the airport for the last few weeks I don't like to mess around too much with meal options and I don't have time to make a bad choice.  Chili's is the answer for me.  I sat at the bar and the service was prompt.  The salad I had came out quick and it was nothing less than fresh and plentiful.  Can't really hate on any of that, it just doesn't leave you with a \"wow\" feeling, nor should it really."}
{"text":"In this case I ordered take out and I knew what I wanted because I've ordered it before, which was the regular burger with a black bean burger instead of the meat. I knew I loved it before and I was hoping it was going to be the same as last. That was not the case, this one tasted a bit more mexican-y, which means the seasoning added it caused it to taste different and it had a salsa taste to it. I didn't like it at all. I wish it had been like the one I had before.  The inside is really nice, I will give it that. All the waitress are very typical college girls. I think that Chili's should have a different attire because all the girls wore was jeans and a Chili's t-shirt, I think it would be more down to earth if they gave them a little freedom and dressed how they'd like (keep in mind I don't mean get out of control and dress slutty for more tips) it was just boring what they were wearing.  The girl that dealt with my order was nice at first and then she realized I was paying with cash not card, which means she thought I wasn't going to tip her and her attitude changed completely. So that lead me to not give her a tip, I always tip those that deal with the take-out orders because I used to do it at a Restaurant too and it sucked that people didn't realize I did as much work if not more as all the other servers, yet I was tipped nothing. If only she didn't act that way."}
{"text":"Not only did we have amazing service ... wish I knew her name.. but I left behind some very important documents on the table and the staff turned them in to the manager and I was able to get them back, which I couldn't be more grateful  for. God bless an honest and efficient staff thank you so much!"}
{"text":"I've visited Chili's in the good old U.S. of A., so I was excited to see that the chain was pushing into Canada. After dining here.....I'm not that excited anymore.  Let me preface this by stating that I haven't dined here in about a year, as my last experience was so disappointing that I swore I would never go back. Our group of 4 all remember the last time as a deal killer.  On our last visit the place was a jumpin'. We had a nominal wait for a table and while waiting we thought to ourselves...\"This is great....a busy restaurant is usually a sign of good food\"  Wrong. The waiter was awful. His approach was off putting from the get go (he had someone trailing him so I would assume he was training someone??). Wrong person to do so. His was very robotic/unfriendly and didn't seem to really like working there. He commented to the person with him how he couldn't wait to get out of there. After tasting the food, I now understand what he was taking about. Anyways, we asked a question about a menu item and the sigh that came from the guy was audible to Vancouver....  Once we ordered, the food took forever to come out. When it did, it was not HOT, it was lukewarm. It also tasted like cardboard...absolutely no flavour considering the place is called Chilis. We did not complain to our waiter due to his already foul mood and besides, once our food was in front of us we never saw him again except when we flagged him down to get our bill. We did not finish our meals (a good waiter would have picked up on the fact that 4 people left half their meals on their plates and would ask.....but not ours).  We paid our bill (which was pricey considering the quality of what we got).  Sorry if I can't be more specific about what we ordered, etc....but it has been a while since I've been here. The whole experience was not pleasant at all and that is what we remember the most."}
{"text":"I typically consider Chili's to be generic, nothing special. However, today my expectations were met with above and beyond service. Tim, our waiter, was exceptional. He was attentive, nice, and made our visit fun. We did the 2 for $22, which is a great deal. Our order was taken quickly and served quickly as well. Tim checked on us throughout. The food was great, and generous portions."}
{"text":"one of my fave's, everything i've eaten there was amazing, love the chicken sandwich and i substitute my fries for a cup of tortilla soup."}
{"text":"This Chili's location in the Charlotte airport (near the B security checkpoint) is now closed. It has very recently been remodeled and is now \"A Taste of Carolina\" which is apparently all about draft beer."}
{"text":"Chili's were all over the suburbs of my former hometown of Chicago and I did not think much of them.  However, on a visit to this one, I was pleasantly surprised.  The decor was more cheerful and modern, the owner greeted us personally, the staff was very solicitous, and the food seemed better than the ones in the states.  Of course, they have very good Margaritas."}
{"text":"Chili's is pretty good for a mainstream restraunt chain. I like that patio out back, normally pretty cheap and they always send you cool coupons for free stuff in your email. I'll always come back here every once in awhile"}
{"text":"Not usually a huge fan of places like this, but this location is a good lunch spot. I always sit at the bar where they have a ton of TVs, and the service is prompt. I can typically be in and out in 40 minutes, which isn't bad for a full service restaurant.   They have great chips and salsa, pretty good burgers, and my personal favorite: honey chipotle chicken crispers...Long name, but a tasty lunch food.  They have good lunch deals and combos, and some good dinner stuff, and a good happy hour. I don't think I'd be quick to come here for a dinner date, and since it's a chain, for better or worse you know what you're getting each time. That said, for a quick lunch during the week it's a good option."}
{"text":"Great service tonight. We got a free dessert just by showing our phone with retailmenot.   We had the triple dippers and the new Southwest Pairings, which I highly recommend. Only negative was a very loud lady in the nearby booth."}
{"text":"Showed up rather late on a Sunday night, and we all had a blast.  Sat in the bar area.  Savannah was our server and she was just great, what a good sense of humor. The drinks were excellent, the food was wonderful, and we'll go back again, no doubt."}
{"text":"Look, it's Chilli's, The food is decent (you know we all love those chicken crispers) and it's totally kid friendly. That's why it gets 4 stars. I didn't wait in line for more than 5 minutes. I called ahead for a table. The kid got the mac and cheese, which he pounded. Mom and Dad got to talk. Everybody ate, chatted, and enjoyed themselves without meltdowns. For that alone, it's worth 4 stars!"}
{"text":"My husband and I come here for the great service at the bar and the margaritas. I must say that Victoria is the BEST bartender I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. She knows what we drink, and she even orders my salmon well done without me having to ask. I am comfortable enough to sit at the bar by myself when I know Victoria is going to be there. It's a chain restaurant, but she makes you feel like it's a small family owned restaurant. Dave will also take good care of you. The food is always tasty and I appreciate the additions to the menu."}
{"text":"Annoyed.   Tried take out from this Chili's twice. It's not like I expect the moon and the stars. Just what I ordered. Edible food is also high on the priority list.   First time, got my food later than requested. They forgot my sides. The food was good enough, though I would never recommend the turkey burger to anyone. Dry and sad. Chips are waif thin and I kind of like that, along with the giant bag they give you. I had chip snacks for days.  Second time, we got everything requested and relatively at the pickup time. But it was soggy. The fries were inedible. My raccoon of a toddler refused to eat the chicken fingers, and he freaking loves chicken fingers. In fact, he also loves fries and it only took one bite to know that he was not riding that train either.   I know it's supposed to be three strikes and you're out, but I don't know if I can handle another shot here. I can only take so much disappointment in my life, sorry Chili's."}
{"text":"SO SO sad..............without warning this location is NOW CLOSED."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan a big chain restaurants, but I can always count on Chili's.  When my wife and I were dating, we would usually go here once a week for chips and salsa and buffalo wings and a couple of drinks. Now that we are married, it is still a good place to go if your looking for some quick decent food."}
{"text":"Pretty good spot for drink specials and to catch the game.. Everybody nice there.. No complaints"}
{"text":"One of the better Chili's I've been to.  Both the food and service were good and no one in our large group had any complaints.  I recommend the Crispy Chicken Tacos."}
{"text":"This is the best place to snag some free parking on mill! This Chili's is always busy always.But surprisingly I have never had to wait very long or at all. My room-mate and I came here the other day after a long day of lease signing and ordered the chicken fingers which are OK. My only problem was my corn on the cob was extremely cold gross! I remember eagerly biting into it only to find the surprising corn and cold corn juice squirting in my mouth. It was not pleasant.Our waiter didn't't seem to care when we told him, but he did offer to bring us some more."}
{"text":"I came here because I had not been to a Chilis in years. Wow. Quality is iffy at best for the cost. I know they used to cook the chicken, now it is just pre-packaged blah. Service was slow to all tables in my section. No Bueno. My table was sticky. I just don't have a positive.....oh and I peeked in the kitchen on the way to the restroom. That was a bad idea... Gross."}
{"text":"Food-good Server-good Derek the manager-disappointing! Here I sit eating my lunch. Asked if I want another beer I said yes. The keg blew so the young man went for another. Came back shortly to say that was the last of the hop not. Ok I get that you may not have ordered correctly or planned correctly. That happens. But when the server asked the manager to double check he said right in front of me\" I don't care about hop not\". Well Derek being the guy drinking it I CARE! And to hear you voice out loud at the bar you don't care is supremely disappointing. What do you care about if not the customer providing your check? Well Derek I now have your attitude, I don't care either so I will no longer be coming to Chilis. New to the neighborhood and I was excited to have you close.  But if you don't care my beer then you don't care about my food either and that make me nervous.  Now I don't even get to take advantage of my rewards since they do not have the dessert I want either. Thank god I am not a mom as you would have ruined the one day they get. Instead you just ruined my Sunday!   Overall- HORRIBLE!"}
{"text":"This place was packed on a Saturday night! We sat at the bar area because we did not want to wait for a table. This may have actually ended up taking us longer to get our food. The server was very polite it just seemed he had too big of a section by himself which ended up resulting in longer wait times to make our order and get refills on drinks. The food was very good and I have no complaints about it I just suggest going on a different night as Saturday dinner at Chilli's is far from a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"Ordered a chicken sandwich and thought it was a pretty safe bet. It was not!!!! The chicken was rubber and had me question if was actually chicken. My server looked like he was straight out of prison on work release. So when he recommended that sandwich I should have known better. I'm not sure why I ate here it was my own fault.  Why does anyone eat at these shitty places."}
{"text":"as far as \"sit down\" fast food goes. it wasnt bad.. it was the first one in a while i went to where the food was actually good and the staff was nice. id go back.."}
{"text":"We have eaten here several times on family trips. Not only has the food always been well prepared, but the service has always been fast and very friendly. It is standard Chili's fare and a little overpriced, but okay for an airport. I highly recommend if you want a sit down meal at CLT airport."}
{"text":"Well, what can I say....it's Chili's. I ordered a house salad and cup of enchilada soup. Both were average in taste. The soup could have use a bit more zing, but  I can't seem to pinpoint the missing ingredient.   My friend and I were sitting on the edge, near the fence. A stranger just randomly decided to drop his luggage right next to us, walk to the host's stand, and left. This un-nerved me, especially traveling around 9/11 (was there on Monday, 9/10/12). I alerted a waiter passing by (not ours), and he nodded. About five minutes later, the waiter didn't come to our table to address the situation; he had disappeared. Finally I went to the host stand to inform them of the luggage drop. The host and hostess came to inspect, asked what direction the guy took and what he looked like (told them he looked homeless), and stood next to us looking around the airport.   After looking around the airport for a guy they wouldn't even recognize (which is of no use), they went back to their stand. The guy eventually showed up and collected his luggage. However, given that this restaurant is in an airport, it seems staff need to be trained as to what to do when such a complaint is brought to them. The guy had left his luggage for about 15-20 minutes. That's plenty of time for something very bad, God forbid, to happen!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, the staff would get 5 stars.  But for some reason I only go here if someone else wants to go.  I'm ok with their food, but so far nothing on their menu is something that I have to have.  You know that feeling you get where you have to have something that you crave and you must have now, that hasn't happened.  I do try new things every time but it just strikes me as average...yawn"}
{"text":"So, reading all the reviews and most are pretty bad. I felt as though I needed to write this...  went in this morning at 11 for 2 things; a Bloody Mary and a half order of cheese fries. The drink was amazing and the fries tasted like fried tortilla chips. I told my waiter and he asked if I wanted anything else. I said no, that I would eat them anyway but I jut wanted them to know that their oil tasted funny. The manger came out and spoke with me for a moment and told me I must have some great taste buds(which I do,lol)  I still ate the fries and they still took them off my bill, I even offered to pay since I did eat all of the fries.  I just thought that was very nice and professional and they really needed this review. That's guys!!"}
{"text":"No interesting stories to tell, except for the uncanny way I'm always reminded of the movie \"Waiting\" whenever I see the interior fixtures. The servers also have a lot of \"flair\" on them, so that also deserves a tweak and a nod. I don't dare talk shit or complain about my order, and I always check for \"special sauce\" on my entrees. All kidding aside, I have a soft spot for this Chili's because of the proximity to my old workplace and also how their adding a new low calorie menu became sort of a side joke with my group -- we'd all order a low-cal plate, but start things off with a Sampler, thereby negating the Positive Healing aspect. Several rounds of Mojitos and Bloody Marys would also follow, another reason why I enjoy Chili's is because I like to drink with my food, regardless of what time of day it is. Thankfully, the Vegas location doesn't beat around the lush. (Load groans and squishy fruit FX)"}
{"text":"Great job on a busy Friday night!  I came here to celebrate my birthday and our server was on point.  He kept our drinks flowing and our mouths happy.  The Original Chicken Crispers never disappoint.  I liken the breading to Long John Silvers chicken only way better flavor and much more juicy.  They have a 2 for $20 deal with an appetizer and two entrees.  What a deal!  The only negative I see is that the drinks are a little pricey.  They are pricey enough that we can't get food and cocktails without the bill being huge so I just get soda, which is a bummer.  Love this place and hope for more drink specials!"}
{"text":"This location is always very consistent in service and food I think it is also one of the busier locations simply because it is basically on ASU Main Campus Parking is usually available even on the weekends The Southwestern Eggrolls are yumzo! Chilis is great in changing up their menus and adding new things in a great timely manner They also have all the classics and things that people love I like the burgers  The sizzlin fajitas are great too The drinks are very good each time  The great thing about this location is that you can have dinner and once you're done with that, you can take a stroll north up Mill ave for fun"}
{"text":"I'd normally give this place 4 or 5 stars, but not after yesterday's visit. There's something disheartening about sitting at the bar for 45 minutes and not getting food, let alone a menu. Others came in after me and had already eaten. Are they trying to lose a long time customer? Because that's how you definitely lose a long time customer!"}
{"text":"This location has always been pretty good.  The food is fresh and tasty and the service is great!  I don't go here often but when I do they have the gluten free menu readily available for me and they know what items are on it (or I'm lucky and get the right waiters!)  Love the lunch combos!  Great value!"}
{"text":"Love this location!! My friend and I come here all the time to catch up on work stuff. We always sit in the bar and have THE best service. Eric is awesome. He's our favorite waiter, but there are four or five other servers who work the bar that are just as phenomenal. We are usually here between 3 and 5 and have never had an issue with seating or service.  They have a great happy hour, too!!"}
{"text":"I don't expect fine dining at Chili's, but come on. I asked if the iced tea was fresh brewed, was told \"yes\", and then got drink mix anyway. Ordered an appetizer & never got it. Ordered a burger & got cold fries. Ordered a cobb salad that is supposed to come with avocado southwest dressing, got plain ranch and brown, mushy iceberg lettuce. Absolutely no part of anyone's meal in my party was correct. Have never had experiences like this at a US Chili's."}
{"text":"Okay. I love chili's and my family always loved doing a quick chili's to go order for Friday dinner. Since moving with my fiance to this location, I haven't had that experience! Tonight we ordered 2 buffalo chicken sangwiches. Simple! We get home and we have breaded chicken sangwiches with mayo.....okay. the rest of the order is fine so I call back and re ordered. My fiance and I didn't get to sit down to eat till 10;30pm! And what do we find? Another chicken w/mayo with wing sauce on the side....one with wing sauce and nothing else.   These guys were not busy when I went in to the To Go entrance and seeing as they ruined this simple order twice within an hour, means they've got some pretty bad cooks, or some pretty bad attitudes.   Oh and the fries were cold both times. Like not even \"to go\" cooled...we live 3 blocks from the place!"}
{"text":"I may be turning into a Chili's fan.  For years, I would have rated Chili's as thoroughly mediocre, with any other nearby restaurant rating higher than what it could bring.   Today I had a mesquite chicken salad sans tortilla chip shreds.  They kept the chips off (which was sort of surprising to me) and it was pretty good tasting.   The server offered to split the checks which is nice and the server who brought out the food brought out the checks at the same time in case we were in a hurry.  My drink was kept filled without me having to ask for it and I think everyone else at the table enjoyed everything they were eating.  We did seem to have to go through a gauntlet of servers, hosts and managers lining the exit on the way out , but overall it was a good experience."}
{"text":"didn't have to wait! Food is SO good, ordered a Rib Mexican bowl and mom had the ancho salmon. Absolutely good."}
{"text":"I was so pleased with the service that we received on a recent visit to Chili's.    We often go get an afternoon snack of appetizers when we're out and about.  Hands down, one of our new favorite places to go is Chili's for their bottomless chips and salsa.  Order a couple of drinks and we're set for an afternoon snack.  Server was so friendly!  Honestly, it's been a while since we've had such great customer service!  He was all smiles while he brought us basket after basket of chips.  We actually joked about feeling bad that it was so cheap and that we ate so many chips.  His response, \"I'll bring you as many baskets of chips as you want!  That's what I'm here for!\"    Oh, and the chips and salsa are so good!  Totally unexpected for a large chain restaurant.  Fresh chips made in house and yummy salsa......it's actually kind of pathetic that we thought that the salsa was better than what is served in MANY of the Mexian food restaurants around town.  Salsa should never be an afterthougt.....  Thanks for surprising us Chili's!"}
{"text":"Meals over 1k cals and slow/nonexistent service? What was their saving grace? Their watermelon cooler and the tablet that allowed my party to pay our check at the table.   I ordered the Honey- Chipotle Chicken Crispers & a Watermelon Cooler as an early dinner with friends. The food came out so slowly, we had finished sharing an appetizer and I was half way done with my drink until the main entree came out. The food tasted fine, was hot though I thought the chicken was way too saucy. The Watermelon Cooler was refreshing and definitely had at least a shot of vodka in it- thank goodness, it killed that overextended wait for food. We didn't receive much service, the extent included drink/food orders and a box at the end. We basically sat and took care of our check ourselves.   There are better locations I've been to. Service was lacking. Period."}
{"text":"If I were reviewing the Chili's in Buffalo, I'd give 5 stars. This Canadian version was...meh. It wasn't as great as I'd anticipated, when I heard we were getting a Chili's I was BEYOND excited. Wah Woh.  I had the sliders...and while they were edible...they were the saltiest things EVER. Days later I read that that meal I had, had one of the highest sodium contents on the menu! Gross. Food does not need to be that salty. Everything else was meh. Nothing about it set it apart from any other Jack Astors/Kelsey's type places. Probably won't be going back to this one again....in Buffalo, on the other hand..."}
{"text":"Firstly! Who ever constructed this building built it backwards. The entrance of this tex-mex restaurant faces the opposite way of the parking, unlike the other stores and food chains located at this plaza. It is blistering cold in this Canadian weather and to take a 2-3 minute walk in the cold at -30 degrees is extremely brutal.   When we came in the restaurant was completely empty with maybe about 3-4 other tables occupied in this very big restaurant. We had to stand at the front for about a minute or two before the server came to seat us down. Which I thought was a long time for a place that was fairly empty.   As I was looking at the menu my friends and I noticed that there was a promotion for a free app by just liking their FB page. However when we brought this up to the server he told us that we had to print it out and bring it back our next visit - pretty disappointing. After this I went on my Yelp app to sign in and to my surprise I got a free coupon for salsa and chips. When I brought this up to the server he was shocked and wasn't sure what was going on.. so he went to his manager.  The manager then came over to us and brought us our salsa and chips. He seemed very nice and told us that because he's in charge of the ads on Yelp he would treat us exceptionally nice. He also asked us if the server told us about any of their specials and we responded with a no. So he told us about the specials which were discounted drinks.. however because two out of the 4 were driving we didn't want to drink. Just water for the night.   We looked at the menu and wanted to order the Texas Cheese Poppers but when we asked for them the server told us they were sold out... SHOCKING because this place was empty who else has been eating them? :( So we decided to go for the platter which has egg rolls, chicken bites and sliders. It was okay... I've had better. I really liked the egg rolls the most but I really wanted to try the Cheese Poppers.   I ordered the Chicken Enchilada Pasta which was cooked really well and had amazing texture! There were pieces of chips that made it crunchy which I loved! The chicken surprisingly wasn't dry and the overall taste was good! This is something that I would reorder if I ever came back...   Unfortunately for my friends though they didn't seem to like their meal as much and they told they wouldn't come back and wished that we went to Spoon and Fork which is located right beside this restaurant. My boyfriend ordered a Chicken Quesadilla and it was placed on a salad bed with sour cream... but no SALSA... so when we asked the manager for salsa he said it doesn't come with it. My boyfriend asked very politely \"Is it possible if we can have salsa?\" The manager seemed really offended and said in a upset voice \"What's the magic WORD?\"   Honestly I get it that he didn't say please, but it wasn't like we were a bunch of noisy and rude teenagers trying to cause any trouble. We were having a double date with old friends that we haven't seen in a long time and wanted to continue catching up. This guy should've been happy that we came to the restaurant to eat. I know it's not right to treat people in a bad way but like I said we didn't cause and trouble at ALL.  Caught off guard by what the manager said my boyfriend just said \"please\" to make this guy go away and provide us with the salsa that should've gone along with the quesadilla.   Overall, I would never come back to place unless some one paid for me and I wouldn't recommend this place at all. This place is horrible. But I did like my pasta and those rolls.  -CL"}
{"text":"For over 2 years we've  enjoyed a stop at this Chili's once per week after pickleball.  As seniors, at the suggestion of one of their food servers, a couple of the members of our group have ordered off the children's menu.  But 10 days ago we were suddenly told that ordering off the children's menu was not allowed.  I understand a change in policy or perhaps a new manager wanted to enforce an old policy.  No problem.  But after this we submitted feedback on the Chili's website inquired about what other options (senior menu , smaller portions, etc.) might be available.  Like any \"family\", could some of us select children's portions as long as others were ordering adult entrees? Received a prompt (canned?) response that this was an area of concern for them and a general manager and/or area manager would contact us within 2 days.  But as you might expect, there has been no follow-through on contacting us.   Oh well, we made an effort to make it work but have found several other restaurants willing to meet our needs."}
{"text":"I regular this place first for their good food and second and the most important for their yummilicious molten chocolate lava dessert ! Oh my just thinking of it makes me want to go there . Me and my husband go there atleast twice ( after restricting ourselves ) every week  just to have the dessert . You have got to try this desert atleast once and I am sure you can't stop having them again and again ."}
{"text":"Came in and three different servers walked right past us. No acknowledgement. No \"Hi, we will be right with you. \" Nothing. They need to train their staff  better!!  Finally we just sat ourselves in the bar. Luckily Dave saved the experience."}
{"text":"We come here fairly frequently.  This was not their best night.  The margarita I usually enjoy was limp and watery. The service was slow. The server was too busy to pay more than perfunctory attention to his customers. The food had  rushed air to it. Stay away from Saturday night."}
{"text":"I waited at the front for about 10 minutes before someone finally noticed me. Our service was very attentive.. almost too attentive. They kept interrupting me and my boyfriend to consistently refill our already full waters. We had probably 3 different servers that night and although it was 10pm, they were very off task. I could hear them cussing and messing around in the back. My skillet cookie wasn't very good either :("}
{"text":"I came here recently for lunch with my Grandma and we were very satisfied!  We both ordered the fish tacos - delish!! A side of the baked (?) asparagus and chips/guac. My grandma raved about the asparagus haha and I enjoyed my guac and salsa. The chips however were SO thin they were hard to scoop with.  Service was great! Quick, too and the weather was perfect for sitting outdoors. The patio was clean and the umbrellas were easy to use.  Overall, we left full and happy. I will definitely be back for more tacos!"}
{"text":"A friend and I sat out on the patio for a late dinner (730/8). After about 15 minutes of not seeing our server I walked in and asks a manager to please let our server know we were ready. I was told \"oh the hostess didn't tell us anyone was out there.\" There were two other tables being served and the hostess sat us out there. The server was clearly annoyed, very short and less than personable. We were sitting right in front of the windows so were were able to see the interaction between our server in the manager. Based on the body language, pointing and looking as us, and foul mood of both of them, anyone would assume the conversation was about us. The food was average for Chilis, we just had soup and salad. There are plenty of other restaurants nearby where you can have good food and more importantly, good service."}
{"text":"Never a bad experience when I come here, and I have been going to this Chili's for 5 years now! The service is always great and the food is always perfect!!"}
{"text":"Was really disappointed tonight. We love going to Chili's. There were 7 in our party. 5 adults and 2 children. It's Friday night I understand the establishment is busy. We waited 30 minutes for a table. After we sat down, the waiter immediately took our drinks....and then didnt return till almost 20min later. We ordered an appetizer of chips and guacamole which took another 20min to arrive.   Then we ordered our meals...and waited again...30min. During this time our waiter never once checked on us. He passed our table time and time again. Helping other tables that arrived after us. Like I said, I understand its a Friday night and they were busy but we were definitely ignored. We had to ask another server to help us out.   Finally our food arrived....ice cold. It was so disappointing. We told the server who got the manager to come over. She offered to remake everything but at this point we didn't want to wait another 30min. Our food had obviously just sat in the window.   The manager said she would adjust our bill. When she got back with the adjusted bill it was almost $100! She said the only thing she could do was charge us 1/2 price for each meal. Um that would of been fine had the food been eaten or taken home but it wasn't.  In the middle of asking her questions she pulls the bill out of my dad's hands and walks off in a huff. My dad followed her to the register only to hear her talking badly about our family and how sick of us she was. My dad confronted her and she replies, \"Well I'm just sick of everyone complaining to me about service and their bill.\"   It was a disaster and she handle the situation horribly. We are going to refrain from returning. :("}
{"text":"Terrible experience!  Over an hour wait for a salad.  When I got it, the greens were so limp and old I sent it back.  Manager said they had a new person in the kitchen.  Told her to check the greens because they should be thrown out.  Not going back!"}
{"text":"I hope you guys read this cause your waitress is the shizznit! I don't know her name yet but awesome service ... I guess her name is Angela. Well awesome service !! The food was good but the only reason o give 5 stars is cause of her . Never been to chili's before but will be going back ! Everyone should give her great tips !!"}
{"text":"Got good fast service and I love the southwestern egg rolls! Don't know why so many bad reviews, I had great service and food."}
{"text":"One review is generous for this place. That said, our waitress was very attentive and did her job. And as other commenters have noted, this location has nothing on the ones in the US.  Came here last weekend because the bf knew my obsession with just about anything Tex-Mex.   I love fajitas. At Chili's there were two options. The 18.99$ classic with a choice of chicken or beef, or 22.99$ mushroom fajitas, which came with a mushroom base. Being a pescatarian, I was told that I could have an all-shrimp classic fajita, but at the 22.99$ price. I opted to add guacamole for an additional 2.49$ and a side of mushrooms for 2.29$. My 22.99$ fajitas came with three pieces of lukewarm tortillas, exactly six pieces of shrimps, an overwhelmingly large amount of onions and green peppers. The guacamole was not only bland but also tasted of unripe avocados. However, the *STAR* of my meal was the mushrooms. They were so thinly sliced that they resembled the canned variety. Our suspicion  was confirmed when my bf picked up some with his spoon, the liquid was not only runny but also TASTED like it came from a can.  On the bright hand side, my bf's burger was good, but the fries were lukewarm and undercooked. However, the best part of our night was right before we left, the hostess was nice enough to inquire about our night. When she heard about our experience, she offered to call a manager. I told the manager, Patricia, that not only was I unhappy about paying 30$ for such an underwhelming meal, and that Jackastors not only had a better but cheaper version, her response was \"WELL, first of all, we are NOT Jackastors, Ok? We make our food very differently, I'm sorry you didn't enjoy your food.\" What I hate the most is that she blatantly lied to me about the mushrooms, saying that it was freshly cut, and definitely not from a can. Where else could the disgusting liquid come from?  We made the unfortunate mistake of wasting 70$. Don't do the same!"}
{"text":"Food comes out fast (key for an airport) and service is usually decent. Limited menu to increase the speed. Not the best but usually stop by for meal before hopping a flight."}
{"text":"Normally I just give Chilies 3-stars, but this one has a pretty nice patio overlooking the main ASU drag strip. As far as the food goes, it's the same as every other Chilies I've ever been to (meaning high in sodium & fat). Enjoy."}
{"text":"The first visit to Chili's north of the border has left me unimpressed to say the least. To be fair, I was never fond of my American visits either. I only remember them as being quick pit-stops on the I-5. The food is extremely bland, which is ironic given their name. Forget Mexican food, they give Tex-Mex a bad name. So atleast I can commend them for being consistently mediocre as a franchise.   My Philly cheese steak had this odd looking brown cheese sauce which reeked of processed cheese smell. The fries were incredibly starchy despite looking so good. Other members of our party were equally disappointed with their Tacos. I was also annoyed by the pint of Rolling Rock I was served. In addition to being poured with a very large head, I noticed it being distinctly flat and unusual in taste (I've had this beer many times in the past).   I feel like the food deserves no better than a 2. However, I do feel obliged to factor in the attentive and courteous service as well as the friendly visits to our table by the owner. It is also worth mentioning that they run a pretty clean joint unlike some of their American counterparts."}
{"text":"Ate here with a friend because we were starving and it was easy. ...not so fast. The place was filthy, wait staff ignored us for 15 minutes literally...I had to do the \"hey miss can we get some service thing\" when she began helping people that had just sat down. The food wad meh and frankly I couldn't get past the dirt factor. ....tables, floor, etc.  Neither one of us could continue.... her"}
{"text":"I did not enjoy my experience here tonight. I'm not normally a fan of chills, but I wanted to give it another try. Steak was a bad cut and not good at all. Only reason I give it 3 stars is because the waiter was good and the manager took the steak off the bill."}
{"text":"Seriously what the hell happened to this location!?! I used to come here ALL the time over the past 2 years but I haven't been here for a couple months and disappointing is all I have to say. Came in and sat at the bar for lunch on Saturday it really wasn't that busy and it was just one thing after another. My friend and I had ordered almost the same exact meal (just slightly different) we had the fajita trio I had mine plain and she wanted hers with all the peppers, onions and spices. So our food comes out and to our surprise there is only ONE plate! Seriously idk how this guy did not here the TWO separate orders. Of course at that point we are forced to send it back and wait for another 20+ minutes for our food to come out. And of course I had to talk to the manager to make sure they didn't just put that one plate (that was completely plain mind you) under the heat lamp to sit there while they cooked the other one. I'm not going to eat some nasty heat lamp food because you messed up. So finally the food comes out after 25 minutes and the next thing I know is I look down and my plate has all sorts of spice on top of the beef, shrimp & chicken. I ask the guy why is all this nasty red spice sauce is on there and he tells me he thought I said I just didn't want peppers & onions. What part of PLAIN is that difficult to understand especially after the first plate that was brought out didn't have anything on it!  Needless to say the newer manager didn't do a damn thing no discount no apology absolutely nothing. What was supposed to be just lunch ended up into an early dinner because of their constant mistakes. I never have had a problem here so this was disappointing to say the least. I even remember when the manager who was there at the time first started & it wasn't too long ago and even then he was completely useless with a very unruly customer who was a constant disruption. Seriously bring back the Chili's I'm used to!!"}
{"text":"My experience at Chili's were both A-OK. I enjoyed drinking their Margarita inside the bar or on their patio.  I also have a taste of couple of their offerings during Savour York Region Restaurant Week. Good if you like Tex-Mex food.  Weekday Happy Hour and Daily Specials. Not a bad place to watch a game or just to chill with your friends."}
{"text":"Food was ok. It was the server's second day so she struggled, but tried her best. The biggest issue was the manager. I asked for a gluten free menu and he told me that he would have to go print one out and would take him a few minutes. He wasn't happy that he had to go to the extra trouble. I am GF because of an allergy but how about not making a big deal out of it. If your menu says it's available on request, it shouldn't be a big shock to you.   Food ok. Service ok. Customer service was lacking."}
{"text":"I would consider Chili's a cornerstone for a wonderful family dining experience in the GTA.  The restaurant architecture is a stand-out and interior is delightfully fresh, cozy and nostalgic.  The warm hospitality and the neighbourly familiarity and candor make us feel very welcome and comfortable.  Everything is clean and well-maintained that even a trip to the washroom is something I enjoy.  My husband and I bring our kids here on those special weekends when a huge craving for something American or Tex-Mex hits.  Our usual appetizers would be the \"Bottomless Tostada Chips\" (how could it not be?) with salsa or the \"Hot Spinach and Antichoke Dip\" with tostada chips or the loaded \"Classic Nachos.\"  The \"Southwestern Eggrolls\" has a good kick in flavour and texture with a little zing on the after taste.   We usually go right on with the main course and our usual orders would be the huge and my-last-meal-on-earth sandwiches (ranges $9.49-11.99) like Chili's Cheesesteak, Jalapeno Smokehouse (applewood smoked extra thick) Bacon Big Mouth Burger, and Southern Smokehouse (sugar & chilli and extra thick) Bacon Big Mouth Burger that include a siding of either black beans with a bit of salsa, or fries, etc.  Will never be underestimated.  Deliciously satisfying.  Their Big Mouth Bites, mini burgers but not short on flavour and served with friend onion rings, is good but the kids don't like it probably because of the sautéed onions in it.  Oldtimer burger was gastronomically tempting but after a couple of orders we put a thumbs down on this one.  Its like a muscle car with a bad engine.  Disappointingly or surprisingly flavourless.  Their kids menu has so many options that the occasional picky-eater in them are thrown out the door.  Quesadillas, Chicken Crispers, Grilled Chicken or Cheese sandwiches are some of the sure hit items for the kids.  Sidings has a longer list that include vegetables.  My kids would have a nice exercise on decision-making while containing their appetite.  They also serve Ribs, Fajitas, Steaks; Classic grilled chicken dishes; Grilled Seafood.  I am yet to try one of those so for now I have no comment.  Though The Keg's steaks and Baton Rouge's grilled chicken are juicy and wonderfully seasoned, that is, assuming you're asking my recommendations.  Very seldom do we have enough room for dessert but when we do get a tad space in the belly we would share on Chocolate Chip Paradise Pie.  Sooo good and satisfying but, trust me, you would really want to share this and with more than one person.  The One Brownie Sweet Shot is a smaller serving dessert with vanilla ice cream and a small slice of brownie fudge.  Smooth and creamy and is a nice finish.  I would really suggest a wider mouth serving dish for this one.  A sports bar at the other side of the room can be a nice place to chill out with friends serving premium magaritas and cocktails.  Dinner dates are common here, too, with couples sitting at the booths by the shutter windows.  But mostly, family groups fill this place with vigor.  Its truly an enjoyable place and the service and food are buzzworthy."}
{"text":"After hearing 45 minute wait at a restaurant next door I opened my yelp app to see where we could get a table on a Friday night. Chilis seemed to be a less frequented option and the check in offer for chips and salsa lured us in.   The food is good, service is good. Not great but you can't expect to get 5 star food at a tex-mex place in Woodbridge.   I enjoyed my chicken fajitas. The Texas-sized option is great for sharing, also liked that we each got our own plate of toppings. We were served 6 warm tortillas and had our waiter offer a refill. I do appreciate food not going to waste so kudos to Chilis for that as well.   I wouldn't hesitate to stop by again."}
{"text":"so i ate here about a month ago for my dads birthday dinner this location was awesome ive been to two other and by far this one had great customer service we didn't even have to ask for refills our server would glance over and bring us refills it was great not many places do that i loved the tacos that the server suggested they were great i will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"This is the ONLY Chili's in Canada!  -Great service -Delicious food -Decent prices -Clean restaurant/washrooms  Only negative comment is that we ordered a mini brownie that came in a shot glass with icecream on top of it. The presentation of the dessert was MESSY! Really messy and turned me off from eatting it."}
{"text":"I actually really love this location even though im usually not a huge fan of chains\chilis restaurants buy this one it bomb! My favorites are the california flatbread with avocado and the fajitas are freaking amazing with a margarita of course. I always go during happy hour so we can get the cheaper appetizers and cheap drinks! Its really cool cause they have the game systems at every table, you can also close out and get your receipt without having to talk to a server.  Make sure u do the rewards! I dont go often but have already earned free apps, free desserts and a buy one get one .. So worth it! Plus they constantly send you deals in your email to bring you in.  Their service is superb and a love one of the guys that works in the bar area.. (For happy hour prices) we usually come in for a margarita after hiking (lol) and he always reassures me i worked hard for it. Hahahhaa will continue to come back!"}
{"text":"I've been into this Chili's a few times and sat at the bar and in the dining room. Maybe I'm just lucky, but every time I've gone in I've had phenomenal service. Like really good service. The kind you'd tell mom about. If I were still running restaurants, this is the type of place I'd recruit some of my next team members.   The menu is definitely getting better. (Yay for Chilis!) And this particular location at Bell and 7th street is upgraded. New TVs throughout and pay-at-the-table monitors. They also have a movie deal right now. Two entrees, an app and two movie tickets for like $36 I think.   Not at all a bad place to go for a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm actually surprised at the large number of low ratings. But maybe I went here on a particularly good day. A few months ago I decided to have my lunch break at this location. The waitress was warm and friendly, almost going out her way to make sure I was satisfied with everything.   I rarely interact with restaurant employees but I made some small talk with her during the few minutes she wasn't busy. I paid the bill when I was done with my meal and gave her a generous tip. she deserved it, I think."}
{"text":"Rude bartender Needs to learn how to fix drinks instead of arguing about it...specially when someone in training is making them and he didn't offer to help or fix the matter....."}
{"text":"Came here late on a Friday night to get a burger and fries.  Figured it's pretty hard to screw that up but the cheese wasn't melted at all the bacon was crunchy.  Next time I'll drive the extra 5 miles to Red Robin.  Way better.  Or mabye they just had an off night here.  Not sure.  Service was adequate I guess but it would have been nice to get my water refilled more.  Shrug."}
{"text":"I don't know what to say. I've had a combination of good and bad times at this here Chili's over the course of a decade plus.   Tonight's experience wasn't terribly awful, but not much to give more than 3 stars to. First, off the booth they sat us in had a large gash in the bench my dad and I sat on. For some reason, this struck a sour note with me. It was rather huge and hard to miss, I kept thinking, I know I'm not the only person that has or will see this, lets fix it!   The place had a little bit of crowd going. Good mix of families, couples, and groups of friends grabbing an early dinner, it made for a nice dining atmosphere.  The fam tried out two of the $20 for 3 course meals for two. The service was superb, but the food not so much. I shared chips and salsa, nachos, some mini chicken sandwiches with fries, and key lime pie shots. I didn't finish my sandwiches because they just weren't doing it for me. I ate about 2 of the 3 dessert shots. Still was not impressed... I'm stuffed to the brim at the moment, and somewhat hating myself for eating so much. I would suggest sharing the main courses as well. I know it defeats the purpose, but you shouldn't bother getting your own dish with this deal, its way too much food!  I know it was a family dinner, but I spent half my time watching the Little League game of Japan vs. the Caribbean on one of the tv's, through the small window in the wall separating our dining area from the bar. I gets excited about my baseball, whether its being played by big or small persons. After a short while, I began to appreciate my torn seat...just a little."}
{"text":"I went here yesterday for lunch and it was pretty decent. I was really happy with the price, I got soup, salad, and chips and salsa for about 7$. That was amazing! Our server was good and he brought a big basket of chips so everyone at the table could eat them, not just me. That was very nice! The food is generic, yes, but it is convenient and inexpensive, so that makes it alright in my book."}
{"text":"I've been to other Chilis restaurants in the US and have never had such a poor experience. Although the food was good, our waitress was always missing. We could not find her. Instead, we had to get other waiters and waitresses to do her bidding. It's unfortunate that this is the only Chilis in all of Ontario."}
{"text":"This Chili's, to put it nicely, is a crap hole. The last time I was here, which was a few years ago, it was okay. Nothing special. But this Chili's is dirty and old.  The place is super grimy and dirty, which doesn't make sense because there were two people consistently \"cleaning\". Sweeping...making rounds.  The three of us were shoved into a tiny table not meant for three people...They had plenty of seating.   They were out of children's menus and the grown up menus were falling apart. And there's a very limited Chili's menu. This is not like a regular full menued Chili's.  My salad was disgusting. How hard is it to make a salad? It was old salad mix and old chicken that had obviously been sitting under a heat lamp for some time. And my son's corn dog was burnt.  Steer clear!"}
{"text":"Chili's is pretty good as far as those apostrophe chain restaurants go (i.e. Montana's, Kelsey's, Casey's, Jack Astor's, Turtle Jack's.....). Of the times I've eaten here I like their burgers the best.  The jalapeno burger is my personal favourite.  Also the deconstructed ice cream bar is a great dessert."}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Chili's in a long time so while roadtripping it through Tempe with a friend, it seemed like a logical choice.  I've always been pleased by past experiences at the ones near home so I was curious whether or not I would have the same experience here.  I did. My friend and I got there pretty late so it wasn't terribly busy. We were immediately seated and our server was there in no time.  I ordered a Blue Moon and a chicken salad.  The beer came out almost immediately and the wait for the food wasn't long at all.  Our server checked in frequently and was always friendly.  Even though I've been to quite a few Chili's, this place did slightly exceed my expectations. I guess that's what happens when you take a break for awhile.  Either way, this is a good location in my opinion."}
{"text":"Went here with my parents a few weeks ago, food was cold when served, had to ask over and over again for cutlery. Manager of this place is completely fake, needs to learn to tell servers when they have screwed up so that there is no confusion on what needs to be done. I've gone here before and had a positive experience but my last experience will certainly make me not want to return to this restaurant. Will probably go to Jack Astor's next time I am in this area and looking for something to eat."}
{"text":"Best service ever. The Food was flavorful. I alway love going to Chili's and I would go back to that location again and again and again."}
{"text":"I had the most bizarre experience here last night. As the location for the b-day dinner with family, I arrived a bit late (hey, I parked near N. Mill and wanted to walk) and walked in hurriedly, looking around to spot familiar faces. To my left, I saw a young woman waving at me. I looked at her; she looked at me. I looked at the hostess; the hostess looked at the young lady. I looked away to try and spot my family. The young woman waved again. I furrowed my brows and looked around - was she waving at somebody behind me? I looked at the hostess again, who looked equally befuddled. I walked in the direction of the young woman. She said happily, \"Alison!\" I stepped closer, leaned down to let her get a good, clear look at my face and whispered, \"I'm not Alison.\" Then I walked off, turning the corner and locating my party. Of course I had to tell the story to my family. It was bizarre, after all. The hostess walked by a couple minutes later (while I was telling the story) and said, \"Did she think you were someone else?\" I pointed at the hostess to add credibility to my story. \"See, exactly.\"  That set the stage for a very enjoyable and often humorous dinner. From the topics of \"best friends with naked benefits\" to dirty playground jokes to politics, we discussed a wide range of topics. We also enjoyed our meal. I had a salad with shrimp. The waiter was happy to accommodate my request to substitute shrimp with chicken. I also ordered a 22 oz Blue Moon (on happy hour price). Since it was both my and my brother's birthday (we are 5 years apart), we got two free desserts. I let my family select what dessert they wanted. I would have gone with something chocolate, though. My brother went with the white chocolate lava cake. So did my parents. I ate a little bit of it, but soon noticed that my inability to eat white chocolate hasn't change. It's just way too sweet.   As for the meals, everyone seemed to enjoy theirs. My dad got the Guiltless Salmon with extra veggies. My brother order fajitas. My step mom got something she didn't order, although it did have chicken and shrimp in the mix. She picked at it. When I tasted a piece of her shrimp, I noticed it tasted burnt. Gross. No wonder she didn't eat much. She didn't seem to mind, though.  As for the service, it was great. The waiter knew it was a birthday dinner. He was attentive and fast. When the check came, a manager came over to ask whose birthday it was. I, slightly buzzed, gestured wildly and unrestrained to communicate it was mine birthday, as well as my little brother's. The manager thought that was cool. \"It's also their grandpa's birthday,\" my step-mom said. My brother chirped up, \"And the cat's!\"   We hugged our goodbyes in front of Chili's and my brother and I set off down N. Mill to find something else to do to celebrate. All in all, a very nice birthday dinner. Chili's may not have been my first choice in \"fine dining\" on such an occasion, but I know it's family-friendly and pretty standard in the food and service it delivers. Usually I avoid chain restaurants like genital warts (or so I try), but I can hang at Chili's. After all, they have a little bit of something for everyone."}
{"text":"I always look forward to stopping here for breakfast on my way to and from Daytona Beach.  I always get a seat quickly, the servers are always pleasant and professional and the breakfast is always good and filling and not a bad price for airports whose businesses often grossly overcharge for everything available for sale."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of 8 during lunch time around 12:40pm on a Sunday and had to wait over 30 minutes. When we sat down, our waiter was really nice and attentive. We ordered the trio dipper and the new bacon avacado chicken sandwich on a pretzel bun. The pretzel bun was super rock hard and was not pleasant to eat because it was cutting the roof of my mouth but we kept the dish anyways. The trip dipper came with honey chipotle wings, southwestern eggrolls, and big bite sliders. the sliders were cooked to death and it was so tough and dry, we will not be ordering that again. the honey chipotle wings were really good though, the sauce was sweet and tangy and the eggrolls were good as usual. I liked how they have the new table kiosks where you can split and pay your bill there without a lot of server interaction. Service was great but the food and wait, not so much."}
{"text":"I don't know why I keep trying to eat at chili's...this location wasn't good either...chicken tasted greasy and was over cooked...took a while to get service...just not a good experience"}
{"text":"I went here last night for dinner.   The good:   The chicken enchilada soup was fantastic. Creamy, tasty, nothing to complain about there. This restaurant is really conveniently located for my neighborhood. I wish there were more decent restaurants within 5 miles of my house. Also, this restaurant is very affordable.  The bad:   The service! Terrible! It took the server 10 minutes to greet us. At the end of the meal I asked for a to-go box. After waiting 15 minutes for her return I decided to just eat the rest of my meal because I I didn't want to wait any longer. This was a Wednesday night - So I'm going to avoid eating here on the weekend.  The ugly:   I had a glass of water. Of course I didn't notice until my very last sip that the glass had a dark, thick, chunky ring on the inside of it- remnants from another drink of some kind. Nothing makes me shudder more than eating/drinking off a dirty dish at a restaurant."}
{"text":"Stopped in here New Year's Day... It's your typical Chili's, though they thankfully weren't that busy. The other place in the area I was originally headed to was packed to the gills and I didn't want to deal with it. I love Chili's blackberry tea though, so... Unfortunately I also love their triple dipper dish...bad Donna!   The service was a bit slow...I was in the bar area. And he was slow on the blackberry tea refills. Nothing spectacular about this Chili's and the service didn't knock my socks off so...three stars."}
{"text":"I am a HUGEEEE fan of the Chili's in Buffalo. And when I found out that made one closer to home I was over the moon!  However after my experience tonight I realize that my high hopes were just in fact hopes.....and that this Canadian version was a stark contrast of the my American experience.  Let me explain...... We were seated promptly which was surprising because it was packed in here on this rainy friday night. The crowd mostly consisted of teenagers and young adults. It was rather noisy with faint music which cut on and off through out the night and a smoky atmosphere. (My coat still smells of that musty smoke)  Our waitress seemed rather jittery (perhaps she was new?) after delivering our menu she came back a mere 2 minutes later to see if we were ready to place our order. Only 1 out of the 4 us had actually opened the menu at this point in time. She then took our drink orders. 4 waters one with no ice.....we instead got 4 waters with no ice  Entrees: Jalepeno Smokehouse burger with fries and gravy - This by far the best entree ordered and received at the table. Nice big juicy burger, ample topping, nice portion of there white gravy. No complaints here  Half rack of ribs with mashed potatoes and gravy and broccoli - worst ribs ever....hard...litterally had to scrape the meat off the bones...broccoli...meh just plain and steamed....mash w/gravy...best thing on the plate...delish  Top Sirloin (medium) with mashed potatoes and gravy and sauteed veg - steak was cooked medium but rather small portion compared to your typical 8oz steaks....small portion of sauteed veg consisting merely of mushroom, green peppers and onions...again potatoes were the best part of the meal  Then my meal..... Top sirloin (rare) with broccoli and mashed potatoes and gravy - my steak looked nothing like friend's steak.......did not even look like a top sirloin......taste horrendous....cooked medium rare? ooo and loaded potatoes not my mash n gravy?? i try and track down the server and point out my steak looks nothing like friends steak whom ordered the same as me and i got the wrong potatoes...she apologizes and says she rush out another one stat!.......everyone finishes there meal and i finally get mine......she says the reason my steak looked different before was because the pounded out my steak????POUNDED OUT MY STEAK???? Who does that?? ANywhoooo she brings out my steak.......and looks exactly the one she gave me before...again not resembling a top sirloin looking more like a strip....i am speechless...at the potatoes are correct....i taste the steak....even more terrible than last time...tastes like pork...i let my tablemates sample to make sure i'm not crazy....and they agree!! Anyways i only eat the mash. Waiter returns and apologizes again and says she'll send out the manager to speak with me. I tell the manager this is the worst steak i've ever tasted it taste more like pork...he justifies the taste by saying because there steaks are soo fresh and not aged....Whatever...but he offers to bring me anything else off the menu free of charge i am totally turned off of steak and just want the chocolate chip paradise pie which was pictured on the menu looking so dreamy and delicious. He says ok we'll get you one right away.... maybe like 20 minutes the pie comes out.....looking nothing like the picture totally lack lustre and bland tasting.  Come here only for the burgers and sandwiches and the great mashed potatoes and white gravy...otherwise save your chili's adventures for when your in America!!"}
