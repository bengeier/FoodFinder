{"text":"We came here for the fish fry but also fell in love with the smoked brisket. 

It was very busy in this tiny bar of a restaurant.  We were seated in the adjacent overflow Sky box area in the back of the bar, a completely detached building from the bar. 

There were only two bartenders/servers and one cook.  We were there from beginning to finish for abit two hours for a party if five. The server was very nice and tried to accommodate us as much as she could. But we didn't mind because it was a beautiful night it and there's a sand volleyball court,  small baseball diamond,  and horseshoe area on site to entertain ourselves with. 

The drinks are cheap,  we ordered a blind Russian,  old fashioned and a Zenith on tap for $15 with tip. 

Everyone in our party got the fish fry except for me who ordered the brisket dinner because I've read the owner has really good smokehouse items.  

The fish was awesome!  A light, fine,  cornmeal -like batter that had enough crispness to be eaten like a chicken tender but fluffy, fall -apart middle.  The brisket was also very good,  fine shreds of meat with excellent seasoning ans sauce accompanied on the side. 

What I love most about the place is that instead of the usual fish fry sides,  each order comes with a side of baked BBQ beans (with bits of brisket!), crumbly corn bread,  and coleslaw.

There's a sign outside advertising ' Best Fish Fry' and we all concur!"}
{"text":"Having been so impressed with the fish fry, my wife and I came back for their breakfast and, wow, that's great too!  I had an omelette and my wife had the biscuits and gravy, and both were outstanding.  We had the place to ourselves which is unfortunate cuz this place is excellent--for all meals."}
{"text":"Great Food and GREAT Service.  The best fish in the Madison area i have ever tired.  My first time there and I will be back for sure.  Cant wait to thy the smoked prime and the brisket"}
