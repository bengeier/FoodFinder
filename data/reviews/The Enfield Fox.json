{"text":"Just was there for New Years Eve. 2 weeks prior, I called to make a reservation. They informed me that I must make a reservation in order to get in. Naturally, I made a reservation for the 4 of us who would be attending. They told me that there would be live music and a DJ attending all night. Sweet! We showed up for our 9pm reservation and saw that the pub was pretty empty, but we said hey it's early so we won't get too anxious about it. We settled into a pitcher and proceeded to settle into the bar for the evening. We ordered another pitcher promptly after the first one was consumed. We moved seats as quickly as we ordered due to a rowdy group of older adults (35-45yearsold) because they were very intoxicated and getting louder by the minute. No problem, we settled into our new spot at a lounge area with lovely comfortable couches. After we sat down and begun drinking again, the waitress came over and said, are you guys ready for last call...Wut? It was 10:30pm at the time and all I said was, UMMMMM we were informed there would be live music all night and a DJ to ring in the new year. So that was our experience at Fox and I don't think we will be back. The waitress was also very slow (considering there were less than 20 people in the place) and the service was cold and unfriendly. Overall, this place blowed tonight. Maybe in the future I'll go back. Probably not though. Hope everyone had a great new years!!! Happy Yelping!"}
{"text":"i've had TWO awful experiences..enough to deter me from going to this pub ever again. the first time i went here, it was during the UFC fight last year. we were well aware of how busy it was going to be -- that wasn't the problem. first we paid a ridiculous cover of $20.00 to get in. second, when we sat down and the waitress took our order...we were later told (around 10-15 mins later) that we had to move because the seats were taken (we were not informed before we sat there, nor was there a sign indicating that the seats were not vacant). we were specifically told where to sit and when it was time to take our order (we had a different waitress), she seemed to take everyone else's order around us. when we tried to flag the waitress to take our drinks, she ignored us. again, we thought it was due to high volume of customers, but we were watching her take orders but never ours. we sat there for almost half an hour...and then eventually we left the venue. one of the managers ran after us and promised she would have us serviced, but we were frustrated and hungry.   i decided to give this place a second chance. this time i ordered chicken wings. the dry cajun. when i received it, it had no spice at all. a friend of mine also ordered them and the wings were so bland it tasted like cardboard. deep fried cardboard. another friend of mine ordered the calamari. it was rock solid. she informed the waitress of the calamari, and she seemed irritated that someone had complained about the food. she reluctantly brings back a menu upon my friend's request. the waitress wasn't as terrible as my first experience, but she did not know how to handle these situations very well. i'm quite surprised because i'm sure my friend was not the first person to complain about the food. also, even BEFORE we received our food, she handed us the receipts. we felt inclined to pay at that moment. the waitress never said a word. we tipped her under the guise that we would receive excellent service and decent food. had i known the outcome of my chicken wings and the lack of utensils or serviettes, i would NOT have tipped her as much as i had.  1 star -- because i cannot leave 0. poor service. even worse food. atmosphere and lighting is uncomfortable and uninviting. anyone who gives this place higher than 1 star must be working for Enfield. There is NO excuse for the lack luster service."}
{"text":"Monday nights the bar hosts free pub poker!!! Yeaaa!!! :) Good times!!!  Drinks are standard for a pub, as is the atmosphere. It's a big place with a few separate rooms that can be good for groups or couples. Sports on the TVs.  Tonight I tried the burger with bacon and cheese with fries. YUMMMMMY!!! I'm not a huge burger fan because I don't usually find places do much with them. But last week I saw a fellow poker player eating one and I salivated. Tonight I tried it and it was OUTSTANDING!!! (5 stars for the burger!) I've seen some other plates served and they all looked tasty."}
