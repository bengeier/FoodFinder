{"text":"Had the best burger in Charlotte. Sad to see it closed. Went there the other day and was shocked when I drove up. Some Asian Bowl place there. Didn't look impressive. Wanted a burger that day and it didn't look like theirs was going to fit the bill. Bye Snoop's. We'll miss you and those well done fries."}
{"text":"This was a great burger joint.  Best burgers in charlotte.  unfortunately they closed for business on March 30, 2016.  So sad to see them go."}
{"text":"Sad to see Paul and Gloria have closed Snoops.  We all know they were near retirement from the beginning.  Could not have asked for nicer people!!!!  Miss you, even after being gone from the area for three years!!"}
{"text":"Great burgers, hot and cold sandwiches, fries and onion rings. They serve breakfast too but don't open till 8am so I gave them only 4 out 5 stars.

Update - 8/18/10 - You gotta try the bacon wrapped deep fried hot dog. Awesome! It might sound greasy but, not one bit."}
{"text":"Ok, this place has been around a long time, so I was expecting something great. The prices were very high for what you get. There was very little meat on my sandwich and it really wasn't very good. I won't go there again."}
{"text":"This is a really hard review to write as I am torn between how good the food tastes with a few complaints. 

Let's start with the good. The burgers are among the best in town bar none. They are made to order and delicious! The fries are cut in store and are also very good. 

Now on to my complaints. 

The lettuce has always been brown. Like it's been left out for days. This is not a one time deal, but the same scenario the 20+ times that I have been there. So as long as you don't want lettuce on your burger, you're ok. 

The tea is below average. Ok, it's worse than that. Again, consistently. 

The guy behind the counter gives you the same size cup regardless of what size you order and pay for. His rationale is that since refills are free, what does it matter what size cup he gives you. Kind of like he mayor of NYC I guess. This is really annoying."}
{"text":"This place is just a hidden gem! My husband and I have been going there for years. Double Bacon with fries and a single cheese with onion rings are a must!! Such a wonderful Steele creek burger joint!"}
{"text":"For what this restaurant is it's perfect. Snoops is located at the end of a nondescript strip business park on Westinghouse Blvd. The environment is rather stark with the big exception of the Austin Powers movie poster. Count on hamburgers and hot dogs and good fries. You order when you walk in the door then they call out what you ordered. They have a condiment bar and customers doctor their food themselves. Best part: the extremely friendly owners. When I'm wanting the basics I'll go back."}
{"text":"I used to frequent the location off of 7th Street & Hawthorne Lane until it moved/closed down.  Yes, I've been to this location also and it's definitely not the same.  They are SLOOOOOOW to make your order even though all they have to do is grill some beef patties!!!  Sorry but......SpongeBob could make a crabby pattie burger faster. haha"}
