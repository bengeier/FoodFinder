{"text":"After reading so many positive reviews, I decided to try this place out. The food was good, the restaurant itself had a nice atmosphere, and I can't complain about the service- but in my opinion it didn't live up to the hype. I'm also not convinced that the prices justify the quality/selection you are getting. 

I am happy I tried it out and overall had a positive experience, but I'm not sure it is somewhere I would come back. 

Also, they only take credit cards or cash, no debit."}
{"text":"I came to Da Emma on a Friday night around 6pm, right when they open for dinner service. I adore the architecture/layout/atmosphere with the heavy metal doors and the rustic feel of the ex-womens' prison. 

If you look to your right upon entering the restaurant, you'll see boards filled with pictures of eminent celebrities, athletes, randoms posing with I guess, Da Emma. Knowing that Angelina Jolie, Diane Kruger, Joshua Jackson, George Clooney (to name a few) had also dined at Da Emma made the experience more memorable.

We were seated right away and brought a plate of bruschetta and the menu. The bruschetta was more like a salty olive oil-ed sponge, not impressed. Our server literally plopped the all-Italian menu in front of us and peaced out with no explanation, no translation (even thought my boyfriend is Italia, he struggled with some of the items). 

We ended up ordering the leg of lamb ($35) and veal ($30?). You have a choice of sides: veggies (pickled potatoes, 2 slices of eggplant, 2 slices of zucchini) or rotini with tomato sauce. The main dishes were enormous. If you are on the fence when it comes to lamb, I suggest you steer away from it at Da Emma. It's way too big- I couldn't manage half of it. The veal was amazing though! 

All in all, the food was alright. Nothing too exciting. Our server was slow, cold, and intimidating, which is exactly what Da Emma is like."}
{"text":"The setting is unique ( former women's prisson) and as our hotel concierge suggested we had a wonderful and interesting experience. The appetizers we had for sharing : meatballs(out of this world they melt in your mouth) saulmon carpaccio, and the burrata with tomatoes were unique. The place was another proof of the unbeatable quality places Montreal has to offer you can't miss Da Emma."}
{"text":"Meh .
Da Emma has now officially joined the ranks of \"just any other Italian restaurant\" in Montreal.

This used to be my favourite Italian restaurant in Montreal. I would make it a must stop for everything from birthdays to wedding anniversaries, to graduation fetes. I'm not quite sure what happened here. :(
Between getting cold (yes, COLD) pasta sides to getting a different side from the one that I had ordered, albeit without even having been told. All the way to not even getting acknowledged half the night by our server (I had to flag him down most of the time. Really?! When many main dishes are over $40, why am I running after servers?) To getting bottled water when it was never even requested. I had even asked to get another table in the restaurant (as it was pretty much half empty) and the table I asked for didn't even have a \"reservation\" sign on it. No big deal, right? Wrong. I was awkwardly told \"Sorry, we save that other two-spot table in case we have to push two sets together for a party of four\". Okay, that's fine.
Know what happened? 
They pushed the tables together alright - for another couple. They had their nice big spot and we stayed put. What happened to saving it for a party of four? Am I missing something here?... 
What a disappointment. Cold food is never okay. Off nights happen, but it won't change that I'm likely not going to go back. Having been to many top restaurants in New York City like Babbo, Del Posto and Scarpetta, I'd say Da Emma should re evaluate their service. Times are tough, people! If you want to keep charging your exorbitant prices you better make it worth the customers' time and money. What a shame."}
{"text":"Great historical place. Emma's grandson served me at the bar and was a fine chap. Good Italian home cookin in a swanky but humble place."}
{"text":"Please do not believe the people who act like NYTimes food critics. This is hands down the best Italian food you can get outside of Italy- and my husband said it is  better than some of the meals we ate in Rome. First off, our sweet concierge told us that this was her favorite restaurant in all of Montreal so we knew (hoped) we were in for a treat. It is in the bottom of an old women's prison. How cool is that?!? We were sat at a table for two (right near a concrete pole that someone else complained about- really?!) and other than the normal noise of a restaurant (someone else complained about the low ceilings making it too loud- again really?!) we felt like we were the only 2 on our date. The restaurant is beautiful and the fact that the walls have stories to tell makes it even better! Immediately upon sitting, you are delivered the most mouth watering bruschetta you'll ever taste. The wine list is fabulous- we had a chianti we'd never tried before, not too expensive but probably some of the best I've had. I took a pic of the label. Some will be going in our wine cellar when we return home! We started with the soup of the day, stracciatella, which was out of this world! Our children would have gobbled it up had they been with us. Then a caprese salad- holy cow! The best mozzarella I've ever had. The tomatoes were thick sliced and to die for- and it's the middle of winter! I had eggplant parmigiana and my husband had the agnolotti. We HAD to split a veal meatball- AND SO DO YOU- if you don't order it for your main dish. They will allow you just to order one to try. Easily on par with anything in Italy. For dessert, no surprise- some of the greatest tiramisu to ever cross my lips. We also had coffee- a cappuccino for my husband and cafe latte for me- both delectable! To finish the meal - something else YOU MUST DO- a trip to the kitchen to meet Emma. As she was stirring boiling pasta and talking to her chefs, the delightfully small modest woman, took the time to chat with us briefly and even take a quick picture with us. She was so honored at what our concierge had told us. Brush up on your Italian because Emma is always in her kitchen or with her family- no time to learn English or French (don't worry- your server will help you talk to her). This was one of the greatest New Years dinners ever! And, on probably one of their busiest nights in a year, our service was perfect. If you are ever in Montreal, this has to be on your MUST DO list. You will not be sorry you did."}
{"text":"I tried to like the food but it was just not possible...ordered the Petto, wasn't impressed, meat was veiny . Side dish of pasta too al dente & i am being kind, much like barely cooked. Waiter was clumsy and kept coming back to ask what was the order and still managed to get it wrong! Won't go again."}
{"text":"Best meal I'd ever had! And no one serves petto di vitello alla fornara in Vancouver that I can find?! 

Three veal breasts done in white wine/rosemary that melt in your mouth before you even chew it! Amazing!! I didn't care for the salty, mushy broccoli that it came with though.

My husband had the burata with prosciutto and loved it!! He was then too full to eat his lamb, but he didn't care! 

Only four stars because the server was neither friendly nor attentive. He did recommend the petto though, so I am grateful, and I would love to eat it again!

Message me if you know a restaurant in Vancouver that serves this dish please!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food ! And romantic atmosphere ! The mushroom goes with pasta is  very delicious . Salmon is fresh and tasty also. Definitely worth to try !"}
{"text":"Meatballs were fantastic, service was great, the rest of the menu was good but in general too salty."}
{"text":"You've got to be kidding me.
 Name should be D'enema!!
 We were so encouraged by the movie star etc. photos at the entrance. That's usually the sign of true high end dining. This was NOT the case!
This was true tourist trap dining.
Corny waiter/s, overcooked commercial quality salmon, plain-jane pasta,  just a total BUST!

And so much great food in this town we could've done!!

Never again for this guy!!"}
{"text":"I found this Montreal gem during a recent trip.  It was the last meal during my time in Montreal and let's just say I saved the best for last.  I would without a doubt recommend this restaurant to those looking to have a little taste of Italy.  My family and I had the pleasure meeting Emma...she's a sweet lady who loves what she does...and I love what she does too."}
{"text":"Fantastic meal in a wonderful atmosphere. Nice covered outdoor patio for those hot breezy summer days.
The food is outstanding (I particularly recommend the petto) and as fresh as it can get. Even the pasta in tomato sauce, served as a side dish, can sound ordinary, but it blew my mind.
The drinks are potent and the staff is engaging.
A bit pricier than other restaurants, but in this case you can say that you get your money's worth."}
{"text":"Great food, wonderful experience.  Meatballs are my favorite.  You'll spend the night pointing out the stars on the wall full of pictures with celebs"}
{"text":"Probably my fvourite Italian in Montr√©al! Delicious wines and outstaning, super simple Italian dishes. Grandma Emma still cooks and rocks the kitchen. Simply amazing!"}
{"text":"Best Italian food I have ever had. Setting is super neat - lower section of building with some cool rock etc.  We had; Lamb(wow), fettuccine with mushrooms, lasagna, eggplant parmesan. All were way beyond expectations. Service was very good, fun, spot on. And we got to meet Emma.. Amazing!"}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere... Outstanding service... The wine the food was magnificent! A great experience all around... We allowed our waiter to select the courses and wine... It was exquisite."}
{"text":"Da Emma is amazing.

I wish I could have Emma as my personal chef. 

The pasta dishes are to die for.

The cheeses and bruschetta are delicious.

The steak is HUGE and could be shared between 2 people.

The decor is elegant.

Amazing experience and I would definitely go back there in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Over priced. Not an authentic Italian restaurant as I thought it would be. I went for dinner with someone from Italy and he was very disappointed and disgusted. The pasta that was proposed by the waiter as being their best dish: \"fettuccine with funghi porcini\" was not what We expected, and to top it off, in the plate of the person that was with me THERE WAS A DEAD WORM. We informed the waiter and he agreed that it did look like a worm and apologized. He then went to show the kitchen, and came back denying it was a worm but said that it was part of the mushroom. Which is not possible. The more we insisted the more we weren't taken seriously and they didn't want to admit that it was effectively a worm. We even showed a picture off the internet to demonstrate that those types of mushrooms can get worms and that it can happen as long as you admit it and don't make me pay for the plate! This didn't happen, yet the owner did not come speak to us, it was always the waiter, and the only thing they did was offer us a glass of wine because of \"the situation\". Two plates of pasta, 25$ each and a caprese salad 20$, total exaggeration for what your eating! You must know that you leave knowing you will spend over 100$. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"Beautiful setting and authentic food! Buratta with tomatoes, Fettuccine with mushrooms and the meatballs with pasta. All amazing! Tomatoes tasted so fresh and they were a big size. Meatballs very tender!"}
{"text":"Ordered the salmon and veal with tirimisu for dessert. Very good food, dessert was to die for. A little pricey but the fact that the food is consiatantly good makes it it. The location is very nice As well. Definitely a romantic setting."}
{"text":"Server was un attentive, made horrible recommendations, food was mediocre at best and price was grossly unequivocal to level of product. Unless you have never experienced your Nonna's cooking, you would probably think this place was good. 2 Thumbs Down from a Food Critic.."}
{"text":"This place is sick. It's run by a very cute Italian woman. Suuuuper nice lady. Food is amazing and has great food. Yyeeees."}
{"text":"When a fellow foodie friend of mine (say that three times fast) informed me this was either his favorite or second favorite restaurant in town I knew I had to try it. When I was able to get reservations for that night (granted it was a Thursday) I figured it was fate and I had to stop by. I'm so very glad I did.

We arrived right on time for our reservation and were seated promptly. The waiter stopped by, took cocktail orders, dropped off some bruschetta, and left us with the oil board menu which is entirely in Italian. After staring at it for a good few minutes and taking pride in being able to identify a small handful of the items, the waiter came back to explain what it was we were reading.

We started with the caprese, which was done up very simply and exactly how I wanted it - fresh and not overly elaborate. For my main I tried the pork osso bucco. If you know anything about me it's probably that I love osso bucco; if I see it on the menu I'm ordering it. This was probably the most unique osso bucco I'd ever had. It had a sauce that was white wine based as opposed to red, and had a flavor that I wasn't expecting. Don't get me wrong - it was awesome, but just off center. My wife went for the veal meatballs, which were melt-in-your-mouth amazing but not in the least bit brittle. The one thing I didn't care too much for was the fact that the pasta that was served with everything seemed like more of an afterthought than anything. Granted with my dish it didn't matter too much, but it would have been nice to have had some great pasta to go with the meatballs.

After we were finished dining our service took a severe turn for the worse. We weren't able to flag down our waiter for a good 10 minutes after finishing our meals. Not to be deterred, we still went with dessert (wasn't going to let that affect our meal), and we tried the tiramisu. Simply outstanding.

I'd love to go back, and I'm sure this is a 5 star place. But the server disappearing for a solid 10 minutes and the pasta really do knock this place down one notch. But even still, my recommendation is still this - go! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This was a nice Italian joint in the city. Was in the basement of an older building, converted from a old jail. Food was a bit expensive for Italian, but you could tell the ingredients mattered to the chef and were fresh. During our meal several items were crossed off the menu for the evening which is proof. I would recommend stopping by for some of their fresh buffalo mozz!"}
{"text":"If I could, I'd give it 3.5 stars.

The food is pretty good, but nothing spectacular -- especially for the price.

The atmosphere is really neat; the restaurant is in the basement of an old prison. Sounds weird, but there's something very Italian-wine-cellar about it, especially the way they've turned it around. The service was incredible -- some of the best I've ever had.

The menus are written on large frames scattered around the restaurant. The server brought one beside our table as we enjoyed pre-meal drinks and complimentary bruschetta (which was fantastic) and let us pore it over -- separated into categories (appetizer, pasta, mains, etc) but just the name of the dish and its price. He then returned and explained briefly what each dish was -- there were at least 40. This is part of why the service was fantastic. After going through the whole list, he asked us what we were interested in; from there, we narrowed down our choices and selected what we'd like for the night.

My girlfriend got the lasagna, which was pretty good. Tasty, hearty, creamy -- noodles cooked properly, and the portion size was pretty good. I had sauteed steak strips with onion and garlic, garnished with cold arugula. This was nice, seasoned properly and with the right amount of oil to hold its own once the arugula began to wilt and become part of the hot portion of the dish.

The tiramisu was the best I'd ever had in my life -- not much more to say about that.

Holding us back was the price. The value just wasn't there. For $150 -- two cocktails, two glasses of wine, two entrees and a dessert -- it seemed a little much. Just a little.


On our way out, we noticed the pictures on the wall. Emma (the chef) is pictured with many A-list celebrities -- Leonardo DiCaprio, George Clooney, Angelina Jolie, Halle Berry, Steven Spielberg... the list goes on -- but we were surprised. Sure, the place was pretty good, but we've had much better Italian food in the past. The price is what threw us off the most; the value was just not there.

One thing we did notice was the age of the photos -- these were taken at least a decade ago. Perhaps this place is past its peak."}
{"text":"A trip to Italy minus the airfare! From our burrata starter to the porcini mushroom fettuccine, veal saltimbocca, grilled salmon and panna cotta dessert, everything was done to perfection. Very fresh, high quality food in ample portions for sharing. The wine list is superb and we discovered a Venetian white by Zenato that went well with everything. Can't wait to go back in the summer when the terrasse is open!"}
{"text":"Great food and a super wine list.
I had the veal meatballs which were some of the best I have ever eaten.
3 the size of large tennis balls in a wonderful red gravy with pasta.

The staff got very busy as the night went on around 7:30 - 8:00 and lost there focus on things like filling the water glass, wine bottle refills or seeing if we wanted desert. 
The hard floor and low celling  made for a very loud meal but no worse than 90% of all restaurants and did add an energy to the meal.
Since its in the basement  (the building at one time was a jail) and must be 300 years old, many of the tables for 2 are butt up to a stone post which is a drag and felt a little tight.
The eggplant app was amazing and very unlike anything I have had in the past.
Visit Da Emma, you will be very happy you did, go hungry, you will leave full."}
{"text":"Alone at the bar. Always great here. Having Arugala salad and half a portion of the amazing tortellini. Glass of Valpolacello. Great staff - love it here"}
{"text":"This restaurant was amazing, service from our waiter Renato was impeccable and he recommended some of the top dishes made by Emma. My husband and I each started off with a salad and shared the Gnocchi with veal meat sauce (holy cow!!). Renato explained the Gnocchi to us like this \"they are little clouds that melt in your mouth\" he was 110% accurate. For our main course we had the suckling baby pig brisket and veal chop, both incredibly tender, tasty and phenomenal. Last but not least, Renato asked if we wanted to meet Emma and we did, she is a amazing woman who has actually met so many celebrities. Thank you for the meal, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Great old school Italian but the service was abysmal to start, it's unfortunate because they don't know how to deal with large parties and we were 16. I called a few times to let them know that we had alto of little kids and needed to be served quickly and they assured us it was no problem. However, it took an hour for our kids to get their food. Overall the food was good but I have eaten better. I would come back but for all the money I spent I would like better service. I also told the hostess and the waiter and they didn't seem to care. Lift your game da emma."}
{"text":"This is a restaurant that I was so excited to try that I made the dinner reservation before booking our hotel reservation. All I can say is that the meal was absolutely incredible. I am baffled that this wonderful  establishment recieved negative reviews. If you enjoy great food, service and booze - This is the place to be.

We started off with a very warm welcoming from the hostess and two waiters.  We recieved a complimentary bruschetta followed by two drinks shortly thereafter. After we finished the delish bruschetta  (the olive oil was trenendous) our waiter, Franco, greeted us with a warm welcoming smile and asked if we would like a walk through the menu. Naturally, we said yes, and Franco went through every item on the menu with absolute precision. We would stop Franco to ask questions and suggestions to which he responded gracefully. Thank you Franco. 

My wife started off with the minnestroni soup and I ordered an appetizer portion of the fettuccini au funghi porcini. For our main course my wife ordered the Lasagna and I ordered the Veal scaloppine alla zingara.  We ordered a bottle of chianti as well.

The entire meal was delicious. I come from a very traditional New York Italian family, so I like to think that I have good taste in Italian food. Franco suggested not to add cheese to the fettuccini and I complied. Good thing because I can see the salt from the cheese could throw the flavors and balance off of the dish. Well said Franco. The minnestroni soup was fresh and delicious. Yum. My veal dish was the best and most tender veal dish that I have her had. I've eaten at restaurants like Il Milino, Don Peppes, Carmines, and my mother's kitchen and I still believe this was the best veal dish that I've had. My wife loved her lasagna. I thought the gravy was a little sweet, but she loved it - she's has great taste too.  

After dinner, we had a lovely conversation with Franco regarding Montreal, sports, family, etc"}
{"text":"Really good food but it was cold. The waiter had a very so/so attitude. He was not very interested. The rabbit I had was also over cooked. However, the flavors on all our food was fabulous. When I explained to him honestly that the food was cold and must have sat around he agreed but took nothing off the bill. I tipped him appropriately."}
{"text":"I love this place. Your led downstaris into an old jali house where you dine inside of a cell. This place is a gem. Food is not the best but def price appropriate but the ambiance is one of a kind."}
{"text":"Da Emma is da-licious! This restaurant was recommended to us by a staff member at our hotel, saying it was \"A-1\" and the best restaurant for Italian that you could find. So, with that in mind, we walked the 10-15 blocks to the Restaurant Da Emma, hoping for a meal we would not forget...trust me, we won't! It is in the basement of a large building, a few blocks away from the action of shops, people, etc. You walk down the flight of stairs, through a couple of what look like warehouse doors, and into the elegant entry area. Walking towards the front counter, we noticed multiple large class frames house many pictures of very famous people (Robert Downey Jr., Dustin Hoffman, the guy from
Slumdog Millionaire, etc.). Walking to the front counter, the woman asked if we had reservations, unfortunately the answer to that was no. She hesitated and was explaining that it was very hard to get in here and you need reservations, but she did end up letting us have a table as long as we were done by 8:30. Fine with us! We were then waited on by a very friendly, funny, yet proper waiter. The menu was incredibly extensive (yes, expensive, but incredible & worth it). we ordered, and a little while later our food was delivered...YUM! It was heavenly! Everyone loved their meal and ate every last bite! Now it's dessert (oh yeah!). We ordered both lemon & orange sorbets to share (best decision of our entire lives)! they are served in whatever fruit flavor you order (example: the orange sorbet was served in the \"shell\" of an orange). This was a superb presentation and the sorbet was so incredible, I think I might just order that every day of my life (even of they would have to ship it to California)! 

 Overall, one of the best dining experiences I have EVER had, and definitely the place to go when in or near Montreal!!"}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant. Excellent food. A great concept - set in an old prison. A true fine dining experience - a well thought out date specific menu. A worthy experience!!"}

{"text":"Great ambiance as it's built out of an old women's prison. The food is sensational and the service is fantastic."}
{"text":"went there this past weekend with friends who are regulars, the food was good/ok. My artichoke starter was delish but the lamb was greasy and lacking in flavour. Service was scattered. I'd go again if someone else was making the reservations. All in all it was a fun night out with friends but we could have had just as much fun anywhere and probably spent less $$ for better food."}
{"text":"The pasta was amazing, the service was incredible and meeting Emma was such a joy. I couldn't believe how amazing every bite was, I'm just sorry couldn't eat more but even ordered a second plate of pasta to take home."}
{"text":"Lamb. That's all you have to know. The roasted lamb is one of their signature dishes and a must. Lamb. Eat light to start because the lamb portion is large and you'll want to eat all of it. Lamb. We also had the gnocchi and Eggplant Parma that were also amazing. Lamb."}
{"text":"Sept 2012 - Was here on a trip with friend for adventure.  This restaurant apparently is in an old women's prison and the cab found it hard to find so we used our phones for GPS.  You go down some stairs and it's really fascinating as the interior is intact.  Apparently Italian lady is the authentic and lots of celebs come there.  Menu is in Italian on chalkboard but waiter will help you understand if you don't.  We had so many items...salads, procuitto, meatballs, and on and on. It's was all AMAZING and worth it."}
{"text":"Simply the best Italian place I have ever been to!!!! The ambiance and waiters are amazing. It's an old school home cook like feel and a little romantic as well. The veal is very good!!!"}
{"text":"Their Roman style cuisine is good, but I have had better Italian dinners in my home neighborhood of North Beach, San Francisco.  

I will give them an extra star for being in an interesting location (former women's prison)."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful dinner at Da Emma!

Granted, it wasn't a traditional dinner -- there were about 30+ people for my cousin and his fiancee's pre-rehearsal dinner for out-of-towners.

First of all, the setting is spectacular. Walking downstairs into a converted women's prison, the stone walls and somewhat dark atmosphere are more romantic than ominous. 

T here's a wall of photos of celebrities with Emma (Bill Clinton, George Clooney), so we knew we were in a great place. 

The food is fantastic, and so is the service. 

They created a special menu of the restaurant's most popular dishes. 

We tried:

-- Bufalo mozzarella with tomatoes and prosciutto. Absolutely fresh and the cheese was divine.

-- Fettuccine with fresh porcini mushrooms, olive oil and white wine. Perfectly fresh and awesome.

-- Agnolotti stuffed with veal and meat sauce. YUM. 

-- Tiramisu, served in a bowl. Certainly homemade. 

The bread is fresh and soft. The servings are quite generous.

I would absolutely return next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"The perfect IItalian restaurant in Old Town Montreal!!!!  The venue and service is delightful.  The food is excellent, especially the homemade pastas.  I had the porcini pasta that was so intense with flavor, it reminded me  the dinner I had in Milan 30 years ago.  At the end of the meal our friend and  the waiter took us to meet Mama in the kitchen."}
{"text":"You'll never have raviolis like the one's served at Da Emma, out of this world.  And don't get me started with their tiramisu.  The bill adds up but it's worth it for a special occasion place."}
{"text":"Great food but the prices are a bit too much considering this is a former prison. Popular because a bunch of celebrities have frequented the place so if you're into Leonardo or Angelina this is for you. I ordered the roasted piglet and it was amazing but the pasta side dish that accompanied it was lackluster. And a single meatball a la carte was $8..."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times...

Fish:  not so good, drowned in sauce

Meatballs: looked good in size

Mozzarella & Basil : fresh, tasty

Pasta & Mushroom Course:  average, nothing special

Atmosphere:  it was supposedly an old women's prison, so it was disturbing thinking a lot of women & criminals suffered where I am now trying to eat a meal. 

The chef ( the woman I guess who owns it too) took us back to the kitchen and was completely sweet!"}
{"text":"What a dining experience! After hearing many people rave about Da Emma for quite some time, I decided to give it a go. Located on De La Commune in the western part of the Old Port, what once was a women's prison is now a charming Italian eatery. Where to begin? 

I decided to split the tortelloni with my wife. Stuffed with 4 different cheeses and minced prosciutto topped with a Gorgonzola sauce, this pasta plate is NOT for those who are lactose intolerant. Very rich, very creamy,  very good! 

Next was the meatballs in a marinara sauce. I highly recommend this for anyone who loves italian meatballs like their Nonna used to make them. 

Finally, I had oven roasted lamb which was cooked in it's own juices with white wine and olive oil for over an hour. The house specialty. The meat was succulent,  melt in your mouth goodness! Each bite was better than the last. For a meat course,  this is the way to go. 

For dessert (yes I decided to stuff it all in!), I shared the  tiramisu which was the perfect way to end a great meal coupled with a beautiful cappuccino. 

Great great meal,  and the lobby filled with Hollywood A-listers clearly agree.

***Note to all future diners: be prepared to walk it off. Luckily it is located by the waterfront with a beautiful view of the city."}
{"text":"I love this resturant the food is so authentic ,Fresh and delicious you definitely will love it. We were a group of four people on Thursday night and the resturant was full...Emma was busy cooking in the kitchen I had to go say hello . Amazing to still  see the love she puts in all her dishes and the warm welcome she gave me after I intruded in her kitchen .  I had the homemade gnocchis which Emma recommended my husband had the  pork leg  dish it was perfectly cooked, delicious and fresh. My two other friends had the leg of lamb and jumbo meatballs which also delicious .  I can't wait to go back..."}
{"text":"Ended my Montreal trip w a visit to Da Emma after hearing so much about it. And honestly after dining there, I'm not exactly sure why. Yes, the pasta is made fresh but so many places nowadays make fresh pasta. The atmosphere is definitely interesting. It's located in a unassuming building and is dark, intimate, and welcoming all at the same time. 

Service was a bit strange. Our waiter disappeared and reappeared randomly and it took a while for him to finally stop at our table to go through the menu with us. He went through the apps and pastas with us and blew off the meats/entrees and we never got the dessert list or had a chance to order dessert. Odd, but oh well. 

We started off the burrata at his recommendation and it was absolutely delicious paired w the prosciutto. Then came the pastas. I got the mushroom fettuccine after seeing so many reviews and the boyfriend ordered the gnocchi with meat sauce. The mushroom fettuccine definitely was the better of the two. It's a very simple dish and I was expecting more flavors initially but it grows on you. While the gnocchi was cooked perfectly, the sauce was so bland. Not worth ordering. You could get better gnocchi elsewhere.

How would I describe my meal here? Safe. It's a safe Italian pick and there's nothing wrong with that."}
{"text":"An amazing setting in a former women's prison.  Food was delicious, service was impeccable, but they could use more vegetarian options.  The grilled salmon was great but what I would return for is a plate of their super garlicky pasta!  A little pricey so just 4 stars."}
{"text":"Another \"go to\" restaurant while in Montreal. The property is a former women's prison and the stone walls and historic decor lends itself to a one of a kind dining experience. The meal was delicious , I had the lamb, while my husband has the steak. Both done to perfection. The only reason I took a star off is that our waiter forgot about us once we placed our order. We enjoyed a leisurely meal, but there is a fine line between enjoying our meal and desperately wanting your  check. My his and finally had to go ask the manager for the bill so we could pay."}
{"text":"Great Restaurant. Fantastic Food and Wonderful atmosphere. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Best place yet. Rivals nonnas meatballs, but don't tell her that! Everything was absolutely spectacular. Service was amazing, atmosphere was amazing, everything was amazing. 10/10 recommend. The even have a wall of celebrities who've been there, including Jonny depp and vin diesel!"}

DaEmma is run by the family matriarch, a non English speaking, 76 year old woman, in the kitchen cooking from start to finish each day!  Located in an old underground women's prison (the first in North America, I believe) and an awesome experience."}
{"text":"Great authentic Italian food in a neat atmosphere. A little sketchy when you first pull up in the alley but don't fear once you get down the ramp to the front door, it's worth the effort. Great selection of pastas and wine. Neat atmosphere in an old women's prison and plenty of interesting architecture while you are there."}
{"text":"Loved the vibe of the place! Menu was hard to understand as it was in French, but food and service  great."}
{"text":"There seems to be a lot of Italian food in Montreal, and I'm not totally convinced that this is the best. It's very solid food, authentic, and tasty but it's a bit on the pricey side. I suppose with all the celebrities touted on the wall, they can rest on their laurels a bit and command a pretty penny for their food. Don't get me wrong, the food was good, but I think I could find a better meal or better Italian food in Montreal for cheaper.

The ambiance is pretty cool, as it was in what used to be a women's prison. There are no printed menus, so don't go searching or asking for one when you sit down - they will bring you a written menu on a chalkboard to your table (all written in Italian), and will explain it to you. They will also bring you a piece of bruschetta to start your meal.

We were a party of 4 and shared all the dishes family style, which I would recommend so that you can try a little bit of everything.

The best dishes were the eggplant parmigana, fettucini with porcini mushrooms, and the shrimp.  The eggplant parmigana had really good flavor and was decently sized. The pasta was homemade, fresh, and you could just taste all the flavors of the porcini - don't leave without getting this pasta. The shrimp was very fresh, large, and really dense. Well seasoned and perfectly cooked.

We also got the caprese (good, but not outstanding), the smoked salmon carpaccio with arugula (good, but I can make this at home), and the veal ravioli (good, but just tasted like a pretty standard meat ravioli to me with tomato sauce).

All in all, good food, authentic, and delicious. Some of the dishes were certainly better than others, It was pricey for Italian food - we each paid about $75 CAD and didn't drink any wine. I enjoyed my meal but don't think I'd come back here again and again."}
{"text":"We chose Da Emma due to the Yelp reviews and this was the first time we were disappointed by Yelp (we use it a lot, even at home).

Yes, the atmosphere is unique and interesting, the restaurant is clean and orderly, the salads were very tasty (including the cheese), the waiter was very attentive and humerous, but the food just wasn't up to par. Yelp had also steered us away from Little Italy, and we were hoping we would hit on something better.

The Osso Bucco is a different, Roman-type preparation, which the waiter explained up front. I found it slightly tough and on the bland side. The broccoli was over-cooked and way too salty. The pasta is non-descript. Given this, the restaurant is overpriced in my opinion.

My husband had a fish dish that tasted pretty good. He seemed to like it but didn't rave. He couldn't remember which one it was.

Our friend ordered a pasta dish and said it was good, but it didn't look extraordinary at all. We wouldn't try it again or recommend it to others."}
{"text":"I am my friend were directed here by the concierge at our hotel for an Italian meal. Once we arrived it was in the old stone building that had once been a women's prison which is interesting from a historical standpoint.at first our waiter was a bit rough and standoffish but is the meal one on he warmed up and we found them to be quite interesting. My biggest disappointment  was an Italian restaurant that did not make its own pasta in house."}
{"text":"Not much to say besides that this is the best Italian restaurant in Montreal.  This is the best kept secret in MTL, as most A-listers from Hollywood have eaten there.  To give you an idea on the quality of the ingredients, the Mozzarrela di Bufala I had on a Friday was produced in Italy on the Monday!  From the pasta to the meats, to the excellent wine list, this place deserves high praise.  The atmosphere is intimate and sets the mood perfectly for the meal you're about to experience!  If you're looking to splurge, here's your best bet!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a delicious dinner here during a long weekend in Montreal. Great service and the waiter was able to help us with the menu because it was all in Italian. Was a bit disappointed they ran out of the burrata for the night but had the delicious Caprese Buffala, which had a huge ripe tomato and mozzarella stuffed in it. For dinner I had the ravioli and my husband had the meatballs. As Italians we're always critical of the sauce and the sauce here was delicious! Very romantic ambiance and nice dining experience. Would definitely recommend and come back!"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to dinner at Da Emma's given my boyfriend's rave reviews. Boy was I disappointed.

The atmosphere was nice. Dimly lit but not overly so. Reasonable noise level. Tables were spaced apart enough that we could have our own private conversation. The service was pretty good as well - no complaints there.

But the food was OK at best. Realistically deserving of three stars but the fact that it was overpriced, I took away another star and am giving Da Emma two stars.

Here's what we ordered:
- agnolotti (stuffed with meat): Average. I've had better and I've had worse.
- tiger shrimp in wine sauce: Again average. There were five shrimps on the plate... for forty-five bucks.
- veal stew: BLAND... TASTELESS... FLAVOURLESS. Am I being ambiguous?

It's possible Emma had an off night but I'm not dishing out another couple hundred bucks to find out."}
{"text":"I don't write about every restaurant I eat at, just the ones that show something special. This is truly a five star old school Italian restaurant. Anyone who gives it less is just screwing with the ratings (and I've been to most of the north beach restaurants). Got recommended by the concierge at the Marriott. I applaud anyone who could find it without a taxi. It is less than nondescript from the outside. Once you go down the stairs and through the industrial door you come upon a busy place. People will find good food. The menu is in Italian. It is extensive and the staff is happy to translate. The wine lists also extensive and all Italian. The sugar packs are from Italy. Getting the pattern here. They are not afraid to scream old Italy because they can do it first class. Soup of the day was stingray soup. I was thinking Asian, but noodles in seafood broth  with shredded stingray fin was right off the coast of Italy. There were so many great things on the menu. I chose the Osso bucco, great. My wife had the fettuccine with mushrooms, fantastic. Would I go again. You bet. I will say I asked them to call me a cab to get back to the hotel, after all it is near old town but a little of the beaten track."}
{"text":"I was recommended by a friend to come here for some Italian food and was not let down. Our waiter translated all of the menu to English for us and was very attentive - possibly some of the best service I have gotten at a restaurant. We shared the salmon carpaccio and prosciutto with cheese for appetizers. Both dishes were flavourful. As for the main course, I had the fettuccine with mushrooms and being the pasta lover I am, despite being quite full from the carbs, I knew I couldn't waste a single bite! The pasta dish was simple but delicious and cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"One of the most simple dishes yet best I have had. Buretta cheese with tomato. Like everything simple but effective. Yum"}
{"text":"While staying in Montreal we have dined at Da Emma twice. It's in the basement of what once was a women's prison. It's been transformed into a beautiful, cozy setting. It is more of an upscale restaurant with top notch service and meals to match. We'll be back. Delicious. Nice for special occasions."}
{"text":"So I know this place is very popular and gets recommended a lot. But I have to be honest about my critic and not give it a high score just because everyone else did. So here is my take on Da emma.

Walked-in to this old dark place, very little lighting, which wasn't a big surprise as I knew this use to be a prison. Sit down and waiter comes immediately, please take into account that this is my first time at this place, and we tell him this. Then he says okay okay I will bring you some nice artichoke to start then I will bring you our famous delicious rack of lamb with potatoes on the side, I will also bring you pork chops, which I told him I don't eat pork. So then it's like he got thrown off, okay okay then I will make you veal breast with rosemary and spaghetti with a nice rich homemade tomato sauce. So we said okay, And he left, I kept asking myself if the had menus but didn't see anyone with it so I just presumed this is how it work. 

5 minutes later our appetizers arrive, he brings me  a plate of prosciutto  and and a small plate of artichoke .... Ummmm didn't i just mention I don't eat pork??? Anyways, then the waiter just stand at our table waiting for us to eat (that really annoyed me) artichoke  sucked to hard, too oily. 

Then the main meal came, OMG the veal was over powered by rosemary, you could 't actually taste the meat, the lamb did not smell good and was too dry. The potatoes were also overwhelmed by rosemary and the pasta was not good at all. Honestly if your homemade sauce is tomato paste you need to rethink about your recipe.

With our food we had ordered a bottle of flat water and a glass of wine.  

So like I mention since we never got a menu we never knew the prices either. At the end we just didn't enjoy our food and just wanted to get out of there, we declined coffee and dessert. We asked for the bill. 289$ Are you crazy????? Omg that much money for that mediocre food. Ughhh I will never go back and I definitely will not recommend it. 

Oh by the way as I was leaving the restaurant, we realized they had a menu, its written on a blackboard that they bring to your table. Our stupid waiter never even mentioned it. Royally pissed off!"}
{"text":"This was not only a great meal; it was also a great experience.  I can say with complete confidence that Emma provided one of the top 10 meals of my entire life.  The atmosphere is top notch and the food is exquisite.  Lots of restaurants claim to be authentic, but when I had the opportunity to go back to the kitchen and meet Emma I knew this establishment's reputation for excellence is well deserved.

Every single thing I tasted from start to finish was unbelievably good.  I couldn't hope to possibly find a better dining experience in Montreal.  Eat here.  You will not regret it."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, the food was fantastic and the waiter was very knowledgeable. A must try!"}
{"text":"We were told this restaurant would be good. But it was actually mouth wateringly delicious!  This restaurant is phenomenal and the staff are absolutely lovely. The food portions are beyond generous. I had the swordfish and when I was done, it looked like I had not even made a dent. As we were leaving, I thanked our server for such a great experience. It truly was one of the best meals I ever had. They then took me into the kitchen to meet the owner, Emma!  She is 73 and would never know it. Not only was she cooking up a storm all night but she is such a lovely lady. She greeted me with open arms. Her who family is involved in the restaurant and you can tell the all have pride in their Nonna's restaurant. 
Your taste buds will thank you for coming her!"}
{"text":"Restaurant Da Emma was the highlight of a quick visit to Montreal, and the recommendation of our hotel concierge.

It was a cold and rainy night, so being unfamiliar with the city, we took a cab.  We found that the cab rules are more relaxed in Montreal than you find in spots like NYC, and were able to easily and without extra charge load 5 people into a sedan for the 10 block ride.

The entrance to the restaurant is a dark, descending staircase. We held the cab thinking that the restaurant must be closed. Happily, the door opened and so began a delicious and memorable meal.

The interior design of the restaurant is very pleasing and full of character, adding to the specialness of the visit. The menu is delivered in French and table side on a chalkboard. A flavorful bruschetta is served up pronto to tide over hungry patrons - you'll appreciate the offering since you'll need time and reflection to consider all the options.

My children wanted to modify their orders with \"hold this\" & \"can I substitute that..\". Our waiter's voice of reason came to my rescue, explaining to the children with directness that they would be wise to enjoy these special dishes in the way the chef intended.

A mother wanting to expose her boys to worldly cuisines will appreciate the intervention;  it gets tiresome when you're constantly talking your kids into new culinary experiences.

Happily, my children took our waiter's advice and enjoyed their meals just as designed by the chef. One son thoroughly enjoyed the Lamb, another enjoyed Gnocchi for the first time, \"they're like little pillows of deliciousness Mom\", and my 3rd son enjoyed the Swordfish which was prepared with an unexpected, savory sauce. It was more food than we could eat, the portions are most generous.

If you follow me on Yelp, you know I favor Italian restaurants; I loved this place and will return on my next visit to Montreal."}
{"text":"Sort of a strange experience here. We decided to try it because of a recommendation, and because it seemed like an interesting location - in a former women's prison. Although the underground restaurant is interesting and unique, that's not enough to carry the day.  The menu is handwritten on a large board that is stuck onto a very heavy music stand. For whatever his reason, our waiter insisted on parking this monstrosity inches from our table when not being used, even though there were plenty of other places to put it where it would not have bothered anyone. Service was not great, we should have been told that the appetizers were GIGANTIC! We got two and it was definitely one too many. But wow, what an appetizer! Definitely get the mozzarella and tomato! Excellent! But back to the service, at a place like this, it's reasonable  expect a little more than just writing down our orders, but that's really all he did. I wanted a beer and there are only two on the menu - fine, so I ask for a little info on them since they're both Italian and not very common. I got nothing. The entrees were very good, but not amazing. Overall, 4.5 for food, 2.5 for service, a generous 4 overall."}
{"text":"I am so sorry to say that this place is all hat and only a little cattle.   That is to say that even though George Clooney ate here ( 20 years ago , judging by the picture on the wall), it was a less that awesome dining experience.  All of the courses we tried were good,, but the errors by the servers regarding cocktails and water, and the sheer adequacy of the celebrated lamb and the not quite succulence of the rabbit cacciatore, made this a less than awesome dining experience.  No wonder Clooney hasn't been back since, this is a celebrity restaurant, not one for folks who actually appreciate innovative and interesting food.  We have several of these kinds of places in Miami, and I must say that we have found that Montreal has lots of places more deserving of your dollar."}
{"text":"Hands down, one of the best Italian meals I've had outside of the kitchen of a family member. If they have it, get the fettucini with funghi porcini, or any fettucini dish, as Emma makes this stuff in-house. It's the most fantastic fresh pasta ever. 

They start you off with a fresh slice of bruschetta drenched in olive oil. The service is excellent - our waiter was incredibly attentive and helpful all night, and even gave us some suggestions of where to visit after dinner. 

It's not going to be a cheap meal, but your money couldn't be better spent! It was a nice night when we went, so we ate outside, but the inside of the restaurant is really nice, so if you're only going to eat there once, I'd recommend eating indoors."}
{"text":"Apart from their beautiful setting and impeccable service, Da Emma does meat very, very well. In fact, when you order from the meat menu, you'll get exactly what you order. A plate of veal chop, for example, is a plate where sits a (seriously big) veal chop, all by its glory self. Worry not, it does come with either vegetables or pasta, but those are served on a separate plate. Thus, you can concentrate on your veal chop and give it the full credit that it deserves. I tried a bite of their roast pork and it was delicious too (though the veal chop was in a league of its own... so tender... flavourful... despite it being served with no sauce). Also worth mentioning is their pea and macaroni soup, which had a hint of spiciness and came in a generous helping. At $5, you can't beat that in a fine dining establishment! The other dishes aren't quite $5,  but for the location and quality of food, I think this place is worth every penny."}
{"text":"Outstanding authentic Italian food in a beautiful setting. Emma is a great chef and a very nice person. She takes the time to talk to her customers. Most of all, she has a true talent to make every dish feel like it was made at home by the best nonna ever. 
Everything I've tried on her menu was good. One tiny note: the salmon carpaccio is not actually raw salmon. It is simply a plate of smoked salmon and arugula. That was the only plate I found ordinary, but still good. 
The green peppercorn steak is a must and so it the tuna steak with tomato sauce."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by this place! Was staying at the W and the concierge recommended this place and managed to get our party of four a last minute reservation. We arrived at 8 and the restaurant was quite full but we were seated promptly. The setting was interesting, it was in the basement of what looked like a cellar but the atmosphere was classy and rustic. Service was excellent, the waiter came by and explained the menu which was written on a blackboard that was circulated around the restaurant and made some recommendations. Our party ordered several dishes to share and everything was quite good. The caprese salad, swordfish, and lamb pasta were my favourites! The place was a little pricey but well worth it. Overall, great experience and would come here again!"}
{"text":"El mejor restaurant italiano en Montreal. Emma es encantadora. Si vas a Montreal ese es un destino obligado. Los dependientes muy atentos y profesionales. La comida es importada de Italia. El queso mozzarella super fresco. Da Emma es cuna de grandes actores de Hollywood como George Clooney, Julia Roberts y otros famosos."}
{"text":"Was really expecting something special based on all the reviews but I'm sad to say my experience was borderline awful. 

To sum it up: the wine and bruschetta were the only good things we experienced. The service was awful - everything took forever, the waiter was all over the place (kept spilling wine and water when he filled our glasses because he was doing it really heavily and without paying attention), was pretty much unconcerned by our experience; my friends fettuccine was ice cold and he casually said he would warm it up and offered no apology or swap for another meal. The swordfish was suggested to me when I asked what fish was best (for 40$ i expect more than arugula, tomato sauce and strips of fish with cold potatoes on the side).

Overall really disappointed and will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Ho conosciuto questo ristorante tramite un amico Emanuele! Noi amiamo gli stessi piatti provenienti da Italia! il posto √® super bello e il servizio √® ottimo! Auguri Emma"}
{"text":"I love this place. Probably my favourite Italian restaurant. The food is simply amazing!! When alone, or with a friend, I really enjoy sitting at the bar. The bartenders are cool and you always end up meeting regular clients."}
{"text":"I hesitate to write resto reviews as I am not a qualified food writer. However tonight, on behalf of innocent tourists everywhere, I make an exception. On the recommendation of a friend - and a respected guidebook - my wife and I dined at Da Emma in Old Montreal. I should have known better when, upon entering, I noticed several dozen celebrity photos along the walls (notoriously a red flag within the industry). Although buoyed by the interesting character of the room - a former prison - and the busy bustling crowd, dinner was a major disappointment. Two appetizers - eggplant and a caprese salad - though large in size, were bland and indifferent. The tuna secondi, albeit cooked to order, was drowning in a red sea of tomato sauce that even Moses could not have parted; and my agnolotti pasta tasted as though it had bought from the nearest IGA and then forced to sit in the steam table for hours on end. It's as though the kitchen was manned by automatons going through the mechanical motions of preparing the founder's recipes.  
The only thing going for our experience was our Tunisian waiter, however even he gave up on us towards the end, forgetting to remove our plates, and bring us the bill. 
In a city renowned for its restaurants, there has to be better examples of memorable Italian cooking."}
{"text":"Excellent prosciutto and cheese appetizer. Great lasagna and veal meet balls. One of the best tiramisu I have had."}
{"text":"This restaurant is the cat's meow when it comes to Italian dining in Montreal. 

First, the venue. Da Emma's is in the bottom of a building that long, long ago, was once a women's prison.  But don't expect to be seated in an institutional-type setting (fear not, you won't be dining in a mess hall), as this restaurant instead has more ambiance, charm, character and history than I can remember eating at.    It is almost like you are dining in an old wine cellar, with wood beams and brick/granite - columns/walls.  Actually, it is very romantic and my wife agreed.

Second, the food.  Choices are as diverse as they are delicious.    Great selection of appetizers, pastas, seafood, and meats.   Probably the best veal ravioli I ever ate and the Tiramisu was to die for.  Pleasantly surprised to see that the prices were VERY reasonable for a fine dining establishment. 

Third, the service.   Attentive while not over-bearing.   Never wanted, nor needed, nor had to ask for anything, and this was on a crowded Saturday night. 

Fourth, if you don't want to take my word for how good Da Emma's is, perhaps the numerous celebrities who dined here will serve as a testament to this restaurant's reputation; too many to list or remember, but their photos adorn the wall into the dining area. 

I cannot find a single, solitary (no pun intended!) fault about our experience at Da Emma's.    

Reservations are an absolute must."}
{"text":"All I have to say is that this restaurant is one of the best experiences I've had dining out to date. 
This is a must go if you are visiting Montreal. Words cannot describe the how you feel when you are here.
That is all."}
{"text":"After a beautiful weekend visiting Montreal from NYC, our bliss was spoiled by the worst meal I've had in a long time. Deadbeat probably describes it best. I visited 7 years ago and had a beautiful meal with amazing service, but 20+ years serving and cooking the same exact menu it's no wonder the kitchen and service do not GAF.

As soon as we were seated I noticed the change in ambiance - no music, harsh lighting, odd crowd.  Our first indicator of a rough night was after I ordered a modest bottle (God forbid) of Chianti and our server told us he was passing us off to another server. Our second server didn't look us in the eye once. He seemed really unhappy when he had to explain the bare bones menu which is written in tiny writing on boards that get propped in front of your table which is usually fun except in this case we felt like we were basically getting an eye roll. We ordered the prosciutto and melon which was fine and both ordered veal entrees  as I recalled the veal being delicious. The veal breast was veal JERKY. I have never had a scallopini cut so dry and tough that I my knife was scraping against the plate making a horrible noise. The leg was possibly worse - so dry that each bite required a generous glug of wine. My boyfriend didn't mind the veal aglonotti but for me it was dense, tasteless, and with an very one dimensional tomato sauce. We weren't given choices of sides or checked up on throughout the meal at all. 

I don't mind the old school Italian approach of the menu style and dining experience, but there's no joy in any of it.  In general I can find the positive in every meal and walk out smiling. I would never insult the service or food. Give me bad food with mediocre service, I'lll smile.  Give me horrible service with mediocre food and I'll smile. But I was screaming inside during this whole meal. Everything was terrible. Terrible terrible terrible!"}
