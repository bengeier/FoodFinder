{"text":"Place is ridiculous.  Poor coordination of staff.  1.5hrs to get one drink and never got a server for food.  Not anything good to say."}
{"text":"Food, drinks, and atmosphere were good. Nice addition to Westgate. Only complaint is the management's inability to use a remote control and read a TV guide. We stopped in to watch the end of the Michigan vs OSU game. Of the 14 TV's on display, the game wasn't on any of them. We asked several times to change one of the TV's to the game and we're finally told that the game isn't televised. Instead the West Virginia vs Iowa state game played in our view."}
{"text":"I had a bad experience the other day with this business and had wrote a bad review.  I had went in on a Saturday and the waitress and manager at the time kept running my debit card through.  I was watching them run my card and watching my bank account go negative because they ran my card through 5 times.  I finally had went up there and complained and they had stated it wasn't going through.  Once I showed them my account on my phone they gave me back my card.  Meanwhile I had to go all week without my checking account because those charges remained pending in my account.  (making me negative).  Wednesday night I was called by the owner of the establishment apologizing for the mishap and made things right.  He went above and beyond to make sure I felt that I was a respected customer and made it better.  We appreciate him correcting their mistakes and using it as a learning experience for his staff.  with this we are willing to give it another shot!!   Oh - and the food is awesome!! The shrimp tacos are the bomb!! everything is a little overpriced but very tasty."}
{"text":"Went in on Saturday November 27 before a Coyotes game.   Sat at the bar for dinner and a Margarita.  I had the prickly pear Margarita which was the worst Margarita I have ever had and my friend ordered the Cadillac Margarita when we told the bartender that it was supposed to have Grand Marnier in it she snapped ar us and said no it doesn't.  The food was ok, nothing special but overall the place is overpriced.  There are many other places at Westgate I would go before I would go this place."}
{"text":"Service is horrible. Waited over 5 minutes just for our drink order...then had 3 different servers and all of them took forever. Barley got checked on... watch Mexican restaurant doesn't give you free chips and salsa?? Although the guacamole and chips were delicious, they're an extra charge. Food is just ehhh. Got the Carne asada  tacos. They don't even come with Pico de Gallo.... rice was mediocre and beans were delicious. Food is overpriced and service sucks!"}
{"text":"Try the carnitas, nachos, sea bass tacos or carne asada burrito....fantastic food and wonderful service!!! Will go again and again and again!"}
{"text":"Bar area is open to Westgate fountain which creates a nice feel for the area.  We had a chicken quesadilla and enchiladas.  Both were ok, nothing great.    Two meals and one drink each $60...seemed a little high for the food.  Chips and salsa are extra charge, a little unexpected for a Mexican bar.  Great place to watch a game but I would skip the food."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good service was lousy just way overpriced, skip this and go somewhere else the food doesnt justify the prices."}
{"text":"First off, this place is WAY better than the other \"mexican\" place in Westgate. Our server was AWESOME and the food was very good! We loved the atmosphere there as well. Yes, it's a little overpriced but honestly, most of the places at Westgate are. We plan on going back one evening to kick back and enjoy!  **There's two different address listed on Yelp for the same location, so I'm leaving the same review for both!"}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time today. They've been open about four weeks. Overall we liked it.  I had the lobster tacos which were served with a mango  fruit and they were very good. My daughter's steak empanadas were excellent.   Husband had the carne asada tacos. The meat was good but the taco itself was a little dry--needed some green salsa or something. The rice and beans came with some kind of sour cream drizzle on them which was not mentioned on the menu but the staff was nice enough to replace them with plain ones.  The papas were hot, both in temperature and taste.  Husband thought they had too much chili powder.  Reuben, the manager, is a really nice guy and was very receptive to our feedback which included a suggestion to be able to mix and match tacos.  They promote themselves as a taco shop but did not have very many kinds of tacos.  Overall it was a very good lunch and we will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Super excited that a place like this opened up where the shifty magaritaville was. The food and service was great. Sriracha sea bass tacos rice and beans super good. The wife had the enchiladas they were stacked not rolled. I will be back for sure....."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a beer before the Coyotes game on Saturday, Nov. 28th.  $8.25 for a 22oz Miller Lite Draft. YOU HAVE TO BE KIDDING ME! No wonder it was only  1/2 full on an event night. No, I won't be back."}
