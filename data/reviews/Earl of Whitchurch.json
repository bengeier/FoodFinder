{"text":"The Earl has gone through several transitions, and many changes in chefs to boot. It's never been a great place to eat, and you couldn't really say it was good pub food, it's not. The best I could say is the food is passible. However, the music jams are always a good time for everyone."}
{"text":"here is an honest No B.S review. They have an Ok Atmosphere. Friendly staff. too many drunk white trash Hobo customers. Like literally my I.Q dropped a 100 points sitting at the bar just looking at these Neanderthals. So, if you want to have a nonsense argument and perhaps have a fist fight and end up in jail go visit this restaurant. bunch of Mooo Mooo farmers and drunk Idiots."}
{"text":"The menu at this pub blows away any other pub food I've ever had. Everything seems to be made with care and some things are home made. The soft pretzels are seriously mind blowing. The sticky pudding is home made and reminds me of Christmas.  Everything we ate was on point. The people are friendly and the place was cozy."}
{"text":"Disappointing experience:( My husband and I stopped in on a beautiful Saturday afternoon (7/12) for a bite of lunch on the patio.  Our waitress seemed uninterested that we were there - brought us menus but didn't ask if we wanted a drink at the same time.  We ordered bruschetta - which was tasty, but came with no plates!  Bit of a mess.  The fish and chips were okay, the fries were great, the reuben was good, but huge (and no sign of my 'to go' container requested for the 2nd half).  btw - I'm a dog lover, but hate when rules aren't followed.  Is this a dog-friendly patio?  The owner and her friend, and their dog, were having a great time, oblivious to their paying guests while we were there.  The 'domestic' between the couple who own the pub was especially nice to watch - something about unloading kegs. Food was okay, rotten atmosphere - won't be back."}
{"text":"Very over priced mediocre pub fare.....good atmosphere and great service but betterto eat somewhere else first then go for drinks"}
{"text":"Went for lunch here, was expecting a great meal considering the waitress said everything was made fresh every morning and the fish and chips was one of their top sellers. So we went with the fish and chips ($18). The chips were great, the fish was a strange combo of soggy and partly crisp. Did not meet our expectations at all and I normally would not send anything back, but since I couldn't eat it I had it replaced with an equally bad tasting and over buttered Reuben sandwich that came with a honey/something dressing that was so thick it was more a dip than a dressing.   Had a good feel of a pub and it the staff was friendly. Probably won't be going back anytime soon.  Update!!! The food we had here made me sick and it all came back up - Now I know for sure I won't be back here.. EVER!!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere but the food is way overpriced and not good quality. If you are looking for simple pub food this is not the place for you! Every menu item is a \"hipster\" version of classic pub fare and way over priced. You can't even get good nachos or chicken fingers! The Earl is not a small town authentic pub that I was hoping for. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"The wings were nothing special, the carrot on the side was off and I could not follow the conversation with my husband because of the noise. I will not go back."}
{"text":"New owners have taken over and renovated - food is typical pub food however the they cook almost everything from scratch. The food is quite good - perhaps I was expecting more when I heard cooked from scratch. Had some chicken fingers rolled in what appeared to be Doritos and they were way overcooked. Also had a jerk chicken sandwich and it was solid.   The place is spotless, friendly staff, nice patio out back good draft selection."}
{"text":"Best beer selection and prices in stouffville and Markham.  $3 mixed drinks on Saturdays is nuts!  Food here is pretty good, too. The chicken fingers are scratch made and use real chicken breast, easily the best I've ever had anywhere. Great staff and freezing cold bottles of Stella keep me coming back."}
{"text":"My first time here, and it won't be the last.  The menu was great. I was with a fairly large party, half of which ordered the wings, they were huge. I ordered the fish and chips, and I was glad I didn't go for the two piece, because the one I got was big enough.  The only complaint I had, was there was way too much salt on the fries, which was too bad,  because they were good fries, and the gravy I ordered to go with them was good too.  Next time I will ask for no salt, or lightly.  Another of my party had the Salmon, and said it was very good. I really have to get back there to try some more of that menu, maybe even the Mac&Cheese Burger!!!"}
{"text":"I came for a few drinks so I can't comment on the food (which reviews below scared me off of). The bar staff was quick and attentive, and I couldn't have asked for more. Everyone seemed super friendly and if this place wasn't so far from downtown, I would come regularly for a drink because it was a nice relaxing place to enjoy a good pint."}
{"text":"So I had to drop a star. Recent we have gone here a couple of times. I find it hit and miss! Which is too bad because we had high hopes for a better local pub. Our food last night was not up to standard. French fries were bottom of the basket ends and way to crispy. My chicken fingers were good but really how do you screw up those? My husband's fish and chips were not hot, the batter fell off and again his fries were bottom of the basket. I also noticed that sides and dips now come in plastic throw away small containers, they used to come in small ceramic vessels. What's going on over there? Things are sliding fast. And I didn't not mention that my husband was served the wrong beer, the waitress took it back to the bar, waited and brought back the same one. The head had disappeared but it was obviously the same beer. We talked to one the other staff member who was tending bar, he has also been there the longest and is a great server, he was apologetic, took it back and didn't charge us for our drinks which, wasn't necessary but very nice. We ended up leaving shortly after we were finished, usually we linger. It is too bad that it is so hit and miss - hopefully the owners pull it together and get things back on track."}
{"text":"I finally made it to Earl of Whitchurch.  Back in August 2016, I attended an outdoor festival called Harvest Moon Festival at Markham Fairground.  The lobster roll sliders I sampled was so good that I mentally noted that I would pay Earl of Whitchurch a visit.  Fast forwarded half a year, here I am.  The ground floor of The Earl of Whitchurch is small.  The decor is mainly dark coloured wood.  The atmosphere is quaint, causal and intimate.  It was dimly lighted during my visit.  But I visited around 5pm, and there was still daylight outside, so I don't know how brightly/dimly lighted it would be in the evening.  There is a second floor, but I didn't go up, so I can't comment on it.  It was happy hours.  We ordered a pint of Moosehead lager for $5, and a Wing and Fries Basket (half price at $7.50), and of course, a Lobster Roll Sliders ($14 full price for 3 sliders). The Lobster Roll Slider comprised of a slide of warm, soft and toasted garlic bread, with fresh lobster meat in house sauce. It was simple and delicious, or should I say simple done right.  Make me wonder the benefits of \"complicated gourmet\".  For the chicken wings, we ordered medium spicy.  They were exactly medium spicy, not dumbed down. So be forewarned. The sauce tasted good, but it didn't look too pretty visually, so there is room for improvement there.  The fries were all right; nothing to complain or write home about.  If not for the lobster sliders, the food was average 3 stars. Yet the good sliders are unusual for a pub; the waitresses are friendly and fast, and the ambience is good.  I found the visit comfortable and enjoyable. What more can I ask for from a neighbourhood pub where the waitresses likely recognize the regulars?"}
{"text":"This is the local pub for a friend of ours that Lee and I stayed with over the Christmas break. It has a nice, homey, English Pub atmosphere, which is something I really like running across. This is the kind of pub that has a lot of locals, and it's really comfy.  The beer selection is great, highlighting a lot of local breweries. The food is also really delicious. I had the super poutine, which was delicious, and Lee ended up with French onion soup and Fish and Chips, which he enjoyed quite a bit as well.   This is the kind of place I really wish there were more of where we live now."}
{"text":"Why is the menu here so small? Needs way more options.  I ordered the Bigelow burger and it was gross.  SO SO SO salty. Like I couldn't even eat it salty.  Husband ordered the crispy chicken sandwich and liked it.  Prices are way too high for what you get.  We had a groupon so it wasn't that bad, but I would not go back.    Disappointing."}
{"text":"I love that they have $5 beers most nights of the week. Some nights includes craft beer. They have the best beer selection in Stouffville. Friendly atmosphere. Waitresses are nice and quick. Food is very good made fresh. Open Mic on Sundays are great good people and good tunes"}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try due to Groupon. We presented the Groupon upon arrival and was told \"don't worry we will take it off your bill at the end\". Server knew darn well that we were using Groupon but encouraged us to get daily special. Then at the end told us, we couldnt use the Groupon as we got the special. This ruined my dining experience as I felt like they tried to trick us.  Food is mediocre at best. French fries were hard, burgers were not bad and Philly cheese steak was so so.  Would not want to go back, gonna try to get refund for my Groupon"}
{"text":"Sad to say, this place has gone down hill. They've had their ups and downs though, hopefully they will improve again soon."}
{"text":"I took my boyfriend here, just 10 min from my house, because we frequent pubs downtown and in Mississauga. He was surprised how no one was on the street that night, Friday 11pm Mid-June, and the pub is located in downtown Stouffville. But yes, Stouffville is a quiet little place :)   Anyways, we sat at the patio, which is small and their patio lights were SOOO extremely bright. We each had a beer and shared a plate of Nachos. The nachos were good, but my memory of that evening was really just my boyfriend sitting in front of me :) Also there was a spider from a nearby flower pot...  Reviews from other sources recommend the Beef Dip. They also say that people visit here on game nights. I guess that's what the TV on the patio is for. On our night, no major games, the pub inside was pretty empty and the patio was 7/10 tables full.   All in all, a small pub, good for friends/casual outings if you live nearby."}
