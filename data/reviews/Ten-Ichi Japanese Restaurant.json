{"text":"My wife and I have been to Ten-Ichi at least a dozen times in the last year alone. It's always been a zoo, and the service has, on more than one occasion been lacking. We were always served in a reasonably timely manner, but I must agree with other reviews in noting both that alcoholic drinks often take quite a while to be delivered and that pricier items from a given AYCE round of ordering sometimes simply fail to ever arrive.

Their AYCE selection is fairly large, and the quality is about what you'd expect for relatively inexpensive AYCE sushi. We've generally enjoyed overindulging ourselves.

We've only attempted to make reservations a few times in the past, with limited success. Nonetheless, because we tended to come after peak dinner hours, and because it was typically just the two of us, we were usually seated without too much of a problem (wait times of between 20-35 minutes were not uncommon).

However, since Ten-Ichi renovated, it's been a complete mess. The last two times we've tried to go, we've have been completely unable to make a reservation. Despite repeated attempts (I've called 14 times already today), we haven't successfully reached a f**king human being. We went ahead and showed up the time before, but they were so busy, the host simply turned us away while profusely apologizing.

In calling today, the phone has simply rung until a voice mail system announcement tells me that the inbox is full of messages 10 of 14 times. The other 4 times, the line was busy.

Sorry Ten-Ichi, you're simply nowhere good enough to justify being impossible to reach. I don't even think a Hollywood A-lister could find their way past this incompetent reservation system.

I will now simply take my business elsewhere (TnT Sushi is Ajax is a little out of the way and has a slightly smaller AYCE selection, but we can always get in). I'm completely fed up with a restaurant that seems so unconcerned about its patrons.

Frankly, I wish a competing restaurant would open up in the immediate area.

So, dear restaurateurs out there: charge a buck or two more for AYCE...but answer the phone and take a reservation at least 1 out of every 2 times I call...you'll have a patron for life in me, and we'll happily both watch Ten-Ichi struggle and fail...the only fitting end for a restaurant that has consistently shown a resistance to implementing reasonable host/hostessing services."}
{"text":"The steak be to box was not like in the picture it came cut up in pieces. Not sure how that's a grilled sirloin steak. Rice was a little dry. Asked to substitute my 3 grilled shrimp for 2 tempura was offered only two pieces as a trade. Miso soup was excellent not salty but just enough flavour. The tea was free came in a warm jug that was nice. Everything else was just okay. I probably won't be back here. I came here thinking it was all you can eat which is wasn't, so it just added to the disappointment. 

The waitresses have a ribbon on their backs, but they not gifts you can take home."}
{"text":"My friends and I had dinner last night here, its been over 2 years since we been here and this place had gone under major renos. The place looks more opened and less cluttered. 

Our food came out really fast and it was decent quality for AYCE. We felt like we were being rushed while we were eating, that's the one thing I didn't really enjoyed. Didn't really get to try everything on the menu because they were closing the kitchen. Their menu has pretty good in selection and the desserts were better than most AYCE sushi places. 

This place is worth the try and if your going in large group of friends book the teppanyaki table."}
{"text":"I love this place, went twice in a month. It's always full, You should make a reservation before u going. if u had bad luck and u still need to wait for some time even with reservation. It is bit expensive than others average Japanese \"all u can eat\" but tin-ichi worth the price!! Good services, Perfect sushi!!"}
{"text":"In short, Service is very very very slow, food is just average. Restaurant is overrated, I will never go back again. For the price, there are plenty of options to choose from. 
I went there with a friend and when I got there, the restaurant was half empty, but it still took them at least 10min to sit us down. It was nightmares after nightmares after we sat down. With their serving speed, we ordered a lot of items on their menu, but there was never enough food on the table. It also took them forever to clean our table. If I could I would give negative five stars."}
{"text":"My first time here this place was amazing! The service was great, the food was fresh, and the atmosphere was excellent. I didn't mind driving 20-30 minutes away to visit this location, or to tip over the requested amount (10%), because they provide great value for a moderate price.

After coming here a year later the place has changed. Perhaps the popularity has gotten to them and they've chosen profit over customer service, or maybe high turnover and there are a lot of new untrained employees. I'll explain what I mean: 

Firstly the wait times are much longer now than anticipated, typically 15-20 mins over wait time. I'm patient so it doesn't really bother me, but worth mentioning for others (what is the point of reservations?). 

The service has gone down big time. They've messed up many and forgot a lot of what we ordered. We constantly had to check in with our waitress to see if food was arriving. I understand with popularity there are more consumers and it does get busier, but they should have more people on staff to accommodate instead of trying to minimize their expenses. I'm a patient individual though as I've stated so I waited for them to fix our orders and bring our missing ones.

The atmosphere is still nice, they've gotten a lot more busier though so the place is packed and there isn't much room. I've noticed they added extra tables in sections to accommodate more customers, but it makes it a bit more stuffy. 

What was different this time was the waitress went ahead and included a tip for herself. All the past times I've gone to this place that's never happened. I assume its because she knew she wasn't doing the best job that night and thought I would not tip or undertip. 

One thing that was always an issue even before the service went down was selection on their menu. There isn't much to choose from compared to other sushi restaurants.

Now I've come at different times throughout the year as well to make sure it wasn't just an off night for the restaurant, but the same instances have occurred.

Overall, this place has lost it touch with competition intensifying in the sushi business and innovating, Ten Ichi is falling behind on service and selection."}
{"text":"I find this place to be overrated.  It has been around for quite some time and I have gone on multiple occasions.  The food is ok but nothing really great about it to warrant the wait.  

From an AYCE standpoint I guess it's ok, but AYCE is not exactly high end stuff to begin with.  The options that they have are more than a lot of other AYCE places but a llitle gimmicky if you ask me.  Nothing particularly stands out.  I dunno, perhaps I'm a little picky due to the higher end Japanese restaurants that I have gone to but prefer not to compare on what it is alone but rather how it ranks from a Japanese food perspective."}
{"text":"Came and tried what all the hype was about today and it wasn't anything special. Went in around 6:30 and it was crazy busy and I didn't make reservations, but we were seated fairly quickly. Service was good, the sushi was average and loved their dessert varieties. Overall I would come again, but it is not my go to sushi restaurant"}
{"text":"I blame my waste size on this place.  everything here is pretty good.  I can't really find one thing I ordered that I did not enjoy.  our table always had food, it speaks volume that this place has quick and efficient service.  everything we ordered came out fast and more importantly good.

when it came to dessert time, our table was litterely  covered in shot glasses.  one thing I noticed, was a change in the chocolate mousse and jello dessert.  the mousse was not as sweet as it was before (a good change) and the jello was more watered down (bad change).  

this place has always been pretty good and this time is no exception.  

will I come back... definitely."}
{"text":"Foods are fresh, service is acceptable, the one thing you need to know.  If you are in a hurry or hungry, go somewhere else, it took forever for the dishes!"}
{"text":"Amazing AYCE experience! This is the only place so far that has great quality scallop sashimi and sweet shrimp sashimi. The fish was fresh, and they didn't overload the sushi with rice. Also check out the beef skewers- so delicious. Only con is that it was crazy busy on Saturday night--- make a reservation for sure!We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best sushi place I've ever been to. My favourite dishes includes the rose maki, scallop sashimi, and unagi roll. Overall the food was fresh. Our waitress was extremely nice but the service was quite slow. The regular dinner is around $30 including tips and tax. I highly recommend this place but you should make a reservation beforehand."}
{"text":"*I'm writing this review whilst considering the fact that this is a BUFFET*
Should I come to this place you ask? OF COURSE YOU SHOULD, IF NOT, YOU'RE MISSING OUT ON A LOT.
I'll split up everything into little sections to talk about...
Food:
1. Please remember the fact that this is a BUFFET, which of course, means that the quality will not be the best in the world! Having said that, the quality is still in the range of excellent to very excellent. 
2. A variety of food that are all fresh and tasty! Various selections for sashimi, dessert, handrolls, meat, and sooo much more!
3. Great taste and smell, as well as quality (for buffets)
4. Desserts are the best you'll ever taste, but I really recommend you get the Mango Yogurt; it's one of the most popular here. All the customers order 10 at a time! The ice cream is nice too, but not special enough compared to Mango Yogurt and Custard Cream...save space for your stomach!!!
5. The GALBI! Juicy and tender! Rose maki and white dragon are very nice specialities.  

Service:
Very nice! The place had a nice ambience, and the food was prepared quickly. Of course, like many restaurants, it may have its bad days when certain dishes aren't its best, but the majority of the time, you wouldn't be disappointed. For example, the salmon sashimi can taste fresh and delicious on many days, the fried scallops might not be so good on some days, etc. But bad days are rare!

Price:
1. Very reasonable. Around $30 for a person with tip.
2. If you consider the quality of the food (for buffets) and the taste (as well as variety), I would say it's a lot cheaper than other buffets (not cheaper if you only consider price, but cheaper if you keep the food in mind).

For BUFFETS, 5 stars!"}
{"text":"My family and I went on a Sunday evening and was told the wait was 20 mins.  40 minutes later we were still waiting in a lineup that had no system, where people were seated according to how pushy they were and how much they harassed the seating host!! I was appalled that such a big restaurant had such a disorganized seating structure! People who got there after us had been seated before us.  After I finally decided to complain and ask when we were actually being seated, the host takes us to a table that hasn't been cleaned yet.  With the table cleaned and us seated, the waitress taking orders purposely ignored our table to take orders from people who already had food on their table! Finally after waiting another 20 mins at the table without service or even tea (repeatedly asking to be served), we got up and left after the waitress took the order of a table that had arrived after us.  I'm not sure how a restaurant like this can operate and be successful, but it's definitely not getting our service again.  In the end, we went to the KEG and had a nice relaxing dinner for cheaper then what we would have spent here (that we didnt have to fight for).  

I don't care if the food is great or fresh...the service was terrible and not worth any amount of potential good food.

Lesson: Must be aggressive and fight for your spot in order to be seated, and fight again to be served."}
{"text":"Food was great!

Some staff were nice, other seemed to ignore you when you were waving them over to your table. Some of the food also isn't brought to you after you order it, until, about after another order or two, or you remind the waiter/waitress."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! If u like sushi they have an amazing all u can eat selection and if u have that one friend who doesn't like sushi they have a chef who cooks all types of meat in front of u as well which is also all u can eat. It's great environment if ur looking for something different"}
{"text":"It is pretty expensive but the food is good. The sweet shrimps served on weekends are delicious! Also really liked the mango sushi and mango pudding.

Wide selection of food and they are all pretty good. It is usually packed so it might be smart to have reservations beforehand!"}
{"text":"O, Ten-Ichi, how I crave your sushi! How I delight in your Teppenyaki grill! Each time I visit, I am lonely 'til next I can stay, dining amongst the chaos -  in perfect harmony with raw fish and hot dishes. O, Ten-Ichi, you may not be the best at anything, but you have so many things, it matters not. O, Ten-Ichi, this is my Ode To Thee! 
This is a 4-star for me only because - as you'd expect from AYCE - the quality is not top-notch. But that's okay. That's not why you go. There's a reason it's crowded and reservations are an issue. It's because, for about 22$ (for food), you can sit for hours on end, ordering a diverse array of delicious morsels and drinking free tea and cheap cocktails. You can hang out in front of the teppanyaki grills, watching batch after garlicky batch of steak and grilled flounder dispensed in rapid succession. They have the most diverse menu of any AYCE place we've been to in Toronto - and most of it is yummy. The raw fish selection is not huge, but the teppanyaki is included and it's awesome. We love, love, love that everything comes in very small quantities unless you specify otherwise - so much the better sampling and conversing! Personally, we've never had anything but friendly - if busy! - service here. They prioritize efficiency here, and you're likely to end up with anywhere from 1 - 3 servers. Despite the crowds of committed sushi-eaters, the service for us has been remarkably relaxed and even entertaining. And yes, we sometimes go without reservations. However, we go as a couple - maybe smaller groups get seated faster. Expect to order a lot of stuff at once, then see it arrive gradually (but fresh!). Expect things to show up at your table that you didn't order. 'Roll' with it - who cares? Most of the time they just got their orders mixed, and you get a bonus. If you miss a dish, you order it again. This is not a place to be uptight. This is not a place to go when you are on a schedule. This is not a place to go if you expect gourmet sushi. This is not a place to go if you want quiet or privacy. This is a fun, chaotic, delicious smorgasbord. Make a reservation, go with the flow, and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Not their fault I went to a sushi place for ramen because I searched for it on Yelp and they popped up, got it wife wasn't displeased but wasn't anything to talk about either"}
{"text":"Q: \"Which night is the best night to go to Ten-Ichi?\"
A: \"The night that you make a reservation.\"

That was the answer we heard from the host giving to a customer when we were waiting for a table on a Wednesday night. The place was surprisingly busy for a weekday night but we were seated within 15 min which wasn't too bad considering that we didn't make reservations. 

There was a good variety of items for an AYCE sushi place, some standout ones that you don't typically find were:

- Avocado seafood salad, which reminded me of an oyster motoyaki but made with avocado and seafood inside a clam shell
 
- Seafood wrapped tempura with bite-sized crab cakes inside
 
- Dynamite hand rolls, which were explosively delicious!

- Teppanyaki items like sirloin steak and teriyaki chicken

And last but not least, their dessert selections were impressive, which included assorted mouses (ie. custard, tiramisu, strawberry, ginger creme brulee,etc) and of course green tea ice cream!  

Service was friendly, informative and quick. Our server even remembered to check on a forgotten order.

Would definitely go back if we are craving sushi and find ourselves in the area."}
{"text":"Very satisfied with the service and food overall, have come back multiple times. Their sashimi and rolls are all very fresh and nicely presented. Only wish they have a bit more food variety."}
{"text":"Food was amazing, as far as an all you can eat place goes... Nice atmosphere... Dish portions are appetizer size portions, so oder accordingly. It makes it easy to sample n find what you might like. Leave room for desert though, otherwise you'll be rolling yourself out."}
{"text":"Bout time i come here! mostly word of mouth recommendations to come here...

first, the mango yogurt is my main reason for coming here... its soooo tasty

i was excited to taste the creme brulee... but they never even have it..yet its still on the menu

^ thumbs down for that

also thumbs down for not having alot of vegetarian options..

the only sushi i could order was,,,the avocado one...

BUT it was the most delicious Avocado sushi ive ever tasteddd! it tasted soo fresh and so damn tasty ...just only avocado?? wuhhhhhh?

even though their range (or lack of range) of vegetarian sushi...there is....what i did get to have was deliciousssss...

no wonder this place is always packed.

UPDATE April 2012: 

FINALLY, about time they renovated this place, it is ALOTT better and way way nicer looking i really Like how im not literally 3-4 inches from the next table anymore!

too bad they didnt add new stuff to their menu..

basically if you're a vegetarian , all u can really eat there (but SO good) is only a few things like:

-Avocado maki
-spring roll with their wasabi mayo ..mmm
-some weird kinda noodle
-sweet potatoe /veggie tempura
-tofu
-DESSERT !!!

EDIT: they now have COCONUT ice-cream --- SOOOOOOO GOOOOD"}
{"text":"I used to be a fan of Ten-Ichi, I mean its AYCE Sushi so you can go in, stuff your face and roll on home.  I've been there about six times now, y most recent experience really turned me off.  We were seated in a congested little corner as usual, no problem, the waitress took our first set of orders, no problem, of the six items we ordered only one came, problem.  it turns out the giggling pair beside I us was receiving our food and not saying anything, this is made even worse as they sat down AFTER us, were served their food and OURS.  We basically never received anything else for 25 minutes, however, a waitress there attempted to deliver the same fried jumbo shrimp to my wife and I SIX times.  I'm allergic to shrimp and she does not eat friend shrimp, the waitress started getting ruder and ruder every time she brought the shrimp.  After that I had a mediocre meal and long delays between orderings.  I won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Ok I must update my review because we gave them another chance, and things were improved. Service was 10 times better, and the food was up to par again. My only complaint is that they mix up orders and don't bring everything you asked for. Otherwise, I would have given them a 4-star rating. 

I should add that the more you order all at once, the more they seem to get confused. So I would advise people to order in small batches. 

I also highly recommend the salmon sashimi with dill. It's seared, but is still cut up like sashimi. It's delish! You can't get it on weekends, though. So odd!

Lastly, I've only ever sat in the section closest to the entrance. Maybe ask to go closer to the sushi station, and the service might be better."}
{"text":"This place has been overrated. Been here a couple times because some of my friends like to have sushi but doesn't want to go far.  I only go there if my friends want to.

The place is ran by Chinese. They keep us waiting even we made the reservation. We still have to wait 30 minutes at the door.
The food Is not legit Japanese food. They don't even taste like what I had in Japan. Anyway, can't complain much because you get what you paid.
Yes, It is a buffet. However, they seems to FORGET what you ordered from time to time. Usually we only get 80% what we ordered and the portion is very little."}
{"text":"I've probably gone here 4-5 times in like the last 3 months...its good for an AYCE (All you can eat) place.

Sushi is always fresh, and I really like the nice fatty marbled salmon sashimi you get here which gives it a little extra flavor.  One thing you will notice about the menu that it has a lot of lovely food pics, but if you had to list of the food choices would roughly be only about 30-40 dishes.  But those dishes they do make really really well.  Food sizes think like Tapas except Japanese, and don't bother ordering 40 pieces of sashimi cause you'll only get like 10-15 at a time.  I don't blame them in case its going to a table thats nearly done, it won't go to waste or have much left over.

They are also no slouches on the cooked items, you need to order the sirloin steak (you'll probably make 5 more orders after lol).  All their grilled items must be on a charcoal bbq cause you can taste it in the food from chicken wings to the grilled zuchini.   Only two things kinda sucked was the eggplant, mostly cause it wasn't sauced and the miso soup funny enough.   

They also have great desserts and their in teensy tiny shot glasses so don't feel bad about ordering a few.  Most of the desserts are tasty, but I love their ginger milk,  their coconut ice-cream and a great stand in as always green tea ice-cream

Big groups make a reservation, you have been warned.  Also you might want to arrive early cause of the shitty parking lot with only so many spots that also has a Tim Hortons in there.  Google map it ....its like spending time in Pacific Malls parking lot on the weekends, if ya know what I mean...

Other details: weekends $24.99 per person, $2 for pop and your bill comes with tip automatically added"}

{"text":"Recently went to feed at Ten-Ichi with a group of 9. I was expecting, based on the the location, number of reviews and nearly a 4 star rating, that this would be an above average AYCE Japanese restaurant. However, I was a bit disappointed that it was merely a run-of-the-mill AYCE Japanese restaurant. 

There wasn't anything particularly wrong with our experience, it's just that nothing was very impressive either. 

Food portions  - small (understandable for an AYCE)
Selection - ABOVE average
Flavor - average (deserts, although there were lots to choose from, were just not at all tasty)
Service - pretty prompt
Atmosphere - non-existent 

Although I wasn't impressed, I still may go back to try the tepanyaki."}
{"text":"Great all-you-can-eat menu! Food quality is good and service is excellent. Sushi are fresh. Hot dishes are freshly made. They accept visa card which most Asian reataurant won't do."}
{"text":"Despite hearing mixed reviews about  Ten-ichi, we decided to give it a try.  We made a reservation and were very impatient to try their food. We ended up regretting our decision. 
The first thing that shocked me was how dirty the place was. The carpet, chairs and tables looked like they needed to be replaced. Our table was not even cleaned when we arrived, not to mention our chairs that had food scraps on them. The wait staff was distracted and no one really seemed to care about the customers' satisfaction. Although I don't expect much from an AYCE restaurant, I've never seen such a careless service. Not to mention that the service was terribly slow.
The food was nothing special. The entire experience was a huge disappointment and I felt like it was a total waste of time and money going there. I find this restaurant to be overpriced for what it is. If you are looking for a decent place to eat with nice food, nice atmosphere and what the heck, a respectful service, this is not the place to go."}
{"text":"I LOVE the food here, bento boxes, ramen and sushi are well priced and taste really good. The rose maki is what makes me come back!The only reason i took off a star was because we had to remind waiters about 3 times for the bill, to-go box and ginger and wasabi (one gave me a scared look when i asked for a to-go box for some reason). 
I was also quite confused as to why this place doesn't automatically serve you ginger and wasabi like other sushi restaurants? It becomes quite inconvenient to ask the waiters for it cause the place can get REALLY busy and it takes up their time."}
{"text":"I've tried virtually every Japanese all-you-can-eat restaurant I've encountered. I love Japanese food. It's unique, it's pretty and it's delicious. When someone says, \"Hey you can eat all you want of it!\" a bell goes off in my head and I become Pavlov's dog.

My expectations were high before I even set foot in the place. It was already 9 pm and it was still full. The first thing I noticed was the food. It is above average for AYCE. The rolls were satisfying, and everything tasted like it was freshly cooked. I didn't get that heavy, disgusting feeling right away, like I just ate a pound of fried dough covered in salmon. 

Then I realized why: the food took a long time to reach our table. It took so long that we were forgetting what we had ordered. We were even worried about going over the time limit. We made a strong push at the end and just ordered four of everything anyone wanted. Then, I was in a bad place.

I managed to squeeze in some room for dessert, which seems to be the main attraction. They have yogurt and stuff like tiramisu in little shot glasses. While it's not the most efficient way to prepare and/or eat dessert (why not use a bigger glass?), it's fun to eat. Also you find yourself saying things like, \"Yes we would like to order 30 glasses of tiramisu please.\"

I would give Ten-Ichi a 3.5 out of 5. The extra 0.5 star is for the quality of the food. I was really disappointed with how slow the service was, although our waitress was very polite and accommodating (30 glasses of tiramisu!). 

I would definitely try this place again, but I'm sure there's a good chance I'll be waiting for a table in my next visit, and that the service will be just as slow."}
{"text":"The first time I had ever gone to Ten-Ichi, I thought it was amazing but as time went by, my thoughts about this place started to change.

The price is a bit steep and they get busy quickly. Even though you have a reservation, a lot of the time, you still need to wait to get seated. There are even occasions if you have no reservation and just walk in, they will turn you away. However, their host that deals with all seating is very friendly and tries his best to accommodate the customers asap.

If you have a large party and you have a reservation but had to wait any way, the host will make sure that he gets the sushi chefs to whip up a nice sashimi boat up for you so that way you can start feasting!

I found after going there a few times, the food was declining and there were menu items such as the Spider Roll that suddenly started disappearing from their usual AYCE menu. It was a bit frustrating at times, especially when you were looking forward to those items.

When they are really busy, their wait staff really don't pay much attention to you not unless you really start waving your arm in the air.

I do have to say that their beef skewers are the best I have had in an AYCE place. It's very tender and has a ton of flavour. All of their other food items are now (in my opinion) are ok. Would I still recommend this place? I would depending on what my friends wanted. Would I go back? Occasionally but it's not my preferred spot any more."}
{"text":"Went on Sunday around 5pm. Best time to go to get a seat. By 6pm the place was PACKED. 
FRESH ingredients, everything we tried tasted great and not too filling too fast
We tried the new Spicy Crispy Rolls-- VERY GOOD
All in all decent service, but sometimes brought things we didn't order or forgot parts of our order
Felt a bit rushed in the end our server brought our bill and we weren't finished yet 
Dessert portions small"}
{"text":"TLDR: If I could give them less than 1 star, I would. Food sucks, price sucks, everything sucks. Despite the majority of \"fantastic\" reviews, this experience has been a polar opposite.  

Came here once about 3 years ago, came here again just this Friday evening and it was a total disappointment despite all the so-called \"positive\" reviews here. A member of our party suggested Ten-Ichi for the \"unique\" AYCE teppanyaki and sushi. We were booked for the 8:00PM session, about an hour and a half later and $40 poorer, I felt crankier than before I arrived famished at the restaurant.  
   
|| Food: Poor 
Teppanyaki  --  Apparently the highlight of the restaurant for an additional $3 you get unlimited servings of food supposedly freshly and artistically prepared in front of you on an iron griddle. If only that were true. In part it may be due to the lack of experience with our chef, but EVERYTHING he served us was under seasoned and under cooked. That included the shrimp, cod, salmon, steak, mushrooms, short ribs, and teriyaki chicken. My party can clearly taste that \"frozen meat\" taste. I understand that because I'm paying for an AYCE experience, meat won't be of the finest quality, but come on, seasoning would have done wonders! I really don't think it costs that much that you have to skimp on the salt, pepper and soy sauce. We asked for medium well done, we got rare steak. Talk about following instructions. 

I avoid adding condiments or additional seasoning to my food but, for the first time in my restaurant life, I had to douse my teppanyaki fried rice in soy sauce. I had to fight the urge to ask the chef to hand me the spatula so that I could cook my own food than eat whatever I had to stomach. Mind you, I'm not a teppanyaki first-timer and never have I ever seen a more rushed \"performance\" or \"service\". 

Sushi, Rolls and Other Regular AYCE items -- Just when we thought the tepannyaki side of things was terrible, the sushi was also a disappointment. Key points:
-- very \"fishy\" sashimi, tasted like it hasn't completed its thawing stages
(as told on the account on those in my party who consumes sashimi, unlike me)
-- very bready tempura and watery tempura sauce
-- a hell lot of rice in proportion to the other ingredients
-- used regular rice and no rice vinegar in all sushi items (hence, the bland taste)
-- sushi and rolls were falling apart when I picked them up
-- very TINY menu selection (only 35 items??)
-- watery, melting desserts

|| Atmosphere: Mediocre
I don't even want to comment any further, because the food has just completely sank my entire experience at this restaurant. All I can say is that it was the typical dim, warm and poorly ventilated (from all the airborne teppanyaki grease), so be sure not to wear your beloved pieces of clothing unless you want to bring home the smell of this catastrophe as a souvenir.   

|| Service: Poor
Our session was scheduled to start at 8:00PM but we ended getting seated at 8:20PM, it wasn't until 8:45PM (where I almost forgot I paid the extra $3 for teppanyaki) that the chef finally showed up and began cooking for our party. No apologies, nothing. Again, the chef rushed to get everything done so he could leave asap that he didn't even serve us the mixed vegetables and fried rice until we requested it. In typical teppanyaki performances, and in my earlier visit to Ten-Ichi, there were a few instances were they got a \"fire\" going (ie. onion volcano, fire to sear the fish...etc.). Other than the one measly fire for no purpose in the centre and beginning, there was nothing significant to watch or enjoy. For $32, at least amuse me and give me a couple of fire photo opps. Not to mention give enough time for the food to cook. So many red flags. 

Closing time is 11:00PM. But right when our chef finished cooking our food, he went straight to bringing a large metal bowl filled with a block of ice and a pair of rubber gloves. It was 10:00 PM and last call. It was soon evident what his intent was after seeing the table behind us just experience the exact same thing. He began cleaning the griddle directly in front of us when we were clearly all STILL eating. Talk about presentation and hygiene. Not even 5 minutes later, vacuums were in the works on the other side of the room. Many of the tepannyaki chefs had already left, we could clearly see through the employee slide door that the sushi chefs were also changing out of their uniforms and clocking out. Keep in mind it's still about 10:20 PM with at least 10 tables spread around the restaurant. Seems like all the employees want to leave work early on a Friday night as we were rushed to pay the bill and out of the restaurant. Way to finish off my Friday night.  

|| -- Final Thoughts --
Oh, I was full alright, full on disappointment. Call me salty or whatever you like, but at least I have more flavour and quality than the food Ten-Ichi serves. Definitely never returning to this mess.

{"text":"I've been here a few times with family and my friends. They are always pretty busy especially during the weekend so make reservations if you need to. This place is definitely one of the best AYCE I've been to in a while. I love how you can pay a little more and do AYCE sushi and teppanyaki as well. 

Their Sashimi/Sushi menu is not extensive however their sashimi is pretty fresh and their hand rolls are decent (a bit too much rice for my liking). The teppanyaki menu is great! You order how many orders you want per person and they have a chef that comes out and cooks it right in front of you. Their sirloin steak never disappoint me. As for dessert, just like any AYCE you have your usual ice cream flavors, yogurts and puddings. Nothing out of the ordinary. 

Their service there is amazing. I've always done the AYCE sushi and teppanyaki. It seems like they have one server there designated to get your specific table whatever you need/want. We've never had to wait long for any of our food and the last time we went, our server overheard that it was one of my friend's birthdays. Without us having to even say anything, they came out after our meal with something simple with a candle and sang him \"Happy Birthday\". It was very sweet of them."}
{"text":"If you want to enjoy good sushi this is not the place to go.  Our experience involved waiting 2 hours for food ordered off the all you can eat menu, only to be told after complaining several times that the kitchen was closed and they could no longer serve us.

The food we did get was alright, but with so many alternatives in the city for sushi, I can't say that we will ever return."}
{"text":"Food is always good and fresh tasting.  Service is normally fast. Always busy. I you go, make reservations first."}
{"text":"I thing they change The owner, very bad service. When we ordered sashimi its come with couple pieces of lemon and when we order the raw beef we ask if they can give us lemon they said they don't have lemon, fish were not fresh, and we have to repeat our order at least 3 time to bring its out, finally we ordered the dessert the green tea ice cream was melt and we ask them we want another the one but the waitress said that the fridge was broken but we know she was lie and we saw the waiter bring out the nice and freezing ice cream to the table next to us.  Never never come here again!!!!!!!! We tell all the our friends about our experience."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb to hang out with friends! I can't say I've come to a better AYCE sushi place in the Scarborough area.

You must make reservations if you are a party of more than 2 people; it gets really busy around each of the meal times and you sure as hell don't want to be caught at the tiny entrance for more than a few minutes. Order immediately when you sit down because it takes awhile due to the sheet amount of people eating at once. 

The presentation of the food is superb and well-thought. I've never gotten an ill-prepared dish or sloppy set of rolls, always neat and orderly. This place is all-you-can-eat so make sure you take advantage of that. I always remind my friends that it takes an average weight person to start feeling full around 12 minutes and an overweight/obese person 20 minutes - so eat as much as you can as fast as you can! Don't bother ordering the individual soft drinks, get a pitcher for $4 or just order some free ice water - definintely helps when you're feeling thirsty and the free green tea isn't cutting it.

I never feel pressure to hurry up and leave - the atmosphere is perfect. Something about watching the sushi chefs fold and cut raw fish that I find mesmerizing. The menu selection for lunch is quite large along with their deserts which are all AYCE. 

Overall you're not going to find anywhere better in the relative vicinity for the price-point at which they are offering."}
{"text":"My Boyfriend and I came here for the first time today
The All You Can Eat Sushi and Sashimi was amazing! We received great customer service and really enjoyed the atmosphere. 
We plan on going here again in the near future :)"}
{"text":"It was my first time and really really enjoyed it! Service was great! The waiter we had was friendly and was so nice. Sushi was great quality. I will definitely go back. Will stop in the next time I'm in Toronto! Make reservations and save room for desserts!"}
{"text":"Big Fan of Ten-Ichi. Best All You Can Eat Sushi place I have been too. Only down side is that it is very busy for dinner but that is because it is so good!! 
Make a reservation for dinner. (can call same day) The lobby area is very small and will be packed but be patient if you made a reservation you will get a table. Even if you didn't and you are patient they will find you a table as well. 
The Quality of the food is great and the prices are reasonable. We drive past many sushi restaurants in Markham to go here because it is worth it. 
Love the shrimp tempura, spicy salmon maki, sushi & hand rolls, salmon sashimi, steak, short ribs, edamame beans, grilled shrimp, mango dessert & green tea ice cream!!"}
{"text":"Been coming to this pace ever since they open and it never disappoints my family.  The best place to have AYCE sushi.  You add a little more to have the teppanyaki table but it's worth it... food is cooked in front of you by a very professional chef... Make a reservation if you want the teppanyaki table.  :)"}
{"text":"The food is average to good and you can get really full because it's buffet style. The only issue this place has is they are understaffed and when it gets busy, it gets VERY slow. PAINFULLY slow. It really ruins your appetite and momentum of eating. I think it's good to come on off meal times so you can get proper service. Think of this as those new places where you can order for yourself on the iPad placed on your table....WITHOUT the iPad."}
{"text":"Really good place for sushi AYCE. 
Fresh sashimi. Large variety of sushi & other dishes. Food is prepared with care. 
Love their avocado seafood salad & desserts that come in shot glasses. 
Service was prompt & server was friendly. 
Welcoming atmosphere. 
I would avoid Friday nights & weekend nights it just gets way too busy. 
Would definitely come back again & again for AYCE."}
{"text":"AWESOME! My friend took me here for my birthday and I was in love with the ambiance and the food. Although its AYCE, it's very classy and the Japanese atmosphere is transports gives you a nice escape from your busy day. Our servers were OK, but there was a bit of a language barrier, which didn't bother me because they were very polite. 

The menu is a bit overwhelming so I will have to go back to try everything else. The mango sushi was amazing as was the beef kabob (can't remember the correct name) but it has a sweet flavor. 

If you go here with a large group of people you may have to wait a while for your food. Since it was just my friend an I, the food was pretty quick.

If you like coconut, you will be in heaven if you try the coconut ice cream. 

Will be taking my husband here for sure."}
{"text":"I came here with a fairly large group. We made reservations, but upon arriving we found out that there was no table for us. 

So we waited, a bit irritated. Eventually, they cleared enough tables to seat all of us. They had some sashimi and sushi already prepared that they said we wouldn't have to pay for if we couldn't finish it. Nice gesture.

They had quite a bit of stuff available. I'm not a fan of sushi, so I was happy to see two full pages on their menu with non-sushi items. They offered the typical tempura and gyoza stuff, but they also had Korean Kalbi beef and some kind of steak. We ordered a lot, and in the end I think they doubled our orders since we took up two table lengths and they thought we all wanted the same food on each side.

They also said they took 10% off the overall price, since we had to wait a while for seating. But even after that it came out to be about $30 a person. Not sure if they ended up charging us for food that was still on the table, including some of that sushi from the start of the meal.

It was expensive, but i was also the best AYCE place I've been to. Scarbs is far for me, but I'd recommend it to my friends if we were ever in the area."}
{"text":"I might have given this a better score... if their customer service was better.  We made reservations to dine in and made the long trek through traffic to get there in this extremely cold weather, which made us a little late.

What reception did we receive?  \"Sorry, you were late for your reservation, so we gave your table away. If you would like, you can wait another hour like the rest of the non-reservation people, and we might be able to put you into the spare room (non-main dining room).\" 

Excuse me?  Seriously, usually if you are a little late, a restaurant, if they gave your table away, would offer to sit you at the next available table, not put you on a waiting list for you to sit through hell in this freezing cold weather.  Also, what is the point of taking down your phone number if they never intended to call you in the first place?  Spam marketing calls?

Needless to say, we left this not so fine establishment, and headed towards Inakaya, calling for reservations again.  Now that is a fine establishment there.  Inakaya had great customer service, and the authentic Japanese food they had there was excellent.  Their variety of sushi and other authentic dishes were just spectacular.

Will I ever go back to Ten-Ichi?  Maybe, if I was going with a group of people who really wanted to try the place out.  Bad customer service always leaves a bad taste in your mouth."}
{"text":"Great food but 1 hr into meal too many instances of \"we ran out\". Managed to accommodate group of eight with two toddlers. Rushed us out to make space for 8pm reservation though.... Would return without hesitation."}
{"text":"The single most excellent Japanese buffet I've ever been to anywhere in North America.  Great sashimi and sushi, grilled items and desserts.  Expensive, but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Went here on a Wednesday. Dinner time and it was pretty empty but mind you it was only 6:45 pm.  Place was dark and decor was not overly impressive.  Waited 10 minutes to be seated but was looking forward to the food which was given two thumbs up by a friend.  Menu was plentiful and was professionally done.  Got use to the iPad thing but no problem.  Fast forward to the food quality... Awful!  Rolls and sushi were breaking apart and so much rice.  Rush job on the sushi for sure.  Lacking in flavors. Calamari was chewy and grilled fish very greasy.  I could go on but 2 stars is generous.  Will not be back for sure. Parking sucks as well...packed! Ichiban All You Eat is still my go to place. Avoid!"}
{"text":"If only I can give NO star for their take out service I would. The host was always away from his post, roaming around. He was very unhelpful in asking for the take out menu, I spent morethan 1 hour just for my take out. Very crappy!"}
{"text":"The best AYCE Japanese restaurant in GTA for sure! We were there on a Sunday night, ordered about 60 pieces of sweet shrimp and they all came to table as we ordered, unlike other AYCE places, they'll be scared and start giving you less after you order 2 to 3 times. Other sashimis, grilled meat and kalbi are fresh, service is fast and friendly, this is prob the only place I'll go if I'm craving for AYCE Japanese food  from now on!"}
{"text":"Great selection and service for all you can eat (AYCE)! They have amebi (sweet shrimp) sashimi which is my favourite and rarely seen at AYCE. 

We came really late so we were starving, we immediately ordered a sashimi plate without thoroughly looking at the menu and it actually came within 5 minutes. Do give it a try. They were also very accommodating to birthday celebrations ie. cake service."}
{"text":"We were seated quickly, and the waiter ran through our options.  As it was not too busy on this weeknight, we were able to sample all the grilled offerings.  We ordered some sashimi and sushi, as well as tempura.  The orders were taken quickly, but were slow to arrive.  The chef cooked who cooked for us was polite, but not entertaining.  Where was the show?  The food was fine, though neither the chicken nor steak was of the best quality.  We left full, and satisfied."}
{"text":"Not the best. But they do have a variety of things on the menu that u wont normally find in AYCE. Sushi and rolls arent great either. 
5 stars for the staff and the service though.  Super nice"}
{"text":"My favourite AYCE in Scarborough.  Better than sushi mountain in Ajax.  Always generous serving.  Flavourful selection of sushi, sashimi, and grilled food.  Friendly staff.  

This place can get very busy so if you don't like waiting in line call ahead.

Highly recommend the white dragon, rainbow roll, sirloin steak, spicy salmon handroll.

Skip the ramen and noodle selection.

Their atmosphere is nice and modern ever since they've renovated.  Family friendly.

Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Portion size was a big problem for plated food. They don't care how many orders you ask for as the chefs only know 1 size.  For example, my wife and I ordered 2 orders of the beef tataki which came out to 5 pieces...So we ordered 5 more orders and still only 5 pieces! They did that to all the plated food which made it annoying because we ended up ordering 3-4 times on a few items and every time having to wait 10-15 minutes for the dish. 

When we got the bill to pay with the visa machine we noticed they didn't have a tip option.  So we were going to pay cash for the tip but then noticed after that the tip of 12% was already added (on a weekday for 2 people)!  The bill says \"suggested tip 12%\" but the waitress already went through the tip option before giving us the machine.  I bet lots of people don't even notice.  Very dishonest. 

Overall this place over charges and under delivers.  Would not recommend.  They missed a few of our items we ordered ( which they also did the same to the 2 tables beside us  as we heard them complain).  Food was also very slow to come out which made me lose my appetite.We weren't even full and left the place because we were too tired of trying to wave the server down to order 1 portion at a time."}
{"text":"NO! I've been here about 4 times, good experiences. But a good friend found a cockroach in her bento box yesterday! How disheartening. NOT going back ever again."}
{"text":"I would recommend going for All You Can Eat, there's really no other way to do sushi IMO. The menu has a good variety, but the grill stuff is to die for. If you are willing to spend an extra couple of dollars, you can sit at the teppanyaki table and get the experience - the cooks will cook especially for you, giving you a light show (lighting food on fire). Safe, and thrilling. You should try it once, it makes you feel like a VIP. Space is limited, though.

 They are always busy during dinner time, reservations are recommended. 

Recommended: steak/steak cubes, grilled flounder, Dragon Rolls"}
{"text":"Ten-Ichi is one of the best all you can eat japanese restaurant I've been to in Toronto. 

Food is consistantly good, servers were friendly and attentive, and most importantly the food selection is very good (they offer all the basics covered and more such as house specialties) 

It's popular dining spot during the middle of the week which says a lot, so definitely call the 'hotline' to make a reservation to avoid disappointment.

Only thing I would say the restaurant needs renovation;  things are a little worn down. Tables, chairs, walls, decors. Still a fan though."}
{"text":"Food was okay, but despite the website and signs on the building, menu was a la carte, not all you can eat. The server informed us this of this as we sat down. I generally look for AYCE when it comes to sushi, so this was a disappointment. The food was good despite this problem."}
{"text":"Went here for my cousins birthday and I'm definitely impressed. Its located in a nice area along Shepperd and parking isn't too hard too find. We reserved ahead but as expected had to wait 10-20 min to get seated, we went on a Monday night and surprisingly it wasn't as packed.  

The waiters were extremely helpful with the menu and our orders came in timed sequences so it was well executed. The entire restaurant and washrooms were very clean overall so that was impressive. 

Overall their menu is very diverse from their multiple rolls to Beef and Chicken Yakitori, to the grilled flounder everything was delicious. Not to mention their Kalbi and Sashimi which were very good. Overall i was extremely impressed."}
{"text":"This place is a good idea for Japanese all you can eat. Their sashimi and sushi are fresh and good quality, their rolls are good but my family and I think that it is not the best, we've taste way better rolls. Their dessert are one of the reason I love here, they're super amazing but really small so order a few of each Cuz u can definitely finish all. Lastly, the main reason this place is awesome Cuz of the tepanyaki, they're sooooo good! So I really recommend you to pay for the tepanyaki price instead of the regular dinner menu !"}
{"text":"Great tasting, consistent quality, casual Japanese sushi dining.

- weekends 27/pp 
- wide range of sashimi and sushi
- professional waitstaff
- perfect lighting
- free spacious parking
- closeby to HWY"}
{"text":"Service is amazing! We received our food in less 5 mins from ordering, and the waitress is super attentive. She came to ask for more order without us asking. The menu is also extensive, and you can also get stuff from the teppanyaki (the sirloin steak is amazing!) One of the best AYCE sushi place in Toronto."}
{"text":"One of the better Sushi all you can eat places.  But it is more expensive than others and they do not give you all you can drink.  Their Sushi are about the same as other All-You-Can eat places.  But their kitchen items are a little better.  I love their sirloin steak and other items from their BBQ section.  This place is always crowded, make sure you reserve ahead of time.  We did a reservation last time and still had to wait 40 minutes, so minus one star for that.  Our previous reservations were good, didn't need to wait.  I guess it was because we had only two people."}
{"text":"This is the most terrible all you can eat I have ever take before, nooooo good, but $$$, have to wait for a long time to get your dishes, and the menu have no ingredients of each sushi rolls, so as a vegetarian, I have no idea what they wrap in the roll, just can see the pics of them, but sometimes it's really hard to know what's in them.
 
Meanwhile I have no idea why they just use the ordinary soy sauce for the sushi? I'm sure it's not the original or the one exclusively served for subsides, and whats more? They didn't provide sweet gingers at all unless you ask them to do so, feels very stingy! Nooo good but just pricy, really terrible sushi experience!

What's more? They will charge you 12%tips compellingly, I felt have been plundered!"}
{"text":"Food: Food had always been consistently good at this place and in the past year (I believe). They have finally added more variety to their menu. Recommended items include: 

1.  Avocado seafood salad - warm and creamy avocado puree
2. Grilled okra - I've never liked okra but the way they made it was so pleasant 
3. Grilled Salmon belly sushi - I like how the piece of rice isn't too big, compared to many places where they offer you a huge piece of rice to stuff you up. 
4. Mango yogurt dessert - It's always been good!!

Service: Friendly staff makes the AYCE experience more personal.  Although they are super busy, they will try their very best to give you attention and won't pretend to be busy doing something else. Service may sometimes be a bit slow especially on weekends after the first round of ordering but I guess it may be because they don't really have that many servers. 

Price: Pretty reasonable. They do have more choices now compared to older AYCE places

Decor: Despite they have renovated, space is still a bit tight and it's a little dark in the restaurant. 

Cleanliness: Washrooms are generally clean except that the last time we went, they either ran out of soap or something and they just placed soap in an old cream dispenser bottle which I find kinda weird. 

Overall. The experience was always pleasant."}
{"text":"It pains me to say that this place has gone a bit downhill. We used to enjoying coming here from time to time but in the last two visits, the quality had us wanting more. We came for lunch this time. The rolls and sushi had way too much rice. I expect this from really low quality AYCE places but this is supposed to be one of the better ones out there. The hot foods were a bit hit and miss but mostly okay and the servers were friendly and proactive. This prevented me from giving it a lower score."}
{"text":"We had ayce and overall the food was great however, certain items were overly salty. Sirlon beef chicken wings and mackerel were overly salty. After the meal I was dying of thirst. I some one was too heavy handed with the salt.

The staff were friendly but the were a few mistakes. Items we requested like napkins and water had to asked twice before they came. One order from another table came to our table. It's understable seeing how it was packed and and so much going on. 


One tip: if you can, do not sit next to the table beside the entrance. There was a large vent overhead that was blowing cold air which was uncomfortable. And this is in December not in the summer...

One thing I didn't really like is how they had the tips precalculated in the bill. I wish to 
Pay according to my own choice. 

I really wanted to like the meal but the list of errors added up to a mediocre experience."}
{"text":"Honestly the best AYCE place, the food was amazing and the service was jaw dropping. This is a restaurant that takes pride in their service, food, and presentation."}
{"text":"The food was good, but if it didn't take an hour for each dish to come out, they would have gotten a better score. Also they don't pay attention to what we order. I ask for white tuna, and they ask how many pieces I want. I tell them that I want 4 pieces of white tuna, and they come back with 3 pieces. We asked for chicken teriyaki at the beginning of our meal which was 6:40, and it arrived at 10:00.  Also waiters don't care about you, they literally went off while we were ordering and never showed up to continue taking our order. We ask for a cola and it arrives like an hour later. We ask for assorted sushi and they just bring out a whole plateful of the same kind of sushi. We ask for chicken yakitori. It didn't show up until later in the meal, and even though we didn't ask for anymore, they kept bringing us plates of it when we never ordered it, like they made a mistake and brought another tables dish to us. Overall it took us like 4 hours to eat because it took an hour for each to dish to come out"}
{"text":"I love to go here but I have to say since they moved next door their service got slower. They had nice decoration inside but its so hard to get a table although we went there with a reservation. We had to wait 30 mins before we could get a table with the reservation. The food is always delicious but I noticed they always make mistake with your order. I had to return two dishes i didn't order but they gave it to us. So over all good food but you have to have a lot of patience and time to deal with their slow service. And also the price is so high compare to other sushi buffets in Toronto."}
{"text":"Best sushi restaurant in town in my opinion.  Decent service, though it can be very busy at night so you should almost definitely make a reservation beforehand for dinner.  Be sure to try to check out their unique baked seafood avocado dish (dinner only, I believe).  AYCE dinner is almost always worth it, and their lunchtime bento boxes are pretty good too."}
{"text":"I came to visit my relatives in Toronto and they recommended this restaurant for dinner. The wait was around 15 minutes for a group of five people. They have a nice seating area in the front while we waited. At a glance, this restaurant gave off a nice and cozy atmosphere with modern decors. Compared to many all-you-can-eat Japanese restaurants in New York City, this place is more clean, same with their utensils.

The service was great. Our server was very attentive and also came back several times to check up on us. However, he can only speak and understand English. When my relatives tried to order in Chinese, he was like \"Huh?...\" It was a bit problematic for us due to language complications. In addition, when we ordered the \"Ginger Crème Brûlée,\" our server failed to tell us that they sold out after we waited for a very long time. 

They offer a small selection of sushi rolls. The serving size was quite small as well. However, the food was better than I thought. The salmon and tuna were very fresh and appetizing. The Unadon (unagi + rice) is also very savory, yet a bit too salty for my taste. The hand rolls were a bit dry... it stuck to my lips when I took my first bite. 

For dessert, we ordered the \"Mango Yogurt\", \"Ginger Milk\", and \"Chocolate Moose.\" They were in a small shot glass. It was not too sweet and just the right amount. Overall, I left the restaurant with a full stomach. Despite the small proportions, it was very considerate of this restaurant because they do not want to fill us up too quick. I would definitely come back if I am in town again!"}
{"text":"This place was fantastic (keep in mind, we're suckers for AYCE.  That's All You Can Eat for the newbies).

Made a last minute reservation for a Saturday night and were seating quite quickly.  Carefully budgeted our stomachs but loved the sushi (especially the special rolls), sashimi (small pieces - order several at at time), agedashi tofu, shrimp and sweet potato tempura, sliced sirloin rolls with green onions and garlic, mango yogurt and ice cream.  

Wish they had one of these by my home!"}
{"text":"Not that good as I expect, because of the busy, the quality of the food goes down badly!!!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years, and it never disappoints. The food is extremely fresh and really tasty.
  I usually arrive early to avoid the heavy dinner rush. The staff are also super attentive as the restaurant isn't as packed, and give their recommendations of dishes and portions. They all seem extremely friendly and patient.
  The sushi is really flavourful, and fresh, and their other dishes are also pretty good. I would recommend the sushi pizza (much better than it sounds :P), chicken skewer and any maki. 
  Overall one of my favourite AYCE restaurants, just make sure to make reservations as they get extremely busy very quickly!"}
{"text":"I've been to ten-ichis many times in the past, but decided to write a review for my recent trip. I made a reservation for 7:30pm for my group of 4. We arrived just before our reservation time, and there was a lineup out the door. My group and I were not to concerned about the wait because we made a reservation. When we walked to the front of the line to speak with the host on duty, he said there would be a 10 minute wait to be seated. That was fine with us given the packed place. That 10 minute's turned into another 15 minute wait, and finally another 15 minute wait after that! It was just before 8:10pm when the host finally said we would be next, and said he put in an order for a sushi boat to be ready for when we got seated so we could start eating. 

In total we waited over 40 minutes past our reservation time to finally be seated. The sushi boat came as promised shortly after. 
During ordering, we where told many items were sold out, including food and drinks. 
As the night came to an end, we got our bills and to our surprise an automatic tip of 12% was applied for our group of 4. 

Although I didn't ask for a discount in lieu of our wait time, or for the tip to be removed, that night at Ten-Ichi will be my last. There is a bunch of other AYCE spots a short trip downtown with better service and selection. 

To sum up my review, Ten-ichi gets a 1 star rating for a few reasons. First, regardless of how busy the place was before we arrived, our reservation should have been honoured at the time we made it. If the restaurant is going to overbook then what's the point in making a reservation? Second, the reservation system of pen and paper is so 2000's. You got iPads for ordering, now invest in a proper reservation system. Third, an automatic tip should NEVER be applied to a group of 4 and it should NEVER be applied when we have to wait 40 minutes to be seated."}
{"text":"Drove all the way to this restaurant for All-You-Can-Eat Lunch and as soon as we get there, the waiter tells us they're not doing AYCE for lunchtime anymore. It's not that we were too late, they just don't offer it. I don't know if it's just the weekdays they don't offer it for, or if it's that they no longer offer it at all, but nonetheless, they didn't let us order AYCE when we went.

My husband and I didn't even bother staying. What pissed me off wasn't that they no longer offered AYCE, but the fact that they didn't even mention this change on their website. Home page: \"We welcome you to enjoy an exciting All-U-Can-Eat Japanese feast here at Ten-Ichi.\" And they still have the lunch menu up! I mean come on."}
{"text":"This review is not written out of anger but more out of sadness that places like this exist. This is an honest account of what we experienced and descriptions of the food is not over exaggerated. If anything, I'm being polite.

Ever since the renovation, this place has gone down in both service and quality of food. The last time we ate here was for lunch on a weekday 3 years ago. We vowed never to return when they served us ice cream that had melted in the bowl and was re-frozen. It had icicles on it. That was a new low. 

We returned yesterday only because we were invited to a party. For a party of 35 during lunch, they gave us 2 waiters who rarely made an appearance. My partner and I were the first to arrive and the last to leave with our food coming in at 30 minute intervals. 2 people at our table complained saying this is the first time in their life that they left an all you can eat meal, hungry. 
First of all the menu was very limited. 
The only dishes I enjoyed was the sanma fish and the chicken teriyaki(a dish I don't usually order at ayce restaurants because sushi is usually what I fill up on). Everything else was truthfully terrible. The miso soup was incredibly salty. The raw fish was fishy and were visibly the worst cuts I have ever seen. They make grocery store sushi look amazing! The tonkatsu tasted off and had freezer burn flavour. It almost tasted like meat that had gone bad. Their mayo tasted off too. The flounder was bland and oily. The chicken skewers tasted of msg. The maki rolls were poorly put together and there were hard pieces of rice. The rolls fell apart so easily. On the last call, we made sure to order plenty since we were still hungry. We got our dessert first but they didn't come together so the fried bananas came at a separate time from the ice cream even though we requested for it to be served together. We continuously asked for our last order. We waited and waited and guests started to leave. They brought the bill over and I said we would like to pay the bill once we received our food. Finally the waitress came and said that the kitchen was closed. We explained that we put our last order in on time and reminded the waitress that she took our order. She apologized and came back with half the order saying that they had run out of beef. They had also run out of avocado so they couldn't make anymore green dragon rolls. 

We paid and didn't make a big scene as not to embarrass our host but this restaurant should be embarrassed for themselves. This party was confirmed with the restaurant ahead of time and so the restaurant should have ensured adequate staff and planned better to prevent food shortages.This will be the last time I will ever eat here. It's sad because a long time ago, it was a good restaurant. I can't understand how management would allow it to become this bad. For the same price of $16.99 you can eat at Matsuda on Don Mills and get way better food and exceptional service. 
No, I do not work there but I eat there often because their consistently good food and service brings me back every time. I will refer them any chance I get because they're just that good."}
{"text":"I had the most horrible dining experience in Ten-ichi. This is the worst all-you-can -eat sushi restaurant that i've been to. Why? First, the serving portions are too small. Our initial order included sweet potato tempura. We only ordered 4 pieces because we thought it would be the size of  a full circle.  Surprisingly, yes we got 4 pieces but each piece is  the size of a quarter of a circle! Secondly, my daughter ordered 3 pieces of california hand-roll but all of them had no crab meat. Thidly,  we also ordered 4 pieces of skewered beef but it never came. We even made a second order of 10 pieces & reminded the server of our first order that we didnt get yet. We waited but neither orders came. So  we decided to just get the bill & leave. Fouth,  there's limited selection in their menu,  service was too slow & the quality of  food wasn't really that good. This was the first time that i ate in an all-you-can-eat restaurant but i didnt get full & not satisfied with what i ate. Overall, i'm not going back to this restaurant ever again & will not recommend it to my friends. To all the other people who always go to this sushi restaurant, you should try TATAME or ITAMAE and see the difference."}
{"text":"Went again recently for Teppanyaki. We had reservations but there was a crowd at the front and no host came by for a solid 20 minutes. However, when someone did finally come we were seated right away and the rest of the Teppanyaki table was still getting seated as well, so we were glad to not have missed anything. 

The food was good - It was my first time experiencing Teppanyaki and having the food cooked right in front of me - chef is definitely very talented. I don't eat beef so I did have to skip some dishes but the ones we did eat were all really good. The dessert didn't taste as good as the last time I went but overall it was still a really exciting experience."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times for AYCE and I love the food! (although service often leaves much to be desired)

Ambiance: Not too bad, pretty standard. However, when it's crowded (i.e. often, especially at night), some of the tables are inconveniently placed and uncomfortably close.

Service: They always have the same guy at the reservations table and he's hilarious (without intending to be- he's very high-strung, poor guy). However, it seems that reservations often get their table much slower than should be expected- possibly due to the fact that the waiting area is literally a can of sardines. The one complaint that I have about their service is that after two rounds of ordering, they don't seem to want to take your order anymore and it seems that higher-quality items get mysteriously \"dropped\" from the order and never arrive. Drinks can take a while to arrive.

Best menu items:
-Grilled eggplant: Light, sauce is great, very well done
-Grilled mushroom
-Avocado seafood salad: Served in a scallop shell, it's basically baked guacamole with bits of seafood. It's really good, although small, so order a few!
-Chopped Ika: chopped and wixed with mayonnaise and tobiko, tastes great.
-Chawanmushi: Very soft and served in a small japanese teacup-looking thing? Well above average.
-Sirloin steak teppanyaki: Prepared with garlic and OH SO GOOD.
-Sushi in general is fresh and well-sized (unlike other japanese buffets that try and stuff you with rice because they're cheap)... main reason for coming back

Least favorite menu items:
-Udon: Average, don't eat it here- there are much more worthwhile items to try.
-Desserts in general aren't great, don't save too much space for them. Also, many of them seem to be unavailable most of the time (I have this complaint for a few other menu items as well). The ginger milk is great though.

All in all, nice place."}
{"text":"My most ultimate favourite place to have sushi. Their desert is delicious! Everything about sushi is good there. Only thing is, limited parking and super long line ups. If there were more parking, it'll be more worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Looking for an AYCE (All You Can Eat, for you non-gluttons/partakers in this bloodsport) spot in Scarborough, we thought that Ten-Ichi would be a safe pick for a walk-in. We're a small table of 4, we figured.  Plus, it's a random Monday night - who takes on an AYCE challenge on a Monday? 

The answer is a heck of a lot of people.  In fact, the place was fully packed and there was a steady stream of new customers constantly lined up at the door until about an hour to last call.  Luckily, one of our companions were smart to make a secret reservation, so we were able to get in with zero wait time.  

With the packed house, the mostly Mandarin-speaking waitstaff were super busy.  This meant that it took at least 10 minutes between rounds of food being brought out, and we actually witnessed a table of two behind us that did a dine and dash.  We suspect it's because they were angry about the wait time and decided their food was never coming.  Rewd.  All the food that they had ordered followed shortly after, served by staff that had thought the couple had just stepped out for a quick smoke.  

The food - not bad, actually.  I'd say it's pretty decent for AYCE.  Rarer AYCE menu items include: squid/ika sashimi, raw sweet shrimp/amaebi, oishizushi/compressed squares of sushi topped with seared salmon and jalapeño (if Ten-ichi would allow a dollop of Japanese/kewpie mayo underneath the salmon, this would be ace! Pun on AYCE - get it?), beef tataki, and a salmon skin roll where the entire roll has been fried.  

The only negative thing is that you can't expect to get everything you order.  My friend had to order the grilled eggplant (which is served without the skin btw, which I found uncommon, and tasted more steamed or microwaved than grilled) at least 5 times before we got it.  The kind lady who tended to our orders was highly apologetic though, and all in all the staff as a whole were very nice and always delivered with a \"Please enjoy your food!\" before placing dishes down.  The 20-something yukata-clad lady with gold sash was so sweet that one of our friends was enamoured by her.  If the waitstaff reads this: our friend was going to try and leave his business card on the table with his number, but realized he had none with him.  Ahh well, summertime sadness for him, heh.

Drinks cost extra here as per norm, free hot tea for all but they also have fresh-pressed juices like watermelon and strawberry that cost roughly $6.99 per small jug size."}
{"text":"I ordered their sushi combo instead of AYCE.
Overall I was happy with what I got. The sushi pieces tasted great, and the California roll was soft and did not have too much rice. Even though they used damaged tuna for my sushi, the overall ingredients tasted fresh.
There were a few things I wanted to make note of. First, the soy sauce dipping cup is too small and it was difficult for me to use it. It was where wasabi was served, so I had to take it out. Finally, I had to ask to get pickled ginger.
The servers were friendly and pleasant. I also enjoyed the complimentary scoop of ice cream! I would like to come back whenever I am near the area."}
{"text":"I came here once five years ago and really enjoyed the food and was amazed by how fresh the sashimi was. I went back recently and was amazed that nothing has changed. Quality is worthy of its price and makes any downtown location seem unworthy. You order on IPads and the food will literally come 5 mins later. The sashimi is fresh as heck and the maki comes in smaller portions so there is no struggle to finish. I also love all the food dishes! Sofa is also freeeee. The price is a bit more than anything downtown but I rather pay $35 (after tax and tip if you pay cash) any day than pay $20 for any other general location. They also don't take debit, only credit and cash. This place is always worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Came here on Monday night, a group of 6 for the AYCE. Did not have their tepyanki so I cannot comment about that.  
Extremely disappointed in the quality of the food. Some dishes such as the chilled tofu and the corn was extremely salty. Everything else was lacking in flavour or just mediocre. I used to come here years ago and it was delicious, I'm not sure what happened to Tenichi over the years.
I think the worst part was the watermelon juice we ordered. They charge an extra $7.95 for a small jug but it looked like pink lemonade because it was diluted with at least 50% water and sugar. Watermelon is in season right now and is so cheap to buy but they can't even provide their customers with a decent drink despite charging extra for this. This is only one example of the poor quality of food you will receive. There are so many AYCE Japanese places in the GTA that taste so much better so I would rather spend my money elsewhere. I will not come back and I do not recommend this restaurant to anyone else. Did not take any pictures of the food because it wasn't visually appealing for me to even want to grab my phone out. 
Gave two stars merely for the good service I received from the waiters - they are very attentive."}
{"text":"Reservation was at 8, sat down at 8:30 (no complaints it was a busy weekend) But when we got a table, it wasn't cleaned, no cups or plates until like 5 orders in. As with most ayce places we don't get the number we write down, just a serving for the number of people we had. In some cases it was just one piece. Sashimi was good for the most part but anything fried was not great"}
{"text":"I came to this restaurant with a friend for her birthday and I have to say based on the reviews and the fact that this place tops most every sushi in scarborough list we came in with high standards.

I say this AYCE jap restaurant is okay, nothing very special to stand out from the pack.  

The service was good teh food came very fast.  The sushi itself was fresh and tastey but again pretty average, I wouldn't expect anything less at any other place.  Items that we tipically didn't see at other AYCE jap restaurants like the skewers, escargot and avocado salad weren't so great.  The ramen noodles were lacking in flavour and the broth tasted a bit like watered down instant noodle mix.

All in all was good for sushi but nothing special in comparison to other AYCE joints."}
{"text":"Loved the dinner tonight!  Celebrated my birthday at the teppanyaki table with my family.  The best AYCE sushi restaurant in Scarborough!!  Always packed full of people on any given night so I suggest you make a reservation.  Everything from the sushi, sashimi, handrolls to the teppanyaki show was so delicious and well presented.  The wait staff surprised me with a sang a birthday song along with a candle in an ice cream dessert.  We always leave feeling so happy!

The only negative was the washroom which could have used some more cleaning and an air freshener.  Nonetheless, my family will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"We recently went back to Ten-Ichi for a family birthday with a party of 7.  We reserved for an early time (6:30pm) and they were ready for us when we got there and were seated immediately.  We had a young girl server this time and she did a good job.  Everything we ordered came (although a couple of things were a little late) and she even handled my husband's bad moon OK (he didn't want to go there and made sure to be a total pain about it).  Most of the food was pretty good, although the lobster soup was just plain old tomato soup with a few bits of lobster in it.  The chicken satay was really good and the teppanyaki steak as well.  The beef tataki was OK but it has the wrong sauce on it.  The pork tonkatsu was good but again the wrong sauce, mayo instead of katsu sauce.  Don't bother with the ginger creme brulee as it has almost no taste. Overall I was pretty happy with what I got and would go again.  You just have to pick the things you like and pass on the others and you will be fine.."}
{"text":"Declined quality over the years."}
{"text":"Food was great! The salmon sashimi was fatty which my boyfriend and I really liked. Service was amazing because we went in at exactly at 5pm when dinner is open. It got busier in the restaurants in like 30 mins after it opened, however the servers were picking up the busy time! I believe the manager was working that night I went and he put a great smile! The washroom is decent looking but the stall I went to, had a broken lock. Overall, definitely will go back again."}
{"text":"Most of our food (chicken wings and Korean beef ribs) was undercooked, and one lady was forcing us to pay before we had even finished the meal because their cash desk was closing. I asked her to give me 5 minutes and she left and came back twice within 2 minutes to see if we were ready. They also messed up our orders - brought us stuff we didn't order, didn't bring us stuff that we did order, and brought us the wrong amounts.

Our server apologised, saying that the kitchen staff wanted to go home - great, well, we want to go home and NOT have food poisoning. He ended up giving us a 10% discount because their manager wasn't in. 

What's the point of having 11PM as your closing time if you close the kitchen at 10PM and rush everyone out before 10:30? It is absolutely ridiculous that this place forces a 10% gratuity on each bill when the service doesn't deserve it. They don't even deserve the one star of this review."}
{"text":"Came here the other night for an 8:15 Friday evening teppanyaki seating, with a party of 9 for my brother's birthday. I have been here a few times before for AYCE, but this was my first teppanyaki experience. This place was crazy busy when we arrived but we didn't have to wait to be seated. We were brought only one menu for all nine of us which was very annoying. We were also brought two sushi boats to share with some sushi, sashimi, and maki. We then ordered a bunch of other items from the AYCE menu to start off with. We were brought green tea and had to ask a few times for water which was given in really small cups so we had to keep asking for refills. My recommendation would be to offer larger cups for beverages. Our chef was amazing and we asked him some questions which he was more than happy to answer. He did a great job and was accommodating to any requests for more meat and seafood. Overall, the meat and seafood was all really good and the experience is great if you have never done teppanyaki before. That being said, for almost $40 with tip I don't feel the need to go back any time soon and I would rather just go to Korean BBQ and cook my own meat and seafood or just do all you can eat sushi for less money.

Please note: They did include gratuity in the total of each bill for our party which I believe was 10% and came to just over $37, but I decided to tip 10% on top of that bringing it to a total bill of $40.98. Also the last call for food is 2 pm for lunch and 10 pm for dinner."}
{"text":"The food here is really not bad, but I can't say the same about the service. Came here on a Sunday night and the place was crowded. The food came super slow, and when it arrived everything that was meant to be hot, was cold, which really ruined the taste of everything. Who wants to eat cold grilled beef?? Many dishes in our order also never came. Isn't the idea of using an iPad ordering system to increase efficiency and eliminate situations like this? We had to chase down our orders many times, only to be told by the servers that they were too busy. Anyways like I said the food isn't bad, the sashimi is fresh and there's a lot of variety in the menu but I really don't want to go to a place where I have to constantly chase after my food."}
{"text":"Been to Ten-Ichi many times but they just renovated again and I been once after that.  The newly renovated area is more comfortable compare to before.  This place is always busy and line up can take up to 1 hr.  The fish quality is good and the selection on the menu is good.  Only thing I dislike is the service is very slow as it is always a full house.  This place has the best dessert for all Japanese AYCE I been to.  This is still my fave AYCE place and looking forward to go again."}
{"text":"Tenichi was the first all you can eat restaurant that I ever went to, nearly 20 years ago. As far as I know, they've changed a lot since the last time I came (which was about 5 years ago). Unfortunately, it's not as good as I remember. 

Things to note: 

The saba sashimi was watery. I bit into it and got a mouthful of water. 

The escargot was dry and had no flavour. 

The avocado seafood salad was bland. 

The chicken skewer was dry and overly salty. 

The takoyaki was mushy. 

The dessert was mostly good. The tiramisu, custard, papaya soup, chocolate mousse. 

The ginger milk needed a little more ginger. The mango yogurt, which I swear was invented by Tenichi, was slightly hard and lacked its unique flavour. 

The aburi sushi was great. I especially enjoyed the scallop and salmon. 

For the most part, it was decent for an all you can eat restaurant though disappointing due to our expectations from previous visits."}
{"text":"I'm glad I decided to give Ten-Ichi another chance. It is now so much better than my previous disappointing experience. They're kicking back much stronger and now offering a bunch of things I love that other places don't!

Starting with both Scallop and Amaebi Sashimi, two of my favorite sashimi that no other Japanese AYCE offers at the same time (usually just one or the other, not both). They also have a new line of aburi sushi. Though the salmon and white tuna aburi was disappointing, the winner was the scallop aburi sushi! I don't even care about the salmon and white tuna at this point lol

Herb Butter Escargot! Grilled Pork Cheek! Black Sesame Ice Cream!

Still needs to fix inconsistent quality but I'm glad Ten-ichi is starting to get back in the running as a place to go for me.

{"text":"I go to a lot of sushi restaraunts. Food here wasn't amazing.  Service was terrible, they always prioritized all the east asian looking people over us. The only reason I'm giving them a 1 star is because they had a decent amount of vege options."}
{"text":"In Scarborough probably the best place to have sushi hands down.  I find their white tuna Sashimi is good, coconut ice cream to die for and eel easily one of the best I ever had. It's a little bit pricy but it's worth it.  Their Sashimi is always on point. The food comes out really quick.  And their service is impeccable. They have tons of desserts. Try it out."}
{"text":"This is my favourite sushi place ever! And every person I ever took there to eat says that it is the best sushi they ever had! I have lost count of how many times I have been there over the past years.

The price is very affordable for really good quality sushi. And they have a huge variety of things to eat, sushi, sashimi, maki, hand rolls of course but also fried fish, different kinds of chicken and beef, various kinds of tempura, soups, vegetables and more.

The service is also really great and people are always nice, sometimes they will make a mistake like bringing something to the wrong table or forgetting someting but that rarely happens, and is forgivable considering they are always really busy.

Definitely make a reservation! Even with your reservation there is always a small wait."}
{"text":"This is my go to AYCE sushi place.  I have consistently received good service (with the exception of this one new girl with the green kimono shirt, and gold sash), and consistently strong food quality. You MUST make a reservation, otherwise you're guaranteed to have an extremely long wait, which will probably hamper the way you feel about the restaurant. I've read in previous posts that they lose reservations, but that has never happened to me. There is also a wide array of selection in the menu both for the savoury dishes and the desserts. Overall, great place to go with a group of friends/fam to have one. Going with a small group will limit the amount of food you'd be able to eat/try since portions are decently sized (they look small, but are really filling). Overall probably one of, if not the best, AYCE sushi place in the scarborough area."}
{"text":"I think one the best AYCE places in GTA. Keep in mind here you are paying for variety and quantity and not necessarily top notch quality. That being said its a good place for people with good appetite. We always go for the teppanyaki table rather than the other side which seems to be packed all the time. I go for the mix grill which includes shrimp, squid, sable fish, mushroom, Mix vegies, chicken teriyaki, Beef Teriyaki Rib and Sirlion  and rice if you want. Most of the items except the sable fish are a crowd pleaser for people who play it safe with food. Other items like sushi, rolls and sashimi are more of fillers and range in the average to below average. The fried stuff is nothing special but is acceptable for sure. Desserts are tiny goblets and some are above average (mango yogurt which is light and somewhat neutral is my finisher) As mentioned by others reservations are recommended (I suggest if you miss the 6ish sitting try to show up around 8 and usually you will get lucky and find a spot)
Service is ok with some servers being ok  and they usually mix up the food if you ask for it again. I would give 3 and half stars overall especially if you are small group of people as you can try several things and eat till your heart is content."}
{"text":"Went with a large group for my super awesome friend's birthday. There was 13 of us set at 2 separate tables. It's a big venue with comfy booths. Noise level gets up there when it's busy and they dim the lighting in the evening.

The service was pretty quick and they were on top of clearing plates. Each table had their own teapot, that kept the tea insanely hot, and a pitcher of water. You have to tell the server what you'd like to order, they don't have order forms or iPads.

The food was alright, usual AYCE quality. They have some cool in house specials though. The 4th star was for the service and the giant sushi boats!"}
{"text":"We came for their AYCE lunch in a weekday, and there weren't many customers, most were from that area I guess. The lunch menu was average, has both cooked and sushi/roll items and doesn't offer sashimi, but this is to be expected with the price per head at $17. We tried almost everything on the menu and I'd rate the food at 3.5/5 value for money. Service was good too. But having been to many Japanese restaurants and AYCE options in downtown/Markham, my experience at Ten-Ichi was strictly average."}
{"text":"Once upon a time I was a very regular customer here, but a lack of regard for customers, and a bizarre reservation system, combined with slipping food quality, all conspired to have me move on to the MUCH better Matsuda AYCE Sushi up at Middlefield and Steeles."}
{"text":"Large selection of food. On the website they said they served waffles which was an easy sell for the family, however when we arrived some of the items online were not actually available. I went on a Sunday, during dinner time and the price was comparable to other ayce sushi places around the area however still pricey. The environment was homey but definetly does need a little bit of renovation. Overall experience was good."}
{"text":"Sashimi is fresh, love the salmon and scallops. Others are okay, also recommend the eel rice."}
{"text":"Really disappointed! Quality of the food is very bad, sushi rice is falling apart when you pick it up. Slow service, over 15 mins wait between food! Missed a third of our orders. Nobody pick up our plates. Won't come back to this place at all."}
{"text":"The food here is more or less the typical ayce sushi variety, but with torched sushi and the pressed sushi (more and more ayce sushi restaurants are doing these now). The quality of the food is generally good. The food is on par or better than most ayce sushi out there in Toronto.

The thing that was great about this visit and the thing I wanted to talk about was the service! I think typically people expect chinese-run ayce sushi restaurant services to be less than good (and I know, I'm Chinese, and I see this way too often). The expectation is probably no smiles, a couple of missed items, charging you gratuity without telling you so that you might double tip, etc. This visit, however, caught me completely off guard.

It first starts with the greeter at the front. His name was Alex, and he was fabulous. Very friendly and well mannered. He gave us (and other people) a 10% off VIP card (which I suspect was just their business card that they give to everyone), which was good and could be used then and there. Then comes the servers who bring the food out. All of them said the equivalent of \"enjoy your food\" in Cantonese every time. When the bill came, the server pointed out that gratuity was added onto the bill. I don't generally like auto-gratuity, but at least the transparency is there. At the end, Alex walked us and other patrons out the restaurant with some small chat, and when I asked for his name, he told us his name and said that he looked forward to serving us again. Again, the above and beyond level of service gave me a huge surprise and left me very impressed.

The price per person is slightly cheaper than Sushi Legend nearby. Definitely will visit again.

Quality: 7.5/10. Service: 9.5/10. Value: 8/10. Overall: 8.5/10 (not an average)."}
{"text":"Wow, I'm quite impressed with this AYCE restaurant. Good food, good service! 

Came by on a Monday night, and the restaurant was hopping! Many tables seated and everyone buzzing around. They had a very extensive menu, with lots to offer and another menu with just newer items. 

My favourites were definitely the Beef Tataki, Garlic Butter Mushrooms, and Enoki Beef Rolls. The tataki was flavourful without being overdone, but a couple slices could have been thinner. The mushrooms were amazing, but pretty much anything in garlic butter would be. The enoki beef was nicely done, as the beef was still tender without getting touch with rich flavour. 
A couple items could be better though: the Escargot was okay... Nothing special. I ordered a plain udon, but the soup was so salty it made it unbearable to eat.

Service here was probably the best I've had at an AYCE. Food came ridiculously fast, the empty plates essentially disappeared from our table (which is a huge deal when you're at a tiny 2 person table), and whenever possible, the servers came over to ask if we wanted to order and even pour us tea from our kettle! Absolutely spot on!

Would definitely be down to come here again, just a bit out of the way for me. Will keep it in mind when I'm in the area next!"}
{"text":"The food is OK, the place is cold. Imagine you have to put on your winter jacket when you are having your lunch! Also the service is bad, I got only one small bowl of beef for more than 30 minutes after I placed my order. I asked the waiters and they asked me to re-order. My family are celebrating the Chinese New Year but we didn't enjoy the lunch at all! Never go back."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been around for a while. There is an AYCE sushi and and AYCE teppanyaki side. This review is for the teppanyaki side.

I went last Saturday for the second seating at 8:00. We were shown our seats at about 8:15 - not a big deal because the staff were waiting for the first group to finish. I suggest that you book the second seating because that is the last seating so they will not rush you out .

As with the sushi side, the room and seating are tight. There are 4 cooking stations.

Before the chefs came out, our orders were taken for sushi, sashimi, tempura, etc. - basically a condensed version of their sushi menu. Yes, this is AYCE too throughout your meal. 

After a bit after, the chefs came out. Now, if you are looking for the usual teppanyaki show, this is not really the place. The chefs basically just cook the food. However, they are very nice, polite and will answer all questions. Also, we joked with our chef showing a video clip of a friend who was at another teppanyaki place that same night and their \"show\". We told the chef to make us proud and put on a better show.  He did that. So, if you ask you will get a show. 

There is so much food. They cooked mushrooms, steak, 2 kinds of fish, mussels, short ribs, shrimps and chicken for everyone. He will also cook fried rice for you if you want. We thought that was it but no. The chef asked us again and again if we wanted more food and what we wanted to have cooked until we could not eat anymore (this is not taking into during this you still had the AYCE sushi, sashimi, etc. ).   The food was served at a good pace.

This was so worth the $31.95  and I will be back. However, note that they do not take debit cards. They take credit cards and cash only."}
{"text":"This place is so bad. I came here because it was my mom's birthday and they are over priced, they didn't have sea weed salad for all you can eat. Their food is nasty! Took forever to come. I don't get why people still go there. It's so terrible.
I would give it 0 star if I could."}
{"text":"went there recently for weekend lunch. they didnt have much on the menu especially not the dish i like such as unagi etc... i wouldnt go back there for lunch again."}
{"text":"Yuck yuck and yuck. 

Freezing cold dining room, not fresh, and dirty everything. 

Don't recommend this place it taste terrible aside from the other problems. 

Very hard to find a decent AYCE these days."}
{"text":"We had a party of 6 and made a reservation earlier that day for a Thursday night dinner at 7:30pm.  We had an extra person join us last minute so when we arrived I said we are actually 7 people.  They told us because of the extra person we have to wait.  Many large groups.  There were tons of people waiting at the front of the restaurant - about 30!  We thought we wouldn't have an issue getting a table on a weeknight.  We were obviously wrong.  

We ended up having to wait about 30 minutes before we were seated.  I was getting very very hangry waiting so long.  I'm sure it was written all over my face.  The hostess did make up for it though by offering us a Sashimi/sushi boat as soon as we were seated.  From yelp reviews sounds like this is standard behaviour for waiting patrons but I really appreciated it.  It was enough to tie me over until our first order arrived.  

Service was slow all night.  It wasn't the waiters fault though...it was just rammed in there.  He was hustling and bustling but just simply could not keep up.  

The food itself was pretty good.  I probably wouldn't go back though.  It was just so insanely busy that you continually had to check up on your order and wait a long time before food came.  Food would then settle and you're not hungry anymore by the time your order arrived.  

The waiter said it's like this all the time and way worse on a weekend.  We got there a bit before 730 and left the restaurant about closing time.  Long and late meal for a weeknight and having to get up early for work the next day."}
{"text":"One of my favourite AYCE sushi restaurants in the GTA! 

Pros: 
- one of the few restaurants with a bigger selection of sashimi; the usual + they have octopus, sweet shrimp (weekends only I believe), and scallop! 
- you can order red tuna sushi! In maki or hand roll
- huge selection of grilled items, desserts, and appetizers
- the host is very patient with customers and dealing with wait times 
- waitstaff is nice and friendly (though sometimes they can seem rushed as they are very busy)
- teppanyaki is available 
- great for large groups
- food comes fast! 

Cons:
- SUPER long wait times for dinner ESPECIALLY ON WEEKENDS (table for two is an hour wait time with no reservations) try to call in to book a table!
- restaurant area can get pretty loud depending on the customers 
- soda is not included with the AYCE menu"}
{"text":"Fresh, Tasty, Value, Still the best AYCE around GTA..Must call to book early, if you don't book and wait to be seated, it may take you over 1.5 hours...Parking are scarce and tight, drive safe !"}
{"text":"Ahhh yes another Japanese AYCE.

Been here multiple times with friends and families and they never seem to disappoint.  The service does become sluggish as the place gets busy which is between 7-9 PM but that is forgiveable. 

The food is good however do not try the Avocado Seafood Salad it may sound temptingly good but its not, its basically warm guacamole with seafood (glahhh). Do try the Roses Maki as it is one of the best Maki I had so far in any AYCE resto, its basically an avocado roll however the mango sauce on top makes it the best Maki ever, I can literally just drink that stuff. The hot food is also good the sirloin roll and steak was cooked well.

Food - 4/5
Recommendations - Roses Maki, Chocolate Mousse, Tiramisu, Sirloin steak and Roll,"}
{"text":"Amongst a sea of AYCE pseudo-Japanese** restaurants in GTA, this would be my #1 choice for loading up on decent quality food. 

PROs 
- the BEST Korean style grilled beef short ribs, thick meaty cut, always cooked perfectly, always tender 
- succulent grilled shrimps and cod fish 
- beef rolls with green onion, nice 
- grilled eggplants with bonita flakes, likey 
- efficient service, they are quick to bring you the food once you order and always take away dirty plates promptly 

CONs 
- Always packed. Be sure to make a reservation in advance 
- No ebi sashimi on weekdays (Mon-Thur) 
- No seaweed salad (goma wakame) 
- Terrible tempura 

OVERALL, good value and decent food.

** Almost all of these places are owned / operated by Chinese or Koreans, so adjust your expectation for authenticity"}
{"text":"...they probably would have gotten a 5star if they had a cart that rolled me out to the car too! i must have gained 20 pounds after our ayce dinner - $25.95/person on the weekend (we went on a Sunday evening).

after reading all of the great reviews I was still skeptical that any ayce places can be all that good - and I was pleasantly surprised. every dish was of good quality; my favorite were the beef yakitori, roses maki, and the mango yogurt dessert. I was a little disappointed the creme brûlée was unavailable (only available wednesday and thursday dinners - weird).

good service, orders quickly came and it was pretty packed when we were there. couple things I will say that was a con - the teppenyaki sirloin was cold - probably would have been worth it paying an extra $2 to sit at the teppan tables; unagi maki rolls tasted super scaly and i felt like in had a fish market in my mouth."}
{"text":"Friends told me about this place, and claimed it was one of the better AYCE Sushi places in Toronto.  Maybe it was overhyped for me like Transformers 2, but it seemed only slightly above average.

The best dishes I had were probably: White Dragons roll, avacado seafood salad, spice salmon hand roll.  

Everything else was good, but the quality and variety doesn't necessarily stand out from the rest of the AYCE crowd.  They do have a variety of desserts, but being a dessert freak, I was really disappointed when they get to my table.  None of the desserts were actually very good, the mango yogurt, tiramisu, waffle & ice cream (which isn't an actual waffle, more of a 
wafer or something), chocolate mousse, were all subpar.

Nothing was BAD, it's just nothing was outstanding, and you have to factor in the price (it's a bit more expensive than other AYCE joints) so that's why it's getting an \"A-OK\".  After tax and tip, you're looking at $30 a person, and that doesn't include any drinks (other than water and tea).

I wouldn't hesitate to go back if my friends suggested it, but I won't be getting any cravings to come back."}
{"text":"My go to place for all you can eat sushi! Been here a lot of times and it has never failed me. Great food selection and their mango yogurt is still one of the best in town. 

I never understand why ayce places always cheap you out on what you ask for, so we just had to keep reordering 2-3 times before they brought out a dish we asked for from the first order. 

Ill be back here again."}
{"text":"I give this 3 stars because when I've been here for AYCE sushi, the service is kind of slow. Also I'm vegetarian and I love veggie sushi bento boxes, but they don't offer this on the menu. The vegetarian options are limited and uncreative. How ever they are good but nothing fantastic. I'll be back, it's convenient."}
{"text":"I had an decent experience at Ten-Ichi. The sashimi was fresh, with the sweet shrimp and scallops being my favourite. They serve you a sashimi boat for your first order, making it a unique dining experience, as most AYCE sushi places don't present the food this way. 

However, the Aburi Sushi was just average and I don't recommend the hot food. The ika (squid) sashimi was also not available during my visit, which was a huge disappointment. Our server was polite, but orders were often missed by the kitchen and food came out very slowly. Hopefully, I will be able to give this place a 5 star next time I visit."}
{"text":"Nice place. Pretty nice restaurant for groups. A little pricey for AYCE dinner for the same experience I can get around downtown Core. We were there for AYCE dinner and it cost $38 per person ,With that they will include your tax and tip so all you have to do is tap, but still is a little pricier than most good sushi places I have been. 

On the menu I was hoping they have salmon tereyaki or some grilled fish of any kind but they don't, so that's a bummer for me. And oh, if you want to book for the teppanyaki table book ahead of time when I asked the server she said they only have limited sessions per day and you can stay at the teppanyaki table for 2 hours."}
{"text":"As someone who tends to shy away from buffets and AYCE hubs because of my struggle to match the quantity of food ordered to the price I'm paying, this place was well worth the struggle.  The decor is lovely, the food was fresh, and the dinner menu had plenty of options to keep my table-of-one teeming with a variety of new and familiar flavors. 

Service was a little slow at the beginning (walked in with a family of four and didn't place my first ordered until almost ten minutes after they already started eating) but the full menu and quick turn out from the kitchen made up for it. I came around 1715 and it was very quiet, but by the time I left at 1845 the place was pretty packed yet things still took no time at all to come to the table. 

I grubbed for over an hour (yes, by myself) on unagi, salmon, ebi, spicy tuna, chicken yakitori (didn't care for), inari (didn't care for), white tuna, red dragon maki, rainbow maki, grilled zucchini, flounder, and several dessert items (tiramisu, mango pudding, red bean and vanilla ice cream) and it was all yummy (with the exception of those mentioned)! The fact that I can remember everything I ordered speaks volumes! Their fruit juices looked delicious on neighboring tables but I opted out to focus on a pitcher of water. 

I don't usually spend $30 for a meal but this was well worth it. Oh! And the fact that I could pay in US dollars was a huge help since paying cash got me 10% off my bill. Score!

A return visit will be a must next time I come out to see my cousin, but until then I'm left with the challenge to find a place in LA that can compare."}
{"text":"Ten-Ichi (ichi = 1) should change its name to Ten-Ni (ni =2).  Two seemed to be a reoccurring theme tonight.  This was the second time I had reserved a table in advance and I arrive and they have no record of it. We ordered most of our dishes in twos, and they only ever brought one.  And subsequently, we had to ask twice for some items that they didn't even bother to bring.  Maybe they should have Jacob Two-Two working for them as well... At least it would spruce up their PR.

If it weren't for the quality of the food, it probably wouldn't even be worth the hassle to come back.  

We ordered the following items:

White Dragon Roll (crispy kani roll topped with tai tataki, teriyaki sauce and bonito flakes) - We didn't actually order this item, but I am glad they did because I would've never thought to have ordered it.  It was good!

Roses Maki - This is what Ten-Ichi is reputable for.  It is made with mango puree, and avocado, and is very very tasty.  A must try item.

Unagi Hand Roll - My parents ordered 2 of these, and I was too full to try it, but from what they told me, it was good.  

Beef Roll - Had a nice charred flavour to it, was tender, and very savoury.

Garlic Beef - I always prefer this beef dish to all others because of the burst of flavour that simple garlic gives to it.  However, tonight it was way overdone, to a point where it was too chewy.  How inconsistent!  The last time I was here it was amazing.

Salmon Roses - Very tasty!

Salmon Sashimi - Was extremely fresh, even buttery-er than the white tuna which was surprising.  However, the portion sizes were half of what they used to be... It appears they have now taken what would normally be one slice of salmon sashimi and further sliced it in 2.  So make sure you order more than you normally do.

White Tuna Sashimi - Was not fresh tonight.  Grrr...

Seafood Salad - Probably the unhealthiest salad out there, but who cares?  It is too delicious to pass up on.  Plus you can tell your trainer that you had a Seafood \"Salad\" and not get dumped with an additional 20 pushups.  It is served on a shell and is made mostly with avocado.  It is creamy goodness!  Allow for 25 minutes prep time.  Order this the moment you sit down, but don't down more than 1, because these babies are filling!

Grilled Eggplant - We always try to get in some veggies, and this is infinitely healthier than tempura without sacrificing flavour. 

Desserts:

Mango Yogurt - Leave all your preconceptions of what yogurt should be like behind.  You are not going to find Yoplait here!  It is more like an egg white custard topped with a spoonful of mango puree. 

Green Tea \"Waffle\" - Again, leave any craving for a piping hot waffle topped with ice cream behind.  The \"waffle\" which you are served is really a pizzelle disguising as a waffle.  But after a night of AYCE, its probably more of a blessing than anything else.

Ginger Creme Brulee - If there was any ginger in it, the sugar killed it.  It was, however, nice and creamy as a creme brulee should be.  

Summary:
Food - ****
Service - **

It should also be noted, that its common practice of AYCE sushi places to tack on an automatic 10% gratuity.  I am a firm believer that servers have to work for their tip.  I am very anti-automatic tip, not because I'm cheap; if the service is good I give you a good tip; if its bad I should have the freedom to tell you what I thought of your lousy service by decreasing my tip.  Automatic tip additions to your bill means: we really don't give a shit what you think of our service, we're not going to improve, and if you don't like it - sayonara Yvonne-san!  And so the search for a new Japanese dining establishment continues..."}
{"text":"I am extremely confused why this restaurant has more than a 2 star rating. The food and service are both shit. 
1. We had a reservation for 7:30 and was not seated until 8:20pm. Table was available earlier but no one cleaned it for a good 15mins. Took us multiple people and times to hail down a waiter/waitress to set it up 
2. One of the chairs had spilled crap on it
3. The sashimi was too fishy and warm 
4. The seaweed and tempura bits were not crunchy 
5. All sushi had too much rice and not enough \"stuff\"
6. Staff didn't speak English 
7. Washroom was gross and had no toilet paper  
8. Weekend dinner is a whopping $30, when the food is at $20 quality 

The only good thing was that the manager seemed to *try* and make it up to us by giving us a 10% off coupon. But of course it's cash only and probably means some under reporting in income/illegal accounting. He also promised us two sushi boats. Wow, that's great because it's not like it's all you can eat and we could have ordered specific dishes we liked."}
{"text":"Ten-Ichi is a household name in Scarborough. Despite all the bitter reviews and flames, it is still the most popular AYCE Japanese restaurant in Scarborough.

I grew up eating here at least once a year. After all, it's a popular choice for throwing a party. Unfortunately, the quality has gone downhill for the last few years.  Take note everyone:

- Service:  It has been on and off, and it reached a breaking point when a waitress rudely yelled at my party last year when we were somewhat slow at clearing our area.  You see, we were not given prior notice that she wanted us out by a certain time and we were still waiting on our desserts to arrive. She was uncompromising when it came to splitting the bill as well. The cherry on top was when she was irritated when we wanted to pay by credit card instead of by cash. This year, I came back for my mom's birthday and I noticed that the woman was no longer there. We were tended to by two other servers and they were very professional and hospitable. 

- Food: The sashimi did not seem fresh.  The tuna had a funky taste to it and the saba felt like it had slightly dried up. The rolls were standard in quality. The teppanyaki varieties were better, with the ribs being the most flavourful part of the dinner. However, I cannot really vouch for the cleanliness and freshness of the meats, seafood and vegetables because I think there is a high chance of cross contamination. My dad unfortunately got the runs minutes after eating here...

- Price: Ten-Ichi is on the more expensive end for AYCE. For Teppanyaki, it is 34 dollars plus tax and tip.  That's a hefty expenditure for low quality food, albeit the enchanting cooking performances.

Overall, I wouldn't recommend Ten-Ichi.  The service has improved, but the price, food quality and flavour are questionable. Eat here at your own risk."}
{"text":"Solid 3/5 for food and service. It was alright overall.
I thought the flavours were just okay, nothing really wow'd me and there wasn't anything unique about the place. The fish seemed fresh which is great. The place can get quite busy and staff were friendly and nice."}
{"text":"Last weekend was the Lunar New Year, as per yearly traditions, huge food fests are a must. This year, I went to Ten-Ichi ??  Japanese Cuisine. They have two sections - one for the all you can eat (AYCE) sushi, and another section for their Teppanyaki guests. I went for the Teppanyaki section.

Since space is limited within the Teppanyaki area, you should definitely call ahead and book a spot to ensure you get a seat. I'm not sure if you could walk in and ask for a spot, perhaps if you're lucky and don't have a crowd with you. But I would recommend reserving spots to be sure!

Our booking was for 8 or 830pm, but the Chefs got ready by around 830 or 9pm. While sitting at the Teppanyaki section, you can also order food from the AYCE sushi menu while you wait! Which is super awesome - but remember to save your tummies for the upcoming food from the Teppanyaki.

Definitely had my phone out a lot to Insta-Story the Chef's cooking! I haven't had teppanyaki for a long while so I was pretty excited when I found out for Chinese New Year! The Chef on the other side of the table was more entertaining than ours - perhaps the crowd there was more engaging compared to ours. But either way, seeing the Chefs cook is still entertaining and creates a different vibe than the regular AYCE meal.

The food was great overall and I enjoyed most of the dishes they had served during the meal. I personally really enjoyed the Salmon, Mussel, Steak and Beef Ribs. They offered another type of fish which I didn't like at all (edit: turns out it was Cod Fish), and the rest of the dishes were okay. The Salmon was a huge surprise for me, I didn't expect it to be that good!

If I recall correctly, the entire meal consisted of: Salmon, Cod Fish, Mussels, Chicken, Shrimp, Steak, Mushrooms and Beef Ribs.

Our Chef was really nice and pretty much offered the extra bits of food to us compared to the other family that he was tending to, heh heh!

While eating, the Manager (I'm assuming) came by to chat with us, making sure we're okay and all that... but while doing so, also slipped us a discount card. This discount card offers to take 10% off your meal if you pay in cash.

How the Teppanyaki meal works:
- On the first round, the Chef will serve you the full course meal, so all the dishes will be served
- After he is done that, he will ask every one on the table if they would like to have seconds of any particular item. Eg: \"I would like to have 4 pieces of shrimp, 2 Salmon and 3 pieces of Mussel\". You can list the amount and of what food item you like, and he tries his best to remember... since there's multiple orders per person.
- They also offer vegetables and eggs, if you like. The vegetables consist (mostly) of fried beansprouts.
- After the second round, he will then ask again, if you would like anything for the 3rd round of food
- If no one would like a 3rd round, the Chef then exits the area for good. But you're welcome to sit and order food from the AYCE menu.


We also ordered Fruit Punch, which also tasted better than what I had expected! :3 . The other table also ordered the Fruit Punch, so I guess that says something about it, haha.

Lastly, what is an AYCE without dessert right?
I love their Chocolate Mousse! Tiramisu, Jello and Mango Pudding were also pictured. We also had Red Bean, Vanilla and Mango ice cream!

We tipped the Chef when he came out with the food for the \"2nd round\", since we might not see him after. I'm not sure if people do this on the regular, or if it was because of the Chinese New Year occasion. I would like believe that people should do this on the regular though... since Teppanyaki is sort of an eatertainment. Yes, eating + entertainment = eatertainment.
I definitely left super stuffed and went into a food coma after! I had a good experience eating Teppanyaki at Ten-Ichi  . Would definitely recommend it for a special occasion since the price point is more slightly expensive than the AYCE sushi.

Special occasion, like oh I don't know... Valentine's Day, perhaps? :p"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went on a Friday night at 7pm with a few of our friends (party of 4). We made reservations beforehand, but even with reservations, we had to wait more than 10 minutes to be seated.  

We were pretty disappointed. The service was very slow, even after dinner rush was over. The food we ordered didn't resemble that of the picture in the menu.  We ordered crispy calamari.  In the menu it was actual pictures of mini squid, but it just came as rings. Small rings at that.  The portions are oddly small for an AYCE place.  We ordered the Spicy Golden Roll and it came in 4 pieces.  Rolls usually are 6-8. I'm not even sure if there was any fish or shrimp in the roll since the menu doesn't tell you what the rolls are made of.  Their selection of rolls are pretty small as well.

They also seemed to get the number wrong.  We ordered 10 salmon sashimi,  10 tako (octopus) sashimi, 10 Hokkigai,  6 scallop sashimi.  We got 8 salmon, 10 tako,  15 hokkigai, and the scallop sashimi never came.  We also never got our wasabi mussels. 

We also ordered tonkatsu, which is supposed to be specifically deep fried port cutlet, but we had some chicken  pieces as well. 

The desserts were not bad.  Except the mango yogurt.  A few of the ones my boyfriend and I got had what seemed like wooden splinters in them.  We thought maybe they were mango fibers at first, but don't think they are that hard.  It  also took at least 20-25min for  them to bring us our desserts. This is also the first sushi place I've been to that ran out of green tea ice cream.  

All in all,  I would not go back to this place. It was honestly a waste of money. Poor service,  mediocre food quality,  smallest portion sizes I've ever seen at an AYCE, dirty cups and plates, many menu items were unavailable.  They also applied a 12% tip on our bill which wasnt made known to us until the bill came.  It isn't written anywhere in their menu either."}
{"text":"This is one of the better AYCE places. The variety will give you a good run for your money. The taste of the food is quite decent. I love the skewered chicken and beef. Their sashimi selection sport some interesting items such as the amebi and scallop. The makis are made quite well and only given  1/2 serving leave us room for more. There are hit and misses on the menu but it really boils down to preference. The tea was strangely memorable and awesome...I wonder why it left such a strong memory. I would recommend this place as an easy option for group night or date night where you want tapa style to share. I feel like this place is a place I'll continue going to time and time again, it's worth a try if you want to change up your AYCE sushi game. Note: Beware,  tips are included at 17% on the bill..."}
{"text":"After a 3-year hiatus, again the same group voted on returning to this place, and I went in expecting more of the same given my previous experiences and some more recent reviews.   I am pleasantly surprised to see they have addressed some of the issues, and for this they should be commended.  They did not overbook tonight so we were seated at our reserved time, and even when the dining room was full, dishes did get to us within a reasonable time (with one key exception, read on).  

One major improvement was the menu, which was no longer a long numbered list, but instead, large photos which made it easy to simply point at which item you wanted.  Competing restaurants of this type have for the most part switched to that annoying iPad system so it was refreshing to come to an AYCE place where the waitstaff actually have to understand English and interact with customers (beyond picking up an iPad to tap on the \"send' button).. Amazingly not a single order was missed, every item we asked for, we received.  However, on one round we ordered three servings of sirloin, they dropped off one serving in the centre of the table (quickly inhaled by our group of seven) and then 5 minutes later, asked what else to order. I asked what happened to the other two steaks...  problem resolved 2 minutes later. Meat quality was never a question, so nice to see they have not gone back to that gristly \"USDA Select\" crap they served 5 years ago.

I was surprised to see that bowl of vomit \"signature dish\" called avocado salad still on the menu (with a photo no less)... maybe somebody can tell me what region of Japan thought to take guacamole, mix it with seafood, stick it under a broiler, and call it a salad. Nobody at our table ordered it.  Maybe it's meant to be served as baby food....

One joke they served us was the \"escargot\". This was the TINIEST piece of snail meat hiding in the middle of a bowl of bad instant mashed potatoes (made with water and greasy as hell with way too much butter).  Geez, just serve me the snail meat in a small pool of butter, is it that difficult to do?   And the \"lobster soup\" can best be described as 1/4 ounce of lobster meat hidden in a bowl of Campbell's Tomato Soup.  Why not just call that Cream of Tomato Soup with a Hint of Lobster.   That was NOT a lobster soup....

Sashimi and sushi (nigiri) pieces were noticeably larger than in past visits. No more paper-thin pieces of fish like in the past.  Also glad to see unagi sushi (grilled eel) back on the menu.   I refuse to eat Gaijin Monster Truck McSushi Rolls from Hell (tm) so I will not comment on the quality of those items.  

The biggest surprise of the evening was, when we ordered the \"ginger creme brulee\" and did NOT get the usual answer of \"we didn't make any today\" or \"we ran out\".  Maybe they did read my Yelp review and realized I caught on to their little bit of favoritism.  To celebrate I ordered three of these.  However, this was also a disappointment.  It wasn't sweet enough and, even though it had ginger (and not much of that either) it still needed vanilla bean for the proper taste.  I did consider it a small victory to actually be served it (after 10 years of futility...) and not have to know Cantonese or Mandarin for the privilege.

Of the desserts we had, again the coconut ice cream took centre stage.  Sweet, creamy, and nice natural vanilla and coconut flavors with shredded young coconut meat in the mix.  Highly recommend it.  Although, again I seriously doubt it's house-made...

I admit I arrived there tonight expecting yet another bad experience. When you go in with low expectations, it's not hard to impress.  So for that they deserve an upgrade to 3 stars. I wouldn't go back willingly but at least if the group outvotes me and picks it I don't have to go in so negatively."}
{"text":"food quality is unmatched in this area. seating is too crammed, like you are literally sitting shoulder to shoulder with strangers. Service is meh... miss orders all the time so probably just get use to it."}
{"text":"Another satisfying AYCE buffet dinner at Tenichi.
99% of the food items we ordered were prepared with care. Everywhere was fresh and tasty. Meats were juicy and well marinate. Grilled items were grilled to perfection. Eg chicken yakitori was bigger, tastier and juicier than what many other places offer. All sashimi items fresh, cut to a generous thickness, and not frozen. All rolls were delicious.

Crispy calamari was a bit disappointing; menu picture show small whole squids. They said they ran out and using the rings instead. No problem. However, for some reason, the texture is super soft, almost mushy, or like batter. Really odd for squid. There was no strange taste though.

Like I said, everything is good, but I do especially like the garlic sirloin steak and ginger milk (Saturday only).

Service was good. Got all our orders right and promptly. Servers always lay down the plates gently and cautiously, unlike some other ACYE places.

Came here around 5:30pm without reservation, but highly recommend making reservations.


After many years, this place is still bustling because food quality and service is still very good. Definitely one of the best AYCE in the city, and I do look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Small spaces. Slow service. Old style all you can eat. 

No papers or ipads to order. My family is a very tall/bigger family ( I'm 6\"1) and the seats are tiny. 
Waited 10 minutes for a ginger ale. Slowed/stopped bringing more food when they thought we had enough. 

Sushi was decent. They had sashimi scallops which I've never had before. Rolls were decent. 

Tbh I'd rather go to Niji for a bento box. 

It was my boyfriends bday and overall an unimpressive experience. Nothing terrible but not something to write home about."}
{"text":"Only went once, the time I went, I was offered a seat at the hot table. 
Holy food, the guy cooked and cooked and cooked, we kept taking everything he put on our plates, even though we don't like sea food lol. 
Apparently there is a all you can eat sushi offered as well, we only ever saw a waiter once. 
The hot table was pretty ok, except a bunch of the seafood make everything taste like fish.
Next time, we wont sit at the hot table."}
{"text":"It's a nice AYCE Japanese restaurant. There's a lot fewer choices than in your typical 168 Sushi or one of those big places, but the food tastes fresh and is extremely well prepared. The fish on the sushi is well cut, the flavors are powerful, and you still get a wide variety of Japanese dishes. The salmon belly sushi excels, thanks to its mix smokiness and tenderness, Finally, the desserts are refreshing. The mango yogurt cleanses the palette the chocolate mousse is fun, although, don't expect a traditional French chocolate mousse. Finally, the decor is fun, but I was disappointed at the lack of cleanliness of the washrooms. However, it wasn't so bad that it was a dealbreaker."}
{"text":"This is not the Ten-ichi I knew 5 years ago. What happened to the quality of food.
Have to eat to other new Japanese food around."}
{"text":"Our second time here. Decided to give it another chance. Portions are small, pictures very misleading, menus extremely small for such high price tag. Some menu items were not available,  staff not very friendly or approachable, always hovering around you that it's uncomfortable and awkward. 12% tip is automatically added to your bill and not dependent on the service of the staff. Freshness of the food is questionable. If you are in the area I would definitely recommend Matsuda sushi."}
{"text":"I recently went to Ten-Ichi for the first this past Friday and I was kind of curious to see myself if it was the best Japanese AYCE restaurant in Scarborough/Markham as many others have mentioned.

We called and made reservations for four at 7:30 pm. Once we arrived, we were quickly seated, it was quite busy, so if your planning to go on a weekend, make sure you make reservations. It was $25.95 per person for dinner (Fri - Sun price) which is on par price wise relative to it's competitors.

The menu at Ten-Ichi is not very extensive but for the items they do offer on their menu, they do a reasonably good job.

Sashimi/Sushi:

The Sashimi offered is small and simple (Salmon, Red Snapper, Surf Clam, White Tuna, Herbed Salmon and Sweet Shrimp). The Sashimi is pretty fresh for a Japanese AYCE, nothing spectacular.

The only issue I had with the food is the maki rolls specifically the rice, we ordered the spicy salmon rolls and  the tuna maki rolls and the rice was too thick and rolled too tight making the maki rolls too heavy and not as easy to digest.

Grilled Foods:

The grilled food is really good, specifically the Korean kalbi, sizzling sirloin steak and the salt and pepper chicken wings.

The Korean Kalbi had a fair amount of meat and had a really nice char to it, the sizzling sirloin steak was very flavourful because of the garlic cloves and seasoning and they probably do the best chicken wings for any Japanese AYCE, they were perfectly seasoned and grilled.

Desserts:

Ten-Ichi has a fair size dessert menu and some of the items that really stood out on the dessert menu was the mango yogurt and the ginger creme brulee. The fried banana was not too good and some of the other items like the tiramisu, ice cream, chocolate mousse and custard cream were pretty standard for a Japanese AYCE restaurant.


The service was pretty average like any other Japanese AYCE restaurant, the food came out in a reasonable time and a few items that we ordered, we had to follow up on but it's somewhat common at any busy Japanese AYCE restaurant when you order  a lot of food items. When I think of bad service at a Japanese AYCE restaurant, nothing compares to Yang's on Highway 7 in Markham."}
{"text":"Ten ichi is one of those restaurant that has been around a whlie and transformed from a la carte to ayce. to be honest i've been here 2 times before for AYCE, it wasn't very good in the past, perhaps i was here during a slow time during weekday night, but it was not bad this time, the service speed was relatively quick, and the food quality was mostly okay, some misses such as the sirloin beef was not good, or the chicken skewer. overall the sushi was not bad and the sashimi was okay. its not exceptional but does everything to your expectations. 

in the area where there isn't a lot of ayce, i would recommend you can try it, though it is a bit pricey then other places."}
{"text":"This place been here for over 15 yrs and I have to say it has improved very much. It wasn't all you can eat before but I recently had a xmas party. The chef was very good. The taste was very good. The sake took little longer then usual. The service very good. Its a well 4 star now."}
{"text":"Ten-Ichi is definitely a go-to place for my friends and I to fulfill our all-you-can-eat (AYCE) Japanese food. 

The first time I ever came here was forever ago, it was known for it's teppanyaki. Today, they still have their teppanyaki, but it's only available for dinner hours. 

Nowadays, I just come here for lunch on the weekends when it's not very busy. I call to make a booking for a table ahead of time anyway, just in case. When I came here for lunch most recently, I booked a table for noon, right when it opened. There were a few other groups of guests with about the same amount of people as my table, and we were all seated along the same row of tables, the couple ahead of me was about to take the window table except the server said, window table for the reservation, which was me! It's not like you see some remarkable view out of the window or anything, but it's the fact I have the table with the least traffic because I made a simple call.

Serving staff are friendly. The food is decent for all you can eat. One thing though, don't expect to receive the same dish as you see on the menu. I ordered the fried calamari because it looked good on the menu, it came and didn't look exactly like what I expected, same with the ramen, it was more soup than anything else. Their sushi rolls, sushi pizza and hand rolls are good though, takoyaki and grilled dishes were great as well.

I have no doubts I'll be coming back here again soon."}
{"text":"Probably THE BEST AYCE sushi place with great quality. In fact, it's my favourite AYCE sushi. After renovations from a few years back, they have a lot small tables and space for sit down, you literally have to squeeze in, but this is to accommodate for more people, because this place is PACKED even for reservations. I don't recommend coming here unless you called in for reservations. I mean, even if you do make reservations, you usually have to wait like 15-30minutes. THAT'S HOW GOOD IT IS. Alex is the manager of this store and usually keeps things well in line, making sure there are reservations when there is space. 

You're looking at the average AYCE sushi price, costing about $30 per person including tips and tax. If you add $2 more, you can go sit in for their teppanyaki, where a chef cooks the meats in front of you. 

Their sashimi is really delicious! It's fresh, cut in small pieces so you won't get stuffed with sashimi pieces. In addition, all their rolls are of good quality. One of the dishes I really enjoyed is the avocado served in a clam shell. They have a variety of desserts, one of the best ones are the mango yogurt and the hot ginger milk. I don't really like the tiramisu or the other ones that aren't ice cream, because it's basically just whipped cream. They have a wide variety of ice cream options such as green tea, vanilla, red bean and mango."}
{"text":"Services was just bad, waiting for our sushi too long even not busy at all. We went there on weekday for dinner. It was the first time and also the last time be there."}
{"text":"One of the better AYCE japanese in Scarborough and Markham. Their aburi sushi selection is actually quite good, and thats the reason we keep going back. Aburi is way better than Sushi Legend.

Service on weeknights are usually good because there's less people. We try to avoid this place on weekends due to the ridiculous wait times.

Keep it up Tenichi!"}
{"text":"I have been many times to Ten Ichi

I have never been disappointed

Love the fact that they have expanded the place

On all occasions we have ate at the honsu or teppanyaki table

My fav rolls still are the roses maki, along with the spicy tuna and spicy salmon maki

The salmon roses are super yummy too

Their tempura is awesome

Shrimp and sweet potato is the way to go

An order of the deep fried scallops with the wasabi mayo is always something to get

In regards to the teppan.....salmon and shrimp are still my favs.....along with the scallion/inoki rolls

For the price you pay, it is definitely worth it

Will always come back"}
{"text":"This place is my second favourite AYCE sushi place. They have a really good selection during their dinner time. They tend to get really busy on the weekends and special holidays so I suggest to make a reservation whenever you can. Waiting for a table can be a drag especially when you're hangry. If you're not used to eating raw fish they have lots of different rolls (cooked fish) you can try. I'm a major sashimi fan so I load up on all the fish I can...when I can. I try to stay away from filling up on a lot of rice rich dishes/rolls. This helps when dessert time comes. They have a bigger selection of dessert than other sushi restaurants I've been to. My favourite is the creme brulee."}
{"text":"Their weekend price right now $28 ish for Japnaese AYCE is surprisingly reasonable, in terms of AYCE prices. That being said, I still wonder whether paying that much is justifiable. 

We had to add an extra person to our party last minute, and they were very accommodating of us, even moving us to a larger table. However, the tea we received at the new table was lukewarm (perhaps left over from another party).

I'm fairly pleased with the menu items Ten-ichi has on their menu. Highlights included the beef cubes with garlic, their salmon belly sushi (tasted torched and the amount of rice was minimal), and their scallop and sweet shrimp sashimi. I find it amusing that their seaweed salad is labeled green salad, and that it doesn't seem like they have a lettuce based salad on their menu. However, one of their new menu items is a spring salad (spring mix?). Oh. Their mango yogurt is pretty good, but I have yet to have a Japanese AYCE screw that up.

They have takoyaki on their menu. I would not have recognized it as such. It was in ball form, but it didn't have the visual markings of takoyaki (the mayo was completely absent, and I don't recall there being any seaweed powder on it). On the upside, it was burning hot when it got to our table (the way it should be). If you seriously want AYCE takoyaki, it's alright, but I can and have made better at home in my cake pop maker.

We did hit a few snags that night. After my initial order of 4 pieces of salmon belly sushi, I ordered 10 more. They did not come. We followed up, and changed our order to 5 pieces. They did not come. We followed up again, and changed it to 2 pieces. They still did not come. We followed up for a 4th time and finally, during dessert, they came. Some of their menu pictures, which are present for the majority of their menu items, are grossly inaccurate. The picture of fried calamari is one of small, whole calamari. Upon ordering it, I received thin calamari rings resembling onion rings. While tasty, had I known that was what I was ordering, I would not have ordered it. Their custard cream dessert (both on their new menu items and also on their old menu, was, on the new menu items sheet, shaped like a flower and looked like jelly. I ordered one just to see what it actually was, and I got a shot glass filled with mousse/whipped cream topped with cookie crumbs. Not cool. They did not have the wasabi mussels on their menu. Their ginger creme brulee, the highlight of their dessert menu, was sold out. Their ginger milk is only available on Saturday nights (we went on a Sunday) even though the price for Saturday and Sunday are the same. There is no alternate Sunday item. Their vanilla/coconut ice cream is hit and miss. Twice, there was some distinguishable coconut taste apart from the vanilla (there were coconut shreds in there somewhere), but once, there was no coconut taste at all. Also strange, our ice cream orders took a really long time to get to our table. 

Service was hit and miss. It took us a few tries to get ice water (which actually had ice in it!). Our empty plates were not taken away frequently. We missed some items (as mentioned above). I'm still struggling with where I stand on this issue, but as a party of 7, we were charged a mandatory 12% tip. To my knowledge (and I could be wrong), this was not stated on their menu. If I'm paying a mandatory tip, I'd like service good enough to warrant it.

The food, for the most part, was quite good. However, there is room for a lot of improvement as well."}
{"text":"Ohh another great AYCE that I've found in Toronto.  I've been meaning to check out this place but since it's outside of the DT Core, it was not the easiest.  We went here for lunch and it was by far one of the BEST AYCE lunches I've had in Toronto.

Food: 4/5, Excellent - the sushi was tasty and their other dishes were great too.  Their chicken skewers, garlic steak, ramen and all of their sushi (especially the salmon rose) is the best on their menu.  Their rolls were ok but the philadelphia roll was all rice and no cream cheese.  The portions are super small so it's nice to try different things without wasting food.

Service: 4/5, one of the better AYCE services, where they come to see you often to check and none of these writing what you want on paper but rather, they just write down what you want which I think is MUCH better.

Ambiance: 4/5, great seating and overall look and feel of the restaurant.  It was also well heated/cooled.

Price: 3/5, they include the tip in the price but it came to around $20 per person which is fine by me for an AYCE including tip."}
{"text":"pretty impressive - that's the first thing that came to mind when i walked in on a monday night. this place was PACKED!!

Our server was very helpful. we explained it's our first time here so he recommended to send a few things to try that are popular among the other customers. i appreciate that very much, even though i didn't like all the things i tried, but i ate it all with an open heart.

Things I liked: spicy salmon maki, spicy tuna maki, white dragon roll, grilled jumbo shrimps, seafood spicy raman, mango yogurt and coconut ice-cream. 

things i didn't like so much: baked avocado salad (presentation looked awesome, tasted like warm.. mushy... something), salmon sashimi (they seem to like keeping the salmon skin on the sashimi, strange), rose maki (one of the most popular things to order here, i didn't like the mango sauce, a bit too over-powering), short ribs (um.. korean bbq style ribs that are impossible to bite thru... swallow the whole thing in one gulp), calamari (cold), spider roll (crab wasn't freshly fried, cold and soggy), fried scallop (i think it's imitation scallop, not impressed).

in the end the food was.. hit or miss. But i'm giving it 4 star based on the whole experience. Some of the dishes are very creative which i liked very much. decor was amazing, spacious, very cute arts on the wall, servers all dressed in kimono-inspired clothes. Attentive service, can't complain. a bit pricy, on weekday it was 23.95, weekend it's 25.95 i think. Good to try!"}
{"text":"They only lost stars because of the fact that reservations don't mean anything to them. I expect reservations to mean that you'll have a seat ready for you at that time but nope, reservation means extra 15-30 minutes of waiting.
If a place knows sitting down a person without a reservation will cause problems for the customers that did make a reservation, they should just actually RESERVE those spots and not let people sit in them for at least an hour beforehand.
On top of that, the host kept letting in people- the walls of the restaurant were lined with so many people that it was just uncomfortable. 
And one more thing.. he kept telling everyone they were next and it was just overall very unorganized because nobody got a # and nobody knew who was actually next.

Other than that, thank goodness everyone else had their shit together. Our server Ng, understood our orders really fast and let us know how each order had a specific number of pieces or if it was a plate. I usually dread ordering at AYCE because the servers always look more confused than a newborn child. However, ordering here was a breeze and the food came at a pretty quick rate too.

The food was delish! Very hot and fresh. The portions are not too big, which is good because my greedy mind always tends to over-order at these places. Also, there are not many places where you can order all you can eat takoyaki. YUM! I also really loved the green dragon roll, spicy salmon sushi and the beef yakitori!

I will probably return despite the disorganization. But only during lunch hours or weekday evenings. Better to avoid the hellhole and the chance of being trampled."}
{"text":"I don't like going to buffets -- but this is an exception.  All-you-can-eat sushi and teppanyaki for $22... and the best part is it's good!  The place is always packed for a reason!

As other reviewers have mentioned -- make a reservation. You'll still wait a bit when you get there, but at least you're guaranteed a spot. It's worth the wait -- trust me. I live in SF, but my family is still in the GTA -- whenever I fly in, I make sure that we have at least 1 family dinner at Ten-Ichi.  

And try to always get a teppanyaki table.  They have regular dining tables for $2 less per person, but wouldn't you rather have your teppanyaki meal coming straight from the grill -- warm, juicy and irresistible?!

Last but not the least, save room for dessert!  Sweet tooth or not, you will want to have some of their mango yogurt.  Even when I'm on diet, I end up eating 4 cups.  Did I just say diet and buffet in one post?  Whatever, it's that good!

Would I recommend this place?  No -- if only to sway you from taking my spot at this jam-packed restaurant!"}
{"text":"After a few months and my parents craving for some ten-ichi (this was our go to place for AYCE before), we decided to come and give this place a try after my most recent horrible experience.

When I walked into the restaurant,  I was happy because I saw the previous floor manager!  We made reservation so he sat us down after 5 minutes of setting up the table.  The moment we sat down he immediately ordered a boat for us that includes sashimi, sushi and a few of their well-known rolls (mango rolls, white dragon rolls, etc).

I mentioned to the floor manager that my last visit, the service was terrible.  He apologized and told me he was off for a month so they may have took advantage when he was off.  Knowing he is back, I am super happy the service side is now back to normal.

Food wise, they taste good as usual and I noticed the size of the dishes I ordered last time such as shrimps, scallops, mushrooms, sashimi and other well-known dishes are all back to normal!!

Giving their food has always been consistent and the service department is now back to normal, i truly believe this is by far one of the better Japanese AYCE in Toronto!  With my new VIP membership and my confident on this restaurant back up, I will sure to come back for more!"}
{"text":"Since we had a large group, we made a reservation and was given a private room.  At 8 pm the restaurant was really busy with a line at the door.  With the restaurant being so busy the service was slow.  We had to ask about our drink orders a couple times before getting them.  The food was average at best.  I think for $32/pp the selection could've been better.  Not sure we will return whenever we are back in Toronto."}
{"text":"Scallop sashimi: mine had so much grit. They don't even know how to properly clean them
Yakidori chicken: tasted like bad junk food. Even chicken nuggets would still taste better
Sirloin rolls: not seasoned at all
Daily appetizers (pickled radish and carrot): I don't even know... tasted so off 
Grilled eggplants: I am sure they used a rotten eggplant. I spat it out right away
Mango yogurt: tasted like cheap  pudding with mango puree on top. No yogurt taste whatsoever
Greentea ice cream: so icy. Thought I was having frozen slush 
All the rolls: crab sticks and cucumbers

The only thing I approved was salmon sashimi. We went for dinner too so it was not worth at all. The worst dining experience I have ever had. I know you can't expect too much from AYCE but seriously serve something edible please. My bad for giving them the benefit of the doubt. And service? Do I need to say more about service at AYCE? 

Btw they do accept credit but 10% off for cash."}
{"text":"The service here is good when you flag down the owners. The shrimp shashimi + salmon is my favourite - always thick cut and they give you the sashimi first (which is a bonus in my books). Their salmon roses is very good too - however sometimes I find that they load their rolls with too much rice. Other than that, it does get very busy so make sure to make reservations."}
{"text":"Recommendation so you don't feel \"ignored\":
1. Sit near the main aisles to get maximum attention from waiters
2. Do not be afraid to repeatedly ask about your order if you wait too long ~ 15 to 20 mins from time you submit the order. 
3. Write as much on the order paper as possible bc food comes one by one

+1 Price vs portion: AYCE so you won't need to eat for another week

+2 Taste + food presentation + drink: 
- Fresh sashimi
- Hot food
- Many items
- Good desert
- Nice food presentation with Sushi boat, stone pots and Japanese style dishware
- Unlimited pop refill
- Appropriate priced alcohol 

+1  ambiance + customer service
- Cute waiters in Kimono
- Wooden surroundings 
- Some waiters are EXTREMELY NICE

+1 We always come in big group (10 - 20 ppl) and they never once rush us! Wow!"}
{"text":"if this place has been in business for more than 10 years, then you know it is good.. especially for ACYE.. that has a huge turnaround ALL THE TIME and IS SO BUSY, you need reservations way in advance! 


Through their ACYE teppenyaki is really not ACYE .. meaning you can order up to three times (which no one told us till like when we were about to order for the 3rd time), the rest of the menu is ACYE.. full of sashimi and sushi and other items.. this is what I love about the combination of both. sashimi, sushi and non teppenyaki items..    

Note: do not sit on the left side.. because apparently, this is where the kitchen is? or where the supplies.. there will be a constant array of waiters coming in and out of that side / hole.."}

{"text":"Love love love this plce. Hands down one of the top 3 sushi spots in Toronto. Staff is fadt and host is amazingly friendly."}
{"text":"Fairly good AYCE sushi joint for social eating. The atmosphere and overall appearance of the place is what I remember most. Their sushi is O.K. compared to the rest of the things they have. Lots of friendly waiters. Kind of on the pricey side. 

Final verdict: Just another AYCE sushi joint."}
{"text":"Came here a few nights ago with my friend. I come here quite often because it is close to my work. Food is decent for AYCE but not outstanding.. and soft drinks are not included for AYCE which sucks.. I will not particularly recommend this place but if you live or work in Scarborough and want to go for AYCE nearby, Tenichi is probably one of the better ones."}
{"text":"Everything was absolutely delicious! The service we received tonight was on point. Definitely coming back here."}
{"text":"A staple in Scarborough, this is one of the nicer AYCE places.  I used to go here a lot waaaay back in the day and I do feel like it was better back then, but I'm still happy with it now.

They've expanded from what I remember (looks like they bought the place next door) and that's their teppanyaki area (2 large tables).  Next time I'll try that.  

It's quite a large restaurant Tao good for big groups (although the parking situation is quite dismal - there's additional parking around the corner in the back but even that gets filled up).

Order via iPad - my friend and I ordered a bunch of dishes, spicy tuna roll, crispy salmon roll, tempura shrimp, ramen, a bunch of apps, fried fish, salmon fried rice, and a few desserts (mango ice cream, mango yogurt parfait, tiramisu custard/parfait).

I didn't  particularly care for the ramen as the broth was lacking that something...but everything else was tasty.  Portion size has definitely decreased..lol.

I'd definitely come back though - it's close by, hits the spot and I definitely want to try the teppanyaki here (tried it several times back in the day but obviously that was many years ago lol)."}
{"text":"Definitely glad I came on yelp before I went to the restaurant. MAKE RESERVATIONS. you're fine to call on the same day, but do it; it is packed, even on weekdays.

I'd say the food is only worth three stars - good for all you can eat, but nothing made me go \"WOW\". Where it earns its extra star is:
- Organized and Friendly Service. Yes, there were a few double orders, or things that weren't ours, but they were always taken away with a \"Oh, that's okay, sorry!\" rather than scowls or a \"Well, too bad, you have to eat it\" attitude that I have experienced at other AYCE places. 
- Small Portions! Instead of 6 of each kind of roll, they'll bring you smaller portions (3 of each, for example). I really appreciate this because my favourite part of all you can eat isn't eating as much as you can...my favourite part is getting to sample a little bit of everything. The smaller portions allow you to order a lot of different foods, even if there's only 3 of you at the table!

Finally, I didn't really notice this from the reviews, but the neighbourhood of the restaurant is kind of sketchy on the outside. Don't let that scare you away! The inside of the restaurant is clean and pretty."}
{"text":"I was told by friends that this is a good AYCE Jpn restaurant.  However, beef  tataki is not fresh , mussel taste like rubber, and the rice for the roll is hard.  Wouldn't recommend at all. In addition, the price is way to high by comparing to the food quality."}
{"text":"Quality of food has gone downhill ever since the renovation. The rolls fall apart everytime I go. The surf clam sashimi is really sandy, making my mouth feel nasty and gritty (I spit it out after feeling the sand). Other food items are just mediocre. I gave it a chance because it was one of my top ayce sushi places. But after having two bad experiences I avoid going to this place at all costs. It's decent food but not for the price as the quality seems to go downhill while prices go up. I would expect to pay 20$ for ayce sushi of that quality not 30$(not quite sure of the exact price but it still adds up to about 30$ a person for ayce). Always too packed and you still have to wait a good 15-30 mins even if you have a reservation. The tables are way too small. They don't know how to manage their reservations and walk-ins. Always over booking reservations and giving away tables without thinking ahead. Therefore the unnecessary wait time for those who reserve ahead of time."}
{"text":"Tenichi: The rise and fall of a good AYCE.

This used to be the place TO GO for AYCE sushi. The quality was always there, service was decent, and the variety was great. 

I generally visit their teppanyaki side more because for a couple dollars more, you get to have your food cooked fresh in front of you! And you can still order most of the food from the normal menu as well. 

Anyway, I used to visit this place probably once a month or more because of all its merits. However, recently, starting late 2015 or early 2016 the quality of everything just became a lot poorer. Not just the food, service-wise everything became slower. By slow, I mean you would order something and it'd come when you're about to pay your bill or when you've completely forgotten about it. 
This place, to my surprise, is still always packed for some reason though so they have that going for them. 

Verdict: nah.
Maybe in a couple months this place will become decent again but for now I would advise to try other options."}
{"text":"The sushi rice was alright. Sashimi was not very fresh. Service at the beginning was great, while later they ignored us and didn't collect the empty plates on our table. So we ended up having desserts facing full table of empty plates. Quite a lot of selections, environment is ok, though tables are too close to each other. Understandable they try to crowd lots of customers in the store. But, the ladies room must be repaired ASAP. There are big holes on the floor and they are just sealed with packing tape. And it smells. The flush is not working either."}
{"text":"Great selection, food arrives relatively quickly, decent price for what you're eating. Food tastes good, one of my favorite places in the GTA."}
{"text":"Why come here when you have other options nearby. Always rammed to discomfort. Horrible seat turnover and host management. I called once to reserve a booking and was still inclined to wait 45 minutes. Then they try to curry up sympathy by offering you a boat with items upon seating if you've waited long. But.. it's all you can eat. It makes no difference. Then they give u a sprite juice virgin pitcher. Lol don't go."}
{"text":"Best AYCE sushi and BBQ I had ever! The price is a little high tho. 
Definitely try their tenpanyaki BBQ dinner. The chef is amazing!!! We took a lot of pics and the girls next to us were keeping taking pics as well . It's not only a dinner but more like a show.
When I first came to Toronto, I said I want sushi and sashimi, my fr brought me here. 
Really really great place! And they have lots of choices for dessert, save some room for dessert!
I will bring my fr here later. Not sure if they have BBQ AYCE at weekend lunch.
Dinner all you can eat Teppan.
$25.95/person Mon to Thu, $27.95 Fri to Sun 

If you don't want BBQ Teppan, then $2 less."}
{"text":"Best AYCE sushi in Scarborough. A bit pricey especially for dinner but consistently good after some patience for a table. 

Our server was very courteous and quick thinking even pleasing and impressing the most difficult of customers such as my father. 

Prompt Service, Consistent product, and Quick thinking staff.

I'd recommend this place as much as I would recommend to get reservations as well."}
{"text":"Bit of a disappointing experience all around for Ten-Ichi.

So if you don't know, this place is an AYCE sushi spot in Scarborough that just gets packed to no ends on the weekend. Reservations are recommended, but that doesn't guarantee you a spot, it just puts your name on the list ahead of those poor people who thought \"let's just walk-in\". The host, who was calling up tables, had no idea who came first, which party went where, and it really frustrated the party I had with me. He was calling people who came after me to sit down (same number of people) and some people in my party lost it....

After we did get a table, the servers were friendly, so it made me feel a lot better....Until you actually order and have to wait quite a while for orders which were missed or messed up. Being a party of 4, we ordered as much sushi as we could on the first round in the event that an asteroid were to strike us before we had a chance at a second round. Barring armageddon, we thought we'd at least try to stuff ourselves and not have to wait longer. 

Despite ordering something like 40-50 pieces of sushi, they came with 10-15 pieces?? How did they screw the number up this bad? They did this throughout the night. The food wasn't even that great. Some of the sushi was pretty good, while others were just poorly done. They have amaebi, sweet shrimp, on weekend dinners, but it was weak. The shrimp were miniscule and tasted as though it was defrosted through the day. The hot foods were decent. The sushi maki rolls were actually pretty good as we had an assortment of standard maki rolls like spicy salmon, spicy tuna, mango rolls, green dragon, and golden maki rolls. Some other items like their grilled flounder were just bland as well. At least they had good coconut ice cream?

Hopefully, this was just an off-night, but I won't be back to test that theory out. For $26.95 per person on weekend nights, I guess I expected too much? It never looks good when you talk up a place to your party and it just lets you down so badly...."}

{"text":"The all you can eat lunch special is my favourite all you can eat!!
They don't skip the quality just because it's all you can eat. Everything ordered to the table is beautifully presented. 
I also love that the options aren't limited. You an have steak, sushi, noodles, and much more. 

I rave about this place. So if you're looking for a great meal be sure to give this place a try."}
{"text":"Totally loved it here last time but it was overly crowded. Their food was okay and the manager was super nice. This time I went back and again it was overtly crowded. I could hear the people next to me chewing and had to shout throughout the entire dinner. Horrible. 

Worst part was that every order we put in, only half or less of the order would arrive. The rest wouldn't come and we spent the entire dinner sending dishes away because they weren't dishes that we had ordered. 

The host and manager was a nice happy guy but did nothing to quiet down the larger part group that sounded like a bunch of football fans. 

Worst dinner ever. Not going back. This place is so inconsistent."}
{"text":"On the outside this place looks really ghetto, but on the inside a whole different story. When you get inside to your right they have tepanyakki where the chefs cook the food right in front of you. On the left is where you can sit and enjoy the all you can eat sushi. The seating area is very nice and well decorated the ceiling is filled with lanterns and the lighting was just right to set the mood for eating. 

Waitresses were very nice in the beginning but the moment it started to get very busy it seemed very impossible to get a waitress. Mind you I didn't mind that at all b/c I have alot of patience other people on the other hand were very frustrated, but honestly what do you expect when every seat in the restaurant is taken.

On to the food! There is the usual things you find in an all-you-can-eat sushi but there was a few things that made this place a lil different than the others. At the top of the menu it stated what the chef's recommended which was really nice b/c sometimes I don't know what the restaurant's specialty might be so that saved a lot of time trying to figure out what was good. If you ask any of the waitresses they will tell you the top ten items that are mostly ordered by the customers which was really helpful as well. 

Everything on the menu was very good however there is always one exception, unfortunately it had to do with their maki rolls, hand rolls, and sushi which was basically half their menu. I was definetly not a huge fan b/c of the rice. The rice had no flavour to it, it's like they forgot to make it sushi rice and left it as plain regular rice. That alone took my whole experience away and had to rely on ordering tepanyakki and sashmi for most of the night. 

I do plan on going back b/c I would like to try the tepanyakki where the chefs cook in front of you and most of the meat items on the grill b/c I gave up meat for lent! :-S

Items to definetly order:
- salmon sashmi
- mussels with wasabi sauce
- spicy seafood ramin noodle soup
- grilled shrimp
- sweet grilled fish"}
{"text":"Their website said they would be open until 11pm on a Tuesday night. Came by after a great evening of a movie and drinks on a date night. Super excited for sushi. We arrived at about 9:50pm. They refused us as they were closing... And would not even do take away. The woman was intensely rude, walked right passed us and locked the door and said \"see we close.\" ...won't be going there again, ever. As we sat in the car making a new game plan the same woman walked out in street clothes not two minutes later. Clearly a place that cares about their customers*sarcasm*."}
{"text":"very cheap Japanese cuisine!There are two types of lunch menu and we chose the thinner one-buffet which can make us feel full!Tasty!"}
{"text":"Let's be clear, this isn't a top internationally known Sushi house where the best style and cuts of fish flown in are present. This is a great place to enjoy a traditional sushi meal with a lot of fully cooked options,  for your scared dinner friends. I came with my little kids, 8,5,3 and they couldn't have cared less with the loudness or the challenges we faced. So family friendly. I enjoyed my meal and all the options afforded. Be prepared to line up, or arrive early. This place is busy. Meals come fast, and it's nice to have food cooked to order, instead of a buffet where stuff sits around. 
I'll be back."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I can remember as it used to be one of the best AYCE places despite it being a journey from my place. For a while their menu changed and quality was disappointing (I think their manager Alex who is amazing opened up his own store and was preoccupied with that) but now their sashimi quality has improved by a lot. Sushi is still great and not stuffed with rice, I love that their serve scallop & amaebi sashimi and both of them just melt in your mouth. Overall, their food is starting to improve back to how they were originally were and using iPads makes service a lot quicker now."}
{"text":"The food was good and fresh but it was too slow. End up we complained to the manager and he gave us a big boat. Thank you!"}
{"text":"We are sushi sashimi lovers. When we went here the saba sashimi has bones. We complained about it, the waiter said i dont know and sorry. We tried to order again but still they gave us again with bones."}
{"text":"The first time I came to this restaurant, I dined in the \"normal table area\" with my girlfriend. I didn't see the cooking tables because it was closed off the time before.

This time while making a reservation, I was offered the \"cooking table\". Wasn't sure what this meant, so I asked the staff member and she said the chef literally cooks right in front of you! I went for this option and it was well worth it. There's a slight charge to upgrade and if you're just looking to fill up then this isn't the route for you. But if you're looking for a fun dining experience, this is definitely it.

The service was amazing, everyone was on top of their game and was pretty quick. Except when we ordered alcohol, they were really slow. I got a warm beer, not even chilled - warm.

Overall, this was an amazing experience again! And I would definitely return.

4.5/5"}
{"text":"Cheap lunch specials at a big/modern venue. The food was great for the price point and they offered some different options as compared to the usually limited bento/maki options."}
{"text":"I've been a Ten-Ichi loyalist for almost a decade. What I love about them is the consistancy. Never have I left the place unsatisfied. The manager, Alex I believe his name is, amazing host and always takes good care of us. I'd say Ten-Ichi is the best AYCE in town, I know a lot of people who drive over from Thornhill and Mississauga to have a great AYCE experiance here. The foods amazing, the few extra bucks you pay here really guarantees you great quality food. Great Friday Night jaunt after work! Pay cash and you get a 10% discount, can't go wrong."}
{"text":"One of my top favourite AYCE Jap sushi restaurant. Very good food & service. Used to go here all the time & often. You can ask to pay cash & they give you 10% off bill. Food is consistent, fresh & good. Try their mango salmon rolls which is my favourite sushi roll there. Would come back again & again. Had many Bday parties here too :). Call them in advance to book reservations to avoid line ups & long wait :)"}
{"text":"great service, great lunch menu.  they are now in a new place next doors.  it's bigger now and more spacious, not so cramped.  decor is modern.  waiting staff are great.  courteous and everywhere.  the food is of course freaking amazing.  i advise you to book a table ahead of times if you plan to go to this place at night.  book it.  this joint is one of the better sushi places in scarberia."}
{"text":"This place was packed even on a snowy Tuesday night at 8pm! For an AYCE place, it's pretty decent. Having said that, don't expect anything mind blowing in terms of food. What sets this place apart from others is the level of service and care.

The moment you are seated, waiters are eager to take your order. You don't necessarily have to specify pieces, just order what dishes you want. The waiters place your food gently and re-arrange if necessary to fit on the table. They'll also be attentive and take your dirty/empty plates away and ask if you have everything you need. 

In terms of food, here's what we liked and didn't like. 

LIKED: salmon and surf clam (Hokkaido) sashimi, shrimp and sweet potato tempura, kalbi beef ribs, red dragon maki, salt and pepper pork cheek, mango yogurt, tiramisu, ice cream (green tea, mango, coconut)

DIDN'T LIKE: salmon carpaccio (fishy and this wasn't thinly sliced), sirloin steak chunks (was bland), Thai satay chicken skewers (was like popcorn chicken but with peanut sauce on it - just didn't go together), escargot with garlic mashed potatoes, ten ichi hand roll (so plain), pumpkin and taro chip tempura (not sweet). 

FYI they have a mandatory gratuity on all tables but it's only 10%!"}
{"text":"Today, my perpetual hunger has led me to Ten ichi -- an AYCE Japanese restaurant situated in a strip mall yonder of Scarborough. I reviewed Ten Ichi years ago, and I've finally decided to write an update. I still have vivid memories of eating at this restaurant as a wee lad. My constant sushi addiction, coupled with my unyielding ability to contain my hunger, amounted up to a few dozen visits at this restaurant. This review update will examine the positives and negatives of Ten Ichi; and provide a personal recommendation based on my dining experience.

On a cold, frosty night, when the stars were bright, and street lamps lit the city roads, we drove and finally arrived at Ten Ichi. The main entrance -- although small and narrow -- was packed with people awaiting a table. Fortunately we made a reservation the previous night -- but still waited for a substantial amount of time. The host was a scrawny man, who wore a casual suit, with amiable personality, and an countenance that always seemed happy. He politely apologized to us for the wait, and reassured that the food will be worth our patience. He then proceeded to announce 15 new items on the menu, which seemed exciting. 

After waiting for several odd minutes, the host finally lead us to our table. The waiter, a scrawny man with glasses, fitted with an apron approached our table. The waiter was seemingly well-mannered, and would often check on our table to politely ask us \"If all our food arrived in a timely fashion.\" However, the waiter was forgetful at times, although this is a flaw that can be overlooked.

The restaurant was softly carpeted, furnished with stylish chairs and dark brown painted walls. The room was lit with dim lights over each table, adorned with several pot lights on the ceiling. The restaurant presents itself as fine dining, with a casual feel. The theme mixed the Asian/Japanese culture with a contemporary, modern feel, combing the best of both into one. The decor foreshadowed the menu and gave us a foretaste of what food we should expect.

On the side, green tea was served throughout the meal. The piping hot cup of tea began our dinner perfectly, that warmed our stomachs, hearts, and hands. The tea tasted herbal, but sweet enough for any non-tea drinkers. 

Compliments of the host, we were given a sushi boat filled with maki-rolls and raw sashimi. The boat consisted of raw salmon, cooked salmon maki, mango maki, squid sashimi, shrimp, egg, and much more. The host also gave each of us a sweet ice cold drink. The drink was mixed with a sweet liquid at the top, sprite in the middle, red sugar water at the utmost bottom. Once mixed together, I experienced orgasms within my mouth unlike any other. 

I ardently perused the menu, searching for items that aroused happiness and great flavors in my mouth. The menu -- which was stylish well designed -- mostly consisted of raw sashimi and maki-hand rolls. The latter snatched my attention with authority; the California rolls seemed most enticing. The menu also contained steaks and grilled beefs from the teppanyaki grill. My first round of orders consisted of sushi, maki rolls, noodle soup, and kim-chi seafood hot pot soup. 

As our stomachs growled with joy in anticipation of the food, the first few sushi dishes and the kim-chi seafood hot pot soup finally arrived at our table. As each dish was slowly placed onto the table, my hunger could no longer debar itself from devouring in. 

The kim-chi seafood hot pot soup was absolutely delicious. The spiciness of the broth was a wee bit too spicy, for my preference. However, the fresh ingredients -- clams, mussels, cabbage, and many more -- all worked together harmoniously.

Using my chopsticks, I grabbed my first piece of maki roll. After swallowing my first bite, my countenance expressed signs of abundant satisfaction and joy. The sushi was firmly wrapped around together firmly with a perfect balance of rice and seaweed (and other ingredients); all of which complimented well together. Each bite, filled of wasabi and soy sauce, ignited my mouth with savory flavors. The rice was perfectly cooked, with a bite texture that was smooth and soft, but not soggy. The seaweed tasted nice and crispy.

The grilled beefs and steaks arrived next on our table -- elegantly and aesthetically beautiful. The meat was tender, with a soft texture on the inside. The beef skewers, which were my favorite, was marinated amazingly, as the meat absorbed all of the flavors. 

The only negatives that hindered the score of Ten-Ichi are the wait times and the narrow and dense space. Our food would arrive late, or not at all. Our table was also small and was hard to maneuver around. Great food, yet great disappointments. 

Although my experience was not perfect, Ten Ichi was a dining experience worth remembering. If your hunger is unyielding, and you are compelled to eat some savory Japanese/Asian cuisine, visit Ten Ichi.  I reckon you ought to be satisfied with what you find."}
{"text":"Me and my buddies would always go here for the exam afterparty. The food is really good and so was the service. I remember the waiter/waitress came in and out of our private room to see if we needed anything else. 

Pros
- Good food and service
- Gave us a private room even though we didn't specify for one
- Excellent sashimi and ramen
- Dessert sizes were perfect (Some places serve very tiny tiny portions)

Cons
- Always packed in evenings so reserve
- Order as soon as everyone seated (Check their website for the menu if you want to be ready to order when you get there)"}
{"text":"While the food is good the service is awful! We had go wait almost half an hour after out reservation time. The food came out fast at the begining but they forgot a lot of things and made no mention to let us know they didnt have specific things. Whenever we tried to flag someone down for a glass of water or anything the staff seemed incredibly annoyed.  While the website said they closed at 11 we were given our bill at 9pm and told it was last call and we needed to pay now. There was a 12% gratuity charge which was really annoying for a group of 3 and the waitress kept giving us weird totals. We were felt really rushed and it did not make for a great experience. For the insane price and awful service i doubt my friends or i will return."}
{"text":"My mother and I were out at Ten-Ichi for dinner a while ago. There were some good and mediocre parts. My mom said the flounder was excellent, and the sushi I had was good. Problem is, with a lot of AYCE places, much of their menus feature the same stuff. This one has a particularly limited menu. Not the best AYCE, but not the worst AYCE."}
{"text":"Always full of house. Especially weekends. The food is above average compare to other all u can eat buffet. Service is good too. Been there many times for birthdays. 10% off for birthday dinner."}
{"text":"Ten Ichi is a Scarborough institution. One of the first AYCE sushi restaurants in the area and still surviving.

The sushi choices are not creative or extensive, but they have all the maki, sushi, tempura, udon and grilled meat staples. Don't expect to be blown away by the selection, they keep to the basics but they deliver on what they do have. I came for a party and our 100+ group descended upon them for a Sat lunch. Hats off to the staff who stayed friendly, helpful and followed up on orders despite the chaos. The food was not that interesting (I was struggling to find variety by the end of the meal), but the service earns them an extra star."}
{"text":"Tenichi is known for its all you can eat. That can be a good or bad thing.

Good: okay, obviously you just order whatever you want and get seconds without thinking about paying extra.

People are generally friendly there.

They will get you your first order really quickly.

Variety (if you go infrequently), is good.

Bad: the quality is inconsistent. They also always ask first if you want a boat (filled with sushi and sashimi but also full of rice to stuff you), and the quality of the sashimi is really hit or miss, usually miss. The salmon, for example, can have this mushy consistency and the white tuna doesn't have the fresh flavor to it.

The wait for your food, once you've ordered round 1, is long. Makes sense, since they presumably want to delay you.

Dessert sizes are tiny. When I went with friends they ordered 20, just because they knew how small each one was lol.

Overall: acceptable sushi. I think this is a place you go to once in a while. Super pumped when you're ready for ayce sushi, and afterwards thinking you'd never do it again."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since a very young age and it's still one of my most favourite AYCE sushi restaurants. They tend to be very busy on weekends and sometimes week nights but the manager does his best to make the wait as short and as worthwhile as possible."}
{"text":"My husband and I come here most anniversaries, birthdays, paydays when i forget to cook, and pretty much every excuse to eat Japanese. Our go to place FOR YEARS (more than 10!) since we started dating. 

Teppanyaki table is our favorite. Call ahead if you want a spot and dont like to wait. And look for Aaron the chef. He is our current favorite :)"}
{"text":"sashimi is fresh, i like the that they have scallop sashimi. everything else is OK. they also add mandatory tip even for two people. not that its a problem but i dont like the fact that they 'force' it upon you."}
{"text":"Struggled to decide whether to give this place a 3 or 4 star rating. In terms of overall pleasantness of the servers and hosts, I'd give this place pretty close to a 5/5. It's not fine dining quality service, but regardless of that, everyone is quite pleasant to deal with. The service falls short though when ordering, because for whatever reason, they never quite give you everything that you order. What is up with that? They do something dumb like make their portions of seaweed salad minuscule, so when you try to order 2 orders for every person at the table, they only give you a fraction of what you ask for? Frustrating. THREE times we tried to ask for multiple orders of the chilled tofu (since dumbly enough each order is literally one slice of tofu) and EACH time they only gave us two. And this is ultimately why I decided to give them the lower rating.

The variety of the menu is also where this place shines. There aren't too many AYCE places, especially at this price point, where you'd be able to get some torched sushi. The sashimi was also decent, though not the best that I've had. Apart from that, the food quality is generally just OK. The dessert options had a few unique offerings, including the staple ginger milk (this isn't for everyone) and the ginger creme brulee. 

Overall, I wouldn't say I had a particularly negative experience here, but there was some major gripes that mired what otherwise would have been a decently positive experience."}
{"text":"Came here for Valentine's Day dinner with my bf, the service was suprisingly quick.  It was $25.95 per person (because it was a Friday), and we had reservations for 7 pm.  We were seated immediately and the waiter looked really busy but still kept a good attitude despite all the extra demand.  

I found that many of the items offered on the menu were similar to Matsuda (where they have incredibly bad service), but I didn't really notice much aside from the desserts.  I don't remember sushi and sashimi off by heart 

My bf ordered most of the food, but he got slightly sick after eating some of the salmon sashimi because it tasted off.  I absolutely LOVED the roses maki, it was probably my favourite maki roll we ordered.  The handrolls and sirloin steak were pretty nice.  We also had the seafood ramen & beef ramen, which we didn't like much since it closely tasted like some sort of instant ramen. 

Since I keep a separate stomach for dessert, I ordered a lot..particularly the icecream.  The mango yogurt had a really watery consistency, so I didn't finish it.  The mango yogurts I've had in the past are more like pudding.  They have a bigger variety of icecream than Matsuda, but I still stuck to the typical green tea and mango icecream.  I really wanted to try the strawberry creme fraiche but they didn't have it, unfortunately.  

I suggest going early and making a reservation.  When we left at around 8:30, the entrance lineup was really long!"}
{"text":"Out of words for the restaurant. Waited for almost 30 minutes for the table, no one takes our names down or assign a number to us. There were about 16 people waiting at the door, all wondering where the heck is the host. After a long wait, he comes and asks \"all the groups of 2 follow me!\" And lead us to the table with the previous diner's leftover.  Won't come again."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I tried this place out of curiosity. It was always so full so we wanted to know what the hype was all about. The problem we had was it was just a terrible dining experience. The tables where so close together I felt cramped in, uncomfortable. The place was so full that it was too loud to have a decent conversation. It was the worst dining experience I ever had. We ended up cutting our dinner short while out orders kept coming. We paid for the meal and left.
The sushi was not terrible. The selection is not as large compared to other AYCE places. They do however have a wider selection when it comes to non sushi food. But if I am going to a an all you can eat sushi place I want a large selection of sushi, maki and sashimi to choose from. 
For the price they were asking it just was not worth it. There are far better AYCE places out there, that offer better sushi, better sushi selection, better ambiance and a better price. I don't understand the hype of this place at all. Definitely not coming back."}
{"text":"It was a last minute decision to try out Ten-ichi as we were craving sushi.  Walked in without a reservation on a Thursday night and was seated almost right away at a crammed table.  

The server was attentive and came by frequently to take our orders.  We tried most of the sushi and sashimi offerings and the quality of the fish was sadly lacking.  The red snapper was dried out, scallop was ok but not the freshest I've had, the squid was decent, and the rest was as expected at an AYCE.  

However, I did enjoy their chawanmushi and the mango ice cream.  Other items we ordered were all hit and miss (beef tataki, grilled fish, grilled eggplant, tempura...etc) and nothing to write home about.  

I guess you can't really expect excellence at an AYCE place.  Will I be back here for a sushi craving?  Not likely."}
{"text":"Best sushi place ever in Scarborough area. Staff is slow in bringing food to the table and even in forgetting some orders at times. But it makes up in the quality of food. Love herb salmon. Expensive but worth it. Love it. Restaurant is always busy, so the staff always try to rush u to leave after they have served you."}
{"text":"We came to Ten Ichi last year but never made it inside the dining area. 
Reason: we had no reservation and the restaurant was packed. We passed by this restaurant while we were driving around the area and decided to try it out. But unfortunately, we tried to wait to be seated but we got tired of waiting. We eventually left and did not come back until now.
Since it was a bit of a drive from where we live, we made sure to check the reviews regarding this restaurant... and of course, made the reservation:))
Food: We started with the sashimi. Everything was amazing and fresh. I never had so much scallops before and no one from the staff said i cannot have anymore.. unlike at Spring Rolls:(..they'd stop giving you scallops if they think you ordered too much.. poor way to establish customer satisfaction in my opinion. Ten Ichi has new items in their dinner menu which we tried. We were really satisfied. ( I usually would take photos of the food and post them here but I got excited to eat and forgot ). 
Service: We were worried at first because they dont use the IPAD ordering system. Based on some reviews, some food tend to not be served because the staff either forgets to give your order to the kitchen or they mix up people's orders. However, none of these happened to us. We were taken good care of, food came to our table in the right temperature as it should be. We did not notice any sour- faced staff and all of them were courteous.
Price: Paid around $70 for two for the regular weekday dinner buffet. This included the 12% tip. Not bad for some really nice items i had been craving for esp. the scallops and the takoyaki.

We will go back  and try the weekend dinner buffet..  they should have the sweet shrimp then."}
{"text":"I came here again last night to try to the teppanyaki, and it was definitely worth it! Was the chef the most engaging? Not really, compared to other teppanyaki places, but he was polite and the food was cooked well. 

For the first round, the chef cooked all of the items on the menu: tiger shrimp, beef ribs, flounder, salmon, garlic clams and chicken teriyaki. I didn't enjoy the flounder, for it tasted bland and wasn't the freshest. I would say likewise for clams as well. Also, the steak was cooked more on the rare side than medium rare. However, everything else on the menu was definitely worth it! 

 For the second round, we ordered the beef ribs and shrimp as the were everyone's favourite. We were a little dissapointed that we didn't get to see the chef flambé the shrimp again, but the taste was still the same! 

We then ordered from the AYCE menu, but only half of our orders made it to the table without us reminding them more than once. However, the waitress was very polite and attentive. She came to check on us once in a while and asked if the food was okay. 

Overall, I would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Most rice I've seen in sushi..what a disappointment. Their price is increased and the quality of food is decreased."}
{"text":"I was recently at Takara Bune for some Japanese food but I was pretty disappointed that day and came here the very next day to get my Japanese food fix. I was much more pleased at Ten-ichi.

Just to compare with Takara Bune I got the same sashimi lunch special here which was around the same price at $11. You get more pieces of sashimi for about the same price. Plus one for Ten-ichi.

Also got the salmon teriyaki which came with rice, some sushi and deep fried scallops. Both meals came with miso soup and salad and a scoop of ice cream at the end. No ice cram at Takara Bune.

Heard the waitresses speak Cantonese so its not a true authentic Japanese experience but it does the job."}
{"text":"I don't know why people love this place so much. Came here 2 or 3 times and it was packed every time. The food are just standard , the places are too crowded and narrow, and they will tell u its last call when they don't want you to eat too much. Definitely not coming back"}
{"text":"The food and the service is not bad actually. We all enjoyed dinner there. When we asked for our bill, the guy told us that it would be $131.37(group of four). I paid $140 in cash. My friend asked me why it would be so pricey since weekday dinner is $25.99/pp. It should have been $117 something including tax. Then I asked the guy to bring us the bill, and he was kind of surprised but he brought us the bill and said that actually tips was already charged!!!!!! My friends are from Boston and I am from Thunder Bay, and we've never seen it before! The bill shows a suggested service charge 12%, and it is included in the total amount! We almost paid tips twice. That was so tricky! We actually wanted to pay more tips, but this left us such bad impression! Please be careful when u got the bill!!!!"}
{"text":"Had a great experience here, the host who greeted at the front was very friendly..we did not make a reservation but got a seat in less than two minutes. Waiters were  very kind and we did not have to wait for food at all! Food was amazing, spicy salmon and yakitori was my favourite! 
There fruit punch is to die for, best fruit punch I have ever had! Over all I had a great experience and would surely recommend it"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Japanese AYCE places. Why? Because the food is tasty and fresh. And their menu includes some items you might not find in other places such as steamed egg, salmon belly, tiramisu, kalbi, chicken wings, and ice cream waffles! I'm getting hungry just writing this review. I like to recommend going on a weeknight though because weekends get VERY packed. Even when I go on weeknights I have to wait. The restaurant is somewhat small relative to its popularity and can be a little bit loud. Don't expect ambiance but expect tasty food. The presentation of each order is fairly nice. The ordering of all the menu items is by pieces instead of servings so if you order one sashimi, you literally only get one slice. Which helps because sometimes when your belly has no more room but you absolutely need to have one more fried  banana, you can literally get one fried banana and leave a happy camper :)"}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday party of 30 people but the service was slow and it seemed like they had one waiter handling our party plus 8 other tables. Sometimes with All-You-Can-Eat (AYCE) sushi places you have less options or lower quality, but I think this one is probably one of the better ones. They also have a Teppanyaki option too

Staff: Friendly and greeted me. Seemed to have been accommodating for our large party and gave us three tables. I believe we were promised a room originally but because our party number kept increasing they gave us 3 large tables in the back. Unfortunately, as I previously mentioned, the service was slow. Staff takes the order, but they served our party one table at a time, in addition to other tables. So we were constantly trying to flag someone but we were always told to wait our turn, which would could take around 15 minutes, and that doesn't include the time of when the actual order would arrive. Often at times the serving staff would get confused as to which of our three tables had ordered the food so it was pretty hectic every time food came.

Ambience: The noise level is high, something that I don't find unusual for Asian cuisine establishments (e.g. sushi, dimsum, etc.). The seating was comfortable and there was ample lighting.

Food: Nothing really unique stands out. They do serve a nice sashimi boat and it's a big boat. Most of the items were very standard for a sushi place. What I did enjoy was that everything was available from rolls, to sashimi, so it wasn't a limited menu like some AYCE places.

I feel like if we were a smaller party it would've been less hectic for the staff. The food was reasonable for an AYCE and the place is comfortable. If you want to sample a wide variety/AYCE, I say it's not a bad place to try!"}
{"text":"For an AYCE sushi place, it's actually not bad.  But let me first start by saying that when I go to an AYCE place, I go in with no expectations other than the fact that I darn well expect my fish to be fresh and Ten Ichi definitely delivers that. 

The few times we've come and had reservations, we've still had to wait.  However, the manager there is pretty good with putting a huge boat of sashimi on your table as soon as you get seated.  

There are a huge variety of rolls and there also a good amount of sashimi as well.  Cooked goods are also plentiful.  

Desserts..hmm...that ginger milk thing is quite delicious.  A must try.  

All in all, again for AYCE standards, it's quite good and I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I didn't get sick!!!!!!!!!!!!!

FOOD
the food was delicious. I really liked that we got the choice of Teppanyaki and regular sushi type food.

I'm a sashimi fan and I was so glad I didn't get sick after eating all the salmon sashimi on the table!   My favourites were definitely the grilled shrimp and the the sashimi (salmon).

I was too full that I didn't have room for dessert!

PRICE
I think the price of $23 is average for an AYCE.  And if one doesn't get sick? I must be in heaven.


TRAFFIC
wow, this place was so busy. Lucky we made reservations. We were actually late for our reservation by a 1/2hr but they still managed to have a table for us. 

SERVICE
I thought the service was really fast and they brought everything we ordered.

Just writing this makes me want to go back!"}
{"text":"I will begin my review by saying this: Reserve beforehand. If you don't reserve, don't bother coming before 9pm, because you won't get a seat.

I've heard about Ten-Ichi several times from my friends, but never bothered coming here as there are better AYCE places around in terms of variety. However, after failing to get a reservation in New Years Eve for practically every establishment, my family settled for this place.

The reception area was very disorganized. There were too many people gathered in a general area, and regardless of whether you reserved or not you have to wait. Eventually we got a table, but our table was quite cramped for a table of 6...

First thing I noticed was the lack of sushi/sashimi variety, although they had some weekend specials such as aburi salmon, octopus, squid, etc. I will admit though, the fish is quite fresh.

Unfortunately, nothing else really stood out from the menu. Their miso soup was okay, but their lobster bisque wasn't even warm, let alone hot. Their beef tataki was decent, as well as their chawanmushi. Everything else was anywhere ranging from blah to meh.

Service wasn't the best, as the place was horribly understaffed for New Years Eve. The organization of the tables also made it difficult for servers to navigate, as some of the aisles were too tight.

Honestly, I don't see myself returning. It's a good place if this was 10 years ago, but AYCE places have changed and revolutionized in the GTA, and this place unfortunately hasn't adapted to it yet."}
{"text":"I was about to vote 5 stars.  But i will talk about that later. The first thing i like about it is that they have some stuffs that most sushi place do not have. For example like steam eggs, Mango sushi, Herbed Salmon, and some desserts etc..... Also the chicken popcorn they have is much better than most other places. The service is extremely fast. For example last time i went with my friends they just serve us a big boat of sashimi. And they gave to us right before we ordered. However the reason why i didn't vote 5 stars is because some selections are limited. And also some of the sections are only available on weekend only and some are available on weekdays only."}
{"text":"I say this place is better than the other ayce places, portions are smaller so it gives you a chance to simple the entire menu although I believe the menu selection is a bit smaller than other places, total for 2 adults on the weekend is $64, this ayce places are getting pricy everytime I go....I'd prefer the a la carte places

Btw the dessert selection kind of sucks compared to matsuda which has amazing dessert mousses"}
{"text":"5 star for the quality on the sushi, especially the salmon- fresh! Only the ginger milk, and store bought ice cream were good and worth the try. Sad that they ran out of a few others on a Saturday night!!! wish hey would have more variety sushi rolls. the kalbi was too soft and not enough grilled flavor

2 star for service. hard to find a waitress to take down our order (since it is an AYCE order style, no buffet line) especially we only have a 2 hour limit!!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed a lovely meal here with a friend back in January. 

Their sushi is delicious and fresh. I recommend the sushi with the mango! Nice refreshing combination! They also have excellent shrimp tempura. 

The overall presentation is also very nice and fancy, including the cold sake! Service is good but the waiters are very busy so you may need to flail your arms around a bit."}
{"text":"I went for my birthday  lunch here and it's awesome! Been there twice and they have a great atmosphere and ur able to enjoy urself to the fullest! A++++"}
{"text":"My family and I love this place! It's got such a nice setting and the food is Soo amazing! We love the authenticity of the food they serve! We've been to the place four times now and we venture for it, considering all the yummy singles they have. My family and I try to have everything but it's impossible considering the amount of food they have on their menu. But, the fried tofu, the eggplant tempura, the grilled eggplant, the spicy beef/seafood ramen, sushi, hand-rolls are amazing! My three year old lives and loves the unlimited ice cream. Going right at 5 for dinner is kinda busy but, definitely worth the chaos. The waiters/waitresses are great! The hostess is nice and the experience is top notch!"}
{"text":"walked in with reservation for the grill seat tables, for some reason they gave it to someone else...... they told my sister the grill tables were closed... when we could see it right in front of us open.... they then said to wait 30 mins which was more like 45 mins we finally got the grill table. .... that started the experience really bad...... once the food started cooking everything was fine... not sure if they giving our table was disrespectful purposely or just a mistake..."}
{"text":"First time here and I love it. We order using an iPad and our food came in like a minute. Amazing service. Food was so good. Their sashimi is one the best I've ever had. Their dinner menu has a lot of varieties. Their sushi comes in 3-4 rolls and that's so much better because that gives us a chance to order more stuff and not having to worry about not finishing. Weekday dinner price is $35 when you pay cash (they include tax and tips in their total). 

Bonus: You can get soft drinks at no extra cost."}
{"text":"We came at 1:30pm Sunday for lunch the hostess did not say a word not come for lunch cause we are closed cause they have to get ready for dinner.  I was so upset that they didn't say anything about it.. When we order the food right away they give us the bill while we are eating lunch that is very rude.  First of all we as customer will tell the waitress when we going to ask for bill not the waitress right away give the bill while we having lunch that is way off.  Once we finish our lunch I saw a bill come s to 67.00 and they add 6.00 for a tips. I was so upset about the tips they add on the bill.  Who in the world add tips on the bill while going any restaurant.  We the customer we decide how much we put on the tips not the restaurant give us a tip whenever they want to.

That was my worsen experience that I have.  I will never go back it again."}
{"text":"My friend told me tenichi switched owners and the food isn't as good but I thought I'd check it out myself. I made reservations and it was honoured so no problem with that. As for the food meh it was okay for all you can eat sushi. The server tried his best but we didn't get everything we ordered. It was disappointing to keep reminding him of what we ordered and for that reason not sure if I'll come back. The sushi was ok. I like the mango rolls one but everything else is average. The dessert was also just okay. Overall I think this restaurant has lost the quality that it used to have. It's sort of the \"Mandarin\" equivalent now for AYCE sushi."}
{"text":"I followed this place for several years now, and it honestly used to be my favourite all you can eat. The variety, the quality, the service was all up there - the only problem was that the lines were long and it was hard to walk-in without a reservation. Now, after they renovated and it expanded, the food quality is down a bit imo and it usually isn't a full house like before. The variety is still there, but the service also isn't as quick. I will be searching for a new fav ayce for uptown."}
{"text":"Ten-Ichi has been around for a long time in Scarborough and it always looks packed every time we come by so they must be doing something right.

Today we came for the AYCE lunch weekend menu and I have to say the quality for an AYCE is very impressive.  Its not as extensive as other places but the quality is there from the rolls, makis and skewers to the noodles, tempura and desserts, there's enough variety to satisfy most taste buds.

The staff is very nice but due to the old fashion ordering system of having the server taking orders manually and then inputting in the system really slows down everything and one has to constantly wave down an order taker as the servers don't do any ordering.  It would make sense if a tablet menu pad system gets implemented like most newer AYCE but then to each there own.  There were pretty accurate for most of our orders which is good.

I do recommend that you reserve ahead of time as there's only time for a single seating for lunch on weekends.  It opened at 12pm and last call is 2pm so if the place is full like today there wouldn't be any time for a second seating.

Overall really enjoyed the food here and wouldn't mind coming back to try the dinner menu which includes a teppanyaki option."}
{"text":"Wasn't the best customer service experience because.. Our RSVP for 18 people was 1 hour and 15 minutes late!! The manager was apologizing in the beginning during the first half hour or so, and then started avoided us all together.. At the end, we got a 10 percent discount, which really isn't much.. 

For $28/pp ayce on a weekend is not bad for what they have on their menu.  Their premium sashimi items which I was interested in were: scallops, octopus, squid, shrimp, escargot..."}
{"text":"Possibly one of the worst Japanese ayces of Toronto in terms of food quality and presentation. Aside from sashimi, everything else were borderline edible. 

My table bursted out laughing when the waitress put down our plate of escargot (just review my pictures and you will understand). Ten-ichi is the first \"Japanese\" restaurant I'd been to that doused my rolls in soy sauce as part of presentation - spicy mayo or eel sauce I get, but soy sauce is a big no no. In fact, a lot of grilled items were drenched in soy sauce too - So much to seasoning their foods. 

Service - our waitress was apologetic for the fact that most of our items were never served. But they need to work out the communication between the kitchen and table staffs - my husband's beef udon (ordered during our first 15 mins of seating were brought out after check was brought to the table and only after three reminders from our waitress). 

For once, I felt somewhat ripped off by an ayce. In addition to the missing/never served items, the poor/limited quality did not justify the cost. Save your money and have an enjoyable meal in a non-ayce. You would pay around the same or even less price for way better tasting/fresher foods."}
{"text":"This restaurant is usually so busy but luckily, we were able to get reservations for 2 at the teppanyaki table for dinner. The food was great. I love how the maki rolls were too big. We ordered a green dragon roll which came out as 3 pieces; perfect for an ayce place! 

The waiter was extremely kind and had no issues taking order from two very hungry girls who basically kept talking over each other to order. 

The teppanyaki chef was talented but didn't really preform a show of any sort. Perhaps this was because it was a Monday? Lol. But regardless, the teppanyaki food was delicious. 

I liked how the dessert waffle was just an ice cream scoop with a cookie waffle on top. Not too filling after eating so much but still something more than just a small scoop of ice cream that you would get at other ayce places."}
{"text":"This places has been around for a long time. A few things I notice is they are service friendly or at least try to be. The servers are trained to say \"enjoy!\" and even smile...wow! What a concept that's a rarity in many Asian restaurants such as this. They take notes the old fashion way and this took time from one table to the next. But everything came right which was impressive. 

The food was very good. The sushi was soft and at room temperature. I especially like the steak dish with garlic, white salmon sashimi was delicious. 

 Overall this place was a better than average experience. 

It's very busy so be sure to make a reservation and the earlier times will have you seated before the line up starts."}
{"text":"My friends and I went to this restaurant after hearing good things about it as well as seeing good reviews. It was not what I expected, there were very few selections for the lunch all you can eat which is surprising as most ayce has a decent menu more than 35 items. The quality of the food was not as good and could have been a lot better. We either didn't get the food that we ordered or we got someone else's order. For the price that we paid for lunch at such quality we could have a much better tasting dinner ayce around the same price elsewhere."}
{"text":"this place is always packed for dinner. selection is pretty good, food awesome. i'm not particularly big on buffets but this is pretty awesome relative to others.  though last time i went the sashimi was a hit and miss. we ordered three sets of 20 salmon sashimi, only the last set was melt in your mouth goodness. strange. anyhow, this is the go to buffet place other then prince sushi in mississauga. but again prince sushi is a hit and miss for me."}
{"text":"As a person who actually doesn't eat any raw fish, I can only offer my experience on the other dishes.  (Though I've constantly been told that this place has the best fish around)

The maki rolls were all nicely put together.  I love that they don't overload the rice like Yang's Kitchen does to prematurely stuff you.  My favorite was definitely the Rose maki which is an avocado roll with mango sauce on top.

The restaurant is notoriously busy on the weekends and you must come prepared with reservations otherwise you could wait for a very long time.  As busy as the place gets though, their service is fairly good for an AYCE and they do a good job of remembering your orders.

Things to try:
-  jumbo grilled shrimp
-  rose maki
-  ten-ichi mango yogurt
-  sirloin steak
-  avocado salad
-  beef sashimi"}
{"text":"The selection and food quality definitely deserves a 5 star, but there are two reasons why I am giving them a 3 star. Reservations and customer service. I would always make reservations hours beforehand (at least 5,6 hours) for a party of 2-6 and they would say that a table will be ready. And everytime when we arrive, the front door will be so crowded that the front desk guy will tell me to wait while he takes more reservations from the crowd. Waiting is fine, but it usually ends up being a 15-30 min wait with plenty of follow ups to make sure they dont forget about our party, which is unreasonable. 
Customer service is awful. If you order 10 pieces of salmon, they give you 5. If you order round 3 or above, expect your food to come in 20 minutes...and if you order more than 5 items, be prepared that couple of your food will never end up showing."}
{"text":"All you can eat with quick and efficient service.  Never mind the staff is awesome too... Another 2 thumbs up for this staff satisfied eatter.  I always leave here full and satisfied.  Too bad I have to go to the gym to keep my weight down after a eatting too much...small price to pay :-)"}
{"text":"Great value for AYCE. Huge selection of food and desserts. Try the ginger milk if you go on the weekend!"}
{"text":"Sushi buffets aren't exactly my nowadays go-to places since I'm more of a person who enjoys a la carte and as I grow older in age, I simply don't have the capacity to tackle on large quantities of food.  So by nature, my expectations on freshness and overall impression of sushi obviously isn't as high as if I were going to a regular restaurant.

Anyway, friends that I know, gave a bit of hype regarding this place and I figured that I would give this place a try with some friends to celebrate my friend's birthday. 

Overall, this place just doesn't cut it on several levels and I could visibly see it in my friends' facial expressions (pretty much sharing my same sentiment).  So here's the breakdown...

Decor: 
It's nice, nothing too flashy, although it does look like there's a slight wear and tear in the overall setting (primarily the flooring) that looks slightly runned down in patches.  I'm guessing that with the high amount of traffic and business this place generates, that it can't be bothered to fix/spruce up the certain areas to keep the place pristine.

Food: 
Food overall is either a hit or a miss.  There's clearly items that they excel well on and others that need massive amount of improvements.  I would like to address that during this Lunch Buffet that I attended that there were several items on the menu there were not available and were not communicated to us until after we ordered the items.  While this pertains more to service, I will comment that the servers addressing the unavailable items wasn't handled the greatest as they offered up no apologies and meekly just stated the obvious.

Food, as mentioned, is a hit or miss.  A lot of good tasty stuff that me and my friends thoroughly enjoyed were mostly the fried stuff.  Notably the gyozas, wasabi spring rolls, chicken teriyaki, and their maki rolls.  What wasn't so good leaned more to their nigiri sushi.  The salmon on its respective nigiri was a very VERY pale orange with its skin (or what appear to be the closest to its skin).  While the salmon was ok and passable, the colour was off-putting that we didn't opt for a 2nd order of it.  This is moore of a service issue, but we noticed that every order we put down, all the fried stuff would come first and we felt rather jipped that we were being filled with fried stuff as opposed to other stuff we ordered.

Service:  This is just where the place takes a downhill plunge and honestly me and my friends vowed to not come back again.  While it was easy to flag down a server about our food and stuff, we would constantly be asking where parts of our order would be.  We had put down an order of Steak Teriyaki and we were told TWICE by servers that it would be \"coming\" and then when it didn't come, we put it down on our order sheet hoping that it would come.  I actually had to physically communicate to the server on our 3rd order sheet, \"Can you ensure that we get the steak teriyaki on this order?\".  Server gave me a meek smile, flags down the main server and said \"Is there anything else you want to make sure that the order goes through?\"  I couldn't tell if he was sarcastic or not, but I was really surprised how unapologetic these guys were.  I'm getting the impression that their organization of how they place our orders is rather unorganized because yes, we were missing orders.  

If this place is as good as my friends put it out to be, I'd strongly suggest that the business takes a minute to reflect and iron out any operations and procedures that produces painpoints for the customer."}
{"text":"The staff rushes you out.. I am an individual that likes to enjoy their meal.. Management should expand their restaurant to decrease wait time.. I haven't gone here for over 2 years bc I hate rushing out and the LONG WAIT TIME of standing there with many different families. The owner is nice though and gives VIP discounts."}
{"text":"The food is average comparing to other ayce places jn toronto but the service is pretty decent . I would come back if i ever were in Scarborough and were craving sushi like tonight"}
{"text":"Ten-Ichi was the location my group of 4 decided on for dinner one Friday night. I was previously reluctant to try it as the high price tag for AYCE was a little off-putting. I never have my fill in AYCE places and with tax and tip at Ten-Ichi, a meal could easily run to $30+, which just didn't seem worth it for the little amount I would eat. One friend of mine was continuously hyping this place up and I finally gave in and decided to see what the big deal was. 
We arrived maybe a little more than two hours before closing (our mistake, but damn this place closes early). After fast deliberation, we ordered a lengthy list from the menu. After quite a long wait, the food finally arrived. We ordered the steak cubes cooked in sake and butter, chicken skewers, mango sushi, spicy salmon sushi and other assorted sushi. I liked the skewers and the spicy salmon sushi the most.
Some parts of our order never came and the same thing happened when we ordered a second round. Service wasn't good at all and the waitress was basically invisible. I was quite disappointed but after the second round, no one was especially enthusiastic about the food so we asked for dessert. Apparently, their freezer was having problems and one flavour of ice cream was unavailable because it was all melted (lol ok). The only available flavours were ones that my dining companions did not like so we only went for one round of dessert. The \"waffle and ice cream\" on the menu was deceiving as the accompanying waffle was more cookie-esque.
Overall, this dining experience was a let down and I'm definitely disappointed."}
{"text":"The food is good..  But the servers are unfriendly and will kick you out asap.  They will announce last call and still get the order wrong.  Either you order two orders and get one.  Or you order one and get two.  Order too many of one thing and they decide to stop giving you more even though, you only want that. lol  They need to get servers like the manager Alex.  He is always very friendly.  I wish the servers who take your orders were that friendly."}
{"text":"I found this place before it got super popular. Now it's hard to get in without a reservation, but the food is very affordable and has a wide variety of Japanese food. I also like that you can choose to eat both all you can eat sushi AND teppanyaki. Pretty awesome. 

The Roses Maki sushi is TO DIE FOR. It's gotta be the only reason why I keep returning there! Oh! and the little chocolate mousse dessert. yummmm!

The atmosphere is nice as well, and it's best if you go there when it opens at 12:30 so you don't need a reservation and you don't have to wait.

BUT I've had more more fresh sushi in other places."}
{"text":"Theres specials that you can order together with the ayce. Pretty unique that way. Sushis were good rAtio. Sashimi were good too! Will come back again! Tepanyaki gives it another cool feature. Make a reso they get busy! Good place size though"}
{"text":"I love this sushi place in scarborough 
Their sashimis are really fresh 
Love that their rolls are 3 pcs instead of 6-8 so you can try different ones and not stuff yourself like other places 
Their service is quick and friendly
Usually Really full /busy so you probably do need reservations ahead of time"}
{"text":"Possibly my all-time favourite japanese ayce. A little pricey (adult $23.95 mon-thurs, $25.95 fri-sun) but definitely worth it. 
Mango lovers must try the roses maki: maki roll topped with avocado, mango drizzle and some fish eggs. Mango desserts are delightful too - mango yogurt and mango ice cream.
My man's favourites are from the robata grill. Sizzling sirloin steak are little cubes cooked to medium-rare with slices of garlic. Great quality. As well as the beef ribs.
Salmon sashimi here is amazing too. You can really taste the quality - goes down like butter.
They renovated maybe a year ago now (2011/2012) and the decor is very contemporary. Modern lighting and a relocation of the front door makes the restaurant feel bigger and it does indeed seat more.
Most of the servers speak great English and the crowd tends to be multicultural but does lean to the Asian side.

Overall, great, fast service, classy décor, and quality food.

Tip: It got very busy around 7pm on a Thursday night, there were 10 people waiting to be seated! I suggest always reserving and if possible, eat an early dinner. We got there just before 6 and waited less than 10 minutes for our first round of food."}
{"text":"Ten-Ichi was my very first sushi/sashimi experience that coincided with a \"first date\" of sorts. My companion was a regular of the place and I was rather thankful for his knowledge because I wouldn't have had a CLUE how things worked. He gave me some good tips about places like this (and specifically this place) - keep in mind that I'm a noob:

First of all, he made a reservation in advance to have us sit at one of the tables with the flat top grill built into them ($2/person extra cost I think). His reasoning was that the food would be hotter and fresher and he was definitely right about that. More about that later. But a reservation is probably necessary regardless.

Secondly, I had no idea that at an AYCE place like this, you have to pay for whatever you don't eat. Good to know if you're not familiar with these place. My companion ordered a LOT of food and since I don't eat piles of food, we had lots of leftover. The resulting bill was around $75!

Thirdly, my companion advised me that you're best off to order everything at once if you know what you want, or at least order in large batches. The people that sat beside us had to wait much longer for their food than we did and he told me that was part of the trick of ordering. Even with lots of food coming at the same time, it was still well paced and worked out.

Onto the food - I don't think I've ever had this good of an experience with a type of dining experience such as this. While I felt much like a fish out of water, the food was absolutely excellent. 

The sashimi was melt-in-your-mouth good, fresh, cold and absolutely YUMMY. I tried the salmon and the white tuna and they were both excellent - the white tuna was incredible actually! I can't remember everything we had, because there was SO much, but some of the dishes that I recall trying include the salmon roses (not my favourite but yum), the Roses Maki were delicious and the edamame were a delicious little side dish that I munched on throughout the entire meal. We also had a number of things off the grill, including chicken teriyaki (good but not something i'd order again), korean kalbi (good as well, wouldn't order again), grilled mushrooms (odd... not sure about those) and grilled flounder which was AMAZING. The desserts were yummy too - but very tiny in little egg cups. I would get more than one of those next time.

Overall, great service and great food. I was rather pleasantly surprised and hope to go back in the future!"}
{"text":"I thought the food here was good. Some dishes were better than others. I liked the beef skewers and the steak. The green dragon maki I tried was okay. A bit sloppy in construction.  I liked the fried banana for dessert. I also liked that we could order the food on a tablet instead of a menu. 

I came here for a family birthday party and while the restaurant looked decent the bathrooms were kind of run down. One stall in the ladies room was out of order. I think this place needs a refresh or a mild renovation. The teppanyaki tables at the back looked okay but no one was using them on a Monday afternoon. They probably only use them in the evenings when there are enough bookings. 

I thought the service was decent despite the largeness of our group. Our group had people ranging in age from 2 y.o. to 80 y.o. And we were a large group too. At least 80 people. It can get a little cramped in the restaurant with so many people.

I wouldn't come to this location normally because it's actually far from my neighbourhood. I only came here for our family event. Perhaps the food wasn't as great as other people have reviewed because they were rushing trying to churn out so many dishes for our large group. Kids were screaming really loud at one point and even I had to cover my ears. I will give them kudos for not losing their cool with us."}
{"text":"Great Selection and good for a Buffet style restaurant.  I'm not crazy about buffets, but I would say that it is a really good all you eat place.  For roughly 30 a person, you can get a better meal for 30 or less in Toronto.  But if you can eat a lot, this is a great place for you.  

Food:  7 out of 10
All you can eat: 10 out of 10 (Large selection)
atmosphere:  5 out of 10 

I would recommend this place for first-timers trying Japanese food."}
{"text":"Been there more than a handful of times in the past six months.  Love their dinner selection with the sashimi boat, squid sushi, octopus sashimi, pork cheek and escargots...too many to name.  10% discount if you pay with cash.  Be warm, seating can be snug at times so definitely make a resie if you plan to go with a party bigger than 4 ppl.  We have ONLY had the sushi AYCE, and have yet to try the teppanyaki...but then again, I am not sure AYCE place is where one would receive the best teppanyaki experience. 
Located in the same plaza as the Tim Hortons...parking is not abundant either..."}
{"text":"We decided to go for AYCE dinner on a Thursday night around 6:30PM.

Didn't have a problem getting seated, but the restaurant was packed. Alex, the host during dinner is awesome. He's always looking out for the guests. One time we waited for a table for 5 minutes and he had requested a sashimi not the minute we got our seats. Great customer service. 

I felt I had to update my review since my last visit left a sour note. 

The service tonight was flawless, with the waitresses even letting us know about the new menu items to try out. She gave us recommendations and was really fast at taking our order. 

We were in and out within an hour. 

The kitchen did amazing, everything tasted delicious and most importantly came out hot!

Try the salmon oshizushi. Their version of a blowtorched/pressed salmon... which seems to be all the rage these days.

I find the service to be better during dinner, instead of all you can eat during lunch."}
{"text":"points forts:  bon service, commande exécutée relativement dans son entièreté sans oubli

Par contre.... Les sushis et même les plats de cuisine ne m'ont pas plu. Bien que les sushis étaient relativement corrects, les makis avaient un arrière goût désagréable en plus d'avoir trop de tout et pas assez de poisson. Nous avons donc pris des plats de cuisine, 
ce qui n'a pas été plus fameux!! 

c'est le pire all you can eat sushi que j'ai essayé ..."}
{"text":"I've been to tenichi many times the past few years and I've decided that the best time to come here is on weekends. Their weekdays are of course quieter (but still busy) and cheaper but they also don't have as many special-weekend-only choices which makes their weekday menu pretty average. 

But their weekend menu is GREAT! Their sashimi was very fresh, they have sweet shrimp, they have this ginger milk dessert that I only got one little cup of because they ran out so quickly!!! Their desserts are really good especially the mango yogurt and fried banana to go along with ice cream. 

I went recently on a holiday and though the place was packed I found that the service was still really good. The servers were very respectful and would apologize for being slow/if they forgot something."}
{"text":"I came here 5 years ago every two weeks and it was one of the best AYCE place ever. The manager was extremely friendly, and we even received a VIP card (15% discount) as a result. However, we stopped going there after we moved places because it was too far. Now, after moving back closer, we've visited this place twice and been very disappointed. This place has drastically changed in a negative way after the renovation. 

Food: Mediocre. Sometimes the fish weren't fresh, the sauce wasn't right on the green dragon roll, the clams had grit, etc. 

Time: It took a long time for everything to come to the table. Orders were lost and forgotten. 

Waiters/waitresses: they were fine - nice but flustered 24/7 because of the constant order mishaps. 

Price: it's actually very pricey for the quality of food you get. I would not recommend going here with a larger group of people as it will definitely be a frustrating experience of trying to get what everybody wants on the table."}
{"text":"Was expecting great things from this place but I got utterly disappointed. I we on Good Friday, and the place was packed. We finally got a seat at a plastic table, like the ones they would at Costco. Which I didn't mind cause they where busy. But when we where ordering I found it odd that you have to tell the waiter what you want instead of writing it down or using an iPad/Tablet.

The food that came was decent, took awhile to come but tasted okay. One of the biggest things that annoyed me was half the food we ordered didn't come. We tried to order 40 pieces of salmon sashimi but only 8 came... we the. Tried to order another 30 but this time 10 came. This was very frustrating especially since it took awhile for everything to come. Lastly since it was a holiday it costed us almost $40 a person. Will I go back probably not but I do want to know why this place is rated 4 stars! Also would not recommend coming on a holiday or if you do go reserve a table in advance!"}
{"text":"Decent food.. but really bad service team. Waiters are very forgetful, and dishonest. I've lost my phone here during closing time, left it on the table and I'm pretty sure the girl that cleaned up my table took it because there were no other customers dining as i and my guest were the last to finish up. Food is okay, not bad, but i've had better.  It is pretty overpriced here.. No debit allowed which is so dumb considering the fact that this place is always jammed packed with people eating or waiting to be seated, which makes it not conveinent at all. Wait time is ridiculous.. And by the way when you order something and they DON'T have it, and you keep thinking they forget they say they're going to \"check\" like 5 times and come back with nothing. This happened to be a lot of times so instead of asking that one waitress that was \"my server\" i asked another, and he told me they had ran out for the day (miso soup).... Like couldn't she have told me that after i've asked countless times? Stupid... Like wow you're so helpful. What is your purpose working there anyway. Im not sure if there is a difference in making rsvp or not, because every time i dine here i rsvp and arrive at least 5 minutes early which is normal for parking or whatever, but still end up waiting 15-30 minutes more because their time management is poor. I dined here a few times, and probably will end up coming back in the future even though the service is bad."}
{"text":"I celebrated a birthday here yesterday for my little brother - it was a Friday night, and our reservation was for 7:30PM. We were seated immediately, and the environment was busy and buzzing. We ordered off an iPad, and the food came promptly. 

The portion sizes were very small (example: 1 order of mayo tempura shrimp was literally 1 shrimp)- but this was not a problem, as you could order as many as you'd like (so we would just click 5 or 6 portions of each thing we wanted a lot of!) Bottomless soda was also free, so I enjoyed a couple of ginger ales.

The food was hit or miss. Some of it was absolutely delicious! Very fresh California rolls, salmon rolls, cucumber rolls - the very simple rolls were quite good and enjoyable. The Japanese hashbrown was a favourite of my 12 year old brother - it is very yummy in a guilty pleasure kind of way. The tempura was really good, the mayo shrimp was my favourite by far. However, some of the food was not good at all. The sashimi didn't seem very fresh and some of the rolls were a definite miss, hard and old tasting rice and a little \"fishy\" tasting. Definitely go SIMPLE here, and you will be satisfied. 

The dessert at the end was average. The green tea and sesame ice cream is my favourite choice.The chocolate mousse, tiramisu and creme brûlée is below average and a super small portion size. 

The service was good. Prompt and friendly. No problem splitting the bill. The server clearly explained that the tip was already included and made sure that we understood that we weren't obligated to add any extra tip. 

Overall, this is a very average AYCE place. Nothing to write home about but we certainly had a good time and we left feeling full."}
{"text":"Favourite ayce in Toronto.  I love the amount of options you have to try from.  The food is always fresh and the service is friendly. It does get busy during dinner hours on the weekend so be sure to make a reservation. However I did notice a lot of dirt and dust in the crevices of the walls but I tried not to let it deter me from visiting again."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night for birthday.
price is the usual for AYCE $26.95 On weekends adults
Used to love this AYCE sushi place, but their quality has gone way down after their renovation.

Service was good, but food was horrible.
Hot items came late and when it did arrive it was cold. I.E. their short ribs, tempura, beef rolls all cold.

Sashimi tasted fishy, was not fresh at all you can taste the ice that was frozen.

dessert wasn't great they have creme brule now which is new since the last time i visited. 
it was Bland.

PARKING: Limited parking as the plaza is shared with other stores and a tim hortons.

Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Came here last night, party of four.  We were seated quickly.  It took a while to flag down our waiter but once we got going, they were prompt.

I thought their sushi and sashimi was pretty fresh, I'm not sure about the quality since its AYCE.  However their cooked items were also very tasty.

My favorite was the beef tatami and also the crispy spicy salmon sushi.  Desserts were tasty and well prepared.  I had the green tea ice cream and also the creme brule.

Overall, not a bad restaurant.  Prices are a little higher but not a bad place if you are in the mood for all you can eat sushi."}
{"text":"The first time I went to Ten-Ichi I was really impressed, both by the crowd and by the food. And I was \"drinking\" the dessert cups like shoots because they were so good! But then the second time I went for lunch, I was quite disappointed. I am really looking forward for eating sashimi, but they don't have it at noon for all-you-can-eat. It was quite confusing to do use the iPad to order, and what I ordered doesn't always get to my table. A number of dishes ran out even the number of choices is much less than the supper one. I would recommend the supper all-you-can-eat but not the lunch."}
{"text":"AWESOME ... we were greeted by the owner and yes the place is crazy but the food was great ... we ordered a little of everything since it's all you can eat woohoo ... enjoy"}
{"text":"The quality of food is just alright for a Japanese AYCE: you won't regret coming here, but you probably won't rave about it either. The menu is pretty standard, although they've recently added a few new items like aburi sushi. My real problem with this place is the service. The waiters are fine and I don't think they lost any of our orders. No, what I mean by service is the delivery of the food. We ordered a bunch of dishes at the beginning and some of them didn't arrive until after we had finished our desserts! I'm not really in the mood for more tempura as I'm paying the bill. I expect there to be some delays depending on the particular item, but that's just ridiculous. I've been here several times (I have a relative who likes this place) and it's always been like that so I don't think it's the exception to the rule."}
{"text":"The place was great, location is very accessible, and food was delicious! While they don't have as many selections as other sushi places, they do have a lot of different food, and they were great!"}
{"text":"I love coming here. This is one of my favorite Japanese restaurants to frequent and all the workers know me so well and are very friendly. Being from Vancouver, I still have to get used to the sushi portions and prices in Toronto. I'm glad I found ten-ichi. 

For lunch, the bento boxes are a good deal for $10. It comes with the right amount that can get me quite full. My favorite is the volcano roll. It's a bit pricy and I do crave for it weekly, but it's always so worth it to me! 

Their dinner is only AYCE. It's one of the best that I've ever been to. They do sometimes get your order messed up, and usually don't give you the exact amount of sashimi that you ask for. Just keep ordering more as food appears because you definitely don't want to be sitting around waiting for more food."}
{"text":"Its Ok, but extremely busy. Is it worth it, I don't think so. The food is like most of the all you can eat sushi joints in the Toronto region. Just some minor change.

If you go don't get your hopes it going to be a great place for sushi. Its going to be the same as the rest."}
{"text":"This is one of the better AYCE restaurants in terms of food quality and service. The owner is quite friendly and makes a point of greeting customers and checking on them. You order on an iPad and the turnaround times are quick with minimal missed items which is my pet peeve with AYCE places. The sashimi and sushi are of decent quality using the standards of an AYCE restaurant, and the hot items are good too. I also like that the portions are small so you can literally order just one piece of something."}
{"text":"I am not giving them one star because of the food quality, but because they didn't update the website!!!

On their website , it clearly states a price of weekday lunch ayce, my friend and i trekked down to try Tenichi for the first time in years to be dissapointed that they only serve buffet during dinner hours!!!!"}
{"text":"Monday 1:00 pm at Ten-Ichi Japanese Restaurant

Me - \"Can I have your AYCE lunch?\"
Waiter - \" Sorry, AYCE lunch only available on Saturday and Sunday\"

Fail!!! Super Fail on my part!! 

Ended up having Lunch Specials

- Sushi Lunch Special ($7.50) 
- Teppanyaki Steak and Shrimps with 3 pc of California Roll ($8.50)

with Miso Soup, Salad and Dessert

hmmm, not bad.... but I am here for AYCE.....

FAIL!

My father was so disappointed!

FAIL!

The waitress asked what I want for dessert... I want to scream  AYCE!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place for years, and it's always a safe choice for AYCE sushi - one of the best places in Scarborough for sure. It's busy pretty much all the time, so I would definitely recommend making a reservation. I came on a Wednesday night around 7:30 and the place was completely packed and there were people sitting by the front waiting to get seated. Even when we finished and left around 9:30, there weren't that many empty tables as far as I could see.

Sushi here is always fresh, and they have a great selection of rolls, sashimi, tempura, and cooked foods. I came with my family, and between the five of us we sampled a good variety of items. Our waitress suggested we order a sushi/sashimi boat thing to start, and it had a good variety of rolls - she let us pick some of the ones we wanted on it. Other than that, I wouldn't say this is place is very different from any other AYCE sushi place. They do have a few unique items though and it seems like they are always trying to experiment by adding new things to their menu. They're also pretty good about bringing your food in a timely manner, and don't forget parts of your order, unlike some other places. Everything is delicious and tastes fresh, and I don't feel like they stuff the rolls full of rice or anything. Their desserts are also amazing! Definitely my go-to for AYCE when I'm in the hood :)"}
{"text":"Probably the best ayce sushi places around. Although the food selection is amazing, the service is questionable."}
{"text":"Personally for me this was actually my favorite place to be after they added more items to their menu. The service is really good considering how much employees they have to work with. The atmosphere of the restaurant gives a rather modern- traditional feel. The lighting is not too low nor to bright that would leave your eye squinting. The food is scrumptious and will leave you craving for more. The portions of the items are rather small however since it is a buffet it really doesn't matter.
For dessert, the fudge and the mango pudding are to die for, they are neither too sweet nor too bland. I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of the best all you can eat sushi place out there!! For all you can eat, their sushi is fresh, flavorful, good portion, and a wide selection to choose from. Their sashimis are extremely fresh!! They also have a lot of different food other than sushi such as Japanese ramen, udon, short ribs, tofu, corn, escargo, grilled fish, lots of dessert, and many more. You use a iPad to order the food and the service is quick and attentive!

We have been here many times and this guy name Alex took care of us really well. He always checks up on us to make sure the service is going well. This place can get pretty packed so if you have a large party, it's good to make a reservation beforehand. I would highly recommend this place for the food and service!"}
{"text":"Call before you come to make reservations. This place can get busy with a long long wait. Food was good, above average for AYCE. Good service.

Nothing really blew me away, but nothing was bad either."}
{"text":"We went here on Valentine's Day, for lunch, it was packed.  For an all you can eat sushi place, the choices were not varied.  The fish did not seem fresh, and some of the dishes didn't look anything like in the photos.  Seating was crowded, service was slow, and they were playing some kind of nasty hip-hop.  I'm not sure why they are popular with the amount of much better AYCE sushi places in the GTA."}
{"text":"Short point-form reviews.

Background: I drive from Mississauga to go to this restaurant specifically.

Pros
- delicious hot foods such as their teppanyaki dishes (personally like the avocado seafood salad, but that's just me)
- mango maki roll is delicious (roses maki)
- sashimi is always good for the price you pay
- large variety of foods
- friendly and efficient service

Cons
- best to make reservation because it gets packed any weekday/weekend nights
- atmosphere/ambiance: not the best, but relatively clean and normal

Overall
For an AYCE sushi place, the food quality is average-above average, and you always get a good bang for your buck while not sacrificing/accomodating any type of dirty environment or yucky food."}
{"text":"One of the best quality all-you-can eat Japanese places ever!  We made reservation for 3 and was sitted right away. Service was great!"}
{"text":"I've been to a few AYCE sushi places in the GTA, and Ten-Ichi isn't my favourite. It's expensive for the quality of food they provide, plus they added a 10% gratuity on top of our bill. It came up to ~$30 a person for dinner. They also only accept credit or cash, no debit. 

The \"jumbo\" shrimp is so tiny! It takes about 5 minutes for each item to come from the kitchen. It seems like the food is already pre-made and left in the fridge or freezer until someone orders. 

The dessert selection is good, they have a lot of flavours of ice cream with and without a waffle and the fried banana is fresh. 

I probably would not choose to come back here."}
{"text":"The worst green dragon roll (doesn't even look like one) I've ever had. You will see the tiniest shrimp tempura here LOL. Jumbo shrimp is about the size of an infants pinky. Fried tofu was probably overdue with an abnormal sour taste."}
{"text":"We expected it too be way better

Pros: food was amazing look amazing, authentic, and I can tell because lots of Asians were their.

Cons: THE TIME IS SO CRAZY. It's an all you can eat. Except they bring you the food. BUT THE TAKE SO LONG. OMG I SWEAR THEY LOST 3 STARS FOR THIS. They also gave us some random orders that were for the other table. It might of been they were trying to keep up because it was packed on Mother's Day, but that is CRAZY.

Tip: if you come on a day where it is less people, you will probably get a good experience. 

Oh and something I forgot: the staff were really nice!"}
{"text":"I went here on Easter Sunday, naturally it was super busy.
The fish was really fresh, however they ran out of the creme brulee and white tuna sushi :(  
They do have a lot of different selection, it's great.
I had to ask three different waiters for water though, it took 20 minutes to actually get WATER.
The food itself came out very fast for being literally packed. Quite expensive, but overall fresh and delicious with a wide range of selection. They had a lot of different dessert options, more than I am used to seeing at the AYCE places I've been to."}
{"text":"Seated quickly with reservations on a Sunday for dinner ayce buffet. We only had one person taking orders in our section of the restaurant so we had to wave for his attention many of the times. Everything came out pretty fast except for the dessert. That took so long we thought they forgot about us. But onto the food. The variety of sashimi was pretty good minus the salmon sashimi because the chef didn't properly cut the top layer of the salmon off (darker area under the skin) so it was harder to chew. The maki rolls were delicious but I wished there were more choice of rolls to choose from. Definitely order the flounder it was really good. The desserts were great. So many choices to choose from I loved the mango yogurt and coconut ice cream. If you're a fan of fried banana like myself then you will be disappointed. The two I got were hard and not very good. The weekend price was $28. I would come back for a special occasions or if I was really hungry."}
{"text":"We went there on Thursday around 7pm.  It was not busy hence the food came out very fast. Servers were very attentive and food was good. Although there were some orders that came out with more than ordered and there were some orders that came out fewer than the ordered quantity. My overall experience was good."}
{"text":"Great place but sat near the door not a good place to sit but the food service was really good and the sushi dishes were awesome would cme back here again but not wanting to sit near door. Make reservations though place is busy."}
{"text":"I know a lot of people have complaints about the long wait time here and the fact that the orders always get jumbled. However, the food is good compared to other AYCE sushi places I've been to, none of the servers have bad attitudes, and the owner of the place tries his best to be accommodating. Service is actually so important when it comes to eating for me, because I feel like a lot of the experience from restaurants comes from the people you interact with. I have never had a rude server here. 

The only main issue is that the food doesn't always come even after you order it multiple times. Otherwise, if you make a reservation, you're most likely to get your table within a reasonable time. If you don't, then the owner may occasionally try to compensate you (he gave the group I was with free drinks). 

Oh, and I've seen people compare this place to Matsuda. Funnily enough, the owner of Matsuda used to work at Tenichi. I still think Tenichi is far superior (just from service alone)."}
{"text":"Great AYCE sushi spot in the east end. Everything always tastes fresh. Their best stuff is probably their sashimi and handroll selection, and their desserts!

Definitely call ahead, this place always has a wait at the door. Their washroom is pretty dirty sooo.. use the washroom before you come here or hold it in till you get home!"}
{"text":"One of my fav. AYCE place. The place is relatively packed, so you should always make reservation before hand.  I been here before and after the renovation, and have always left happily. You should definetely try the grill - teriyaki  atleast once, despite the additional cost. The chef is extremely friendly and it's quite enjoyable to watch him cook and all the technique he uses. He seemed happy to take your order and cook for you.
Service was excellent. The waiter/waitress constantly refilled our tea without asking. I was actually surprised they even changed our dirty plate after 1 hour eatting. Waiter and chef provided excellent recommendation.
The salmon was fresh, and really good.  Unlike most people, I didn't think their desert was anything special. I do applaud them for having more dessert selections than your typical AYCE restaraunts. So that's defintely a bonus.

Would defientely come again."}
{"text":"Not a big fan of all you can eat sushi because of food quality.  This place however, is an exception and is one of my favourites.  Good food and fresh sushi.  The only downside is you may need to wait for a table even if you've made reservations.  The wait time could be 30-45 minutes past your booking time.  But that can't stop me from coming here!"}
{"text":"4.5 stars.

I tried the AYCE teppanyaki dinner and boy, was it packed.

I can attest to the efficient service. Food arrived very quickly even though it was super busy. The chef that served us was very polite and professional.

I liked most of the food we ordered. Some kinds of the raw fish were not as fresh as others. The tempura could use some more work. The mango rolls were delicious even though I'm not a fan of mango. The teppanyaki was very good. I also liked their selection of desserts.

The prices are competitive with other Japanese AYCE restaurants. Some may find it pricey but having been to \"budget-friendly\" AYCE places, I can assure anyone the quality difference makes up for the higher price tag. The teppanyaki was only a $2 extra charge per person.

I would recommend anyone, even if you don't like raw food, to give Ten-ichi a try."}
{"text":"one of the better AYCE sushi places i've been too 
definatly worth the drive"}
{"text":"Made a reservation here for my sister's birthday and they confirmed it the night before. I arrive the next day and the doors are locked saying there is a scheduled maintenance issue. I don't know why they did not inform me beforehand. Terrible customer service, do not trust them."}
{"text":"I have been here four times and never had a good experience. The wait staff is completely incompetent. Last time I went here after taking our order I didn't see our food or the waited for an hour, when I waved someone down to ask I was told she's gone on her break.....?
Considering most dishes are raw food it shouldn't take 35 minutes to get a salad and an order of sashimi. 
If the service had been bad once I'd chalk it up to a bad day, but it's consistently horrible.
The food also isn't fresh, and it's made lazily.
Learned my lesson. Won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"This place was great! The food was delicious and very fresh, and the lunch price was very reasonable at 15.99 for all you can eat. Service was good as well and overall just a nice place to go to! We'll definitely be back. Recommended. :)

Update: we've been here a few more times since my last review and this is now my boyfriend and I's fabourite sushi spot ever. They have the freshest food and most authentic I've ever tried. The service is unbeatable. Waiters are posted nearby each seating section and as soon as you pick up your menu they're over to your table in seconds. 

Favourite! Highly, highly recommended."}
{"text":"My family frequents this restaurant whenever we are in Toronto, without fail. We love it. The food is always delicious, the sashimi fresh, and the wait staff (albeit slow because of the high volume) is always nice and accommodating. Be sure to make a reservation because those with reservations have priority, especially during the weekends when this place is packed. Another thing is, my boyfriend, who is not the biggest fan of any food Asian, was floored by the hibachi / teppanyaki. He said it was delicious and loved the experience. I would highly recommend this place to anyone. Especially if you are coming from the US and the Canadian dollar is weak. For a group of 15, we paid around CA$540, including tips. That's less than US$28 per person!"}
