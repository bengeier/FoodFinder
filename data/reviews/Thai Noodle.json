{"text":"This place is right on the border of Kensington and Chinatown, and easily overlooked (I drove by it).  The outside betrays what's inside; a very nice, clean and recently renovated restaurant.  This is a refreshing change from many of the other establishments located in this general area.  We ordered the pad thai, tom yam w/shrimp and green curry.  The Tom Yam was a bit too salty for me, but they don't cheap out on the shrimp like a lot of place do; they gave 4 whole shrimp!  The pad thai w/chicken was also good.  Not as tomatoey as many places often make it.  I can almost imagine the chef at those establishments going through lots of ketchup for that dish!  None to be concerned about with this one.    Finally the green curry was very nice.  I would say my favourite dish.    We also got ginger tea + honey as well as a thai iced tea.  All said, less than $40 with tip.  Pretty good value considering a lot of other Thai places would charge much more for the same dish."}
{"text":"Just ate here this evening and within an hour I was vomiting and felt very ill.  The person I was with realized that her same reaction a year ago was not the flu which her mother had convinced her of. There are some serious issues with how they handle food and I will most definitely never go again."}
{"text":"Worth the short trip to pick it up yourself. Best Thai takeout in the area. We \"discovered\" them last month & have ordered from them three times since then. Honestly, IDK what \"authentic Thai flavour\" is since I've never been to Thailand, so bear that in mind...  Thai Noodle's dishes have a more complex & varied, i.e. enjoyable flavour profile versus their counterparts' typical drowning most everything in salt, no joke. We've had: curry pad thai w beef, curry pad thai w vegetable, pad thai w beef, red curry chicken (I recommend getting coconut rice w it), pad woon sen w chicken, & mango sticky rice for dessert. All quite satisfactory & consistent from one order to the next. Servings are a decent size. Good value for money. They're on our list of regular takeout places now.  TIP: they seem to be short on delivery staff so it can take an hour (maybe more, maybe less) to get the food to your door. Our solution: hubby makes the 25 mins TTC round trip to pick it up. BTW, it only took 15-20 mins for our food to be ready -- fast as pizza! Ask them how long for pick up & how long for delivery so you can get a time estimate :)"}
{"text":"Nice! I am always a fan of a tasty, brothy soup when its cold out. Soup was truly intense, its thick with little bits of beefy goodness floating around. Also appreciated the flavourful herbs on top. Good service too.   Definitely a nice alternative to the usual pho noodle soup I go for in China Town.  I had the Guay Tiew Ruer Nuer (Rice Noodles with Beef, Beef Balls, Basil, and Beansprouts in an intense brown soup)."}
{"text":"FOOD Got their $7.99 lunch special on the weekend to go and was blown away.   It had a generous chicken pad Thai (though there are a few options), 1 petite vegetable spring roll/dipping sauce, and 1 small vegetable soup.    Dinner specials are $10.99.  They have great attention to detail, as apparent in the perfect cubes of tofu and vegetable cuts.  Unlike many Thai places in Toronto, they were extremely helpful and accommodating to help me avoid shrimp (allergy).    DECOR Fairly plain, but clean.  Big salt water fish tank on the counter which could keep kids busy for a while.  SEATING It is not a huge restaurant, maybe seats 35-50.  They could probably handle 8-10 people on a long table with reservations, but they don't have a private dining area for groups.  DELIVERY Minimum order $25 before HST Delivery area is Eglinton Ave W down to Bloor St W between Avenue Rd and Lansdowne Ave. New Delivery Hours:  Sun - Thurs 11:30am - 9:30pm, Fri & Sat 11:30am - 10:30pm Take Out Menu has great pictures -- AND YES, the food does look as good as the pictures.  PARKING Street parking (the only real option) can be very difficult since the area is so overcrowded.  1 hour free parking on a couple side streets, but metered parking is likely what you'll get.  There is a Green P parking lot on Bathurst just south of St Clair on the east side of the street, but it's sort of a pain because you have to walk up to the lights then back down or jaywalk across 4 lanes of traffic (be safe!).  We had to walk 5 blocks mid afternoon and found there was better street parking options by Wychwood Barns Park (several blocks away).  The St Clair Street Car that lets off at Bathurst is probably your best option.  VERDICT I grabbed a take out menu and can't wait to go back to try more."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in Kensington market.  The restaurant serves up an authentic Thai-style noodle dishes and various other Thai dishes.  Thai noodle is definitely one of a few among the Thais favorites.   I always order Guay Tiew Tom Yum Moo ($8.95) with the thin rice noodle. At Thai noodle, you have the option of thick rice noodle,thin rice noodle, glass noodle, vermicelli and egg noodle for every Guay-Tiew (which means noodle in Thai) dish.  They also have special dish of the week every week and those special dishes are really SPECIAL like how it should be. All of the specials are what attract the Thais.  Those dishes are guaranteed to be 100%authentic.   If you find the food to be to spicy, make sure to order the Thai Iced tea (Chaa-nom). The sweetness of the Thai tea will be sure to cut down the spiciness of the food.  It's definitely a good Thai restaurant when majority of the customers are Thai. ;)"}
{"text":"I ordered about 12 dishes for a party. It was mostly pretty good, but the pad Thai was weak. Really weak. No scallions, no bean sprouts, no basil. Not enough tamarind. Just tasted like bland, plain noodles.   Other dishes were fine, but not great. Satay came with tiny portions of peanut sauce. Summer rolls were dry and also had very little of the sweet vinagre sauce.   Last, our pickup estimate was 45 min, but ended up taking 1.5 hrs. Bummer."}
{"text":"Pad thai is small and taste like rubber. Stir fry vegetables the portion was stupid small."}
{"text":"When it was Taste of Thai house it was amazing bang for buck. Now its only so so, smaller portion sizes and expensive for what you get.  Only order from them occasionally now."}
{"text":"I will stress the food is good! I ordered the Spicy Basil Chicken lunch special and was delighted by it. My gripe is with the crappy service I received! It was SO bad that I just had to come to Yelp to complain :(  First it started off okay, the young lady showed me to my table but that is where the good service stopped. There was 2 other tables, so it was not busy AT ALL but she seemed to rush around like it was.   Background: I was a server, in a high demand establishment where flipping multiple tables during your shift was very common. I understand high volume and how to multitask and time manage so I maybe a little biased. Still, service is service and if you cannot handle 3 tables you need to reevaluate your job.    3 more tables came in after me, an older gentleman and a couple of men plus a family. It took her after giving those people their menu's, to give me mine. I was beginning to get annoyed. She then proceeded to serve the other tables BEFORE me, they got their appetizers first, she took their order first, replenished their waters, etc... you get the point. When I ordered, I ordered a coke. I never received it. I was too pissed off to bother, once I FINALLY received my food, I quickly just ate it (again the food was yummy and I would prolly order take out from them again). When I went to pay, I asked for my change. She never gave me my change!!! I actually had to physically get up from my table to the cash register to tell her that I wanted my change. She told me \"Oh I thought it was my tip\" I laughed. No, you do not deserve a tip! And I left.  I would have given this place a 1 star but the food was good so I cannot rate it that low. Again, I maybe biased regarding my desire to have adequate service but honestly, rule of thumb for serving is whoever you show the table to first, orders first unless they (the customer) is too busy or calls you off. I never indicated I did not want to order. I am a new customer, and you should want to bring new customers in with amazing service. I am not impressed and will not be returning for sit down service."}
{"text":"Thai Noodle Guay Tiew Thai 62 Vaughan Road Toronto, ON  416-652-0200  Once called Taste of Thai House, the space at 62 Vaughan Road at the intersection of Vaughan Road and St. Clair Avenue West, is now Thai Noodle.  From the on-line reviews on-line, the renovations occurred early in November of 2013 when it was still Taste of Thai House.  So some questions arise... Is the new Thai Noodle owned by the same owners of Thai House?  Is this Thai Noodle Guay Tiew Thai related to the one of the same name that closed recently on Baldwin in Kensington Market?  The Urban Foodie does not have a concrete answer but decided to check out the new Thai Noodle.  One of the dishes that were ordered was the Home Style Pad Thai ($11.99).  It is on the sweet side but not as sweet as the Pad Thai offered at the often lauded Sukho Thai.  It comes with the standard Pad Thai ingredients such as peanuts, been sprouts, tofu and green onions.  On top were two jumbo shrimp.  Tiny dried shrimp, not a usual ingredient, were a welcome addition scattered throughout.  The salty dried shrimp cut through the sweetness.  The Pad Thai was small in quantity Beef Khao Soi ($11.99) was also ordered.  Northern Thai Khao Soi is a dish that contains fried and boiled egg noodles in a curry-like sauce containing coconut milk.  This particular preparation also had red onions and pickled mustard greens.  Artistically speaking, the fried noodles could have been stacked higher.  The friend noodles were also way too salty.  The curry was rich however and infused the tender beef pieces with flavour.  Some of the beef pieces had a gelatinous, cartilage layer which just made the beef even better (if you like that kind of thing).  It was surprising that the Chicken Panaeng Curry ($10.99) did not come with any rice.  But it was definitely the best dish of the night.  The curry was rich and thick.  It was aromatic with excellent peanut flavour.       The Jasmine rice ($1.99) that was ordered was creatively served in a star shaped format.    While there were hits and misses, a trip to Thai Noodle can be warranted for a casual night out."}
{"text":"Have only gotten take-out...stick with the house special Pad-Thai and their stir-fries. Curries are so-so, Penang Curry is the best of the bunch!"}
{"text":"Great food! ok service and serve food on plastic plates but some of he best Thai food I've ever had. Portions could be bigger especially the amount of protein dishes include."}
{"text":"The food is very good but not worth the wait or the owners attitude towards customers.  He has no problem lying to customers (especially take out) in order to get the order.  We were told our order would be ready for pick up in 30 minutes.   When we arrived, there was a line and we stood there for an additional 30 minutes with not so much as apology or acknowledgement we were there.  While talking to others we learned, that at least 5 other parties were in the same boat.  I would have attributed this to unique situation but this has now happened 3x and this is the last time we will order from there.    It used to be a wonderful place but it's really gone down hill.     If you're ordering from Uber, he has no respect for the Uber drivers or their customers.  He told the Uber drivers to cancel clients orders and the drivers fought to ensure orders would be fulfilled.  He didn't have the courage to call the customers or recognize their business.  Complete disrespect.    Will not visit again...and will not recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Ordered chicken pad thai for take-out and was not very impressed.  Portion size was decent but they skimped on veggies, so basically I got a lot of carbs with very little taste and nutrition.  A few weeks later I decided to give them a second chance and again ordered take-out- after all, maybe pad thai isn't their strong suit, or maybe it was just a one-off bad night.  This time my husband and I decided to try the beef khao soi, which was described as steamed and crispy egg noodles with yellow curry sauce, onions, sprouts, coriander, and preserved cabbage (the preserved cabbage was the selling point for us as we're both fans of anything pickled).  The noodles, steamed underneath, crispy on top, came in a styrofoam container, the curry sauce in a separate plastic container.  Upon scooping out the noodles I discovered about one tablespoon of pickled cabbage and one tablespoon of chopped red onion, with a pinch of sprouts.  Well, skimped again, I thought.  Shame too, cause the pickled cabbage was pretty good.  As it came, it was more a garnish than a real component of the dish.  The yellow curry was thin, and there were a total of three small pieces of very fatty beef in it.  The flavor was OK, and the beef was tender, but definitely not worth the $12 it cost.  On to the second dish we ordered: chicken red curry.  Once again, the sauce was very thin, in fact, I'd say both sauces had the consistency of soup, rather than a sauce.  The flavor was very similar to the yellow curry sauce (soup), with the yellow one being slightly more savory, although both were sweet.  There was no, I repeat NO, spiciness whatsoever in either curry at all.  Curries should have at least a hint of heat to them in my opinion.  On the plus side, the red curry did have more pieces of chicken and of a much better quality than the beef.  Again I would have preferred more chopped veggies in it.  Also not impressed that the dish doesn't come with rice.  I mean, how are you supposed to eat it if you don't pay $2 for the cup of rice that comes as a side-dish?  If it's a sauce, it has to go on something, right?  Oh right, I already decided it's more of a soup, so I guess they expect people to slurp it up with a spoon.  And really, if I have to pay $2 for a side of rice, at least they could give enough rice to eat all of the curry.  I mean, it's rice for crying out loud, it's a cheap ingredient and they shouldn't skimp on that at the very least.  We also ordered two appetizers.  The mango salad, which was good but again they skimped on the cashews.  I understand cashews are a more expensive ingredient, but again their presence was more of a garnish, and for $8 it was over-priced.  The fried calamari was tasty, but there was only a tablespoon of \"coleslaw\" (shredded carrot), and the portion was again too small for the price of $8.  In short, dinner for two cost $44, and we're both still hungry and very disappointed.  Will NOT be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Before renovating, it was called Taste of Thai House, and the food was delicious, but the atmosphere a bit shabby. Now, the menu is the same, but is matched by very nice decor, and the service is over the top.  My test of a Thai place is in the veggie spring rolls and the pad thai, and both are perfect here. Unless of course you like your pad thai ketchupy or slimy."}
{"text":"Okay so I have been here three times now which usually qualified a reliable review in my mind. I have to admit they make amazing pad Thai which is what the stars are for not the service. I never feel let down by it and it is quite filling. I have had the chicken and the beef one. I also have had the cold rolls with peanut sauce which are so refreshing with the mint leaves and lemongrass ? Anywho what I was however miffed about was that this past time I came for my takeout they said it would be 15-20 minutes. However, considering I'm a veteran of the service industry I know how Saturday's go therefore I showed up half an hour after placing my order. My stomach is making whale sounds and I'm getting over my cold and just want to crawl back into the sauna I call my home. The girls are the cash have no idea about my order and although they were not speaking English I know the order was not placed let alone coming hot off the pot. Soooo I try to distract myself with the fish and ponder about other life things but there are screaming children with their iPhones (?!?!?!) 20 minutes go by and they have also forgotten another guys order and his wife is standing outside with the dog and she's giving him dirty looks he's pretending to not see. He started eating the handful of matcha candies and I'm about to eat the fish from the tank but then finally then order comes out and it's been an hour since ordering. For one beef pad Thai. They didn't even say sorry or offer anything on the side. If I ever was late on delivering what i said when I worked takeout counter at a fine dining restaurant I would throw in slices of dessert or an appetizer to get the people to shut up and stay happy loyal customers. Just saying ! Overall, great food and defiantly loved in the area but for sure don't say one thing and do another."}
{"text":"Good food and even better service , i wanna point at the restaurant pretty full but the only server there was always smiling and on point. Nice people."}
{"text":"Another Thai disappointment. I ordered red curry chicken and basil beef. I could tell that this could be better with a bit of fine tuning, but i could barely discern the flavours because the sauces were so watered down. Over rice I could barely taste anything. Add to the, the portions are minuscule. Won't be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Thanks to Susan for organising a UYE at this place, being a big fan of Thai food I love finding places like this that normally I would just walk past and go to somewhere I am more familiar with.  Inside it is nothing fancy with suitable and adequate seating for a decent sized crowd although I do not think the service or kitchen would cope with a full house. Which is the only bad thing I have to say about this place. Oh that and I wish they put on Hancock sooner rather than later.  Ordered Fish balls for starters, but was given spring rolls which I totally did not realise until I had eaten one of them, so soon enough I had a decent portion of what I originally ordered.  For mains I went with a seafood red curry, and rice was an extra $1.50 - dislike paying for rice as always think it should be come with the dish. Anyway it was pretty puckaliscious with...and yes I counted 4 prawns, 2 oysters things and 2 slightly chewy squid type things.   The menu is very clear, not confusing and has a great variety of dishes.   I would definitely come here again as prefer this kind of drop by quick eat and continue galavanting in Kensington to a full stomach all for just under $20."}
{"text":"I am from Thailand. I can guarentee everything we ordered test great and fresh. The staff were friendly and helpful :)"}
{"text":"I love thai food and am always open to trying new places. I was looking at thai places to try (accessible by foot from work for lunch) and this place was well ranked among the Yelp members.   The restaurant was clean, the hostess/server was very polite and knowledgeable about the food. When I sat down I noticed everyone had soup however, I decided to try something I've never had before. I ended up trying the Pad Kee Mao with shrimp. The shrimp were yummy and the veggies were fresh. However, there was one flavor I would get every couple of bites that threw me off a little. This could have been also from the fact I did not know all the ingredients in my meal, but still good none the less. Lunch was reasonably priced at $11 for meal + tip.  With this being said, I want to go back and try either one of their noodle soups or wonton soups.   Also bonus, the candy they give you with your bill are my FAV and I seriously need to find out where I can buy them from lol"}
{"text":"Great local Thai place. We live a block away so I went in to pick it up- ordered the pad thai and the green curry. Both dishes were pretty good but it is kind of disappointing you have to order rice separately for the curry. The employee that helped me was very friendly and fast, and the interior of the place looked really nice and clean. We'll be ordering again"}
{"text":"Extremely friendly service! And the renovations turned out great. I ordered the Pad Thai, and thankfully the staff was very accommodating towards a gluten free and vegan diet. Food is a bit pricey, but it tastes great. I cannot stress enough how much I love pad thai! Their green curry is delicious as well. I'll be back again soon."}
{"text":"Cheap food, good food, friendly service and a big screen moving playing random blockbuster movies (LotR and Avatar when I've been here) can only mean that your meal here is bound to be memorable and pleasant!   There's not much to say about Thai noodle because all their food I've tried have been solid bets (I particular enjoy the green/red curries), they have the ability to spice it up for you, service is relatively quick and it is one of those hidden gems around Kensington.   There are a few other Thai restaurants in the area, but Thai Noodle would be my number one pick!"}
{"text":"Small & cozy. Delicious, authentic Thai. If you ask them to make it \"Thai Spicy\", they will, Some restaurants are afraid to. Good prices, attentive staff, sweet Thai tea.  Try the Tom Kha & spice it up."}
{"text":"I love this place, they open late, and I am literally hooked up on their curry chicken pad thai. I have to have it at least once a week!"}
{"text":"My friend has eaten her numerous times and has loved everything she has eaten. She had eggplant this time.   That said it was my first time there and with a name like Thai noodle, shouldn't your noodle dishes be awesome????  I had the pad Thai. Was very disappointed, lacked the flavour you'd expect in Thai food. No spicy, sour, sweet combination on my tongue!   I'd try it again for the other dishes. I ended up cooking pad Thai at home to get my fix!!"}
{"text":"*Name* Guay Tiew Ruer Nuer($8.95)  *Description* Rice Noodles with Beef, Beef Balls, Basil, and Beansprouts in an ~INTENSE BROWN SOUP~ !!  *Decision* MMMmmmmm intense, brown, translucent soup.  WTF They sure know how to make Food sound scrumptious(sarcasm) SOLD  Side note: Fellow Yelper looked up Brown Soup on Urban Dictionary. *Warning*  DO NOT look up Brown Soup on Urban Dictionary !!!  Intense fresh Basil triggered my saliva glands on Guay Tiew arrival. As described, all things came in one bowl. Friendly waitress explained how condiments works.  Taste Intense Brown Soup. Add equal proportions of each condiment to taste: Dried Chili  -  Fish Sauce  -  Chili in Vinegar  -  Table Sugar  Cleared the bowl. Drained the Brown Soup.  Needs to be more wallet-friendly.   2.5 *Star* To compete with Asian Noodle places within strides from here."}
{"text":"We Ordered food here before but this time decided to eat there , don't exactly remember what we Ordered but it was good throughout from the crispy spring rolls to the sweet an sour soup to the other dishes. Yummy yummy and real authentic.  The waiter was soft and nice too.  Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Real tasty, some dishes are ridiculously high priced but other than that it was yummy.  Wish I had known about this place before, now I'm moving away."}
{"text":"Pretty authentic, coming from a Thai person :) `Service could be a bit slow but they get busy sometimes so it's understandable"}
{"text":"A pretty nice authentic Thai restaurant along Vaughan and St. Clair. Very nice & well-lit restaurant, the servers were friendly and accommodating.  Price is just right. We ordered the chicken and shrimp pad-thai, it's the best!! Unique and tasty Thai beverages for $4.99, (we ordered the Thai iced tea w/ lots of Ice cubes),quite pricey but worth trying out.Tried the green curry but for some reason we find it watery and not much chicken meet, other than that,  it's a little spicy however it tastes great!!"}
{"text":"Golden, Green and Red curries are all excellent.   The curries have a relatively diluted consistency, and you can taste the impact of various ingredients. They use a nice array of different vegetables.  Rice or Noodles is extra. I enjoyed ordering plain Noodles (pad thai noodles) and dipping that into the curry."}
{"text":"I only had a vegetable pad thai take out ($8).  It was flavourful and big portion.  I was not sure it was authentic, as it used Chinese pickled salt and sour vegetable.  It tasted like a good rice noodle instead.  If you don't mind it doesn't taste like pad thai, it is good enough, however."}
{"text":"nice friendly and welcoming place in the hearth of kensington and chinatown. been there enough times now to know that i know i won't be disappointed; they threat me very nice, and the girl took her time to recommend what would be best for me..  the soups are good.(though i never been much of a soup person) but the stir fry is what keep me going over and over..."}
{"text":"Easily the best Thai takeout I've had in the city. Cedarvale residents take note: this place destroys the regal pachyderm place on Eglinton.  Highlights include their tofu cold rolls, pad thai, cashew nut beef, green curry chicken, golden tofu curry and sweet and sour chicken.  Delivery is crazy fast - always comes well before the hour they quote me.  Note: if you can't handle spicy food always ask for it to be made not spicy. There's usually a pleasant kick to their dishes."}
{"text":"The others in my party ordered standard Thai food, which was delicious. especially the tom kha soup.  I had the Guay Tiew Ruer Nuer.  Having never been to Thailand and with not many Thai restaurants offering noodle soup, this was new to me.  It is quite different than pho as it seems to be made out of beef broth that has had beef pieces cooked so long as to disintegrate into the broth - truly intense and rich.  The beef ball and meat in the soup were delicious as well.  As other viewers mentioned, perhaps a tad pricy on the noodle soup though prices for regular Thai dishes were pretty standard.  Friendly and helpful service and very clean."}
{"text":"My wife and I arrived at this establishment 1 hour and 15 minutes before closing time, and I asked the waiter where the washroom was and he pointed me the directions. After I came back to take a seat the waiter asked my wife and I if we were ready to order. Keep in mind this is the same waiter I asked where the washroom was and he saw me take a seat and approached our table. My wife and I were rushed to order since he came the second time 3 minutes afterwards. We ordered our food and my wife got the Thai noodle soup and I got the pad Thai.   The Thai noodle soup had no flavor and there was only 2 scoops of noodles and tasted like water mixed with garlic paste and oil. My wife loves chicken and to pick out the chicken from the soup and to place it on a different plate means something. She informed me that it a absolutely did not taste like chicken, and also looked like another animals meat. $9 for flavorless hot water questionable \"chicken\" soup. The soup as well smelled like wet dog.    The chicken pad Thai smelled awful. It smelled like wet dog and I could not bear the smell. It was a very small portion for $10. The customer service is terrible. We were never asked for our beverages and as well if we wanted any dessert afterwards.  There are other Thai places around the area that are far more superior than this place such as green pepper Thai and Pho Xua."}
{"text":"My wife and I tried Thai Noodle last week as part of a long search for authentic Thai food in Toronto. We have tried many, many Thai restaurants in the last year having never found one that is truly impressive--until last week. Thai Noodle is exactly what we were looking for. Authentic Thai food with fresh ingredients and a complexity of flavours that makes you think you are in Thailand.   We ordered our staple three dishes as our Thai food test: papaya salad, home style pad Thai and red curry chicken. All were absolutely delicious. Every dish had a perfect balance of flavours--sweet, sour, spicy, salty and bitter--which, for anyone that has tried making Thai food at home, is extremely difficult to get just right. There is simply a depth of flavour that only comes from a well trained chef experienced at cooking authentic Thai.   Our server was friendly and attentive. Prices are very affordable.  We will be back again and again and are excited to try the dishes we have not yet tasted. Thank you, Thai Noodle, for restoring our confidence that there is at least one, good authentic Thai restaurant in Toronto."}
{"text":"Food is okay however, I'd like to emphasize their customer service on this review.   When me and my friend dined in here last March 30th about 2pm, I noticed that they don't greet their customers as they come in. They stare at you instead of saying \"Hi or Welcome\". I also noticed that same day, a lady walked in and sat down and just waited for the waiter to give her a menu but restaurant staff never did. So the lady walked out of the restaurant.   I think this place would be great if staff would practice and show  more excellent customer service to guests. Not so impressed at all. Customer service goes a long way."}
{"text":"I can't believe I've lived so close to this place for so long, and haven't gone in until this weekend.   The food and service at this place gave it the five star review - because both are amazing! Sure, the decor could be spruced up a little, but with food like that, it really doesn't matter.   We had:   - Shrimp Tom Yum Soup: delicious, perfectly spicy, wonderful lemongrass flavor - love the fresh cilantro on top  - Wonton Soup: pretty hard to mess up, and they didn't - it was delicious  - Tofu Green Curry: vegetables were fresh, crisp and delicious, tofu was fried to perfection   - Chicken Red Curry: also amazing, same fresh vegetables and tender chicken!   - Steamed Rice: came in the shape of a star!! (pictured) which was just the best thing ever  Now what made this delicious food even better was the fabulous service! The servers were extremely friendly, always there to refill our water (we are big water drinkers), and wondering how our food was. They noticed I was avoiding the mushrooms and told me they would be happy not to include them next time, and they also told me they would adjust the spice next time if I wanted it less spicy (I don't!! I can handle it!!). They also asked if we had ever been to Thailand, and were really friendly and conversational with other diners as well.   There are so many other things I want to try on their menu - lots of noddle soups which are their specialty. I picked up a takeout menu, and I can already tell I'll become a regular there!   My only complaint about this place is this: they are fork-assumers! I can eat with chopsticks!! I hate it when a restaurant assumes and brings a fork - also I definitely noticed that they were selective about who they were giving chopsticks vs. forks to - and I unhappily fell into the fork category. Next time I'm demanding chopsticks!!   But their fork-assumptions will not keep me away."}
{"text":"Good god this place is good.  Real thai, real ingredients, lots of veggies, good serving sizes and always always ready in 20 minutes.  Spicy basil with beef, jasmine rice, wonton soup and spring rolls - every time, every time, every time."}
{"text":"The food is average.  It's OK for a neighbourhood that's missing good Thai food.  Keep in mind that the kitchen may be very busy on the weekend for dinner.  If you're getting takeout, make sure you give them enough time, or else you'll be standing in a long line of people chewing on their fingernails."}
{"text":"I tried to use them with ubereats, the driver never delivered the meal, so because they couldn't get there $15 credit for the meal, they decided not to send a new order to me. They were not accommodating at all. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Slurping down my bowl of guai-tiaw at Thai Noodle brought back memories.. my favourite memories of vacationing in Bangkok... chowing down bowls of noodles at street vendors...   Here at Thai Noodle there are 15 or so different combination of Thai noodle you can choose from.. with different meat (pork/beef/chicken), seafood or even vegetarian versions from $6.95, in spicy or non spicy broth.   Guay Tiew Tom Yam Gai ($8.95)  - Rice Noodles with chicken, crispy wontons, fish balls, tofu in Tom Yum Soup  - Really savoury soup.. seasoned with fish sauce, salty in a satisfying way  - Peanuts, green onions, and coriander added great flavours  - Portion size is a little small... great as snack... or you might have to order a second   Love how condiments are on the side so you can adjust to your own taste:  - dried chili for spiciness  - fish sauce for saltiness  - chili in vinegar for sourness  - sugar for sweetness   Of course for me will be dried chili to fired up my taste buds!! :)   Thai Iced Tea ($2.50) was a great drink to cool me down while I slurping those rice noodles and drinking the soup...   They accepts Visa and Mastercard.  Too bad.. the Guay Tiew here is not as cheap as Thailand's! :)"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and tried the thom Kua soup and tofu veggie fresh spring rolls.  Enjoyed both of them and the people are also nice.  Prices are decent.  I'll have to come back and try their pad Thai."}
{"text":"so far, the most authentic Thai restaurant I've visited in Toronto. the flavors are very authentic and rarely do you have food that is too sweet, a common problem with other Thai restaurants.  The main dishes are served \"Thai style\", as in for sharing, so you should order rice separately for each person.  Their strongest suit is their soups and noodles of course and I strongly recommend trying those out over the curries and rice based dishes, although those are still good too."}
{"text":"This place was so good we tried it Saturday and went back Sunday AND ordered take out! Definitely authentic and what's special about them is having Thai noodle soup. Boat noodle is really good but normal noodle was good too. Pad Thai apparently if you want authentic you have to order the \"home style\" one (I ordered in Thai and that's what the Thai server recommended for me). That was also good! They have lots of Thai food to order besides noodles. Food was quite fast and service is good. Well Panang curry wasn't good but I've literally only been to one Thai restaurant that can do it right and it's in Vancouver.  I'm also pretty sure there's a secret Thai menu because I saw a table of Thai ppl eating somtum with crab and I'm almost 100% sure that wasn't on the menu. I will try ordering it next time to see if the chef would indulge me lol"}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant since they opened and have loved it. Sadly tonight is going to be my last visit. They have never been generous with the proteins here, so we always pay for extra. Tonight we had extra chicken in two dishes and it was an expensive joke. They have upped the extra protein cost to $4 and barely add anything. The service is always a little off. They had the tv playing without sound that kept losing the channel, music that was too loud and then random crowd noises coming through another speaker like someone was watching sports on another system. Lastly, they have changed all of their plates to cheap melamine from nice ornate serving dishes. This restaurant is not cheap and these are plates you would see in a cafeteria. It's sad to watch a restaurant decline like this, I thought it was under new management the changes were so dramatic. It may be the fact that Toronto is so expensive and they have to cut corners. Only so many corners you can cut before people stop coming. RIP Thai Noodle House. The pretty pictures other posted on nice plates, doesn't exist anymore."}
