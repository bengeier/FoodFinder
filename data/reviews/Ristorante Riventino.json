{"text":"Amazing. Simply fabulous. The restaurant is nice and cozy, the service could have been a bit more sociable and intimate for the ambiance the restaurant gives but it was decent, efficient and knowledgeable so can't complain. Went on a Thursday evening was nice and quiet ...except for 2 obnoxious patrons who seemed to be regulars and insisted the whole restaurant know their business but aside from those 2 jackasses and their obnoxious dates it was a very pleasant place to be, very comfortable. Now onto the important part...the wine...and the food! Do not pass this up!!! Go right now ...i promise your taste buds won't be disappointed. We wanted a 2010 Chianti classico bottle of red but they were out, we were suggested Villa Antinori 2012 as a resemblance and we were highly satisfied it is a lovely sangiovese blend (decanter service btw which is a nice touch). I ordered the braised lamb in demi glace my boyfriend had the chicken parmigianno, we had the riventino antipasti as an entree and lattés to finish... All was sooooooo inexplicably fantabulous...especially the lamb shank which was perfection melt in your mouth fall off the bone orgasmic so lucky to have the privilege to savour! Portions were decent, prices were acceptable for the quality. This will be a new regular for shizzle! The lattés are a perfect finish to a perfect meal and among the best latté i've had so far. Only downside is their meats are not available for purchase by the pound and only the sausage is made in house ( meat wise i mean cuz practically every single other thing you order is home made! And tastes fantastic!!) I highly recommend this place as a nice treat, being right next to the beautiful riverside is an added bonus...go for a nice walk before or after for a wonderful night to remember. Happy 16th anniversary my love xxx."}
{"text":"Came here with the in-laws for Easter Sunday brunch. Nice selection of hot and cold plates, and I have to say the pasta and lasagna were very good. 

Desserts were okay, they hit the spot!

Service was fantastic. Great staff. 

Parking can be tricky. Nice location near the water though. We will be back."}
{"text":"If you want to escape annoying hipsters which seem to have taken over Montreal, but want a really good Italian meal, you can't miss with Ristorante Riventino. Sitting on a prime location beside the Parc des Rapides, in Lasalle, Riventino offers top notch, fresh home-made Italian fare and very decent prices.

This place has been here for over 40 years so that's got to tell you something, given the fierce competition in Montreal's restaurant scene. You have to be good in order to have any longevity in this city of foodies.

Friend and I came here after an evening of walking and hanging out by the Rapids, what I noticed right away was that the balcony planters were all growing fresh herbs. I think it was the owner who served us, really friendly service overall.

I spotted a homemade pasta dish with lamb ragout, that's not common and I'll probably give it a go the next time I'm here. Nonetheless, this first time I had their Riventino pizza, a homemade thin-crust pizza with mushrooms, cheese, and pork. When I asked for hot chili flakes, the owner asked if I like things really hot. I do so he offered the really hot chili oil. Pieces of sliced red chillies marinated and sitting in extra-virgin olive oil, infusing the oil with the heat of the chillis. It was the perfect condiment to my pizza. I should add the pizza was a perfect meal size as well. Not so filling that you feel you can't walk afterwards but just enough to satisfy.

My friend had the fettucine dish made with artichoke pesto and chicken. She loved it. With bruscetta and bread offered right way, a staff that makes you feel welcome, a great view of the river, I wouldn't hesitate to come here again."}
