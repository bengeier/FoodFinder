{"text":"Played 18 holes in under 3 hours. It truly has rolling hills which provided a challenge for a beginning golfer. The round with a cart was very affordable at only $14. The scenery was very pretty with mountain views everywhere.    The staff was very friendly and helped me find a pair to go out with as I had booked my tee time 20 minutes before showing up.   This course is a hidden gem for locals (I live 8 miles from here and didn't know it existed) It is however just a municipal course but I did love the cart path and the greens were nicely maintained.  If you are a serious golfer I would stay away but for beginners like me this place was great."}
{"text":"Rolling Hills is great when you want a short, easy course with interesting terrain, good views, and  zoo animals.  I believe this course has to be the only golf course in Arizona next to a this much wildlife."}
{"text":"Have enjoyed this mini short course for many years. Perched on the hills around the Papago Buttes and nestled next to the the zoo and Papago Park, it was a great location in the middle of the city for a round of golf and socialization in the nice restaurant afterward. Was so looking forward to the reopening today after some major modifications.  SO DISAPPOINTED. The course is NOT ready for play yet. Overseed is still too immature, construction damage ( ditches, trenches mud) not properly attended too. And the restaurant....bad."}
{"text":"Played here twice during Feb 2016, enjoyed the layout of the course, it lives up to its name you can watch your ball roll off the greens very easily so be careful. The price was right thru Golfnow, the staff were very good from check in to buying the 4 pack after 9 holes. I would give Rolling Hills an 8 out of 10."}
{"text":"One of the best run courses in the state, hands down. Great food deals, great prices... great atmosphere. this course had it all for me. management  couldent be more friendly and helpful. Decent holes!!! well done. RJ, and David,  the managers, are a hoot to deal with. there is nothing they would not give to make sure your experience is top notch. they even have an atm so i can bet with my buddies. well done...."}
{"text":"Great course and very inexpensive. It is located right next to the phx zoo in the heart of the Papago mountains with $10-15 summer rates.   However. The customer service at this place in the golf shop is terrible. I've played here over 5 times now and i cant think of one good thing to say about the young lady working the later afternoons in the golf shop. I usually don't criticize on things like that but it's unacceptable and this course would definitely get 5 stars from me if they invested in a more qualified employee."}
{"text":"Rolling Hills is two executive courses, and great for a quick cheap round of golf.  Totally not an out of towner destination course, but a nice little local fave of mine.  The front nine is the old course, and is a bit like mini-golfing, a fun distraction.  You even get to hear the occasional strange animal sound from the zoo hidden behind the trees along a couple holes.  The back nine is a newer build, and is way more challenging and scenic.  Either way they both give a fantastic view of the valley, and it's a great place to play a quick 9 holes after work in just over an hour  Only eaten at the clubhouse once, but both me and my bud liked our burgers, and it sits next to the 9th green, which is great for a little free entertainment."}
{"text":"For the money and the ease of access this place is amazing!! I played 9 holes for $11 at 4pm in November and had one of the best times I have ever had golfing before.  I didn't use my drivers which forced me to practice with my irons. The greens were really nice and the pro shop guy added that they are even going to get better. Hilly and full of valleys it offers challenging shots... Play it to master your short game. Grab a cooler of beers for around $20 bucks. The views of south mountain during sunset are amazing. Even the zoo animals in the background were a unique addition.  It's not Trune, but for the money and convenience it's better"}
{"text":"Hubby & I play this course occasionally and always have a lot of fun! There's plenty of challenges for being a shorter course, and beautiful scenery!  I must compliment the food today!   We had never made the time to eat here, but after waitng almost 2 hours at a trendy Tempe place before having to leave (still without food) to make our tee time, we were STARVING!   We're glad now, as we discovered this course has delicious food at a very reasonable price! It was served quickly and piping hot, and our server was professional, efficient and kind.   We'll definitely plan our pre-game meal here next time! I doubt we'll be missed at the trendy places! ;-)"}
{"text":"Nice course Arizona style, which means the fairway and greens are green but the rest is very rough like dirt. With that said, it's nice and somewhat challenging. Very good course to walk and well priced. Nice people running the place and nice (non-snooty) fellow golfers. I will definitely play again when I'm in town. Also near(less than a mile) from a cool park, lots of hiking trails, the zoo and botanical gardens for a post-golf activity."}
{"text":"Rolling Hills is great when you want a short, easy course with interesting terrain, good views, and noisy zoo animals.  I believe this course has to be the only golf course in Arizona where you can hear elephants on the third hole.  There is a lot of elevation change on this course.  Many holes require you to hit the green to avoid rolling down a 50 foot hill into a gully.  If you don't want a real serious round, just want to practice your short game (you will encounter some interesting chip shots), and just want to stay close by, Rolling Hills might be a good option for you."}
{"text":"Ok here's our deal: Four guys looking for stuff to do after the A's spring training game lets out. It is only 4pm on Sunday and we have a few hours until it gets dark. Right across the street from Phoenix Muni is this place, the Rolling Hills Course.  We walked in to the shop and the guy there tells us the course is wide open. It was $13 per person for 9 holes. They also require each person to carry a bag, which is very typical. That was kinda a bummer because this essentially doubled the price, as we each had to rent clubs.   The rental clubs were decent and each bag came with balls and tees inside, so we were good to go.  The course was very nice. It was more than just an executive course, having mostly par 4's on the front 9, no fives though.   We had a great time out there and will play here again next spring when we are back."}
{"text":"I get to Glendale a couple times a year and really enjoy playing this course. I have a love-hate relationship with it. Even though it's just an executive course (par 62) I find it delightfully challenging. Most of the greens are located on an elevated area...a hill...so if your ball rolls off, it just keeps going for awhile. There is definitely incentive to work on keeping your drives straight on this course because there are LOTS of hills."}
{"text":"You can't beat the price of $27 to include cart after 12pm. The front 9 is mostly par 3's with some challenging holes. The back 9 opens up a little more with some short par 4's and longer par 3's. Overall, a fun course if you're looking to get out for a quick round with family or friends who are not expecting pristine conditions or country club appeal. Course conditions varied from hole to hole though.  Nice lounge for a beer and hot dog or sandwich after the round. They did have a cart person with some good beer specials too, as well.   If you look up toward the nearby bluffs, you may see some wildlife since this course is right next to the zoo. You'll hear an occassional call or other animal sounds too.  So if you're looking for a quick round to tune up your shot making, this may serve the purpose. I was surprised to play the full 18 in just over 3 hours on the Wed before Thanksgiving, course was busy but moved along. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is a great city course, receives just enough attention not to be terrible, but not too good where it will attract pretentious golf snobs or reason to charge an exorbitant fee.  9 holes and a cart? 13.50.  Can't beat it.  Bring your own refreshments though, as there is no cart lady."}
{"text":"Over the past 10 years, I have been a regular player here and just recently, the clubhouse keeps scheduling other groups interrupting our group play.  This has resulted in verbal arguments between players and long delays.  In general, this is poor golf course management and very unprofessional.  However, the bar staff is top notch!!"}
{"text":"We had a great time at Rolling Hills. Played back 9. Ate in the restaurant. Then played front 9. The service was amazing, all golfers were very friendly! Staff on site today was friendly, attentive, and showed true interest! Was a refreshing since of customer service! I will definitely play this tough but fun and beautiful course!"}
{"text":"Are you a great golfer, looking for a challenge?  Then Rolling Hills is not the course for you.  However, if like me, you are picking up the game, learning the rules, enjoying yourself, and want to spend a glorious day outdoors in Az (Now being the right time to do that!), then Rolling Hills is the perfect choice.  It's very moderately priced, a round with cart is only about $30 (varies by time of year and residency).  The course offers beautiful views of Camelback Mountain, downtown Phoenix, Tempe and Papago Park.  It also is usually not very crowded, though sometimes the rounds can be a little slow (which can happen even at higher priced clubs).  There is usually a beverage cart out (at least on the weekends), and a pretty decent restaurant for your turn snack and post-round meal.  When I play golf, I play here, because of the location and price."}
{"text":"$13.50 to play half the course with a golf cart.  That's a pretty good deal, and you can bring your own cooler filled with booze!  I never liked golfing, but I took on this course with two girlfriends.  We aren't great golfers, but this course is fun to play on and not intimidating at all.  The course is quite pretty too, set against the backdrop of the Papago mountains.  I thoroughly enjoyed attempting to golf while getting drunk.  Next time I'm bringing cigars, then I'll feel like a true golfer."}
{"text":"I've waited long enough to write my review of this gem! I have been bringing my little girl (6 years old) to the Golf Pro, Craig Johnston, for golf lessons for the past few months. I have to admit that we don't really play golf and I was very intimidated. My girl decided she wanted to learn golf and I'm so glad we found Craig and Rolling Hills. When you drive into the parking lot, there is ample parking with some shade trees which is nice. There is a wide gentle sloping entrance up to the pro-shop on the left and the restaurant to the right. They have golf bag holders and shoe scraper thingies around which is nice. Obviously they rent golf carts and the wheeled golf bag holders which I think is standard for any course. There is a driving range and 18-hole course and some of the holes are very challenging with par 3 & 4's. There are water hazards and sand traps to make things interesting and they change the location of the holes on the greens weekly to keep the regulars playing. The course is well maintained by the grounds keepers and the jack rabbits. You might be lucky to see some of the abundant wildlife here which is nice. There is an ecosystem here behind the zoo and as I understand it, there are interesting changes to come. The restaurant serves standard fare and as of yet I have not eaten here so I can't speak to that. The menu is undergoing a complete overhaul so be aware of that, and I've heard rumors of good steaks and burgers, deep fried pickles and lots of other amazing creations to come. The restaurant is casual and has many comfortable tables and tv's around the bar and large panoramic windows which look out onto the course. As it's hot out now, there's not many people out lounging on the patio, but look for that to start happening when it cools off! I hear there will be some decor changes in the near future which will make it even more comfortable and a great place to spend some time instead of, before or after your golf game. The pro-shop is where you pay and they have all kinds of goodies to look into. They have clothes and golf accessories and as I understand they are going to expand their offerings. The staff are friendly and available to help with any  question or concern you might have. The teaching staff are excellent! They have single and group golf lessons. Craig is so patient and kind to my children. My girl's eyes light up when she sees him for her weekly lesson. The stuff she's learned astounds me and he takes it all in stride. One day she decided she wanted to hit all her balls with the putter! Craig said ok, lets do it! She hit every ball from the tee to the fairway with that putter and she learned a very valuable lesson: it's a game and you should always have FUN! I don't think she's going to say Mom, I don't want to play golf anymore because I'm bored or it's not fun anymore. That makes this Mom very happy that my girl has found a positive niche and great role models representing the sport. I am giving this course 4 stars because it's just been taken over by new management and I'm excited to see what's going to happen. I will come back and update when I have some new news to report. So far, I really appreciate what I've seen and am looking forward to continuing my relationship here with this course. FORE!!"}
{"text":"Good go to driving range in Tempe/Phoenix border.  $10 special large bucket of balls with a drink included.  Course and greens are nice as well.  Fun place to work on your short game."}
{"text":"Unless you like putting on something that's equivalent to your living room rug, I'd go somewhere else"}
{"text":"Great short course and yes it has a lot of hills. Challenging short holes. Greens were a little slow to my liking which is why I rated it a 4. The price was great at $30.00 with a cart. Yes you can expect senior golfers. Some are slow but that goes with the turf. Recommend."}
{"text":"Not a bad course! Don't be fooled by the low par and short distance. This is a nice challenging little course, great elevation changes. If you want to work on your short game but still use your driver a couple times this is the place to do it!"}
{"text":"Really a great course, particularly for a municipal course.  It's perfect for beginners (its a VERY short course), but for the price, you can't beat the views and the well-manicured grounds."}
