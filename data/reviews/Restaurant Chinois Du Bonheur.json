{"text":"Place a bit dirty but the food us good! The location is good with a big parking so it is easy to go around! Very good place with friends and family!"}
{"text":"This place isnt too obvious to find because of the odd single number and it is a little hidden. Once you find it, there are tons of delicious food waiting for you. When you see a lot of Chinese eating there, it means this place serves great food. If you see my father who is a Chinese food canoisseur, you know the food is the best in the town! 

We went for a brunch on New Year and there were a lot of people waiting for their table numbers. We waited for about 30 minutes. The service was a little slow on that day but the food was worth it. The ordering system is a little different from the others dim sum places.  You have to order in advance and they Will bring the food in a tray for you. It is not to a bad idea.  We were done in about 30 minutes!

Their dim sums are worth a try and bring a Chinese friend to read the menu."}
{"text":"Nourriture est bonne mais un peu salée. Le goût ressemble vraiment au petit resto en face de chez nous à Beijing :) Portion généreuse, service courtois et rapide. Prix moyen (plat d'accompagnement gratuit!). Il y a aussi un grand stationnement! 

* on est allé à 2pm aujourd'hui (un mercredi), et le resto était pas mal plein. On a déjà voulu essayer leur dim-sum un samedi matin mais la file d'attente était trop longue... donc je recommande d'éviter les heures de pointe :)"}
{"text":"Good food. The Wonton soup is the best I have had. 
We ordered the shrimp in lobster sauce and the Peking duck. Both were good. 
But it is the wonton soup that will make me return when I am back in this area"}
