{"text":"I go here all the time. Aside from them always being out of Mac n cheese, I have no complaints. Foods really good and they give you more than enough"}
{"text":"For my money, this is a great place for a taste of the islands. They make good jerk chicken and they will steam or brown stew many different kinds of fish to your liking. They aren't super fast, but this isn't fast food. I've grown up on Caribbean food and this is pretty good. And, you can eat pretty healthy with their yellow rice and peas and cabbage as a side."}
{"text":"I had the oxtails with rice and peas and cabbage. I didn't particularly care for the cabbage, but everything else was good."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and authentic Caribbean cuisine. Although I usually get my food to go,  I never wait too long and its the Only place I go to get Curry Goat...... it's the best in the City!"}
{"text":"Yum!  I had curried goat and jerk chicken. The curried goat was about as good as I had on the islands last year.  The jerk chicken was more of a wet type with a sauce on top than the dried rub style I am used to, but all was good.  DO NOT LISTEN TO YELP'S DIRECTIONS, it circled me around the block and led to the back side of a hotel.  Google got it right, it is on Woodlawn next to a raw bar and down from The Gentlemans Club (at the other end of the strip mall)."}
{"text":"BEST Caribbean restaurant in CHARLOTTE!!!

Love their curry tofu and vegetarian roti! It's good to know they have vegetarian options! Most Caribbean places only offer rice and peas and cabbage and call that a veggie plate! Haaaaaaa..... But Caribbean Hut has options....yayy!!!  Would love if they always had rum cake in stock :)"}
{"text":"If you have valuable time to waste, come here. If you want to be kept WAITING WHILE being overlooked and ignored by staff, come here. My daughter and I stopped in for lunch, we stood near the entrance WAITING to be greeted and seated...a waitress literally walked past us 3 times and never said a word nor offered seating. The woman behind the counter making food never acknowledged us. One of the owners or managers I assume was standing outside as we entered and he finally, after we'd been waiting 6 mins, walked in pass us and went to the back. My frustration starting to show...the woman behind the counter then says hello how are you and proceeds to take call in orders from telephone calls. Finally, unable to tolerate the LACK OF CUSTOMER SERVICE , we walked out...STILL, no one said anything. I've been to this location before, but this is my first review as I just can't take it anymore. These people are RUDE, they LACK respect for customers and if you are not of West Indian/Caribbean decent there is a total, blatant disregard for your business or your dining satisfaction. The waitstaff is Slow and lacks enthusiasm, management does anything But actually manage the establishment. They've INCREASED their prices but digress in quality service. The food is Decent on a good day but better than it's competitor; however, I'd rather not get my fix of Oxtails than to suffer thru the nasty attitudes and terrible service while spending my hard earned money where it's not appreciated! DINE AT YOUR OWN RISK"}
{"text":"Got the food to take out and I eat Jamaican food all the time the food was not good there were new to make and seasonings the cabbage was half done the oxtails were not tender in the rice is getting a price example parboil not good I was disappointed I don't think I will ever go there again not enough meat to go with all the right ahead and the price jerk chicken was not hot spicy or good won't try it again"}
{"text":"The food is not good at all. My brother n law is Jamaican and it's not even close to authentic Jamaican food, but if u never had real Jamaican food it would probably taste great."}
{"text":"Went here on a recommendation while staying at a nearby hotel. Nice mom and pop type place with really good food. Very small menu of authentic Jamaican food. Got the jerk chicken, spicy and flavorful but watch out for bone fragments. Reasonably priced and friendly service, if you're in the mood for something different you'll be very satisfied."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Stopped here on the way through town. Beef Paddy and Fried Plantains FTW."}
{"text":"Very friendly environment, but it's about the food. Damn that was good, and A LOT of food for 8 bucks!"}
{"text":"Get up and go here! This is some excellent Jamaican food! We were at a hotel around the corner. We were going to go for a burger, but saw this place. So glad we did! Don't miss this one if you are in Charleston!!!"}
{"text":"Really good, authentic, and spicy Jamaican food. The portions are fairly small compared to normal restaurants, and considering how much it costs for a meal, I'd say it's over priced. If the food was half the cost I might decide to go back again and again. Don't expect great customer service or super friendly staff, but when the food is this good, none of that really matters anyway."}
{"text":"They give you a lot of food and it tastes good. The curry goat is very tender and so tasty. It's pretty weird they ask customers if they want to listen to a certain type or watch any movie. Other than that, nothing weird or wrong with my experience. This is now my spot for Jamaican food"}
{"text":"Very clean place and the ppl are very nice. The food was on point and would recommend"}
{"text":"Food is really good but the kitchen was a disaster. They have no organization when it's busy. Watched as 2 ladies held kitchen tickets in their hands and trying to plate one dish at a time. Was going very slow and a big party in there was getting food over the span of about 40 minutes. The first half of the party were done eating before the last few got their dinners. They have good stuff they need the kitchen staff to communicate and figure out a better system to plate multiple dishes at a time other than slapping down everything one at a time then re reading a ticket to figure out the next dish to plate. In other words if you go here have time lots of time to spare."}
{"text":"The oxtail is awesome!  Everything I've had here looks good and tastes fresh.  Service is fast and they accept credit cards. Prices can be a tad bit high, but it's probably one of the best Jamaican restaurants in the city, so it's worth it.  I've been to a few other Jamaican places in the area and either the service isn't good or the food isn't flavorful.  This place is a rare gem."}
{"text":"Great local spot, kinda tucked away in plaza but worth finding. Tried the oxtail and goat combo with rice and peas. Both the goat and oxtail were tender and well seasoned, the rice and peas was cooked perfectly.  Awesome finding a taste of home in N.C."}
{"text":"Food was hot and fresh! Good seasoning like mom's cooking. Place was clean. Servers was very nice"}
{"text":"Good food, we really enjoyed this place with no complaints other then the plantains being cooked to hard.  Oxtails were good, curry chicken, goat and jerk chicken as well."}
{"text":"Really Really good food especially the Jerk Chicken which I love! I found this place by accident someone told me about a burger place in the area so I drove to the area to get a burger from the burger joint but noticed a Jamaican Restaurant next door ....so I was like I have to try this place out! Best move I made :-) ....staff is really friendly and this spot is becoming a weekly visit from me :-) ...enjoy & BLESSINGS!"}
{"text":"Thier food is good if your use to caribbean style food, but great if your not. All of their workers are friendly. I recommend this."}
{"text":"We went yesterday on a whim to try Caribbean Hut. It's been open a month or so. I don't eat Caribbean on a regular basis (as the only ones nearby have been in Charlotte), but do enjoy the food. Theirs was no exception. They serve a variety of meats (chicken, goat, oxtails, etc.) in either the traditional jerk style or curry style as well as BBQ. I had the small jerk chicken, which came with greens and choice of rice (white, yellow, or rice and beans). I chose the rice and beans. The chicken was tasty, spicy, and moist; and, there was plenty of it. The greens were perfectly chopped and not overcooked or overseasoned. The rice was delicious, tender, and flavored. The meal was truly great. Service was excellent. Recommended and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"If have ever lived in or visited Jamaica...you probably dream about the food. Well apparently dreams come true! As soon as you walk in the smell of spices hits you. Bob Marley is lightly signing don't worry be happy in the background. The staff are extremely friendly and the food is literally mouth watering! My only complaint is that I wish I got more meat with my oxtail! Although the meal (with rice, beans, and cabbage) was a healthy portion....I wanted to savor more of that delicious ox tail! My boyfriend got the curry goat, which was also amazing. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I ate here couple of times the food is pretty good but it's over priced. I usually get Oxtails, however they only give you a few piece which is covered in fat it's barely any meat on it. The cashier always have an attitude there's no hospitality in this place. If you're from New York this might be the closest your going to get to some authentic Jamaican food but it's not all that."}
{"text":"We ordered LARGE Oxtail, peas & rice, beef patty Irish moss. 
This is the 2nd time our order is NOT what we requested when we arrived home. We opened our foam white container to find a small, small portion of oxtails with macaroni & cheese. I AM ALLERGIC to dairy so we would not have ordered macaroni and cheese. Smh 
Again we ordered LARGE oxtail, peas & rice WITH cabbage, plantains. INSTEAD we received a small portion of oxtail with peas and rice with macaroni & cheese. We drive about 35/40 minutes to come to this place but never again!! We even asked the lady, was the order correct? She said yes.  I guess it's our fault we should have reopened the bag they tie & checked before leaving the restaurant!! 
Also; two other customers wanted extra oxtails and they said they don't offer sides for that. Suggestion: if customers are willing to pay the price for an extra side of oxtail, then offer it!! Supply and demand will keep your customers coming back for more!!!"}
{"text":"I am giving this place 4 stars because #1 I'm not a experienced Jamaican food taster. I've been to Jamaica but that was well over 5 years ago, so I can't remember exactly how everything tasted.

I tried Carribbean Hut at the Taste of Charlotte. I LOVED their Jerk Chicken with Rice and Peas! Delicious! I loved the spice. It was my kind of spicy esp. I'm from Louisiana. I can say it was spicy because my husband said it was. (He is from South Carolina) 

I hope to go back for more, and maybe also try more of their food. The jerk chicken is a winner though!"}
{"text":"Ahhh!! Tasty Jamaican food in Charlotte! Nice. Oh how I've missed my beef patty and coco bread, chicken roti, curry goat, rice and peas. I went here a few months ago with my daughter who devoured 3 coco breads and beef patties and I had the lunch special of curry chicken, cabbage and rice and peas. It was so good, the prices were right and the service was friendly and fast. 
They have a tv inside and some cozy seating. It's a great take out place too. Now be aware that it's next to a adult \"toy\" store so on the way out I had to divert my daughters eyes with a clever, \"hey, what's that over there?\" She never saw it! LOL! 
I have to give this place a few more visits but so far so good. When I go again, if need be, I'll update my review. 
That is all!"}
{"text":"Great value for the money! We had 2 of the lunch specials and had so much delicious food! The plantains were amazing, great rice and the  chicken was so tender and good."}
{"text":"Great tasty food. Curry goat, oxtail and curry fish are all great. Place gets busy so service was a little slow but the food was great."}
{"text":"Food has its days, some days its great and other days it's mediocre. My only complaints is that the chicken should be grilled longer. Offer collards green more please.  Sometimes the jerk chicken is a little loose in texture for me. I will continue to support and order from this location."}
{"text":"The food here is good jamaican cooking! The collards they serve are a nice alternative to cabbage. Could use a little more meat with the dishes but all in all good food!"}
{"text":"The food is excellent.  The service is very good.  Prices are very reasonable.  If you like Caribbean food you should go there, it is really enjoyable.  GET THE CURRY GOAT."}
{"text":"was excited to try this place out but unfortunetly we didn't even get to try it. 

we walked in on a friday around 1:15pm the place was pretty crowded and it was a long line for to go orders too. we were standing around for awhile because we werent sure if we were supposed to seat ourselves. we found a waitress so we asked her if we should sit and she just said yes sit. so..we found us a seat and sat down. 5 min later no menu, no drinks, no greeting..10min later my husband went to grab us some menu. the waitress said she will be right with us when he saw him grab the menu. 20 minutes later still no waitress to be seen. We were sitting there for 20min with out anyone even greeting us or taking our drink order. we left. very disapointing. If you know you get busy on certain days or time, you need to hire staffs accordingly."}
{"text":"The wait for the steamed Snapper was well worth it.   Everything was fresh and cooked to order.  Fantastic."}
{"text":"The staff was not very friendly,  we were not greeted by anyone and we were expected to know how it worked in the restaurant. We wanted to have a food here but we ordered it the register...supposedly we were supposed to just sit down...we have never been here before so we didn't know that. Staff was kind of rude in letting us know...The food was actually pretty good... Everything but the cabbage...it was under cooked..."}
{"text":"If it was possible I would give this less than one star. My daughter liked her shrimp stir fry. That's the only positive I have to say. The jerk chicken combo, 2 portions of chicken, I originally ordered curry goat n jerk chicken combo, but they were out of goat. Any how the chicken, 2 portions, consisted of 5 pieces of chicken, three parts of drum stick, not the whole drum stick, mainly the grizzled joint and a small chunk of meat. And the two prices of thigh were like the region around the butt area, all bone a sliver of meat. The pile of bones when I was done was greater than the meat I ate. I was constantly picking out bone fragments from the rice. My wife ordered goat and ox tail combo, the goat was 3 small pieces of bone with a ring of grizzle meat around it, each piece of bone was about 1 1/2 inches long. There were three or 4 small pieces of oxtail, you guessed it, mostly all bone. And so those of you who gave it 5 stars had a totally opposite experience. Any how maybe I should have gotten Chubz burgers next door."}
{"text":"Roti & Red Stripe!  This place is legit!  When I lived in Antigua, the main staples of our diet involved rotis & Red Stripe so when we sat down at Caribbean Hut & saw the menu, I immediately thought omg this place is gonna be good

And I was so right - offering something for meat-eaters, veggies & vegans alike our group spanned the range & they delivered

Oxtail plates, veggie rotis, lamb rotis & chicken curry were the orders & the dishes were huge, filling & delish.  Not a group who usually takes away leftovers we could not resist - too much scrumptiousness to leave anything behind"}
{"text":"This review is dedicated to the Roasted Whole Red Snapper. I just want to say...I LOVE YOU! The 45 minutes it took for you to roast was wellllllll worth the wait. I'll never want to eat any other fish again in my life. You were perfect mon! I don't think I will ever be able to understand how they get so much flavor into the fish, and I don't want to. Just keep serving it the way you do. I would have eaten the foil that the fish was wrapped in if I could. Whole roasted Snapper for $17, can't beat that with a stick! Also, you all should hire another waitress. Love the one you have but she needs some help!!!"}
{"text":"I was unhappy with my oxtails and was given a hard time about switching it out for something else. The oxtails were full of fat and meatless, all I wanted was to switch my meat out not the whole meal. They should work on treating their customers better and have better customer service."}
{"text":"Very tasty.  I had goat curry.  Comfortably spicy.  For me a carribean restaurant is a welcome addition to gaston county."}
{"text":"Although the food is great the customer service is disappointing. I come here often to get a plate Togo,  I love their jerk it's nice and spicy  and I'm a huge fan of their cabbage, YUM! I work at a restaurant myself so I know how annoying it could be for guest to walk in so close to closing time which is why I make an effort NOT to go into a restaurant no less than a hour til close, tonight was no different. They close at 10:30 and I arrived at 9:30, which I thought was more than reasonable especially for a take out order, and if you've been here before you know they just scoop the food out of their hot pans into the take out boxes, easy peasy right? Before I could even grab the handle of the door to walk in  I noticed a gentleman inside, he notices me too, he gets to rolling his eyes and shaking his head and as I walk in I hear him mumbling under his breath. I walk out immediately before the door even closes behind me. As a customer that's something that I shouldn't see no matter how frustrated or annoyed you are. I'm there to enjoy your food and give you my money. A customer shouldn't ever feel like they are unwanted in an establishment. After reading the other reviews I see customer service needs some work. Customers keep a business up and running, no the customer isn't always right but you should do everything in your power to make them feel welcomed and happy, I felt neither of those during my experience. DO BETTER CARIBBEAN HUT! Your food is way too good to have such poor customer service!"}
{"text":"I love this place, if you eat caribbean, most of it has bone attached, the atmosphere is great and the food is even better, so far this is the best caribbean place I have been in Charlotte. I have eaten a lot of crap from these so called caribbean retaurants and on top of that you dont get a lot of food for the money that your paying. I will not go to another caribbean resturant except here.The staff is friendly and make you feel welcome."}
{"text":"Twas delicious. If you are not in a hurry and dining in, go ahead and take a seat. The \"place order here\" on the right is for takeout. Got the small curry goat ($11). It came with rice (choice of yellow rice or the rice with beans, red kidney) two pieces of yummy firm plantains, and veg of the day. Today was collards that was delish. Friends got the weekday lunch special, any of the small chicken dishes for $6 and change, they got the jerk chicken and everyone cleared their plates and all that was left was the chicken bones.

They only have one server servicing about eight tables, it took us a while to place the order, food came out in about five minutes (awesome), and then it took us a while again to get our checks after we had finished. Knocked off a star because it made our visit way longer than it needed to be and we were itching to get back to work.

Definitely will be back, might opt for take out next time tho."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, and very helpful staff, reasonable prices, definitely go! And get the chicken patties and combo"}
{"text":"Have gotten the oxtail plates. Pretty good. Sauce is a little sweet so I wouldn't recommend submerging your rice in it. 

Place actually closes at 10pm! Not 10:30 like it says here."}
{"text":"We decided to branch out for lunch and try something new.  Caribbean food was at the top of the list and I liked the look of the Caribbean Hut, so we decided to give them a chance.  We walked in and stepped up to the counter where it says \"order here.\"  We were told that we could sit anywhere and we'd be helped.  I wasn't expecting a full-service restaurant, but okay.  

We each started with Jamaican sodas -- a ginger beer and a cream.  The cream was good; it was sweet.  And I loved my ginger beer.  It wasn't like ginger ale; it was more like sweetened carbonated water with a lot of ginger spice, giving it a small kick!  

For entrees, they offer small and large versions.  The small was plenty of food.  Thankfully, that's what we ordered.  We both tried the jerk chicken entree.  It came with either yellow or white rice or rice and beans, as well as a veggie.  I assumed the yellow was the traditional Caribbean rice, so that's what we went with.  The rice was excellent; it was full of flavor.  The collard greens were pretty tasty, too.  A jerk marinade covered the chunks of chicken, and had a kick to it as well.  The only downside with the meal was that the chicken was still on the bone with fat and skin.  I'm not really a bone, fat, and skin kind of guy.  I like the meat.  Just meat.  Otherwise, it becomes work and I'm biting into things that I'm not supposed to be biting into.  It makes the meal less enjoyable.  We didn't feel like we got our money's worth meat-wise.   Loved the rice and veggie, but it would have been much, much better to have boneless chicken breast cut up and marinated in the jerk seasonings.

The restaurant itself didn't have a lot of atmosphere, but it did have a lot of windows, which made it nice during the daytime to catch the sunlight.  Jamaican/Caribbean music played on the speakers and our server was very sweet and friendly.   Then there's the pricing.  $8-$10 an entree for dinner is great.  For a quick lunch, not so much so.  Our lunch for two with tax and tip came to $26.  That's a little excessive for a strip mall restaurant during a work lunch break."}
{"text":"The fruit punch they have is really good. I love ginger so I loved that it had ginger in it and wasn't just koolaid fruit punch. It taste nice and fresh with the ginger. The lemonade is also really good. I got curry chicken. It's was pretty good. Not the best but it was good and tender. I like the way they prepare their cabbage"}
{"text":"I have a great experience everytime I come here. This was my the first time coming on a Friday evening and I enjoyed the love music.  The servers are always pleasant and helpful. I can't forget the food is always great I am never disappointed."}
{"text":"Great hot food, didn't have any more beef patties but that was ok, the goat, cabbage, stew chicken and everything was great and so was the service"}
{"text":"This is the only Caribbean restaurant I have tried in Charlotte, but I grew up in South Florida where Caribbean food is all over, so I have had a lot of it.  I almost always have the brown stew chicken here, because it is SO good.  I've also tried the curry chicken and jerk chicken, which were also excellent.  

They have a great lunch special during the week that is a great value for the amount and quality of food you get.  The lunch special is under $6 and comes with rice an a side of either cabbage or collard greens.  Which you get seems to just depend on what they make that day.  I don't think you have a choice, but both are good.  The collard greens are the best I've had anywhere, although I have not had them many places as I always thought I wouldn't like them.  You have a choice on the rice, either rice and beans or yellow rice.  Authentic Caribbean places call it rice and peas, but I think they wisely call it rice and beans to not confuse American customers.

One of the telltale signs of a good ethnic restaurant is when you see people of that ethnicity in there a lot and that is the case with this place.  If you go in around lunch time there are always a few people sitting at the bar (I don't think they serve alcohol, but they have a few stools at a bar in the front) and you'll almost certainly hear an island accent from them.  If people who know the real deal authentic food eat there, it's a good sign to me.

If you like their food you will find that they treat their regulars very well.  The first couple of times I got takeout there I felt the service was pretty slow, but since I have become a regular (I get takeout probably 1-3 times a week) I don't even have to order anymore.  

Overall I love this place and the only reason I haven't tried everything on their menu is because I like my regular brown stew chicken so darn much.  The next thing I am going to try there is their meat patties.  I hear they're hot, so if you order them keep that in mind."}
{"text":"I stayed at a hotel on Woodlawn to be closer to the airport after spending the previous four days uptown. Being the self-proclaimed foodie I am, the first thing I did upon arrival was start looking for places to eat. After doing a Yelp search, I realized most places in the area had three or less stars (not a good look). When I stumbled upon Caribbean Hut, I noticed it had 4 (I believe). Knowing what I know, I know not all Caribbean people make good Jamaican food. So I started looking at the individual reviews. I saw enough positive comments to make this my dinner choice for the night. Upon arrival, the first thing I noticed (besides the music) was the young man inside cleaning (always a good sign). The second thing I noticed was the smell. There was a slight hint of food, but it didn't smell like an overwhelming greasy spoon smell. It smelled like good food and that worked for me. After pondering for a few, I noticed traffic beginning to pick up, so I knew it was about to be on. I settled on the oxtails and curry goat with rice and peas. Let me just say I was NOT disappointed. Best Jamaican food I've had in a long time. And I was craving it. My only two complaints about this place were they didn't have any beef patties (only chicken) and the curry goat was a tad salty. Yes, I was in a beef kinda mood that night. Next time I'm in Charlotte, I'm going back. Thumbs up."}
{"text":"The curry and jerk chicken were great as was the rice and beans. The fried plantains were perfectly fried and tasted nice and sweet. Everything was seasoned to perfection and the service was good. I will most definitely be back. Keep it up Hut!"}
{"text":"The food and staff are excellent!! The young man at the counter greeted us warmly and happily answered some questions we had about menu items. We tried the oxtail and goat combo, jerk chicken, and the moss drink as they seemed to be the popular choices. The food was very flavorful with lots of spice and aromatics. The restaurant itself was nice and clean. 

This is definitely our go-to place in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Super yummy food!! I had the chicken combo meal, and it came with rice and beans and steamed cabbage for $11. The waitress was really nice :)"}
{"text":"My husband orders to go here all the time. Today I finally joined him for lunch at the restaurant.  The food is DELICIOUS! The service was great and they were fast."}
{"text":"Really, the only reason why this place isn't getting 5 stars is because I've never really had Caribbean food before (save a Caribbean vegan joint, but it was vegan, so not so comparable). So just based on first impressions, lovelovelove this place!

+ Friendly, attentive, and accommodating service that doesn't overdo it.
+ HUGE portions.
+ Lunch specials are always a plus!
+ Just the right amount of spice! Not crazy hot.
+ A jerk chicken with a nicely soupy sauce with deep flavors.
+ Goat soup that is simple, but so flavorful and really hits the spot if you're craving goat.
+ Flavorful tofu/vegetarian dishes.
+ Discovered SORREL. OMG. Love this red gingery drink.
~ My mom was disappointed by the callaloo but I thought it was tasty! The roti was large but we could have used another in proportion to the amount of callaloo we got. (Again--large portions!)
- Some of the dishes were a tad on the salty side--in a way that was delicious (because I like salt) but could limit other peoples' appetites

Atmosphere is cozy and unassuming, kind of hole in the wall-y feel--lots of reggae and large posters of Caribbean greats. Because of this it seemed like it was more of a fast-food kind of place, but it's actually sit-down (or take-out)! It's the kind of place that you'd stop by with friends to catch up and have a comforting meal in good company.

Would definitely come back to this place. Caribbean cuisine, you've gained a fan in me!"}
{"text":"I happened to be in the University area recently around lunch time, so I quickly checked my Yelp App to see what dining options were nearby.  I found this place and decided to check it out.  When I pulled up in the parking lot, I had a bit of a dilemma as there was a Middle Eastern place right next door... but I decided to check out the Caribbean Hut since I have great Middle Eastern food in my neighborhood but no Caribbean/Jamaican places.  

So, I walked in and found that this place is one of those spots where you go up and place your order at the counter.  I quickly scanned the menu board and decided to go with jerk chicken. I asked and the girl behind the counter & she said it was served with beans & rice.  Ok - sounds good so far.  I wasn't sure about portion sizes, but I decided to go with the smaller portion size.  

When my food came out, I was disappointed to see three little tiny pieces of chicken (which were mostly bone), rice  with only a couple of sparse beans mixed into the rice, and about half the plate was made up of some sort of slaw (WTH- she didn't tell me slaw came on the plate! I hate slaw, yuck!)  It did have 2 slices of plantains, which were tasty. 

When I dug into it, things didn't really get any better.  The jerk chicken was not very delicious - I was quite disappointed in both the subdued flavor and the terrible cut of \"meat\"...it was like 3 little chicken wings that hardly had any meat whatsoever on it.  Definitely not what I was expecting. 

 I was expecting to dig  into a plate of wonderful calypso rice with  beans & a flavorful jerk chicken with plenty of spicy flavor. But this was just sad.  Based on the other reviews, maybe I just caught them on a bad day, but the experience was so disappointing that I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"I love the butter shrimp and the plantains. The restaurant as a whole seems very authentic, but I wouldn't really know... very tasty though, and the service is great."}
{"text":"As I review this. The jerk chicken was probably three stars. The pricing to stars. Atmosphere was two or three stars any fun if you like it or not...
The jerk chicken I got was average. And the plantings were like wax paper. When I answer manager at the front door with it. The service is probably substandard. They come back again.
Only if I desperately wanted to give him another chance, and to try a different menu item."}
{"text":"Fresh and good.  Jerk Chicken did have a lot of bones. Get the large."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this restaurant and it will probably be my last. The restaurant was clean and everyone was nice and personable. We ordered over $40 worth of food to go. I get home and my order is wrong. So I had to get back in my car to return the wrong item. 

I love Jamaican food and this food was just ok. We ordered curry chicken, curry goat, oxtails and a shrimp stir fry that is made to order. The curry goat and the oxtails were tough. They need to let them simmer longer to not only add flavor but also to make the meat tender. The shrimp stir fry was 75% cooked onions and the shrimp was over cooked. The only thing that we did enjoy about the meal were the rice and peas and the cabbage. I am disappointed because this place is close to my house. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"The food was great! Plantains weren't that sweet but I got a large curry chicken with rice & beans and cabbage. Could've gotten more church for it to be a large but the total with a cola cake to about $14. Didn't have to wait long for the to go order! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Just yum. Need more chicken and less bone!!!! Bought 2 chicken roti and was floored by flavor in Charlotte! To think I was ready to hop a plane to head to Brooklyn NY's Nio on Church/Rogers for a roti but can find a comparable roti in Charlotte, NC? Very appreciated. The skins were tasty although I like a lot more Dahl in my roti skin. The chicken was tender and juicy enough for me to overeat and be mad at myself later on. The potatoes were also nicely curried. Love that carrots weren't substituted for potatoes. Staff was cool. Loved the young teen behind the counter who is clearly learning working ethics. She was cute enough to listen to how roti skins were made with yellow split peas not chick/garbanzo. If you are from Trinidad or used to eating in Trinidadian restaurants, you know chana. You know chana is given as an option to be put over your curry filling. Chana is actually garbanzo/chick peas. Here it is Jamaican cooking and no chana option. I don't like chana anyway so that was lovely. My only issues with this place so far? There isn't a venue south of Charlotte airport and too much bone-more chicken needed. Also got my order at 1:25pm on a Thursday and received my 2 chicken rotis in 15min or less. All Caribbean restaurants will take time so this was quick. I took 3 pictures of my chicken roti including inside the skin...so please view. But next time I visit, I will scrutinize that ladle to make sure no bones added!"}
{"text":"Flavors for oxtail and curry goat combo were cool. Did not like they did not have Roti skins nor did the little guy know what Dhalpuri was!!! And then the tiny little 2 strips of plantain and how about meat with your bones? Smdh... I will go to other places for Roti and head to Atlanta for other things. This will be my last resort."}
{"text":"Pretty good.  Being from South Florida and use to the best Caribbean food, I wasn't blown away by the Jerk Chicken, but I was told, this is the best that we will get in Charlotte..so I guess....  
The woman at the register seemed angry at the world."}
{"text":"I'm from BK NY so I know Carribean food. This place is ok. Could be better. I will try something else next time because I want to give them the benefit of the doubt. They are open late during the week"}
{"text":"I love this place I've eaten there several times and it is consistent. My favorite is the Curry Goat."}
{"text":"customer service isn't all that great.. I've been here a handful times and the service can be slow. Other than that, the food is delicious!!! My favorite is the ox tail!!!"}
{"text":"Very flavorful jerk chicken. Actually the best I've ever had . There are bone fragments, though, but that adds to the authenticity, I suppose. My dinner partner had goat and chicken... Raved about his meal. I would happily return if I didn't live 800 miles away."}
{"text":"Service sucks, but food is ok. DO NOT order any item with Roti i.e flat bread. It used to be excellent until couple of years ago, but something changed. Some parts of the roti are literally uncooked. Without exaggeration, i can say it is just dough"}
{"text":"Food is nice! I do think that it can have a little more Seasoning. Customer service was OK. I had oxtail, rice and peas, and steam cabbage. I paid $16.00 for the large plate even though there were only about 5 small pieces of oxtail. I'll try the curry chicken next time."}
{"text":"Stopped in today for lunch to go. $15 for a large oxtail lunch, but well worth it. The sauce is always so fresh and full of flavor. Service was fast. Next time I will try the beef or chicken patties."}
{"text":"So for starters , I am not on any level or any kind of expert on Caribbean food but boy let me tell you.. This place straight up blew me out of the way! I was shockingly surprised and beyond satisfied with my meal! For like 10 bucks I tried not only the famous jerk chicken, but also the curried chicken. Until the other day I had never tried either one of those foods at all. I will absolutely go back and visit here again. I really did love it! And they've got an amazing homemade drink called Irish Moss there too! Last but not least, I am quite hesitant when it comes to trying strange, new or weird foods but I urged up enough courage to try my friends curried goat and ox tails and just for the record. I would've never known either one would have turned out that good. This place may not look like your fine dining sort of place , but you surely do get what you pay for and it really was absolutely delicious! I cannot wait to go back. Two thumbs up Caribbean Hut!"}
{"text":"Great Caribbean food done right!  The hut is always, always, always consistent with their food, quick in and out service with a smile.  I've never had a bad meal here and the curry chicken is some of the best around.  Most meals come with rice and peas, plantains and mixed veggies or greens.  They're in a strip mall off of North Tryon before the Mallard Creek intersection.......give them a try."}
{"text":"Oxtails here are to die for! The stir fry shrimp and curry goat is also good here. I don't care too much for plaintains so I ask for extra cabbage instead. The employees here have always been very nice and helpful. A must try if you've never had it."}
{"text":"Loved the Jerk Chicken. Was definitely spicy, how I like it. Looking forward to future visits. They also have an assortment of Jamaican beverages, alcoholic and non-alcoholic."}
{"text":"Would give 5 stars but I had a few issues at this location. Their menu is generic. All locations have the exact menu board but not all locations serve everything. That's misleading. The food is delicioussssss. They should have a choice of dry rub jerk meats or saucy. Did I say food was delicioussss lol. It is!!! Serving platters are too huge which gives the illusion you're getting a lot more than what you're actually getting. I'll be going back."}
{"text":"Found this small restaurant (as well as their Morrocan neighbor) on Yelp*.  Wonderful Jamaican food with much of what you'd expect from that region.  Ordered both the Curry Goat and Curry Chicken Roti.  Portion sizes were spot on, and the flavors were deep without too much heat--both delicious!.  I will return and sit at the counter, order some different food and observe the day-to-day confluence of patrons.  I like this place!"}
{"text":"Had the jerk chicken and oxtail combo. Food could have been a little hotter temperature wise but it was very tasty"}
{"text":"Combo plate, oxtails & curry chicken with rice & peas and cabbage. While the food was delicious....2 pieces of chicken and 4 small pieces of oxtail for almost $20 is unacceptable. I really want to love this place (both locations) but I've had several bad experiences . 2 stars is for the taste of the food. It's been a struggle trying to find a legit Caribbean spot that gets it. We ordered 4 plates via phone to go, 3 oxtail plates and my combo plate...literally lacking the meat portion for all four plates and well over a $60 check."}
{"text":"This place used to be great but it has gone downhill since. They're always out of items and the prices recently went up on some things on the menu. Forget service, dry. A ramp up is definitely needed as they will continue to lose business. Don't get me wrong, the food tastes great, when they have it but I'm currently in search for another go to Jamaican restaurant :("}
{"text":"I've only been here once. But as far as I can see, their only disadvantage is that they're right next door to the fantastic Casablanca Cafe. It's just so hard to turn down Moroccan lamb couscous just feet away. Hence why I've only been here once. But enough about Casablanca. This is about cheap and cheerful Caribbean food, a cuisine that's sadly underrepresented in Charlotte. And why is that? We seem to love soul food. And Caribbean is like soul food, only with more fish, less of a dependence on deep-frying and a more diverse palette of fruits, herbs and spices, owing to its tropical origin and influences from China and India. There's nothing wrong with pork fat and hot sauce. But is there anything that's not improved with scotch bonnet peppers, mango or ginger? I humbly submit to you, dear reader, that there is not. 

As I've only been once, I can't make too many recommendations. I had the jerk chicken with yellow rice, plantains and cabbage. It was cheap, delicious and the portions were very generous. I did however get a sly peek at some of the foods other diners had ordered and it all looked fantastic, almost to the point of making me regret what I'd ordered. I suspect you couldn't go wrong by throwing caution to the wind, closing your eyes and pointing to a random spot on the menu. Unless, of course you're freaked out by the idea of eating goat or oxtail.

One thing you should not leave to fate is your choice of drink. They sell Ting, the impossibly refreshing D&G produced Jamaican soda made with real Jamaican grapefruit, real cane sugar and tears of sheer rapturous joy. If you come here and don't order a Ting, so help me, I will find you, corner you and mercilessly mock your lack of taste and good judgement. You have been warned."}
{"text":"I've tried most of the Caribbean restaurants in the Charlotte area and I've got to say that the Caribbean Hut has been the best thus far. Granted this review is based on my first, the flavor and deliciousness were amazing enough for me to be confident in saying it's the best!

I ordered the chicken combo special (Jerk & Curry), with rice and beans and cabbage. The large cost under $15 and the portions were enough for 2 meals (a good amount of food). I knew the food was good because I couldn't stop eating it, even though I knew I was full. The jerk chicken was spiced just right with a subtle kick. The curry chicken was moist and flavorful. Every thing tasted so good. The grub was on par with my favorite Caribbean restaurants in Brooklyn and even my parents food (don't tell them I said that.)

This place is located in a strip mall and I would have never thought to venture there if not for checking Yelp. I'm already planning on visiting Caribbean Hut more often and will take advantage of their lunch specials. Next on deck: oxtails and the roti. I hope to have another 5 star flavor experience."}
{"text":"The good:
- Jamaican food for Jamaican people
- If you are not Jamaican, you will be alone
- food is authentic
- very cheap
- yamman!

The bad:
- can you order in Patois?
- not a pretentious place"}
{"text":"Not very impressed; food was ok if you like it saucy, they were out of beef patties and the service was out right bad"}
{"text":"Call your food in and it will be hot and ready wh n you get there. And there Irish moss is to dye for. Love the food and derives. I highly recommend this spot"}
{"text":"Had the jerk chicken with plantains yellow rice and cabbage. The absolute worst customer service experience, the Jamaican guy didn't pay attention to who was next to order, nothing seemed cooked to order but was more buffet style. The decor was unpleasant. The Jamaican guy seemed outta place inattentive and all around made you feel like you were an inconvenience to come into their establishment. The food was good, but could've been better. I probably would never go back here or recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Food is good and the fish is made to order. Ordering is a little out of wack but I can say if you order the fish, it's cooked to order so be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"This place has been open about 3 weeks now, situated right beside the new location of Dynasty Buffet in Franklin Square. They have 2 other locations in Charlotte. The staff is very welcoming, and the atmosphere is great. A portrait of Bob Marley was hanging on the wall, Island music was playing on the speakers, and Jamaican colors were lighting up the interior. The food is also authentic.

I had the Small Oxtail and Curry Goat Combo for $14 ($17 for a large). The Small is actually a hearty portion of food. All entrees are served with rice, vegetables, and plantains. For rice, options include white rice, yellow rice, and rice and beans. Vegetable of the night was cabbage. Unfortunately, only 2 plantain pieces are included. It was odd to receive a plate consisting of 1/3 rice, 1/3 vegetables, and then only TWO pieces of plantains - one of these is not like the others......Anyway, the Oxtail is fantastic. It is made stew-style and has just a hint of spicy to it. Great flavor! The green Curry Goat tastes like lamb and gets spicier and spicier as you eat more and more of it. Mix the rice with the sauces from the meat - you'll be glad you did! Consider ordering some Coco Bread for $1.50 to sweep up the sauce. I had it nice and hot, with steam still rising out of it. It is starchy like a dinner roll, and has a bit of sweetness to it as well. Overall, my meal was great. However, it appears that none of the meats are boneless, and sometimes the bones are annoyingly small to pick out. I'd also prefer more plantains with my meal, instead of having to order an additional side. Their alcoholic beverages license is also pending, so all of the alcoholic drinks on their menu are currently unavailable."}
{"text":"I've driven past this place many times and decided to give it a try with my hubby for lunch. I had the ox tail and curry chicken combo and he had the ox tail and goat combo. We both ordered a small, and received a plateful. Everything was amazing. The proteins were out of the world. Veggies were cooked perfectly and NOT mushy. Great add ons.. Plantains and coco bread. 
The waiter was on top of everything. Glasses stayed filled. 
This is a great place to sit down, relax, and enjoy a meal or call in your order, grab and go!
They also offer lunch specials, just ask!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times and this is authentic Jamaican cuisine.  Been from Jamaica, I think I know something about my country's food and culture.  If you aren't satisfied with the portions, just ask for more and they'll deliver.  By the way, if you are not familiar with our cuisines, save your say for somewhere else.  I love curried chicken and the way it's always chopped up. Bone and all. If you want curried breast, just ask. Just remember that curried chicken is chopped up and may not have a lot of meat.  That's our culture. I had the Curried Goat and I must say that this is as good as it gets.  Definitely hits the spot and satisfies my craving for some good Jamaican food.  Mmmmm...I'm going there now to get some more.  Meet me there.  Let's eat!"}
{"text":"Probably better than 4 yelp stars!  First of all I had never heard of this place and my plan was to eat somewhere else in the neighborhood (the other place was not opened for lunch so I walk in for directions and the Chef asks me if I know about Caribbean Food and really I do not if he said Jamaican or Haitian Food (only had a little of each) I couldn't have said very much more.  So the Chef says: \"I want you to taste this\"  (Fortune Favors the BOLD) so if you know me and especially if you no me, you'll know this is impressing me!  He brings over a small plate with three samples and does not tell me what they are, until I'm almost finished.  Curry Chicken (I guessed that one) and give it 4 yelp stars!  Another Chicken Dish with Brown sauce? Maybe? and OX Tail with a similar Brown Sauce.  Both of these with the Brown Sauce were Better than the Curry Chicken.  The Ox Tail (first time I have ever eaten OX Tail and it was one vertebrae section, bone still in) was very nice, a very fine flavor!  I WILL BE EATING Ox Tail Again!!!! 

Impressed so I stayed!  Ordered a Lunch Special Jerk Chicken which came with Rice and a Cabbage Salad!  He told me the \"Jerk Sauce is spicy, Do You like spicy?\". So he gave me a bite and it tasted perfect!  This Jerk Chicken was very good, he put enough Sauce on it to go with the Rice.  The Sauce gets 4.5 stars.  The Cabbage Salad and rice were alright and I'm glad I got to taste them!  Next time I would probably get Plantains and Ox Tail and maybe more Jerk Chicken if I'm not by myself!

Impressive Service!  Most of the Patrons were regulars they would walk in say hello to the Chef and he would bring them a drink before they asked, then they would speak to me and tell me I would get used to the spice were quickly.  They were all speaking Jamaican to each other with a slightly different accent speaking to me!  Everyone was served speedy faster than a speeding ticket!"}
{"text":"Right off the bat, let's drop the pretense: you're not here for the ambiance. What you are here for is damn good Jamaican food, in a town devoid of other options. They make their own patties. They have cocoa bread. The ox tail and curried goat are out of sight. Even the veggies that come with the entrees are fantastic: cooked, but firm and delicious. And the jerk is yummy. All the sauces are rich and you can tell that they've been making this food for generations. If you're nearby and it crosses your mind, go for it; you won't be let down."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed in this restaurant. The jerk sauce had a decent flavor, but the rest of the meal (rice. veggies.) were totally uninsipired and tasteless. The beef patty tasted like it was straight from the frozen box. One friend got the curry shrimp and she said the curry sauce was tasty. Other friend got the jerk chicken I believe and has to pick around bones. I would not visit here again."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. I've never written a review but the guy spoke to me so badly on the phone I just thought I'd let it be know. They'd never get my business. The phone isn't even authentic Caribbean and its prepared poorly"}
{"text":"Hubby and I went there today for lunch, I  had there jerk chicken with rice,peas and cabbage,  he had the chicken roti, and I have to say it was really good. The staff was really friendly. Price was reasonable.. I also had a red velvet cake and chicken Patty to go. I  will definitely recommend this place to anyone wanted to try jamaican food in the charlotte area."}
{"text":"Whoa, this place is amazing!!!!! Fast, perfectly seasoned, delicious food, omg I've finally found a Jamaican spot in Charlotte!!!!!! Fucking thrilled!!!!! So good, had the curry chicken, small, with a to go plate!!!! Yes!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I try to eat her at least once a week. The food couldn't be any better."}
{"text":"We were passing through and decided to try this joint based on the reviews here. Not impressed! We decided to dine in but quickly changed our minds because of the attitude of our server.  Very unpleasant disposition! I don't know about anyone else but if I'm going to patronize an establishment, regardless of the hour I expect to be welcomed and treated well.  Ordered to go instead. .. Had the curried goat and Jerk Chicken. ... Not impressed! The curried goat was fiery! Okay,,don't even start with the \"what else did you expect\" argument because pepper can be used to just add flavour not to make one cry!  You don't have to use so much pepper when cooking.  It had no other flavor. The Jerk Chicken was more like a tasty Brown stewed chicken. 
It helped stop our hunger somewhat but don't think we'll return. ..  and btw, I'm yardie!"}
{"text":"Service was horrible. Some of the options on the menu they were out of. When I selected my vegetable( collard greens) they gave me cabbage which I did not ask for. Then the waitress said 'oh they must be out'. Rice was cold and meat was mostly bone. They did only charge us for one plate because we were not satisfied."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Caribbean restaurants on the south side. Most places are only on the North. I haven't tried the others since I live on this side of town but I'm a New Yorker and I know good Jamaican food and this place is it. Their food is always fresh and good. They're jerk anything is usually sweet mixed with spicy, which I've come to like. Wish it would lose the sweetness though. They haven't dumbed down their ingredients to suit the southern folks who may not truly get good Caribbean taste and flavor. So that makes me happy. Also I have noticed that their prices are more reasonable and they have a lunch price. It usually makes me upset when I go to Caribbean restaurants other than NYC because they up their prices in the South all around."}
{"text":"Jamican patties got my and my friend both sick after eatting. Thought it just might be me but girlfriend didn't feel well after eatting leftovers . To be fair the staff was very friendly and it's clean and not grimy"}
{"text":"The food is very good, especially the jerk chicken. It's very authentic food. Also $5.95 lunch chicken special, can't beat that!!! 

However, the serve sucks!!!!!! No smile at all, water left empty til I asked for more. I asked for more rice, but takes him forever to get it. So I cancelled it because there's no point for the rice when my meat is all gone. But the server make this stupid face and shook his head. 

I will go back for take out, but not dine in."}
{"text":"A great little restaurant. I'm vegetarian, and while most of their food is meat and thus I can't review it, their vegetarian curry was delicious. Two options for the rice (yellow or white with peas, I opted for the second). Fried plantains were a nice extra touch.
We got there at 10:00 on a slow Monday night, and the server was on her way out. The woman behind the counter said she could serve us at the counter, which was a bit tall, even with the tall stools (it's the way they make them these days, but I don't have to like them).
Overall, I'd say it was a great experience. Yumm, yumm."}
{"text":"Omg!!!!!! This place is one of the best in the Charlotte area!!!!!

     First off... When you step in, you are greeted by a waitress who is ready to seat you at your table, as well as eager to get you fed and squared away! 
     Second....I have been to almost \"EVERY\" Caribbean restaraunt in Charlotte, but this one is my favorite. And I will be honest, it's sheerly because of the authentic taste THAT IS CONSISTENT 24/7!!!!!!!!!
       I have been to a number of other carribean restaurants in the Charlotte area whose taste change periodically, which is my pet peeve. 
      The verdict is that this place is not big on flash and glam. But it's big on taste AS WELL AS CONSISTENCY. Oh...and didn't I mention the large portions that they give you???? TRUST ME YOU WON'T ME DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!! GO THERE TODAY!!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious! One time I came here and we had a waiter that seemed somewhat high. I ordered a fish soup, and he forgot that I ordered it. I reminded him, he apologized, and then he gave me a twelve dollar sampler for free. I ended up taking the fish soup that I ordered home without eating it there, and enjoyed it later. I guess that would have made some people upset, but seriously I ordered $3.00 worth of food and received $15.00 worth of food instead. Plus it was all delicious. How I miss you, Caribbean hut!"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Caribbean Hut! I use to eat at the one on Tryon every week, so I know how the food should look and taste. 

After calling in my order 10 minutes prior to arriving, my food was ready upon my arrival. I headed back to work just knowing I was about to devour some deliciousness. I was truly disappointed as the curry chicken, looked and tasted NOTHING like true curry chicken. Curry has a pretty golden color. This curry chicken was orange in color, bland and tasted slimy.The rice and peas and plantains were dry.

I expected more- more flavor! 

Note: This was my 2nd time at this location. The first time was when they first opened up the Woodlawn location some time ago. I gave them a second chance, because I hoped they had worked out the kinks. Unfortunately, not. 

I will continue to dine at Caribbean Hut because in my opinion, they have the best Caribbean food in Charlotte- it will just be at the Tryon location instead."}
{"text":"This is sooooo authentic. I know this because my boyfriend is from the Caribbean and he validated it. He had the jerk chicken and I had the curry. Both dishes were sooooo flavorful. The veggie of the day was cabbage and it was incredible. The rice was incredible too. I tried the sorrel and it is sooo sweet and delicious. I can't wait to go back. Support local."}
{"text":"Allot of big good portions. Nice area and friendly people. The oxtail was the best! So tender and great flavor."}
{"text":"The smell from all the food is what made us walk in.  and so clean.  The rice and peas was so good and the jerk chicken and sauce was amazing!  The oxtail left me a little disappointed though. It was a bit tough.  Could have cooked longer.  The server was a bit rude I felt like I was being  rushed, like I was wasting his time with my questions About His.food... nice location and plenty of parking. I would do it again  but hopefully he lady that was serving the patrons that were dining in would be up front serving. She was so nice"}
{"text":"Curry chicken , rice & peas, cabbage, side of mac and cheese....listen I ain't mad!!! Living in South Charlotte, Carribean food is Hard to come by!!! I would Always have to travel to North Charlotte jus to eat good. So Yes I'll definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"I came here following a 10 hour stint at Carowinds. I was in the mood for some good ole
Caribbean food, so we opted to try this place on the way to our hotel. The resteraunt is small but had a good vibe, wall decor consisted of Bob Marley pics etc. We arrived at 8:30, so seating was not a problem. I ordered the Oxtails and curry goat combo plate. It did not take long for our food to arrive (maybe 10min or less). My entree included rice and beans that were flavorful and the rice was cooked perfectly. A cabbage mix also came with it but they ran out of sweet plantains that day (bummer). The oxtails were some of the best I've ever had and the sauce had a hint of sweetness, which I loved. The sauce from the oxtails pairs well with the rice and cabbage. Delicious! As for the curry goat, it was way too salty! I was disappointed as I love curry goat, but whatever spice they used, they added too much that day. Sad to say because I truly feel this establishment can make a great curry goat, but it's hard to enjoy a dish that you feel is just, too salty. With the missing plantains and the salty curry goat, that's the only reason I voted 3 stars. With that being said, I would definitely return to try other dishes because I enjoyed everything but the salty curry goat. The service was great too!"}
{"text":"For the past two years, I have come here once in a great while when I actually drive into work. I like the price of their lunch specials, around $9 for the small plate. Decent amount of rice, meat, and veggies. I usually order Jerk chicken. Sometimes I go with Curry chicken. Both are good to me. I am no expert on Jamaican food, but I like the sweet and spicy of what I eat here. I always pair it with a Jamaican Cream soda since it taste just like a Kola Champagne. I leave satisfied and stuffed.

The servers have always been polite and attentive. Never had a problem.

Lunch rushes can be crazy so be prepared to wait in a line for carry-out orders."}
{"text":"Food is wonderful.  Service can be slow and sometimes the TV is too loud.  But, I've never been disappointed with the food.  It's delicious!"}
{"text":"Dodging drunks coming in and out of Stool Pigeons, I decided to stop in on this small place. I did not see one person. The sign on the outside promised Caribbean (Jamaican) food. From the time I opened the door, I could smell nothing but the flavors from the island, the jerks, curries, and many other island favorites. 

     Looking at the menu, I see the prices are extremely low, and still , not one person (I realized why, they just opened). So I ordered the Jerk Chicken of course, that had a rich dark sauce. My wife had the Ox Tail, the sauce also was so good, you would want to drink it from a straw. 

     Do not let this little place in a strip mall fool you. They have very good and authentic foods, that will tantalize every taste bud that you have or wish you had. CAUTION! , if you have no idea what Jamaican food is or want a piece of square fish or chicken McNugget's do not go here. This is the real deal. Do not take my word for it. Try it for yourself. And... Do not drool on the keyboard while you are looking at the pictures."}
{"text":"When I came here on November 2014, the curried goat was $8.00, and it was delicious! When I came here on June 17, 2015, a small order or curried goat was $13.00, and a large order was $15.00. That is a HUGE jump in pricing in a space of only a few months. It almost makes the item price prohibitive, or maybe it HAS because......

I was informed by the waiter, who finally came by my table after I had waited for fifteen minutes, that there was no curried goat available. He offered curried chicken instead, but since I am allergic to poultry that wasn't an option for me. 

I hurriedly looked over the menu board for another choice, but seeing nothing that interested me, and being slightly irked for having already waited fifteen minutes for service, I thanked the waiter and left. 

The restaurant was very busy at 12:30 p.m. for lunch. Previously I had received good, prompt service, but on this visit I was unsure that I would even be waited on since I was the only Caucasian in the restaurant. I don't know if I will come back here due to the slow service and the steep prices. That's a shame because the food is really good."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time and it was amazing! I really wanted to try the oxtail but they were out :( Ordered the curry goat entree and the meat was very tender...the meat fell right off the bone! The dish wasn't overly spicy, just enough kick to still be deliciously tasty. We didn't have to wait too long for the food but it came out steaming hot. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Had a layover at the airport and decided to come here during the meantime. We were not disappointed at all, this was the best carribbean food that I have ever had! We ordered the large combo platter with jerk shirmp, curry goat, plaintains, cabbage and rice with beans. The food was delicious, service was great, staff was nice and place was clean. Seriously loved it and wish there were places like this in Maryland. Food so good we had to tip and support small businesses because this place needs that recognition!"}
{"text":"Based on the other reviews I have read, I must have come on a bad day. This was was the worst Caribbean food we have ever had.  I had the curry chicken and my sister had the ox tails.  The curry chicken didn't taste like curry. It appeared to have been cooked in some kind of yellowish sauce. Again, it had no flavor.  The ox tails as well had no flavor.  Sorry to leave such a poor review, but this was not good food.  The service, however, was wonderful."}
{"text":"Always good, hot and fresh not to mention authentic Jamaican food. Staff polite and always glad to see you. I got the brown stew snapper and it's cooked to order but well worth the wait. They have 2 locations and I frequent both and have never been"}
{"text":"Service is excellent! Food is delicious. Very nice and clean. Bob Marley music playing and TVs on the way. Lunch special is very inexpensive."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time today at lunch.  Ordered the jerk chicken.  The sauce was pretty good, as it had a little kick to it (spicy).  I do think that it was missing some tamarind flavor though. 

Unfortunately, they do not have jerk pork.  I am a huge fan of pork, so it was disappointing that this meat was not on the menu.

My large order of jerk chicken also came with white rice, and a side dish of cabbage.  The cabbage didn't have much of a strong taste, but I really liked it a lot.  It also came with a side of plantains -- 2 pieces, actually.  Very disappointing, as usually plantain portions are more than 2 lousy pieces.

I'm not sure if I would order the same thing again.  While the jerk chicken came with about 5 pieces, they were pretty much bone pieces.  A couple of small drumsticks (like hotwing variety), and other chicken bones.  This was quite disappointing.

If I do make a return trip, I'll order something else.  Please add jerk pork to your menu, and add tamarind to the jerk sauce."}
{"text":"The Caribbean Hut is a authentic Jamaica restaurant.I love the Oxtail and rice it runs me a good 20.00 dollars but ots totally worth it.The service is great the people know your face kind of place Just Amazing"}
{"text":"10/10 would come back. Amazing jerk chicken that the meat slides right off the bone. Rice and beans were not dry, plantains were delicious. I'm not usually a fan of cabbage but theirs was really good."}
{"text":"The restaurant is clean and well organized and the staff is very nice. My main issue was the food. I don't know if I got a bad batch but I ordered the curry chicken and ox tail combo to try out 2 things at once since it was my first time. The food tasted very salty and I was unable to finish it."}
{"text":"My first time eating at Caribbean Hut and I didn't know what to expect; however, I must say food was absolutely delicious! Service was also outstanding as well! Oxtail was extremely flavorful and tender. I will recommend to family and friends!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious and served surprisingly quickly. Service was fine, never had to ask for anything. Some of the bones in the curry goat were chopped a little smaller than I like; had a few close calls with some small, sharp pieces. Meat was super tender and tasty, though."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible horrible........ I was looking forward to good food due to the reviews I been reading from other customers.... I ordered a large oxtail dinner and was enjoying my food until I half of a huge bug in my food. I have never experienced anything like that in my life. Did call the Woodlawn location to complain and was offered a new entree but I won't be eating from this franchise again."}
{"text":"I don't know why i haven't written this post awhile ago..but this isn't my favorite Jerk chicken plate only because I do not like sweet sauces..I know a ton of people who love sweet jerk chicken and to me that's not how it's supposed to taste. It's meant to be spicy and flavorful.The cabbage sweet,jerk sauce sweet and I unknowingly mixed my cabbage and rice before trying it so my rice was then sweet. If your looking for spicy jerk chicken this isn't the place.but portion wise is a good amount for your buck."}
{"text":"I eat here once a month or so. The jerk chicken and brown stew chicken are reasonably good, but not as good as at Reggae Shack in Gainesville, FL, which is my reference point for Caribbean food. However, I really like the roti, which is not only tasty but also fun to eat -- I prefer the method of using pieces of roti skin to scoop up the filling."}
{"text":"Not so much.... I've had better it's a nice fix but it reminds me of when I want a coke but some buys me a diet cook .... It's good but not exactly what I wanted"}
{"text":"Oxtail dinner, rice, & plantains were really good. My husband ordered the jerk chicken dinner and it was just OKAY. We 're use to authentic freshly grilled jerk chicken with tons of spice and flavor that is not covered in sauce like it is at this restaurant (instead the chicken is marinated with jerk seasoning then grill to perfection with a nice crispy coat). We also ordered a chicken patty (which looks dry), but have yet to try it. The service was decent. Decent for a chain restaurant. I would return again solely for the oxtail dinner."}
{"text":"Delicious Caribbean food to go or tables to eat there. Highly recommend the jerk or curry chicken. My partner loved the curry goat and oxtail. Combo plates give you 2 meats, rice, beans, and plantains. The large is a decent amount of food might go with the small next time. Staff was extremely friendly too! Great food in a nice casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"I really can't think of a time when I was so excited for a restaurant to open in Gastonia. This city has seen so much edible diversity in the last 6 years that I've been here and Caribbean Hut has thrilled me! Word on the street via community food scouts was that they would be opening Friday (yesterday) and I wanted to go on opening day because I honestly couldn't contain my excitement. Hubs and I went around 7pm so we could snag some dinner and planned to bring some back for my neighbor and new Yelper (shout out to Jonathan M!) so we got take-out. The restaurant is beautiful, clean and decorated with pics of Bob Marley. Gaston and surrounding counties turned out for this place! There were so many customers and even though the restaurant was adequately staffed, there was still a considerable wait to get our food. (Tip: Call in your orders) No worries mon because they have at least 3 tv's and we were entertained by Usain Bolt achieving his triple-triple! I ordered a small jerk chicken plate that came with rice and beans, veggies and plantains and hubs got the veggie plate with same.(TON of food and only $13/$9 bucks) I also ordered a side of mac and cheese but they were out. Everything was sooooo good! Lastly, I'd like to point out that I heard Caribbean accents on both sides of the counter and that, my friends, is always a good sign! Welcome to the Gas-House Caribbean Hut!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch take-out on coworker's recommendation. Reasonably priced food with good portions. I got the small jerk chicken with red beans and rice, cabbage, and two fried plantains. The food tasted great. Would've given five stars, but customer service is non-existent (no hello, smile, thank you, have a nice day) however, I was in and out fairly quickly."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal! Had a large jerk chicken plate and it was perfect! The chicken was delicious with just the right amount of spice, the rice and beans were great, the cabbage, the oxtail sauce, washed it down with some champagne kola... so great, just like we were back in Jamaica! So glad we have this place in town! Gonna try the roti next- they're huge and looked terrific!"}
{"text":"I wanted to love it but I just didn't. The team members were relatively nice on the phone when I called in my order. Food was ready quickly and they bagged me up. The jerk sauce smothered everything in the box, rice and cabbage included. It was just way too much sauce. Meat seemed cheap but the flavor was good. I'll give them another try at a later date."}
{"text":"Wow! This place in Fantastic! This was a pleasant surprise since I had never heard of the place and was just passing by. We were given a friendly welcome from the time we walked in. The service and food brought back fond memories of a recent trip to Jamaica. The server suggested that I sample the Jerk Chicken and the Curry Goat before ordering because I said I didn't want anything crazy hot. Both were delicious but I had the Jerk Chicken and my guest had the Butter Shrimp. I can honestly say that the Collards were some of the best I have ever had. 

Friendly service, great food, large portions and reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"Decided to try the lunch special which was any of the chicken dishes. I had the jerk chicken with rice and peas and it was delicious. Paired it with a pineapple pop. My friend had the curry chicken, also delicious. I will be back again. Great portion for the price. You shouldn't leave hungry."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant today at 5 pm, and was told that they ran out of mac n cheese and plantains. Mind you, they close at 10 pm. I was very disappointed. What made things worse is this a recurring issue, and they're very unapologetic about it. I ended up walking out and taking my business elsewhere. It may be best to call and confirm if they have the food you want before making a trip up there."}
{"text":"My favorite Caribbean spot in the area. The food was served quickly. My children and I had a veggie platter with rice and beans, cabbage, and plantains. My husband had the jerk and curry chicken with cabbage, rice and beans, and plantains. 

The plantains were a little off tonight but the waitress did warn me.

They always offer to put a movie on for my kiddos which is a nice touch.

This is our go-to spot for good Caribbean food!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite resturants...Im a regular they know my face and order by heart.  The food is very authentic Caribbean food(this coming from someone who goes to the islands on the regular).  Well seasoned meats and sauces and very good portions.  Food is always hot and fresh.  The only place were they lack is on plantains. This is a Caribbean staple and sometimes these are not the best.  Dry and rubbery at times instead of sweet, soft, and with just the right amount of crispness.  I would give them 5 stars of their plantains were consistently up to par.  Still doesn't stop me from going just about every other week."}
{"text":"The Caribbean hut will take you to a trip to Jamaica without having to leave Charlotte NC lol. Their beef and chicken patties are great, but you have to get them at the right time  because otherwise they will be a little dried up and obviously not fresh. I wish I could say what the right time is,  but I'm not sure. I guess it would be when they just put them out at lunch time. Also their curry chicken it's great.  Fall off the bone good lol"}
{"text":"Ate here today and I love this place. I got the small curry chicken plate with rice, beans, greens and plantains. The plate was huge for a small! Definitely worth my $9. The service is always great and they are very friendly. They offer a great variety of Jamaican drinks. I definitely recommend this place to anyone with a taste for Caribbean style food."}
{"text":"As good as it gets.  Things are slow there but you kind of expect it.  I feel transported when I am in there.  The food is phenomenal! Very Authentic."}
{"text":"Giving them a 4 because the jerk chicken is delicious, 1st time I had the curry shrimp. The curry shrimp was good but felt it was missing something ...the jerk chicken definitely pushes that 3star to a 4 . Yum yum"}
{"text":"I have eaten lunch from the Caribbean Hut before (to-go), but this was my first time eating there at the Woodlawn location. It is quite small, and cozy, but the restaurant accommodated our group of 5 nicely. We got there at 11:30am, and was finished by 12:30ish. Perfect for an hour lunch. 

One waitress was working at 11:30am, which was fine for our lunch time, however, when it got busier, she definitely needed more help. I was a little disappointed that they had run out of plantains, and Red Stripe, but none-the-less, I was there for their jerk chicken.

As always, this time around, their jerk chicken did not disappoint, and resembles closely to jerk chicken from street carts in Jamaica. It comes with cabbage with mixed veggies, and rice; all the better to soak up the jerk sauce in. The first bite doesn't have much heat, but beware, it builds over time. I got the small entrée platter, and still had leftovers, and during the week from 11am-2pm, the jerk chicken is a lunch special for only $6.99!

Other than the jerk chicken, my friends had their curry chicken entrée and their curried goat/ox tail entrée. Everyone raved about how delicious it was! We took a to-go order back to the office of the curried shrimp roti, and I had a bite of that, which is what I will order next time around. I also took back with me some of their homemade fruit punch (which is what they use to make rum punch with in Jamaica), which is so sugary sweet and delicious, I know I will crave it more often. 

A great lunch with great friends and great food!"}
{"text":"This is my go to spot in Charlotte for Jamaican Cuisine. The food is always fresh and the service is A-1. I only wish that they would hire more cooks or create a faster prep time so the wait isn't soo extensive."}
{"text":"Okay, the food is absolutely a 5 star rating. The food was amazingly good. Now, the problem here at this location is not having any oxtail ready to serve even though it's on the menu. Really wanted to have the oxtail but it wasn't  prepared in time to serve. The other problem was the waitress. She looked and acted like she just hit a crack pipe. Totally erratic behavior and a very off putting way of speaking. She didn't really know the menu and there was definitely a lack of communication between kitchen and staff. Needless to say this food was so good I will go back, regardless if the wait staff is chasing the dragon in between taking my order and bringing my drink."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with coworkers and was seated right away.  The staff was really friendly and took our order, got our drinks and got us taken care of in a very timely manner.  The restaurant was clean and nice.  

I ordered the jerk shrimp and was told that it was made to order, and there would be a wait.  Honestly it came out quicker than I expected.  It had a great flavor.  The jerk wasn't as spicy as I had hope for, but it did have a small kick to it.  The plantains were delicious.  I also really loved the cabbage and vegetables that come with the meals.  The yellow rice was a little dry, I preferred the cabbage way more.  

I would recommend trying this place for lunch or dinner. They had some other options that I would like to try as well, so I will return sometime soon."}
{"text":"There food quality is always consistently good. I eat here at least 4xs a week. I pass by all the fast food joints out there and make the final stop here, a better alternative for eating when I'm alway from home.
I support these guys. I'm actually outside of there place now waiting on them to open at 11am.
#respect(jam. accent)"}
{"text":"Nom Nom nom.... Ate here with a group of gals on a Friday night. I ordered the jerk chicken and shrimp. It was great. A little spicy with a smidge of sweet. The service was impeccable, as some diners were first timers and the waiter was very patient. I also had ginger beer, which I'm trying to find in stores. My friends had king fish escovich, which they both enjoyed. They noted that it was VERY spicy, but delicious. Lastly, we were there forever, kee keeing it up until nearly closing time. It was great. If you're looking for authentic Caribbean food, this is the place to be."}
{"text":"Never been disappointed, as many times as I have gone. Always a fun atmosphere and good food. THEM OX TAILS THOUGH!!! So tender. They also have a great lunch special for only $6.25 and the portions are big. Definitely recommend. Only issue is they are rude AF. Particularly the women. The women never speak or smile just ask what you want and move like molasses but the food makes up for the women staff's lack of customer service."}
{"text":"Good Food if they have what you want.....Theyre always out of something. Go to the carribean hut in Charlotte They keep everything fully loaded...."}
{"text":"WARNING!!!!!  GREENS ARE FROM A CAN........

My fiance and I are huge fans of Jamacian food.  We have traveled all over the United States and tried many different places.  Our experience at this Caribbean Hut has been nothing but disasterous.  We ordered lunch one time and as most expect the entree' comes with peas and cabbage.  When we got there to pick up our food we checked our order and they put greens and peas on the cool instead of cabbage.  When we made a complaint about them putting there wack greens on our plate instead of cabbage we were told they were out of cabbage.  Since when does an entree not have cabbage????  We were not happy then they acted like we were just going to except it and move on.  The most recent experience was today.  We decided to give them another shot to redeem themselves.  However when we got in there to sit down we over heard them telling another table they were out of cabbage again.  Believe me this place will not get our business ever again.  They never have cabbage and expect us as consumers to eat the BS Canned greens they are trying to serve!"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant a few times, and never had any complaints until Sunday. I received warm food; therefore, making me believe it was not fresh. I called the restaurant the next day to make my complaint, and all i got was a sorry! Really! 30 plus dollars spent, on food, and all I can get is a sorry! Never again!"}
{"text":"As a fellow Jamaican, I wanted to try out the spot as I injured my ankle and was unable to cook after work, yet wanted some home cooked food. Two days ago, I went online and found Caribbean Hut - so excited as I had a taste for curried goat, rice and peas, plantain and some Red Stripe! The hours via the website stated open until 10:00 PM and since I worked late this was perfect. We pulled up at 8:55 PM and my husband went inside to ask the gentleman for a menu to bring to the car for me as I was unable to walk. I was ready to Nyam!!! The man at the counter advised him that I have 2 minutes to order as he's closing @ 9pm. My husband came to the car - he is extremely mild tempered but looked frustrated and dumbfounded. I watched from the vehicle as the gentleman's mannerisms were clearly negative and stand-offish, so told my hubby to forget it. He went back to return the menu and inquired why the door states closes @ 10pm as we drove out of our way and got lost looking for the spot, and the man rudely said - \"I'm the owner and I'm closing @ 9!\" My husband who looks like a bodybuilder came back to the car as the man quickly locked the door - BEFORE 9 PM I might add!! Yes, he's a big dude and I'm sure he wanted to kick his ass but he wouldn't do such a thing -That's why I love him. Who cares if you are the owner - I'm a stock broker, does that matter? It just shows your poor customer service and the fact that you think more highly of yourself than the clientele base that support your business that is sure to fail if you have this type of attitude. 1st and last visit for us as I'm embarrassed that this was my husband's 1st impression of a Jamaican Restaurant. Good luck \"Sir\" - I'm spreading the word."}
{"text":"All the meats are slow cooked and fall off the bone delicious.  Several rice choices and plenty of collards complete the meal. Staff is friendly and laid back."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy, but good solid Jamaican food.  Tucked back into a strip mall off Woodlawn Rd, with plenty of parking.  Service was very good and it was crowded at lunchtime.  FYI, there is another location up near UNCC and the Woodlawn location does not have everything on the menu, so I also plan to try the N Tryon spot as well."}
{"text":"Food is ABSOLUTELY fresh! Red velvet cake is DELISH! Employees, servers, and the chef are very personable, accommodating and friendly! See you soon!"}
{"text":"curry goat is pretty good, patties are fresh, vibe is pretty friendly (even if i was the only white guy in the place last night). service could have been better but the first time i went it was fine. my biggest draw back was they dont have ting or banana drink, which are my staples.  but $12 for a huge plate of goat, rice and peas and veg i cant complain (nor could i finish it!)"}
{"text":"Soo good!. Now I don't know if it's because I was desperately craving some curry but this place had one of the best curry chicken I had in such a long time.  Lunch specials $6.99 

I did a takeout. But it seemed to be cleaned and organized and I believe I saw a 98 for a their inspection. 

 Curry chicken slid off the bone and was seasoned perfectly. Rice and peas were great as well as the vegetables. I also got the beef pattie and coco bread that was pretty good. Overall the food was very good and I was such a happy person. I will definitely be going back"}
{"text":"Food was decent but overpriced and service was incredibly slow and unorganized. Every table around me including ours was missing part of our orders even after requesting what was lacking. $13 for shrimp entree and had about 5 small shrimp. Two small overcooked plantain slices. Waitress was sweet but it seemed she needed more help with all of the tables full and better communication from the kitchen.  Would not eat here again."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is crazy good! My husband got the ox tail and goat combo and it was absolutely delicious.  I got the Jerk Chicken and it was equally wonderful.  It would make Shawn and Gus proud!  The portions were huge.  The curry reminded me of the signature dish my Jamaican friend used to make years ago.  It's a small place, in a strip mall, off Woodlawn Ave and definitely worth the trip. We will be back soon."}
{"text":"I went to 3 different jamaican places and they were all closed but I was determined to get some ox tails.  Then when I sat down here to order they were out, the worker saw how sad I was and found some scraps for me.  Lol! yum! It was bangin!"}
{"text":"Love the jerk chicken. Reasonable price. Always satisfies. I've come here for lunch and dinner. People are always friendly and the environment is relaxed. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I wasn't planning on coming here. I stopped by Zygma for some perogies but they were closed for the week.

So I wanted something foreign but not Asian or Hispanic as those were already on the docket for the week. I work with a couple Puerto Rican's and a kid from Trinidad and they always talk about how fire Caribbean food is. So I figured let's give it a go.

It's a small joint with a sit at bar and some seating available. It had a very very chill vibe that I could definitely groove with. The menu was pretty good looking I definitely have to go back to try the oxtails and goat as my friend brags about how good those dishes are.
The young man who took my order recommended the lunch special for 6.99$ so I ordered the curry chicken plate to go.

The food was still warm when I got back to my desk, and when I opened it the dish filled my office with a warm spice filled aroma that smelled like Indian food that I love if it was mixed with a soul food/ Hispanic vibe.

I tried the chicken first, and it was absolute fire. The meat was begging to drop off the bone and was tender and juicy, so I had to take my time eating to savor it. The curry was the perfect blend of sauce,flavor and spice that really reminded me of morrocan food, that perfect blend of spicy and sweet. The dish had about three chicken wings that made me feel I could probably eat a dozen for dinner as they were so succulent. They were so tender and the flavor was so soaked in, thay I dug some of the marrow out and ate that and even considered eating the bones. The bones were so soft you honestly could eat them if bones are your thing. My dog would cry if he knew I three them away.

The sides were some kind of rice with some kind of vegetables in it(maybe it had beans and onions in it too)and something I assume was like a stewed or steamed cabbage. The guy told me what it was but I was in hurry and forgot what it was after my wife called.
The rice was great and had so much flavor by itself. It definitely felt like an island version of dirty rice.
I mixed in the leftover curry mix into it and my tongue dissolved in the flavor like it was on an acid trip. I hungrily scooped every little bit together and chowed down.

The cabbage if that is what it is was delicious. It was better than anything I've had or made and had flavor even a sweet old black lady from the southern United States couldn't make better ( and I know quite a few that bring me some fire cabbage).

Overall I was extremely impressed and have been bragging on them to folks at work and gave my menu card to one of my friends at work and he says he is dying to try it now. The kid from Trinidad said just from how it smelled he knew it was good.

I cannot wait to go back and try their jerk seasoning and, like I said the oxtails and curried goat. I know I won't be disappointed.

Thanks and good job on opening my eyes up to a culture's food I've missed out on my entire life."}
{"text":"Man oh man!! This place is great. Seasoned to perfection, not too spicy at all. I tried oxtails doe the first time and it was amazing. Meat was falling off the bone. I also got jerk shrimp. Really good. The place is a nice vibe. It's a in a strip mall that is kinda of scarce but the food and place is worth it."}
{"text":"I ordered the oxtail with rice and cabbage.  I think for the price I got a lot of food and it was good . In addition the service was good my only issue I had was not being able to order the sides I wanted with my meal . The menu showed macaroni and cheese but I was not allowed to get that my waiter said I can only have rice and cabbage. Which I could be confused by the rules of the entrées."}
{"text":"OH MY GOODNESS!!!! This food is amazing! Very authentic food. Vegan friendly. Quaint and cozy spot!!!! I had the large vegetable platter with rice and beans it was ample food and super delicious. My dad had the oxtails and almost ate the plats it was soo good!!!"}
{"text":"Curry Chicken and Jerk Chicken are both good! The side vegetables are good too! Good portion and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Went there with friends and everyone liked everything that they ordered.. All in all a place worth trying.. Do try the Jerk Chicken"}
{"text":"I went to this place once a long time ago before it was bought out by the current owner and management. The food was horrible then, but talk about a complete turn around! This is the best Caribbean food I've had in years, bar none! The bold flavors, the spicy entrees you are supposed to expect in this cuisine are present and highlighted. I got the ox-tail and jerk chicken to go today, the place was was calm and quiet seeing as it's a day before Christmas eve. I got home and the pungent aromas hit me like a favorite toy under the tree on Christmas day ( excuse the Christmas spirit). Once I tasted this food I knew I was hooked for a long time, the jerk is as bold as you'd find in one of those Jamaican restaurants when you're on vacation in Montego Bay or any other road side restaurant there. The undertones of cloves, peppers, thyme, garlic, onions etc in all the dishes, you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"I went to Yelp one day for lunch ideas, typed in Thai and up popped Caribbean Hut, so I thought it must be a sign telling me this is where I needed to go. So go I went. 

I walked in and the service was fair. Nothing great but they serviced me, gave me my food and took my money with nothing to complain about.

The food itself was decent. My goat curry was on the gamey side and while flavorful it was overpowered with the taste of curry. I believe there should be a balance of flavors and I just didn't get that here. The meat itself was very tender and cooked perfectly.The goat curry has lots of bones - but anyone who eats goat should know this. 

My beef patty was decent as well, just a bit cold in the middle. And to be honest, they tasted like something I could buy from the freezer section in a grocery store.

The jerk chicken was decent eats. It was very flavorful, a bit sweet but juicy and good. 

The sides that come with the plates were good as well, I really enjoyed the greens and the rice and peas."}
{"text":"If you enjoy oxtails, rice and peas it's worth a try. If you like roti, please pass and try something else on the menu. The potatoes and curry chicken were fine, but there was no channa. The roti skin was hard, to the point that when I bent it, the bread split. I've never had that before, and I've eaten some underwhelming roti. My Trinidadian Mom dryly stated, \"That's what you get buying roti from a non-Trini establishment.\" 

My friend cleaned his plate, so all is not lost. Just pass on the roti."}
