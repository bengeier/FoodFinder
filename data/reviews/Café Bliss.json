{"text":"There's NO way I'm going to pay $9 for 3 pancakes or $8.50 for a breakfast sandwich. You're better off going to Stacks.  It's less than a mile away and you'll pay half what you would be paying here. There's usually a wait at Stacks (there's a reason for that), but you get seated quickly. I don't see how this place can charge so much. I would be surprised if it's around next December."}
{"text":"We are regulars and Bliss is a favorite. Everyone is fantastic. Food is wonderful.  We have been regulars since Caf√© Bliss openend. Unlike most restaurant, Mike, the owner, is hands on every day and evening. Has the food always been perfect? Almost! But on a couple of occasions when it came out of the kitchen and we were not pleased, they did not just fix it, they started OVER.   Be careful what you ask for. One time we asked if they had sugar free syrup. Our waitress was leaving to go to Harris Teeter to get some just for us when we noticed and begged her not to go.  The presentation of the food is incredible, even the desserts. Oh, did I say the desserts are the best around?  And the wait staff is incredible in their desire to satisfy your every need.  I am not sure about any of the negative reviews so all I can say is I have not experienced anything that I would rate poor.  As I said, this is one of our favorites, not only in Waxhaw but S Charlotte as well."}
{"text":"So trying to be totally objective, I tend to base my reviews on a few consistent factors; price, quality of food, service, time from seating to eating and ambience/atmosphere of the restaurant.  If you look at each of these independently, here is how I rate Cafe Bliss (5 star scale): 1.  Price - 2 stars 2.  Quality - 3.5 stars 3.  Service - 3.0 stars 4.  Time from seating to eating - 1 star 5.  Ambience/atmosphere - 3.5 stars   So therein lies this issue with Bliss.  There is no one or two compelling elements to make you want to come back."}
{"text":"Our family decided to eat an early dinner here.  The decor is tasteful and clean and the wait staff were very eager to please us.  We each had a different entree and each of us liked our food.  I ordered one of the specials...Blackened Chicken Caesar  Wrap.  It was delicious, perfectly seasoned, moist and flavorful.  We plan to come back for  breakfast or lunch sometime soon.  It is so much nicer than Stacks...sure hope that others in the neighborhood give them a try!"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this place for dinner, and we were thrilled about breakfast being available all day.  My husband chose the pancakes and a couple of sides.  I ordered a sandwich and made sure to mention my severe food allergy to tomatoes.  My order arrived with tomatoes so I asked for my order to be fixed again mentioning how severe my allergy was.  The waiter returned after a few minutes with the same sandwich but with most but not all of the tomatoes picked out.  The waiter seemed to think this was ok, but I had to explain how severe my allergy was once again.  I had to ask for a new, sandwich, but it was another 20-25 minutes before it was ready.    The food was ok, but I was scared I was going to end up in the ER from an allergic reaction.  On the menu, gluten free options were offered so I assumed this place would be accommodating when it came to food allergies.    If I end up going back, it will only be for something safe like some of the lovely looking desserts in the display cases."}
{"text":"Pretty good! Would stick to Mediterranean food only. We tried the hummus along with some other dips and they were good! Fresh tabouli was a plus.   My sister had the Bliss Burger and loved it! I thought my chicken shawarma was okay."}
{"text":"The service is great! They know how to treat their customers. The food is fantastic. I had the Ruben sandwich and it is great. I order it every time. The atmosphere is nice and calm. Not too many people in there which is fine. Always get the food within 10 to 12 minutes."}
{"text":"I cannot believe this place is still in business.... The service is horrendous and the food is poor at best.  The avocado was old and a strange color and the tomatoes inedible.  When our bill came we had been upcharged for 3 items that came with our meals.  When I requested to speak to the manager I told him how bad, slow and strange our service had been.  Instead of comping our meal he refunded us the over charge amount.  I will NEVER go back."}
{"text":"Had breakfast there on a Saturday morning... it was just ok. I ordered an Egg & Cheese Sandwich with Sausage. My buddy had the Pancakes (which he really enjoyed). When my food arrived there was no sausage. Waitress went back and re-appeared 10 minutes later with the sausage, that I added to the now cold sandwich. While my buddy was still working on his food, she asked if she can take it away.. really? Service feels amateur and food boring"}
{"text":"I have since been in a few other times (morning and lunch) with great service and food. I think the reoccurring problem seems to be dinner.   We took my mother-in-law to fine with us tonight for her first time. My daughter ordered the Mac-n-cheese with a side of applesauce. The was brought out a side of fruit. We immediately asked for applesauce and was told they would go and ask but they may be out, which is why the fruit was given.   About 8-10 mins later, we were told they are in fact out of applesauce and would she like something different. She chose fries. Right before her fries came out, my other daughter began to eat a few of the grapes from the fruit cup. The waitress came over and asked if she could take the fruit cup away. I stated that the youngest was going to nibble on it. Fries came out and all is right in the world....until the bill comes. We are charged $1.75 for fries. I questioned it and was told by the waitress that because she refused to give back the fruit cup, they would have to charge me for the additional side.  I told her we would not be paying for them because we didn't originally ask for the fruit cup in the first place (they decided to replace the applesauce with a side of their choice without asking us first) and why not let my youngest eat it because surely they wouldn't serve it again when it had been sitting on our table for 10 minutes.   I can't express how disappointed the experience was. The fact that 1) we were given the wrong side 2) we were asked for it back and 3) not told we were being charged for the fries.  I think when the owner isn't around, the place is not ran how it should be ran. :("}
{"text":"Visited for a late (1:30 pm) lunch on a weekday.  Only about four other parties inside and outside, so not crowded.  Walked in and waited for over five minutes before anyone came to seat us, although quite a few staff were wandering around and walking past (but not seeming super-busy).  After we were finally seated, inside, it took another 10 minutes before a waitress came over to us.  The waitress was very friendly and accommodating, once she came.  I ordered a veggie pita sandwich with hummus spread, and I specifically requested \"no onions\", and any sauces to be put on the side.  My friend ordered a pasta meal and requested her sauce on the side.  The waitress came back to clarify about the pasta sauce, and was meticulous about special requests.  But...it then took OVER 30 minutes for our meals to arrive.  The waitress did check on us once during that time to refill our drinks.  My sandwich was pretty average--nothing outstanding and not enough hummus to even add much flavor.  The french fries were limp and cold, as if had been sitting out the entire 30 minutes we'd waited on our meals; worst of all, the sandwich had LOTS of onions on it, despite my request for none, even though I know the waitress had written it on the order.  The pasta was decent, w/ a very large serving, and the side salad that came with it was very nice looking with a variety of greens, tomatoes, etc.  I didn't bother to complain about the cold french fries, since we'd already waited for such a long time, and took the onions off the sandwich myself.  All in all, for a $27 plus meal, I give this place a two-star rating.  To me, w/ so few customers and a slow time of day, there is no excuse for the lack of initial attention, the very long wait for the food, and the mistake on the sandwich and cold food.  We may try again, but there are other places in Waxhaw that are tried and true, so I am hesitant to  waste my money."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped here on a whim and it was ammmmaaaazzzing. Our waitress Amanda was such a sweetheart and the food was to die for. We has the lebanese style dishes and they were definitely authentic. We will be returning again and again!"}
{"text":"was expecting more from what ive heard..then compared my thoughts to other reviews.and I feel the staff was nice but service....slow...40 min for burger and gyro with only 2 other tables is a bit much..and 23 dollars is also a bit much for lunch...burger was not special...just average...wife thought her was not flavorful..just less than average."}
{"text":"Food is good and conveniently located, Agree with another yelp user that it has a lot of potential to be GREAT.   The price rating is not $ - should be a $$ as they are a bit more expensive than that.   I've been there twice and the manager has been wonderful, pleasant  and accommodating."}
{"text":"Have been to Cafe Bliss twice. Very pleased with each visit. The food is excellent.  The best omelet I have ever had.  The staff is very nice.  The fruit is fresh and they give you a nice bowl full.  The only problem we had was finding it the first time we went.  We came because we had s coupon. Put the address in our gps. We were led to a woodsy area. We called and found it with her directions. We are glad we did. We will certainly come again."}
{"text":"This place is terrible! Asked for tea, got water. Ordered a blackened chicken sandwich with a side salad, got a blackened chicken salad. Then when the check came I was charged for a chicken panini. ? Server had no clue and waited 20 minutes and we were the only people there. Never going back."}
{"text":"I'll keep this short. I had heard great things about Cafe Bliss and I was hoping it would live up to what I had heard. I live in Waxhaw and love some of the restaurants here in town. My two favorite places are near the bridge. One is still open, the other sadly has closed forever and it will be missed.  Yesterday, I needed some quick takeout and my remaining favorite place, is closed on Mondays, so I needed a new place to grab a quick bite. So I gave Cafe Bliss a try.  I ordered Steak salad, salmon salad and the green bean appetizer.  It was ok, they don't use flank steak for the steak salad, and the steak was very average, not tender. The salmon was ok. No croutons in the salad ( even tho the menu says the salads come with croutons.)  But the green beans were a big disappointment. Huge cloves on garlic in them. I can see cooking with the garlic but come on, you can't take out these huge cloves? There was as much garlic as there were green beans.  Now I wish I had just gone to the soul food cafe down the street, which by the way, never disappoints.  I don't think i'll be going to Cafe Bliss again."}
{"text":"Loved coming here on this beautiful March day!!! We sat outside,sipped coffee & expresso with the family.   There isn't reason to not enjoy your meal because they aim to please.  We had omelets with a very good multi grain bread & house fries. Although the food was a good portion, my daughter craved something sweet and ordered a coconut dessert w/ rose water sugar on top.  My world traveler, loved the flavors and it was large enough for a snack later.   Great not to be rushed out and my picky parents were very pleased.   We will return soon."}
{"text":"I would sincere suggest that people reconsider going here. I have tried to give it the benefit of 3 visit and have purchased several things to go on other occasions and I have always been disappointed. Either poor service or the food was poor. This will be my last time, I just left with a pastry and got home to a stale pastry that we threw out. Never again!"}
{"text":"The wait time in between ordering and receiving was a little too long... and I wish they offered regular bacon, but the french toast was very good! What I liked most was that the syrup came warm!"}
{"text":"There is nothing short of AH-mazing when it comes to Cafe Bliss!  Mike and his wife (owners) are just fabulous people, but WOW-AMAZING food!  They are still ironing out the offical menu, but if you go in they will pretty much 'make what you like the way you like it' as long as they have the supplies in the back.  Espresso drinks, great quality coffee, rich espresso with great crema!  FIRST - Mediterranean food style, and OMG is it phenominal!  Sue (Mikes wife) cooks so many things that are out-of-this-world.....homemade Hummus too!  Sue also home cooks the goodies in the bakery section, and they are really top-notch.  Me & the kids decided on a simple 'burger' american style with fries, and even that was delish!  Meat is high quality and cooked to perfection!  They can make chicken nuggets for the kids too, and very family freindly environment!  Just cannot say enough GREAT about this new place!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious here. I have had a few menu items and they never cease to please. Yummy!!!   Staff is really friendly and thoughtful and brings food to the table, but it could just be a bit faster. That's the only really con I find.   I love the idea of breakfast, brunch, lunch, and even early dinner being served here. It's like a cafe and lunch place all in one. In terms of aesthetics, when I first walked in, I was taken aback by how large the space was even though it looks pretty small from outside. The wood molding and the artwork give it a welcoming and bright mood. Also gives a cozy and warm feel to the place despite it being large and spacious."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday for a late lunch.  Nice inside.  Server was great.   Had the Shawarma Sandwich which was very good as was the side of hummus.   Very Fresh.  Reasonable prices.  Very good baked items (homemade).  Baklava was very good and our server gave us a sample of a cranberry muffin which was awesome.   Recommended."}
{"text":"We were very happy to find Bliss Cafe. I'm sure we will soon be regulars. The food was excellent and the appetizers were very interesting and delicious. We took our dessert home with us. I'm not sure what it was called. but it  resembled a coconut macaroon crossed with a corn muffin. I know that does not sound good but it was unbelievably delicious"}
{"text":"I have been to Cafe Bliss twice so far.  I have to say, the three star rating might be a little harsh, but I really feel this place has a lot of room to grow, and when they do it will be one of the best restaurants in Waxhaw.  The Good:  They have some of the freshest food I have tasted in a restaurant in Waxhaw.  You can tell the chef puts a lot of themselves into their work.  The food is cooked with soul, and it comes through.  I had the Shawarma Steak sandwich the first time. It was extremely tasty with steak, cheese, and fresh and pickled vegetables.  My problem is, very few of these ingredients besides sauce, garlic and steak were listed on the menu. This might be a problem with pickier diners, not for me though!  The second time I had an everything bagel with egg and white american cheese.  It was a meager portion of egg and cheese, and the bagel wasn't toasted very well (the person I was with told me that her bagel was toasted perfectly, so maybe this was a one time mistake).   The restaurant is also extremely clean, and they have free WiFi!  The Bad: The menu is pretty limited, and not very descriptive. From what I have heard from others they are still sorting out the menu, but will be happy to put together anything for you as long as they have the ingredients.  However, some of the basics (Hamburger, Hot dog, Chicken Sandwich, etc.) should be on the menu to bring in a mainstream audience (outside of the Medditeranen crowd that this delicious (if limited) menu will attract.   I also feel like some of the items are a little pricey.  I look forward to watching Cafe Bliss grow.  It has fresh food, I just want more choices!"}
{"text":"One of the worst customer service I have ever experienced. I was asked to leave shortly after I got there. I was not being disruptive and I honestly think it was a racial thing. If you decide to make this your place of choice for the night just know you are making a huge mistake. Before all of this occurred I took a bite of their food and I found a piece of hair in it. Go to anywhere but this place. I'm helping you out on this one."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now.  I like the atmosphere.  It seems like the customer sits and the wait staff visits the table to get your order.   The first time I met friends for coffee. I enjoyed some eggs and a raspberry mocha.  I really REALLY liked the coffee!   The coffee mugs were so pretty.   The second time was for a private party.  I learned the owners are Lebanese.  We were treated to a three course meal.   The appetizer was a variety plate.  I liked the grape leaf wrap. The fresh hummus was very, very good and was served with a basket of soft pita triangles.   I really liked the salad, rice and the chicken kabob.  The dessert was heavenly.  It included a sweet coconut cake.  I had to take most of it home because there was so much.  I also got a second piece of cake.   Nothing made it it the fridge though.  My husband was very impressed with the flavors.   He wanted to know when I was taking him there...so we will be back soon.  They have a display case of many other desserts that I really shouldn't be eyeing."}
{"text":"We loved everything about this sit down GEM. There were a few minor things that could be improved upon. The Tzatziki wasn't as good as I've had other places, but the gyro was great with the fresh spinach on it instead of the normal lettuce.   Daughter had the house fries, they are much like you would get at a country breakfast. But the onions were cooked so much they were crunchy and bitter. so she instead asked for regular fries, which were much better and had a nice seasoning on them.   I had a side salad with my gyro, with Chipotle ranch dressing. was very good and enjoyed the kick of heat. My sister had the Bliss dressing, which tastes exactly like Olive Garden dressing in the bottle you can buy at the store (in case you want to have it at home).   The service was stellar! We loved everything about the place."}
{"text":"The worst experience I have ever had. Sat for 40 minutes waiting for order. Had to ask for a cup of coffee and they gave me one and never asked my husband whose cup was also empty. Gave this place a second chance for breakfast as our first experience wasn't great either as after a long wait our meal came cold.  2 tries= 2 fails. Will not be  Back"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and it's just ok for me.  I really wanted it to be a stand out, but it's really not.  The first time I went in it was during the week and my son ordered a breakfast sandwich and an iced mocha to go. $11.00 and 20 minutes later, he finally had a \"very good\" breakfast sandwich and an \"ok\" drink.   Not what we expected for the price tag.    We decided to give it another try for a sit down breakfast on a Saturday.  The process was confusing and chaotic.  It was \"seat yourself\" and that seemed to add to the confusion. The place was only half full and there was plenty of wait staff, yet it took 15 minutes for someone to come take our order.  Oh...and that was after we waited a good 5-8 minutes for menus that I finally went to get myself.  The waitress was very sweet, but she was in desperate need of training.  She was very soft spoken, she barely made eye contact, and she seems a bit frazzled.    There were 4 of us and we ordered 3 breakfast sandwiches and an omelet.  It took almost 25 mins to get our food...and one if the sandwiches was wrong.  The food was ok.  Not bad, but nothing special either.  My Mom enjoyed her omelet and 2 of the sandwiches were good.  My sandwich was made with the wrong type of cheese so I didn't enjoy it at all.  I ate a few bites and threw the rest away.  I would have sent it back, but the waitress didn't return to our table until the end of the meal when she delivered the bill.  My husband, who is a major breakfast fan and not terribly picky, was thoroughly turned off by the whole experience.  It's really too bad because the place is very close to home and is a small business (we always prefer to support small businesses).  We were really hoping to make this our new go-to breakfast place, but unfortunately that won't be the case.  We'll continue to watch the reviews and if things seems to get better, we might give it another try.    My best advice to the owners is to not allow patrons to seat themselves (this results in tables to be overlooked), they need to provide training to their young and inexperienced waitstaff, they should make a small investment in \"real\" menus, and they need to better expedite the food.  The restaurant is clean and very cute and it has promise.  Waxhaw is in need of another breakfast option... this could be it, but they need to kick it up a few notches."}
{"text":"Great food! Came here for lunch and the service was only outdone by the meal. Wonderful food, not your mainstream kinda  place, just exactly what my wife and I love!"}
{"text":"My husband and I LOVE Cafe Bliss. We have enjoyed meals here many times and love the variety of delicious options their menu offers as well as the personable customer service! Just this last week we needed to get dinner to go, so we stopped by and ordered out. The food was ready quickly and was delicious :) If you are looking for relaxed environment and a restaurant that takes interest in their customers, this is the place to go. Oh, the coffee drinks are delicious too. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We checked out their website, thought they had some good looking food at reasonable prices.  We drove there today at 6 pm (website said open until 9pm).  They are closed.  Chairs up on the tables. I'm not sure if they were permanently closed, there was no sign anywhere indicating what was going on.  Very disappointed and hungry."}
{"text":"Yummy breakfast again! We love their sweet tea, waffles and pancakes.  They have really good coffees and awesome hot chocolate.  Convenient and satisfying."}
{"text":"I have visited Cafe Bliss several times and each time I have had a better experience. The food has always been delicious but the service has been the main concern for me.  Our server tonight was Britney I believe, and she did an excellent job. She was very sweet, knowledgable, and took care of us in a timely manner. In previous visits we had to remind and ask for everything but she anticipated our needs and I think that is very important. I hope she trains the rest of the servers to be just as friendly and efficient.   I look forward to eating there again."}
