{"text":"Run, don't walk, to San Antonio Seafood Market & Oyster Bar!  Five of us traveled from the US...two from New Jersey, two from Dallas and one from San Antonio to visit friends in Woodbridge.  Searching \"Seafood\" on Yelp for lunch this afternoon, we came across this truly fabulous restaurant.  (Given that our friend from San Antonio was the one who suggested seafood, we knew this was the place for us.)

Both the service and the food were exceptional!  We were seated and welcomed by the owners' three grandsons.  Their Mother took our order.  The Chef came to our table to inform us of the off-menu specials and then returned with a bouche amuse of tiny, fried sardines sprinkled with vinegar.  Not only did we engage in a lively conversation with the owners; but, with neighbors from an adjoining business, as well. 

The food...awe, the food was incredibly delicious!  Caponata, grilled calamari, fish & chips, salmon with vegetables and shrimp fettuccine rosa -- made with local, handcrafted pasta -- were so well balanced and served promptly.  Although we cleaned our plates, we couldn't pass up the  two desserts specially prepared and served by the Chef himself -- deconstructed cannoli and affogato.  The \"cherry on top\" were the perfectly constructed cappuccinos."}
{"text":"Wow. I was seriously impressed with the selection, service, cleanliness and quality of San Antonio Seafood Market. It is a family run joint, and they all work there! Paul is one of the son's and was helpful during my visit.

I started at the oyster bar, and got a dozen mixed oysters. All were quite tasty and reasonably priced. They have a giant selection of seafood (fish, squid, scampi) that gets flown in from Italy 3-4x a week!

I returned to try some dishes off the menu. Their lobster bisque was fantastic. Great lobster flavour! Their linguinie vongole $20 was also very good. A little on the salty side, but that flavour is derived from the fresh 1lb of clams they use!

I recommend anyone to check this place out, whether its for a quick oyster snack, meal, or shopping for fresh or frozen seafood."}
{"text":"I was in Toronto on a business trip and my colleague and I did not know what we wanted to eat except for oysters.  We found some yelp reviews about the San Antonio Seafood market which were very promising.  We ordered 2 dozen oysters with the following selection: Irish point, 
 lime, malpack, raspberry point and pockle point.  These oysters were absolutely fresh and delicious.  Since we were still hungry we asked for a suggestion for a pasta and we were told to get the cavatelli  frutti  di mare.  Excellent choice it was; the main ingredients were clams, mussels and prawns with some tomato sauce and light cream.  While I deleted all the pics I took of the meal I must say that it was a winner.  A must visit place if you like seafood and great banter."}
{"text":"Had Fabulous time at San Antonio fish market on the civic holiday weekend,  owner Paul came to introduce the shop after we sat down. We had a dozen oysters, grill octopus and the seafood pasta.  Man, the seafood is fresh!!! Recommend this place for seafood!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable!!!!!!!! What an awesome concept!!!!!! You order fish and your waitress (in our case Elizabeth the owners wife) will walk over to the market side and take what you choose to thr chef!!!!! Can anyone say FRESH!!!!! If you love fish you \"gotta eat here\"!!!!! Now lets talk about the food - there isnt enough words to describe how awesome and absolutely tasty and delectable everything was!!!!!!! I've travelled to Italy  - San Francisco -  all over the states pretty much  and even Portugal and I got to say this is the best fish place ever! And the best part is it's right in our own backyard no need to hop on a plane! No really its a must!!!!"}
{"text":"We just moved into the neighbourhood and are looking for good, reasonably-priced spots that we can go to regularly. San Antonio definitely fits the bill!!! We came originally on a Friday night but unfortunately they were closed by that time, so we came back again on Sunday for lunch. I ordered a scallop/monk fish pasta dish (which was one of the specials for that day) and my husband ordered the grilled octopus. Both exceeded our expectations! The portion was MASSIVE and both dishes were beyond delicious! Like many other reviews have said, the value for price at San Antonio is AMAZING! We will definitely be back and will recommend to any of our friends visiting the area!"}
{"text":"This is the best place for seafood, hands down!  The fresh counter is filled with a huge selection of fish and seafood.  The clerks are very knowledgeable and helpful in advising on how to prepare and cook whatever you're looking to purchase.  The kitchen cranks out fabulous dishes that you can enjoy in the little dining area.  This is clearly a popular option as the owners have recently expanded the seating area to accommodate more dining tables, which is licensed so you can pair a wine or beer with your meal.  The thing that puts this place over the edge is the Lionetti family who all work together to run this place.  They're friendly, happy and eager to serve you as best as they can.  They're always welcoming to familiar and new faces.  The experience here can't be beat."}
{"text":"Awesome calamari ,fish and chips and oysters. Great atmosphere and friendly staff. Nice Italian nook with a Italian groceries with a wide variety."}
{"text":"Awesome lunch today at San Antonio. The owner served our work table and he was fantastic. The options are endless because if they don't have it on the menu you can pick what you want from the fish counter.  The food is fresh and I must say the best fried calamari and shrimp in Vaughan. They even stay open later for bigger parties."}
{"text":"Imagine picking out the fish you want to eat for lunch? Yes you can here! Try the Caponata....simply outstanding!"}
{"text":"What a great place, fresh Seafood from Europe that I haven't seen in years.
Also, an amazing oyster bar and open kitchen.
Best fish taco and calamari,"}
