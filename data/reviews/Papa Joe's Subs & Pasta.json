{"text":"Papa Joes is awesome! Good service and good prices. But the star of the show is the food. Everything on the menu is top quality food, like from a gourmet restaurant. The wings are amazing and my favorite is the superburger. Way better than mr heros romanburger. There are several locations around town. I usually go to mentor but they are all great. Do yourself a favor and check them out!"}
{"text":"Almost everything I've gotten here was great (along with at the Euclid store). Their menu is similar to Mr. Hero, but everything tastes fresher and seems a lot better quality. i always get mozzarella sticks and a cheesesteak. I'm a bit of a fried mozzarella connoisseur and theirs is the best Italian seasoned ones in the area.   Also recommended is the Tuesday pasta special. Currently $10.95 for 2 spaghetti/rigatoni dinners with large meatballs, garlic bread, and a salad (their House Italian dressing is really excellent too)."}
{"text":"Im very happy that the sub shop that I grew up loving so much, has a spot in Mentor! I haven't lived close to one for a few years until they opened this one a few years ago. The all Italian, chicken philly, soups, and of course , waffle fries, are usually what I end up getting. The pasta is great too, when I'm in the mood. This shop makes it all just like the other stores I've frequented in lake county, perfect. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Hands-down one of the best spots for subs. Everything on the menus good. Papa Joe's is known for being one of the best spots."}
{"text":"I used to frequent their store on Euclid Ave. for years when I worked nearby in Wickliffe; and I was never disappointed by anything I tried there. My fav has always been their \"hot all Italian\" and the chicken sandwich is also very good. Like other reviewers I agree that everything is prepared fresh and to order as you stand there; and you can see the staff making the food quickly and efficiently every time. There was always a line in the Euclid location during lunch; but the staff were fast and knew what they were doing, combining counter orders and phone in orders with no lags in service. Will say, also, that the staff are always friendly and polite; and if you're a \"regular\" they'll usually remember what you get! I, too, am happy there is a location in Mentor; as I can now enjoy my favs there when I get the \"munchies\" :-)"}
{"text":"Great subs.  Have been for years.  Fired mushrooms can't be beat either.  The Italian sub is great, so is their turkey sub."}
{"text":"Still a fave, have moved onto salads and soups and all has been equally fabulous. I also get all of my sandwich platters for work here, they're a great price, they'll do whatever sandwiches you want, and give you pickles and peppers to add on for free! It's not subway, so don't expect build your own sub style ordering, but the subs these folks build are fantastic on their own."}
{"text":"Good hot subs!!!!! Great food if you don't want a burger so much....."}
{"text":"I have been going to Papa Joe's for at least 15 years now, or at least since I was allowed to ride my bike beyond our neighborhood, and I have never been disappointed.  Papa Joe's has a wide variety delicious hearty subs, classic Italian dinners, great daily soups, and the best take out appetizers around.  Food-wise, PJ's is can't miss, old school tastiness. If you enjoy fried food, order the fried mushrooms, onion rings or fries.  Unlike most places that serve soggy take-out fried food, Papa Joe's gets it right every time.  They have the best fried mushrooms and onion rings around.  The small subs are 7 inches and most are around $5 or $6 with the large 12 inch subs going for $8 or $9.  The go-to subs for me and my family have always been 1) the deluxe buttered steak sub that is piled with cheese, onions and mushroom and 2) a cold pepperoni and provolone sub with hot peppers added, but you really can't go wrong.  They have all the standard deli meats for cold cuts and even offer chicken parm, veal parm and meatball subs too. They are a subway killer and even have party subs available for large groups.   In addition to the great subs and fried foods, Papa Joe's also has great pasta dinners. They are available with either spaghetti or ravioli and can come with just sauce, sausage, meatballs, veal or chicken. I can vouch for the ravioli and meatballs and am sure the others are just as good. The pastas go for around $6 and you can pay $2 to add salad and a roll but Tuesdays are a pasta special where the salad and roll dinner come at no additional charge.  If you are driving around the east-side and see a Papa John's, stop order some fried mushrooms and a hot buttered deluxe and leave for around $8, which for lunch is unheard of these days."}
{"text":"The food was very good, chick parm & rigatoni...but better than the food or the fantastic price, was the lady who took my order. I so miss when restaurants were happy that you called and even happier to take your order. The 200th Street location seems to remember that their customers are important. One would think being polite and respectful to be automatic, not on the EASTSIDE, usually I feel that I should apologize for asking to order from most of the establishments on this side of Cleveland. Keep it up Papa Joes we need more like you to be the example!"}
{"text":"From driving around the Euclid, Willoughby area I've noticed a number of Papa Joe's but never stopped to try them out. Well finally due to uncertainty on where to eat, I thought to give It a try. Overall it was okay. Pictured below is a chicken philly, fries and a chicken Parmesan. The chicken philly left a lot to be desired. As noted in previous reviews, I'm a chicken philly expert lol. This one however didn't really taste like anything. Again not the worse but I don't think I would order this particular sub again. The chicken parmesan was better, but again it kind of lack something. The quality of ingredients used aren't high but neither are the prices which makes this place a reasonable choice if you need something on the go. The menu does have variety of subs ranging from cold to hot. Overall the experience was okay"}
{"text":"Crispy yet soft skin on medium-cut fries are easily some of the best fries I've had in all of the Land. That statement alone says a lot, no? Ordered the deluxe cheesesteak. Result was loaded with cheese onions and mushrooms. Wouldn't have minded some green peppers, but still very very good.   While this spot is way way out of my way. Next time I'm at the Beachland and I'm looking for a post  show sandwich I'll definitely check this place out again"}
{"text":"Veal parmesan with spaghetti. You can't go wrong. However, be prepared for the greasiest sandwich you ever had. The wall with the business cards has been there forever and it's good time-killing material as you wait for your food which was supposed to be done 5 minutes ago. Still, go try it if you haven't yet."}
{"text":"Love their subs, especially the super burgers ! Also a great deal on I think Tues nights is pasta nights, it's a pasta bucket with large family size salad and garlic bread. Easily enough to feed the whole family."}
{"text":"I live down wind of Papa Joe's for 43 years. I love this place--great subs, something for everyone on this menu. The prices have increased over the years but the quality remains the same. I used to fly to Houston every Sunday afternoon I would always get a jumbol all- italian before the flight. I have never found a sub as good as this. great job--people from all over the city know about this sub shop"}
{"text":"It is hard to pin point the best part about the sandwiches . The bread , meat , cheese and all the topping are top of the line and fresh . Also with all the chain sandwich shops around , this is a family owned and ran business so support local and get a fresh sub or pizza from Poppa Joe's !!!  You will be back for sure"}
{"text":"Food is always good and service is great..very friendly staff. Super burgers are similar to Roman burger at Mr. Heros but a million times better and no upset stomach after. I will keep coming back.."}
{"text":"Not the greatest pasta.  Sauce was beyond watery.  Orange colored water to be honest.  Was looking forward to a good meal.  Pass this one up for sure."}
{"text":"Fantastic food!  Don't think Ive ever had sauce this good.  Fresh & delicious.  Service is great too.  Cant wait to go back.  Don't miss this gem."}
{"text":"Papa Joe's is a Carry Out only and should be the food is to be eaten at home so you can sleep after. Price is good and the food is fantastic. We came on a busy Tuesday and they were still polite and very efficient."}
{"text":"I always call in my order. It's always perfect. I have never left there unhappy or wanting more. Staff is friendly and courteous.  up all the way"}
{"text":"I've been a fan since before I could even say Papa Joes. Everything is prepared fresh in front of you so you can see it is a clean kitchen and staff. There is something on their menu for everyone. I'm kinda picky and I have never received my order made incorrectly or shorted on anything. I have to say I'm a huge fan of their sesame buns, it really takes it a notch above everyone else. If you haven't tried this place or haven't been there for awhile....what are you waiting for?  The only complaint I have is the parking lot is small and awkward and can be tough to maneuver if you have a large vehicle and another large vehicle is also parked in the lot. There is no on street parking available."}
{"text":"Still great food. Sure the shop needs a serious facelift, but the food does not. I still say a  2.5 hour trip just to get food here is worth it. None of the meat is pumped full of water like at Subway and other competitors. The meats here are high quality and only available from places like the West Side market. Definitely not supermarket stuff.  I'd eat here every single day (and used too until I moved away).   Total bill for 2 under $20. And always has been. Love it."}
{"text":"Simply put, the best sub shop I've ever eaten at. Huge selection of subs to choose from, as well as a variety of salads and pasta dishes. The ingredients are fresh, the bread is delicious and local (baked by Orlando). The meats are Sysco quality, which may or may not be your thing but I enjoy them. The hot meats are cooked as you order and are put on the sub hot off the grill, no microwave or toaster oven nonsense. The super burger is hands down my favorite, with the meatball torpedo a close 2nd. The fries are a must-have addition to any order. If you can't find something you like on the menu, you need to get your tongue checked. Anyone from Euclid will tell you the same thing: this is a must-have if you're looking for a quick, cheap, and delicious lunch. Order before hand, however. Also, this is strictly carry out, no eating area."}
{"text":"i miss this place since i moved on the west side  highly recommend the peoper relish!! best subs in wickliffe area"}
{"text":"Damn good food!  It's one of the best places to eat in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Good fresh food.  Close to work.  Take coupons with no problem. My only problem is they continuously make my food wrong.  When i only have a half hour for lunch i dont feel like standing in there for 20 of it.  And the real kicker is that the chick who took my order must gave me a dirty look and NEVER even apologised...  Im not wrong...she is..."}
{"text":"I used to eat hear all the time when I was in high school. It's still a great sub shop. I like their All Italian Sub; the Italian dressing they use is great and there is a ton of meat. I also love the Sausage Torpedoe with mushrooms and provolone. And you can't forget their Fried Mushrooms...mmm! They also have their bucket of spaghetti or rigatoni family dinner. Sounds better than KFC."}
{"text":"For me, Papa Joe's is the \"gold standard\" for which I judge all sub sandwiches. I have been coming here for years, and they have always been consistently good. My friends from out of state always make it a point to stop at Papa Joe's whenever they come back home to visit. Whether it's an All-Italian, a Hot Buttered Steak, or a Super Burger... It's all good!"}
{"text":"Great little sub shop. Stopped on our way through Cleveland and it was perfect. There's no seating inside and very little parking outside. We just got it to go (which is the only way) and took our subs to the near by park and ate next to the lake. Good size subs and fries..we paid $12 for two people."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy here. Take out sandwiches and pasta. Bread is good but rest of ingredients aren't high quality but the price is right. It's good for basic chessesteaks and turkey subs. Think a grade above steak-ums. My sandwich came right off the grill, cheese was melted, and mushrooms tasted like from a can. But I liked still liked it. Four teenagers stood in front of store (outside) smoking cigarettes the whole time I was there, so you know it must be a hot spot."}
{"text":"I love their Veggie Sub, warmed up with Italian Dressing, yum!"}
{"text":"Nothing too great about the place and nothing too bad about the place. I've eaten here only a few times and the food js average. You know while you're eating the food it's not healthy but kinda tasty. If your in the mood for don't ask how many calories are in this meal lol stop here and get a to go order. Its a local pleasure so just take it for what it is."}
{"text":"Overcharged on food item. Not cool. Price listed but forced to pay more. Just be aware when you order. Listed prices are not honored."}
{"text":"I was looking for a good place to grab a sub around the neighborhood (just moved to Collinwood last March).  I ordered the deluxe buttered cheese steak.  It was great, nice to have a sesame (& wheat?) bun rather than plain jane white bread.  It was delicious, plenty of food, and from the looks of the menu, I could eat there a bunch and find several solid favorites.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Went to lunch today at papa joes and got a deluxe hot buttered cheese steak and mozzarella sticks. The sandwich was awesome just like always but I decided I wanted to try a side of mozzarella sticks. They were $5.25 so I figured I would get a good amount... I only got 5 and they were like grocery store bought and microwaved. So in conclusion, 5 stars for the sub and 1 star for the mozzarella sticks. 3 overall. The cashier was nice and I'll probably go back, just not for the mozzarella sticks."}
