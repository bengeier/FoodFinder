{"text":"By far one of the best pizzerias in Laval.  Great subs, ribs, and poutine too.  In my mind what makes this old style pizza so delicious is the sauce."}
{"text":"Ordered from here twice.  The first time I ordered their ribs along with fries and a choice of salad which I went with Greek. Their ribs were pretty good but the fries are soggy and undercooked. This should be considered a crime. The side salad was impressively huge! And was pretty decent. This alone would have warranted a 3 star rating.  But I ordered from there a second time.  This time I went with a pizza with fries (forgot my experience the first time) along with the memorable Greek side salad. The pizza was terrible. FAR TOO MUCH SAUCE WAS USED. The dough was super greasy and soggy and the texture of the pizza was disgusting. The fries were undercooked again! I thought my Greek salad could salvage the meal but for some reason it didn't meet my expectations. Furthermore, the feta didn't taste of anything. It was tasteless.   Did the terrible pizza temporarily damage my taste buds? Possibly but I won't be ordering from here anytime soon."}
{"text":"Average pizza place with all the side nic-nacs. From fries to ribs and of course their pizza. The pizza was really soggy, and dripping of tomato sauce. Fries wise, I rather have fries at McDonald's.  Their fries were not cooked fully, so it was eating a raw starchy potato. Really not the one to go back to."}
{"text":"Unfortunately another really bad pizza place in the neighborhood... And the rest of their food is terrible. Also their drivers are wack jobs... Avoid and be happy"}
