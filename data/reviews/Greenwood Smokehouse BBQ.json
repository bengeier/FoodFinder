{"text":"Barques used to be my go to BBQ restaurant but Greenwood has definitely surpassed it. I'm using Barques as a comparison, just because it was my absolute fave and hold it to a high standard. The bf and I shared a small platter... And for a small, the price (and portions!) was definitely right. For only $39 you get almost double what you would get for the platter at Barque's plus TWO huge sides included. In terms of flavours, all the different kinds of meat had their own distinct BBQ-y goodness. Holy hell they were all GOOD. The only downside was that their ribs had that kind of spice (or was it the smokey char flavour?) that kinda makes the meat taste off .. I don't exactly know how to describe it but the bf says that was what he loved about it. The other downside for me was that their Caesar was meh. (I love, love, love Caesar's). Anyway. Service was amazing too. Julia (cute short redhead) was our main server but everyone took care of us. Definitely coming back!!!!"}
{"text":"I went one time only --- with my son and his girlfriend. We had the sampler plate and beers. It was good, but when you compare Arizona barbecue and real cowboys, it is not wow. I would go again because it is unique, the wait staff helpful, but kind of hyper, and the prices reasonable. I just bought a gift certificate and will be returning with some grilfriends. I am anxious to hear what they have to say. Really liked the brisket."}
{"text":"Good spot. Delicious smokey smell on entering the premises and the atmosphere is good inside, has a rustic, casual, homey feel with diner style seating. Was too hot to sit on the patio so I don't know if that is different. 
They run a limited menu for brunch and I had the Danforth Decker which is enormous!! I couldn't finish it. In fact it was so big I felt a bit over faced by it. I would have preferred a smaller more manageable portion. It's very rich and tasty but it could have benefitted from having a nod at some greenery to accompany it. 
Overall a good experience but it's a very Carnivore type place."}
{"text":"I've been cooking BBQ for a while now, and I gotta say- you can't beat the ribs at Greenwood! Love this place- the staff & owner are awesome folks. Can't recommend it enough."}
{"text":"Fan of BBQ restaurants and this was my first visit despite living in the area.
I had the wings (Tuesday special I believe) which were great. Definitely a cut above a typical sports bar, breaded and deep fried wings. They were clearly smoked with a definite pink smoke lines instead and great earthy, woody taste from the smoke. A quick deep fry ensured a cripsy outside. The wings themselves were large and meaty with a light coating of sauce.
The venue and service itself was very good. More kitsch than hipster pretentiousness which I enjoyed. Ie more leslieville pumps than aft.
I also ordered coconut cream pie in mason jar which was I thought was a bit pricey at $8 and quite large serving size, but it tasted amazing socan't complain too much ."}
{"text":"Great smokey BBQ flavour and very friendly staff. We went for my brother's birthday and they even helped us serve the birthday cake. It also helps that they have awesome music playing at all times. The 6 person platter was a little small for all 6 of us but we had 3 big eaters at the table. I'd definitely go back!"}
{"text":"It's a bit pricey compared  to other options, though I'd say a solid option on taste alone. However, I've been twice and both times my wife and I got home with an upset stomach. You can see things are a little loosy goosy with the storage and kitchen at times. They're nice and have a good offering, but they really need to get more focus."}
{"text":"Probably not the best BBQ joint I've been to but they do a pretty good pulled pork sandwich. Have had the wings and they were really good. Wasn't a fan of the beef brisket (found it to be a little too fatty). And the ribs a little too dry. With all that said, above average BBQ joint and I will definitely be back. Highly recommend the pulled pork and wings! They also have a back patio but it's pretty small."}
{"text":"Dear bbq enthusiasts,
As we all know there are countless bbq joints in the city but only a handful of places that deserve a four plus star review. My husband and I ordered their smoked ribs, wings, mushroom and onion burger and poutine. All the meats were fresh, juicy and filled with flavour. Big portions and quick service was an unexpected surprise. Nice neighbourhood restaurant with a right to the point menu. Would be nice if they had more tables and a bigger bar to sit in while waiting for a table."}
{"text":"Yummy food and good beer on a cozy patio.

Had a full rack of ribs, salad, coleslaw and mac n' cheese, all of which were great. Drank a pitcher of beer and watched the Argentina vs Iran World Cup match on the patio, to celebrate a friends birthday."}
{"text":"Everything here is great, from the pulled pork to the burgers... Great casual dining on the Danny  Also a great selection of local beers"}
{"text":"This is a nice and casual BBQ place

The server recommended to try a platter as u can try all different kind of proteins. Have to say that the ribs, wings and brisket were really good.... Especially the BBQ wings. 

The BBQ sauce on all was also very tasty.

Overall the service incredibly friendly and fast

Check the place out..."}
{"text":"Great ribs! Delicious smokey taste! Their fries are amazing! I highly recommend bourbon sour! Uniquely flavoured...they smoke the lines too. This place is definitely a new favourite of mine."}
{"text":"We popped in here at the beginning of May to try it out.

The good is that the staff were friendly, there were a few selections of drinks available and that we didn't have to wait very long for the food.

Now, my girl and I both had the pulled pork sandwich and though the meat was ok, the bun (I think an egg bread) was stale. It holds everything in so it doesn;t get soggy or all apart which is good but the taste wasn't right.

They need to allow for a selection of sauces to be made available at the table as the pulled pork was just too dry on its own.

The greens that came with it were excellent and the most enjoyable part."}
{"text":"Super friendly service, great food, big portions!  What more do you need to know?  Priced right for a mid-week treat, we will be back with more friends on tow!

Ribs were excellent, by the way."}
{"text":"The pulled pork and brisket was so tender and delicious!  Never had anything like that!  Only thing is that the ribs were tasty but not fall off the bone tender.  Wings weren't as good as I would expect.  But overall, I would go back for the brisket and pulled pork."}
{"text":"Great food,  cozy atmosphere, and friendly staff! I can't wait for the patio to open to this place in the summer!

My only complaint is the music played was a radio station  (Indie 88). I really like that radio station but it's not great background music for a restaurant. Especially when commercials come on.

Other than that, I can't wait to be back!"}
{"text":"Great smoke house eats and tasty beers. Yum. We had the platter, (twice). Both times, four of us enjoyed being wonderfully stuffed, as well as having great lunches the next day. (They say it can feed eight, but we enjoy stuffing ourselves.)
Should you cross town to come here? I don't care, stay home and leave this place as a great local eatery for us locals. (I wouldn't want it to get too busy).
Yum, happiness is a full belly, without having to go down town and all that fuss."}
{"text":"Great ribs and wings. Has a small patin in the back. Overall a smaller place but very cosy and staff is prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"Was really excited to see this place opening.  I have friends who've been and loved it.  I had a terrible experience.  Ordered the brisket to go, it was swimming in grease.  Tasty, but not good enough to get passed the drippy oily mess.  The fries were uneven, some were almost raw and others were cooked, not sure how that happened.  Won't go back, pretty expensive to throw most of it out.  I hate giving anyone 1 star, so I'm being generous with 2."}
{"text":"I've had a lot of BBQ and I gotta say I was quite disappointed by my experience here. Ordered a few beers upon arrival, the $5 tall cans were nice. Was with 2 other buddies so we grabbed the medium platter ($69). We arrived at 7:55 on a Sunday, our meal didn't arrive to our table until 9pm. Over an hour wait is unacceptable, especially due to the fact that the restaurant wasn't at all busy. The platter was small, reminiscent of a two party platter anywhere else (I live in the Soo, here the same platter is $40...). The server had told us that it was large enough for 3-4 hungry individuals. The ribs were overcooked and dry, far from fall of the bone. The collard greens were very bland, definitely not what you'd eat in the Carolinas. We left still hungry and unsatisfied. The servers did not attend to us or give us any reasonable excuse for the eternal wait. Would not return, except maybe for a beer or two."}
{"text":"Definately one of the best BBQ place. I am glad it is not getting big hit and start a line up. The service is ok, but the food is amazing, especially the beef brisket sandwich, it is to die for. Unlike lots of BBQ place, Greenwood's brisket is actually very juicy and tender. it makes me think of it for the entire week after having one for dinner. But if you are on diet, sorry this place is not for you."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Very helpful and friendly staff. Prices are reasonable for a smokehouse. 
I tried the decker and filthy chicken sandwiches and the beef brisket tacos. Everything was good, nothing spectacular. I would go back and recommend. I like the flavour of the chicken and would order the hot Tennessee sandwich next time."}
{"text":"While the food is great, their hours are erratic. It says open until 11pm but you walk in at 9 and they tell you the kitchen is closed. This is the third time it's happened. So how about you post on your site that your kitchen closes really really really early. Sort of lost interest in this place since they do t stay open late.."}
{"text":"This used to be my go to spot for brisket sandwiches. I ordered delivery through uber eats today and was extremely disappointed to learn that the portion sizes have gotten smaller. There was a time that neither my girlfriend nor I could finish them. Nevertheless, they still had great flavour, just wish they were larger and less expensive. Will likely not order or visit them again."}
{"text":"This place smells great from outside while walking past - it lured us in!  I had the Angus Burger and my wife had the Mushroom Burger.  My burger didn't taste that smokey, but my wife's was super smokey and delicious.  The only thing I would recommend for the restaurant is to make it a touch less greasy, but otherwise it was yummy."}
{"text":"I found the brisket and pulled pork not as tender as before.  Found it a bit tough.  Had such high hopes for it too.  Mac and cheese was awesome though."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our food from GS BBQ , ordered from DoorDash, next time we'll pop by"}
{"text":"Father's day fail.   Overall taste is good. Good amount of smoke, mustard in pulled pork Carolina low country style, ribs savory and without the Texas Crutch (meaning they have a nice chew - not fall off the bone). But please, don't tell me the combo has 1/2lb of pulled pork and give me 200g, or that you get a pint of collard greens and give me 300ml. Portions so small we used a measuring cup and scale to double check. Also, they left the silverskin on the underside of the ribs - very amateur. First lesson in preparing ribs is to remove the silverskin because it is inedible and rubbery. Buns were day old stale. Picked up our order at 4:40. After checking our order we left a VM at 5pm after ringing twice - no callback to date. Overall, good recipes but sloppy execution. I won't be back."}
{"text":"The only reason i put 3 star instead of 4 is that i'm vegetarian and although this place says they have things for vegetarians, there really are only 2 or 3 choices. i had a mushroom burger and was still hungry afterwards. 

I also will mention that it is very funky and decorated inside, which is great, but the place is really small, so if you have a larger party (think 5 people or more), you may have to wait for a bit. we were a group of 6 and initially told it would be 25-30 mins. it ended up being 50 min and we were all way too hungry by that point. 

My meat eating friends did seem to enjoy their meals, but they really need better vegetarian and vegan options."}
{"text":"Tasty bbq food. The brisket was smoked to tender perfection. Solid selection of local craft beer. 
The patio out back was fine, if a little cramped .... In retrospect should have sat at the front for better atmosphere."}
{"text":"Loved the concept, decor and vibe. There was a big line, and a hustle and bustle of families/mixed ages. 

Menu is limited but interesting choices. Had the mushroom burger with avocado (tasteless, fell apart and was cold) with a side of poutine (mushy and tasteless) Mac & Cheese (tasteless). I had hoped for more. 

The craft beer selection was great. Service was efficient. Since they are just getting started, I will probably give them another chance."}
{"text":"I have now enjoyed Greenwood Smokehouse four times but just getting to the review now.  Keep in mind, I have only ever ordered pickup or delivery, I've never actually eaten in the restaurant though I did have a pint while waiting for them to put things together.  The atmosphere when I walk in for pick-up feels a little like rocknroll bbq.  I kinda want to do a shot of bourbon.  The smell of the place is unreal if you're a carnivore.

I have also only ever ordered the platters.  I believe we've had a couple mediums and a couple large one.  Off the top of my head (you can find their menu on their website), in a medium platter you get:
- 4 or 5 smoked ribs, sliced so you're not ripping it apart
- 3 or 4 smoked chicken wings (whole, you have to pull them apart)
- a 500ml (?) tub of pulled pork
- a 500ml (?) tub of brisket
- coleslaw
- choice of two additional sides (I LOVE the collard greens and mac n cheese is so good, I always upgrade to a full size)

Ok, so now you look at the price and you think, $69!!!!  F THAT!  Let's order 2 Pizza's for $19.99!  I get it and sometimes I make that stupid choice too.  I would imagine, you're not going to eat this food on a weekly basis.  Maybe bi-weekly or monthly.  Cuz it's got punch.  It will satisfy the cave-person carnivore in you.  And it may not even sound like a lot of food: \"Half rack of ribs?  I just had all you can eat ribs at St. Louis and destroyed three racks!\"  These ain't those ribs.  We've had leftovers with four guys eating the medium platter.  You get a bit of everything and your plate is full like Thanksgiving dinner.

I don't know how to judge \"authentic\" BBQ, all I know is that this place has crushed 4 out of 4 times for me and my friends.  I definitely recommend giving them a go."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to the Greenwood Smokehouse for my last birthday, my choice of course.  I am always looking for a great new spot, and a great new BBQ spot is a bonus.  While the Greenwood Smokehouse did not hit it out of the park for me, it definitely delivered good service, good atmosphere, decent BBQ but really reasonable prices.

I had the half rack of ribs, my wife got the pull pork tacos (I believe they were a special) and we got an order of wings.  As I said before, all of the food was good but not great.  The portion sizes were pretty good, though my wife said the bread to meat ratio could be better.  The ribs were a bit fattier than I would have like and, as another reviewer stated, the wings do come with the tip still attached (which to me doesn't really matter one way or the other).  

All in all, I have told a few friends about the Greenwood Smokehouse so I guess I cannot say I wouldn't recommend it, I just wouldn't go out of my way again to pop back in."}
{"text":"Completely average. I had mushroom soup and angus burger. Neither were bad but soup was a little greasy and burger too dry. Wasn't asked how I liked the meal so they didn't seem too interested in feedback. My friend had brisket that was reviewed with a simple shrug. 

Service was good but they seemed a little confused about who was covering orders from the bar. We were generally able to get requests in though. 

I am not making plans to return."}
{"text":"Tried this place yesterday, with two friends. 
They both ordered the ribs, but couldn't cope with the spiciness. 
I had the special, the beef brisket poutine. So filling, so yummy and great value at $12 for a very large portion.
I didn't try anything else on the menu so can't report.
The water was room temp (I prefer cold) but no big deal.
They dealt with my friends \"issues\" very well, packaged one of them to go, and replaced the others meal..... she really couldn't cope with the spice.
Certainly glad I tried it, would possibly return. I do however like trying new places more than frequenting the same spots."}
{"text":"Very good Platter for 4. Serves 5-6! Friendly service. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Happened to see that this was included as a \"top new restaurants in TO\" feature on Huffpost and since it's in my hood, and I was in my once in a blue moon, meat desirous mood, I headed over almost immediately after coming across the internet feature. I was there on day 3 of their being open apparently and warmly greeted by the staff who looked a little nervous, but didn't have to be ;) 
Decor is warm and inviting. Very homey which I appreciate and feel most Danforther-s will too. 
And for the food? Delicious! I had the brisket, which was served on some really soft, and delicious, old school white bun and was as I imagine brisket should be. Melt in your mouth-like and not too drippy. The salad I had chosen in lieu of the fries because I was going to a yoga class that afternoon and didn't want to be completely done for due to heaviness, was both plentiful and light. I can attest to the fries smelling delicious though, also for their homemadenss. The potato delivery came in while I was there and there is no way these guys have frozen fries stashed away as well. 
I chatted with the owner and the servers for a bit and they just seemed so excited about their food and their restaurant, you couldn't help but want to support them. Another feature I enjoyed is their emphasis on veggie options. Half the menu is vegetarian friendly and the owner seemed particularly excited about his vegan mayo and mushroom burger. Will def try next time and nice that I'll be able to go with my boyfriend who is a 100% vegetarian. And in a smoke house no less. I appreciate this new veggie friendly trend (Harvest Kitchen I'm looking at you*) Will be back for sure. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Probably the best poutine I've had in my entire life, with brisket that melts in your mouth (marinated for 12 hours and then smoked for another 8-12 hours) and drippings from the smoked meat as gravy. Try the veggie burger too, delicious mushrooms and eggplant mixed with avocado and chipotle in the patty. The ribs are amazing too and the owners are great."}
{"text":"When we picked up two full racks of ribs during the taste of Danforth we were blown away with the perfectly grilled yummy bbq flavour.  

Some weeks later we returned absolutely salivating over the fond memories.   Our sophomore visit was a huge let down though.   Mainly due to the hurried and poor service.  We ordered two full racks both \"wet\" and a few sides.  

The two racks were distinctly different.  One dry, the other wet.  Our waitress told us that we were wrong and both were indeed wet.  They weren't.  We backed down and choked them back in disbelief.  Good.   Not great.  

A month or so later we thought we would give them another chance.   This time same server, even worse service.  

We sat at the bar.  For about 15 minutes watching the bartender serve many other patrons - some who came after we were seated - never even looking at us.  We finally flagged her and asked if we could get served. Her response? \"Yup. Sure hon.  I'm a bit busy here\".  

\"Thanks but no thanks\" we said getting up to go \"we'll find a spot that wants our business\". 

Brutal service.  Adequate food.  Too many other spots to try, so definitely not worth another go.
------------


Well kudos to Warren, the owner, for reaching out and trying to make things right by offering us a credit towards another shot at this spot.  He started off by telling me that the server from hell had been let go.  We walked in only to be greeted by said satanic server.  Not a great start.   Ok.   We pushed through.  

It WAS better than the previous two visits.   And the menu had just changed.   So we tried some of the new items.  Decent.  Not off the hook.  But decent.  We tried a new Sammy- the decker.   It was good.   Would make for a great lunch.   And I liked the hush puppies but they need a light dip to make them work....a dill or a lemon aioli.    And I have to agree with some of the other posters here....the smoked foods have this weird kerosene like flavour going on.  Maybe it's normal...but it's just unsettling enough that it needs to be explained to patrons.   Overall I can live with the flavours.  My wife cannot.  So for us, it's a miss.  

Service was better.  But not good.  She lacked some of the basic skills - the table next to us was seated after us but served before us.  Warm water served in old bourbon bottles was more gross than charming.  Overall Kinda clueless across the board.   

Great effort on the part of the owner, just still not quite there for us.   It really pains me to even write this review....he really tried hard to woo us back...he even introduced me to a delicious bourbon on the house - American Honey - but I decided that I had to be honest in this update.   It's a pass for us."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Greenwood Smokehouse BBQ once, and ordered from it once. The first time we did take out I had a poutine, and the pulled pork sandwich. The sandwich was good, but the poutine was a big disappointment. The fries were bad, and the cheese was hardly melted. We decided to give it another chance because we had done take-out so we went for sit-in. 
When we ate in we shared the pulled pork sandwich, which was once again good, and also split the Black Angus Burger - which was OK, but not compared to the pulled pork. 
The pulled pork is pretty standard (which isn't a bad thing, it's just not better than everywhere else).

With a relatively limited menu it doesn't make it easy to warrant going back again unless someone is going specifically for pulled pork."}
{"text":"As usual, I love looking for good and cheap BBQ and Greenwood Smokehouse does not disappoint. Their BBQ is just the right amount of smokey flavour and tenderness that I would expect from a grizzled dad who's been cooking for the fam since he bought his beloved grill (which he would never stop bringing up since he got it). Seriously, you can taste the love on the BBQ. Getting the BBQ spread for 2 filled up two people as it should, and I eat like a horse.

The servers also match the atmosphere as both times I've gone, the waiters were jolly as well as helpful in recommendations. The decor is a mix of geeky Star Wars and rustic country theme, fitting in with the homey flavours and southern hospitality. Beer selection is superb too, as you would expect from a joint on Danforth.

I would highly recommend this place if you're craving good BBQ and tasty beer.

Washrooms are clean and decor is homey, 4/5 restroom."}
{"text":"There was definitely a distinct smell of a smoke house as soon as we walked in. Good and bad, I guess? We ordered chicken wings and the pulled pork sandwich. The wings were on the dry side, although the hot sauce was flavoured nicely. The taste of pulled pork was not bad, however it was served on a small supermarket hamburger bun, and it just didn't do the pork justice. We also found the portion size to be too small. 
The server was very attentive. The music was not conducive to create the atmosphere."}
{"text":"I saw this place on my way from Pape Station to Mr. Pide (you also have to try this place) and decided to look it up on yelp and bookmark it. To my surprise there also happened to be a Yelp deal $15 for $30 available so I purchased it. The following Tuesday I came here for dinner which happened to be Taco Tuesday and $5 Pints. 

I didn't come for their tacos, but I did get a nice pint of a coffee stout. I ordered the rib tips because dry dusted and double sauced, who could resist that temptation? As a mac n cheese lover, I also had to try a side portion of theirs with three cheese cream and asiago sauce. My dishes came and I couldn't wait to dig in, but I took our server up on her offer of hot sauce. They have a jalapeno sauce and a ghost pepper sauce which combined worked so well with the mac n cheese. The jalapeno sauce had the flavour of jalapenos, but wasn't spicy at all and the ghost pepper sauce could have been hotter, but that's just my taste preference. Now for the rib tips, absolutely delicious, saucy, and flavourful. You could taste some of that smoke from the smoker and it paired nicely with the mac n cheese. You don't see rib tips offered at a lot of BBQ joints so I was very excited and not disappointed in their delivery. 

My sister ordered the Danforth Decker and it was a really good mix of their meats. The sandwich itself is like having two sandwiches, very filling. It's also a $17 sandwich so it's great for sharing. Get the coleslaw and add it to your sandwich for an even better taste.

Their prices are a bit high so I was glad for the $15 savings, but you are paying for some great smoked BBQ. You can also see that their prices have increased since they first opened based on a Yelper's picture of their menu.

Note that you will go home smelling like the smoker. It will be on your clothes and on your hair, but there is no way to avoid this. Also remember they are closed Mondays!"}
{"text":"Tried the brisket and pulled pork sandwiches. Both were excellent, not too wet, not too dry, sauce tasty but not sweet. I just came back from a trip through the southern states and ate some stellar barbecue, and this deserves comparison. A little on the pricey side, but I'll be back."}
{"text":"We had the pulled pork, beef brisket, poutine and baked beans. Out of all that it was the brisket that stood out having great flavour where as the pork was bland. Poutine was ok as were the beans. Saw rave reviews about the ribs - we'll give those a try."}
{"text":"Overpriced hipster food, with mediocre service. 

The ribs that i ate when I was here were good, but that's about it.,"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday around 4pm

Pros:
- Nice ambiance (old-school bar-iah) 
- Large Portions 
- Good service 

Cons:
- A little pricey 
- Way too much grease"}
{"text":"I bought takeout. Food was good but not fabulous. I would buy there again."}
{"text":"Place is great! 
We got a small platter with a side for coleslaw. It was a perfect amount for two people to share.

I would say the ribs + wings were probably my favourite, bursting with smokiness and flavour!!!"}
{"text":"Service was great!!! Restaurant was awesome themed but I did not like the sauce on the meat... It may be for some people but not me. I'm still giving it a 4 even tho I didn't like the food cause the place was still worth the experience.

And the deal was super easy to use as well!!
 

*guy with the beard behind the bar was awesome! 


Cheers"}
{"text":"Went there to celebrate a birthday with friends. We collectively had the following menu items: poutine, half rack ribs, the burger, Mac 'n cheese, and the mushroom soup. Everyone was satisfied all round. Particularly the ribs were very well received by all that had them- we all opted to have sauce. The burger was massive we added chipotle mayo option.  The mushrooms soup was smoky creamy and delicious. The poutine had great fries that didn't go soggy with the gravy. And the Mac n cheese while not a traditional looking cheese sauce was cheesy savory and had plenty of flavor that was liked by all.

Our server Mish was The Shit! She was great! Kept our drinks filled frequently and the food was prompt. 

Highly recommend. Larger groups should go early on peak nights as they do fill up."}
{"text":"Got the small sampler plate with myself and my friend. Wings, brisket, pulled pork, and ribs. I'm not a huge fan of ribs but I have to say these were probably one of my favorite ribs. I also usually don't think pulled pork is very tasty but they did a great job with it too, nicely smoked and full of flavour. 

I also loved their brisket but not more than the ribs or pulled pork, which is saying something because I usually like brisket the best. The wings were the least interesting of the bunch, but still good. I'd see if I could replace the wings with more meat if possible. 

Would love to come back here, maybe try some of the other stuff. We had fries on the side, and I'm thinking I'd like to try some of the other sides too... Lots of people were getting the mac and cheese, and that looked pretty fantastic."}
{"text":"We were very disappointed with this restaurant. I had really been looking forward to going here as it's only a short walk away and it always smells so delicious when I've walked by. The service was my main issue. The food was mediocre. Our server brought us water immediately after we were seated but then disappeared. We weren't asked what we'd like to drink for 15 mins. Finally he came up the stairs and to our back corner table which appeared as if we were just sat at and forgotten, didn't apologize and took our order. We waited another 25 mins for our food and beer and when the food came, it was COLD. It took us another couple of minutes to find him because again, he disappeared. Our food was ready (they made us a new plate which I appreciated), but it literally just sat there ready to be picked up for a few minutes as he was no where to be found. Another server looked a bit puzzled as one of the cooks kept ringing the bell and noticed us looking at her and finally she brought it over. Since he wasn't able to make his way to our table at any point during the meal, we asked the female server who brought our food to bring us the bill and then low and behold, he shows up with the bill. A really nice gentlemen next to us offered to pay for our dinner. It was a really nice gesture and I'm sure I would have had a tough time even accepting but our server just kept telling the man to keep his card! I just felt like he had not been there the whole night and here he is...so bizarre. Finally we paid and walked out and he didn't even look up at us when we left. Terrible terrible service. The beef brisket was tough... not tender enough. I've definitely had better. Won't go there again."}
{"text":"There always seems to be people who tend to pretentiously compare BBQ here in Toronto with what they have experienced in the states, or with what they have seen on the food network. These same people usually never have anything positive to say about a Canadian smokehouse, simply because it's here in Toronto.

 I personally have experienced deep south BBQ contests and a few in Texas as well where they believe they invented BBQ lol, ultimately there really isn't much difference, the main differences are in the rub and marinades, that's what usually sets them all apart, but really the differences are marginal at best. In my opinion and experience, american meat is generally lower quality than it is here in Canada... regardless if it's here or in the states, If BBQ is done properly, then  they will all be  various levels of delicious. It's pretty difficult to screw up unless you overcook it.  

That being said, my experience with Greenwood Smokehouse was excellent, i ordered the \"Danforth Decker\" and my friend ordered the mac and cheese with their house cured bacon. The danforth decker was a crazy sammy made with rib meat, beef brisket, pulled pork and their house cured bacon along with two generous slices of real cheddar on both sides and served on toasted challah bread, wow!! the portions were huge and the sandwich was incredibly good, it had a deep smoke flavour along with their delicious bbq sauce, it was really quite divine, something i'd definitely order again. 

My friend ordered the Mac and cheese and added their bacon to it, he was amazed at how good the bacon was and just kept mumbling wow after every few bites. he got the fiull sized portion and could barely finish it.  I know some whined about this place using kraft cheese slices and wonderbread, but speaking from experience, they must have been somewhere else or really high.... or both... 

Overall this place served us some very high quality food, prepared/smoked with lots of love and it showed. This is definitely one of the better smokehouses/BBQ joints in the city as well. I'd advise not to listen to the few negatives below, as some people can never be made happy, they will complain about anything... It's BBQ folks, what do you want it to be? this isn't Haute cuisine, this is down home , back yard smoky deliciousness! I for one will definitely return again and again whenever i have the urge for BBQ"}
{"text":"Atmosphere- Very Cool & fits the food!  Makes for a good vibe.  Loved the tunes & our server was awesome! :). Even more so, I love that we have a smokehouse in the area.

Service- was great altho when we walked in we stood there for a bit and was just stared at by 4 or 5 different employees.  We sat at the very back of house, which might have been a mistake as it was freezing at times. (Like huge freezer doors were open or maybe they have the a/c cranked up for the kitchen staff.  I think it was the owner or one of that came out and said Hi and asked how we like the food and how we heard about them.  Nice, good guy!  

Food- husband and I ordered the beef brisket with fries and the pork brisket with salad.  We loved the food, I especially loved the beef brisket and fries will be back for it.  Fresh cut fries were excellent too!  I enjoyed my salad with a balsamic dressing too.
 We will totally be back and next time I really hope to give them a 5* as a truly believe they got a good thing going!"}
{"text":"One of the most enjoyable restaurant experiences I've had!

We were greeted and led to an awesome table that allowed us to see the smoke masters prep and assemble incredibly delicious plates. The guys behind the grill were friendly and answered all of our questions - they even brought us out back to see the smoker, which was cool!

I had the pulled pork sandwich that was enhanced with the delicious in house root beer hot sauce! It was even better than it sounds! We also sampled the jalapeño with apple in house sauce and the dr pepper with  ghost pepper in house sauce. All were delicious, but the root beer one really hit the spot for me. My dining partner had the brisket and said it was one of the best she'd ever had.

Our hosts went out of their way to give us great food and make us feel valued. I can't wait to go back once the patio is open and try out a few more of their offerings!"}
{"text":"First time here we did takeout... wanted to try something different as we typically go to Hogtown Smoke. 

I asked about BBQ sauces... they don't have any other than what's on the meat. Ok cool. 

We got the brisket, rib tips, and pork ribs - all excellent flavour and you absolutely don't need side sauces! 

We also got a side of Hushpuppies which I was slightly nervous about... didn't want some nasty fried greasy things. Turns out they were one of the best sides and they come with their own sauce. 

Their homemade hot sauce had excellent flavour but wasn't seasoned which was strange. We added some salt... problem solved. 

Also ordered a side of collared greens but there was an issue in the kitchen and they turned out usually spicy. Called to tell them and they were receptive to the feedback - will credit us back on next visit. 

We'll be back for sure..."}
{"text":"Just love this place, always tasty! While I haven't dined in, I've gotten takeout a few times. Their brisket is to die for. The atmosphere inside is perfect: subtly lit, rustic and southern casual feel. Friendly service every time I pick up."}
{"text":"Yelp deal encouraged me and my friend to go, but the food was great. We shared the special, which was a smoked chicken sandwich, and the mac n' cheese. We were stuffed! It was delicious."}
{"text":"I've been going here for about 1.5 years now, on a weekly basis the last few months! The staff are great! The food is great! You can hang out at the bar with the locals and non-locals and get to know everyone's names; like at the Cheers bar! Ha! Sometimes a newbie will come in and you can help them through the menu, it's that kind of relaxed environment. I've never really had a place to call my local hangout, my second home but they are that place to me. 

Garett is the Executive Chef and he and the kitchen crew are awesome. Try the platter first as an intro to the smoked meats. You get some pulled pork, wings, ribs and brisket; with one side like coleslaw, beans, collards or hush puppies. Tuesdays are taco night. Wednesdays are wings night. Thursdays is the burger night. Fridays is the smoked meat sandwich night. A must try! It is not like the traditional Montreal smoked meat, its cut thick and with a Dijon mustard mayo. It will blow your mind! Montreal pales in comparaison to me now. It's addictive! The Fricken Chicken is new and it's delicious! 

They do brunch on the weekends. They are closed on Mondays. The new manager has started making some new cocktails. They have a great selection of beers. 

Go. Go right now. You'll thank me. You're welcome!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed the *Montreal Smoked Meat. It was juicy, a bit fatty but that made it taste awesome. They go through the *MSM fast so arrive early on a Friday (*MSM only served on fridays). We also enjoyed the pulled pork. It had a very nice BBQ sauce and was very pull apart and tender. The portions are fairly large we could not finish our meals. The heaping load of fries were nicely seasoned. 
Definitely recommend giving this place a try if you like BBQ."}
{"text":"Pulled pork, ribs, and briskets are their specialty. If you walk in, you can smell the smokiness already. And once you take a bite, you'll taste the awesomeness. 

We ordered half rack of ribs ($15), pulled pork sandiwch ($11), Brisket sandwich ($12). All were very good. I though the briskets were so so. If I come back, it's all about the pulled pork and ribs.

I thought the prices are a bit high but since the smokiness is good, I'll let this slide. The sides are expensive starting at $7 but the portion is pretty good."}
{"text":"Greenwood Smokehouse has amazing food.
The service was a bit slow considering how many staff members there were, but it was worth the wait."}
{"text":"I'd  like to know how this place is. It seems to be great but we've tried to order through Just-Eat, then through Foodora at a later date and they keep canceling our order. They don't even do it right away. At first it was confirmed then it was canceled 45 minutes later. Doesn't seem like a reliable place. The photos of the staff handling food with their hands was a bit of a turn-off but we thought we'd give it a try anyway. I guess it's just one of many restaurants that doesn't have reliable good standards."}
{"text":"The place has a decent room, and some good variety on the menu to choose from. Overall, the food is mediocre at best. Nothing  on the menu was jaw dropping delicious enough to make a return visit for us."}
{"text":"The Greenwood Smokehouse sits unassumingly on Danforth St. I walked past it once without realizing. That would have been a regrettable and huge mistake, but thankfully I was directed to visit by fellow foodies. The back patio was cozy and intimate with the smoker housed in the corner where the next day's carnivorous meats were being prepared.

As I sat and drank, the first round of BBQ rib tips (smoked then deep fried and double glazed with Memphis and Carolina sauces) were presented. Needless to say they were a textural dynamite and packed with sweet, sour, tangy flavor. Anything smothered in a terrific mustard sauce is a winner in my books.
 
After the ribs, a glass of Kensington watermelon wheat beer, with the shot of Bookers to follow to complete the Deep South BBQ experience right?

It was at this point we went inside to sit down to enjoy a fantastic version of a Cobb salad. Not your average Cobb salad, but with smoked turkey, blue cheese, eggs, bacon, avocado, tomato, arugula, all lightly dressed. Combined, it was a great balance of flavor and textures, a salad I would even order not being a salad kind of guy.

For the main event (believe it or not) a variety platter of their other smoked offerings.  A stack of 1.5 hr smoked, fried and glazed wings, a mound of 15hr smoked brisket smothered in bbq sauce and topped with pickled onions, a heap of succulent pulled pork, double smoked beans, a three cheese Mac and cheese,  and coleslaw.

 he brisket was tender, fatty and just simply melt in your mouth good. The coleslaw was not over dressed and retained a great crunch. The beans were my favorite side, double smoked and made with a chili base which stole my heart. I enjoyed the beans with the pulled pork, they complemented each perfectly. 
 
The mac and cheese was cheesy and creamy but remained light, not heavy.
 
The one made one mistake that night, I ate the wings last. I regret that. They were amazingly crisp and moist for being smoked in a BBQ, with slight smoke and sweetness that took them over the edge. Altogether, completely awesome and worth the visit alone.

Last out was a smoked peach cobbler with a crème Anglais for dessert. A sweet, creamy, smokey, and perfect finish for what I believed to be, the ultimate BBQ meal."}
{"text":"Good vibe and nice customer service, love the wines and the corn grits. Staff was welcoming and friendly."}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday evening for dinner. Hoping to sit out on the back patio but it smelled like garbage so moved back in. Had the Memphis Rib Tips ($12), beef brisket ($14) and fries ($5). Staff was very friendly and talkative, but the food was disappointing. The rib tips were alright but had too much sauce which was overpowering. The beef brisket was good, but not great; tender and juicy but lacked flavour. I should have been healthier and ordered a vegetable side, but they were way overpriced at $8, so settled for the equally overpriced fries.  I was really hoping that this would have been a 4 star experience so that I could tell all my Westside friends the East is coming up!, but the Smokehouse let me down. I would have paid $24 (as opposed to the $31 I did pay) for this experience ($16 for the brisket and fries, and $8 for the starter). I will not return. Barque Smokehouse or Electric Mud for now."}
{"text":"We had this a barbecue joint in our bookmarks for sometime and we're in the neighborhood and thought we would try it and of course today of all days it's a little emptier than normal because it's Super Bowl Sunday outstanding for us we don't have to fight the crowd ! 

However between 11 and 3 they only have their brunch menu, it's a smaller menu and missing many of items we were looking for..... so we ordered a brisket sandwich with fries and a decker sandwich which had pulled pork, brisket and bacon all smoked with fries .... Well our order arrived and they were massive servings........ massive! 

We also ordered a Lager - is was good - delish ! And a Skeletor which I just love.... My friend Lil could really only eat half the brisket sandwich because there is just so much bread and the meat was such a large helping...on the Decker sandwich I actually ate half of the sandwich (it was actually two sandwiches, I did not realize that when I ordered it) that portion far too much .....it was very good though, just an overload of pork ....lots of burping afterwards. I think that sandwich was great for maybe two people to share, too much food for one person. 

Great barbecue think I'll bring my dad here next time and share a bite of his meal! Ha Ha"}
{"text":"Just a few bites from our full review - 
\"Welcomed by an R2-D2 BBQ at the storefront, sticking out boldly, we knew we were in for a treat with a twist.\"
\"We really enjoyed the smoked brisket topped with caramelized onion - it was tender and just fatty enough.\""}
{"text":"The 3 star is for brisket sandwich which was good and tasty. Pork rack was dry and has an odd chemical smell. Not a very exciting place. Oh! And that patio at the back is really tight and not pleasant."}
{"text":"Delicious brisket, awesome ribs, tasty pulled pork and the best whiskey sour I've ever had.
Smells like an awesome campfire inside and out!"}
{"text":"We were here for Sunday brunch and were seated right away. The price is great plus we had a coupon through yelp for $15 for $30. The food was served fast and was so good. We had the danforth decker."}
{"text":"Came in on wing Wednesday and got a medium platter!!  Food was great friendly service!!  Wish there was cornbread or bread to accompany the Bee bee Q."}
{"text":"Went here this past Saturday on a friend's suggestion and recommendation; she is new to the Danforth and a recent Houston transplant so this was a natural choice.

I started with a Bourbon, Devil's Cut and was able to chat bourbon for a bit with who I assume was the owner.  

(Bourbon was great--it is nice having a few to choose from although this being Ontario, they don't have anything you can't get yourself.  Ontario, it is time to let us have what we want!!!!  We need some free market action happening here.)

My friend and I went with the platter for two and upgraded to poutine.  Let's break this bad boy down one item at a time to give it is proper due:

Ribs--I've had better but they were certainly tasty.  Very smoky.  Which made them nicely unique.  You get 4 of them.

Wings--again, you get 4.  These were my favourite.  They just had perfect crispiness you get when done right.  Not too saucy either.

Pulled Pork--the mustard was interesting and generally worked for me.  Probably would not order this on its own but was nice to get a few bites of it.

Brisket--probably my least favourite.  It was fine--but far from the best brisket I've had.

Slaw--fresh, crispy and free of onions.  Call me a happy camper!

Poutine--smoked cheese curds a tasty mushroom gravy.  Very good but a bit too much with everything else going on.  I would have really liked to just have this (not as a meal) with a beer.  Next time I'd order just beans or something less intense.  

I drank a seasonal brew from Lug's which was incredibly delicious.  

I thought the service was excellent.  Atmosphere is good.  Price is fair.

Getting back to the meal, I will admit that nothing blew me away if I was comparing to some of the city's other BBQ fare.  But I'm going 4 stars here because I love the fact that I now have a BBQ joint that I can walk to.  Plus, it is right off the subway.

Totally recommended.  BBQ is very subjective so if you are a fan, you owe is a go."}
{"text":"If youve ever been to a BBQ joint in the south....this doesn't even come close. It's probably one of the better options in Toronto but don't expect this to be anything like a Texas BBQ joint.

I honestly was not excited about anything I ordered and can't say that I would come back anytime soon.  I ordered the brisket, rib tips and macaroni. The brisket was super dry and tough or whatever the opposite of tender is. I'm guessing I got a super lean part but I actually couldn't finish it (maybe they should save those parts for the sandwiches) It was my first time having rib tips and I wouldn't get them again, they are made from side ribs and there is a lot of cartilage, not really my thing. The Mac and cheese was pretty good though.

All in all I wouldn't say this place sucks but I wouldn't give it a 5 star review either and it's one of those places for me that I goto once and don't think I'll ever have a craving to come back to."}
{"text":"Had dinner here on March 4, 2014 so I think it was still on the 'soft opening' phase.

The place is clean - relatively small - but clean and the decor suits the BBQ environment.  

Ordered the Ribs and all of the sides.  The Ribs were absolutely amazing - fall off the bone tender meat.  Maybe a tad on the dry side but otherwise some of the best ribs I have ever had!  

The cost was reasonable.  They have an interesting selection of draft beers which I appreciate.  The wait staff were all friendly and very nice, if a bit slow.  

Will definitely go back there again and would suggest it to my friends.  I will only give it 4 stars for now for the limited menu and slow service, which I think is related to the soft opening."}
{"text":"Very slow service that we had to get up from our seats to call the waiter .The waiter had messed up our order and when we finally got it the food was ice cold . When asked to heat up the food we could see it sitting there until we made it obvious that our food was ready . Not sure if we would go back again"}
{"text":"Staff is super friendly and beer selection on draft is excellent. We got the $75 mixed platter usually for 4 people add a couple beers tip and your at $150. This would be ok if the food was worth it, unfortunately not. Ribs are probably the best part but the side mac/cheese and beans were bland. Wings and pulled pork were just ok and brisket was very dry. A lot better places out there and wouldn't go out of my way to come back, sorry!"}
{"text":"Poutine had a sweetness that I did not enjoy. Mushroom burger was ok. Good service though."}
{"text":"I came across this place randomly, yelp had a deal and I jump on the opportunity because usually bbq is fairly expensive.

We ordered the dish that came with ribs and pulled pork French fries and beans. The food was tasty, they had a decent selection of beer on tap which came as a pleasant surprise.  

The location is great, the actual restaurant was small but roomy enough to not be elbow to elbow with other guests.

I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"Friendly service. 5$ beer on Tuesdays!!!
So so so tasty.
Highly recommend the medium platter. More than enough for 2 people.
You can buy the kitchen a round for only 6$. We did and you should too :)"}
{"text":"So happy to have a smokehouse on the east end.  The vibe was chill and the service top notch.

The ribs were my favourite...scratch that the key lime pie was my favourite and then the ribs lol

Support the craft brewers!"}
{"text":"Hilarious, I go to this place all the time now. I acknowledge that it was way harsh of me to judge them on their opening weekend. I forget how stressful it can be to open a restaurant. 

Anyway, went back a few months later and now I go on the regular. Great service, delicious menu staples as well as specials. The smoked fish chowder is insanely good and they always have a good mix of beers available. Love it!"}
{"text":"This is a casual, easy spot for some authentic(& fantastic) tasting bbq - 
The menu centers around meats - I tried the brisket sandwich which was amazing (and not at all a messy sandwich, something I am quite a fanatic about!), as well as some teriyaki fries, which were also good! My sidekick had a burger - which was decent, but if you come here, you should really be trying their smoked meats (either ribs or pulled pork ect).
Most sandwiches are btwn $13 - $16 so there's a lot of value there. 
The patio is jammed with tables, so I don't recommend an entourage or strollers - staff is friendly and are great with recommendations."}
{"text":"Terrible service.  And not because the server wasn't busy.  She was.  But I can't stand it when a place is understaffed.  We'd been sitting at the table at least 15 minutes and were ready to order.  She came by to take our order and we started to give it and she said \"No, not your food order.  I'm only taking your drinks order.\"  I've never once had this happen before.  So we ordered our drinks and they came in pretty good time.  But another ten minutes passed and she still didn't come by to take our food order.  We'd been sitting about 25 minutes at this point.  We decided to give up and just pay for the drinks.  When I went up to pay for the drinks her attitude was a bit of \"Sure, whatever.\"  Understaffed or not the service was still pretty crappy.  Was the food good?  I'll never know."}
{"text":"The mushroom burger is really, really yummy! Mushroom-smokey-goodness. It's not carby like a lot of veg burgers filled with grains & beans (without the bun, mind you). 

We had cider (Brickworks) which was so yummy to wash down our smokey goodness. My partner ordered the brisket and mac and cheese. He was a fan of the flavour of both; Not the \"best he's ever had\" though, in his words.

Great service, however, and cozy spot.

Excellent if you have the craving!"}
{"text":"I've been here a half dozen times in the last couple months, and it's always been a great night. Excellent BBQ, great drinks selection and 10/10 service. Great decor, and the whole place smells amazing. Only possible complaint is that it sometimes gets a bit draft near the front and back. Otherwise, love it!"}
{"text":"After wandering around the Taste of the Danforth looking for some good food (and being disappointed with long line ups) we came across this place that had a few tables open.  We were hungry so we decided to beat the heat and sit indoors and enjoy a meal.  It's a small place with a  few tables in front/side and some bar seating.  There is a patio in the back but it was full that day.

As the name would suggest, this place is about getting your meat on.  We chose the small platter which had pulled pork, beef brisket and ribs for $45 (there are larger size versions of the platter).  The small comes with a choice of one side - we picked the fries.  We also ordered a the mac and cheese with chicken.

As I don't eat pork, my friends advised me the pull pork was good.  I tried the beef brisket and it was nice - tender.  I wish it had a bit ore flavor but when you are hungry you just don't care at that point.  The mac/cheese was ok - it was cheesy with pieces of sliced kraft like cheese slices tossed in as well.  The chicken provided a nice bite to the meal. 

The fries, well I didn't like so much - neither did my friends.  They were meh at best.  I'd be curious to try a few other items on the menu but I don't think I would rush back. 

Overall a decent place to get a meal or grab a drink and sit on the patio enjoying the sun :)"}
{"text":"Never disappointed.  It's not formal but the staff is great! I love it.  Meat eaters rejoice....brisket / wings/ rib tips/ribs/ all kind of smoked delights.  Oh and other rich stuff for your cheat day :)"}
{"text":"Amazing food and beer. I can bearly walk by without my nose dragging me in. Every time we eat there its fresh and big portions. The deal on right now is wicked too."}
{"text":"Food was delicious! I can't believe the half rack was only a half rack. It was huge and tasty... I will be back."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this new fun-seeming joint, but the burger was very ordinary. The fries were... sweetened? Sugar-coated? Weird. And the salad was vinegary and dull.

Staff was super-friendly though and the place has a nice vibe."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with this place.  It's just another hipster wannabe BBQ joint. 

The brisket sandwich wasn't too bad except it came with way too much sauce The burger came rare to the point of being blue in the middle and near burnt on the outside.  The mac n' cheese was flavorless. The only good thing we had were the fries that tasted oddly like potato chips. 

Service was awkward. I don't care if you've worked nights all week and now have to work a lunch shift. Pay attention, be attentive and get our order right. 

Boy do I miss Phill's on College."}
{"text":"Great new BBQ place. Enjoyed the ribs and fries, clearly fresh cut. Well curated booze choices. I like that the menu isn't huge, so they focus on doing a few things really well. Mac & cheese side rocked, and salad was big and fresh. Like the vibe inside too. Definitely returning to try the burger and wings, wings were sold out by the time I got there."}
{"text":"super friendly and helpful waitress. I had the bbq breakfast and my boyfriend got the brisket grilled cheese. and big pints of rootbeer. the breakfast was great and the grilled cheese was amazing, and huge! will def be back. cool spot. thanks!"}
{"text":"Amazing chicken wings, the wings are crispy on the outside and very tender inside.  They have half price wings on Wednesday, will definitely come back for that. 

On the other side, the ribs are average. They have good beers too."}
{"text":"Three things; grit in the bottom of the paper cups displayed on the table used as dispensers for wet naps and extra napkins; sticky doorknobs  on the bathroom doors no doubt from folks going after handling saucy and sticky things; French frys being portioned out with bare hands by the cook.
I guess after you've been open for a couple of years you lose track of the details. Hmmmmm? 
Wings are served with tips attached which cuts down on food costs for the restaurant but gives you more stuff to leave on the plate that you paid for after eating. The fabulous Mac and cheese was Sahara dry.
Oh yeah, one more thing. I forgot to mention the flies.
You've been warned!"}
{"text":"Been meaning to check this place out since it opened but never managed to get the chance, so when I noticed they started offering delivery service I jumped at the opportunity to give it a try.

We ordered the platter for two, which came with ribs, wings, brisket and pulled pork. Sides were cole slaw (included), mac & cheese (our selection) and hush puppies (a delicious, delicious surprise).

I don't remember the wings clearly, but the other meats were delicious and tender. Sauce not too sweet (I dislike super sweet sauce) and portions were generous. Mac & cheese and cole slaw were decent. As noted above, the hush puppies (which came with a chipotle aioli) were delish. 

Next up, a trip to the restaurant so I can try some of their bourbon cocktails to wash down the delicious food! And what's this about pie!?"}
{"text":"Pretty good BBQ place right off Pape And Danforth. Cozy inside, good service, although a bit rushed.  We had the hush puppies, mac and cheese with pulled pork, baked beans side, and the burger with fries.  It is not the best BBQ I've ever had, but quite decent for Toronto.  

The hush puppies were too heavy, and the mayo they came with was very heavy.  The baked beans tasted as if from a can.  The mac and cheese with pulled pork was the highlight of the evening, classically presented with the flavors contrasting in a good way with the umame of the bbq pork."}
{"text":"The restaurant specializes in their house-smoked meats including pulled pork, smoked chicken, brisket, pork ribs, and much more. The interior of the restaurant had a rustic charm with fun decor throughout the place.

I came here for Toronto's BBQ week to try their Smoked Pastrami Short Ribs. The portion was quite small, at around 4 oz. of meat, but was beautifully presented on a bed of cauliflower puree. The short ribs had a lot of different flavours from the in-house rub and wood-log smoke - very delicious! I especially liked the creamy cauliflower puree, along with the mustard jus and chive oil. All the components in the dish worked very well together to produce a fantastic, flavourful meal! Too bad the portion wasn't bigger haha.

My bf decided to order the Tennessee Hot Chicken that was offered in their regular menu. I was able to try some of his chicken which had delicious tangy and spicy flavours. The collard greens had a slight bitterness which was perfect in balancing out the dish.

It was a nice experience trying out Greenwood Smokehouse for Toronto's BBQ week because now I've found a great BBQ restaurant that offers a variety of house-smoked meats. We will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Amazing  AMAZING food, back patio is a nice, secluded beautiful seating area. Definitely a hidden gem, lived in the area forever and I can't believe I've never been here before!!
Service was exceptional and dessert was great!! Can't recommend this place enough!"}
{"text":"There really is nothing more frustrating than a restaurant that doesn't deliver their best effort on a continuous basis. Such was the case during a recent trip to the Greenwood Smokehouse BBQ, as the food I received felt like it had been slapped together by a chef who wanted nothing more than to go home.

I decided to go with the Beef Brisket sandwich, with a side order of the Smoked Beans.

There were so many problems with the sandwich that I'm not even sure where to start. First of all, the bread was terrible. It was way too dense and tasted a little stale, which meant that most bites tasted mostly of bread (and bad bread, at that). The brisket was devoid of smoke and honestly didn't taste terribly fresh, and it was so sparingly applied that I was genuinely shocked. (To give you an idea of how little meat was in this thing, when the sandwich arrived to the table, it essentially looked like just a bun sitting on a plate.)

The beans didn't fare much better. It was a big portion (at least), but it was so far removed from traditional BBQ beans that I never quite got used to them. For one thing, this concoction has chick peas in it. Chick peas! In baked beans! The biggest problem, though, is the undercooked nature of the various beans. Everything's got way too much bite. The flavors aren't really anything special, either, with cumin the most predominant taste here.

(In fairness, I should note that my dining companion thought the beans were pretty good, although he too acknowledged they didn't taste like any other baked beans he's ever had.)

I'm just completely baffled by my experience at Greenwood Smokehouse. Why even bother opening for the night if this is the caliber of food you're going to send out?"}
{"text":"2nd time at Greenwood Smokehouse and love a lot about it.  Vibe is great.  It was the worst as its previous incarnation as a sliders place.  the meat eaters in my house are huge fans of the brisket.  Pulled pork too.  The spice on the fries was too sugary for our taste but you can ask for your fries without.  Also a side of bbq sauce goes a long way to making everything delicious.  Vegetarian entrees - mushroom burger (mushy, falls apart, taste is meh) and vegan chile (bland) - don't perform but vegetarian starters are yummy - smokey mushroom soup and wedge salad.  small patio out back is a welcome addition especially with addition of outdoor smoker.  everything smells fantastic.  owner checks on tables and staff is genuine and attentive."}
{"text":"Went with my wife for my birthday. Waited a bit for a table but were taken care of and had a beer while waiting. I had the half back or ribs and she had the pulled pork sandwich. I would recommend both although I especially liked the dry rub on my ribs. Staff was very nice and the overall experience was very casual and comfortable. Apparently they have a licensed patio that will be open soon. We'll be back to check that out. Definitely recommend it overall."}
{"text":"\"Great BBQ in a small unassuming place\"

The Greenwood Smokehouse features smoked ribs, brisket, pork, chicken and wings. It has a couple of window 4 top tables, one larger table at the back and a patio that will make you feel like you're part of the smoker. Depending on the wind, you may be all smoked up by the end of your meal. We chose to sit inside.

The small sampler has enough for a might dinner for two and the brisket is one of the best in the City. Barque in Roncesvalles has nothing on Greenwood. The smoked meats have a tangy sauce with a bit of a bite and the smoed wings are also excellent. they have the standard side dishes of baked beans, collared greens and coleslaw, but where's the sweet Ontario corn?

They serve only a few craft beers so if you're looking for a wider beer selection, you may not like it here. But its all about the smoked meats, anyway."}
{"text":"I do really like the vibe here.  Their ribs are very good.  The wings we have had are hit and miss.  I really wish they would change up their menu a bit - add features and improve their salads!  There salads are not good in our view.  Also, cornbread would be great,"}
{"text":"Such a cozy atmosphere with a dash of kitschy eclectic Star Wars paraphernalia. Better yet the ribs were saucy and tender with just the right amount of kick. The special of the day was Montreal smoked meat - it tasted extremely fresh - lovely thick slices. We went as a family and my kids had a side of Mac n cheese - delish and made with fat 'pig tail' shaped noodles that gave the dish some heft. On our second visit chef had reverted to a traditional small macaroni noodle which I feel deteriorated the taste of the dish. Please go back to pig tails! The service was fantastic too - friendly and time conscious we mentioned we were heading to the cinema."}
{"text":"We have eaten here several times and am always very happy with the results. Last night, we were a party of three. We started with the hush puppies-deep fried balls of dough. Perfectly friend and fluffy-dipping sauce needs to be refined, too strong of a mayo taste. My husband had the pulled pork sandwich and fries (always delicious pulled pork-amazing fries), my dad had the Danforth Decker-super delicious but very rich with the challah bread, cheddar cheese and all different kinds of meat. I had the Mushroom burger-which was a massive disappointment. I'd read not so great reviews of said burger but had to try it for myself. It was tasteless with an overwhelming amount of smoke. I was also intrigued by the smoke pineapple guacamole but was also disappointed. Judging from the rest of the food we've eaten there, they could do so much better. We will obviously be back-but please, guys, work on that veggie burger. Vegetarians should not miss out on the great stuff that comes out of your kitchen :)"}
{"text":"This particular review update is for the delivery service of Greenwood Smokehouse and my last few visits here.  Since our initial visit where I raved about the quality of their barbecue, I think it has since been on the decline.  I brought my friends here last summer raving about it, but I felt that the ribs were just alright, a bit tough and their brisket was dry.

I've since ordered several times through Uber Eats and I found that it is so overpriced for the quantity of food that I get.  I spend nearly $100 to feed 2 people.  I got the platter one time, and feel like there's nothing special about the sausage on that platter.  They should stop skimping on the coleslaw, because really, the portions are already small as it is.  The pulled pork that came with the small platter was condiment sized.  The large fries ordered were soggy and the box was only half filled.

I've stopped raving about this place.  It does fix my BBQ cravings, but value-wise, I just can't back it.  I was really hoping for some good quality BBQ in Toronto, particularly in my own 'hood."}
{"text":"Ok, so let it be know that I'm reviewing this as a transplanted Southerner just looking for my fix. So, I'm comparing this to the best Southern BBQ I've had...Dreamland Tuscaloosa Alabama, Tired Texan (RIP) Birmingham Alabama and Saw's BBQ Bham AL.

That said, I'm not expecting miracles here. But I am expecting something close.

Pulled Pork Sandwich with Fries - Fries were fine, but who cares? Sandwich thoughts...Egg bun is fine for burgers, but wrong here. Added extra taste that got in the way. Slaw is fine. That's a NC thing and I do it myself. Whole grain mustard was wrong and totally mucked up the flavor. Sauce, typical. Nothing special. Pork, burnt. Smokey no doubt, but with that sharp burnt edge that's not ok. Probably cooked too fast. Burnt crust mixed with perfectly fine interior meat ruined it.

For a meal in Toronto, 3 Stars.
Replicating true Southern BBQ, 2 Stars."}
{"text":"When we saw the sign for a smokehouse we were really excited about trying it out.

We went for my husband's birthday tonight and ordered the Mac and cheese, poutine, beef brisket sandwich and ribs.  Overall the food was okay.  I would say that I have had better elsewhere.

Mac and cheese was better than a lot of places due to using a stronger cheese.  My 1 year old son ate it all, so points there!

Poutine had a neat twist to it due to the Smokey gravy.  My husband felt different.  He may be a bit of a purist.

The ribs were fall off the bone and I liked the seasoning but I couldn't help thinking that ribfest had better ones, or Barque.

The brisket would have been better if it wasn't so greasy like other people said.  I think crispy onions would have been a nice touch.  I prefer Leslieville Pumps' brisket sandwich more.

The service was excellent though.  Our server was quick and very accommodating to our son, bringing him colouring sheets and crayons, along with plastic cup for him to drink out of.  She also was able to rush our order for the Mac and cheese, which came just before a hunger meltdown.

Overall, nice place, great staff, good beers on hand.  Would come back for a snack or appetizer and a drink."}
{"text":"So good...and so many meat sweats. A great addition to the neighbourhood, for wonderful smoked meat. The medium shared platter was WAY more than enough for two - not that we didn't do significant damage to it. Brisket was melty, pulled pork had lots of yummy crusty bits,  wings were very big, and ribs weren't fatty at all. The collards are tasty and the beans, yes the beans, are spicy and awesome.  Can't wait to try the mac and cheese - everybody else seemed to be having that. I'm looking forward to leftovers for lunch today.
Not clear on why we had to pay at the bar at the wireless POS terminal...unless the wifi didn't stretch to the patio. But I'm just glad they take credit.
Will be back. Highly recommended.  And hey...low carb?"}
{"text":"I've ordered from Greenwood twice using Uber Eats and the food is always great! I haven't actually been to the restaurant itself and cannot comment on the atmosphere.  If we are focusing on food though, it meets all my succulent BBQ expectations. The platters are a good deal and a great way to get variety. Pulled pork, brisket and the mac and cheese are awesome!"}
{"text":"I went to Greenwood Smokehouse BBQ with my one of my girlfriends last night. We sat on the patio, which was cosy and very nice. Our server was very friendly and the service was great. 

Now on to the food. I got the mac and cheese topped with fried chicken ($21), and my friend got the brisket sandwich with coleslaw ($14). The mac & cheese was delicious - very creamy, cheesy, and the pasta was nicely cooked. Unfortunately, the meal came topped with a very sweet BBQ sauce which I was NOT a fan of (this was listed on the menu, so it's my bad for not asking for the sauce to be served on the side). It was cloyingly sweet (ketchup based) and did not work well with the the mac & cheese. The fried chicken on top was fine. It was a bone-in piece of room temperature chicken topped with cheese and pickled jalapeños. I think a freshly fried piece of chicken would have tasted a lot better. I did enjoy the crispy skin with the mac & cheese, but the chicken itself was on the dry side. I loved the mac & cheese, so next time I would get it as a side with another main.

My friends brisket was fine. She found it to be on the fatty side, but it looked tender and it was a very generous portion. I didn't try it so I can't comment on the taste. Her side of coleslaw was VERY good! It was a huge portion, and it was creamy, tangy, delicious! I liked that the grainy mustard they had in the coleslaw, it was a nice touch. 

I will go back to try other things on the menu. The poutine at another table looked delicious, and their BBQ platters looked very tempting too."}
{"text":"SO GOOD! The huge portion sizes are amazing and every single server is super nice. This is a great place to go to get your fill of protein. The decor and general ambiance is really casual, but warm and friendly."}
{"text":"I've eaten here at least 5 times since moving to the area. Depending on your meat preference, you will likely enjoy different menu options. Overall, I prefer the taste and texture of the pulled pork; I find the brisket a bit too fatty and lacking in flavour. 

Our favourite item is the Danforth Decker (Pork, rib, brisket, house bacon and cheddar for $17). It sounds expensive, but you get 2 sandwiches cut into halves and each is filled with delicious meat! The flavour is incredible, and just thinking about it makes me want to order it ASAP. Last time we ordered it with slaw, but it's a bit to creamy vs. tangy so went changed it up with fries recently - excellent idea!

We've also tried the Frick'n Chicken Mac n Cheese (3 cheese cream and asiago sauce, topped with fried chicken, house bacon, cheddar, pickled jalapeños and BBQ sauce for $21). Not great value for the size, and I found the mac and cheese a bit too dry. 

Minor complaint: We tried calling in our order, but their phone goes straight to voicemail, and the mailbox is full. Not as big of a deal last time, since our order only took 10 minutes. The previous visit resulted in a wait of almost 45 minutes for take out (unacceptable!). Also, setting up Uber Eats for this was a huge failure. Save yourself the hassle and walk in to place your order for take out....And go with the Danforth Decker - you couldn't possibly regret it!

Good option at Pape/Danforth...too bad it isn't open during the day."}
{"text":"Walked in on a whim...we were gonna go to Libretto, but it was super full, so we took a walk along Danforth to find something non-Greek.

Got a seat in the back and we were served quickly.
We shared a full rack that was quite meaty! Loved the sauce, good bark on the ribs too. Comes as a combo with slaw and fries.
Also got the baked beans, which were soooo good. Had a smokey/chili flavor to them. Yum!"}
{"text":"Carnivores looking to feed their hunger should go here. Good choice of Microbrews on tap and lots on the menu to choose from. We ordered the Medium platter which is good for 4 people. The Wings, Brisket and Pulled Pork on the Platter were all great. The ribs were a little dry. All Proteins come with a nice smokey flavour. Side Beans were a touch sweet and the Hush puppies (Deep fried Corn bread balls) needed some sauce to combat the dryness. Still a tasty meal. Will go back when in the mood for smoke. They have a decent selection of bourbon. Too bad they don't offer up boozy bourbon based cocktails (but only if they made them well)."}
{"text":"The Greenwood Smokehouse has been a favourite of ours since it opened. We used to live right at Pape and Danforth, and have always thoroughly enjoyed their food and hospitality.

The atmosphere is great, unfortunately not spacious but very comfortable and homey, which adds to the intimacy of dining. I noticed that the back patio has new furniture, just the right size, and can seat up to 18 people. It's clean, shaded, and smells phenomenal as its right beside the smoker. 

The menu is recently upgraded too. They easily cater to kids with the kids menu, and the vegan or vegetarian as they have plenty to choose from there as well. 

They never have a lack of specials either. The only way you'll get to know them better, is to check them out. They're super close to the Pape Subway station."}
{"text":"One of the best places I been in a long time. The staff are super nice and the food was great,definitely going back. If you like real hot sauce this is also the place for you. This is my first review ever on this site and I am writing this review only because this restaurant is well deserving of it 5 stars."}
{"text":"I have TRIED so hard to like this place. Have had ribs from them 3 times. All three times have been a disappointment. I always feel kind of robbed, very expensive for ribs that are not great. Mind you, I have ONLY ever had the ribs. I don't know how good/bad anything else is on the  menu. The ribs are kind of bland, particularly the second and third time they were very under-sauced. This place is in my neighbourhood, so I truly wanted to like them, gave them three chances. But the frozen ribs from PC that I get at Loblaws are AMAZING compared to these ones."}
{"text":"Hubby loves BBQ, he would eat it every week but I'm not a fan so thankfully our arteries don't get clogged as we only go when I feel like it, which is not very often.

We had tried Greenwood Smokehouse when they first opened and I know I did a review, but it's not here on Yelp, perhaps because the name changed?

At the time they were still going through some growing pains like any new restaurant, but hubs liked the food but then it fell off the radar.

He loves the brisket, and this time tried the Danforth Decker, which is basically a grilled cheese with a bunch of smoked meats crammed inside.  

I had the brisket sandwich and it was good and juicy, unlike a lot of brisket which can be painfully dry.

We were impressed when they sent away two very drunk patrons who only wanted to come in and order more booze."}
{"text":"Love that this location is not only a stone throw away from where I live, but the good is good along with the price and quick service. If you're up for some samples meat, they have a try it all platter which for $39 you can taste abit of everything. 
Their burger Patty is delicious, but the burger send to be a little dry and coarse. Try the Decker sandwich instead.
For additional $3, you can always add a side.. It's decent in portion. Live the r2d2 smoker at the front door on display too."}
{"text":"So I have been trying to find the perfect BBQ place. I found it today. I had the Montreal Smoked Meat sandwich. Every single bite made me happy. Thick and flavorful meat that just broke apart when you bit in. The mayo was delicious and the rye bread was soft but stayed together until the last bite. My cousin-in-law had the Danforth Decker. He said it was the best sandwich he ever had.

Plus, our waiter was AWESOME. He was very knowledgeable and friendly. The chef came out and to see how we were enjoying the food as he tended to the outdoor smoker.

I WILL BE BACK! So happy it is in my neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Finally decided to try greenwood smoke house. Had heard good things and was in the mood for some southern bbq.
We get in, wait about 10 minutes at the bar, for a table, order drinks, decent beer selection, ok wait times, friendly bartender, so far so good.
After looking over the menu my party of four decide on our meals, mac&cheese, pork putine, brisket, danforth decker sandwich with hush puppies,
I tried all but the sandwich and hush puppies were my order.
The menu described it as:
\"THE \"DANFORTH DECKER\" - pork / rib / brisket / house cured bacon / cheddar / challah $12\"
Sounds good, but long story short... A lie.
They seated us next to the kitchen so we were able to watch as the cook prepared the meals.
It is there that one of my party pointed out, \"hey look, wonderbread....\"
Turns out that white wonderbread is the Challah bread they use, and the cheddar.... Kraft singles.
I opened up one of the sandwiches and clearly there was bacon and what looked like brisket, however no pulled pork, so the sandwich at least appeard to consist of,  wonderbread, Kraft single,  bacon, and brisket.
Not to say it was not delicious, however after clearly watching them use wonderbread for my sandwich and pull a pack of Kraft singles out of the mini-fridge, I have come to the conclusion that this was not the sandwich that was described in the menu.
Ok, more bad, then the good.
The hush puppies were honestly bland and unoriginal, no spice, no flavor, was enough to share with the party at least, but they all had similar feelings towards them, basically overcooked pancake batter balls.

Now the good.
The mac&cheese was delicious, got a half order and it was quite large, I will say it was somewhat bland, but it was home made, and very cheesy. So well worth the $8 it costed. Great job on that, but if I can say anything constructive, needs a little more kick.

We also ordered a pound of pulled pork and a pound of brisket, both were delicious. 
One had a bbq sauce and the other a mustard glaze.
Both were delicious, and worth the cost, however probably not entirely an entree on there own. 
The putine was good but not great, a little heavy on the gravy flavor. Lots of cheese. Was decent, though not great.

My biggest complaint is that they use wonderbread and claim it to be challah.... It really isn't that hard to make bread or buns on your own. sure, we are there for the bbq and not the bread, but it's really just an insult to cooks everywhere to pair your meal with wonderbread.

P.S.  Wonderbread is not Challah."}
{"text":"Went to this place for a birthday get together. As some places do, they add an 18% gratuity for groups of 6 or more. First off, that is such a presumptuous practice. I might be okay with it if we had received amazing service but we didn't. My empty plate was never removed. 

The bathroom was in bad shape with a leak, broken equipment and no paper towels. There was also a staff member in the basement coming through with greasy trays. A bit scary looking.

My friend enjoyed her pulled pork and others said their food was \"good\" or \"alright\". The mushroom soup was quite tasty and the portion was really small. The place says vegetarians welcome but then the waitress told our vegetarian friends that the soup might have bacon in it. Okay then....

They had a drink that a few liked but when a few people tried to order it, they had run out. 

On a positive note, they gave our birthday friends a free shot of Honey Jack and they topped up a drink for one of our friends after it was pointed out that she got a smaller glass then a friend with the same order. 

The menu is limited which would be fine if what they did make was spectacular - but it wasn't. So all in all, I won't be inclined to come back. 

Hopefully they will fix the broken things in the bathroom, clean up the place a bit and cut down on the greasy look of the kitchen."}
{"text":"BBQ joints have it really tough. Each person has his or her own idea of what constitutes good BBQ, and it's difficult for restaurants to serve a variety of items and do everything well. That said, I had brunch at Greenwood last week with a group of guys and we thought the food was great. The brisket and pulled pork were awesome, as were the wings.  The ribs were good, though with a bit more chew than I usually prefer (and I stress that this was just my preference and was not shared by everybody at our table). We got a large platter for four hungry guys. If I could do it again, I would have ordered an extra side of coleslaw to convince ourselves that we weren't just gorging on meat and starch.  I would go back again."}
{"text":"brisket sauce has too much liquid smoke so tastes artifical.  they only have one wine and its bad. kitchen is miniscule feel sorry for cooks."}
{"text":"Delicious. We tried the first platter on the list which it is convenient for two people. The ribs and pulled pork were our favorites. 

Try the Danforth decker if you are really hungry. Big sandwich."}
{"text":"Had the smoked meat sandwich with fries...not the best where meat portion is concerned...I am comparing to Schwartz in Montreal - the ultimate smoked meat mecca! May come back for seconds...let's see..."}
