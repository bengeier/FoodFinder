{"text":"I am a HUGE sushi fanatic and have eaten at many more \"experimental\" types of sushi restaurants.  Yet for what Kinjo is, a perfect place for groups hosting the connoisseur and the sushi newbie, this is the perfect in-between place.
The quality versus price is spot on.  The service is probably the best I've ever experienced. I gave it a 5 star because it really is a great sushi place choice for groups with diverse sushi experiences."}
{"text":"We love to come again and again here!! Wide varieties of sushi menu!! Friendly staff!! Great ambience!!"}
{"text":"Good quality sushi in the South in a clean and spacious new location. The food is almost as good as the other South sushi hotspot with Kinjo taking the cake on atmosphere and selection."}
{"text":"Love love love!!! Staff is always so pleasant and their food is fresh and the best!! 
Such a great job to their skip the dishes drivers too! They're all so nice!"}
{"text":"Not as busy as the Chinook location but this means no waiting and no crowds. I really liked the space of this location. The decor is modern with a bit of Asian flare. The staff as in all Kinjo's I've been to was super friendly and helpful.

The food, in true Kinjo style lived up to the original location by Chinook. The only thing I really did miss was the boats. I know it seems lame but as I'm waiting for my order I like to pick up a few rolls off the boats as they go by... I didn't get a chance to do that. On the plus I didn't leave with left overs as I normally do. So I suppose no boats is better for my dining budget.

Had a nice big pot of tea with my dinner. Also they have this little coin cat that takes your money... it's such a good marketing tool because I totally gave it my coin and this little cat pops out of the box and takes the coin... I must put one in my house for when people visit. 

The parking lot is now super packed in the area as the sobeys is across the way as well as coach and horses. Starbucks in walking distance from Kinjo's is also a huge plus."}
{"text":"I used to love the MacLeod Trail location but it was sort of a pain lining up out the door and then sitting elbow to elbow with strangers at the sushi bar. This location is much larger but has the same fantastic sushi and entertaining staff. This is also a great place to take kids! Our 8 year old is hooked on cucumber rolls and sesame chicken. She is working her way up to trying \"real\" sushi. BEST miso soup I've ever had. They cater to vegetarians as well."}
{"text":"The plates were very dirty looking... but the server was trying to convince us they are perfectly clean... time for some new plates... 

The rice is not authentic Japanese rice, it's a low grade sticky rice, so you'll notice it's grainy and hard to chew. 

A note on the wasabi... it's not real wasabi. You can only get real wasabi at more expensive places. Less expensive places uses this mixture of very little wasabi mixed with floor. If you're allergic to gluten... watch out for fake wasabi. 

This is the second Kinjo location I have been to, save to say I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I love Kinjo! I started going to the one down by Chinook since 2005 and when I heard it was opening up in Millrise (right next door to my house), I was ecstatic!  The food is great, reasonably priced and friendly staff. Now that I moved away, I miss this place (probably good that I did otherwise id eat here EVERYDAY). now whenever I drive down south, I always have to stop in :)"}
{"text":"What happened to this place? This use to be my favorite sushi place but the service has gone way downhill.
We came shortly after lunch and it was not busy. We were ignored for half an hour and when a girl came by to refill our water, I politely asked if she knew who our server was. Rather then replying, she walked away and an irritated young man came over to take our order.
After ordering, our food started to arrive after 10 min, however we were informed that my sister's order couldn't be made since they ran out of ingredients. ): It was not our lucky day. 
Waiter continued to be rude and inpatient the entire time he dealt with us. 
I guess I need to find a new sushi place in Calgary ): And if anyone knows where all the awesome staff that use to work in this location went, please let me know!"}
{"text":"This place was so smart to open in Millrise. There is a serious lack of restaurants in the Southwest suburbs so my family and I were so pumped for the opening.
I love that you can pick up an order from Kinjo's, which I did on my way home from school a lot, and it is really cheap but still good food. I love the spirit the employees have (though the service is fast-paced, which can be strange sometimes), and I also love how much seating they have.
Only thing that annoys me about Kinjo's is when a) the use gross broccoli for tempura (which is seemingly all the time) and b) when they make me kiss one of my parents or brothers on the cheek or something. in exchange for pocky Super awkward but I get they're trying to be like fun and eccentric.
Overall great place, super efficient without losing a nice welcoming feel."}
{"text":"I am yet to have a bad meal here!! My husband and I eat here a couple times a month and have loved every 
Meal. The staff are exceptional and the food is fantastic."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is very comfortable Benihana roll is very good. We eat here often and kinda odd that your food just comes in no particular order. The majic  steak is addicting. Great place for quick tasty meal"}
{"text":"I always enjoyed going to the location on Macleod Trail. The only issue was the massive line during busy times and the small parking area. The massive amount of space and seating at the new Millrise location is fantastic. The food is great, the small portions allow you to order a bigger variety and the price is a bit better than average. The little free sampler plate of free rolls given every time you visit Kinjo is a very nice gesture. The staff here are always super friendly and goofy. I never leave Kinjo feeling dissapointed, how could you with a free box of Pocky!"}
{"text":"Sushi is just ok, not up to standard, lots of rolls are pre made so they r not fresh 
  All these singing and greeting are getting obnoxious if they happen more then once when u r there ( sometimes u hear them 3-4 times in one serving )
  Miso is not hot enough at time"}
{"text":"Boy - what a let down as I got a reco about this place from a someone who is of Japanese descent from Japan and works in Calgary. Waiting for a business associate in their lobby area, I thought at first that this place would be a great dining experience as some of the posted reviews were in Japanese from a Japanese magazine publication. Unfortunately, this place can best be described as comparable to the type of standard sushi one would find in a grab and go area of the deli section of a major supermarket that offers take out sushi. 

Rolls of 4 pieces are small and being from the states did not quite understand why Kinjo does not offer more pieces (standard rolls - I'm talking about) while adding some more fish to each piece. Both my dining partner and I felt that the only roll that was worthy of a hand clap was their dragon roll.

Our server was great as was the manager who was overseeing the rate of how we wanted our dishes to come out. I thought that the greeter (MC) who came to everyone's table and introduced himself was a little over the top but hey - if one ever watches those crazy Japanese game shows that are on TV - it makes sense.

Two stars overall with one of the stars for service and one for the food. Sorry Kinjo but \"that's how I roll\""}
{"text":"One of our favorite places for sushi.  Love the yams.  Have brought many visiters that come to Calgary.

Ask to see the Pokky room. The kids are amazed.

Great friendly team that works there.  Food is always fantastic.  Never a bad experience."}
{"text":"Have never been to eat at the restaurant but have had take-out many times. While I'm not the most adventurous sushi-eater, there are always plenty of choices for me to choose from. Love their green beans!"}
{"text":"Kinjo, is a great family oriented Japanese restaurent. The business prides itself in offering child friendly options through their menu. All of the servers I've had in my visits were friendly and offers a great deal of patience with kids. They are attentive to their guest and do go the extra mile to make kids feel welcome and wanted in all if they restaurents. If you have not read or heard about the owner story you definetly should. It is heart warming to hear successe stories like his. Continue the good work and you will lots of happen little customer returning when they are all grown up!"}
{"text":"The 3rd Kinjo is now located in Millrise.  I like coming here because of Kinjo's consistency.  You always know what you're going to get when you come here.  The staff are always welcoming, the service is prompt, the food comes out fast, there are a lot of choices on the menu and I appreciate that they give out free sushi/tempura.  On top of that, the food always tastes good.  

Peter Kinjo (the owner) has everything in place for a successful business model.    

If I could change one thing though, is that they should also give out free Pocky to the guys too.. C'mon there's mountains of Pocky in that giant room!"}
{"text":"Kinjo is awesome. It might not be the best sushi on the planet but it's always a great time. The staff are aways friendly and helpful, the menu is always consistent and tasty. I definitely recommend it for bigger groups as well, since the location is huge. 

This is definitely our go to sushi joint."}
{"text":"You won't see Peter Kinjo around anymore, he's a rare sighting like Sasquatch. He has left managing in the trusty hands of Andre.
This is number 5 out of 5 Kinjo's built thus far. 
I like Kinjo's because they make you feel valued when you come here. The food is pretty consistent, so If you're familiar with Kinjo's then I need not describe the food.
This is a big bright space, and as long as you don't come during peak times the service is pretty good. I come here quite often, so I've been on the other end of the service spectrum when it has been extremely busy. 
Give this place a try familiar or not with the Kinjo chain of restaurants.
My only tip when eating here is that beware of ALL the small dishes that cost 4-7 dollars. They can add up quite quickly.
Also download the Stamp Me app on IOS or Android, and you can earn stamps toward a $20 gift certificate."}
{"text":"They have a new customer rewards program. Just download the Stamp Me app. 
The Millrise location is a test location to see how the rewards program works.
1 stamp for every 20 dollars spent.
Get POCKY'S  or $20 off your next meal after 10 stamps.
Also they have a new location opening up next February in Mahogany in S.E. Calgary."}
{"text":"Sushi here is great and tastes delicious. Servers are friendly and polite. Food is fast and I have never had problems."}
{"text":"Really good food and quality ingredients and meats. However you really pay for it. Small portions at a high cost. I'd give them 5 stars but seriously it's expensive and they don't have deals."}
{"text":"Kinjo is one of my go to sushi place . But i kinda stopped going to this branch because of the guy thay gives away the pocky.he makes things awkward.numerous times that i was there with my sister,he would always ask us to hug before he gives out the pocky.well we dont normally do that in our family.after refusing to hug ,he then sat down and lectured us. It kinda ruined our meal experience cause as a customer i want to eat in peace. The food though is great as always.i love the hot beef roll,its got cream cheese inside and it just melts in ur mouth.i like how they give out free sushi.overall,its a very good place to eat sushi.but please weird guy who gives out the pocky,stop putting customers on the spot"}
{"text":"I have three awesome sushi restaurants within walking distance to my place in North Vancouver, so needless to say this place doesn't compare. The sushi was average, I guess. The service - not so great. The day we went wasn't very busy at all, with lots of wait staff just standing around. Our dishes came one at a time, pretty normal, but my partners cold noodle soup took especially long for some reason. You'd think that would've been til he first dish served straight away actually. Oh well!  Neither of us were all that crazy about this place. Next!"}
{"text":"went to Kinjo for dinner tonight with my family.  Ordered the crunchy roll and may others.  The crunchy roll arrived with a black hair sticking out of the end of the roll.  We told the server who took the roll away and delivered another a little while later.  Total bill for four was over $100.  I asked Luke our server (who was very nice) if it is Kinjo's practice to not say anything or do anything about the hair on our food.  He said they prepare a new roll and that is it.  He apologized for the hair.  It was in no way his issue.  I watched the server that took our roll back approach another staff manager, assuming a manager.  No manager ever came to our table to apologize or offer to comp the roll with the hair in it.  I blame the management for this.  The server was great and the management needs to own this and speak to us and make it right.

Don't expect anything from the management here....I don't believe they care in any way....just keep pushing the people through and grab your money."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the feel of this restaurant. I liked the interior design and how it gave me the feeling of warmth. The staff was also friendly and welcoming which always makes or breaks the experience.

Now on to the food, we had multiple rolls and gyoza. All was delicious, fresh and came out at a good pace - not too fast or too slow
. 
The green tea was a standard staple and they have great pricing of beer. 
The only thing that bothered me about our experience here was every 10 minutes or so there was a gathering of employees that started to sing VERY loudly \"happy birthday\". It made the meal feel cheap and it was just so obnoxious. It might not have bothered me if it was just once but on that particular visit it happened about 5-6 times within the hour that we were there. 

I will like to go back, I just hope it's not a birthday night."}
{"text":"Convenience is the key with Kinjo for me! (hey that rhymes!) It's easy to order on skip the dishes for pick up. I've went there to order take out, and that felt like it took quite a while, feels a bit faster if you dine in probably as the food can come out gradually. 

Love that you get pocky with your meal, nice favor with eating at Kinjo. Not the \"best\" sushi in town but the most 'regular' place I have been frequenting lately, and I like the consistent quality of food."}
{"text":"Really good quality of food. Many nice choices besides of sushi for any taste. Great attitude from the staff, some entertainment and extra freebies as a complement. Amazing experience as a family for reasonable price!"}
{"text":"I love the food at kinjo it has great sushi that gets served fast!! I also like how instead of telling your order you just check off what you want.
The servers at this location are inexperienced though, not the most polite & don't always understand what your saying. Also the setup of the restaurant isn't the best."}
{"text":"The service I get here is amazing. Every time I walk in I'm greatest with everyone smiling and seated right away. The food is so fresh and arrives to the table within minutes. I swear they must have a contest to see who makes the fastest rolls! Everything here is amazing. Love the volcano roll and the mango rolls!"}
{"text":"Excellent fresh sushi we were beyond impressed we didn't expect much being a food chain we were pleasantly surprised. Excellent service"}
{"text":"My go to place when it comes to great Japanese food at really affordable prices!
Friendly staff greet you and get you to your table immediately 
The food/drinks are served promptly 
A must try for all Sushi lovers.

{"text":"I absolutely love Kinjo, I am a dedicated regular. I love the atmosphere and how kind all of the staff is. Service is usually pretty quick and I love the way that the food comes out. Food is amazing! GO NOW!!!"}
{"text":"First of all, I don't understand why it is so overrated. Their sushi is very mediocre if not bad. Decided to come here after seeing all the good review but very disappointed. I had salmon sashimi and it was not very fresh, feel a bit mushy; maybe that's why I had to visit the bathroom not long after(hence the 1 star). Ordered some rolls but nothing special, nothing stand out. Will I be back? No, definitely not. I have had way better sushi elsewhere."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, staff are super friendly..  Freebie rolls given when you arrive are not described and looked like they have been sitting around for a while. 

The sashimi was nice, fresh and tasty.  Sushi was good from the fish perspective but the rice just fell apart when trying to dip in your wasabi soy mix.  Now it's a rice soy wasabi bath.  Really that's my biggest complaint, food tasted good, just wasn't as good as the reviews led me to believe.

Try the steak bites, medium rare."}
{"text":"The service is ALWAYS excellent and efficient. The staff are always very good. Pricing is extremely reasonable. As others have said it is definitely our go to for sushi."}
{"text":"So happy there is a Kinjo now so close to my house!! Amazingly fresh!! And really great service!"}
{"text":"The Kinjo empire gets a standing ovation.

They say you shouldn't order hungry, otherwise you end up ordering food you need and food you'll regret. Here they make sure you survive for the next few minutes of crucial decision making by giving you a few complimentary bites of sushi or hot food. Spicy salmon and ginger beef? Yes please.

The sushi is tasty, I always come to Kinjo for the rolls. How picky can one ever really get over sushi? How many food shows and documentaries until eventually you're just a sushi snob swatting away at your friend's hands because they dunked it in soy sauce? Sometimes you just gotta lay back, stick a few doorstops to keep your jaw open and let those rolls march in.

Pricing. Fair. This is a great place to treat anyone to. As opposed to say a night out at a fancy resto with a tasting menu that claims to have truffle oil only to have a beauty mark sized drop of it on the side of your plate. Am I beefin? I always am.

They usually make you work for a box of pocky. I'm glad our host just made a few jokes with us and each gave us a box. Because, there's a certain point of trust between two people that somebody's Motown renditions become endearing and in my case it's at the later stages when they have no choice but to stick it out ol Ange."}
{"text":"9 of us went for dinner last night at this new Kinjo location and what a great evening we had! It's just beautiful inside and the family all had fun ordering and seeing all the staff sing and interact with everyone throughout the restaurant. Excellent customer attention and food was tasty and we loved all the Pocky treats! Thanks for a fun experience!"}
{"text":"My favourite sushi place in calgary!  This new location rocks!  Don't miss out on great sushi at a great price"}
{"text":"The Kinjo chain has been my fav spot to go for sushi. I go out for sushi at least a couple times a month. I was so happy when this location opened up because its closer than the one by chinook. Anyways the first time I went is right when they opened and of course had amazing service and the food was great. I came back again last weekend and I was so disappointed in the service. They didn't offer the free taste tester sushi roll that they normally do and they never offered the little kids fruit Mickey Mouse thing they do which is one of the reasons I go with my kids. (They love it) We were left in the corner. The food was ok though except the magic steak bites were super chewy (maybe they used a lesser grade of meat) hope not because those steak bites are amazing! And that peanut sauce is to die for. I'm not sure if I would return to this location."}
{"text":"From BC so have expectations in the Sushi world... and this place was good! 
Had a variety of great choices including sashimi, lobster and they were great!  Maybe not so big a deal on the Alberta rolls (wrong place for beef) but a great place, good service and fast chefs"}
{"text":"Always great service and food. We've celebrated birthdays at Kinjo for the past 3 years. We will continue to do so. Great job guys."}
{"text":"First time here since they opened. Our server Jisun was very friendly and food service was quick. We came on a rainy Saturday evening and there were lots of empty tables. The restaurant it self is quite large and modern.

The menu has a wide selection of sushi, rolls and cooked food to please any person. My favourite was the spicy salmon hand cone which was fresh and had a good ratio of salmon to rice. The tiger roll was good, I really like the crunchy topping. The only dish we didn't like was the beef tataki there wasn't enough ponzu sauce it taste bland. Overall it was a nice experience; casual dining with decent sushi."}
{"text":"I love this sushi place. All the Kinjos I've been to have been great but this one stands out. 
The atmosphere is very warm and authentic Japanese. The staff are all super friendly too. 
I didn't have any complaints on the three visits so I give them five stars."}
{"text":"This is the newest of all the Kinjo's in the city having Just opened this year (2017). 
My favourite location is still the Millrise location, however, I expect as the area continues to grow around this location it will get busier. Parking is good but I think when there is more businesses it will go down a little bit but not much. 
Kinjo definitely has the best building in the lot being in the centre. 
I miss the pocky room from the Milrise location and I also notice that they have taken many things off the menu form the transfer. They offer things at the Milrise location that they don't at the Mahogany location such as Dynamite cones with the soy paper wrapper. 
I still love the atmosphere and how they make everyone feel so welcome :)"}
{"text":"This is my favourite Kinjo location of them all and there are 4 of them. This is not the first one I went to as the first one I went to was the MacLeod Trail location, however, that one became too popular and too small. This location as it is bigger is able to hold more events and accommodate groups. They do a very unique and interesting event with Blue Fin Tuna which taste delicious. 
Favorite thing is the dynamite cone made with soy cone wrappers and VOLCANO ROLL!
I also love the Pocky room! 
Having complimentary pocky's at the end of every visit is very nice!"}
{"text":"I can't really complain about kinjo, their food and service are always consistently good. It may not be the best sushi out there but it's quick and easy, there's not too many options in the south to choose from so I'm only comparing this to other stores in the mahogany plaza."}
{"text":"I looooove Kinjo ! The mango roll is to die for ( well almost lol ) . The service is fast ( almost too fast sometimes ) and accurate . My party also enjoyed the teriyaki chicken and the sauce that  comes with it , it's soo yummy  ! I really enjoy this location and the atmosphere . My date thinks the green tea pocky's are the bomb ! Love it !"}
{"text":"Good fresh stuff! Thanks for hooking my girl up w the pocky Crystal!! ;)"}
{"text":"These guys do Sushi right! Always fantastic service super fun and the food is always consistent. Great Job I'm so happy you guys opened up so close to my house! This is definitely a regular."}
{"text":"The food was good and the service was fairly quick once the order was taken to the kitchen. 
Our server took very long to check on us meaning we waited for refills, additional orders, and to get the bill.
The menu had a lot of variety and the food was overall good."}
{"text":"First time to the newest Kinjo in Calgary. 

Overall very lively atmosphere as you are greeted loudly by staff as all Kinjos. 

Staff are very friendly and super fast. 

Dining area is large with many booths and small steps to different levels of sitting.

Decor is very clean and there are televisions throughout. 

Menu is same which is very large and pricing is decent. 

Of course the manager is around asking how food is and carry pokey candy for kids and females (adult males out of luck )

Overall a new fav sushi for SE Calgary and very family friendly too."}
{"text":"Been here few times with one person and few times in group of 8. 

Service is great either way expect slower in larger group. 

Sushi order never ideal in large group. 

Pricing is best in town but portions are average. 

One of few places that charge for refill on pop. 

Still a decent choice to come but price seems to be going up and portions stay the same. 

Love the mango sushi roll and the beef teriyaki. 

3 stars for inconsistent service."}
{"text":"Kinjo is a pretty popular sushi chain in Calgary, the latest building opened up close by me to I figured I should give it a try. I ordered through skip the dishes so we took everything to go which definitely affected the quality of things like tempura - who orders tempura to go?! haha we do apparently. The rolls were good though and hubs ordered the chicken stirfry, didn't see an option to add rice as a side or to the dish which was unfortunate as it would have been a good add on. They also give out pocky for dessert which is a nice touch. They were very busy when we picked up dinner, the restaurant was packed and lots of uber drivers were picking up takeout."}
{"text":"I've eaten at the KINJO near Chinook Mall a lot and have this one a try. Same great food expectations were met and much more parking here. It has a brilliantly designed seating area that's pleasing to the eye, with possibly the exception to the beer posters haphazardly thrown on the wall. They are an eye sore and I feel they should be framed, or removed from the walls and presented only at the entrance or at the table somehow. This restaurant is a food place not a pub so the walls should feature the food or other art."}
{"text":"I eat here all the time. Food is amazing. Service is even better. They give out free pokey sticks to the women and kids. They even give the kids a free fruit appetizer. They give out a sushi sampler at the beginning. This allows you discover new things you might not have ordered. Love this place."}
{"text":"Wonderful place to bring the kids. Affordable and delicious. My daughters been a vegetarian for just over a year now (and picky eater) and she's easily satisfied along with the boys ages 4-13. 

The manager is an amazing guy and really makes his customers old and new feel welcome.

The great touches of samples, orange monkey for the kids, kids chopsticks etc make a world of difference for the overall experience. 

They are always fast too. Do note they are often Quite busy and it can get loud but lots of things to enjoy to make up for that. 

Highly recommend this location."}
{"text":"I've always loved kinjo and I was so pleased when they opened this location. The staff here are so welcoming, and it makes it such an easy choice when I'm wanting some simple sushi. Comfort food, for sure!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had Kinjo Sushi & Grill again last night. We went to the one located on 7 Mahogany Heights SE Unit 200, Calgary, which is 10 minutes drive from our place. It's a brand new location on South East side of Calgary. It was our 2nd time been to this location. We didn't have a great experience on our first time try. But, we had a great experience this time.

Environment:

We got the restaurant when it just opened. There were no too many people there yet. Inside the restaurant was nice and clean. We got the table very fast. As we sat down, our server brought the menu to the table and began to serve the drink.

Service:

Our table server is an Asian guy. He was very nice and friendly. He took the order very fast and also brought a teapot for us for the extra water.

Food:

We have ordered three special rolls, such as Golden Dragon Roll (8pcs), Jay-Mak Roll (8pcs), and spicy crunch rolls (8pcs). Besides that, we also ordered Ikayaki and special tataki 6pcs. Our food came out kitchen very fast. They were all fresh and well-cooked. We did a great job to order those special rolls. The spicy crunch roll is 8 pcs, which made by tobiko, cucumber, squid legs, spicy crisp, and volcano sauce. The Jay-Mak Roll is one of my favourite rolls. It made by spicy salmon, lettuce, avocado, crispy wonton, and unagi sauce. Unagi Sauce is super tasty. I love it.  Golden Dragon Roll has shrimp tempura, unagi, cucumber, cream cheese, spicy crisp, unagi sauce, and hot sauce. Although all the special rolls have hot and spicy sauce on, the taste of the rolls are not spicy at all. They were all tasty. We loved the food so much.

Prices:

The prices of the rolls and dishes at Kinjo are a little bit of expensive. I believe it was totally worth the prices.

In summary, we enjoyed our 2nd-time experiences at Kinjo. We should definitely come back to this location again."}
{"text":"This is our go-to sushi place. The atmosphere abuzz and the service is near-impeccable. You can always expect an amuse bouche upon getting seated and a little sweet Pocky present at the end of your meal. I recommend this particular Kinjo to anyone. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Same great sushi, same great atmosphere, same great service. I love Kinjo and so will you!  Fantastic decor!"}
{"text":"This is my regular sushi place, and this location in particular. 

Certainly not the best sushi in Calgary, but it is consistent and quite inexpensive. Our bill is always around $40 for two people. Choices typically include potato cakes, vegetable tempura, smoked salmon sushi, cajun prawn sushi, volcano roll, and some sort of large roll. Some days the quality is not as good, but overall never a bad experience.

This location has a server that tends to forget about you near the end, but generally the service is fine."}
{"text":"Always went to the location on Macleod but now I drive down here. Andre has always been a great host and the sushi and atmosphere is a nice step up!"}
{"text":"First time we have been at this restaurant and we had a great experience starting with the delicious and finely detailed food presentation. We also had the pleasure to have a great conversation with the General Manager that even gives some nice treats and made us feel welcome!! Food was served in a timely manner. We definitely will recommend this restaurant to our friends."}
{"text":"This place was awesome:) prices were incredible, but the service left something to be desired. It was fast, but we felt ignored. I ordered a roll that had a level \"3 peppers\", and it was barely spicy(and I'm a big baby when it comes to spice!), so if you order something spicy, either ask or specify to make it hotter. All in all though I had a great experience with my friends! Would definitely return! They give you free Pocky at the end, which is what led us to tip more than we were originally thinking haha I bet they do that on purpose:)"}
{"text":"Manna from the heavens! Millrise was in need of a pick-me-up in terms of its dining - enter Peter Kinjo. The man who opened the original Kinjo on Macleod Tr in 2005 and expanded to Dalhousie in 2011 has struck again, opening his third location in the city, and it is a most welcome new restaurant. The original location is notorious for its limited 65-person seating, hyperspeed turnover, and raucous atmosphere - Millrise follows closer to the Dalhousie model in its sprawling interior, but retains the fast food service and upbeat atmosphere. The interior design is warm and inviting, with three distinct themes throughout (my wife lamented that the kitchen area itself resembled a cafeteria). 

Their general organization in the entire restaurant would not have you believe this place was only opened to the public five days beforehand - smooth and efficient. And of course you have popular \"Pocky boy\" Andre spreading cheers through the dining room, singing four birthday songs in the 45 minutes we were there.

Of course, interior design and atmosphere will only get you so far in the restaurant business, so the element that Kinjo has maintained to the highest standards in all three locations is the most important: the food. My wife and I ordered the kissing dragons roll, some assorted pieces, gyoza and the sauteed long beans. It was the Sunday dinner rush (likely close to 70 people in the whole restaurant), and we received all of our food within 10 minutes of ordering it. The sushi was as fresh and delicious as it always is in a Kinjo location - I don't want to claim its the best in the city, but...

The best part of this place is its proximity to home, literally a stone's throw away. On second thought, that may be the worst part. Very excited to come back here again and again."}
{"text":"I have never been to a restaurant where as soon as i get there i am already planning a second trip back. As soon as we walked in (husband and 2 year old son ) we were greeted with such a warm welcome. We were seated right away and the food came super quickly even though they were quite busy at the time. The reason for the 5 stars has got to be their amazing service with our toddler, which even in family restaurants we do not get service like this. They brought him a mickey mouse made from oranges which made him so happy . At the end of the meal a young man came over and started interacting with our son and brought boxes of Pokeys over for him to choose from as a desert. The food was outstanding and the service was on point. I can say with out hesitation that this will be the only sushi place we go to from now on."}
{"text":"The service was fast and tge food was well priced and tasty. However i found the atmosphere to be really lacking and bland which was really dissapointing"}
{"text":"These guys get it! From the very first opening the service has been so good. Always with the warm shout of \"Welcome\" in Japanese. This is a chain of restaurants from all over and the sushi is consistent with each location. It's always busy and even at busy times they always make it a point to make each guest feel welcomed. We had the Dynamite Rolls and the Kissing Dragons which was fantastic. These guys definitely deserve a 5 star for being Awesome all of the time."}
{"text":"The newest Kinjo opened on April 1st. No April foolin' here.

This location is big. There's probably a good 50 tables with some of them being pretty sizable booths. They had a ton of staff working and the customers were cycling through at a pretty quick pace. Despite only being open for a week the staff seem to have everything running pretty smoothly. 

As with most sushi places these days they sit you down with a photo menu and a spreadsheet with all of the items listed. Just write in the quantity of each thing you want and the menu is whisked away to the kitchen.

They started us off with a sample plate which consisted of 4 different rolls. The rest of our food came quite quickly with the sushi and tempura items coming first followed by the cooked items like the yakitori and noodles. My wife doesn't eat fish so the process was a little off pace for a normal dinner as she watched me eat all the sushi while nibbling on tempura and edamame then I watched her eat (ok I ate some too) all of the cooked stuff.

Overall the sushi is solid, not the best ever, but good for Calgary standards. The service dipped off a little after we were done eating. It took quite a while to get our bill, then another long wait for our server to come by with the machine. Our whole bill came to just shy of $50 which is on par for the two of us at any restaurant, sushi or not."}
{"text":"I love Kinjo Sushi! and have been a loyal customer since their first location on Macleod Trail. Tonight in Mahogany we ordered our typical, Dynamite roll, Volcano roll, tuna Sashimi, veggie roll, ginger chicken, and teriyaki beef. The food is always amazing! Tonight's service however, was subpar. Not once did the waitress come by and refill our drinks, and we waited suspiciously long for our food to come out (About 25 min). I don't usually mind waiting for food at any restaurant however this is not typical for Kinjo at any location. Regardless we will be back as we are die-hard Kinjo lovers. 

If you have not had Ginger chicken, you NEED to try it!"}
{"text":"Honestly my go to sushi restaurant for quick and high quality. They recently added presses sushi I think it's called hanabi ozi something? I can't remember but I just point to it every time I'm there. No other sushi restaurant will have better customer service than kinjo."}
{"text":"I always have good experience with this place either pick up or eat in. Delicious food and fast service are keeping people come here again and again."}
{"text":"Love the new Kinjo in Millrise.   I will always love the chaos and character of their MacLeod Trail location though, and the sushi boat is just part of the fun experience. 

The new Kinjo in Millrise is like the classier younger sibling.  Fancy booths, beautiful decor, and pretty sushi plates.   The food is what you've come to love and expect from Kinjo, fresh fish due to their high turnover, and friendly staff.

We went for lunch and really enjoyed the upscale vibe as something different than our usual kooky kinjo on MacLeod."}
