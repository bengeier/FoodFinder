{"text":"Well if your like me , then when something is advertised as delivery and it is not... Well you are disappointed. Also they have a dining area but that is not accessible 

On the food.... Yes it is good fried food. The chicken is tender, the frozen fries are crisp. But, there are to many other places that offer the same exact ingredients. Yes the lemon pepper season is welcomed but you can literally get the same at hooks in Mt Oliver ... At a cheaper rate"}
{"text":"I only received a delivery order once.  The wings and shrimp were excellent. I have tried to order for delivery numerous times and was told they are not delivering. If you don't deliver please do not advertise as so."}
{"text":"Cheaper than Hooks, taste the same though which is great, only issue is they don't really answer calls as often as you would think. Hard getting through unless you order online or go inside to order. Prices are reasonable though. The workers are great people too"}
{"text":"The best chicken tenders and chicken wings in pittsburgh . Specially with the seasoning they have . Nice customer services too"}
{"text":"I finally tried this place out. I walked in and ordered on the spot. It took about 10 minutes to get my food. There are a few stools to sit there and eat but most of their business is carry out. For $12.00 I got 3 chicken tenders, 2 pieces of catfish, fries, 2 pieces of bread, and cole slaw. The chicken tenders were average size, but very good. The 2 pieces of catfish were huge. Both of them about 9 inches long and breaded to perfection(which they did while I was there). The fries were tasty and so was the cole slaw. I discarded the bread. I guess it was there to make a sandwich if you so choose to. If it was a bun, I may have. For lunch, I only ate the fries, 1 chicken tender, and 1 piece of catfish.. I was full. I took the rest to go and shared it later with my girlfriend. I will be going back."}
{"text":"If you are like me, a Southern girl living up North, there are some things you miss. Catfish and fried okra were two of those things. Today I found a place that filled my craving for those two foods-Walid's. They are having their Grand Opening this weekend and we decided to try it. Of course we wanted to try a little of everything so we ordered catfish nuggets, fried okra, fried shrimp, and chicken tenders. If you look at the photo I posted I made a plate that was a sampler. Of course it look very artery clogging but indulging in fried foods occasionally is ok. 
First let's talk about the okra. It is heavily battered but still has the great flavor of okra. If you like fried okra you will like this. 
The catfish nuggets were lightly battered. The true taste of catfish comes through. Catfish has a different taste than other fish. Eating it as nuggets is a great way to try it. 
The shrimp tasted like gulf shrimp. Gulf shrimp had a tad bit taste difference than other shrimps. The coating was nice-not too heavy and very crunchy. 
The chicken tenders were probably some of the best I have ever had. The chicken was very moist yet the batter stayed on. 
Each item had a different type of batter but the other thing that makes this food stand out is the seasonings they use in their batter. It's a mixture of swat/salty/spicey (mild). It's a little addicting. I could have eaten a lot more if I had let myself. This food was a big hit with my family. 
Please note that this is a take out place, not a fine in. They have delivery during the day-cash only and a $2 delivery fee. At the restaurant they accept credit cards. 
Good stuff!  Get some!!!"}
{"text":"We finally got to try this place out, ordering chicken tenders, fries and hush puppies to go.  It was clean inside, and the two guys working there were very friendly.  They were also excited to have a new customer stop in.  The chicken was fried to perfection, being crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.  The fries and hush puppies were also just as crispy and delicious.  The seasonings they use are simple, yet very tasty.  We can't wait to go back to try some of their seafood, next."}
{"text":"On our way to Westend Overlook and stopped in for a quick bite.  This is take out only so that was perfect.  The chicken wings are lightly breaded with some seasoning and were crisp on the outside and moist on the inside...very good.  The Shrimp was a little over breaded but still very good and tasty.  The fries are kind of what you get at this type of place..soft and OK.  The Okra was over breaded and just not very good."}
{"text":"After 7 visits, I'm conflicted about this place. The food can range between average and good but the rest is sometimes just weird. They claim to have delivery but there is always an excuse why they can't \"today\". Several times they were closed during normal business hours. Once they wouldn't take an order unless I came in first. These \"cons\" get tiresome after time and are the reason I often decide it's not worth the trouble.
As for the food, I found the chicken tenders to be good. The perch was below average or way over cooked, while the others graded much better. The Cod and Talapia were my favorites. The sides were generally good. I didn't try the wings or desert."}
