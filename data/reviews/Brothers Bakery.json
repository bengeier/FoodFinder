{"text":"I never really noticed this place until I went to Pacific Mall with my friend and he mentioned that this place has the best BBQ pork pastry. 
The store itself is outside of Pacific Mall in the strip of stores along Kennedy road. It's unassuming, simple, bare bones decor Chinese bakery. The kind I'm used to going to growing up.  The prices are standard as all the buns hover around the $1 price point.  The BBQ pork pastry itself was $1.30 each. The pastry itself was thick and had a flakey top and was a bit doughy towards the centre.  My friend liked it but I prefer thinner & flakier pastry.  The pork was delicious - moist and full of flavour with few fatty pieces. 
I will have to come back to try the other buns."}
{"text":"Very very delicious buns and cakes here! My family and I have been visiting this bakery over 10 years now and we keep coming back for more! 

They take custom orders for cakes with little to no extra charge! My family's favourite is the mango cake with chestnut filling. They usually only do either mango or chestnut, but they will do mangle and chestnut if requested for only a few bucks more! The sponge itself is not too sweet and very soft (not too firm). 

Also, I recommend buying their gift certificates if you plan on going often. The more you buy, the greater the discount (up to 50% off!). However, these certificates cannot be combined with their 40% off after 5 sale. 

I highly recommend visiting this bakery if you have never before!"}
{"text":"This is the first time I am writing a review in yelp, and the first time also visited this place.  I bought 6 buns and a Swiss roll.  I notice they had a sealer and they already put all the buns in bags, so I asked the lady to seal them for me.  She said they don't seal for 6 buns, if you want you can wait till the line is over.  The line was not that long (only 2 or 3 people behind me) and it was their own fault for having a line (2 ladies can't help one guy to buy a few cakes???).  I tried the buns, and they are good, but I don't think I would go back for that kind of service.

What I want to know is, is 6 buns too many to seal, or too little?!  I am so confused at her comment.  I use to work in a bakery, and I was all alone at times and have a lineup of 10 or more people.  I seal every single bun if they asked and will not refuse the customer.  I would not tell the customer to lineup again.

And yes, I worked at a Chinese bakery, and just because it is a Chinese place doesn't mean it can have crappy service like that.  No thanks, I will not return I rather go to Windsor bakery in Market Village."}
{"text":"I know this bakery has been around forever and they've always been a bit pricier than the competition.  However, I think it's worth it as they taste like old school authentic Chinese buns with lots of filling, the stuff I grew up with and not the \"little bit of filing\" in bread buns these days.  We bought 3 BBQ pork buns and a mixed loaf of 6 mini buns for $6.60.  

The BBQ pork buns were delicious and had so much meat in them, that I struggled to pick them up.  As for the mixed loaf, it was pretty good too.  They were nice and buttery.  

Overall, this is a great bakery, but unfortunately loses one star for the price as a lot of the buns are $1.30 to $1.50 and you get those for about $0.80 to $1.00 anywhere else.  Still, if you rarely go to this area (and I rarely go nowadays), it's a nice little treat."}
{"text":"This place has 50% off all bakery items after 5 pm! It's an amazing deal, from 50-80 cents each!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best char sui bao in the GTA. They use fresh fatty BBQ pork and are generous with the filling. I like picking up a dozen or so of the buns when travelling to my parents in Montreal because they love them as well. The wifey cakes are also very good."}
{"text":"One of my regular bakery spots in Markham. I love the quality and variety. They also serve HK style milk tea, coffee and \"yin yang\" (HK style milk tea mixed with coffee). I recommend the milk tea as you can tell it is fresh and also very smooth. It definitely reminds me of Hong Kong. This bakery also has a few tables where you can buy their goodies and a drink for a quick sit-down snack time. 
My yummy bun recommendations would be their pineapple pastry bun with apricot jam inside- they don't sell this at a lot of Chinese bakeries so it's a must try!! I also really like their regular pineapple bun, pineapple bun with coconut filling, mexican bun and their egg tarts!! The egg tarts are so good!
Also do keep in mind that they have a discount after 5pm but I still make a visit as I don't live in the area.

The location is also very convenient as it is located right across from Pacific mall, so do definitely try this place out!"}
{"text":"Coming here for years, the only issue is trying to find parking since this small plaza is located at Pacific Mall/ Market Village.
Brother's Bakery is a family owned and run business that's been here for years and they're known for the selection and quality.  In the back are the parents and in the front are the kids which goes to show hard work and dedication perseveres.  In addition if you're a regular they tend to know you by first name which adds a personal touch. 
There's always a crowd of people here as they know its a popular Chinese bakery go-to place.  If you're lucky after 5 pm all buns and cakes are 40% off which is a steal.
They do have limited seating for guests who wish to eat in and as for their Milk tea, its pretty good, however its strong :) 
In terms of buns I always love their; Beef curry, Mexico, Pineapple, Coconut twist, Raisin, Tuna, Red bean/ black bean just to name a few.

My go to for Chinese buns."}
{"text":"This chinese bakery has been around for a long time. It's outside of pacific mall and beside the bank. I would have to say having to try so much chinese bakeries because it is so common. This is one of my favourite bakeries to go to.

There are reasons they have been able to stay open for so long. The quality of products has stayed the same throughout the years which I find very difficult for chinese business to keep. Usually, when the business gets better the quality will drop.

Not for this place! The whole family works here thats probably the reason why they can continue to keep the quality so well. The old guy (the boss) has a nice attitude and keeps on smiling at all the customers.

I simply love the butter egg tarts from this place. It is soooo goood. The tuna is also another favourite of mine because you don't need to eat 3/4 of the bun before you can actually taste the tuna and its real tuna. The tuna sandwich has not been overwhelmed by the mayo like most places to save on the tuna, I guess cuz cans of tuna nowadays are getting more expensive.

On to the milk tea, quality milk tea no matter hot or cold. They use Carnation milk instead of the other cheap brand. They once changed to cheaper brand but I totally told the boss more than once that the quality taste so much different. After awhile, I guess I was not the only one telling them. They went back to using Carnation milk.

All in all, I would go out of my way to come here when I really crave for an egg tart with good milk tea. I live a further up north but I will still come."}
{"text":"This bakery is okay. They have tasty, fresh fruit tarts for $2 each.
I used to come here a lot for the buns but more often than not, they would be very doughy and undercooked at the bottom under the filling."}
{"text":"In searching for BBQ buns for an upcoming catering event, I came across Brothers Bakery through Yelp. Good ratings and convenient location made it worth a visit.

I purchased several samples for evaluation and they all tasted very good. Prices were decent also and they were a good size - large. Normally, that would be a great thing, and it is! I was, however, looking for smaller buns for a wedding reception. For any other occasion, I'd come back here to buy their buns."}
{"text":"This is my go to Chinese bakery as I've going for years.  Family owned and run.  Always consistent in quality.   Some of my favorites include Crunchy BBQ Pork Bun, Curry Beef Puffs, Apricot Jam Bun and BBQ Pork Pastry. 

Their cakes are very light and delicious.  After 5pm all buns and pastries are 40% off but there's a big rush around then."}
{"text":"Location/Service:

This bakery has been here for as long as I can remember. It is in the same plaza as Pacific Mall, just across from one of the mall entrances. The bakery opens as early as 6:30am so if you want a fresh bun for breakfast, you can get one early! I went there on a Friday morning at 8am, just before I went to work and there were loads of buns waiting to be sold/eaten. There were quite a few people there too, sitting and eating a bun or two with a hot cup of HK milk tea/coffee. There were about 5-7 tables that are good about 2 people in the bakery. It is definitely just a place for you to eat your breakfast/ a quick meal and not for your to stay long to chat with your friends. 
In terms of service, there were 3 people working that morning, and they helped me when I asked them. 

Food:
There is an assortment of buns. There are definitely the traditional ones like pineapple bun, cocktail bun, bbq pork bun, etc. but there are also more \"different\" buns like apricot jam buns, peanut butter buns, etc. Overall, the buns there are A LOT more expensive than at other bakeries. Each one is about $1.80, whereas other places are only $1.20 or less. Pineapple buns with no filling are usually just $1.00 or less, but here it is $1.5-1.8. It is ridiculous but I had to see for myself if the quality is better than other bakeries. 

I bought a whole bunch of breads and tarts:
- BBQ pork Pie ($1.20): huge, but the meat tasted weird.
- Curry Beef pie ($1.20): huge, curry wasn't spicy. It was okay but not worth the price
- coconut tart ($1.20): Huge, good taste, but not buttery enough like other bakeries. 
- Egg tarts ($1.20 for both butter crust and flakey crust): The butter pie crust one was really good but VERY expensive. The flakey crust one didn't sit well the next day as it became really soggy.
- Chestnut tart ($2.5): VERY good, very good buttery crust. For the price, I think it is okay since chestnuts are expensive. I will definitely get this again next time. 
- Cocktail Bun ($1.20) - The outside looked different from the other bakeries so I had a hard time finding it in the first place. Unlike other places, the coconut filling was very sweet and the coconut filling was all like a smush/blended in. I do prefer if I could taste a little bit of the coconut meat texture. 
- Pineapple Bun ($1.20): like any other buns, nothing special. 
- Pineapple bun with custard filling (~$1.8): This was very interesting because the custard filling wasn't like the other ones I have tasted before. The filling was hard (not those that oozes out) and it tasted like those egg yolk custard buns you get from dim sum places. I really like this bun and would definitely get it again in the future. 

I also ordered a chestnut birthday cake in advance. It was about 7'' and it was $30. Definitely pricey for the size. The chestnut was really good though so if someone in your family really likes to eat chestnut, I would definitely recommend getting either chestnut tarts or a chestnut cake from Brothers Bakery. Unfortunately, the HK milk tea was lacking. Too much tea and not enough milk. I'll stick to other places for hot beverages. 

There's a 40% discount if you buy cakes and buns after 5pm everyday!"}
{"text":"Quality Chinese buns, pastries, and cakes in Markham.

I've been going to this family-owned bakery ever since they have opened LONG time ago - still a very busy location across from Pacific Mall. Lots of variety to choose from and they often have their own twists on their products (ie. Peanut Butter Pineapple Bun... it's shaped (sorta) like a peanut and it is very tasty!) Service is always quick and courteous, no long line ups! They also have seating area where you can sit down and enjoy a bun or two, and they serve hot/cold beverages as well. Ooo and tax-fee if you buy 6 or more buns/pastries :)

Some of my all time favourites:

Barbecue Pork bun -  stuffed up LOTS of barbecue pork, good bun/pork ratio lol.
Plain/Sesame-topped buns - so soft and chewy, I can eat this all day.
Peanut Butter Pineapple bun - came out probably 10 years ago, and still loving it, plus I'm a huge peanut butter fan :D

Overall, 5 stars - absolutely amazing - fresh, delicious, and products are always available! #loyalcustomer"}
{"text":"One of the best Chinese bakeries with buns. BBQ buns here are amazing. Not stingy at all with the meat. Just get your buns here if you're at pmall. A bit pricey but if you have brother bakery gift certificates, it makes for a great haul."}
{"text":"A nice bakery store. Came here after 5 pm, got 40% for most of the buns& cakes! But there's a big rush and the buns were sold out quickly. One of my go-to for Chinese bakery. It's in a small plaza next to Pacific Mall, sometimes it's hard to find a parking spot: ( especially on the weekend)"}
{"text":"Huge Buns! Good Quality!

Brothers Bakery has really solid product. Nothing really fancy here or fusion but just traditional Chinese baked goods that I grown up with.

Family owned and operated. A lot of regulars coming in just to buy their products or hanging out at the few tables set up in the front of the store.

Egg Tart and Milk Tea both decent and for $2.15, great as an afternoon snack.

40% off all buns after 5 pm."}
