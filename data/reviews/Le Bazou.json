{"text":"My daughter and I went to try this new restaurant that just recently opened in our area. It has more than 20 items priced at $5.00.  I was delightfully surprised. The food was not bad, in fact my Asian salad was really good!! We each had a salad and shared a poutine.  Total cost $15.00.  
This would be an ideal place to go in the evening with friends to have a beer and a snack or to take the family when you just want a non fussy family meal.
They have the usual hamburgers, poutine, salad, mac and cheese....that kinda   stuff.
They also have full meals at full price.
It did not seem to busy but I think it was because I went on a Tuesday at lunch.
I encourage if you are in the neighborhood to check it outPS The serving staff are really nice!!!"}

{"text":"ONE OF MY FAVORITE RESTAURANTS ON THE SOUTH SHORE!!!

I wish I knew about this place before. They have an awesome menu with a very broad range of price. So no worries there! You can go home satisfied with only 5$. Their fries are heavenly delicious. YUKON GOLD. Decor is spot on, vintage, original, it's just awesome. The owners and the staff work really hard, so they may forget to smile sometimes but they always make sure you get everything you need! 

Please come try this place out, it'll make me happy to know that I made your stomach happy!"}
