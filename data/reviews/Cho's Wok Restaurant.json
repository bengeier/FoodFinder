{"text":"This place used to be very good, but they are sooo cheap now, they slice the meat extremely thin! And they changed the spring rolls, their spring rolls were the best... And also their shrimp rolls are thin and cheap now. 

I use to go to this place for years. NO MORE! I even ordered pork fried rice, and they didn't even put any pork in it!! I was already home before I realized. This place has gone down hill."}
{"text":"Had the special chicken fried rice for takeout and it is quite tasty.  They have Carribean/ Chinese fusion food.  Also tried the jerk pork chow mien which had a lot of pork. It was average tasting, I did not like the noodles they used.  Food portions are decent. They also serve roti, which I would like to try sometime."}
{"text":"Awesome food, good prices and portions.
I recommend the cantonese fried rice and bbq pork"}
