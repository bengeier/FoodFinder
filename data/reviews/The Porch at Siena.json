{"text":"This is one of the worst dining experiences and food in the south hills area. We were seated right away and the waitress took our order. We ordered the antipasto for 14.00 which was the weirdest antipasto I have ever seen. It was some random marinated absolutely gross vegetables thrown on a small wood bread board. No lettuce, olives, dressing. It was truly horrible. The pizza was not much better. If you are expecting Brick oven pizza, go somewhere else. It was cold and had very little on it and the crust was the consistency of a cheap frozen pizza. This little bit of slop was 28.00 and we left hungry. 
We asked for the antipasto first but of coarse it came with the pizza, brought out of the kitchen by someone who probably saw it laying around cold. The waitress didn't even bother to ask if it was good. 
Never again."}
{"text":"Everything they can source locally, they do and it shows in their dishes! 
Excellent food, excellent service. I cannot say enough good about this restaurant. We've been here three times and are never disappointed. 
Best food and service in the area! By far!"}
{"text":"For the South Hills to have a casual, elegant, quick and affordable option is a blessing.  I keep coming back for the beautifully dressed Cesar with great croutons, tomato soup,  calamari app, scallop and risotto entree and the prime rib sandwich w tangy onion jam.  To boot, the cocktails and beer selection is great.  My kids like the kid's meals, and the staff is always friendly, hope you get  Whitney, she is special."}
{"text":"Never thought a restaurant could make duck dry.... They did it. Overpriced, not fresh. Out 4 meals, and appetizers, the best meal was Crispy Taters (potato).  Salad not good, soup jus ok, appetizer (dry meats) were ok....Not impressed. Do not know how they are going to survive at South Hills with multiple great options within walking distance."}
{"text":"The breakfast' s are good but the rest of the menu doesn't live up to the expectations created by the descriptions. It's the result you expect from Eat-N-Park cooks."}
{"text":"I don't know why people are getting their panties in such a twist with the 1-star reviews... this place is very good and totally blows Block 292 out of the water. Second time here and I left thrilled- good food- came out pretty quickly- drinks were great- beer is cold- service is good. The servers are all brand new! Let them find their groove. Definitely check this place out and ignore the Mt. Leb jerks who can't take a chill pill."}
{"text":"Food was amazing.  Pretzel bread, anti pasta, salami platter were the perfect starters.  Plentiful and high quality.   Salmon with risotto and crab stuffed shrimp were beautiful and perfectly prepared. Love the bullet bourbon for the manhattans!  The outdoor seating felt special too.  So cool to see the chef come out to the herb garden to grab some fennel.  Service was friendly and helpful too.   Thanks Pat for chilling my drink."}
{"text":"Sadly we have eaten here 3 times and each time they went downhill..... we had such a great experience we decided to go back the next night for a date night.  The services was terrible....there were way to many people running around, bringing food, removing plates.  We had at least 6 different people visit our table besides our waitress usually I wouldn't complain about this but it was very distracting and caused confusion among the staff. The appetizers took forever and once they did arrive our meals arrived within a minute too. The meals were cold and  not good. My husband had the lamb which he couldn't eat because the chop was 90% fat VERY VERY little meat. My tuna was completely cold and risotto was undercooked.  We then decided to stop in for lunch....hoping that date night was just a rough day for them....lunch was terrible....my burger was so over cooked that it crumbled into tiny pieces as I tried to eat it. They burger came with a fired egg that was undercooked and swimming in egg whites.   My husband had a very overcooked piece of swordfish and found and entire garlic cloves in his eggplant dish.   I had very high hopes after our first meal here...but after two more disappointments we will not be returning."}
{"text":"I didn't think that it was possible, but surprisingly this place is actually worse than the Porch restaurant in Oakland.  

I waited over 40 minutes for a Caesar salad and when it finally arrived found myself befuddled that it didn't have any romaine lettuce!  I think they used kale or some other dark green lettuce.  Yuck!  Caesar salads are supposed to have romaine lettuce!  It even says on the menu they use romaine lettuce for the Caesar salads!  The pizza that we ordered was bland and disgusting.

There was at least a dozen flies buzzing around the seating area in the back.  The table next to us had to move because of the flies.    

There are so many better options for Italian food in the South Hills.  Avoid this place if you care about food quality!"}
{"text":"This place opened in June of 2017 and we've been there a couple of times since. In a way, it's a frustrating place as it has flashes of brilliance accompanied by big misses.

Occupying a brand new development in Upper St. Clair, the actual location overlooks the new Whole Foods and is part of the retail development above the supermarket. There is ample parking in front and when you enter the place, you are immediately greeted at the host station. To your left is the bar with the ubiquitous television screens and beyond that is a covered porch that can serve for outdoor dining during the warmer months. During cooler months, it's covered over and enclosed. To your right is the main dining room with multiple tables and sections. The back walls has a design of many bees and sticks of wood. Not sure what the connection is but it is a bit whimsical.

On both visits, we were seated right away as the place was never totally full. It was pretty busy, but not exceedingly so. On both visits, we had to wait a long time for a waitress to show up with the menus. Not sure why the hostess did not provide menus? The menu does change as it was different between our two visits. We asked how often and no one seemed to know, although one of the waitresses told us she was there since it opened and the menu had changed twice.

On this second visit, we tried the Pumpkin Gnudi, the Ratatouille Pizza, and the fish special which was a portion of a Skate.

When I've made gnudi, or had it elsewhere, it was always a rather large ball of dough with the requisite flavorings. Here, it was a compact mass of a savory pumpkin mash that was deep fried. Odd, but not unpleasant. The five Gnudis were served on top of a sauce that was the traditional sweet pumpkin sauce with spice notes as well as cranberry chunks and roasted hazelnut bits. On top of it all was one deep-fried Kale leaf. That last was totally unnecessary to the dish. The best way to eat this was to make sure that all the different elements were on your spoon at the same time and then it was very tasty. 

The Skate came with roasted Cauliflower, forbidden rice, and a green herb oil Each part of the dish was very tasty although we asked that the fist be cooked until it was flaky, and the kitchen sent it out with the fish still very underdone. Not to the point that we had to send it back, but enough to detract from our enjoyment of it. The fish, rice, and cauliflower were excellent!

The last dish we tried was the Ratatouiile Pizza. This was supposed to be  a pizza with eggplant, zucchini and the like on it. What I saw was mostly tomato sauce with ricotta cheese melted on top. There were a few crumbs of Eggplant here and there, and maybe two tiny chunks of zucchini. The overwhelming flavor was of tomato. At least the thin crust was not greasy this time (On our previous visit, the pizza we had then was so greasy, it melted the paper it was served on!).

We also ordered one glass of wine. We got a regular glass with about 4 Oz of wine in it and were charged $12 for it which is a ripoff. The whole meal cost in the vicinity of $35 per person which is on the high end. 

Another factor is that the menu is relatively slight. There is not too much variety there. So, if you are picky, you are likely to not find too many things to  your liking. While I like the location, concept, and find some of the dishes executed very well, it will probably be a long time until we go there again due to the negative aspects of the place."}
{"text":"I was excited to try because I have always liked the Oakland location. Went for lunch and maybe because I am not a fan of fast food, I really don't like ordering at the cash register first then sitting. I like sitting down and being waited on especially if I am paying a premium. We did have multiple servers ask us if we needed anything but by the time someone returned with my dressing, I had finished my salad. 

I had the Ruben and it was really a disappointment. Very fatty, so much so that I removed the meat and ate the sandwich plain.  I probably will give them another chance because the location is great and their outdoor setting is really nice."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying, this is a fine establishment. Great atmosphere, modern interior. The food and service here is pathetic. It's a Saturday night and quite frankly it's not that busy, therefore that should be sign number 1. 

After being seated, my group of four and I waited about 15 minutes before getting water.. not talking about drinks but WATER. Not to mention it was LUKEWARM. The food was decent although I would not recommend the spinach ravioli. Uncooked noodles stuffed with spinach and topped with sloppy joe meat.. not worth $21. The service could be much better and the food menu is rather pricey. From them running out of certain apps to them not being able to split the receipt correctly, I had a rough experience at The Porch."}
{"text":"We have been waiting for this location to open given that we really liked the location near the Pitt campus. 
Let me say now that they are still figuring thing out and have only been open one week. 
When I registered with the greeter she told me about 20 minutes.  The actual wait was 5.  If they were attempting to under promise and over deliver, they were successful. 
The wings I got were good not great.  The prime rib sandwich on sourdough was tasty. The Mrs's got the burger with shredded pork on it.  She loved it.  The mini baked potatoes were excellent.  
Our server James was very attentive and obviously paid attention during his 12 days of training.   He made a very nice first impression and used those Ritz Carlton service words like a pro...\"my pleasure\" \"of course\". 
The part we sat in was chilly. Next time we will request sitting outside, and there will be a next time.

Update March 2018
This has become one of our favorite places to eat. The staff is excellent (authentic/professional/friendly).  There is evidence that their initial training is being reinforced and modeled by management. 
The menus is limited and a little quirky but we love it. You will too if you bring an open mind.  This is NOT Eat' Park."}
{"text":"We so badly want to like this restaurant. Great location. Friendly service. But the food is just not good. We have been twice (party of three) and tried six different dishes. Salad, pizza, steak - ugh - nothing noteworthy. Odd salad fixings (pulled pork was not edible), skimpy pizza toppings and fatty steaks. The menu is very limited and there just aren't any standout items. Sorry, but we most likely won't be back unless the menu is revamped."}
{"text":"Porch is VERY good with an interesting menu. Glad we tried it. Will definitely go back. Only part less than stellar was beer choices. Best burger ever. And great pizza!"}
{"text":"This place was great. Whitney, our server was awesome. We walked right in and told her we only had 45 min and just wanted a quick drink and appetizer. The food and drinks came out very quickly and she brought the check right away so we didn't have to wait for it. She grabbed our kids to go cups for their Shirley temples. The food was so fresh and very good. Couldn't believe it wasn't packed on a Friday night. We loved the atmosphere too!  I would come back for sure!"}
{"text":"The service is still getting up to speed, but the attitude is VERY friendly and positive.  Awesome decor - great vibe.  The skillet cornbread is amazing...best I've ever had.  The hanger steak was tender and flavorful with a great presentation incorporating the sides/sauces.  The arugala salad with salmon pastrami was excellent.  Will definitely go back, but not often as it's a little pricey."}
{"text":"We have only eaten breakfast here so far but the sandwich options were fantastic. The red potato sides are tremendous with the spices they use. The coffee is piping hot but very tasty and tickles your tongue with flavor. 
It's a bit pricey but considering the fresh ingredients I'll happily pay the amount. 
Sign up for their email list and get valuable coupons to help cut some of the price."}
{"text":"Very good with great potential

The food is very good. The menu is varied, and they always have a couple of specials that are not on the menu, which is good. 

I've had a couple of their fancy sandwiches - the buffalo chicken was a standout, really great - crispy fried chicken with buffalo sauce that wasn't insanely hot but added the right flavor. The bread it was on was a hit as well. 

The service is nice but a little strange. You walk in and order at the counter (fast-casual style), then go find a seat. A server will show up with your drink. 

Various people, all friendly, will deliver your food. It works, but it's a nice enough place and has a price-point that should support real servers. 

Like other upscale \"fast casual\" spots, it's awkward to decide tip-level when you first order, before having received any service.  They present your unsigned credit-card slip at the end of your meal, but no pen to write in the tip and sign the thing. I like to give a good tip for decent service - just wish they would streamline the process a bit. 

But, again, food is quite good - give it a try and post a review. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan. The food is just eh. And it's expensive for what you get. We have gone twice and I had the same experience both times. The service was slow both times."}
{"text":"It was okay. Room for improvement for sure. Maybe lower the prices a little bit and have some happy hour specials other than wine for $35 a bottle. I really wanted to like it since Juniper Grill is out of the question (bad experience there). 

The service was good, our waitress was nice and attentive. The menu just didn't have enough affordable options for my pocket. The atmosphere really doesn't fit the prices for some reason."}
{"text":"I honestly just was not impressed. I was excited to try, but then was disappointed. The two positives were the atmosphere and beer selection- I did really like that. Food however was a different story. I ordered the Grilled Romaine salad, soup, and my fiancé and I split the cheese tray. (He had the steak). Prior to ordering the salad, I asked the waitress if I could add a protein to make the salad an entree, and she told me that it was an entree salad and it came with shrimp. When I got my salad, there were 3 pieces of shrimp on it, all of which were ice cold in the middle. That would have been fine except for the fact that it was a grilled romaine salad, served warm. So I had warm lettuce, 3 partially frozen shrimps, and homemade croutons that were soggy-  for $13. The soup was average, and the cheese tray was good, but for $15 there wasn't any bread or any thing that came with it. Just cheese and a few olives/almonds. My fiancé said his steak was good, but we ended up spending over $75 and left hungry. We won't be back unless it's just for drinks. Also, the menu was extremely limited."}
{"text":"Not sure how many more times I'll come here and be disappointed. My heart wants this place to succeed, I love their other location. 

Today my wine was warm, I mean... like it had been sitting out for hours. (I told y'all I'm rating restaurants based on wine size and temperature... this place fails both ways) 

Veggie burger used to be great.. is it frozen now?! Looks like a frozen patty.

Bartender was super sweet but not very attentive."}
{"text":"I stopped in for an early dinner on Sunday around 5. The place was not busy at all. I was seated right away. While my server didn't seem to know the beers on tap, she got the correct list very quickly. 
She didn't offer to tell me the specials until I asked. 

I got the tomato soup, which she did ask if I wanted ahead of my grilled romaine dinner salad. 
Both soup and salad came very quickly and my server checked on me a few times, but was not overbearing. 

Soup was good. It not amazing. Grilled romaine salad had 3 large shrimp. It was good, but again not amazing. 

I love the outdoor porch area. But the metal chairs are not comfortable at all. I would not hang out there for any length of time. 


All that said, I would try it again."}
{"text":"Food and service fail... stay away.  If you go, don't order anything of culinary robustness.  Stick to simple items and lower your expectations.  Kitchen execution must be an issue, Need some pro's to execute the menu"}
{"text":"I wasn't in a rush to go here based on other reviews, but I went for lunch today and loved it. The staff was very friendly, the food was great and delivered quickly, and the atmosphere in general is just nice. The space is spread out and big enough that you aren't on top of the table next to you. My group got a steak hoagie, fish and chips (the chips are delicious), and a chopped salad. The servings were a good size, big enough that we were full and small enough that we didn't have leftovers. Overall, I would suggest giving it a try, at least for lunch."}
{"text":"The menu is small, but very interesting. My dad said that the mushrooms on his pizza actually were different than the standard mushrooms you'd get in a store and I had asparagus on my pizza for the first time. The portion sizes are large. The mixed drink I got was great. There are some strange things... They definitely wasted a lot of pepper flakes and some oregano by putting piles of those and cheese on the plate instead of allowing us to choose if we wanted it. They also didn't give us a spoon, so we were scooping the cheese and oregano (and a few pepper flakes for him) on our forks, which isn't the best way to get something off a tray onto anything.

The service was great and friendly, but when we had leftover pizza, she gave us weird containers where we had to stack the three leftover slices on top of each other. Dad had gotten a half pizza box when he had been there before. I asked about them and they weren't out of them. She'd just chosen to give us boxes that required us to stack our food on top of itself. I suggested that she might want to go with pizza boxes for pizza in the future. She offered to get me one, but I'd already stacked my pizza and I didn't want to waste the container I'd been given.

Their water glasses are super small, but at least they leave the bottle of water on the table, too. Their restroom was clean. However, you're required to touch the handle on the way out and they only have the air dryers/germ tossing around machines. Better than the Dyson enclosed germ machines, but still risky. So, I had to wipe my hands off on my clothes AND maneuver my sweater so I could use it to open the door. If you're going to leave me without an option to dry my hands safely, you should at least let me get out of the restroom without having to TOUCH the door. I can't imagine how I'd have gotten out in short sleeves. It was hard enough in the sweater I was wearing.

Oh! Dad had been there for lunch before. For lunch it's more of a counter service place where you order your food and drinks and they give you a number to put on your table, then deliver the food. For dinner, they have full wait staff service."}
{"text":"Very cool atmosphere here on a Sunday afternoon. My wife and I both loved our meals; I got the marg pizza and she got the eggs Benedict. The server was nice and efficient. I would recommend this place for sure, definitely worth a try; we will be back."}
{"text":"Extremely uncomfortable chairs, table sloped downhill. The Caesar salad with chicken...I could hardly find the chicken...3.00 extra for chicken and you could hardly identify the chicken. 
Will we return?NOPE!"}
{"text":"The host without asking, started to seat us Inside and when we asked to sit outside - got an eye roll. 

The calamari appetizer, was all filler.  Had to place a 2nd order, for only three ppl. 

Ordered two apps, but meh and decided not to stay for dinner

Atmosphere was great, but wish the food was better."}
{"text":"The menus prices are all over the place.  Husband got sausage and eggs and it came out as one egg and what looked like microwaveable sausage links.  Sincerely looked like a Bob Evans breakfast and charged $14.  In the meantime, I had a massive gourmet vegetarian croissant sandwich for $10?  I asked to add on a side salad, which was only mixed greens with a little olive oil and was charged $4? For a restaurant in the Eat and Park chain I think they are acting a little big for their britches and don't know how to price correctly.  $8 for ONE small mimosa made with bottom shelf sparkling wine is a bit crazy when you consider you can get an entire carafe of mimosas for $8 at other trendy places filled with televisions outside Pittsburgh. We spent an evening at Alla Famiglia last night with top shelf liquor and fine food and the bill was only $40 more than a brunch here in the suburbs at an Eat and Park chain."}
{"text":"We visited this place for brunch today and got a very good first impression.
The food ( Sausage & Kale Pizza, Salmon Pastrami Salad and Concord flavor sorbet + Blady Marry and the flight of 4 beers) was VERY GOOD. In case of Pizza, cocktail and sorbet even outstanding. The dough of the pizza is quite unique (at least we haven't met this kind of dough in any other places).
The ambiance was modern, clean and appealing to the eye.
The service was very nice, but the guy was in the end of his first week of training so some mistakes were made, but it was very minor and didn't spoil our mood at all.
And the value was just great for the experience recieved.
Wish we would have such a place in Baltimore, MD were we live, but will visit here every time we are in town. Thank you for a great brunch to the team of The Porch."}
{"text":"The food was nothing to write home about.  Just average.  Sounded much more delicious on the menu description than it actually was.  Ordered Broccoli Cheese Soup (completely puréed), Margherita Pizza (didnt think it matched description on menu, although was larger than I anticipated), and pulled pork sandwhich.  Food wasn't bad, but there is definitely better out there locally.  Service was great.  All the servers were very attentive and repeatedly check on us for refills.  Not sure how I feel about dining there again.  Maybe??"}
{"text":"Loved it! Food and service were great! The burger is delicious and so are the pizzas!"}
{"text":"This place is terrific. We come to Pittsburgh several times a year to visit our daughter & her family. Porch has now become a destination for dinner during every visit. 

The pizza is wonderful. A tasty thin crust but with lots of extra dough around the edge if you want more to crunch on. 

We also like the pasta Bolognese big time. And the salmon. 

Another part that works for us is that this is an upscale restaurant that welcomes children. We like to sit at a table near the grassy area so the kids can play there but we can keep an eye on them."}
{"text":"The Porch at Siena has one of the best brunches in Pittsburgh. It's a fact. From fantastic bloody marys to their interesting chorizo eggs benedict to their perfectly balanced breakfast sandwich, they offer a full, and compelling brunch menu. 

Despite reading other reviews regarding poor service, I have never had a bad waiter or bartender. And my food and beverages have always been brought out swiftly.

I have tried a variety of items off of their brunch menu and have found them all delicious. The chorizo eggs benedict is one of my favorites. My eggs were cooked perfectly and had a nice runny yolk and the chorizo adds a new complex flavor profile to a tried and true brunch staple. 

That being said the best item on the brunch menu is, without a doubt, their breakfast sandwich. It sounds simple, just eggs, bacon and cheese on some sourdough bread, but it packs a serious punch. The bread is absolutely delicious, it has a warm, buttery crunch on the outside while the still being soft enough for a sandwich. The bacon is thick cut and adds a nice saltiness and smokiness to the sandwich. Finally, the cheese they use is perfect for this sandwich the cheddar ties the whole sandwich together. Order this sandwich, I promise you will not be disappointed.

In regard to their sides I have tried and loved their biscuits. I rarely have enough room to eat them with an entree however each time I have been able to order them they have been fluffy and delicious. It comes with homemade apple butter and jellies. All their breakfast items come with a side of their potatoes which are another highlight. They are crispy on the edges but soft and fluffy in the middle. An in house curry ketchup is served with the potatoes and I wish I could bottle it up and take it home. It offers and small but flavorful kick to the ketchup that puts it a cut above other ketchups, even homemade.

I'm also a big fan of their original bloody mary. It has a nice strong horseradish bite while still remaining refreshing and smooth on the finish. I order it for every brunch there. They also offer seasonal bloody marys, however I have never found them to be as good as the original. Despite being a cilantro lover, their cilantro and habanero bloody mary is too strong on the cilantro and just didn't provide the same fantastic flavor of the original.

Overall, I really have no bad things to say about the Porch, at least for Brunch. I have not tried the restaurant at other times, so I can't speak to their normal lunch or dinner service, but if it's anything like their brunch it will be fantastic.

TLDR: Good service, delicious brunch, order the breakfast sandwich and a pitcher of bloody mary, 5/5"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here with a friend. The service was prompt, the waitress friendly.   We had a pretzel appetizer, I ate the roast duck, my wife and her friend shared the Bianca pizza. The duck leg I had was very dark in color, but had a very good flavor. The cabbage and mashed potatoes that came with it were both tasty, and the lingonberries added a touch of sweetness. The pizza was large, easily enough for two to share, and had a pleasant combination of flavors. 

It wasn't crowded, but it being Super Bowl Sunday might have had something to do with that.  The only hiccup was that they were out of Pepsi from the drink fountain, but they had bottles on hand as a backup. Since the pizza was being shared, they brought extra Parmesan cheese and hot pepper flakes. 

The prices were average to high, so this won't become an every week place for us, but I expect we will return."}
{"text":"I have no major complaints about our dinner at The Porch at Sienna. I've never been to The Porch at Schenely so I don't know how it compares. Other reviewers seem to be upset with slow service but I think this should be somewhat expected when a new restaurant opens up and the kinks are still being worked out. So, for that reason I think the other reviews may be a little harsh. I personally didn't find service to be slow when we were there. It was a busy Friday night so I was prepared for a wait but our party of 2 was seated in only 15 minutes. Bar, dining room a patio seating. Fireplace outside.

The restaurant was very clean which I expect since it is brand new. Our server was pleasant and helpful. Our appetizer and salad was out in only 5 minutes and the rest of our food only about 10-15 minutes later. I really enjoyed the margherita pizza which was very flavorful and enough for 2 people with 6 slices. Caesar salad wasn't anything special and the potatoes were a little bland for me. However, the potatoes did come with a curry ketchup that my husband loved, it is just personally not something I like. Prices are inexpensive I'd say, approx $34 for the 2 of us including a beer for my husband and not including tip. 

While I was not blown away by my experience,
I definitely did not have the same negative experience as some of the other reviewers did. I thought it was good and I would come back. Would like to sit on the patio next time if it is not so busy."}
{"text":"Twice now I've been to The Porch at Siena in the new development behind the Whole Foods Marketplace on Washington Road in the South Hills. 

I'll start off by saying that for what it is, I like it. I like the selection of ever changing craft beers which they have on tap, and they have some good ones. Example being The Porch has Lost Abbey on draft. This is something I've never personally seen on a draft list, so I was pretty pumped. Definitely had to have one. 

The Porch...Probably my favorite part of the facility is the outside dining area in which you can see their small garden where they grow herbs, tomatoes and other crops which are used in their finished product. I like when a restaurant does this. They had a pretty nice crop going too by the looks of it. 

The Porch seems to be pretty heavy into their wood fired oven which I really like. They seem to have some generally solid offerings such as their pizzas. The margherita pizza which I had ate on our first visit had a nice flavor however it seemed to require a bit more sauce. I did enjoy how they gave you a small sampling of different herbs, parmesan cheese and dry chili flake. I liked this much more than offering a shaker full of each. Pizza is good for a wood fired pizza, however there are better. I think some improvement could be made here and I'm sure in time it will improve. 

On our second time at The Porch we shared the Farm Bread. With the oven toasted bread you get apple butter, a jam(which was exceptional, and in fact made me start liking jam) and a honey butter. All were nice. Three large pieces of bread are served. Some pieces seemed to get a little black. Could have done a better job there.

My better half had the potato soup which she said she liked. However I tasted it and the bacon in it to me was a bit smokey, I would say more than normal. I don't generally care for potato soup so it was a bit lost on me anyhow. 

For her entree she went for the caesar salad which was a nice sized salad. I'm not a fan of caesar dressing so I can't say how it tasted, but it certainly looked appetizing.

I had the Hanger Steak with smoked potatoes, broccolini and a saffron zabaione. The steak was salted perfectly, the steak was cooked to a medium rare which was perfect. As for the potatoes the smokey lingering after taste was a bit heavy and it didn't really do it for me. It over powered the fingerling potatoes. They also seemed a bit under cooked. The broccolini was quite good and had a nice crisp texture to it, but not much flavor over all. The zabaione lost on me so I can't comment much on it. It was a good plate though for $23.00

Service was good, however our server seemed a bit nervous. I couldn't tell if she was new, but she did a good job, was pleasant and that's what counts. We will return."}
{"text":"First visit last night for date night. It was crowded and the Staff was young and friendly. We only had a 10 min wait at 7:30 on a Friday night, and were seated and orders taken quickly. Menu was a little unique but we settled on some appetizers and drinks. We enjoyed everything except the deviled eggs, which our server was polite enough not to charge us for. Overall nice experience, but the rareness of some of the menu items may not be our first choice for next date night."}
{"text":"I came here the other afternoon for an event and I had a really enjoyable time. I loved the decor and the overall ambiance of the outside seating area. They have a great concept of using local and fresh products and I think it's awesome how they have vegetables and fruit growing on site. I had a zucchini flatbread that the zucchini was picked that morning! I look forward to returning here at another time to see what other new dishes they are serving."}
{"text":"Will never go back.  My friend and I went in on a Saturday night and the place was not crowded at all.  We sat there for 20 mins and no one came over to offer us drinks or take our order.  For the prices, I expect friendlier staff and efficient business practices.  It is unfortunate the service was underwhelming because we left before anyone even realized we had zero service.  No comments on food as we didn't even get that far."}
{"text":"Brunch with a dozen family members. Everyone enjoyed it. The atmosphere is faux rustic and very cute. The service was excellent. Food ranged from pizzas to chicken BLT to eggs Benedict to special ordering pain in the arse vegan niece. They were very accommodating."}
{"text":"This restaurant was an extreme disappointment. Noise level is off the charts, service was iffy and their interpretation of a panzanella salad is unlike anything I've ever seen. Even after complaining and showing a picture of a real panzanella salad, there it was on my check. I was asked if I wanted something else but after the interminable wait for the original meal, I didn't want to wait for another 45 minutes for another meal. Poor experience allthecway around"}
{"text":"My husband and I have really enjoyed the porch in Oakland, but this location was extremely disappointing. My friend and I ordered cups of tea, the pumpkin waffle and the quiche. First, the tea was not prepared correctly and resulted in a bitter beverage.  Next, when we ordered the quiche the waitress walked away without asking whether we wanted greens or potatoes on the side (you have a choice of either). Then, the waffle was completely dry. We drenched it with syrup and waited, but it was drier than cardboard and difficult to even swallow. The espresso marscapone was on the side and very sparse, so it did little to help. The quiche crust was burnt to make matters worse. When the waitress brought our food out we had to move everything on the table for her to make room. She was quite inattentive and we had to get up and ask a different server for our check.  I won't be returning to this location, and I sure hope they can turn things around."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all with this place. The veggie pizza had no recognizable veggies on it and it was just blah. Waitress was very nice. Nine dollars for a cheap glass of wine I don't think so. Did have a decent small potato appetizer which was good for four dollars. I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Pizza is great! I had the chicken and mushroom pizza and loved it... it was huge!!! My parents have been twice and loved it. They had the chicken with mashed potatoes. My nephew had the porch burger with tots and he devoured it. It was all delicious. Service was slow but it was worth the wait for the food!"}
{"text":"Been to this location twice. Somewhat of a let-down on the service-- not because of the people, but their training was lacking. C'mon Porch-- this is the easy part! 

Prices are similar to Juniper Grill, but this place is not nearly as nice, and the menu is def not comparable."}
{"text":"We had brunch at Sienna Sunday and it was my first time there. My wife had been there 2-3 times already and had good things to say so we tried it for brunch. We waited a few mins for a table to be cleaned, but We were able to sit outside under the covered patio which was great. We started with coffee which wasn't too bad. I ordered the breakfast sandwich (recommended by the waitress) and it came with delicious potatoes. Unfortunately, the bacon on my sandwich was hard to chew and the egg was a little overdone.  They also don't have Heinz ketchup and make their own so a huge negative in my book. My wife wasn't too happy with her eggs Benedict. We spit a Bloody Mary and it was rather blah. We had to ask for more tomato juice because it was super spicy. Overall, it has a great atmosphere but the food today was not great. I will give it another try for dinner because i have heard great things from others."}
{"text":"I was super excited to try this place, but I left a little disappointed. First, the water pitchers were dirty inside. My cup was dirty, too. The calamari appetizer was mostly breading and overly salted. The chicken dish was way overpriced for the amount of chicken I got. I get the \"quality over quantity\" concept, but for the price I paid I would have liked to have at least a half size chicken instead of about 3-4 oz of over salted chicken. I finished the entire plate but still left hungry. I guess I ordered the wrong thing, but roasted chicken is usually hard to mess up. The potatoes and green beans that came with my meal were good though. My kids' got HUGE pizzas for their meals, which they enjoyed. I tried their beef ribs special and those were spectacular. The macaroni it came with was a little too fussy though. Too many things in it (vegetables and flowers don't belong in mac and cheese). I like simple mac and cheese. I'd try it again but I won't be ordering the roasted chicken or calamari."}
{"text":"We just finished having brunch at The Porch. We are extremely disappointed. Everything on the menu sounded absolutely delicious and was beautiful. Unfortunately, the taste didn't live up to the expectations. We ordered the cinnamon rolls which were so hard that you could literally bang it off the plate. The edges of the biscuit were soft and warm and buttery, but when you got 1 bite in, it was ice cold. I assume that they premade them, refrigerate them and then reheat as ordered. My boyfriend got the breakfast sandwich and he said it was okay, but really greasy. I had a salad which was okay, not the worst salad, but far from the best. 

The other thing that was frustrating was the service. The waitress was extremely friendly, but very absent. We waited over 10 minutes after being seated to be greeted. All of our food came out, but we waited several minutes before our waitress came over to check on us. My boyfriend was done with his meal before I was able to ask for dressing. It took even longer to get our check. The slow pace was very frustrating. The restaurant itself wasn't even half full. I'm not sure what other tables she was responsible for. It might not have been her fault, but management should have stepped in to notice that her tables were being neglected. 

It's a beautiful restaurant, but not somewhere we would choose to return to."}
{"text":"The serving staff gets 5 stars but the cooks/bartender get 2 bringing my overall review of Porch to 3. My fam (lots of kids there on Sunday night!) started with the bread and crab/corn fritter appetizers ... the bread was delicious. The crab/corn balls weren't bad but they looked a little sad - 5 tiny balls in a larger app bowl with lots of decoration. My thought, \"womp womp.\" If my husband didn't finish it in one bite, I would have had time to take a picture. Also, I ordered a blackberry gin drink to start but I had to send it back. I kept sipping and sipping and something didn't taste right - so I asked my hubs to try and he said, \"yeah, that's heavy on limes.\" Limes?! Limes! Yes. There were 4 or 5 in my glass which explained why it tasted like lime aid to me (yuck) and not *blackberry* gin - the waitress kindly took it back when I pointed out there was no mention of limes in the drink description and I actually don't like limes. Onto the main food dishes - I got flank steak and my hubs got the burger. He enjoyed the burger but my flank steak - ordered medium/well was more like rare. I didn't send it back after the drink fiasco but this is what made me realize it's the cooking staff that doesn't have enough experience. The food concepts on the menu are great but delivering on expectations (based off menu and order) is where they fail for me. The sweet potato fries were good but for a $23 steak, I hope it's cooked to order and the sweet potato fries couldn't save that. We finished with bread pudding (eh) and ice cream. Kids were happy. Hubs said, \"It was ok. Not my favorite meal.\" It wasn't mine either and I just think that when you eat out, it's a place you want to go to because the food is THAT good, not because you're too tired to cook. I don't see us returning anytime soon when there are other places to try and nothing  that makes me want to go back (nice decor though!)."}
{"text":"A great new addition to Upper St. Clair. My friends and I came for brunch here on Saturday. The restaurant is pretty big with the outdoor patio being a nice option during the summer. We started off with some donuts. They are fresh, warm, and a great way to start brunch. My one friend did say that her donuts were a little overcooked. I had the special omelet of the day, which had salmon in it. My friends had the quiche and breakfast sandwich. All our portions were quite large and filling. My omelet was very good. The english muffin was a bit chewy and thick, so I only had half of it. The field greens were very peppery. Overall, the meal was not outstanding, but a nice change for breakfast in the area."}
{"text":"we waited for all of the hubbub of it being new to die down before we went. we usually eat early on saturdays, 4-5 o'clock, as we don't eat all day. most times, we're not the only people. it looked cavernous & empty! I know it's also part of the eat-n-park, & it shows. it was too fast foody, bland looking, cheap. I expected the porch at schenley, just a little bit. I also expected other people to be there. if there were 20 people i'd be surprised.
the wine list could really use a few more choices, but was adequate. i saw online that they had prime rib. we've been looking for that elusive piece of beef since our last place stopped serving it. the meal came with a salad so we skipped apps for dessert!  more of the eat-n-park feel when our food kept coming at an amazing speed! I know, i'm complaining about getting food too quickly! the prime rib came & was rare! good start! I asked for more jus. I was given beef gravy. baaaad sign!! it was just ok. there was almost no seasoning on it. what a shame. it came with a succotash that was delicious! yay! we got the last 2 pieces of the \"day's\" dessert. it was an apple crepe, sounded good, came with mascarpone filling. it was good, but the crepe itself was a little dense. 
all in all, it wasn't bad, but I have had better. your call if you go."}
{"text":"My experience here was excellent!! The atmosphere is beautiful no matter where you sit in the restaurant. The staff was extremely friendly, and was very attentive.

I had more of a catered meal as a part of a yelp elite experience and was overall very please. The best bite was a prime rib crostini, which had pickled onions and perfectly cooked, thinly sliced meat. In addition, the piece of honeycomb from their own beehives was so delicious.

All of their food items are local, sustainable, or grown on site. You can truly taste the quality and attention to detail. It cannot be understated the relationship this restaurant has with the community. Just try some of their signature honey ice cream from Millie's.

Cannot wait to go back and eat some more of this delicious, beautiful food!"}
{"text":"Today is opening day at the sister restaurant of the Porch at Schenley. I was told that the two places are identical in their menu offerings.

When I arrived I was greeted warmly and introduced to the manager Michael Damas. I learned that the concept behind this restaurant is to use local home grown ingredients and they are actually starting a garden in the back where they hope to use some of its produce. They also serve farm to table meals.

I learned that until 4 pm which they consider lunch you place your order at the register, they give you a number and then you can carry it to whatever table you wish to sit at. They have two inviting fireplaces both inside and out-The restaurant is very beautiful with a firefly motif to it both inside and out. I learned that this motif was to capture the idea of seeing fireflies on your front porch while relaxing on a summer's evening.

When they change over for dinner it becomes full service. Brunch is served on Sat and Sun. I also understood it is one of the Eat n Park hospitality groups.

For my lunch I decided to have the strawberry salad special with blue cheese. I decided to hold off on dessert not knowing my portion size. I got my food fairly quickly. As they told me the salad had a bit of a \"zing\" to it on the dressing but otherwise it was good. An item of note, if you want bread with your salad then please ask for regular bread because they serve a farm bread for $6.00. Expect to pay for this place. Lunch prices fall within the $11.00-$30.00 range. 

I did ask to see the dessert menu and learned that among their offerings they serve Millie's ice cream for $5.00 as one of the items. Currently they are only carrying two flavors-rhubarb and chocolate but they expect to get more once the business gets established.

If you want dessert and didn't prepay for it then you would have to go to the counter again to order it and pay there. I had the chocolate ice cream which for Millie's is always 5 stars in quality.

The staff is more than willing to attend to your needs. I found them exceedingly friendly and helpful.

Getting here can be part of the problem since Siena Drive is a half intersection. I had a similar problem when Whole Foods opened here. My advice is to enter and exit off Washington Road across from South Hills Village. If you choose to go Siena Drive then you must enter it headed towards Washington Rd and if you exit that way you can only go to the right.

Another thing is there is much construction in this area since they are building some sort of mall complex and it is easy to find yourself in the middle on construction (as I did when I tried to find it) but once I had it down I could park easily.

In addition to salads they serve sandwiches with your choice of mixed greens or taters, pizza, a kids menu, and of course they have a full bar. The bar has a wine list along with beer and mixed cocktails. They also are BOYB but they have a $15.00 corkage fee.

The executive chef is Keven Hermann. This place seems nice but can get pretty pricey if you are bringing a family. Will give it another go round once things settle down with this construction nightmare surrounding it."}
{"text":"One of my favorite new restaurants in the south hills. Relaxed environment, good food, great staff, and a company that cares about sustainability. I've gone with my husband and friends to both this location and the Schenley location and we've had the brunch, burgers, cheese board, and my go to -fig and goat cheese pizza with arugula. Will definitely keep coming back."}
{"text":"When the weather cooperates, there really isn't a better spot than the patio for a frosty beverage and a bite to eat."}
{"text":"I ate lunch today and I ordered a regular pizza, the pizza tasted pretty good despite being undercooked on the bottom and limp in the middle.  I ordered water and the carafe was very dirty, it looked like someone added a dash of pepper to it.  I asked my server, who was very good by the way, if I could buy a bottle of water and she told me that they didn't sell bottled water.  On my way out of the restaurant I noticed their display cooler full of bottles of drinks including a whole case worth of water.  After inquiring one of the other servers told me that they only sell the bottles during the weekdays.  I asked to talk to a manager and he gave me a free bottle of water to try to shut me up.  When i asked him why she wouldn't sell me the bottle he played dumb like he didn't know, not wanting to have to acknowledge the stupid \"no bottles on the weekend\" policy.  I feel bad for the waitress to have to deal with this situation all because of some arrogant policy that some idiot in upper management came up with.  The manager who tried to play dumb to save face is childish, at least be honest and own up to your lame policies.  All of this could have been avoided if they weren't serving dirty water in the first place.  I understand wanting to do things your own way and not wanting to have tacky looking bottles of soda on your tables during weekends.  You should understand that water is an exception and if you want to be as upscale of an establishment as your policies would suggest than you should offer a legitimate high end water option."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in both the food and service. The food had no taste.   The server hardly came around, drinks were needed. Would not stop again."}
{"text":"So the tap water was ok...

We were mildly excited when we were seated immediately at 6:45 on a Friday night, but then we didn't even see our server for at least 15 minutes after having been seated.  Water was given to us a few minutes in by a food runner or busser.  Once Whitney finally arrived, we knew what we wanted, but wanted to hear the soups.  Upon hearing the choices of either a vegan chili or butternut squash, we requested a few minutes to look for a different app while we waited for our drinks.  I ordered a glass of Pinot noir, and my bf ordered an iced tea.  Minutes passed, and a random girl brought his iced tea.  After waiting another five minutes to get my wine, I just said we should leave.  I'd had a glass of tap water in 25 minutes of being there.  And considering we were seated immediately, I should have been able to get a glass of wine.  One.  Glass.  I will give them another chance in the future because I know that they've been open for about 10 days right now, but it won't be for a while.  We had such a great experience at the Schenley location that this one is  basically a polar opposite."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised with this restaurant. The inside is very clean and trendy.  I had a watermelon mojito which was fantastic and the mint was picked right of their garden.  I then had a few menu items that were made with their vegetables and herbs from the garden that is right outside of the restaurant.  I loved how everything tasted so fresh. I will be back for sure to try some more menu items."}
{"text":"Wow! I loved coming here for brunch on a Sunday afternoon with my friend. I have been to the one downtown before, but have yet to try this one right up the street from me! It's not super upscale, but it's a fancier appeal than most restaurants in the area. I enjoyed the decor. The menu has a great variety of items and also has a nice cocktail selection. Iced coffee wasn't on the menu, but they made me a glass, no problem. That was very nice. I ordered the eggs benedict with a side of bacon. OMG it was some of the best I've had in town. Loved it!! My friend ordered the breakfast sandwich and she enjoyed her meal as well. That was my second option I was thinking of ordering and it appeared to be delicious. The portion sizes are nice too, where you will definitely be leaving full! The staff was very friendly as well. I was apprehensive to come due to mixed reviews, but I will definitely be back to try out dinner and drinks one nice-especially once the weather gets warmer and we can sit on the nice \"porch\" that they have outside :)"}
