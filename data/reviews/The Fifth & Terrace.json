{"text":"The Fifth Grill and Terrace was rated on a blog as one of the best steaks in Toronto.  My husband and I were excited to go, especially because it also boasted a beautiful rooftop dining patio.  The experience was neat, as the entrance is an unmarked door in an alley and after being checked off the reservations list were escorted up an old industrial elevator to the top floor.  We had the place to ourselves which was a little weird at 6:30 on a Saturday night.  This meant our waitress was very attentive.  The wine list was short and expensive but did have a bottle of Canadian red which was delicious.  The food was very expensive as well and was fine, but not delicious and worth the cost ($50/main mean plus $7/side vegetables).  The salmon appetizer was very disappointing since it was just a couple slabs of cold salmon and no flavor profile.  The ambiance was very nice, though there is no view since it is squashed between taller buildings."}
{"text":"First time eating here and I was very impressed. The atmosphere is very relaxed chic, in that it's very nicely decorated, the space is beautiful, but not in a way that seems forced.  Table started with oysters and charcuterie board, oysters were fresh and sweet, board had a nice variety. The ladies had filets while the gentlemen had the strip. You could tell right away that the meat was very good quality, and cooked perfectly. One slight disappointment was the peppercorn sauce, I could be wrong but it seemed like they used dried peppercorns vs fresh, and the flavor suffered. A nice potatoe dish came with the steaks but whatever you do, get the 5th fries WITH truffle! Might have been the highlight of the meal. Servers were kind and knowledgeable.  Overall it's a can't miss for a special night out, treat yourself, it's money well spent."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this restaurant.  The food was very good and the atmosphere was very cozy.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"The Fifth Grill has always been a consistently great experience. I have been on different occasions; the food is always amazing and it has a great feel to the room. Although the dining room was full it still was quiet enough to hear everyone at our table. The chef came by and talked to us about the menu and what we may want to eat. He sent us an amuse that started off the night.. The manager checked on our table throughout the night and was elegant with a sense of humour.  I highly recommend going for any special occasion and going to the upstairs restaurant."}
{"text":"My boyfriend brought me here for our one year anniversary in April. Everything from the mysterious wooden elevator ride to the romantic ambiance to the food and the service was exceptional. I had the mixed grill dinner with a side of asparagus and we shared sorbet for desert. He had the steak (can't remember the cut) with a side of mushrooms. The food was top notch and our server was very attentive and accommodating to my gluten sensitivity. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Small restaurant tucked upstairs of the club. Beautiful antique decor with superb food and service.  We were greeted at the entrance of the club and walked to the elevator which took us to the 5th floor where the restaurant was.  We were a party of three and wanted to try a variety. Everything we ordered from the menu was spectacular. We had 3 bottles of wine which were all recommended by our waiter (who we later found out was the manager) that paired incredably with the food.  Slow braised Osso Buco bedded by their delicious roasted sweet potato risotto was absoutely spectacular. The slow braised meat just fell right apart and melted in our mouth.  Filet Mignon was perfectly cooked at medium rare.   Sides of the Vongole Pasta/Duck Pasta/Parmesan Gnocchi were all amazing if I had to choose one to recommend it would definately be their Parm Gnocchi.  The original 5th french fries were perfectly salted and crisp.  Sauteed greens were amazing as well.  As for desserts we had two orders of their selection of gelato which isnt much, it's two small scoops.  Selected Artisan Cheese 3 different blocks which ended the night perfectly with our finishing wine.  Dinner at the fifth was to our suprise absoultely fantastic. Not expecting too much of it our taste buds were shocked with flavour. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who's looking to go out for a nice quiet dinner that appreciates fine quality food.   Afterwards if you're feeling it, maybe some fun downstairs? There is no cover for the club if you dine here :)"}
{"text":"All the food was amazing and the staff prompt and friendly. Loved the elevator ride and old warehouse - feel.  Went for the Winterlicious deal, braised beef was delicious although the full scallops were a bit much in one bite.  Boyfriend ordered the salmon which was some of the best either of us had had. Great job! Expensive but well worth it."}
{"text":"A great Toronto find.  Food, service top notch for us ( party of 7) ambience outstanding.  Wine list is small, but has good choices.  Prices not cheap, but on par for this class of restaurant.  Loved, will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place five stars for the gorgeous view, decor, and location. We happened by this place while looking for a restaurant for our anniversary. Fifth anniversary at the Fifth - it worked out well! The entrance is a little hard to find, and the clandestine entrance in the alleyway gave it more of a club feel rather than an upscale restaurant. We got into an old wooden elevator that had to be manned by a cheerful elevator operator (he had to open and close the doors by hand!) and were taken to the top floor of a truly gorgeous loft. We sat on the heated patio and indulged in the beautiful nighttime panorama of downtown Toronto.   The food was delicious. We ordered the 'mixed grill,' a sort of sampler menu of three different types of grilled meats: round of lamb with chimmichuri, rare New York striploin, and rosemary crusted chicken breast. Maybe in a different location the food would have been just so-so, but when you feel like you're dining in a secret location, taking in the gorgeous view, the food becomes that much tastier. Next anniversary, we're going to look for a location named the Sixth."}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's birthday celebration. The ambiance is kind of make shift loft wanna be patio / terrace/ club - not sure what the theme is. The service is less than stellar, serving champagne at room temp, inattentive, and intrusive. I'm sorry but another failed attempt at a NY/Chicago style steakhouse in TO. Prices are similar to Ruth, Jacob, and Morton's, but quality overall is not on par.   My suggestion - buy some US prime aged rib-eye and throw it on the barbie."}
{"text":"Fantastic experience.  Rare to come across a restaurant that scores so high on atmosphere.  The downstairs floor is a large nightclub spot on the weekends, and its currently decorated as if the Brits were still ruling India.  White wood paneling, large ceiling fans, birdcages laying around.  Could almost taste the gin and tonic when we walked in the door.  For dinner you head up an old-school, vertically-opening, tastefully decorated (yes, decorated) elevator.  The old freight style that has a doorman.  Best decorated elevator I've ever been in.  Top floor of the building is the dining room (huge) and covered outdoor patio, where we ate.  Again the decor and the vibe set a great mood.  40s standards/jazz/big band music playing all evening.  Guess I should mention the food, too.  Everything we had was great, the menu is medium-sized but offers a good amount of options.  Service was impeccable and the wine list is small but impressive.  Will be going back next time I'm in Toronto, and will be recommending to anyone else who visits.  Swanky."}
{"text":"I gave it 2 stars for the food, Conar our waiter on the other hand receives a 5 star review for amazing service! I love food, I get excited when I see amazing things on a menu. This can be said for the Fifth, they have amazing dishes on the menu, in black writing nicely laid out on a fold-able menu which was cool and unique.  The ambiance is really cool, I unfortunately did not get to experience the cool elevator and magic tricks I walked down a few steps right into the restaurant off of richmond. The place is kind of a chic cabin feel to it. Chandeliers and deer antlers dont sound like a good mix but the most definitely are. I don't agree with putting brown paper on your tables unless you are jack astors or montanas but hey that's just me. I also don't enjoy visually seeing where they keep the roll ups and coffee pots ect just esthetically an eye sore.  Our waiter was pleasant and greeted us promptly. I ordered a Tortia soup it came out luke warm but I was super hungry and it was pretty good.  We ordered wings as our main which we figured to be a safe bet. Plus we were watching the game which we felt like we had to do the whole sports experience. Half Honey Garlic and Half Medium. They are a tad bit dusted with flour and they were nice and big and not dried out. The honey garlic flavored came out incredibly salty. We were told it is a soya sauce base and was allowed to test the sauce but it was definitely not as salty as the wings. I am not sure if they just doubled up on the sauce or someone accidentally salted them before saucing them. The medium flavored wings had to be better, well they weren't as salty but they tasted as if they had been baked in a bowl of butter. If you love butter you will love the medium flavored wings, we were told that its traditional to cut your hot sauce with butter so it is not so spicy. Maybe in the states butter flavored wings are all the rage but butter is only tasty in small amounts.  We shamefully asked to order something else instead. I hate sending food back, but conar assured us that he'd rather we enjoy our food then not. We ended up splitting the \"Kale Karnivore\" Salad and the \"80z AAA\" burger. Well the fries are amazing! The Kale salad was 13$ and a it came out with 1 circular piece of Pancetta fried on top and tiny bacon bit sized pieces of the other cut of pancetta, they also advertised avocado in the salad ...... well it was probably 1 slice of avocado sliced up into tiny pieces about the size of a m&m. \"Karnivore\" should not be in the name of that salad. The dressing was nice and light but it really just seemed to be a bowl of kale and spinach with some crumbs of stuff at the bottom.  The burger was most definitely not an 8oz patty I'm sorry maybe I'm a bad judge of size but Im pretty sure ive had 5oz steaks in a salad before and it was about the same size as the burger. We opted out of the \"surprise sauce\" that's listed on the menu, only because of our experience with their \"sauces\". The burger was meh a bit dry and no real flavor. But like I said the fries were fantastic.  Their wine list is not incredibly extensive, definitely a little tiny bit more creative then most, their lightly oaked Chardonnay was really tasty.  All and all Conar was a superstar, kept his friendly character even after we sent the food back. And he was nice enough to help me choose a wine. The restaurant unfortunately needs to do something about their food. The items on the menu seem great until you actually receive them. A bit deceiving and allot disappointing. Yes I have horrible grammar but I will not be going back to eat there unless I am told that the food has been altered to actually match the description."}
{"text":"Went to this beautiful restaurant (first time for me, my partner had been before several times for business meetings), and it did not disappoint. Fantastic Summerlicious menu for a good value ($45 per person for three courses).  Our waiter and all others servicing the table were attentive and friendly. Loved that they asked us upon sitting, \"Would you like some water? Bottled, or Toronto's finest?\"  Ambience was gorgeous (we sat in the room that had the beach cottage flair, but the other all-white room also looked beautiful). The view, once we came up the quaint freight elevator, was equally gorgeous.  Would definitely come back again and recommend to others. Bravo! This is what a good dining experience should be."}
{"text":"My husband and I went there for our 10th anniversary, at first we thought we were at the wrong place because we went to into a pub space that was full of people just having a drink after a long day. But the hostess greeted us quickly and we were whisked up into a secret elevator (that looked like it was taking us to a speak easy!) and it opened it's door to the top floor of an old victorian building, which was decorated tastefully in off whites and candle lit. The staff were attentive and nice, and the meal...well it was just out of this world. I had a very large crab cake, and my husband had a shrimp cocktail which was amazing...the prawns were barbecued to perfection. The timing was perfect. My cocktail which was a Canadian Side car was delicious and heady, a perfect mix of sweet sour. My husband had a Cesar which wasn't on the menu but he said it was nice and spicy!  For our mains, I had Gnocchi which I always mispronounce for some bizarre reason, and my hubby had filet-minion. He swore his steak was melt in your mouth good, and the Gnocchi was home made and the sauce was amazing.   For dessert, I had the banana sticky cake that came with a mini ice cream sandwich, which I thought was lovely. I would have been happy with the ice cream sandwich...it was wonderful..the sticky cake was tasty too but by then I was very full.   They also had wine tasting which was cool...several bottles were put out and people could try different wines."}
{"text":"It was our fourth wedding anniversary on Jan. 30/14 and we thought it would be a good time to try the Fifth Grill. We thought it would be fun to start out at the Fifth Pub downstairs, where Brendt Diabo was playing a solo set for the after work crowd. His music was an excellent accompaniment to the vibe of the pub. The service there was really good and so were the drinks. I think Brendt plays 6-8 pm on Thursdays, so try to go see him!   Then we went upstairs via the super cool freight elevator. You have to watch the walls of the elevator shaft...lots of surprises stashed in there. We were warmly welcomed and our coats were stashed. We had a beautiful table for two. The room was a little dark, but it was cozy and beautifully appointed. Our server was fantastic...very friendly and knowledgable. I had the lobster (served out of shell) and my husband had the steak which would have been perfect if he didn't request it to be cooked medium-well (will he ever learn?). We didn't have starters, even though there were some on the menu that were incredibly tempting. I'm glad I skipped right to dinner, after having a whole lobster and sharing two sides (truffle mashed and bacon brussel sprouts) we were almost too full to move. My lobster was served with green beans which were perfectly al dente. I swear...I felt a little depression when I dipped my last morsel of lobster into the drawn butter. But I knew it had to come to an end at some point.  We finished our wine and headed back downstairs for a nightcap before heading home. All in all, the Fifth Grill and Pub downstairs provide an entire night of entertainment and great food and drinks. I would do this again and take friends.  I would also like to have a more casual night with friends after work on a Thursday to catch Brendt Diabo's set and have some $5 drinks and food at the pub. Check it out...the ambiance and the service is great!  Cons: The only reason I didn't give five stars is because I had to go through a sea of partiers at an event to get to the elevator and then had to wait by an ice machine for several minutes before the elevator arrived. The restaurant was a little too warm. There wasn't much by way of music in there...if there was I couldn't hear it. My lobster was just a wee overcooked. And the bacon brussel sprouts were a little on the dry side.  Overall a great experience though!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for summerlicious and it was delicious! My favourite was the filet (drools just thinking about it). Medium rare exactly. The macaroni for dessert was also just heavenly."}
{"text":"incredibly expensive for a sketchy looking patio covered with plastic"}
{"text":"Some friends brought me to The Fifth & Terrace for my birthday and to say I was blown away was an understatement. I love that it is tucked away in the middle of downtown Toronto. The ride in the old elevator up to the terrace was an experience.   Let me start by saying that the service was impeccable. Andre was fantastic. He explained everything on the menu in detail and was extremely friendly. He even took the time to explain to us where the different cheeses on the cheese platter come from and how they are made.   We ordered a bottle of the German Riesling and it was phenomenal. Andre also took the time to explain what region the wine comes from and what type of grapes are used. I went out the next day and bought 4 bottles from the LCBO. It has become my new favourite!  My friend's and I ordered the beef carpaccio. Loved that it was paired with figs, riccota and pine nuts. It was so yummy! We also got the charcuterie board. I wasn't a huge fan of the chicken on the board, but everything else was fantastic. The cheese is what really made it. Excellent selection and full of flavour.  For dinner we all had the filet mignon cooked medium rare. It was the best steak I have ever had. It was ridiculously tender and cooked to absolute perfection. It melted in your mouth. The bordelaise sauce was amazing as well.   We chose three different sides and shared. The parmesan gnocchi was out of this world. Words cannot describe how amazing it is. It melts in your mouth and is so full of flavour. The sauce that is on it is perfect. We were all wishing there was more after it was gone. The truffled 5th frites were also delicious. They came with mayonnaise and ketchup for dipping. We suspect both were homemade as the taste was far superior to any store bought condiments I have had. Last but not least were the forest mushrooms which were delectable. They were cooked just right and were the perfect pairing with the steak.   For dessert we ordered everything on the menu. It was all amazing. Every single one of them. The table favourite was the raspberry gelato though. It tasted like you had just put a whole, fresh raspberry in your mouth. Out of this world! The runner up was the lemon tart. So fresh and the perfect amount of tartness.   Overall the entire evening was phenomenal from the atmosphere to the food to the service. Everything was perfect and we were treated like royalty by Andre. It was lovely to be treated to such a fantastic evening out on my birthday. We will be returning for special occasions."}
{"text":"Nice comfortable place for a group or a date. I liked that the lighting was more dim, made the atmosphere more rustic and cosy. The appetizer and entree were pretty good. I had the fennel shrimp salad which was really good. Very flavourful overall although I do wish there was more shrimp in there. Seemed very sparse. The steak I had was cooked perfect medium rare with an herb and citrus compound butter. The dessert I had was hazelnut ice cream with a pear cake and some shaved chocolate. Sounds good but I wasn't too impressed with that. Not much flavour in the cake and overall just a mediocre dessert. The amount of ice cream they gave was the smallest little scoop, like a teaspoon scoop. The wine selection is also really great and tasty. The staff were really friendly and made good recommendations for the menu. Overall I wouldn't mind coming back here, but at the same time I think the food is just good. I think the atmosphere was one of the best parts. I would like to come back to try more of their menu because they do have a good variety of things to choose from and they are complex dishes with a lot of components to them. Interesting to try."}
{"text":"So I came here as a treat from my boyfriend's parents for both his graduation and my birthday. We had reservations and were the first ones inside. The entrance was hard to find but also kind of fun in an adventurous sense.   The elevator was amazing. Slow. But amazing. I really wanted to sit on that chair haha. And if you look, on the beams people have placed little nick-nacks. The employee manning the elevator was also very charming and friendly. He dispelled any initial awkwardness and we had a good chat. Jokes were made and everything was off to a good start.  Now, I don't usually go to such fancy restaurants, so I was pleasantly surprised at how nice the staff were. Everyone was smiling, greeted us individually, and overall made me feel like royalty.   I remember I had the lobster risotto and it was divine. Granted it was my first risotto, but the rest of the table had a taste and they agreed it was delicious. In fact, everything was cooked to perfection. The wait wasn't long, but then again we were first and only one or two other tables had arrived by the time we got our apps.  We were seated next to a window so we had a nice view. Also, I must mention say, the bathrooms were beautiful. I mean, restaurants usually have shoddy or just eh-average bathrooms but damn everything was so clean and pretty. You had actual towels instead of paper.  You can tell how much effort went into the design, execution, and service. If I were rich I'd be coming every week, at least.  Interior: 10/10 Staff: 10/10 Food: 10/10"}
{"text":"Came here with a big group and ordered from a selected group menu. I loved the big table in the Terrance. Its wide enough that you can hear everybody. (vs you can only talk to people sitting next to you if it's a regular narrow long table). Also there is a nice view of the  CN tower from the table.   The service was very professional: five star. The appetizers and entrees were all decent and delicious: four star. However the desserts were disappointing. The baked Alaska was big but flavorless. The dessert trio was just okay.  Overall I still recommend this place for groups."}
{"text":"Beautiful place, especially the patio (very cozy) did not know there was a restaurant up here but I'm glad I found out. The elevator to upstairs is escorted by a very nice men, who sometimes does magic tricks, and you can leave him a tip and pick-up a bag of cookies (very cute)  the food is very good, and there wasn't anything I would complain about. I would come back again.  If you come on a weekend (fri/sat?) and want to party after dinner, someone can help you arrange with bottle services at the club downstairs (win/win)"}
{"text":"One of the most enchanting dinners I have ever had, so glad we decided on this restaurant for our special dinner. We had to alter our reservations last minute but this didn't seem to cause any changes in the great service.   We walked here easily from our hotel, and had a bit of trouble locating the entrance to the restaurant. We asked the man at the side alleyway and he welcomed us and checked our reservation. We walked in and was led to the area to where we would take the elevator up (it was an old school elevator). Upon arrival we were seated at the bar on the terrace (which was decorated with a hint of rustic/vintage with nice pretty lights), to wait for our table. We ended up getting seated in the most unique/romantic table or rather...booth. It had it's own little door and was so private. Our server was very attentive and got our orders in promptly. We both decided to get the prix fixe Summerlicious menu, as well as side of fries and a drink to share. We were pleasantly surprised at the amuse bouche, which was a lovely savoury pastry cookie with olive filling. We also got a bread basket that came with a delicious black bean spread. For our appetizers we ordered the duck breast carpaccio, and the crispy calamari. Both were delicious. For our mains we ordered the beef tenderloin, the pickeral along with our side of fries. The pickeral was thick and flaky. The beef tenderloin was perfectly cooked and succulent. Everything was well seasoned and not overly salty which was good for my palate. Throughout the evening, our waters were always refilled and dishes/utensils cleared away after each course. For our desserts we ordered the chocolate terrine, and the grand marnier souffle. The chocolate terrine was very rich and filling. The souffle was actually a frozen souffle, which bummed me out a bit because I was really excited to try an actual souffle unknowing that it was frozen-very mouse like ice cream. The grand marnier was very prominent which was good to know that it was not cheaped out on.  I loved my experience here, I could not have asked for a better evening. The staff and the service was just effortless they know how to treat their customers (first impressions are very important). I hope to come back and experience more of this restaurant. 2 Thumbs way up!"}
{"text":"Ladies and Gentlemen, get your wallets ready!  If you're looking for an intimate evening out in Toronto, perhaps a romantic evening or a special occasion, and have some money to throw around, I'd say 5th Grill is a nice experience. If you're counting your pennies, I'd say maybe move on...  We went because my friend was singing there for their Jazz night, Sophie Berkal-Sarbit, check her out!  And it was a lovely evening.  I don't usually go out for steak as I have some great butchers around me and can easily make steak at home. In fact I'm usually pretty skeptical about dropping $40 for a steak anywhere because of this.  But if you're looking for a nice dining experience I think the 5th Grill is a real treat.  You take an old wood elevator up to the dinning area. The setting is intimate and comfortable. The chairs are plush, the space is small, the lighting is soft.  You order the meat individually but they have a wide selection of shared sides which I love.  I like that although they are expensive, they don't try to take advantage like some places do. You pay for your meat and you can taste the quality.   They let you order the sides separately to share which is a nice experience. I love sharing food because you can try more food. And although I ordered their fixed menu, the table beside us ordered a large selection of sides and they all looked delicous... I was envious...   I also ordered sparkling water and it was $6 and they refilled it all night, unlike some places that try to gouge you on these little things.  If you just want a good steak, I can definitely recommend some good butchers but if you want a nice dinning experience, I had a wonderful time at the 5th Grill.   The food was good, and the entire experience felt like a treat and definitely a more intimate and comfortable experience then a lot of the trendy high end restaurants in Toronto."}
{"text":"Was here for a corporate reception... the samplers were delicious and the service was friendly. The place is well kept as well, nice decor..."}
{"text":"Ms. Brooks Brothers and I came here for a 1,000 point Open Table night. Friday 7 pm seating. Keep an eye open for such future promos! Really outstanding food and dining experience.   You start with this Disney Haunted Mansion elevator ride to the top floor (5th floor hence the name). A totally old school elevator attendant takes you up and down. It's a slow ride and he has a deck of cards to occupy you with some card magic.   You get a nice little raisin and candied nut bowl at your table. And then a quick appetizer featuring some tapenade on toast. A great basket of bread follows with a variety of breads, and they will top up if you clear though it. I had the excellent flat iron steak and fries.   The interior is pretty nice, kind of old warehouse atmosphere with some whimsical touches like a parrot cage. There's a rooftop deck for dining for extra atmosphere.   This is elegant dining with a commensurate price. However, portion sizes are great. So many fine dining places want to charge you a crap ton of money and leave you hungry."}
{"text":"A friend had been here for Summerlicious and said she enjoyed it, so thought I'd try it out with my boyfriend.    I give this place two stars because I love the freight elevator that takes you upstairs.  I also liked sitting on the terrace which would have been nice in the warmer weather.  Big props on the lobster mashed potatoes too.  Expensive, but soooooo good.  Stars were removed because the service was unbelievably slow.  A couple were seated after us had their order taken and were served before us - and it certainly was due to us still looking at the menu.  Another waiter ended up taking our order because they noticed we had finished half our bottle of wine and our menus were still sitting closed on the table.  Thank goodness we didn't have to be somewhere else afterward because that dinner took a lot longer than planned.  As mentioned above, the lobster mash was to die for, but that was the only thing on my plate that was to die for.  My boyfriend and I each ordered the rib eye.  For the price we paid, I was not impressed.  Particularly because they gave us the wrong steaks - even after asking us who had the medium vs the medium rare before setting down the plates.   I found the seating to be really tight as well.  I felt like I was on the third wheel on the first date sitting next to me.  I would have preferred a bit more privacy.  I would not recommend, nor would I go back to this place.  While I liked the lobster mash, it's not worth coming back here."}
{"text":"First time I'm that I was there the food and service was fantastic. Second time I was there the service was good and the food was good but there was a piece of the metal dish scrubby in one of the tart which gross me out who knows what was stuck on the piece of metal."}
{"text":"I had such a lovely evening here. I can't believe it's been so long.   Everything was perfect. From the friendly hostess that greeted us as we arrived on the 5th floor to the attentive staff who looked after our every need to the amazingly talented chef and kitchen staff to put together beautifully plated and delicious meals. Wow!   The terrace is so beautiful. It's a peaceful place to watch the busy city below while you relax and sip a glass of wine. The music playing was not too loud but a good mix for the background that really added to the chill city vibe.    BEEF HANGER STEAK, TONGUE, TRUFFLE, FOIE GRAS, BOSCHETTO is what I had. The steak was a perfect medium rare just like I requested, The foie gras was heavenly. It was all put together with such flare. To see food as art is a pleasure to me.  Although we did share a dessert, I was more impressed with my dessert coffee. Delicious and decadent."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Come here most Friday's after work. Always a great time. Great staff and also very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Located above the night club easy on the fifth, is a classy, beautiful restaurant. Lovely staff and lovely interior. Every dish we ordered was spectacular and we just had a fantastic time. I went with my boyfriend and another friend for a casual dinner but it definitely is a location to spend a special night at. Would love to go back!"}
{"text":"I've gone to this spot with coworkers several times in the past several months due to its convenient location.  The service has definitely improved.  Food still needs refinement.  Burgers are ok.  Sandwiches are mediocre -- pulled pork tastes a bit wonky last time I tried it.  Could also stand to give a bit more fries as a side."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here and my god the food was without exaggeration the best meal we've ever had. Everything was multidimensional, perfectly cooked, and insanely delicious. The soufflé was better than sex--a high bar to top. The service was incredible. Instantly our favorite spot in Toronto."}
{"text":"This place is great for food and atmosphere; and middling to service.   The BF and I had one of those group buy coupons and was coming up fast on expiry date so we had to either use it or lose it.   So the Fifth Grill is only open 3 days a week (Thursday - Saturday) - I do recommend making reservations - but maybe request not to sit on the Terrace. The Terrace isn't bad and is very pretty and quiet - if you don't encounter the fire engines going out on a call you'll be ok. But hearing the sirens on the terrace can ruin the mood if you are looking to play a little bit of footsie with your date.   Arriving is pretty cool - as they escort you in via the Club entrance - and you go up in the freight elevator - i felt very VIPish upon arrival.  Food - I'll breakdown here.   Crabcake - was good, lots of crab; but we thought it was a touch too oily and there was suppose to some wasabi in there; we weren't able to taste it at all.   10 oz. flat iron steak with frites - the steak was cooked perfectly and the pepper sauce just peppery enough. The frites were overcooked and dry - even mayo and ketchup couldn't save these fries.   Truffled risotto - this was really good - I think I should have ordered this as a main; because I couldn't finish my steak and I think both of us wanted more of that risotto.   The Fifth sundae - perfect for sharing! The vanilla ice cream was just the right balance with the candied pecans adding the crunch texture - with the hot chocolate sauce on the side - we added about a quarter of it on the Sundae - and like I said perfect for sharing.   Service - was a little eh - wasn't bad - but I was expecting a little bit more. There was this gap between our food - were we couldn't find our server for some minor stuff - plus she had disappeared with the BFs cc when we got the bill and they had forgotten to apply the discount from the group buy coupon - for a long time that we had to send someone after her to check on it."}
{"text":"Food quality is good. Ambience is nice. Not a kid friendly place!! Service was mediocre for the cost of the food. It was kinda all over the place. Dessert was OK. My seared sirloin was OK. Everything was just OK. For the price I really expected much better. And u feel kind of trapped seeing as it is on the 2nd floor. You enter thru the lounge/nightclub and are escorted up an elevator. When we were leaving they suggested we leave thru the back entrance because we had a toddler with us. Thank goodness because u could hear how loud the music really was once u got outside the restaurant."}
{"text":"I went for the winterlicious dinner this past Saturday with my husband. The service was amazing. They took our jackets and escorted us from the moment we got into the restaurant all the way to our table. We loved the decor, the vintage man-operated elevator, and the romantic ambience - although it was just a bit too dim for us. Our cocktails were boozy but tasty. As for our dinner, we enjoyed it very much. I am a vegetarian and my entire meal was perfect. Will be back again!"}
{"text":"Came here for the 2015 Winterlicious, and the overall experience was alright.  The ambiance was really good and the environment was very interesting.  The old style elevator was a bit of a shock, and they sealed up the place pretty well.    However the food and service wasn't too good.    Food was \"OK\", but not worth the $45 price-tag for winterlicious.  The presentation was nice, but in terms of flavors -- i had better.  The best part was the main course (steak)    Service was not good.  The waiter dropped knives and forks beside us, and there were a few where dishes almost dropped onto our heads.  We even saw waiters drop breads onto the floor as they were talking by.  This could be caused by the inexperience waiters and/or busy Winterlicious dinner, but I still felt that i was not acceptable.  They also took our bread away and never gave us a new set (after asking if we wanted a new batch).  ----- OVERALL ----- Environment -- 5 stars Food -- 2.5 stars Service -- 1 star  I'll give this place a try again after the winterlicious season.  There seem to be a lot of good review about their patio experience.  I would like to give that a try."}
{"text":"I'm soooooo impressed with customer service, decore and food. Just WOW!!!! Amazing amazing amazing!!!!!"}
{"text":"2.5 stars for the food, 5 stars for the ambience.  That would average 3.75 stars, but I'll round it up to 4 for the elevator attendant who does magic tricks (after we tipped him).  This restaurant is good for date or a girl's night out:  you can dress up as fancy as you want but the atmosphere is fairly casual. The noise level is average and the tables are spaced out nicely so you can actually have a conversation without screaming at each other.  The decor has a beautiful white motif and the terrace has a beachy feel going on.  This may sound cliche, but I really did feel like I was at a getaway in the middle of the city.  The food that we ordered was off the Summerlicious menu.  For appetizers, we got the duo of duck and foie gras terrine as well as the house cured bacon and summer melon salad.  They were good if not somewhat standard for a place like this.  My boyfriend ordered a strip loin for his main course; he said it was a teensy-weensy bit overcooked but totally passable.  It came with a side of sweet potato mash which I would've liked better if it were more of a puree.  My own main, the lobster bouillabaisse, was somewhere problematic.  The chunks of lobster were more like scraps and the tiny cubes of potatoes were just a little sad.  The whole dish lacked effort and tasted like something out of a can.  However, we were able to end the meal on a high note because both our desserts, the panna cotta and the lemon cheesecake, were quite tasty.    I had two drinks with dinner, the lychee chilli martini and their cosmopolitan.  I definitely enjoyed the latter more than the former.  The lychee chilli martini tasted like a watery version of the \"master cleanse\" concoction (which is a mix of water, maple syrup, lemon juice, and cayenne pepper) -- it's a diet thing that my friends and I tried out in high school.  So that brought back a lot of bad memories but I still finished it because I'm a trooper.  Then I got a cosmo and it was fine and dandy.  Even though I was not blown away by the food, I don't feel too discouraged.  I do appreciate them putting foie gras on the Summerlicious menu and I know that these menus are not entirely representative of what restaurants have to offer. I will definitely be back again before the summer ends."}
{"text":"The Summerlicious Menu is pretty nice, the taste is very good though, comparing to Ruth's. And the price is reasonable for the dishes and service."}
{"text":"We have been to The Fifth Grill & Terrace a couple times now.  The food and service is still excellent.  The ambience is nice and romantic. I indicated on the reservation that it was our 5th wedding anniversary. When we got there, they seated us in a private booth which was a nice touch. The staff was attentive and courteous. The restaurant doesn't get busy till after 7pm so if you're looking for a quiet meal, try to book for about 6pm. Of course we over ordered, we always do. The food was just as good the next day.  We would definitely go back."}
{"text":"nice place, good accompanying music, freshsalad, exact medium rare steak which is tasty. dessert is great. the service is great. certainly will come back"}
{"text":"The summerlicious menu was delightful. It was refreshing and well balanced. The portions were okay yet lacked plate presentation. The Fifth Grill and & Terrace never disappoints with a great outdoor space and good quality food."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here for our Valentine's day dinner. We each tried their Valentine's day 4 course set meal ($55 per person, or $85 with wine pairings). First course was the option between the Sweet Hearty soup, or a salmon gravlax. The sweet hearty soup was really good though! It was really rich in flavor. Essentially it was a creamy leek soup, topped with fried veggie tempura shreds which went really well with the soup adding a nice crunch. Second course was a Piquillo and egg pappardelle. Essentially it was a piquillo pepper stuffed with large flat pasta noodles inside, topped with some ricotta cheese and sliced chili peppers. This dish was quite interesting as I've never had anything like this before. Lacked a bit of flavor in my opinion and really relied on the chili pepper for the flavoring. Third course was either the filet of beef or the duo of salmon and scallop. The filet of beef was cooked standard medium rare, came with truffled mash and Chinese broccoli. The beef meat wasn't as tender as I expected it to be so that was slightly disappointing, and I wished they gave me an actual steak knife. The duo salmon and scallop actually tasted better than the beef in my opinion. I was a little disappointed that they only served one scallop, and the size was fairly small hidden under the salmon. The salmon was cooked just right though which was impressive and well-seasoned. One of the sides was really interesting. It looked like fries, but when you bite into it it's like a mashed potato texture, super soft and mushy - really tasty. Forth course was dessert, which we got one of each. Raspberry baked Alaska for two, and the chocolate fondant strawberry mouse. Both desserts were not much of my liking. Both desserts came with sorbet which was way too sour for a dessert in my opinion, and I don't mind sourness.   We also ordered a lobster risotto from their a la carte menu which was definitely no mistake! Lobster Risotto ($17 for appetizer size) This risotto was bomb! There was a lot of lobster meat, which I was surprised since it was just the appetizer size. Can't imagine how much more lobster meat the main size would have. The risotto was drenched in the sauce which tasted like lobster bisque. It might not be the best looking risotto, but it was really tasty!!  Overall my dining experience was great. I loved dining at the terrace, the atmosphere was great and felt very romantic. Service was great. Our waitress was really friendly, attentive and knowledgeable. One thing that slightly bugged me was one of the male server did not explain the dish to us as he plated it on the table; the thing is, the female server did, so for him to come with her but not explain the dish slightly irked me."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is great and food was also very good. Very nice to sit on the terrace. This could have been a five star experience, but the service messed things up....When they operate with prices at this level you expect impeccable service. Unfortunately it was bad for any standard. The 3-4 staff comming over to us throughout the night were clearly not in synch asking the same questions etc.. Took forever before someone finally asked (probably 15min!) if we wanted something to drink to start, think we waited more than 30min for the main course. When the mains finally arrived they and forgotten the side orders...rather than making a rush order it takes them additional 20min before they come with the sides, basically after the meal is over. Didn't look particularly busy either..."}
{"text":"This place is very, very good. It is romantic, lighted by candles, seating in sofas. Extensive wine list, delicious appetizers and good portions. Taste is good, better than what I was expecting. Fresh salad, fresh fish. Dessert list can improve. Great place to impress ladies. Highly recommended. Heavy price tag."}
{"text":"The restaurant is on the top floor. It is a really gorgeous loft. The environment is fantastic, but the food is mediocre. The steak is too old. Only the final banana cake make us a little excited. It does not deserve the price."}
{"text":"I came here for a special celebration. Our server was fantastic, and even gave me and my partner two glasses of champagne to start. I ordered the Sicilian inspired chef's menu with wine pairings. All the glasses of white were on point with their dishes. My partner ordered from their regular menu.   Now for the food:  1) Smoked Mackerel gravlax This was yummy, but the portion was rather small.  4/5  2) Half dozen oysters  Big and fresh!!  5/5   3) Octopus The octopus was cooked perfectly. Though the veggies didn't complement the octopus well, and I would've preferred a light salad as opposed to cooked veggies.  3/5   4) New York striploin and fries Steak was perfectly cooked and fries were addicting. I think they added a bit too much butter to the steak though. 4.5/5  5) Hazelnut semifreddo This was basically Nutella ice cream. Not bad, but not the best.  4/5   Overall, the service was great and we had a lovely time. I was kinda surprised to know that such a fine dining establishment existed just above the club. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant for my sister's birthday, along with her husband and my girlfriend.  In summary, the food was great, service was good, the coolness of the place was well, cool, and the pricing was reasonable although a little bit on the high end.  There is a bar/lounge along the main floor of The Fifth Grill.  When we arrived it had not yet been opened as a bar.  We were pointed toward this elevator, oldest elevator in Toronto, and were transported one floor up by a really friendly lift operator.    We were guided through this small area over towards a heated, covered patio, which must be really nice in the summer time.  Unfortunately, we were there in January.  We were seated promptly and given plenty of time to look at (or stare at) the menu and its amazing choices.    We ordered a Foie Gras slider which was delicious.  An in-house cured Gravlax salmon appetizer was also very tasty.  As expected, the portions were small but very flavourful.  As an entree three of us had the Quebec Venison and it was the second best cut of meat that I have ever had and not to mention its infusion with black currant tea and ligonberry juice, which made it very flavourful and rich.  The meat was cooked as the chef recommended, which came somewhere in between rare and medium rare.  This was definitely a treat and I would truly recommend it.  To pair this meat we ordered a Granache that was suggested by our waiter and that paired really well with the Venison.  The price of the entrees offered varied between roughly 29 dollars to $47 a plate and I am sure that all other things in the menu are equally as tasty.  The drinks are slightly more expensive with some drinks being around $15 each.    Overall this place was great and the atmosphere was nice.  It was not quiet like some other places where you feel like laughing is not allowed.  The staff was nice and friendly and the food was delicious.  Definitely a place to recommend to others.  We also had a good time at the two bars that are located on the main floor.  The place got really busy really quickly."}
{"text":"I went there with my family for our reunion dinner.  since we haven't meet each other so long, so we decided to go for something nicer.   Personally , I really think that as long as the food quality, service quality and decoration of the restaurant are fine , I wouldn't care that much oN the price.  However, we are waiting for the elevator for too long for no reason. Since there is a special staff taking care of the elevator.   there is no specific waiter for your table, which is fine in general restaurant, but for something at least 50 per person restaurant. There should be 1 specific waiter or waitress for your table, another 1 for servent the dishes. But it seems like they all just messed up and you do not know who to call when you want salt and pepper.    When it comes to order for drink, they seems a bit PUSHY ...  The same question of \" do you want to have sth. to drink ? \" come up at least 5 times during the dinner .  I don't know if I should take as they really want me spend money on the drink, or they just forgot if they had asked the question before or not.    At the most disappointed,   the food is kind COLD when it come on the table.  portion are small, the assorted food with the main meal are not well designed. nothing too special on the choice of food.   At the end ,  If you have that much of budget for a good dinner, Sassafraz or 5 Sense would be a much better choice ~"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night to celebrate my Anniversary. Very romantic, great ambiance, candle light, and a live jazz music, need I say more...  First off you must know that the entrance to this resto is on Duncan street not on Richmond st. Its on the side in an alley way. Definately make reservations. There is doorman outside, asks for your name, pages upstairs to see if your table is ready and then you go upstairs to where the fifth social club is which turns into a club at night.  An elevator boy takes up to the roof top lounge where the resto is. It the perfect start to an intimate night riding in an old wooden elevator. When you arrive up a hostess takes you to your seat. Dim lighting and fresh flowers and a beautiful view of the city.  The waiter a very bubbly lad brings us the wine list and cocktail menu. Great selections. We decide on a martini titled Lucky Lady or Loose Lucy. It was perfect! As well we ordered a bottle of sparkling spring water.  That night they offered a prix fixe menu so we decided to go with that. The waiter brings us a nice assortment of bread and butter while we wait.  For apps we selected the Grilled asparagus and Roasted Red Pepper soup. The asparagus was cold but meant to be served that way i guess they blanced it after cooking with a minced garlic sauce and Roasted Red pepper soup was simple clean but equally delicious.  For mains I always go for steak and lucky me they had filet mignon as part of the prix fixe. It came perfectly medium rare and juicy served with a very delicious peppercorn sauce. It also came with green beans and mash, simple sides and compliamented the meal very well.  For dessert in the prix fixe was either cheesecake or ice cream sundae. I hate cheese cake and didn't really care for a sundae. We asked the server if we could chose a different dessert and pay the difference although the menu clearly said no substitutions. To our surprise he brought us the dessert menu and let us make a substitution. We decided to go with the chocolate mousse cake as I am a natural chocolate lover. Boy was I glad he let us change because this cake was soo moutherwateringly delicious!!!  Overall everything about this restaurant was outstanding and top notch. Great service, ambiance, and delectable food. I would definately recommend this restaurant for those seeking a gourmet romantic evening out."}
