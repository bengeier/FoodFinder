{"text":"The food is decent here, but they always seem to be overwhelmed, whether there's 2 people or 20 in the place.    We came for Father's Day and they didn't write down our reservation. We had to wrangle our own table. After ordering, 2 waitresses came by to tell us it would be 20 minutes for food. It's been an hour now."}
{"text":"I've been going here for years, well before it became the Station.  I've never had anything that wasn't good.  My favorite dishes by far are the meatless burger and the veggie wrap both with goat cheese.  The sweet potato fries and the BLT sandwiches are also worth doing.  Yum.  Getting so hungry just thinking about my next visit.  Kudos to the new owner/chef and all of his creations.  Such an asset to the area."}
{"text":"Totally disappointed. Had a Groupon so decided to give it a try. We ordered the rib and wing combination. The wings were average. The ribs were tough and hard. Definitely not fall off the bone as they advertised. Also had the special prime rib and although it was their specialty it was tough and not very tasty. The vegetables were nicely cooked and well presented. We were not told there was an upcharge for 3 of our sides so were surprised when the bill arrived with an extra tacked on . The waitress appeared to get very upset when we questioned the bill and her attitude was a little unpleasant. We were both not happy with the way our complaints were handled."}
{"text":"Have been there at least 6-7 times over couple years. I gave 2 star rating for sake of previous experiences. This place had always moderate food and service. But after my last experience, i wont be going there again. They dont seem like care about the customers anymore. If they did, they would do something to cover the mistakes thay have done. Just saying sorry wont help much if you are not my mom cooking free for me."}
{"text":"Good news guys The O'CONNOR Station open back for dinner agin from November 14/2016..."}
{"text":"I brought three elderly relatives here today for their turkey special.  The food was real--real homemade soup, real mashed taters, real turkey--and as good as anything we ever made at home.  Best of all, however, were the pleasant, patient and helpful servers.  We were truly made to feel like guests.  There are not a lot of happy neighbourhood spots like this left in Toronto and we'll be back."}
{"text":"The recent change in ownership turned a nice restaurant into lousy restaurant.  Tikka Masala  was little rubbery strips of chicken in luke warm gravy. Server claimed she had 15 years experience as a server, bartender and manager but could not recognize a can of Guinness by sight. Naan bread was stale. Service was worse than the curry.  Manager gave me a 10% discount. I don't think I'll ever go back."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch the other day  Pros  Fairly priced for the most part Good service  Staff was friendly  Food tasted great  Cons Nothing really, the could use some more TV's (if you're going there to watch some games at night)."}
{"text":"My family and I eat breakfast here on a regular basis. They do breakfast really well. We've had the omelettes and waffles, etc but I don't know why we ever stray from the \"special\". 3 eggs, meat (lots of - if you go with bacon it's 6 pieces) potatoes, toast (including rye) and bottomless tea or coffee. The coffee's good too!  The special has gone up in price over the years but is still under $6 (maybe $5.75?). An excellent value.   Our kids always get the pancakes and barely eat one each, meaning they both take 2 home to eat later in the week.   The staff are courteous and efficient and willing to accommodate.   This place is great for young kids. They have colouring, toys, high chairs and a full kids menu.   We had a group of 18 there a few years ago with 12 of the 18 being kids under 4. We made a reservation (more of a heads-up we were coming) for 8:00am (when they open) and it was a huge hit.   When the by changed the name from \"Sammy's\" to \"O'Connor Station\" they also changed some of the front of the restaurant to make it more of a bar. They are trying to attract a night crowd. (Same staff, so I'm assuming same owners). This does not appear to be working. A - The Wally down the street seems to own the night time crowd in the area and B - some friend were there watching a hockey game one night, and they were the only ones there so the manager was trying to persuade them to leave in the 2nd period.   My personal and regular experience is for breakfast and I think it deserves 4 stars. We are total regulars.   Great value Awesome food Good for families or not"}
{"text":"The breakfast here is usually decent, pretty hard to screw up eggs.  For some reason I decided to try their burger and fries and it was a disaster.  This burger had way too much garlic and garlic powder in it, I don't know why anyone would want this flavour in a burger it overpowers everything and rendered this inedible.  Somehow the fries topped that awful burger as they were basically black.  Yes black.  Who knows when the last time is they changed their oil.  I imagine the kitchen is a disaster if they are too cheap to change oil.    I've eaten here any time I'm in the area and usually hungover but this last encounter was my last.  Egg smart down the street at  donlands is way better and serves cleaner looking food."}
{"text":"We organized a brunch for 18 people and the food AND service was stellar!  I would highly recommend for brunch or breakfast in East York."}
{"text":"For a quick and greasy brunch the price is right - but the food wasn't great, service wasn't great, and their hollandaise was creamy rather than buttery."}
{"text":"The service was average but the food was decent. We had to wait around 20 minutes for our food to arrive which normally I would accept but since the restaurant was dead I was expecting it to arrive faster. I had the Spanish omelette with home fries which was ok. My boyfriend got the grand slam which included eggs, bacon, toast, home fries and pancakes. The pancakes were delicious! We also had freshly squeezed orange juice which we both loved.   I probably won't be a regular customer but I'd come back sometime in the future."}
{"text":"I've been going to O'Connor Station, in all its incarnations, for years.  It hasn't changed much since its last makeover.  It's fine in terms of the old standards.  Club sandwiches, bacon and eggs, fish and chips (although the portions of the fish and chips have shrunk dramatically in the last year or so).  O'Connor Station is fine for breakfast and lunch.  But I'm giving it a terrible review because of a recent dinner.  The baked penne with sausage was good and the service was fine (which shouldn't have been difficult, given that the place was pretty much empty).  But it was Saturday, the big night of their \"prime rib special.\"  Sure, let's give it a try.  I have to say that the prime rib was one of the worst meals I've ever had.  It's for that meal alone that I'm giving only one star.  The meat was all but inedible.  At least half the prime rib portion was just fat and gristle.  Of the rest, the less than a quarter inch thick slice was tough and dry.  Absolutely garbage.  They even screwed up the mashed potatoes which were bone dry (no butter or gravy on the side of course).  I suspect the mashed potatoes were dehydrated--straight from the box.  Honestly, shame on the management and staff of O'Connor Station for serving such rubbish.  They should take the \"prime\" rib off the menu and apologize to every customer that's ever had the misfortune to order it.  Deplorable."}
{"text":"The food is usually ok but never consistent which is not great.   Made a reservation for Father's Day and the older lady who took my reservation didn't record it so we were left to cobble together our own seats. Took over an hour and a half for our meals, which were eggs and one wrap. The poached eggs were not drained of water so when cut open it all poured into the toast which was pretty disgusting. The wrap was sopping wet with oil and balsamic.   We did complain and the owner was very apologetic and discounted our bill and gave us a complementary fruit plate. The other wait staff, other than the older Greek lady who took our reservation who was completely frazzled all the time, were wonderful and very friendly. It wasn't their fault for the experience.   Overall disappointed."}
{"text":"I think steak benedict is about the greatest thing I've ever eaten. O'Connor Station has a huge menu and is quite reasonably priced. I came to meet a friend who lives in the area based on a recommendation from my sister, and it was definitely a good choice. Great food for a good price, friendly service, pretty simple and straightforward really."}
{"text":"We order from O'Connor Station through Just-Eat on a pretty constant basis. The food is always good and comes when promised.  We tend to order the pastas here -- I am a fan of the Carbonara and my hubby loves the Seafood Linguine.  Fantastic for when you come home after a hard day and want someone else to do the cooking!"}
{"text":"It was great for breakfast. Our server was really cute and nice. Awesome omelette and great potatoes!"}
{"text":"I've come here a couple of times for breakfast with my mother-in-law.  Service: staff has always been friendly, but they seem to get overwhelmed easily with a high volume of customers.  I've definitely been to busier places with a calm and collected wait staff.  Food:  food was always good.  Not \"the best ever\", but I was happy with it for the price I paid.  They also had nice portion sizes.  We always left full.  Restaurant: entrance is difficult if you have a stroller or wheel chair.  It looks clean every time I've went.  Narrow stairs to go down to get to the bathroom.  Bathroom was clean but just looked old.  Also, no changing table."}
{"text":"I always come here for the breakfast.  Today I had Lobster Benedict, it was incredible!  Always good service, good food and fair price.  I haven't been for lunch or dinner, but I would definitely recommend it for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Visiting Toronto and we purchased a Groupon for the O'Connor station before we came. We were absolutely delighted with both our food and the experience.   I had the steak and shrimp (photo posted above) and the presentation of the plate was beautiful. And let me tell you, it tasted as good as it looked. Shrimp were juicy and the steak was tender.  My kids had pasta dishes that they also loved. I would also add that they are kid friendly.   Whenever we get an opportunity to go back to Toronto this restaurant will definitely be one of our first stops."}
