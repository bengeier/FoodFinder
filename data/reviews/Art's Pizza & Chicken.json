{"text":"Best pizza in Stow!

I try to go to a different place every time I want pizza, but Art's is my go-to when no other pizza will do.  I always get extra cheese and the pizza is nice and thick. The sauce is not sweet (I don't have a preference but some people do). 

Family-run and everything is made fresh. This is the pizza we have when we want to treat ourselves or have company."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. The owners are very personable and they always have a great deal! Definitely my favorite pizza place in all of Stow and I always look forward to their food when I'm home on break from school.

If you like pizza, this is definitely the place to go."}
{"text":"Below average pizza in a seedy shopping center. I was hoping this would have been one of those great hole in the wall pizza parlors, but I was highly dissapointed. I'd honestly rather have chain pizza."}
{"text":"Had an opportunity to stop in at Art's Place. I had an Entertainment Book coupon for $5.00 off a large pizza so I decided to use it before it expired. Normally I buy medium 12-inch pepperoni pizzas to review so they are all on equal footing, but I have a hard time turning down a deal, so ... .

Art's place is located in one of many look-alike plazas on Graham Road in Stow. I nearly drove past it as everything else was closed when I was looking for it. But there it was, situated in the dark corner of the plaza, just a narrow space easy to overlook. I saw a small OPEN sign in the window and movement inside, so stopped to order. Normally a large one-item pizza costs $13.25 but I with a $5.00 off coupon I paid only $8.25. Actually, a very nice deal.

Now I need to say that when I stopped in I was just happening to be driving by and it was a spur of the moment decision. I decided to wait onsite while the pizza was being made. The man-behind-the-counter said he'd try to hurry so as to get me on my way. I mention this for a reason.

The pizza measured from 14 3/8 to 14 5/8 inches across. The edge crust was 3/4 of an inch. And it was covered with 34 slices of pepperoni. Pizza was very good. I enjoyed pretty much all aspects of it. The one drawback was it was, in my opinion, slightly underdone. When removed from the oven the cheese was just starting to bubble but not yet browning, the pepperoni could have been baked a tad more to crisp them up. I know it was removed once it passed the official \"done\" test, but I would have preferred it to have been left in the oven just a minute or two longer. Well, the guy was trying to do me a favor, so I won't hold it against them.

The leftovers were even better the next day."}
{"text":"I've been ordering pizza from Art's for close to 20 years now. It's by far my favorite pizza in Stow. The homemade dough has great flavor and texture--something that's definitely not easy to find in this area. The sauce is nice and simple, in a good way. The owners are wonderful, hardworking people. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Great pizza with larger portions than most pizza places. The owners are extremely kind too. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"So, I played in a golf outing they catered and they had the best chicken. Thought it was fried, but is actually roasted. It's impossible to find a menu so posted the one they gave me. Noticed it didn't have prices so will take a picture of the one inside next time. 

We ordered the 8 piece chicken with 1lb of jojos for only $10. Didn't get pizza and don't know if I will since the chicken is just that good!  It takes 45 mins, but is so crispy and has the best flavor. You have to try it!"}
{"text":"I've never had a bad pizza here. I find the prices very  reasonable.  You don't stay in a business over 20 some years producing a poor quality product. I just want to say I seen a review on chicken being greasy.  It's always been ( how to say this) normal expected grease sense it is deep fried in boiling hot grease. Not saying they didn't experience this. Just saying fried chicken will have grease."}
{"text":"When my family comes to visit, I usually get them Art's Pizza. Art's is a family-owned business that I have been ordering from for 15 years+. I do wish they'd go back to having the buy one, get one deal they used to have though."}
{"text":"Arts pizza is always very good. The ingredients seem fresh and tasty. I've never had the chicken there so I can't comment on that. Great people who work there as well. Very kind and they are family owned so I do like supporting them."}
{"text":"I've never had anything but their pizza, but I think it's underrated. This place is an unknown gem. It's one of my favorite pizza slices in the area. Good ingredients, a buttery thick crust. It's always incredibly cheap too. Around $11 for a large. 

No seating or anything, just a small space for pickup."}
{"text":"Terrible pizza, terrible prices, laughable service.

They keep their pizza \"hot\" in what is known in the industry as a hot bag, usually reserved for delivery drivers. Not so here, as he uses them exclusively for keeping his \"done\" pizzas hot for pick up. Done is in quotation marks because the pizza was incredibly doughy, and was nowhere near hot. My girlfriend's large pizza was the same, doughy and not hot.

Prices were fairly outrageous, too. If you're in the area of Fishcreek and Graham sometime and want a good laugh, stop in to that little hole in the wall pizzeria near the Wing Warehouse and ask for a menu. The prices alone ought to steer you clear of this hole, if this review doesn't. But please heed my advice... steer well clear of this craptastic hole."}
