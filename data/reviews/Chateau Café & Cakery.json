{"text":"Came in for the first time today, and was immediately greeted and welcomed by very nice people. The food selection was wonderful and the quality of the food was superb. If you are a fan of breakfast sandwiches like myself, then you must stop in and try one of there all-day breakfast sandwhiches. There's a man named Jason who made the experience exceptional with his personality and prompt and helpful service. I will absolutely return."}
{"text":"I like this place. The people are nice. The food is tasty. My only complaint is that the sandwiches are very small. You pay $8 for a very small portion. Anywhere else, you pay $8 and you are full after you eat. Here, I'm still hungry. I would recommend that they give people more for their money when it comes to the sandwiches."}
{"text":"I grew up making myself cheese and pickle sandwiches. Somehow, I just discovered that I liked them, no one ever turned me on to them and my family thought they were weird. They'd say \"Don't you want some meat on there?\" Meat just ruins the salty, vinegary, crunchy, cheesy-goeyness of the cheese and pickle combo. Today, for the first time in my adult life...I found a restaurant that has them on the menu. It was delicious, and frankly an improvement on my toasted white bread/white American/dill selections. They used whole wheat and cheddar and grilled them Panini style. Sweet jebus, that hit the spot.  I come to find out that cheese and pickle sandwiches are a 'quintessential British sandwich' How about that?"}
{"text":"Undeniably awesome. The beets and bacon salad is absolutely covered in both. The sandwiches are all perfectly melty and toasty (although a good size, the might be seen as small by Pittsburgh standards. The salads however are huge.)   Delicious ice coffee (they use Nicholas Coffee) and creative and delicious baked goods.  My only gripe? I wish they had some premade sandwiches or larger sides for quicker service. A salad sometimes takes up to 20 minutes during the busy lunch rush."}
{"text":"Not at all what was expected. The website leads you to believe bit is a gourmet bakery and breakfast place, when in reality it is a run of the mill mediocre sandwich shop."}
{"text":"I travel to Pittsburgh for business 5-6 times a year and pretty much eat my way through the city. Last trip, I grudgingly stayed on the north shore because most hotels were booked.  The Hotel breakfast was brutal and the Post Gazette led me to this little joint five minutes away. First impressions?  Hip, warm, and comfortable with a lot of smiling faces...not something usually seen down here in Florida. Second?  The breakfast bagel was freaking amazing. I see that has been said a few times. It's true. They don't screw around with the ingredients, instead letting them speak for themselves. Ham edges crispy. Big fluffy layers of whipped eggs. Excellent quality cheese.   Also, the coffee smelled so good tht I decided to veer from my norm and opted for a flavored blend. Delicious. As I sipped on Green Mountain at the office later that afternoon, I wish that I could have called in a delivery.   The next day, I worked from the hotel in the morning and then stopped by again to try lunch before heading to the office. Got a steak and cheese sandwich, chips, and some oatmeal moon pie cream cookie....which was staring me in the face and broke my will. Everything was just as good as the previous morning. And the value is amazing.   Finally, it's awesome to see owners and workers that so obviously care about their place, the community, and most of all their customers. Why wouldn't you want to support that?  These are the type of people that are needed in areas that are rebuilding or have potential. Cheers guys. I'll be back on every trip."}
{"text":"One of my favorite little lunch spots in Pittsburgh.  I recently have found myself unable to eat bacon due to the grease, but the way they cook it here, I am able to eat bacon once again!  The BLT wrap and potato soup are two of my favorite dishes, but the roasted beet salad is also amazing.  I've tried something new every time I've gone, and have yet to be disappointed.    As far as baked goods (my personal weakness), I love these cupcakes so much they were served at my wedding.  The snickerdoodle cupcake changed my life.  I love that they are all named after Pittsburgh spots, an endeavor after my own heart.  Overall, I love the atmosphere, friendly service and great food.  I always love to bring out-of-towners here so they can see a little of what PIttsburgh is about... truly great eats and friendly people."}
{"text":"Had a bad bagel experience. Posted a review and the owner emailed me an apology. THAT is awesome."}
{"text":"I loooove this place.  It's just a short walk from where I work and the food is always good, as is the coffee.  I think my favorite thing so far was a breakfast sandwich on an everything bagel with pepper jack cheese, egg and bacon.  The sandwich was huge and delicious.  The staff there is always so friendly.   Go support a great locally owned business!"}
{"text":"The breakfast sandwiches are okay but overpriced. The cookies, cakes and various sweets are all always gross. Like literally every time I've gotten one, its been gross. Cookies that are undercooked. Cupcakes that taste like shortening. I have gotten an iced coffee drink thingee from them and that was pretty good. Service is usually decent unless you get the one chick, who goes out of her way to be cold, distant and rude."}
{"text":"Best Breakfast in Pittsburgh!  I am not generally a fan of breakfast sandwiches/bagels/croissants, but I just had the most perfectly done bacon, egg and cheese bagelwich!  I wish I could do it justice in my description, but I'll just say the bacon was crisp, the eggs were perfect and the taste was delightful.  Oh, and the 2nd best part?  My bagelwich plus 2 diet coke cans was $5.51!!!  Where in the world can you find a bargain like that for breakfast without it tasting like river swill?  (That was rhetorical, good reader)  Sticking around for the Burger Special for Lunch whilst I type away on my laptop getting through a Friday \"office day\" of work."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I come here every single day- it's about a ten minute drive from our office in the North Side. It is such a great atmosphere & everyone is always SO nice. The man that is there everyday (I think he is an owner/manager) is probably one of the reasons why we come back every single day- he is so friendly, funny, & provides exceptional customer service. One day I walked into the cafe and he asked me \"if you know the song on the radio you get a free dessert\"- little things like that make you want to come back. They cold brew their iced coffee which tastes amazing & they always have vegetarian specials which is much appreciated. They have new desserts every single day & offer a huge variety of food. I would HIGHLY recommend this place."}
{"text":"I stopped in @ the Chateau due to good reviews on Yelp. Yes, the place is cute, but the journey to walk there from the only available parking left me freezing cold and hoping it was worth the effort to go there. The decor is nice, a relaxed coffee shop vibe with a large chalkboard menu that while \"cute\" is very hard to read, even with my 20/20 vision, due to so many options listed and crammed in one space. I ordered a drink (coconut chai latte) and paid & say down with a paper menu to help me decide. The drink was flavorless and made with just a tea bag, not a blended chai mix, as I had expected. I would never recommend ordering that. I added sugar and that didn't even help. On to the food-- They had a lot of sandwiches for breakfast or lunch but I wasn't too hungry, so I opted a cold salad with sweet potatoes. Just one bite in, and I knew it was old. It had to have been made sometime last week. I'm not one to complain, but I truly couldn't eat it. The girl behind the counter offered me a different salad, with quinoa & tomatoes, and it was much better! The girl working there brought over a chocolate cookie (which looked dry, but tasted great!-- I think it was flourless) and it was a nice gesture, that's why I'm giving Chateau 3 stars instead of 1 or 2."}
{"text":"I enjoy eating here when I am at work in this neighborhood, but I wouldn't seek it out unless I was close by.  Pretty nice people with creative ideas - and very allergy friendly.  I would go with the daily special - they seem to focus on that well.  Sometimes the other sandwiches seem like afterthoughts.  I really like that you can get fresh fruit as a side.    Local is always better than a chain... give this a try next time you think starbucks or panera"}
{"text":"This bakery is wayyy out of the way for me, but I make sure to make a stop there any time I am around North Side (basically twice a year when I go to the dentist). I have liked everything I have tried here from espresso to latte, and about 12 different types of pastries. In particular, I really like the 2 cookies with icing in the middle and the cannoli.   Oh and did I mention that the owner is super chill and easy going. I once talked to him for like 20 minutes about living in Brighton Heights.  Definitely worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Coffee shop/ cafe offering high quality coffee and teas. They always have fresh foods for lunch including sandwiches, soups, and salad. They pastries and baked goods are next level! They alway have a few gluten free baked goods daily, my favorite are the macaroons.  My only complaint is that food items in cooler that are couple days old sell for the same price as items make to order.  Other than that, Chateau is a reliable locally owned shop and also features a lotto machine if you are feeling like giving away more of your money :)"}
{"text":"Great food and customer service!! much needed in this area"}
{"text":"I love Chateau! Great atmosphere, super friendly staff and they make a mean latte! I'm particularly fond of their spicy hot chocolate latte. Their hamburgers are delicious as well. The only thing I'm not really down with is the big lottery machine. It's so out of place with the rest of the decor. Highly recommended coffee shop!"}
{"text":"This place is our new favorite lunch spot.  I work about a block away and the walk is a nice breather outside.  The food is good, the portions are hearty and the staff is always friendly.  They also cater for meetings and other events which our company takes advantage of quite often.  It is a little bit out of the way but stop in and give them a try."}
{"text":"Nice little lunch spot in the industrial park in Northside. Really awesome lattes with a ton of flavor options! The staff is super friendly."}
{"text":"This is one of the hidden gem of the north sideline sure, and it's across the street from work.  I'm a lucky boy!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Off the beaten path, but definitely worth the trip! They have everything from fresh local coffee, loose leaf tea, gourmet oatmeal and cupcakes, sandwiches. I really could go on and on!! It's  perfect for a great priced delicious lunch! It's also a block away from the river front trail, which is awesome when you crave a cupcake after a nice bike ride! ;)"}
{"text":"This is an awesome cafe making delicious food in a very strange location. I was on the North Side (not a familiar neighborhood to me) to pick up a package from the UPS hub on my way to work. I hadn't eaten breakfast or packed a lunch because I'm irresponsible like that, so I decided to find a place to stop and grab both. I am so glad this little place was just down the street in the middle of what seems like an industrial park. It's cute and calm inside and has a really welcoming vibe. I had one of the most delicious bagel sandwiches I've had in ages for breakfast, and picked up the bacon and beet salad for lunch. Fabulous! Candied pecans, delicious but not greasy bacon, tons of beets. Big portions too. I'm almost glad I don't live closer because this place could easily wipe out my spending money. I'll find an excuse to come back."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast on my honeymoon. It's a little hard to find parking but when you park by the river it's only about a five-minute walk. Great atmosphere, delicious food,  nice staff."}
{"text":"This might be the Best breakfast sandwich place in Pittsburgh, incredibly fresh ingredients, the bagels are fantastic, chewy flavorful soft just perfect. I got a sausage egg and cheese on everything bagel and a blew me away, felt like I was in NYC. It's so hard to find a really good bagel in Pittsburgh, nearly impossible.   Actually the whole atmosphere has a kind of ultra urban feel, in an industrial park with tons of heavy equipment this place is nooked away and really feels like a best kept secret. Really cool play.   Full coffee operation out front, tons of really good baked goods, the chocolate chip cookie was fantastic.  Them off and I had was also good, yes I sampled almost everything, I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of the food -had a power bar and coffee, both really, really good!  However the customer service SUCKED! I'll try once more to see if they can do better."}
{"text":"This place is an example of how things can go awry if expectations and experience are out of whack--and not in the right direction.  I visited for lunch today on a bike ride--I'd seen their signs on the path, so I looked them up on Yelp, and saw that most people seem to like them.  I also looked up their menu ahead of time, and saw that they offer soup in a bread bowl and macaroni and cheese--two of my favorite comfort foods with particular appeal at this time of year, when it's getting cooler.  According to their website, they're open on Sat. until noon, so I timed my ride so I could stop by.  Upon finding the place (which took some doing), I walked in and stood by the counter. There were several other customers, and one employee was busy getting their food, and the other (an owner/manager, I assume) was chatting with them (I assume they're regulars).  After several minutes, the owner/manager asked me if I'd been helped, and I told him I hadn't, so he asked me if I'd prefer to eat in or take out, and I told him I'd like to eat in.  He told me I could have a seat and the other employee would be right with me to take my order, so I picked a table and sat down.  The table had a menu at it labeled \"Saturday Menu\" that had the same selections listed as the website.  When the other employee came over after a couple of minutes, I asked her what soups they had.  She explained that they don't offer soups on Sat.  Unfazed, I asked her about getting a sandwich/side combo, and she told me that they don't offer sides on Sat., either.  She then proceeded to tell me that they only offer breakfast and lunch sandwiches on Sat.  (Umm, then why are sides, soup, etc. listed on the \"Saturday Menu?\")  I asked her if she had a recommendation, and she said that she liked all the sandwiches she'd tried.  I asked her what she thought of the muffaletta, and she said she hadn't tried it yet, but since I hadn't ever had one, I decided to order it.  The sandwich came out after a few minutes. According to Wikipedia, muffalettas are traditionally served cold, but can be heated--this one came as a panini.  I thought the flavor was decent, though, as I mentioned, I don't have a standard to judge by.  When I finished, my waitress came by and asked if I wanted anything else.  Since this place is known for their baked goods, I checked what was available, and a cinnamon roll muffin caught my eye, so I decided to get it.  Without asking if I'd like it boxed up for takeout, the owner/manager boxed it up, so I paid and left.  Upon arriving home, I heated the muffin briefly (as the owner/manager suggested) proceeded to eat it.  The first bite was stale and bland, and I couldn't taste any cinnamon.  Even the middle of the muffin contained very little cinnamon--the only saving grace was the cream cheese icing.  Since it was the last one, I'm guessing that the muffin had been sitting around since at least yesterday. As someone who's no stranger to eating several-day-old baked goods, this muffin didn't age well.  Overall, I'm sorry to say that this was a rather disappointing lunch, in light of the lack of selection and food quality.  I'm guessing that the food selection and quality--and possibly also the service--is much better during weekdays.  Unfortunately, I live and work (9-5) in Oakland, so it's impractical for me to visit during weekdays.  While I applaud the owners for opening the business in an out of the way location and for having some weekend hours, I'd advise them to be upfront about item availability on Sat.  If you're only going to serve sandwiches and breakfast items on Sat., then please make a Sat. menu that includes only these items and post it on the website and at the tables.  If you're going to bill yourself as a cakery, then please offer at least some fresh baked goods every day (including Sat.).  As for potential customers, while this place may be worth visiting on weekdays, I'd advise you to stay away on Sat. until the management makes some changes. 2.5 stars."}
{"text":"This is my second visit, once for breakfast and once for lunch. I love that everything is made here. This is a gem hidden in the Northside. It's also a great place to work in between meetings."}
{"text":"Almost don't want to share how awesome this place is, keep it to myself LOL. They always have a delicious brewed iced tea. Impeccable service with fresh delicious food - home baked treats and a very educated staff regarding Veganism! There's an aesthetically pleasing interior, and a fun Pittsburgh theme to order tickets. Each guest is assigned a Pittsburgh landmark or celebrity. I've gotten Pittsburgh Dad and Phipps Conservatory to name a few. . sandwiches wraps salads breakfast or lunch. Often some prepared things in the cooler for purchase, like couscous with chickpeas, basil and tomatoes. Diverse fruit cups with strawberries blueberries raspberries and grapes are pretty affordable! Only downside here is parking. Walking distance from several businesses and schools"}
{"text":"Placed an order for delivery through Grubhub- oatmeal with raspberries and bananas and a Greek sandwich. The oatmeal arrived with brown,mushy, old bananas and the almond milk separated and the lettuce on the sandwich had ice chips on it. Needless to say I'm still hungry, which has now escalated to hangry."}
{"text":"Hidden gem of the North Shore! I worked down here and this is the only place to eat in the area. It was a pleasant surprise how neat this place is. You can customize anything. The coffee is good. There are so many options for lattes and teas. The owner is funny and kind. They play good music. What I was most impressed with is the array of freshly baked delicious and unique desserts! This spread changes constantly and I want everything I struggle to not buy anything when I eye up the options through the glass while I'm checking out. They have great salads! Healthy options. Delicious wraps and sandwiches. Breakfast all day! Make your own oatmeal and omelettes. What a great little place, highly recommended."}
{"text":"Very nice, clean place with a cool vibe.  Lunch totaled $17.....FOR JUST MYSELF! That was a sandwich, small soup and coffee.   I would have expected WAY MORE out of the sandwich. The spicy beef stew was very good, as was the coffee.  5 stars for ambiance, vibe and being a local establishment (not a fan of chains).  0 stars for value. Sandwiches need kicked up 3 levels or the price needs lowered.   I will likely be back daily for coffee and that is it."}
{"text":"I went to the Yelp's Cafe Connections at Chateau and was very impressed.  This hidden gem in the 'Burgh neighborhood of Chateau had a bright and inviting decor.  The owners we very gracious hosts, providing a special experience. This is a very nice space to rent for a private function.   This sustainable cafe served a hyper delicious assortment of appetizers and desserts: Caprese skewers, Sweet & spicy bacon wrapped chicken bites, Mini Reuben, Brownies topped with cookie dough and 3 types of Cannoli.  I don't have any complaints about the food, I totally enjoyed every bite! I was afraid of  the cookie dough having a raw taste but it was the perfect pairing with the brownie, Rich and chocolatey, oh and the chocolate cannoli had the absolute level of sweetness! The breakfast blended coffee was wonderful with my sweets.  Thanks for enjoyable evening!   I want to give a shout out to Monica from Pop Craft for the fun watercolor craft!"}
{"text":"Cute coffee shop. I live on the North Side so this is close and I kinda like that it's off the beaten path."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. The parking sucks, but it's so cute and delicious! A great quick lunch addition to the Northside. The menu has some unique stuff, but basic enough to not be overwhelming. I love that instead of giving you a number to wait on your order, they give you a Pittsburgh icon and yell it out when your order is ready. I got a super fresh fruit cup and a hot sandwich. My only complaint is the parking, but I'm guessing it caters to a lot of businesses in the area. I'll definitely be back to try breakfast!"}
{"text":"This is a favorite cafe of mine.  I toyed with 4 stars because of the parking situation, but lack-of-street-parking isn't their fault, so 5 stars prevail!  I have had lattes, regular coffee, and tea and it's all awesomesauce at this place.  The breakfast bagel with egg, ham, and cheese is great as a hangover cure a la my college days or a hearty meal that keeps you going all morning.  The baked goods I have yet to try (I was trying not to double-indulge when I was here, but Nutella Cupcake....zOMG, you will be mine!) though I can't image they are anything less than rockstar.  The selection changes daily, so check out their mouth-watering Instagram/Twitter/Facebook posts for what's available that day.  Let's talk atmosphere.  They have a couch with cupcake pillows - adorable. An industrial feel - perfect for the industrial background of the Chateau area of the North Side.  And plenty of open space.  The tables are a little high in relation to the chairs (it's possible I'm just a little short for the tables!) but even still I can happily and comfortably work here for hours.  I'm also digging the Pittsburgh-themed elements, from the names of the cookies to the \"name\" you get when you order.  Instead of giving you a boring number, they hand out cards with pictures of Mr. Rogers, the Duquesne Incline, etc and call that out when your order is ready; sometimes, they'll bring it right to your table if it's a little slow.  Which reminds me, the staff is so friendly and welcoming.  I take forever deciding which latte I want and the gentleman who is always there when I am is gracious and patient.  It's clear he loves the mission of the cafe, because he'll talk about that, the menu, and whatever else with ease and charm.  It's a hidden gem off the beaten path and I don't even feel the need to hide this wonderful place - everyone, come here, just don't park in my spot!"}
{"text":"Finally tried this place. Great accessibility to the trail along the Ohio River, however with their Monday through Friday, dayshift hours, not as many folks can take advantage of it.  That said, had a great breakfast burrito stuffed to the gills and a fresh coffee. When ordering, since the menu board didn't show tomatoes, etc. as an option I was offered mixed vegetables which I chose. The receipt then had a $1 extra charge for the vegetables. As a training item to the staff, if you offer items which are an extra charge you might mention that to the customer.  Nice quality cafe/bake shop!"}
{"text":"I would have never even found this place or even thought to come and enjoy a nice tea or sandwich if it wasn't for this YELP.  I loved that the owners were so involved with the community and have a real flair for food. I really enjoyed getting to know them and talking about food and the community at the event. They even said that sometimes they trade food or drinks for garden items. Someone just gave them some herbs in exchange for some food and they took the trade! What a great place that is interested in community not just profit.   Bites:  Caprese salad. This was presented on a skewer with alternating basil, tomato, and then cheese ball. The owners did say that the basil came from their own garden. That was a huge draw for me. If you can use ingredients from your own backyard then this place gets my vote! Capreses salad is simple and easy, and I loved the skewer version of it. I liked it and would get it again.   Bacon wrapped chicken bites. The jerk chicken spice was amazing. That paired with the bacon was drool worthy. I will say that some of the larger pieces of chicken were a little dry, but the other smaller pieces were yum-o. I loved that spice on the chicken!! Honestly, it was great. And the candied bacon...yummmmy. If it just had a tad more kick to it then I would have loved it even more, maybe some cayenne or something. I would get this again though.   Reuben sandwich. Okay, to be fair, reubens are some of my favorite foods. I love the taste of them and will almost ALWAYS choose them if I see them on the menu. These were good. I would say that the sauerkraut did not have the kick that I would usually like to see in a reuben, but these were good for sure. I do think that I would ask for more thousand island if I would order it again.   Desserts:  Cannoli. YES. Thank goodness for these. These were great. There were three flavors and each of them were better than the next. I will say that the filling was more of a cream cheese filling instead of the usual ricotta flavor. I think that it was good, but I would have liked ricotta instead of cream cheese. But the cannoli were mini's so it was a nice little snack.   Brownie. This was a bit much. I mean, I love brownies but this was too much for me to eat. I am not saying that it wasn't good, I am saying it was a lot of brownie for the size. This brownie was dense and filled with chocolate flavoring. AND THEN it was topped with cookie dough. OMG. Could you even ask for anything more than that. Brownie and cookie dough. I think it was wonderful and fun. But it was too much for me to eat. I had to take part of it home. It would not be my choice to get again, but if I shared it with someone then lets do it! Share a brownie and dig in.   I hope that everyone who reads this will go out and pay this business a visit. It was a great time with wonderful owners. The food was fresh and delicious and the drinks were refreshing and cold. Yum. Come visit, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I found out about this place when I saw that they won the North Side sandwich competition. This place is right off of the bike trails and is across the street from Graceland. The setting is neat - among some industrial buildings, close to the river. The selection is abundant and the folks working here are friendly.   I got an iced coffee (cold pressed, tasty, reasonably priced) and built a breakfast wrap. The wrap was fantastic. I will definitely come back.  I didn't try any of the baked goods but it looks like I was missing out."}
{"text":"The food and service upon pick up was good. It was my experience up to this I'm writing about.  I have never been. Ive never been to this part of the city in all honesty. I am down here now for temporary work at a near by facility for a few months. Part of my job is to find and order lunch for our \"office\". I had called this place A DAY before and asked #1. Was the online menu correct #2. Do you take larger orders? Roughly 10 people. Answers were yes and yes.  I called to order lunch the next day. I got a slight bit of attitude when I stated \"its a little bit of a larger order if you'll be patient with me.\" As I start to list off items (nothing off the menu. no changes or substitutions on anything.) to feed 11 people I start receiving more and more attitude with each item.   At one point I was told \"if you need to place a large order you need to call the night ahead.\" (this is nearly impossible bc in OUR office setting you can't get an order in a day before. Just how our place works.) However, I remained super nice and continued with the order. One of the last items was a breakfast sandwich (that came with scrambled eggs) and just asked for an extra side of scrambled eggs per a co workers request. The guy acted like I was an idiotic douchebag. \"Well thats going to have to cost you the entire price of a breakfast sandwich. This isn't a diner.\"  At this point the order was placed and I let the gentleman on the other side of the phone know \"Just so you know, sir. I called yesterday and asked if you'd take a lunch order for about 10 people and I was told it was no problem.\".... He snapped back with \"well that person obviously doesn't work in the kitchen.\"  First, I don't care. I don't care about your work drama and lack of kitchen help being able to handle 5 salads and 6 sandwiches. *sarcasm*  Secondly, I called the DAY BEFORE TO AVOID this issue and attitude and the staff dropped the ball. I, as a customer, should never have to receive the attitude and heat for placing a lunch order for our crew, especially when I CALLED THE DAY BEFORE to be clear on this issue.   Sadly, our crew will not be returning to have lunch. Its unfortunate that this establishment cannot handle a 'to-go' order for 10 people."}
{"text":"Last year when I attended Yelp's maker's and bakers holiday party for the entire community I was determined to check out each baker that participated and visit them myself. For some reason I forgot that this place was represented.  With the nightmare construction at the north end of the West End bridge it was a bit tricky finding this place but I managed. It sits right in the middle of an industrial community and believe me there are many places that warn you about no parking. My advice-if driving go off to the residential area and park there because sure enough they do tow!!  The place is small. They serve coffee, various teas, baked goods, breakfast, lunch, and frozen goods from a freezer. The prices are very reasonable-Breakfast seems to focus on oatmeal but they do have other offerings. Today's lunch special was pizza. I decided to go for a breakfast pastry rather than attempt to eat that gigantic slice of marble cake which you can get for just under $3.00 a slice.  So I settled for a cranberry orange scone which was the only scone they had left. The cookies look phenomenal but after learning they bake their own goods in house I went with the scone and a cup of small coffee. Cards are accepted since they use \"square\" as your receipt and of course they have take out.  I got my scone and coffee. It was good and very filling. The coffee was mediocre. I get the impression that this small eatery which is no longer open on Sats. which was noted on a previous review is for the people working in the various tenants of the community who want to grab an inexpensive breakfast, lunch or snack. Staff was friendly and helpful. There are places to sit if you want to avoid going outside and I like the way it is decked out.  This is probably not a place I'd go out of my way for again but definitely worth a visit. They are only open on weekdays until 4."}
{"text":"I've decided I need to open my own coffee shop. Only for the reason of making it the cutest, coziest place on earth. Until then, I strive to find one close to my perfect vision. Although Big Dog has my heart right now, I really enjoyed this place.  To say it's off the beaten path is an understatement. It is off the beaten path, between large warehouses and practically no real retail businesses. Parking was pretty tough and I was actually parked in by a large semi when I came out (RUDE!). So that was kinda a downer. But I get why you do this. You open a business in a place that you hope will build up around you.   I so so so wanted to try the \"cakery\" part of the place, but had to be good for a Biggest Loser diet competition (I know, boooring!). But those heart shaped conversation heart sugar cookies looked adorable! I didn't realize they'd offer a full lunch menu, but was happy to see a wide variety of not only sandwiches, but salads. I choose the cranberry, apple and walnut salad and it was perfect. Tons of fresh spring mix and the strawberry vinaigrette complemented. Great size as well.  I was also happy to see a variety of loose leaf teas and chai. I choose the house chai, which was great and spicy. I'm sorry, but if you're a cafe (coffee house, tea house, etc) you've gotta carry loose leaf these days.   Prices were extremely reasonable with everything I ordered coming in around $10. I do hope they do well, the staffer was very friendly and chatted with me about their hopes for the place and neighborhood. If you're around the area I urge you to check this out!"}
