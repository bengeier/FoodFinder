{"text":"This establishment is amazing. My favorites so far are potato pierogies, potato pancakes, mushroom pierogies with beet soup, stuffed cabbage, and poppy seed roll."}
{"text":"This is a truly delightful takeout place that serves fantastic, fresh Eastern European food. Unlike most delicious, affordable or ethnically diverse casual take out places you may see around the Cleveland area, Pierozhok is immaculately clean all of the time and impeccably decorated-very welcoming inside and out. The customer service is exceedingly congenial and warm, and may I point out they have been known to give freebies! Very interesting and culturally on-point seasonal specials, from the soups to the bakery to the crepes (my personal weakness). To have something like this pop up in North Royalton of all places is really a godsend (I challenge you to find something this yummy and individual within a five-mile radius). You'll be happy you made the trip, happier to be supporting a young local business, and happiest to engage in conversation with the always lovely ladies staffing!"}
{"text":"Fantastic little hole in the wall bakery next to a little bit creepy psychic reader shop.  There was a friendly little lady behind the counter who served us a variety of pierogies, chicken paprika, delicious potato pancakes and a less impressive pork cutlet.  cash only so be aware.  it was neat to see such a cool local place not far from our home.  We will be back to sample those delicious looking pastries.  Great value!  Oh yeah, The Wife loves stuffed cabbage and this was some of the best we've had!"}
{"text":"North Royalton has some quirky spots - and this one fits.  I have only had the pastries, but they had that delicate balance of just the right sweet and just the right butter taste (they probably had some flour too)."}
{"text":"love love love this place!!!  It's a family run, homemade, authentic Eastern European take out dive with great service and excellent food.  The menu is always changing as the owner makes everything fresh daily, so that's always a fun surprise.  I wish that they took credit card, but I understand why they don't.  Glad to stop by and get delicious food a support a local business any day.  North Royalton had better keep this place around for years to come."}
