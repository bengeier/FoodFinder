{"text":"I was not pleased with the pizza. I got a slice of sicilian that was under cooked and my boyfriends regular slice was over cooked. We also shared an order of garlic knots that we dry and stale.   We are big pizza fans and both agreed a tombstone pizza is better than this place. And a tombstone is a fraction of the price. If I were you I'd pass this place and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Don't care that it's overpriced because it's on the strip so that's expected. But this was the worst pizza I have had in my life, and I am not a critical person prone to giving one star reviews. I got a 'traditional' vegetarian pie. There was barely any cheese or tomato sauce on it. It was undercooked and doughy, bland, tasteless, and didn't even have enough salt on it. The crust was way too wide due to them not putting much tomato sauce or cheese on it. The vegetarian topping is diced green, yellow and red bell peppers and onions, which I knew beforehand, but which seemed to have put straight from a bag of frozen diced bell peppers and onions onto the pizza prior to underbaking it. Thankfully they gave us some little containers of dry Parmesan and crushed red pepper which helped make it at least edible. I never eat just one slice of pizza but one slice was more than enough. The four other people with me agreed that the pizza was bland and undercooked. We went here at 9 pm today which is not late for them as they were going to be open till 3 am or something according to their sign. I can't believe this restaurant has 3 1/2 stars on yelp. Maybe we just got one of the worst pizzas they have ever made and it was a fluke, but I'm never going back there to find out."}
{"text":"I've stayed at the NYNY casino a few times and have grabbed a quick slice here on more than one ocassion. Last time, we ordered an entire pie. It took about 20 minutes and was pretty greasy, but was exactly what we were looking for."}
{"text":"Hands down the tastiest pizza I've ever come across in vegas when have little time to eat.  Quick and easy and accepts mlife comps.  I have never walked into NYNY and not stopped here. You can't beat Sicilian Chicago-style Deep Dish."}
{"text":"Great pizza, and fast service. For the price, it is one of the best restaurants in New York hotel. Will be back in the future"}
{"text":"This is some of the best pizza I have had in my life. We ate it 2 times in a single day and I tried to go back the next morning, but they werent open yet. Its a huge slice for 5 bucks. How can you beat that?!"}
{"text":"Sirrico's is exactly what it is, and exactly not what it isn't.  I might have confused myself with that comment but let me elaborate... It was born in the New York, New York Casino \"streets\" area as a New York City style pizza place.  It is a solid New York City style pizza place in the middle of a casino in the middle of the desert.  It isn't perfect NYC pizza.  It is probably a bit more Sbarro's than it is strait from Italy, however, don't hate on the place because it isn't shipped in from Italy.   The prices are reasonable, not great by any means, but not heavily expensive.  Generally you can get a piece of pie and a beer for $5.  After spending $20/meal all up and down the strip, it is nice to get a cheap(er) meal.   It is \"street\" eating which means you will eat on the outside of the pizza shop, however by no means is it outdoors.   The pizza itself is good, but not strait from NYC by any means.  It is a nice place to sneak away for a bite for lunch to keep your day moving without having to dedicate 45 mins-1 hour for a meal.   I don't endorse this place a true NYC pizza place, but I do endorse it in having good pizza, at a reasonable price which serves a need for the Vegas tourist at some point during their trip."}
{"text":"The pizza was ok, nothing special. But even though pre-packaged I enjoyed their antipasto salad. It had lots of pickled peppers, meat and huge chunks of cheese."}
{"text":"This is the best place for pizza in Las Vegas.  Hands down.  I make sure to head there at least once while I am in Las Vegas.  The pizza is so good.  They must be putting cocaine in it or something.  The prices are a little high, but it's in a Las Vegas casino, not the dollar menu at McDonald's.  I highly recommend you go there, even if you are staying in the Stratosphere dump and have to shelp your way on the crowded stinky bus down Las Vegas Boulevard.  Do it."}
{"text":"Hands down, best pizza on the Las Vegas strip, no doubt about it. I would walk the entire strip from end to end just to eat this pizza. I can't even choose between Sicilian style or thin-sliced so I just get them both!"}
{"text":"Its cheap and open til 3am.   Its not the best pizza Ive had and not the worst.   Its pretty cheap compared to other pizza joints on the strip.  The slices are big and you can get a whole pizza for about 16 bux, which is not bad if you need to feed alot of people...  The workers here are very rude though...I guess they are trying to give it the whole New York feel...lol...All they need to do is start flipping people off...lol.."}
{"text":"$5 for a slice of cold \"NY\" pizza? this new yorker thinks not."}
{"text":"This was one of the worst pizza's I've ever had.  I ordered the mushroom pizza which came with maybe 5 to 10 pieces on a 2 inch thick piece of bread.  Sooooo not worth the wait or the cost.  If it wasn't for the fact that I was starving, I wouldn't have even eaten the half I did eat."}
{"text":"An awesome bite after watching Zumanity!  We saw the 10pm showing and by the time we got out we were starving!  It was really nice to see that this place was open.  Maybe it was because we were really hungry...but that slice of pizza was awesome!  A little over-priced--around $4+ for a slice...realized we should've just bought the whole pizza for $20.    Great little bite of NY style pizza at the NYNY Hotel :)"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Vegas.! The pepperoni pizza is bomb.! Every time we come to Vegas this is the \"must go\" place. The price isn't too bad and the pizza size it perfect. Plus you get to enjoy some music from the pub next door."}
{"text":"This to me was great pizza! I enjoyed it because the slices were huge and the prices were good. Its also open late. This will definitely be the pizza place for me to go to in Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"We ordered a whole pie, and at $28 considered it a bargain to feed five people in Vegas.  The line was relatively short when we arrived and upon placing the order, was told that it would be ready in 25 minutes.  They do not serve you at this place and after the 25 minute wait, it was back in line (which was much longer at this point) to pick up the pizza.  We opened up the box and right away noticed the terrible cutting job on the pie.  The pizza itself is very thin and the crappy cutting job made it impossible to pick up a whole slice of pizza.  The toppings and cheese were sliding off and it was just a huge mess.  We literally had to use forks to scoop the toppings back on our broken slices of pizza.    As far as taste goes, it was good.  Nothing spectacular but better than your average pizza joint.  This place was one of the best bargains in Vegas as it was inexpensive food that filled us up for the night."}
{"text":"I have been craving some great pizza for weeks. I did a search on Yelp and Travel Advisor to see where they say the best pizza in Vegas is. Sirrico's came up on top of both. I don't mind that it is a pizza by the slice place. That is all I wanted. I wanted to try a few so I got a slice if sausage and a slice of pepperoni. There were about eight or so people in front of me in line. One thing I didn't understand was why only one register was open. It took me about ten minutes to be rung up. There goes my piping hot pizza.  I ate the sausage first. The sauce was very tasty, as well as the cheeses and sausage. The crust had a good taste to it but was limp as all get outs. There was no crunch to it at all. Next on to the pepperoni. Again the crust was so limp. The pepperoni was some of the best I've had on the west coast. Not to spicy but full of flavor. But the best in Vegas it is far from. If you are at the New York, New York it would be ok to try it out. But don't make a special trip. It is only ok."}
{"text":"As soon as I get off the plane I go straight here for a pizza slice. Best pizza slice ever. When I'm not in Vegas I dream about going back just for the pizza."}
{"text":"Pricey but very good pizza for Vegas. The Sicilian is the way to go. Slices are very filling. No free refils on soda, $3 first , $1.62 per refill."}
{"text":"$12 for 2 slices is a little steep even for Vegas but it was 3am and we were hungry.  With that being said the pizza is real NY pizza and that's coming from a real New Yorker.  I prefer real thin slices u need to fold up to eat.  It was good."}
{"text":"This has been a must every year when we visit Vegas. Just got pizza and not a New York pizza as we have had in the past. This pizza was dry and lacking flavor. New York pizza has oil on and flavor, YES, unhealthy but I'm not eating it to be healthy.  I spoke to the manager and the chef, that had to change their recipe to low and no fat cheese because people complained of it being unhealthy, DONT EAT PIZZA if you're looking for healthy food. The do gooders have ruined my pizza hangout."}
{"text":"I've had worse pizza, but not much. And the way they have the line set up, your slice is cold by the time you finish paying. On the positive side, they do offer a fresh fruit cup for a healthy dessert."}
{"text":"All due respect to Janelle N. from Santa Monica, but you need to look harder in LA for a better pizza place. I'm from the same metro as you and I can name at least 10 places that are heads and shoulders better than this. In fact, this isn't even very good pizza, not for the price anyway. If it cost $2 a slice I'd say it was perfect, but since it's almost $5 a slice, gah! It better be something special.  This is not something special. It's your typical Pizza made NY style and the ingredients didn't seem like anything I wouldn't get from your low grade pizza joint. I'd never, ever go back here because the cost of the pizza just was not remotely worth the slice they gave me, which had also clearly been sitting out longer then I'd of liked as well.  I've tried pizza in Los Angeles as well, I also tried it in Chicago, in Alberqueque, in Minneapolis, in Milwaukee, but mark my words the Vegas pizza I ate here was by far the worst, and surprise surprise, also the most costly.  This place your typical average 3 star pizza, but because of the price it drops to a 2. Don't believe ANYONE who says this is anything other then average. Some people just don't explore far enough past Vegas to know."}
{"text":"One of the reasons I stay at NYNY is because of their variety of food. This stay I was disappointed. I love going to Sirricos but the last 2 times haven't been very good. They have 2 different types of pizza you can choose from, Sicilian which is the thicker type, or traditional New York which is large and thin. I went with the Sicilian. You walk up and choose what slice you want based on what they have prepared, if you want something different they tell you it's not available or to come back later. I chose a slice of cheese and a slice of pepperoni. When I started eating, it was already starting to get cold. You could tell it had been sitting there for a while. I would recommend them heating it up in the oven for you to make it hot and crispy, of course they won't do that because the wait time will be to long. Anyways I will take my adventures to another pizza place next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"This pizza was gross.  It was under cooked, and over priced.  I agree with a previous posting that a frozen pizza is better than what they are serving here.  also the village food court inside the NYNY Hotel is very crowded, and not planned well so seating can be hard to find."}
{"text":"This pizza joint absolutely sucks. The pizza was so plain and flavorless. I'd pay a dollar a slice at most. Don't waste your time here."}
{"text":"Ok prices for a quick lunch/snack. The sicilian seems to have spicier sauce than the traditional. Free wifi in the 'streets'."}
{"text":"I love this place! I always get their Pizza and beer combo...super deal! The sauce is really good and the ingredients are fresh. It is a must every time I hit Vegas!"}
{"text":"Definitely a quick bite place. I think the pizza is very good, one slice get me full. Overall pizza is good and the price very good... Open til 3am =]"}
{"text":"Can't say too much since i ordered the pie to go but this pizza is the bomb. The mushrooms really stood out since they were fresh but like any pizza the crust and the sauce are the main ingredients to judge on. Both were really good, not too soft and not too crunchy. This pizza was even good the next day cold!"}
{"text":"Love this pizza!  20 bucks fed two of us a slice of pizza and a soda each.  So tasty, we ate there for lunch AND dinner in one day! I highly recommend."}
{"text":"This is one of my go-to places for pizza in Vegas. I love the Sicilian-style pizzas here! The breadsticks are also really soft, garlicky and yummy"}
{"text":"I ate a big ol slice of Sausage and cheese pizza before our Zumanity show.  It was really tasty and filling. Pricey but its in the hotel/casino so what do you expect."}
{"text":"I am very rarely impressed by food. This was the best pizza I ever had in my life. I had a slice of the pepperoni and sausage pizza. It was perfect for me."}
{"text":"Yummy pizza. I love the location. That's what makes it.  Per another persons review I'm going to have to give it a try fresh out of the oven!"}
{"text":"This is New York style pizza at Las Vegas Strip prices.  No place in New York could get away with $5 a slice since there is great competition all over the place.  In Las Vegas, where most pizza is bad and you are paying casino prices, it will due.  The pizza was okay.  It is better than your Domino's and Papa John's.  But it doesn't compare with any neighborhood pizzeria anywhere within 200 miles of Brooklyn."}
{"text":"Came here for a convention weekend. So as someone looking for a quick bite to eat before heading back for a convention, I ditched MGM's busy food court and came here. I mean after all, its not too far away (New York New York is only a connector bridge thingy away!  So I wanted pizza, something quick and easy. Found this place as I was quickly scouting for a place to eat here in NYNY. Saw this place and decided to give it a try. I should have looked up the yelp reviews because I was not impressed. This pizza was not good at all. The crust was too thick (on all the ones they had, it was thick crust), and I am not a thick crust fan. Plus I know its Vegas in all and things on the strip on generally more expensive...but for 7 bucks a slice, it was not worth it.  I had the pepperoni since they had no combination. It was just \"eh!\". I would NOT come back here again. If only PH was closer cuz a Earl of Sandwich would have sounded SO much better then this nasty pizza. For a square shaped pizza, that was not good and overpriced, I wouldn't come back. Though I'd mite consider trying the lasagna if I did have to come back.  I give this place 2 stars. If your ever in vegas, PLEASE YELP before your eat at any place. Yes, even if your in a rush and too busy to look up a place to eat, NOT a fan."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had in Vegas. It's open late so great after a show or after drinks. Lots of variety to chose from. Not sure about the pies that sat since we had a slice from right out of the oven pies. Good flavor, even my Chicago man enjoyed a slice. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Wow, grabbed a slice on a whim on the way to a show. Was more than impressed. Was delicious! Huge slices, nice fluffy light texture, perfect amount of sauce and cheese. I liked it so much I took a picture of the name of the place so I wouldn't forget. Loved it! Nice friendly staff as well."}
{"text":"Got the regular slice and it was really good. Not too much sauce or cheese which I prefer. I had a grandmas slice as well an enjoyed the regular slice better"}
{"text":"This was a great place to grab some good food and \"escape\" the craziness on the strip. When you're in New York New York you'll find yourself in a cartoony, cute version of New York complete with hot dog joints, pizza places and a nice looking Jewish Deli. Sirrico's was a perfect place to grab a quick dinner, we got a whole pizza for $22 that fed 5 people and left all of us satisfied as we made our way onto the town for a night of drinking.   It was hot, greasy, but not too greasy and the thin crust pizza you can fold in half while you're eating it- good stuff. If you want some tasty food to coat your tummy before going out Sirrico's would be a great place to start."}
{"text":"Overall its a pretty good Pizza place. I usually end up coming here once on my visits to Vegas. This time was no different. The pizzas average and the price isn't bad if you want a quick bite to eat to beat down the hunger before hitting the next bar. I think the cool thing about this place is the pizzeria over looks the NY NY casino floor. Its a far stretch from eating real NY pizza in NY, but you kinda get that feeling when combined with the decor in the food area. It looks like the small shops/restaurants and streets of NY scaled down. Pizza is average, but it definitely gets an extra point for the view."}
{"text":"Mediocre pizza.  Unfortunately, mine was cold by the time I got to the front of the line."}
{"text":"This is one of two pizza places located inside the New York New York Hotel. I tried both of them being that I'm a huge New York style pizza fan. I would say that Sirrico's is the best one.  The slices were very big. I went with just cheese slices. The sauce was good, and the crust was to as well. Stays open really late, so after a night of hanging out (or winning some money at the casino) walk over there and enjoy a slice."}
{"text":"This pizza was okay, the sauce is good and so is the dough, but they skimped on the cheese. I recommend adding oregano and use the Parmesan that they offer. Adding that really makes it tastier. For the money, you can go to NY pizza on the other end of the strip and get a better pizza for less money."}
{"text":"Yummmm. Always good and always open when u need some food before bed. Love the pizza. Always hot and fresh. Never had a bad piece of pizza from here :-)"}
{"text":"Direct from NY.  My wife was born and raised in the big apple and has struggled with pizza places in Las Vegas.  We haven't found a problem finding good, traditional pizza, but for her Sicilian style, she has yet to find one, until we went to Sirrico's.  Closest she's felt to home in a while.  It was good, not stellar and their traditional is good as well.  Great option.  Pricey, I recommend buying a pie instead of just s slice."}
{"text":"I enjoy the food but they don't have sufficient pizzas ready for the Hockey game rush.  You end up waiting 20 minutes for a slice of  pepperoni."}
{"text":"We were staying at the Excalibur & originally thought we would head to New York New York to get food from Shake Shack, however pizza sounded really good. They were pulling out fresh pizzas from the oven at Sirrico's just as we walked in.  I ended up getting a deep dish pizza with pepperoni & mushrooms and my fiancé got a deep dish pizza with the veggie toppings. Both pizzas tasted fresh, had quite a few toppings, and had stringy gooey cheese. At 1am, they definitely hit the spot!  I will say that when we walked in, I hadn't look at the prices per slice. To my surprise, the total for two was a little bit over $15! They had a special for $7-some for a slice of pizza & a beer but I didn't realize that until after we had already paid. It was only about 70 cents extra for the beer so I'd probably get one next time. Overall, an okay choice to grab a bite if it's late, but not one I would choose when other options are available."}
{"text":"Hhm, from what I remember about my two slices, it was \"the best pizza I ever had!!\" (Just kidding, judgement becomes impaired when under the influence) But overall, I enjoyed the fresh and hot slices right out of the oven. Inexpensive for a quality slice and soda!"}
{"text":"I don't know why people are bashing this place so much...  It seems like any time that I go to Vegas, I end up eating here at least once.  I think the pizza is pretty good.  It's not terrible.  It is pretty hard to f-up a piece of pizza, ya know?  Even bad pizza is still good.  Maybe I am just easy to please.  Who knows...  It's definitely 'A-Ok' in a pinch and if you're starving.  I would recommend it.  And, I would definitely eat here again next time I go."}
{"text":"I've had a couple slices here on several occasions.  They serve large slices of tasty pies that will fill you up without breaking the bank.  Service has always been quick.  I was in and out in a jiffy.  There's plenty of seating available on the faux \"sidewalk\" outside the exit.  You can sit there and watch the roller coaster come back into the station while you are eating."}
{"text":"I remember being 11 or 12 years old and staying at New York New York with my family and having pizza in the \"New York streets\". That memory is forever engraved in my mind. A decade+ later and I still find myself coming to New York New York and getting a slice at Sirrico's.  I try me best at visiting Sirrico's whenever I'm in town. I'll admit it's not the best pizza in Vegas, but I love it for some reason. I guess it does help that it's open until 3 or 4AM. The slices are a little pricey ($5-6) but are generous in size. I typically get a traditional slice and a Sicilian slice. Add a soft-drink and you're looking at about $12.  The pizza itself depends on how long it's been sitting under the heat lamp. I typically wait for fresh pies to come out and never fail to be tasty. The crust is especially good, most notable on the Sicilian style, which is extra thick. The gooey cheese, thick crust, and pizza sauce all add up for some tasty NY pizza. I'm sure Sirrico's is years away from authentic NY style pizza, but it's Vegas after all.  Ambiance: 3 Stars (out of 5) Food: 3 Stars (out of 5) Service: N/A Price: $ Overall: 3 Stars (out of 5)  Pros: + New York and Sicilian style slices + Extra thick crust on Sicilian style + Slices or whole pies + Reasonably priced + Open late  Cons: - Quality and taste can vary"}
{"text":"This is the worst excuse for a slice of New York pizza I've ever had. Mushy bottom, weak sauce, and some sausage sprinkled on top. Not good"}
{"text":"Good pizza, and open till 3 a.m.  Great staff even in the wee hours.  Partway through my square, I realized the bottom was burnt (it wasn't in the corner I started on), and hubby took it back, asked for a new slice, and had no problem whatsoever getting it replaced.  Everyone was really nice, from the cashier to the people behind the counter, to the guy cleaning tables!"}
{"text":"Meh.   Not bad, not great. It's pizza. Eat it.   Beer makes it better."}
{"text":"Just stopped in for a late night snack.  The Pizza was good but certainly not the best I have ever had.   They have regular and Sicilian and both tasted pretty good.  If you need a quick bite after midnight its most definitely an option."}
{"text":"First thought was \"wow this's Pretty DAMB good pizza..........\" I would've gave it 5 stars but the  problem was that they need to run it thru the oven before handing it off................................................................. Got a couple cold pieces this weekend and it went from great to mediocre."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Not to fond of the pizza here. It's pretty greasy. You get a nice big slice though. I tried the pasta. Not that great. Only had a few bites and threw it sway. The cheese in the lasagna tasted old, like  re-heated leftovers. The garlic bread was hard. It was obviously sitting there awhile. They overcharged us. The customer service however was good. Very friendly. Some people didn't know anything about the food though. Was a little annoying having to keep waiting for him to ask someone else and report back to me. Salads are good. Beer is good."}
{"text":"My guy loves the pizza here so we made a stop about 2 hours after our early dinner or late lunch at BLT.  Since I was all dressed up and was afraid to gain massive amounts of weight in a short period of time and because it was sweet of him to buy me the burger at BLT, I treated him to a slice but he made me take a few bites of the pizza and continued to roll his eyes and scoff when I would hesitate to eat.    It is a good pizza.. very saucy (I always order my pizza w/ extra sauce), the pizza is thin but was a little bit doughy at the end, and our peperoni and jalapenos were evenly distributed.  It is \"our\" thing to add jalapenos (if not bacon as well) to our pizzas... I don't know why there wasn't bacon on this thing, haha.  He could have ordered bacon w/ a side of bacon (haha).    Sitting outside, there was music blaring from afar, people from all walks of life trekking back and forth, and the best thing that I saw whilst enjoying my snack at New York-New York were the slabs of dry-aged beef (steaks) featured at Gallagher's.  Did you know that Gallagher's is the only place in New York City to grill their steaks over hickory coals?  Now you do!"}
{"text":"I got a slice of pepperoni, and my boyfriend got a slice of meat-lovers supreme, or something like that. It was $18! I was shocked, that's pretty expensive pizza. It was delicious though. I do love a good New York Style pizza and this one was lovely. However, I can get meals like that elsewhere for cheaper. Still good though."}
{"text":"Omg this place was delicious! Had the munchies and the pepperoni pizza was tasty. I would def be coming back here again when I just this hotel. The service was fast and friendly. There's plenty of places to sit and eat when you order here."}
{"text":"I had a slice of the pepperoni pizza. It was good. The crust was a little crispy, just how I like my slice of pizza. The taste was good and flavorful. I give this pizza three stars because back at home in Bethesda, MD a place called corner slice had better New York style pizza. The slices are bigger and the taste is amazing. Way better than this place."}
{"text":"Fast and good and decent prices for Vegas. That's all I'm writing because if you're reading this you're probably drunk. Have fun!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in vegas, by far. I always buy by the whole pie. Cheaper to split amongst friends or family. Or take one back to so cal for the drive home. Pepperoni n mushroom with sausage.  Mmmmmm."}
{"text":"This pizza is okay. Not bad, not the best, but good enough if you're hungry and in the area. The Sicilian pizza was much better than the thin crust (we got both).   However it does seem overpriced, but I guess that's expected in vegas."}
{"text":"We went here for a 2am drunken snack. People were pissed that they were out of pizza but we waited a few minutes for a slice of vegetarian that was coming out (beggars can't be choosers right?) the pizza was really good and the guy waiting on people had a great attitude even though people were being rude. Would be nice if they had more pizza rolling out since it does say 24 hours on the sign."}
{"text":"Its the best pizza you are gonna find at 1 AM in Vegas. AVOID SBARRO! Meh!"}
{"text":"If you're staying in the MGM or NYNY, this is THE place for a night time snack to make the next morning feel less bad. It's open till forever and the slices are thick, big, and the right amount of greasy. The piano bar is next door so you'll be treating to some live music with your slice. Yes it's $5 for a slice and you'll need two but it's small price to pay for convenience and feeling ok the next morning. The whole pie is a much better deal but if you can wait the 25 minutes, you probably don't need it and can get a more quality pie elsewhere :)"}
{"text":"Worst slice of pizza i've ever eaten. Burnt and undercooked. It was cold and extremely greasy. I couldn't even hold it in my hand because it was soggy. Toppings were raw!! Spend your $ elsewhere. Pizza here is s*#% to say the least!!"}
{"text":"Ugh...the best thing about this is that they are near the piano bar, so you can enjoy the piano bar for free. I came here one evening around 9:30/10ish and there was a line. Luckily it moves quite quickly. However, their selection left much to be desired. They ran out of vegetarian slices, so they offered me a slice of Sicilian vegetarian. They neglected to mention (and I guess I neglected to check) that this is more expensive than a regular slice...More money, less pizza, worse pizza. Great... The crust was all dry and the slice was lukewarm. It probably had been sitting out there all day, since no one except for suckers like me would pay more for less.  I was also craving some greens. They had a mediocre salad selection, actually more options than what they listed on their menu board. Their Caesar salad looked kind of sad, just a bunch of romaine. However, they had a mozzarella, spinach and tomato salad that was actually pretty decent.   Once you get your food, snag a seat around the corner where you can enjoy the piano bar festivities for free.  1 star for the pizza 3 stars for the salad Average: 2 star experience"}
{"text":"I had this for a late night snack i have to say for fast food it was good. I had the lasagna and pizza slice and they both were tasty. The lasagna is the way to go with the garlic bread. Mmmmmm good. I would definitely do this again."}
{"text":"Yummy!!! Great pizza! 1 slice will definitely fill you up. I tried pepperoni and sausage. My hubby tried pepperoni slice. We were both pretty surprised on how good it was!"}
{"text":"Inside NY NY, casino floor level. It may not be the best pizza you have ever had but it is very good at 3am when you are so hungry with limited, immediate options!  It is always busy here! But, the friendly staff keeps the people moving through.  The pieces are quite large but it may be the most expensive single slice you have ever purchased ($9)! 1 star off for cost. But... this is Vegas! There are seats outside of the lineup/kitchen to enjoy your slice."}
{"text":"Close but no cigar as the Best Pizza.  It only lives up to its name providing the best for it's customers.  Located downstairs of its New York Ally of the New York New York resort hotel.  Feel the trains going by as well.   Great variety of food and pizza."}
{"text":"This place is usually a go to every time we are in Vegas. Usually I'd give it a 5 star rating. Last Monday we went and the pizza was cold and old. Seemed like it was sitting under the lamps too long. The thick crust pizza was wet and spongy. Was very disappointed this time around."}
{"text":"Despite what people may think... This is clearly some of the best pizza in Las Vegas...  IF. and I say it again IF... you wait for a freshly made pizza.    When this pizza is fresh out of the oven, it is downright delicious.   All of the components are just good. The cheese is delicate, sweet, not too sweet, tangy but not too much.   The bread is soft with a proper amount of air worked into it. It is sour as it should be but just a little bit to give it that Ny quality, and the sauce is not too sweet, not too bitter, just right.    It's a great slice of pizza. Coming from someone who walked the streets of Manhattan, trying one slice of pizza at EVERY pizza place my brother and I walked by, I can firmly tell you this is a delicious slice of NY style pizza when made fresh.   If it's not fresh, all bets are off."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza on the strip. The people who work there are morons but the taste and convenience definitely outweighs the short amount of time you have to deal with them."}
{"text":"Not the best pizza I've ever had, but it'll do when the carb cravings hit you when you're low on energy while gambling. Ernesto hooked me up with some items that I didn't even order. How nice. Extra star for that!  FOOD - Pepperoni pizza: I hope this doesn't represent NYC, because if it does, I've had better from Domino's. Just a bland, greasy, unremarkable pizza. + Garlic bread sticks: Decent, nothing ground breaking. - Lasagna: It was okay, but after a few bites in, your stomach may start to turn from the grease. + NY Style Cheesecake: Not bad. Satisfied my sweet tooth.  NOTES - Cafeteria style: You pick what slice you want and they reheat it in the oven. + Open weekdays till 3AM, and 4AM on weekends + Located inside the NYNY Hotel & Casino + Piano bar nearby  CONCLUSION I think I'll find something better along the Vegas Strip."}
{"text":"We paid $16 for the greasiest pizza ever.   My buddy who had one slice immediately took a giant, smelly dump in my room at NY NY."}
{"text":"This pizza sucks. It's worse than high school, worse than the movie theatre, I get better pizza from Vons.   Take s bite the grease comes of it like sprinklers. Cheap ingredients, greasy, the crust is burnt and soggy.   And it's expensive as fuck."}
{"text":"If you're at New York New York, you have to grab some pizza! For a little over $4, you get a pretty big slice (there's a pretty good array of different pizzas too!); after you pay, grab a seat outside, where you feel like you're in New York! I enjoyed eating here for the atmosphere...I didn't feel like the pizza was spectacular or anything...  I saw quite a few people order whole pizzas and take them up to their room...not a bad idea. Pizza party in the room with beer anyone?"}
{"text":"It's ok pretty fresh and the prices are good. Not the best pizza I ever tasted or the worst. Didn't find anything special about it. Its good if your drunk and its open late."}
{"text":"Whats up with the bad reviews? Do you people not enjoy good pizza? I love the Sicilian style slices, they are huge squares. The place is somewhat hidden in NY NY hotel which is actually kind of nice to go and just hide out and eat.   The seating outside is nice, it makes you feel like you are really in NY."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of NY style pizza. I've had it several times in New York City and its not my favorite. This place is pretty generic as others have said and somewhat bland. They had also run out of a lot of different kinds so I settled for something they did have. If I were craving pizza on the Strip, I'd probably go for something more exciting."}
{"text":"I think this is a great spot for thin crust NY style pizza. I love that they're open until 3 am!  Wish the line wasn't always so long."}
{"text":"We were in New York New York gambling on our last day in Vegas and decided we wanted something to eat. We found this place and thought Pizza sounded good. It wasn't busy when we were there; we walked in, and were promptly served in this cafeteria style pizza place. Decent sized slices of New York style pizza, the price isn't bad for Vegas.   The problem is the taste. It was bland. I had the pepperoni and sausage slice and there was almost nothing to it. Even after going back and putting crushed pepper, seasoned salt and parmesan cheese on it, there was still barely any flavor. The sauce was bland, the meat was bland, everything was bland. My wife had the same issue with her piece of pizza. There was almost no flavor to it.   It wasn't bad pizza, I just expected to taste.... Something.   But I guess if I wanted something good, I should have gone to a real restaurant."}
{"text":"One of my favorite place to eat. I have been here many times and their gross is always delicious. Must have for any pizza fan!"}
{"text":"Came here on Feb 6th 2011,  I guess with all the mixed reviews it really depends if you get a fresh batch of pizzas opposed to the ones that been sitting there.  That day I went I ordered 1 slice of Sicilian pepperoni for $5.13 tax included and it was fairly large and it was fresh and quite good.  Pretty nice crunch to it, along with the cheese and pepperoni,  best square type Sicilian pizza I've had (havent had too many).  One thing I'd like to point out is all the slices are not equal so ensure if they select a slice for you and the other ones look bigger/better dont be afraid to ask for another slice instead of the default they give you.  After all your paying for it, not them,  so they wouldnt care lol..  I'll be back here to try it again sometime."}
{"text":"Not too bad and semicheap for lunch.  The slices are huge and tasty.  One bad thing - the other patrons we were behind in line - have you ever been through a line where you pick food and move on down, quickly?!?  Geez, I felt like I was behind a bunch of idiots that have never been outside their home.  But anyway the pizza was pretty tasty and its in the cool New York New York Hotel so you can feel like you are (somewhat) in the city!  Good, cheap eats."}
{"text":"$7.70 for a slice of pizza and a beer? Don't mind if I do.  A slice is $5.50. Only $2 more for a beer is a steal in Vegas. You really can't NOT do this. The pizza is okay. Nothing special, but it's a cheap and reasonable option in Vegas when you're just looking for a quick, semi-cheap bite to eat.   They had lots of options for pizza toppings. It wasn't fresh out of the oven, but that happens at places where they sell just slices. Especially in Vegas. They're also open super late. Till 3 during weekdays, and till 4 on Friday and Saturday.   The line went quick, and the pizza was alright. They have a beer special too and that's worth it to try out if you're staying in New York!"}
{"text":"I actually liked this pizza. I liked this pizza so much I got it twice on my recent Vegas trip: once at midnight, and once for breakfast at 10 am! The trick is to ask the server to re-heat your slice in the oven. The pizza here was like an authentic New York slice. The perfect amount of tasty tomato sauce and the right amount of cheese on a very good, slightly bready but not too thick crust."}
{"text":"Sirrico's is found on the inside the New York, New York casino amongst the myriad of other food fronts and bars that make up the internal street scene.  The place is pretty busy and they turn out pizza's in an assembly line like fashion, most likely due to the popular $7.77 promotion---1 slice and a Rolling Rock beer.  Beer was *ice* cold (nice), but pizza slice was 'meh' at best.  It looked better than it tasted which was a shame...I hate to say but it just reminded me of DiGiorno frozen pizzas you get at the supermarket.  That being said, the premium pizza's and thick casserole style pizzas look much, much better.  If I find myself there again, I'll opt to give one of those a try.  The line moves at a pretty decent clip and there's the traditional variety of toppings to choose from.  They have a few different beer options, and also sell wine (cheap variety..think screw cap or boxed) by the glass."}
{"text":"The bf & I saw Cirque du Soleil's \"Zumanity\" and when the show let out, I was starving. It was close to midnight & there was still a short line outside this pizza joint. I ordered a slice of pepperoni pizza & a drink ($8) and the pizza was not bad at all. It tasted very fresh, despite us going there right before they closed, the sauce was tangy and it was a pretty good sized slice for the price.   If I ever find myself stumbling out of another sexually charged show & am hungry, I won't hesitate to stop at this place for another slice."}
{"text":"This pizza is the best in Vegas!  Every time my family and I are at the New York New York we can't resist coming to Sirrico's Pizza!  Their pizza is New York style pizza, which is my personal favorite.  You can order a whole pie, which a lot for four people or you can order single slices which would be good for one or two people."}
{"text":"I stopped by here today by myself for a later lunch.  This place is in the restaurants section of New York New York and is reminiscent of a food court.  I decided to go with a single slice of their four cheese pizza which was $5.  Not cheap but about standard for pizza in.casino prices.  The piece of pizza was decent sized and maybe would have been a sixth of a large.  Whenever I first bit into it I was expecting it to at least be warm.  Nope room temperature, awesome.  The under layer of dough was also quite soggy, probably from the grease of the cheese while it was sitting there waiting to be purchased as the back crust was crispy.  The cheese and sauce did little to inspire as well and were utterly forgettable.    The bottom line for me is that I would not stop back here again the future.  The pizza just wasn't that great and there is definitely better pizza to be had in the strip, mostly for a better price."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite pizza in Vegas. Every time I come visit this city I make It a point to visit this shop.   The Sicilian pizza is nice with a great thick crust, but the pizza is also greasy enough to fold when you pick it up. They serve several types of pizza in both traditional NY style as well as the Sicilian.   I also love the atmosphere of this place. The inside of the hotel/casino looks like you are on the streets of NYC! It makes you feel that you really are in NYC getting a slice from the corner shop. The streets inside are also labeled just as you see in the city.   I would recommend this place for a quick snack as you are gambling, or after a long night of drinking. They are open until 4am on some nights! They also serve beer that you can have with your slice. I call that a win-win!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to Sirrico's for a couple slices.  I was impressed.  Not a bad \"NY\" pizza slice.  The crust was done pretty darn nicely (thin, chewy with some slight charring on the bottom).  The sauce was good as was the cheese.  Overall, not a bad slice of pie.  I'd put it a notch below Secret Pizza.....but it's actually a pretty nice pie, especially if you like the  \"NY\" pizza style (thin, foldable crust with an emphasis on the cheese)"}
{"text":"I remember liking this place a lot as a kid. I still reminisce the thought of running up to our hotel room with a large pizza, steam blowing into my face as I opened the box. It's not quite the same as an adult. So less exciting. So less glamorous. You are either here after a late night of drinking or looking for a cheap bite to appease hunger or looking for an unfilling dinner after a lunch of buffet gorging. Mind you, it's not even cheap at about $4.50 a slice for pepperoni or sausage or both or both with jalapeno. The veggie's even more for once at $5. I would recommend a whole pie. That one is way reasonable. There's even a thick Sicilian style if floppy New York style is not your thing. Sometimes, there's a long line. Sometimes, it's worth it. Sometimes, it's not."}
{"text":"Went to this place coz shake shack was closed and we were checked in new york new york. I ordered 4 traditional pizzas and lasagna. Both tasted good. The service however was horrible. The cashier over charged me, he punched the wrong order and when I called out he discrepancy he didn't admit and kept insisiting I was wrong. The cashier kept speaking to me in spanish which I couldn't understand. He seemed irritated and insisting the price was correct. The pizza was 5.95 and my receipt said 6.50. He said it includes the tax.  The line was getting long so I just gave up and went to eat. When we finished and the line was gone I went back to clarify that tax was not included in the price and he still didn't admit his mistake.  He started pointing to the tip jar and was throwing a dollar in a very insulting gesture - which was apparently the difference in total. I just said he could keep the dollar and I looked for their manager. The manager apologized. I felt humiliated so we just we left and told ghe rest of our group to never to eat at that place again."}
{"text":"READ MY WHOLE REVIEW-- Nice big slice of pizza & a draft beer for $7.77! This is a great food deal in Vegas. We just needed a quick dinner option and this was good. Go check them out! ****If you DON'T drink beer then you may want to reconsider (see prices below). Why would a fountain drink that DOES NOT get free refills be more than a beer????  *1 slice of pizza with a draft =$7.77 *1 slice of pepperoni pizza  =$5.95 *1 large fountain drink =$3.95"}
{"text":"This place is cute, the food is cheap and the service is good and not to mention they have delicious pizza and salads. Plus it looks like it's in a alley way in NY. What else could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Freaking fresh and delicious pizza especially when you've been drinking all night. Love late night pizza! I got the veggie pizza and it was hot, fresh vegetable ingredients and totally hit the spot. I guess I was too hungry and ate the pizza before I could snap a pic. Ha. Bonus, it's right across from the dueling piano bar, Bar at Times Square in New York, New York Hotel."}
{"text":"Here is a pic  Its not even as good as chef boy ardee  Awfull  Kids will hate it had to buy more food after everyone was totally upset.  Pizza is see through  Expensive and not worth it  Order dominos to your room"}
{"text":"I wouldn't stop here by choice, but my friends thought they'd find authentic New York pizza at New York New York, so here I was. It's cute they thought that, but I warned them it's not true. The pizza is good enough for a drunk individual who believes they are in New York City while stumbling through here.   I tried the thick and thin crust, and was not impressed by either. The thin crust was decidedly MUCH better, but is not what I recall of New York City. It's not fresh unless you happen to make it there as they pull one out of the oven, and sadly, they did not reheat my slices that had been out for a while. It's busy here, like an assembly line, so you better know what you want, and know it fast. If you're in a rush and don't care, perfect place for you."}
{"text":"I like Vegas because there were so many late night dining places all within a 1-mile radius.  This place was no exception.  It's open until 3am (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=sAb47uEcSjK3uQcylhkhPw) and it was busy no matter the time of day/night.  For a short wait, you can get a gooey, cheesy NY (or Sicilian) slice of pizza.  My brother, boyfriend and I were famished after the boxing match and decided to just take food in our hotel room.  We figured that a slice wasn't going to cut it so we ordered an entire NY-style pepperoni and sausage pie (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=sAb47uEcSjK3uQcylhkhPw).  We had to wait 20 minutes but it was well worth it - hot and fresh out of the oven.  It wasn't greasy than most pizzas so I didn't get the overstuffed feeling afterwards.  It definitely hit the spot. And the price tag on this colossal wide, thin and foldable slice was pretty reasonable in my opinion (about $3/NY, $4/Sicilian or $15/pie).  TIP:  Don't let the long line fool you; it goes by pretty fast unless you order a whole pie which takes about 20 minutes."}
{"text":"Pizza by the slice open until 3:00 a.m. is the lure of Sirrico's Pizza in New York New York Hotel & Casino. Is the pizza good? Nope. Is it worth $5? Maybe. Will you be full? Probably.  The line at 12:30 a.m. was about 15 minutes long. Basically, you pick  a slice or two from the pre-made pizzas and then it is reheated as you head to the register. The happiest customers seemed to be those getting whole pies to go.  The pizza line also was the scene of one of the saddest things I saw in Vegas. A possibly homeless person right in front of me got a slice of pizza, discreetly folded it, stuffed it in his pocket, and headed for the door. It broke my heart and made me want to give him my slice, too.  I got a slice of Jalapeno and Pepperoni. It put some quick carbs in my belly and let me get back out on the casino floor. Let Sirrico's Pizza do the same for you if you are just hungry."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for years and years, and this year was a bust.  For four sicilian slices, the price was $26 and the pizza wasn't hot, fresh or tasty.  The yahoo behind the counter \"Michael\" seemed terribly annoyed that we asked him for pizza, though that is his entire job.  Take spatula, scoop up slice, put on plate and hand to customer.  Apparently that was too much work for him.  I can get past a less than ideal slice, but someone behind the counter who doesn't want to be there should just go scrub toilets!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to hit late night after a night of drinking in Vegas.  Been coming here for years and I strategically try to stay in a hotel nearby so that it can be my last stop of the evening.  Open real late and incredibly reasonable prices, especially for Vegas.  Service is good and it's always fun to get a cheap slice or two at the end of a long night to eat at the tables or in your room.  They have a choice of NY style pizza and Sicilian style foccacia bread pizza.  I had the latter twice this trip and each time it satisfied.  For some reason, I didn't enjoy it as much as previous trips, but it was still good.  Perhaps next time, I'll try the NY style thin crust pizza instead.  It's nothing fancy, but hard to fault an inexpensive pizza by the slice place that's open late on the strip."}
{"text":"If looking for a quick bite in New York New York, this place will definitely fill you up. Big, heavy slices, loads of cheese. Definitely better than chain pizza joints."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love grabbing a slice of greasy new York style pizza after a long night of gambling and drinking?! I do! I just recently stayed overnight at the New York New York Hotel and Casino just this past week and stumbled across this place. Now even though I shouldn't be eating pizza at 2AM who cares I already messed that whole diet thing up after consuming the empty calories in the liquor that night hehe. Pizza was on my mind until I actually walked inside the place and saw how delicious the lasagna was looking. One of the employee's was super friendly and kind enough to encourage me to get this dish over the pizza because it was \"more fresh\" which aka he in code let me know the pizza wasn't as good. Thanks bro! I will have to re-visit this place when they have a fresh slice of pizza available then! They are open until 3AM during the weekdays so if you find yourself wandering around the strip in the area or staying inside the hotel stop by!"}
{"text":"The Pizza was ok. I gave it three stars because it's in the right place-the New York New York hotel. And so it holds up to the concept of any nyc Pizza spot-fast Pizza not necessarily good Pizza."}
{"text":"Fairly priced, fast service! It was crazy busy, but service was still fast and great. My kids lived New York New York!"}
{"text":"Food poisoning on 10-15-2016.  Wife and I each had a slice of pizza and were vomiting an hour later.  Had to take an ambulance to the ER from our hotel.    Don't eat here.  Ever!!!"}
{"text":"I grew up in the burbs of New York and have a decent understanding of New York style pizza.  I had a slice of the four cheese pizza at Sirrico's and it was pretty good.  The crust was a little bland and undercooked, but the thickness and taste had more of a New York quality than the stuff that I find at home in New England.  A slice was $5, but the slice was larger than average and was best consumed when folded in half.  They also had sicilian pizza, which is sort of an unknown in most of the country.  I would have liked to try that too, but I just needed a snack and one slice was enough for me."}
{"text":"Always tasty pizza!   I love the crust, crunchy, chewy & flavorful.  I will always come back for more : )"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints me. We eat here every time in Vegas. Either our 1st meal or our last. Some times even twice.    I'm not saying it's the best pizza ever but it is good. I love the deep dish square slices.   Lots of other choices beside pizza too.  Service is good. Friendly staff.   Try to Copa De Vino wines too."}
{"text":"My son wanted pizza and garlic bread.  The garlic bread was hard as a rock. This could have gone the wrong way but they exchanged it for another slice of pizza for him.  Food was average but they get 4 stars for stepping up and handling the situation properly."}
{"text":"Visited May 1, 2015. The mushroom pizza was amazing! And getting the beer & pizza special, under $8 is a plus after an exciting night in Las Vegas! Great people working there, they were very friendly!"}
{"text":"Great place for a cheap, quick bite to eat. I was drunk every time I've had this, but it was always amazing, like most food is after drinking. Great place to get a little something in your tummy before a night of drinking!"}
{"text":"We ordered a $30 pie for take out with jalapeños, green peppers, and black olives. Very spicy - I enjoyed but definitely do not order the jalapeños if your heat tolerance isn't high.   The wait time was 20-25 minutes, just as the server had advised. Great service - we were given plates, chilli flakes, and parmesan to take back with us."}
{"text":"I gave them 2 stars for being open late. The pizza was awful and I am from NYC. Please change the receipe for the crust and add some more cheese, how can you represent NY and have bad pizza???"}
{"text":"It's $5.95 for the biggest/greasiest single slice of pepperoni pizza, but hey when I wanted an easy lunch before the pool - it worked! I managed to eat the whole dang piece lol. They have a $7.00/deal for a slice and a rolling rock!   If we stay at NYNY again I would probably get more pizza here, lol! Convenience!"}
{"text":"Came here for a slice before Zumanity and the pizza was terrible - cold, bland, with a couple of desiccated mushrooms and tasteless tomato sauce. All that for $5.75 a slice -- avoid."}
{"text":"Nice little pizza shop inside the Village Streets food court of sorts at the New York New York Hotel & Casino. They've good slices of Sicilian or New York style pizza already made and ready to be tossed on a plate.   Various choices of toppings are available, though the pepperoni & sausage rock!   There's also garlic bread, garlic twists, and pizza lasagna, but what I liked best was that they were open late when you've got the cruising munchies going on and there's the slice of pizza and a Busch lite beer special for $5.75.   Can't really want for more at that time.  And there's usually seats to be found at nearby \"street\" tables, which if you are lucky, will afford you a view of the action going on across the \"street\" at Bar At Times Square.  I went here 3 times at least in a couple of days and the only thing that stops 5 stars here is that the service is slow, with one taking care of the orders, one person at the register down at the end, and the rest of the crew are making pizzas.  This can get a line of people stacking up really quick, and then the guy taking the orders seems to get lost in figuring out who's next in line."}
{"text":"This place could easily put New York pizzeria out of business. The location is less accessible but the quality in food and service is beyond comparison."}
{"text":"The pizza here tasted really, really good. The bad? It gave me a mild case of food poisoning. Totally gross.  So... three stars to Sirrico's for letting me enjoy a nice, gooey slice of pizza while making me feel skinny the next day."}
{"text":"A good affordable alternative inside the New York New York Casino. The service is pretty fast and the pizza slices are enormous. I would come back for sure..."}
{"text":"Really good NY style pizza at where else... New York New York casino!  Don't know about the other two ppl and why they hated this place so much but have tried this place multiple times over the years and again last week and the pizza was delicious and hot as usual.  It is NY style pizza so don't expect anything different - a thin chewy crust that you can fold, flavorful sauce and pepperoni, and oil oozing everything from the top. Our slices came hot (and if it's cold, ask them to throw it into the oven for a couple min), huge, and were awesome. I think their NY style pizza is better than most I've tried in the SF Bay Area, esp due to their tasty sauce.  Bottom line: If you have to get your NY style pizza in Vegas, Sirrico's in the NYNY casino should hit the spot."}
{"text":"This is a review by a vegetarian  The Sicilian (plain) is doughy, bland, and overpriced at about $4 for a big slice. I thought casinos just looked to break even on food."}
{"text":"A little pricey but that's to be expected given the location, huge and tasty slices."}
{"text":"Decent pizza that gets better the later in the night it is, but awful service. Constantly out of popular pies if you want just a slice, and ordering a whole pie takes 3x longer than they say it will. Management is quick to offer remedies for mix ups but staff is quick to cop an attitude when called out for mistakes."}
{"text":"I can not believe the reviews I am reading. My husband and I went there twice during our Vegas stay 10/28/09-11/03/09, and would love to have a pie now. The service was excellent, and the pizza was wonderful. We ordered a traditional and it was so yummy! I am not sure why anyone would not love their pizza. I wish they had one in Houston!!"}
{"text":"Went here cuz I was craving for something quick and easy for lunch and figured pizza would be my best bet.  This place is a generic pizza place where you can pick a slice of whatever flavor they have available. There isn't really anything too special about this place and the slices are decent in size. One slice should be enough for a snack or a light lunch. Don't expect the crust to be crispy since the pizza are just left on display and are quickly warmed up if needed.  If you want some delicious pizza and have some time to spare then I'd recommend checking out Five50 at the Aria."}
{"text":"As a New Yorker; this is a terrible representation of NY style pizza.  The dough is of poor quality, the cheese is clearly imitation cheese, and the price is outrageous.  $33 for four single topping slices of pizza and two drink?!?!  I thought I'd give them a chance but disappointed and disgusted is an understatement of how I'm feeling about this visit. The one star is because the Pepsi was GREAT. This place should be in the middle of the desert and not in New York New York Hotel & Casino"}
{"text":"How could I resist when my manfriend calls and asks, \"Hungry?\" Without a single thought, I blurted, \"Yes!\" He says, \"Am gonna take you to where the best New York pizza is!\" Uhm, there's that in this city? Am thinking, my my my he knows I heart NY pizza!?! How did he know? Hmmm, a man after my own heart! Yeaaay okay, he picks me up and off we go. Initially, he says to valet park the car and so I thought so we can get in to noshing pizza at once (with a smile to my face) but then the practical me says to him to just park the car in the self park area of the hotel because am thinking this keeps my hunger perked up some more into hunger-ness. It's just that I miss New York pizza. It's been sooo long ago, and so does he! We're both from the Eastcoast so there...New York pizza is a definite go-to food for us. New York pizza have always been the best pizza I ever tasted in this American part of the world. (I just have to dream about real Italian pizza until I set foot in Italy some day).  Sirrico's Pizza is in New York-New York hotel and casino. It serves mighty big slices in that good ol' triangle shape or square shape pizza cuts. It's fresh and hot hot from the oven! A variety of pizza choices. Didn't even shy me from asking for the newest made pizza and the biggest of the slices. Pizza grande!  Like a \"starved\" woman, I was aching for this pizza. Looking at the slices of Sirrico's Pizza from the big wide glass-encased food service counter, the pizza man served my boyfriend first and then me. He served us with politeness to even ask which pizza we wanted. Of course, I asked for the ones fresh out of the oven as he pulls out from the oven a new hot tray of pizza and layed it down in front of us. A side order of garlic bread with tomato sauce also was requested by my man friend. Service was polite, fast and with ease. There was no line or wait as we breezed through with the pizza and beverages into the paying process. I spotted the usual toppings of hot dried red peppers, garlic, oregano along the way to the cashier. Asked my boyfriend whether he likes garlic and not repulsed by the smell of it. He says he likes garlic, oh my! Then so, I got a hold of the oregano, hot red dried pepper, garlic containers and drizzled 'em on my pizza! These, are my usual fixings to the New York pizza for as long as I eat New York pizza ever since. I usually ignore the cheese topping. There's cheese enough in the pizza. Why ever top it with another kind of cheese?  the parmesan cheese.   Dear boyfriend found a nice round table to seat outside of the pizzeria. It's dining ala outdoors-y from the pizzeria which includes people-watching and strains of music from somewhere the piano bar next to the pizzeria can be heard. I have to say for the cost it took to have 'em, this did not faze either one of us from having two picks of pizza slices each: a slice of ooey-gooey cheesey large cuts of pepperoni pizza and a slice of vegetarian pizza topped with large cuts of onions, olives, mushrooms and green peppers. The pizza had just the right amount of cheeze-iness, tasty tomato sauce, and it appeared moist with oil clearly visible but it lack the desired crunchiness on the dough for it was thick! Oh pleased...gusto, mangia mangia pizza pizza! (eat pizza) Mangiare pizza grande! (eat big pizza!) Aaah, hearty dining! It's my man's treat of a simple meal but mightily appreciated, as it brings a smile to my tummy and memories of our eastcoast lives and New York! To some this may not be the best pizza in this city but sure is to our New York pizza memory. Hungry for pizza? You, am talking to you! Go munch on a pizza yumm pizza!"}
{"text":"Love the pizza here! I always stop and grab a slice of this New York style pizza. It's in the food court of the New York New York hotel. You get in line and they serve you cafeteria style and you get your drink and pay at the end. You can't sit in the restaurant itself, but there is plenty of seating in the food court. Come by and have a slice."}
{"text":"Love this place. A few hotels have pizza spots. It you can't beat the NY style pizza at this spot. Plus they are the only thing open late night at the hotel that's not the 24 hour breakfast spot. They people that work there are nice and that's always a plus."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite pizza. This is the type of pizza we're the dough alone speaks for itself. The crust is soft and doughy in a good way like a delicious bakery bread. That's my favorite kind of pizza. I'm from California and this place beats all the pizzerias I've eaten at."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. It was a go to on my last Vegas trip when we got back to the hotel. It's located inside the New York New York Hotel. I recommend the NY style, it's excellent.   They're also open till around 3am, so it's perfect for a late night snack!"}
{"text":"I really didn't care that it was \"New York\" style pizza or compare it to it.  I just thought it was pretty good pizza.  I had the sicilian style also which I thought was great.  But then again, after walking up and down the strip all day starving, I guess anything would be!"}
{"text":"This is so our spot for some late night grub after a long night of drinking and playing tables.  Pizza, pizza.  We had a pepperoni and the other cheese.  Yummo!  It's open until 3am, too."}
{"text":"Right on the strip you can get a big square thick crust slice of pizza for 3.48 cents. The pizza is decent and they also serve manicotti, lasagna, and salads. Decently priced, okay food right on the strip-- enough said."}
{"text":"$6.00 for a slice of Mushroom pizza that tastes like tap water. The crust, the cheese, everything was so bland.   Customer service-wise, the lady at the counter was very nice, thus the 2 stars.   I've never had pizza from NY but I sure hope that this isn't what I would go all the way over there for."}
{"text":"Yes - not my favorite place in NYNY.  We actually had a better slice upstairs when Nathan's Hotdogs is.  This is a line type restaurant.  When you approach the line you will see all of the pizza options you have to choose from.  We opted for a regular cheese slice and a slice of sicilian (thick crust) with meatball and pep.  First of all the cheese slice was cold and just not good at all.  The crust wasn't even tasty and I typically like to eat the crust.  The sicilian was a bit better but both my husband and I felt sick about twenty minutes after eating.  We had not had anything prior.  All in all I was say that there are many other better choices at this hotel.  They do have a special which includes a slice and cup of Rolling Rock beer for $7.77."}
{"text":"Why oh why do they never have mushroom pizza on hand??  It's on their menu board and they never, ever have it.  I've been to Sirrico's a handful of times and this time, I was reduced to trying their lasagna, which was entirely too drowned in sauce.  I really want to like this place more."}
{"text":"I was expecting a crappy pizza.  Instead I was amazed to discover one of the best sauces I've ever had.  The Sicilian style pizza was a bit too doughy, so I'd probably stick to the standard slice."}
{"text":"Decent pizza. You can have the choice of regular or thick crust.   Specially good is that it was open at midnight when nothing else much is open."}
{"text":"We were craving pizza and it was in the hotel we were gambling at. I got the cheese and hubby got the square cheese. It was good and my only complaint is I wish the pizza was warmed up longer. I like mine extra hot and crispy on the bottom."}
{"text":"My Bestie and I have to go here when we go to vegas. WE HAVE TO.maybe its just because of all the drunk memories... but we HAVE TO. lol.  sure, its just pizza. but who cares when the crust is amazing...lol. its about 5 bucks a slice. average for vegas. im just plain jane when i come here. i jsut get the pepperoni slice. and im satisfied.  make sure the guy heats it up for u so its sizzling.   sure, the people there arent hella friendly. but when ur drunk, who gives a shit. as long as ur not in my face. we're friends. lol  sure, u have to sit \"outside\" where the tables arent always clean, but who cares when u have bomb pizza in front of u.  sure, i lost my credit card around here before, but who cares when the crunchy and chewy crust is waiting to be gobbled up.  sigh, ill be back. memories and pizza on the streets on New York New York"}
{"text":"I will say this place, when in need of a quick bite that pretty tasty, this place fits the bill. Super quick service, and the food soooooo good! I had a plain cheese pizza, the bf had a pepperoni pizza and we split a Greek salad. All in all...hot greasy goodness!!! Yummmmm!!"}
{"text":"BEST pizza place on the strip... ANYTIME of the day!  My honee and I were walking the strip... looking for a low key bar to eat and watch the UK/US World Cup game... and couldn't really find anywhere open so we decided to take a stroll into New York New York and saw a beacon of light shining from Sirrico's calling my name.  As always the service was quick and they had the best bargain... a slice of pizza & draft COORS for $5.95. Where are you going to get that kind of bargain on the strip? I got traditional Veggie and I loved the thin sliced crust. The cold beer was a perfect pair as always. Also... with all the sports bars around the pizza joint, we were able to find a seat and enjoy the game... Perfect!"}
{"text":"We were staying at the New York New York and after walking the strip for a few hours we needed a good snack. As other customers were walking by and had great looking slices of pizza we said oh yeah! We had to try it. The pizza is a decenct price and the slices are huge. For $6.50 we got a slice of pizza and a cup of beer. They also sell whole pizzas for a reasonable price.The pizza was awesome! Especially the crust. The only draw back was I personally would have liked a tad more sauce. Great service and food!! Will definitely eat there again!"}
{"text":"My brother and I were trying to get to In-N-Out from the strip on foot, and failed, so we found ourselves in NYNY.  This seemed like the quickest cheap meal so we tried it. There was no line, and the pizzas sitting out were fresh. I got two slices, a pep and pep & black olive. My bro got a pep and breadsticks.  The pizza was okay, but proper NY it was not. The entire crust was a bit chewy and did not have the blackened crispy cracker quality of an authentic NY style pie. The bottom was golden brown at best, and while not bad at almost $6 a damn slice this was an affront to NY pizza.  Decent grease level to tame a late night buzz, but not a good example of NY pizza."}
{"text":"As a longtime Dallas Cowboys fan, I thought there was only one place to go to watch the second half of the first Sunday Night Football game once the Cowboys led 16-0 over the Giants: New York New York.  The only thing better than watching Giants fans get pissed off and openly frustrated about their team's play in a loss to Dallas is watching Eagles fans do the same thing.   So, before finding a nice spot to enjoy the second half, I knew getting a slice in this hotel and casino would enhance the victory. Besides, getting slices in a casino themed for New York had to be tasty.  Well, despite some of the negative reviews here from people who clearly have no discernible taste buds when they are drunk near closing at 3am, I would recommend this pizza and even thought the sauce had a nice extra kick to it.   There were about eight different types of slices to choose from, in both thin crust and Sicilian. And mine was plenty hot despite ordering a slice that was sitting out on display and then put back in the oven for a couple minutes.   And since I'm always looking for lunch deals back home that feature slices and a drink, I was immediately attracted to their deal offering ANY slice AND a draft beer for $7.77. I was a little disappointed that tax wasn't included...simply because if you're really doing a Vegas-style deal, you should literally pay $7.77 as the total.  As legendary hockey writer Dicky Dunn would say, \"I was trying to capture the spirit of the thing.\"  Besides, the draft beer you receive is a cold, crisp, clean, Busch Light.   Yes, I've had it before. Yes, I attend NASCAR races. No, I don't drink it often.  However, that Busch Light washed down a large slice of pepperoni in a surprisingly effective fashion while I gleefully listened to one Giants fan after another bitch about Eli Manning over in the sports book."}
{"text":"Great Service and food! Split a slice of pizza and a beer for $7.77. We walked from Treasure Island along the strip in and out of casinos along the way to New York New York specifically for a slice of pizza and definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"The lady behind the counter was a little rude.  There was no line and when I walked in no signs posted to order here?? Got to the cash register to order and has to go back to get my pizza.    Ordered the Sicilian pepperoni for John and the mushroom for myself.  Nothing like the pizza I remembered in NYC.  Pretty bland, and the crust was burnt.  It was a debate between the deli and pizza..should've gone with the deli."}
{"text":"Pretty impressive flavor for fast food. It's the bread throughout the hotel. Skip the little salads and the thicker slices"}
{"text":"WE eat here every time we go to Vegas. My picky eater husband loves the Lasagna! I am always torn between ordering pizza or lasagna. Always good for a quick inexpensive meal to mix in with all the other Vegas choices. We are going in September and will for sure be stopping by!"}
{"text":"We make this a must-do every time we are in Vegas to get the meatball grinder. It is awesome - 3 huge meatballs, sauce and a lot of melted cheese. The pizza is good, too, but one time I got the pizza instead of the grinder and was so jealous of my husband's I vowed to always order the grinder every time in the future. The folks behind the counter were very nice."}
{"text":"Why does everyone hate this place?  The pizza is good!  There was no line when we showed up, but there was when we left.  Three hungry guys decided to order a whole mushroom pie instead of individual slices.  They quoted us a wait of 20 minutes, but it turned out to be 35, and we had to harrass them a few times.  We suspected that they used our first pie to dole out slices to the lunch crowd.  Fuckers.  But it was worth the wait, because the pizza was damn good New York style, and a nice value at $16 for 8 slices.  And yeah--my friends each ate only two slices, so I ate the other four.  What's it to you?  (Ha ha, I'm practicing my New York attitude.)"}
{"text":"Grabbed a quick slice of Sicilian pizza with extra sauce and enjoyed every bite. Will be back."}
{"text":"I do not recall ever having authentic NY Pizza, until trying this place. I went the first time on a friends recommendation. I went the second time, the next day, because it was that good.   I tried both the square sausage and the cheese pizzas. I preferred the sausage better but the the bread was equally soft on both. It was the perfect dough. I think I preferred the sausage better because it was a bit more fresh than the cheese. The cheese pizza was possibly sitting longer in the hot lamp.   Nevertheless, it was good enough for a 2nd visit and future visits."}
{"text":"We order A large peperoni there are 3 ready to go. They make us wait 25 minutes for one I don't understand this place will not put the costumer first. It's a workforce full of basic ass bitches"}
{"text":"pertty good pizza thin crust. great late night food after drinking..we ate here 2 times while in vegas"}
{"text":"Located in the Village Food Court area of the New York New York Hotel & Casino. This is a counter service restaurant with various pizza slices and a few other Italian food items. If you want to grab a quick bite, this is worth a stop."}
{"text":"We went to Newyork newyork hotel just to eat pizza here cause one of our friends recommended this place for VEGETARIAN pizza. There was no line ( we went around 10pm) and we got a couple slices of Newyork style vegetarian pizza, it looked quite tempting ( we were very hungry) but they did not reheat the pizza (I like my pizza hot). One Slice was quite filling for me; it had good amount of cheese ( which I do not like as much) and veggies but it tasted okay! Nothing too different. They had good meat pizza options and pasta, salads, etc."}
{"text":"Went on a Monday for lunch and it was not crowded at all. They also had a wide variety of pizza.  I got the pepperoni and mushroom and it was not good at all. A little on the salty side for my taste. Sure the portion was pretty big but does that even matter if you're not going to finish it?  Meh. Blah. And meh again."}
{"text":"Went here for a slice 16 years ago during our first time in vegas. Went back last week and the pizza is as good as we remembered!  Only issue that I had really was the rudeness of the employees. Vegas is a consumer driven town. They want business they should be nicer to the consumers. They don't have to act as if they are truly in New York City!!"}
{"text":"This place is underrated. I've never had pizza this good, and trust me, I've tried a lot of pizza. Don't think twice if you're considering it. It's the best best."}
{"text":"Mrs. liked the layout of Greenwich Ave. She wanted to dine with the feeling of a street seating setup. So, we each got ourselves food from different restaurants. Ian wanted a pizza from this place. Total for the slice was $5.95.  Ordering is straightforward. You walk in, place your order, choose your drink, pay at the end of the counter, and carry away your plate of warm food.   Pros: Location, I guess. No Queue at this place compared to the other joints when we ordered.  Cons: Not good at all. One of the worst pizza's we ever saw/ate (-2) Portion was tiny (-1)"}
{"text":"This place is located I side the New York New York casino and is open til 4am for those of you needing a late night snack.  The pizza is good, but lacks a little flavor.  It doesn't have that extra umphh. In addition to the pizza, they have salads and meatball subs.  The meatballs was also missing just a little bit of soul.  Um... The place was good, but next time I will try the other pizza spot upstairs"}
{"text":"Kate S. pretty much wrote my review for me (I was in the same group as her and Daren D.)  I also got a slice of cheese and found it similarly disappointing.  I'm a bit of a pizza snob, but tipsy, tired, and post-midnight, I just want it to have some decent flavor.  It had NO flavor, even the crust was bland and unappetizing and I too am a crust-lover.  Even drunk, I have some standards.  Overpriced, unappealing, and it wasn't very hot either.  I usually enjoy the food at NY-NY but I'll be skipping this one in the future.  I had MUCH better pizza upstairs at a place whose name I've forgotten, so I'll go back there next time.  Side rant - 45 minutes for a pizza?  Sure, it needs baking time but more like 20 minutes + 5 to put it together."}
{"text":"Meh is right. The pizza here is a doughy slice of crap, but you can get one with a beer for only $5.75. So, should you find yourself wandering around NY NY late at night, drunk, and in dire need of some sustenance... well, this is a good deal. The pizza will soak up some of the booze in your stomach (thus allowing for more to be imbibed). The beer is Bud Light. Yea, yea... I know, it sucks. But at least it ain't Coors Light or - shudder - Miller. Of course, you'll hopefully be drunk enough that none of this will matter."}
{"text":"okay.. so we all say pizza from new york is amazing right?  Well this place is okay.  The slices are huge but the taste isn't there.  For some reason, I believe it's the crust, well at least for the thick crust pizzas.  The thin crust, it's a little better.  well that's my opinion at least, the boyfriend on the other hand likes it.  but what more do you want, your at new york new york and it's 2 am in the morning and they are the only place open around you."}
{"text":"Slices were noticeably smaller my visit last week.  Pizza was still good, but cheaping out and shrinking your slices to improve profits on already expensive slices is going to cost you a star."}
{"text":"This place is in a casino for a reason. It's a real gamble if you get a good slice.  A whole pie-fresh out of the oven is ok. But the slice are either doughy as hell or dried out and crisy.  Huge slices but what does it matter if it's no good. I'd say pass & go off the strip for some real NY pizza."}
{"text":"A native NY'er here....pizza comes surprisingly NYC authentic. First slice made you want another."}
{"text":"I loved my thick crust pepperoni pineapple pizza square slice.  If you go, ask them to pop your pizza in the oven to warm it up.  We also bought a slice of thin crust pepperoni pizza.  Service was great, quick, and friendly from the young man at the counter."}
{"text":"Located inside the New York New York Hotel & Casino, I have to say that Sirrico's Pizza is probably the best deal for food you will get on the strip.  With prices starting out at around $3 and getting a whole pizza for around $16, if you're hungry and looking for something filling at a cheap price, this is your stop.  They offer 2 different types of Pizza \"Traditional\" which is more of your NY style thin crust slice or \"Sicilian\" which is more like a forroccia style slice and they have about 5 or 6 different styles of each pizza ready to be served.  They also offer some pasta, sandwiches, and salads.  Sirrico's Pizza is run like a lunch counter, you pick what you want, slide your tray over and pay at the register.  Not much to it.  I decided to get a \"traditional\" slice of pepperoni pizza.  They guy gave me a huge piece and paid for it and found a seat around the corner.  Took a bit into it and have to say it was alright.  The crust was thin, but not like a cracker so you can easily fold it in half, they were a bit light on the sauce for my taste and very heavy on the cheese.  There was also a good amount of pepperoni on it, so I'm glad they didn't skimp on that.  It wasn't the best pizza I've had, but in Vegas for about $3 and good portion size, I honestly couldn't complain.  It made for a good 3:30 in the after noon late lunch before dinner at 8PM and filled me up.  Overall, yes I would come back because the pizza wasn't half bad and their prices better than most things you would get in Vegas.  It did the job and the job well, normally I would rate someplace like Sirrico's Pizza at 3 stars, but considering the portion and value especially compared to all the other places in Vegas that way over charge you, it's worth rounding up to 4 stars.  If you're looking for something cheap, reasonable, and filling, Sirrico's Pizza is probably one of the best values you will find in Vegas, 4 stars."}
{"text":"Are you F'n kiddin' me?! This place is shameful, beyond ghetto and a sad excuse for anything remotely close to proper NYC pizza. Was there this summer and craving a slice in the middle of the strip. Shoulda Yelped for one and held off, but caved and settled for an air conditioned quick-fix...hence Sirrico's. The slices seemed thin enough. So we took a chance and ordered up a cheese slice and another w/o sauce aka \"white\". Fiasco.  A family in front already had a beef going with the pizza boy, who didn't give a *?!% as to what was happening and treated them poorly. When we ordered, I thought, \"Now, why isn't this fool heating up the slices?\" as is the standard in every other pizza joint. The pies were petrified and might have been salvaged with a simple 2-min. reheat. But the jackass didn't care, and we were admittedly foolish not to demand it (sometimes we like to see what happens and then turn to the commentary and reviews for a proper lashing). So...here we are, kvetching about the god-awful-sorry-excuse-for-a-New York-pizza in a place called New York New York! Time to send in the mob to clean up the joint 'cause it's despicable. Next time, we'll opt for Nathan's or the deli next door. What a joke! Shame on you..."}
{"text":"This place is good if you want a quick and cheap bite to eat. They are also open very late so it's convenient. I usually get the Sicilian pizza because you can get full off one slice. If you are a Hawaiian Pizza lover don't bother because they don't carry Pineapples ....I keep checking every time I go. The Pizza is all pre made they will have choices like pepperoni, vegetarian , cheese but nothing extravagant. When you choose your slice they just reheat it for you. They also offer garlic bread, and salads as side items. It's perfect if you are on the run and don't have a lot of time on your hands."}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time with a buddy of mine to chow down on pizza and lasagna. Now, I don't go out of my way for it so much.   This place used to be so good, man. Like, super good. They had amazing pizza, though the prices were high. Still, we'd come here every other weekend. We were regulars, and it was our opinion at the time that the pizza here could not be beat.   That was then. Now, it seems that their pizza is less awesome. I don't know whether that's because the quality has indeed dropped, or maybe it's because I've gotten used to it and now I expect amazing things from this this place. Their lasagna is still good, though I'm certain that it has dropped in quality from where it used to be.   Because the pizza here is more expensive, it's easy for you to spend $15 on a meal here. Not that it's not worth it, but it just seems kinda pricey. The cool thing is that it's inside the NYNY, so you can eat a ton and then kinda walk around for a little and do the tourist thing. That way you don't feel super bad about eating so much!"}
{"text":"I typically don't review pizza places because, well, basically LA pizza is pure garbage. I've been all over Southern Cali looking for the good stuff and it always turns out to be over hyped and over priced cardboard.  I love going to the NYNY hotel for the ambiance and this particular pizza joint. It's nestled between a steakhouse, Chinese restaurant, piano bar and a deli. The pizza here is so delicious that I crave it often but unfortunately I live 300 miles away. For $4 you get a big piece of quality pizza that truly is reminiscent of The big Apple! Foldable, nice yeasty dough, perfect amount of toppings (mushroom is my favorite) and cute lasagnas that come in the little square tin container it was baked in. I typically like to have my slice(s) put back into the oven for a minute to make it a little crunchier but their slices are not typically soggy/saggy in nature.   You can take your slice out to the tables that sit amongst the New York themed corridor...cool feeling indeed!   Big plus because they are open until 3am!!!!  Get a slice or take a whole pie back to your room and enjoy."}
{"text":"One of the few places open late. There were two guys looking at a pizza in the oven when I got there, they looked at me and kept checking the pizza. Guess the pizza was more important than greeting a customer.(the oven is right in the front)  Then another guy came from the back and just looked at me, so I took it he would help me. Told him which slice I wanted. Asked if anything else. No, so I proceeded to the cashier.  The guy and girl by the beer tap right before the cashier were too busy talking to each other to ask if I wanted anything to drink.   Went to cashier grabbed a soda from the fridge, paid and got the hell outta there!   Customer service, non existant. Pizza just alright. If there was another choice to eat I would've gone there instead."}
{"text":"Popped in for a slice of pizza on the way up to the room after a day of meetings (and NOT drinking unfortunately).  Was taken back by the $10.22 charge for a single slice of pizza but didn't say anything because everything in Vegas is costly and the girl at the counter wouldn't even make eye contact.  Looking through my receipts to fill out expenses I see I was charged $3.50 for a large soda that I didn't order or receive.  Guessing this is just a way to take advantage of people and rip them off even more.  Not impressed Sirrico's!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing, reasonably priced. You can even take it into the fun piano bar next door!"}
{"text":"New York-New York and pizza go together like a horse and carriage. Sirrico's Pizza is the New York  pizzeria in New York - New York's Greenwich Village. A couple of Saturday's previous, this transplanted New Yorker would put Sirrico's to the test.     It was a busy Saturday night on the Las Vegas Strip. Walking from Fashion Show Mall towards Mandalay Bay, I was up to a light dinner. Secret Pizza was packed. So, I'd drop into New York -New York to finally try Sirrico's Pizza. I'd seen there sign advertising a slice of pizza with a beer for $7.77. However, I never saw the pizza up close. It did not look too appealing. Something about it sitting under the lights. The presentation of the food from the pizza to the pasta, reminded me more of Sbarraros than a legendary pizza parlor from New York. I opted out of pizza and ordered the meatball sub.   When I ordered the meatball sub, the cook informed me that it would take five minutes. No sweat! I'd take in the detailed replica of Greenwich Village. I have always admired New York - New York's attention to the New York -New York motif from the steam coming out of a manhole cover to the balconies up above. Way above me, I'd overhear the careening Manhattan Express roller coaster. Down the cobblestone street, Billy Kraus belted out the classics in the Times Square Dueling Piano Bar. In a New York -New York moment time goes fast.    The meatball sub failed to put me in a New York state of mind. It just wasn't very good. Honestly, the meatball marinara at Subway is better. I appreciated that they spent five minutes making the meatball sub. The upshot is that the cheese was hot and delectable. However, I had a below average opinion of the meatballs, which they did give a generous amount of. As I stated earlier in this review, the majority of the food is sitting in trays under lights. This includes the meatballs. When he made my meatball sub, it appeared that he took the meatballs from the tray and reheated it. The outcome was a sub made up of warm and tasty cheese with uninspiring meatballs on ordinary tasting bread. By the time I finished the meatball sub, it was obvious that I will ride the Manhattan Express before ordering it again.    In conclusion, I understand  that New York-New York  and pizza go together like a horse and carriage. However, I believe that a world renown resort of New York -New York's stature needs a New York renown pizzaria."}
{"text":"I LOVVVE the pizza here for a quick late night bite in Vegas!  I go here many nights each visit.  I really do not know why the low star rating...the taste is great, always seems decently fresh, its quick and the crust is to die for ... YUM!"}
{"text":"This place is located inside New York New York and has some great pizza. We came for lunch and late night snack.   The pepperoni pizza is soo good and greasy... And this place is open until 4am btw so set your alarm for 345 do you can run over from the club."}
{"text":"The line to eat pizza here was simply amazing.  I think that there were more people waiting to get a slice of pie than there were at all the slot machines on the floor of New York, New York.  Of course, it seemed like they were doing some kind of remodeling, so that could have had something to do with it.  At any rate, the wait really wasn't worth it.  The pizza was okay, and it wasn't terribly pricey, but I won't really say that it was very good either.  You do get to select from a few slices, and the overall taste is decent.  The good news is that you don't have to wait (other than the aforementioned line, which does fluctuate).  That's an important factor at certain times, like when you are just tired of walking around and around and trying to find something to eat.  The bad news is that you then have to figure out where to eat it, and there are only a handful of tables to sit at in the Little Italy section of the casino, and most of them are always full.  Even if you get to sit, you get to listen to a really bad piano bar across the way.  It'll do in a pinch, but it's just not that great."}
{"text":"Omg pepperoni jalapeño and mushrooms is the way to go!!! The mushrooms were fresh and the jalapeños were the perfect measure of spice. Definitely worth the walk. Super fun environment... Live music from the bar across the way. Available sitting to ppl watch and conversate. I will be coming back for more my next trip to Vegas"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped and shared a slice.  OUTSTANDING!  One of the best NY style pizzas I've ever had. Crust was perfect!  Nice crunch on the bottom and perfect amount of chew.....I'm ready to go back!"}
{"text":"The pizza looked good behind the counter, but when the worker handed it to me straight off the pan instead of toasting/warming it up in the oven behind him first, I was already disappointed. This was in NYNY casino and we pictured fresh and hot NY style pizza after all. The pay line moved very slowly and I really wish I could have just left the slice on the counter and walked away. There was absolutely nothing great or even good about the slice of cheese pizza. It lacked sauce, flavor, and was barely warm when I started eating, and for a NY slice of pizza, it wasn't very big."}
{"text":"Great pizza for the price as everything on the strip is so expensive.  Had these guys 2 times while in Vegas and we were huge fans of them.  If your looking for something fast that's good pizza and cheap stop here!!!"}
{"text":"I actually went there last week hoping to get a pizza, but when I saw how large the slices were compared to how small my appetite was I knew I had to order something else. Luckily for me, they had lasagna on the menu. I thought it was completely delicious. I don't think it was worth $9, but more like $7. I would definitely go there again."}
{"text":"The funny thing is that this pizza is good, but the flavor only okay.  It isn't greasy so that's one redeeming quality. The sauce isn't sweet like fresh tomato sauce. It's okay because I have tasted better the first time."}
{"text":"Nice spot for a quick bite before going to see Zumanity! The pizza was hot and fresh and the slice was huge!   I haven't been to the real NYC yet but I imagine this is similar to what they have there and for me I really enjoyed the pizza!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here. It's nothing special, really - just like going to a Sbarro at the mall. The pizza is placed in a warming area, waiting for you to pick what you want.   I had the mushroom pizza, and was impressed with how there was actually a ton of mushroom on the slice. There wasn't a single bite without a piece of mushroom. I added a bit of oregano, some garlic powder, and of course the peppers. It really hit the spot!  I would recommend this place when it is super late (think 130am), and you have the munchies. It is quick, and compared to everything else open at that hour, it is cheap. The service was attentive and friendly, even at that time of the night. Would definitely go again, when I am out on the Strip late."}
{"text":"This was the best pizza I had while I was in Las Vegas! I actually found it by mistake while I was staying at the MGM across the street, but glad I found it.  I'm from New York, and I actually found their slices to be outstanding! And the ambience of where it is located within the casino can't be beat. You walk down a cobblestone alley and there it is. I'll definitely be back next time in town..."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place on the strip. It's in the middle of New York New York casino, near Gallaghers steakhouse... You can get a square cut that is a thicker crust or a slice which is thinner. Lots of varieties already made and you can also order whole pizzas. Ordering, serving and paying is quick but sometimes there's a long line around dinner or lunch. I find myself coming back over and over again."}
{"text":"4 stars because it is near the elevators and you can easily grab a slice as you try to stumble back to your room late at night. I think i had at least one slice a day, as it is pretty good pie for being so cheap. I always got the pepperoni and jalapeno. And as everyone knows, it can be super hard finding ANYTHING cheap in Vegas, so i was happy that i didn't have to end my night with a $30 late night snack."}
{"text":"For a pizza joint in New York New York, Sirrico's would have been better off selling NY style pizza.  The pizza that they sell tastes EXACTLY like Costco pizza.  Don't believe me?  Try ordering their vegetarian pizza and you'll understand what I mean.  For almost the same price, you can go to Secret Pizza @ Cosmopolitan and eat some real pizza instead of whatever that they're serving here."}
{"text":"I was in the same Co. as Kate S, previous. Although, I decided to skip the greasy pizza and get... wait for it... a greasy meatball sandveech! \"Meatball Hero\" I believe it was called... Not bad. The meatballs were nothing special. Gradually losing my appetite, I just dumped those and ate the cheesy & saucy bread."}
{"text":"By far my favorite pizza in Vegas. The round is tasty but this spot is all about the Sicilian slices. It isn't a cheap slice but so worth it. The toppings are plentiful, the cheese is fresh and they do a great job with the crust. Crispy outside. Soft in the middle.  Could not recommend it enough"}
{"text":"This is basically fast food pizza, but it is YUMMY ! My family and I love the ambiance where the tables to sit and eat are. The meat balls and garlic bread are sooooo good too. This is always a go to place for my family when we go to Las Vegas . The service is good, the place is clean, and you get your food right away."}
{"text":"This is a decent slice in the middle of a casino and it hit the spot.   I don't usually read other people's reviews to inform how I feel about a place, but there are some bizarre opinions out there about what pizza is supposed to taste like. I've noticed that, in general, people from outside of the east coast aren't used to New York-style pizza slices, and they seem confused and turned off by a place that serves it. So just keep that in mind."}
{"text":"Under rated!!! Thee stars really?  So better then secret pizza at thee cosmo."}
{"text":"I was surprised by how good this pizza really is!  I was thinking it was just going to be like mall pizza... however, the toppings are really yummy.  We sometimes go to the New York New York just for the pizza if we get a late-night craving.  They always seem to have pizzas out that have lots of black olives on them (my favorite!!)."}
{"text":"Probably one of the worst slices of pizza I've ever had.  The line was ridiculously long, and they didn't have any regular cheese pizza slices, so I had to get a slice of sicilian, which was doughy, tasteless, and underdone.  My dad got a slice of pepperoni pizza, which was also underdone.  His caesar salad was awful as well.  We were lucky enough to at least get a table, but we could've gone to McDonald's and left more satisfied."}
{"text":"Delicious. Hot. Fresh!!  I would recommend the Sicilian style pizza over New York style.  It's the square shaped pieces with a thicker, fluffier, more buttery crust.  We shared a slice of the italian sausage and tomato pizza that just came out the oven.  OMG.   One slice and and a soda drink was $10.  Pretty pricey, but hey, it's Vegas.  I would come back again if I was at New York New York Casino & Hotel."}
{"text":"Not a fan of their square pizza but love their cheese thin round pizza. Yum yum, 2 slices yesterday at NYNY $10.72 with tax hit the spot. Bonus was all of the hockey excitement and entertainment throughout prior to Game 5 Stanley Cup Finals. We enjoy the atmosphere eating on the \"streets\" outside of this pizza place."}
{"text":"Eeeeeee... Maybe it wasn't that tasty because it was 1 am and I cannot say how long my slice had been sitting out. But um, not good.  We pretty much stumbled into New York New York and decided we needed some food in our bodies. Most of the other decent looking places in the Casino were closed, and so pizza it was. We tried ordering a whole pie to share between our group -- but the wait time was 45 minutes which was ridiculous so we just grabbed whatever slices were available.  $4.50 later I was noshing on a rubbery sad piece of cheese pizza. No amount of extra parmesan or chili flakes could redeem said pizza. I didn't even eat the crust -- which if you know me is one of my favorite things on a piece of pie. I can see why Bourdain was horrified with this place -- just mediocre and not worth the hefty price tag. Casino inflation or no."}
{"text":"Was ok for pizza in a big hotel on the strip but was quite expensive 3 slices and 2 sodas came to $25 dollars Yikes!!!"}
{"text":"It's like $8 for a beer and slice of pizza. How anyone can complain about that being overpriced is beyond me.   Don't be insane and expect that this is going to be NYC quality slice. This is just a good slice of pizza at a reasonable price. If you're looking for higher end pizza in Vegas you've got plenty of options.  Some customers were slamming the counters and screaming at the staff for no reason and the staff handled it very professionally. They probably deal with their a lot of drunks and I think it would be hard to remain patient like that. Respect to the staff."}
{"text":"Nothing better than a bunch of pizza to ease a night of debauchery. Decent cheap pizza by the slice in New York or Sicilian styles and a decent cannolli."}
{"text":"Food is delicious and staff is very friendly. Both the Sicilian style and thin crust are very good. Also convenient because it's inside New York, New York!"}
{"text":"Sirricos is my kind of pizza joint!  It doesn't get much better than enjoying a hot slice of pizza and a cold beer while watching drunk fools stumble out of Gonzalez y Gonzalez club at 1:00 am.  The pizza here is obviosly New York style, since it is located inside of New York New York Casino.  The crust and cheese are thin, and the toppings are neat and organized.  The sausage they use is thinly sliced Italian sausage placed directly onto the pizza (none of that ground meat looking stuff here).  They usually have a $6.99 for a slice of pizza and a Busch light deal going, which is an awesome deal considering that's what you pay for just the beer at most bars.  This is the perfect place to go when you feel like chilling and eating after a long night on the strip.  As good as it gets in my book!"}
{"text":"Great slice of classic Italian pie! Exactly what I was looking for. The traditional is thin and bends over, but they have square thick Sicilian as well. Traditional is the kind you have to fold a little for rigidity. Loved the pepperoni and sliced sausage."}
{"text":"I eat here almost every time I go to Vegas and it's always been good. Thin crust pizza and honestly not even casino ripoff prices if you grab a whole pie (~$20). If this place was where I live I'd probably pick it over almost all of the local pizza places . Honestly eating here is a nice change of pace from the typical food you get in Vegas and a great place to grab a bite on a budget."}
{"text":"Was in New york New York gambling and wanted a cheap dinner, so enter Sirrico's. They have about 10-12 different selections on pizza (with a slice costing about $5-$6 a piece). I tried their pepperoni and Pepperoni and Sausage New York Slices (Both were really really good) and their pepperoni sicilian slice (good, could use more sauce). Overall If your not looking to spend much and are in New York New York, give this place a try."}
{"text":"Great pizza my husbands a pizza snob.  He loves this pizza.  We always stop and get a slice every trip.  Really good pizza by the slice."}
{"text":"Sirrico's was the perfect place for a pre-show snack before Zumanity.  For about six dollars I got a GIANT slice of Hawaiian pizza with perfect chewy crust.  May not be the best restaurant in Vegas, but if you're pressed for time and want a quick bite in the streets of New York, New York, it's an excellent choice."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and the pizza is always, fresh, hot, and tasty...especially for a place on the strip. The prices aren't bad either for  a large slice in Vegas so this place is perfect for a quick bite on the strip."}
{"text":"Good pasta dishes, but the garlic bread is extremely greasy. Service was good, didn't have to wait long at all. Not bad at all especially if you are hungover. Its right next to the piano bar so you have a little entertainment after you get your meal. It is worth checking out if you are looking for quick, cheap Italian."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza! Seriously, the flavor and texture is on point. Great for a quick slice. Staff was friendly too and price reasonable."}
{"text":"This place started off my Vegas trip right...as a NYer, I'm constantly in the hunt for NY pizza, and to see that they have sicilian slices was AMAZING (if you're from NY you know the diff between that and the regular pie).  They do lose a star for their sicilian only being so so.  The crust left room for improvement.  And the pizza and beer combo...really can you go wrong with that?  I think not!    If only they had had cannolis available when I was there.  Minor ding for being out of those as well.  But I'll be back next visit, and hopefully they'll be fully stocked then."}
{"text":"Great prices for the slice, pizza was very delicious. Definitely recommend Sirrico's!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE. The pizza is so bland and tastes just like basic domino's or Pizza Hut crap. If you're a New Yorker like myself don't even waste your time. Paid $17 for 2 slices and a drink. $7 a slice?! Nah."}
{"text":"Grabbed a slice of pepperoni and mushroom pizza late one night on our way back up to our room at New York, New York Hotel. I was really hungry, and this hit the spot! It was tasty, chewy, greasy, cheesy and big! And it came with a cold beer!"}
{"text":"So delicious. Will definitely eat here again. The line went out the door, and there were no trays left (cafeteria style) because they were slammed at 2am!!!"}
{"text":"Located in the New York New York Casino.  This pizza joint resemble NYC with the NY atmosphere from the  decor and the music from the piano bar next to the pizza restaurant.  The pizza is delicious and taste like the pizza from the Bronx.  The large pizza slice, thin crust, and sauce resemble the same taste and texture from NYC.  This is one of my favorite eatery spot when I go to Vegas. Go CUSE!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stayed at the New York New York hotel for about a week. We ordered room service one night and had decided on a cheese and pepperoni pizza! I honestly wasn't expecting much, but I was so wrong! We absolutely loved our pizza! And we love to try new things and especially pizza! It's honestly one of the best, fresh tasting, and new York style pizzas we've ever had! The dough was light and thin and crunchy. With the most simple, robust and fresh tomatoe sauce topped with creamy mozzarella! With the best spicy pepperoni ever! It was was a huge pizza with huge slices!! Just like new york! We even ate it cold! Great pizza! If you have palet for fresh, original and quality pizza....this is the place to stop by! Even if I didn't stay at New York New York, I would drive the extra mile to come here to get a good pizza! So worth it. Simple and delicious!"}
{"text":"Okay so you're looking for a cheap bite in Vegas this is a great spot. $5 dollars a slice bigger than your plate is not bad but get a whole pizza for $22 that includes 6 slices now we are talking. They sauce has good flavor and the chees almost stretches about 5 inches when you take the first bite. I enjoyed the flavor but don't forget that most dining reviews in Vegas are taken with a grain of salt. Much of us were very intoxicated during this dining experience. I was look enough to be accompanied with two sober family members that both really liked their pizza slices. Drinks and entertainment well it's Vegas so enough said."}
{"text":"Preceding our visit to Zumanity, we snagged a few slices from Sirrico's. The food was slightly overpriced, but decent tasting. I had a Sicilian and a NY style slice. The slices were good, but mediocre pizza overall.  If we're pressed for time and hungry, Sirrico's may be a place to go. I won't go out of my way to go there, and won't be craving their pizza either."}
{"text":"When In New York you should stop for a slice of pizza; Therefore, when in New York , New York Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada you might as well do the same.  Every time I go to Vegas I find myself at this place at some point during my trip.  I do not recommend getting any old slices because they are not good.  However, any slice fresh out of the oven is really good for a good price....okay....lets just say a good price for the Vegas Strip."}
{"text":"We stopped in after clubbing at Tao Beach and met up with some new friends from our flight down.   Pizza slices are large and the crust is on the thick side. Not my cup of tea but at 2am when you're slightly inebriated and all you want are carbs then this is a good place.   Also the cobblestone walkways of New York, New York were wreaking havoc on my girlfriends feet so sitting down at the table and chairs was a great choice, especially for the people watching.   New York, New York if you are reading this review, please install moving pedways that look like cobblestone walkways. You'd revolutionize getting around in Las Vegas.   Thanks for reading."}
{"text":"Ugh!! I'm surprised this place got this many good reviews. I'm sorry but I'm hesitant about giving it 3 stars but I felt it was just ok, maybe even subpar.  For the price, ranging $4.95 for cheese to $5.50 with toppings, the price is competitive to the others in Vegas.  The pizzas may LOOK like NYC but that's about it. The only taste my slice had going was the sauce. The dough had no taste, and was chewy like cardboard. My drooling taste buds was really hoping the experience would take me back to my visit to NYC but it failed. Even the cheese was blah! I couldn't even finish the slice and tossed it away.  What we SHOULD have done was gone with our first choice... Secret Pizza at Cosmopolitan. Well, I was still hungry I made Stephen walk to Cosmo with me and got the White pizza at Secret Pizza. Best decision of the night.  Sorry folks but there's better pizza. Don't let the aroma fool you. The service is rude, and not in the NYC way, and the food is a step above cafeteria. It's just OK."}
{"text":"I have stopped here on both trips to Vegas and thoroughly enjoyed my slice of cheese pizza each time. Perhaps around $5 is a bit pricy for a slice of cheese pizza, but I still thought it was damn good and crust perfect. Despite long lines, they were very quick, too."}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza I've tried. Nvr had the thin sliced but I'm crazy about the Sicilian style! A must try if at NyNy. Price is about $7 for a slice. Worth it!"}
{"text":"Do NOT order a whole pizza pie here!!!  You think you're getting a good deal, but you'll be sorry.  We literally waited over 45 minutes for our pizza (they said it would take 15-20 minutes).  After asking several more times and waiting for 20+ more minutes -- during which time they actually yelled at us, lied and claimed that the hold up was due to ordering a half vegetarian, half pepperoni pizza (totally not true considering they told us it was fine when we ordered it) -- we FINALLY received our pizza, and it was completely undercooked!!  UNACCEPTABLE.  I was so annoyed at this point that I took it back and asked them (as nicely as I could muster) to put it back in the oven.  Several minutes of waiting (I'm sensing a pattern here, ha ha), we finally dug into our pie.  The flavor was okay, but it was still  undercooked.  WTF!  Service at Sirrico's is beyond horrendous.  We were not the only ones who were put through this ordeal.  There were at least 2 other groups waiting for their pies, and everyone was seriously pissed off!  I can't believe this place is still in business.  Stay away at all costs!  Or if you absolutely must have pizza at 3am while you're already in NY NY casino, only order by the slice!!!"}
{"text":"I'm actually a bit surprised at all the negative reviews on this place, but I do have to agree that long lines and inconsistent quality are the main culprits. However, whenever I'm in Vegas and anywhere near NY NY hotel, I try to make it to Sirrico's. But I don't necessarily come away buying a slice of pizza. Let me explain.   If you are absolutely craving any type of pizza and you see a long line, then by all means wait it out. But if there's no line, go to the counter and check out the pizza on display. Does the crust look pale and lifeless? Does the pizza look fresh? Or does it look like it's been sitting out for a couple hours, looking cold and limp? I don't know about you, but if I'm forking over $4-5 for a slice, and waiting in line, it'd better be worth it. I've had pizza in New York and in the east coast, and I know what I want.   The key is to get a slice that is piping hot, straight from the oven. Look for the crust to be slightly charred, and should look crispy. Sometimes you'll ask for a sausage or mushroom, and the dude will give you their wannabe \"New York\" attitude and say they don't have any. Just brush it off. It doesn't matter, make a small sacrifice and just take whatever type of pizza that just came from the oven. Wait if you have to. Usually it's pepperoni. They almost always have pepperoni."}
{"text":"Every time I go to Las Vegas I make sure I stop by Sirrico's for two slices of pizza and a beer. The place is centrally located smack down in the middle of NYNY. The pizza is fantastic and is reasonably priced for Vegas. The slices are huge, juicy, and quite flavorful. And you can pick up a slice anytime of day. Afternoon after sweating your buns off walking the strip, at dawn after seeing the neens and peens bounce around after watching Zummanity, or three in the morning after being denied booty from a tranny midget.     The only thing that sucks is the staff. You can tell they hate their job. I have a feeling there is a tough old Italian woman back there with a giant belt who beats them regularly."}
{"text":"A slice of pizza is approximately 5.95 which includes tax. So I had two slices of pizza throughout the day: pepperoni with jalapeno and pepperoni with mushroom. Well, the pepperoni with jalapeno was okay. The trick is to ask for them to reheat the slices as they probably have been sitting out for a while for public display. I would imagine that the slice of pizza would have been better warmer. So later on after a long night of partying, I decided to grab another slice to soak up that alcohol. This time, I remembered to heat it up and it tasted fantastic. They were quite accommodating to putting that slice in a box for me even though they had ran out of smaller boxes."}
{"text":"Their pizza is VERY good! Love their Sicilian style pizza. I haven't tried any of their other menu offerings, but will do so next time I'm there.  I bent the rules a bit. When you leave the pizza shop, turn left and sit on a little cafe` table around the corner in front of Gallagher's restaurant. They offer a full bar and a wider selection of beer. The cafe` tables are a great place to people watch, too."}
{"text":"Overall: Not sure what's up with others but this is hands down the best pizza I've  eatin in Vegas under one stipulation, only if it's fresh out the oven! I love this pizza and beats many local favorites in the bay area.   Plate: I dream about there soft doughy crust and smoking hot melted cheese and slightly crisp pepperonis.  Really really good late night party food.   Recommend: 5 STAR if it's freshly cooked. Make sure lots of people I front if you so you get a slice that just came out! Yes Will be a top Recommendation to anyone visiting Vegas."}
{"text":"In Vegas, it's hard to beat a slice and a Rolling Rock for $7, so I take the deals when I get em. Reminds me of a Sbarro's from back home. Slices could've used some seasoning...Garlic, salt, pepper...all needed to be added to the ZA. And how about throwing them in the oven for a quick reheat?! Plenty of choices pizza-wise, and a few Italian classics find the menu as well. Our gyro and pepperoni slice went down quick, not a whole lot of complaining. A little more effort and I think the place would welcome more repeat customers as opposed to the first time gamblers and stumblers. Late night... it's a helluva meal."}
{"text":"By far the worst pizza I have ever had. Adding that this is NYC style pizza is embarrassing. Burnt black crust and half cooked Sicilian slices. Barf."}
{"text":"Worst pizza ever. Sausage was sliced type not real Italian sausage. Crust was soggy and service was awful. Would never come here again. Expect more from. A place that is supposed to be real NY style pizza. Stay away"}
{"text":"Pretty decent pizza for a quick meal. It's way better than the pizza place upstairs! Oh, they have a beer and a slice of pizza combo for like $ 7! (3/6/12)"}
{"text":"All three times I've came to Vegas, I've ate at Sirrico's pizza. The pizza is good, but it's even better when your buzzed/drunk coming out of a nightclub. LOL. Next time your trying to find a place to eat after the club, go to Sirrico's. Your stomach will thank you for it."}
{"text":"It was about 12 am and my family and I were craving pizza. We were walking around for about 20 minutes looking for a place that was both promising and open haha a task which was harder than we thought!!   We came across this place on the first floor of New York New York and decided to give it a go. A slice was about $6 and a whole pie was $25, so we decided to just order a whole pizza, cause it just would have been a couple dollars more.   The pizza was humongous!! Very crispy and worth the 15 minutes wait!   My only complaint is that the staff looked as if they hated their lives. They gave me a look when I ordered a whole pizza cause it meant that they had to turn around, distribute pepperoni on a cheese pizza, and bake it for a couple minutes. That rubbed me the wrong way, because I was in a happy mood and excited to devour some pizza. Put a damper on my mood. Plus I'm really big on customer service.    However, the product was great and hit the spot. Would eat this pizza again hundreds of times more!"}
{"text":"Totally overpriced and under taste, not worth the purchase!!! I totally wish that I could be provided a full refund!!!I threw over half of the dayum near $7.00 slice of pizza away.!!! Pist total waste of money!!! Slices should be a buck!"}
{"text":"THE ORDER Pizza - What else  YIPPEEEE Disclaimer: I'm a Chicago girl myself                But this is the best New York Pizza in town They stay open till like 2am  BOOO NOTHING, A huge crunchy delicious slice of cheesy goodness                      what is their to bitch about"}
{"text":"This place is one of the number one reasons I stay at NYNY! I love pizza at 3am after a night out in Vegas!  Pizza is really good! It's so hard to decide sometimes which pizza to get! My favorite is the cheese pizza!"}
{"text":"The first thing I like about this place is that they are open until 3am on Sunday. I was hungry late at night and there aren't many options after 10 or 11 usually on the strip.  We were going to try shake shak a couple doors down but the line looked long and I didn't want to wait (But we won't leave vegas without trying shake shak). I had the lasagna which comes with garlic bread and it was delicious. My boyfriend had the slice of pizza with beer deal ($7.77) and that was also good! I'm glad we came here to eat. (Located inside the NY NY hotel near the piano bar)."}
