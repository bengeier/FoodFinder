{"text":"I'm always surprised at how hard it is to find good Pad Thai but this was always good. Service was usually good. I would do both sit down and carry out and had good experiences with both.  Mainly remember this place for the solid Pad Thai. Nice people. Cash only."}
{"text":"Rising Sons is a fine addition to the State Street line-up. Madison can't seem to get enough of southeast Asian cuisine and it is great to have this establishment so close to campus. I appreciate the bar (watch your step!), where it is convenient to take a meal solo in the middle of intense study/writing days in the library. The food has all the Thai/Laotian standards plus some bonuses not typically on other menus, such as: beef jerky, pork buns, and many wonderful soup options. Their tom kha might be the best in town since Sukhothai went out of business. However, one warning: their food is SALTY!! I am a salt-aholic, so if I'm commenting about it you know it is a problem! I cannot seem to drink enough water for many hours after eating there. Nonetheless, I am a happy and devoted Rising Sons regular... See you at the bar."}
{"text":"I must have walked by this place a thousand times--I think that perhaps the name of the restaurant confused me a bit, because \"Rising Sons Deli\" doesn't evoke Thai and Laotian cuisine in my mind. But this last Saturday, as I was idly waiting for my sister near our usual meet-up spot, I happened to look at the menu. I was intrigued, and convinced my sister to give it a try with me. We stopped in at 11:30: the place was deserted, which always makes me a tad nervous. On the other hand, the Packer game was about to start, so...we decided to risk it. It was flippin' cold outside, so I wanted soup: pho, to be exact. I was informed by the friendly waiter that they were out of the type I wanted, so I ordered their standard pho with beef and meatballs. My sister ordered the pad Thai. I would say that both dishes were solid, but not rave-worthy. I'm accustomed to pho being served with a separate plate piled high with herbs (basil is a MUST!), sprouts, and jalapeños--but mine came out with a tiny smattering of cilantro and a few sprouts in the bowl. I had to ask for fish sauce and sriracha. That being said, the broth had a really nice flavor, and the soup was really tasty overall. From my one bite of the sis' pad Thai, it seemed very tasty.   All in all, we weren't blown away, but we weren't disappointed either. And the fact that there are three Pokéstops in range of the restaurant didn't hurt. AND, I almost forgot: NO CARDS ACCEPTED. Luckily, sis had cash, but, despite the signage explaining the credit card ban, I'm sure that there have been \"situations\"."}
{"text":"Good food, massive portions (soup), reasonably fast service."}
{"text":"My fave food: Som Tum Thai (Green Papaya Salad) with beef jerky and sticky rice. I love the green papaya salad and beef jerky, but always put the sticky rice aside (and my husband usually eats it, lol). Score: 3.5/5 Foods to avoid: fried rice (oily, tasted like Maggie soy sauce/fish sauce, score: 1/5). Different curry dishes. I have tried the chicken red curry, panaeng curry, and pork green cury; none of them were very satisfying (score: 1/5). I actually felt bad for this place, but I have been going to this place so many times because of its convenient location on State Street. What can I say, I am just not a fan.."}
{"text":"Let's get the important point out of the way first. ~~ Cash only ~~  This was one of the first places I visited when I initially set food in Madison years and years ago, so it brings back many fond memories. I remember being impressed with their Penang Green Curry. As for all their curries, you get a choice of tofu, meat or shrimp (shrimps come at an extra). For the green curry there're eggplant and bamboo shoots, some of my favorite ingredients in my curry. It also comes with generous serving of rice to go with the rich curry gravy.  Over the course of several years we've been through almost the entire menu. I like their curries, noodle soups, tom yum and drunken noodles. But sad to say I think things have changed somewhat, on my recent trips I've been less impressed with Rising Sons. Maybe the saying that your appetite changes over time is true? Or maybe there are a lot of newer options that are more refreshing popping up in town over the years. Not imagining myself going back unless things change back to the way they were before."}
{"text":"Horrible for delivery. Tiny tiny portions, looked like it had packed by a blind person (spilling everywhere) and the worst Tom Kai I ever had."}
{"text":"Grabbed a late lunch to go -- green curry with shrimp.  It was nicely spicy and piping hot.  Although I prefer my curry sauces a bit thicker. Cute courtyard with bistro tables and lanterns. Cash only."}
{"text":"This was always a favorite place when we were in college, and coming back to it now it's still just as good. Their noodle dishes and fried rice are really great- the Drunken Noodles with tofu (and some added chili sauce) is my favorite!  Decor is super weird because this place used to be a 50s diner and they never redecorated, but if you can get over that, it's fine :)  Don't forget- this place is CASH ONLY!"}
{"text":"I like the fried rice with fish sauce.  It is a convenient place to eat because it's at the start of state st"}
{"text":"I like this place. You have to know the menu a little though. I like the chicken noodle bowl order, and I also like the fried rice orders. It's always 10 bucks and they don't take cards. But it's a relatively fast an decent option for the $ on state street. It's also obviously a family run restaurant, and I just feel like, it seems they are good people."}
{"text":"Tom Yum noodle soup at the Rising Sons Deli. (Yes, it's called a deli, but it's all Thai/Laos food here.)  Very rustic soup that's hot/salty/sweet/fish sauce broth that's cooled by the coriander and lemongrass. Chicken meatballs are superfluous. The minced pork just sneaks in at the end. So good."}
{"text":"get the tum yum shrimp soup, it is by far the best in down. I also enjoyed the papya salad, but be warned it is quite spicy. Ask for this medium, not hot!"}
{"text":"First time for one star. Very disappointing lunch. The dish I got was the only one i saw that said \"very spicy\" on the menu. I don't remember the name but  It was described as containing chilis and Thai basil with your choice of meat - I got beef. The dish I received had no chilis or basil. It was hamburger cooked in oil with frozen vegetables. Yes hamburger - i have never before received hamburger when getting a beef dish at any type of Asian restaurant. There was nothing dicernably Thai about it. Nor did it have any, and i mean any, heat to it.  Most 1 star reviews concern service - the service here was fine. But it was the worst excuse for a Thai dish I ever received and I will never be back."}
{"text":"On the door it says that they're supposed to open from 11am onwards on a Saturday. Only at 11:05am and after several attempts to get the owner's attention from outside did we manage to get in. If not for the long lines in every other restaurant along State Street, we would've given up a long time ago.   - Duck noodle soup: I tasted the soup, and it was really tasty and flavorful! Definitely try this if you want a failure-proof dish.   - Tomyam noodle soup: This was really good too! I'm glad they didn't just use the plain tomyam paste because I could taste the shrimp flavor which made it better.   - Kao Poun: On the menu it says that this is coconut-based curry with noodles. Boy they weren't kidding about the coconut part. The coconut taste was way to overpowering and you can barely taste curry.   Overall, I wouldn't say that my experience here was bad, although I was a little ticked off my the owner's lack of punctuality at the beginning. If you're looking for mediocre cheap Asian food, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"LOVE! Great pad thai, hits the spot... its what i crave. First time about a month ago and have been going atleast twice a week since. Great service, food came quickly. No complaints whatsoever!"}
{"text":"The place has somehow room to improve but the food is not bad.  Friendly servers, sometimes being forgotten though; very slow but that's probably an authentic south East Asian feature. Food portion is pretty small, even for an Asian like me.  I like most food but last time the chicken satay tasted funny.    What I like about this place is, it really reminds us of our time in Cambodia, Thailand, Myanmar.  It mostly takes forever to wait for some simple dishes but their people are usually polite and friendly.  The food definitely has its authentic flavor, not the American/fusion one.   Also like the fact they are willing to  accommodate customer's special diet. Most Chinese restaurants, if operated by Chinese, won't do that. (Sauce mixed, or just say yes but comes out the same). They do try to make their customers happy, which is appreciated."}
{"text":"I love Rising Sons.  It's the perfect place to go for a good portion of lunch food at a great price.  I've had their Tom Yum soup, drunken noodles, penang curry, etc and all were cooked super well.  The flavors were there, and the spice was well represented (such that if I ordered spicy, it was actually spicy. If I ordered medium spice, it had a kick but not overpowering).  The servers are nice and attentive, and the food is great."}
{"text":"Cash only. Both Pad Thai Tofu & Tom Kha Gai very simple & solid. Unlike some Thai/Laotian restaurants in town, Tom Kha is seen as an entree, not an appetizer. So, it has chicken, mushrooms, baby corn, onions, galangal, lime leaves, etc. Both reheated well the next day. Red squash curry less interesting: chicken, squash, and broccoli. Flavor was good, but a little thin compared to Tom Kha. Definitely got hotter next day. I generally prefer squash curries that also have Thai eggplant. Pretty solid."}
{"text":"Pad Thai was good as was sticky rice with mango. Pad Thai is a large order; big enough to share between two people."}
{"text":"We came here wanting soup to fill the empty void left in our souls from midterms,  and it delivered  the crab rangoons were too good and the Tom Yum Soup was amazing (they substituted pork with chicken for me and it was the best) really nice and helpful server too !"}
{"text":"Best beef laab ever, and the drunken noodles are great too. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Came here with friends to nurse our freakfest hangover and was greeted with a delicious steamy bowl of noodles.   This place is PHO-real. The noodles were tasty and the broth game here is mad strong. I definitely recommend getting their duck noodles and tom yam noodles (spicy), as both broths were on a different flavor level compared to the others.   Just thinking about the noodles is making my mouth water again. I'm definitely coming returning again if I ever find myself in madison.   However, they do have some flaws. One being they only take cash, so remember to hit the atm before. Another being the inconsistent portions of meat in the noodles, which would be an issue for gluttons like myself.   Overall, I think it's a hidden gem in madison with cheap food at pretty respectable quality."}
{"text":"I like Rising Sons. Definitely always hit up this place when I need a nice home cooked meal. I used to always order their chicken fried rice, but recently they haven't really been cooking the chicken well done, and I'm really picky about chicken! So I switched to the coconut yell curry... SO DELICIOUS. I mean, it was just so good. Pad Thai, Tom yum soup, egg rolls, sticky rice ice cream dessert are all amazing. Give this place a try! Also, cash only so don't forget that!"}
{"text":"I have eaten 3 times at Rising Sons over the years. Each time my experience has been more disappointing than the last. I recently dined there early on a Saturday evening before ushering at Overture. I needed a meal that would hold me til late evening without my feeling weighed down.  I ate the green chicken curry. I found the sauce somewhat flavorful but extremely thin. I even sent it back once and it came back to me just about the same. The waitress stated that this was normal recipe. I liked the Thai eggplant but wished for a greater array of veggies. I might have forgiven the watery consistency if the flavor profile had been more robust. The server was kind and accommodating. No one ever came to take my money and I had to get up and go to the counter to pay. The place was not busy so I just think I was forgotten.  I love Thai food. I can imagine a freezing winter day when I am hungry and just want to warm up. I will give in to my desires and head to Rising Suns in hope that those lovely Thai spices and textures will magically appear and I will feel the heat all the way to my toes."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like it.  The place is cute with lots of colorful lamps and such, but the food was really awful.  The beef in the soup smelled icky, the squash curry had way too much oil, the squash was tough, and the few pieces of wilted broccoli were overcooked.  We didn't even eat half of our food, and then we regretted that we had eaten that much.  Not that we got sick or anything, but it was just pretty yuck.   Never going back."}
{"text":"Rising Sons serves the best damn Pad Thai I have ever had. You don't even need to bother getting meat with it. Just douse it with the Sriracha and Hoisin sauce they have sitting at every table.  Service is pretty slow, and there's not a lot of seating space. They seem understaffed, like they're in a restaurant that's way too small for the amount of food they're cooking and amount of people they're serving.   Regardless, the food is definitely worth the wait. You can't get Thai food of this quality anywhere else in Madison."}
{"text":"You won't be disappointed if you enjoy authentic Thai food! This was my first visit to Rising Sons Deli, but won't be my last! The service was fast & friendly and the chicken pad Thai was awesome! Very reasonable prices, too!!"}
{"text":"Not a fast food place vibe ready to wait. On the plus side each dish is prepared fresh. The pho is decent. I like my clear noodle soap to look clear and taste clean and this one has that. the one complaint I have about this dish is that it is a little bit too salty. I would come back to try the other dishes."}
{"text":"We arrived at Rising Sun Deli around 12:30 on a weekday. A waitress greeted us a we walked in and told us to take a seat wherever we liked. We sat near the door. I would not recommend this on a cold Wisconsin day. Every time a customer came in or out a cold wind came with them.  We started with the kalapao and beef jerky. The jerky was sweet, tangy, chewy, not dry and utterly delicious. I could eat a plate of that. The kalapao is a sweet bun filled with pork and hard-boiled egg. It was rustic looking but the sweet but and the savory filling was a winning combination. I loved it!  For our entrees and I had the pho and my dining companion had a duck soup. The broth in the pho was spot on - beefy, layered with flavor and complexity. Usually pho comes accompanied by a plate of condiments such as basil, bean sprouts, jalapenos, and lime. At Rising Suns Deli they were already in the pho. There was soy sauce, fish sauce, hoisin sauce and sriracha at the table to enhance the pho as desired. Even though I couldn't add my own proportions as desired, I was extremely pleased with the pho. My dining companion said the flavors of the duck soup were also spot on. There was quite a bit of extra fat and gristle though.  One thing to keep in mind is that Rising Suns Deli does not take credit-cards, so you will need to bring cash.  There were many dishes on the menu I look forward to trying. This probably isn't a place you would go if you are trying to impress a date, but I can see myself going back over and over. Good food, decent prices, reasonable service."}
{"text":"I only keep on coming back here because this is as close to mom's cooking as you can possibly get without trying to cook it yourself. I've been here long enough to actually eat at the retro restaurant that was in service right before Rising Sons relocated there from the old University Square...and I can testify that the decor has not changed much. Entree dishes have risen in price and is usually hit and miss (even if you order the same dish every time). I will however recommend their lunch special--usually can't get too wrong there. I will definitely recommend the sticky rice and homemade beef jerky. It has been so popular that they've run out on the jerky the last two times I've been there. Their papaya salad isn't as good as it used to be either."}
{"text":"Decent Thai/Laotian food that is not too far into State Street. The service was great and the food came in pretty quickly. I ate inside, but I heard that dining in their outdoor space is a fun experience. The inside has tacky decorations. I ordered the Panang curry with tofu, which could have been a bit more flavorful. Crab rangoons are great. I'm a sucker for Thai food, and this is my go to spot for any cravings when in the area. Make sure to have cash or check- they don't accept cards!"}
{"text":"I was the only one to walk in on a rainy Saturday. I ordered pad c ew and squash curry to go, very popular classic dishes. Then my friend texted that she already ate so I cancelled the curry while the owner was still right there in front of me. He walked away and came back and said 'what about the curry?' I just gave him a blank look and said I don't want it. He seemed very annoyed. Then he asked if I wanted change. I have him a 20 and the food was less than 10 so that was odd. Then he went back and came back and said what about the curry? Again I said I didn't want it and he asked me again about wanting change and I just yea. Then two minutes later he came with my to go box. The food was gross. It looked old and smelled awful. I didn't even bother to go back and ask him about it since he couldn't speak English."}
{"text":"Tom Kha Kai omg so good. Also the young man who is a server here, he's so nice and was very helpful when it came to picking a dish."}
{"text":"As an food enthusiast i walked in with the anticipation of great food.  Food looked good.  But a disappointment.  They didn't accept debit/credit.  So i had to walk to 3 atm machines!  I came back, they gave me my change a dollar short! Oh how pissed off I am! Total inconceinance! I was so pissed,  i almost just didn't come back to pay.  I'll never go there again.  Sorry.  I know us asian ppl don't like to pay taxes. But rich ppl pay lots of taxes so time to upgrade and pay taxes and do business a legitament way! It pays off in the long run!"}
{"text":"The only reason why I don't come here everyday is because I'm afraid the servers/owners will think I'm weird! Really good food and if I could come everyday, I certainly would. My favorite is the Coconut Noodle Soup - really good. I also like their curry. I'm not an expert on Thai and Laos food, but I certainly like it."}
{"text":"Growing up with Vietnamese food almost everyday, Rising Sons is my home-cooked meal away from home. The Pho is great and at a reasonable price. It's so nice to know that I can get something that is familiar and similar to my mom's wonderful cookingI love it!"}
{"text":"Finally stopped here for lunch after living in Madison for 14 years.  Great food, casual atmosphere, but a little pricyier than I was expecting for lunch.  Still, everything was delicious and I can see it being a good place to hang out casually."}
{"text":"Stopped in here a few times when I was in Madison for business and I was pleasantly surprised. It was good food, well priced, and quick service. Nothing amazing, just doing their jobs."}
{"text":"Kind people, wonderful Tom Yum Noodle and excellent Green Tea. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"A great place if your in the mood for Thai. I stop by about once a week and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"good for the price. probably similar to Sai Bai tong for Thai food flavor, but more reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Good enough to eat at if you're in the area, but we wouldn't return just for the food."}
{"text":"I've had the pad thai here, and while that's good I can say that the appetizers are even better. Fresh spring roles, hot chicken kabobs, all served with good sauces. Friendly staff and a clean atmosphere make this place worth going back to."}
{"text":"This was my second time here. My first time was fine, so I thought it was a good idea to come a second time. Big mistake. We ordered the spring rolls and as soon as it arrived, I knew I didn't want to eat it. The lettuce used inside the wrap was visibly brown. I ordered the papaya salad and chicken wings. The papaya salad seemed to be heavily drenched in fish sauce. The chicken wings were fine. My husband ordered the pho and found the broth to be overly sweet and watered down. The bowl came with bean sprouts already in the bowl. The proportion of bean sprouts were equal to the proportion of noodles in the bowl. Overall, I would never go back. The quality of food was definitely not worth what I paid for."}
{"text":"Me and two of my friends were in Wisconsin for a grad school related trip and came to Rising Sons Deli after being in planes/airports/taxis from 4AM California time to 3PM Wisconsin time and walking around campus and State St for three hours in the rain. We were tired and starving and wanted a warm, hearty meal. The meal was warm and hearty but truthfully, not very good.  My friend and I both ordered the pho. It came with meatballs, beef, bean sprouts, a tiny bit of green onions but we had to ask for cilantro, limes and fresh jalapenos. They didn't have jalapenos but i thought it was weird that we had to ask for ingredients that usually accompany pho. Ingredients that were also missing and that I missed were basil leaves and raw onions. Reasonably priced at 5.95 especially given the generous portion size but not very tasty by any means.  The pho was not very good... definitely one star material. The broth was too sweet and bland, the meat was SO tough i considered not eating it (and for me to consider not eating anything...............hoooeeey!), and the noodles were undercooked and gave me a mild jaw ache. I do not recommend getting the pho.  My other friend ordered this stir fry and I can't believe I can't remember the name of it because my friends and I spent so much time trying to remember it. Well, it's #25 on the menu and my friend ordered it with chicken and it was great. The chicken was tender, the flavor and it came with two scoops of white rice (i would guess jasmine rice) that was perfectly steamed. The flavor of the stir fry like meal was decent, not complicated and a little too salty. The menu advertised it as being spicy but it was definitely not spicy enough for the three of us and so my friend added some of the crushed garlic and chili in oil that was on the table which really added a much needed kick. While this dish was decent, it was definitely something that I could have whipped up and so, not worth the 8.50.   The pluses of this restaurant are the cute, kitschy decor with lots of high stools and plastic red chairs and a funky little booth in the back; the super friendly and generous staff who brought us lime wedge after lime wedge; and the tootsie rolls that are in giant bowls all around the restaurant. I never knew that tootsie rolls complimented pho so well! =)  Would I go back? Probably... Would I order the pho? Definitely not."}
{"text":"This store is family run and treats their returning customers like part of their family. I first started going when they were located in University Square and they had part of the store as a grocery store. I have been a fan ever since. Since they moved to State Street, the food is still as good, but since there are a lot more patrons during rush hour, they get a little busy. The food is worth the wait. The drunken noodles are my favorite. Just be aware that you need to bring cash since they don't take credit cards. Whenever I am back in town, I make it a point to stop by for some tasty food!"}
{"text":"the Beef (or Shrimp) Pad Thai is unbeatable. Moody cook, though. Sometimes can be awesome, sometimes can be awful. Come when his mood is good, and I believe you'll enjoy the most delicious Pad Thai you've ever tried."}
{"text":"Food was really subpar for the price. I've had MUCH better soup based noodles. Won't go again unless I have a huge craving for Thai and Vietnamese. And even then, I would consider other places first."}
{"text":"It's rare I'm this enthusiastic about a restaurant, but having eaten here three times in the past month, I have extraordinarily few complaints.  Having lived in a Lao/Thai-heavy neighborhood in San Francisco, I thought I was doomed to a life of sub-par fare elsewhere, but this place has saved me from such a fate.  I'm particularly partial to two dishes.  The first is the panaeng curry.  While it is a bit oily, it bursts with rich, well-developed flavors and colors.  It's the perfect level of spicy to warm you up when trudging through campus in the winter.  The variety of vegetables - and in particular the mushrooms, which I normally can't stand - is superb, and the meat is never too tough.  The second is the drunken noodles, which seems to be their most popular dish.  The noodles are fresh and their texture strikes the perfect balance between firm and tender.  The Chinese broccoli is fresh and flavorful, and the basil adds a strong fresh flavor without overwhelming the rest of the ingredients.  As some have mentioned, the service is less than stellar and there is limited seating if you don't want to sit at the bar.  However, I like to come here for a \"working lunch,\" where I can make some headway on reading while being allowed to eat at a leisurely pace.  They have never tried to hurry me out the door or continually interrupt me to see if I need anything else.  The service is also markedly better closer to normal meal times than, say, in the middle of the afternoon.  The staff is also quite cheerful and friendly when they wait on you.  I can't say I remember much about the decor, but I'd say that's less a problem with the decor than a compliment to how amazing the food is. The lack of music blasting is also a welcome rarity among campus eateries.  I'm surprised this doesn't have a higher rating, but it's fine by me - most of the State St. places I like are already so crowded that it's nice to have this semi-hidden gem."}
{"text":"Rising Sons used to be on University Ave, where the old theater used to be.  Of course, that has been torn down and \"Lucky\" apartment complex has been raised in it's place.  What a fitting name, as one needs to pay $1,000 and up to live here.  Did I mention this is student housing?!?!     Jealousy and envy and contempt aside, I am still mourning the loss of the old University Square.    Curry In A Hurry used to be here.  It was a between class staple in my diet.  Lamb curry with Paratha, to go, please.  I would wrap the curry and rice in my Paratha and walk while eating, my pseudo wrap.  I miss this restaurant, as it never relocated, it just closed.    Rising sons was my snack stop, they sold fried bananas, Southeast Asian style, and it was a Mon, Wed, Fri stop on the way to Bascom Hill.    After the Square was torn down, Rising Sons relocated to State Street.  I was so excited!  It was close to my apartment and on the way to class, I no longer had to walk two blocks out of my way.  Alas, I walked in to order my fried bananas, to go, and was devastated.  \"We no longer sell that, mam.\"    I miss the old Square."}
{"text":"So I am a bit harsh when it comes to Thai Food. What I ordered was Basil, and coming from a Thai family, I would like authentic.  It wasn't cooked exactly how I would like it. However the spice was up to par. The place was cozy. It won't be my primary place to head to, but I will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"*Note: they DO NOT take credit or debit cards. CASH or CHECKS ONLY*  Love, love, love the food here! If you are on State St. in Madison, WI by campus and have a craving for authentic Laos/Thai food then you should definitely stop by here.  The atmosphere is a quaint little spot with regular tables and diner-style bar seating in front of the kitchen. Cute and clean.   The Food: Coconut Chicken Noodle Soup- 5/5 this dish was flavorful and packed just the right amount of sweet, sour, and spicy. Definitely a must try!   Papaya Salad - 4/5 so very tasty. Perfect mix of spicy, sweet and sour as well   Garlic pork - 4/5 flavorful and cooked just right  Crab Rangoon - 4/5 loved every bite of it!   We come here every time we get to Madison. We will always return to this restaurant when we come here! They have so many authentic recipes on the menu that are real Lao staples. Try the mok gai, mok pa, or galapao."}
{"text":"Disappointed... They get two stars because of the friendly waiter and beef jerky. As for the BBQ red pork dish it was not the worse I've had but it's close enough(skinny flat small squared pork chops)I'm positive the rice and type of soy sauce that went with it made the meal taste better. The mild papaya was okay...Thai ice tea was definitely the worse I've had."}
{"text":"Was here again the other day and found a long black hair entangled in my pad thai noodles.  Yikes!  I'm not coming back."}
{"text":"I actually thought the food was pretty good--I had the drunken noodles and they were just the right amount of spice (I don't like things super hot) and good flavor in general.  However, I ordered the drunken noodles with chicken, but received them with beef, and that's just the beginning of our problems.  I arrived here as part of a party of six.  It was pretty full but there was a large table open that accommodated us, so we sat down.  10-15 minutes later, a woman took our orders.  By this point, most of the people who'd been there when we arrived were leaving, so the restaurant was more than half empty.  We were all a little concerned when she didn't write anything down, but she didn't seem worried.  She did bring out the beers that three of us ordered right away.  ...Approximately 50 minutes later, our food arrived.  My drunken noodles, as noted, were served with beef; one of the pad thais, for which the beef had been ordered, got the chicken.  I said something about it and the waitress did ask if I wanted it redone; since I didn't have another hour to spare, I said no.  I feel kind of silly, because this is EXACTLY the kind of service experience a friend of mine described to me when he went there a couple of years ago, but other people in the group had been there before and wanted to go, so I went along with it.  I guess I might go again some time when I have 2-3 hours to kill and want to drink awhile before eating."}
{"text":"Went there this past Sat. night.  I was in the mood for Asian food, so we tried this since it's near the bars.  Got the papaya salad, which was surprisingly tasty!  The medium was still really hot, so be aware!  I got the drunken noodles and my bf got tom yum soup.  The noodles were def. tasty, but the tom yum soup was too salty and def. had wayy too much msg! Give it a try though.. Also, the service is super, super, super slow!  So don't expect so much."}
{"text":"My friend and I sat at the counter, so the service felt pretty laid back, but they were nice! We both had curry dishes that were perfectly satisfying but nothing out of the ordinary. Pretty good place if you're looking for Thai/ Laotian food... I'd recommend it!"}
{"text":"I walked in here hoping I could satisfy my noodle soup craving but was sorely disappointed. I ordered the BBQ Pork Noodle Soup. When my dish arrived, I immediately noticed that the supposed \"egg noodles\" mentioned in the menu were definitely just instant ramen noodles. Strike one. I asked the server why they used instant ramen when the menu said egg noodles, and he told me that what I was eating was \"Vietnamese style egg noodles.\" I know what Vietnamese egg noodles are, and this was definitely not it. Trying to fool me into believing that my food was authentic? Strike two. Now, if the soup was actually good on top of that maybe I would have forgiven it, but the pork and vegetables were really not very memorable either. Strike three.  Considering that the food was pretty much a waste of my time and money, I definitely will not come back."}
{"text":"After reading all the rave reviews about their Pad Thai, I decided to try it one night. I absolutely love Pad Thai and I didn't mind driving around 30 minutes (one way) for it. Pro: for around $8 you get a nice sizeable portion. Con: the dish wasn't all that great. It was very mediocre; nowhere close to the best Pad Thai I've had (as per other reviews). I was quite disappointed for spending an hour on the road for it."}
{"text":"Eh, this place is kind of grungy. The tables are grungy because they don't do a particularly good job cleaning it. The interior decorating is grungy, with confusingly eclectic decor that's covered in a thin layer of dust and cooking grease. And the food is grungy, a slapdash effort thrown together with only the barest nod to \"Thai\" cuisine. OK, you put basil in your fried rice. But if it's otherwise just a greasy, bland mess, does it still count as Thai basil rice? And it's not even that cheap! I would understand it if this place sold itself as super-affordable-drunk-college-Asian food, but it's really not that cheap. And finally, the service is rather poor, partly because of work ethic and partly because the space is arranged in such a way that the servers have no idea if the customers are ready to be served.  There are several Thai places that out-do Rising Sons by a large margin. Do yourself a favor - go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I was wandering around State street and found this little homey restaurant. It has a super casual feel and is family run, which is always a plus in my opinion. I had the Panang Curry which was great. Not too spicy and not too oily. A good ratio of meat to veggies. You definitely get all the flavors of the ingredients they use; Nothing is lost.   I did take out on a Monday night and it was very quick. Would definitely recommend this place to friends."}
{"text":"I had some crazy good coconut curry tofu here, but they lose a star for not having brown rice. The back \"patio\" is more like a charming vine-covered brick hallway with a couple of tables on it."}
{"text":"This is my go to place when it's freezing. I love their noodle soups. Especially in a day in the single digits.   I have been getting the Pho and Tom Yum Noodle soups. It's a large portion that I can actually finish without regretting it. The soup broths are perfectly spiced.   The pho today didn't taste like beef broth, but it's ok. It was still a soup and it warmed me up.   I would also recommend all of their appetizers. I like getting sticky rice too. It comes in a small basket.   Seating is limited so if you come with a larger group, the max would probably be 6 people. Great for 1-1 lunch meetings. They also have individual seats at their \"bar\" area in the middle of the restaurant.   I probably come in at least once every two weeks or so. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I definitely have love for Rising Sons. BUT to have the best experience, I have a few rcommendations:  1. Never eat in. Or eat in.. but only once, for the experience. It is kind of a bizarre place with random decorations and such. Take-out is the way to go.  2. Pick the right things on the menu! Highly recommend Drunken noodles, Pad Thai, Tom Yum soup (HUGE).  3. For an appetizer, I  always get the vegetarian spring rolls, but I would not recommend them. They are literally rice paper filled with lettuce and some vermicelli noodles... Don't know why I always get them, but I do.  My only complaints: I always wish they had appetizer soups instead of the huge portions! I love the Tom Yum soup but never order it because it is massive and I would rather get a stir fry or noodle dish."}
{"text":"While the food isn't spectacular, the ingredients are fresh and there are certain dishes that are definitely better than others. I enjoy their noodle dishes, particularly the pad thai, and it's a unique and convenient dinner choice if you're near campus. It's a fun, casual date-night type of place. The service can be slow, but you usually don't have much of a wait to get a table."}
{"text":"Excellent curries and Pad Thai are beat eaten on their small open patio during the summer. Remarkably friendly staff. I have not ordered anything here that I did not thoroughly enjoy. Reasonably priced but bring cash."}
{"text":"I can't believe this place has only 3 stars. I just ate here tonight and it was phenomenal. They have a picture menu to make ordering easier, which was really nice for my boyfriend who I dragged along with me and was unfamiliar with Thai food. We got the tom kha kai and the crab rangoons to start. The crab rangoons were probably the best I've ever had and the tom kha kai was equally as delicious. My boyfriend got the tom khem as his main dish and oh my, it was awesome. Sweet and savory, the meat was tender and flavorful. I got the mussamund curry, which was not as good as his meal, but still delicious. The service was attentive and the atmosphere was pleasant in the small restaurant. Overall, very enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Really delicious pad thai!  Food took a long time to arrive.  Beware: there's not much seating and they do not take credit cards so bring cash."}
{"text":"How do you say lousy in Laotian? Oh! I know Rising Sons... We had an order of spring rolls with pork, it has as much flavor as tap water. Our meal consisted of drunken noodles which would have tasted better if I would have been drunk myself, BBQ red pork which was forgettable and two Lao beers. The service was as bad as the food even though the restaurant was not full. The food was cold immediately after it arrived. What I can't figured out is why this establishment has been open for 13 years...before I forget the place smells like rancid oil."}
{"text":"Fresh, delicious food you can't beat. Taste is authentic, not artificial, and unique.   Also has a beautiful outdoor alley seating area, perfect for those Instagram photo ops ;)"}
{"text":"This was my last stop in Madison after Homecoming weekend. A nice little hole in the wall place on lower State Street. I had a hankering for pho and this was the only place that I found on Yelp. The sign on the front said 'Thai' so I figured it wouldn't be what I was used to having at Vietnamese places. The place was quiet at 11:30am. I sat at the counter and quickly placed my order. I tried to think back on what business used to occupy this spot 25 years ago when I was a student here. It never came to me.  The pho arrived and, as expected, it was different. It wasn't bad, just different. I half expected it to taste like tom yum but it didn't. The warm broth and noodles helped to warm the soul. There were no sprouts or basil or jalapenos. Oh well, but I couldn't understand why there was no Sriracha. No Huy Fong Sriracha?? Unspeakable. I made do with the jar of chili oil found on the counter.  Bowl done, I paid (cash only) at the counter, exchanged pleasantries and off I went to the airport. Next time, I'll try the Thai food. Hopefully, I'll find a pho joint nearby as well."}
{"text":"Small quaint place right outside UW campus on State Street.   The food wasn't spectacular, but it was certainly authentic and not a bad meal! The service was fairly quick and polite, and like other reviews have said - they are cash only! I would check them out if you're curious about authentic northern Thai food, because it's quite different from the southern Thai food that most people are used to (Pad Thai, etc.)."}
{"text":"Moderately good eats here. I've had Pho and drunken noodles (both were pretty tasty). Try their coconut mango rice for dessert."}
{"text":"It was raining. We were seeking shelter. Saw the THAI and figured, why not?  Two stars for the food. It wasn't the best thai food I've ever had..but it wasn't the worst either.  We got the padthai and the red curry (per the waiter's suggestion). Not super memorable, but authentic enough for the midwest. The noodles were al dente and the curry had a nice pop of spicy. What more do you expect?.. Although, if you consider yourself a thai food connoisseur, you should probably steer clear of this place. Me? I'll take what I can get.   One additional star for service. We had a third person join our table halfway into our meal, and not only did the waiter not insist that he order something, he actually offered to pour a cup of water for our friend.  How sweet."}
{"text":"Visited on a weekend night in the late summer around dinner time. Ordered Pad Thai with shrimp and a curry with chicken.  Pros: outside dining is very nice. Secluded with exposed brick and shade. Prices were very reasonable.  Cons: The food wasn't great. The sauce on the Pad Thai was odd. The curry was a little better but still not something I would order again. The service was very inattentive."}
{"text":"Rising Sons now fits in the category of places I will willing enter, but only when someone else wants to go here.  I visited Rising Sons during noon on a weekday.  While all of the other restaurants nearby were bustling with customers, this place had no one but me and my dining companion to serve.  Despite that their menu did not list lunch prices they subtracted $1 from our menu meal price, and since this was my first visit I don't know if we received a reduced portion?  The Pad Thai I ordered was just lovely, spicy, vinegary, and overall pretty tasty.  My friend's Chicken Fried Rice left her much to be desired.  Boo for not accepting credit cards.  Also boo on the obnoxious decor that formerly belonged to the previous tenant (Larry B's) and uncomfortable stools that come with it."}
{"text":"Such a solid place for a yummy, cozy meal.  My go-to is Stir Fry Vegetable.  I know it sounds generic but the flavor is just great.  Remembered loving it years ago and went back for a visit and it was just as good.   A place that holds happy memories.  :)"}
{"text":"The service is good here, it's a cute little  restaurant. The food is okay, never bad but also never amazing. Their pad thai could use more tamarind."}
{"text":"A good old dirty looking asian restaurant.  My kind of place!  Love the beef jerky and sticky rice, but if you're going out of your way to come here for that specifically, be sure to call ahead and make sure they have some.  Stopped in on the way to the dells once, and they didn't have the beef jerky that weekend.  But that's okay, we ate anyway.  And it was delicious!    Cash only, there is an ATM not too far away on the sidewalk."}
{"text":"Well, I kept falling off the ledge at the bar where I had my noodles (doh!), and had to find my own napkins and stuff... but, whatever! The staff were so sweet and nice. I had the Kao Poun- it was DELICIOUS!!! Rah! The guy working behind the counter suggested it, and said he 'grew up eating it'. Lucky guy... The crab Rangoon edges were a bit tough, and the Kalapao was kinda dry, but- still good! I will return. It's nice to know there is yet another place I can sit at a counter and have a big-ass bowl of delicious noodles."}
{"text":"cash only solid, homemade LAUS & Thai. Very authentic.  Converted space, so tables are arranged a bit odd, but it works! service by family/owners, so no issue - motivated to please. Priced fair and quality is better than others. Family (teens) enjoyed Pho and curry dishes. Sukiyaki.  Heat if you want it, options if you don't. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"We went here for a quick lunch with our daughter. Bathrooms clean: check. Nice waitress: check. Tasty thai food: check. General cleanliness: oh well... on State Street in Madison, you can't have everything!"}
{"text":"Drunken noodles were really good. No debit or credit cards accepted here which is pain. I mean c'mon people I can take a credit card with my phone these days,  your restaurant could certainly. Luckily I had cash."}
{"text":"I went here on a Sunday with my girlfriend. We were seated outside immediately in the back alley which is super cool. I really enjoyed the food but the service and the scenic alley are what gives it 4 stars in my book.  My girlfriend got a shrimp dish. they were medium sized and the taste was fine to her. I got a coconut chicken noodle, I enjoyed it but it was a little more unique then what I expected. More fusion then traditional. The dishes were great and we both had some take out. Luckily the place has the good plastic take out containers.  I wouldn't make this a regular place but I would certainly come back and try something else next time. This is also cash only, which is a pain in the butt, Back to three stars!!"}
{"text":"Okay--this review is multi-dimensional, there are greats mixed with meh-s so please read all the way through. Starting with the appetizers: we ordered the sampler which came with ONE of each of the following: -crab rangoon -small piece of beef jerky small spring roll -small egg roll -small chicken satay The beef jerky, egg roll and chicken satay were good but as noted above, a pretty small portion. Spring roll was also small and contained only lettuce, carrot and a small slice of cucumber (disappointing). Crab rangoon was good (wanted more). Next comes the entrees: Panang Curry- this was watery and lite on flavor (had to add salt and pepper). Lad Nar w/beef- this was AMAZING. SO GOOD. Top three I've ever had. Coconut curry with noodle and chicken- ALSO AMAZING. I'm not a fan of cilantro, and this dish was topped with it but I picked it off and it was fine. My suggestion would be for Rising Son's to step up their appitizer game (price and size). I will definitely be ordering from here again--but for now, only entrees."}
{"text":"My only visit and experience was yesterday for take-out. Theres a decent sized bar and comfy stools you can sit at, or a few tables/ booths i think. Its a long and narrow space, but seems to work. I stopped in around 2:30 in the afternoon and it was super quiet in there. I ordered the vegetarian mango curry. When I got it home and opened it up I was srprised to see how liquidy and soupy it was, compared to any other mango curries I've had in the past from other restaurants. I was pleasantly surprised at how delicious, fresh and tasty it was. Full of flavor, just a hint of spice (I asked for mild) and super fresh and tender veggies, cooked just right. I'll absolutely go again and will try some of their other dishes next time I'm in the area. As others have mentioned, bring cash... or a checkbook (he offered that to me as a choice, believe it or not!). If you forget to have cash on hand there is a convenient ATM just a few steps away, which brought the cost of my lunch to $3.25 more than I had intended. Decent and reasonable prices to boot."}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch one day with three other people.  We were lucky enough to grab a table for four.  Service was kind of slow, so I don't recommend going here if you have a short lunch break.  I had the Pad Thai, which was solid - not the best I've had, but decent.  I left feeling full and happy.  Oh, and apparently they don't take credit cards.  Plan accordingly."}
{"text":"They really need to work on the service. I used to like eating there when the funny man as the waiter still worked. Their food is fine, not great. I love their sesame balls and used to buy them on a regular basis. However, the new waitress who started working almost a few months now, made me reluctant to eat there. She is very rude!!!!!! I miss the funny guy!"}
{"text":"Am I an expert on authentic Thai cuisine? No. Far from it.  Have I eaten at a lot of Thai restaurants in the U.S.? Yes. This is by far my favorite.  Their Pad Thai is my favorite Pad Thai, their coconut curry chicken noodle soup has become one of my favorite dishes period.  I will go here every single time I travel back to Madison."}
