{"text":"Very upset, the website allowed me to order a breakfast item and I was called shortly after to be told that breakfast wasn't sold after 10. I was ok with that. The gentleman then asked me if there was anything I would like to change out for the breakfast item and i asked for a quesadilla. He told me I couldn't get that either. I let him know that the website said they were available until 8:30 pm and he said, \"I know, sorry you can't get that either.\"  That was his explanation!  He offered me a refund for that item, I accepted and still have not seen it on my bank statement. Other than that, food here is pretty good."}
{"text":"Good food, fast service. This place has tons of options. The staff was nice and the restaurant was clean. We will be going back!"}
{"text":"Still no call back, I'm pissed off that they didn't even recognize that I didn't get my drinks and that the food was horrible dry and taste like cardboard. Please never go here!"}
{"text":"An exceptional place. Unpretentious with fresh, top quality ingredients. I had the mushroom Swiss burger, my \"go-to\" standard. First off it's a 1/2 lb of fresh ground beef. Mushrooms, grilled onions and swiss piled on and then served on an egg bun which has been toasted on the flat top. Delicious.   In addition to burgers, you can order a variety of Philly cheese steaks, fish and chips, gyros, shawarmas and fresh made Hawaiian poke salads.   I am definitely looking for to my next visit. Well done, WTF EXP !"}
{"text":"Not only is the food amazingly delicious and the service perfect What really makes the place extra special is the family behind it . It all starts with the boss Sam and his lovely wife and his 2 wonderful boys who I have had the pleasure of knowing for quite a while Since the Quik Stop and Marlyns Fish & Chips on Central Ave So when your on your way to the airport or coming home from a trip stop by WTF for a great experience of food fun and family   Alhamdulillah...Mashaallah"}
{"text":"My first time here was with the girls from lunch. The burger was everything I enjoy in a burger, nice size patty and a good bun. They have a huge topping bar to dress your burger. The fries and onion rings were both amazing and they have deep- fried Oreos. I was happy to be reunited with this sinful addiction since Fremont Street in Vegas closed down the casino that used to serve. They also have frozen Kool-Aid, that is I find myself craving. I wish this was offered on UberEats, but I get that it is probably hard for the drivers to tote.   This is not the place for you if you are on a diet.  I told my husband about this place too and so far his coworkers and him and been here twice too, even the men said finishing the big burger was rough!   My only grovel is the bacon, what is it?  If you get some good crispy bacon my love can only grow."}
{"text":"What a wonderful mix of great comfort foods. I had the chicken shawarma fries and garlic parmesan wings."}
