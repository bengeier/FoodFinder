{"text":"Numerous times we have ordered delivery here and every single time we have been overcharged.  Last time the delivery guy forgot half of our order. Called again today with a coupon for pizza for $15.99 and was quoted a total of $21+.  Even with delivery charge of $2 that is not right.  We've had enough of the employees not knowing what to do here. We canceled our order. We will not order from here ever again."}
{"text":"I've never been so disappointed at a \"fast food\" place. Call me old fashioned, but the girl taking our order did so the entire time, relaxing back with one elbow on the counter. That should have prepared me to know that no one there takes their job seriously!  I order a crispy chicken sandwich and the cashier yells back \"hey, how old is that chicken there?\" The other lady pulls the little drawer out, looks at it, shrugs her shoulders and says \"I think they're from before.\"  Blech!!!!  I'm glad this happened though because it made me look back into the kitchen where there were open and broken boxes everywhere, a clear windowed cooler showing gross shelves full of nothing and the dirtiest flattop I've ever seen!  I couldn't chance eating anything but my husband rolled the dice. Waiting for the food, I would suggest standing to not risk touching their disgusting furniture!  Has no one there heard of cleaning agents??!!??!!??  My husbands food was cold when he got it and he regretted going there, especially after seeing the food I ordered from Culvers across the road. Pay the extra to go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"If it were not for Rocky Rococo pizza I probably would not ever order from there. For deliveries they only take cash or credit so when they forget to ask you when ordering, they may come to your door and you have no cash. This happened to us once. So they make the delivery guy call the shop, hope they answer, and then he stands there listening to your cc number over the phone. Retarded."}
{"text":"High price gas with Rockys pizza and A&W menus to choose from.  The food is good and they have a drive through in the back of the gas station for the restaurants.  There is also ample seating inside and outside.  A decent place to gas up, eat and stretch your legs."}
