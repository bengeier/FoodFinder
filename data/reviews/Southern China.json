{"text":"I ordered take-out and had eggrolls and shrimp lo mein. Both the food and the service earned a solid 'meh'...   Also, they use thin egg noodles in their lo mein instead of the thicker egg noodles traditionally used in the dish. Not sure if they just ran out of lo mein noodles or if the thinner noodle is their standard.   Overall, it wasn't terrible but I have to believe that there are better places in the area. I'll look elsewhere for my next lo mein fix."}
{"text":"I really enjoy getting food from here. The guy up front isn't that great with his English but he is always nice and quick. The food is pretty dang good and I am picky with my food. I'd recommend everyone to give it a shot if you haven't."}
{"text":"We must of hit this on a bad night the food was awful,beef teriyaki was indelible it was like dried beef jerky.im giving 2 stars only because the staff was so nice"}
{"text":"Favorite place in Concord for Chinese take out.  Normally end up ordering extra egg rolls because they're pretty tasty.  Also a fan of their crab rangoon as an appetizer.    Only strange happening - once I couldn't remember the name for Kung Pao chicken, so when I called I asked:  \"What's the spicy one with peanuts?\"   \"Oh, you must mean cashew chicken!\"  Um, no.  BUT, the food is good and fast, staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"Clean and tasty Chinese take out. Their food is superb for any Chinese restaurant not just for takeout place.  If you are around concord and feeling Chinese food, make sure to check out this place."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great service. Fast and quick. Food is delicious and reasonably price."}
{"text":"I have eaten at every place in concord after moving here and by far this place has the best quality of food along with best flavor of any Chinese place in town.  Try it. You won't go back to those other places."}
{"text":"The food is always hot and fresh when I pick up my order. The staff has always been friendly toward me, so I've absolutely nothing bad to say. I've ordered from here about four times and always go with the General Tso's chicken. Very delicious!"}
{"text":"Adequate Chinese take-out compared to others in the area. Fast, convenient location, friendly enough. The one time we got food from there (yesterday), we all agreed the dishes were over-salted with disappointing portion sizing (the place avoids unambiguous units like \"pint\" and \"quart\"). Yet, the lack of good competition in the area means that we'll probably try again at 'Southern China' before too long."}
{"text":"I'm from Louisiana and anyone who's from Kenner, knows Young's Garden is the absolute BEST spot for general tsos dinners, right before Manchu's. However, Southern China is making me contemplate that just a little! The portions are very nice and the price is reasonable! They also have really great customer service and I can appreciate that when ordering from anywhere. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Many choices in the area. This is where I go...and I'm picky. Food is always good. Never tasted old. Some other places in the area taste like the rice is from 3 days ago. Not here. Cooked fresh. And...when you order combo, FREE TUPPERWARE AND NO STYROFOAM! !"}
{"text":"I just moved here from Brooklyn NY- !BROWNSVILLE!I was searching for some good Chinese Food and I'm telling this place rice is on the money!!! Good eats!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. the prices are affordable and the food is great. They prepare your food fast and I never have to wait. I often buy my employee food from there because it taste amazing. It not a fancy place but the food makes up for the d√©cor.  Definitely check it out"}
{"text":"GREAT Chinese take out. Staff have always been nice and helpful. Pretty quick and food is the best part. Best Chinese restaurant in Concord. We get the sesame seed chicken lo mein egg rolls and sweet and sour chicken. They are delicious. My sister has also tried a combo off their healthy menu and loved it."}
