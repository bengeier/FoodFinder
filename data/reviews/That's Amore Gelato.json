{"text":"Best gelato ever. I have been going here since the first day they opened and we're giving out free samples. Now many years later my family and I still go there. They even gave my wife and i free gelato when we got married and had kids. The owners are awesome and even help me practice my Italian when I order. I have seen them out shopping from time to time and they always smile and wave. I have been to the top gelato places in Rome and Florence and I actually enjoy this place more.  No place in AZ even comes close to the great flavors or smoothness of the gelato here. I think I might just stop by today actually."}
{"text":"If you want a wonderful tasty selection of gelato, this is the place to go to in Scottsdale! The owners are very friendly and their flavor recommendations are always on par. We also appreciate the extended hours during the week. Highly recommend for any one with a sweet tooth!"}
{"text":"It is insane how good this gelato/sorbet is!!  I had the (sorry, I forgot the official name) cherry with nuts gelato and the limoncello sorbet.  They have been in the valley for 12 years and I just recently discovered them at the Gelato Festival at Kierland Commons.  If you don't live near their location, I would say it is definitely worth the trip!"}
{"text":"The best Gelato! We get the rasberry, mocha and chocolate... the Limoncello is awesome too!"}
{"text":"We have been coming here for many years and it is absolutely amazing. As soon as we discovered this place we completely stopped going to all the other local ice cream and yogurt places. This blows them all away. I was prompted to write this review after returning from Italy. Everywhere that I had gelato I compared it to That's Amore and in only one place (of many) did the gelato in Italy stand up to That's Amore. Love the owners, love the gelato!"}
{"text":"Delicious and such great quality! Put this on your regular stop off list. Perfect for the heat of summer and perfect for your taste buds. Enjoy the crafted quality and the interesting variety of flavours. Good value for money and tasty."}
{"text":"They never disappoint! Had 30 minutes before headed to airport, where else would I go you say? That's Amore!!!! Hazelnut and chocolate, coffee gelato! Yummy...I've converted many people to this place. Still holds the title for the best gelato in USA!!! Tough deal to follow. Thank you Amore"}
{"text":"After trying numerous gelato spots in the valley, this is the real deal! So many of the others are just ice cream. So happy to find it so close to home, yet so sad as my family and I frequent stop here far to often! (Almost five nights a week, no shame). They have a huge selection of flavors but they never really change. That is good and bad.  Also sad they no longer have Forest Fruit, as this was one of my sister and I's favorite. But the half chocolate, half banana is pretty hard to beat.   A little pricey but that obviously hasn't stopped us!"}
{"text":"Amazing!  It is 46 degrees outside tonight and my hubby and I had to try this place out.  Gelato was so creamy and flavorful.  We had a combo of coffee and whisky cream and I am in love.  Great service and for a night that is cold as it is tonight, almost every chair was taken.  I will return!"}
{"text":"Went with a coworker for an afternoon treat, and a treat is exactly what I got! The spicy chocolate gelato was amazing! I couldn't put it down! Might have to do a little extra cardio today but man was it worth it! :)"}
{"text":"So when I read in the paper that the owners were real Italians, I rushed over to try the gelato. It's heaven!!! I've tried 7 flavors and they are all really good, especially the spicy chocolate and the mango. I combined 3 flavors in one cup the second time I went and it was like a miracle in my mouth; took me right back to my visit to Italy. The owners are so friendly and you feel like you're in a real neighborhood type place instead of a strip mall when you are inside trying to choose from the staggering amount of flavors. Unlike out-of-the-way favorites that people want to keep secret so that they don't get too crowded, I want everyone to come and enjoy the gelato here so that it has plenty of business and never closes down!"}
{"text":"You speak Italian to me and provide mouth watering, soul lifting coconut gelato with micro-chips of chocolate in them?!  I only wish you weren't 30 miles away...but I would walk in 116 degree heat to get there - for real!"}
{"text":"Really great gelato, and an overwhelming number of choices- surely everyone could find a flavor that they would like.The Limone was perfect, tart and refreshing. We also enjoyed the Toblerone, which was a deep dark chocolate. Both choices were delicious. Now, was the texture just like the gelato that we've had in Italy? I'd have to say no, but delicious nonetheless!! Definitely worth a stop!"}
{"text":"Absolutely phenomenal gelato!! Best fricken ice cream I have ever had. Better than froyo and ice cream. Awesome flavor and perfect ambiance. If you want something sweet go here!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. The mint is amazing. It's not too sweet and just perfect.  I wish I could try other flavors but I like the mint too much.  I know it's quality because my stomach feels fine afterwards, unlike if I go to coldstones. The owners/workers are very nice and I like the decor of the shop. I try to go once a week."}
{"text":"This gelato store lives up to its reputation.  There were 5 of us, and we all chose different flavors after sampling quite a few.  The gelato is smooth and creamy and bursting with flavor.  And the lemon sorbet is so refreshing.  We'll be back again and again."}
{"text":"We are quite gelatto addicts, I'm used to prepare my own at home since long ago. Thus far, this is the best we've got in all the USA (and we travel quite enough). It' even better than mine! Hazelnut and pistacchio are top 2. Totally worth the trip."}
{"text":"So many different flavors of gelato! It was so fun to try them all. And there was such a variety as well! I liked the ambiance of the place - it felt a bit like Italy.  My milkshake was a bit milky and lost the flavor of the gelato. But I would still return and maybe just choose a stronger flavor or ask for less milk. Otherwise, it was great!!"}
{"text":"Anybody who doesn't give it a 5 star is a lair! Best gelato place no comparison!  Lots of flavors offered and the owner is always so happy! I come as much as possible"}
{"text":"Lots of flavors to choose from and very clean inside.   I only gave them 2 stars as the person that assisted us was very rude.  There are many other places to go to get the same quality of gelato and be treated better."}
{"text":"By far the best gelato this side of Italy.  Actually their flavors are imported from Italy.  My kids don't want to get ice cream any more.  If I am on the other side of town I would even make the drive."}
{"text":"After reading all of the wonderful reviews we were anxious to try the gelato while visiting from FL.  Unfortunately they're closed July 7-21!!!  Sorely disappointed we won't get to try it."}
{"text":"I go to That's Amore every weekend! Everybody needs to try this place, it's fantastic."}
{"text":"Got a whiskey and banana while the hubby got chocolate rum and whiskey! This is the best creamiest gelato I have ever had. The flavors meshed so well together and the texture was so creamy and light. Better than gelato spot. Customer service is good too.  We will be back for sure. I wish I could go in and get more right now! Lol Try it :)"}
{"text":"We had a great time at that's amore gelato!I got the mint chocolate chip gelato  and my sister got Chocolate sorbet. My mom got a little pastry. My dad got straciatella!     Over all... the best gelato  of the vacation!! Awesome!"}
{"text":"So many flavor choices. Took the family tonight and we all agreed that it was the best we've ever had.  I had the toffee, which was good but I liked my daughter's cappuccino better. My son was crazy about his lemoncello and my husband had the whiskey cream, which he loved.   We were served by one of the owners and enjoyed looking at their pastries and various writeups on the walls about the owners, their gelato and their story."}
{"text":"Genuine Italian gelato from genuine Italians! My wife (she's from Milan) loves to visit Fabio and Davide and their wives, who run this place, for a great flavorful gelato and maybe an espresso. The place is straight out of Italy and the gelato is consistently great. Even my mother-in-law is delighted to go with us to get a little taste of home. Try it after dinner sometime; it is a great altenative to the heavy, over-the-top concoctions at a place like ColdStone."}
{"text":"OMG!!! This place has the BEST Gelato in town. If you haven't been here to try their MANY UNBELIEVABLE FLAVORS then you MUST make the trip!!! I honestly do not think they have one bad flavor... ALL are incredible! It's seriously worth every one of the five stars!!!!! I'm addicted!!!!"}
{"text":"DeliciosoThe chocolate and peanut butter and stracciatella are all excellent, as are the panini!  A wonderful shop!"}
{"text":"It's the perfect time of year to rediscover this great place.  I just went to Rome for the first time and fell in love with gelato all over again, and it reminded me that I have a wonderful little gelato venue that I can visit right here in Scottsdale.  So within the first two weeks back, I did!  The service is always lovely, the selection is vast, and the gelato is delicious.  If they would just add Chestnut to their menu, my new favorite, it would be a five star in my book for sure.  Please visit them - they are worth the calories and I want them to stick around for a long while."}
{"text":"This is my favorite gelato spot. It doesn't get any better than this! I have come here many times and never had a negative experience. I especially love the outdoor seating on a warm evening."}
{"text":"What can you say - this stuff is great. Lots of flavors , creamy, quality. Worth every calorie consumed."}
{"text":"Will wash dishes for this gelato. Great atmosphere, had a light lunch of caprese followed by a cup of gelato. Fantastic impact on my tastebuds."}
{"text":"- Awesome gelato (not that cheap sorbet-esque stuff)!! - Good paninis. - Wonderful owners!"}
{"text":"Gellato is always very enjoyable.. I recently had the whisky cream.  It was delicious.  My favorite item to get here are the canolis.  The owners are from an area around Milan so the items are authentic Italian.  Geary place.  Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome gelato. Tons of great flavors and very high quality. Decor is a little dated but that's not what you come here for-- it's the fresh and incredible gelato. Pastry is very good too. Treat yourself, you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"This is the finest quality of coffee, Gelato, Italian desserts,Sandwiches, Salads . You will feel like you are in Italy, only better! This owner -operating family is hardworking, so friendly and appreciative of your business; so a double enjoyment for you.They also make custom cakes. Enjoy the experience."}
{"text":"If you are having a craving for Gelato, then this is the place to go! I have been looking for a good place to get some Gelato for quite some time and now my quest is over. They have 30+ flavors of Gelato to choose from, like pistachio, hazelnut, rum and nuts, creme brulee, peanut butter, whiskey etc., and they even make certain flavors during certain seasons, like pumpkin and green apple for the Fall. You can also get a nice cup of coffee as well as some cannoli's and other baked goods. They even make Gelato cakes! This place is incredible!"}
{"text":"I can't really compare this to any other as I rarely eat it.  It was good.    The caramel flavor tasted more like toffee though."}
{"text":"Great place for smooth and flavorful home made Gelato. It also had a few dairy free sorbet, which my kids love! What a great place."}
{"text":"I have been to Italy and can personally vouch for this place being the real deal. By far the best gelato in town. My favorite flavors are black cherry, banana, and coconut."}
{"text":"This sounds cliché, but here goes.. Best Gelato in the Valley! I've had a coffee and a sandwich here as well and it was good. This is a fine selection of gelato that appears to be made by Italians."}
{"text":"I don't love gelato (or ice cream).  On the rare occasion I buy one of the two in the store, I buy one with stuff in it (and by stuff I mean cookie dough, candy pieces, etc...) and dig all the stuff out, leaving the base - much to the dismay of my husband.  Somehow we decided at work that we were going to seek out the best gelato in the area, ok it might have been my idea but still.....  I look to Yelp and find a few places to try including the very highly rated That's Amore.  The first place we tried was a let down, I'll get around to that review one day.  Next up, That's Amore.  This is the real deal.  I've never had gelato so delicious.  I got coconut and toffee in a medium dish, and tried a friends Toblerone - out of this world.  All were super creamy and packed with flavor, coconut tasting like real coconut and not industrial grade artificial coconut flavored something, buttery and nutty toffee and a downright decadent Toblerone.  You can get three flavors in the medium so just ask, it's all the same price - no up charge for the combo. With so many choices, you'll want to try a few at a time.  Everyone in our group raved about their selection.  I thought it was reasonable for the quality, a few weeks ago I spent $13 on a pint from the grocery store and it didn't hold a candle to this place.  I'm going back today."}
{"text":"The best.  My 2 young girls can't stay away and it is often something special that we do when we have a friend over or have just had a really bad day and need gelato to tun it around. My girls also collect the cute flutted plastic cups that they serve the gelato in. Great place, (atmosphere is simple)  but product if superior. Very friendly staff too."}
{"text":"A must stop every time I'm in Scottsdale.  The gelato is closest to the real thing that i've ever come across...probably because it's owned and operated by Italians!!"}
{"text":"THE BEST authentic gelato in town! I've been to Italy many times and That's Amore is the real deal ... Italian spoken here too!"}
{"text":"So I've been in Scottsdale for over five years and I seriously can't believe that last night was the first I heard of That's Amore! We had just finished dinner next door at Thai Pan and as we were saying Arrivederci to our friends who were headed out of town, I looked up and saw the sign. I said, \"what's that?\" My husband said \"That's Amore!\" \"What is it . . . let's check it out! Ooh, gelato!\" I said. He said, \"you go, I'll wait.\" I said, \"let's just get a taste.\" Twenty dollars later we took home four flavors of the most creamy and delectable gelato we've ever tasted.   The owner is the real Italian deal! He has a robust personality and was willing to let us try any (almost all) the flavors. He enthusiastically explained some of the flavors that were unfamiliar, offering up suggestions of what to pair with our chosen flavor, pushing little mini spoonfuls across the counter for our tasting pleasure.   My husband and I are typically on opposite ends of the flavor spectrum. He goes for the fruity and cookie type flavors; I go for the bold chocolates and coffees. Honestly, we couldn't have gone wrong with any of them. What we took home: Black Cherry, Coffee, Malaga (similar to but better than what we know as rum raisin), and Biscotto. If my husband allowed me to choose a few more, I would have gone for the Toblerone (incredible dark chocolate), Amaretto, and Dolci di Latti.   When I got home, I couldn't wait to put a little of each in one dish and devour it, and so I did. The Biscotto was the perfect selection to accompany any of the other three, so it will be a staple in our freezer.   Simply put . . . \"That's Amore\" . . . \"mi piace moltissimo!\" (Now go Google that!)"}
{"text":"I've never had such amazing gelato, ever. I usually can't eat a lot, but I couldn't stop eating this. The staff is so friendly, as well. I love that they're opened late, as well. It's a cute little shop & I won't go anywhere else for gelato besides here!"}
{"text":"Service is wonderful and the selection is outstanding. Free wifi which is also a plus. They offer free samples but only three so be careful what you choose! I recommend the toblerone!"}
{"text":"It was just okay. More like 2.5 stars but I'll round up to 3 because I appreciate mom and pop businesses vs. chains.   PROS 1. Lots of flavors.  CONS 1. The woman working there (probably the owner) was so miserable. Why be in a position requiring customer service if you act like you hate people, especially children? She seemed so annoyed with my 7 and 9 year olds, and they were being perfectly behaved while they were there. 2. Gelato tasted okay but I have had much better elsewhere."}
{"text":"Really delicious! The Toblerone gelato was amazing!! I can't eat at Gelato Spot anymore after trying this place. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Ever been to Italy and wish you could bring the real gelato home with you? That's Amore did just that. They literally brought the gelato bar from the old country and filled it with the most delicious, authentic, and interesting gelato treats imaginable."}
{"text":"Due to the power of Yelp, we had amazing treats!  Driving around, visiting for the weekend, I casually typed in ice cream and found this place nearby.  We were amazed with our results.  Gelato of every flavor was available.  Unable to decide, we got a dish with two flavors!  I mixed an amazing mint with a rich, dark chocolate toblerone.  I got a York Peppermint Patty result.  We also lived the cherry and Creme brûlée.  If you get to eat here you will smile!"}
{"text":"Their selection of flavors will leave you astounded. Not only is it vast, but the good gelato folks have prepared some enjoyable mixes for the Ammurican customer. Do try their whiskey cream if they have it out.   The gelato may be the best I've had outside of Italy and their cappuccino was done quite nicely."}
{"text":"Great little shop w/ Italian speaking owners lends warmth & authenticity to the whole experience. The espresso is out of this world, if you're in the area it's a nice break from the weather. Addio calore!"}
{"text":"Gelato heaven! Athletic Italian gelato and staff. They have every flavor you could want and then some. Reasonably priced and generous portions. Will definitely be back and would highly recommend"}
{"text":"Never had gelato before, but this stuff was awesome!  Had the whiskey cream and licked the bowl clean!"}
{"text":"I'm not going to describe gelato its symply great, very friendly owners, what I was impressed is coffee, simple but delicious"}
{"text":"So Yummy! The place is cute and the owners are from Italy. They have many flavors to choose from. They also have gelato cakes you can order and other desserts such as cannolis. I Have only had there Gelato but a customer leaving with a Gelato cake said that the Gelato Cakes are really good so I will have to try one. I ordered a medium size with three different flavors. The pistachio, creme brulee, and raspberry. I enjoyed all three flavors but if I had to choose one I would be stuck between the pistachio and the raspberry. They were creamy and the perfect temperature. I wanted more but, I was running out of time however, I will definately be going back!  I went here with my parents and I my Dad got coconut and loved it!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best gelato I've ever had. Try the creme brule.."}
{"text":"Our favorite summer ritual!!! Nothing beats their amazing gelato on a warm Arizona day. My daughter and I come here at least once a week. The family that runs this place always makes us feel very welcome. They have some pretty amazing espresso as well. Definitely a must when you're visiting North Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Amazing! So many flavors and you get to try 3 samples. Hazelnut and coffee was my choice and it was fantastic so glad I found this place."}
{"text":"I've only been twice and I don't even live in the area. When we come to visit we ask, no we demand, that we stop by That's Amore for some gelato. It is certainly worth leaving the air conditioned confines of the house during the extreme heat of the day for some refreshing, quality gelato. If you're looking for quality refreshment and gelato is what you're looking for then this is the place you need to go. Just do it."}
{"text":"That's Amore is awesome! I'm glad to see that a nice, clean and friendly local place is being supported and recognized. It deserves the five star ratings- the gelato tastes fresh and you really experience all of the flavor. It's a nice place to ride your bike to and get a refreshing treat when it gets hot."}
{"text":"Oh.My.Goodness. I went back to Italy tonite when I visited this Gelato shop.  It's legit.  So glad I found you.  It's Amore'!!"}
{"text":"Wow wow wow. ...and I am a picky gelato person. ...this place was really delicious. The consistency and flavor was just spot on. I had the peanut butter and the chocolate.. Hubby had the pistachio and bacio (aka. nutella). Really good. Definitely lived up to the reviews. --I tried the dill pickle and it seriously tasted like a dill pickle! ;)"}
{"text":"Don't know what else to say but \"Awesome Gelato\"!  The ladies that own this place are true Italians and know what they are doing. Paola is great and friendly and you can try any flavor you want as many times as you like.  Very good spot to have close to home. Go there frequently the Gelato is delicious and a great variety of flavors."}
{"text":"If this was a review just for their Gelato, they would be a solid 3 stars.  Not great, not bad.  2 Stars though because their bakes goods aren't that good and not worth the price.  3\" Square piece of Tiramisu was $6 and totally not worth it.  Cannoli, which again was supper small was not crispy.  The pastry portion had the texture from a Frozen cream puff that has thawed, filling was nothing special.  Might come back here but would only stick with the Gelato."}
{"text":"Honestly, the best Gelato I have ever had in AZ. Staff is so friendly, flavors are delicious and it is just overall a great spot for some homemade gelato."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! True Italian gelato from true Italian owners. I love this place."}
{"text":"My favorite gelato destination! So many flavors to choose from among other desserts and coffee. My favorite is amoretto. Everything is very fresh and has a Italian atmosphere. Great and friendly customer service and is family owned."}
{"text":"This is the best gelato outside of Italy! Well, maybe inside too since the owners are transplants. There are so many flavors here it is unbelievable!  Service and gelato are always great. You get what you pay for....worth every cent!!"}
{"text":"When the Gelato is actually made and served by a real Italian, it just tastes better.  This stuff is the real deal. I would say that when I go there I feel that I'm transported to Venice and that I'm eating the Gelato in the home country, but that would be an exaggeration.  It's still darn good even though I'm stuck in Scottsdale.  Ciao."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints. The best gelato ever. Tonight I had the Whisky Cream. From the first bite to the last.... Delicious!"}
{"text":"Reminds me of Italy!!! This place is excellent!! The owner is so friendly and nice! This is my daughters favorite gelato place. We will definitely go back! You will not be disappointed. Limoncello flavor is my favorite!"}
{"text":"I just discovered this little place and will definitely come back. I found here flavors that could find nowhere else, like hazelnut, malaga or three kinds of caramel. Happy:)"}
{"text":"I just got back from an amazing vacation in Italy. Gelato there is literally on every street corner. Coming back to the states was pretty rough at first, gelato withdrawals are not fun. I decided to try searching for a spot that might kick my craving and found this place. HOLY COW, this gelato is 100% authentic. The cappuccinos are amazing. The gelato is fantastic. I drove 26 miles for this and it was so worth it!! The cups are even the same as in Italy!! (I got chocolate and dulce de leche)"}
{"text":"Gelato was  good but  nada  Amore for me. Maybe it takes all their Amore to  labor over good gelato, but when you get handed over a 1/4  pint worth of gelato, with the $ 5 a pop gouge factored in  along with zero personality, or customer appreciation. That's Amore, I'm not so sure- eh."}
{"text":"The ONLY place for gelato in Arizona. Dozens of flavors to suit ANYONE's taste buds.....  Seriously great stuff. And don't forget to take some home in a large container!!!!!   Great coffee too!!"}
{"text":"I guess \"will travel for food\" (especially dessert) is an accurate statement in our case since it took us over half an hour to get to That's Amore Gelato! This cute little gelato shop in Scottsdale was one that my fiancé had found when searching Yelp. When we went in, I was mesmerized by all the different flavors of gelato they had to offer.  The texture was the first thing I noticed when I was trying the gelato samples; it was super thick and creamy. The couple of samples I tried were very tasty. I ended up getting the creme brûlée and peanut butter! Small was the perfect sized treat.  We would be willing to make the drive again! Definitely worth a stop in."}
{"text":"Authentic Italian gelato. Wonderful service and a nice little spot that is always easy to stop by. Consistent quality and service over the years."}
{"text":"this past Sunday night we finally got to try this place out after passing it for several years during our runs on the bike path. it was late Sunday night so i thought they might be closed, but luckily they have incredible hours (open til 10!).  i was a little disappointed with the selection as nothing really jumped out at me... that is, UNTIL my boyfriend asked for a few samples. everything we tried was delicious and i ended up going with the rum chocolate (i am so not a rum-flavored dessert person but it was probably one of the most tasty and original flavors i've ever tried). the Italian gentleman helping us was very helpful, friendly and welcoming. i look forward to making many more visits."}
{"text":"This place is such a gem! I love coming here, everyone is so nice an it's super clean inside all of the time. There are a ton of different flavor options from fruity sorbets to flavors like Stracciatella or Ferrero Rocher (my personal favorites). I highly recommend coming here for your sweet tooth cravings! You will not be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Holy great gelato - this place was amazing.  Got a small with 2 different flavors and was in heaven."}
{"text":"This is down the street from my parents home and our go-to dessert spot when I'm in town visiting them. This business is owned my some local Italians and they have a wide variety of homemade Gelato's and italian pastries.   They have 20+ flavors and always have a few limited edition seasonal flavors depending on the time of the year. It's a popular spot and the lines can get long but they go by quickly.   My favorite is the Amagala (rum and raisins) and coconut or peanut butter. My dad always goes for the whiskey cream (shocker ).   Try this place out, if you like good gelato I don't think you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"I love this place for gelato. The specialty flavors change seasonally and the cost of a nice sized cup of gelato is about $4. It's a value for delicious treat."}
{"text":"One of the top Gelato shops I've been to. It's hard to find the truly authentic gelato. That's Amore Gelato is the real deal. Just like back in Italy, fresh authentic gelato is what you'll get. I haven't had a disappointing flavor yet. Everything is delicious!"}
{"text":"True authentic gelato direct from Italy. It doesn't get any better than this, folks! I always order the same: two scoops: raspberry and dark chocolate.  Delicioso!!! Note: sometimes I even eat gelato for dinner.  As the slogan goes: life is short, eat dessert FIRST!"}
{"text":"This place is outstanding. Gelato was perfection in every flavor imaginable. Do not pass on the Italian pastries. Off the hook. I rarely if ever give any place 5 stars. My only regret is I did not try every flavor they had. Black Cherry perfection."}
{"text":"We always stop for gelato when we're in the area. I look forward to bringing my daughter someday as she has been to Italy and enjoys authentic gelato"}
{"text":"Love this place. Recently moved here from Gilbert where we always enjoyed gelato at Frost. That's Amore Gelato has been a great find. Terrific selection of flavors, pastries and friendly folks. Nice creamy gelato. Noticed it can get pretty busy in the evenings."}
{"text":"Love this place and they have the BEST Gelato in town!!  We love it when Davide is there! Super nice!!"}
{"text":"What a cute little neighborhood place!  I had heard about this place but it is tucked into a strip mall that I zoom by too often, so I was beginning to believe the place was just an urban legend.  But it is real!  I had to laugh at the two tastes only sign. With so many flavors to try I could see myself asking for a little taste of each before selecting just two.  We were there early on a Saturday evening, and the place was packed. But there is enough seating and people moved in and out fairly quickly since it is gelato. But they do serve sandwiches too, I just don't see why with all that gelato!"}
{"text":"I wasn't overly blown away. Given the reviews I expected more. All the comparisons to genuine gelato, I would say it's not likely you've been to Italy. It did not have the rich creamy flavor of gelato. It was overly sweet and sugary and cheap tasting. While I did enjoy it at a c rating there was nowhere to sit. We stood at an empty table that had no chairs. The environment was very sterile feeling under the cheap fluorescent lights with plastic cups and little shovel spoons. The spoons were so tiny like sample sized spoons. It was really bizarre. Not what I expected from the highest rated gelato place in the valley or from scottsdale. Americanized gelato experience.  Edit: editing to respond to the owners response simply to say I left my honest review.  I spent many years visiting Northern Italy and am very familiar with gelato. That is why I left this review. I've had it many times. There are gelato shops all over the small towns and large cities in Italy. I was excited to experience the gelato I missed so much as I actually did research looking for an authentic Gelato place here in the Valley. I'm aware it was busy but the table was available and was missing chairs."}
{"text":"Incredible authentic Italian gelato spot. Very friendly and professional service with the best gelato I've ever tasted. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Amazing place! Excellent gelato and coffee! I got the pistachio and toffee on a cone. Tried the chocolate rum, whiskey cream, and chocolate from my friends. Then we all got cappuccinos which were equally amazing!  There's a lot of seating inside and outside and it's relatively easy to find. Friendly service and a fantastic experience - no complaints!"}
{"text":"We are all watching our weight but sometimes during a heat wave we throw caution to the winds and we need to indulge in a creamy tasty gelato.  As usual the gelato here didn't disappoint...marscapone and fig,and limoncello..also gelato cakes here to order..the cakes are beautiful,and you pick the flavors and top design.  Wonderful for adult bdays"}
{"text":"Amazing gelato! I went here a whim and sure glad I did. A little expensive ($10 for a small cone and medium cup) but well worth it."}
{"text":"Wow! I was surprised at how many flavors there were! I studied abroad in Italy and had gelato almost every day there, and this store is probably the closest I've come to finding a place that is comparable to true Italian gelato.  The gelato is creamy, dense, and melts easily in your mouth which is how gelato should be. I always get the stracciatella, which is vanilla ice cream with fine flakes of chocolate usually from solid streams of chocolate in it, because every gelato place in Italy had it and it's a good comparator. This place had excellent stracciatella. There's also several vegan flavors as well for those who are vegan or don't like the cream based ice creams."}
{"text":"I lived in Italy for awhile a few years back and have been searching for great gelato here! Thank god I finally found it! Not only is the gelato amazing but the owners are all so sweet and you can tell they put a lot of love into their work! Thankfully I don't live to far but too those who do... it's definitely worth the drive!! Nocciola was always my fav in Italy and still is here :)"}
{"text":"Wow. The number of flavors of gelato That's Amore offers is truly impressive -- and all of it is delicious and made in-house! There are pastries and coffee, too. I got a kick out of seeing the gelato cake designs offered, as well. It's a good thing we don't live here -- we would come every day!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! You can tell the owners take great pride in their gelato. With a large assortment of flavors, there is something here for everyone! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I was so excited to get gelato from That's Amore from all the glowing reviews, and especially excited to get some gelato that tasted like that in Italy because that is something many reviews specifically say. Well the gelato tasted nothing like the gelato in Italy, which would have been perfectly fine if the gelato was good. I like ice cream, gelato, frozen yogurt, and none of it needs to taste \"authentic\", it just needs to taste good. I thought That's Amore's gelato was on the very low end of the different frozen desserts I've had. All the flavors I had were very muted, bland, and overall watery. Nothing like the gelato I enjoyed in Italy and nothing special compared to the other ice cream/gelato establishments around."}
{"text":"This is fabulous gelato--the likes of which I've not had since working at Chelsea's when we served Arlecchino.  Authentic, tasty, yumminess.  After dining out with my hubby and kiddo, I wanted some frozen yogurt.  Our server recommended gelato at That's Amore, which rung a bell because I remembered some guests that I waited on recently saying great things about it.  We were close by, so we stopped in.  I had a medium caramel gelato, which was reaaaaallly tasty.  Since my kiddo just had a whole portion of mochi during dinner, I didn't get him his own.  He shared a couple of bites of mine and loved it.  Hubby passed on gelato and had an espresso.  It was a bit pricey, but definitely worth it for the quality.  The shop is beautiful, warm, and nicely decorated.  I'm not sure how I missed that they were in that shopping center.  I've been there on several occasions and never noticed That's Amore.  They have a punch card, too, so I'm on a mission to fill it up :o)"}
{"text":"Hands down the best gelato in the valley. I have eaten here hundreds of times and have never been disappointed. Their gelato is always fresh and the family that owns it is always there. My favorite is the panna cotta. I could eat it till I explode! They also offer spectacular coffee/espresso and sandwiches. The place is amazing, it's like somebody brought Italy to you."}
{"text":"Great gelato.  There are many places that serve it, but none is better than That's Amore.  It is just around the corner from our house but that is not the reason I am rating this so high.  It is just plain and good authentic gelato.  Make the drive up to North Scottsdale and wait in the line to get yourself something you won't regret.  The service is quick and the helpings are generous.  Enjoy this delectable treat ( secret: Limoncello)."}
{"text":"Good gelato. A huge variety of flavors to choose from. The owner is very helpful, knowledgeable and friendly. This is a great way to finish off your meal from one of the nearby restaurants."}
{"text":"The closest eating gelato in Italy in the valley. The flavours are amazing and so delicious.  The staff are always friendly and the place is super clean. I only eat gelato here"}
{"text":"Seriously the best Gelato and Tiramisu I've had outside of Italy! Our family enjoyed black cherry, coconut, chocolate, and vanilla gelato and each one was delicious. Definitely a fantastic find! We took tiramisu for our dinner's dessert and were incredibly happy we did. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Sooo delicious! Finally tried this place a few weeks ago after driving by it so many times. I'm glad I found such a neat place only a few miles from my house.  I've had gelato at many places in Italy and Germany while living abroad, and this place stands up to the best of them. Quality gelato, friendly service, reasonable prices. Best of all, it's run by an Italian family! Can't get more authentic than that.  A small size costs $3.25 but you can get more than one flavor. Compared with how much I usually spend on mediocre frozen yogurt, it's a steal. My favorite flavors so far: hazelnut, coffee, and cappuccino. Next up, pumpkin!"}
{"text":"Best gelato ever! Bacio flavor is my absolute favorite! But they are all so good! I'm from a different state but whenever I pass through Scottsdale I make sure to plan time to get gelato!"}
{"text":"A piece of Italy in Scottsdale!  Wonderful.  Great gelato, very friendly staff.  Never disappointed in this place...consistently a great experience."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the gelato at That's Amore Gelato. The place was packed on a Sunday evening. You receive your choice of three samples of gelato flavors. I ended up ordering a medium cup of lime and rum and nuts flavor. Two completely different flavors with a mix of refreshing and liquor.   Plenty of parking spots available. The gelato place is in a strip mall area and towards the back area where the other restaurants are located. I was confused when the GPS took me to a dark section of the strip mall since the stores were closed for the evening.   Credit cards accepted."}
{"text":"We love that's amore! So many flavors - we haven't had a bad one yet. Our faves are lemon, peanut butter and strawberry. You can get two different flavors in one cup which really complicates things!!  The tasty gelato aside - this place has excellent hours and a super friendly vibe. We love going for gelato in the evenings (after dinner bribe) and their hours are perfect for this. We have to limit ourselves from coming too often!!"}
{"text":"Ok, I have not been very good at staying away from this place.  In the past month I have been there at least 3 times.  That is a lot for someone who is trying to avoid sweets.  Yes, yes, I am in denial.  I had pistachio when my mom came to visit.  My daddy used to love pistachio and as a child we always shared a cup.  It was really great, my mom had the Dolce Latte, that was to die for.  The sugar rush was awesome.  My twins had strawberry, of course, my little boy ends up eating half of his sister's cup.  He is an ice cream/gelato junkie.  Today, I stopped by again and had to have the Dolce Latte, YUM!"}
{"text":"Crazy delicious gelato, the best I've had outside of Italy.  Too many great flavors to say one is a favorite, but I tend to order the pistachio, spicy chocolate or stracciatella (the Italian gelato equivalent of chocolate chip ice cream). This place is heaven on a spoon."}
{"text":"Delizioso! It is the real deal! Now, that was just the thing to erase the super bad dinner we had had that night. My Bianco & Nero and Tartufo mix was just what the doctor had ordered. Everyone oohed and aahed over their choices and there was a lot of \"let me taste this\" going on."}
{"text":"The gelato here is amazing! It's gotten to the point where my husband and I refuse to eat frozen dessert anywhere else. We come about once a week and leave with a pint to go (each). Mint chocolate and dolce latte are definitely the best. I don't know what I'll do if I ever leave the area, definitely a hard place to beat and it's ruined me for store-bought ice cream and gelato."}
{"text":"Just amazing. The flavor of the gelato was out of this world. It will make you never want to purchase that fake stuff from the grocery store again. We had a great time reminiscing our Italian vacation while sitting in this little shop. We will be back!"}
{"text":"We drive from Shea and Via Linda passing 2 or 3 other places to get to That's Amore.  Most of the ingredients come straight from Italy and with the exchange rates and such in is not cheep but more then worth it. Love the coffee, hazelnut, and tartufu (sp) flavors.  This is a must stop for all of our out of town visitors and one of the first things they ask about when they get back.  It as close to the look and feel of the gelato places we enjoyed when we were in Italy.  A good place for a cup of espresso as well."}
{"text":"Nothing less than 5 stars for this fine family owned Italian place.  My favorites are pistachio and coconut on a cone."}
{"text":"Coffee and pasteries are delicious. Pasteries and cake are home made. Their Gelato the tastiest yet and variety for every taste. Don't miss. You'll be glad you went."}
{"text":"Wonderful gelato. Servers were neither friendly or helpful. Didn't pay attention to what flavors we asked for. Got one wrong for both of us. Think the servers were the owners?"}
{"text":"That's Amore opened a store on Hayden near Via de Ventura in McCormick Ranch, my neighborhood. I've been a patron since they opened.  The gelato is great, but I must say that the staff is strange.  If this location wants to survive they are going to need to pump it up a notch on the friednliness factor.  They give the feeling that you are interrupting whenever you visit.  Great product, servers that seem like they are distressed"}
{"text":"Before I moved to AZ I would make sure I had time to get gelato and a sandwich here!  It is amazing and the family who owns and operates it are amazing!  Some of the best food and treats I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Ok seriously. Heaven on earth. I'm all in with That's Amore Gelato! This place is one of my favorites spots. Their selection of gelato is fantastic.   You're always welcomed the second you walk in the door by family. Their customer service is on point. My 9 year old is a fan of gelato now and it's because of That's Amore.   Try the Biscotto gelato. Dear lord, it's freaking amazing.   Don't forget to ask for a punch card when you pay. Get there early, lines out the door."}
{"text":"The Italians....not only do they have the best food, some of the best wines, the most beautiful country-side....but now its confirmed...the best dessert...GELATO!!....what can be next?? I cant believe that this place has been here for 3 years....and its within walking distance to my own fort. These 2 italian women are definitely onto something here. This little shop has about 30 different flavors... so far I have tried the Tobblerone, Dolce Latte and Spagnola (eggnog!).....I will be back to try the 27 other flavors!"}
{"text":"This is absolutely the BEST gelato in the Phoenix area!!! Authentic home Made gelato, excellent service.... My only wish was it was in a different location so others would know of it!!!.... It just so wonderful!!  Toblerone is my absolute favorite!!. This place is a little hidden gem that absolutely deserves more recognition!!! Go a little out of the way and enjoy this absolutely wonderful Gelato!!!"}
{"text":"I had high expectations visiting That's Amore and was a little disappointed!  Hands down, Gelato Spot is the best place in the Valley to enjoy Italian gelato!  We tried the peach and the limoncello flavors and they just were not as good as equivalent flavors at Gelato Spot.  I did take home a mini cannoli and it was wonderful...I would certainly go back for another one of those!"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum! This place is really authentic! The owners are  lovely people from Milano Italy, where competition is fierce...In North Scottsdale I haven't seen any places like The Amore Gelato; They allow three gelato tastings per person! Three sizes,mix n' match flavors, under 6$ I had the cannoli with candied fruit pieces,chocolate & hazelnuts and rum raisin for a delicious medium combo that brought my tastebuds back to this summer in Milan within seconds!!! Definitely going back to try more treats!!!"}
{"text":"OMG!  And 20 other explicatives!   Simple. If you're looking for a gelatoria and especially if you're a gelato lover look no further.     This may be the best gelato I've EVER had!  No kidding and that's quite a statement considering I've had gelato from all over including Rome, Florence, and Venice Italy.  While there are a few other places out there that do contend, I've encountered none which I could say are better.  \"But what about the extremely popular Arizona chain 'The Gelato Spot'?\" you might ask; That's Amore blows it away - not even a contest.   The recent Mayweather Cotto fight was closer!  That's Amore is family owned and operated.  I chatted with one of the owners Paola who talked about her family's passion for gelato.  Growing up in Milan, Italy where they learned the trade they make no sacrifice on quality.   They make their own base locally from fresh natural ingredients and source the rest from only the best suppliers (mostly in Italy).  This may increase the price but the result is undeniable.  Every flavor I tried had perfect texture and a rich deep lasting flavor.  Simply phenomenal!!!  Flavors I tried (they have like 30-40 !!!! ):  Vanilla - bold creamy vanilla flavor; truly excellent Black Cherry - one of my favorites; considering they ran out, must be others too! Coconut - *very* solid but less exciting to me; Paola said this was her favorite Spicy Chocolate - surprisingly spicy ...and surprisingly addictive! Strawberry - full bodied flavor and a great complement to the spicy chocolate! Pistachio - a test of any decent gelato place; passed with flying colors of green, white, and red!   So funny that I literally just stumbled across this place after finding out another favorite gelato place \"Gelato Maker\" had closed.  Little did I know or certainly expect that turn of events would lead me to finding perhaps the best gelato place I've ever been to!   Try That's Amore for yourself and I'm sure you'll at least agree this place is fantastic if not the best you've had as well."}
{"text":"We drive over 30 miles from west Phoenix to That's Amore just for our Gelato fix. We are very faithful to this place and go no where else for gelato. The customer service is wonderful. So many flavors make it difficult to decide but they let you sample a few and are very patient explaining the flavors. Best place for gelato! Regrets? None! You'll only regret not checking it out."}
{"text":"Delicious true gelato! Would go again in a heart beat! We just returned from a romantic celebration of our anniversary in Italy, and were amazed at the variety of flavors and plethora of gelaterias. It was so nice to re-live that part of our vacation in North Scottsdale. I had caramel and my husband had chocolate chip and cherry. Yum!"}
{"text":"This is seriously the BEST gelato I have had outside of Italy. Maybe that is because it is owned and run by Italians!  That should be enough, but they carry over 30+ flavours of gelato even whipping up some unique seasonal flavours such as Green Apple and Pumpkin. I sampled the chocolate jalapeño gelato which was delicious but different! I can tell you I never saw that flavour in Italy.   I tried the Creme Brulee, Rum and Nut, and the Whiskey gelato. YUM!  I would love to stop in and have some coffee and a cannoli and maybe pick up a gelato cake for an event or birthday!"}
{"text":"Ok this is very embarrassing. My wife asked me to find a good gelato place the other week and so of course I turned to Yelp. Immediately this wonderful place showed up and best of all it had 4.5 out of 5 stars. A very rare find for any place let alone a gelato shop. And it was just my luck that it was like 5 minutes from the house. We walked In tonight and found an incredibly clean, authentic gelatoria. Of course the owner is from Italy. What an amazing place. There must be at least 40+ flavors. All the standards plus many cool exotics. And samples are free of course. I settled on a Medium cup which the owner fills with up to 3 flavors. I loved all of them especially the  limoncello. I loved it so much after my cup I ordered a quart to go. This place is Amazing. my wife and I were In Italy last year and the gelato here was better than all of the ones we tried Italy. The owner is a very nice guy and service was quick and efficient. Here comes the embarrassing part. I was sure that this place had only been open for less than a year as pride Myself on knowing all the places around my house. So I asked the owner expecting a \"less than a year\" answer. He said \"I have been here over TEN years\".  I was gobsmacked!   Anyway what an amazing place. Please if you love gelato come try this place, it is the real thing."}
{"text":"They have a great selection of flavors and everyone I have tried was pretty delicious. The only thing is depending on the amount of people working you might have to wait a while for service."}
{"text":"By far the best gelato , real Italian. They have so many great flavors making it difficult to pick just one.  A must have!!"}
{"text":"Amarreto and Whiskey Cream is the best alki combination when on vacation.  Even better when its fuzed into Gelato.  Everything here is awesome."}
{"text":"Yeah I \"found\" a new wonderful Gelato place ,  Boo ,  it's quite a trek across town for me, Yeah  they have lovely flavors like Toberlone, Hazelnut, Peanut Butter and more, Boo , the prices are a bit more than I normally pay, Yeah , My kids love it , Boo , now they are going to want to visit it again , Yeah, Husband and I can sneak over on date night after eating at Herb Box, Boo, Date night won't be  for  a few weeks. Yeah , the gelato is so authentic the owners are Italian, Boo , I am frightened they will go out of business like Sweet Life!"}
{"text":"Ive been here twice and THIS IS THE BEST GELATO I've ever tried. I recommend to split your cup with two flavors so you can try more than one. This time I had the rum with nuts and the hot chili chocolate. If you are sad you will feel happy afterwards. If you are old you will feel young. If you are poor you will feel rich. It is just that GREAT! I don't have words to tell you how amazing it was but I felt like I needed a cigarette afterwards and I don't smoke. BTW the pistachio is just as good too!  Just amazing, it's just the best!   This is a MUST TRY.   GO HERE!  They also make some Italian Sandwiches ,  these teeny weeny delicate tiny fruit tarts that look like they belong in a doll house , Other assorted pastries and they carry some Italian Candies."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!  We finally found authentic Italian gelato here in Scottsdale. This tastes like what you get over in Italy with all the same flavors you may have had in Europe but unable to find here in the States. You know it's great because every time I'm in there, the place is full of Italians! It's a bit of a drive if you don't live up north but well worth it."}
{"text":"Best Gelato in Scottsdale! Taste just like Gelato you find in Italy.   It's family owned and has multiple flavors!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Even the gelato in Italy doesn't compare! There are a million awards on their wall and they have been in business for a long time because their gelato is fantastic. I feel lucky to live next to a small business that I can support. I've been here on weekends and weekdays and it's always packed."}
{"text":"This is the BEST gelato that I have found aside from Italy. The family is/has family from Italy so I'm assuming their recipes come from Italy too. This is seriously a little piece of heaven!!! The pistachio and black cherry taste just as they did in Italy. Look no further for gelato!"}
{"text":"AmaZing!! Thai was our first visit here and definitely not our last. We got Strawberry, Banana, black cherry and a Nutella flavor, and they were all Fabulous! Highly recommend this place and the owner was very nice and friendly as well!"}
{"text":"No need to go anywhere else in the Valley best gelato here.  is the real deal family even comes from Italy ! pretty much all the flavors are amazing but I would say our favorites are pistachio any of the chocolates and the panna cotta. The tartufo is HEAVEN!!! I really don't waste the money going anywhere else it's not that convenient to my house but we make the trip about once a month"}
{"text":"Was looking for cold treat and found this place.  Large gelato selection and Italian pastries too.  Had the whiskey creme and toberlone as an affogato.  Google affogato if don't know what that is. Once you have one you'll be back. Family had strawberry and also dolce latte and both said were very good.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The gelato here is amazing, no to sweet just perfect so many great flavors. I think our family just found a new favor spot for treats."}
{"text":"Our family loves this place.  Great gelato flavors and pastries.  A bit crowded at night but worth the wait. Molto Bene!"}
{"text":"This place is SO GOOD! Gelato and Italian pastries! Flavors like coconut with chocolate chips, pistachio, lemoncello, marscapone and fig, strawberry, and of course chocolate! You can try a couple before you decide (especially if you want to try something new)."}
{"text":"I've just died and gone to gelato heaven! Truly the best gelato I've ever had! And the cannoli is truly something special. I'm only in town a couple days but will definitely be back before I go.  If your trying to decide where to go, look no further, this is the spot."}
{"text":"excellent service, excellent authentic home made gelato!!! we're coming back for more today!!"}
{"text":"First visit after chowing some Italian down at Lorenzo's, just around the corner a piece.    OMg!  Decisions, decisions!  What flavor do they not have!  DH got this black cherry, chocolate and nut mix (forget the name) and I got the biscotti.  It was all very good---intense flavors, very creamy and not a bit of iciness.  I don't know gelato too well, but I really liked it.  The pastry case offerings looked incredible.  Maybe next time I will eschew the gelato for a cappuccino and a pastry!   The store was bright and cutely decorated and clean and very crowded for a Wednesday night at 8.30.  You can tell it's the neighborhood gelato-spot.  Everyone seemed to know everyone!  NOT a low calorie way to end the evening, but we'd already gone for the gusto, so...  Now DH and I have to go back, because there were so many other flavors we want to try.  That will be fun on a super-hot evening!"}
{"text":"5, 5 and more 5's.  This place is the real deal.  It's an Italian family who owns this gelateria and not only does the gelato taste just like what you get in Italy but also the look and feel of the place is exactly like the gelaterias in Italy.  Also try the tiramisu and the Cannoli which are wonderful.  While, finish you gelato with a wonderful espresso which again is cento per cento authentic.  We are an Italian family from Lake Como and this is just like being back home.  Ben fatto!"}
{"text":"I have been to Italy several times and experienced Gelato almost daily for a year.  I absolutely love Gelato and know a good product and a great product...The Gelato at That's Amori is fantastic...The best in the Valley and as good as any Gelato I had in Italy...The owners are 1st generation Italian ... Family owned and operated..Very nice people...Truly a fun, yummy experience...I  am there at least once a week..."}
{"text":"That's Amore DESERVES all 5 stars! Incredible, authentic gelato. I have been coming here since they opened, and they have been consistently great over the years.  I have tried a variety of flavors, but Bacio and Chocolate are typically my go-to flavors. Very rich and creamy, just getting a small satisfies my gelato craving. The toffy is delicious as well, as is the white chocolate..and well, I cant think of any flavors I have eaten here that I have not really liked.  Great for a cold treat during the brutal summers, LOVE this place and recommend it to anyone in the area!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best gelato place in town! Coffee? Gelato? Or cannoli? That's my question every time. I always end up with a pistachio gelato and another flavor rotating between coffee, tiramisu or a random flavor I have the mood for. Pistachio is my all time fav - it's so soft, not too sweet, and you get blown away by the pistachio flavor and the actual pieces. Coffee goes hand in hand with gelato to balance out the creaminess. The owners are very friendly and are always smiling. The only tip I would put here is that they open at 1pm on Sundays (not 11am like the other days). Don't go too early! Hope the gelato or cannolis will light up your day like they did for me!"}
{"text":"Not only it That's Amore gelato the best around, it may be the only one around the Pinnacle Peak area. Consistently delicious and friendly. Highly recommended by my family and friends."}
{"text":"Would give them 6 stars if we could! Amazing gelato and plenty of flavors to choose from. They also have amazing pastries.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Nobody does gelato like that's amore! If you are looking for very authentic, delicious gelato this is the place to go. Their coconut gelato is really good and compares to the coconut gelato I got in Italy! You won't regret trying this gelato, trust me!"}
{"text":"Amazing, authentic gelato that really needs no other explanation.  Gelato cakes for parties are perfect.  Cornetto, pistachio, cherry(nice and sour) are where it's at, but you really can't fail at this joint."}
{"text":"I had a shot of expresso with cannoli for my morning treat. Paula gave the two items to me despite not having my wallet or money. I returned in the afternoon to pay my bill and fulfill my sweet tooth. Omg so creamy, each taste was delicious and then the two final selections were very flavorful. 5 stars for the gelato. I had excellent service by Paula, so I tried a few more desserts.   My favorite was the lemon custard cake with almonds atop (Gramma cake), can't wait for another slice. It was creamy, crunchy, tart and sweet , simply very enjoyable."}
{"text":"This is was, WAY out of the way for me. But when I heard about That's Amore, I just had to try it. What can I say, I love gelato! Anyway, one afternoon I talked the kids into a Sunday drive with cool gelato as the reward.  While That's Amore gelateria is located in a strip mall (what in Arizona isn't?), the taste and style are pure Italian. Credit the fact that it is owned and operated by two sisters and their husbands who emigrated to Scottsdale from Italy. The murals of Italian cities on the back wall were even painted by their father, who they brought to the valley for just that purpose. How cool is that? It might not make the gelato taste better, but it almost made a ride to Pinnacle Peak feel like a trip to Napoli instead."}
{"text":"This gelato is good- not as good at Frost but its a really cute atmosphere and the staff is friendly. Since it's close to home I go often and the flavor selection is great!"}
{"text":"This was a welcome oasis of gelato in the middle of north Scottsdale.  It is nice to find a locally owned business putting out some quality product. I had the black cherry gelato but fell in love with the pistachio.  The flavors were inense and the texture was typically dense and gooey!  This is a destination if you love gelato (im getting tired of froyo!)!"}
{"text":"The best gelato around. I always opt for the pistachio flavor. Tonight they were out of pistachio so I tried Bacio (light chocolate and hazelnuts) absolutely delicious.   A great place to get gelato, coffee and Italian deserts."}
{"text":"Love coming here. The gelato and coffee remind me of being in Europe. Lovely family runs this perfect cafe. Sandwiches are absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"Really delicious gelato. The place is adorable too. It is always a treat to stop here."}
{"text":"All I can say is I am going back tonite for dessert. Incredible service. Best gelato EVER!  Too many flavors to choose. Just visiting from the Florida Keys, good thing because I would be here daily if I lived here"}
{"text":"The owners here are wonderful, and the gelato is as close to being in Italy as your going to get."}
{"text":"After much looking for authentic Italian Gelato in Arizona I must say That's Amore Gelato nailed it!!!  I have just gotten back from Bologna Italy and actually took a course in making Gelato and craving some good gelato away from Italy is a tough order to fill. I had the chocolate and the whiskey creme. IT was a little cold but the flavor was perfect. the texture was creamy and the presentation was beautiful.  Beyond all that..... I have to say the people working there made it fun to be there. they are as passionate about their gelato as I was about eating it! I will be back and bringing friends! (GREAT FIND)"}
{"text":"Awesome little shop. The gelato was absolutely delicious!  The wife, kid, and I truly enjoyed it. We will definitely make our way back when in the area."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! Tartufo is my favorite!"}
{"text":"We have been back so many times and have brought other along for this delicious gelato and pastries. The service is friendly. The sorbet is unlike any sorbet! Try it you will love it!"}
{"text":"Best authentic gelato out there! Soooo many delicious flavors and at a good price! I come here all the time! Service, flavors, and price are worth it! I tend to switch up my order all the time but they are super accommodating to letting you try a flavor or so before buying. I also don't feel so bad about eating it because it's not overly sweet. Super yummy!"}
{"text":"Best Gelato outside of Italy. if you're ever in North Scottsdale or 9ave 9reek do yourself a favor and stop here."}
{"text":"Love, Love, Love! My husband is a 1st gen Italian and he loves this place. The gelato is amazing and the total Italian feeling from when you walk in and leave is great! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times, and the gelato is decent but the owners .... especially the wife make you feel sorry you ever walked in there.  She never greets you, never smiles and seems seriously annoyed when you ask for samples or can't decide what flavor you want fast enough.  We would love to frequent this place, but just won't go back.  It's just too unpleasant!"}
{"text":"Great gelato, great selection and great people.  What a special place. NOT TO BE MISSED!!!"}
{"text":"Everything they have is incredible I LOVE this place. The staff are all incredibly nice and friendly! I go to That's Amore at every chance that I get"}
{"text":"We've been coming here for a couple of years. Hands down THE BEST Gelato in AZ! 100% authentic Italian. So many flavors to try and they are all fantastic. If you like sweets, it's a must try."}
{"text":"Stracciatella is fantastic. So is the pistachio, white chocolate, banana, plain vanilla, and spicy chocolate.  I could go on and on about the absolutely amazing gelato here. It's run by an Italian family and the quality.... Well, the quality couldn't be any better. This place is THE place to go for the best gelato in the valley.  I've had gelato all over the world as well as all over this country, and this place wins, hands down. I urge you to come and try them out. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This is what gelato is about .The texture, the flavor oh my goodness..I had the black cherry w\ choc chips ( had a fancy Italian name) he had the pb both were So good.The portions were generous for the price point.We had a latte to very well done the owner was professional and knowledgeable such a find !"}
{"text":"Hands down THE BEST gelato / desert spot in the valley. A true hidden gem, I keep going back here every week to try new flavors - and they have SO MANY!  If you are visiting scottsdale/phoenix this is worth the drive to experience absolute perfection."}
{"text":"The very italian owner is so nice and apparently uses a family  recipe.  It's incredible! you get three flavors with a medium.  FYI, the Whisky cream is amazing.  I also had peanut butter and a chocolate chip.  All were very good! My wife had biscotti, cappucino, and dulche latte.  All were delicious.  We are only in phoenix for 5 days, but we plan to go again while we are here!"}
{"text":"Amazing gelato! Had the coconut and banana. Visited twice in five days while in town on vacation, would have been more had they been open on the 4th of July. We were there at 9 am before we left town. Gelato for breakfast...why not!!"}
{"text":"It's all in the name.  A few of my work colleagues and I had some gelato and a Parma here and it was AMAZING.  The overall feel of the establishment is accomodating and family kitchen style.  You can taste everything, customer service was great and speedy and overall best gelato I've had in quite some time.  The flavors are tongue acrobatics and sensory soothing.  Loved it and I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"You ever visit a place and feel transported? That's how I was when I came to That's Amore Gelato on Saturday. We had time to kill before a movie and I wanted to try this place out. Located up in north Scottsdale, this quiet area was fairly busy when we arrived but it only took a few minutes for our turn. I loved the full-size wall mural, it really did make me feel like I was in Italy. Cute place.  To cut down on indecisiveness, only 3 samples are allowed. I sampled the dark chocolate and decided to go with my first choices of Bacio and chocolate. A great combo, next time I will try chocolate and coffee. I got a small size and it was plenty for me. My brother tried the peanut butter and Toblerone in a medium cup and commented that the classic chocolate would've been a better pairing. They also had plenty of sorbet flavors.   The owners are nice and efficient and I really liked this spot. I'd love to come back and try other flavors, as well as their cannolis."}
{"text":"Reminded me of eating gelato in Italy. Tiramisu is excellent. Also have cafe and cannoli."}
{"text":"After having this place bookmarked for almost a year, I finally tried it and I am so glad I did! It was delicious. Upon first arrival, the outside is nondescript but the inside is open and welcoming. There are several places to sit, a gelato case, and a pastry case. They even serve coffee/espresso drinks. The staff was very nice. I was greeted by a friendly employee before I browsed the gelato case. They have A LOT of flavors but luckily you can sample a few. I tried the Whiskey Cream and decided that was my flavor of the day and ordered a scoop. I savored every bite, except for the few bites I let my husband try. He really enjoyed it as well. I will definitely be back to try one of their other flavors."}
{"text":"Great gelato with an authentic Italian proprietor. Large selection with small samples if you can't decide. We'll definitely need to return to try more flavors."}
{"text":"The owner told me he makes his gelato just the way he made it in Rome. Well, Rome's loss is Phoenix's gain, because I think his gelato is about the best I ever had--and I've eaten gelato all thru Italy and I can prove it by my pants size.   Only one place had gelato this good in Italy to me, and that was near the art museum in Florence. This is gelato at it's finest!  Only complaint I have is that it's too far from my home...pooh!"}
{"text":"The best gelato in Phoenix? The best gelato in all of Arizona? Christ, one person even says it's the best gelato outside of Italy! Sometimes, I wish people wouldn't say things like this, because it really skews your expectations.  Let's be honest here. Amore is good, don't get me wrong. But a lot of gelato places in Phoenix are good. Is it the best I've ever had? Most certainly not, and that's without ever visiting Italy, but eating one whole hell of a lot of gelato here in the U.S.  Anyway, my girlfriend and I stopped by on a late Saturday night to find Amore to be pretty packed. It appears to be a go-to place for many people in the surrounding neighborhood based on what I've read. In addition to gelato, they also offer Italian bakery goods that are similar to what you'd find at most Italian delis or bakeries.   We kind of felt very rushed walking in, as other people immediately came in right behind us. The guy behind the counter didn't ask us if we wanted to sample anything, so we assumed it was forbidden. Only later did we discover that you can, indeed, sample flavors if you wish.  Anyway, I do like that they'll let you do half-half flavors in a small size, without forcing you to purchase a bigger cup. I ordered half limoncello and half bacio, which is similar to the flavor of Nutella or Gianduia. My girlfriend ordered a combination of both cinnamon and bianco & nero (black and white). The cinnamon, in particular, was very good and reminded her of the flavor of a well-made Mexican horchata.   Flavor was very good. Their gelato texture is more on the creamy aside, which is definitely not a bad thing at all. Clearly, it's one of the better options in East Valley to be sure.  Recommended!"}
{"text":"If I could give That's Amore 10 stars I certainly would. Whenever I go I always get the creme brule and cappuccino mixed and OH...MY...GOD is it the best gelato ever!!! If you haven't been here yet, your life is not yet complete."}
{"text":"Gelato was the best here.  One man doing it all when we were here.  It's really in a nice area.  Will definitely return when I'm in the area.  Mmm,  salty caramel flavor."}
{"text":"It is not easy to find actual gelato ( some places call it gelato, but really it is ice cream.) This one is real gelato. Many flavors. Easy to enjoy again and again."}
{"text":"Went to Italy a few months ago. This place matches any of the top gelato shops back in Italy. Plenty of seating indoors and out."}
{"text":"That's Amore has the best gelato I've had outside of Italy. It is the same consistency as in Italy, and the flavors are amazing. They have a large selection of flavors. They also have some pastries. My favorite flavor is Stracciatella; my go to flavor at any gelato place in Italy. You are able to try three samples, I believe. The owners are very friendly. It is quite the treat to come here!"}
{"text":"The BEST GELATO EVER! I have many favorites, but my  latest combo is lemon cello and white chocolate is a WINNER! It's like a slice of heaven!! Feel like I'm in italy!!"}
{"text":"Fabulous place!  Very clean, nice and friendly place AND the best gelato anywhere!!! I always go there after dinner in North Scottsdale."}
{"text":"On the morning of NYE 2013, I went hiking with a couple of buddies in the McDowell Sonoran Preserve. As a reward for our outdoorsmanship, two of us went to grab coffee afterward. I don't know this area very well, but using the Yelp app, I found That's Amore Gelato by searching for \"coffee\".  We had a hard time finding them at first and almost went somewhere else. We stopped at Something or other Café and asked if they had espresso... Nope, so we left. Begrudgingly we continued our search for That's Amore.   Aha! I found an address number. We were in the right shopping center but on the wrong side. That's Amore is located in the shopping center on the SE corner of Pinnacle Peak Rd and Miller Rd. It's in the Southern portion of the shopping center next to a Thai restaurant.   I hope that helps you find them because this place is worth being found. I usually order espresso, but when I'm with this particular friend, he always orders his espresso with a dollop of foam on top so I generally will just have the same. This particular day when he ordered at That's Amore, the lady said, \"Okay, you want a Macchiato\".   That caught my ear but I didn't say anything. I don't think my buddy caught on at all. He didn't care what she called it, as long as he got his espresso the way he wanted it. When she presented us with the final product, it was perfect. Exactly what he orders every time. I would say it was also a little prettier than usual. The taste was very good as well.   That brings me to today. I've been thinking about how this lady corrected my friend and told him his drink was called a Macchiato. I'm used to drinking a Caramel Macchiato from Starbucks and they're nothing like the drink I had on NYE.   I Googled \"Macchiato\" and much to my amusement, the drink I've always consider to be a \"Macchiato\", was completely wrong. A macchiato is simply a double shot of espresso with a dollop of milk foam. The word \"macchiato\" actually means \"marked\", in Italian. The espresso is getting \"marked\" with a little bit of milk or milk foam. The drink called, \"Caramel Macchiato\" at Starbucks, is actually more of a Latte since it's mostly Milk.   BOOM! I have been learned!   I thought this was a great moment in my coffee knowledge history. It's the little things really, and I'm excited to have been enlightened by the lady at That's Amore Gelato. Oh yeah, that's brings me to another point. They have Gelato. Weird, right? I didn't try it on this day, but look forward to it in the future.   5 Stars for increasing my Brain Power, and for becoming my new spot to grab coffee after hiking in the Preserve.   If you're interested in the article I read, Here ya go. It's worth checking out for the Funny or Die video alone: http://alloveralbany.com/archive/2013/09/04/are-you-sure-you-want-a-macchiato"}
{"text":"My favorite place to get dessert! All of the flavored are SOO good and don't taste too sugary. They're all fresh and handmade. The canolis are so rich and the best I've had in Arizona! The owners are very kind and the service is always wonderful. Love it!"}
{"text":"I haven't had gelato in a long time and this was a treat.  The gentlemen behind the counter was friendly, but not overly so.  He let us taste a few of their offerings and I have to admit I really liked the spicy chocolate.  It did have quite a bite, and at 104degrees, I went with my standard favorite pistachio.  I was convinced to add the amaretto which was a great pairing.  When I'm Arizona visiting my friend, I'll be stopping by here again.!"}
{"text":"With its thick creamy texture and delicious mouthwatering, authentic taste, this is the best gelato I've EVER had! I had previously read the reviews for That's Amore, which is why I decided to come in, and this cute shop without a doubt lives up to its 5 star rating and raving comments. When you walk in, there are so many different flavors that meet you at the door, each beautifully crafted and presented, that it makes it had to choose one and not to ask to try them all individually! I decided to go simple with 1/2 vanilla and 1/2 carmel in a medium size, which was almost too much since the flavor is so rich, but was so good that I wanted to eat it all! While a lot of people have said they drive great lengths to come here, I'm lucky enough to live somewhat close by, so I will definitely be returning regularly. :)"}
{"text":"Best Gelato in Arizona!! True authentic, tastes like the gelato I enjoy when in Italy.   Love the peanut butter and biscotto."}
{"text":"Smooth rich tasting gelato.  The flavors are more creamy-based rather than fruit based, and they have a few unusual flavors such as pine nut.  They also have a selection of chocolates, cannolis, and various Italian cookies to choose from."}
{"text":"Best. Gelato. Ever. Reminded me of being in Rome. Did I mention best gelato EVER? After eating here, you will become a gelato snob and will not settle for less."}
{"text":"Liked it. One of their fridges is down, so selection maybe limited. Owners are great guys too, very friendly and helpful. Let us taste quite a few gelatos for free. Would give 5 stars if the selection was more."}
{"text":"UPDATE: RE THE OWNERS COMMENTS LOL reminds me of the infamous Amy's of Kitchen Nightmares fame... where they could never be wrong. I know a filthy bathroom and I was grossed out, so note to self, never go back here, there are plenty of other gelato joints. =========================== Finally got around to trying this place, was super hard to find but after riding around the place for a while I figured it out but could use a decent sign!  Taste was pretty authentic. I noticed pastries and wondered if they made themselves but did not ask.  CONS: the bathroom sink was filthy - looked like it had not been cleaned in months!"}
{"text":"Hands down, best gelato I've had in the Valley!  They do have other items (other sweets, sandwiches, etc) and I intend to get around to trying those, but it's hard to focus on anything else when that delectable gelato is calling your name!  That's Amore: please open a second location a little farther south!!!"}
{"text":"Better than the gelato in Florence Italy. Must try the chili chocolate with the black cherry. Outstanding!"}
{"text":"Gelato here is always a treat. I had the bianco and negro which was a combo of white and dark chocolate. Very good. And also I tried the dolce latte. It was excellent with a strong caramel and a bit of nuts. We enjoy stopping in when in the north Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"BEST gelato around! Went to The Gelato Spot today and it was gross compared to this place. Definitely worth the small drive to get quality, smooth, authentic italian gelato! I absolutely LOVE the Tiramisu gelato here!! Limoncello is delicious, vanilla, banana, peanut butter... EVERYTHING!"}
{"text":"Amazingly fantastic! Had the Whiskey Cream which my husband who is not a whiskey fan absolutely loved. I had half-and-half of Black Cherry which was delish and Tartufo which was chocolately and nutty. Simply devine! Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Best Gelato, CANNOLO and PANINI!! Try the coffee on a cold evening! Family owned and operated!! Love this place!!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable gelato! The selection is second to none. Italian run, this venue is exceptional. That's Amore has single handedly turned me into a gelato lover."}
{"text":"The best gelato, I love this place!!  The owners truly make this place special.  Not a not gelato but Italian panning & traditional Italian pastries."}
{"text":"Sooo delicious!   Pros -  Almost identical to the gelato I had all over Italy Lots of gelato flavors and quite a few pastries as well They speak Italian so it really gives a nice authentic feel  Cons -  Location, its kind of a hike. But I assure you it's worth it!"}
{"text":"We loved the gelato! They had so many yummy flavors to choose from, but it makes it hard to decide!  The best deal was getting a gelato-to-go container for $10.77.  It was huge!  You can pick 3 flavors and 3-4 people can share it!  You can also take it home!  Yum!  I really enjoyed the creme brûlée gelato!"}
{"text":"Possibly my first time having non store bought gelato. I found this place using yelp and trip advisor and it's a bit of a hike from my house but since I had nothing but time, I figured I'd give it a show. It's located in a strip mall but I had no problem finding it. I walked in and there were so many flavors. At least 25-30 and I had no idea what I wanted. Then I saw a sign that said only three samples. I've never been so stressed picking out a flavor as many of them I didn't even know what the name meant. The man asked for here or to go and I said to go which were different sizes I guess. I picked the middle container for $11.00 roughly. He could put three flavors in it. He had me try a few flavors and i really liked the pistachio so I chose that one for my container. My other two picks were a shot in the dark because I had reached my sample allotment before finding another that I really loved. I chose amaretto and Toblerone. He packaged it up, I paid and went along my way. Got home and tried each. Very happy with my choices. The amaretto was very tasty and just how I imagined it would taste.  Also the Toblerone was wonderful. Very rich dark chocolate. Such a nice Saturday treat. Boyfriend will be happy when he gets home and finds out I didn't eat the whole thing too. The price is a little steep but I have a feeling the ingredients are quality. Looking forward to next time I get to indulge in That's Amore."}
{"text":"Best gelato I've had anywhere outside of Italy itself.  In all honesty, better than many gelaterias I visited in Italy!  Paola is great, as is the entire staff.  The flavors are exquisite and so varied.  I always find myself making excuses as to why I need to stop by That's Amore at different times of the day.  Late morning, noon, or night, it is always a good decision."}
{"text":"Good old fashion Italian owned and operated Gelato!  It can't get any better than that!  Oh wait, it can!  They have a great selection of flavors!  You won't have a problem finding the right one to fit your fancy.  Spicy chocolate gelato!  Check!  Toblerone gelato!  Check!  Among others this place is a gem.  I was a little disappointed that they only allowed 3 tastings per customer.  Considering that they literally have like 30 flavors it does make it difficult to decide what you're going to indulge in.  I guess I'll have to come back for more!"}
{"text":"Excellent collection of gelato. We tried total 11 types so far and all are good. Whisky cream is the best one. The vanilla is also much better than any other place. We'll visit again soon."}
{"text":"That's Amore Gelato is a bright, roomy, and comfortable place to buy and enjoy gelato (and a few baked treats such as canoli).  The service was friendly and helpful, the prices moderate, and the selection superior.  Everyone gives it five stars, but based on the three flavors we ate, Amore does not deserve it.  The problem is the gelato itself, specifically the flavors.  The tartufo gelato was entirely bland -- no flavor at all.  Ditto the combined nutella and white chocolate, which was also astonishingly sweet.  The whiskey gelato was the best of the lot.  I am tempted to return to try some more flavors because this is a place you really want to love. Maybe someday."}
{"text":"A sweet little Italian place that shouldn't have been difficult to find but turned out to be an adventure.  If you're on your smart phone, don't auto click for directions.  Copy and input the address to your map app. to find this place.  Trust me, you don't want to be doing a tour of the timeshare homes of Arizona.     Lots of varieties of creamy gelatos; perfect for an after meal dessert.  The fruit gelatos were sweet and refreshing - they certainly have a wide range of fruity flavors for you to choose from.  The chocolates and dessert based gelatos are heavier on the tongue and would go lovely with a smokey cup of espresso, which they serve right in the shop.  Definitely give this place a try if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Has to be one of the best gelato places out there. They also have great sandwiches and coffee - very smooth coffee. My sons favorite is the pumpkin gelato which is only out seasonally so go soon. Staff are very Italian which says it all"}
{"text":"That's Amore Gelato is by far the best Gelato in Arizona. If you come here in the evenings there is a line but it's so well worth the wait.  The entire staff is extremely friendly and helpful! You get to sample 2 flavors, usually the first one you try, is the one you buy, that's how good this gelato is.  Wonderful flavors, great ambiance, and super friendly service. Homemade (made in-house) - flavors like biscotto, banana, chocolates of all sorts, too many to list. There are so many unique and creative flavors to try. I can't name one that is my favorite, I've tried about all of them and they are all so good.  If you're up in the area or not, trust me, That's Amore Gelato IS THE place for true gelato in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I find it amusing that a place with such good yelp reviews needs to resort to bot voting to try to win the best of azcentral's best ice cream poll. Good gelato but I'll knock off two stars to the owners who have to use trickery to try to influence people. I wonder how many of their 5 star yelp reviews are phony also."}
{"text":"Eccelente! I am constantly on the look out for Italian gente, and as soon as we walked into That's Amore, I knew I had found some.   It was late and a little girl was in the window. She told me her favorites: nocciola, amaretto, e stratacella - a woman of traditional tastes. Her father was cleaning up, and clearly ready to close, but he graciously served us. We shared short Italian banter - his daughter is clearly the talker in the family, and she loves to entertain.   Their selection of gelati is extensive. I have enough trouble choosing amongst 12 flavors, so this was just clearly going to be the biggest challenge of my night. I went with the little girl's faves - nocciola e amaretto. Delizioso. My date went for fruit - chocolate coconut and raspberry (lampone). Also excellent. The flavors are rich and the gelato creamy. Their store is fairly large and bright. Their display case is huge and its contents induce immediate salivation.  Two brothers and their wives run two locations. They are local, traditional, and a very nice family. I will definitely make the drive out to see them again. I love good gelato."}
{"text":"Best gelato I've ever had, including in Italy"}
{"text":"I will keep this short and sweet.  This place is dope. If you are in the mood for gelato or ice cream or anything cold and yummy and live in the north scottsdale area this place is an absolute must.  Can't recommend this place enough!"}
{"text":"We just happened to stumble upon this place one day while driving around. I had a mix of dolce latte with creme bule and it was amazing! It kind of caught me off guard. Will absolutely most definitely come back the next time I feel like gelato."}
{"text":"Best gelato ever, so happy my in laws showed me this gem. They have so many flavors and they are all delicious. Very authentic place. My favorite flavor is the tiramisu and the cannolo. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"So many flavors. So delicious. I had the whisky cream and coffee in medium sized waffle cone. My husband ordered a pistachio in a small waffle cone. He loved it and I loved it. This place is simply delicious. I definitely will come back again."}
{"text":"Best gelato ever. Ive been coming here for years and have always had the best experience. The atmosphere is like Italy and the employees are outgoing and funny. All of the gelato flavors are to die for. The portion sizing is perfect the quality is out of this world. Best gelato I've had my whole life. There are so many flavors to choose from. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for great desserts or gelato. A+++++"}
{"text":"Good Gelato, variety of flavors, great service, busy on a Saturday evening after dinner. It was a little pricey."}
{"text":"Possibly one of the best gelato places in the US. I had gelato in different places in Italy and this place is not any less than any of them. There are so many flavors to choose from."}
{"text":"Gelato is delicious. Lots of selections to choose from. A taste of Italy right here in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!  They have every flavor of gelato you could want. Very reasonably priced. Great place to go after dinner. I haven't tried the pastries, but they look amazing."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best gelato I've ever had.  Better than Rome! Worth every penny. Also helped that it was served up by a very hunky Italian guy."}
{"text":"Great spot for some awesome gelato. Lovely owners who know the ropes.  Love this place!  You will too!  Try it!"}
{"text":"The best gelato EVER.  Flavors taste natural and fresh.  Huge variety.  I have been  in Scottsdale one week and visited three times."}
{"text":"Are you kidding me!!!! This place is just the best...hands down...every single time we come it's just amazing. Check out the pic!!! 9pm and this place is packed and had a line out the door!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place in N Scottsdale. Great selection of options. The owner is very friendly & welcoming and really let's you try different options before you order. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp so we stopped by after dinner for some coffee. Well we walked in and saw the rows of gelato and couldn't resist! Got the stracciatella and creme brulee and both were yummy. Not cloyingly sweet and very smooth, it was delicious. Also got a cappuccino which was alright, but I'd like to try the cae mocha next time. We'll be back if we're every in the area!"}
{"text":"OH WOW!!! THIS IS THE REAL DEAL!  I was able to speak to the owners in my broken Italian-- it was awesome.   Then he had a SPECIAL gelato made for me... you ready for this?  Pepperoni Gelato--- ha!  He did it as a funny and it was really cute.  Anyhow, next time I am further up north, I am stopping by again!   DE-LISH!"}
{"text":"We all came in and tried different flavors. There are so many flavors to choose from I will have to come back for months to try. The gelato is creamy and the flavor is delicious. We all agreed that until we find someplace better, this will be our new favorite place to come for dessert. Once you try it, you won't forget."}
{"text":"This gelato shop does live up to its standards. They have a nice mural on the wall to represent America and Italy. Great selection of gelato. I had the dark chocolate sorbet and my girlfriend had the tiramisu. Both were really good. Nice area to be around as well."}
{"text":"I love walking into this place. Not only do they have an AMAZING dolce de leche gelato (my favorite) but the owners are hardcore Italians with a passion for their gelato. It's run and operated by two Italian brothers and their wives, and they always seem to appreciate my feeble attempts at conversing in Italian, haha! This is truly the hidden gem of all Arizona gelato, you can by far taste the difference from any other \"authentic gelato posers.\" This is worth the splurge for an after dinner treat...or before dinner ;-) Along with dolce de leche, the chocolate coconut and the spicy chocolate are ones to test out as well. You feel like every bite you take here is fresh like it's been made that morning.  The best part is even a small gives you enough to leave you satisfied. In order to be a true gelato connoisseur (as well as save a few calories) eat it slow...it's worth the time to savor at this place!"}
{"text":"The most fabulous gelato I've had - EVER! Such a darling couple who scratch makes everything they sell. There is a dizzying array of gelato flavors and sweet little pastries. We can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Every bit deserving of the solid 5 stars. Unbelievable variety of gelato with friendly service.  We tried the rum chocolate and whiskey cream. Both were outstanding! There is a flavor for everyone here. We look forward to many return visits."}
{"text":"This is my favorite gelato place ever!  The flavors are rich and so original.  I always sample a few and then end up with the same thing every time which is mango and toblerone. There's always a constant flow of customers, and I love the Italian feel.  Real gelato, real Italians, REAL good"}
{"text":"I come here frequently with a gentleman that I assist.  I have NEVER had a bad scoop of gelato - are there some flavors I like better than others - yes but across the board everything is top quality.  Owners and employees are helpful and friendly.  I didn't realize they had a loyalty card until much later (because I didn't pay attention to the sign) so if you visit often make sure to ask for one.   Best gelato in SDL !!"}
{"text":"Average quality gelato, and sometimes even artificial tasting or hypersweet. I recommend Paris Gourmet - a new place that also makes macarons. Less flavors though.  We come from the OC where they have Vitaly, the best gelato, so we know our cold desserts."}
{"text":"This place probably doesn't need my 5 star review as it has received multiple rewards and write-ups already detailing how great their gelato is and how sweet the owners are. So, let me just say that it really is wonderful, the biscotto is my favorite flavor, and having an espresso here always reminds me of being in Italy."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, That's Amore Gelato! I am in love. We stopped in today to get some dessert. My husband tried this pastry called sfogliatelle, which looked like a shell and had ricotta cheese inside. It was very dense but he loved the taste. It was really crunchy on the outside, but the filling was nice and soft. Not too sweet or creamy; just right. I had their tiramisu and it was really yummy; definitely tasted the rum. Also had a pint of gelato to go. It probably took us like 10 minutes to decide on the flavor as they have so many flavors to choose from. We were able to choose 3 flavors to fill our pint for around $10. They really pack it in to fill every space in the container though. Came home and tried the 3 flavors - vanilla, mint chocolate and mascarpone. It was so good, I wanted to throw away the Haagen Dazs ice cream in my freezer.  I can't wait to go back and try all the other flavors."}
{"text":"First time trying this place and it was great!! Unique flavors and friendly staff. Will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"It's stupid how good this gelato is.  The guy behind the counter recommended the black cherry as his favorite, which was spectacular.  Girlfriend loved the Creme Brûlée.  After reading a newspaper post on the wall here that the owners were all Italians, I had to try the espresso.  All delicious."}
{"text":"We are in love with the gelato at That's Amore! I had the chocolate and tartufo flavors; both delicious. Overall, we are happy to support a small business such as this one that has good food and great service :)"}
{"text":"Heaven! The Italian owners have a lot of heart & soul and it shows in there delicious gelato."}
{"text":"best gelato ever, hands down. i try new flavors every time and i love mixing different flavors and i've loved everything i've tried!! it's almost always super crowded but i've never had to wait long and they take care of everyone really quickly which is awesome! if you like gelato, definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Gelato Store in North Scottsdale serving Gelato and pastries including Canolis.  Tried the Pistachio and Strasitella, I believe she must of been one of the owners.  We came in on a warm 105 degree day after Golf Lessons at Troon North around 5 pm, so something cold seemed the appropriate thing.  The Pistachio was good and the Strasitella was good but did not seem quite as cold as expected.   The only other Gelato shop I have been to seemed to be what I am most used to and the comparison for this one did not live up to what I had have before."}
{"text":"Our new favorite gelato stop.  Many choices - hard to decide.  Pastries as well and it appears that they also make sandwiches.  We will certainly be back many times in the future."}
{"text":"I must concede, the gelato is really great. The black cherry is my favorite, it tastes just like the old frozen treats called \"screwball\" when I was a kid. However, the customer service is atrocious. WARNING: do not mix vanilla with more complicated flavors because you will get 95% vanilla and a little spoonful of something yummy. I have a whole nother issue with how they refused to give me a punch card when I deserved one for buying two meals separately... They only wanted to give me one. On top of this, I understand Italian and I overheard them speaking in a very derogatory manner towards two nice older ladies who were completely oblivious."}
