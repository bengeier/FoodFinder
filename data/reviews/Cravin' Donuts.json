{"text":"The best donuts in town. A lot of better than dutch donuts factory and open 24/7. Alway fresh and alway open"}
{"text":"Donuts are big, light, and fluffy. Very good! In comparison to Krispy Kreme they're bigger. If I had to choose between the other local donut shop Dutch Donuts I would choose Cravin' Donuts every time hands down. I have yet to try there boba or coffee. I believe I paid around $9 for a dozen and that included 2 of their specialty (fancy) donuts that cost a $1 more."}
{"text":"They're pretty good cleanliness is OK where can you eat too many donuts like I was when I was a teenager but good enough"}
{"text":"Same people that ran the Mesa and Main store.  Same issues here with 24hr stale donuts, overcharging.  Ask for a receipt and count your change.  Charged $10 per dozen, not list price, then shorted another dollar more on change back.  Apple fritters did not contain apples and had a bad consistency, like uncooked dough.  Had to throw those away.  Of the dozen, we ate parts of 7 of them.  Too many other places to bother stopping here again.  Wondering now why they can't can't use the bosa name."}
{"text":"Not open 24/7.... just wasted my time going there.  Please change this.  So other people don't waste their gas and time."}
{"text":"I really liked this place. Everything was so neat and clean and in order. The dining area is small and quiet. I got a boba drink and a few donuts. I like the glaze they use here as it's not too sugary. The donuts were fresh and tasty. The lady working was very polite and friendly. Will come again with my family."}
{"text":"This place gives Bosa a bad name. BEWARE: These guys have FAKE reviews on Yelp. Went through drive through... The donuts are stale and crumbly. The counter help person had a cold and she kept her used kleenex in her hand while handing me my debit card and a pile of napkins with the SAME HAND! WTF?!?! Appetite lost. Got my card back and drowned it in handisans. Wrote off the $5 spent and got the ___ outta there."}
{"text":"The folks who run this place seem nice....however, I was in line at SAMs Club and noticed that this is where they buy their bagels and ham.  Nothing against Sams Club.  It's just I might as well make my own bagel sandwiches at home.."}
{"text":"Rode my bike here for the first time, and I am very pleasantly surprised. It's a Sunday morning and they have a good selection of donuts and a couple croissants too. I had an Apple Fritter and a Maple Bar. Very good and fresh.  I like the cooler selection of drinks. I had a Vitaminwater. The lady that served me was very nice and pleasantly filled my water bottle with ice and water. I'll be returning here often."}
{"text":"The baker for this location quit a few months ago (August 15), the owner decided to bake the Donuts in his Tempe shop and drop some of the selection.  Well one of the Donuts dropped was the lightly fried,  Raspberry Jelly filled with a powdered sugar coating - my favorite kind.   That sucks!  They still have good service but the Donuts are not fresh and since they don't carry my Fav - I stopped going !!!
Now their just another Donut shop - Just OK!"}
{"text":"This place sucks.   Donuts are stale and overpriced.  Front counter person is rude,  and the prices seem to be a bit \"flexible\".  There is also fake reviews for them on Yelp.  

Count your change."}
{"text":"Husband and I had a NEED for donuts at 1 am due to family. This place is open 24/7! Guy working the drive through was friendly and quick to please. Donuts were tasty, light, & moist. We will DEFINITELY return!"}
{"text":"I have been to this place once since their Grand Opening and definitely plan to return! I know they are under the same chain as Bosa Doughnuts but imo these are better! The glazed donuts give Krispy Kreme a run for their money and their wide assortment of other types beats any doughnut shop that I can think of. Overall a great place, customer service is good, 4 stars is the magic number on this one!"}
{"text":"Bosa donuts you say.   Hmmm , this place place still leaves me Cravin for Bosa donuts."}
{"text":"These are the best donuts in the Valley.  We love donuts, and these truly are the best we've found since we've been in Arizona.  We enjoyed excellent customer service and thought the pricing was fair.  Haven't tried their coffee yet.  Perhaps next time we stop for donuts."}
{"text":"The donuts here are delicious! It's great that the shop is open 24 hours, because who knows when you're going to need that donut. Basically taste like Bosa. However, this morning was the first time that I visited the shop. I went there with a student coupon for six free donuts, and the cashier would not let me use it because the coupon was on my phone and not printed. Nowhere on the coupon or the ASU student insider website did specify that the coupon needed to be printed out. Personally, I don't see the difference, I guess it just makes them feel better to waste some paper."}
{"text":"Not open 24/7. Even though they keep the open sign lit all night. Workers ignored us at the drive thru at 11pm on a Saturday night. Who knows what their hours are."}
{"text":"When I first saw that a new kind of Bosa Donuts was opening up down the street from my house I was so excited! Unfortunately they never have donuts... How ridiculous is that? I have gone over 5 times and every single time they have been out of glazed donuts and basically everything else besides donut holes and this one last time that I went they literally had no donuts only beverages. I'm extremely disappointed because I want to support both because of how awesome the donuts are when they have them but I am just going to stop going all together because I am just wasting my time by trying to get donuts at the donut shop that doesn't have any."}
{"text":"Donuts are amazing! Don't even both with the drive thru, horrible service and slow. Go in to save time and for a better experience."}
{"text":"Wow!!  These donuts are phenomenally good!! Much better than Krispy Kreme or Dunkin!! Plus, this place is open 24/7  oh, and did I mention the coffee is great too!!"}
