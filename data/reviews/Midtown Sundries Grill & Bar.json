{"text":"It's been almost four years since my initial review so time to update...

I go to Midtown Sundries probably about twice per month. They are much more consistent with the food since last review I left. 

Things to know: 
- I highly recommend the barbalo wings. They are big wings so 10 should be plenty for most people. 
- They have some events during the week that bring in a large crowd. One of which is bingo. If you happen to be there on bingo night, then the service will be a little slower. 
- The service on a normal night is pretty good. Some servers are better than others but I would put them on par with or better than Hickory Tavern.
- Their portions are legit. They do not skimp on food.
- They have some good lunch specials and you can sign up to receive texts where they will offer discounts such as $2 off appetizers etc.

... Ultimately this place takes a lot of flack on Yelp but they are one of the better restaurants in the Indian Land area. Easy 4 stars from me."}
{"text":"Went tonight for the second time and we were seated immediately. After 20 minutes, my husband had to ask the hostess if we were going to get a waitress. One came over about five minutes later and offered to put in our entire order. (We hadn't got kid's menus when we sat down, so we weren't ready to order).  we eventually got out of there after two hours.The food, when it eventually arrived was OK, but the service was AWFUL to the point where it was embarrassing. It's five minutes from the house, but NOT worth the drive."}
{"text":"Just tried to visit this location but was completely ignored. No hostess. Waited a few minutes for one but none showed. No sign saying to seat myself. Made direct eye contact with bartender who did not acknowledge my presence. A we'll be with you in a minute or just grab a seat & someone will take care of you would have been sufficient. I guess some parts of the south are still segregated. Didn't see any blacks & I guess they didn't want to have any today. Don't go here unless you like being ignored. Going to Denver location where I know I'm welcomed."}
{"text":"Food was okay.   Service poor.   And they weren't busy!!!!   Server forgot us on the front end AND again after she brought our check. Since we hadn't gotten any refills, we asked for a drink to go.  The cups had soda all over the sides!!   Just sloppy service. Too much competition in the area for me to go back."}
{"text":"Good food. Went with the family on a Friday before Christmas. The kids enjoyed the food. I had the Cajun battered fish sandwich. Loved the sandwich. They had multiple choices for the batter. The Cajun flavor sounded good to me. 
My wife had the fish tacos. They were just o.k. The batter on the fish was so-so. I would have preferred cabbage instead of romaine lettuce and a sauce with some spicy flavor. We also ordered so black beans and rice as a side. The flavor was just again o.k. The service was o.k. and they were able to make suggestions about popular dishes. 
All in all it was a good first experience and will return to try other dishes."}
{"text":"I honestly don't even know where to begin with this place. 

First I will say I ordered a Guinness but it tasted a little flat. Can't tell if there was an issue with the tap or just the keg had been out for too long. 

I ordered the Wednesday fried chicken special with macaroni and cheese, when I notified the waitress that the macaroni and cheese was cold she said she would \"reheat it\".  And then immediately changed to get me a new serving but it was obviously the same one from where you could see where I had already eaten from it. I was also charged $12 when it is supposed to be the $8.50 special. 

Honestly I wouldn't recommend and will never go back. I thought nothing could be worse than the Cleveland browns. Boy I was wrong."}
{"text":"The food, is very, very good. (their mac & cheese with their brunswick stew, is a great combination) but their staff leaves something to be desired. I quit going in and just started to order my food to go."}
{"text":"The food here is outstanding but the service is pretty slow.  Chicken tenders are amazing, salads are good sized and the menu variety is really nice.  Ambiance is a lot odd as they took over from an Italian restaurant and didn't change the interior at all but added a lot of TV's.  FOOD 5 stars.  SERVICE 2  PRICE 4"}
{"text":"Bingo night!!??? Ok?! Waitress seemed confused/distracted. Kinda all over the place. Her service was spotty. She said something about a big table, but there were at least 2 or 3 other servers and it wasn't that crowded.
We had Bee Sting wings. Ordered 20 and wanted half bee sting, half Buffalo. They said they couldn't split the order unless we ordered 50! Something about the \"tickets\" in the kitchen. We could order 2x10 if we wanted! Of course that costs more! The wings were meaty, but definitely not \"extra crispy\" as ordered. The sauce had little flavor and no heat. Wouldn't order them again.
The Black and Blue burger was ok. Not a bad size and ok flavor. Based  on the alone I would have given maybe 3 1/2 stars. Sweet potato fries had no flavor. 
Overall, disappointing. My son took his brother and I to celebrate and the company was good. Unfortunately, the food and service were not!"}
{"text":"Good food and great service. Juke box is great at night and the staff is the best part of Midtown!"}
{"text":"2 fried chicken breasts for 12 bucks....seems , well crazy....  so, after seeing the board i left the thought behind....  wondering is the chicken that good..  would like to stop in while heading down south next time."}
{"text":"I am really disappointed in this eatery. The first time I went the service(at the bar) was really good.Food was just ok but still good enough for return visits. Have been there several times before this visit and food was still good. Service at bar is a little lacking.
My last three times here there has been a small crowd at the end of bar near kitchen and the server seemed more interested in talking to them than she was in attending other patrons. The last time there not only was the \"in crowd\" loud but she spent more time with them and on her phone.
Obviously this place wants to be a bar and cares not about those people who just want to eat.( having said that I am referring to bar personnel only cause haven't sat in the restaurant portion)  I have nothing against a bar but if other people eating at bar are ignored then owner/ manager need to step up.
Story to say but this was my last visit and I will tell neighbors of my experience."}
{"text":"I was a huge fan of Midtown Sundries in Pineville before it closed a few years ago so I was thrilled when this one opened nearby.  The menu isn't identical to the one they used to have, but they definitely kept some fan favorites.  When it was in Pineville I was ADDICTED to the Big Island Salad, and I'm super happy they kept that one on the menu.  We've been 6 times in the 2 months that it's been open and our experience has been great each time from a food and service perspective.

This Midtown is located where Carolina Bistro used to be, and my understanding is that this location has a pretty loyal following.  Live music on Tuesdays, Bingo on Wednesdays and Karaoke on Thursdays.  I'm not sure about Fri or Sat because we avoid it at all costs.  I just don't think the restaurant has good acoustics because when there are people at the bar or anything else going on (karaoke, bingo, etc), it's just too loud.  I mean, so loud you can't hear yourself think.  We've been on a Wednesday, Thursday and Sunday, and luckily the Wednesday we went Bingo was cancelled.  On the Thursday night we were sat near the bar which was just crazy loud due to 3 obnoxious patrons, and we managed to leave just as karaoke was getting fired up.  All Sunday experiences have been fantastic. ;-)

Overall, I love the food and the service has been great (btw - EVERYTHING is better with their blue cheese - best in CLT).  But I'd recommend going for lunch or avoiding their nightly activities if you're looking for a family atmosphere or any conversation."}
{"text":"We came here on a Sunday afternoon expecting a quiet and delicious lunch. Not the case. First off, there is a crowd of regulars (with their toddler) that stay at the bar but take over the entire restaurant with a loud jukebox, rambunctious toddler, and rowdy adults. The food was less than desirable. The medium burger was dry and overcooked, as was the salmon. Suggestion to management: find a way to balance your food customers and bar customers and keep quality control on food."}
{"text":"Not really much to see here folks! The service is mediocre, the food isn't much better and management is lax. Been here a couple of time and decided to give them another try but it was the same experience but wait staff was a tad bit better. You can skip Midtown Sundries and that's keeping it real."}
{"text":"I have never given a bad review on here, even when a restaurant has been less than 5 star but there is a first time for everything. I was actually a little excited to find out this restaurant had opened near me because we have had them here before and they were great. This Midtown Sundries was a huge disappointment. The service was slow, the music was so loud we could barely hear ourselves think and the food was absolutely awful. I ordered chicken fingers with their barbalo sauce and they were swimming in the tasteless sauce. Nothing like the sauce of the same name from the previous places. My sons both ordered chicken fingers as well but one of them ordered Cajun. When they arrived the waitress couldn't tell the difference which create an issue with my son who can't tolerate any amount of spicy in his food. And one order had 8 large tenders and the other has 4-5 little ones.  
Basically, it was all the way around a disappointment and we won't be going back."}
{"text":"Our book club decided to have our annual book selection meeting at Midtown Sundries.  My original opinion and earlier review was negative.  Lo and behold, our luncheon meeting changed my mind because of my positive experience.

We were given a closed meeting room off of the main area and it was perfect.  Our wait person was Cheryl W. who did an outstanding job.  We are a all female group with just two men, so exceptions and substitutions were plentiful.  Cheryl took it in stride and got the myriad meals out nearly all together and continually was topping off beverages and making sure our fussy bunch was happy.  We were.

The menu seemed to now offer a number of things that we liked.  I had a shrimp basket which was excellent and plentiful.  Wife had the soup and salad, also an excellent choice.  Iced tea for us both.

The service is great, the menu satisfactory, food is just fine and the variety of options, as well as a full bar, was super.  Now Midtown Sundries in my opinion is A-OK and we will pop back in for a lunch or dinner.  Bring your groups as they can handle a bunch of people."}
{"text":"I just found Midtown Sundries! My father used to go to the one near Uptown. The best part is that it's the same owners...I loved the food, service was very personalized and they had a good choice of drafts. I happened to be there Saturday Night and they had a REAL band with talented musicians who sounded just like Billy Joel. The best part is the tickets were FREE. I'm looking forward to returning and eating the Ribs again along with the Fried Pickles! They were delicious!"}
{"text":"I feel the need to update this.  So again I tried this place.  I'm an so over done with them.  I get an hour for lunch, I am hourly so I of course am on a clock in and out for lunch.  1 hour.  45 minutes later when I need to leave to go back to after I had to ask for our server, oh her she comes with our food.  Only ordered a burger.    I'm sorry, but it should not take 45 minutes to cook a burger when there is less than 10 people in the place.  It was dead!  
  Apparently it is hot or miss and I dont have time for it.
  We need new, more restaurants in Indian land.  
  I can promise you, I won't be back."}
{"text":"We had a really great experience here tonight. The wait staff was very attentive and friendly. The food was cooked perfectly and everyone enjoyed their meal. With all the new restaurants coming to the area, I was happy to see them doing so well! Support local businesses!"}
{"text":"My best friend and I took our boys out for a quick dinner last night.  We choose Midtown as it's close and we always have had a pleasant experience until tonight.  We ordered the norm, 20 wings and midtown chips to share.  Her son ordered a kids cheeseburger.  We attempted to order 10 of our wings one flavor and the other 10 a different flavor.  We were abruptly told they do not accept more than one flavor choice on the wings and this would be the last time they would honor our request.  This was odd as we have been coming to Midtown regularly and never had an issue.  We could have totally understood if busy but there was only 6 other tables in the entire place.   We then proceed to get our uno cards out and play a few rounds while waiting on our food with the boys.   The wings come out along with the chips.  We assumed the burger would be right behind.  The food was subpar.  Midtown chips where stale and cold.  After 10 min we asked about the burger.  The manager stated yet again abruptly it was burnt and they were making another one.  Finally the burger does come out and her son takes one bite and spits it out.  It smells terrible and had a \"rotten meat\" taste.   We immediately ask for boxes and just want to go home at this point.  We are upset, the boys are still hungry,  and the management basically ignored our entire situation.  The hostess was great though.  She went to talk to management that was sitting at the bar on our behalf as she agreed it didn't feel right to pay the bill.  The management stated they had done all they could do.   This upset me as they didn't do anything.  Little communication, and what was stated was done in a short and unfriendly manner.  I went to express my concerns to the management sitting at the bar and was then told by the gentleman sitting next to her \"take your fat ass out of here\" and he got up and walked to the bathroom.   I was shocked and hurt.  Never in my life have I been talked to that way in a Public establishment.  Needless to say it's not a wonder this place is always empty and if that's they type of people the management accepts in their restaurant and allows to talk to their customers in that manner we have no desire to return.  It's disappointing as our kids loved going for bingo night and up until tonight have always had a nice time.  However after being disrespected in front of my child and leaving in tears I'll never step foot in Midtown again."}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place  as I heard mixed reviews. 
As we entered we  were greeted by a friendly host, likewise seated by a friendly hostess. 
Typical bar-and-grill atmosphere; the place could use some sprucing up but it was clean .
A friendly waiter took our orders  and explained any questions we had about the menu 
By the way the staff we encountered were probably summer help,  young people who were eager and friendly and accommodating at the time of our visit. 

The menu features : appetizers , pizza wings , soups and salads , entrees  to include steak,  ribs ,chicken , salmon,
 of course burgers,  fried foods baskets, sandwiches , and a bunch of different sides such as French fries  onion  rings, mac and cheese , slaw etc. Also a few desserts such as cheesecake ,cobbler and hot fudge sundaes,
 Daily specials too.

I ordered the Midtown Burger which was topped  with chili , coleslaw,  chopped onions and mustard plus a side of sweet potato fries .
My  dining mate  ordered a Thai chicken wrap which  held hot diced chicken  with a Thai peanut sauce and veges ,plus an order of fries .
Portion size was good, food came out hot. My Burger was cooked to order as I specified.
 Both entrees were delicious .
Prices were  moderate .
We had a good experience and would return.
No photos, at this time, but will take some at our next update"}
{"text":"I remember eating at one I want to say near the university area when I first moved to town. So we decided to try this location out. The food was so so at best but the kicker was the beer wasn't that cold at all. You have to have beer cold come on people you sorta a bar."}
{"text":"Great food, great prices ,great atmosphere and the servers were very friendly and quick. The soups are outstanding. My favorite is the turkey sandwich and try the cobbler it is the best"}
{"text":"Being a Charlotte native and living around Carmel Commons for over 10 years I was bummed when Midtown 51 closed down due to serving some under aged guests.  Me and my honey went today for lunch and I got their cajun wings with bleu cheese dressing and they were every bit as good as they've ever been at any of their previous locations.  We will be back soon!!"}
{"text":"Was here in March and had a bad experience but decided to give them another chance. The problems are the same. We had a large group and had the same waitress. Food came out slow, over 30 minutes from the first meal to the last person was served. They obviously cant handle groups of 14-15. The waitress still puts her finger inside the glass when she pick it up to refill. There is no training for staff. After meal it took forever to get our checks. Everyone in our group was unhappy with the service. Our server was Courtney. We will not be going back!
I hope the owner will read these comments and take some action and give these employees some basic training on food service."}
{"text":"This is a good neighborhood joint. Tasty burgers and wings. Awesome drinks. Ok it's a bit outdated but so what. Friendly and attentive staff. Consistent."}
{"text":"We have visited other locations and thought it would be a good spot for a Saturday early dinner. 

The \"feel\" at this location was much older, more \"seasoned\". Perhaps the location near Sun City retirement village played a role, I don't know. 

It took the hostess a minute to greet us, as she was seated comfortably and engaged with customers at the bar! 

Our server introduced himself and then disappeared for quite awhile. He took our orders (everyone had tenders/Wings) and it took FOREVER for our food to arrive and the restaurant was not busy at all. Their saving grace was that another nicer hostess came around and engaged our son to lighten the mood. 

The food was hot which we appreciated. Fries were hard and salty, but we made do. 

Probably would only consider take out wings, if that, if we were to go back. Just disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been to this place on 3 different occasions over several years.  Only the first time would I say I was fairly pleased with the overall experience.  That time I had a dynamite steak that was worth coming back for.  But the live music was loud and I could barely hear my dining companion.  The next time we came during a snow/sleet storm and apparently the locals were celebrating.  The karaoke was in force despite no karaoke machine present.  Too bad the drunks have free reign and permission to be as obnoxious and loud as imaginable.  The waitress tried hard and our food was pretty good but the atmosphere was lousy.  This last time, and it may be the last, the drunks were enjoying a ballgame without regard to others dining, even some with children.  The F bombs dropping all over, and again, management seems not to give a rip about other customers, just the \"regulars\".  The food was just ok and for the price with the recent hike, not worth dealing with the regulars and laissez faire attitudes.  Too bad because we don't have a lot of restaurants but that will soon change.  My advice:  go somewhere else so that you can dine and enjoy pleasant conversation."}
