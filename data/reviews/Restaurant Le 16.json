{"text":"Officially the best \"non-french fry\" restaurant in Lachute in my book! 
We stopped by for a quick dinner after \"meet the teacher\" night. 
We started with a green salad that had an amazing homemade dressing! Then, we both ordered the bavette de boeuf that was cooked to our specifications and served with a veggie medley \"al dente\". I hate it when the veggies are mushy!

The only suggestion would be to add more California wines to go with the great food. 

There were so many things I wanted to try on the menu... I can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"La nourriture est bonne et les assiettes sont bien présentés. Le personnel est très gentil et la place est tranquille, relax."}
{"text":"Good food but way too overpriced. The staff was really slow the night we were there. Take this review with a grain of salt since i haven't beem back in 2 years, so things may have changed."}
