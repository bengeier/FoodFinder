{"text":"Came here on a Thursday night to purchase some fresh pan de sal and some ensaymada not having any expectations as this was going to be my first time. After going home, sitting down and enjoying their food items....Honestly, their pan de sal is probably the best in town, and definitely beats the store bought versions you see wrapped in the plastic bags. They make theirs fresh and you can tell with the difference in taste and crunchiness after leaving it in the oven for breakfast, merienda or lunch. The ensaymada I bought had ube incorporated into the mix and was well adorned with butter and sugar. Other places I've been to are kind of stingy with their helpings, especially with the cheese shavings - however this one was slathered!  After trying the ensaymada today, I am definitely a BIG fan of this place and really wished there were other locations in Toronto, closer to where I live, but for the taste and quality - I wouldn't mind driving down here just to pick up their products because I can see that they really know how to cater to their customers in diverse methods. For example, other places don't make ensaymada as rich as theirs with ube incorporated (most of the time they're plain with just the cheese and butter/sugar); and their pan de sal isn't as plump, nor as fresh (smaller rectangles with a yellow tint in colour - similar to egg bread).  Among these items, I also happened to purchase some Marisco Spanish-style sardines! These are a product of the Philippines and although they are $4.99/jar, they are AMAZING in taste! I picked up the \"hot in corn oil\" version and they had the right amount of kick, and went wonderfully with the oven-heated pan de sal. The sweetness of the bread off-set the spiciness of the sardines so it made for a complementary pairing. I actually can't find this brand in some of the other Filipino stores I attend nearby so this is a sure sign they will be having me as a long time customer.  I would DEFINITELY recommend this location and suggest you try the ensaymada with ube - you might not even need to slap on some butter/margarine because it's so moist. Aside my own testimony, I know a few others who thoroughly enjoy this branch and say that this is their most favourite Filipino bakery in Toronto! Soo I guess there is a reason why they're so easy to call themselves, (shall I say) 'Da Best' ? (har har, me so witty lol)"}
{"text":"Great pandesal! Such a nice texture with the crust and the soft airyness in the middle. It had a slight aftertaste that I couldn't put my finger on, but it wasn't dissatisfying. Their cheese bread and Spanish bread are awesome as well. Don't sleep on the small space, Little Manila. So good!"}
{"text":"Got some really delicious freshly baked buns from here. The bread had a mild sweetness to it, was really soft and fluffy inside and crispy on the outside!!  The storefront is a little messy and isn't the cleanest. A little freshening up might do it some good.  The staff was really helpful and really nice."}
