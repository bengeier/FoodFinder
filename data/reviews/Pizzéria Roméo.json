{"text":"This was a joke!! One of the nights when you regret the money you spent on food.
In general they do not know how to make italian pizza in Canada but this was the worst by far!!!

100% taste like defrosted pizza with toppings. (Im almost sure they use defrosted dough). NEVER again! 

Service and interior was ok."}
{"text":"Wondered in here after the pizza place we had planned on going to was closed for boxer day.

Vibe was cool but we felt a little under dressed, some how everyone else looked cool even though it was 14° F and we looked like fur trappers.

Food was really excellent. The sauce was tasty as was the cheese. The portions were just right.

Service was excellent!"}
{"text":"We made a res 3 weeks in advance for a group of 6 and when we arrived we were told our table wasn't available because we \"changed it too many times.\" It was changed ONCE on the day it was made.. needless to say we didn't eat there. Don't give someone a reservation if you don't have available tables."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza for delivery ... so I can't comment on the place or the service, however, the pizza was only ok not good. The toppings were fine but the crust was not very good at all. Sorry to say, not worth the price."}
{"text":"The best pizza I've ever tried in my life!!!! After you have a few bites, you don't wanna stop it, you just feel like to keep eating. I would love to go back again :D!!"}
{"text":"blt pizza (basically a caesar salad on top of a cheese pizza) is pretty darn good and the vibe is really nice, but I find the taste quality inconsistent.  On our last visit the meatballs were overcooked and tough to cut through.  

Apparently after 10pm they have $10 pizzas.  Not huge in size, but filling."}
{"text":"Je travaille en restauration et il est souvent difficile de trouver un endroit où aller manger lorsque je finis tard. Heureusement, depuis que j'ai mon blog (la boufferie), je fais énormément de recherches et je suis tombée sur la pizzeria roméo qui offre des pizzas à seulement 10$ après 22h. Et des bonnes pizzas!!!! 
Leurs cocktails aussi sont plutôt divertissants: des classiques revisités avec humour!
J'ai bien aimé. Parfait pour une bouffe de fin de soirée, un souper entre amis ou même un souper en amoureux décontracté."}
{"text":"Its the little Brother of the Resto Misto on mont royal St

Its again some italian food with a fancy flair
The service and food is Not bad but nothing exceptionnal compared to the Misto

The drinks are good tho
A cool place with friends, they are also hockey friendly with Tv screen for games"}
{"text":"Because of it's location close to my apartment, Pizzeria Romeo is the Montreal pizza spot that I've been too the most.  It's well located on Mont Royal close to many great water holes on the Plateau.

Place: Pizzeria Romeo has a sleek, open layout perfect with plenty of tables to accommodate couples or larger parties.  It's first floor location and large street facing windows ,which open during the summer, make for great people watching and a fun spot to grab a summer drink.  In the evenings, it has darker, refined atmosphere that isn't too dressy but a definite step up from a casual pizza spot.  

Food:  An appetizer of bread and a flavorful tomato spread are generally brought out before the meal.  My wife and I generally split one of the varieties of pizza and order a salad to share as well.  The crust of most pizza in Montreal is for a lack of a better description, medium in thickness.  The meats and vegetables used by the cooks are fresh and delicious.  Even though the pizza is tasty, I find myself wishing the pizza was more like Chicago-style deep dish or thinner NY-style.  A bit of nostalgia that my tastebuds just can't seem to get over and that's why it's 3 stars instead of 4.  

Pizzeria Romeo also serves chicken, fish, lasagna and some other non-pizza entries.  But I have never tried them.

They also offer some excellent cocktails, a variety of beers and a decent wine list.

Service:  On our visits, we've found the waitstaff to be attentive and well-informed about the menu.  One minor gripe is that even though you order at the table, you must get up to pay at the central register. (Not sure why they can't take your cash or card at the table?)

Price:  ~$50 for a pizza, salad and two drinks.  The pizza, salad and drinks are all good and it is a very pleasant spot to spend an evening.


Tip:  Pizzas are $10 after 10pm if you can wait that long to eat dinner.

Is it the best pizza ever?  No.  But if you're looking for a more upscale spot to take a date or the wife out for decent meal, I think they will enjoy Pizzeria Romeo."}
{"text":"Staff and service is great, wine is on point and food is delicious. I love their pizza."}
{"text":"Super ambiance.
Service correct, sans plus.
Nourriture un peu décevante.

Voilà les quelques points qui caractérisent ma soirée au Roméo. Mes amies et moi avions une grande banquette pour nous toutes seules dans le coin le plus tranquille du resto, près de la fenêtre. Bien souvent, je suis insatisfaite de la place qu'on m'assigne, mais au Roméo, c'était parfait. La musique n'était pas trop forte et le répertoire était assez varié, de quoi plaire à tous. Par contre, c'était une soirée assez tranquille (un mercredi)... Je crains donc que ce soit assez différent un vendredi ou un samedi soir. Le service était assez froid et un peu maladroit au début, mais s'est légèrement amélioré au cours de la soirée.

Côté nourriture, c'était ordinaire. Je fais de la pizza tellement meilleure chez moi! Toutes les assiettes avaient l'air appétissantes, mais bon. Quand le goût n'y est pas vraiment...

J'y retournerai possiblement avec des ami(e)s en soirée pour relaxer et goûter à d'autres plats. On verra bien!"}
{"text":"Terrible pizza... So so awful!!!! The pizza had way too much cheese, was too oily, the dough was terrible, and the toppings were so few. I've definitely had better and cheaper pizza. $18 for a terrible pizza is ridiculous. The waitress had serious attitude and wasn't great. She was drinking on the job (we saw her taking shots several times). Will never go again."}
{"text":"J'y suis allée à quelques reprises et je réalise que je n'avais pas encore \"yelpé\" sur le sujet. J'adore cet endroit. Hier, j'ai pris une pizza aux figues et quelques verres de vin. Les portions sont énormes et peu coûteuses. J'ai adoré ma pizza. Le vin n'est pas trop cher.  Le service est impeccable. À deux, vins, taxes et pourboires, 137$"}
{"text":"Had two slices of pizza. Not very flavorful but not very expensive either. There is definitely better pizza in the city but this will do if it's on your way."}
{"text":"Pizza et plats diversifiés et très goûteux, chaque fois que j'y suis allée je n'ai pas été déçue et pour le prix, ça vaut le détour! Leur risotto est vraiment bon!"}
{"text":"Ducked into this place while looking for a place with vegetarian food.  It's pizza with a little bit of a local twist. People ate with fork and  knives and I didn't  see any tourists around. The beer on tap was a local variety I'd never heard of before --it was passable.  

Overall food wasn't bad. But if you are looking for something that a vegetarian can eat on Mont-Royal then this is an acceptable option."}
{"text":"Le dimanche, les pizzas classiques sont à 10$ ! Et elles sont boooonnes !!! Je recommande aussi vivement la gaspacho (un délice !) et la tarte à la tomates (avec ses oignons caramélisés... mmm)."}
{"text":"Loud, one has to SCREAM to converse, I can't understand the need for loud,pounding music. Perhaps it's because there's a very busy bar on the premises, that's why. There was a group of us that evening, and it was decided there'd be a bottle of wine for the 5 who wanted wine wirh their pizza. I ordered a vegetarian as did several others, meanwhile we were served complimentary tomato paté & bread, which was gobbled down quickly by all; we were famished and it was getting late. My veggie pizza was good, piping hot, thin crust. Others who ordered the same liked theirs,as well as those who had whatever variety they'd ordered. Pizzas are only $10.00 per, for ANY variety from 10PM btw, overall my pizza & 1 glass of wine w/tip was $25.00, a bit  too steep, but next time I'll just forego the wine tyvm. Service was good and attentive, ambiance LOUD. If you want to watch your spending, wait till 10 PM and forget the wine."}
{"text":"This place is part of my 'Top ten food places in Montreal' list. 
I love the ambience and vibe of the place!! The indoor and outdoor seating is an added plus. 
Service is always excellent and welcoming. 
We have tried several types of Pizza from the menu and each one has been excellent. The taste and quality of the food is always consistent and upto the mark!!"}
{"text":"Nothing to rise home about.Food was okay. Service not great. The waiter was borderline rude!. My pizza was burnt. 
I think they are best to stick to serving beers and call it a day."}
{"text":"On a summer Monday in Montreal when most restos are closed and are only a few restaurants open, we decided to try this place located in le plateau. We had a caprese salad and the truffle pizza. Nothing special but it did the job."}
{"text":"This restaurant looks like a happening place, though I'm not sure why. When we arrived, it took nearly 5 minutes for any staff to acknowledge us. When I asked where the restrooms were, One of the staff members breezed by pointing over her shoulder. We were finally seated and had to wait 5 minutes to ask for our menus.  10 minutes later we had to flag a staff member to take our drink and food order. I ordered a Coke and was given Pepsi, but worse than that, it tasted like syrup, so I had to send it back.  It took about 25 minutes to get our food. I will say that the food was tasty...great boccinci salad...and decent Pizza too. The waitress Karinne saw that we had been done our meals and we're waiting for our bill, but she proceeded to ignore us, putting away the menus. When she finally came to give our bills so that we could pay, we were not impressed with the service at all. Our guests were international travelers so we paid separately with credit card, and wanted to leave tips with our spare Canadian money. Karinne(the waitress) had the audacity to tell us that \"usually a tip isn't added to the bill and that next time we should remember that\". Never....has any waitstaff, at any restaurant I've been to ever made such a comment. My general rule of thumb is to tip between 15 -20%, but in this circumstance, with Karinne's comment, terrible service and attitude from the staff, I couldn't even justify one. Really unfortunate given the nice look and feel of the restaurant, and the quality of food."}
{"text":"Terrific service last night at my favorite casual spot on Le Plateau-Mont-Royal Montréal. My third visit with terrific attention to detail. This is the place you want to spend the evening - prepare to invest a couple hours with your date or friends and wind through starters, mains, and desert! We were impressed with our waiter as well as the presentation. 

The appetizer \"La Tarte Aux Tomates\" It was so well presented that we took a photo. We loved the perfect puff pastry, mascarpone, onion confit, and mozzarella was terrific and it paired well with our white wine. Our wine was delightful and fun! If you want a bottle of white thats crisp, enjoyed young with elegant depth; go for the Malvasia. I'm not a fan of tomato sauce, but Roméo pulls it off with authentic richness. I know this because I had a slice of my dinner date's Calabrese and was stunned. If you love well done crusts and lighter flavors - go for the La Flamande. I was very impressed and will order again! The cream sauce was rich, yet lovely. Perfect pancetta, fresh leeks, with flavorful mozzarella and parmesan: you won't be disappointed. 

Oh and don't worry at all about your French, they give fabulous service in French, English, Yum, and Mouthfull's of food!

{"text":"Visiting from California solo this place looked cute so I gave it a try. 
Best shrimp I've had in a really, really long time. The service was incredible. From the second I walked in they were really polite, sweet and knowledgable of the menu. I don't speak French and they explained everything to me. The bartender was so much fun as well! Lovely little place:) 
Try the spicy shrimp!!!"}
{"text":"Positive points: amazing service (truly very nice waiter), flexible hours (we went there past 10pm), and very fresh food. We had 2 pizzas one 4 cheese and the other one with fresh buffala and both really enjoyed our dishes. Service was fast which we appreciated. 
Not so positive: while it said buffala it definitely wasn't the real one, it was fresh mozzarella. It was still good but not what was advertised on the menu (and it wasn't worth the price difference with the other pizzas). Price wise it's a bit high compared to other very good Italian places. 

I'd recommend this place for a late dinner, and for the service."}
{"text":"Travaillant tard, je me retrouve souvent à ce resto passé 22h avec des amis ou mon copain. Le service est toujours agréable et juste assez présent (je déteste me faire demander à plusieurs reprises si tout est à mon goût) et les pizza répondent très bien aux désirs de mon estomac."}
{"text":"This is a long overdue review. I tried this place for the first time and was very pleased with my experience. The appetizer (eggplant based) and the pizza we ordered were so delicious that I still crave it. The service was excellent and even though my French is very rusty, the waitress was absolutely polite and eager to help out when we were deciding what to pick from the menu. The wine was possibly the best I've had in Montreal. Unfortunately, I can't remember what I had, but I'm pretty sure all of their wines are just as good. The small restaurant was full of good looking people and the atmosphere was just perfect for a cold evening."}
{"text":"This place is literally few steps away from my apartment so I had to check it out for myself. I know it gets very popular with couples, so popular in fact that I call it \"the date place\". It's also a great place for dinner with friends, family and kids. 

So the service is great and I mean it, both times I was there the service was top 5 stars. The ambiance is great too, whether you are seated inside or outside on their lovely terrace. 

The food? Since I'm not a big fan of pizza, I decided to order something completely different. First time I had the fish and it was perfectly cooked, just as it should be. On my second time I decided to try their lamb and I was pleasantly surprised, even impressed with how good it tasted and how pretty it looked on my plate. I think it was served on mash potato, but it tasted completely different, delicious.

So my verdict? I like it! It's definitely a cool spot to bring your friend, colleague, significant other. I can't say much about their pizzas since I haven't tasted it, but there are definitely few good things on their menu for those people like myself that not that into pizza. So yes, I recommend it."}
{"text":"Amazing Pizza!!! if you are in Montreal and looking for some delicious pizza and drinks you need to try this place!!!"}
{"text":"We came to Romeo on our first night in Montreal, as we got in late and made a mad dash for the SAQ. On our way we had seen Romeo and thought it was cute, so we decided we'd check it out on our way back. The cocktails sounded delicious, as did the pizza.

The three of us decided to split 2 pizzas: l'estivale and la figue bleu. They were amazing. We hadn't realized how hungry we were until we were devouring those pizzas. We entirely forgot about the hot pepper oil for the crust (which is a shame!).

We also ordered some cocktails: a spritzer and some sangria. Both were quite good, and the lychee was a nice touch to the sangria. Though, despite the menu saying that you could order sangria with red or white wine, they apparently only had red... I had a bit of a hiccup with my order of it, but in the end, it all turned out fine (aka I got a glass of sangria and it was tasty)."}
{"text":"La bouffe correct mais sans plus mais le sercice CATASTROPHIQUE. 
Zéro sourire, on passe la commande des entrées, le serveur reprend le menu sans demandé s il y aura un plat de résistance.
1 heure a recevoir l entrée et on nous demande même pas si on prend autre chose derrière.
Pour résumé : du temps de perdu et um moment peu agréable"}
