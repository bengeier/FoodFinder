{"text":"This is a hidden gem! The best fish and shrimp around, period! The customer service and food was over the great."}
{"text":"Best fish in the Concord-Kannapolis area. Great little quick stop where people have signed the walls. So bring your sharpie. Their fish choices are flounder, white fish, catfish (batter dipped) croaker tilapia and shrimp. They have hot dogs and other servings, but I come for the fish! I've not had a bad meal yet."}
{"text":"Food was good!! I ordered a catfish sandwich and four wings!! The meats were seasoned well and flavorful. The only reason i didnt give it five stars was due to the price of the wings. Three wings with no sides was $4.99!! That was high considering the wings were very very small... unlike the pic currently showed by another person."}
{"text":"This was awesome the wings and fish were awesome!   If you are shopping in Concord try this place!   My husband and boys loved the food and the staff was very nice.  Warning though it closes at 8pm and you can order 15 minutes before."}
{"text":"I visited this place today after a friend recommended and I was pleasantly surprised.  I got the shrimp dinner that came with 2 sides and hush puppies and it was delicious.  I got cole slaw and Okra and it was very good.  The young lady who took my order was very nice and took the time to go over the menu with me since I told her this was my first time.  My only very minor complaint would be that everything was fried just a bit too much, but that certainly didn't stop me from cleaning my plate.  I've heard the burgers are good, so I look forward to trying that next time."}
{"text":"i use to go to this place almost everyday but the man that works behind the counter is very rude and sneaky. so i stopped going. but the food is good. the philly isnt all that. but the fish is the best thing on the menu"}
{"text":"The word had gotten to me about this tucked away little spot off Davidson Highway that serves some superb fish which caused me to seek them out. I must admit I was not disappointed at this discovery. Fishing Fixins is a fabulous little go to spot four more fish and Fixins in your greedy ass can handle. I had an order of fried whiting, fried okra and potato salad. All of this was prepared with a at-home down-home, down home perfection. Two plate length pieces of Whiting a healthy cup of potato salad and fried okra fried to Perfection and melt-in-your-mouth good. My partner-in-crime had fried croaker, fried okra, and baked beans, to which I tried the baked beans and they would exquisite.   I was thoroughly tempted to try their homemade cake today sitting there as coconut cake is one of my favorites and I was told that it was scratch made which made it even more difficult to resist.  Perhaps on my next trip, the coconut cake I start with."}
{"text":"I love flounder and croaker but I primarily come here for croaker because it's fresh,  not frozen and you can taste the difference. I normally get it with fries, hush puppies and cole slaw. The sides are pretty good. The fish is well seasoned. You get two pieces along with two sides of your choice and hush puppies. This has become my go to spot when I don't feel like trekking to the fish market to buy fish and cook it myself."}
{"text":"When I tell you. These wings I bought here taste like heaven.. 4 wings for $4.99, price was reasonable. The wings taste like they were breaded 5 times and marinated in buttermilk for a week lol. Na but forreal they were really good. A bit salty but thats expected from a country food spot.. Good little spot!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Tamiko the owner is awesome too. You gotta come check this place out. The food is amazing! Not just seafood,  and not everything is fried either. Chicken,  burgers,  hot dogs,  tilapia, croaker,  and more! I've had almost everything on the menu, and the desserts?!? Omg...homemade red velvet cake,  pound cake,  and even banana pudding! My mouth is watering just talking about it!!!"}
{"text":"This place is technically closed and reopen under a new owner with a slightly different name (Divine Fish & Fixins). The menu is still mostly the same, but this is important to note if you have a coupon for the previous Fish & Fixins as they will NOT honour them.  That said, the food here is absolutely \"divine\" and portion sizes are ample for the price!   I had the shrimp and flounder combo plate with mac & cheese and fried okra for the sides. Normally I like ketchup to go with my fried fish, but neither the fish nor shrimp here needed any condiments on the side. Crisp, flavourful, and delicious just as they were served. Also the breading on the fish was not very heavy (as opposed to Calabash style fried fish) which was much appreciated. The fried okra was standard fare, but the mac & cheese was some of the best that I have ever tasted (though it is a $1 upcharge).  My mother had the flounder plate with cole slaw and potato salad (mustard based but delicious) and really enjoyed her meal as well.  Staff here is extremely friendly and all three people working stopped by to ask how we were enjoying our meal.  Unexpected five star experience and I highly recommend this place, though do be aware that they close a bit on the early side (especially for those of us who live in Brazil haha!)."}
{"text":"The food here is very good. It's a nice little food place and I enjoyed looking at all the things people had written on the walls."}
{"text":"Y'all. As I sit here with freshly cleaned fingers and a belly full of goodness, I struggle to stay awake long enough to tell you to get in your car, on your bike, on your skateboard, on your big wheel, into your Uber, whatever you gotta do and GET THYSELF TO FISH & FIXIN'S immediately. Like, right now.   So, I could not for the life of me figure out what I wanted to get for lunch. I went back and forth for hours. Cook-Out? Panera? Bojangles? Nothing sounded right. Yelp to the rescue, baby! I typed in lunch and up popped Fish & Fixin's. I saw a photo someone posted of their wings and was intrigued.   Lemme tell you what I found out:   They're located in a little strip mall off of Richardson Highway. They cook your food to order, so it's already leaps and bounds above some other places. They have multiple lunch specials. I went with the three wings and fries. Nothing's above $6, I believe. I should have taken a photo, but I was too busy asking about the banana pudding. (They aren't making that right now, by the way. It should be coming in the next couple weeks or so, though.) They have the crinkle fries and toss some seasoning on there as soon as they come out of the grease, but most importantly, these wings. Y'all. They season that flour up something serious and hand bread them wings. And the end result is glorious. Amazing. Delicious. Delectable. It makes me never want to make chicken wings again myself and only get them from here. And as my food was being prepared, I noticed somebody else ordered a flounder sandwich and that thing looked so good that I kind of regretted ordering the wings. That feeling was immediately erased after I tasted them jokers, though! Omigosh. Juicy, crispy, perfectly seasoned wings. And they have the hot sauce on hand if you need it.  My favorite part? They add a little wet nap in your to-go container for easy cleanup!   Overall, I cannot WAIT to get back to this place and take home a flounder sandwich of my very own, but I will happily bask in the afterglow of them fantastically glorious wings until I do."}
{"text":"Being from out of town I was wanting home cooked food I live 5 mins from fish n fixins we got fried whiting  fish Mac n cheese ( so good) hush puppies n fries the portions are on point me and my husband shared an order and he can eat!  I'll recommend this place to my neighbors"}
{"text":"Exceptional reviews brought me here, I had a double cheeseburger and fries, it wasn't bad, but there was nothing to it that would bring me back besides the customer service, kind of my fault for ordering a burger at a fish place"}
