{"text":"We were looking for something convenient and kid friendly while staying in Montreal. It certainly didn't hurt that it was super convenient since we were already staying at The Westin. The breakfast was excellent, both the Crepe and Blueberry pancakes were fantastic. The kids were able to take advantage of the buffet and they found plenty to choose from. The servers were excellent, attentive to our needs and bilingual (French and English). All and all it was a great breakfast experience."}
{"text":"Delicious food, gracious service, very convenient to our hotel and open somewhat late which accommodated us well. Maybe a little pricey but we enjoyed our meal."}
{"text":"We were staying at this hotel (Westin) and decided to eat here since it was raining out and what an expensive mistake!  First, the waiter only offered sparkling or non-sparkling water ($$), which we declined, then asked if we wanted something from the bar, which we also declined since we had just sat down and didn't have a chance to look at the choices they had for beverages (I'm a non-drinker).  Once we said just regular water for now, the waiter said, well 2 strikes then, which made us feel like cheapskates.  The food was mediocre at best.  I had duck confit, while my husband had roasted pork & pork belly.  The only item that we really enjoyed was the lobster bisque.  It was deep rich brown in color (which is different than what I'm used to), but full of lobster flavor.  The only other restaurant that had served it this way was the restaurant in the Sofitel hotel in NY city.  Oh, the waiter talked my husband into a $50 bottle of wine saying that it was a step up from what my husband had selected.  If my husband's original choice was bad, why did they even offer it on the menu??  Obviously, the waiter was very interested in pushing our bill up.  They do have a children's menu, but the waiter charged us the adult price for a small glass of milk ($4) instead of the children's price ($2.50).  Oh, and their fruit salad on their children's menu was really good and a decent portion at $3."}
{"text":"Hotel bar alert! Don't expect to meet locals here.  Gazette is on the 1st floor of the Westin Hotel. For any SPG platinum members staying at the hotel, there is happy hour (5-7pm) complementary drinks and breakfast included.  My husband and I have stayed at the Westin Montreal a few times and prefer this hotel to any other in the Starwood group in MTL because of this bar.   The bartender is the same from years ago--a sign that it is well managed. Service is excellent. We got draft Unibroue in full pints and watched FIFA games. Staff are super friendly. They played with our baby and will make recommendations if you are touring around town.   For breakfast, they have a solid buffet. As a frequent Westin guest, I would say it is on par with any updated Westin in North America or Europe."}
{"text":"Went for a family New Year's Dinner on the first. The service was excellent, though we were in no hurry and had ample time between drinks, starter, main course, cheese course and dessert.  The Caesar salad was ample and not overdressed--surprisingly fresh given it was at the end of the holidays. The BBQ ribs were served a la haute cuisine with roast root vegetables under the rack of eight perfectly cooked, fall-off-the-bone pork short ribs. Presentation is a concern. Over all, the dining experience was great, like most hotel restaurants, though, it's no bargain."}
{"text":"I was staying at the Westin and needed a quick, healthy meal without facing the snowy weather outside so I decided to give this restaurant a try.  Was I glad I did! I had a great salad which was exactly what I needed: all the ingredients were fresh and combined to perfection. The bread their served once we were seated was also delicious. The service was attentive."}
{"text":"I stayed at the hotel numerous times and this restaurant brings down this nice hotel. The food is not great. This  bar/restaurant  has no ambiance; No one hangs out here and it is not a fun place to come too."}
{"text":"So I had a free breakfast here and tried it out.  It's a standard breakfast buffet with the usual eggs, bacon, sausages, home fries, some baked items, some fruit and some cereal.  The odd breakfast buffet can be awesome but this one was definitely not.  Some of the items tasted funny and others tasted exactly like you would expect, being heated from underneath.  Breakfast buffets are a terrible standard to be reviewing a restaurant by so I apologize but can only tell you to avoid it.  However if you don't want to get a crappy review for a breakfast buffet would it not make more sense to move to an a la carte menu?"}
{"text":"We had the opportunity to have dinner here tonight. Our waitress Gabrielle was so refreshing. She engaged us and was very knowledgeable on the offerings. I would return to have her service any day!  She is a wonderful employee!"}
{"text":"We had the grilled chicken piri piri and the fettuccine with shrimp. Both were fantastic. Service was great."}
{"text":"The hubby and I  were staying at the Westin, so thought wed check out Gazette for a pre drink and small bite to eat before heading out. Sat at the bar. Took sometime to get served. Bartender was friendly. Ordered some moscow mules and falafel .  They make a good moscow mule here! Falafels were OK, but were extra crispy to the point where I was scared that the falafel balls would go flying if I stuck my fork in one. The falafels were softer on the inside. Not sure if it was the tahini, but the taste was more on the bitter side. Presentation was nice.  Pretty empty on a Saturday during dinner. Not my first choice, but it was OK."}
{"text":"Not a great place to dine. I am staying at the motel so thought I would check out the restaurant in case I had some dinner meetings.   Hostess and waiter were nice and courteous.  Small and not too crowded.  Menu is fairly limited.  I had onion soup for an appetizer.  It was ok, not great.  For the main course I had a seared scallop and shrimp plate.  2 of each.   I actually sent it back as it was pretty non warm when I got the meal. (after a very long wait).  They brought it back seared more with the plate very warm.  It was ok. No real zest to it.  Maybe I wasn't that hungry after the long wait.  I am going to give it 2 stars.  For the price I will try a different restaurant tomorrow."}
{"text":"After taking an evening stroll, I decided to stop in to Gazette for a glass of red wine (a $14 cote du rhone) and an appetizer, the Black Fin Tuna Tartare served \"on top\" of a crab cake.  For starters, the bartender and the hostess are quite welcoming and courteous. The bar/restaurant is gorgeous and clean and the decor of the walnut wood floors and beige interior match quite well with the cranberry red bar chairs which were very comfortable.  I received my black fin tuna tartare which I noticed was NOT on top of the crab cake. Why describe it as so? The crab cake wasn't made fresh, it was very thick inside and didn't show any characteristics of crabby meat goodness that a good crab cake should. In fact, in my books, no more than 30-33% of the crab cake should be bread crumbs / filling of non-crabby goodness...most of the crab cake, 70%+ should be crab meat and that's what I'd consider a REAL crab cake. This crab cake was obviously 50-60% bread crumbs at a minimum...  The orange mustard dipping sauce on the plate was beautifully presented however lacked flavor. The mixed greens in the middle of the plate were, well, mixed greens.  Next time I'll walk out of the hotel and try something else.  save your money and go somewhere else"}
{"text":"We were staying at Westin hotel. It was late at night and kids were ready for bedtime afer a long day at the pool. We did not want to leave our hotel, so this was the perfect spot to pop in for a quick dinner. I did not expect much to be honest, but I was wrong. Food and service were amazing! Small details are important to me and this place met it all."}
{"text":"I don't expect much from hotel restaurants, but Gazette was wonderful classic French food. I would eat here again in a heartbeat.    The bread that came to the table had several butter options, including bleu cheese, and even olives. My lamb shank was gigantic and wonderfully soft, the meat just falling away. My dining companion had a salad to start, and at first I was envious, but if I had ordered one, there was no way I would have been able to eat the delicious brûlée for dessert."}
{"text":"We came here for dessert and a night cap. We were staying at the Westin, so this was a convenient spot.  Our cocktails were excellent, and the bartender was knowledgeable and friendly. For desserts my husband had a cheesecake, and I had the iced nougat. Let me tell you, I will be craving that nougat until the day I die. It was so delicious."}
{"text":"Sub Par for a Westin restaurant, breakfast buffet was free which was the correct price."}
{"text":"This is probably the best restaurant I've ever been to. The food was great. I liked the ambiance. And the service was spectacular. When I came for breakfast there the second time, the waiter, knew me, knew my preferences. At some point later, I came there and it was very busy, the waiter told me that held a table he knew I would like just for me. I was impressed. Five Stars!"}
{"text":"Excellent service from Kyle and Anthony all week long during our convention. They were friendly, engaged and never stopped hustling."}
{"text":"On Yelp it claimed to be tapas/small plate and French, but my experience is nothing like that! The menu is standard upper scale hotel restaurant (Westin in this case) with nothing innovative or just interesting.   We had beet salad, Seared tuna and Fetuccini with prawns. The salad is very good: nicely chosen ingredients and well dressed and integrated. However the other two dishes were like cooked by someone who was cooking in a canteen and totally at a different level from the one who made the salad. The tuna was completely over cooked. And the ingredients in Fetuccini were broccoli, asparagus, spinach and prawns topped with flakes of Parmesan cheese. All ingredients are lumped together in heavy and salty tomato sauce without much consideration as to why it USA good idea to add broccoli and spinach when there is already asparagus!! Apparently the cook does not understand the ingredients.   All in all this meal is a great disappointment! The pleasant service does help but after all quality of food is the most important!"}
{"text":"My review is about how this place measures up as a wedding reception spot, for a small party of guests. Other than the professional escort we passed on the way in through the main doors of the hotel, the environment was much as I expected: fairly classy, understated, clean. For the reception, we were first treated to prosecco (my fave) with a raspberry floating in the fizz (this is how I'll drink my prosecco from now on). I gulped down mine, as well as my date's glassful, and then his refill, too. So, when our appetizer came, I was sloppily dropping forkfuls of food on the floor but, hey, what are wedding receptions for if not a circus for a few human absurdities?  The app, which was a salmon salad something-or-other was quite nice, served with crispy roties and a choice of goat cheese, butter or kalamata tapenade. Nom.  Next, white wine and an ahi (Hawaiian word for tuna) salad which was a stunning array of flavours: tuna tataki-style sesame encrusted chunks with mango, avocado, Palm hearts, toasted almonds and a lovely mix of greens. I was truly stuffed on this gorgeous salad, along with my several beverages.  My only complaint is that we were a bit rushed to order our food because a staff changeover was happening. We were there to relax and celebrate our friends' special day, so it seemed a bit off, but overall the service was very good. The children at the table were treated well though the child-sized dishes were enough to feed two adults so I'm not sure what happened there!  We had a private room with plenty of windows and the music was relaxed and enjoyable. Overall, I think my friends made a great choice with this venue for their wedding reception, though they possibly thought I didn't like the food because it ended up on the floor under my side of the table. No, dears, I was just a bit overly festive! I can't account for my behaviour when given limitless prosecco. The food was amazing."}
{"text":"We've been staying here at the Westin for the last couple of days and have dined here two breakfasts and a lunch.  The food is decent and the people are nice but this is one of the slowest in service I've experienced.  The breakfast is a buffet and typical of buffets the food is never hot.  There are a lot of servers but no real service. None of plates were ever cleared and the waiter stopped by only a couple of times.  In fact, he delivered some eggs I ordered but never cleared the plate underneath.   It's terrible and this happened both days!  We also ate lunch here because we didn't have a lot of options on New Years and there were only a few other people in the restaurant. We still waited 45 min for soup and a burger!  Honestly if I didn't stay here at the hotel I would never dine here."}
{"text":"Restaurant in the lobby of our hotel (Le Westin).    Appearance and ambiance quite nice.  I'm not even gonna hate on them over the harsh prices - I've stayed in many 4/5 star hotels and I always know to expect upwards of $10 per drink.  However, I did not care for several things.  First thing being the girl behind the bar.  Why they hired this woman who barely speaks and understands English is beyond me.  When we did not address her in French even after she assumed we were French (big mistake for hotel industry, since the majority of guests are going to be out-of-towners), she was quite cold and indifferent to us the rest of the time we spent there.  Clearly did not want to be forced to speak English to us lowly peons, and really didn't answer any of our questions more than what she had to.  Minus 1 star.  I guess the other big issue was, they stopped serving us at 11:30 claiming they were going to do an early last call because it wasn't too busy (Still about 10 people in the place though!).  Fine.  We believed it, until the rowdy group of guys at the bar started chatting her up asking where to go drinking now that she was closing, and she said to come to her local pub where she was going as soon as she shuts down.  Ahhh, now it all makes sense.  She wants us out of there so she can go enjoy her night herself, rather than staying open until a reasonable hour on a Saturday night.  Last call in Montreal is 3AM, and you're closing at 11:30 PM?  Give me a break.  Minus 1 star"}
{"text":"This review is for drinks only!! Since we were staying at the Westin, this was our preferred meeting spot before dinner! Our bartender after the first time, remembered exactly what we wanted so as soon as we walked into the bar, she always got our drinks together quick!!! The smokey old fashioned was good! We opted for rye instead of makers mark. Yummo!!!I'll take ten of those merci beaucoup!"}
{"text":"We stayed at the Westin in Montreal and looked inside Gazette, thinking it would be a reasonable back up choice for dinner and breakfasts.  We decided to go here while checking out thinking it would be a quick and painless process.  My girlfriend ordered the eggs Benedict and I ordered the scramble egg's platter. Both of which were EXTREMELY overpriced for the area. The taste was beyond average. and the service was so bad. You would think for an upscale hotel they could do better than this.  The only thing good was the environment and ambiance."}
{"text":"Great tapas and classy decor - the poutine is top notch! Calamari was great. It suits our palette. Looking forward to going back... Price is right for a hotel tres bien!"}
{"text":"Food took forever, and I just got a salad. Then they forgot to put the dressing on  side and forgot the bacon. My sister got the sliders and it was way overcooked."}
{"text":"We stayed at the Westin (attached to this restaurant) while visiting Montreal. We stopped in to have a drink and some appetizers.  When sitting at the bar they will give you a bowl of nuts.  Also, their cheese/meat board is delicious. They have a decent selection of wines, beer and liquor. Service was attentive and friendly. There is a parking garage as part of the hotel, but street parking is easily available if you want to take the time to look. I would definitely recommend stopping in for a drink or 2."}
{"text":"The service is unionized ...so it's a little slower. If you're looking to chat and chill..this is it. Friendly service and great food. Quality is hotel standard and lovely. Enjoy, but not if you're in hurry."}
{"text":"I was staying at Le Westin Montréal, a lovely hotel in Vieux-Montréal, so I decided to pop into the hotel's restaurant, Gazette, for a quick bite. What a mistake that was.  As I was eating alone, I asked to be seated at the bar. I don't know who thought these particular bar stools were the right choice, since they were way too low with respect to the height of the bar, and I'm pretty tall. Pity the poor woman who was a few stools down from me (and quite a bit shorter from me), whose plate was barely below chin-level.  The rather disinterested bartender saw that I had put the menu aside, so he finally came over with nary a greeting, took my order, and off he went. I guess the bartender became even more disinterested when I only ordered a Pellegrino to drink, as I only saw him two more times - once when he delivered my sandwich and once again to hand me the check. I doubt we exchanged more than 20-ish words total. Everything took an exceedingly long time, as others have noted in their own reviews.  Let's dissect my order, a chicken club sandwich: One layer instead of the classic two, on a rustic bread that seems to have been toasted earlier today and was soft. Several slices of chicken breast that had just come out of the refrigerator and were ice-cold, not having any real flavor. Condiments served in small Heinz bottles, as if I had ordered room service. The only good thing in that sandwich was the smoked bacon, but it wasn't enough to carry the sandwich. I had a side Caesar that was sloppily plated, hanging out of the side of the bowl in places, and the dressing was just so-so.   If you're going to position yourself at a higher price point, everything needs to be done with care, but I just got a sense of general indifference from the staff and from looking at the plate put in front of me. Gazelle probably earns the honor of the worst Westin restaurant I've visited during my many years of travel, given the performance of the front and the back of the house on this particular occasion. I'd dissuade you from visiting yourself.   A much, much better option for breakfast or lunch if you're looking to stay 'on property' is steps away and attached to the hotel, namely Les Moulins La Fayette (http://tinyurl.com/les-moulins). I started my mornings here during my stay, and I highly recommend you do the same."}
{"text":"My wife and I stayed at the Westin for 5 nights and they offer a $5 certificate if you opt to not have your room made up the night before. We did this 3 nights, so we had $15 in certificates.   We headed out on our last night on the town and we decided to use our certificates at the bar. I asked how much a beer was? \"$9.50\" Fine, it was free money, but then my wife ordered a Diet Coke.  I enjoyed my beer and my wife had her Diet Coke, which wasn't refilled once.  We got our bill and our waitress went to ask her manager and they said we could only use $10 of the $15. (It didn't say anywhere on the certificate that you could not use more than one voucher at a time) Then we got our bill. $4 for a small glass of Diet Coke!!??!!  Dear Lord! What a rip off place. What we thought would be a free quick drink turned out to be $6 after tip. Now I am not opposed to paying fair prices, but this was highway robbery. What should have been a wonderful start to an evening turned into a real bad taste in our mouths. A very big boo to Gazette, and Westin for housing them."}
{"text":"The restaurant is actually attached to Le Westin Montreal. I went here during my stay and did not get a chance to eat here. However, I was at the bar getting drinks and some more drinks.  Service was great, bartender was friendly and attentive.   Ambience is cool and sophisticated..."}
{"text":"I was staying at the Westin in Montreal, which is a beautiful property located very close to the historic Old Montreal part of town. I decided to give this restaurant a try, mostly out of convenience.  I've found in my travels, that most of the time, restaurants that are attached to hotels are not very good.  I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of food and service at The Gazette.  When my partner and I arrived at the restaurant, the hostess asked if we had a reservation. Apparently it was a busy night, as the Montreal Grand Prix had just finished earlier that afternoon.  But she found space for us at one of the communal tables near the bar, which was just fine.   The waiter arrived quickly to greet us, take our drink orders, and bring a basket of delicious fresh-baked rolls.  We started with the Gnocchi Carbonara, with lobster, green pea, parmesan, an. truffle fried quail egg. It was creamy and delicious, with so many flavors happening.   For our main courses we had the Sauteed Scallop, which comes with giant shrimp, mussels, clams, crab claw - gnocchi corn, speck ham, and tomato seafood broth. The seafood was fresh and cooked perfectly.  We also tried the Grilled Piri Piri Chicken, which comes with kale, chorizo sausage, multi color potato, grilled bell pepper, marinated red onion, and queso fresco cheese. Again, amazing flavors that all worked so well together. My only complaint here was that the chicken was over cooked, so much of it was really dry. I used the bell peppers and red onions to add some moisture to the dry chicken. It helped a little, but this dish could have been a home run if the chicken was cooked properly.   Overall the dinner was much better than I expected, and at the end of the meal I could just take the elevator upstairs to be back in my hotel room. I probably would not make an effort to return to this restaurant, unless I was staying at the Westin again, since there are so many other new places to try in the city."}
{"text":"i thought this place was phenomenal. i was staying at the westin and got in around 9 pm. my american iphone was not working and i refused to pay $15/mb of service to yelp an open restaurant. i walked around and everything was either closed or called burger king.  so i wanted to try something different. and man oh man....this place was awesome.  so here's what i got:   roast atlantic black bass & crispy rock shrimp with roasted onion and  porcini risotto, truffle butter sauce  are you honestly going to tell me that that doesn't sound good? unless you don't like seafood, mushrooms, or good food, then yeah, i can imagine you wouldn't like this dish. nor will you like 42% of restaurants on yelp.  yes, it's a little pricey, but so are movies that everyone goes to, cars that everyone drives, houses people own, or awesome meals like this. BOOOOOM KNOWLEDGE DROPPED.  this was my first time to french canada, and this place i will always remember."}
{"text":"Yawn.  2 drinks empty, sitting at the bar.  Can't get attention.  Maybe this place happens another day or another time."}
{"text":"The Gazette is attached to the Westin hotel and while some of our friends staying with us got to be at breakfast early in the morning and had drinks late at night, I only got to sample from the dessert menu.   I loved their bread pudding. I am a sucker for bread pudding, I love everything about bread pudding. And this was great. It was warm, there was a caramel boozy sauce too and omg, I loved it.   The service was oh so very slow and it was quite annoying. We were sitting for a good 10 minutes before someone took our order, and it took well over 15 minutes for our desserts to come, and another 10 minutes for the check. That was too long, way too long. Especially given that there was almost no one at the restaurant at that time. Bread pudding, great tho!"}
{"text":"Met some coworkers here for dinner. Walking in it was dark, busy, and bustling with activity. It is attached to the Westin next door.   We were seated quickly and drink orders sent off. Started with a bottle of red. It was excellent and we finished a second one.   The salmon tartare appetizer was pretty good. A slight hint of fishy which I don't appreciate in salmon which is usually a non fishy fish. Is That a thing? I think that it is.   The NY strip was cooked medium rare- as I had asked for it. It had nice marbling and the fat was tasty. It was a good steak and the butter on top of it was yummity yum yummy. The accompanying Poutine was good. It needed more salt which I don't like to add to Poutine. The gravy should have it. The cheese was spot on. I wish the fries where slightly more crispy but that is personal preference.   I didn't eat dessert but my coworkers did. They said it was 'aight.   I would go back for a second try."}
{"text":"Overpriced for what we got. The hostess actually scoffed at us upon our arrival with some comment along the lines of wondering where she was going to put us. Um, the place was not even half full.    It took about fifteen minutes for a waiter to acknowledge us.  At least he was nice!  However, it did take a very long time for our meals to arrive.  The food was adequate if slightly bland, but in this town, you can find much better for much less."}
{"text":"Déjeuner de travail avec une délégation Malaysienne. La salade de Prosciutto était joliement présentée, mais un peu légère à mon goût. Heureusement les petites miches de pain étaient nombreuses et variées (n'y voyez aucune connotation grivoise). Le plat de résistance, un filet de poisson était un peu trop cuit à mon goût, et les quelques légumes qui l'accompagnaient trop rares. Rien d'exceptionnel donc, mais soyons honnêtes, pour $21, c'était plutôt pas mal."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to eat and drink. We passed this place a few times heading to our hotel and it looked decent from the outside. Menu on their website looked yummy.   Had the beef and salmon tartar. Salmon tartar was better. Then had the steak with foie gras - excellent! All the drinks I had were good. Hopefully you'll get Anthony the Bartender when you're there - super friendly and can make recommendations on places to go during your trip to Montreal."}
{"text":"On our last night in Montreal, at Le Westin, we were unsure as where to eat. Too lazy to do any more research or walking, we decided to try Gazette, which we had noted, but sadly overlooked the preceding days. We were early, just between the tapas and dinner menus, and were told we could order from either; we chose the tapas. Well, these plates were not small, and were flat out fantastic! I ordered Angus sliders and poutine; my wife ordered the same sliders with a side Caesar salad. Shortly thereafter we received an entire table of food! The tasty sliders were accompanied by French fries, and were a portion unto themselves. My poutine was served in a small cast iron skillet, and consisted of sliced fingerling potatoes (rather than French fries), cheese curd and very tasty brown gravy. On top was a small portion of baby back ribs--fantastic! My wife's \"side\" salad was a full portion and delicious. We were a bit overwhelmed by both the quantity and quality of this meal. Was perfect after a day of walking through the city, a museum and the Underground City. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We went here for breakfast since we were staying in Le Westin. The breakfast and brunch menu looked good, and whilst checking out decided we were pressed for time so we decided to come here. The restaurant was pretty empty on a Monday morning, and we thought we would be able to have a quick meal and then rush up to check out. The food was pretty good, albeit easily the priciest place we've been in Montreal (there are so many excellent, cheap options in MTL). But the service was really slow. The waiter was extremely nice, but we ended up having a much longer breakfast than usual because we could never flag down the waiter. I understand it may be a minor hiccup, so if we ever find ourselves staying in Le Westin again, I would try this place again."}
