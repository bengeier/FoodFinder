{"text":"I've been there twice now and today was the last time.  The first time I went there I was grossed out by the filthy cutlery.  I could scrape the residue off the utensils.  That to me is disgusting.  Today, the food was good but the old lady waitress was quite rude and eager to kick us out.  She just took the plates off the table even as we were still eating before asking if we were finished.  Then when we went to pay, she practically demanded a tip and when she saw what she deserved for her rude service, she said 'that's it?'  WTF!  Finally as we left the restaurant she shrieked/screamed some curse words in some language.  I will never go back there again and don't recommend anyone else to either."}
{"text":"This place is right between work, school and my house so I was really looking forward to discovering a cheap Chinese restaurant that would be so convenient. The outdated, hole-in-wall style was very nostalgic for me and reminded me of cheap-yet-delist places I used to frequent with my folks. 
 Opted for the $5.25 lunch special since it is an awesome deal! Service was super friendly and accommodating, and even let me know that the spring roll did contain pork, seeing as I ordered the sour soup and mixed veggies and rightly suspected I didn't eat meat. Did take-out and the food took about ten minutes to arrive which I feel is perfectly reasonable for good Chinese.
Was pleasantly surprised to find that they add an enormous pile of rice to the veggies making the deal even sweeter. Dish was piping hot but unfortunately seemed to lack flavour halfway through the dish. 
Honestly had three spoonfuls for the soup and had to throw it out; it's contents were extremely rubbery and flavourless, and the broth's texture was thick to a point of almost being gelatinous!
Basically as far as food quality goes, it leaves much to be desired, but perhaps I may have ordered the wrong dish. This place gets three stars because the service was wonderful, the price fantastic, and I'm willing to give them a second chance."}
{"text":"Not a place I would sit an dine due to the lack of upkeep. Musty smell doesn't help and if you let you imagination run a little you can't help but think of the sanitary conditions in the back. Food was okay but I could help thinking if what I was eating was chicken? Couldn't enjoy the meal and it was take out. Its funny how appearance can affect the the overall product."}
{"text":"I used go there specifically for the hot and sour soup but the quality and taste has differed overtime and that's not a good thing.  

For what it is, the food you recieve is in huge portions so you get your money's worth.  It tastes good and its filling as well.

I just don't understand how everytime I walk in, there's a reserved sign placed on the table in the far corner with all the windows.  NEVER anyone sitting there, but it's always reserved. Really odd.  The staff are questionable and practically ask you to give them a tip."}
{"text":"My favorite hole in the wall! Cheap food, big portions, doesn't get any better for a student (I used to frequent this place a lot more when I was a student at Ryerson, and often broke and tired). I'd still go back for the nostalgia. In all honesty, if you aren't too picky, this is the best bang for your buck near Ryerson (other than street meat, ofcourse). 

Ambience: Hole-in-the-wallish but large.. just not classy. 

Crowd: Mixed, mostly students. 

Variety: Huge menu, but the daily specials ROCK!

Tip: Do the daily special and order the sweet corn soup. Best chicken sweet corn EVER. 

Verdict? Love it, want to go back. Any takers?"}
