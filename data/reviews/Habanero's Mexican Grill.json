{"text":"Same as other habanero's.  Best damn quesadilla money can buy at a really affordable price."}
{"text":"Best quesadilla I have ever had.  I go with steak extra meat with hot sauce and sour.   Real coke.  Sure the place isn't fancy.  But I'm reviewing food darn it!  And its great!"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp while I was on vacation in Scottsdale so figured we would try it out and it was wonderful!  The service was great and there wasn't really anyone else there when we went so Arturo stopped by and offered us some of the Habanero Tequila (apparently he makes it). WOW it was hot. Not really for me but very interesting and awfully cool of him to come out and offer us some.  Food was great! I had three different tacos (Calimarii, Blackened Fish, and Carnitas) and all were awesome!. Other people in my party got blackened fish entree, the carnitas entree, the carne asada entree. Everyone was happy!  Friendly people and great food. Pricing was very reasonable too. My tacos were $2.50/$2.99 each and most entrees were in the $6-$9.50 range.  Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. My husband has been coming here practically since it opened and it is the freshest, tastiest, fast Mexican food out there. The ambience is casual but the customer service is exceptional as the staff always asks me to have a seat and brings menus as if it were a sit-down restaraunt. Fajitas are out of this world but I find I can't stop myself from ordering the nachos the past several times I have been. Their red and green salsa is delicious (very important) and they even have an actually spicy hot sauce instead of a wimpy excuse for hot sauce that most places have. The owner works hard to keep this place with a friendly, mom and pop vibe that I think keeps patrons like us coming back again and again."}
{"text":"AHHHHH BURRITOS!!!!  This place is terrific.  I can't say enough good things about them.  The food is fantastic, the staff is friendly, the service is lightening fast.  Don't have much time for lunch?  Here's your place.  I can't wait to get into town to try their breakfast burritos someday soon!"}
{"text":"Incredible. Recently stumbled on this great lunch venue. We have ordered for staff meetings and all items were delicious"}
{"text":"I've passed this place a couple of times, so I finally decided to stop in and give it a try. It's about ten minutes till  9 o'clock,  and they are about to close.  They serve me anyways,  I wish she would have denied because the food was not  warm. The only good recommendation is that the chicken was freshly prepared. It ends there,  the pork carnitas were not flavorful nor were the pinto beans. I was also disappointed they didn't offer a combination platter or enchilada entrees."}
{"text":"I love this place because it reminds me of what good authentic Mexican food should taste like. I've had issues finding relatively cheap and high quality tacos my whole life (AZ native) but this place successfully does the job! Also the service is very quick and the people are friendly. I would recommend this place to anyone who asks. The blackened chicken tacos and carne asada tacos are my number one go to!"}
{"text":"Great little Mexican  joint. Reminds me of rocky point a bit. The owner is usually there and he's a really nice guy. Love supporting small business especially when the product is worth it."}
{"text":"Today's lunch special, the blackened chicken burrito, enchilada style with salsa verde was the best burrito I have ever had!! Outrageously delicious!!"}
{"text":"Quick, excellent and inexpensive Mexican food.  Order and watch as your taco, burrito or breakfast fair is made.  Eat at simple tables(the kind you will keep somewhere  like the basement) and watch Spanish speaking television.  They serve good Mexican beer (bring your i.d.) and a brand of soft drinks and juices that I have never heard of along with  your basic American-type sodas.  Also, the place is very clean. Takes credit cards and you usually get a parking space right in front.  Definitely, try  it."}
{"text":"BEST MEXICAN FOOD IN MADISON!  Habanero's is hands down the best Mexican food I have had EVER. I have been to several Mexican restaurants before and I have never had better service or better food. The tacos are amazing and I would also recommend the tortas.   This place is small and has a very cozy and intimate atmosphere. It is kind of hard to find, but look for it across from Farm and Fleet on Stoughton Road."}
{"text":"Great mexican in a solid location. It is small but was not busy on a Tuesday night. Must go in prepared...recommend blackened chicken tacos and the fish tacos. Cannot wait to return.   Best authentic mexican in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"My favorite are the chicken fajitas! The vegetables are crispy and the chicken has great favor. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The carnitas is amazing, burritos, enchiladas, or tacos. Try a burrito enchilada style!"}
{"text":"Love it love it love it !  Have frequented this local find since the day they opened last year. It's a locals favorite for sure. I now recommend this spot as a catering option for my clients as well."}
{"text":"Oh yes. Fantastic. This is one of those places I'd like to simultaneously tell everyone about and have it as a best-kept secret. Wonderful favors, nice service. Horrible little dining room, bright fluorescent lights, old sliding glass coolers. Totally basic, but so nicely done."}
{"text":"I went here a few weeks ago as part of my taco-quest, and was very not-impressed, despite the good I had heard about it.  I got three tacos and a drink, and the tortillas were really dry and rubbery.  The fillings (pork, chicken, steak) all kinda tasted the same, pretty much like grease, and the dude slopped so much into the tortilla, along with a splash of pan drippings, that all the tortillas just fell apart into a shredded, wet mess.  If they had tasted good at all, I wold have used the plastic fast food fork from the counter to finish them, but I thought, \"why bother?\"  The interior is your basic, depressing repurposed fast food joint, with cheap curved (and uncomfortable) melamine seats and worn-down tables left over from some KFC or something.  A TV in the corner silently barfs CNN or Fox or some useless crap to distract you from the ennui of the place.  Yecch.  If I was a fair man, I would try them again to see if I hit them at a bad time.  But I have discovered other places that are SO much better that I really won't bother.  I have a feeling it's *always* this time at Habanero's."}
{"text":"Great place, friendly staff and a relaxing environment. The food is great, we have had a variety from the menu and really liked all of it!"}
{"text":"After reading so many reviews on how great and authentic this place was,  we were very disappointed.  The salsa was not Bueno and neither was the food.  We were highly disappointed,  as everything from the guacamole  to the flautas tasted like onions.  The service was great and if the food had been decent,  we would be back often!"}
{"text":"I was in desperate need for a taco fix...  Thanks to yelp, I found a winner!  I really like this place.  I ordered a couple of tacos and they were SO good I had to order more.  The ground beef taco is a bargain with all that it contains.  (Lettuce, sour cream, cheese, & pico de gallo). The sour cream really sets it off.    It is important to note that each order is cooked especially for you.  The meat is not setting in a pan and spooned onto your tortilla.  It takes a little longer, but it's SO worth it!  If you can't wait then you'll just have to drive through a Taco Bell and suffer the consequences.  Enjoy the friendly service and wonderful Mexican food...  I want to come back for breakfast!"}
{"text":"All the components are pretty tasty. I don't love it as much as Chipotle, but I'm very happy to have it so close by in my neighborhood"}
{"text":"Not impressed.  I had the huevos rancheros with green sauce.  The sauce was bland - tasted like it came out of an 89 cent can.  Eggs were overcooked, and the potatoes were greasy.  With all of the reviews I read on this site, I was expecting something authentic and excellent.  I've had better food (and I mean this sincerely) off of a taco truck.  Habaneros: work on your textures, add a salsa bar, and trim the menu down-you can't be great at everything.  On the plus side, the service was good."}
{"text":"Nice quaint place, clean and basic. I asked them to repeat a few things and there was a language barrier which was difficult because I settled for what I actually wanted. Please understand English if you have a restaurant, or hire an interpreter.   I had the spicy pork nachos. They let you build them kinda like Subway does with their sandwiches, kinda cool. I asked for more meat and pointed at the picture that was fully topped with meat and the guy ignore me and put my nachos in the microwave inside styrofoam to melt the cheese. I was taken back and knew then I should had left. Styrofoam plus microwave equals poison. I was too hungry to care. After munching on about two thirds of the nachos I noticed that my styrofoam had melted into my food, sick. I'll pay for the toxins later,   I went up to the cashier and pointed it out and asked for a refund, he said I shouldn't have eaten it if I wanted my money back, I responded that I just discovered it (since it was near the bottom side) and I was still hungry and intended to finish it if it wasn't melted to my meal. After a few exchanges (civil ones) I fought back my refund.   The place could easily be a four star if they knew English, didn't melt my styrofoam container containing my meal and had better customer service skills.   I won't go back.   In my picture I posted of the nachos, you can see on the bottom left backside that it's melted."}
{"text":"This place came as a recommendation for great take-out Mexican from some local friends. We were visiting from Chicago, so we are used to some pretty delicious Mexican food. Habanero's did not disappoint. They parrillada was different and fantastic. We placed a large order and they got every last thing right."}
{"text":"This place is great.  I love the blackened shrimp tacos and fish tacos and they have some really tasty carnitas too.  I haven't had any of their burritos since I crave the tacos so frequently, it pains me to order something else when we do go!  My husband loves that they have Horchata in their self serve drink area.  We try to make it there at least once per month!"}
{"text":"Absolutely my favorite Mexican restaurant in Scottsdale! The service is ALWAYS friendly, the food is excellent and the price is right. What else can you ask for? My husband and I always split the Parrillada for two, which is amazing. Their homemade chorizo is to die for, and their roasted jalapenos are wonderful. Even their simple tacos are incredible.  Get there before noon or go after 1pm if you're going with a group and want a table at this location!"}
{"text":"Chipotle model, but food is consistently better for the same price. You choose a burrito, tacos, or some other main dish, then choose your meat and toppings. My wife and I had pastor; mine had habanero salsa and hers had salsa verde. Both were phenomenal. Nice attention to small details, too: the tortillas are warm and nicely browned, there are lots of fresh seasonings in the toppings, etc. Help was friendly. It's a great addition to the North Side. We'll be back."}
{"text":"after reading much wave about this place ... I must be honest that .... it doesn't impress me much   the place doesn't seem clean and the food is just very so so ... I feel I can get a better meal from Taco Bell ..."}
{"text":"this place is incredible for a small hole-in-the-wall  I think the blackened chicken tacos & carne asada burrito might be the best I have EVER HAD. they are somewhat addicting  big lunch time crowd and very busy with long lines. they do offer a call-ahead service that will save you time.  I would eat here 5 days a week if i could!  very casual, small and kind of hidden from the street"}
{"text":"This is excellent Mexican food in a strip mall location.  The staff was terrific: they were welcoming, friendly and efficient.  The food was wonderful, authentic Mexican food.   The nachos, enchiladas and tostadas were all super.   My only criticism is that the ample-sized margaritas could have used more tequila and/or orange liquor."}
{"text":"Wow! When you first walk in it seems like a fast food place, like Chipotle, but it really isn't. We went for lunch but I figure they would be good for dinner too. We are planning to go for breakfast while we stay, we are looking forward to the juevos rancheros. But the service is quick, the staff is friendly, they cook right in front of you. I highly recommend the tacos, the sauce they put on them is delicious, it's similar to some sort of aioli. Be sure to put this on your list!"}
{"text":"Ahhhh I love it when a great place forces me to get off my ass and write another review.   We were driving around and I had this unrelenting craving for fresh, delicious tacos...with a catch: not a chain restaurant and PLEASE not another fast food joint. So, I am combing through places on my yelp app when Habanero's pops up. How had I never come across this place and I live a mile away?!?!?!? Oh, and I forgot to mention, that this was on my last day in Arizona. Glorious. Secretly, I was hoping that this place would underwhelm me, just so I did not feel like an idiot for running to Taco Bell all those years.  We arrive and judging the place from the outside...well...I was underwhelmed and happy since my ego was still in place. Then we entered and I felt as though a permanent dunce cap plopped on my head. The menu looked delicious and my mouth was watering from the smell.  We ordered chips and salsa/guac, a fish taco, carne asada taco, blackened shrimp taco and calamari taco (the chips were $2.25 and each taco was $2.50). Everything was AMAZING. I would have a difficult time picking a favorite taco.   Please go and give this place a try...avoid the dunce cap.  MUST TRY: shrimp taco and carne asada taco MEH: chips (a little too thick for my taste) AVOID: nothing...try everything! Then run home to work it off. :)"}
{"text":"The Parrillada was pretty good. I got it for one. So, it's not as big as it looks in the pictures. However, the meat is nicely spiced and cooked. The beans were tasty and the guacamole was alright. Definitely a good spot/meal choice for a light lunch."}
{"text":"Amazing burritos and pleasant staff. I probably stop here at least once a week. Their commitment to locally sourced, organic foods is commendable. This is a  build your own line style burrito/taco/torta place run by a family with strong local ties. Not only do the burritos make my stomach happy but their ethos makes my my heart happy too."}
{"text":"after seeing such good reviews i decided to stop by for a late lunch with my family. the prices were pretty good and the inside looked neat. after ordering meal for 2ppl i expected a nice portion of food. the gave us each 3tortillas a teaspoon of guac and sour cream and a tablespoon of rice. also a tablespoon amount of each meat which looked only for one person. when we asked for more the charged us extra. also we paid almost 5 more dollars to recieve 3 pieces of shrimp which the mixed with potatos to fake it that you got a decent portion. over all taste was good but the extra charges and the amount of food you get for the price is not worth it. worst experience ever!!"}
{"text":"The people who work there are super friendly and accommodating. Good price. Pretty good food. Its hard to find if you don't know where it is at. But I will stop and get tacos whenever I am in the area at lunch. Love the corn salsa."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican restaurant in town. Fast, friendly service, GREAT meat, always a tasty treat."}
{"text":"Staff was very friendly. Happy to see vegetarian/vegan options on their menu!  More of a fast food environment but decent food!"}
{"text":"Loved this restaurant!  Everyone was friendly and laid back.  Food was authentic and cooked right in front of us.  Reasonably priced, fast service."}
{"text":"Just finish eating an the food was outstanding. Do not let the the hole in the wall exterior run u off. If your interested in eating awesome food over ambiance this is the place. Try the parrillada it won't disappoint."}
{"text":"I originally ignored this place when I saw a Chipotle reference (note: it's just counter style). Not that I don't love my occasional Chipotle fix, but that's not what I was looking for. I just wanted REALLY good food. After rereading reviews, it sounded tempting and I put it on my radar. Shortly after, we ended up in the area and were hungry, so we gave it a try. I am so glad we did!  The staff was extremely friendly. The prices were very reasonable ($2 for a super stuffed taco?!). The meat (between us, we tried the pastor and beef) was incredible. So were the sauces/salsa. I kept my toppings fairly minimalistic, but it's nice to know you can add what you want. The flavor of the food was fantastic. We all left so satisfied.  I will definitely be back, even though it's in an odd location out of the way (for us). Oh, and they serve beer."}
{"text":"Best tacos in town!  As was mentioned, it's setup Qdoba/Chipotle style. Quasi-cafeteria, semi fast-food. Service is quick.  That's no knock however, because the food is amazing. I've only had tacos, but I have tried all the different meats available. All are well seasoned and spiced, and you get huge portions of meat.  My advice? Get your tacos w/ only onions, cilantro, and the habanero sauce. Your tastebuds will thank me.   I am of the opinion that too many toppings detract from the quality of the meat, and you lose some of the flavors. Get it authentic style, and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Seriously the BEST guacamole I've ever eaten! and fantastic carnitas cooked RIGHT! I rate it as good as it gets FOR IT'S CATEGORY! Meaning, if you are looking for FANTASTIC food, that is real, for good prices and GREAT service, this is the place! If you want real plates, umbrellas in your margaritas and fancy whatever, then find somewhere else to waste money! The owner was incredibly friendly, came around making sure we were enjoying our food multiple times (and we got there 20 minutes BEFORE they closed-he even made FRESH guacamole for us! WHO does that!?!?!?). The server was very friendly, never once did we feel like \"it's almost closing time\". We ate at Cantina Laredo the night before, and both my husband and I RAVED about Habanero's to our hotel and business center where we were attending meetings! Can't wait to go back!!! Found them via Google search BTW."}
{"text":"Hands down the best burritos and tacos in Madison!"}
{"text":"Delicious little spot! Ordered some takeout. The blackened chicken burrito and lobster taco. Both were very flavorful and just the right spice. While I waited I was watching the employees and they were working hard with smiles on their faces!"}
{"text":"FRESH food! The guacamole was phenomenal and the hint of lime really completes it. I ordered the blackened chicken burrito and it was delicious. You can taste the freshness in everything, from the tortillas to the jalapeños to the tender, juicy chicken.   Friendly staff and quick service. Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"This could have been 4 stars.  I wanted it to be 4 stars.  I came in with my family asuming this would be as good as the other location.  I was wrong.  When we walked in, we were not greeted by the staff at the counter.  they just stared at us.  We ordered 7 tacos, a torta, a side of beans and 3 drinks. The Torta was more bread than anything else.  the amount of meat and toppings they give is ridiculous. The tacos werent bad but they could have used more flavor in the meat.  Someone behind us came in with a punch card and when my husband asked about getting one, the guy just ignored him. When he asked again, the employee said they were out of cards and to ask next time.  We asked for limes and we were told they do not have limes.  What the heck?  What kind of mexican restaurant doesn't have limes?  Not to mention, the place is filthy.  We left hungry and disappointed.  We wont be back."}
{"text":"This place is Qdoba's ugly step sister.  It's the same concept of Qdoba in which you pick a burrito, nachos, etc then your meat and the toppings.  For some reason, there were tons of cigarette butts in the front of the store sprinkled in the rocks.  It wasn't dirty per say but it wasn't the cleanest either.  We ate there just because we were lazy and didn't feel like finding another place in that area.  There just aren't many restaurants around that area.  Either way, I'm full which is perfect because I'm going grocery shopping and shouldn't shop for food when I'm hungry."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant in the Phoenix area. Staff is very friendly and every dish I have tried has been good. The blackened chicken is delicious."}
{"text":"Fantastic service, delicious Mahi Mahi bowl made fresh to order and a house margarita that is muy grande!"}
{"text":"Very nice blackened shrimp taco and chicken taco. The guacamole was heavenly. Cool place with a nice atmosphere. Go there."}
{"text":"Good food, great prices.  They handled our large group with no reservations very well.  Recommend!"}
{"text":"Man so many people hand out 5 stars like its candy.  5 stars should be for food that just blows you away.  This is not food that does that.  The food isn't bad at all, i would say its pretty average and will suffice for a quick lunch or dinner.  This is the issue with help and why everyone isnt a good \"reviewer\""}
{"text":"Habanero's is good fresh food at a reasonable price...but it's generally slow to get your food and/or so hectic it takes a REALLY long time to be served.  If you plan on dining there, make sure it's nice out--otherwise you won't find a place to sit inside and will be roasting or freezing outside!  Mad kudos for: --Cholula on the table --Really good food  A big boo for: --15 min wait after ordering...at 11:30...with 2 people in front of us --Salsa didn't arrive until after we finished eating despite 3 requests --No real combo options  The food beats Baja Fresh, Chipotle, & Qdoba--and all those places can be hectic as well, but after a couple visits I'll stick with my 3 stars.  Maybe I'll call ahead and pick-up next time...or just drive through the much closer Taco Bell and have some 35% beef :p."}
{"text":"Dude. This is a solid place. Great surprise as I was getting my car worked on. I had a \"Platillo\" $9 with carnitas and corn tortillas, also came with rice, beans, grilled onions and choice of several fresh salsas (pico, tomatillo, corn, and a couple spicier harbanero options). The carnitas were flavorful, lean and moist. Guacamole was an extra 75 cents - totally worth it.  Assembly line, so very quick.   Sweet hochata with free refills. The fountain also had margaritas, frappes with other usuals. Bottled Mexican pops and cerveza also available.   These guys take pride in their food and service. The dining area and restroom were clean and tidy. Do it."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in the area and it's not close. Staff is friendly and helpful. Atmosphere fine not overly special but food is great and very reasonably priced. Actually please avoid for lunch since line long enough already."}
{"text":"The burritos are as big as your head, weigh as much as your head and are only about $5-$6.  Fresh, quality and really good."}
{"text":"It's ok. I've been there 2x's. next time I'm getting the dish with the eggs on top. It look delicious."}
{"text":"Tried the special \"calamari tacos\". Extremely delicious.  Everything tasted fresh.  Definitely my regular from now on."}
{"text":"With all the authentic Mexican places in the Madison area Habaneros stands out because as a vegetarian, I can finally get something to eat! I'm not knocking all the other great taquerias, however its hard to find food that isn't laced with beef fat :( Habaneros is a build your own kind of restaurant but it is the real deal! Nothing fancy but great food. Also everyone who works there is super nice; it's awesome to have your food with a smile!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding authentic food for a great price!! The restaurant is small, but has outdoor seating as well."}
{"text":"I love this place! There are so many Mexican restaurant in Madison but this one is by far the best service and the best food. I go there about once a week and I'm never dissatisfied with what I received for service or food. If you try it out you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Good food, fast service, fair prices...what more could you want for lunch? Habenaros is the working stiff's Chipotle - high quality, wholesome Mexican food without the haute cuisine ambiance or high prices. The menu is beautiful in its simplicity...mix and match classic Mexican meats, breads, vegetables, salsa and cheese into one of a handful of entrées. Personally I like the rice bowl but the torta Mexican sandwich and tacos and burrito are amazing as well."}
{"text":"I highly recommend Habanero's! They have great guacamole and AWESOME pork tacos. For the price, it can't be beat. Their salsa is bland. And the waiters/waitresses came over every 5 minutes to check up on us. Which was really annoying, but it turned comical. I'm pretty sure they weren't communicating with one another about how often service was stoping by our table. Oh well, I'd rather have eager service than lazy service. My husband got fajitas and the chicken was marinated beautifully. For the value, this place is a home run."}
{"text":"Service was friendly & quick. Margaritas were good. Chicken fajitas were amazing but the rice, black beans & chips were just so-so. Great tomatillo salsa!"}
{"text":"Delicious tacos,  I had one each of barbacoa, pastor, and chicken, all softshell.  The meat was well seasoned with the barbacoa being the best of the three in my opinion.  The habanero hot sauce was great tasting but my mouth was on fire after all three tacos.  I will be returning to try the other taco varieties and the breakfast food as well.  Oh and did I mention they are open til 3am on the weekends.  I will probably never go to taco bell at bartime again.  The guy working behind the counter was very friendly as well."}
{"text":"Well worth a try!!!!  In a very hidden location, this place definitely fly's under the radar. Tucked behind KO's and Salty's in North Scottsdale it knocks both of them out with the taste and quality of the food. Everything is cooked fresh in the open kitchen after your order. I have been there many times and have sampled a few things, all delicious. The fajita burrito is my favorite and very filling for under $6. I have also had the Buenas Nachos which was a huge plate that was so good. My fiancee had the chicken enchiladas which she also loved. The guacamole is phenomenal and definitely fresh . Basically I have always had a great meal for a reasonable price and have been greeted by friendly people. Try this place!"}
{"text":"Great personable service atmosphere, with the food being truly authentic! Best habanero sauce around, finally a place where taste takes precedence over worrying about what the mass \"mild flavor\" people want!  Will come back again and again!"}
{"text":"Habenero's serves excellent build-to-order burritos and tacos. (Order at the counter, choose your shell, meat, toppings, etc.) The portions were generous, prices reasonable, and the service very good all three times I visited."}
{"text":"Not the easiest place to find, especially in the dark of night. But, oh, it is worth the effort.  Excellent taste, Great value. Friendly, fast service."}
{"text":"Fresh, tasty, excllent service. Carna Asada, Carnitas, Fajitas all good."}
{"text":"Absolutely awful. If I could give no stars I would. I went for lunch, and waited almost a half hour for some tacos and a salad. While we were waiting, there was two other tables that ordered after us and had gotten their food before us. When I went to ask how much longer it was going to be, both of the waitresses snapped at me to wait my turn like everyone else, and they would bring it out when it was ready. I would not recommend wasting your time or money."}
{"text":"OK-so we came here on a HOT, muggy day in the heat of the summer when the air is thick.  When we walked in the door you could barely breath from smelling the habanero peppers they had been chopping.  It seriously thought I was about to have a coughing attack but that's a good thing right?  I had a snack before I ate here and am so bummed about that because everything looked so delicious.  I ordered the carne taco. It was really good!  Hubs had the chili relleno - really enjoyed it. Kids ordered nachos & one of their nachos plates could have fed the entire family it was so big!    I can't wait to come back when I have my appetite on!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Super value, amazing tastes, and lovely staff. It's all the best things of a fast Mexican grill, with none of the bad things."}
{"text":"The food was great, I had the steak and chicken tacos.    The restaurant was clean and the staff is extremely friendly. This is the best value in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Relaxing, Not Loud, Very Friendly Service.  Carne Asada Fajita was solid, not the best ever, but really good.  Chips, Salsa, Guac for starters was great.  They are not cheap with the Guac you get a great portion with your entree and your chips.  Best part you can do your own free refills!  Get the sopapilla's for dessert.  You get 3 big ones.  Saved one for the next morning's coffee."}
{"text":"Food was good, not great. Too many tomatoes in the guacamole and the chips weren't fresh. The servers were busy and need a bus person. Margaritas were excellent."}
{"text":"Decent Mexican food for a good price. Great spot to come on a short lunch break with a few buddies. The Horchata is amazing I would highly recommend it, some of the best Horchata I have had."}
{"text":"This is my local watering hole and the people are friendly and like family. The food is outstanding, fresh and more than enough spicey! Personally the taco salad is my favorite and nothing like I have ever had with sauteed veggies and the perfect seasoning. Go have one of there great margaritas and grub."}
{"text":"Been going for years. Consistent, tasty, reasonable. Great variety. Really friendly owners and same staff for years. Never had a bad meal. It's a little hidden Scottsdale gem. Tell your friends, but save me a seat!"}
{"text":"Wonderful spot! Two great meals on two consecutive days. Grilled chicken is perfection, carne asada and carnitas are superb. Very friendly and helpful staff. This place is a keeper!"}
{"text":"I can't believe the quality of fish tacos they have woohoo...that's not easy to find. I was just in California and I was in fish taco heaven but this place comes super close. We kinda waitied for awhile but they fill you up on chip and great salsa so yay to that. Its very casual which was really nice. Really nice staff . Kinda dated decorations but whatever its still a great place to eat."}
{"text":"I've been trying to get to this place for almost a year now.  It is in a general area that I go to at least once or twice a week - Costco, K. O'Donnells, Golfsmith, Four Peaks, etc.  but it seems that I just am never around there when I want a light lunch or quick bite to eat. I finally made it!!  It is a delightful little restaurant located in the strip mall behind K. O'Donnells and serves breakfast, lunch and dinner. It reminds me of a taco stand in a building.  The first time I was there, I made it for lunch - and I could see why it has so many good reviews. The line was out the front door, but they simply take your order and you find a table to wait until it is done.  Although it was crowded, I did find a table, and was able to watch as they served lunch - very efficient, very friendly.   The food is delicious, made with fresh ingredients while you wait.  The menu is large.  I have tried the blackened chicken burrito, carne asada tacos, blackened chicken quesadillas, and, of course, the Dos Equis - all were great.  They also have a breakfast menu, and children's menu.  They have several salsas available, but once I found out they had Habanero salsa, I knew I loved this place.  For those that like less fire, they do have both green and red salsa, of varying hotness.     I have only given 4 stars as I haven't tried everything I want to.  So now I will work through their menu - it's a dirty job, but someone has to do it. But with Dos Equis, I will persevere."}
{"text":"Great family run place. We'll be back for sure! Terrific friendly service, great food, and yummy margaritas"}
{"text":"Great lunch!  The food was delicious. Very tasty. I had the  chicken fajitas my husband had cheese enchiladas with beans and rice and my son had the carne asada burrito. The food was prepared fresh, served hot and really good. The chips and salsa were plentiful- I preferred the green sauce. Definitely a place that we will visit again."}
{"text":"Finally made it here!  I've had this place book marked for several months when another yelper saw my  reviews for fish tacos and sent me a note to try this place out. What a great find. We started off with chips and salsa. They asked if we wanted the habanero sauce, and we tried it - let me tell you HOT!  I tried the fish taco and the calamari taco. The fish was deep fried, which I like, a good portion. It didn't have too much cabbage and was it topped with tarter sauce, again a nice portion. The calamari taco also had fried calamari, topped with a little bit of cabbage and a chipotle sauce. Both were very good. I have to say I would have preferred another sauce over the tarter sauce, so next time I will order the fish with the chipotle sauce. They also offer a blackened fish (grilled) and shrimp tacos (grilled), which I want to try as well. of course, I don't go anywhere without trying Dave's, so I took a bite of his beef burrito, and it was good. It needed a little of the Cholula Chipotle Flavored hot sauce, but otherwise, good flavor. of course we washed all this down with a couple of DOS EQUIS XX.  We had the opportunity to speak to one of the owners because it was late on a Monday night. He is an extremely nice guy. They just opened another location on Scottsdale and Shea, and both are family run. They take a great deal of pride in their food and service, and you can tell."}
{"text":"Some of the menu items are pretty good (shrimp fajitas, wet burrito), but others are not good at all (cheese enchiladas were dry and thin). Also, the salsas weren't very good, either.  Inside, the tables are set too close together. It feels cramped and you may get bumped into a lot if the customer sitting behind you at the next table tries to lean back or get up from their chair. The most redeeming part of my visit was the server: although they were SLAMMED in a dinner rush right after we sat down and she had the entire place to take care of, she kept a smile and was polite and moved as quickly as she could. I don't remember her name but it's the only reason I'm giving 3 stars instead of 2.  All-in-all, seems like it might be OK for take-out if you already know something there you like...but otherwise, there are a few better sit-down options within a mile or two."}
{"text":"Last Friday I was in the mood for some Mexican food and my boyfriends only condition was, \"Please, no more American Mexican food.\"  Living in North Scottsdale, I understand his frustration and turned to YELP to find something new.  After reading about Habernero's which sounded like the opposite of American Mexican food, I decided to try though I wasn't exactly sure what to expect on a Friday night since it seemed rather casual.  Well, let me assure you, going to Habernero's for dinner was the best decision I made all week.  First off, it is casual, walk in and order at the counter but after that you sit down and your food will be delivered to you, as well as you served the rest of the meal.  Need silverware, extra tortillas, you name it, they come to you.  The staff really could not have been more friendly, they were helpful but also just joking around making you feel right at home.  Now onto the most important thing, the food--delicious, melt in your mouth, perfect!  We tried the steak fajitas, blackened chicken platter, quesadilla appetizer and it was all among the best Mexican I've had in at least a year (probably last rivaled by an LA taco truck  ).  Not to mention the salsa!  There are 3, all with a reasonable level of spiciness but the habernero (orange) salsa really does take it to the next level.  My lips were still tingling 30 minutes after the meal but I didn't care, I am full on addicted to that stuff and can't wait to enjoy it again.    Our meal came out to about $20/person and we each had a full entrée and margarita (very good  very strong  1 was plenty ) and split the quesadilla and chips along with additional side items (extra guac, of course!).  So, in sum, amazing food, amazing value, casual ambiance (they do have outside seating but no alchy on the patio), so I know I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Blackened fish burrito special was huge and delicious, guacamole was chunky and fresh, and the house margarita was large and tasty.  Great value for money, and the service was kind and attentive as well.  Could not have been happier!"}
{"text":"I have been working near, and eating at Haba's for fir years now. In my office we tend to eat here at least one a week. Not only does it always impress, but it never gets old.   Ask the food is prepared fresh using traditional methods and spices. Everything they serve its hot, fresh, and large in proportions. They don't have fountain drinks, which is fine since my food it's often to go, and the choices are plentiful.   They just opened a second location near my house, it's dangerous for my wallet :(  Since I've found this place I've not been back to Chipotle out Qdoba."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! The family took a Yelp leap of faith after caving some Mexican food and we were not disappointed.  It was tucked back in a half-vacant shopping center but had a steady stream of customers all night.    All cooked to order, great selection of tacos (and everything else).  GUAC WAS FANTASTIC!! Their green salsa was really good too.  Good draft beer selection and really strong lineup of tequila.    Our family of four was in and out of here for less than what Chipotle would run us and this was way fresher / better. This will definitely be or new Mexican place going forward!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, awesome taste and great customer service! So happy there right around the corner and quick."}
{"text":"One of the favourite place for a quick bite by our family.My favourite is chicken quasedia.The waiters and staff are always very friendly.Saturday afternoons is the usual time that we go and is usually crowded and which sometimes results in usually long wait of 25-30 mins for the food to come."}
{"text":"Had the carne asada burrito and the lobster taco, they were delicious! Only bad thing about this place is the location :( im not a local and isnt easy to find if you dont have gps. But this is a definite place to eat if you want authentic Mexican food. Its a open grill layout so you can see the cook making your food. Everything looks well Presented when its brought to you. I would have taken a picture of the chips and guacamole but we started eating it. I would definitely eat here again when im in town."}
{"text":"I go to this place for lunch at least 2-3 times per week. For lunch it is amazing. The service is great, the salsas are good and I still have not had anything that I did not like. They just changed the shrimp they use which is an excellent upgrade. The steak fajita burrito as simple as it sounds is perfect, the carnitas are amazing and the carne asada is excellent. They also have orange bang which is super old school but really enjoyable.   Overall this is my favorite place to go for lunch. Fresh delicious food at a great price.   I have only been once for breakfast and to be honest the burritos left a little to be desired and they also do not open until 8."}
{"text":"Best place for lunch in the valley. At work whenever someone suggests Chipotle, I reply, \"how about Habanero's instead\".  What makes it the best: - 3 Salsas: Green, Red, and Habanero, all hot and each amazing - Freshly Pressed Tortillas - Your order is made fresh, the meat and fresh vegetables are all cooked just for you - Refillable Horchata - All for a good price under $10"}
{"text":"Food was ok.  Cook was rushed, threw food down on the counter, most of which spilled out.  Cheese crisp as underdone (meaning cheese wasn't even melted).  Cook put a bus tub on the hot grill, melted the bottom a little, then pulled it off and set it on the food prep counter.  Then he threw raw chicken on the grill, 2 pieces, then pulled one piece off and put it back into the raw chicken after it sizzled on the grill a little.  Place needs a cook that actually knows what he is doing in the kitchen.  If you ask me, I'm not going there again."}
{"text":"I've only been there once but it was so good it deserves 5 stars!  I got the barbacoa burrito and my husband had carnitas.  Both were delicious.  We added guac for 75 cents each,  well worth it. I forgot to try the onions that everyone's been talking about... next time!"}
{"text":"This is a tough one for me...my husband loves this place, I hate this place.  He raves about the fish and shrimp tacos, especially the blackened fish - those are his favorites.  I tried the beef taco and chile relleno.  Completely flavorless beef that I am convinced had been a hamburger right up until I ordered the taco - it was in big gray chunks.  Relleno was so loaded with seeds I couldn't eat it and it ended up in the garbage.  I will give it another try at some point because he likes the tacos so much.  Pretty cheap too."}
{"text":"Meals were all super good!  Service excellent!  Tostada salad was one of the best I've had."}
{"text":"The reviews were very good so my wife and I tried this place last night. Granted it was the Friday before Christmas and it was 30 minutes before closing but we could not have been more disappointed. My wife ordered enchiladas and I had a carne asada burrito. Mine came to the table 5 minutes after my wife's and when I bit into it it was cold. I sent it back to the kitchen and 5 minutes later it was re-served cold again. Besides the temperature, the meat was very tough to cut. At that point we gave up after registering our complaint with the manager. He asked if I wanted something else but by this time I had no confidence in the kitchen. My wife's meal was fair at best. She said her food was tasteless and not very fresh. I'm afraid we won't be back. There are too many good restaurants in Scottsdale to risk another disappointment."}
{"text":"We searched it on Yelp, went to the restaurant, and hesitated at the door, as it seemed quite small (12 tables/ room for about 40) and looked only \"OK\". The lady at the counter smiled and said lots of people have that reaction, but encouraged us to try. It was excellent, and low cost too, and great service. So good that we returned two nights later, on our last night in Scottsdale. Just as good the second time. Authentic, and they will make the food as mild or as hot as you want it. I definitely will bring my friends there next time I am in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I thought the quality and originality of their food was on par with what you'd expect from the Mexican food selection at Chili's. There is a lot of Mexican food in Phoenix and they do very little to differentiate themselves."}
{"text":"Very tasty food, friendly service, good prices. Stopped with the kids after the science museum. Would definitely recommend! The blackened chicken nachos were top notch! My niece and I split them and were both full."}
{"text":"I had the carnitas burrito served enchilada style.  It was intensely flavored.  The service is excellent and the server was friendly."}
{"text":"Why would you go to Chipotle when you could come here? The barbacoa was tender and flavorful...think of good Pot roast. The spicy pastor was also flavorful and lean. The guys were super friendly and fast.  The restaurant had a basic decor with clean tables and a clean bathroom...which I've been told likely means that the kitchen is clean. No farm-to-table or bells and whistles but that's not why you would come here anyway. I'll be back even though I live on the other side of town!"}
{"text":"Yummy food! You definitely get plenty of food for the price you pay. Lots of choices on the menu. My new go to place for Mexican food."}
{"text":"So I have had two different breakfast burritos and three different tacos from Habanero's and loved them all.  The carne asada taco wasn't as good as I was hoping, but it definately wasn't bad.  The carnitas is the best I have ever had.  It isn't dry, but it isn't covered in grease and doesn't tast liek it has been sitting in a bath a water.  It was perfect.  The blackened chicken taco was my favorite and the chipotle sauce is amazing.  For breakfast, I highly recommend a chicken breakfast burrito with the chipotle sauce added.  Keeps you full for a long time, is inexpensive, and tastes AMAZING!  If you are in the area, the kind service and wonderful food is worth the stop and any wait you may or may not have to endure."}
{"text":"Looking at all the reviews we had high expectations coming in. Fair waring this IS NOT AUTHENTIC MEXICAN FOOD. The food had no flavor and tasted like it was made three days ago. If want to try real Mexican food make an extra 10 minute drive and visit Los Taqitos, not this place."}
{"text":"Wonderful staff, great Mexican food!! Never been disappointed yet; as I come here once sometimes twice a week."}
{"text":"Horrendous experience, this place is a dirty little hole in the wall fast food set up with the worst tasting food I think I have ever experienced. They must have had friends or fake accounts write good reviews because there is no way anyone would consider any of this hot mess as good food. AVOID AT ALL COSTS"}
{"text":"We were vacationers looking for a quick, but good Mexican meal after a hike. This place did not disappoint. We ordered the Parrillada for two, with extra guac and chips. Everything was delicious. The chicken was good, and all other meats on the dish (beef, chorizo, carnitas) were excellent. If anything, we ordered too much food, but gladly ate nearly all of it. The medium and spicy salsas had both flavor and heat. The wait staff is helpful and friendly. Not sure how this place ranks among locals, but for visitors not used to authentic Mexican fare, who are looking for a quick and reasonably priced meal, this is the place."}
{"text":"Truly authentic, family owned restaurant. Mari took care of us and had excellent recommendations. The green chile sauce, carnitas de Jalisco and enchiladas were excellent but my margarita was weak. Food was made quickly. I will definitely be going back soon to either the Phoenix or Scottsdale location :)."}
{"text":"I had one carne asada and one carnita taco both were excellent. The salsa with the chips and salsa isn't very good though. A cheese filled churro rounded out my meal, I could have eaten 10 of them, it was so good. They also have cinnamon aguas frescas that is to die for. Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Chicken Burrito is usually pretty good! This past time it had a little too much rice and not enough chicken and sauce. I would go back again..."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Mexican places I've ever eaten. I'm in Madison twice a week and I stopped here for lunch both days you can't go wrong the food is delicious, it is made right in front of you. For 6 dollars and some change you can get a gigantic burrito with anything you want on it. I love this place."}
{"text":"New to town, found this place recently.  The crispy fish tacos and chicken tacos are dank!"}
{"text":"Habanero's is a great little spot. It's not usually packed and is always kept clean and tidy. I appriciate the attention to detail and excellent service..The food exceeded my expectations. Great place for a nice meal for 2...or bring the family (very family friendly). I reccomend getting a side of thier Chipotle sauce - its amazing."}
{"text":"Lively, loud, good food, friendly service. Small mom n pop type feel. Food is tasty, the spicy salsa is ultra hot! A little lick of it & I gulped down a bunch of water. Not for me. Margarita did not taste great but after a couple of sips I realized I was already feeling tipsy. Now I see why I thought the taste wasn't great, I guess I'm used to the watered down Lemony variety :) Would go again. Great value for $"}
{"text":"I like coming here when I'm in the area instead of chains. Great food. I always get the steak burrito!"}
{"text":"As with most things in Phoenix, it opens later than expected (9:00 am).  We're used to 5:00 am for breakfast burrito places.  My husband had a green chili sausage breakfast burrito and loved it.  Good salsas too."}
{"text":"Good local Mexican joint with the process of Chipotle; they have a menu similar to the counterpart system of ordering. You go in front of a glass covered buffet table and pick your ingredients.   We had the spicy pork tacos and shredded beef bowl. Both were excellent in flavor!   The tacos you get to decide between corn our flour tortillas. We chose corn but it lost the tenderness once pressed.   They have five salsa choices along with guac, lettuce,  and my favourite a xxx pickled onion and carrot mix.   There was a constant stream of customers the entire time we were there."}
{"text":"I love their short-order Mexican food! I usually get carry-out. It's fast but not \"fast food\" and it tastes fresh. Prices and serving sizes are OK. They have a variety of soda fountain drinks which include Mexican-style sodas, too. Plus, they have iced teas...and booze. I've had their shrimp tacos, burritos, and enchiladas. Plus, I've had their chips, salsas, and homemade guacamole. I highly recommend their food.  Their customer service if also fast & friendly! They're really nice people."}
{"text":"I like this place.  It's not fancy or exotic, but their burritos are satisfying and tasty.  They also have a selection of Mexican (I assume) sodas, which is a nice touch."}
{"text":"This place was good kind of pricey for a small plate of tacos but it was alright. I've had several plates but the tacos would be a better choice maybe? But last time it taste kind of off so didn't enjoy it as much."}
{"text":"Love their new location for cheap and plentiful Mexican cuisine.   I had the carnitas tacos and I gotta be honest, they were as tasty as the carnitas I had at Rick Bayless's restaurant in Chicago. The nachos were well executed, although we watched them microwave them-- I wish they'd just broil them, but still quite tasty.  Not gonna blow your mind, but quality Mexican food nonetheless."}
{"text":"My first taco experience! Had the spicy pork was flavorful, but not spicy for me. I enjoyed my taco, quick and fast hunger fix. Portion was goods, was full after the 2nd taco."}
{"text":"I had the parrillada and it was delicious! The food is great and the ambience is on point. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I am visiting Scottsdale and came here based on the Yelp reviews. I ordered the steak burrito to go and it was really good. Great portion size with a handful of tortilla chips with salsa. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I haven't tried much, but what I have tried was excellent. The chicken fajitas, refried beans, and guacamole are all awesome. I also love the Horchata drink machine! Yum!!"}
{"text":"Yep, as good as it gets. Ive been coming here for years and the food is excellent, always consistent and the Habanero Hot Salsa is by far the best.  The service is excellent all around, always a smile and alway paying attention to their customers. The proof is in the food, service and the clientele, the place is always busy which speaks volumes for a great restaurant. Well done Habaneros, The best."}
{"text":"Hidden gem!  Tucked away in a nondescript industrial park meets strip mall, you would never know this restaurant existed.  Staff is EXTREMELY friendly and attentive.  Menu isn't large but has a good variety of options.  The paraillada plate is a must . . . go ahead and add the shrimp.  Guac is fresh and seasoned well and salsas are spicy like it should be."}
{"text":"Hanero's is one of my favorite places to go for lunch.  It's right by work and the staff is very friendly.  My fave is the carne asada burrito."}
{"text":"Awesome, affordable food. Found this place just after moving to Madison & have gone back time & again. The staff is friendly; the place is clean; the food is great; & prices are reasonable.  My favorite are steak tacos on corn tortillas. DO NOT SKIP THE ONIONS! They make all the food on site & the pickled onions (slightly hot) at the end of the condiment bar are so flavorful that you'll want a heaping helping."}
{"text":"Catering experience. Phenomenal service and food all around, I have no criticisms  Habanero's came to our event, in which I was a guest, with many Sterno chaffing dishes filled with wonder. There was chicken and pork, rice, black and refried beans, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, cilantro, limes, guacamole, cheese, cheese sauce, sour cream. There were three types of salsa ranging from fresh pico de gallo to a fresh green salsa with heat to a very hot, smoky deep red salsa that did make me blow my nose. Chips, flour tortillas, corn tortillas were offered, wrapped in foil to stay warm.  Staff was very friendly, greeted each person but moved swiftly and I waited nearly no time. I observed them aptly answering allergy related questions of others with confidence. Food was quite hot, tasted extremely fresh. Staff served the food in large servings on the plate for you, custom to order (think Qdoba, pero autentico). One could order anything, everything, or minimally. I, of course, got everything and enjoyed every last bit of it.  I will absolutely use Habanero's if I am ever trusted with the responsibility of arranging the catering for an event. I cannot believe their parking lot isn't packed with lines out the drive through (unsure if that's actually in operation). I know I will be a return customer."}
{"text":"We were in the area and wanted a quick bite to eat.. We asked for counter service instead of table service and the guy was ok with it. Looks like maybe they offer table at dinner.  Gotta save where we can, tipping adds up.  I ordered the parrilla plate (spelling is likely off)  it's basically the all meat plate... Carnitas, Chicken, Steak, Chorizo and add shrimp for $2.  Comes with beans, rice, sour cream and guacamole.  Yummy!!!  My son ordered the cheese Enchiladas plate, came with Sour Cream. That's a huge plus, most places charge for sour cream.  My husband ordered the Carne Asada burrito.  Lots of meat and very tasty.    Clean Restaurant and Friendly Staff!!!"}
{"text":"Always searching for a great Chiles Rellenos I stopped by Habaneros today and I was very pleasantly surprised.  Most Chiles Rellenos in Phoenix Metro are 'Gringo Style', meaning a small chili entombed in thick batter or egg, stuffed with crappy yellow cheese and smothered in some sloppy assed sauce to where you can barely find or taste the chili.   They call that 'authentic' by the way and unfortunately most people thing that is the way to make them.     Habaneros Rellenos was near perfect:  a nice healthy chili (Anaheim, not Hatch, but OK)  in a paper thin egg batter with white cheese inside.  It coms with Pico de gallo but if you ask they will make it was green chili sauce on top.  That is all you need to know about the proper way to make Rellenos... it is about the chili.  Served with beans & rice, the beans are cooked, not refried, so no lard if you are being heart healthy.   The rice is cooked well, the texture light and fluffy, just enough tomato to flavor it.  The tortillas are thin and steamed and served in foil.  Ask for the salsa de la casa as well.....  The only negative is that Habaneros uses plastic plates which don't do well for retaining heat.  If you are a slow eater your food will cool.   But that is the only negative and accounts for your dinner being $9.99 instead of $13.50 like the others.  16 oz Mexican beers are only $2.99 at Happy Hour and the staff are truly friendly and accommodating.   How many times have you been asked you name in a Snottsdale Restaurant lately?   And been told they will remember you?  You can usually tell a good Mexican Restaurant by how many Mexicans are eating there after Church on Sunday, and there were a bunch today!   I felt bad being the poorly dressed Gringo amongst all the nicely dressed Catolicas.  Mui Bien!"}
{"text":"I was not pleased. My roommate and I went here based on the really good reviews on Yelp. The food was sub par at best. The chicken was incredibly dry. Also, my roommate and I did not feel well after eating at this establishment. The only reason they are relatively getting any good stars is because the staff was decently friendly. Would not recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"Came here before dropping my friend traveling back to Chicago at SkyHarbor Airport. It's only about 10 minutes to airport. We were greeted upon entering and our waitress Sylvia was great. We shared a plate that included steak, chicken, chorizo, pork with grilled onions & jalapeños. Each of us got a plate of beans, rice & guacamole along with sour cream. Of course we received tortillas(your choice of corn or flour). My friend loved the margaritas most, she had 4. Happy hour is short 3-6pm. I will be returning soon since I have family coming into town soon."}
{"text":"Our first time there, so we had 3 different tacos and a shrimp-burrito.  Very fresh and flavorful.  Burrito was surprisingly good, and so was the fish taco and blackened chicken.  We also tried the flan -- this was the best surprise.  Was great!  I don't think you can find anything that will top this place as far as a casual Mexican food joint in Scottsdale. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Wish there was on on the west side of town.  Fresh ingredients. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Came to Yelp to located a reasonably priced Mexican restaurant in Scotts and found Habanero's and so we took a chance (albeit calculated). This location has been open for 8+ years and I can see why. The ingredients are fresh, tortillas are home made and the food is awesome. Maria served us and she was very friendly and helpful and made menu suggestions since it was our first time. Obviously she knows what is best on the menu and we really enjoyed everything she suggested. I will say the blackened chicken tacos along with the blackened fish tacos were fantastic. If you are \"jonezin\" for some really good Mexican food, this is the place!"}
{"text":"This place is located on a frontage road on the east side of Stoughton road in east Madison. The place is clean, service is friendly and fast because you order at a bar like you would Qdoba or Subway, and prices are relatively cheap. Food wise, I have a love/hate relationship with Habanero's. I'd like to think the ingredients are fresh, but wouldn't be surprised if they are a day or two old at times. I usually order the tacos, which are consistently good. They use local tortillas and you can choose either flour or corn. They have four to five meat options, plus all the regular Mexican type toppings. My favorite tacos are chicken with fajita veggies, tomatoes, cilantro and hot salsa. The pork carnitas are also pretty good.   Overall this place is pretty legit for the price point. It's fine if you need a quick bite. But if you're looking for some really good Mexican, I'd suggest elsewhere."}
{"text":"Food was great. I ordered the Parrillada plate and had them add shrimp for 2.00 more. I will never do that again. 3 little shrimp for $2.00. Way to much. The waitress talked to the owner and all he did was shrug his shoulders.  Everything was awesome tasting though. Steak very tender. My boyfriend and I will be back."}
{"text":"I've gone here countless times since a friend recommended it to me, and I haven't been let down once! The staff is always nice and welcoming and the food is amazing. I've tried tacos almost everywhere in Scottsdale and these are probably my favorite. They're really quick too!"}
{"text":"Absolutely, positively delicious!  My boyfriend and I had about 10 minutes to grab food before catching the 7:30 show at the Nash last Thursday.  I placed our order over the phone with the intent to just pick up our food and head straight to the Nash.  A lady took my order over the phone.  I ordered a chicken quesadilla ($7.25) for the Mister and a blackened shrimp burrito ($8.00) for me.  The lady repeated my ordered back to me, it was correct, she said my name twice and told me the total.  Once we got there my shrimp burrito was ready but for some reason, the cook said he didn't get the chicken quesadilla order so we had to wait a few minutes.  It didn't take long for them to make it but we were pushing it because of the 7:30 show time at the Nash.  For those who aren't familiar, the Nash is no longer BYOB.  They now sell beer and wine for pretty good prices.  They do allow you to bring your own food or snacks to eat while you enjoy the show.  So that's exactly what we did.  On first bite, the shrimp burrito was out of the world good!  Everything, everything taste so house made.  The rice, the guac, everything.  Same with the chicken quesadilla ... first bite, you're in heaven.  The chicken is grilled to perfection.  They were HUGE!  Made with green peppers, fried onions and gooey cheese.  The prices were really good too.  Total bill about $16 bucks.  Honestly, the best shrimp burrito and chicken quesadilla I've ever, EVER had in the Valley!"}
{"text":"Underwhelmed after the hyped expectations from the other reviewers. Easy to miss, small store front in strip shopping area. It is relatively quiet except for the game shows on the TVs. Blackboard menu is a little confusing at first. My \"server\" (counter service only) was very difficult to understand; nice enough. I had some difficulty understanding his questions about how I wanted my food. Forget about drink refills, they serve sodas via bottle or can only. It is inexpensive and the meal was filling. I did not find the offerings particularly interesting or diverse."}
{"text":"I don't get what all the craze is about. My burrito was just okay---I had better burritos in Boston which doesn't really say much about haberneros. It's better than all the chain burrito places but it doesn't leave me saying \"wow. That was good.\""}
{"text":"Margarita's to-die-for. The Parrillada is incredible. Chips and salsa is great as well. You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"The food is amazing. It is cooked fresh, while you wait. I have nearly everything on the menu and cant find anything I cant recommend. I have been to both of the other locations several times and am glad they came downtown."}
{"text":"The food is always delicious and served quickly. Been coming here since it opened. One of my favorite places. Get the taco salad..it's great"}
{"text":"Got a burrito plate with tortillas on the side. The cashier was kind enough to give me the tortillas for free!  Great flavor and no wait! Honestly just ordered and got the food within minutes! Definitely recommend coming here for Mexican food. Solid food, wonderful flavors, and great portion size."}
{"text":"Small, quaint joint. Whoever is dialing up the grill is doing it right. Attention to detail is key here. Although a small, fast food type botique with comfortable seating, everything is prepared to exacting standards..."}
{"text":"I just love this place. I always get the three tacos. So fresh and fast and tasty. Spicy pork is great. Pickled onions are amazing. Great basic guacamole."}
{"text":"I have been here a half dozen times for lunch.  The menu is fantastic, the food is flavorful to the point that it's almost addicting.  The service is very very good.  I have varied my orders between the breakfast menu, lunch and specials.  I have never regretted my plate.   This a great lunch choice for Mexican Food."}
{"text":"Great food, clean environment, friendly and fast service! The guacamole was very fresh. All of the food was well prepared. Would recommend."}
{"text":"OMG try their breakfast burritos!!!!  Habanero's has good, cheap, fast Mexican food."}
{"text":"We decided that it was time to try Habanero's Mexican Grill for the first time tonight.  This \"locals\" establishment is occupying an old Taco Del Mar location (that closed in early 2008) in a strip center behind the Salty Senorita; just north of the Scottsdale Gun Club.  The decor has been upgraded, slightly, from the previous quick-service business.  There is no table service, though there is real-metal silverware and the tables are bused.  I ordered the fried fish tacos and my wife had a carne asada taco.  The kids ordered cheese quesadilla kids-meals with fries.  We split two Mexican Cokes, a Jarriots and a horchata. The total was $20ish and the food was prepared fresh, as we sat at the bar-stools overlooking the grill.  After the meal, we agreed that the quality far-exceeded the price.  The fish tacos were crisp and balanced; the steak-taco was plain and simple with good flavor; and the quesadillas were too-big, and the kids loved them.  Overall we'd give the place a solid 4 out of 5.  The staff was friendly and helpful...even providing me a sample of the carnitas that was freshly prepared; very nice.  This location is situated in a neighborhood that gets blitzed during weekday lunches.  We recommend coming here on the weekend and/or in the evening."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been looking for some amazing mexican food and we found it. Had to wait a little bit to get the food but it was well worth the wait! The nachos were out of this world and the burrito and quesadillas were amazing. Definitely will be back!!!"}
{"text":"The Mexican food was standard fare. Salsa verde was really good but their regular salsa was sweet. Fried fish taco was yummy. Good service even for a large party."}
{"text":"Never left a review before... This place is great authentic Mexican food. Habanero salsa is FIRE!! I had the parrillada and I added shrimp. Great sampler of everything they have!  Get the pico and add some habanero salsa to it for a kick. Beans were amazing. Sounds like a fluffed review but it's not. This place is the real deal!"}
{"text":"Me and Julie's first visit here. We found this place on Yelp. We needed to stop over and get dinner. Great food the fish tacos and carne asada tacos are very good. Also the chips guacamole and salsa are excellent. If we are ever in the area again, sure to be back. They also serve breakfast as well here."}
{"text":"I would classify. Habenero's  set up as a Mexican Subway.  The burrito's are huge! and even larger if you like alot of ingredients. They have about five different options to start from,Mexican soda, a margarita machine and a fountain machine. Eat and drink for six to nine bucks! The margaritas come in a Styrofoam cup and look like an Icee, that being said I almost walked out the door with it, good thing because there we're two sherrif's  parked out side! I will stop in again, it was convenient,fast and filling."}
{"text":"This place is AWSOME! If you're looking for nice little mexican joint, this is the place to go. Cheap and great food that more importantly, fills you up.  The salsa is amazing and same with the guac.  The owner just got his liquor licsense recently so now you can even grab an ice cold mexican beer with your mexican food. They even have a happy hour special of a bucket for mini-mexican beers for only $5! wow, just talking about this is making me hungry. I'm on my way! See you there!"}
{"text":"First, I should say that I am no expert on Mexican food. With that said, I did take out at Habanero's Mexican Grill while in Scottsdale last month, and I liked it.   My blackened chicken quesadilla was good, and my wife's liked her blackened chicken burrito."}
{"text":"North Scottsdale is blessed to have Habanero's in its' midst, and here's why..... All the other Mexican food establishments in the area are corporate with little or no authenticity. Mexican food in North Scottsdale is pretty much styrofoamic. (Is that a word? It is now). And then along came Habanero's.  Clearly this place is a family operation.  The menu has a nice selection and is very economically priced. Fajitas are like $7, but we didn't get them. We ordered Chicken Nachos to start and they were wonderful. I liked that they were light on the cheese and heavy on the chicken. Very tasty.  We also got Blackened Shrimp tacos and fish tacos.  All were excellent.  My little guy got the kid's cheese quesedella and he was happy. The tacos had great flavor. The bill was very low. Keep up the good work and try this place before it gets packed."}
{"text":"Wow what a delicious burrito for the price. Im a Titanium Member at the Scottsdale Gun Club so I wondered by this place after shooting one day and ordered the Shredded Pork Burrito which I found to be loaded with flavor. The food is fresh and while the location is a little hard to find its worth it if you are looking for a good value and you love Carnitas or Fish Tacos.  The restaurant is small however the outdoor seating helps to accomadate the many folks who have heard about this little gem and keep returning much like myself.  I've been back a few times to try some of the other items and they are really good and most importantly fresh as well.  Recently, I visited for another round and the owner even remembered my name which was very impressive but most notable is that he really cares about the quality of food they put out here.  No hype just great food at fair prices."}
{"text":"Best Veggie Burrito around!  The Staff is always friendly and kind and quick.  The restaurant isn't so easy on the eyes, but really great places seem to roll that way.  I would recommend calling in your order in advance if you want it TO GO.  Not much room to sit around and wait for it to be done.  My GO TO place for lunch when I am craving Mexican!"}
{"text":"Excellent black been quesadillas!! The prices are great!!! I will be back! Friendly servers and staff. Authentic food!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! Not fancy, no frills but a definite place for a quick lunch or dinner that leaves you satisfied or stuffed in our case. Three salsas. The orange one is fire hot and awesome. Felt my tongue go numb and everything. The chips were pretty tasty, too. Service was timely and good. I liked that I could watch the chef prepare my food. I also can't complain about the price for two of us. We only paid 25 bucks for everything! Salsa & chips, soda, and fajitas for two. And the fajitas were seasoned well and brought out on a hot plate. Free tortilla refills, too. If we're in the area again we will be back. Only bad thing is bathroom looked like it needed a little love, but otherwise everything was great."}
{"text":"A much better choice than Qdoba or Chipotle. Pork was prepared perfectly. Green salsa was the perfect compliment. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great food, nice, quiet environment, a little tough to find in a strip mall but totally worth it! The flan is outstanding, like all the tortilla options that come with dinner (they were not stingey with sides), and the staff were great. Agree with other reviews that the salsa was just OK.  Tasty, but far too thin; nearly impossible to eat with chips. Will definitely come back.  It's sooo much better than the other Mexican food restaurants nearby at FLW and the 101."}
{"text":"This place was a pleasant surprise ... looks totally \"chain restaurant\" (or worse) from the street, but it's apparently a one-off that just shares space with Jimmy John's (go figure).  Drinks were good, and adovada was really good ... could have been served hotter however, and having to ask for the key to use the restroom makes it seem like I'm eating in a Texaco station ... still, it was decent food and the prices were fair ... we will go back."}
{"text":"The food was great, but I was really impressed with the customer service!  Our waitress was super sweet, really attentive, and more than what you usually get in Scottsdale :)  Back to the food... I had a blackened shrimp salad that was bomb and my husband had the nachos which were loaded! I want to go back for the tacos and fajitas!"}
{"text":"Not sure why their chicken is orange. I've never seen that before. Overall decent, definitely a lunchtime stop and not dinner."}
{"text":"HIDDEN GEM ALERT!!! I found about this place last week when I made a wrong turn into the parking lot and was starving, so I decided to try it out.   I've been back 3 times since. This place is awesome.  It's fast, fresh, cooked to order .  To be fair, I have only had the blackened chicken tacos on corn tortillas each time, but they are THAT good.  the serving sizes are no joke either, so be prepared to share or be really full.    The horchata is pretty damn good too.    My fiance has tried the bean burrito, the blackened chicken burrito and the fajitas and all have gotten rave reviews from him and he's pretty picky about his mexican food.  The prices are moderate, which makes it an even better find.  The service is always top notch, eager to help.  Excellent food and great prices, what could be better?"}
{"text":"Just sooo good! I am a mexican food freak! This place just hits the spot when you want some fast tacos or some nice burritos man come here and get down!"}
{"text":"This was a gem. Tucked away and very authentic. You can always tell a good Mexican restaurant when the clientele are Mexican. Loved the fajitas."}
{"text":"Man I love this place.  A more basic, and better priced version of Chipotle.  Authentic and tasty, the steak or pulled pork burritos are the best options.  Guacamole that's not over-sour creamed is a must.   The don't skimp on quality and are locally owned."}
{"text":"Ok, i know I am Hispanic but I had never had a parillada before. WHAT?  Ordered this tasty little dish for my husband and i to share (the 2-person parillada) Steak, Chicken, Chorizo, Shrimp, Potatoes, Onions, Jalapenos, Tomatoes all grilled up and served on a chafing/ grill dish. Served with a side of  beans, rice, tortillas, guacamole for each person. All this and a happy hour Modelo beer for $2. Had some sopapillas (deep fried flour puffs with sugar and honey) for dessert and thought they were ok.  Thank you for a fantastic meal, Habaneros! We are now loyal fans!"}
{"text":"I'm coming back. As I've said in previous reviews, I have had a wide variety of Mexican food. 32 years living in the American Southwest will do that to you. I've been to greasy 'how are they still open' dives, upscale fusion cuisine and stuff in between.   Habaneros has no business being a hole in the wall that isn't packed. The food was excellent. My wife went to the Hawaiian joint next door and walked out wishing she had come with me.   They make their own chorizo (a Mexican don't ask what's in it food) which I enjoyed in the chorizo breakfast burrito. I also ordered the staple of guerro cuisine, the cheese quesadilla. It was all up to standard. I also enjoyed their refried beens (which didn't seem canned) and their Spanish rice. Would have liked the rice to be a bit spicier, but it may have just been overshadowed by the well seasoned chorizo.   Long story short... Va a Habaneros y comer."}
{"text":"Best burritos in Madison. Hands down. Think Chipotle or Qdoba... only privately owned and better quality.  The set up is a bit like a Chipotle or Burrachos; and the choices are endless. You choose your base (ei: burrito, quesadilla, tacos) and then all of your ingredients.  I'm a burrito type; with rice; lettuce; guac; pico de gallo and salsa verde. The burritos are MASSIVE.  It's a quick place to get lunch and I am never disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is really awesome! I had a fajita burrito with steak and added rice and cheese. Now going back for a second time. I will definitely be back the quality is good and the price is right!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome! This little hole in the wall Mexican place is the best.  Love the blackened shrimp tacos and my husband always gets the chicken burrito.  So good!"}
{"text":"The food was very good and the waitress was very pleasant.  The restaurant was clean.  The place was ideal for visiting with family and friends.  I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Amidst one of the wealthier parts of the valley, Senor Taco is a gem because it provides excellent food for an exceptionally low price. Even during the busiest hours, orders are taken quickly and the food is made promptly, however, one can still plan on having a lunch meeting and not feel rushed. Those looking to eat very good Mexican food and save some cash have found the perfect restaurant."}
{"text":"I've only been there once but my carne asada burrito sucked. The meat was tasteless and my tortilla was soggy from all the grease."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and was going to sit down but it looked so sad and depressing so I ordered my food to go. Then I waited 20 minutes for that order. At that point, I had to leave, so I went to ask the woman at the counter if my order was ready yet, and she turned and grabbed a bag that had been behind her on a shelf for a while! Not sure how long it would have taken to get my order if I hadn't said anything!  The food is good. Mexican fast food, basically. I had a chorizo quesadilla that came with sour cream and guac.   I don't really see the point in coming back, though. Oh well, I tried."}
{"text":"Really great fast casual Mexican.  Quality and great flavor.  I haven't encountered a strange piece of meat as you might at other spots.  I have gotten take out here 3 times and they are friendly, fast and good.  Can't beat that."}
{"text":"Nothing Great, Got the Blackened Chicken Burrito and it was really bland. If I'm ordering Mexican food I want tastes and flavors to be exploding in my mouth, I got red and green salsa for my chips, neither had much flavor and both were pretty watery giving me no relief when I tried to put them on my burrito. I finally  resorted to putting Tapatio hot sauce all over my food and it ended up being alright. On the upside however, the chicken was very tender and pretty tasty, considering. Probably will just stick to Arriba's down the street, a little pricier but their food has more flavor and their servings are bigger."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in North Scottsdale.  The staff is very friendly and the food is ready quickly."}
{"text":"Look at all these reviews! I thought this place was my hidden gem. I go all the time for a solid breakfast burrito but they a menu full of great stuff. Staff is awesome too"}
{"text":"Delicious burritos, that's all I've had because that's the first thing I ordered and haven't regretted it once yet.  Hot/spicy onions are addicting"}
{"text":"Shared carne asada burrito and chicken fajitas. Burrito had mediocre tortilla and not very flavorful carne asada.  Beans accompanying fajitas were among the most tasteless I have ever eaten.  Chicken average at best."}
{"text":"Dynamite food one soft carnitas taco will be an entire meal for about $3. All the food is great and a local business to support. I have not been disappointed once!"}
{"text":"Very solid spot for fast food style, yet homemade quality Mexican food. Had shrimp fajitas, priced right at about $8.99, was really good. Wife likes the steak quesedilla from here, tried it, very good as well. Funky smell coming from bathrooms could be fixed in an instant with charcoal filters. That would be my only complaint. They also have this cute, tiny, full bar, in case you feel like putiing a few back! And again, prices are very fair. Like it a lot!"}
{"text":"Great spontaneous stop for a Saturday dinner. The blackened fish and chicken were fantastic, but the carnitas took it away. What a burst of flavor. Service was excellent, friendly and quick. Overall a great experience, we will be back."}
{"text":"Tried the Blackened Chicken burrito and Ground Beef Taco. Both were good, not legendary. Burrito had plenty of well seasoned chicken, but still seemed small. It was sort of spicy, more like medium. Taco was on a decent flour tortilla, but nothing stood out and green sauce was kind of too spicy for a mild salsa. Crowded on saturday and Horchata was out of a machine, which is far from authentic Mexican."}
{"text":"Thank you Yelp for helping an out of towner find yummy Mexican food nearby. Steak Fajitas for 2 was good, affordable, good drinks. The waitress was super nice too!"}
{"text":"My whole team eats here at least once a week. Service is excellent and always friendly! Food is very authentic and always yummy. I highly recommend stopping in."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and inexpensive! We had a nice server and did not have to wait long for our food. Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch. There was 1 waitress waiting on table of a large family. She didn't acknowledge us. We sat a few minutes and decided to leave for a better atmosphere...."}
{"text":"This is one of my most favorite places to eat in Scottsdale.   Why? Because it's real, home style cooking and it's not expensive. For some reason (haha) it's really hard to find normal \"food\" that doesn't cost an arm and a leg. (Scottsdale rents $$$$$, I'm sure....)  BUT, these people have it DOWN! Perfect beans and rice. Warm chips and flavorful salsa (although it's more of a sauce, still, soooo good.)  The tacos are perfect: Size, stuffings, yeah... good stuff. Nothing is over done with sauces, it doesn't have to be. When good food is cooked right, it's good without all the extras that are nothing more than wasted calories.   They do have a bar, but I've never ordered anything more than a beer, so I'm not sure about cocktails.   Under $30 for two people, lots of really good food, chips, salsa and two beers is practically unheard of in Scottsdale. And while I'd love for this place to remain a hidden gem, the food, service and prices are just too good to remain a secret."}
{"text":"Great food, plenty of it, and an unbeatable price. Much better than Chipotle or Qdoba.  Location is in an inconvenient spot, but for food this good, totally worth it."}
{"text":"I drive for Uber and I gave the owner a ride a few months ago. Living in orange county I'd not sure where to eat in the Phoenix area so he recommended his restaurant. I'm happy to of been able to come here it is pretty good."}
{"text":"We visit Scottsdale for at least one week every year and for the first time investigated Habanero's. After our visit it will not be our last time eating in this excellent restaurant. Coming from Southern California we are well acquainted with Mexican cuisine, and used to \"hole in the wall\" or strip mall places. Habanero's is as good or better than anything I've had in the price range. I had the Parrillada combination of meats and all were fantastic. I tried my daughters ground beef burrito and it was very tasty as well. Great food, great value."}
{"text":"Mexican food fast!  And affordable!  And they actually have jamaica!    I had the chicken enchilada with green tomatillo sauce and a side of rice.   The portions were a little smaller than I'm used to seeing but the serving size was just enough to satisfy without over stuffing.  The price seems right for a dish this size.   The chicken had a nice seasoned flavor and the tortillas were good too.   The rice was a little dry and had that \"not so fresh\" kind of texture but was good none the less.  The salsas were good as well and had a little spicy heat and did taste fresh.   I'd give a solid three stars for this place but the fact they actually had jamaica made all the difference for me!"}
{"text":"Really good carnitas burrito. The habanero salsa had some good flavor but wasn't very spicy. Horchata was very tasty but too sweet."}
{"text":"Great tacos!  I'm in town for a day and found this place on yelp.  Friendly service, good food.  Make sure you get the habanero sauce, nice and spicy."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Habanero's Mexican Grill. I've tried pretty much every taco that they offer, and every single one of them is amazing. The lobster taco may be my favorite. Fresh, light, and full of flavor! The owner and staff are very friendly and helpful as well. If you're ever downtown, definitely give them a try!!"}
{"text":"I typically would give a place like this a three had they been open for a substantial amount of time but given this place is fairly new, I lent a little leeway.  I ordered the Kayla's Favorite with green sauce and chicken, overall the food was good, the rice was a little under-cooked but nothing a little tweaking can't fix.  Friend ordered the revoltura and it wasn't stellar (potatoes tasted odd), but what sold it for me was the moment he brought out the food, he realized my buddy asked for no sour cream on the side, turned back around and got it off the plate.  The food isn't anything to write home about but it'll stick to your ribs and keep you full for a bit"}
{"text":"This is a local, family business, the type we find has the best food and the friendliest people.  Everything is cooked to order, so it takes a little time. No microwave in sight. I was told some of the recipes were handed down from the Grandmother., a  lot of it seems to be Guadalajara, Jalisco dishes. I like the Calamari Tacos and Lobster Enchiladas. They don't have Lobster every day, usually Friday, and only if it looks good to them. There are a few breakfast items if you go in earlier. Everything I've tried here was good, and the staff is great!] The flan is also excellent for dessert."}
{"text":"Habanero's has excellent food and outstanding prices, making it one of my very favorite stops in Madison for a quick and delicious bite to eat. Service is friendly and Chipotle-style, and if you're like me you'll need some of pretty much EVERYTHING on your burrito! I love that Habanero's offers a local alternative to Chipotle (shop local eat local people!) and I love LOVE that they use local and organic ingredients in their food. If I were an octopus, I'd give Habanero's eight tentacles up... but alas, I am a mere human with cravings for good Mexican food, so I'll have to settle with two thumbs up. ;)"}
{"text":"I just have to say that the carnitas was fantastic!! Everything else was good too along with a cold Mexican beer there is No complaints. The owner was very friendly and a little known fact is that some of the bad reviews about this place are rival mexican restaurants nearby so don't trust them.."}
{"text":"Muy Bueno!! The best authentic Mexican food ever.  I am from old Mexico and i missed the food, the flavors, the aroma, and of course the love in the food.  Habanero's you guys hit a homerun!"}
{"text":"I've been back several times and I'm still loving Habaneros!  Their green salsa is to die for.  Although I tend to order the same things, I've tried several different items and have enjoyed everything.  I especially like that the kitchen is open so you can see your food being prepared. Oh, and the green salsa?  Awesome!  I know I said that before, but it bears repeating."}
{"text":"Wow we had great meal and very reasonable prices- margaritas were good but would have preferred a more traditional glass.  Highly recommend this little \"hole in the wall\" place.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Good food , great costumer service and good prices what else can you ask for. I've been to Habanero's a hand full of times and every time it's been a great experience! Food is cooked fresh and the wait isn't very long. I strongly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Their menu is simple and the topping are fresh and authentic. I wish they hand make their tortilla. I had 3 tacos. 2 steak and 1 spicy pork. For $6, it was so filling. U can't bet the  price. My go to Mexican place in the north side."}
{"text":"We're 'regulars' and we have to get our calamari taco fix often.  Never disappointed!  Sometimes we'll mix up what we order to try other (delicious) items.  But we keep going back for their excellent calamari tacos!"}
{"text":"Fish tacos are oh so amazing!!!  I have to eat here at least once a week. The food is fresh. The prices are fair. The guys are great. Everything I've tried has been excellent! I love the habanero salsa too- nice and hot!  Look, some people complain that they wait too long for their food to be prepared. If you want FAST food then try Burger King down the road. I'll wait 10 minutes for my fresh food.  As far as service... they are all so friendly! I always have a great time here!"}
{"text":"A favorite in our office.  It's easy to miss this place if you're not looking. It's kind of in a weird spot, at the end of a building that houses other businesses. But it's so worth it.  No frills, no BS and a limited menu compared to other Mex joints, but don't let that stop you! This place is fantastic. Burritos, nachos, tacos, quesadillas - it's all good. The spicy pork is a favorite and not like anything I've had at other Mexican restaurants.  It's sort of like a Qdoba or Chipotle set up where you go through and \"build\" your item to order.  They also do fantastic catering! And to top it off, it's cheap. Like crazy cheap. Like you think it can't possibly be as good as it is for that cheap."}
{"text":"Decent tacos although the chicken is an unusual shade of orange, but it tasted fine. There was a pair of grumpy guys working behind the counter. Wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, but it certainly is solid enough if I worked nearby."}
{"text":"Great find, off the beaten path and tucked in behind a Jimmy John's. Great food and fast friendly service! Shrimp taco was super tasty and the verde salsa was great!"}
{"text":"Came in for dinner on Saturday and the food was really bad. I am surprised at all the good reviews. My cheese enchiladas were served lukewarm, and the cheese on the inside was still cold and not melted. To make it worse, the enchilada sauce was bland. The black beans were bland. No reason to come back."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch yesterday and the food was pretty good.   You walk up to the front and put in your order and then go find a table. We came here before noon and it was pretty busy. It actually died down after noon. It takes about 10 minutes or so (maybe more) for your food to come to your table so don't come here if you're in a rush.   Some of the orders come with beans and rice and others with just chips. And they bring a green and red salsa to your table. I had a carne asada burrito with chips and it was just enough to fill me up. My boyfriend's enchilada meal came with rice and beans. The horchata was pretty good (I've had the homemade stuff and nothing compares), but not as good as the ones you can get from a Betos place.   The guy taking orders said their carnitas and blackened chicken were their specialties so I'll have to try one of those next time I stop by."}
{"text":"They have the best shrimp tacos ever! First time here and I loved it. Service was fast and friendly. Prices were reasonable. The Cajun shrimp tacos are the best tacos I've ever had. The guacamole was amazing too!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I almost always get a burrito, but have had their tacos too. Everything is delicious and fresh. Most of the time, I order to-go, but have also eaten in. I've also done larger orders for work, 10-15 separate items (they have a PDF on their website you can download, print, and fill out. I just hand it to them and they make the order in no time). It's similar to a Chipotle or Qdoba, but is authentic and actually slightly less cost-wise. They are super fast, but don't let that pressure you if you're indecisive like me :)"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I had during my Arizona trip.  Warning, if you ask for your food spicy it will be super-spicy.    Zero ambiance, just excellent cheap Mexican food."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely amazing and so is the staff! The breakfast burrito is one of my favorite things but there tacos and regular burritos are also amazing. I have never been disappointed with the food here. Even the fish tacos are amazing. The only thing that is missing is the Mexican rice and re fried beans. They have rice and beans but i like a more creamy re-fried bean almost like a dip."}
{"text":"This place is great, the staff always do the best they can to suit your needs. They are very friendly and they make good food. They keep upgrading small things here and there and it's exciting to see what they come up with next. I am a regular customer."}
{"text":"I love it here! It reminds me of authentic little restaurants in Mexico. No frills, no fancy decor. The food and service is delightful. We started off with my favorite beer drink, a \"michelada.\" The bartender was not in that evening but the waitress made us a  VERY tastey one. We started off with the chicken nachos. Yum! My sis in law and I shared the Parilla dinner. We didn't want the carnitas or chorizo and had them replace it with shrimp.y husband had the chicken salad and enjoyed it. They know how to season and cook their meat! I am definitely returning!"}
{"text":"Very good food. I go there once a week and love it. Steak burrito you can't go wrong. They are big and for 650 they blow away qdoba and chipotle away."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for the first time today.  Had the taco platter with a side of rice and beans and a horchata. Thought it was good and authentic.   It was fast and there was a variety of meat to choose from.  Reminded me of La Bamba only without a drive thru and you get to see your food being made.  Would recommend and will be coming back."}
{"text":"Good lord I love this place.  So flavorful, not a thing I don't like.  Better than chipotle or qdoba!!!  Cheaper too!"}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time last week. I have been looking for good, fast mexican food in the area and this fits the bill.  We arrived at the peak lunch time and the line moved quickly. It was a little tricky finding a table outside, so we reluctantly sat inside. Then one of the workers politely let us know an outdoor table had just opened up and we moved. The patio had a nice vibe to it.  I ordered the carne asada burrito, which was filled with pico de gallo and guacamole. Nice and simple, the way I like it. The meat was perfectly cooked and the guacamole was fantastic. My mom had the blackened chicken tacos, which I tried a bite of (they lived up to the hype!)  SOPAPILLAS: they are seriously the most addicting and delicious dessert out there but not many restaurants seem to have them. I was overjoyed when I spotted the handwritten sign for \"homemade sopapillas.\" For $3.50, you get 3 delicious fluffy pieces of fried dough covered in cinnamon and filled with honey.  Will definitely make this a regular lunch spot. Note: rice is $1 extra and chips and salsa cost $1.29. You do get a couple of chips with your burrito, but no salsa."}
{"text":"By far, the freshest, best tasting Mexican food around. I live on Mexican food and this is THE spot. Recommend the quesadilla with chipotle space and the taco salad with deep fried tortilla shell!"}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch last week, ordered 3 carnitas tacos that were fantastic. Everything from the tortilla to the guacamole tasted incredibly fresh. The pork was tender and flavorful, also seemed like it was prepared same day. Food was prepared in an open kitchen and was made to order and served quickly. Will be back when I'm in the area"}
{"text":"mediocre- not amazing but not horrible! i actually didn't want to write a review to be totally honest but i checked in here and yelp wouldn't quit telling me to write a review. i finally caved just to remove the annoying reminder. you win, yelp, you win.   i've only been twice. not a fan of the carne asada but the chorizo, shredded pork and blakcened chicken is Ok. The price is fair and the people working have been super friendly both times."}
{"text":"This is a great find.  I have had some take out before and it was always pretty good.  My husband loves this place, so every time he is in the area, he offers to bring some dinner home.  I had a fajita burrito a couple of times.  They travel well.  About a week ago, we were in the area and it was dinner time.  He convinced me to come here.  I am glad, we had a good time.  We ordered steak fajitas and shrimp fajitas so we could sample both.  We also had the chips and salsa.  The food was fresh tasting and very flavorful.  The portions are very generous.  I will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Habanero's since they opened. They are the best and most authentic Mexican spot in the Scottsdale Airpark. The food is always delicious, they have great service, and great prices. They have two locations in Scottsdale now. The other one is on Scottsdale and Shea."}
{"text":"Folks in my office had been telling me about this place for a while so I finally decided to try them out...look up the phone number and dial and it rings....rings...rings...rings....FINALLY someone answered! Although it took a couple attempts (3rd call :p) when I got someone on the phone the service was super friendly!   When I went to grab my lunch, the place was packed and crazy so I had to wait  few for my order but the service was again super friendly and totally on top of things. I actually just sat there and watched their AMAZING grill cook do his thing (sounds weird but go watch, it's fun!)  Got the salad back to my office, oohed and ahhed at the presentation (sometimes, food is just PRETTY) and dug in-WOW! BEST grilled chicken EVER! Super juicy, fresh, flavor galore! Lettuce?.....ehhhh well it's all about the grilled chicken anyways :P  Aside from the phone difficulty at the start (can't fault a place for being popular/busy) my experience with this place was an \"A\" for sure.   Just make sure you have some time to order from this place :)"}
{"text":"I don't understand why this place isn't packed all the time. We walk up here for fabulous - and inexpensive, but not cheap - tacos. They load the tacos so full you have to knife and fork them.  I have always found the ingredients to be fresh. I'm not a huge fan of the chicken seasoning, but the other meats are good for the price point.   Menu is simple: burritos, quesadillas, tacos, salads, tortas and nachos. Even though the menu states a 3 taco order, you can actually order just one (which I think is plenty). I really like the choice of pinto beans instead of the traditional black.  The guacamole is fresh and the portion is generous - and no extra charge when it's part of a vegetarian item.  The thing I find most unique are the spicy onions that are a topping offering. I love spicy food and these definitely clear the sinuses.   Finally, I loathe cilantro, and I have a lot of control over the cilantro situation here. The only topping I won't add is the corn, which has a lot of cilantro mixed in. The rest of the toppings are either very light on it or don't have cilantro at all, but you can have it added to your dish to get your fix, if that's what you're into."}
{"text":"I love Mexican food!!! One of the first things I always try when I go to a new place is the Chiles Rellenos.  Its a great benchmark for the overall quality, \"tastyness\", and value of most everything on the menu.  Is the chili fresh and prepared well? (Hatch or not Hatch). Is the chili stuffed with a delectable Mexican cheese mix (or just  jack cheese)? What kind of batter? egg? breading?  (One place I went had a deep fried, crumpled saltine cracker crust that was surprisingly good). Are sides included?  Habanero's Chiles Rellenos wasn't all that great.  Far to many seeds left in the chili for my taste.  Just melted jack on the inside.  Mostly egg battered outside (not very thick).  I don't think the chili was roasted in any special way or given any other kind of seasoning...Overall it was Meh.  The chili came with a side of beans that were authentic yet a little boring.  Also included:  A little Spanish rice (also boring).  Pico was yucky.  They are very generous with the sour cream.  (I noticed that sour cream and guacamole are included in most dishes so you don't have to pay extra).  Cool."}
{"text":"Great tacos, great people!  Love this place!"}
{"text":"I stumbled across this place by accident and it turned out pretty well for me. This place is authentic Mexican food! Prices aren't an arm and a leg.   The whole layout was awesome. It gave it a special kind of feel. The bathrooms were kept up to date and clean. All the workers and even the owner were polite and offered great customer service. I was in there around 9:30 am so I decided to go with a chorizo breakfast burrito. It was a pretty big burrito and it sure was delicious!!   I didn't get to sit down and eat; I ordered my food to go because I had some running around left today. I sure will be back again! I highly recommend it! It's definitely worth the drive!   This ends my review for now. I give this place a 5 star and I highly recommend it! For breakfast, lunch, and even dinner."}
{"text":"This place is great.  You come in for a burrito and leave fully satisfied.  All of the food is fresh- which you've gotta appreciate!!  I highly recommend the fajita burrito or their guac.  Yum :)"}
{"text":"The food was so delicious and the customer service topped it. Everyone was so friendly and attentive. The food was so good that I was full and wanted to keep eating. If you haven't been here, please try it out! The owner is very attentive with the customers as well and you don't get that at other places!"}
{"text":"Had the 2 person platter for $20 and it was worth it. It came with chorizo, grilled chicken, shredded beef, carne asada and grilled veggies. The side of rice and beans was delicious and the corn tortillas were tasty (they also offer flour tortillas). They had horchata but I did not try it. A good authentic Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Tried blacken shrimp and a lobster taco. You get your money's worth and it's delicious! Can't wait to go back and try everything else. A must try and of course they will be busy during lunch time, very friendly employees."}
{"text":"Excellent food! It was the hubby and I's first time here. We both had tacos, I would highly recommend the corn tortillas, they are great! The restaurant is very clean and the severs are really nice. Great prices overall, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Went with a group of friends from work for lunch. They were packed, but we managed to get a table.  Service was good and friendly. My carnitas burrito was a bit plain and expensive for what I got. Overall, a bit disappointed."}
{"text":"Blackened chicken tacos and carnitas are fabulous, will definitely be coming back.  Very friendly service, nothing fancy, just great food!"}
{"text":"Don't judge a book by its cover. Inside is clean and roomy and the food is great. Very fresh and delicious. The people there are friendly too. So glad I checked yelp for a place to eat here in Madison, WI.  My steak tacos were terrific. Muy Bueno!"}
{"text":"This place is a nice surprise for the size of it. When we walked in I was under the impression it's and order and sit type place. BUT it is actually a sit and be served! I was so happy for that. We ordered chips and salsa: I'm not a big fan of Green Salsa but theirs was pretty good!. Hubs got a Carne Asada Burrito which he devoured. I got the same with Enchilada style. And devoured.  They do have a bar which was interesting. Hubs ordered a Michilada which he liked. But of course I could not give a 5th star because there is a Victoria sign which we thought they would have that beer but they did not. Other than that I would come back when I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Visited Habanero's for lunch yesterday and it was awesome! I had the Carnitas tacos - great flavor, fresh made guac and pico - YUM! My husband had a steak quesadilla and love it too. The service was fast and friendly. We will definitely go back.   Our only complaint is the chips and salsa - the chips are great, but both of the regular red and green salsa's were really mild for our taste - still great flavor though. Will try the spicy version next time we go."}
{"text":"The food here is excellent and I love going there. The only problem I seem to always have is with the kid's menu. I realize this is a mexican place, but my daughter will only eat chicken fingers and fries when we're there. The fries are always undercooked and greasy and the last time, the fryer was closed down.  I got her a plain chicken taco. Basically, she had no dinner that night.  The staff is always super friendly and I want to eat there every day, but the kids options can be a little tricky."}
{"text":"Blackened chicken tacos & carnitas tacos are my extreme favorite . Add cabbage & green sauce to both & its a date ."}
{"text":"I completely have to thank Yelp for this one. I work around the Scottsdale Airpark and I didn't even know this place existed until I did a little Yelping. The food is definitely on point with what the other reviews are saying, and I was very pleased.  When I got there for lunch, there was a line to the door. I was grateful though because I had no idea what to order. I'm serious too because that usually doesn't happen to me at a Mexican restaurant. Their special sounded great as did pretty much everything else. I decided to go with the delicious sounding blackened chicken burrito and an order of chips and salsa (kind of a must for me at a new Mexican place). The chips were pretty standard, but crispy and yummy, and the salsas were great! We were given a verde, a regular (red with lots of pepper flavor) and their version of a spicy salsa. I believe the latter had habaneros in it; it lacked a little in flavor but definitely packed a little bite. Overall the salsas were very good; I even threw some on my burrito. Speaking of that, the burrito was great! It wasn't filling like any of the Berto places, but instead, just right. In other words, I didn't feel too guilty about it. The chicken was awesome and the other fillings (rice, pico and chipotle sauce) brought it all together very nicely.  I've for sure added this place to my list of lunch spots. I can see why it gets great reviews, but I can also see why people are hesitant to boast about it. It's a well-kept secret tucked away in the depths of North Scottsdale that is becoming less of one day after day."}
{"text":"This place was a winner, and I'm embarrassed to say I just found out it existed even though it's apparently been in business over 10 years! We drove by it the other day and then I looked it up on Yelp - so we were back for a quick dinner that night. Both my husband and myself just got a burrito - talk about bang for your buck! $6 with all the fixings, and it was seriously as thick as my upper arm....we already both agreed next time we would split one. I officially have no excuse to hit up a Taco Bell/Taco John's drive through ever again."}
{"text":"A great little hole-in-the-wall for a quick, affordable lunch. Gets pretty busy around noon, but if you're in around 11:45 you'll be fine.   I was trying to be healthy and ordered the Chicken Taco Salad - it ended up being served in a fried tortilla bowl so big I could have worn it as a hat! Everything in it was delicious, but this is definitely not something I could order every day. Burritos, on the other hand, ran a bit small but were still tasty.   This wasn't exactly what I'm looking for in a daily lunch spot, but the food was solid, the service was friendly, and the prices were decent. There's some seating, but you may be better off taking it to go if things are busy.   +1 for fountain drink Horchata! :-)"}
{"text":"Quaint, authentic, wonderful little Mexican diner.  Outside or inside seating.  Bathrooms were clean. Food had a nice blend of spices and green and red sauces were lovely.  I had a very nice time here.  You can get in and out quick or you can relax and enjoy.  I sat in the patio and it was clean no bugs or flys ."}
{"text":"This was a great find. We were overwhelmed with the menu. We got the chorizo and carne nachos, the special of the day shrimp Mexicana, and two tacos. All was great! Service was great and they had beer wine etc.    The Habanero salsa was screaming and the tortilla's fresh and homemade. Boy I wish we could get this kind of Mexican at home! PS Cheap too!"}
{"text":"Great guys. Authentic food. Good prices. Get the carnitas w/ a cold Horchata and you'll be a happy camper."}
{"text":"Great place for happy hour!  Order the house margarita and chicken taco for sure!"}
{"text":"I had high expectations for this Mexican restaurant since the Yelp reviews were all quite positive.  We enjoyed some chips and salsa to start and then I ordered the cheese enchiladas for my dinner.  Honestly, the portion was pretty small and there was nothing special about these enchiladas.  Hoping that I just ordered the wrong thing and this place does well otherwise, but I'll get my Mexican fix elsewhere!"}
{"text":"The food was good and the service was excellent. The salsa though was not as spicy as expected"}
{"text":"Food is great. I wouldn't say it's the best Mexican food but it's pretty darn good. I wish they would be a little less stingy on their salsa. Always seems like it's a struggle to get it or like it's somewhat of a bother when u ask for multiple types of salsa. They should just put it out so we can grab our own if it's too time consuming for them."}
{"text":"Our first visit to this Habanero's location, in a strip mall near the Scottsdale Gun Club.  We opted to go with the table service although you can also choose to order at the counter fast-food style. Our server was friendly, helpful and attentive.   You pay $1.29 for a basket of chips and 3 salsas which is a reasonable price for the quantity you receive, but they are just room temperature chips from a bag and the salsas, although very tasty, were extremely thin in consistency. We didn't eat a whole lot of them because it was like dipping chips in bowls of soup broth.  The carnitas burrito and chicken fajita burrito that we ordered were outstanding. They were a fairly large size, piping hot, loaded with a generous portion of really flavorful, moist meat. We would not hesitate to order either one of those again.   Overall, a really pleasant experience!"}
{"text":"The quality of food here is EXCELLENT. The meats are fresh grilled, and the food is not greasy at all. Tacos are delicious and authentic. Nachos are light and tasty. Salads come with a healthy portion of grilled meat. Authentic Mexican beers wash it all down (for only a few bucks a pop!). So yummy. So clean. So friendly and welcoming. I love this place and will be coming back often."}
{"text":"Ordered take out from here, and was actually impressed! They were super quick and the food was really good. I had a blackened shrimp burrito with a delicious chipotle cream sauce as well as a lobster taco (I mean, how could one not order a taco with lobster in it right?) The blackened shrimp burrito came with a side of chips and was everything I was looking for in a lunch. The lobster taco was also delicious, and the lobster was cooked perfectly.  I'm thinking of ordering here for a large group order for work in the future, just because I think it would go over really well! The only thing I wish (as someone who works in the area) is that they delivered, but honestly I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Some of the best Mexican I've had. Had the Parrillada Tampiquena...excellent. So good we're coming back for breakfast."}
{"text":"Habaneros is always one of our favorite quick stops for lunch or dinner!  They have really flavorful meats and salsas and fast service.  I usually make a burrito bowl the steak with the steak and you can't go wrong.  This place definitely rivals Qdoba or Chipotle but does have a few less options but they aren't needed here.  Out of the three locations, this one is definitely my favorite!"}
{"text":"The food is excellent. Blackened fish and ground beef tacos were very flavorful and filling. Steak fajita was well seasoned. Steak  was tender and juicy. Tortillas were hot and lightly steamed. Chicken quesadillas were meaty and not dry. Service was excellent. Very friendly and accommodating staff. Will definitely eat hear again when back in the area."}
{"text":"Had the blacked shrimp and fish tacos and the chile rellenos both were outstanding as were the Margeritas.  A must eat casual Mexican place in north scottsdale."}
{"text":"Just can't go wrong here, the food quality is fresh and just tastes great. For me they have the best tacos in the area. I've tried other spots within a few miles and they are not nearly as good and genealogy charge more. 5 stars."}
{"text":"Currently enjoying my first meal here. I'm a simple eater and chose the bean and cheese burrito; simple but delicious! Only thing I found a little weird was the plates. They were a little kiddish but no matter this is definitely a nice joint to eat at!"}
{"text":"I come here for lunch almost every day. Great lunch specials and great tasting food. I've had almost everything. Some of my favorites would be the Mahi Mahi Tacos, Blacked shrimp or chicken burritos are loaded and bomb. Today I ordered the blacked shrimp and steak quesadilla. It was off the roof. They usually rotate a lot of tequilas, which is good cause they know their tequilas. Make sure to stop by and check it out. And if you are getting off work and have some time, the HABANERO TEQUILA SHOT IS A MUST HAVE! I get it every Saturday after work ."}
{"text":"I try to go here at least once every 2 weeks for lunch. Amazing food and customer service.  Highly recommend the carnitas burrito!"}
{"text":"Once again the best. All the employees are happy and helpful. The blackened chicken burrito with green sauce was awesome!!  We love this place"}
{"text":"One of the few places where you don't have to pay 10 bucks to enjoy lunch. The food here is pretty good and the service is nice and friendly. Give this place a try if you're a local and looking for mexican food."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp and it did not disappoint!  We had chicken fajitas for two, perfect serving size, chicken seasoned nicely and tender.  Service was great, margaritas were tasty and other guests were friendly and happy to be there.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Well, I have to say that I am not fast food eater and I like to seat and read menu, and service of course . Stopped here right after celebration New Year, I was hungry. It looks like fast food, you must order at a counter, but full bar & serve to table. I ordered fajitas with two eggs in top, no problem! Food was soooooo delusionsssssssssss , eggs great, chicken great, veggies just right ... not over cooked , not undercooked! With margaritas! Let new year get started !!!!!!"}
{"text":"First let me compliment the friendly and helpful staff, they were very welcoming. Second, the carne asada tacos my spouse and I ordered were just okay. The meat was a little tough and lacked flavor. I had high hopes for Habanero's. I love Mexican food and they're relatively close to my house. I wanted to love the food, but I didn't. I will continue my quest for a phenomenal mexican eatery in Scottsdale, hell, I will even settle for a hole in the wall in Phoenix as long as the food is GOOD."}
{"text":"Service is amazing, the most friendly people work here. Plus a mini bar on top of awesome Mexican food?! Orale! Micheladas and street tacos go together like peanut butter and jelly, rice and beans, peas and carrots... You catch my drift"}
{"text":"I have been to Habanero's 3 times now in less than a month. It helps that it's conveniently located close to my office. The first time we went there, it was a suggestion by one of my colleagues. We got there at 2:00pm. It was quiet. We were asked to sit and was given the menus. My colleague had been there many times before so she recommended that I order the Carne Asada Burrito. We were asked if we would like chips and salsa with or without guacamole and we said yes & with. We were served a basket of colored chips and two salsas, green and red and the guacamole. We really enjoyed the green salsa, red not so much. The guacamole was superb! Very fresh, I loved it.   Our food was served pretty quickly. It was a Tuesday so we also were offered our \"company discount\" which we weren't aware of! I think the waitress who works there recognized either our badges or car tag, she guessed where we worked herself! 20% off an already reasonably priced meal, that was great! We decided we'll definitely be back again and that's exactly what I have done twice already.   My second time there was with my husband on one of our days off during the week. We ordered the steak fajita for two. I expected the fajita to come on a sizzling plate. It did not but, it was pretty good. At the end of our meal, we were asked if we would like to have dessert and we initially said no, but then I could not resist Flan! The waitress said it would be home made, delicious, and the best in town. I had to say yes to Flan! Who would say no??? I tried it and for someone who has had lots of Flan in the past, this was indeed Delicious!! It was so yummy I beat my husband and finished most of it alone, lol!   My third time there was yesterday. This time we were there at around 1:20pm. Honestly, since we only have an hour break for lunch, this wasn't the best time to be there. With it being such a popular place around a business area, it was packed! We had to order at the cashier and then take a seat. Our food still came out in a reasonable amount of time but since the line was quite long when we were ordering, we had to rush through our food. And yes I ordered Flan to go!   Definitely a great spot to have lunch or dinner. I strongly recommend the Flan if you're a Flan fan! Great service and good food for a reasonable price. We have just become regulars!"}
{"text":"Really amazing food. Caritas were perfectly cooked and the service was crazy quick and with a smile. Carne asada burrito was also perfection. I could eat here every day. Also affordable.  Highly recommended"}
{"text":"I have been a customer at Habanero's since the joint opened. The food is delicious, they have a great menu, and the staff is friendly.   Another great aspect of Habanero's is that they cater. Their mini-chimis are a great alternative to wings on Superbowl Sunday.  My personal favorite dish is the buenos nachos. Authentic? Nope, but it's really delicious. Their fish tacos and carne asada burritos are also great."}
{"text":"Great find! Don't let the mini-mall outward appearence deter you!   Went here for lunch with our employees, almost decided not to because from the outward appearence it doesn't look special.  Its VERY authentic food, which is big for me because there are a ton of super-americanized mexican restaurants in Scottsdale. This is the real deal...  I got the Carne Asada Burrito and it was excellent. Then after finishing , the waitress was so kind and brought out some free blackened chicken tacos and they were also spectacular she mentioned that was their specialty.  Great service, great food, great prices... Secretive and decieving location...  Try it out you wont be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Sadly it's just OK.  I ordered the parrillada.  The chicken and steak were dry and for an extra $2 I got 3  tiny little shrimp.  Steak was also chewy.  The people are nice but they're stingy.  My meal was $14 plus $6 wine and they charged me .50c for a bit of lettuce and .50c for a bit of diced tomato.  NEVER seen that at any MX place, anywhere. They need to focus on the food. We spent $40 and let disappointed."}
{"text":"Good food, friendly staff. Blackened Chicken Burrito Was very good. Fast service as well. I would go back."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast.  Had a burrito and DH had the scramble with chorizo.  Both made to order.  Fresh ingredients and spicy red and green salsa.  Always friendly service."}
{"text":"Family owned with two locations in the valley (I think), this is probably the best Mexican spot in north Scottsdale. The space is small, and it caters mostly to folks who work in the area. The food is fresh, and the staff is extremely friendly and focused on ensuring you have an awesome meal.  I had the carnitas Jalisco, which is a pork based dish. It was what I would expect out of a home kitchen! Must go if you're in the area."}
{"text":"We wanted authentic Mexican food and this place had high ratings.  It was located a few blocks from Downtown Phoenix with a moderately-sized parking lot. You can dine inside with tableside service or you can call ahead and pick up as evidenced by the pick up only parking spaces at the entrance.  Upon entry, you are able to view the kitchen area in plain sight, there are several tables that you can sit at and if small bar in the corner. The music was good & made me want to dance (LOL);  but must have been on a loop as we heard it twice in the hour we were eating dinner.  We made it just in time to enjoy the last 5 minutes of happy hour. I selected a traditional margarita that was surprisingly tasty and not too tangy.  The hubby got a Corona. The kids each got horchatas that were really good and appeared to have free refills.  The bathrooms: are locked as they are for customers only per a sign on each bathroom.  The women's bathroom bathroom was very clean and well-stocked with real toilet paper and not the rough commercial toilet paper. :-)  The food/meals: The kids shared a bean burrito that was made out of real flour tortilla (approx. 14\") and not a thick Ameeican store bought one, the beans were tasty & they used white cheese which was great.  The hubby got carne asada nachos that came with three different types of tortilla chips (red spicy one, yellow corn & blue corn), pinto beans, pico de gallo, jalapeños, sour cream, white melted cheese & guacamole.  In an attempt to stay away from the carbs I ended up choosing something on the menu that was called a carne asada bowl.  Ultimately, it was not a bowl and was a cup of unsavory red rice topped with about 1/2 cup of equally unsavory carne asada, guacamole & pico de gallo that was served on the inner circle of a nine inch plate. I added some salt to give it a little bit more flavor and that helped a bit.  Total of $40... definitely not bad.   The service: we only saw two guys cooking in the back and a young woman who was our waitress. She appeared to speak mostly  Spanish but every now and then we would overhear her say something in English. She was extremely friendly and was patient with the kids."}
{"text":"We got the sampler plate and everything was delicious! ! The chorizo was super spicy. Staff was attentive."}
{"text":"I came by here from reading Yelp reviews and saw the Lobster Enchilada Special! I wasn't too hungry but needed some food in my system before a show.  I never had lobster enchiladas but it was amazing! They also had a habanero sauce which made the enchiladas taste much better! They also have happy hour from 3pm-6pm which would help quench your thirst.   I would definitely come back here for food when I'm in the area. You would have to order and pay prior to sitting but it all works out."}
{"text":"This is our family's favorite restaurant for a number of reasons.  First the food is very fresh and always consistent.  My kids get the blackened chicken nachos, which they crave at least once a week.  I typically order the blackened fish tacos, which are outstanding.  My husband recommends the blackened chicken tacos or burrito.  The guacamole is always fresh and delicious.  In addition, they have draft beer and margaritas.  The prices are very reasonable as well.  What more could you ask for!  We always have Gabby as our server.  She is super friendly and remembers exactly what we like to order!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing!!! Freshly cooked, just give them a little more time to cook or call ahead if your in a rush!"}
{"text":"Quick, clean and great tasting food. The staff greet you with warm welcomes upon entry and are eager to help throughout the dining experience. We came here on our lunch break from the gun range. Glad we did!"}
{"text":"Habanero's, Besame Mucho. That's a perfect theme song for this restaurant. I've been eating here for the last five years and I see it's been about 4 years since I last reviewed Habanero's.  This is a family owned restaurant in which they also opened up a location at Shea & Scottsdale Rd about 18 months ago. I've had just about everything on the menu and everything is delicious. If they don't have what you're looking for on the menu then just ask. They will cook it for you. Is your hot sauce too gringoized for you. Tell them to put more heat in it. No problema, gringo.  A few of my favorite dishes are the Carnitas Enchilada style. I couldn't tell you what enchilada style means, but I like it. This Burrito is packed full of carnitas meat and the  other goodies that you normally find in a burrito. Besame Mucho!  I also really like the Buenos Nachos with the carnitas. If you haven't picked up on this yet, I really love carnitas. These are basially nachos covered with cheese, cilantro, jalapenos, tomatoes, onions, refried beans and of course a generous dose of carnitas. I usually share this dish with my wife at lunch time. Besame Mucho!  My absolute favorite is the Parrillada. The menu board says 1-3 servings available. But since no one's willing to share in our family of four I order the Parrillada for four. Remember, if you don't see it on the menu, ask. This dish comes with Carnitas, Chicken, Steak and Chorizo along with home fry style potatoes, onions, tomatoes, hot peppers, beans, guacamole and sour cream. And don't forget the rice and tortillas. My wife always substitutes the beans with the rice. And the kids don't like the sour cream and guacamole so they leave that off their plates. So you can see how accommodating the staff is at Habanero's. Besame Mucho!  They also serve adult beverages which include Mexican Beer and drinks like Tequila, etc. The owner and his staff are really nice people and they serve you great food at an affordable price point. Try them out. Besame Mucho!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing and service is top notch. The prices are reasonable and serving size is decent. The food tastes fresh and full of flavor. The chips and salsa are also great. They have both indoor and outdoor seating along with a good selection of drinks. I would highly recommend and will definitely revisit when I am in town."}
{"text":"We were on a mission to find a good Mexican eatery in Scottsdale and we happened upon Havanero's Mexican Grill.  The guacamole is to die for.  I designed my own burrito stuffed with guac, cheese, black beans, cheese topped off with hot sauce.  My husband had soft tacos stuffed with pork and steak with rice and beans.  YUM!  Everything is FRESH and authentic.  The owner waited on us and was nothing but totally gracious and humorous, as well.  We came in at 8:55, not knowing they closed at 9:00.  We offered to leave and he would not hear of it!  He just got his liquor license and is very excited about that!  He made my husband two drinks, one was on the house!  This little delight is hidden amongst other businesses, so you have to search.  It is well worth the extra effort!"}
{"text":"Really good Mexican food.  Love the blackened fish tacos and the blackened chicken salad.  I usually judge Mexican food by their chips and salsa as well and I am always satisfied with both.  My husband and I tried their breakfast this past weekend and we were happy with that as well.  Very nice and friendly staff.  So nice to have good Mexican food that's not overpriced!!!"}
{"text":"I heard about this place often from my husband and son because it's a spot close to where they work and they love the food.  So we all went there tonight for dinner and I'm glad I finally got to try it.  I had the salad with blackened chicken and it was just the way I like it - Just a little cheese and beans and lots of really fresh greens, chicken and corn. I wasn't a fan of the vinaigrette dressing, so I was glad that I got it on the side and used some of the salsa that came with the chips instead for dressing, which was good.  The guys' dinners looked great, too.  Would go back for sure!"}
{"text":"Poor excuse for good Mexican food. The people cooking the food in the kitchen would never cook that food at home. I have gotten various burritos and other dishes. The meat is always flavorless and the dishes are bland. They need to learn how to use these novel things like SALT & PEPPER"}
{"text":"We had the absolute WORST food here today. EVERYTHING was stale and tasted awful. We both got the cheese enchiladas and it tasted like the tortillas were about 2 months old. The rice was hard as a rock and even the soda tasted terrible. CAUTION: STAY AWAY!!!! We totally just threw $20 down the drain!!"}
{"text":"I visited Habanero's on a Sunday afternoon with a party of four.   We were surprised how busy they were at that time and that's usually a good sign. Not so much this time though.   What we ordered:  two carne asada burros, one enchillada style.  One bean/cheese burro.  One carne asada taco and one carnitas taco.   1. We weren't really greeted when we came in, but people were waiting at the counter to order so we followed suit.  Turns out that you can also sit and they'll come and take your order.  It was very confusing and we weren't the only ones feeling this way. 2. We awaited over 30 minutes for our food!  That is not acceptable at a place like this.  They weren't THAT busy.   3. Those that say that the carne asada is the best they've had need to get out and try some other places.  It was some of the worst I've had.  There wasn't any real flavor in the meat and it was very tough.  There also was very little meat compared to the amount of other stuff they filled the burro with.   4. The \"enchillada style\" burro had something red (maybe enchillada sauce, who knows) smeared across the top (spritzed on may be a better term) and a dab of cheese.  Where I come from, enchillada style means it's swimming in sauce and melted cheese.  5. The carnitas taco was very good, but they REALLY skimp on the filling (as another review has also pointed out).   6. The carne asada taco was pathetic.  It was just a little carne asada meat covered in lettuce....and that's it.  No pico or sauce or tomato or avacado.   7. The beans in the bean burro were actually really good and seemed home made.  It could have used a little more salt, but I'm just being picky now.  8. The girls that brought out the food and cleaned up our plates were very friendly and they apologized more than once for the long wait.  They even provided a 15% coupon for next time.  Unfortunately, due to the quality and value of the food I won't be back."}
{"text":"I was on golf vacation and wanted some Latin food. I found this place on Yelp after coming from the golf store. I came around 3. The service was great and the food even better.  I had a small appetizer and 4 tacos. All made fresh to order."}
{"text":"Pros: Great food, Professional staff Cons: Slow service, Expensive drinks  On June 4th, I stopped by Habanero's on the corner of Butherus Dr and Northsight Blvd for some tacos. It was 2:00pm, and hoped I'd missed the lunch crowed. I wasn't expecting many people to be eating during that time. The line at the lunch counter was about five people deep when I walked up and another three people were waiting to pay at the register. I've heard this place could get busy, but this was a little too much of a wait for me.  Other than the wait, my experience at Habanero's Mexican Grill was positive. Again, the staff is friendly and tacos are great! This is the only reason I decided to wait out the line for a table. If you ever find yourself waiting and thinking about going somewhere else. Don't do it, tacos are worth the wait."}
{"text":"Habanero's is by far one of my favorite places to stop for a quick lunch (or dinner!). There is not anything on the menu that you can order that will not be amazing. I don't know how anyone can compare it to Chipolte or Qdoba, because I have never had anyone at either of those place make my food with actual fresh and authentic ingredients. Not to mention getting fresh horchata every time is something you won't find at chain places!"}
{"text":"Fast, friendly, no nonsense. Just going to agree with what everyone else is saying; if you want fresh ingredients and solid Mexican staples, this is the place. They've moved into the shopping center nearby and it's a great new spot. They even have horchata and specialty sodas too.  If you want expensive and unique blends of herbs and spices in your tacos, look elsewhere. Here you get your choice of essentials and exactly how you want them. My fiancé and I prefer to go meatless, and they're happy to sub in some extra beans for us; plus you can ask for less of things you don't want.  It's not a family sit-down place, more of a quick lunch or a dinner take-out option. They have plenty of seating available though if you can't wait to dig in."}
{"text":"This place is great!  Guacamole is fresh and tasty, tortillas are warm and soft - they even have horchatas - and its totally affordable.  WAY better (and more authentic) than Baja Fresh and other such chains.  Very friendly service.  Next time I want to try the chiles rellenos."}
{"text":"It is surprising that, notwithstanding our shared border, the majority of our Mexican food options are average or too similar.  Case in point is carnitas.  Many people offer them but few excel.    Carnitas, my friends, is the reason to visit.  The meat is succulent, has great flavor, and is cooked to create a great texture.  Everything is priced to please the lunch crowd.    A very solid operation worthy of Yelp praise."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this the last time I was in town and nobody wanted to go with me :) patience paid off, the food was very yummy! Definitely recommend the blackened chicken taco.  I also had the carne asada taco and it was very good.  The guac was fresh and the margarita was  just what I needed after work. Two of us ate for $21 total.  Great food, great prices, can't wait to go back :)"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, Habanero's kind of fell flat for me. As other reviews have stated, this is a build-your-own [blank] kind of Mexican restaurant, offering burritos, tacos, nachos, etc. They had a variety of burrito meat fillings, including two types of beef, two types of pork, and chicken.   I ordered the chicken filling, which is bright orange, and which I hoped indicated spiciness. In actuality, the chicken was incredibly bland, lacking both spice and flavor. Others at my table ordered burritos and burrito bowls with different fillings, like the spicy pork, but the consensus was generally the same: 0 seasoning whatsoever. This seems to extend to the beans and rice, not just the meat.   Honestly, you might as well just go to Chipotle. They may not be authentic or local, but they at least offer more flavorful food."}
{"text":"This place is seriously good.  It's kind of like a really good chipotle grill...but actually authentic!  The food is very fresh and flavorful.  The service (been there twice) was really nice.  The prices and portion size are GREAT.    The only downside, if it is a downside is that the clientele are VERY blue collar.  It is out of my way, but I will go here again and again and again!  Best Mexican in Madison!"}
{"text":"This place is the real deal.  Great food, prices are competitive with other places nearby.  If you're not a fan of the ingredients in the burritos then just order it the way you want it, they'll hook it up.  I haven't had a bad meal there yet and I try to make it out to this place for lunch every Friday.  Coke in the glass bottle, soo good.  My favorite item is the Carnitas Platter.  It's on the higher end cost-wise but is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"a prologue: dear yelp, why can't you give a zero-star rating? y u do dis?  i guess it's my fault. i guess i can only blame myself. but i mean, i read the yelp reviews, you know? four whole stars, and the reviews were generally pretty positive. oh, this is like chipotle? word? i love chipotle! but upon pulling into the gigantic and also very empty parking lot, i should have known. i should have known.  against all our better judgment, we walked in the door and they were packing up the ingredients at 8pm. is this place... closed? (no, they supposedly close at 9.) the habanero's employee had a bemused look on her face, like, \"humanoids! coming in here! what news do you bring?!\" (i mean, she was pleasant, i'll give that to habanero's.)  i got a burrito bowl (see: burrito styrofoam container). the employee spooned room temperature ingredients into my \"bowl\" (but not salsa, which i asked for and did not receive). i don't have any other word for it but \"sad\". i saw all these reviews calling the food \"really flavorful\" and \"fresh\" and i was so stoked to try this place, but that just wasn't my experience at all. couldn't have been further from that. the \"steak beef\" was basically non-existent, and all i could taste was white rice, corn, and store-bought guac. if that's what i wanted, i could have made that at home and saved myself the money, you feel me?  because i was hungry, i also ordered some chicken nachos. nachos -- who messes up nachos? even if the rest of the food was questionable, i figured that there was almost no way this could get mucked up. well, that was dumb of me to think that. the employee took a styrofoam container of chips and microwaved it, which, yo: i never asked for carcinogens with my nachos. we got some pico on there, a dollop of guac. we found out upon returning home with our food that there was no cheese on them -- i wasn't aware that you had to ask for cheese for nachos, i thought that was just a thing. even without the cheese as a bonding agent, the chips were soggy and gross and clumped together and just not desirable whatsoever, which no one has ever said about nachos. also, chicken shouldn't be that pink, brah. i'm not even talking like, not-cooked-all-the-way-through pink, because this chicken was quite dry. i mean, it was this weirdly bright, pepto bismol-esque kind of pink. we took two bites and noped out of there.  this place was awful. i have a gutter palate -- i mean, *disgusting* -- and was somehow still extraordinarily let down by this place. i wish so hard that i could have given this joint a zero-star rating. i wish i could say that it would make me feel better if i was reimbursed for the money i pissed away here. but even that doesn't do it for me. i'll never get that meal back. i would highly recommend people who like food and care about food never come here ever."}
{"text":"I was staying downtown for business and was looking for something decent to eat without breaking the bank. This place was perfect. Clean and welcoming, the service was friendly and quick. The food was amazing: chips and fresh guacamole to start and fajitas for two. Super delicious!"}
{"text":"Came in during the crazy taco Tuesday lunch hour and was impressed by the service and quality of the food. Great place to come for a Mexican food fixen. :)"}
{"text":"I have only been here one time but I am a fan and it was enough to get me to write a yelp review.  I had the chicken taco's and they were excellent.  I ordered three of them and had planned to eat two and bring the other home with me.  I didn't bring the other one home with me because I ate it.  The woman at the counter was very informative and friendly and the food was great.  I prices were the same as any other taco shop in the Phoenix area and the product was superb."}
{"text":"Combo burrito is extremely good. Spicy pork and beef happiness. People are extremely nice and no skimping here. No fake stuff here."}
{"text":"I was worried when I moved to this side of town and thought I was lost to all fast-casual burrito chains. Luckily I found Habanero's! Friendly service and yummy food. Basically a more authentic Qdoba with Tortas."}
{"text":"Great local Mexican food prepared on demand. They have small seating tables up front and a large seating area in the back."}
{"text":"Very Reasonably priced, huge portions, and great food!  Much preferred to the cookie-cutter chain restaurants.  Will return!"}
{"text":"You can never have enough fresh tasty Mexican places around.. even in north Scottsdale. Let me tell you, this place is very tasty! Everything is made right there in the open kitchen and if you sit at the bar you can see how fresh it all is.   The Mr and I were hungry so we ordered way to much food. We had no idea that the portions were so large. Started with the Parrillada Tampiquena for 2.. a huge sizzling platter of meaty goodness! Steak, chicken, carnitas and chorizo.. served with tortillas, rice, beans.. well you get the picture.. a mother load of food for 12.99.. this is enough for 2 healthy eaters. Me and the Mr being healthy eaters we continued to over gorge ourselves.. steak quesadilla and a carnitas burrito.. both were large and stuffed with tasty meat!   If you love some thick juicy meat like I do, this place is a perfect fit!!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a good Mexican restaurant and saw the reviews on Yelp for this place. The food was great and very reasonable prices. Only reason it got 4 stars is because the service was a little slow and the ordering process was confusing. We will definitely go back for the food."}
{"text":"I would actually give this a 4.5 if that was possible. They have very delicious authentic Mexican food. I love the Carnitas in the Carne asana is pretty good too. Sure some of the other reviews have mentioned the wait which isn't bad but it takes a little while to cook everything well, this is not fast food. I highly recommend habaneros. Please stop by and give them a try. Salsa is good and guacamole is excellent."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for a couple years now.  I actually discovered it on accident, and I am sure glad I did!  I am not a huge fan of Mexican restaurants, probably because non of them taste like this.  This seriously is the best Mexican food I have ever had!!!  Maybe because every order is cooked fresh and no matter what I order every bite has amazing flavor.  The costumer service has ALWAYS been amazing.  Everyone there is so nice.  I've sat down to eat and called in orders for pick up and they never fail in costumer service or the quality of their food.  My mouth is watering right now thinking about how good it is!    My bf and I have had a good majority of the menu, but our favorite is the blackened chicken tacos, blackened fish tacos, lobster tacos, and the absolute best taco that I actually discovered on accident (again),  I called in and ordered the fish tacos but something went wrong with what she asked me and I said yes, then I got home and of course my bf was pissed because they were not what we ordered.  BUT.....what we got were \"fried\" fish tacos in a \"fried\" flour shell with yummy tarter sauce, and some other good stuff.  My bf absolutely LOVES these now.  Which I LOVE these as well, but I can't or shouldn't eat \"fried\" all the time.    Anyway, if you haven't tried this place yet, I seriously suggest you do!!  You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this joint!  Great food, amazing family that owns and operates it.  Bonus:  one of the few places that the entire family agrees on. I have tried numerous menu items and have loved every one. This is a small restaurant in a strip mall, but it is one of the best local Mexican restaurants around. Try their takeout some time.  Just as good as eating it there!!!"}
{"text":"Good, basic Mexican diner. Great seafood taco selection."}
{"text":"Like a Mexican Subway, you get something and you add the ingredients! Tasty, filling, and inexpensive, if you have to work on that end of town, this would be a tasty place to go!"}
{"text":"Was traveling in Phoenix for a convention, and ate here twice. Food and service were amazing! Honestly 1000x better than any of the fancy places downtown that cater to the convention centers. This ended up being the best food I had the entire time I was visiting"}
{"text":"It was better than what I was expecting and that's a plus! First off, the map sent me to the wrong area and it took me a bit to find it, but it was worth it. I went on a Saturday night and it was pretty much empty aside from a few people grabbing takeout. It's pretty small and simple in there which I definitely liked!  We got chips and guac to start and it was delicious! The salsas were good as well. The habanero one was a bit too spicy for me but the others were good. I got a vegetarian burrito and was happy to see whole wheat tortillas were an option, so I had that! I was expecting the burrito to be small since it was only $5.50 so I got a side of rice and beans. Totally wasn't necessary, I ended up taking the rice and beans home! Our service was very fast too which was great since I was in a rush. Come here if you want lots of food for low prices. I totally wanted to try a margarita too but had to babysit after, so I will next time!"}
{"text":"Ordered two cheese enchiladas, which came with rice and beans. The beans tasted like water, which sucks, because that's the best part. Rice was also very bland and dry. Enchiladas were soggy- just unimpressed with my order. However, my friend loved her burrito, even though it was cut in half, like a wrap instead. Service was exceptional, hence the 3 stars...won't be back though, because of the food."}
{"text":"Cute and cozy restaurant in downtown Phoenix. The waitress was very friendly and told us to pick anywhere we would like to sit. Right away she took our drink orders and just as fast as she took it she brought them out. I love horchata and I had to try theirs it was good and refreshing. She also offered us chips and salsa and if we wanted to guac of course we said yes. When she brought them out she asked if we wanted to try their habanero salsa. How could we say no after all it's on their restaurant name! Holy moly it was spicy but yummy especially if you're a lover of all spicy things. I ordered the flauta plate and was able to do chicken and beef (i can be a bit indecisive). They were both really good, but for sure the beef were tastier. I was also able to choose from refried beans or black beans. I did the refried beans and I can tell they were homemade and not from a can. The rice was s but dry, but I tend to be picky with my rice because I make it at home a lot.   My friends ordered the Chile relleno and i had a taste and found it was quite tasty and not super spicy which is perfect for my liking. I'm not sure what cheese they used but it was delicious.   I want to come back to try some of their other plates and margaritas."}
{"text":"Our new favorite Mexican restaurant!  Food is fresh and delicious, service is very good.  Portion sizes are generous and prices are very reasonable.  We always order the buenos nachos."}
{"text":"Habaneros could be cool because it's Mexican American food seen through the lens of the Midwest, but it's got to fix a lot.  Positive #1: It's cheap I suppose cheapness is important to some people. When I rotate things through my everyday I definitely am concerned about cheapness, but it has to be good first. But if I were really concerned about being cheap I'd probably avoid fast food and do things like farmer's markets...  Positive #2: There are options Being picky is what makes me the discriminating diner that I am. But format isn't as important as, you know, flavor and taste. The difference between taco and burrito is minimal. One is more shareable. The other holds well. Neither is optimal. The burrito rolling technique leaves a lot to be desired.  Negative #1: It's not competitive I feel like the jerk who has to say it, but you have to. This place really can't compare to chain burrito joints. Staff at either popular chain both a) knows more about their product and b) is faster. I can't get excited about your product if you're not excited about your product.  Negative #2: It's not unique If the mechanics behind your chain aren't better than your competition, your product might as well offer something different. I'll stray from something great for something different merely because I'm interested.  Being more Madison or more Wisconsin or even just a little weird and better put together would make this place a lot more interesting."}
{"text":"Pricey, but very good, fast service. Food was fresh and tasted great! Worth going back."}
{"text":"Restaurant was clean, people were friendly. Had cheese enchiladas  and chili rellano delicious,  fresh .Had flan for deserts everything was fantastic, this is a must try place,  we will be back !!!!"}
{"text":"I think I had my expectations too high for amazing mind blowing Mexican food. While it was good, it wasn't knock your socks off good.  I started with chips, guac and salsa which is a solid deal at $3.99. It was pretty good, no complaints there, but just like most Mexican food I can get in NJ. I ordered the blackened chicken burrito, the chicken didn't really seam blackened. Overall it was kind of small, while I didn't expect Chipotle size, I expected something just a bit more.  The guy next to me at the small bar ordered tacos and they looked much better, I should have gone that route. Overall it was all A-OK, not bad, but not amazing.  The server was very friendly. This was a decent cheaper spot for lunch."}
{"text":"Great Eats and value! Not a fancy dining environment, but the awesome hot & fresh food overrule that! Try it!"}
{"text":"I used YELP to find a Mexican place with a good rating when we were in town. THANKS Yelpers! This place is awesome!!!!  Really cool gun place next door too."}
{"text":"I had the flautas and they were extremely bland and barely had any chicken in them. The chicken needed seasoning. I added salsa on top to give it some kind of flavoring. The margarita was pretty good though. Not my favorite Mexican in Scottsdale/Phoenix. There are much better places to get authentic Mexican."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. It's pretty unassuming, in a strip mall in North Scottsdale and pretty generic even once you get inside, but make no mistake: Habanero's is the real deal. The carnitas, as mentioned before are outstanding, as are the tortillas and salsas."}
{"text":"I was here for lunch the other day and had the blackened chicken combo plate.  It came with rice, black beans and three tortillas.  Everything was fresh and flavorful.  The service was friendly and I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Arturo is the owner of of this quiet little restaurant in the middle of a shopping mall right down the street from Costco on Hayden (1 block west of Northsight off Raintree). All his staff/cooks are family. We met Arturo when he was the caterer at a Super Bowl party, and he gave us his card announcing he would be opening up his new restaurant. Others may know him when he was the bartender at Maestro's on Pima.  He is getting a liquor license for the place. Many locals have discovered his gem. This is the way Mexican food should taste. It is authentic, good, and not pricey. Place is not fancy but perfect for this food. We've had them cater one of our parties too. Everyone raved about the food. He knows his stuff. Buenos Nachos with diced bits of carne asada and chunky chorizo is the only thing I order now. Try it and whatever specials they have going on and you'll be hooked too."}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican food for dine in or take out. We've been here a dozen times. Always on-point, prompt, and delicious."}
{"text":"I am a HUGE fan of this place! So, let's just say this place is not fancy.  It is tacos and burritos and the prices are great.  Honestly, it is hard to find a simple, traditional taco in Madison. This place satisfies all those needs.   The location is strange. It is in a strip mall on Stoughton. Kind of annoying to get to, BUT they are open SEVEN days a week. They are pretty quick and like I said the food is delicious and affordable."}
{"text":"OK, this was my first time at Habanero's today and I went with my co-workers. YUM!! I ordered the fajitas, steak, asked for extra onion and got it. Delicious, not salty like some of them are. came with tortillas, rice, guacamole and sour cream. So good. The place is busy so get there early for lunch. If you pay cash you get free chips and green and hot salsa. I will be back. Sit inside or outside, clean restaurant."}
{"text":"My sister and I are visiting AZ for a girls weekend. We decided on Habaneros because we wanted something local. This place was perfect. We dined on a Friday night. It was busy, but they easily seated the two of us without a wait. We asked the server for her recommendations and ultimately settled on the parrillada for two. It was delicious and so much food for under $20. We also ordered chips and guacamole. The guacamole was so creamy. I also had a margarita. It was big and surprisingly inexpensive. Our server was delightful and gave us the right amount of attention. I wish we lived closer because I would come here often."}
{"text":"Mediocre Mexican food.  The best pinto beans any can opener can offer up.  The Spanish rice is completely flavorless.  Nachos are decent with steak but get soggy entirely too fast with the pinto bean liquid.  Flautas are okay.  Red and green sauces are too mild and habanero sauce is too hot.  No happy medium."}
{"text":"Awesome little Mexican grill with great food at an awesome price with VERY friendly attentive staff!!  Even though it is designed for ordering at the counter and sitting wherever you want the staff made sure to not only bring our food to us but also to check several times to make sure we didn't need anything. Will definitely eat here again!!"}
{"text":"Yummy galore!  I go here to share the skillet platter..we get beef and chicken and it's so savory.  The meat is delicious because it just tastes fresh and not all greasy.  Most places rely on grease or lard to make their food taste good (gross) but here it's good as is!  Great pricing too!  The tortillas are yum. The rice is even good!  Just try it.  You'll enjoy the flavor!  Also- the employees are super nice!"}
{"text":"Habaneros is a solid, no nonsense taco joint. Quality ingredients and a lot of food for your money.  Despite several visits, I have to admit I've only had tacos, but I've tried most of the meats and other toppings. The spicy onions, I forget the name, are delicious and very spicy.   If you're on the north side and hungry, check it out!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place! Burritos and tacos are awesome! Our favorites are chicken and the pulled pork! Yummm! Also, the horchata is delicious!"}
{"text":"Found this spot and it was well worth it! The carnitas de Jalisco were excellent!!!! They were cooked just right. The flour tortillas are homemade. The service and staff were fast and friendly."}
{"text":"The food was good, but not my favorite in Phoenix so far. It was moderately priced. We had 2 burritos (one chicken and one shrimp) and chips, salsa, and guacamole. The fajita vegetables were a little too undercooked for me in my burrito but the shrimp was really good. The guacamole was delicious."}
{"text":"I only came in for the Orange bang... lol but since I'm a piggy decided to have a couple of tacos. They were delicious! Service is great and they have a full bar! I will definitely be back..."}
{"text":"It's like Chipotle, the local version. The spicy pork is great. Food is all a little salty and there isn't a water service that I can see (bottles of water and pop in a case, lemonade and horchata machines). But the food is really cheap (and if you only want one or two tacos, you don't have to get three). They really need to put out some bottles of Chula. No real hot sauce here. Also, they serve beer."}
{"text":"Well, it's no Pedro\"s, thankfully.   Went here to check out what the yelpers are talking about.  Got a burrito and a quesadilla.  Right off the bat you can tell that their meat is good just by looking at it.  I started with chicken just to be safe and now I wish I had tried the beef because it looked so darn good. The quesadilla was good but pretty simple.  The burrito was very good with great portions.  Everything was fresh. The outside looks like it's a pretty small place but inside it is pretty big and plenty of space for people to sit down and eat in.  Crummy location though. Will be back for some tacos and the tortas look fantastic.   Open kitchen so you can watch them cook your meal.  I like that."}
{"text":"From the fresh chips and superb guacamole to my large chicken fajita burrito and my wife's blackened chicken and mahi mahi tacos, we could not ask for a better, more affordable meal. We will definitely be returning and judging by the greetings other customers received, we will be just one of many, many return visitors."}
{"text":"I go here at least once a week.  Burrito bowl with steak is delicious!!  Fast and great prices."}
{"text":"So where can I find a taco in Madison that I can be proud to say is amazing....Habanero's! So to get started---a little hard to find. I have been driving past the location every day to and from work never noticing it next to the Pool/Spa store on Stoughton Rd. Silly me.  I finally took the chance after seeing the great neon lights in the window and stopped in.  You first order at the counter, and they have their operation set up like a \"build as you go\".  The choices are limited, but all the essentials (Taco, burrito, torta, or quesadilla). I suggest either the steak or chicken but you can also get barbacoa or carnitas. The tacos (if orders in corn) come in 2 shells each taco ordered.  After ordering then you and sent around the corner and you get to pick what you want on them.  Pico, corn, sour cream, great Mexican cheese, lettuce, guacamole, and a fine selection of salsas.  It's quick & convenient with ample seating.  Also, a fine selection of drinks and beers. What is not to love!  I recently went against my current taco order and had a burrito....huge! It was also a great choice.  If you order the extra meat for $2, you will be very happy. They pile it on, no matter what meat you decide to select.  Heck yes! Great pricing too.  3 tacos-$5.99 1 Burrito-$5.99 (cheaper and better than the other chain \"build as you order\" burrito joints)"}
{"text":"Tasty food, very affordable. Only downside are the plastic plates that are warped. Blackened shrimp taco was great, tho overpriced compared to other items on menu. Chicken chimichanga style was also pretty good. Overall 3/5.  Will be going back again soon."}
{"text":"Out of towners, used Yelp and we were very happy! We'll definitely have to come back when we visit the area again. Yummy burritos!"}
{"text":"Excellent lunch - blackened shrimp tacos - chips and salsa. Easy counter service made for quick in and out lunch."}
{"text":"Excellent and authentic Mexican food. Please ask for Norma. She provided the best service and loves her job."}
{"text":"Chunky fresh guacamole, great chips and for my first time, calamari tacos.  I also tried the blackened mahi- mahi fish tacos.  This is a fast food type of environment however each meal is prepared to order.  Fish was freshly grilled, guac was very fresh with large chunks of avocado and calamari tasted freshly fried.    For a drink I recommend trying the horchata which although it was from a fountain, tasted delicious.  If Yelp offered a 3.5 star I would have gone that way as although the offerings were a bit more unusual than most Mexican fast food places, it was just alright.  I round up to 4 for the effort in freshness and creative menu."}
{"text":"Food is super delicious here! The spicey pork tacos with extra hot sauce are my favorite!  Service is extremely fast and the workers are friendly.  I only gave this place a 4 instead of 5 stars because I think the place could be cleaner and updated.  Some of the decor look run down and look like DIY projects."}
{"text":"Hidden gem this side of the border.  Lunch is very yummy. We've eaten here several times and never disappointed. They are open for breakfast, lunch & dinner. Breakfast burritos are wonderful. I recommend the chorizo burrito, although all are delicious. The entire menu is wonderful and their homemade salsas compliment the fare.  The owner is super cool and always makes people feel right at home!"}
{"text":"You've got to check this place out!  Have the Parradilla, grilled steak, chicken and carnitas mixed with onions, potatoes and chorizo!  Your choice of tortillas and rice, beans, guac and sour cream... All just $12.99!  Friendly, happy people, great experience!"}
{"text":"Went there for breakfast, food was decent however, waited more than 30 minutes to receive our order with no apology or explanation. Not happy with service we received."}
{"text":"My husband discovered this place when he used to work on the east side (we live on the west side). He would come home all the time telling me about this amazing place he'd grab lunch sometimes, and I'd be all sorts of jealous because I love delicious food.  So one day he finally took me and WOW, he was right!   The building is nothing special - it's located in an industrial area and I would never have found it myself. Pretty dive-ish. Food is served in styrofoam containers. It's basically like Qdoba or Chipotle, but more authentic and more delicious. Price is cheap, you get a good amount of food, and have I mentioned yet that it's delicious?  They opened another Habanero's on the north side.... please open one on the west side!!! We don't get over to the east or the north very much. Hubby still ends up on the east side sometimes for work and always makes sure to snag a meal there, the lucky guy."}
{"text":"We live right next door to this place so we've been a few times now and it has always been on point.  I don't know what they put on their chicken but it is SO good.  It comes out really juicy, tender and full of flavor regardless of what chicken dish you order.  I haven't tried the carne asada yet but I imagine it is just as good. I also really enjoy their skinny margarita (not as sweet as the regular depending on your preference).  Their chips and salsa are also great and the staff have been really welcoming and helpful to us.  I also really like how they added an out door patio.  With how nice the weather is right now I'm sure it will get a lot of use. I look forward to keeping this as one of our regular go-to places!"}
{"text":"We were craving tacos and this place did not disappoint. Great authentic flavor. We will make this a regular stop."}
{"text":"Low Rent Mexican Food shop sitting in Scottsdale. It was my first time here and they were very helpful with my menu choice. I tried the habanero salsa and it was screaming hot, had to mix it with the \"mild\" stuff!!!!  Loved the 4 different kinds of colored chips. Took too long to prepare lunch on a slow day. Very small place. PRICEY!!! I couldn't keep my plate from spinning making it difficult to cut my food. Beef was a bit chewy. Tortillas were thick & dried out hard before I finished eating. Chips & salsa cost extra!!! They don't mention you get chips on your plate already. (Hidden expense) And they want a TIP too????!!!!"}
{"text":"Blackened fish & blackened shrimp tacos almost as great as their black beans and habanero salsa. Parrillada combo was amazing. Shrimp was spot-on."}
{"text":"Found this restaurant on Yelp when we needed to get something without getting too far off our route. This was a great find! Our very busy hostess/waitress was doing everything but cook the food with a quick step and a smile. She was a joy to watch! Even my two children recognized how good she was. The food was delicious too. We were very glad we chose this place!"}
{"text":"Went in with a buddy.  I ordered three different kinds of tacos, Carne Asada, Carnitas, and Shrimp; and some chips and salsa.   The tacos were good, but I especially liked the Shrimp one.  When we came in, we thought we had to order at the counter, so we were rather rushed....didn't get a good chance to look at the options.  After we sat down, we noticed some new people coming in and getting a menu.  I would have liked to have done that so I could have picked something else out."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE....my mom and i cleaned up three taco plates, shrimp, carnitas and lobster, plus blackened chicken nachos and chips and guac all for about $30.    Love supporting local family run and owned shops and this is no excpetion, the owner/chef came out to see how our food was and a discussion ensued.  who doesn't love duiscussing good food with another foodie/chef?   Can't wait to go back for the shrimp tacos and anything Carnitas!  MUST TRY yelpers!!!"}
{"text":"Came in with my staff and we all really enjoyed the food. I ate the enchilada plate with beef and cheese. The beans and rice were also very good margarita was also very tasty. Very relaxed place."}
{"text":"Habanero's is a fast casual restaurant that offers Mexican food for a $1 less than Chipotle. Interested? Read on.  I forgot to take a picture of the menu, so I'll explain it right here: You can pick between burrito, burrito bowl, quesadilla, tacos, salads, tortas, or nachos. They have five different meat options: steak beef (carne asada), shredded beef (barbacoa), spicy pork (al pastor), pull pork (carnitas), and chicken (I don't know a spanish term for this preparation of chicken). They also had $2 tamales that were not on the menu last time I was there, so ask about that if you want one.  I've had a burrito and a taco order there before. Personally, I prefer the tacos because you can get a different meat in each of your three tacos, and they don't skimp either.  Overall, I'm a fan of Habanero's. I find that their meats taste better than Chipotle's meats even if it's been in the warmer for a while. Their salsas aren't as good as Chipotle's, but look at that variety in menu options! Plus, their tacos are jam packed. I'll be back the next time I want some quick tacos."}
{"text":"Directed to this place by Yelp reviews. Cute casual atmosphere with good menu. Good service even though there was only one server covering the restaurant and bar. My husband and I are vegetarians so my expectations were moderated by reviews of a place touting carne asada and lobster quesadillas. I had a veggie burrito and guacamole which were very good. The salsa was average and my pet peeve is water served in styrofoam cups which doesn't degrade in landfills. If you're washing plates, you can wash water glasses. Overall, I'd recommend."}
{"text":"Great fast food mexican restaurant. Since there aren't any Filiberto's out this way, this is definitely the next best choice if you live nearby."}
{"text":"I had a carnitas burrito. Excellent. Great salsa\"s, nice walk up service counter with pleasant and helpful young lady! Check out the nacho\"s"}
{"text":"I was so hungry for lunch and I wanted Mexican food that was quick and easy so I found this place nearby. It took some time to figure out how to get here because the airpark was in the way but when I finally arrived, I found that the restaurant was in a shopping plaza with tons of parking. I parked and waited in line. I ordered a lobster and blackened shrimp taco on corn tortilla with a side of rice. My order came to $8.  I decided to just devour my food there and so I sat down and waited. The employees are really friendly. They came by and asked if I was ok, they gave me salsa and when I was done, they thanked me for coming it. It was refreshing because lately, the service in the restaurants I've been dining at lately haven't been great.   Let's get to the food - it was pretty delicious! I wish there was a little bit more meat but tasty nonetheless. I practically didn't leave much on my plate and for less than $10, definitely worth it!!! I'll be a returning customer for sure!"}
{"text":"Another awesome Mexican restaurant within a couple of miles of our house....this place is pretty awesome.  I don't know why it took me so long to try it out....perhaps because it's kind of tucked away out of sight in a shopping mall that doesn't generally get a lot of traffic...?  I don't know....but one thing I do know is that it's no on my radar and I will be back many times.  Here's my Son and I had on our first visit:  Carnitas de Jalisco, $9.99 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/habaneros-mexican-grill-scottsdale?select=hs9izE2KQH42bIhX2k2tPw#hs9izE2KQH42bIhX2k2tPw http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/habaneros-mexican-grill-scottsdale?select=873KJQLaeB5FKuPMB3jC8Q#873KJQLaeB5FKuPMB3jC8Q http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/habaneros-mexican-grill-scottsdale?select=yewf-V6M-eviSlnMFN_klg#yewf-V6M-eviSlnMFN_klg  Buenos Nachos w/Ground Beef, $6.50 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/habaneros-mexican-grill-scottsdale?select=ZLUrrPL1RDSqhkQvkzRmtw#ZLUrrPL1RDSqhkQvkzRmtw http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/habaneros-mexican-grill-scottsdale?select=yi__pt7IXqW10j9yHcOFPA#yi__pt7IXqW10j9yHcOFPA http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/habaneros-mexican-grill-scottsdale?select=aOWIlXAmRLOPY72He5rTfw#aOWIlXAmRLOPY72He5rTfw  Carne Asada Taco, $2.50 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/habaneros-mexican-grill-scottsdale?select=8LpgSd1OL903W82t13JOrQ#8LpgSd1OL903W82t13JOrQ http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/habaneros-mexican-grill-scottsdale?select=u38XVbgVvK3uG9jgrPQjdA#u38XVbgVvK3uG9jgrPQjdA  My Son ordered the Carnitas and I asked him for a few bites so I could sample the plate...it was very good, nice flavor.  Beans and Rice complimented it well.  I had the Nachos and the Carne Asada Taco.  The Nachos were awesome....the did a great job with this dish.  It's Spicy and has a ton of flavor....portion size is big too.  They serve it on a Pizza dish....I think that's the trend now as this is at least the 2nd or 3rd place I've seen Nachos served on a Pizza dish.  Before moving to the Scottsdale area, I'd never seen that.  Back to the food....  The Carne Asada Taco was OK...it was the only dish that disappointed.  They do something different here with it....they add Lettuce....a lot of Lettuce....too much Lettuce (see pics above).  I think the Lettuce overwhelmed the flavor of the Taco....if I order this again, I will either order it without the Lettuce or take it off before I eat it.  The service here is good too.  We asked for very Spicy Salsa instead of the normal one they give you with your dish and they came back with a Habanero based Salsa....it had a serious kick to it.  It was nice to have that option.  Return Factor - 92%"}
{"text":"It's easy to understand why there is a constant line out the door here at lunch time. It is a hole in the wall and you would never know such good food was served in these four walls! Came here with my husband and ordered the Parillada for 2, (I didn't notice until later that I could have added shrimp for a few dollars more). I got lucky and scored a table and our food came to the table soon after. The food was a substantial serving, had steak, chicken, pork, chorizo, and veggies. Our sides were beans and rice with tortillas, sour cream, and guacamole. I'm glad we didn't get chips and salsa or guacamole because this one meal stuffed us.  This place put a smile on my face, we will be back! I hear they cater, too."}
{"text":"My wife and I love Habeneros.  I think we were the first customers at this location.  We've been through a lot since then-  the birth of our first born, scores of tacos, burritos and yes even tamales.  We use them for catering and the obligatory late night taco run.    If you haven't yet, you should.  If you already have- you should some more.   God bless."}
{"text":"Food is good and well priced, it always hits the spot when I have a taco craving, but this is now the third time that I've gone and every time people are just not that nice. They are kind of dismissive and I never feel like I want to stay and eat my food. It could just be my experience; maybe they are nicer to other people they see more regularly, but that isn't necessarily an excuse. I'll probably still come here every once in a while, but I want management to see this and hopefully work on being a little more welcoming and helpful."}
{"text":"The best chorizo breakfast burrito around. Excellent carnitas.  For quick and reasonable freshly made Mexican food, this is the best spot in scottsdale.  And the staff---top notch!"}
{"text":"Thank you yelp for finding an excellent Mexican restaurant!  Great food cooked to order. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Disappointment all around.  Staff rude, food bland, salsa tastes like tomato water.  Only neat thing here is the mexican drinks on tap.  Extremely disappointing."}
{"text":"I guess I just don't care for \"Mexican\" in this manner, from the chain versions like Chipotle and and Qdoba to local versions like Habanero's and Mr. Torta's.  Love the concept because I'm a fan of the order at the counter type of restaurant but this type of food just doesn't seem to do it for me.  For the name, Habanero's food was pretty bland.  I guess I should have known ordering the chicken.  Hubby got a mix of pull pork and spicy pork.  He said the spicy pork was better -- I'm sure I would agreed.  We both got the 3 tacos and thought the portion was generous.  Also the guacamole seemed real so I was fine with the $1 up charge for it.  Prices overall were reasonable.  The guys who put together our lunches seemed real nice and I do want to support what I think is a local business but I don't see us rushing back since as much as I try, this type of food just isn't my thing."}
{"text":"I cannot believe we just found this place!  My only complaint is that we live right up the street and haven't been there before this.  Absolutely wonderful Mexican food and a superb staff with great prices.  Go there today!!!"}
{"text":"Casual, counter service restaurant serving a nice variety of Mexican food such as fajitas, carnitas, carne asada, flautas, tacos, burritos, taco salads, and parrillada that pleases a crowd. They have some unique tacos like carnitas, mahi mahi, blackened shrimp, blackened chicken, calamari, and lobster that you usually don't find at most Mexican restaurants.   Ordered the carnitas de Jalisco that came with pico de gallo, guacamole, rice, beans, and tortillas. The carnitas were a good portion and delicious...tender, flavorful, and moist but not too rich. I don't mind that the carnitas has some fat in it but wish some of the large chucks of fat were cut out and not served. Overall, these were the best carnitas I've had in awhile. Would definitely come back to try some of the unique tacos and parrillada or have the carnitas again!"}
{"text":"We stopped her on our way to Sedona from Tucson.  Great food and service!  I placed my order and went outside to walk my dogs, when my order was ready they found us outside."}
{"text":"One of the comments said its similar to Subway. Pick your platform (3 tacos, burrito, or quesadilla) and choose your meat. After that you add your condiments. They are quick and most people are in and out. It isn't like a traditional restaurant with waiters etc. The goal is for you to get your food and be out as quickly as possible. There are waves of people that come and go, it's that fast. We came during the evening, but I imagine this place is packed during lunch.   I had three steak tacos. Prices were good, food was good, and it was super fast. I'll come back to eat here again."}
{"text":"First, I should say I am from out of town (east coast) and have only been to this restaurant once. However, I have been to other Mexican restaurants in the Phoenix area and at my home. The food here is very good.  The sauces and guacamole are spiced with care. Watch out for their special sauce-one taste will bring tears to your eyes! My husband had fajitas and I had taco salad with blackened fish. This is a very casual place, but on my visit I felt like the staff worked hard to present quality fresh food."}
{"text":"Very very very good. We went for late lunch/dinner. It was about 14 of us and a variety of foods, EVERYONE, loved their food, even the kids cleaned their plates. The wait staff was excellent. Great prices, you definitely get a bang for your buck. Start off with the chips guac, and salsa. I could hardly finish my tacos (blacken chicken/shrimp). You must add the rice and beans. Oh and don't forget the churros Anytime I'm in the area I'm coming back."}
{"text":"Dear Habanero's ,  I love you !! This place has got to be one of the better Mexican food places I've found since moving here from Cali. Everyone who works here is always friendly and the food always comes out fast. I love the blackened chicken burrito and the blackened chicken nachos. Everything I have tried on their menu so far has been pretty damn good."}
{"text":"Spotted this place while heading down 7th and had to stop(craving taco's). Upon entering I was happy to see it wasn't a dirty tacqueria but a grand looking restaurant with a club like bar in one corner and a full view of the kitchen dominating the rest of the space behind the counter.  While marveling at their expansive menu I couldn't make up my mind as to what to have; The man behind the counter must of have read my mind for he mentioned that they serve breakfast all day! I had to get myself one of their breakfast burritos with bacon and steak which also came with potatoes, scrambled eggs and cheese. Now to say this breakfast burrito was great is an understatement for it was one of the most clean tasting breakfast burritos I've ever had; it wasn't dripping grease through the toasted tortilla and smelled amazing.  I'm excited for family and friends to come in from out of town just so that I may have the opportunity to share this place with them. It is a real treat in this city which is no small feat for a Mexican food restaurant in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I looked up top Mexican restaurants in Madison and this placed popped up. I read all the reviews and I'm the same as the rest. I've driven by this place before, but never thought to stop by. I regret my life choices. Every time I've settled for east side Pedro's. Every time I've settled for Taco Bell. Every time I've decided to try some new Mexican place. I regret every single time. This place is AMAZING. Since finding it three or so months ago, I've gone at least a dozen times. Their ingredients are just so fresh and delicious. I've never had better Mexican food.  Funniest thing, they don't really speak English well. The first two times my boyfriend and I went they thought we wanted the spicy, pickled onions. We were kind of annoyed, but didn't want to cause a fuss. The first two times we had it we hated it. Now we've grown to love it and neither of us will get the pork burrito without it."}
{"text":"Black beans are vegetarian. Other beans aren't. Limited vegetarian menu!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness!!! This place was amaaaaazing! I had the mahi mahi bowl with rice and every bite was so good. I wish I could pack this place up and take it home with me. My friends had the fajitas and the nachos and said they were the best they've had!!' We flew in from queen creek based on the reviews and would fly in again I'm a heart beat!"}
{"text":"Amazing service. Margaritas are on point. Lobster tacos are worth returning for. Love this joint!"}
{"text":"Habaneros is an awesome little gem stuck in the strip mall hell known as Scottsdale.  If you are one looking for an original meal at a decent price, try out Habaneros.   I am addicted to their chipotle sauce.  You can find it in almost every item there.  Try out the Shrimp or Fish tacos, they are delicious.  Sometimes the food takes a little while to cook (and there could be a line).  So be prepared if you are going there on your lunch break.  The salsa is not as spicy as I would like, but I am splitting hairs at this point.  Go try Habaneros, you wont be disappointed.  Its a nice change from every unoriginal, corporate restaurant you find in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Our favorite Mexican place hands down. Fresh ingredients and atmosphere is very friendly.  Might eat here too much, but that sounds okay if I don't have to cook."}
{"text":"Its my new favorite spot! Cute, small atmosphere! I ordered the carne asada tacos and blackened chicken tacos, both with corn tortillas.  The carne asada taco had a little too much lettuce, but the steak was flavorful! The blackened chicken tacos were so good, it was like a explosion in my mouth! I think the next time I come here I would definitely get the chicken tacos with flour tortillas! I would definitely recommend this place to my friends!"}
{"text":"Came here on a slow Sunday morning, starving and (I admit) slightly waning from hunger. The food was pleasing - fresh, blackened shrimp wrapped in a tortilla with rice, onions, peppers and a creamy sauce. The service, however, was slightly sub par. Our cashier, though polite, enough charged us several dollars more than what we figured (I guess their soft drinks must be in the $3 to $4 range - the menu did not say).   On a positive note, my partner's carne asada burrito came with a heaping amount of guacamole. Also glad to see a non-chain restaurant with personality that serves alcoholic beverages in the Northsight area.  Salud!"}
{"text":"Our new favorite \"go to\" fresh Mexican restaurant. Love the seafood anything and love the seafood Mexican salads."}
{"text":"I really like this place!! Small, family owned and operated, with very nice people and excellent food.  We've gone for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I usually get Kayla's favorite for breakfast, stacked chicken enchiladas with eggs, cheese and salsa on top. On Friday's they usually have fresh lobster and fish, their lobster enchiladas are excellent. I also like the calamari and shrimp tacos, their calamari could be the best in town. And I like their flan, it is large enough for two people to share. My only complaint is that they charge for chips and salsa, but that isn't enough to take away a star."}
{"text":"One of my favorite lunch places. I've tried just about every type of tacos and all are great. The pork varieties + chicken are my favorite. LOVE the cilantro and limes. Ask for the salsa on the side if you do not want watery tacos."}
{"text":"They serve beer (actually a full bar now)!!!   This time I got a crunchy carnitas taco and a blackened chicken taco, SO good!  The carnitas is very flavourful, tender and the blackened chicken has a little spice. When we were leaving we saw a couples order; Carne Asada and Chorizo nachos, they looked phenomenal and they said they get them all the time!!!  ¡HAPPY HOUR! $2 Mexican Cervezas and $3.99 Margaritas 3 pm - 7 pm Monday through Friday  http://habaneros.mx/"}
{"text":"We had just moved into our new place and wanted to grab a bite. Saw it had great reviews and was literally minutes away.   As soon as you come in you see a menu board on the wall. You can choose between a burrito/bowl, quesadilla, rice, salad, torta, or nachos. Then you pick your choice of meat: steak beef, shredded beef, spicy pork, pulled pork, or chicken.   They have a lot of toppings for anything you choose to go with...I ended up getting a bowl with steak beef. The guac was great. I had enough for leftovers for dinner later.   They have jarritos!!! Also they have margaritas for $2 and beer! Lots of drink choices in general. I just went for a fountain drink. This place smells soooo good when you walk in.   It was hot today and didn't seem like the AC was on but then again, it might have been the heat from the grill and the fact that we just moved a whole bunch of stuff.   I'm definitely going to be a regular because it was worth it. I wish I could've tried their chips with the guac or salsa. :)"}
{"text":"It was okay. My husband got the cheese enchiladas and was not impressed. 5 out of 10 on those. Chips...average. kind of stale and the slasa was watery. I got the shrimp fajitas with wheat tortillas. They were good. Not fantastic. They had a watery sauce it sat in. Normally fajitas I've ordered have kind of a dry rub on them not swimming in watery sauce. The service was EXCELLENT the young lady that helped us was super sweet. I don't know if I would drive all the way up here to try again. But based on other reviews, maybe our mistake was getting our usuals when we should have ordered what others here have recommended."}
{"text":"Fresh guacamole smothered on juicy carne asada wrapped in a wheat tortilla.  Awesome!"}
{"text":"So, so, so glad that this one popped up on our Yelp radar while in town for vacation. The area right around our hotel doesn't have a lot of readily available dining options. But Habanero's is just 10 or so minutes to the north.  I went with the tacos, with barbacoa, and they were absolutely fantastic. The homemade corn tortillas, wow. Paired it up with some horchata for a delicious dinner. Very friendly service. We don't often eat in the same place twice while on vacation (for variety's sake), but may have to make an exception here!"}
{"text":"My coworkers & I often come here for lunch and we love it! I recommend the carne asada tacos with a side of guac, YUM. Maria & Abel are absolutely wonderful and their service is always prompt and attentive :)"}
{"text":"Actually I'm giving them a 3.75 for a rating. I've only ate here once while in Madison. I had a steak burrito. It was good tasting, some what large, and at a reasonable price. They have a big selection of ingredients that you can put in your burrito or taco. It's not a San Diego area burrito, but not bad."}
{"text":"Some friends took us out for dinner on Friday night, as we planned an upcoming vacation to Mexico.    As others have said, don't let the mini-mall appearance/location stop you from going in.  Great food - I had Chili Rellanos and they were unbelievable- truly authentic.  Maybe the best part was desert - Sopapilla's were so tasty and my husband, who is a chef, said it was one of the most perfect flans he had tasted in years - creamy, no bubbles, and just great.  Service is friendly, and might be alittle slow when they are busy, but the friendliness and food make up for it.  And they are so helpful - such as gettting extra sauces, and explaining them.  We will be back.  It is also good to know they are open for breakfast."}
{"text":"Ugh, no redeeming value. Cold enchiladas, cheap tequila, under cooked Chili rellenos. Skip it"}
{"text":"The Scottsdale location has much better service than the downtown location same great food but Service downtown was lacking because the servers boyfriend was in attendance and gave him a lot more attention than customers"}
{"text":"Giving Habanero's a solid 3 stars because although I do enjoy the food (great fish tacos), the service is incredibly slow. Most of the time when I go there, I have to plan ahead a 20-25 minute wait (at least) for food to arrive, even if the restaurant isn't that busy in the first place. It's frustrating and time-consuming, but tasty."}
{"text":"Wow really really bomb taqueria!!!! I had the asada burrito and it was legit! Had a couple drinks and they were perfect! Definitely recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"My plain tacos took a looooong time and came with all the fixins'.  After I got what I wanted it wasn't bad ..."}
{"text":"Best carne asade burrito ive ever had! They cook the steak for your burrittos right in front of you! Everythig is fresh! They dont even have a freezer. Ill mever go to chipotle again"}
{"text":"I live very close to Warner Park in bad need of a burrito and couldn't be bothered to drive to Qdobas. A quick walk to the new Habanero restaurant later and I found a similar set up to Qdobas and Chipotles. The menu had a good number of choices but I ultimately chose a steak burrito. It was very satisfying and there were lots of toppings to put in, although the slightest bit watery. Will be back to try their other entrees."}
{"text":"Awesome food!  Friendly staff!  All around great place to eat. Highly recommend the burritos."}
{"text":"Visiting from Los Angeles and was surprised at the quality of the food. I had a shrimp plate as well as some of their fish tacos. Place was a little hard to find (due to location) but was worth it when i did find it. Would come back anytime im in the Scottsdale area"}
{"text":"Unbelievable food!  The Mahi Mahi and carnitas tacos were absolutely delicious! The chile rellanos were amazing and the lobster enchiladas were out of this world!  And the premium margaritas are wonderful!  Great food and great service - thank you Maria!!"}
{"text":"This place is really cute. The food is awesome and the service is WONDERFUL. we were seated outside today because the place was packed, but it was really cold. As soon as an inside table opened up, the owner came and got us and moved us inside so we were warm. So sweet."}
{"text":"Soooo good. I loved my enchiladas! The salsa and Orange Bang are can't misses!"}
{"text":"We waited for about 30 minutes, figured eh this will be some darn good Mexican food like my great grandma used to make! It was no big deal since we didn't have plans. Good thing I wasn't starving otherwise I'd have a conniption lol. We had our food to-go, we live literally 3 minutes away and when we got home to eat, our food was pretty cold, we had to heat it up....I feel like because we waited so long the food should've been pretty hot or even warm but it just wasn't...McDonald's fries are fresher than our food was. The food itself was pretty good, not great. Not worth waiting that long for. It was cold and for how long we waited. No Bueno. I'll have to give this place another chance."}
{"text":"Considering this place is in Scottsdale, the food and prices are really good for Mexican food. I'm still on a search for good Mexican food here an this place does a pretty decent job.  We decided to try the Parrillada which is similar to the concept of fajitas but so much better. The price is dependent on how many people order it. 1 person is 10.99 and 2 people is $14.99.  Basically you get a combination of carnitas, chorizo, chicken, beef and potatoes on a warming dish.  There is the option to add shrimp for a few dollars more but we didn't get that. The meats are not mixed together but rather side by side. Each person then gets their own plate of beans, rice, sour cream and guacamole. The guacamole is freshly made and they give you a really good portion.  Even the beans seemed homemade too. It also come with tortillas - flour, corn or wheat. Wow, wheat?!  I didn't really like them but hey, it's great to know you have the option.  For the price and amount, it's a good meal for two people.  They make their own salsa according to the waitress. We got a side with chips and it ended up being a green and red one.  Both pretty decent but they were a bit too thin for me. I like mine with substance and chunky.   For drinks, they have self serve orange bang, pineapple whip, horchata, Jamaica. Yum!!! It's not too often you see that.    The place has great service too. The staff are all friendly."}
{"text":"Went here after reading the Yelp reviews and after visiting the Scottsdale Gun Club.  Best Tex-Mex atyle restaurant in Scottsdale,  hands down.   Nice family run place, not a chain. Good prices too. Trying to talk my wife into going back two days in a row! Yum."}
{"text":"no delicaies such as hutlacoche buche lengua or sesos but instead you get   great Jalisco style Mexican Food great soft or crispy tacos great burritos and a great parrillada (grilled meats dish)    The seasoning is just right and the meats are not over salted. (Chipotle's, I'm looking at you!) Usual selection of aguas frescas. Negra Modelo on tap! Great Michilada!  CLEAN! Safe neighborhood. NOT in a dodgy part of town! Our female server was very friendly and often checked on us without being obtrusive. No mexican polka music when I visited. Nice romantic bolero ranchero music playing (not blaring) in the background You can hold a conversation and not have the whole restaurant listening to your conversation. Great for families & dates, breakfast lunch and dinner.  I've tried it all when it comes to Mexican food. From late night street vendors in East LA to the streets of Mexico City. This is great mexican food and very convenient for the North Scottsdale crowds."}
{"text":"I think Habanero's has another location off Stoughton. This location is the same setup as the other one. First, you decide if you want tacos, a burrito, a burrito bowl, or a salad. Then, you choose your meat. There's barbacoa, carnitas (slow-cooked pulled pork, not the fried pork), adobo steak, adobo chicken, al pastor, or veggie. Then, there are a bunch of things you can add, like pico de gallo, sour cream, 3 different salsas, beans, cheese, etc.   I would recommend you get the 3 taco deal with the carnitas or the chile pork Mexico city style (cilantro, onions, and lime). It is a little piece of heaven and reminds me of home (Texas). It's all pretty cheap (about $6); does not come with sides like beans and rice. They also have horchata and Jarritos (Mexican soda)."}
{"text":"One of the selling points for Mexican food is that it is cheap and flavorful. Habanero's was only one of these. From a place named after one of the spicier peppers, one would expect more heat and flavor, but both were lacking.   I ordered a burrito and filled it with chile pork (I think that's what they said it was. I just pointed.), rice, black beans, bell peppers and onions, cilantro, onion, corn salsa, pico, cheese, and those spicy onions (note: the onions were mildly spicy at best). I also got some of their horchata, which was a little on the watery side for me. Things to note: the rice is just plain white rice, no spanish or cilantro rice here. Also, if you are looking for spice you probably want to try the hot or extra hot salsa. The one marked as \"medium\" did not have a bite at all.   As others have said, the ordering process is Chipotle style: you choose what style of plate you want - burrito, tacos, tortas, quesadilla, etc. Then you pick your meat and toppings. The guys behind the counter were really friendly and nice, and I would give the service 5 stars. But the food is a 3.5: just A-OK. I would be open to going back and trying something else.  Habanero's is located on the end of a row of stores that sell things like flooring. Pretty easy to miss if you're not looking for it."}
{"text":"I love this place and have been coming here since they opened.  Never had a bad meal and the owners treat you like family.  Highly recommended for those who enjoy good Mexican food!!  I get the carnitas and black bean burrito and it has never failed!"}
{"text":"Just to be clear, this would have been a 5-star rating if based only on the food and not the restaurant itself. I think it's important to make that differentiation because Habaneros food is excellent! I would highly recommend their tacos or burritos.   That being said, I would encourage you to get your food TO GO! This place is disgusting inside. After Rocky Rococos closed, they made an attempt to \"revitalize\" the space by adding more color. Unfortunately the paint that was added to the walls was also added to the floor. In addition to the paint, the floors are filthy. Saw dust from construction (months ago). Dirt and Grime from where booths use to be. Holes in several walls and temporary electrical (extension chords) taped to the ceiling to run lights, etc.   It is clear that management rushed opening this location. They brought their excellent food, but fell way short in providing a nice place to eat it. I've been here several times and there doesn't seem to be any interest in changing the ambiance any time soon."}
{"text":"This place is tasty. They have amazing salsa and the habanero salsa will knock you out! Boom! It's spicy! The meals here are simple and don't have an overwhelming amount of contents. Food is good and the service is great."}
{"text":"Awesome burritos, tacos, etc. Guacamole is plentiful and tasty."}
{"text":"Awesome!   Great fresh food, cheap, friendly staff.  The pickled onions with habanero's will make your eyes water in the best possible way."}
{"text":"The place was empty. But the service was fast and the food was great. I ordered a quesadilla with steak beef and the prices are great as well."}
{"text":"5/31/13  Finally stopped in for my first time visit to order takeout.  Since it was my first time, I wanted to check out the menu board overhead, but staring up at menu boards while people are waiting to take my order has never been my cup o' tea, so I looked around for a leaflet to peruse through, instead.  I liked the open layout of the grill and kitchen, as i was able to see the cooks in action.  I read under \"Habanero Specialties\" a listing for Chiles rellenos, a roasted poblano chile stuffed with jack cheese combo (rice, choice of beans-refried or black, choice of tortillas (corn, wheat, or flour) and pico de gallo for $9, and I'm a cheese-lover, so I had to try this. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/habaneros-mexican-grill-scottsdale?select=GtRJBN7OK6Vhu6x-zgZgrA#GtRJBN7OK6Vhu6x-zgZgrA  Looking around for a meaty meal, I saw under \"Parrillada,\" that I could get a four-meat combo http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/habaneros-mexican-grill-scottsdale?select=GtRJBN7OK6Vhu6x-zgZgrA#vd5i45jyypKwClT1WigsnQ (grilled steak and chicken, chorizo, and carnitas, with rice, choice of beans, choice of tortilla, guacamole, and sour cream for one person, $11, but I also noticed that diners could add shrimp to their meals, so I wondered if the red meats were grilled alongside the shrimp (I'm allergic to shellfish), or perhaps there is a designated area where shrimp are partitioned away from the other meats, and looking past the order-taker's shoulder, I could see that shrimp are indeed cooked on the same grill with the meats.  I told the order-taker that I would like to try some of their barbecue, but I can't if the meats are cooked in the same area as the shrimp, since I have a shrimp allergy, and she fired off a few sentences in Spanish to the cook, who replied with a few sentences of his own, after which she turned to me and said that my meats would be prepared in a separate pan.  Sweet!!  While my orders were cooking, I surveyed the place and observed that while the resto is small, it didn't FEEL small, because of all the flourishes that gave the place a bigger presence (wooden furnishings and counters, a mini-bar with a handful of Mexican beer pumps, a small fridge stocked with bottles of Mexican beer if you don't want to order drafts, a counter in front of the grills where you may dine, or sit and sip on a pint of beer while you wait for your takeout (which is what one guy did while I paid for my order and waited it out on one of the dining tables).  There's even patio seating, should you choose to dine alfresco, or if you don't want to leave the restaurant smelling like you spent all day cooking in the kitchen!  Both dishes were muy delicioso!  Since I had two entrees, I decided to try both bean choices (refried and black), as well as two tortilla choices (wheat and flour), and they were all very good!  The black beans were soft and tender- I was expecting something like biting into boiled lima or kidney beans, but the black beans were softer, more akin to firm, spring peas (not mushy!).  I also appreciated that both bean choices weren't very salty and tasted freshly-prepared and sprinkled with cotija cheese, not from cans and doctored over the stove.  The chile relleno batter tasted decidedly eggy, which I did not mind, but if you don't like your foods eggy, then you might want to stay away from this dish.  I usually try to avoid tomatoes (inflammatory), but the pico de gallo smelled so bright and flavorful that I couldn't resist, and I'm glad I didn't, for it complemented the cheesy relleno perfectly!  As for the barbecue meats, I liked them all, even the spicy chorizo!  I'd say the grilled steak was my fave, followed by the diabolical chorizo, which also came with similarly-seasoned, grilled cubed potatoes.  (I didn't mind the spice level of the chorizo while the meal was fresh, but I noticed that it tasted too salty and too spicy for me to tolerate subsequent leftover meals- strange, that.)  While I enjoyed the grilled chicken (I try to avoid anything corn-based, since I'm allergic to corn, and yes, that would also include eggs... one or two in a batter is OK for me on most days), I wondered if I could order my next barbecue combo sans chicken and with more grilled steak, instead?  Doesn't hurt to ask...  I returned the next night for another installment, since Mom finished the chile relleno leftovers soon after I arrived home with them.  Would love to go back and dine-in one of these days, and perhaps enjoy a complementing beverage and dessert with my meal!  :)  Mmm... happy hour menu sounds delightful, too! http://www.habaneros.mx/Happy_Hour.html"}
{"text":"Yum. Co-worker brought me here for lunch and this was a great spot. They are usually jam packed and nothing was different today. They are quick to get your order and quick to get it out, but the best part is that they cook everything right there when you order it. You can go to places like Chipotle and get things out of the steam tables and they are ok-not great not bad, but you can go to a place like this and get something fresh and great for lunch. They also cater so I will probably be ordered for our office at some point.  I got the ground beef taco and chicken quesadilla and he got the carne asada taco and a quesadilla but I can't remember the meat he had, either way we were both pleased.  I was really pleased with everything and their friendly service also says a lot to me too."}
{"text":"Old management seems to be back when I want about 3 weeks ago. Food still isn't what it use to be from a year ago however. Sadly, I don't think it will ever return to that point in time."}
{"text":"I ordered the blackened shrimp burrito, enchilada style.  After my first three bites, I opened the burrito to count how many shrimp were included.  In total, I found 7 baby shrimp hidden beneath the remaining 90% of the 2 lb burrito, which was all rice and a few diced vegetables.  Overall, the $9.00 burrito had good flavor, but paled in comparison to many (more affordable and more generous) nearby Mexican restaurants.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"Very nice, very fresh, good flavour. Quick service, solicitous and friendly ( not overbearing) wait staff-all family - I think. Great place for quick casual din( maybe not the romantic  date) . EXCELLENT fajita for two and very very nice flan ( rivals what we had in France).will definitely return."}
{"text":"Great food and service.. Everything made to order.  Love the carnitas burro! Both salsa's are fresh and tasty. Chips are also outstanding.."}
{"text":"Loved it. Great food, great prices, great portions. I split the carnitas nachos with a friend and it was plenty for two, and also very tasty. It wasn't overloaded with cheese or anything else. Just good portions of beans, cheese, sour cream, etc. The salsas are all excellent, as are the chips. Next time I go I'll try something different and post it up here. They could have maybe used another  waitperson during the dinner hour, but our waitress was very attentive, considering how busy she was."}
{"text":"On a 2015 blizzarding day with no lunch in sight and the office seemingly miles and hours away this palace was my savior. It can be best described as an authentic Chipotle. I went for the burrito because I have been burritoing it up lately and you can see all the ingredients in from of you before you add them on. Ask for a sample and they will be more than happy to let you get a taste to make sure you will leave satisfied and very satiated.   Now on the the spice levels. As someone who grows the hottest peppers on the planet and has just about every meal with some sort of piquant addition, they delivery. Furthermore, with a name like \"Habanero's,\" the specific pepper is well represented. My favorite being the lesser of there firery toppings, the habanero pickled onions. These onions have the spice level that most can handle and retain the crunch without a harsh raw onion kick. Even a corn based salas that is tasty and very mild. Live a litte and ask for them all ine the side!  ENJOY."}
{"text":"Honestly really wanted to like this place but I literally couldn't bite through the carne asada. It didn't look bad but it was so tough that it was not even edible unless swallowed hole. Other than that, the flavor was good."}
{"text":"Very tasty tacos, especially the tacos al pastor.  The only recommendation I have as a serious pepper lover is to have more peppers."}
{"text":"Yummy, cheap and fast. Why mess around with Taco Bell? Six fresh tacos for $13.50. Fresh, soft flour tortillas. Tried spicy and pulled pork, with pulled slightly more flavorful. Spicy might have had pepper flakes but was almost like it was stewed in tomatoes. Homemade sour cream, and assortment of toppings including lettuce, cheese, homemade guac and salsas. They've updated corn salsa to separate corn and diced tomatoes which probably works better. I took advice of other reviewers and added some pickled onions--nicely done. A little afterbite to them, but exactly what it needed. Most serious concern is that the pulled pork seemed a little on the dried out side. Small concern--man, I hate to use Styrofoam for takeout. Will eat from here again."}
{"text":"Yelp prompted my bf and I get some food here late one night. We were not disappointed. We got steak and pastor for our tacos and bf also ordered a burrito. The pastor was awesome and the pickled onions were also great. Can't say anything bad about the food and there was a point in time where we had it for dinner 3 nights in a row. Best tacos in Madison, in my opinion."}
{"text":"I was not impressed and expected more with all the great reviews. The tacos didn't have much flavor and the chicken was an odd orange color. There are better options."}
{"text":"Great food!! Wish there was one of these by my house!! Great service and awesome guacamole!! Ferry well priced as well!! They should replace every filibertos with a Habanero's!!"}
{"text":"When we pulled up, we groaned-not much curb appeal & we were skeptical. Friendly greeting-we were the only customers. The iced tea & guacamole were freshly made. A mahi mahi bowl & the carne asada bowl were recommended & did not disappoint-delish! She brought hot, medium & mild salsa's & they all had good flavor. Oh, & pica digallo was a perfect accompaniment. I'll be back for more!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Simple but very favorable.  Service was very good. Has everything you could want in a quick good Mexican meal. Differently northern Mexican food. I'll be back again."}
{"text":"Really tasty food, and fresh. Clean restaurant and friendly staff. I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"These guys do a great job on the service as well as the food. I've eaten here about 6 times and have had a verity of items. The grilled fish tacos are very good and I suggest trying those. But watch that habanero's sauce you'll feel it the next day if you know what I mean. It is hot stuff!   The place is a bit out of the view and hard to find...I always get northsight and hayden mixed up. I like the open kitchen so I can see what the cook is doing too. They serve beer, wine and hard liquor as well."}
{"text":"We were out in Phoenix meeting our wedding photographer and wanted some Mexican Food. Found this place on Yelp! Cool set up being fast food and dine in, staff was very friendly and the food was good. If you are looking for real Mexican tacos I would say to give this place a try. They have a small variety of liquor but mainly different tequilas. If you are a taco and tequila fun definitely come here on a Tuesday. Only thing I didnt like was their beans and rice. With them having such a great selection of tacos I was hoping for real Mexican beans, but no luck. Thanks for a great lunch!"}
{"text":"Great food, really friendly staff. Super cute place. The blackened shrimp tacos were delicious"}
{"text":"Best tacos in Madison. Hands down.  It's a shame it's not that close to downtown (or the westside), or this place would rake it in.  Service is Qdoba/Chipotle style.  Other than the meat you ordered, there's no limit to what these guys will throw on the burrito/taco/etc.  Ask for a little, you get more than normal (no joke - be wary).  While 2 bucks per taco (6 for a burrito) might seem over the top at first, you'll find yourself full after just a few.  The food itself is delicious, spice is good, and it's a mess. Everything you'll grow to love.  Try the barbacoa, it's been simmering for 24+ hours by the time you get it.  The stuff melts.  The flatscreens with the spanish music videos seal the deal. You'll never go anywhere else again."}
{"text":"Habaneros is one of my favorite hole in the wall Mexican food. Order their guacamole. It is yummy. I like their fish blackened tacos. They have quite a varied menu to meet selective eaters. I have not had a bad meal here. Their green sauce is very good. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Awesome place..delicious food..great customer service..reasonable prices..love the Adam's burrito ^^"}
{"text":"wow.  food made fresh.  food made well.  very tasty. had the parrillada tampequeno. MMMMMMMMMM.  habanero salsa was good, but not hot as some have said. (yea my kids say my tastebuds are warped)  bob had the chicken fajitas, he said they rocked.  the guac was very good."}
{"text":"Their food and margaritas are so fresh, authentic and inexpensive! This is the first Mexican restaurant that made me feel back in the days (35+ yrs ago) at Banning HS. Wow! Just WOW!"}
{"text":"This place was extremely underwhelming, Especially considering how many stars they have received.  The personnel were very nice, but this is definitely not good Mexican food.  I ordered the spicy pork. I should've known it would've underwhelmed because the meat looked as though it had been sitting for quite some time, but I really wanted to love this place, to find a good Mexican restaurant.  Nonetheless the meat was really dry, the portions are very small compared to the price, but I washed it down with a bottle of beer and took my loss on the chin."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Mexican \"fast food\" joints ever.  My company caters from them quite often, and whenever we order from there, people love us!!! We get the chicken fajita , carne asada and carnitas burritos. The meat is so flavorful and delicious.  They always do such a fantastic job. Very hard workers. It is owned by Arturo and his sister, Maria. Say hi to them next time you stop in."}
{"text":"Great family run mexican food place. The margaritas are nice and they do have a happy hour.  I love the burritos plates, good beans, tacos, really everything is good. The service is very pleasant and they know their stuff.  They have a small ouside area to dine. It is a small place so get there early and enjoy the great service and food.  They have take out too."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness! Yelp has smiled upon my taste buds once again. I searched for lunch in this area while my boyfriend and I were waiting on our car and we walked up to Habanero's just in time. After we put in our order all these people showed up behind us! We sat outside and waited probably less than ten minutes for our food. Based on what I read I ordered the carnitas burrito, my bf got a carne asada, blackened fish, and blackened chicken taco. To drink, horchata for us both!   Before I dug in I tried a piece of chicken that had fallen out of his taco onto the plate. Seriously, some of the softest most tender chicken I've ever had. My burrito was perfect and the guac inside sent me to the clouds of food heaven. The horchata was really good considering it came from a fountain drink machine.   We were checked on at least three or four times during our meal and asked how everything was and if we needed anything else. After we finished eating we started to gather our plates and trash not knowing if we were supposed to take it inside or what, not a second later the manager (at least he seemed like one) came to our table to take it all away. He was very friendly and easy going.   Next time we want to go out for breakfast it will be Habanero's. I can definitely see why this place is so popular."}
{"text":"You'd never guess how great this place is if you're one to judge a book by its cover. The location is less than desirable, but the food is AMAZING.  Probably the best chicken burrito bowl I've had.  You know it's good when the signs, the staff and the TV show in the background: all in Spanish.  Will I come back to this place: absolutely.  In the next week:  there is high probability."}
{"text":"My new favorite go to fast Mexican place. Prices are reasonable, service is fast, food is fresh and tasty. What more can you ask for?  I am a huge chipotle fan but with a place like habaneros, why not patronize a mom and pop establishment and support a local small business.  I liked my meal so much, I returned the next day. The man behind the counter remembered me and piled on more food :)   I am a big fan of their green chile chicken salad. YUM"}
{"text":"Habanero's is my lunch spot every Wednesday and has been for the past 3 years. I get a steak burrito almost every time, but I recently tried their tacos and enjoyed those as well. Friendly staff, clean restrooms, and quick service. I love that they have Grape Crush!"}
{"text":"Drove 12 miles to eat there. Would not recommend walking across the parking lot. Over cooked and over stirred.  1 cook trying to teach 2 newbies, tried to eat it because I was hungry but could not."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly service, clean and very reasonable prices for the large portions."}
{"text":"Third time here. Great authentic food. Affordable prices. Great friendly staff. Can't go wrong  with anything you order. Their HOT sauce is HOT! Habanero house made sauce. Carnitas are awesome"}
{"text":"For living in arizona, it's really tough to find some decent, authentic mexican food in the north scottsdale locale thus when I tried this play for the first time I was blown away. The blackened chicken is so moist and delicious, the carne asada is flavorful, and the best part of all, there is no need to run directly to the restroom after eating. BAM! This place has just been marked as my go to mexican food in the valley. Keep it up guys."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing!  Great service, and better prices.  I can't believe it has taken me two years to get to this place.  I will definitely be recommending to all my Madison friends and I WILL BE BACK!  $5 for a burrito with everything on it!!  Plus they serve a wide selection of Mexican beers and everything is just so fresh.  I will not be going back to Chipolte or Qdoba anytime soon.  Keep up the great work Habeneros!!"}
{"text":"The horchata here is really good in my opinion.  The food would be what I'd call the definition of \"average Mexican\".  Our guacamole appetizer was missing any real flavor, and lacked that creamy texture that I personally prefer.  Our main dish was one of the \"house specialties\", which also tasted average."}
{"text":"Looking for a Cinco De Mayo dinner. BINGO!!! Walked in and was greeted by a smiling crew and a fun atmosphere.  Taqueria-ish but very spacious with seating for 30 plus another 6 at the bar.  Service was prompt and friendly.  Top notch margarita $5.99 huge! Awesome food!  Calamari taco, fish taco, scrumptious and hearty.  The parrillada dish was as good as any Mexican concoction on a platter that I have had. Drop in, you won't leave hungry and your taste buds with thank you."}
{"text":"I've driven by this place many times and never thought to try it. Doesn't show for much from the outside, I would have thought it to be another \"(fill in the blank)bertos\" of some sort. However, I was driving by today, craving a taco, and needed somewhere quick. So glad I stopped! Food was great, and has much more of a restaurant feel to it, than a fast food joint."}
{"text":"Vistited this place based on yelp reviews and had excellent lunch. Chicken fajita was tasty and tasted best shrimp quesadilla here. Didn't like Chiles Rellenos much.. But everything else was very good and fresh. This place is definately going to be our frequent Mexican food place."}
{"text":"This place is just amazing! And I love Mexican food. They're on point, the price is great and the portion is enough to get you full. I totally recommend this place!!."}
{"text":"Great food!  Well kept inside, nice staff, and reasonably priced.  Will be back again next time I'm down town... oh and margaritas!"}
{"text":"Habanero's is a small storefront with about six tables inside and another five on a patio.  You order at a counter and the food is brought to your table.  We've all done that before - no problem.    The menu is pretty standard Mexican, with tacos, burritos, a few platters that include rice and beans, chips and salsa, and guacamole.    There's no sense commenting on the service because there basically isn't any.  Ditto ambiance.  You just come here to satisfy your hunger.  So it all comes down to the food, and at Habanero's it's not bad, but it's not really good either.  Better than Taco Bell but not as good as a dozen sitdown Mexican restaurants in the area, and really not much cheaper.  Why go here?"}
{"text":"We'll start at dessert...Three of the people at our table had the flan. All three of us said, \"this is the best I've ever had.\" The other three had sopapillas - they said the same thing. Every main dish was delicious (we shared). The blackened chicken enchilada, the chilies rellenos, the fish tacos, the tacos carnitas. All so good. Then there was the fresh guacamole and house made chips. Oh, yum. And the margaritas - yep - everything, delicious. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Really good burritos with pleasant service. As others have stated, it's similar to Chipotle and Quidoba, but they have more options for toppings on your meal, like a dash of cilantro."}
{"text":"So excited when they opened up!  I have not been there when it is super busy but it is a very easy going atmosphere.  The more authentic way to go when compared to Chipotle or Qdoba.  Huge servings for less than Chipotle and Qdoba as well.  I had a plain bean and cheese burrito for $4.00 or so.  I think full on burritos run close to $5.50.  Not the fanciest place (a little tongue in cheek ;) ) but is clean!  The food is super.  Legit flavors and one of the only places that uses cilantro as a topping, not just thrown in with a salsa.  I love cilantro!!  Awesome food for sit down or a quick eat and run."}
{"text":"This place is so authentic, I absolutely loved the food and the service was top notch. The chorizo is great!"}
{"text":"I recently stopped by this establishment and was very surprised at the quality of the cuisine. When we stepped in there was a huge pot of meats simmering away while an open prep kitchen showed just how much pico de gallo this place must run through.   The set-up is a lot like a fast casual restaurant and the menu is posted on the wall. Simply pick a option and customize it with meat/rice/beans/veggies/salsa and voila! Deliciousness.   I ordered the 3 steak tacos with corn tortillas while the fella got a steak torta. The tacos were amazing and I love how they heat up the tortillas before they proceed. I would definitely get these again and don't shy away from the spicy, pickled onions. Completely amazing.  The bite of torta I had seemed a little lackluster - I have had others that I preferred more but that's a personal thing. The prices are great and definitely worth it for the freshness and character that each dish possesses.   I would definitely recommend this place to any looking for an incredibly cheap-eat and tasty option. Also, they serve fountain soda, blended drinks, and beer. Perfect."}
{"text":"Fresh, fresh, fresh! These people care about their food. And they don't roll their eyes when you speak Spanish--they encourage you. Fantastic for my little girl and this Spanish minor. I always get vegetarian fare because it's so good. And cheap. And fresh. Did I mention fresh?"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since the place opened as I work right across the parking lot. The food is always excellent and fresh. The owner and staff are some of the nicest people you will ever encounter.   Some favorites: ground beef burrito, blackened chicken salad, fish tacos, and the breakfast burritos (they are massive and filling and everything you could possibly want). Oh, and the sopapillas. Don't ever forget the sopapillas. Pillowy little bundles of cinnamon and sugar with honey if you want. Delicious.  Yes, they take a little while for lunch but it's all made right before your lil' eyes.   Red sauce is awesome, green is tasty, and the habanero sauce has a good flavor without cooking your face.  These guys also do catering and deliver!"}
{"text":"First time here and I got the carne asada burrito. The burrito was good portioned and well priced. The meat was cooked perfectly, the guac was on point and the salsa added some great kick."}
{"text":"I returned to Habaneros and the owner \"Sergio\" addressed each and every issue I had. I knew that this man cared about his business deeply from the previous conversation I had with him. I feel for this good man and I'm willing to admit when I'm wrong. I didn't see the straws next to the drink machines, as I had previously stated they were next to the bar across the restaurant, I was wrong. I complained about the cooking time, that was due to me engaging Sergio in a conversation which took him away from helping with the cooking and also gave him the impression I had time to talk, I'm sorry. Today My food was prepared quickly and was delicious, just as it was the last time. I complained heavily about items missing from my takeout bags and right when I walked in today the owner exclaimed \"We ran out after you, you didn't get everything!\" Sergio gave me the items I didn't receive the last time and then proceeded to give me my meal for free. Sergio told me \"We want our customers to have a wonderful experience and you didn't, I will make the necessary improvements and appreciate you letting me know where we can improve.\" Sergio went on to tell me that he has always and will always \"Make things right for his customers,\" he went beyond the extra mile today and I was the one that was in the wrong by not understanding what had happened. I didn't receive everything in my to go bags, but I know that will never happen again and this kind owner made good on everything. This is a restaurant with amazing food, amazing customer service and an amazing owner who really cares. I had said that I hoped this place would soon blossom, not realizing, it already had. Thank you Sergio, I will be back often and hope this updated review makes up for the details I mistakenly criticized."}
{"text":"I know there's no rule book somewhere that says Mexican food ought to be cheap and fast, but I feel like it's a given considering the ingredients... right? Add to my wild assumption living in the southwest for 6 and half years and I grew to learn that if I was going out for Mexican, it wasn't going to be a long dinner experience and I wouldn't have to shell out a lot of bucks. Haberno's holds true on both accounts. They're quick (as you essentially watch them assemble food before your eyes) they're cheap, a five spot will buy you lunch, but in my opinion they lack flavor. I'm all for loading up some tacos with salsa, but I also think meat should be seasoned so you don't need to dredge everything in pureed tomato. I'm up for giving them another shot, but others in town bring the flavor these guys lack."}
{"text":"Just discovered this place. Food was really good! Nothing out of the ordinary food wise but it was really good and cheap. The staff was super helpful and friendly. A great first experience. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here many times since this location opened. The bottom line is it's the best fast-casual Mexican food you can get in Madison. There is no need to ever go to Qdoba or Chipotle again, unless you're dying to have some white cheese sauce. If you want tacos, burritos, a quesadillas, or tortas, this is the place you should go.  In the first year they were operating, it was like stumbling onto a gold mine. They were reckless with the portions and way cheaper than similar restaurants. Their regular portion of meat was more than what double what you'd usually get at a place like Chipotle. They have definitely reigned it in a bit over the years, which is for the best, as I would like them to stay in business. Nowadays, they're still generous with the meat, but really skimpy with the salsas, cheese, and guac. Don't hesitate to ask for more.  My go-to is a chicken burrito with rice, black beans, cilantro, onions, pico de gallo, habanero salsa, cheese, and veneno (spicy onions pickled in habanero flakes). The veneno is an absolute must. In used to melt your face off, and even though they have neutered it a bit for more average spice lovers, it still adds some nice heat and so much flavor.   The pastor and barbacoa are the other best meats, in my opinion. I'm not crazy about the carnitas or steak.   If you read a review telling you that the meats have \"0 seasoning whatsoever,\" you should ignore it, because that statement is insane. In my many, many times eating here, there have been sub-par experiences, mostly owing to new staff. Maybe that person ate there on a day like that. This is the best choice in town BECAUSE the meats are so damn delicious. And it doesn't hurt that you pay $2 less than you would elsewhere and end up getting more food for it. Eat here. Get a punch card. Continue eating here. You will be pleased."}
{"text":"Good burrito w fresh ingredients. Nice and spicy, good service!"}
{"text":"The food was terrific -- flavorful and nicely presented -- and affordable, and the service was speedy and friendly. We had tacos -- carnitas, fish and carve asada -- and they were excellent. Chicken enchiladas were delicious. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"It's ok, if all you want is a taco or burrito. Minimal selection and no platters of food. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great blackened fish and shrimp tacos and blackened shrimp quesadilla. Calamari tacos aren't on the menu, but be sure to ask if they're available.  Owner Arturo is really hands-on and makes a mean margarita too!  Be sure to ask for the orange (habanero) sauce!"}
{"text":"Disgusting! Ordered Guacamole & chips, though the guacamole was green that was the only resemblance, flavor was horrible. Pork for the taco was similar to the consistency of baby food but flavor was so bad my boyfriend actually gagged when he tasted it. Food was cold, not even room temperature. Will not go back! No stars are warranted for this place."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot downtown. I'm not a huge Mexican food fan but I found a dish I really like here. I get the chicken fajita plate which is chicken, peppers, onions, guacamole, sour cream (I don't get this), and a choice of beans or rice - I get the rice and it's delicious.  It's a pretty good deal too because even with the $1.99 drink it's just a little over $10. Local mom and pop shop which makes it even better.  They have a small bar area if you wanted a beer or margarita. They share a parking lot with Jimmy John's and it looks small, but we have never had a problem finding a parking spot at prime lunch time. Friendly employees and always had a good experience."}
{"text":"I love it when places keep it pretty simple.    I came here for breakfast on the recommendation of several friends who have been here.  Now, I wasn't sure if I could accurately judge the place based on breakfast offerings.  But that was the time I could get over here during my business trip.  So breakfast it was.    One burrito with egg, potato and chorizo later, and I see why everyone I know who has been here raves about the place.    I didn't eat anything overly creative here.  It was just a straightforward breakfast burrito.  But man, if I lived and worked here everyday, I'd get this for breakfast everyday.  It's one of those perfect everyday choices that would make me happy to get up in the morning.    My dining companions got items that looked even more appetizing to me.  It was so that I was actually jealous of what they ate.  Which of course means that when I'm back in town I'm getting what they got.    But it will be tough for me to turn down that burrito."}
{"text":"Awesome, I've bookmarked this place and it'll be a must stop for me in the future, when I'm in town. Guacamole made fresh, blackened chicken, moist, fresh & spicy - just right"}
{"text":"Amazing quality for the price! I ordered some ground beef tacos and the ingredients were so fresh that I actually felt really good after eating them! The meat was not greasy or overly seasoned. My boyfriend got a breakfast burrito and had the same opinion. You can eat GOOD Mexican food here for a cheap price."}
{"text":"Prices have gone up since photos posted, each meat is around or over $7, it was $17 for two entrees.  Flavor OK. Definitely wouldn't say I'm going to pick this over taco bell next time because I can eat a lunch at taco bell for just a few dollars, but I guess in terms of taste it was better than a chipotle or qdoba type thing with similar pricing. Was disappointed that they charge the same price as meat for just a plain cheese quesadilla."}
{"text":"This has been one of the few places I have been to in the Phoenix area that has tacos and drinks. No Dollar Taco Tuesday but they did have dollar off Mexican beer on a Tuesday. And dollar off fish on a Tuesday.  So I got a shrimp taco and a fish taco, fried with corn tortillas. Not as good as real Mexico, but it will do. And they had a full bar for you Margarita enthusiasts."}
{"text":"I recently went here at 930 at night and grabbed a burrito. Instant food poisoning. I was sick for almost 2 days. I'm guessing the food had been sitting out way too long or there was some bad cross contamination. I'll never go back especially after discovering Cuco's down the road. Food is way better and the service is much friendlier."}
{"text":"Tried the steak quesadilla here for the first time the other day and it wasn't the best quesadilla I ever had, but it was pretty good! Also, yummy guacamole! My boyfriend goes here all the time and says he loves it!"}
{"text":"Parriada was tasty and the serving for two was just perfect for two (no left overs- but we rarely eat rice or more than a spoonful of beans).   Chips were hot and fresh. Service was great.   Overall a little pricey for location and food."}
{"text":"Good quesadilla, the burrito enchilada style was okay but served on too small of a plate and it wasn't very warm. Friendly people, decent environment."}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican food from the Jalisco region.  Quality of food is consistent and high.  Great service and low prices.  Highly recommend the Carnitas.  We've been eating here for about 2 years and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"We needed lunch after a round of golf and I knew there was a Mexican place nearby that had been Yelped in a good light, so I dug through the phone app to find the name of the place.  Whether I got it exactly right or not, Habanero's was the place we were going to hit - it had positive reviews from most everyone as well as my friends.  The menu is simple - \"we have these ingredients - in which form would you like to consume them?\" was the basic jist of it.  We both had the steak burrito and were not disspointed.  The flavors popped - I was very satisified with the taste and the large portion.  Basically, it's the same format as Qdoba or Chipotle, but tastes better.    I wouldn't mind trying the tacos next time - I saw them being made for a gentleman in front of us.  They were a bit messy (but a GOOD messy!) and I wasn't ready for that sort of committment, so I opted for the easier-to-eat burrito...  I won't chicken out next time!"}
{"text":"Great customizable tacos, fresh toppings. Their chips and salsa are delish, better then most \"Mexican\" restaurants in town. Cheap food and beer, but still not on par with any taco place in Southern California or Texas."}
{"text":"Very small cafe-style spot in a strip mall. Habanero's offers amazingly good authentic food that you would pay double for down the street. They have everything from breakfast burritos to unique daily specials. All are served with several delicious salsas. If your not trying to impress a date, then try this for an affordable, casual, neighborhood experience."}
{"text":"Cheap prices...friendly service...good food.  Went here with a group of 7 people and we were accommodated quickly.  Tables were combined, orders were quickly taken and they even separated the bill 7 ways.  For a grab your own seat and order at counter type place they did not have to do all that but they went out of their way for us.  Ordered guacamole and chips with salsa for appetizers.  Salsa was to thin for my taste but the chips and guacamole were excellent.  For main dish ordered the blacked chicken quesadilla, ground beef taco and blacken chicken taco with black beans as a side.  Everything was good and tasted fresh.    Open kitchen is a nice touch."}
{"text":"i am rating according to service, price and food quality. best service - this is a family owned restaurant and the owners are the one taking care of you- very personal service. Price is cheaper compared to other restos around the area , so that is great! my favorite food is the blackened shrimp tacos - excellent. i also love their carne asada tacos! great find in north scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!!! The service was excellent too. Great prices on the different menu items. You won't leave here disappointed!"}
{"text":"Really friendly staff and great food. It seemed to be super busy but it never bothered and their was plenty of seating at the time. It looks as though there could be a challenge to find a table if everyone was looking to dine in but overall great spot. The beef burrito chimi style is the way to go!!!"}
{"text":"The food was really good and the service was also friendly and fast. The restaurant was clean and convenient to get to what we needed. It's a little small, but it's situated well and we had no trouble finding a place to sit with 5 of us."}
{"text":"MMM... lobster tacos! I'm here at least once a month for lunch with coworkers. I always get a lobster taco and a shrimp taco on whole wheat tortillas with a side of chips and guac. Good service, good prices. ****4 Stars for lunch."}
{"text":"Kind of hard to find but it was definitely worth it. Food came out fast, hot, and so yummy. The burrito was wrapped tightly and was juicy and tender, while the bean and cheese nachos were beany and cheesy. Would very much recommend."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly service. I ordered the blackened chicken tacos,very tasty and had a carne asada burrito that was also delicious! First time here and will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"We stopped here from two time zones away for a quick bite and a few cheap drinks. The service, food, and drinks were sincerely a steal for the bill we received. I highly recommend this place for anyone trying to decide if they should dine here. Great food, great service, great value. Muchas gracias de Kentucky. Oh, for the record we had carnitas, Guadalajara style. A great choice."}
{"text":"I had the lunch special and chips and salsa today. The special was blackened fish and shrimp along with all the fixings and 3 tortillas. The chips are a little thicker than I like and the red salsa (both green and red are served if ordered) is very much like someone else reported...liquidy, definitely nothing for your chip to grab on to. The highlight was the blackened fish and shrimp, which I used to make my own tacos. The beans and rice were average. The place is small with most tables fitting two people and a few tables for four. Inside they can hold perhaps 30 people including the 5 or 6 people at the bar. I gave it a three-star rating because the fish and shrimp was very tasty but the watered-down salsa was not my favorite. They are opening a second location in SW corner of Scottsdale/Shea in about three weeks behind the Denny's and will have more space for patrons."}
{"text":"There Chile Relleno's are so good! How ever, I feel like it was missing a sauce like my abuela makes. MMMmmm. Also, they should have the option to stuff these bad boys with chicken and cheese. My opinion but they were still delicious and I would go back for more. I also tried there carne asada tacos and they were pretty damn good.   Furthermore, the best thing I enjoyed was their hellish habanero salsa. Oh my was it freaking hot and tasty! Definitely pair that up with the guacamole. BOMB! I'm a fan of this place and will return again to try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Habanero's is right next to my work so I'm a frequent visitor. In a nutshell, Habanero's is like a Qdoba but fresher and has more of a true Mexican flare. Their corn tacos are amazing. Their quesadillas are amazing. Their staff is friendly and they are quick!  When you first see the location it doesn't scream, \"come here for lunch\". But if you look past the frontage road location to give this place a try, I promise you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Recommend the tacos! All fresh and just the right size. We each got 3. Variety. Made to order."}
{"text":"My friend and I just happened to run into this restaurant on Saturday April 8th 2017 about 1 pm.. We are from Albuquerque and were in town for some baseball games.  I am sad to say we didn't get the servers name, but I was floored by her excellent customer service and her constant smile on her face. It's hard to find \"good service with a smile\" these days. The nachos were great. They ran out of the beer that we wanted but there were plenty of other options to pick from. We would definitely go back!!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious. Atmosphere divey. We were the only people speaking English and it was awesome. I saw a whole pile of cut avocados in the back - I had to try the guacamole... So worth it. I got three tacos-one each of spicy pork, pulled pork and shredded beef, with corn tortillas.  Loved all three but the spicy pork was my favorite.   Overlook the location and the exterior! Your mouth will thank you!"}
{"text":"I came here because I saw all the good reviews and they have ground beef.  It's hard to find ground beef anything out here. My boyfriend and I went and the first thing I noticed was the cook opened up a plastic drawer with the ground beef under the stove!!! I was like umm that doesn't look sanitary let alone how is the meat staying at the proper temperature.  He then just threw it on the grill and I was hoping he seasons that meat but he didnt. That was a red flag but I'm like well we already paid for it maybe they will do something later idk. The customer service was not good. I walked to the bathroom and it was locked and they just watched me so I assumed someone was in there. While waiting for my food a woman goes up and grabs a key to the restroom. I thought \"why didn't they just say you need a key?\" I go to grab napkins and they are just staring at me and I'm like I need napkins. Anyways I get my food and it is terrible!! The meat is just ground beef with no seasonings nothing and the refried beans are just that plain non-seasoned refried beans. Taco Bell even has seasonings and I hate Taco Bell. I understand some people have \"lighter tolerances\" when it comes to seasonings but come on. It's called Habaneros for a reason. Very disappointed I won't be back!"}
{"text":"Really good plate with a variety of meats. Basically fajita. The chorizo was the standout. As well as the chicken.  The things we thought were bland we're the Carnitas burrito and Blackened fish taco.  Shrimp tacos were great!"}
{"text":"We've gone back multiple times, and this is our go-to place for no-nonsense killer tacos and burritos.  Every meat we've had to date is killer;  the el pastor and barbacoa are incredible!  Great beer selection as well, and impossible to beat $2 tacos for the portions they give you."}
{"text":"Chips and salsa...MEH... BUT- The blackened chicken soft tacos are tasty for a little hole in the wall fast food kind of place.  I was definitely surprised.  The staff is so nice. Worth a shot to check it out for a little mexican snack."}
{"text":"Glad I found this place! it's an awesome local place with strong drinks and really friendly service. The house marg was perfect with salt and wasn't too sweet like at some places. The guac was homemade and excellent as well. The tacos were about perfect with the carne asada as the best but the shrimp and fish closely behind.   Be sure and check this place out if you're in the area and want local Mexican food."}
{"text":"Massive, fresh, tacos. Massive, fresh, burritos. Awesome pastor and carne asada. Tasty horchata. Good prices AND they don't charge extra for sour cream, guacamole, and extra salsa! This is my go-to joint for quick tacos and burritos.  Update: So apparently they changed things a bit since I was there last. They now charge 75 cents for guacamole, which is a bummer. Other than that it is still the same old deliciousness."}
{"text":"Great food,Eat there all the time,Need to expand their menu though,I recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"Great service. Friendly and very helpful considering it was our first time here. Had the blackened fish and shrimp burrito. Even though it's not considered spicy, there's still a bit of a kick to it. Had to buy chips and salsa but it comes with free refills as does the drinks. I like that they also sold breakfast burritos even though it was dinner time. Overall a good find... will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Delicious food and fantastic service from Natasha and friendly owner Arturo. The place is fairly small with only a few tables and the decor is reminiscent of Mexico.  The food was fresh and plentiful and prices are very reasonable. No complaints here. Will be back."}
{"text":"Fresh with great service. Sauces are great: standard red has a bit of heat and very deep, smoky flavor. Green is nice and fresh/tangy. Drip a little on each bite of your burito:"}
{"text":"This place was awful. There was one waitress waiting on the entire restaurant. It took us 30 minutes to get chips and salsa, very bland chips and salsa. By the time I got my food I was starving but 2 bites in I found a bug crawling across my plate. Will never go here again ever."}
{"text":"Cheap and easy Mexican. Not Stellar, but good enough for quick eats on a friday night."}
{"text":"The food was excellent, very authentic!  The service was friendly, too.  The place was very small, though; kinda cramped.  Everyone was willing to wait for a table to get the great food.  This place is worth your time!"}
{"text":"Anything everything on their menu is great. The owners are so nice. I especially like the tacos. Try the pickled onions - they are deliciously soaked in habanero peppers."}
{"text":"Thank you Yelp for helping us find this great lil Mexican grill while at spring training. Great service.  Great food. The special blackened chicken chimichanga's were awesome. Hope to see you next trip down."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this hole in the wall type Mexican restaurant after a long morning at the science center. A quiet and cute little place, friendly staff, and the food, oh my goodness the food! It was so delicious. We ordered fresh guacamole and chips while we waited for our order. It was so good! I had the chicken burrito and my husband had the steak burrito. They were stuffed with all of the fixings! Also, their salsa was yummy. We were offered green and red. Even the kids meals have big portions! All in all, delicious, filling, and super fresh! We will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"I don't get too adventurous with mexican food, but I have trouble finding places I like and that my fellow diners like. This place is quick, and the food is good, especially for the price. The cheese crisp and sopapillas are great. Also, the service was 5 star - very friendly from hi to goodbye."}
{"text":"Been going here for years, never disappoints! Love the fajitas and quesadillas. Chips and salsa are a must too!"}
{"text":"One of my favorites.  Try the parrillada.  It's always tasty and very filling.  Great staff that is always very accommodating.  I always enjoy the ice cold draft beer with dinner."}
{"text":"Food was very bland. Ordered the breakfast burritos(steak and chorizo) and the blackened chicken nachos. The burritos came with about an 80% ratio of potato to steak and eggs. Don't really think even if the ratios were proportionate that the taste would have been any different. Even adding sauce did not make the meal any more appetizing. The blackened chicken nachos were decent only because of the fresh guac. Gave two stars solely for the guacamole, otherwise water has more flavor then their breakfast burritos."}
{"text":"This is definitely my local go to taco spot! Best tacos and great prices. Most tacos are $2.50 each and they are loaded up with meat. I usually always go with the carnitas and their red sauce. They have a good habanero and green salsa as well. I've taken others that have gone with the crane asada or chicken and never heard anything but positive feedback on it.   They will also do catering on short notice. I had my team working on a Saturday at the office and was able to call him that morning and got the food delivered by 11am to our office. Everyone absolutely loved the food and asked that we use them again in the future instead of the other spots we've used in the past.   Service is always great as well. It's a order at the counter type of setup but they will let you leave the tab open and serve you in case you want to order drinks or more food because you loved the first plate so much."}
{"text":"1st visit here. Very conveniently located near Scottsdale Gun Club. Had observed many favorable Yelp reviews and was intent on trying it for quite a while.  I was there for a Sunday lunch pretty much right around noon. There was another fast casual restaurant a couple doors down with no customers in sight. Habenero's was hopping with people nearly filling the dining area and the outside tables.  I took a menu and found a table. Drinks were served almost instantly after ordering. Chips and salsa were fast behind. I ordered the carnitas burrito. It comes with guac and pico. The server brought the mild and medium salsas with the chips.  The chips were light and not overly seasoned. The mild salsa is just that. Mild. So mild you could drink it like it was soup. The medium salsa is a tomatillo base with onion, garlic and jalepenos. Very little bite but good flavor. She asked if I wanted the hot salsa and cautioned that it was \"very\" hot. It's a flavorful mix of habenero peppers and garlic. A bit of a bite to it - not something I'd drink like soup. Good flavor. One more note about the chips: without salsa, I could detect that the oil might be a bit off as there was a slight aftertaste that didn't seem great.  Now, the carnitas burrito: not too big, not too small. Good value for the money. And, lean pork. A decent amount of well-made guac and a small amount of pico. No fluff. No lettuce or cheese or anything else unnecessary. A very tasty burrito!  So why only 3 stars? OK. First, the staff was very friendly. Service was attentive and prompt. Great burrito. Great \"hot\" salsa. Really good \"medium\" salsa. And who cares about mild salsa? The chips, as I said, were just a bit off. Maybe the oil needed to be changed out, I don't know. When the check arrived, all I was given was the smallest piece of receipt paper I'd ever seen with a printed total. I expected an itemized receipt. And, when presented with the copy I was to sign, there wasn't a customer copy. I guess I was to take the tiny slip that came at first. And, therein lies the reason for only 3 stars."}
{"text":"This place had pretty good chile Rilenos and I was pleased with them. The lobster tacos were out of this world and I'm saddened we didn't come back for more. The chicken my kids got had a funny taste, and therefore I can't give it 5 stars. It was a small restaraunt and our party of 7 took up most of the place."}
{"text":"Salsa is like water.  The waitress was on her cell phone while taking our order. Not attentive and somewhat rude. Way better places every where . Margaritas were large and good"}
{"text":"Bad deal all around.  Monday night, no customers, literally.  Gal at the front did not smile once. I should have walked out then and there. She should be trained or let go.  The cook was wearing gloves which is nice since he is working where customers can see him clearly. Not sure what he was doing since there were no customers, but maybe fiddling with the grill or something? Then his phone rang which he answered with his gloves and began to have a conversation, while continuing his kitchen work. Phone in hand... phone on shoulder...phone in hand. Yuck.  Do whatever you need to do with gloves and phones, etc., but please not in front of the customers.   We walked out so can't comment about the food."}
{"text":"I've drove by this place a couple of times...  Curiosity finally got the better of me today, and I couldn't be any happier with my decision.  The carne asada rice bowl was excellent.  It wasn't too much food to give me a food coma, but definitely filled me up.  I was in for $10 with carne asada rice bowl and a soda.  I will note that I asked for the HOT sauce and it was a burner - gave me a bit of a sweat stash.  It was habanero based, so watch yourself before you wreck yourself!  Enjoy! Rikky"}
{"text":"First time here. Came by after barrett-jackson car auction. Figured I'd try it out. They looked very good from all the pictures. Ended up being great food. Very friendly. Family own, got to talk with owner and family."}
{"text":"Living in SoCal, I've had my fair share of Mexican food. From Tex-Mex, to hole-in-the wall, to authentic, to fake Mexican-Cali-Fresh. So while in Scottsdale for work, I had to see what they had to offer. Yelped, and found Habanero's. Overall, I have mixed reviews. The chips were gooooood! Not just corn, but different flavored chips. Yummy. I got a side of guac, which I'll pass on next time. TOOOO many onions for me and not enough salt or lime juice. The owner, as others mentioned, was super nice! Cracked jokes, was friendly, very good service. BUT, when it came to the food, ehhh. I hate ordering take-out and having them eff up your order! I ordered 3 tacos: 1 fish, 1 blackened shrimp, and 1 carne asada, requesting them on corn tortillas with no onions, cilantro, or pico, with extra limes. Got them on flour tortillas with cilantro, with 1 small lime wedge. The fish taco was my least fav. Just tasted like frozen battered cod that was seasoned enough. The shrimp was just ok. The carne asada was great. The meat was very tasty. Also got a side of rice. My whole order (including guac, 3 tacos, and rice) came to $11.16.   Overall, I was disappointed with my food mostly because it wasn't as I ordered it. Lesson learned: check it before you leave if you get it to go. I miiiiiight go back when I'm in town next and give it 1 (only 1!) more chance."}
{"text":"just had a carne asade burro for lunch with guac, sour cream, and pico. wasnt anything speiclal at all. I prefer my burro's to not be cut in half considering its a burrito not a PB&J.  The salsas didnt have a lot of flavor. The hot salsa had a good heat to it but just not much flavor. I found myself using the green salsa the most.    On the upside i had an ice cold Victoria that made up for it all. I would go back and try the fish tacos i suppose"}
{"text":"First you have the option of ordering from the counter or having sit down service. My family and I wanted the service. Our server was very sweet and efficient! She also kept our drinks full. We started with Chips and Salsa. My husband loved the salsa!I wasn't too crazy about it so I just put cholula on my chips! Yummy!! Everyone was happy with their meals. Dad loved the taco salad. Mom devoured her lobster tacos. The enchiladas were delicious except chicken was a little dry for my taste!! My husband loved his breakfast dish choice so much.   Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Tasty, better than average Mexican food.  I hit this place up on lunch with a coworker and we were both pleasantly surprised.  Their food is all made from scratch (except tortillas), tasty, and seemed fresh.  Prices were reasonable and definitely worth it.    You walk up to the counter and order, then they bring it out to you.  I had their Carnitas \"Guadalajara\" Style... when I asked the owner \"What is Guadalajara style?\" he replied \"Guadalajara style means they're the best carnitas you will ever have\".  Well, how could I say no to that?  Turns out they are slow cooked carnitas, done proper, then deep fried before serving... haha, so good.  I won't say they were the BEST carnitas I've ever had, but they were probably tied for best..... although a bit greasy, obviously.  The beans and rice are nothing special, however the hot sauce and corn tortillas were spot on.  This place is definitely an addition to my lunch rotation."}
{"text":"Went there for takeout lunch on a Saturday late afternoon.We were excited to try something new.  The place was not too busy, but kind of loud because it is an open floor plan. Workers there seemed to be bothered by taking my order. $30 later we got about $15 worth of below average Mexican food,.. I wont be back, you guys gave me no reason to come back."}
{"text":"Pretty dang good Carne Asada for sure. I had the Carne Asada burrito and it was tasty. Comes with chips and salsa for 6 something. Not bad. Filled me up. No rice in the burrito which I like. Just meat and some grilled veggies. Service was good. Pretty fast and they handed my food right to me. They have Orchata on tap including a piña colada mixed one. Pretty tasty. The building is a bit small, but it's nice and clean inside. I wouldn't go out of my way to go here but I'd go if I was in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I only have one word for this place, yummy. Love the Victoria on tap. Best Mex in the area. Great red sauce."}
{"text":"This place is awful. The food is mediocre at best. If I wanted mediocre Mexican food with no service, I would've just went to Arriba's down the corner. I found the food to be saturated with lard and just overall, horrible. The only bright side to this place is that it's cheap. If price isn't an issue, I'd recommend Los Sombreros, right down the road on Northsight. For one, you get service, two the food is better, but it is more expensive."}
{"text":"They went above and beyond to accommodate my dairy allergy, they made me a Mexican dairy free desert (buenuellos) and I loved them so much, as well as my meal! -a forever costumer :)"}
{"text":"Just had lunch there today @ 11:25 (on a Monday) or so. I give a specific time because boy was it packed in there. When I got there the line was a just out the door. The food was great! Wife had fish tacos and I had carnitas de jalisco.  Food was great, seriously. Just too bad the seating is limited and it's a popular place to eat obviously. Staff was pretty friendly with a genuine smile."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch the other day.  I wasn't expecting much, but when my coworker and I got there, the parking lot was packed.  It must be a decent place.  There was a line to the door, but it moved pretty quickly. I got a chicken burrito. My coworker got the carnitas.  We both enjoyed the burritos.    I was a little worried at first because the chicken was Cheeto orange. I don't know what sort of spice mixture they soak it in to make it that color, but it tasted just fine.   The drink menu was just cans of soda in a cooler. I'm not a fan of places that do that. I like a fountain drink. I like free refills. Around lunch, I need all the caffeine I can get to make it through the remainder of the afternoon.  I don't have anything bad to say about this place. Like Chipotle, Qdoba, Burrachos, and Pancheros, it does what you'd expect.  It's not really better or worse than the others, but I would go back."}
{"text":"We love the food and the people are great.  We've ordered a dozen tamales (delicious!) from them a few times, and they've been very accomodating (just order a day or two in advance)."}
{"text":"Habaneros has some good stuff. I enjoy the carne asada burros and tacos. I've gone with people who have gotten the breakfast burrito before and they loved it. A buddy always gets the taco salad, he says it's the best! Friendly staff and pretty quick service keep us coming back for more."}
{"text":"Passed by this place a few times & finally decided to give it a try... Not regretting it! This is def the most authentic Mexi food I've eaten in No-Sco. Had the carne asada burrito and horchata (: left happy. This experience was bueno! I'll be back to try more!"}
{"text":"I really don't know how to review Habanero's.  In my opinion, it was just kinda blah and stale. I guess I thought my burrito was ok. They slapped my burrito together from ingredients that were being kept lukewarm on a buffet table. No salsa and chips, or condiments at the table. I was also disappointed that they did not offer half orders. I also thought that Habanero's was kind of pricey for what you received. For the same cost, you could eat at a nicer Mexican restaurant with complimentary chips and salsa, fresh food, and a much more inviting atmosphere."}
{"text":"I'm wavering between 3 stars and 4 stars. I'm leaning towards 4 because I think I brought the unhappiness upon myself. Meaning, I got something too spicy for me to handle. Regrets.  It's Chipotle-styled ordering. There are a few things you can choose from, then you pick what you want in it. I decided to get the tacos with chicken. The chicken was like bright orange, so I think it was spiced heavily. And then I thought, cool, I'd like to try the hot sauce too. So in addition to the already spicy chicken, I decided to add more spice on top of it. Did I mention I can't handle that much spice?  The tacos were good. I tried my best to eat as much as I could without dying. They give an ample amount of food, so yay."}
{"text":"This place has delicious food. I had the parrillada for the first time and it was fantastic! My wife had the chicken quesadilla and said it was one of the best she's ever had. The music was a bit too loud for my liking, but the overall dining experience was very enjoyable. If you want great food but do not want to wait a long time, this is your place."}
{"text":"I always make sure I stop into Habanero's when I am in the area. It is a great stop for lunch because you can get in and out quick. You order at the counter and they have seating if you choose to stay. The building and interior are nothing special but the food is fantastic!   My go to is always the 3 taco meal. I get corn tortillas which are warmed up on the spot and then have them pile on spicy pork. It has a kick, but these are indeed the best pork tacos I have had. Then you get to choose what beans, veggies, salsa, sour cream, guacamole, etc. you want. Make sure you get an order of chips and salsa on the side. They also offer Mexican beer and margaritas, but I have never tried them because I typically go over the lunch hour. Soft and bottles drinks are available.   The staff is always friendly and cracking jokes between themselves and with the customers. If you are looking for great quality Mexican food, this is the place!"}
{"text":"I read the reviews before trying Habanero's. For the most part, they were accurate. Good food for the price, friendly service, nice dining area, and ample portions."}
{"text":"Eek! Methinks not. Very very bland salsa. Tastes close to water with a hint of cayenne and stale chips! I had to season them with salt to at least taste something a bit. I had breakfast steak burrito. Hubby is right. Sonic's tastes better. We expected good food because of the 4-star reviews in average but left disappointed and wont be coming back nor be recommending this place to friends."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the service was great!  Even though there were a few mistakes they were very polite and quick to fix everything. We would definitely go back. The restaurant was clean and felt very welcoming. Thank you for a great lunch!!"}
{"text":"Great Quality. Fresh ingredients and good meat. Tried The Carne Asada burrito amazing"}
{"text":"This is a great neighborhood spot for some traditional Sonoran Mexican food.  I usually get the Blackened Chicken or shrimp burrito and it is always very consistent and good. They make all their own salsas and they are very good. The habanero sauce is their hottest and it has a good kick but nothing crazy hot. Good place and a good price."}
{"text":"Delicious food, excellent service, and quick for fresh food. We had the vegetarian bowl; no cheese and no meat and it was GREAT! You know the seasoning is right when you don't miss the meat or cheese. The portions were perfect, as well. As return customers, though, we hate their hours. This place closes super early and when we've come within their last 30 minutes of business hours they have turned us away."}
{"text":"Even though Habanero's Mexican Grill is located inside, the place reminds us more of a Sidewalk cafe with very friendly waitresses.  Mainly because it is located in small strip mall with glass covering the front of the establishment.  You don't come here for the ambiance or for a fancy meal.  Just like a Sidewalk cafe, you come here for simple food served quickly and to enjoy the company of the friends your eating with.  Other terms that might help to describe Habanero's are hole-in-the-wall or mom and pop.  They've got \"Cantina\" stuck on their logo and they do have some nice Happy Hour (3-6pm) prices on their draft beers.  I ordered the Steak a la Mexicana, which was slightly disappointing.  When I've ordered this dish at other similar restaurants (Even at places in Mexico), I've always received a whole piece of meat.  At Habanero's, they serve this dish Fajita style with the meat sliced up.  On top of that, the meat was very tough.  Overall, I enjoyed the dish, but those two complaints kinda ruined the food for me.  My wife had the Chiles Rellanos, which she enjoyed.  We always share and she agreed with my complaints and I thought her dish was average.  Also, we ordered a Blackened Fish and a Carne Asada soft shell corn tacos to try.  We prefered the Carne Asada over the FIsh, but liked them both.  Our favorite part of the meal was the side of chips, salsa, & guacamole.  It came with three sauces and our waitress, thoughtfully, brought us a forth spicier salsa.  The quac was fresh and the salsas were great on the chips, but even better as toppings on the tacos.  The biggest complaint is that they don't give you an itemized bill and our final bill was higher than we'd expected.  We assume that they charge for the side of chips, salsa, & guacamole, for extra tortillas, and that they didn't give us the Happy Hour price on our drafts.  When a waitress asks, \"Do you want Chips & Salsa?\" you typically don't expect to pay for it.  Overall, we enjoyed our meal, the place was clean, and the employees were really friendly.  This would be a great place for a fast lunch or a quick, easy dinner for a busy family or couple in a hurry.  We hate leaving this place with the three star rating, but there is a ton of competition in the area."}
{"text":"Went to Arizona and found myself some bomb-as mexican food!  Here's what I got:  (1) Pork Taco - 4 stars! (2) Pork Taco - 4 stars!  **OVERALL: Yup, I got double pork tacos! NOMS!"}
{"text":"I was debating 3 or 4 stars. I pushing 4 stars for the value. I thought the guacamole was excellent and the green salsa was really tasty. I had a carne taco and a carnitas taco, both were decent but the amount of food your get for the price is unreal. I think I will give them another try and go for a blackened taco. Overall, I thought everything was lacking salt; from the salsas, to the chips, to the guac. I tried the ceviche but I believe there was some imitation crab meat in it. In my opinion, leave the fake crabmeat out and just do veggies and shrimp, also spice it up a bit. The employees/owners are super nice people. Also, I wouldn't say its a hole in the wall by any means. The place is pretty nice."}
{"text":"We came here after visiting Phoestivus downtown.  This place is a real gem.  The food was great, highly recommend the Fajita Burrito's and they were super friendly.  I hope this place becomes a staple of downtown!"}
{"text":"What a cute hidden gem!  We were looking for some quick, traditional mexican food in Scottsdale.  We started looking at reviews and decided.... let's take a chance!    First off, you'll have to look for it - its in a shopping center/strip mall so we passed by it once.  Keep your eyes open!  Now let's talk about experience.  Let's start with the atmosphere.  As you walk in, there's the counter to order and on the left... about 9 small tables.  It's definitely set up more as a fast food style service.  I wouldn't go here to spend an entire evening sipping on margaritas - Cantina Laredo would do for that - but this place has become a staple due to the experience and food.  I'd say... think a local version of Rubios.  We've also had great service -  always nice, smiling, and making sure we're happy.  That alone makes getting quick food nice and more relaxed - although lunch can get crowded.  The food: pretty darn good - quite a surprise.  We've tried the carne asada burrito, quesadillas, fajitas.  I love their guacamole which is a great addition to a burrito.  It's also nice not to have it filled with rice, beans, instead of protein - they are quite the opposite and generous on the filling.  Cons:  Their salsa is pretty runny and not quite exciting.  Nothing to write home about.  Overall, fun little place.  Great for a quick bite and I will keep coming back"}
{"text":"Little hole in the wall restaurant serving authentic and flavorful Mexican food! Everything was sooooooo good and the service was quick considering the quality of the food. I highly recommend the parillada plate so you can get a little taste of everything. It was ALL delicious! Margaritas were great!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in town. Authentic, affordable, and excellent service. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"This place is great!  Definitely the best Mexican Food in Madison.  Barbacoa and pastor tacos on corn tortilla shells are the best I have had.  The carnitas were a little dry the last time I went but the other meats made up for it.  The guys that work there are also really friendly and every thing is fast and fresh!"}
{"text":"The tacos are excellent here and I'd give 4 stars if the service was speedier and if my ground beef taco was served with more toppings than just lettuce. (It was supposed to come with pico de gallo and cheese as well.) I waited for over 20 minutes for my food (too long for a fast food joint), watching as food was delivered to two tables of customers who had arrived after me.   They need to come up with a better system of food delivery, with no numbers given or names taken and restaurant workers wandering from table to table, asking, \"Did you order this?\"  Still, the tacos are excellent and I'll be back. The crunchy corn tortilla taco shells are best. Soft corn and soft flour are available as well. I hope I get better service next time!"}
{"text":"Watery, watery salsa.  In fact, it's too watery to be considered a hot \"sauce\" because even that has some measure of thickness to it.  It's odd that it is paired with chips, because the chips cannot hold any of it as it runs off immediately.    Such a bold name to have too - Habanero's.  So the food may be spicy, right?  No.  Even the \"hot salsa\" which is allegedly made with Habanero is medium at best.  This isn't some macho claim that it's not hot enough for me personally; no, it's really not anything like a typical salsa with habanero ingredients.  When the food leans mild it's all to easy to label it as a gringo place, but even more so when it's under the pretense of being a place with some spicy Habanero ingredients.  Service was incredibly slow, and it's another one of those places where it's ambiguous if you sit down for service, or order at the counter.    Food was above average, served hot, and in a reasonable portion size for the price.  That's the main positive for this place - that the food is good and worth tolerating the other issues.  It's just not an overall great experience here."}
{"text":"Finding a good Torta (Mexican Sandwhich), taco and burrito at a fair price has been quite a challenge here in Wisconsin. That was of course, until I found Habanero's.   This gem will soon have a second location to offer their extremely yummy food to Wisconsinites, perfectly located across the street from the Mallards Stadium.  The waitstaff are all very friendly and eager to make sure you enjoy your dining experience.   Now to the food. Their three taco plate is quite the value when you witness how much meat they pack into either your corn or flour tortillas. But it doesn't stop there. You then have several, 11, additional toppings to choose from. Your usual onions, cilantro, tomato, guacamole, sour cream, cheese, lettuce and four different salsas; Green salsa, red salsa, corn salsa and an onion habanero mix (the more habanero slices you get with your onions the spicier it will be).  Now if you order a burrito, you also have rice, black beans, pinto beans and fajita mix (onion and bell pepper) to choose from.   The torta sandwhich is equally as yummy and if you are there shortly after they open they offer the choice to add a fried egg to it. Super yummy.  And as far as meat is concerned, you have options. Chicken, Carne Asada (Marinated Steak), Barbacoa (Shredded Beef), Al Pastor (Marinated Pork), Carnitas and for those looking for a vegetarian option fajitas (grilled onion and bell peppers).  For drinks they have bottled and canned soda varieties as well as water. They also offer beer. But if you are here, you might as well try their delicious Orchata (Rice Milk with cinnamon) or juice beverage that they make fresh.  Their value really comes through each time you purchase a three taco, burrito or quesadilla you get a stamp on your Habanero card. After your 9th purchase the next one is on them.   I usually order the three corn tacos with steak, onions, cilantro, red and green salsa and the onion and habanero mix. My wife will get hers the same way but with just the red salsa, instead of green and add tomato, guacamole, cheese and sour cream. Craving these right about now.  For my burrito I'll get it with the barbacoa or steak, black beans, onions, cilantro, tomato, all four salsa's and guacamole. Delicious and perfect before or after a long run.  For my torta, I'll get it with steak or barbacoa and a fried egg (usually get it in the am), black beans, onion, cilantro, tomato, lettuce, all four salsas and guacamole. Super yum.  Coming from California where there are mexican taco shops everywhere this is as good as they come. Very authentic."}
{"text":"As others have written, this place is like QDoba, but much more authentic.  You order your food and they prepare it as you move down the line. Five of us had dinner on a cold Friday evening and there were no complaints. I had a torta - I have never had one - and it was delicious. It comes on an enormous grilled bun and then I topped it with carnitas, rice, black beans, salsa verde and cheese. I could only finish about half of it, definitely worth the price!  Others in our party had the tacos and burritos and everyone said their food was tasty. Tacos can be ordered either on corn or flour tortillas. The chicken, as others have reviewed, is a strange blaze orange color, but the taste was good. Beer, Margaritas and sodas in the can are available. The Margaritas are pre-mixed in a dispenser, so I went with a beer.  The two men working behind the counter were fast and friendly. If we find our selves near Stoughton Rd., we will definitely return to try other menu items."}
{"text":"Here is the story of how we fell in love with a little Mexican restaurant called Habanero's:   Friday: Did a random yelp search for Mexican food in the Scottsdale area and stumbled upon some decent reviews for this place. Decided to try it out since it's not too far. After a slight detour we finally found a little unassuming store front in a generic looking shopping plaza with a red, white and green banner in front and knew that we must have finally found it. Ordered some flour tacos (fish, carne asada, shrimp, and carnitas) and a steak quesadilla along with a side of chips and salsa and our beloved Orange Bang drink that we were pleasantly surprised to find here. Within a few minutes of taking our first bites we turned to each other and proclaimed, \"This shit is good!!\" Fresh Mexican food that was reasonably priced and not overloaded with grease!! We were officially in lust.   Saturday: Couldn't stop thinking about how good Habanero's was from the night before and made plans to stop by for breakfast the next morning and try some of their breakfast burritos.   Sunday: Stopped by to grab a few breakfast burritos before our road tip to eat in the car. Bacon and steak burritos were delicious and not greasy at all, just like the rest of the menu. Egg, potatoes, meat and cheese in a fresh tortilla make these burritos worth coming back for again! And, breakfast served all day during the weekdays! Sweet!   Monday: Craving Habanero's again and we even made plans to stop by on our way back into town. Unfortunately for us, they closed early for the holiday, but we were more determined than ever to get our fix in the next day! Nothing could keep these star crossed lovers apart!   Tuesday: The craving was almost unbearable at this point. As soon as we got off of work we headed over to our new favorite place to pick up some tacos and another breakfast burrito. We were not disappointed, everything was just as amazing as the last few times we had visited. Habaneros can do no wrong!   So there you have it...if you're in the north Scottsdale area and craving some fresh authentic Mexican food that won't break the bank then head over to Habanero's and you'll be falling in love in no time at all!"}
{"text":"I stopped in Habanero's today and had the daily special, a Chicken Fajita Quesadilla. It was great, bright cruchy veggies, great chicken and a side of sour cream and Guac. I will defintely be back soon."}
{"text":"Habeneros is just like Chipotle and Qdoba. Seems that this concept is new to Madison based on the other reviews implying that this dining experience is a new one for them.  Coming from Denver where excellent Mexican food is common, this meal was good but not a stand-out.  Tasty overall.  Generous with the portion of meat and able to add unlimited toppings without any extra cost.  A good place for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"A customer tipped me off to this restaurant, and I could just kiss her for the recommendation!  Knowing we were going to be short staffed the following morning, I order two chorizo breakfast burritos. Those were divine! Solid spiciness and full of flavor, these breakfast burritos are served all day, kids. And that's a terrific thing. Because sometimes you just want breakfast for dinner.  The chile relleno was fantastic! Seriously good eats. The rice and black beans were equally delicious."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with some coworkers.  The place was pretty packed - we waited about 20 minutes for our food to finally come out.  The food was pretty decent.  I had the chicken fajita and it was very tasty and made me very full.  I'll try the nachos next time as my coworker had it and it looked fantastic!"}
{"text":"This was our first time at this restaurant and definitely will not be our last. It was outstanding and I'm so excited to finally give a restaurant five stars. Everything we ate was delicious and the service was wonderful.  The restaurant itself might look like a hole in the wall but it's definitely worth it.  This is going to be our choice for Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Great food and margarita, very reasonable prices. The house margarita is huge and pretty decent and the service is good."}
{"text":"First visit here and it won't be the last!  Nothing fancy, but very clean and bright.  Colorfully decorated.  Food was great (blackened shrimp tacos and calamari tacos).  Pacifico on tap and very good margueritas.  Anxious to return and try several other menu choices.    Service was OUTSTANDING!!"}
{"text":"Aqui encontraras un servicio excelente! Very friendly staff and delicious food as well. Food is made to order in plain view which i always enjoy. I tried the carnitas burrito enchilada style and loved it."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for over a year but sadly have only had one item... Carne Asada Burrito.  This is THE BEST carne asada burrito I have ever had!"}
{"text":"Sunday night I was craving spicy, and was rather cranky about it.  Hubby went here, and brought me home some kind of burrito bowl thingy with spicy habanero onions, pork, corn, rice, sour cream, etc. It was fantastic!  Emergency situation (removal of hubby's face) averted!  Thank you Habaneros!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I make it a point to always make a visit when I'm in Scottsdale. Staff is always friendly and  the food is very authentic to my taste yet it's not so greasy"}
