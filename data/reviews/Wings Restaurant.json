{"text":"I recently visited wings restaurant and was very pleased with the food and the customer service. The quality and quantity you get for your money is impressive. I ordered the wing combo and it came with 6 decently sized wings with a good amount of meat on the bone, french fries, celery and carrots, dipping sauce and a medium sized beverage. The price was right around $7.00. Other wing restaurants like to charge additional for sides and dipping sauces, so the price for everything came as a shock.  The staff was very friendly and went above and beyond to ensure I was satisfied with my meal. I highly recommend giving this restaurant a try to satisfy your wings cravings....you will not be disappointed ."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time at this wing place; the sign says best wing in town...umm I think not! My daughter wanted some chicken wings so I took her here since we were around the neighborhood. We ordered a number 2 which came with 15 chicken wings with your choice of 2 flavors (got the Garlic Parmesan and mild), fries and a large drink. The garlic Parmesan was okay and the mild lacked some flavor. The fries were decent they were perfectly seasoned. 

The service was okay considering the fact that there was only one person working and tables needed to be cleaned. There was one table that was clean and that's where we decided to sit. The tables didn't even get cleaned the whole time we were there so if people wanted to eat there they have to request to get the table cleaned."}
{"text":"First time eating here.  We ordered mild, hot garlic, and Cajun kickers wings.  They were good, but not very spicy.  My husband loved the fries.  It takes a while because they made it fresh.  The guy behind the counter was very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I give it one star because the fries were pretty good. A little soggy, but seasoned well. The Chicken Fingers were ok. Got the Cajun flavor and it was hot sauce with Cajun sprinkled on top. Not special. When you walk in it was very awkward. No music. No TV. Dead silence. Wasn't greeted until a couple moments. Only one employee. She took the order and cooked it. She was very nice. Just.. So quiet in there. If your going to try this place. Take fries to go."}
{"text":"I've come here a handful of times already, I always get the #1 combo.

It's almost impossible for me to find a place that does lemon pepper correctly. This place actually coats the chicken in lemon pepper before its fried and after.  So eating it is awesome cause I actually get the Damn lemon pepper.

The veggies are always fresh, but the reason I gave it a 4 and not a 5 is because my bf who loves the wings here also, pointed out 2 things, the isn't very much on flavor and the fries could be a bit seasoned.

All in all the place is amazing though and he only noticed those two things cause he dips his fries in ranch."}
{"text":"Wings are nothing special, sauces are bland, and the food is overpriced, I do not recommend this place"}
{"text":"There are better hole-in-the-walls out there. Go next door to the Taco shop if you can't decide what to eat."}
{"text":"How should i get started, first of all, the korean lady (owner) willl try to over charge u without the customer noticing and will try to give u the smallest portion she could give u. Then the people she be hiring are always on drugs because their eyes are always red and also she doesnt want to pay the minium wage she rips off her employees a lot so i would never go to that place ever again i rather starve to death!!!!!!  Ps someone needs to call the health department on this wings place bcz if not i will throw up if i see those NASTY korean wings ever again!!!"}
{"text":"Can't do less then one star I guess, I literally made this account for this review. I order a number 2 asked for them to be mild and bbq I got hot and lemon pepper I asked for the fries to been well done they were soggy. I waited almost 30 mins also I don't even think my wings were cooked all the way I took one bite and refused to eat anymore and threw the rest away also their ranch taste like they bought it from the Walmart across the parking lot. I will not be going there again any time soon."}
{"text":"Under new ownership and I must say they are very pleasant people.  The wings are amazing and  made to order. Must try \"Sweet Chile Wings\" they are my favorite!"}
{"text":"Had a taste for wings. . Googled this place the web said it closed at 11p.m. .. we get there at 10 p.m. the lady in the front tells us she cant serve us because they are closing an hour early because business is slow..  kinda disappointing but thanks anyway"}
{"text":"So I really felt like wings today! 2 bad I got them from this place. I ordered the combo meal for $11.99 which comes with 12 wings,fries, a soda and one dipping sauce. Price wise great flavor and texture not so great. My fries were very soft and my wings were soggy(the spicy ones). The garlic parm did not have much flavor or any Parmesan on them at all. Just fried wings with butter melted on them.  I ate some I don't like wasting my food so I will finish later. I will not eat here again and I don't recommend this place either"}
{"text":"The first time I went here it was good, but I feel that it is swiftly going down hill. I went with 3 other people and we got 3 separate orders, but the people who worked there somehow managed to get each order wrong. The trash can was spilling out all over the floor. You would think they would empty the think. You would be better off walking across the parking lot to Geisha Steakhouse."}
{"text":"We ordered the 30pc special, which included an order of fries, medium ranch dressing and 2 drinks for $22.95. We got the Lemon Pepper, Garlic Parmesan and Hot &  Sweet wings. The Lemon pepper were the best out of the three.  They had a pretty good flavor to them. The garlic parmesan were pretty plan. Not very garlicky or parmesany. The Hot & Sweet were neither hot or sweet. The wings overall were a bit on the dry side. Maybe a little overcooked. The fries were ok. We also ordered an order of the Funnel Cake fries but the picture looked better than what they really tasted like. Overall, I think I'll get my wings elsewhere."}
{"text":"Classy Professional. My new place. Stumbling distance from home. Highly recommend. Draft craft beer. Zwie bieren bitter."}
{"text":"Walked in there and ordered lunch for me and my son. My shoes stuck to the floor, tables were so dirty my arms stuck to the table. Trash can had gross slime dripping down the side. I didn't even ask for my money back. I told lady , this was the most  filthy restaurant I ever been in , in Vegas and left."}
{"text":"What a joke! The best wings in Vegas my ass! I have never had bad French fries in my life! These were absolutely terrible! They were soggy and way too greasy! The wings were okay, nothing special but I can make wings better than this place! And all the workers there are defiantly on drugs!! They were forgetful and looked like they were on drugs! One of the guys the forgot one of our fry offers then has the nerve to charge me for an extra ranch and an additional tip which we had already tipped! I have never met someone who pretty much begged for a tip! He just  kept on asking for a tip! Ugh! I will NEVER eat here again! Absolutely horrible customer service and horrible food! Do not go here!"}
{"text":"Despite the bad reviews here on Yelp, I was in the area and craved chicken wings. 
Got the wings & tenders combo. Totally gross! The wings tasted like cardboard and the tenders tasted like dirty socks. It was soaked in oil. A cholesterol overdose. 
The fries were ok. It was disgusting."}
{"text":"If i could give this place zero stars I would. My family ordered almost $80 worth of wings in a variety of flavors(sauces) for a party we were having. When my husband brought it home he realized that the ENTIRE order was wrong. It was several orders of bone-in teriyaki flavored wings when we had ordered all fingers with several different sauces. We immediately called and explained the situation to the cashier. They took our information and said we could come in any time for a refund or replacement order of the same value. We thought this was great service, but come to find out when we tried to redeem this offer a couple weeks later, we were informed that this was \"not their policy\" and they \"would not honor the offer\" by the manager of this establishment. She was very rude and would not even offer to work with us or compromise.  we will NOT give this place any more business EVER.  terrible customer service is a deal breaker. the food is sub-par in comparison to other wings places. BUYER BEWARE!!!!!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately not measuring up to par when it comes to food quality or service.  

From the moment we walked in we seemed to be bothering the one and only employee. After drawing some information about the sauces out of him, he took our order but never even looked at us.  Then it was back into the kitchen after handling money, but I didn't see him wash his hands.  

Once the food arrived, the \"Cajun Kicker\"wings had no heat to them at all and the \"sweet and spicy\" chicken tenders were bland as well."}
{"text":"I was craving wings and Wing Stop was too far away. I drove by here and thought why not! The sign does say \"best wings in town\". Walked in and the place is dead quiet with no body in sight. A TV was on but no sound. A nice young man came out from the back and was very pleasent. Nothing spectacular. The menu is a bit overwelming. The prices have been changed and re-written over more than once. I was a little confused on what was what so got the number 1 which was 8 wings, fries and a soda (10 bucks). Took 15 mins for the food to cook which was no problem. I''ll wait for fresh food. I took it with me to go and when I got home I realized they are trying to be just like Wing Stop. The fries are exactly the same but the wings are not very good. They seemed freezer burnt when put in the fryer. I got half Cajun half Garlic Parm. The garlic parm had no flavor. Tasted like they were just covered in oil. The Cajun were ok, but nothing special. I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"So I check this place out hoping its at least as good as Wingstop and Buffalo Wildwings. I was pleasanatly surprised. 

Service was decent and the wings were a pretty good size. I ordered the 10 piece combo which came with fries and a drink for about 10 bucks. I chose half of it Spicy Garlic and the other half Sweet and Spicy. I was very impressed with the fries. It was cooked perfectly to the point it was crispy but not burnt. I thought it was definitely better than Wingstop's fries.

So 3 stars for the above mentioned. Minus 1 star because of the location. Its situated in a food court next to Subway and Don Tortaco's. The food court its self is part of a truck stop, which to some people is not too appealing, especially if you want to bring your family to eat chicken wings.

Minus another star because the wings I ordered did not have enough sauce on it. I can taste it but I thought it wasnt enough to coat all the wings. I knew I didnt have enough time for them to make me another batch so next time I will make sure it gets plenty of sauce and I will update this review accordingly.

For more info on the rest of their menu, go to their website, www.wingsrestaurants.com"}
{"text":"We usually love coming here for their chicken wings. Despite the long wait for the chicken to be made, I never really had an issue with this place until our last encounter. 

We ordered to go a 16 piece chicken wings combo. Without looking inside our to go box of chicken we drove home. We opened it and found little chicken wings the size of our fingers. I never seen anything like it before. It was like they used a baby chick.

So we called them. The lady answered and knew automatically who she was talking to when my beau said, \"why did you Give us chicken like this.\" They lady replied with, \"we're closing in 5 days so that's all the chicken we had so we had to \"use it all up\"..\" What does that even mean? Does that mean that this chicken has been sitting in a freezer for days or weeks waiting to be cooked? There's 5 days until you close, so does that mean you're just going to use old chicken? I was very confused and disturbed.  We ended up not eating the chicken.

But moral of the story is.. Always check your food before you leave the place where you got it from."}
{"text":"Have gotten take-out from here twice.  First time wife brought home wings and fries and I liked them very much.  

I logged onto yelp today to locate a wing place and was dismayed to read all the negative reviews.  They're the closest wing place to my house and I did like the food last time so I decided to give them another shot.

Called in my order and the lady who answered the phone was very nice, and even suggested one of their specials to save me some money when she heard what I wanted.

Arrived 15 mins later to pick up my food.  Two people working, both adults.  The nice lady greeted me with a smile and took my money.  I looked into the kitchen and a gentleman was finishing packaging my food.  I heard him say to the lady 'I wasn't sure what to do with the fries' so I am guessing he is new.  

The service was fine despite all the previous reviews, and I suspect it's because there are new adult personnel working the restaurant.

Brought my food home and was very pleased with the quality.  The wings were perfectly cooked and the Buffalo Hot Sauce was tasty (though not notably hot/spicy).  The fries were excellent, some of the best I've had from a quick-stop place.  I saw a huge bag of potatoes in the kitchen so they obviously cut them fresh.  The season them with something so delicious I ate them with no ketchup; they're that good.  The blue cheese dressing is homemade and mine was flavored with a LOT of garlic; never had blue cheese dressing taste like that but it was quite good and I did use some of it on the occasional french fry.

I will definitely return.  Hopefully the owner/manager has gotten his staff straightened out and the food and service stay as good as I experienced today."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant, but the N. Decatur location is TERRIBLE.  They burn the food and even though I've been there several times (the location is very close to where I live) I have never received decent service at this store.  I wonder if the owner even realizes how bad it is.  It will probably go out of business soon.  :(

I strongly encourage people to try the location on Lake Mead & Simmons instead.  They have good service and actually make the wings right!  The seasoned fries are delicious.  If you like spicy, try the Cajun Kickers.  The ranch dressing is delicious."}
{"text":"More than just WINGS! This place has fantastic chicken teriyaki bowls too! The flavor of the spicy teriyaki has the perfect amount of heat and the vegetables are fresh."}
{"text":"The girl at the counter was nice but it took over an hour to get my food n I was the only one in the restaurant.  I only order 2 teriyaki bowls to go"}
{"text":"Best wings in North Las Vegas, garlic Parmesan and lemon N pepper extra crispy. Fries need some work though. Needs some kind of special seasoning. It was too soggy n plain."}
{"text":"The wings were pretty good. The Hellfire ones weren't very hot at all but the flavor was good. The wings could've used a little more sauce. The fries are amazing! Kind of like wingstop fries, but with more flavor.  The wait was really long but there was only one person working when I was there. Definitely need to get more staff working at the same time."}
{"text":"My family and I recently visited this establishment for dinner and we were pleasantly surprised! It is under new ownership and they've done a great job! We tried a little bit of everything, our favorite was the teriyaki bowl but loved the wings as well! My teenage kids have been back a few times to order wings. We will definitely add this restaurant to our favorite neighborhood spots to eat!"}
{"text":"Not good, not even a 1 star but had to select! Wings were greasy (fresh oil change too) they had a strange after taste that doesn't go away.  Pricey however on a positive note the fries with ranch are good.  Question tho...what the heck was the really sticky stuff on the floor...."}
{"text":"Didn't honor our coupon.  I went into the restaurant with a coupon that didn't expire until December 2013 (it was November) and the employee said they were no longer honoring the coupon.  He called someone on the phone to double check (he said it was the owner) and confirmed that I couldn't use my coupon.  Additionally, when I came in the employee was on the phone in what sounded like a personal call.  Truly disappointed in the customer service so we left without ordering anything."}
{"text":"Went with a friend after we had a craving for some wings.  Soon as we walk in, we noticed an empty dinning area and after a few moments noticed a lady sitting in the kitchen ignoring us. She eventually greeted us. Explained the menu. Explained the soda machine was broken and they only had lemonade. It was awkward but we ordered, not realizing we both we thinking about ditching this place. 

Once ordered we had to find a seat. Which should have been easy as the place was empty, but the tables were dirty and gross. At this moment we realized we made a mistake. But it was too late. We decided to give it a shot. 

We sat in silence and watched 3 people walk in and immediately leave. We stared in envy as we wished we could have done the same. 

The food arrives and we ate. The fries weren't bad and they gave me a bunch. The wings were okay. I got the normal buffalo and it was a little sweet for a buffalo sauce. 

The whole experience made this trip a 1 star review.  I will not be returning. Plus the lemonade tasted like crap. So I'm really thirsty now. Thanks Wings Restaurant. For nothing."}
{"text":"Great food!!!!  The food is amazing and the employees are friendly. me and my friends come here often  their prices are reasonable my favorite are the lemon pepper they are delish!!! the PORTIONS ARE BIG and very affordable it makes me want to eat here everyday. 

P.s its under new management so for everyone that said the manager was a rude asian lady guess what she no longer works there WOOHOOO!!! 
and the new manager is way friendlier."}
