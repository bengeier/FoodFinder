{"text":"Had their pizza last night for my sons sleepover. None of the kids ate it and complained that it tasted metallic. It was indeed pretty horrible even for $5.99 per medium. We will never go near the place again."}
{"text":"Great lunch buffet! It doesn't look like much but it actually has a lot on it when you look closer. The pizza dough has a great unique flavor to it that I love. And you can add a huge side salad for $.94! The buffet is very reasonably priced at $6.09. And that price includes the drink! Also try the piggy sticks! Bacon cheesebread and get a six of ranch for dipping! Noms!"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza. Great prices and friendly service. Get it every week. It is the best. Fresh, consistent and a great value."}
{"text":"First I'd like to start by saying that me and my family have been occasionally ordering from here for a couple years now. With that being said, It had been a while, so last weekend we decided to give it a go again. I call in, order our food, and get the same reluctant, \"not happy to help you\" type of vibe that I get from the owner every time I call. It's kinda like this guy just doesn't even care what customers think of his attitude anymore. It wasn't always like this, but iv been ending the phone call in a annoyed mood the last couple times. Besides that, The subs are usually pretty good as well as their pizzas and calzones. The boneless wings on the other hand are bad. It's like someone chopped a bunch of frozen Dino nuggets in half, threw on some Texas Pete and nuked them in the microwave. Eeckkk. Definitely on the hunt for a new place for delivery.."}
{"text":"It gets a 3 only because it was priced well. Stopped in tonight, got a half chicken parm sub, which was ok, and an order of bread sticks. $8. Great value. Bread sticks order was huge. Enough for 4 people. That's where the positive feedback ends. Other than a pick up order, I was the only one in there. Literally 35 minutes from order till I was given my food. 35 minutes for a half of a sub and bread sticks. All I got was a, sorry for the wait. Nothing during the whole time there. Terrible. Sub bread was good, but burnt; maybe that's why it took 35 minutes. Anyway, service was 0 stars;  food was 3 and value was 5 so I give them a 2.5 - 3. Not sure I'd go back, but price is hard to beat, at least what I had."}
{"text":"This has been a staple at our house for years!  Brandon (owner) always did a great job and was very reasonably priced. He sold the business about a month ago. First time we ordered after the change I went to pick up and met the new owners. Nice enough people and the main thing I told them was that they had a great thing and just don't screw with it......Well apparently they weren't listening!!!!  Not that the food is bad now but there is something about it that's just not as good. Subtle change but hey, this place was the Friday night ritual. We figured we'd stick it out. Ordered again tonight though and unfortunately it will be the last time. Our typical order even last week was $21.23. Tonight when ordering the exact same thing as usual we paid $29.32. THATS NEARLY A 40% PRICE INCREASE!!!!!  I was talking to the kids that work there and I really feel for them. They were so apologetic about it but they all seemed to realize exactly what was happening.     40% PRICE INCREASE!!!!!  THAT IS RIDICULOUS!!!!  Doesn't look like we will be back again. Hoping the owners look at these reviews and if they do please reach out to me. You have what was once a super loyal customer for years who will now not go back again until prices change!!!!!  Will be putting this same thing on Next Door app as well. Such a shame!!!"}
{"text":"I don't know how this place makes a profit.  The ingredients seem so fresh and prices are very low.  Best pizza crust.  Cheap lunch specials too"}
{"text":"The cheese sticks are so delicious! I've been eating their cheese sticks for the past 10 years every time I visit my parents. I haven't tried anything else since I always get the sticks, but I'm sure their pizza is also good."}
{"text":"Papa's is the best place in the Weddington area for great pizza at a great price. The staff is always friendly and the pizza is always great!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. I get delivery all the time.  I feel like its better than a lot of other chain pizza places. You can order everything from wings to subs and dessert pizza (never had that) The owner or manager, not sure which one is very nice .  Its located in a strip mall near a Harris Teeter."}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered basic sandwiches and the staff was friendly. However, we waited 20 minutes and they weren't that busy. I could see them making them in the back and they weren't wearing any gloves. I'm a germaphobe so that grossed me out. The sandwiches themselves weren't bad although mine was missing ingredients. Based on the slow service and lax sanitation, I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"good pizza, great price, nice guys"}
{"text":"Best pizza in town!  Well-priced, delicious food, friendly owners, very clean.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"Stopped by next door at Poppy Seed bagels and noticed this small pizza parlor that reminded me of back home NY. Best Pizza in Town and great service."}
{"text":"I'm in Weddington, NC visiting family. We came into Papa's Pizza To-Go for lunch and were impressed with the great quality of the food!! Everything is so fresh and we were able to satisfy everyone in our group.  But what made the experience even better was the great customer service!! Their new day manager Tamara was polite and accomodating. Thomas in the back shouted out Hello and made us vistors feel welcomed. The place has new owners, new staff, and are using fresh new ingredients.  I would highly recommend trying out this great place and say hello to Tamera & Thomas from us in San Francisco!"}
{"text":"A little hole in the wall pizza place. It doesn't feel like a chain and it was nice to see the people making the pizza in the back. Friendly staff. Good quality food that is fresh and delicious"}
{"text":"I ordered pizza for delivery on a Friday night. It took about 40 minutes for the pizza to come.  The ordering experience was good, the person on the phone was really nice and precise.   I got a small round cheese pizza and bambino sticks (which you can do a half order that's not on the menu).  The pizza was good, the breadsticks were delicious!  The come with marinara, but eating them plain is just fine.  They are good all by themselves."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place until the new ownership took over.  It seems as though a few things including  the recipes have changed a bit.  Less cheese, less bacon but the prices are much higher.  I really liked this place as it had a small town feel, but now it is pricing itself out of consideration."}
