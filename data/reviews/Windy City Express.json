{"text":"Is the food here good for you? No. Obviously.  But is the food here *good*? Yessss.  Best thing on the menu, for me, is the lemon pepper catfish. Love that stuff. I also dig the Italian beef and the Philly cheesesteak, and the chicken's pretty good too, not to mention the delicious heap of meat that is the gyro burger. They've even got good fries. (Ask 'em to add the lemon pepper seasoning to those, too. So good.)"}
{"text":"This place is my guilty pleasure. The food is not really healthy but it tastes so good. I try to stay away from this place but I can't. I have probably tried 3/4 of the menu and I haven't had anything I didn't like. Chicken fingers, Italian beef, hamburgers, fish, cheese sticks, shrimp, Philly cheese steak are all great. Mild sauce is just like Chicago. The fries are good too, lightly battered and crispy. Prices are very good. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"You know those days when you just crave some good, greasy, Chicago-style food?? Windy City Express is definitely the place to go!  I've tried their gyros (yum~), philly cheesesteak, hot dog, and chicken fingers and they are all delicious! generous portions too."}
{"text":"I stopped at Windy City Express Sunday for the first time. I asked the person on the other end of the intercom if they served Chicago Dogs, and they replied yes. I was informed  that the Chicago Dogs were on special; two Chicago Dogs, Fries and a Drink for $4.99, so I ordered the special.  When I  arrived home I was very disappointed; what I had was two hot dogs on hot dog buns... Chicago Dogs are Beef Franks (preferably Vienna)  on a Poppyseed Bun with green  pickle relish, chopped onion, tomato wedges, dill pickles and sports peppers sprinkled with Celery Salt..  Windy City Express had  some of the right ingredients, but the wrong Hot Dog and Bun, with no Celery Salt...  I guess for those that have never eaten a real Chicago Dog, they figure that anything will do..."}
{"text":"Everything I have eaten here, has been wonderful.  I will definitely be a repeat customer"}
{"text":"The location doesn't look like much, but don't let that stop you. Great service and awesome food. We came looking for good Chicago dogs and happened to come on the right day for a daily special. So glad we did.  *Edit: RE: Previous reviews stating they didn't get real Chicago dogs, with the exception of the bun, this had all the right veggies and condiments and an all beef dog. It was the real deal."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in town. The fish and chicken wings are especially good and their fries are a few steps above most. It's not \"fast\" food, since everything is cooked to order, but if you want fried food that is significantly better than any chain restaurant in the area, this is probably your best bet.  I'd generally skip the drive through altogether since it does take a while to prepare everything, but the dining room is a fine place to hang out. It's a little rough around the edges, but I happen to find that sort of thing charming."}
{"text":"Placed a large order for wings and asked for lemon pepper seasoning to be added and and order of shrimp.  Got my food home and to my surprise..... no lemon pepper seasoning! Called in to the restaurant and they knew they'd made a mistake but didn't feel that my order was wrong in any way!!!! The manager instead of listening tried to argue and justify!!! Horrible service tonight"}
{"text":"Pretty good cheap cheap food. It's Chicago in spirit, but not authentic by a long shot."}
{"text":"Need fat? Need carbs? Come here. I usually get a steak grinder (or sub I guess) and jalapeno poppers. They do the steak just how it is at home (the East Coast). I trust a place full of construction guys on lunch break. They also have good fried fish."}
{"text":"This place has really good food. The dogs, burgers and my favorite, the Philly Cheese Steak."}
{"text":"My fellow yelpers writing these review are definitely not eatting at 410N Race st.in Urbana or they own or work for it. This place is real bad, really need big house keeping improvments dinning room is dirty. Still gave it a shot, dying for a Chicago dog. The girl taking my and two other costomers order seemed to really have something better to do then wait on us. This is at 12:30 I should have known something was wrong only me and one other guy in the place at lunch time. Seem to be on a down hill slide here. Chicago dog in Urbana 2 hours+or - from Chicago should not be all that hard, but for this place it is impossible. A Chicago hot dog is 1 all beef dog, 1 poppyseed bun, 1 tablespoon yellow mustard, 1 tablespoon sweet green pickle relish, 1 tablespoon chopped onion, 4 tomato wedges, 1 dill pickle spear, 2 sport peppers, 1 dash celery salt.Thats not that hard. Windy city you get the dollar a pack who knows what kind of meat hot dogs you buy at the discount store, and you get it on the 59 cents a package hot dog buns that you also got well you were there. Then you put a few of the things that should be there on, if you get 3 out of 7 you will be lucky.I did ok I at least got 1 little sport pepper on both dogs. One was good, the dog was only about twice its size, so you don't need a lot of them. Once you put half give or take of the stuff that is on a Chicago hot dog on them, you wrap them up let the bun get soggy, and let it all get really cold. Now brake out the onion rings you got at Save Alot, at least they were hot. This place way bad don't even think about it, the cheap dosn't even come close to making up for the bad. So I am a former North Chicago resident living in Champaign county looking for a good dog that will not make me go to campus town. WOW need more reasons not to eat here go to cu-citizenaccess.org and read the Champaign - Urbana Public Health District report on this place."}
{"text":"@ Skip B.  I read the inspection report from 1/24/11 and didn't see anything too serious on there.   There were 5 critical items mentioned.  One was for no date on portioned salad dressings.  I assume \"portioned\" refers to when you pour dressing from the main container into a secondary container for daily use.  The second was for putting fish and fries at convenient locations during lunch rush.  The third was something about the ice drain line, fourth  was some air gap issue with the drive through window, and the last was for a bag of ice melt being stored on the same shelf as food.  When I see a score of 31 I expect there to be spoiled food, dirty/sick employees, rodent infestations and the like.  These are hardly reasons for me to stop enjoying my guilty cheap burger and fry pleasure.    With the previous rant review addressed this place is the best alternative to fast food burger chains.  I have had their burgers, chicken fries, fried okra (!), and fish.  Their fish is surprisingly yummy and burgers should be ordered doubled and split with a friend.   My biggest complaint is that they don't have root beer or ginger ale.  As a result I never order a drink."}
{"text":"First of all, I never write reviews. For anything. It just never seems worth it. This place is worth it. Sometimes you just want cheap food that you know isn't good for you. My personal choice: a cheeseburger and fries. This place NAILS IT. Crispy, delicious fries. Yes, cheese product cheese when you order cheese fries... BUT HOW ELSE CAN YOU EAT CHEESE FRIES?!?! Juicy, well done, charbroiled delicious MEAT (not \"meat\") patties. Solid bun, nothing fancy. American Cheese (because that's how I like it, since we ARE in America). And cheap cheap cheap. I would venture to say my favorite no-frills cheeseburger & fries. Really.  My boyfriend and I first discovered this GEM when he was getting his undergrad here probably around 2006. We instantly fell in love with their CHEAP & delicious cheeseburgers and cheese fries. They even have a deal on Wednesdays where you can get a cheeseburger, fries and a drink for $3.99 OR a double cheeseburger, fries, and drink for $4.99... CHA CHING! We were sold. When we left Champaign we used this place as our last meal, we love it that much. And any time we had an excuse to visit, this was always our place. UNTIL... they closed the location near Parkland. Driving past it's boarded up windows was devastating. Many nights were filled with tossing and turning over this loss... until two days ago when we found the new location. We just about got into an accident, we're thrilled!! We moved back two weeks ago because now I am going to law school here, and while we are disappointed with the new location we are both excited for the many joyful meals to come."}
{"text":"Not impressed, had the 2 Chicago dogs, fries and drink special, the fries automatically smelled like fish before I even opened the bag and were otherwise flavorless, the dogs weren't even borderline decent, no freshness in the veggies, the onions were definitely old and dry, pickles mediocre, and the relish wasn't the neon green that is a definitive piece of Chicago dog. The buns were standard, not the poppy seed variety, and there was no celery salt on the dogs. Even the meat was below average, definitely not a place I'm heading back to even if the special was $5.38 with tax."}
{"text":"My order: double gyro burger w/ fries, mozzarella sticks  I am VERY satisfied with the quantity and price of the food. My burger was humongous.  I didn't expect gourmet and I was very pleased with the taste and quality of everything. Loads of food for an affordable cost.  Don't knock it until you try it."}
{"text":"Best Italian Beef in town, as far as I'm concerned. Awesome fries - they're those lightly battered crispy fries. Serve yourself soft drink refills (which is always a plus for me in a counter service place). I don't know what Skip B is talking about with regard to being dirty. I found this place exceptionally clean. Even the window sills were free from dust. As for the dining room being empty, they seem to have quite a bit of drive through traffic at lunch time. Besides my husband and myself, there were also four other tables full of guys - mainly construction/manual labor type guys.  All in all, it was exactly what I was looking for - a great beef sandwich in CU. YUM!"}
{"text":"A lot of these \"Chicago\" style places are all pretty similar...they try to be something they aren't and don't try very hard to be it so they fail miserably. Chicago style hot dog was missing the real hot dog, instead a cheap supplier like Sysco is used to provide the pitiful, run of the mill, school cafeteria hot dog, the bun came from that same cafeteria as it should be poppy seed, no celery salt used, I could go on but you get the idea. The gyro was, meh, run of the mill. The fries cooked in grease that should have been changed a week ago. Definitely nothing here to bring me back."}
{"text":"For a charburger place, the food is pretty much lame. The burger did not have any tomatoes on it. The chili cheese fries had some sort of disgusting artificial cheese mixed into it. My digestive tract was quite furious with me for subjecting it to such an egregious punishment."}
{"text":"I came by a week ago after an intense work out on my bike and had a wonderful experience! I was still on my bike so I decided to wait in the drive through. The employees recognized me regardless of my alternative mode of transportation and helped me quickly - possibly more quickly than those in motorized vehicles! I ordered the chicken sandwich based on a recommendation. Its basically a big mac or whopper with fried chicken instead of a beef patty and boy did it hit the spot! I will confess that this meal was very greasy. I was craving grease at the moment so it worked out but I don't eat greasy food that often so I did have a bit of a grease induced upset stomach later that night. If you're not craving fat and unhealthy food then I'd probably avoid this place but even us fitness junkies get cravings for unhealthy food from time to time and when that happens, I'd definitely come here."}
{"text":"One of the best \"fast\" food places this whole area. \"Fast\" is the style, but not the speed. Most things are cooked to order (like the hot dogs) and take awhile.  I haven't had a Chicago Style Hot Dog this good anywhere else outside of Chicago. Although they don't have the poppyseed buns (very odd), they are still quite fantastic. And only two bucks!  In general, Windy City is priced competitively. I've had almost everything on their menu once. And it all ranges from good to great--except, oddly, their default hamburgers. The meat is fine but I don't like the way they dress it with only ketchup, mustard, and grilled onions. I will ask them to put lettuce, onion, and tomato with ketchup and mayo on it instead (traditional burger setup) and they are perfectly happy to do so--much better.  Side note: Also highly recommend the Veggie Pita. Awesome value for a great tasting non-meat alternative."}
{"text":"Restaurant review There goes my waist... I've work at the hospital for about a year and was wondering if there was any grease joints around. I'm completely surprised that this is located one street away from the hospital as it has classic Chicago foods including hamburgers, fried fish, hot dogs, and gyros. The food is made fresh to order so you do have to wait a little bit. The owners quite friendly and proud of his food. The first time I went I got a philly cheese steak. It was cooked perfectly and use quality ingredients. There was ample amount of fries with my combo and free refills while you eat in-house. The second time I came was on the weekend and I had their fried chicken and fish special. The chicken tenders are quite heavenly with their own dipping sauce. I went with the honey mustard and left the tribe the barbecue sauce. The food coming out very hot it takes a while to cool off, but you know that the food is fresh. What is surprising about this combo is that you can pick the type of fish you want. This includes tilapia and I believe walleye. My only concern about the fried fish was that it seemed to be over seasoned with the lemon salt. This was served over a bed of fries which was a little bit too much food for me. I may have found my new favorite grease joint in Champaign.  Pros: Cheap inexpensive and fresh food although not the healthiest  Cons: Long wait times especially for their busy  Hidden deals: Their daily meal deals please check out my photos for details  Health code rating: B to C. I don't want to believe the health code rating but they seem to have issues with food temperature http://champaign.il.gegov.com/champaign/estab.cfm?facilityID=1478"}
{"text":"OMG, I want this all the time.  Chicken strips with ranch and fries with mayo have all of the meganutrients I need to thrive, right?"}
