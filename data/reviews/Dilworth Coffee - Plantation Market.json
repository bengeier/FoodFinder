{"text":"Went to this Dilworth  Coffee location after I realized the one in downtown Matthews had closed. ( I was sad about that.)

The space is fine  though small if there was a crowd. The coffee seemed different and not as good.  I've been going to Dilworth for years and something changed.

When I went to get a refill they charge $0.50 which is fine.   But they wouldn't take a credit card because the charge was under a dollar.   No second cup of coffee for me.  Not a big deal but I'm not sure if go back because of the whole experience and the change in the coffee taste.

I went home to get that second cup of coffee I wanted!"}
{"text":"Good, friendly service
Good coffee
Expansive menu
Free wifi"}
{"text":"Great Coffee. Always get their flagship coffee. Morehead. Yum."}
{"text":"Nice little coffee shop with a convenient location. Diverse menu of beverages and a friendly staff. They went out of their way to make me a flat white which wasn't featured on the menu. Dilworth is lacking on the food options, which hurts my chances of returning if I'm looking for both good coffee and food."}
{"text":"Such a cute, little, neat coffee place.  The baristas were cool and easy to talk to.  They did give information on couple specialty drinks when we showed interested to know about them.  They have few tables inside so you can stretch your legs.  They also have couple different pastries which we didn't try but looked good.  I had a cappuccino and wife had a green tea latte. both were great!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite coffee places in Matthews.  Friendly staff and owners, also the cold brew here is great."}
{"text":"Stopped by here this afternoon to have a latte and work for a bit - coffee was good and staff friendly, but the space is small, and it doesn't have that coffee shop vibe that I always look for."}
{"text":"My friend brought me here my first time in Charlotte. I try to go here when I visit during fall and usually for a pumpkin spice latte. yum!
I didn't get to go this time, my friend told me they closed down."}
{"text":"I've always gotten a hot white mocha latte when I come here and no matter who made it(it's been a different barista every time) it has always been consistent! That is actually hard to find with coffee shops, I'm impressed!
I also got a muffin here one of the times I came. I think it would have tasted good if they would've warmed it up first. Either it should just be something they do or should be offered, instead of just sticking it in a bag cold, because it was a little tough. 
I want to give 5 stars, but the tough muffin is what made me lower it to 4."}
{"text":"I love this place. Great location. Amazing speciality coffees. Try the white mocha! Staff is so friendly and kind. I don't really come here to eat, so I can't comment on the pastries, but any place that has kind people and good coffee keeps me coming back!"}
{"text":"My coworkers and I come here frequently. Staff is always friendly and the coffee is great."}
{"text":"Drove out of my way to avoid the socialist $! Enjoyed the Royal Moose Mocha. Clean and comfortable independent gem! I hope you open several more and enjoy huge success! The antithesis of Starbucks, which is part of the overall charm and benefit. If I wanted the McD's of coffee houses I'd just find the nearest Starcracks and choke down some over-roasted, burnt coffee bean juice stained water! My ONLY criticism is that there is not an electrical outlet next to each table to charge your portable electronic device. Now that's how national chains get people to stay longer and buy more drinks and food items per stay. Just visit!"}
{"text":"Cozy little place, Friendly people. Decent Americano. Dean and Deluca still have the best in town."}
{"text":"Cheap, fast, and great quality. Friendly people too. Never gets too crowded. But never empty. Has a nice vibe to it."}
{"text":"Not bad..not what I had hoped, but overall ok.  When I go to a coffee shop, perhaps my expectations are too high.  Perhaps I'm a coffee snob who delights in eclectic, hipster, rare gems, and the joy of something different-ok I am and I do.

The shop was clean and well organized, with two helpful employees up front working very hard.  The feel was more commercial than I like.

My drink, white chocolate mocha latte with almond milk was ok.  Nothing bad, just lack of excitement.  They have many flavors to try, maybe if I'm in the area, I will try something different next time."}
{"text":"Nice little coffee shop with good coffee.  Good smooth flavors on normal coffee, can't say much about foo foo drinks as I just drink coffee.  Flavors are plenty and it's smooth and we'll priced.  

Decent internet, the router could be better but it's a 20+MBS connection.

Fairley quiet, comfortable seating but it is limited."}
{"text":"I love dilworth coffee, this location is just as good coffee wise but the atmosphere and space are lacking. It's just too crowded and in too awkward a location to be a good \"coffee shop\" location. Good for grabbing a nice coffee or latte to go though."}
{"text":"What a wonderful friendly environment!  I absolutely love the way I am always welcomed by the staff here. The barristas always go out of their way to suit your taste. Family favorite for sure!"}
