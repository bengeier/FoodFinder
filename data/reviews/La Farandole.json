{"text":"It's a very good alternative if you wanna have a break on your way back to Montreal. They offer authentic pastries and you can sit at the porch and enjoy a cup of latte"}
{"text":"Ma conjointe à été charmé. Pour ma part, j'ai trouvé qu'il manquait un petit petit quelque chose. L'idée du bar à pain est super. On y retournera à la recherche d'une 4e étoile parce que la raison sociale de l'entreprise est intéressante."}
{"text":"Pretty basic.  Stopped around 2pm but ended up having breakfast. Eggs were runny and plate was simple diner fare. I had to chase my waitress down for a simple cup of coffee. What annoyed me the most were the number of flies (not mosquitoes) that are all over the terrace. Makes me wonder why. Probably OK for a quick coffee and a pastry."}
{"text":"We had a fantastic brunch here. It is a very beautiful place easily accessible and has a small parking behind the restaurant. There is a cosy small balcony. Indoor is well ventilated. The food is amazing. They have several healthy and vegetarian/vegan options. Staff are overloaded because in a busy weekend there are tourists around and two persons is not enough for that but they are always smiling and polite. English and French is okay. Prices are incredibly low and the cheff us generous in making your plate full of fruits and nuts. I will definitely go there again."}
{"text":"Toujours plaisant d'y arrêter que ce soit pour déjeûner, dîner ou un simple petit café.
(et les croissants sont à s'en mordre les lèvres)

Ensoleillez votre journée :)

Always fun to stop there weather it is for breakfast, lunch or a simple coffee
(and there croissants are to live for!)

Bring some sunshine into your day!"}
{"text":"This bakery was a very pleasant find on a cold winter getaway.

Based on online reviews, we decided to try to place with my girlfriend for brunch and right from the start we were happy to find such a cozy and warm inside. 

Service was very good, we did not wait long for our drinks or for our food and the service was attentive. The place wasn't full around 11:30 which is always welcome when going brunching!

We shared the mushroom cassolette and the ham and brie eggs benedict. Both were very tasty and the portions were generous (especially given the reasonable prices). Everything on the menu looked great and it was hard to decide on one item.

On our way out we noticed the bakery downstairs had some very nice looking yule log (buche de noel) and decided to get two for later. These were absolutely amazing!! This made me decide to drive by the next day to pick up some chocolate croissants for breakfast and these were also great. 

All in, a great atmosphere, very good food and great service at an almost affordable price. I highly recommend this gem."}
{"text":"Du bon pain, viennoiseries, gâteaux, chocolats, café, thé, etc, etc.

Et un très bon endroit pour déjeuner dans la région. Ou tout simplement pour venir prendre un café, une soupe ou un repas léger.

Ajoutez à cela du personnel fort accueillant et souriant! Difficile de ne pas tomber sous le charme. 

Vraiment charmant comme endroit!
