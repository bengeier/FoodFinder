Best BBQs in Toronto!"}
{"text":"I used to pick up bbq duck every Saturday afternoon til one time they sold me a stale dated bbq duck, it was very bad quality, just one bite I could tell! Will definitely die if I kept eating it!!! Brought home already and didn't bother to go all the way there to do refund so I throw the whole duck away! Its great that it is permanently closed!!! Hooray!!!"}
{"text":"While I don't think this Yung Kee BBQ is officially related to the one in Hong Kong, the BBQ here is very, very good.  It is currently my favourite Chinese BBQ take out store in Markham/Richmond Hill area, because of the quality across the various meat types and the consistency.

Over the years, I have eaten BBQ pork, roast pork, roast duck and soy sauce chicken here.   They have all been succulent, juicy, bold flavored, nice color, nice plating, reasonable portion.  The flavors of the marinates seep deep into the meat.   The meat is never dry.  

Some may find the pork and duck here fattier than other BBQ stores.  This IS how the Chinese BBQ is supposed to be traditionally.  This is the type of BBQ I grew up with.  This local gem prepares its food the old fashioned way.  

There is a reasonable dining area, so dine-in customers don't have to eat in food court.  Yung Kee also sells dry Chinese sausages, ducks, pork bellies, etc.."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch by myself today as I had to run some errands in Market Village.

The Roast Pork was really really good!!!!!

I used to come here for every single weekend for fast lunch with my family.. Standard order was soy chicken rice combo!! Chatted with owners, turns out they are new owners..

Looked around this time, the BBQ pork looked good..

Ordered my usually duck and BBQ pork rice combo. No house sauce but with onion-ginger sauce on the side.

Similar to the reviews posted by others, the duck was under portioned.. But it was tasty (3 stars)

The BBQ pork however was really good (as I mentioned previously). The skin was perfectly crispy and I had the option of how fatty I wanted it..

Rice was ok, 3 stars, not a generous portion of veggies tho..

Come here and get the BBQ Pork!
Considering to order a roasted baby pork if I need one in the near future, price would be $180 each.."}
{"text":"Swindled!!!!! Beware if you are visiting the area as tourist trying bbq, we ordered half a roast goose and we got a lot less. They put few pieces of chicken wings under to make it look like you are getting a full order and we don't have the thigh. Terrible business!#!#!!?!??"}
