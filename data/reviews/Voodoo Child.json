{"text":"This place, which lacks a name on the outside is actually amazing. I stumbled upon it on a rain soaked Sunday while disappointed by the line at A&Us. I stumbled in to this place and was greeted by delicious smelling coffee and a very simple menu. With only 3 items it was surprisingly hard to pick which sounded the best. I ended up settling on the Croque Madame while my partner got the bacon pancakes.

Now... Let me tell you something about these brunch plates. They were simply put together but tasted so fresh and so delicious! 

The downside: the place is small so get there early (I feel like this place will get very popular, soon) and the service was a bit slow. So grab a coffee, take a seat and make sure you have some good company!"}
{"text":"Super tasty coffee and lovely service! The fact that they use two shots in all their coffees, offer two different beans and know what a flat white is tells me these guys know what they are doing!"}
{"text":"Until a week ago I would have given this cafe a 5 star rating. In fact I have given it a 5 star rating to numerous friends and family. Voodoo used to feel like my own little coffee shop where I could take my friends and have great food and coffee. Perhaps there has been a recent change of ownership or something but the vibe of Voodoo child has changed and not for the good. About a week ago I went into the shop and order my coffee. I paid with 1 loonie, 1 toonie and some small change for a 3.75 coffee. The barista proceeded to tell me that they do not accept small coins. That was my coffee money how else am I support to pay for a 3.75 coffee. it was a little annoying but I paid. That was different I thought. I have never had a coffee shop tell me I can't pay for coffee, a product that usually costs less then $5.00 around the city. So I went again. Same barista same issue. 1 loonie, 1 toonie, 5 nickels, 5 dimes = 3.75 but not a voodoo child. they won't take your money. in fact they gave my back my change. Thanks voodoo child for the 75 cents but here is my 2 cents. work on your customer service because you just lost a loyal customer."}
{"text":"Nice. I like it.

Good staff. I like the music. Can't really focus here. 

Good to hangout for a bit.

Nice, french press coffee and cold-brewed coffee.

It's pretty cool. And I like it. Will return when in the area, for serious. 

Better than a lot of what's near."}
{"text":"The voodoo child great place atmosphere is very comfortable I had the apple French toast and it was heavenly and the staff was very friendly"}
{"text":"I came for a breakfast. I was a little bit dissappointed cause the only breakfast offer was bagel. However it was awesome, hot bagel with nutella. I died and went to heaven! And only because how easy it was! This espresso I got had everything. It was sexy stylish espresso! That teaspoon - that killed me! Awesome! Guy on the bar was kinda nice, he was from Persian. But didn't want to talk much. If you are looking for something easy, come here. But my opinion is that offer could be wider..."}
{"text":"I love Voodoo Child. The warmest feeling, always have a great time here. Trust me, you'll love it too"}
{"text":"Loved it! Highly recommend the cortado which is the only drink that comes in a skull glass. Delicious! The space is small but cute and close to other shops and public transport. There seemed to be a lot of locals inside and the woman who made our coffee was very helpful!"}
{"text":"I am so happy we stumbled across this place! I've been struggling to find decent espresso-based drinks since moving from Melbourne to Toronto. This is it.

The cappuccino is spot on - not too much milk, great flavor, nicely steamed whole milk that has a creamy consistency. We drive from Etobicoke just to get a coffee from here on the weekends.

My roommate gets the latte and is equally impressed. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I went here for drinks on a saturday night. The cocktails were delicious and averaged priced. There are a couple seats outside on a mini patio however it's not licensed. It's a small, intimate place for a low key night. It's comfortable and the service was great."}
{"text":"Fantastic misto, great place to study or just hangout. Try the brunch it's hands down the best brunch in have had in years!"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE coming here. It's so beautiful inside. The people running this joint are warm and friendly. The coffee is amazing and the care they put into their latte art always brings a smile to my face.  Love you guys!"}
{"text":"Great brunch, great spot, great service.  It's got it all.  Go back often - the menu is always changing!  http://thingsthatareawesome.com/2013/03/27/voodoo-child-cafe/"}
{"text":"Everything about this place was great. The atmosphere and decor are very hip, down to the eclectic glassware. We sat at the bar and had the privilege of watching our food being cooked - doesn't happen often enough. Although the menu is limited (I would assume it changes often) everything on it looked too good. I went with the gouda and bacon grilled cheese topped with a fried egg, which also came with an apple walnut arugula salad and hashbrowns. My friend described it as one of those rare times that breakfast food didn't need any ketchup, hot sauce, etc because it was already so freakin' good. I also really enjoyed their coffee selection; they offered two craft blends, so you could try something new without feeling overwhelmed or uninformed.

It is on the smaller side, so I could see there being a long wait at peak times or for groups of more than 2 or 3."}
{"text":"Nice little cafe. They definitely value simplicity when it comes to coffee, but the quality is really good, the best coffee I've had in a while really.

The seating situation is tough though - the place is very small and the tables as well as the bar are always occupied, often by people working on their laptops."}
{"text":"No more brunch!
We asked why and \"Things went another way\" whatever that means. So we ordered coffee to be polite and then had to sit and watch the barista and waitress make out behind the bar. Gross."}
{"text":"Was excited to grab coffee here, solely because of the Yelp reviews.  I had never heard of the place before but was in the area and Yelp users say it's good.  So if Yelpers say its good..., it probably is.  I think we might have come on an off day.  The music was really loud and not the kind of music that coffee shops usually have.  I didn't see the menu behind me and was looking around the bar trying to view the menu.  When we asked we were pointed to the wall with a bit of attitude.  I ordered a flat white and was asked to choose my espresso beans.... The chalkboard wasn't entirely clear to me what my options were and I actually felt a bit stupid for not understanding what he was pointing at.   But I had to say something so I just asked for the voodoo one because I didn't know what else to say.  The coffee was good and you can tell the barista knows what he is doing.  I was feeling a bit uncomfortable with the interaction and the loud music and was quite certain i wouldn't return, until some older clientele came in and the music was changed and decreased to something more akin to a coffee shop type of music.  I feel like I need to give this place a second chance based on the normally positive reviews I read."}
{"text":"I went to Voodoo Child for Brunch on the weekend. The cafe is small and cozy. The services, foods and drinks are awesome. I understand why they priced the cost so high, because the foods and drinks are absolutely delicious. I never expected a simple french toast to taste sooooo good. Highly recommending their brunch menu and drinks. Also I would recommend to arrive early, it gets busy passed 11am. Well done!"}
{"text":"Coffee & Bourbon- need I say more? Worth the walk from our hotel and the barista/bartender was super friendly."}
{"text":"The coffee is pretty great, but the atmosphere is very weird. It looks like it's supposed to look old, but in a futuristic way. The music is like something you might hear as your soul passes on to the underworld in an indie movie, but the lyrics are about teenage sex.

Whatever, I can deal with that. I like coffee and I like the little aeonium sitting beside me on the table."}
{"text":"I love this place. The house espresso is something i always lean towards. The skull mug is an interesting twist. The food is also good. Definitely a nice place to visit each time"}
{"text":"Good place for coffee..! We ordered a Latte, Cappuccino. Both were good. I got their Voodo Regular for Brunch. It's just regular as in the name. But loved the pancakes that my friend got. The apple thyme with them is excellent. All in all, it worth a try & a go to place if your looking for coffee."}
{"text":"This is a cool spot to hang out. The baristas are experienced and knowledgable, and they always have good music playing. Although the coffee is a bit expensive, I will admit I've had some of the best lattes here. The shop is also just a short walk from U of T's St. George campus, which is probably why I found myself hanging out here all the time before or after classes. The space is a bit small, which is fine during the day, but can get a bit cramped by the time the sun goes down and the place turns into a cocktail bar. Without going into too much detail, I'll just say five stars for the coffee, but minus one for the extra dollar I'm paying for it."}
{"text":"Had Sunday brunch and the spinach goat cheese and squash omlet was awesome! Very healthy with side salad and hash browns that were not greasy. Very pleasant experience!!"}
{"text":"The Voodoo punch buggy espresso blend is creamy with notes of chocolate! The best my wife has had in her life! 

The Brie sandwich was a delicious combination of flavours, even better than the roast beef sandwich."}
{"text":"The setting is just perfect. The drinks are inspired. At least once, you need to try their boozy coffees. My problem is, I never want to leave -- it feels cozy with the right amount of low-lighting."}
{"text":"Wow! Melanie is the bomb! The cocktails here are always spectacular, as is the coffee! Come in with friends and enjoy some dranks!"}
{"text":"Delicious brunch! Had the apple pie french toast with delicious cinnamon whipped cream! The coffee was amazing as usual."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic coffee. I really loved their brunches as well but unfortunately this has stopped and the cook/chef has moved on. I hope they find someone great to replace him!!"}
{"text":"Super cute place with good coffee. The brunch looked interesting - have not tried it yet..
Did I tell you how cute the place is?"}
{"text":"Ordered the house espresso as a 'voodoo' and was really into it, it's a mix of whole milk and cream to make a cortado. They did serve it in a glass skull, though, and frankly I would have liked the option of a regular mug because, well, it's a glass skull...? Anyway, aside from that I enjoyed the drink and the space. It was a little early in the day so I didn't sample any of the booze laden coffee offerings but from the menu descriptions they sounded pretty great. Recommended. Music was interesting too, ASAP Rocky mostly. I'm not a huge fan but it was kinda nice to hear some hip hop playing in a cafe for a bit of a change. Was hoping to hear some OVO being in TO but hey, I guess that's played out or something.

btw the gluten free chocolate chip cookie for 3$ was fabulous."}
{"text":"Stopped here for Sunday brunch after finding out how long the wait at Aunties and Uncles was. 

We grabbed a seat at the bar and were front and center for all of the action at the kitchen. The chef deftly put together our French toast and scrambled eggs.

The menu was small (just three choices for brunch) but I found my meal to be well balanced. The truffled scrambled eggs were relatively light and complemented well with the richness/heaviness of the potato salad and the fresh/crisp/tart of a walnut, arugula and apple salad.

The chef mentioned that the new brunch menu would be coming out soon, so will have to return to check it out.

The service was attentive, although it felt like a lot of people (about 5) were working in a very small space. Sitting by the kitchen I also noticed that the ventilation wasn't too great, that it was a little bit smoky, and that my clothes ended up smelling a bit like breakfast. Add to that, the fast-paced 80s music, and it was a bit of a sensory overload.

Overall a good dining experience for the food and caring, friendly staff. A few tweaks to the ambience would make this place even better."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food and delicious lattes. Apparently the store won second place at the Canada latte art competition last year, so you know that their coffee is legit. Cute little placed tucked away on college street. The decor is also really inviting and conducive to having a nice little conversation. 

Around 12$ and entree, about 3.50$ for a latte with almond milk."}
{"text":"5/5 for being a chill cafe with a bar that offers spiked coffee and bourbon flights, and  no overly drunken loud people. The bartender was knowledgeable about drink options and explained the quality of each bourbon--but not in an uppity way. I had the montserrata (coffee, bourbon, chocolate milk), which came out like a soothing spiked latte. My boyfriend had a bourbon espresso which had a hint of roasted orange rind (and the whole dried thing floating inside it!)

We proceeded to sip bourbons, whiskies and then had a rum flight. We got pleasantly drunk amongst random people who were studying, chatting, and dating. The decor is vintage twee but I don't mind it. The music was on point if you're a pitchfork-ish fan: tinashe, disclosure, drake remixes...

This place is a gem and it's definitely not a place where I'd feel intimidated drinking or sitting alone. It's chill like tequila bookworm but without the horrible indie rock and bartenders who constantly coming up to you to ask if you'll have another coffee.
 Because you will :D"}
{"text":"I can split this review in 2 parts: coffee taste and overall experience.

Coffee: Not sure if many others do but I went with the most exotic sounding item on the espresso menu: \"voodoo child\". They have 2 varieties of beans so I went with the more \"traditional\" one. So from a single try of their coffee I can say it had a smooth taste. I won't comment on the skull glass cups since they don't add much to the taste :) Unfortunately the coffee wasn't as hot as it should have been. Their coffee machine seems really good but I'm not a pro and could be wrong.

Overall: They're not a typical coffee shop for sure. They played some old rap songs which was fun combined with the snow outside. It matched the atmosphere and I enjoyed it. The barista was really friendly and put quite the effort making our drinks. He also seemed knowledgeable or at least confident enough in what he was saying. We went pretty late so I'm not sure how the atmosphere is during daytime but it's awesome for a late evening drink! They also have coffee cocktails but I didn't try one. Maybe next time.

Overall, 4 stars for the coffee(not as hot as I wanted) and 5 for everything else(interior, service and presentation)!"}
{"text":"A voodoo child to cure your morning slump! Unfortunately, this is not a drink you want with milk alternatives as its voodoo is derived from half cream, half milk. So if you're lactose intolerant like I am, take out those lactaid pills and enjoy!!! Or if you're vegan, any other drink is available with almond milk!"}
{"text":"First time here, and I was greeted by a friendly barista. He made an excellent cappuccino, made with Pilot Coffee Roaster's (Te Aro) Big Bro beans. 

Bit of a hipster vibe, with chairs at the counter and a large common table at the  window. Good music, not too loud. Unlike it's neighbour, Manic Coffee, VC has wifi."}
{"text":"Great cafe/bar lost between all the other business on College. My friend and I came by after work on Thursday for drinks, I got the black manhattan and she got the old fashioned (they're big on bourbon if you haven't noticed).

Drinks are made right in front of you with tender loving care by a super sweet barista that teased our age as we looked under age but under age folks do not order such strong drinks (haha). 

I love the atmosphere and the huge window in the front because you can sip on your drink while people watching or just enjoy the sun on their tables in the front.

I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Yes, you should try the Voodoo Child drink - it's an indulgence for sure. 
Great coffee - I wish they had some more snacks / baked goods to go along with them. 

Some people sit along the bar with their laptops and work, which seems a bit out of place in this coffee shop, but go for it if you want, I guess. It seems like more of a hang out with a buddy or bring a book type of coffee shop.

They used to do a great Sunday brunch here, but no longer :( really wish they'd bring that back."}
{"text":"Petit coffee bar de quartier à l'entrée de Kensignton Market, le Voodoo Child est le point d'arrêt parfait pour un café que vous pourrez agrémenter d'une dose de bourbon.
La spécialité reste ici le café maison préparé par l'un des meilleurs barristas de Toronto dénommé Bruce Ly !!!"}
{"text":"I spent a month in the hood, subletting a place that didn't have the Internet, so I ended up  checking out quite a number of cafes to do my work remotely. I'd say that this place was my favourite of them all, chill atmosphere, decent non pop music, great coffee (but to be fair I'm not a coffee person) and excellent tea. They are very meticulous about everything that they make here - carefully chosen ingredients and mixing, including the cocktails they serve. Lastly, their bagels are Montreal style oven baked, which sealed the deal for me even more."}
{"text":"Il fait froid, très froid à Toronto un premier janvier. Et il y a peu de boutiques ou cafés ouvert dans le Kensington market. 
Aller on tente un dernier bout de rue avant d'aller se réfugier chez nous. Finalement, cette place est ouverte. Le nom d'une belle chanson ne peut augurer que de bonnes choses. Le lieu est charmant, le café est bon et les biscuits aussi! 
Il y a aussi pas mal de cocktails qui ont l'air originaux mais j'avoue que ce jour-là, je n'avais pas besoin de ce type de réconfort!"}
{"text":"New IT SPOT!! Love it!!! I've been a somewhat regular since the opening of Voodoo and it's  just getting better and BETTER!!! Coffee = perfect!!! Love that they offer 2 different types of espresso and they always steam the milk to just right!!! The brunch always sounds rich and delicious. The bagels are loaded with fresh ingredients and toasted to a crispy golden. The service is great, the staff are friendly, sweet and knowledgable."}
{"text":"There is this one barista who makes coffee the way I like. I skip this coffee shop when he is not around. Other people don't do it right."}
{"text":"Best espresso ever anywhere!!  You can choose from 2 espressos which change every few days.  Every one I've tried has been incredible.  o and the latte art is impeccable!!  if it sounds like too many superlatives, it's not!"}
{"text":"What started out as coming by to visit Bruce to check out his new digs turned into an almost daily hangout spot. Great vibe, chill clientèle, and delicious espresso drinks. Kudos guys!"}
{"text":"This is a review for Voodoo Child at night when it turns into a fantastic cocktail bar.
Toronto doesn't seem to have many of these: places that serve coffee in the day and then turn into bars in the evening. Last night we stopped in after walking through Kensington Market, found seats at the bar, and proceeded to have a great time. 

They have a fantastic list of cocktails, with a whole page of Jim Beam-based drinks for $9 each! (For a city that seems to have gotten used to paying more than $12 for mediocre drinks this is a revelation.) The bartender was great and the music killer."}
{"text":"The Voodoo child drink would have to be my favorite espresso beverage that I've had in Toronto! It's essentially a Macchiato with cream instead of milk. Highly recommend. 

Accepts credit card
Close to a streetcar stop"}
{"text":"Overall Voodoo is a safe choice, the drinks are good, and the environment is exquisite. If you like a bit of change from core Kensington area, this is a great option."}
{"text":"This is my favorite coffee joint in Toronto. Love the setting, lots of light, and coffee superb."}
{"text":"I love this bar/cafe. At first I'm not gonna lie I'm quite superstitious and the name voodoo  child totally spooked me. But honestly the staff here as over the  top friendly and kind and great conversationalists. Prices are optimal for the quality of the products. They appeal to all crowds at every point of the day being a brunch, cafe and bar. Interior layout is dark aNd intimate perfect for an intimate evening. It is a must try in my book and definite favourite along the college west strip."}
{"text":"My all time absolutely favourite local coffee spot- and I've lived in the hood for 13 years!
Bruce is beyond the best barista and latte artist in Toronto and his staff are always friendly and chill even when there's a lineup out the door. I can't forget to mention how open he is to making lattes with my own alternative milks, something *Bux would never fathom doing. The coffee - anything you get - is always outstanding. My faves are the Detour, Butterfly Kiss and Big Bro americano, but anything they bring in-house I trust. 
The quaint China tea cups and dishes alongside mini spoons give the place it's unique vintage touch hipstery. If you have a few mins (7 minutes exactly) to spare, I would highly recommend trying the Syphon coffee- it's a breaking-bad type process involving beakers, coffee, fire and steam. It's pretty cool to watch and the coffee comes out smooth like butter without any bitter taste whatsoever. The music they play is always on point and often edgy, from kings of Leon to Lorde, and of course their amazing playlists leave you curioius as to what's up next. Their one chef brunch operation is delightful and all local, using an old school oven with electric elements...they even have sprouts growing in house!  The paisley metal curling tiles makes you feel like you've stepped back in time when it was 'in' to make Toronto's architecture and interior design tasteful.  

The large sharing table is nice if you're popping open your laptop, less so when grabbing brunch but still fine because everyone there is really cool. My favourite long 4-top table is central and private- always a score when it's free. Sitting at the bar is a pretty wicked experience too, seeing all the action going on is mesmerizing. 
I hear the drinks are really fun and creative, have yet to try going in the evening....

So.... Why haven't you tried VOODOO yet!??? 

That's what I thought."}
{"text":"Awesome service from Melanie, cool decor, and fun beverages. Shame they only serve wheat-carb food, but overall it was a win. Sweet to find a nice car/cafe open late."}
{"text":"How have I not written a review yet :-S

I love every single drink on the menu! My favourite is the V Beckham which tastes like Victoria looks, tart and sweet! The Wu Tang is dirty as hell, which is my bffs fav! The presentation of the drinks are nice and they come out the same no matter who makes them, which goes to show how much care Alex puts into training. The coffee is something epic. They will sell you the beans but wont grind them for you which makes no never mind to me. They used to do brunch, but still have pastries to snack on.

A lot of people come here to study, which is fine, but when there is nowhere to sit and someone is taking up a table for 4 with a laptop it can be a bit annoying. I paid for parking the other day and walked into a full house with just this scenario. I didn't want to but had to leave :-(

They do live music and private events, I would totally consider doing a birthday party or some other event here it is very intimate and the vibe is just right. Oh that's another thing, the music is always 100% on point! 

This is probably my favourite hole in the wall bourbon bar and I would give it a 5 if it weren't for the lack of seating and signage. There is literally no sign other than a logo on the window which you can't see while driving, I just tell people it's next to the threading spot. Alex seems to like to keep it real simple, I begged him to do gift certificates one Christmas but he wants to keep it a local watering hole which is probably why people keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Beautiful! Voodoo Child is a total dream vision of a coffee shop. Similar to Holy Oak, Northwood, etc., they are community/culture oriented and serve cocktails, host brunch, events, pop-ups and more.... but what about the coffee basics? Their cappuccino made with big brother blend espresso is pretty brill. YES. Baker loves dat triple B. Their coffee product and coffee skills are top-notch. What more can I say that probably hasn't been mentioned already? Apparently they are opening a satellite Voodoo Child in Korea."}
{"text":"Today.  Brunch.  Amazing.  I cannot believe I have lived in this area over a year and a half and this is the first time I've experienced Voodoo Child.  Let's go.

1. You can get a brunch mimosa combo for $21.50 - yes, that's right a brunch mimosa combo for $21.50.  A STEAL.  And the mimosas were literally half sparkling wine and half orange juice.  No skimping.

2. There are only three items on the menu.  This makes it easy to pick and they all looked amazing coming off that stove.

3. I had the key lime stuffed french toast.  It was, essentially, da BOMB.  It was 1/4 of a loaf of bread stuffed with key lime custard, topped with whipped cream and lime rind.  It was amazing. 

4. You get to see the chef cooking everything up, which was really neat.  I also have now learned that the ultimate omelette is finished in the oven!

5.  Amazing selection of teas and coffee.  I was busy doing the mimosa thing but I am for sure going to return for tea and coffee."}
{"text":"very cute cafe and is open late! that's what caught our attention. we didn't want to go to another bar/pub and it was already close to midnight on friday night. we just wanted to chat in a nice cafe and voila! Voodoo child popped out from thin air as if in a fairy tale=) ahaha=) 

it's a nice cute cafe/bar. with a couple of tiny tables and a reasonable big bar stand that can fit probably 8 people. 

they have a very interesting menu of different types of coffees (with and w/o alcohol), some snacks like bagels (um the peanut butter + bananas!) and lots of alcohol drinks. 

I liked the way their menus are printed and organized. there is something handmade about them - menu printed on paper pages that are stacked and attached to a carton piece by a paper clip holder. very cute. 

there is some 60's style atmosphere in the cafe...or maybe it was just because the bartender girl was dressed up that way=) the staff is very friendly and chatty. all of them are very new and seemed to be a bit lost when asked about menu and drinks but they balanced it out with their friendliness and willingness to help right away.

very cute cafe even though a bit on a pricey side."}
{"text":"One of the best coffee places I've been to in Toronto. This intimate coffee shop is perfect for someone looking to get away from the chaos of the downtown core. 

Although there's limited seating, Voodoo Child makes up for it with their vast selection of beans and flavours. On top of their wide variety of drinks, the baristas are super friendly and accommodating. 

Perfect for Instagram - ask for your latte in a crystal skull."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Great atmosphere, awesome service, good food. I went to study and I liked that there was big table where you can study. It was also easy to find plugs. I will definitely be returning :D"}
{"text":"Right off the bat an awesome place because of the staff. It was my first time there but they were super friendly and knew most of the other people in line by their names and orders. I was so impressed! 

Worked here and there was great wifi. The London Fog I had was delicious and the music playing was really nice and relaxing. 

It's a bit out of the way for me but I'll likely still come back to soak up the awesome vibes."}
{"text":"I ate brunch here about a week ago and was really impressed! I started with a latte that was made almost perfectly. The foam was deliciously foamy and the espresso was just what I needed. The latte could have been a bit warmer but that's just being picky. 

I then ate had an omelet filled with asparagus and goat's cheese. The egg was very nicely cooked - lovely and fluffy yet still creamy. The asparagus and goat's cheese that were wrapped inside were equally delicious. The omelet came with a couple pieces of nicely buttered raisin bread and an arugula salad dressed lightly. It truly was a delicious brunch! I don't eat meat but the omelet came with a link of sausage which I gave to my friend who reported it to be a pretty good sausage. He ate the croque madame and seemed thoroughly impressed with the meal.

I'll definitely come back to Voodoo Child to try something new soon! :)"}
{"text":"Apparently owner has a policy on not serving decaf and not serving single shots in a drink. You have to have caffeine and you have to have it as a double. You can't be pregnant and ask for an accommodation - cause apparently the policy can not be deferred to for anyone -- even if you are willing to pay for both shots and have one poured out!!!  

If this is how the owner wants to run their business - I get it, it's totally up to them and well within their right. But do a solid to your community and POST your strict policy on your facebook page or menu board or ANYWHERE so people don't trek in only to be turned away. Female barista could also use a customer service tune up --

Down the street there is Manic Coffee who were very happy to take our business (and will let you customize a drink for a fetus!)"}
{"text":"Essentially came here for the coffee that comes in the skull cup (it's the voodoo child one if you were wondering). The barista was super nice when I basically asked her for the \"skull cup coffee\" haha. This is a cute little hipster-y cafe, but there aren't too many tables, so you either have to show up early / sit at the bar. I read an earlier review that mentioned brunch but it seems like they switched to just drinks (and possibly bagels?). However, there is free wifi which is always appreciated! :)"}
{"text":"This used to the The Bean but is now so much better. They make fine original cocktails with locally sourced fruits and unique ingredients for excellent prices ($8-10). They apparently also have one of the best baristas in Canada! Whoa. The owner is very welcoming and the lighting is very good (I think lighting is very important for bars). They also make late night grilled cheeses with FAT bacon slices sourced from Sanagan's. They could use some tunes but everything else is working for them."}
{"text":"We ordered two voodoo childs, one of each of the featured roasts. Both drinks were delicious but mine was out of this world. My blend was Ethiopian with hints of strawberry and these hints really created this beautiful strawberries and cream flavor. Every time I'm in Toronto I'd stop here for sure."}
{"text":"This \"cocktail café\" is laid back and relaxed with a twist of voodoo mama juju. The menu is fun and inventive with classic bourbon drinks. \"Paper Planes\" was described by the bartender as \"a little sweet, a little sour, a little bitter, and balanced with booze\" and I have to say that description is absolutely accurate! Very yummy sipping cocktail and surprisingly refreshing on a summer afternoon. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Busy place but they do get you in and out pretty fast.  Good variety, did not have time to come back for a nightcap or listen to music.  Visited twice during the week I was here if that tells you anything, it tells you this is a place worth your time and money."}
{"text":"I feel like coming here is deja Voo. Doo you know what that feels like, child?

My travel buddy to Toronto is obsessed with coffee. After a bad-ish Hortons experience, we gave Voodoo a try instead. It went fairly well. We didn't get to drink out of the skull cup (they're picky about who they serve it to), but the girl was really nice and helped us pick out some nice cups of imported coffee. I didn't think it was too amazing (a little Starbucksy for my taste, as most of these fancy coffee shops are), but the service is definitely great - from a young girl who didn't know much about coffee but knew a sh** ton about how to treat customers right. Prices not so much, but they have to stay open. Decor is absolutely wonderful, although very hipstery."}
{"text":"The coffee was very. good. 
Laid back atmosphere with nice music, hipster clientel. Since it's rather small it's hard to find space during busy hours! No drip coffee past noon."}
{"text":"This is a review for Voodoo child as a brunch place - I am not sure about them as a cafe - it might be different. 

I didn't like them for following reasons:
1. Very small place and quite congested unless you get the front table
2. Only 3 choices/options for brunch
3. We ordered 2 things - Omelette which was ok and French Toast (stuffed with Banana) which was one of the worst french toast I've ever had - stale and hard bread and horrible taste

The service was not bad, but given the options the have for brunch, I'll never go again!"}
{"text":"Best cocktails in the city. I got the off-the-menu Wuw Tang- bourbon, ginger beer, lemon, campari, Cointreau, and lime juice. Bourbon and bagels. Can't beat that. Killer bartender and amazing music. Wish they had shirts, the logo is awesome!"}
{"text":"Possibly my fav cafe spot in the area. Friendly staff, great coffee good overall atmosphere. I had the \"voodoo child\" which is a version similar to a cortado in a skull glass. Really good and flavourful. Wifi friendly as well. I've also been a few times at night where it turns into a small cocktail bar with music and really good bourbon sours. Well deserved 5 stars overall. Never had questionable service here."}
{"text":"I had a pour over from here this morning and I can say that beyond the shadow of a doubt it is the best coffee I've had in Toronto. I've been searching Toronto for a real cup of coffee and I'm glad to have finally found it."}
{"text":"Can't begin to tell you how pretentious this joint is. Back in my day, you walk into a coffee shop and if the coffees hot, you're good to trot. Nowadays you go into these shops and they tell you how you want your coffee. I don't recall even asking you. There's nothing like being an Italian straight from the motherland and asking for Cortado and having some mook behind the counter tell me how a Cortado is made. Are you kidding me? Ok well I'll take it to go. You don't serve Cortados to go? How about you close up shop and leave coffee to the other maestros around the block: Jimmy's, coffee bar, Sicilian cafe, Manic, the Common. Anywhere but this place.

The sheer audacity."}
{"text":"Look for Bruce Ly at this place, yep, that's right, Bruce \"Ly\" (not Lee). I'm sure he's heard it a million times, or not so much if he changed his name to this.

Anyways, pretty friendly guy. this voodoo child makes a good cappuccino. And I'm guessing if he doesn't have too many people, will spend time using some stick to draw something like a panda in the foam of your coffee.

The place, pretty mellow which is how I'd prefer the coffee cafes. They also serve some breakfast there too, didn't try it though.

So a girl walks in and wants some tea, but the tea selection is beside the cashier where my group is waiting for our coffee and blocking. I'd say they perhaps should try relocating the tea selection, the supply chain could be better.

They have this huge piece of marble beside the cashier, says Kentucky. Apparently previous occupants had that as their counter but The Voodoo child did not want it, so they broke the marble and kept the Kentucky. Man, that is a big piece of marble to waste.

The Voodoo child serves your coffee with a smile and art."}
{"text":"I forgot to bring my wallet, I tried to pay her back online but the waitress here gave me for free. That is so warm heart of her. Beside that I like the environment at Voodoo, very suitable for reading book. I definitely will come back again. Thannks"}
{"text":"Jimi Hendrix a écrit un des plus brillants morceaux de guitare, il a réussi à faire crier sa guitare sur les premières notes de ce morceau.
Je me devais donc de rentrer dans ce café pour avoir mon moment groupie de Toronto :)

Nous avons pris un chocolat chaud, un Voodoo Child (je ne me rappelle plus de la composition) et 2 cookies.
Bon chocolat chaud et à priori le café aussi était sympa.
Les cookies étaient correctes mais sans gros plus.
Pour 14$ c'était dans les prix !

Le coin était remplis preuve de la hype de ce café mais qui n'aura pas su me charmer malgré mon adoration d'Hendrix. Comme quoi le nom ne fait pas tout !"}
{"text":"This is one of the best little coffee places in the area! It has a great friend atmosphere very highly recommend this coffee shop."}
{"text":"Weird place. Weird peps inside. Ok if your a smelly hipster this is the place for you. Spanish music playing although I'm pretty sure I was the only Spanish person there. Rude barista lady. Small with very limited seating. Looks like the people in the have been there for years. Bring febreze.  Coffee was good that why I gave 2 stars. Do not recommend. Will not go again. Also in sketchy hipster part of town."}
{"text":"The Voodoo child had me wired for 8hr straight. Maybe it was because it came in a skull glass which had a placebo effect on me, making me believe that whatever I drank was going to give me powers. Who knows. But coffee here is great and strong! Would recommend."}
{"text":"Such good coffeeeeeee, baristas are knowledgeble as they offer two types of beans and each time I nag them about the differences. Have really cool cups/spoons that surprises me every time I order coffee to stay. Haven't tried their brunch or cocktails yet but will soon!"}
{"text":"I am giving this joint 5 stars because they have award winning baristas that make coffee so yummy I don't need my sweetener and also tasty pastry. Their WiFi is consistently functional and there is usually a few seats, although they run a tight ship. It's a youngish crowd here so if I want to feel mature and like I have life figured out it's a good zone to be in. If I want to feel super meta and get lost in abstract thoughts about space time and medieval warfare, I go to The Common."}
{"text":"Just a solid, neighbourhood cafe/bar hybrid. I came during the day for a latte and catching up with a friend. It's a warm, social environment with a large communal table. There was a good mix of people reading or doing work on laptops, as well as people just hanging out. My latte was on pointe and I also noticed they have a nice selection of Sloane teas. DC had the hot chocolate that looked nice and creamy! They have a small selection of baked goods (cookies, croissants) but I didn't get to try any. I'd say this is a good option if Manic (a few doors down) is full or if you can't decide between coffee or booze!"}
{"text":"Great, friendly (and attractive) staff who are ready to take your order and willing to serve.

Cute interior and beautifully hand lettered chalkboards for menus.

Great atmosphere for a coffee date or to get some work done. 


A new fave."}
{"text":"Cool little coffee shop that serves creative cocktails. This was the last stop on a day time crawl so I wish I could remember what I had....Wu Tang? Anyways, nice little cafe where I'd grab a bite sometime. We were the only ones not drinking coffee."}
{"text":"Came here and got a caramel macchiato and it was disappointing. It wasn't very tasty at all. Maybe I'm a bad coffee drinker but its nothing like the Starbucks drink of the same name. It was small like expresso sized and I couldn't take it to go. It was extremely bitter and strong. I didn't like it but hey if thats what someone likes I hope they enjoy it.

The staff was really unpleasant. They seemed to be too busy socializing with the regulars to actually pay attention or help the people who were coming into the place. They have a lot of good reviews though so maybe I'll be back and update my review if it's better experience. For now it will have to remain at 2 stars just because I guess the drink could be some peoples thing and I hope to update my review.  The brunch pictures look delicious."}
{"text":"Not a memorable coffee experience, this coming from a coffee geek that has a passion for coffee. Very expensive. $10 for 2 lattes is a little much"}
{"text":"Very nice coffee shops and they know their coffee! You can order the coffee in a skull glass that you see all over Instagram. The portion size will definitely be smaller due to the glass. 

The latte was smooth but a bit bitter for my liking, it's probably because I chose the wrong beans though. I don't know my coffee :(. 

Fast internet and comfortable seating, shop is a bit too small though. 

Also...... isn't a latte usually straight up espresso and milk? There shouldn't be any syrup in it (like other reviewers stated) but I guess people are used to Starbucks drinks these days lol."}
{"text":"This is my favourite coffee shop in the area. The staff is really nice (especially Bruce Ly!), and they really care about the quality of your coffee or cocktail. 

I love how this cafe blends coffee culture geek with cocktail chic - they always have something to satisfy your drink needs, regardless of whether you need caffeine or booze. Their espresso drinks are expertly pulled, and I love their choice of Pilot Beans - they're absolutely delicious. I had my first siphoned coffee here, and Bruce took the time to explain the process and teach me what tasting notes to look for when drinking siphoned coffee (which is AMAZING!). 

Their cocktails are also well blended and inventive - I'd recommend any of them that incorporate alcohol with coffee. 

I also love the atmosphere here. The staff is chatty without being intrusive, and they really care about the quality of their food and drinks. There's always room at the bar, and they don't mind if you set up there to work for a few hours. 

Oh, and they serve the best cappuccino in the city. I've tried quite a few and I just can't stop coming back here,"}
{"text":"Crystal skull... That is what your cortado or latte could come in. Well, it is probably glass but crystal sounds cooler. I am not sure if it alone is worth stopping in for.. maybe for the instagramers. But Voodoo child has a lot more going for it then that..

They're a different kind of coffee shop, in the evening they exchange their caffeine serving for alcohol serving (sometimes ft. live music :)). I feel it is important also to know that past noon they do not sell drip coffee - although you can still order an americano, latte, etc. They have really tasty drip coffee with a low-key morning vibe that I really enjoy... and a good wifi connection..."}
{"text":"We came here to try their brunch menu. First, the place is cozy, and I think it was only designed as cafe but not with a kitchen. The entire cafe was so smoky that my friends and I have problem staying any longer inside the cafe after the meal. Our eyes are all very watery and we really want to get out of there badly. It might be okay for dining outside but inside is bad idea. 

The meal took a while to come up as we understand that is made fresh. We had the eggs with steak and fries. It was okay but not impressive, the steak was over cooked. The 'John Doe', the egg Benny was good with corn bread, avocado, and smoked salmon. Overall it was not impressive brunch and I would expect it would be better because you only have three things on the menu. The coffee on the other hand, it is quite good. The pastry is quite good too. I would say don't come here for brunch but come here for their regular cafe menu."}
{"text":"OH my god! How does this place have above a 2 star rating??

I went in there to ask for a latte in one of the skull cups i see online, not a big deal.
But the guy at the bar made it seem like the biggest deal, he told me he would still charge me full price for it even though it is less amount than a regular latte....i didn't really care. Then i tried to reason with him and ask for a cortado....he said that wouldn't work because it would be LESS than the cup size. Like he made it rocket science instead of just making it work....
And THEN i offered to try a single shot latte to even it out, he said \"WE DON'T MAKE SINGLE ESPRESSOS\" HAHA they don't MAKE SINGLE ESPRESSOS! WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN? \"We only have double shots here\" like...if you pull two and use one shot...that's one shot.......I just felt like he really didn't want to do it for me. The cafe is full of hipster kids and the baristas are hipsters...a weird vibe in there....I doubt this place will be open for another 5 years....small shops need to learn that if you want to be successful you have to serve the customer, you can't make the customer feel like their order is too complicated or that you can't serve them...i ended up leaving because he kept coming up with reasons for not making it for me....i was like wtf, dude? bye... bad experience. There are way too many better cafes in the city for me to deal with someone not wanting to make me a coffee...."}
{"text":"Cute place. Very histerish vibe to it. I just wanted coffee on a Tuesday morning. 
The employees are friendly and there's a wide variety of drinks to pick from. 

Half bar half coffee shop has a very interesting concept to it. 
I just don't think I'm willing to pay almost $6 for a small specify coffee. Especially when competition is so high downtown. 
For sure willing to spend the $$ on their cocktails."}
{"text":"One of the best coffee places in the Kensington market area! Coffee might be a little sour sometimes but it was very tasty every time we went. Nice latte art too. Water and wifi are free. Cool interior and a bank in the sun - what else would you want? Cash and debit/credit cards work. 

Very friendly and quick service!"}
{"text":"Rap music and one of the best espressos I've ever had. If you're not into coffe, try one of their cocktails. Staff was really nice. I couldn't ask for more."}
{"text":"This is our first time there. We went there on the Friday morning. At first, we would like to get some brunch, but they just serve it on weekends. Turns out, we ordered one Macchiato. The other one is one of VooDoo special coffee( do not remember the name).   Both of these two coffee were awesome. I was surprised by the first sip. It is no doubt a good place for coffee.  The service was great, too! Definitely will be back next time in Toronto."}
{"text":"5/5 absolutely! Awesome pour overs with premium beans. That Ethiopian Butterfly Kiss was great. Mostly top-notch service. Extra points for good selection of music."}
{"text":"Great coffee. I would reccomend trying the Voodoo Child. A steamed milk and cream mix along with a double shot of espresso. Great stuff. They also have a fair selection of cocktails, if you choose to have a drink."}
{"text":"Brunch Review:

Portions are small, which can sometimes be a good thing. Not much choice (3 options), but their brunch selections are fairly creative. Awesome Caesars and Mimosas, and as an added bonus, the baristas can make super cute bears with your latte foam!"}
{"text":"Awesome cozy spot! Went in to try the espresso and stayed for a while. Great selection of coffees and beers/cocktails. Small place with limited seating, but a very cool atmosphere. Staff was very friendly and helpful with the menu items.

Will definitely return next time I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Great great food! My friend and I really enjoyed sitting at the bar area. We could watch how the cook does his voodoo magic right from there.

Espresso was exceionally good, too."}
{"text":"Hands down best coffee in Toronto. Great staff and amazing baristas (who also make a mean cocktail for times when you need a lil something stronger) Excellent any time of day or night, this place is my go-to for beverages and imbibing of all kinds.. Also INCREDIBLE brunches on the weekend and great pop-ups (oyster buck-a-shucks, live music etc). Can't say how much I love this place.. would live here if I could!!"}
{"text":"Safecracker. Yep, I don't drink coffee but this may convert me. 

Awesome experience. When in Toronto, we will be back."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars ... definitely above average and a very unique spot for boozy drinks with coffee.  A hipster hang out for sure.

On a sunny Saturday, they had the doors and windows open and it allowed the cool breeze to come through.  There isnt a lot of seating and every table was taken up with a laptop and a can of cider.  Though it's listed as being a coffee place... it definitely has more of a vibe of a hipster bar than a coffee place.  Service is funny and relaxed ... very relaxed.  Don't come here for good and quick service for coffee... come here if you have time to chill, relax, and drink.  The fellow patrons are cool here but hipster is the key word.  Another good thing about this place, it's opened late... so that is a huge win to find a place that does good coffee late at night.

We ordered a non-typical drink of the Sloane teas but with a latte... the barista/bartender was super friendly and just handling a lot of people by himself.  It took some time to get our drink but we werent in too much of a rush.  I loved they had Sloane teas available and they took time to steep the teas to develop flavour.  I would say they probably used too much tea to almond milk as it was more watery but really loved that they gave us at least 2 tea bags so it gave as much flavour as possible.

Overall, chill and cool... probably best if you want to just find a spot to sit and read your emails with a cider in your hand."}
{"text":"Wowza, how haven't I had brunch here before? The menu and space are both very small but so worthwhile! The place can get a little chilly so bring a sweater!

There are only 3 choices on the menu (that change every month) and I still had a hard time picking! In the end, the man and I both got the BBQ Benny. What a great choice! The only thing that would have improved the dish would be if it was all hot. The cornbread, eggs and pork were room temperature while the beans were piping hot. Small note on an otherwise perfect plate.

We also tried the Voodoo Child espresso blend as an Americano and the Big Brother as a latte. I would definitely recommend the Big Brother since this season it has a nice toffee note. The Voodoo Child was a little too bitter for me."}
{"text":"Very good coffees, OK bourbon-coffee drinks (at very good prices). The atmosphere is better suited to a coffee shop than a cocktail bar though. Simple interior but not really cozy. Not a bad neighborhood hangout but not really somewhere you'd take a date."}
{"text":"Great service, great espressos and also a pretty solid place for brunch!! 

The place has a bit of a hipster vibe which is pretty cool, definitely loved the atmosphere here. The staff was also really incredible, came by and provided us recommendations on what to drink/eat.  Will be uploading pictures to this shortly!"}
{"text":"Best way to describe this place is awesome...

This place has figured out that a simple menu and amazing cocktails is a way to keep people coming back. There's only three items on the brunch menu and 2 cocktail options.

After hearing much about this place, I came here on a trip to Toronto for brunch and it was even better than i expected it to be. I had the asparagus and goat cheese omelet which came with sausage, salad and toast. Every ounce of it was ridiculous. The omelet was cooked perfectly and the goat cheese wasn't overwhelming. The toast seemed to be along the lines of oatmeal raisin bread but not quite. Whatever it was, it was delicious and so was the sausage. 

The mimosa is made with freshly squeezed orange juice and that honestly made all the difference in the world. I'm not a mimosa fan, but this was actually delicious. 

The vibe of the place was laid back and kind of hippy. Service was fast and everyone was extremely friendly. There's outside seating as well which makes for the perfect brunch when its warm outside. 

This is place is awesome and hands down has to be one of the best brunch spots in Toronto."}
{"text":"Excellent excellent espresso, second only to Sam James (and they have the award to prove it :o)) brunch is fantastic but the only reason I've dropped them a star is they're in desperate DESPERATE need of an extractor fan. Sometimes it gets so smokey in there I can hear the faint drone of the San Fran Bay Area foghorn trying to warn patrons they're about to walk into a table... or a waitress..."}
{"text":"Best coffee in Toronto. I can not go to other places after I had voodoo coffee. You can also buy coffee beans there. Nice work space with good music"}
{"text":"The sole reason I would come to Voodoo Child is to have coffee.  

Here coffee is taken seriously about their coffee. Different local coffee roasters' beans are featured with tasting notes and origin. So basically your experience each time of their espresso drinks might just be a little different?

Voodoo Child ($3.25)  a Macchiato made with a dash of cream instead of milk gave the drink a sweeter taste. 

Oh they do have coffee with booze? Maybe that next time? Bourbon Espresso.... sounds perfect on a cold snowy evening as a night cap.

And even a Cocktail maybe?"}
{"text":"Def college town cafe vibes. Patrons crochet while listening to the local indie riot grrl station.

Coffee, bagels, and liquor spiked brew being served up at 11am. Cocktail helped to knock the chill out of the air when braving the cold weather.

Grab your caffeine in a cup or crystal skull either way voodoo child is too cool for school  :D"}
{"text":"I was only in here for a little while but boy was it sweltering in there. With that being said, the coffee was excellent. I had the Voodoo Child which was served in the little skull glass. It was really good - rich, smooth and the espresso was strong. There seem to be a lot of outlets around and the barista was really friendly and helpful. It is a smaller cafe but very cozy."}
{"text":"Unbelievable brunch on weekends. Great service in a really cute little spot. Good hipster feelings as well. 

Their Americanos are fantastic and have full Flavor. There's a reason why they won some awards last year. A must try for anyone on the college strip."}
{"text":"Came here for some drink with my friends and I love how cute the place is.

The bartender was very friendly and make my latte in a skull mug with latte art.  It was so cute.

I like how they have combos for coffee and pastry for like $5 which is a good deal.

Definitely would comeback especially since they serve boozy coffee. :)"}
{"text":"Cute place, has a bench outside and open space so it's lovely on a nice day. 

Coffee itself is really good and they have several options as well. Latte art is on point! 

There isn't too much space here but there's outlets so if you want to do some work here then make sure you get here early!"}
{"text":"I've been in Toronto a month and I feel like I have already made lifelong friends at this place. The coffee is amazing. The people are out of this world. I don't drink alcohol so I can't say anything about the cocktails but have heard they are good. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"They take their coffee seriously and it shows.  The selection and quality is fantastic.  It is a narrow space and is simple inside with small, fun touches that are to theme.  

We came for brunch and really enjoyed it.  The bagels are freshly fire baked and as good as any I've had in Toronto.  I had one with cream cheese and smoked salmon that was excellent.  I also tried the goats cheese omelette that is accomanied with a fresh pear arugula salad.  The vinegret and the pear really complimented the omelette well.  Lastly we all shared the lemon maringue filled french toast which was delicious.  Personally I think it would be too heavy on its own, but to share it was unexpected and pretty amazing."}
{"text":"Rude barista and meh drinks. She was pushy and  repeatedly asked us to pay before we even got to get settled in and get drinks. The drinks weren't anything special either. Overpriced haven for hipsters."}
{"text":"Solid bourbon based drinks. 

It was a nice night. Starts with a boozey coffee 'bear and the snack' can't remember.  Cold espresso mixed with bourbon and bitters and a few other delicious options. 

Bartender/drinkmaster was very earnest. He really gave a $hit. 

Second round were top shelf bourbon old fashions. 

Delicious. Cool. Small spot with good chill tunes."}
{"text":"Fantastic spot. It is like walking into Grandma's home kitchen - except grandma has an awesome espresso machine and churns out a mean coffee yummmm"}
{"text":"Had brunch here one Saturday. It is quite a small place so my friend and I got seated at the bar where we saw everything in action. Ordered a latte and a salad - the latte came with beautiful latte art and the salad was fresh and made right in front of our eyes. The place has a definite hipster vibe and I definitely wouldn't mind coming back for coffee or brunch."}
{"text":"I just love the coffee here! I really haven't had a better latte in Toronto. Service is very friendly; it can get very busy so it's not always fast, but I don't mind this. There is free wifi and it's a nice little spot to sit and study or work for a little while. The decor is rustic and somewhat eclectic, and they were playing fun music when I was there on a Saturday afternoon. Four stars because there isn't a lot of seating and I had a cheddar bacon scone that was a little dry...but I'll be back!"}
