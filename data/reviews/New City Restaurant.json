{"text":"Good food, fast service HK style.
If you see a lineup, go somewhere else. We made the mistake of going on a Friday night.  waited about 15 min for a table, servers were obviously overwhelmed so we were patient.  Took another 15 min to get our water, tea and utensils. Ordered the food the first chance I got to get someone's attention. We ordered 4 dishes for four of us. First dish came fairly quick, 2nd took longer, 3rd even longer. After the 3 of us finished our food the 4th dish haven't  showed up yet. We decided not to wait any longer and asked for the bill, that's when the 4th dish came.  We had it packed up to go. It was a horrible dinning experience although food was pretty good. 

Go early, avoid busy times. 
Best dish we have tried was the beef fried udon."}
{"text":"very bad service and food. they didn't allow you to change to something else when you told them the food had weird taste, force you to kept it."}
{"text":"i've been dedicated customers since more than 10 years in new city restaurant. 1 of the top traditional hong kong restaurant in markham. food recommend - milk tea. milk tea/coffee. curry fish ball noodles. steak and fries."}
{"text":"Amazing cheap breakfast!

This HK-style diner is definitely the place to be for breakfasts. I love their egg sandwiches. It's super basic, but it's fantastic in its own way. The eggs are super thick, so thick that it actually squishes the bread! The bread isn't super thin (like some other places). What's amazing is that the egg actually warms up the bread a bit! I'm drooling just thinking about it.

Their afternoon tea menu starts at 2:30pm. I totally recommend the HK-style French Toast. It's basically two slices of super thick toast with a layer of peanut butter in between. And then it's deep-fried. Syrup and a slice of butter tops off this masterpiece. The toast was just absolutely amazing. It was deep-fried to perfection. The butter melts on top of the toast. Seriously, what more can you ask for? Their French Toast is definitely my go-to afternoon snack."}
{"text":"Finally, they open again~ new style and new looking ~~  very nice place to visit and sometimes it will get very busy during lunch hours . 

If you and your friends or family members want to try some HongKong style restaurant .. highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Came here one evening after wandering around not know what to eat.

The service is very fast and efficient. It's also cheap and very filling as they give ginormous portions.

Just don't expect this place to serve complex French cuisine marinated and seasoned to the hilt. It is what it is....fast, cheap and filling. 

Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Very amazing food. They are very friendly and price is very acceptable for the portion and quality"}
{"text":"Seated immediately.  Order taken quickly.  Food came out in about 7mins.  Ordered a Mixed Hot Plate which had a pork steak, beef steak, chicken wings, ham, sausage, fries and carrots in gravy.  Also ordered Curry Beef with Rice.  Comes with choice of soup and drink.  Chose Russian borscht and milk tea.  Food was good and filling and price reasonable. Will be back."}
{"text":"This cafe has been around for a long time and the menu hasn't changed much at all.

It's a decent place to grab food quickly. Chinese milk tea is good here.

Breakfast and afternoon tea usually has a long line up so be prepared."}
{"text":"Always the best HK cafe, staffs are friendly, food is right to the point and can't beat the best HK style milk tea in town."}
{"text":"I've came here since the late '90s, and I don't bother with any other HK-style diner in the Markham / Richmond Hill / Scarborough area.

Must tries:  HK Style Milk Tea, Pork Cutlet, Curry Rice noodle, French toast.  

Show up before 9:30 on Saturday / Sunday for breakfast or you'll be waiting for at least 15 minutes for a table.  Lunch rush on weekends start at 12:30 and doesn't end until 3:30.  It's a very popular place with residents around the area."}
{"text":"I love this place and i go here all the time! Many non asians would find it weird because there are waitresses yelling orders and yelling for bills but thats what HK cafes are all about, but don't expect anything fancy. Service is super quick and that is really good because this place is often PACKED. Sometimes even line out the door packed. And the thing about how busy it is, the waitstaff will never try to rush you out and are super friendly. They know everyone because they have so many regulars that come daily and stuff. It's that good! The breakfast combos are really good and the the satay beef noodle is really great. Definitely my go to place for a quick cheap breakfast."}
{"text":"I used to be a loyal customer to this restaurant for years until one day I found a used band-aid in my soup and noodles. I was completely disgusted and we confronted the waitress who then went to the kitchen to find out and you know what... She came back and told us one of the chefs admitted to losing a band-aid and wasn't sure where he lost it!!! Disgusting!"}
{"text":"Totally worth it if you're in Markham! Every dish comes as a combo with soup and a drink"}
{"text":"Best HK style cafe there is in the area. I'm a big fan of their honey garlic wings/deep fried chicken wings and their ham in macaroni soup. 

In terms of why I always consistently come back here for the last 6-7 years: their drinks. Best iced lemon tea you can find in the area. Nomsss.

Great for breakfast, brunch and lunch; they close pretty early though so if you need to get a late night snack this will be out of the range."}
{"text":"Hubby and I came here for breakfast because I wanted their deep fried french toast.  

The thing is, my husband is a loyal Blue Ocean breakfast eater (the restaurant a few doors down).  His absolute fave is the satay beef in instant noodles.  So we went to New City b/c I knew we could order the same thing and also the french toast which is exactly what we did. 

We both ordered the satay beef with instant noodles.  In comparison to Blue Ocean, there is more beef at the one in New City.  The beef is tender and the satay sauce is good.  The noodles are instant noodles, not much comparison there.  However, Blue Ocean gives you a fried egg in the noodles and probably a spoonful of frozen vegetables.  On top of that, Blue Ocean's noodles come with a thick piece of toast, buttered and drenched in sweetened condensed milk.   New City doesn't include these things but their price is about 80 cents cheaper.  

Both restaurants include a drink with your meal.  The HK style milk tea at New City I would have to say is better - the one at Blue Ocean often has a slight sour aftertaste.  

I did order the deep fried french toast with peanut butter.  It comes with a large slab of butter on top and also syrup.  The toast is good but not great.  It felt heavy.  

Overall, I would come back to New City for their HK style milk tea and probably to try their lunch.  But if I had to choose in terms of breakfast (at least for the satay beef and instant noodles), I'd have to go to Blue Ocean - better bang for your buck."}

{"text":"You don't have to go too far to have a taste of HK style afternoon tea.  This is the place.  Be warned though; if you're a germ phobic and annoyed easily with loud conversation then this is not the place for you.

Like:
- menus are cheap and portions are fair
- consistency with the quality of food and drink
- quick seating regardless of how busy it is

dislike:
- tight space
- not so clean plates and cutlery lol
- 'meh' service

recommendations:
- lemon ice tea (best ice tea anywhere)
- steak and fries 
- pork burger and fries

Tip: go around 2:15pm to catch their 2:30pm tea time special."}
{"text":"My friends and I went back to this place yesterday for the countless number of times.  Needless to say, we love this place. The staff is friendly and it feels like a family-ran restaurant. Even though service is quick and efficient, it feels like there is a personal touch added to the service. 

The star of the show is the food. By far, this is the best sizzling plate I ever had at any Hong Kong style cafe (I've been to quite a few, none in Hong Kong though). Come hungry cause you will be stuffed. Bring a buddy to help you out while you're at it. I got the mixed plate which comes with every living animal you can imagine (not really but boy do they have quite the farm on that plate) piled high. I had the steak before and it is one big piece of steak, kinda like the ones you see in those food eating competitions. Other recommendations is the classic baked pork chop in tomato sauce and the baked grouper (garoupa? I think that's how they spelt it on the menu) in spinach cream sauce. 

The sizzling meals come with soup, garlic bread, main, dessert and drink for $13-16 depending on the meat you get. Pretty good deal but it is considered pricy from a Hong Kong style cafe stand point. If you're ever in the area, you need to check this place out!"}
{"text":"Excellent menu with great value. Good and quick serving of food. Good waitress service and is always packed with customers."}
{"text":"I will admit the decor isn't much to look and seems somewhat outdated. I would say to that don't judge a book by it's cover since it truly is a hidden gem. Although, the restaurant is always busy, they are efficient and rarely do you have to wait. The owner of the restaurant is really friendly and enjoys chatting with his regulars. Their HK milk tea is one of the best I have ever had and the iced lemon tea is also quite good. The proportion sizes are huge, on most occasions you can order one meal and still have some left over for later. The steak combos are so affordable; it comes with a soup and a drink. Sometimes, I like to order the beef brisket noodles, it is good on days when you are looking to eat something warm. They have a lot of variety, so you will be sure to find something you like."}
{"text":"*4.5/5 rounded up (because I enjoyed my meal so much)! 

Hong Kong style meals are relatively new to me, but what I ate and drank were so bomb, I will definitely be back!!

The Food (5/5): 2 massive and soft pork chops slathered in cream sauce with melted cheese ON TOP of seafood fried rice?! The picture honestly doesn't do this meal justice. The cream sauce is light without taking away any flavor from the pork chop, and the cheese was a nice stretchy touch to the meat+cream+rice combo! Also this serving size was insanely large. A girl my size wouldn't be able to finish it, I had to give it to bf to finish haha. So yes, I was VERY satisfied with my order. I am also happy to report their HK milk tea is super sweet (I'm a fan of sweet drinks), and their lemon ice tea thing (...?) was lemony sweet. Not brisk tea or nestea sweet, but lemony sweet. Try it, so cheap, just get them both :)

The Cost (5/5): $10 for the dish and + $0.75 for the drink. It's a steal for the portion size!~

The Service (3.5/5): Typical Chinese service. Better if you bring a cantonese speaking friend with you lol. However, their tiny menus come with an English side which is a nice plus.

The Ambiance (4/5): I came into this joint expecting nothing less than the hustle and bustle of a hong kong eatery. It's exactly what I got. We came in around 6:30pm, luckily snagged a seat and then there was a line-up almost out the door! It's fairly clean for a Chinese run establishment so couldn't ask for more."}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time. Obviously, over the years it seems the price has gone up but I think the portions that they give justifies it. I typically get the baked cheese and meat sauce on spaghetti or the baked Portuguese chicken on rice. It usually comes with a choice of soup and a drink. Friendly service. Restaurant is not too big and there is typically a lineup during lunch hour or afternoon tea time."}
{"text":"New City Restaurant is a Hong Kong style cafe located within Peachtree Centre in Markham.

They offer in Hong Kong Style Milk Teas and reasonably priced snacks such as french toast, curry beef brisket, noodle soups, pork cutlet bakes over fried rice, and fried fish and fries.

I ordered the curry beef brisket with rice (off-menu item) and it came with my choice of cream or Russian borscht soup, and drink (HK style milk tea).! $11.00 for this was reasonable, due to quality and quantity of food.

I will return next time and try the iced tea, and french toast stuffed with peanut butter!"}
{"text":"First time I tried New City Restaurant this morning, based off a yelp search for \"breakfast\"...

And let me tell you it was freakin AMAZING!!!!

Im Canadian but love trying asian style breakfast and this place made me feel so welcomed unlike most asian places (if youre not asian) and the service was super quick even though there was a line up.

Super friendly waitresses and staff!

Honestly I didn't know what to order! Everything on everyones table looked soooooo delicious omg!

I love pasta anything and I saw they had breakfast with noodles or delicious looking soups man! Tough choice so i picked something a fellow yelper tried, Satay Beef soup! Honestly 12/10!! And I had to try the french toast everyone was talking about - soooo glad I did! She even put peanut butter inside. I truly was in heaven this morning. 

Oh and to make it better - I asked for iced lemon water and she brought it back with a spoon in it, let me tell you it was the best thing I have ever drank. She musta put magic honey in it because it was hands down the best! So refreshing!!!

Im definitely returning, I have to try everything on their menu. Loved loved loved it!!! 

TRY IT!"}
{"text":"I dropped in around 10:30 in the morning and as usual it is mad packed with people lining out the door. The snappy, blunt way they run the business might not be everyone's fancy, but it gets the job done, keeps service consistent and turnover rate at an acceptable level. The food is great for the price point you pay and it hasn't changed over the years i have visited this joint."}
{"text":"This place has been here forever. Ever since I can remember peach tree plaza. It's a Hong Kong style cafe that serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner. It's very cheap and the portions are quite big.

If you're looking for a quick and cheap eat this is the place ! Sometimes they are quite packed so you'll have to wait for a table. They always have specials that you can get. These specials are basically combos that come with a soup or a drink for $10-$15

The last time I was here I ordered a baked chicken and tomato rice for $8.99. It came with a ice lemon tea which I had to add $1 to upgrade to cold drink. The portion of my food was quite big. I didn't finish and ended up packing it up for home and ate for lunch the next day. So $10 for 2 meals is quite delicious ! 

I would def recommend coming here !"}
{"text":"This is my all time favourite hk stlye restaurant. From breakfast, lunch, high tea to dinner, I always find something i like to eat. Their honey-garlic chickenwings are irresplacable... their baked pork chop in tomato sauce is also a favourite. Ive been coming here for 18 years"}

Rating: (9/10) Food, (8/10) Service, (10/10) Value, (6/10) Ambience, (5/10) Presentation, (8/10) Cleanliness

My Experience:  

Disclaimer: this is your quintessential example of a traditional Hong Kong cafe, no frills, no fancy service, just good food, incredibly cheap with quick service. 

At this point, New City is a staple of Markham, having existed and thrived for countless years. It's reputation travelled so far, that friends visiting from Florida have heard of New City and requested we go there.  

If you're familiar with HK cafes, you can stop reading and go ahead and pick your favourite HK dish. I won't be offended, cause I guarantee you'll be surprised by the quality of this restaurant. The highlight dish would have to be the French Toast, so go ahead and order that. I'll wait. 

If you're not familiar with HK Cafe, then this place might be a bit difficult to digest. The menu is vast and covers a large array of options. They have everything from rice, to pasta, to soup, steak, chicken, pork, garoupa (fish). 

For breakfast, I suggest a traditional macaroni soup with egg sandwich or even try out one of the instant noodle dishes (yes, instant noodle for breakfast). If you're coming for lunch, the baked rice/spaghetti are amazing or try out the Pork Chop or Fried Garoupa, my personal favs.

The service here is not come fancy attentive service. You need something, grab their attention, and they'll help you out quickly and with a smile. This is basically the Chinese version of a American Diner. They're quick, efficient, and here to get the work done. You might even find yourself sitting with some strangers, if you're with a small party at a big table. Don't be alarmed, this is just how it's done. 

Aside from delicious food at affordable prices, you really get an experience; a taste of bustling busy HK lifestyle."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy for a good price! I went for afternoon tea and it was relatively empty for a weekend. Service is quick and efficient. I like how the menus are already at the table so I don't need to wait for them to bring it to me. 

I got the spicy beef noodle soup and my friend got a fried pork chop with potato salad. 6.50$ each with a hot drink. I got the hong kong milk tea which was very concentrated here, great :). 

I really liked the flavors from the soup and the crispy pork chop was so good! 

Afternoon tea had about 20~ selections but they also have many many other things to choose from too. I'll definitely come back here if I'm hungry and in the area."}
{"text":"I'm so in love with New City Restaurant. It's kinda been my go to place on Saturday afternoons now.

The menu is hefty with choices (as is any hong kong food place), and the food is reasonably priced. 

The menu comes with pretty much anything that's standard with Hong Kong food and it's just super delicious here, with no complaints on the portion size. 

The first time I had came here, I jumped in really quick with the $18.99 Sirloin steak. It comes on a hot plate sitting on top of some delicious french fries, and you can also choose another side to go with it. It comes with a soup also and a drink. The sirloin was a hell of a lot bigger than I had imagined, and in all honesty it's worth the big price tag. Everything about the dish was delicious, down to the fries and the gravy poured upon it.

The second time around, the fiance and I were super hungry and decided to both get a steak and fries choice, but this time being $7.99 (i believe) off the tea menu. And a bowl of your choice of noodles with a bunch of meats. Spam, hot dog, bacon, ham, pork belly you name it! We opted for instant noodles to go with this one. It also comes topped with 2 fried eggs.

The steak and fries were great, but fairly so, the steak wasn't as good as the humongous sirloin steak, but it's nearly half the price so I'm not complaining. The bowl of ramen was good, the soup base I was really so so about and don't really think it's worth raving about. Bu the amount of friggin' meat they put into this bowl made it 100x worth it! The instant noodles did remind me a lot of Mr.Noodle though, which kinda sucked.

Food and drinks come out super fast, which I can only assume it's because there's usually a line out the door so they kinda want to do a fast rotation of customers to limit the queue time.

This place is usually packed with a 15-20 minute waiting time during the lunch hour on weekends. So prepare for a wait. Absolutely worth going here though! This will always be my go to place for delicious Hong Kong food on the go .... Well, until I find something better."}
{"text":"I saw the rave reviews of this place on Yelp and decided to check it out. I'm not a huge fan of HK food but I don't mind it. First things first, if you don't speak Cantonese, you're probably gonna have a hard time understanding what the workers are asking. They asked me what kind of soup of wanted and I didn't know what they were saying until they repeated it like 3 times. Please bring a Cantonese-speaking friend with you... I'm half joking.

I ordered the Black Pepper Steak with Spaghetti but they gave me white rice instead of spaghetti. It's okay though, not a big deal. However, the steak was very thin and fatty. Not okay. My friend got the Black Pepper Chicken Breast with spaghetti but they also gave her rice instead. The chicken breast was also very fatty.

The food is just decent here. For the price, I guess you really can't complain. Worked out to about $12 per person after tips and we were all full."}
{"text":"I have to give this place a 5 due to its authenticity to a Hong Kong cafe. The loud bustle, rushed and impolite servers, and oily food stands for all that makes up the typical HK food experience. As a person who grew up in Hong Kong, this place makes me feel right back at home-- and if you want to experience the Hong Kong culture, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"A real legit Hong Kong style diner. Inexpensive meals and still fill your stomach with delicious food. It is simple comfort HK food. Really fast, efficient service. Dishes come out hot and they taste great. You really can't go wrong with this spot."}
{"text":"Wow, this is the place I been looking for after I came back from my HK vacation. Very traditional and bring back my memories of the great time I had I HK. I had the chicken breast on rice and the breakfast platter and they were out in no time, just like the service is hk diners. Not only is it fast, it's cheap too! Definitely come give this place a go!"}
{"text":"This is the place to go if you are craving french toast HK style! 

The steak dinner combo is good value and tastes decent as well as the baked portugese chicken platter. (If you follow my reviews then you will notice I order alot of the same stuff to benchmark my opinions and also stick with the food I enjoy eating)

Order any of the soups at your own risk. They lack any true taste and are really watered down. 

The service is \"meh\" and this place is really busy at times so try to avoid the rush or you will find yourself standing in front of an ever-swinging front door as people pile in.

Let me end by saying again the four star rating is mainly for the french toast!

Bring cash!"}
{"text":"My new go to HK cafe. Priced well and local (to me anyways)

Food: 4/5 Priced well during tea time special.
Service: 3/5 Efficient as all HK cafes
Environment: 3.5/5 Busy and not pretty but fast.
Washrooms: 4/5 Okay.
Worth it?: 5/5 Great for cravings.

Before I start this review I just have to say, this is why I love Yelp. Without Yelp I would not have found this HK cafe right in walking distance to my house. I know this place has been around for years and loved by many according to reviews, but it's new to me. 

With the sad news that my old go to will be closing down in September due to the P Mall expansion, I went on Yelp to find a new place. With a solid review base and it being a kilometer from my place I had to give this place a try. 

Luckily it was during tea time special so it was a great time to check out their special menu. We had their chicken curry rice and fried beef pho noodles. The pho noodles we're pretty good but the chicken curry rice definitely hit the spot. I now know where to go when I have a curry craving."}
{"text":"It's been two years since I've written a review about New City, and man... something has definitely changed about this place. 

I don't know if the chefs changed or if my taste buds have altered over the years, but they don't make their baked rice as good as I remember them to be! I usually get the baked rice with steak in tomato sauce. The sauce tasted bland and it didn't even taste like tomato at all??? Rather, it had a distinct taste to it that made me lose my appetite after the first bite. 

I also got the steak with rice in black pepper sauce. I understand I don't except some A-grade Wagyu beef quality steak, but I didn't expect to be served something surrounded with 90% fat & almost impossible to cut. (My hands were cramping by the end)

Of course, the prices have always stayed at a reasonable price & has been my main reason for coming back repeatedly."}
{"text":"Decent Hong Kong style ??? cafe. Tons of choices going from typical ???? fried noodles and rice to Chinese dishes to baked dishes and sizzling steak. The best part is, they're Ine of the only restaurants opened for breakfast at 7 am in Markham and for like $5 drinks included!! 

They're located in a corner across from Eat With Fun ?? Chinese BBQ place. Nothing special to praise about not thing horrible to complain about. Its your average HK style cafe.

For the price that you pay they really give you a good portion of food. Oh they also have TV for those who like to watch TV while you eat????! But they actually play the TV so if you go early you get the black and white TV shows from the 90s or random talk shows in the afternoon. It's decently clean too and don't charge you a quarter for a take out box. So box away ... unless you're environmentally friendly .. bring a container!!"}
{"text":"Under average greasy spoon. Low hygiene level. Cheap food, needs to save for diahreah meds."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and it has never disappointed me. The breakfast sets always come with a hot hk milk tea which is my favorite.
I just wished they had some other specialty items to make this place stand out from the rest becauae they only have standard items. Why is it so hard to find hk rice roll with sauce on top here?"}
{"text":"Located in New Kennedy plaza. Food is good. Service is fast. I had a tomato sauce chicken rice. The chicken is huge and I felt satisfied. Typical hongkong style cafe restaurant. Recommended."}
{"text":"Good decent HK style restaurant. Ordered a baked chicken in tomato sauce and a curry beef brisket rice. The baked rice is good but not like it's an extraordinary dish but I like it. However, the curry beef brisket wasn't too good; some pieces are kind of chewy and not soft. At Friday night there is quite a bit of people even it's at 8:30pm so you can visual how busy this place would be in earlier time. Overall, it's still one of the good HK style cafe in Markham."}
{"text":"Breakfast, brunch, lunch, and teatime is the best here! I love their satay beef instant noodles, it's my fave comfort food. I also love how fast their service is ~ If you ask for one thing, you get it right away, they never forget about you. Come here for yummy Hong Kong style cafe food, and amazing fast service!!"}
{"text":"Came back a 2nd time. Place was packed on a Sat afternoon.  Remember to get a number from waitress if you are waiting in line.  Got the baked half cream sauce and Tomato sauce baked rice. Was very good and flavorful. Also got their huge French toast with peanut butter stuffed inside.  It is not on the menu you just have to ask them it was around $5.00.  It was massive, def hit the spot."}
{"text":"This is really a 2 1/2 stars. Pretty average. No much to say about this place. I've definitely had better."}
{"text":"Got the sizzling steak combo...great deal...comes with a lot of things, definitely too much food for one person. Would also recommend the cold HK style tea. Afternoon tea specials are a pretty good deal, from 2:30-6pm, the dishes are $1 less than the dinner price. We also ordered the satay beef instant noodles and it was better than we've had at other HK cafes...definitely will come back to try some other dishes!"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with Honey Garlic wings and fries.. :) ...

So yummy and cheap and comes with a drink!!

The service was pretty good ~ The older women are always very nice..!! Love this place for a quick afternoon tea on a weekday"}
{"text":"What's not to like? I've come to New City for years. 

This place is your typical loud, ladies yelling orders across the place, chinese cafe restaurant. Great for a quick lunch or breakfast.

Food: Great. Nothing amazing but their fish and chips and their noodles are delicious. There isn't anything on the menu that is outstanding or that is very disappointing. 

Location: Parking can be a bit of a hassle during weekend prime times (10:30am-1pm) but the mall is pretty big and sooner or later you'll find something. It gets busy though.

Service: Like I said... non Asians would find it weird that the waitresses are literally shouting for the bill from halfway across the room... but this is what HK is all about baby!

Price: Price is cheap. Like $7-8 bucks for your average meal. A lot of them come with a free drink too!"}
{"text":"-- My First Impression --

I am a big fan of Hong Kong style cafes and am always looking for new ones to try around my neighbourhood. I was quite impressed with the decor of this restaurant. I believe the owner put some thought into the design and it looks different from other HK style cafes. The restaurant looked cleaner and more modern than other HK restaurants. Their menu has a large selection of dishes. 

-- Food and Drink --

We ordered 2 set meals:
1. Baked Meat Sauce and Cheese and rice $8.50 which came with a Russian Borscht soup with an Iced Tea (0.75 extra) 
- The meat sauce was delicious. I liked how it wasn't very sweet. However, I could tell they didn't bake the meat sauce. They only used a culinary blow torch to melt the cheese on top. The portion size was quite big. I could eat this for 2 meals. Their iced tea was very, very sweet. I ordered less ice, less sweet for my iced tea but the drink was still 2/3 filled with ice. 

2. New City Big Bowl Noodle (???????) $7.95 with an Iced Tea (0.75 extra)
- The bowl of noodle was very worth it in terms of the quantity. It came with luncheon meat, bacon, ham, double eggs, sausage, B.B.Q. Pork (Chasiu). You could pick any kind of noodle in the soup (macaroni, vermicelli, spaghetti, rice noodle or instand noodle.) My hubby picked the instant noodle. You couldn't find a reason to complain about their portion size. 

-- Overall --

 Given that the competition for HK style cafes is very intense in Markham, I will still keep exploring different options, I would come back for the quantity."}
{"text":"Good food at cheap price! Everyone work there with no smile on their face, and they will pretend they don't see u cos they all busy."}
{"text":"I go here really often and it's great! 

Recommendation: 
Definitely french toast- made with thick toasts (they cut it themselves!), its crispy on the outside and peanut butter goodness on the inside; smeared with butter and dripping with syrup on top, so yummy.

Anything fried, except for french fries- they fry everything on order, nothing gets pre-fried, so it's nice and juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside

Not so great moments:
Food and Drinks- I got a really weak HK style milk tea before and sometimes they dump too much sauce on my baked dish

French fries- obviously they bought frozen fries and just fry it on order, ew...

Other note:
As with many HK style cafe, food is the main character and everything else should not be considered. Service will not be great (aka. ask to share tables, be impatient if you don't order quick, just dump all the utensils at you), but will deliver great food at great speed. 

Overall: 
The four star is well deserved because of the food. And since food is the life of the restaurant, it gets weighted more. :)

I took a star off mainly because of the not so great moments. Partly because it's a little pricier compared to other HK style cafe that are on the same level (as in not much decor, not much service, just eat and go kind of deal). Good food and restaurant presentation translates to manpower which means labour cost which means bigger bill. Vice versa, lack of presentation means I expect my bill to be cheaper. Another small factor is the hygiene is not so good sometimes. I saw a cockcroach there before."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this restaurant for years now, first time checking in on Yelp.
Lots of options, huge portions, delicious food, amazing prices and speedy service. I usually get their sizzling steak and fries. It comes on a hot plate with black pepper sauce (or garlic sauce) on top. It all comes up to around $18 -- this includes your choice of drink, soup and garlic bread on the side. I'd say the price is very reasonable, especially since the size of the steaks are massive! This restaurant is very reminiscent of authentic Cantonese cafes that I used to go to in Hong Kong. Favourite restaurant ever."}
{"text":"Popped into this HK style diner a couple of times now and I love their curry dishes (all priced at $9.99). The curry dishes come with Borscht or cream soup and a drink so the prices are quite fair given the size of the dish as well. 

I really like the HK style curry. There's not a lot of veggies in it but the protein + potato with onions and rice is exactly what I like for this type of curry.
The Borscht soup is a little on the saltier side but I prefer it over the cream soup. 

The soy bean drink is also very yummy as is the iced lemon tea but cold drinks are an additional $1. 

Overall, I do like his place. Most of the dishes are priced under $10 so it makes it very affordable but even the $15-$20 dollar dishes look super good and large portioned when they come out of the kitchen. 

Service is fast and friendly. Portions are huge and prices are good. I would definitely return. CASH only and afternoon tea ends at 6:30 PM."}
{"text":"I truly don't understand the hype around the places, it's crowded, slow and poor service and the food is very mediocre. I think the only reason they keep busy is because of the lack of HK tea choices in the area"}
{"text":"This is probably the best HK style cafe we've been to. The food was tasty and the service was fast! We ordered the curry beef brisket with rice - tasty with the right amount of spice. Portuguese chicken on rice - big portion and tasty. There was another beef brisket dish that was in the Portuguese chicken sauce on rice that was also really good. Lastly, also ordered the tomato pork chop on rice. That one came with 2 ginormous pieces of pork chop. Out of the 4 dishes it was the biggest but the tomato sauce wasn't that good. Each dish also came with soup and a drink. All that for under $10 each!"}
{"text":"Don't expect anything fancy in this HK style Cafe.   It serves delicious,  simple Cafe food.   I love coming here on the weekends for the breakfast specials (aka brunch).   You can get a good sized meal -  soup noodles, toast, ham omelette and a hk style tea for under six dollars.   They also pump out the food quick.   I got my food in less than five minutes of ordering.   

Worthwhile eating here when you're in a rush and looking for some filling cheap eats."}
{"text":"A restaurant that I have been coming to since I was born.  A hk style diner that is always busy packed with people..  Food is not exactly THE best but,  for the price,  convience and quality of food,  my friends and I always seem to always find ourselves back here over the years. 

Pork neck on rice is good,  and baked rice is good,  steak sizzling plate is really good too.  If you are getting sizzling plate,  ask for the steak to be cooked rare or even a bit slightly under rare,  so by the time it comes out and you finish cutting into it,  it becomes medium rare :o"}
{"text":"This place was great for breakfast, and their service was quick as well. Price is reasonable, fairly cheap and quality is better than Phoenix. The only thing is, the tables are quite close to each other... but, that's OK since the meal is less than 30 minutes."}
{"text":"Frequently come here for a quick lunch / afternoon tea and or dinner! If your looking for fast, inexpensive & good chinese hk style cafe - here is the place you should come to! Usually very busy during weekends afternoon tea and even breakfast time! I think this restaurant has been running for 20 yrs! Comfort chinese food - yum!"}
{"text":"Great place for HK diner food. Breakfast, Lunch or Dinner are all great. Went for lunch yesterday. Had chicken steak in black pepper sauce with rice. Very tasty. My sister got the assorted balls and other things on rice noodles. Nice and big portion size. You only need to order one thing each to be really full. Fast, efficient service and great prices!"}
{"text":"This place is like our kitchen. We come here almost once to twice a week. Most of the servers know my husband and I by name it's kinda nice. The food quality is great for the price. I can't even complain. We love coming here either for breakfast or afternoon tea time. Weekend mornings and afternoon tea is jam packed so make sure you get there early if you need a seat for more then 2 people. Otherwise sometimes the wait is roughly 20 minutes."}
{"text":"My fiance, his family, and I came here for a quick breakfast before we started on our trip back home to NYC. The restaurant was pretty crowded with limited seats. Our family had to sit in separate tables, since there was no large table to accommodate for a party of eight. 

The breakfast menu was very basic and with options like congee, butter toast, macaroni noodle soup, instant noodle soup and etc. They also had HK Style  Coffee/Milk Tea, regular hot coffee and etc. The food was priced well and super affordable! All of the customers around the restaurant just had their breakfast quickly and than left.

I shared a table with my fiance, his brother and sister in-law. I ordered the instant noodles with spam and a fried egg - super simple, basic and light. I haven't had a breakfast like this in ages. The broth was very simple and basic. The instant noodles was cooked just right, not overcooked. The HK Style Coffee/Milk Tea was very fresh and filled with just the right amount of caffeine.

Overall, the service was very quick and on point. Decor could be improved. Breakfast was easy, simple and affordable. I would definitely recommend this place if you want a quick fix for a breakfast. I wouldn't recommend coming here if you're looking to enjoy breakfast with a big group. There's not much space or tables available for a large group. I saw some of their baked dishes for lunch, so I would definitely want to come back and try out their afternoon meals."}
{"text":"Good hong kong cafe, but the service is definitely lacking here. I'm sure there are other cafes that are better, but this place wasn't bad."}
{"text":"Price Hike. I've been a regular of this place since I live very close by. If I ever need to get a quick fix, New City was always first on my mind. I love their food, standard HK-style just the way I like it. But I came here recently and couldn't ignore the price hike. Their new renovations are nice and all, but I've always been a quantity-over-quality type of person. That's why I came here: for unbeatable Asian prices. But these prices just don't cut it for me anymore. Or maybe I'm stuck in my old ways (& days)? Remember when you can get a ??? meal for $3? The cheapest thing on that menu now is $6. Upgrade to a cold drink and you're looking at an $8 meal, MINIMUM. For a bowl of noodles ($10) that I can finish in three slurps (true experience), no thanks. Overall, I just feel more and more ripped off every time I come here. Recently, I called for take-out and asked to switch to a cold milk tea, I got \"add $3 lah~\". What?! No way! I kindly refused, and ordered from next-next door instead. These last two experiences are what triggered my review. So, if I want a cheap quick fix, sadly New City's not the place for me anymore. Even if I'm in a hurry, I would travel elsewhere for a more competitive pricing of the same quality HK-style food with more variety and quantity."}
{"text":"Few Hong Kong cafe restaurants next to each other here. I usually frequent Ming's a couple spots down. Similar prices and food. However the beef steak was defiantly better here! Always fast, piping hot and tasty. Service during my visits were always prompt and courteous; but you do notice that the servers sometimes bickering among themselves.

1st time visiting this place and you might assume they forgot to give you a menu, but don't be alarmed. It's actually 4-5 ghettoly laminated miniature cards wedged between the hot sauces."}
{"text":"Came back to visit New City cause my friends wanted HK Style cafe food. I will be quick as this is just an update. This place never disappoints and I am upping my rating to 4 stars. The food portion was huge as seen on the picture I took of the cream sauce with garoupa on spaghetti. I liked the fact they restaurant didn't dump a heavy amount of cheese (in fact there were none). Also the fish wasn't deep fried, instead it was coated with some egg wash and then pan fried. This I like a lot as it still preserves the fish and it's juice. I am definitely coming back some time for other food choices."}
{"text":"Best bang for the buck HK style food. Very fast service. Decent prices for large portions. Food taste clean - I don't feel like crap after meals like I do with other HK style cafes."}
{"text":"New City Restaurant is a Cha Chaan Teng quite reminiscent of the tea restaurants you see in Hong Kong. The place has been here for a very long time and has since gone through renovations.

Food: 3.5/5
Ordered the chicken curry with rice, and portuguese baked rice (both come with soup and drink). Mainly two types of soup to choose from (cream of mushroom or russian borscht), I chose the borscht. The soup was too oily, very peppery, with either a lot of salt or MSG. The overseasoning left my throat feeling dry. Fortunately, the set comes with a drink of choice, so I ordered a HK style iced lemon tea (refreshing and difficult to mess up).

The chicken curry was pretty spicy, but still tolerable. Presentation was neat, and the chicken was moist. The curry to rice ratio was upsetting because there was too much curry with not enough rice to balance it out. The curry wasn't amazing, but it wasn't awful either.

The portugese baked rice on the other hand was great. Veggies had flavour, the sauce was creamy and savory, and the chicken was tender. The potatoes might have been pre-roasted before being baked, making their exterior crispy and delicious. Overall, a really good dish.

Decor:
Since renovations, I feel that the ambience is more uplifting. The lights are bright and modern, which make for a lighthearted eating experience. Everything feels a lot cleaner than before, definitely a step in the right direction. A very modern and clean design for a cha chaan teng.

Is it worth it?
Yes. The place is worth a try at the very least. The food is satisfactory and the prices are very standard. Many gripe about the prices increasing, but inflation is bound to occur and when other places are also increasing their prices, it just becomes an average. Overall, New City is an average restaurant cafe, good for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"My family has been coming here before I was even born! Staff is nice, quick and know what they're doing - nice ladies.

Everything is fairly reliable - we've hardly ever had a complaint. Everything always tastes the same."}
{"text":"One of my favourite hk cafe places! Although the prices have been going up dollar by dollar the past few years, their portions can justify the prices. Also, the quality of their food is great. I usually get their baked tomato porkchop with rice, a classic in hk cafes. Tomato sauce isnt to sweet or sour but perfect for my taste buds. They're also known for their curry beef brisket. Strong asian curry flavours with a generous amount of brisket. 

Service is super fast, and you usually get your food within minutes. This spot is very packed during lunch and afternoon tea hours, but staff works fast enough to satisfy you the best they can."}
{"text":"Love this HK cafe. Can get quite busy on weekends. They recently renovated so they're much cleaner looking now. Their Guilin noodles are super yummy."}
{"text":"Hong Kong style cafe.

Yummy traditional fast Hong Kong food in a clean and tidy establishment. 

Was expecting rude waitresses but far from it. The service was good and the staff was friendly!!"}
{"text":"stood at the door for 5 minutes. 3 of the workers saw me walk in but no one approached me to greet or ask how many people. I continued to wait. Soon a middle aged chinese lady buds in and the waitress gives her a number. The service here was so bad that I didn't even bother to wait to try their food. Saving my money to take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Even better that it is now renovated. Clean and comfortable environment. I love coming here for the steak and fries. They steak is always cooked med rare and fries are crispy. I really like the black bean sauce they put on the steak, compliments it really well. The pricing is great as well, under 15 per person for steak. I always come here at least once a month. If you going during peak times(11-1pm) often the wait time can be 10-20 minutes. The drinks are great as well, always flavoured right."}
{"text":"Summary: reputed player in the HK style restaurant cafe business delivers ninja-speed service and okay food for above average prices.

Top Must-Get: curry beef brisket on rice
Top Regret: cream of turkey soup

Tucked in the northwest end of the New Pearl Plaza, New City has been around for a long, long time: it was there before Ming's, before Ocean, before Keung's, before Chef Papa... It's the veteran. However, over the years, it's lost a bit of charm.

It's gone through renovations and definitely LOOKS better than it used to: it's now got a classy wood decor look and has somewhat uncommon booths with just two seats (most come with 4).

At the crux of it all: service is fast, and the food is decent but hardly spectacular anymore.

They have three different menus, and the lunch one is broken into three sets of price tiers ($9, $8.50, $8.25). These are slightly above average prices for what you're getting (it is definitely not the cheapest of its kind in the plaza, and suddenly the longer waits at Ocean make more sense). They've also joined the long list of restaurants propagating extra fees: $0.50 for takeout, $1.00 for cold drinks instead of hot, and $0.75 for honey. 

I ordered a curry beef brisket with rice.

They pump out the complimentary soup very quickly. However, the soup was very bland.

On the other hand, the curry was fair sized and quite yummy. Just a bit of kick (so spice lovers, avoid it), but the meat was soft and tender, and the potatoes had a crunchiness within the softness. It was actually great curry!

However, all in all, the pricing, soup, and cramped seating detracted from a great main dish."}
{"text":"I am a costumer of their for 5 years. This is a traditional hk style restaurant where their food and services never disappoint me. Their food delivery time is also incredibly quick. This is the best place to go if you need to grab a quick meal."}
{"text":"Food is always good here. Been going for years!  Would've given a higher star rating until now. Having the usual breakfast when a roach decided to walk up the wall from between the booth's table and wall!!  It just sat there in the ledge staring at us eating. We asked for the bill right away and showed the server. She just looked and shrugged!  Not sure if we'll go back. So sad to say goodbye to a regular dig. I guess all restaurants have their critters... It's just how well they keep them hidden?"}
{"text":"I love the baked pork chop tomato rice.  It comes in a massive portion.  I tried chicken on rice with garlic sauce today.  It's my new favorite. The french toast was perfect only i couldn't finish it.  It's a meal in it self.  Great milk tea but i usually get it with less milk."}
{"text":"I've banned this place from my books a long time ago when I saw someone in the kitchen step in the serving table with their SHOES. I came back to see if they're any better because of the reno. Answer: nope. 

They changed some of their plates so they are no longer the cheap plastic ones your mom only uses to cut vegetables. However, their bowls are still the cheap plastic ones... The ones with a cartoon bear picture with some lame English phrase like \"forever friends love\". And what's even worse is that the colours have already faded, and the bottom of the bowl is grainy from wear and tear. 

The cups they used to serve tea was so old it was foggy. Nuff said. 

These plastic bowls are not meant to serve hot food, like the soup I was served because it came with my meal. The colours are probably toxic, or at least unsafe, for human consumption. You use these bowls for cold food like cereal? Ok. But not hot food! 

The shanghai noodles I ordered were super oily. After I took one bite, I felt very greasy. My mouth was coated in 3\" of oil. Yuck. Ages ago, this place would fry their udon crispy and I'd recommend it to everyone. If you don't like gallons of oil, stay away from here. 

Finally, the portions were tiny. They don't even  cover the bottom of the plate. 

Resounding no from me."}
{"text":"Went for the first time.  Most dinner deals under $10.  Super fast service.  Funny that waitress remembered all our orders and delivered them to right person.  Most places they just drop off the food.
Milk tea was good.  Soup was average.  Spaghetti with meat sauce was surprisingly good.  Satay beef rice noodle had good wok hay and lots of beef.  Best value was the fried fish cutlet and pork chop meal - crispy coating on fish and pork chop.  Black pepper steak was ok but Ming's noodle and Maydoh is tastier and better.
Would visit again if i wanted HK diner food in the area."}
{"text":"Very good place to go if you are looking for Hk cafe style food. I always come to this place because the food is decently priced, food comes super fast, and service is pretty good. 

My favorite is their baked spinach and fish rice. Unlike other places, they actually give you fried rice instead of white rice. The fried rice just makes the dish that much better. 

The other food that I also love are:
- French toast (I think they make the best in Toronto)
- fish ball noodles
- honey garlic wings
- garlic sauce with chicken and rice 

Highly recommend this place!

Ps: they have very good  chili oil"}
{"text":"Definitely a popular place for an inexpensive cha Cheng teng food parking can be difficult to find at times especially on the weekends afternoon tea special is till 6pm we had the beef brisket beef tendon hor fun and comes with a drink service is as expected and place is clean worth a try will try other items next time"}
{"text":"4 stars 

Increased prices after renovations. Although the food is still good, it doesn't offer the same value as before"}
{"text":"If you need some Hong Kong food, this is the place to go. Have been eating there regularly, they never make you disappointed. Food is good, traditional Hong Kong taste makes you miss Hong Kong even more. Lemon iced tea is a must get."}
{"text":"this is the best hk style cha chan ten so far I think.The food and price is good, the services are fast. Whenever we want a fast and easy meal, we will go there."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of traditional hong Kong food! Loveeee it!! 
Every time I come here, the place is quite full. Expect some wait time during weekend lunch hours. Their portions are quite big (at least for their baked items) so sharing is not a bad idea. I have tried their following items:

- Baked chicken with tomato sauce
- Baked ox tongue with creme sauce
- Baked beef brisket with Portuguese sauce
- Baked pork chop with tomato sauce
- Curry beef with rice

All the mentioned dishes are very common traditional HK items and this place makes it up to par! Their HK style milk tea is quite good too and I believe it previously won awards too. 
Don't expect a super nice environment but the food quality is great and staff are friendly. You get your food fast too so it makes up for the wait time. 
Next time I want to try their tea sets and noodles!"}
{"text":"Super good hk style brunch/afternoon tea food! The restaurant is small and always has a huge line up so come early, esp. For altruism afternoon tea time between 2-6pm. I ordered the beef brisket noodle with vermicelli and it was okay. I feel there could have been more flavor but for the price, it was fairly decent! I saw another take with this huge piece of toast and I just had to try it out! It's basically french toast with peanut butter inside. If you don't or any syrup on it, it's salty. But with the syrup, ugggh it's delicious with the sweet and saltiness.

Make sure you get the milk tea as well! It's pretty good! The experience is very authentic with the waitresses telling you to hurry up, order and eat"}
{"text":"By far one of the best Hong Kong style restaurants in the Markham region.  They've been around for more than a decade now, and there's definitely a reason behind it!

Their service is amazing - their waitresses are quick, observant and almost never forget anything.  They also know the names of so, so many customers that frequent this place - it's honestly crazy!

Their prices have been creeping up in the last few years, but you can for sure get a lunch (maybe even with a bit of leftovers) for around $6-7 and a nice afternoon tea for around $5-6.  The quality of food is always amazing, their steaks are definitely something you should try at least once.  These tend to be on the pricier side of around $13, but well worth the quantity and quality of food you get!

Almost all of their set lunches/dinners come with a soup and drink, so those are always a good deal to get.  This is always filled during lunch hours, even on weekdays, so be sure to go early if you're keen on not waiting in line for ages.  

The portion of food is on the large side, so ordering two meals for 2, will almost always leave you with some leftovers!

All in all, a wonderful restaurant that's definitely been living up to and exceeding expectations for many years now!"}
{"text":"like the restaurant, but there is a really crummy band on youtube calling themselves new city.....they ruin it for me."}
{"text":"What happened to you new city? Yes u did an awesome job in the reno and it's beautiful but the food? What happened? Almost every thing I use to love about the food went down the drain for me....chicken wings, bolognese, baked rice...

Prices increased, food quality downgraded....I'm honestly not proud of it anymore...Did they change owners or something?

No clue but no longer my favourite HK style cafe."}
{"text":"Very reasonable priced for their foods. For $10, you can have a satisfying dinner which includes soup, the main dish and drink. The combo for sure will make you end up hugging your stomach for rest of the night!

The staffs are very welcoming and friendly. They give you recommendations and are friendly enough to have a small chat with you.

Although the decor of the restaurant is not too fancy, but nothing to complain for a quite fast serving restaurant.

It reminds us of a happy moment in Asia.

Will definitely visit there again! Very good!"}
{"text":"It's a fairly nice place if you're not expecting much! Despite its less than modern decor, it's quite popular. I went there around 11am and it was packed. I ordered a breakfast and it came really fast. It also included bread with butter and ham wrapped in egg. Also, it comes with tea, soya milk or coffee. My boyfriend ordered a tomato sauce pork chop rice that comes with a drink and a soup. However, the soup never came and we forgot about it. The rice plate was so huge that my boyfriend, a big eater, didn't finish it all. 

I tried the lemon iced tea and it was delicious! I also work in a similar place but the lemon tea was so much better than what I sell. 
I would go back there again for breakfast since it's so cheap."}
{"text":"A hole in the wall kinda place. An institution that every goes to when they can't decide what to eat. If it were solely based on efficiency, price and \"just to feed my hunger\" kind of review then I would say this place is as good as it gets.

I am going to give it 3 stars but before you throw your hands up in disbelief bare in mind that there are plenty of options within walking distance of this place. Yes, it can get cheaper in the food court next door and yes you can get better quality stuff (not necessarily better tasting) next door at Blue Ocean as well. But really for what it's worth and the kind of place this is supposed to be (a no frills, affordable eatery with a ton of options) they have fulfilled their goals.

This is authentically HK fast food as it gets and the quality of the food re-enforces that as well. But since I am a snoob and do look for overachievers... 3 stars it is."}
{"text":"Been coming here with my family and cousins since we were little. Service is always fast and the food is consistent. I mostly love their thick toast with peanut butter and condensed milk. :) oh and Ofcourse their HK milk tea and lemon ice tea. This is kind of like HK cafe style comfort food for us and I definitely love it. It's always crowded when I go, so it gets noisy and sometimes you share a big table with random strangers which can be really gross since some people have really rude eating habits...  But it's still a great place to go."}
{"text":"Came here after looking through Yelp reviews and stopped by for a quick meal.

It's pretty spacious inside, and seemed relatively busy on a Thursday afternoon.

Got a mini steak and fries for a quick meal and it was all right, nothing too special or amazing.  The food could be better... it seems like lower-end HK cafe style food, so maybe I'll come back later and try something else."}

- Afternoon tea menu has a good price point and decent food (2:30 - 5:00) 
- Cant go wrong with a Black Pepper Steak w/fries for $5 - including a HK style milk tea
- be prepared to wait in line, because this place is also PACKED fast during the weekends. 
- washroom is gross (dirty, old, etc ... )
- parking in this plaza tends to be a problem in the front (but you can usually find space in the back)."}
{"text":"How can one not like New City Restaurant? Serving quality HK cafe style food at fair prices, new city is a staple for Markhamites. I seem to always crave their tomato beef baked rice when I am away. yummmm..."}
{"text":"Since all the restaurant is packed so I came back since there was no waiting here. I ordered the baked fish with cheese macaroni. I started to eat half of it I realized there was more fish skin then fish meat. The only reason I didn't know at first is because the fish was fried first which I don't even like it. The fish was chewy and sauce was salty. 
The Russian botch soup has minimal taste too. This will be my last time here!"}
{"text":"Fast service. I can always rely on them to get me back to work in time during my 1/2 lunch breaks. They are always busy, often with lineups at the door. Thankfully, their turnover is quick.

The prices are great, portions are good and the afternoon tea menu is great value.

Their curry and French toast are a must try."}
{"text":"Update: my new go-to is Steak and Fries (afternoon tea menu, add $1 after the afternoon tea hours)

The Baked Portugese Chicken Rice and Curry Beef Rice is not bad.

I've been going to New City for years, whether for breakfast, dinner or afternoon tea. On a recent visit, I've noticed it's much quieter now; probably a lot of customers flocking to neighboring HK-style cafes. 

Dinner: Baked Pork Chop Rice - The pork is the best - 2 large pieces, tender and juicy with a hint of peppery taste and not overly salty. The fried rice is fragrant and egg-y. The one thing that I'd have to take points off for is the sauce - too red and thick that it looks unappetizing. In general, all the baked rice dishes are quite heavy.  Dinners come with a soup and drink. They recently raised the prices so I believe it starts from $8. 

This place has the best cold HK-style milk tea and iced lemon tea!"}
{"text":"I went here on an early Saturday night with two of my friends looking for some nice HK cafe style food. It was pretty busy here so I was looking forward to the food. There were quite a few nice reviews and it was the reason why we chose to eat here other than Blue Ocean just a few steps away.

I would have to say that the portions alone would be a reason for me to come back here. I ordered the Mixed Meat set menu meal which came with two pieces of garlic toast, a choice of cream or borscht soup, the main meat entree with your choice of sauce (which included two pieces of fried chicken, a pork chop, a hot dog, a piece of bacon, a slice of ham and a slab of steak) on a bed of fries, carrots and cabbage, with a choice of rice or spaghetti (or extra fries), a hot or cold drink and ice cream. I mean I know set meat menus usually consist of this stuff but that main entree was so much food that it was so worth it for me. Although my complaint was that it lacked a little flavour because I asked for a garlic sauce and I didn't really taste it. All that for about 15.99 or 16.99 I think, pretty worth still.

My friends also had the set meat menu, one had the pork chops and steak option and the other had the chicken steak. We found out that if you ordered fries as your carbs option, that it was weird that we would be defaulted fries and you could just get more so it sort of felt like it wasn't worth it in that sense. We also got a French Toast with Peanut Butter on the side and it was alright, we couldn't really taste the peanut butter as it was very subtle and that you would get corn syrup as the sauce so it wasn't very sweet. Some people might prefer that.

Overall, I felt like I got a really good deal and the food wasn't horrible, it just wasn't outstanding. So if you want to get something cheap for a lot of food then I think this is a good spot. I am willing to try their other food and I might have a change in heart about taste."}
{"text":"SIZZLE STEAK.

What's not to like about this place? The service was quick, and the food was tasty. 

3/4 of us got sizzle steaks, and we were not disappointed. The sirloin steak was 18.99 but it was a huge chunk of meat and the quality not bad, it was also cooked to medium like how it was asked for. The steak & pork mix was like $15.99 or so, and it was delicious too. I saw other tables getting a mix plate that had like chicken wings and other meats on the sizzle plate! Looked delicious. All of these meals come with garlic toast, a soup, a hot drink/soy drink or pop (or sub a cold drink for 75 cents) and ice cream.

The other guy at our table got a deep fried chicken leg which was so good, and also a fried noodle dish. Also good. 

Definitely will come back to try other items on the menu, but it would be hard to stay away from the sizzle steak hahahaha."}
{"text":"New City is one of the many HK style cafes in the GTA and Markham areas and probably one of the better ones. Food and price are both decent/above-par but it could improve in service a bit.

Food - 4/5: the food at New City is decent/pretty good. They serve all the regular HK dishes such as tomato sauce baked fried rice with pork chops/chicken and curry chicken/beef brisket with rice. The portions are also good, enough to fill you up. Most meals come with a soup and drink. The soup that I had was the HK style Russian Borscht (like a veggie soup) and it was pretty good, but noticeably watered down. For my drink I got an iced coffee, which was probably a 1/5 as it didn't taste like coffee at all and was way too sweet. However, i've had their lemon iced teas in the past and those were amazing.

Service - 2/5: service lacks a little bit as the waitresses can appear to be rude snd loud sometimes but I do not think that they intentionally come off as so. They are quick, blunt and straight to the point, trying not to waste any time at all (since the restaurant is always so busy).

Overall New City is worth paying a visit for the food, but if good service is a must then you may want to avoid this place."}
{"text":"I've been eating here since I moved into the area 18 years ago! The food has been consistently good and the service only gets better the more they get to know you. I love their afternoon tea specials and the Hong Kong style coffee and tea they serve here. The flavors are always well balanced and strong enough to pick me up in the afternoon.

All their baked rice casseroles are also consistently good over the years. The only downside is that their menu does not change very often (which I'm okay with!). Everyone I know always comes here for a meal after they've been out of town - whether for school or a trip. You'll definitely see familiar faces if you become a regular, just like everyone else eating there!

Seating is medium sized, around 20-25 tables, mostly in groups of 4-6 seats. Service is quick and they rarely miss an order. Be prepared for a wait outside though if you're there on a weekend!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite Hong Kong style cafe.  This place is sooo busy. especially on weekends, and during lunch break. 

I really like the variety selections on their menu.  Food is good, and it's inexpensive.  If I compare with other HK Style Cafe, this place is relatively clean.

My favourite dish: Baked Pork Chop with Tomato Sauce on Rice, Steak on Sizzling Plate (if I'm very hungry), French Toast w/ peanut butter during afternoon tea time

Love their HK style milk tea as well~~~~"}
{"text":"I'm often disappointed that restaurants in Markham barely get any reviews or ratings on yelp. Well I want to change that :)

New City is one of my favourite restaurants of all time. I pretty much come here every weekend for breakfast and occasionally for dinner. The staff pretty much recognizes us from coming here so often and though they don't take reservations, they have a fair \"first come first serve policy\". This is great because there's ALWAYS a long lineup. Staff is nice, some are witty, each with their unique personality.

Food is delicious and for the price you're paying, it's amazing value! This seriously beats McDonalds guys, like no excuse here. If you come here, I would recommend any of their breakfast for pretty much $5 (my dish also comes with egg, bacon, and toast) and the HK style French toast if you're here in the afternoon."}
{"text":"I like coming here for their steak meals. The serving is HUGE and the taste is pretty good too. My favourite is their chicken steak. Be sure to order the dish version without the hot pan, because the content is pretty much the same, but it's couple bucks cheaper."}
{"text":"Imagine coming here not knowing anything and sitting down. As you are looking through the menu you see a steak the size of a little child zoom past you. After that experience I know this place is amazing. Its a family owned restaurant who makes food at a fair price which you don't see that often. You will actually be surprised when you come here. A set meal for the steak is 20$ flat excluding tax. It comes with garlic bread, soup, huge steak around an inch thick, with a choice of rice, spaghetti, fries, and to top it off ice cream. You can get a cheaper version for 16 dollars which comes with a pork chop and a smaller steak. Its hard to explain this place with words you have to experience it on your own. Keep in mind that the waiters here are not that good at English. Bring Asian friend is recommended. All in all I love this place."}
{"text":"New City Restaurant has been here for quite a while and is located in the northwest corner of New Kennedy Square.

The sign looks like it's seen better days and looks a little dated, but the inside is clean and modern. Not too much seating for the size of its customer base though. If you're okay with it, you might have to share a table with another party if there are no smaller tables left. There is free Wifi available as well.

Normally I get a baked dish from here which is consistently good - baked pork chop rice with tomato sauce is my go to. Today I was here for tea time and decided to try their afternoon menu and it ended up being more of a two star experience. 

The average price for each dish was maybe 7 dollars - still not that cheap in my opinion especially for the amount we got. Normally if I pay a little more for a regular dish I can take half home for another meal but this time we finished it all for what I think is a similar price. 

We ordered a black pepper spaghetti with shredded beef. I was expecting black pepper sauce but it was more of a soy sauce chow mein style dish with black pepper. Meat was minimal and not a lot of spaghetti... which is already super cheap. Also, incredibly oily and not that appetizing. For $7 this was a ripoff.

We also got honey garlic wings with fries. To be honest I'm suspicious about wings at HK style cafes but my friend wanted fries. There were four large pieces of chicken with sauce and an okay amount of fries. Chicken was decent and was crisp and hot (temperature wise). The sauce had a little bit of kick to it - I suspect something like chili oil because of the chili flakes on the chicken and the pool of oil left when we were done. Sauce wasn't that sweet - more garlic than honey. The fries were standard frozen ones. Starchy and room temperature. Very meh - also not worth the money in my mind.

Meals come with a hot drink. Their HK milk tea is good and more on the creamy side when it comes to taste, but many HK style cafes make milk tea very well nowadays.

I'm giving this three stars based on my past experiences - this experience was definitely more like a two. My suggestion is just get the regular food as they're pretty good at that. Hoping to update my review with a better experience."}
{"text":"I really love HK breakfast places, especially those with all day breakfast for those who like to sleep in.  :-)

The first thing I notice is they asked if I am willing to share a table with other random customers.  This is unheard of in other cultures but in small Chinese restaurants (typically quick breakfast/lunch places) this is quite common during busy hours.

Today I ordered :

Special Combo C  (Bacon, Egg, Toast, Macaroni with Ham, and Choice of Drink)  $5.50

There was a little insect in my macaroni soup which was unappetizing.  Otherwise the food was wonderful.  

The menus are in Chinese but you can ask for English menus.  Nice menu selection, will try other items next time.  Waiters are quick and attentive.  It was pretty busy for a weekday afternoon, which must mean this is a good popular restaurant."}
{"text":"My friends LOVE this place - it's essentially Chinese comfort food - and it's not bad (great, in comparison to other HK Cafes around the city): the food is cheap and the amounts are sizeable. That being said, the quality of the food, for me, is just OK (HK cafe food is not MY go-to). Their curry dishes, both regular and Portugese style, are reminscent of what my friends parents used to make. Most of their dishes come with a choice of soup (borscht or cream) and a drink (their milk tea is AMAZING). Can't really go wrong with any choice here, as the price is right and you get LOTS of whatever it is you're ordering."}
{"text":"I have been here countless times. Fast food at extreme low prices. You can get steak and fries for $6 here as one example. 

I always get a HK style milk tea when I'm here.

Some must tries are the scrambled egg sandwich and the french toast. I know what you are thinking already. Its just scrambled eggs and french toast but trust me its done the right way here and without holding back any of the unhealthy ingredients. 

There are many other dishes you can try here and if you ask for an English menu they will give you like 5 different menus all with different type of combo offerings.

This place is always busy but the turnaround time is quick so even if there is a lineup you can expect to be seated within a few minutes."}
{"text":"The service here is terrible. The ladies would pretend they don't see me. 

My daughter and I ordered the pork chop with tomato and cream sauce baked rice. This plate was terribly.l made. The pork chop had more FAT than meat. The fried rice was half steamed rice which they didn't even bother mixing it properly (clumps). 

The borsch soup was terrible! They gave a lot of white pepper seeds to us (I think they purposely dug the bottom up to give it to us). My daughter and I thought the white seeds were some kind of beans. So when she started eating it. It burnt her tongue. She's only 4 and I even thought it was hot. 

The lady asked if I wanted my egg sandwich toasted. I asked if she can toast it lightly. She replied in a very rude tone \"it's either toasted or not toasted. I don't know what you are saying\". 

The honey lemon water tasted like lemon water.

I will not ever come back. It used to be better."}
{"text":"The number of check-ins I have on Yelp is just a lie, I had probably come to this place more than two hand fulls and New City never disappoints. 

This HK style restaurant has been around for a very long time, I am sure other Yelpers may also agree with their OG status. New city has always served up hk cafe fast food. Your typical ABCDEFGHIJK etc value meals. Who can beat alphabetical value meals which all come with a drink for an average $7-$8! 

The food portions are a good medium size portion. Not too small or too large. The environment pace is good because they're pretty quick most of the waitresses there are very attentive to you. Overall, the food is pretty awesome. It's cheap and tastes good. 

My most recent visit they had renovated the interior which looks really nice. New LED chandelier, new glass wall sidings, new floor tiles and all tables and chairs have been replaced. GOOD JOB new city!! I would of gave this place a perfect 5 stars but unfortunately the entrance area sucks. Especially when it gets busy people block up the entrance way and hard to get out.."}
{"text":"Mind you, I still come here every weekend like it's my bible. However, even I have to take away one star as I found their quality/service has dropped a bit.

Back then, your meals usually come out within 5 minutes of you ordering. However, in my past two visits I had to wait up to 15 minutes for my order. It's not a huge issue compared to other Asian cafes, however this place used to be known for its speed and quick turnovers. It is quite evident if you come in the mornings on weekends, as there's always huge lineups now, when back then you only get about 5-6 people waiting at once.

Secondly, their iced lemon tea has gotten really inconsistent. Some days, their iced lemon tea is the best you can find in the GTA, while other days like today their iced lemon tea is comparable to a regular Chinese fast food joint: Terrible. I can't see if it depends on who's making it, but the award for best iced lemon tea is slowly going towards Phoenix or Blue Ocean Cafe, where I've seen consistency from both places.

Could it be that some of the newer chefs don't have the touch as some of the veteran chefs in terms of balancing speed and food quality? I'm definitely gonna keep a closer eye in my future visits to this restaurant."}
{"text":"when I walked in, this place reminds me of a restaurant in HK. 
took a look at the menu, the apparent became very clear. this is just like HK restaurant. 
so, if you never been to HK. come to this place, and it will give you the feel of what they sell in HK.
first off. their noodles, not their best.
they specialized in the steak shimmer with tomato sauce. yea, tomato sauce over your meat. but that's how they like it.
most of the food over rice are as good as you can get apart from being in canada not in HK.
what else can I say, be brave and try up some HK steak over rice.
get some drinks also (milk tea or lemon tea. HK special)

The only bad part for most of the chinese restaurant is that they don't take credit card. which to me they are missing a lot of revenue without it."}
{"text":"This has to be the best HK style cafe in Markham. Their portions are ridiculously big and prices seem fair. Quality also has been consistent. I always get their chicken/fish meals here and you get to pick your own sauce. The restaurant also has been renovated recently so the ambience is way better now. Service is also still pretty okay. The only complaint I have about New City is how small their ice lemon tea is like the cup is more ice than tea lol."}
{"text":"??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? ????????????????

???????????????????????????????????????????? ???? ???????????????????? ????????????????????? ??????menu???????????????????????????????????????????menu?? ????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"This HK style cafe is always packed on the weekend especially in the afternoon. If you see a crowd of people waiting at the door, be sure to flag down someone to 'write you a number' so you are in queue for a table. I enjoy their tea time special menu (2:30pm - 6:00pm) which offers a variety of sweet and savoury items with a free hot drink of your choice ($1 additional to upgrade to a cold drink). Some of my favourites are the HK style French toast with peanut butter, honey garlic fried chicken wings with fries, steak with black pepper sauce and the beef brisket and tendon rice noodles in soup. For drinks, try the hot/ cold milk tea, cold lemon tea or hot almond milk! Decent food and decent price!"}
{"text":"My go to spot. My favorite breakfast spot. The best HK style food around. Lot of options for any mood."}
{"text":"Prices aren't what they used to be, but this place is the hallmark of what a traditional Hong Kong style cafe is - rude staff, fast service, consistent A-OK food.
New City used to be my go-to peasant choice, whenever I'm feeling broke af but still want a decent meal out, but prices definitely have gone up with inflation.
Food was still the usual, cream sauce baked chicken rice had nice sauce. Fried rice tasted fresh and didnt use ancient stale rice like Phoenix does.
I did get a major taste of dish soap when I got to the bottom of my soup, so was not a happy camper this visit."}
{"text":"Typical HK style cafe with breakfast and lunch specials..one of the better value ones in the area. The portions are generally huge, first place I have ever seen that gives two pieces of pork chop on the ketchup pork chop baked rice!!

The milk tea is decent, nothing special.

This place gets quite busy during the lunch rush and it is difficult to find parking in this plaza as there are many, many other restaurants."}
{"text":"When one hears Hong Kong Café, one thinks fast, cheap, Asian style diner food.  Basically its a \"Diner, Drive'in and Dive\" Asian Style.

New City Restaurant is a perfect example of one as it serves HK style food, fast, cheap and tasty.  Can't believe I've never been here before after all these years but was very happy to step in today to try it out.

The afternoon tea menu (230pm-6pm) is a great deal as all the dishes are under $8 and includes choice of drink.  HK French Toast?  Its here.  Fried chicken wings with honey garlic and fries?  Its here.  Curry fishball with ho fun noodles?  Its here too!

Today I tries the black pepper steak with fries set menu.  For $7.75 plus tax you get some serious value with a good sized beef steak, super hot fries and a choice of drink.  Seriously?  How can you go wrong here?  And it was the most expensive dish on the set menu!  After 6pm add a buck to the meal.

Service as with most of these places is quick and to the point.  You are basically in and out in 20-30mins.  Great value for your hard earned money!

{"text":"3.5 stars rounding up to a 4.

Ordered a Portuguese Baked Chicken Rice take-out, $12.10. This is one my favourite Hong Kong Diner Style dishes. 

Overall, the dish was pretty good and satisfying.

Boneless chicken meat chunks are stir-fried with bell peppers, onions, and potato chunks. Then the \"Portuguese curry is added to the wok to finish the meat and veggies. 

After that, some places will lay egg-fried-rice into a plate (this place just used plain rice) and then pour the stir-fry meat, veggies, and curry on top of the rice and finish it in the oven with coconut shavings to garnish.

Overall New City was pretty authentic for this dish and correctly priced for the portion.  Blue Ocean Cafe, a few units over sells a slightly smaller portion for a slightly cheaper price and no soup included."}
{"text":"We really liked the afternoon tea food options. We selected the black pepper steak and fries and it was delicious. The steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare and the fries were crispy. They were not stringent on the portion of the fries. Their Hong Kong milk tea had a great tea flavour and isn't watered down as in some other restaurants. The other dish we ordered, cow stomach and vermicelli soup, was too gingerly for my taste, but it wasn't too bad. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Super cute Hong Kong style Cafe in Markham. It is tucked in a little corner In this busy Plaza.

The servers here all speak Cantonese, but some of them do speak Mandarin as well. Although their Mandarin were not perfect, they still try their best to communicate with me. We got the pork and steak with black pepper sauce which is something that I always order at a Hong Kong style Cafe. Our server also recommended this lamb chop dish that was written on the wall. I got that with curry and it was delightful. The Hong kong-style milk tea here are amazing and it's a must-try."}
{"text":"New City is a HK-style breakfast diner.

Beef Brisket Rice Noodle Soup
- ...they used pad thai, thin rice noodles that seems to have been quickly blanched and served...noodles were bland
- beef brisket was okay
- ...lettuce was served as vegetables...but was still dirty?!?

HK Style Milk Tea was decent.

Service was poor. Waitress had a poor attitude and was borderline rude.."}
{"text":"If you are looking for cheap, quick and tasty HK cafe style dishes, then New City Restaurant is definitely a place to check out. Although their service may not be to your typical western restaurant standards, they do their job effectively and with a high precision of getting your order right the first time. It is no wonder that New City has been around for so many years given the consistency of their food as well as overall taste. Definitely come by if you are in the Markham location; you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Another HK style chinese cafe. Service here is prompt and efficient. They have breakfast, lunch, afternoon tea, and dinner deals. I usually order the portuguese chicken dish and my friends would order the meat platter with grilled steak, chicken and pork chop over fries. That grilled dish is one of their signature dish. 
This time we also ordered the salted chicken dish, but it tasted more like a steamed chicken  dish. I like the efficient service and the milk tea here, but I am not a fan of the menu options."}
{"text":"Best service & really good HK style food. Their HK milk tea is really good. The food comes really fast and the workers are always nice !!"}
{"text":"Everything is pretty delicious, whenever I come here I end up being soooo full because their portion sizes are so generous. 

The curry dishes and the noodles are pretty good. I haven't really tried anything else but the people I come with always like their meal too :)

I give 4 stars and not 5 because the food is delicious but when I finish im always too full and don't feel so well cus I'm stuffed. LOL"}
{"text":"Yummy! Love coming here for HK safe style food. Usually a tad bit busy every time we come (fully packed). If I want to eat somewhere a little more quiet and have more \"space\" and privacy, I would go somewhere else. The waitresses are nice and friendly! :)"}
{"text":"Markham is basically Asian food paradise. To rank as one of the best HK cafes here is not an easy task, but New City takes the reigns on this one. Seriously this place is one of the best and well maintained cafe in Markham. You also know that they truly care about their customers and has an owner that manages well. The staff has been unchanged since I've lived here. Food here is good regardless of what you order so just go on and make this place your local diner. Because I did and I have not regretted it. Despite the change of scenery in the New Kennedy Plaza, this place remains unchanged and for a good reason!"}
{"text":"Delicious, no frills food. Service was quick and friendly, everything tasted got and fresh and the value is amazing. For around $25 two of us got soup, a main dish, drinks, and dessert and everything was pretty good. The place is not the nicest but it's clean and the servers were prompt and for the most part running around, working hard to clear dishes and bring you your food as soon as it's ready. Will definitely return with my family."}
{"text":"I have been a big fan since I came to Canada - I was pretty young. Their iced lemon tea and iced milk tea is to die for
 Honestly can't find another place that has great service and great food for its price.

I always get the omelette with ham in the morning with vermicelli with pork. During tea time, I get the steak and fries. Their steak is made exactly medium rare. My fave!

I can't rave about this place enough but its not really your traditional HK style restaurant. Try it and you'll love."}
{"text":"Food will get to your table quickly, but service is not the best here, especially if the owner is not around.

If youre getting their sizzling plates, get it with rice or noodles because you'll get the fries and veggies anyways.  If you order only with veggies and fries.. you get the same amount as you would if you got rice too.
So its just a bonus."}
{"text":"[LOCATION] - 4/5
Located at New Kennedy Square. Look out for a white sign with blue font. There are usually lots of parking spots outside the plaza. 

[SERVICE] - 4/5
Staff were friendly & efficient. This place offered a soup of the day with their meals, which was a nice touch because the wait-time for my order did not feel too long. 

[DÉCOR] - 3/5
Typical Hong Kong-style cafe vibes. There was nothing too special about the décor. 

[FOOD QUALITY] - 4/5
Moderate-to-high quality for a Hong Kong style cafe. Great for a hearty meal. 

[ORDER] - 4/5
Baked Chicken Breast with Tomato Sauce on Spaghetti - $9.99: came with Coffee, Tea, Soya Drink, or Soft Drink. Chicken breast was average. Not too dry, but also not too moist. Spaghetti was perfectly cooked, and I loved how the top of the sauce turned a little crisp from the baking process. 

[OVERALL] - 4/5
I would recommend this location because the food quality is relatively high for Hong Kong Style food, and the prices are fair. Next time, I would definitely try a Special Baked Rice/Spaghetti with cheese because I feel like my order lacked that cheesy component. But for those who are lactose intolerant, baked dishes without cheese are also wonderful and satiating!"}
{"text":"This place has been here since I can remember when my family immigrated here from Hong Kong. This place was the most legit Hong Kong style cafe back in the day when Markham barely had any Chinese people.

With that being said, look, they are still here and still LEGIT. Many Hong Kong-ers still come here daily. They had some rough times when their chef left but they have definitely bounced back from a slight slip and serve the same fast decent cafe food.

Definitely would not say it is anything fancy but we still consider them authentic and decently priced. There is usually a line so the line should speak for itself.

From Breakfast, to afternoon tea to dinner. Their food is consistent and price is right. They are definitely worth a 5 star even with the different selections around.

- Service is quick (They are always running around and in a hurry like HK cafes)
- Food is consistent (20+ years)
- Price is reasonable (Dishes bigger than other HK cafes)

Standard Dishes at HK cafe's (Those whom are not familiar)
- Baked Porkchop Rice or Spaghetti (Cream or Tomato sauce)
- Baked Portuguese Chicken Rice or Spaghetti
- Mixed Meat on Sizzling Plate (Huge Portion)
- HK Style French Toast
- Lots of set Breakfast Combos
Plus many more...."}
{"text":"Try to come here once a week. I think its the best hk style cafe in Toronto. Food comes out very quick. Their satay beef soup noodle is so good. Wait time during weekend mornings can be busy. Parking lot is big and no issue."}
{"text":"Since it's been a year, I thought I'd update my review.

New City Restaurant has been around for ages and still continues to be one of the main HK cafes in Markham area.  They've renovated within the last year and gives a more sophisticated cafe vibe now (as opposed to a somewhat dim and grimy interior from before). 

There is still limited seating space in the restaurant but the turnover rate is fairly quick.  

I came in today to eat lunch with one of my friends and the tables were all half-filled around 2PM.  
There's a lot of good deals for whatever time you decide to pop in.  For example, for breakfast there's your vermicelli, porridge, toast, eggs etc.  For lunch - dinner there's rice, baked dishes, or noodles combo that includes a drink.  I'd say most of their dishes are reasonable in terms of quality and comparison for price.  
The steak and rice combo was $9.99 with a drink (I got the milk tea).  The steak was decent but I didn't enjoy the sauce it came with, it was just a little too bland. 
The baked combos (especially chicken and ham) are superb. 
I also come for the sizzling platter which I can get for lunch, eat for dinner, and then have a small breakfast from it the next morning. 

The waitresses aren't there to be friendly but they are efficient.  When you start coming more often they'll recognize you by name but until then you're \"handsome\" or \"pretty girl\", which I think is pretty cute.
Getting their attention can be tricky because they're so efficient at taking orders and clearing up they do forget to look up sometimes and see who needs extra service.

If you're craving HK style food, this is the place to go.

Once again, treat the parking as a hostile environment and watch out for your car.  

Also, if it gets busy and you sit by the window, there is a 78% chance another family is watching you eat it from the other side of the glass as they wait for their table."}
{"text":"Inexpensive place for nice home style HK food. You can easily get full here with less than $10 in your pocket.

They offer a variety of combos with their food, which usually includes a drink and soup. Drink variety is tea, milk tea, or soy milk. Soup is either their \"borscht\" soup or cream soup. 

I ordered the special noodle soup that isn't on their main menu. It included fish cake, Chinese sausage, fish balls, and beef brisket. The noodle I got was instant noodles. 

This dish was okay; you can definitely tell that the soup was instant as it had no real depth of flavour. Tastes more like salted water. Was $8.99, so not a bad deal.

Bf ordered the baked rice with seafood. This is his typical order, and for $11.99, it is incredible value. Comes with a drink and soup, as mentioned above.

They don't skimp on the seafood or the cheese sauce and the rice is nicely fried with onions and mushrooms. If I was to come back again, it will definitely be for their baked rice dishes.

Friends found it pretty decent as well and were satisfied with the price for what they ordered.

It's cash only though, so be wary of that!"}
{"text":"Been here on multiple occasions. In my most recent visit i ordered curry beef brisket with rice. had the russian borscht soup and a  cold milk tea.
soup was good. pretty light but strong in flavour.
curry beef brisket was good in regards to portions. it was just enough and i didn't have to stuff myself to finish my meal. the curry was not spicy at all though. i'm not very good with spicy but there could have been a slight kick to it.
milk tea was good as well, but too much ice. anyone that knows me, knows i want more drink in my drink than ice.

in addition, i can't vouch for this as i have not tried it, but my friends complain that the cold lemon tea is never sweet enough."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of HK style cafes and this one has been around for a long time - there's good reason for it!

Servers were friendly and efficient and it's comfort food - CHEAP comfort food. I have to say that most of the menus are under $10, which is amazing! I went in around tea time so I can only comment on what was offered. Actually, I didn't even have the tea time specials - I had the all day breakfast, haha. I had the following meal:

1. Preserved Cabbage and Minced Pork over noodle in soup + Ham & Cheese sandwich with soya milk ($7.00): I was pleasantly surprised with the preserved cabbage. I was expecting it to be a blast of sour as soon as I ate it but it was pretty mild (likely diluted from the soup?) and added the perfect flavour to the noodle in soup. The ham and cheese is the same anywhere but can I just note that they include perfect amounts of butter? They don't slab it on as if it's mayo - it's spread so it doesn't overpower anything else. The soya milk was soya milk.

The server took my order pretty quickly and the food came out within 5 minutes - super fast! When I was sat down, she got my a glass of water right away too. She was also attentive enough to fill my water when needed. The only thing I didn't appreciate was that after the renovations were done, the lights are just SO bright. It bugs me, but not enough for it to warrant a star deduction. Come enjoy the food and service!"}
{"text":"This place is what it is, and it does what it does, well. Your standard Chinese cafe, with your standard dishes and drinks. The baked rice dishes here are done well, and as expected, everything was affordably priced. The food as well as the drinks came quickly too. The meals came with complimentary soup (Borscht or cream of broccoli), and a drink (I went with a cold HK style tea). Not much else to say really...if you're looking for affordable, filling, and quick Chinese cafe food in the Markham area, this place is it."}
{"text":"Located in a plaza in the southwest corner of Kennedy and Hwy 7, there is a huge population of Chinese and the entire plaza is always packed. New City Restaurant is no different. I've actually been coming here for years (well before I began Yelping) and is a reliable place for me when it comes to Cantonese comfort foods. So I thought that it's time to help put this place on the map.

New City is relatively a small restaurant (typical of plaza/strip mall businesses), the tables are separated by only enough space to place a seat. Carefully carved out aisles are strategically created so that servers can reach your table and serve your food, but no thoroughfares exist. In short, no one maximizes patron space (while still adhering to Fire Codes and evacuation safety standards) better than the Chinese! Booths line the perimeter of the establishment with tables in the centre. Typical of Chinese restaurants, they have tables that are small and round (normal seating for four in most North American restaurants) in which they will have no qualms with seating a party of 6-7. Servers are always on the move, and all of them cover the entire dining area (tips are shared among all servers on shift). You need to make the effort to flag one down when you need them... it's a cultural thing, you'll get used to it.

The entire menu is listed on four laminated cards. Most dishes are less than $10, and the portions may appear small, but they're more filling than they look. We ended up deciding on the following:

Special Baked Meals (Light Yellow Card)
D. Baked Portuguese Chicken (rice)
M. Baked Seafood with Cheese (spaghetti)

Chef's Recommendations (Blue Card)
3. Curry Beef Brisket on Rice.

Chinese-French Toast (not on menu). Taiwanese style toast (thicker than Texas Toast) with peanut butter in between, and a generous square of butter on top. Served so that the butter melts before your eyes... This will probably be the most expensive sandwich you've ever ordered in your lifetime, but it's worth it! Salty, sweet, crispy, and soft all at once, your taste buds will be firing on all cylinders and provide an explosion of flavours in your mouth. 4 stars (the dish could have had a little more peanut butter on it). 

Portuguese Chicken. Not a Portuguese dish, rather a Cantonese one popular in the Macau area of China where many Portuguese have immigrated to (yes, there's a population of Portuguese in China, and they speak the Cantonese, Mandarin, and Portuguese fluently!) This is my favourite among all the baked dishes. I always get it with the rice, and have never once been disappointed. Chicken and potato a rich creamy sauce covers a bed of rice and is baked. Flavours of cumin and tumeric are evident and not overpowering. At New City, their rendition includes onions and bell peppers, which gives additional elements of flavour, texture, and colour. 5 stars.

Baked Seafood with Cheese. The seafood assortment consisted of fake crab meat, squid, and shrimps. The cream sauce was white and creamy with flavours of chicken and mushroom. The spaghetti was cooked beyond al denté, which is typical of the dish. I did not partake, but the rest of my family likes the dish and their ratings rounded out at 3,5 stars.

Curry Beef Brisket on Rice. The curry came it's own bowl and rice separately on the plate. The brisket was tender and the curry leaning towards brown, which is odd for a curry, but it was still decently flavoured. Since everyone has a different tolerance for heat, it's difficult to reveal how spicy it truly is. In attempt to compare it to something more common, say a bag of \"Flammin' Hot\" Cheeto's (despite the flavour being nothing alike), the Cheeto's pack more heat. I still rather enjoyed the dish. 3,5 stars.

The meals came with a drink (that's right, for less than $10, you get a meal and a drink!). You get a choice of soda pop, coffee, tea, or soy milk. We went for YinYang (Cantonese: YuenYeung, Mandarin: YuanYang), a metaphor for Coffee Milk Tea (coffee being dark, milk tea being light - the Yin Yang is the harmonious balance of light and dark). Despite the beautiful metaphor, light prevails over darkness here, the drink is really 3 parts coffee, 7 parts milk tea. This is not on the menu (just ask for it). On par with other places that serve it. 3 stars.

These types of establishments with the high noise level and cramp space, is not designed for comfort and a pleasant dining experience. They're designed for the hungry traveler, looking to satisfy their belly with minimal damage to their wallet and be on their way. These places are revenue generating machines, and people like me are not deterred, rather we're eager to help support the restaurant's quest for high turnover rates. Their Hong Kong style dishes are delicious and consistent, which makes the addiction even stronger, and the fix is never disappointing. 4 stars.

{"text":"We eat at New City or Blue Ocean almost every weekend as long as we arrive at the restaurant before 10:30am due to difficulty finding parking spots after this time.  Sundays are heavier traffic in the plaza where New City is located and it might be because Churchgoers are coming in pre- or post- service.  

For an HK style restaurant, this place has cheap yet filling and tasty breakfast options, and their evening menu of baked rice dinners are consistently  flavourful. 

The breakfast options we've tried and find nothing amiss are eggs and bacon, satay beef spaghetti and sandwich, French toast, congee & sweet cruller, and beef brisket noodles.  Their HK tea cups could be slightly bigger (maybe half an inch taller?), but otherwise, no complaints.

Like most small HK style restaurants, it would be easier and faster to get a table for two or else you'll have to wait about 10 minutes. And their service is always polite, quick, considerate (they ask if we want an English menu or if they may clear our table of empty dishes) and is never rude. We are the type of diners that don't make idle chitchat with the waitstaff, yet they still recognize us when we come in as if we have a routine now (they swap in English menus, they suggest the same booth if possible).  Since the meals we eat here are often billed around 11-12 dollars, we usually tip $1.75-$2.00."}
{"text":"Ohmygosh, I love this place soooooo much 
Despite the busy hours and the small areas, the food is amazing. I got the Chicken Brest and hallelujah, it was so amazing 
When you get there, you might need to wait a while though... it's worth it.
If it wasn't for my friend, I would have never come to check this place out! I'm looking forward to coming here again"}
{"text":"I have been coming to New City Restaurant for years. 

It did have some renovations and face lift so the decor looks fairly modern.

Food is always decent and you know what you can expect and the prices are reasonable.

The menus are solely in Chinese... I don't really know if they have a separate English menu. I guess you can just point to one of the many selections and just try your luck!!

High recommend to come for Afternoon Tea Specials as I think it has the best selections compare to their lunch and dinner specials.

Cash Only!"}
{"text":"Literally grew up here. The waitress know everyone by name, and the food is always great. My go-tos include steak with garlic sauce on rice for lunch, or their honey garlic chicken wings for afternoon tea. 
Trust me, there's no place that makes better Honey Garlic Chicken Wings."}
{"text":"Typical, solid and efficient HK Cafe style restaurant with prompt and friendly service. Food is good, especially breakfast. My go-to spot, because it's across the street. Go there enough and they'll recognize you by name. The milk tea is legit."}
{"text":"Not bad, not great. Normal value for HK style cafe; food was on the less than average taste."}
{"text":"Service:
The service is always on point. It's like a well oiled machine. High speed and efficiency! 

Ambiance:
Your locate neighbourhood HK cafe. Seating is usually tight, and expect a long lineup during peak hours like lunch and weekends. They recently got a makeover, so it now looks more modern and clean. 

Food:
This is one of my favourite spot to grab a quick bite. The food quality is always consistent, and the price is right. I never leave this place hungry. Most of the menu items are your typical HK dishes."}
{"text":"The food is seasoned and there are many choices of protein cooked in various ways that can be accompanied by rice, fried rice, noodles, or spaghetti!

If you like Chinese adaptions on western-style foods, I would definitely recommend! Come at lunch though because that's when the lunch specials are very friendly for your wallet! 

I got the baked teriyaki chicken, and others with me ordered baked chicken breast with tomato sauce on rice, the pork cutlet/ fish filet duo on rice, and the picked vegetable noodle soup! All choices were very good but lacked vegetables. We ordered an additional place of steamed cabbages that tasted absolutely AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Very personalized service, the waiters know your name after a few times. Best HK style breakfast cafe."}
{"text":"This was a terrible place even though this was a Hong Kong style cafe which had great food at low prices. Though the great food was a big disappointment! Everything was overly salty and not worth the time or effort to go there. I would definitely skip this place and go to the mall which has a food court or the restaurant on the right, blue ocean"}
{"text":"Tasty BBQ Seafood in North York used to be my go-to for hk cafe style food.. I started going to this place a few months ago and every dish has been amazing in terms of value and taste. The chicken wings are massive, crispy and fresh. The honey garlic flavour one actually uses real honey lol, I was surprised. The basked dishes were great, tried to baked porkhop in cream sauce and cheese w seafood (only 9 bucks) spaghetti w meatsauce.. steak and fries, beef tongue w rice.. all under 10 bucks with amazing portions and taste. Just look at all the photos.. xD"}
