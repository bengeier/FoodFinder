{"text":"This well-established restaurant offers genuine (not Americanized) Italian cuisine. At a recent lunch, I had a delicious tagliatelle dish as my main course. The pasta, a pleasant deep yellow in colour, was silky and quite clearly not machine-made; the sauce, which included small pieces of salami, was flavourful. The wine list is extensive, with a half dozen reds as well as whites available by the glass. The service is very good, even when the restaurant is full -- as it often seems to be at lunch on weekdays."}
{"text":"A very disappointing dining experience. 
Here's why:
Our table waited 35+ minutes for our entrees which, when they finally arrived, one was served cold. 
When we asked to have it reheated, we were given these excuses:
1. \"The entree was prepared to be served lukewarm.\" (Sorry, it was cold.) 
2. \"Folks in Montreal think nothing of waiting 35-40 minutes for their entree.\" (Really?)
3. No apology was ever offered. 
Seriously, don't waste your time here. (We're in the food business and can tell you that while there are many great restaurants in Montreal, Graziella is not one of them!)"}
{"text":"The food is fantastic.  The burrata appetizer is a must get. It is simply divine. I also highly recommend the gnocchi. The atmosphere is lovely. I knocked one star off for service because while attentive, it was incredibly slow. That said, I would definitely return for the quality of the meal."}
{"text":"Graziella had excellent food and wine as well as a friendly and accommodating wait staff.  The burrata with mushrooms, eggplant, and tomato is a delicious appetizer.  Both the gnocchi and the strozzapreti pasta with rabbit were fresh and light.  Our waiter also recommended some sensational wines by the glass.  We didn't explore the whole menu but certainly would like to come back the next time we are in Montreal."}
{"text":"Food was spectacular, service was unparalleled, in fact the Maitre'D Stephano just saved a patrons life with the Heimlick Maneuver.. Wow.... Very emotional."}
{"text":"My husband and I celebrated New Year's Eve here a few years ago and when we planned to be in Montreal for New Year's again, it was a no brainer to come back! We only had fond memories, but after this last experience I do not think we'll return. We had 9:15 reservations and we didn't leave the restaurant until close to 12:30. The meal included a 6 course tasting menu and wine pairing. The food was delicious, but there was also a 30 min gap between each course. For one course, our waiter completely forgot to pour our wine and didn't notice until we brought it to his attention. Also, he never explained the wine we were drinking, not even the name or the varietal. My husband and I were served different glasses, but we never knew exactly what they were. Definitely would not recommend coming here if you have time restraints and service was not stellar."}
{"text":"Really special menu. They don't have boring regular stiff, but an exciting variety of MEAT. 
I took an \"Veau du Quebec.\" Super tender and tasty .
Ambiance was nice for a cocktail, speech , after conference dinner. 
I would go again to try the bird haha"}
{"text":"I did not know what to expect given the bad reviews but still decided to give it a try. I was not disappointed!!
We started with a fresh buratta from puglia- it's the ultimate mozzarella experience, similar to what we tasted in Italy: soft, light and buttery. Definitely NOT the chewy plastic like mozzarella you find in Canada (I wonder why they even dare calling it mozzarella...)
The main dishes we had were outstanding. Try the gnocchi- they are like little pillows of heaven! 
My better half had the Osso bucco alla Milanese and it was cooked to perfection falling off the bone like it should...
They have a nice selection of wine and the  organic malvasia dolce frizzante (like a sweet proseco) was really tasty and without sulfites.
Don't miss the dessert...we had a mascarpone cheese cake (I think it was called crostata) and it was delicious. 
Cosy, quiet and intimate atmosphere. Good service. 
That's all you need to know!"}
{"text":"Graziella is a fine restaurant, the food and service are always excellent and the decor is very nice. They also have private rooms available for business meetings or private parties. If there was one negative about this resto it is that it lacks excitement, nothing on the edge. The decor and service are very classy and the food is excellent, but they don't take any risks or push the envelope, something that we are use to seeing at some of the best restaurants in Montreal. Of course this can sometimes backfire, there is no risk of this happening at Graziella so I think that you are unlikely to leave Graziella being hugely disappointed. Amoung the top restaurants in Montreal Graziella is a safe bet."}
{"text":"Uptight and unwelcoming....they take themselves way too seriously. We should have taken a hint when we saw that the place was DEAD on a Saturday night. The food is boring and run of the mill, for the price of a top notch dish. The service was appalling.

When you walk in, you are greeted by a self righteous middle aged server who will be appalled that you don't order wine, he will be equally appalled that you don't eat meat. You will open the menu and see rabbit leg dishes and duck dishes for hilarious prices. We wanted to get up and leave after reading the menu but we were so hungry that we just decided to eat quickly and leave. 

The only vegetarian dish was the gnocci with tomato sauce - which is what I was forced to order because there was no other option. My partner got the same thing.

When our food arrived we were almost ready to pass out from hunger, and when you're hungry everything tastes good right? Wrong. The dish tasted like someone opened a can of tomato paste, added some milk, and called it a day.

Our bill came to $65 for 2 gnocci dishes (no drinks, nothing). It would have been worth the price if the food was good. It was far from. 

I would like to give this place a half star."}
{"text":"We had lunch here and the food was very tasty: warm carpaccio followed by gnocchi, finishing with a very interesting porcini semifreddo.  The things that really impressed me though were the staff and the espresso.  It's not often that I have an espresso so memorable.  It was nutty and chocolatey and wonderful.  I forgot to ask what beans they use.

We had an event in their very cool space upstairs and the staff were so helpful and friendly.  They passed around appetizers and even had a second person following with a plate to take the used skewers and spoons.  That's the first time I've seen that!!  It was nice for guests not to stand there wondering where to put this stuff.

Grazie Graziella!"}
{"text":"Tres bon restaurant, ambiance chic mais décontractée malgré tout. Les plats proposés sont italiens classique et élaborés, pas les pizzas et pasta habituels. Les assiettes bien présentées et le service impeccable.
Nous y sommes allées entre copine, très tard le soir. Je ne recommande pas ce lieu avec des enfants.
Les portions ne sont pas énormes mais la qualité des mets était au rendez-vous.
Une tres belle soirée."}
{"text":"3.5 star food, 5 star service

We had dinner here on a Saturday.  The place was busy, but our hotel concierge was able to score a last-minute reservation for us.  

The food was well prepared and beautifully presented.  Our group had as appetizers rabbit and spinach terrine (excellent!), seared scallop (good, but not \"wow\"), and foie gras terrine (I didn't hear people complaining about it).  Main courses included Ossobuco (tender and flavourful), fish of day which was a snapper fillet (it was just so-so, there is not much flavour or seasoning to it), sweetbread and guinea fowl filled Quail and a veal fillet dish which I didn't get to taste.  Desserts were \"average\", I wasn't blown away by my polenta cake or the ice cream and sorbet sampling.  

The best part of our dining experience is service.  Our waiter was exceptionally knowledgeable and willing to help.  When one of the guests couldn't find a particular Napa wine on the list, the waiter suggested a little-known Lebanese brand and vintage to try, which made our friend into a very happy customer.

I'd be happy to return if in the area again."}
{"text":"I was in Montreal for one night with my two kids (10 and 12) and we ate here for dinner. It's upscale yet comfortable and not too formal. The tables around us were couples on dates but children are also more than welcome. When we sat down the waiter asked the kids if they would like a special surprise mocktail, which they did, so he brought them each a different mystery drink. Later he came back to see how they liked them and to tell them what was in them.
 For an appetizer we shared the stuffed zucchini blossoms which was the highlight of the meal. It sort of tasted like a deep fried artichoke heart stuffed with creamy ricotta. It was served with a cherry tomato salad. Truly delicious.
For the main course, my son and I had the special fish which was a filet of sea bass. It was good. My daughter had ricotta gnocchi. We each finished our plates and enjoyed them.
For dessert we shared the cannoli. They were less sweet than what we're used to but they tasted very fresh.
It was a memorable meal in a beautiful city."}
{"text":"We walked in looking like two Abominable Snowmen, covered in the unrelenting snowfall. I was soaked and melting in the warmth of the restaurant as we reviewed the menu. The space is cozily lit, the white walls highlighting the height of the space. I loved the substantial light fixtures and airiness of the restaurant. Despite the snowfall, the restaurant filled up so that the only space left was at the bar.

To start, we selected something more delicate to complement the heavier entrées we ordered, the seared Maine scallops topped with roe fit the bill. A chickpea purée accompanied the sweet scallops. Also, we enjoyed the diverse bread basket - I loved the fennel-flavored breadsticks but was, for once, concerned about filling up. Confession, I had many breadsticks prior to making that good decision.

I was torn between the duck confit ravioli, osso buco, or fish. In the end, the thought of having both the osso buco and the risotto on the same plate tipped the scale for me. Prepared Milanese style, in white wine and broth and topped with gremolata, the tender meat was delicious. The risotto was well prepared.

The entrée course was quite large but I definitely saved room for dessert. The special that evening was a lemon tartlet on a shortbread crust. The tart lemon curd contrasted nicely with the white chocolate ice cream quenelle, the pomegranate seeds scattered over the plate, and the torched meringue. It was very nicely done.

Service was exceptional. The staff made us feel very comfortable, especially given that we were half frozen when we walked in. Our table by the window allowed us to enjoy the quiet street scene and wave to pedestrians on the other side of the glass."}
{"text":"Hands down the best dining experience of my life. The servers are INCREDIBLY trained! Their food and wine expertise was like nothing I've even encountered. Our server treated us like nothing short of royalty. I started with the fish stuffed calamari which, as both a seafood lover and someone who grew up on the ocean, can only be compared to the fresh from the sea cuisine I grew up with. It was the best calamari I have ever eaten. Ever. My boyfriend had the burrata cheese antipasto which was just as amazing. The fresh, creamy cheese was comparable to nothing I've ever eaten. We shared piglet stuffed ravioli at the recommendation of our amazing server which made our taste buds explode. I had the lamb shoulder for my main with my boyfriend having the braised veal shank. Both outstanding dishes! We finished with the blueberry cheesecake and ricotta cheesecake paired with 2 delicious dessert wines. What an epic dining experience! EPIC. Perfection from start to finish. I'll be referring to myself as Lady Tanya from now on...who knew I was royalty!"}
{"text":"Went there on vacation. Came highly recommended by a friend who travels to Montreal often. Did not dissapoint. Northern cuisine at its best. Service was good, wait staff friendly and attentive atmosphere very nice and food was delicious. A must stop when in Montreal."}
{"text":"Lovely Italian restaurant. Went here for a business dinner and everyone was very satisfied. 

To start, I had a local craft beer pale ale. I think it was St Ambroise but not 100% sure. It hit the spot on a warm evening. 

The burata appetizer is an absolute must try but would definitely not try to eat it yourself. It's perfect for a group of four (or five as the case was). 

For main course, I shared the risotto for two with one of our business partners. It was the perfect size and the flavor of the lobster was lingering on my tongue for the rest of the evening. My boss had the ossobucco and he couldn't finish. Had to help him out. 

Finished off the evening with a sea salt caramel chocolate tart. Mon Dieu."}
{"text":"Je vais faire court.... C'est cher! Mais mon dieu que c'est bon. 3 fois là bas et toujours un plaisir et du raffinement.
Pour moi, le meilleur Resto italien chic de Montréal.
N'oubliez pas de demander les fromages..... Peccorino , gorgonzola etc...Un régal."}
{"text":"I was ecstatic to finally try this Italian restaurant located in Old Montreal; it has been around for almost a decade now, and you can certainly see why. The space is fancy, the chef is renowned, and the food is stupendously good!

The space itself is divided into two dining rooms, which adds intimacy to your dining experience, and there are also a few seats in front of the open kitchen where you can see the chefs at work and drool in anticipation. The high ceilings, the white-clothed tables, and well-dressed patrons add to the elegance of the venue.  

The dishes on the menu are typically Italian with regional specialties. I ordered the scallop entrée and of course, the osso buco for which Chef Graziella Battista is known for. The food was incredibly delicious, well presented, and simply fabulous; everything is made with fresh quality ingredients and you can simply taste the difference. The osso buco is by far the best I've had to date and the one to beat in all of Montreal; there is no denying that she is the queen when it comes to this dish! Our meal finished with some dessert although a cheese board was also presented as an option. I tried the chocolate tart topped with mango; although nothing Italian about mango, the dessert was perfectly balanced between the sweet mango puree and slightly bitter chocolate of the tart.  As for the wine, the list was long, and as one who is not familiar with Italian wine, the waiter was more than helpful in choosing a perfect pairing.

The service was good for our large group of 10 and although some dishes arrived separately from the rest of the group, the friendly and courteous waiter more than made up for any hiccup.

I am sure to return to this restaurant seeing that the menu changes to offer seasonal favourites, and with so many dishes to try, how could I ever resist?"}
{"text":"Hummm
Great Italian food and very fancy. The whole meal was fantastic from start to finish. Even the espresso was very satisfying. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"The service was terrible, we had to ask for a food menu after being seated for awhile. We ordered the risotto, papperdalle, and gnocchi. The risotto was hard and had too much lemon, the pallerdalle was soft and in a soupy sauce that resembled chef boyardee, the gnocchi was hard and tasted very bland."}
{"text":"IF YOU HAVE A PALATE FOR EXCELLENCE Graziella is worth a visit or more.
Our group dined over a work discussion but very soon the ambiance, food and wine turned it into an evening of pleasure and laughter.
As other reviews you will read we had the Burrata to start. All four of us agreed it was the best we had ever had. The grilled calamari was also superb. Delicate and tasty. For the main two of us had the risotto del giorno. Tonight it was with braised veal in its juice. I understand why it is a dish made for two. The time and work that goes into risotto (when it's done right) involves so much that it's not worth it for one serving. This dish was perfect. Each bite had small shavings of veal. The plate was perfectly al dente and wonderful. My companions also chose from the homemade pastas: the ravioli and the spaghetti pomodoro. We all loved the food. When I ordered desserts for the table reluctance rose among my companions because we were so full. Needless to say we devoured everything. Raves to the Financiere and cocoa tart.
Service was impeccable. Our waiter was well informed and attentive all through the night. Thank you Alex and Grace! The evening was a 10 on 10 dining experience. My recommendation to anyone who wishes a wonderful evening is to visit the team at Graziella."}
{"text":"Meant to be one of the best in the city. Point blank I think they just like to add too much sugar to most meals. If you have sweet tooth then likely this is your place from the veal, to the salad to the pasta. Sweeeet."}
{"text":"Our last dinner in Montreal before heading back home to Los Angeles. We actually had a total of 10 restaurants during our 11 days stay. Graziella is number 4 in our list. The place is nicely decorated, chairs are comfortable. Service was good except that our waiter is a little on the pushy side. 
Food was good. My husband loved the cheese course. 
Worth trying though."}
{"text":"Very rich food and quite overpriced for what it is. Atmosphere is ok but nothing special"}
{"text":"Nous étions un gros groupe et cela s'est magnifiquement passé! Le rythme du service était excellent, nous avions des retardataires qui ont pris le service en cours de route et les serveurs et la cuisine se sont superbement adaptés. Vraiment à essayer pour une occasion spéciale car c'est un peu dispendieux."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here on valentines.  

We ate downstairs which had a totally different vibe compared to upstairs. It was definitely more quiet downstairs. 

That night everyone had to order from the set menu which was a 3 course meal for $75 which I felt was quite pricy. You could also had the option of getting a small portion of pasta (tortelli and fagottini) for $15-$20 extra which we did not do.

I had the stracciatella first course. Which was basically a watercress salad with cherry tomatoes and soft cheese in the shape of a circle. This was the best thing I ate that night. I highly recommend the stracciatella cheese. I never had it before so I didn't know what to expect. Apparently you can even order a big bowl of it!! I was supposed to share with my boyfriend but it was too good to half half it so I gave him one bite lol 

My boyfriend had the salmon gravlax as a first course. It was ok. I felt it was a bit fishy. 

Next we ordered the herb crusted milk-fed veal fillet and the duck magret. Both were delicious!! The veal was melting in our mouths. It also came with beet and chickpea hummus. The duck magret was fatty and juicy and came with braised fennel. 

For dessert I had the chocolate mousse with sorbet on the side and my boyfriend had the beignet with three different sauces (chocolate, caramel, honey and passion fruit). Out of the two I preferred the chocolate mousse. 

I want to come back and try their regular menu. The food was so delicious but the portions were small. It is definitely pricey but for special occasions it's totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Great place. I loved the service and the interior design. Being Italian and going to an Italian restaurant is rare for me but this was worth it. Don't miss out. Gnocchi weren't the best I had but the antipasto and all the rest were awesome. Good place for a date."}
{"text":"It's always a pleasure to eat at Graziella because I am pretty sure I will enjoy what I am eating every time I go. I have to admit that on a few occasions, it was part of a larger group with fixed special menus, and as such, our meals are different from those on the regular menu, but I was never dissapointed. Recently, I had the chance to return with a friend and we had a lovely meal. I especially like the stuffed fried zucchini appetizer,mainly because their were different flavors that were layered into every bite. My friend's spinach and ricotta gnocchi was also really tasty. I don`t usually like gnocchi, but I would be happy to order the gnocchi if  I were to return next time. I had the guinea fowl, it tasted great, but I didn`t find it too exciting. For desserts, I had a special of the day but regret not choosing the bomba tiramisu. My friend's cannolis were delicious. 

Price wise, before tax and tips we spent about $60-75 per person on a three course meal without wine. There was a lot of food for the main course and I would've been more than happy to skip or even share a dessert at the end.  The service is attentive, the ambiance is on a quieter side and perfect for a  special dinner. There is a private room upstairs that could accommodate probably 50 people and a smaller one downstairs that could seat 10-12 people. 
I would happily return to this restaurant for special occasions."}
{"text":"Très bonne table, cuisine sérieuse mais pas ampoulée, bien vivante, fraîche, vraiment goûteux et digne de la réputation de l'endroit.

Service de premier ordre, généreux, vins intéressants.

Cher, oui, mais on a pas l'impression de se faire avoir.

J'y retourne."}
{"text":"For as long as i can remember Graziella has been on my list .!!!
My foodie group decided to go on the second week of August 2017 ( bad week for me ... birthdays and etc ) but since it has been on my list for so long ... i decided to still go... hey i heard so many good things of their Ossobuco and boy they were not wrong.!!!
That piece of meat i have no idea how it holds together ... or has even put there ( on the dish ) by the chef ... without falling apart
That piece of meat melts on your mouth!!! It comes served on top of a decent Risotto ... which is great cause it doesn't steal the show to the meat
I also had some stuffed Zucchini flowers... and they were delicious .!!!
The service was great .. the food was awesome ... the place is beautiful 
I totally recommend this place .!!! 
And i will definitely go back"}
