{"text":"We had dinner this evening in the loft and everything was absolutely fabulous.  I had the NY strip steak with fried Brie and it was to die for."}
{"text":"My all time favorite restaurant hands down!

Sure I'm little biased as I grew up down the street, worked there as a teenager and my brother and sister in law worked there for many years as well. But I can tell you one thing, to get a steak of their quality in the USA, you have to go to Morton's or Ruth's Chris and pay top dollar. Mon Village offers top quality steaks for a reasonable price. 

I have had pretty much everything on the menu over the years and it's very rare that I've been disappointed. My suggestion would be to try the cheese garlic bread, it's an absolute must have. For an appetizer, my favorite is probably the Escargot. However if you can't bring yourself to eat snails, I suggest the Caesar salad.

For an entree if you want a steak, you can't go wrong with the Rib Steak. I do love their Prime Rib as well, served with Yorkshire Pudding and a wonderful Au Jus. If you're looking for lighter fare, the Reuben is delicious as are their Pasta Selections, where you choose the type of pasta, the sauce and whether you'd like it with chicken, seafood or alone.

Desserts are quite good at Mon Village as well and they have a decent variety.

The real charm of this restaurant though is in the waitstaff and ambiance. The moment you step out of your car, you can smell the wonderful aroma of garlic and that's when you start salivating! Whether you choose to sit in the Pub or Dining Room, you will be treated to incredible service and very country, homey decor and ambiance. Both sides have nice fireplaces that are roaring in the winter and provide coziness that make you feel like you're in your own home!

Bill and his excellent staff always go the extra mile to make sure that you feel welcome and want to come back again and again. If you ever find yourself in Hudson/St. Lazare area do yourself a favor and stop into this wonderful gem. I promise you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Bonne bouffe, bière froide et excellent service, que demande de plus?! J'y reviens depuis plus de 15 ans!"}
{"text":"I've been to Sunday brunch at Mon Village many times and it's always been a great experience. We've frequently booked a room for the extended family between 10 - 15 people of all ages and everyone leaves happy. I like that the food stations are spread out around the place so people are not all bunched up in one place. Great food, great ambiance a family favorite."}
{"text":"Ahh, Mon Village ... my favourite local restaurant/pub!  

Overall the food is very good --  not exactly the most exotic cuisine, but what they do serve is excellent.  The fish & chips are great, the roast beef dip is super, and the french onion soup with garlic bread is some of the best pub food you'll find anywhere!

The real attraction with Mon Village is the ambiance.  The rural setting is relaxing, the decor is fittingly rustic with an amazing wood fireplace (ideal for the winter months), and the outdoor terrace is perfect for summer afternoons.  

A few times when we've sat outside earlier this year we had to retreat back inside due to a few pesky wasps (I'm allergic) -- not the restaurant's fault obviously, but a warning to bring your epipen (epinephrine autoinjector), just in case!"}
{"text":"Not a good place to go if you're not a beef eater 

Only had a handful of chicken dishes 

Picked the chicken teriyaki
The chicken was cooked perfectly ;however, the side of vegetables was 1 piece of broccoli and 1 carrot that was cut into multiple pieces. This  bummed me out since most sides of vegetables are a lot more than 2 vegetables"}
{"text":"Mediocre food at above average prices. Cool spot with crappy service. I don't know what else to say, I really want to like this place but it just kind of sucks. Especially in a province known for it's amazing food!"}
{"text":"One of the best dinners I've had. The Cote de Queen fillet was terrific. The service was top notch. I can understand why it is a local favorite. Well worth the visit."}
{"text":"Historic pub/tavern; large fireplace; old pioneer home; good food (fettuccine Gorgonzola with chicken, lamb, prime rib, Coquille Saint Jacques, onion soup, garlic bread), British and Canadian beer, but can be hard to get in without a reservation."}
{"text":"Bom serviço, mas o ambiente é muito barulhento, aa mesas são muito próximas uma das outras."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times before and the only complain we could find was the longer than usual wait time after ordering. That's ok, it's really not something to complain about given the fact that we always received very good quality/service every time we've been there..... until today. 
 We decided to go to this place for Easter. Let's start with the reservation experience. I called them a week before Easter to reserve and the girl on the phone tells me \"sorry sir, we are booked solid for Easter\". I ask again, are you sure? Really no spot at all anytime that day? The answer is still yes, no chance. Ok, I call my cousin and tell him listen, we gotta look for somewhere else. He says hang on, I'll call them myself and confirm because I know how incompetent the personnel are over there. He calls and whoop, they magically have a place at 7pm for our group of 23 and only 10 minutes after my initial call. Huh!? Wow #1

Service: We arrive at 7 sharp, our place is upstairs in a cramped up room with may be 7' tall ceiling. Kinda stuffy. The waitress: somehow rude  and felt like it's her first week on the job then got even more rude when we said no to alcoholic drinks to start when asked. She made us feel like weirdos for not ordering alcohol. One person in our group says no to alcohol because his wife is pregnant and he won't order a bottle for himself. She says: well, your wife could have a coke. Really? Dang, how come that husband didn't think of that? Wow #2. Anyhow, we order the food but the princess waitress takes off for at least 40 minutes then shows up to take our order after us telling another waiter that she's missing.    Ok, so I timed them this time, exactly an hour wait after placing our orders and we had to run occasionally after the waitress during dinner to ask for water, ketchup, napkins etc. because she wasn't attentive. 

Food: This was the worst and the highlight of the evening. Majority ordered either Coquille mon Village au Gratin or steak. The coquille, we'd ordered several times before and was quite satisfying but today it was overcooked, dry and mainly no hint of white sauce, just some mashed potatoes, 3 shrimps (yes I counted), 2 scallops (actually one cut into two) and the cheese on top very stingy and dry with blah overall taste. It was just a very poorly prepared something compared to the juicy, bursting with flavour creamy tasty dish we've become to know. Garbage for $22/dish! Steak felt like commercial grade quality, chew all you want but won't melt in your mouth, missing flavour and overcooked too and overpriced for nothing. Wow #3

Ok that's it. No more Mon Village for me. Thanks to the staff for turning this place into a dumpster. Adios. Im outa here for good."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere! Very homey. Fish and Chips were great. Fish was extra crispy and the service was friendly."}
{"text":"The verdict after a few visits to the restaurant is that the food is a disappointment and way over priced. The atmosphere of the restaurant is more like a pub and when we have gone for dinner there always seemed to be loud and obnoxious people at the bar who have no consideration of those who are trying to enjoy their meal. The staff don't discourage the boisterous behaviour and seem to encourage and participate in it. 

Other reviewers described the food as bland and I couldn't choose a better word. The Alfredo pasta I recently ordered was way overcooked and the sauce had virtually no flavour. My neighbour at another table ordered the same dish and I noticed they also used half a salt shaker to give the pasta some flavour. 

We went to celebrate a birthday and made arrangenents to have a slice of cake served for the celebration. Thanks to the restaurant for forgetting.  We went to another restaurant afterword for something memorable. 

I might not be so critical if the food was reasonably priced but the prices are completely ridiculous for the quality.  I'm generously giving the restaurant an extra star for the brunch as it's actually slightly better but again way overpriced.  We have no problem shelling out good money for a meal but this place just isn't worth it."}
{"text":"Went for sunday brunch.

The atmosphere in this restaurant is really nice, very country style.

The food at brunch was very average.  I tried the eggs benedict, chicken wings, roast beef, bacon, sausages, and home fries. None of it was bad, but none of it was remarkable.

I would maybe go back to try their food at a different time but would not go back for brunch."}
{"text":"Lovely cozy decor (with real fireplaces!). Went with a group of 7 on a weeknight and service was prompt and courteous. Entrees were good, the escargot was good and the smoked salmon was fresh. The presentation of the smoked salmon could have been better (for example it came with somewhat hard cream cheese you have to dig out of a small metal cup). The garlic bread with cheese was great comfort food and well priced. Portions in general were on the generous side. My pasta (seafood linguine with mascarpone sauce) was missing a slight touch of salt, but was otherwise great. Would recommend if you're looking for a laid back but nice place to go with a group of friends."}
{"text":"Lousy service, locals only. Food was bland and not cooked according to my instructions. I will not be coming back!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the brunch, variety in the options served as a buffet. The dinner is offered as more of a classic steak and potatoes type menu, pretty good as well. Service is excellent!"}
{"text":"Très bon! Un peu cher, mais lorsque j'ai reçu mon assiette, le prix s'est justifié!Une belle grosse assiette et je me suis régalé! De plus le décors est charmant. Beau petit pub à essayer!"}
{"text":"J'ai découvert ce magnifique restaurant en 2011! Un décor enchanteur, service excellent et la nourriture est délicieuse! Je vendrais ma femme pour leurs soupe à l'oignon! Ils ont réussi à me refaire aimer les fish and chips!
Un must!"}
{"text":"Very good rustic restaurant, the french onion soup is the best here and the cheese garlic bread also.  Every type of steak I've had here has been Amazing and perfectly cooked to how you want it. Its my whole families favorite restaurant. When family from out of town come here this is the place they want to go! And with the warm wood fire place you feel right at home."}
{"text":"Situated in Saint-Lazare, right off the highway, this restaurant has a unique design touch. 
At first if you just have a quick glance, it looks like someone's house. Which is true if you start the history of it; it's original built was the homestead of the Thomas Parsons family, in 1829 according to their website. 
But enough of history, more food.
I ordered their \"The Queen of the Cote\" which is their filet mignon topped with peppercorn sauce and comes with a  baked potato and veggies. To be honest, I wasn't amazed by it. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad at all, it was actually good but nothing stood out though.
The meat was grilled to my liking, the sauce was delicious, and the potato was ordinary. Nothing fancy, nothing special; just a simple well cooked steak. That is why I'm giving it an average rating. 

Besides the inside decor was interesting to say the least. If you like rustic design you will love the place. It's charming and it has a country feel to it. 
The food is simple; nothing remarkable but I'm not complaining. The service was good; people were friendly."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and cute place. Food is decent but not excellent and service could be improved. All in all a great place for a family night out if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"I am here a lot. 

I will say that the fans of this place are LOYAL and seating on a weekend is tough for dinner.

Pretty ggood wine selction  and bar..the menuis not very *adventurous* but they know what they do well.

The wings and their roast beef dip are great! eat those...

Service is exceptionally friendly and professional."}
{"text":"Le Fish & Chips est à découvrir. Mais un bon filet mignon vaut le détour. Il est délicieux. L'atmosphère est également très intéressant."}
{"text":"Cute rustic place with very friendly staff and an extensive menu. Great food all around - Best French Onion Soup I have ever had!"}
