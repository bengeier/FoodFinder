{"text":"After working up an appetite walking around the farmers market, Basset Street Brunch Club was the perfect place to grab a bite to eat. Although there was a forty minute wait when we arrived, there were multiple patio seats and tables outside of the restaurant that made waiting quite comfortable. We also made sure to order a few drinks at the bar to sip as we waited. In terms of the menu, there is a wide variety of options, but the fried chicken is a must! The biscuit and gravy that came with the dish were extremely delicious and not too heavy."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed my brunch experience at BSBC. A friend and I went on a game day around 11 am. I expected to have to wait, but was pleasantly surprised that we were seated immediately at the u-shaped bar in the back. Honestly, I think this was a great place to sit on our first visit. It gave us a chance to watch the kitchen, expediters, and other staff, who seemed to congregate back there and see order as they came up. I'm happy to say that this view didn't ruin the experience. The staff was very clean and safe with food handling. Also, everything put in the window looked amazing!  Upon being seated, my friend and I ogled the picturesque doughnuts under the glass domes on the counter. We decided that we would get a few to go. Ended up with the Oreo and the chocolate hazelnut-- both fluffy and dense at the same time and perfectly sweet!  At the restaurant, we enjoyed three split dishes. 1) the egg of the day, which was red pepper, spinach, and goat cheese. Really tasty and hearty, but nothing we couldn't do at home. The potatoes were really good though-- not overly fried or seasoned. 2) Chicken and a Biscuit. A huuuge piece of crispy fried white meat balanced on a flavorful biscuit. Topped with an egg (I asked for mine scrambled, which they were happy to do) with a flavorful sausage gravy and greens on the side. I'm not sure how one could make sausage gravy look appealing, and I've got to be honest, the look turned me off for a minute. Without being too frank, the peach-orange color and chunks of sausage an corn looked a little bit... uh... gross. That being said, once you get past that, it's really delicious! I swear! The greens on the side were a nice way to balance the heavy dish. 3) Chocolate Pancakes. To. Die. For. But they might as well remove the \"pan\" part. Between the chocolate in the batter and the chocolate buttercream on top, it's really a dessert.   In all, it wasn't the healthiest breakfast, but we were there to go big, and we did. Everything was super tasty and our waitress was really nice, gave great recommendations, and was patient with our indecision on what to order.  Also, it's great that they validate parking in the structure! And the place looks nice an stylish."}
{"text":"Had heard a lot about this place, so I decided to try it.  They don't take reservations, which is ridiculous, so even getting there as early as 10AM on a Sunday isn't helpful.  They sat a large table of people who got there after my party of 2 before us.  Our server seemed ditzy and took forever to bring the check even though it was very busy.  The food is overpriced and not close to anything special.  I don't think I'll be returning here anytime soon!"}
{"text":"The food was average, nothing special despite the \"unique\" menu.  I was put off by the lack of normal brunch options.  You can't get regular pancakes.  The French toast has onions and hollandaise sauce on it amongst other weird things.  Everything on the menu has some sort of kale or arugula or something.  It gave the feeling that they were trying too hard to be trendy.  The service was a bit slow despite it being not very busy.  The coffee was good though.  Haven't tried the doughnuts.  All in all I was a bit disappointed."}
{"text":"Location, location, location. This place is a few blocks from one of my favorite nephews home and every time we stay there we stop here. Last visit after losing to Ohio state most of us were a little foggy. First off, don't let the wait scare you...a lot of people just put their name in and then leave. 20 minute wait tops.My handsome nephew had  the \"hang over omelet\" which was very good. My lovely wife had bananas Forster French toast...i am told it was melt in your mouth delicious. I had the eggs Benedict, it was ok. Service was great. This place is known for its donuts. Did not have a donut, next time we will try a few donuts."}
{"text":"Just stopped by here with a friend and we had a great time.  We arrived at around 9am on a Wednesday morning and the place was fairly empty.  We were seated right away and proceeded to order.  I got a latte which was beautiful and delicious.  I also tried the chicken and biscuit which was also delicious.  It came with a rich gravy and the biscuit was the rich buttermilk kind which I really like. It was also kinda neat that it came with a salad, as these rich breakfast plates rarely do.  We stayed for over an hour and a half and felt free to talk and have a good time.  I am excited to return sometime and try some of their other menu items."}
{"text":"Came in for brunch on Friday morning around 11am. Food was phenomenal and the service was extraordinary! If you go, I highly recommend you request Gail and get the Savory French Toast. My problem with the Brunch Club was the fact that I had to listen to the host on the other side of my booth leer and make disgusting comments about women during my entire meal and, as I was leaving the gentleman at the host stand says \"Shhhhhooooott.\" and looked at me in a way that left me feeling very uncomfortable. I am sorry but I can not and will not patronize a restaurant that has me feeling slimy and disgusting after I leave and allows their employees to speak to and about customers that way"}
{"text":"Food (French toast and doughnuts especially), service and atmosphere were all great, definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"Can you say Donuts!? The Brunch Club is one of the best spots in town for breakfast food, and it is served all day. Amazing food and fast service. The staff was also very friendly, I will be back."}
{"text":"We went as a family of  Five to try the Donut's. The wait staff seemed confused when we just wanted a donut but one person wanted to order a meal. After that it went smoothly. We ordered 4 donuts they were OK not too sweet . The kids were disappointed in the flavor of choices, sprinkles, glaze, Oreo, and a bacon. We were there at 930 am . The donuts were dry. They did bring etch a sketch for the kids to play with they were a hit. We will go back to try the main menu."}
{"text":"There used to be a time when one wanted to have breakfast for dinner in downtown, that was not happening. Those were very dark times. But one glorious day, \"Food Fight Group\" opened Basset Street Brunch Club inside the Hampton Inn on the corner of Johnson and Basset.  The menu is filled with a variety of breakfast food, from breakfast burrito to egg benedict to chicken and a biscuit. Most of the entries are prepared with the dinners take on them. And if you are big on  sweet breakfast items, the lemon ricotta pancakes, will blow you out of proportion. The balance of lemon is perfect. Their ricotta cheese is silky and adds moisture to the pancake. The blueberries on top tie the flavors together and create a tasty orchestra in your mouth. Basset Street Brunch club is where you come for the breakfast food and stay for the delicious house made donuts! All I am going to say is: \"Donuts with bacon on top.\" Case closed."}
{"text":"Was very excited to try this place based off the reviews and it was such a let down. The breakfast burrito was bland at best and the black beans werent even cooked.  Everything was lukewarm. The bagel breakfast sandwich was also so hard it was difficult to bite into. The only redeeming factor was the bacon that was brought out at the end (forgotten in the burrito)."}
{"text":"BEST Madison brunch place! GREAT drinks and UNBELIEVABLE food! Bloody Marys are top notch & their Bourbon Buzz is BOMB DIGGITY!  Had their AWESOME Lox Box and their Farmer's Hash! Sometimes a bit of a wait, but outside seating makes it worth it!"}
{"text":"It's an ok place. The food is neither good nor bad. I thought the coffee was kinda sour also. The staff were very friendly though and the atmosphere is nice. I would probably go again for a light brunch"}
{"text":"I went here this past Sunday for a long overdue brunch with my wife. We had heard good things from our friends and had been wanting to give it a try for months. We were definitely not disappointed!  We arrived at around 10 Sunday morning, prepared to wait for about an hour. Brunch spots get pretty packed on weekends and we fully expected a crowd, which there was. Luckily the hostess mentioned there were two seats open at the end of their full service bar, and we were able to skip the wait altogether. The bartenders were clearly very busy but both of the ones helping us were extremely friendly and efficient. We ordered a couple coffees to start (I believe it was Collectivo which my wife loves) and I ordered a grapefruit juice which was clearly freshly squeezed and delicious.   Their menu (even while limited to just the breakfast items) is large and made deciding rather difficult. We asked one of the bartenders what he thought the best items were. He was very honest and explained he was a vegetarian and actually hadn't had most of the breakfast options (which I appreciated because when I ask employees what they like, I'm genuinely interested their in opinions, not just what's popular), but this worked out great since my wife is also vegetarian. He recommended the spring break diet (which my wife ordered) and one of the hashes, and also mentioned that several of the other items on the menu could be modified to be vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, etc. For me he recommended a couple items which he said other staff members were big fans of like the chicken and biscuit and the chilaquiles.   I ordered the chicken and biscuit which came with a delicious gravy. The biscuit was a tad dry, but the gravy and the perfectly fried chicken more than made up for that. My wife loved the spring break diet, although she said it was a bit heavy on the rice and beans. She asked for an extra side of salsa which another bartender happily brought us right away. Problem solved! To close out our meal we split a chocolate hazelnut donut, baked fresh that morning in their kitchen.   For as good as the food was the staff was even better. Maybe I just have bad luck, but a busy brunch shift and great service usually don't go hand in hand for me, and for how chaotic it can get that's understandable. My wife and I really appreciated the time the staff here took to be friendly and answer all of our questions despite their constant running around. I'll definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"It's all in the name. Absolutely fantastic place for brunch! I mean. I literally CREATED a yelp account for this place.  Being from NYC, I've done a lot of boogie brunching, and I've gotta say the Brunch Club is a gem! The place has fresh and funky decor, with staff to match. I highly recommend the frozen screwdriver (literally still dreaming about it almost 2 months later). The food is flavorful, the drinks are stellar; but it's the service that takes the cake. They boast extremely friendly service from host to server. We walked in for a meal and came out with new friends, and an incredible memory..down to a new nickname and inside jokes with the staff.   Go here for brunch. Go here for a nightcap. Go here for a great time. Just go here.  Thanks, BSBC! The Royal Gale loves ya ;)"}
{"text":"Long waits for brunch time but the food and drinks are consistently good. Stick to the menu, we've had a few lackluster specials."}
{"text":"A great place for a weekday breakfast/brunch. Plenty of empty tables on a Wednesday morning (but I could see it being very busy on the weekends). Appreciated the very large cups of coffee, interesting breakfast options (definitely recommend the savory french toast), and the quirky robot decor.   My friend had plenty of gluten free options to choose from and it was clear that the waitstaff had been trained to be understand gluten free needs. I know that she always appreciates when staff members are willing to double check that foods are safe for her to eat.   Disappointed that they were out of Cap'n Crunch donuts, but I was super impressed with the vanilla glazed sprinkle donut (which I would definitely get again, even though I am not normally a sprinkle person). The chocolate hazelnut was just okay."}

{"text":"I ordered the Savory French toast, strawberry donut, and coffee. The savory French toast wasn't bad, but it wasn't incredible either. I was kinda let down. I thought there would be some hint of sweetness for a savory-sweet blend, but it was basically an eggs Benedict with sourdough toast instead of a biscuit or muffin-- the French toast was really absent.   The donut wasn't bad. For $1.75 I expected more of a gourmet donut, but it was basically glazed with strawberry.   Good coffee, plenty of seating (during the week) and friendly service though. Also, remember you can park at the Hampton and get your parking ticket validated."}
{"text":"We went here today and this place is very good. It is a retro/hipster/trendy (but friendly and inviting) place with a little robot motif, fixtures from the '60s and cocktails! Every table has a plug and wifi so you can hang out while you eat the tasty food. Most of the dishes have a 'veggie' bent to them, so it is a bit healthy . . . except for the donuts! We had the plain glazed and it was super fresh and not too sweet, so it was good with my loose-leaf tea and wife's upscale coffee. Super creamy and tasty yogurt and I got a salad with my chicken & biscut.  It is right by the campus, but off of State Street so it has a college vibe, but quiet, too. Full bar and full of flavor. Try it out. I put only 4 stars because if you want some standard combos for breakfast (bacon/fried eggs/ hash browns) they don;t have those traditional combos. Check the menu first."}
{"text":"Brunch Club serves breakfast food all day long. Their extensive menu makes it almost impossible not to find something you'll love. Along with breakfast, they also have an entrée menu that you can order off of after 11 am including salads, sandwiches and burgers. For brunch, I highly recommend the breakfast nachos paired with one of their freshly made donuts (which they are known for). Yes, this is high in calories but lets be honest, you deserve it. They have an excellent selection of pancakes and to die for french toast to choose from. To be honest, you can't go wrong. Along with incredible food, the service and ambiance makes this place a must go to spot in Madison.   The one down side to Brunch Club is that the wait can be extremely long if you go during busy hours on weekends. My suggestion is go, put your name in, grab a Bloody Mary or Mimosa (whatever floats your boat) and sit and relax with your friends while you wait for a table to open up. Trust me, the wait is well worth it and you will not be sorry."}
{"text":"Some dishes are better than others, but the breakfast options are generally awesome, especially their chicken and biscuits. Great Colectivo coffee and a coffee bar staff that's consistent. They have really cheap doughnuts in the evening (the best time for breakfast). They're pretty good about handling the hordes of people that can swarm any time of day, and the service is fantastic. Yes, there are arguably better brunch restaurants in the world, but I prefer Bassett to Short Stack up the road, and both are part of the lifeblood of downtown and the UW campus."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast/brunch place! Menu has tons of options, including gluten free meals. Have ordered several things and never have been disappointed."}
{"text":"Nice place to grab brunch. Service was a bit slow but it was because there was lots of customers. The atmosphere was lively and the food tasted great. Food was not outstanding but definitely tasted better than average!"}
{"text":"I have just a few short words on this place. Best brunch in Madison. Simple as that.   It's easy to get to, easy to park, the food and cocktails are creative and delicious. Just what you need after a late Saturday night."}
{"text":"This place is very tasty with modern fare. The issue is the place is usually packed on the weekends, and it is NOT disabled friendly at all. The servers tend to be busy moving people along, and the people tend to be students who will not yield their seats to someone with a cane. Generally, less than desirable.  Also, not a great place for groups, since the larger you are, the longer you wait... I'd recommend expanding into the lobby space of the hotel to allow more occupancy, or perhaps serving to go menu and asking the hotel to accommodate you."}
{"text":"A classic Madison spot. Great breakfast, brunch, and donuts. Usually quite a wait but well worth it if you have time!"}
{"text":"This is an awesome spot for a brunch with friends. The ambiance is light and enjoyable, a good spot for a saturday morning with a day ahead of you. The breakfast is good, especially the avocado toast and the spring break diet (I add sausage), but I recently tried the lunch and I thought it was even better. The two lunch items perfect for a summer day if you're lucky enough to snag a table outside: 1) shrimp cobb salad (i took off the blue cheese and added a hard boiled egg). 2) fish tacos with blackened codd were also phenominal"}
{"text":"Brand new on-campus Food Fight Inc. restaurant! The entire inside and outside looks like it came straight out of Pinterest. Adorable bar, dairy bar, restaurant seating, and outdoor patio.  I couldn't tell this was a brand new restaurant (except the leather booths were so soft I had to have been the first 100 to sit down!) during my meal. The food and service were both great! We tried the Mediterreanean plate as a starter; savory french toast and the egg special as entrees; and obviously a homemade sprinkles donut for dessert. Everything was amazing! Best donut I've ever had, ever.   I had a couple of drinks: a bloody mary and the house \"rumchata\" cocktail. Both were presented well and tasted just as great as they looked.   Great experience, great vibes. Can't go wrong with another Food Fight Inc. restaurant!"}
{"text":"Service - standard  Wait time for food - pretty long for breakfast Food - average and not worth the wait Price - average"}
{"text":"I'm pretty Basic when it comes to breakfast, so today I ordered eggs,  bacon, some wheat toast,  and a side of mixed berries! You can pretty much never go wrong with the Basic necessities! Upon my initial greeting from the moment I walked in, I already had the feeling I was at home! Quinn was our waitress,  and she always comes to the table with a smile and a twinkle in her eye! Our service was Beyond Great! The manager Vicki even ran our food to the table and was super friendly!   Definitely recommending Brunch Club to everyone I know! Thank You B. C."}
{"text":"I really, really wanted to like this place as we'd heard great things, but we had a very uncomfortable experience when we recently tried to go here for brunch. When we arrived, we were offered seats at the bar or the option to wait for a table; we explicitly asked for a private table and said we were happy to wait. In the mean time we got coffee from an extremely nice bartender. After waiting for a table, we were lead to a curved bar in the back where we were seated with multiple other people. We thanked the server for the option, but restated that we had explicitly asked for a private table and that had we been ok with sitting with strangers and having no modicum of privacy, we would have just sat at the standard bar to begin with. Her response was that \"well, this is reserved seating, so it's different.\" Calling it \"reserved seating\" does not give the privacy of the private table we had explicitly asked for and assured that we would receive if we waited. A booth opened up at the same time so we asked if we could be seated there instead, but the server said that \"no, we're giving that to someone else\" -- it was the same size party, and people who came in after us. Every other employee here, including the bar/coffee tender and the hostess with the beautiful curly hair were incredibly nice, but this particular server was extremely rude and generally unkind, and left us feeling very uncomfortable. We ended up leaving so we could go somewhere where our request for a table would actually be honored; we explained the situation to the nice hostess on the way out and she was extremely professional an apologetic, but we were too uncomfortable with the rudeness of the woman who sat us to stay. We'd still like to try this place again in the future, hopefully the experience will be better and I can improve this review."}
{"text":"My go-to for breakfast, lunch, & dinner... that's how amazing the menu is! The homemade donuts are delicious along with the Colectivo coffee. I've always had a great experience with the waitstaff, whether it was me eating alone or with a group of 8. If I had unlimited funds, I'd probably eat here at least once a day."}
{"text":"We had a yummy breakfast here. The wait wasn't too long for a Saturday morning. The portions were huge and too much for one person to eat. I wanted to try the donuts but I didn't have room so I stopped in about a week later and brought bacon donuts to a staff meeting.  They were tasty. Thanks! Love the artwork also."}
{"text":"I was greeted promptly, given a table and menu immediately, looked the menu over for several minutes, then watched tge wait staff talk to each other for the next five minutes. Service?  NONEXISTANT!"}
{"text":"This place rocks. We had dinner here (I know brunch doesn't sound like a good evening spot but it is) starting off with their craft cocktail manhattan which was extremely tasty, followed by their meatloaf dinner which was very good.  The menu has something for everyone and the prices are very reasonable. We had such a great experience that we came back the next day for breakfast and that didn't disappoint. The savory french toast was very good (enjoy it with a bloody mary either spicey or regular). The pork carnitas with eggs (done any way you want) was also very good."}
{"text":"Tried out the new brunch club and we were pleasantly surprised! Menu is unique, and is a good blend of traditional breakfast food with trendy foodie additions. I had the Benedict which was delicious, and my husband had the farmers hash which was like thanksgiving in a dish! Coffee was great too. We look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"The food is decent but the waitstaff and bartender service is spotty.   I stay in the Hampton a lot for work and the level of attentiveness in the staff is all over the place. Two times now, I've spent over 10 minutes waiting for a server (or bartender) to acknowledge our presence after being seated."}
{"text":"What a great place!  We stayed two nights in the attached hotel, taking our son to see UW.  We ended up eating here three times in a very short span.  Great cocktails, friendly staff and delicious (and very fresh) food.  Can't be beat!"}
{"text":"I had known BSB was not too far from my office for a few years, and today I had a gift certificate so thought it a good time to try it out.  Its just over 3 blocks and I arrived at about 12:10, after a  look at the menu ordered a Gyro Burger and fries.    They weren't very busy, as confirmed by a waiter nearby telling a customer it had been a slow day so far.  Yet, It took over 20 minutes for my food to arrive!  When it finally did I didn't even have enough time to eat half before I had to be getting back to work.  Had it been good I may have taken it with, but my burger was burned black on the outside and dry and tough on the inside, also I didn't really taste the cumin and garlic that was supposed to be in the beef.   The fries were a good sized portion but were soggy, not crispy at all.  It was a disappointing meal all around.  Perhaps breakfast is good.   I am giving one star for my waitress who was great."}
{"text":"Fun place, food still needs a little work.   I love the decor and the service is awesome, wanted a little more out of the food that I ordered. You need to try the donuts though! Awesome flavors and they are sooooo good! I would recommend this place for anyone looking for a fun meal."}
{"text":"Staying at the Hampton Inn. Arrived later in the evening and was not wanting to go out for dinner. Front desk suggested BSBC.   Ordered the reuben and tots to go. In the time it took to drink an icy cold Spotted Cow, my order was ready. It was AMAZING! Pastrami was hot and plenty of cheese. Homemade thousand island dressing had just a bit of a kick and the tots were sprinkled with a bit of another flavor filled cheese. Definitely a good choice and will be a new favorite."}
{"text":"This place was an unexpected find - love the creative and unique menu options, and of course the donuts (omg!). We each had a different selection for our meal, and I don't think there was a crumb left. We had also shared a maple bacon donut and the took a six pack to go to share with friends. Highly recommend but expect a wait if you don't get there early, especially on Sunday. It's worth it though."}
{"text":"Had to wait long (over an hour) for our party of six, but it was worth it! It happened to be at a peak time - 10:30 am on a Saturday, so it was packed. We were able to wait in the lovely and comfortable reception area of the Hampton Inn, which is right next to the restaurant. The server brought us free donuts because of the long wait. Had Irish coffee, which was wonderful, and a beautiful omelette with delicious potatoes. The other dishes that were ordered by our group looked sensational, and everyone raved about them!"}
{"text":"Those doughnuts are pretty d@mn good!   We had a short wait for a table during prime brunch time on a Saturday. Highly recommend the lemon ricotta pancakes, for that matter any of the pancakes. Prices were fair for decent sized portions. I didn't read about parking in the pay ramps before arriving so we spent a few minutes circling the block to find parking.   Staff were busy so not as attentive as I would have liked. Loud and bright inside the restaurant so not where you go for a quiet, relaxing brunch."}
{"text":"A classic diner done new. Fresh donuts every day, score! Classic brunch cocktails, score! Delicious  food, score! Late night hours, score!  I ordered the farmers hash with poached eggs, wheat-berry toast and the homemade strawberry jam. Hash was full of veggies, eggs we cooked perfectly and the jam was clearly made in heaven. My daughter had the pot roast with mashed potatoes. It was a hefty portion and she loved it. My husband ordered the chicken & a biscuit, which was a play on biscuits and gravy. He thought it was delicious. We had a donut to share too. We liked it a lot, but it is different than donuts people are accustomed to. It is dense, but not heavy or greasy. The effect might seem dry to some, but we thought it was great. We topped it off with a slice of key-lime pie.   Parking is tricky to find. Turn into the alleyway just past the hotel circle drive. It looks like it might be for deliveries, but the parking structure entrance is just around the back.   Have a bite of toast with jam for me."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!!!!!!! Creative menu items. Way too much food for one person. Lovely outdoor dining area. Excellent customer service."}
{"text":"Went to brunch with the family. Not only were we satisfied, my mother stated that the blueberry ricotta pancakes \"we're the best pancakes [she's] ever had.\" Thats nearly 60 years of pancake eating, people.  They also brewed coffee to perfection. Buttermilk waffles were perfect. Omelette had a bit too much goat cheese. Side of bacon was only real complaint. It was bit fatty and thus they couldn't crisp.  Gold star BSBC!"}
{"text":"We had to wait and you most likely will have to wait, the good news is that it's well worth it.   The drink menu is just as appealing as the brunch menu.  I want to go back just so I can try some of the breakfast cocktails. (It was morning after final four win, was not up to it).   Breakfast was excellent.  Had the chilaquiles.  They were excellent.  Home made specialty donuts.  Real donuts, not overpriced crappy tasting Holey Moley donuts.  Great coffee.   It's worth the stop if you love breakfast and especially if you are hungover.    Go....do it.... Now!"}
{"text":"I am obsessed with Bassett Street Brunch Club! It's so good...never disappointing. It's always pretty busy but definitely worth the wait. My favorites are the avocado toast and the breakfast bagel which has avocado, and egg, and cheese on it. So good! I would definitely say this is the brunch spot in Madison!"}
{"text":"I do not usually write negative reviews but I need to this time re our recent experience here.  I was excited about going here for the first time but the food left much to be desired.  The chef in the kitchen had a very heavy hand with the herbs and spices for the eggs benedict.  Instead of highlighting the dish, the competing flavors battled each other and created a muddled and unpleasant taste.  The roasted tomato was not roasted and was ice cold so it also cooled the poached egg.  It was an unpleasant bite of food.  The server was quite good about taking it back and bringing me some pancakes, which turned out to be doughy and not very good.  Husband had the biscuit and chicken but again the flavor profile just wasn't good.  The flavors on the chicken breast did not meld well with the flavors of the biscuit.  What an overall disappointment for us.  I know there are tons of good reviews but this was our experience with the food."}
{"text":"Overrated, overpriced, and over spiced. At breakfast there, I had scrambled eggs, bacon, fried potatoes and toast. Pretty safe order you would think? Scrambled eggs were severely overcooked and rubbery, the fried potatoes were greasy and had a very strange strong spice on them that didn't taste good at the time and it really didn't taste good for the next 4 hours while I was burping it up. The bacon and sourdough toast we're OK. The maple bacon donut was average at best. I expected a doughnut with maple frosting and bacon, but what I got was a plain raised glazed donut with crumbled bacon on it. The donut's texture is quite doughy, nothing to write home about. I will not return."}
{"text":"By far my least favorite breakfast in Madison. A lot of bugs. Disappointed food. Just go to.short stack."}
{"text":"Get there early on a Sunday or you will wait. But well with the wait.  Try the maple bacon doughnut! Good coffee."}
{"text":"My return to BSBC was terrific. Went at a brunch-worthy time - around 11. And on a weekday, so we had no wait. Parked easily in the Hampton ramp this time.  I'm not really a breakfast gal (I don't like eggs), so I went for the poutine. It was a trifle salty, but I sort of like that (as Julia Child always said, potatoes require plenty of salt), so I'm not complaining, just noting. The poutine actually comes with a poached egg on top, but our server said we could get it on the side for my brunch companion to eat. How can you possibly to wrong with french fries, gravy, bacon and cheese? I was in heaven.  My guy had the American Style - two eggs, Knoche's breakfast sausage or bacon (he went with the sausage links), breakfast potatoes, and toast. The eggs were the perfect lightly over easy he ordered (he loooooves a runny yolk) and he raved about the sausage and potatoes, too. He remarked that it was nice that they had a simple, straightforward breakfast on the menu - because that's what he'll go for almost every time. He was also over the moon about the poached egg from the poutine - also perfectly runny inside.  His exact words after we finished were, \"We have to come here again.\" And so we will."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place based on the reviews. We started off with donuts just to try them. While they we're good, not the rave others had. The donuts itself is very heavy and toppings are ok. I am sure getting right when they are made would be better. We had the maple bacon and regular glazed.  Now for our main breakfast meal my wife had the creme brulee oatmeal and fresh fruit cup. This was very good although very sweet. Great combination of two items.  I had the Hangover omelet and breakfast potatoes. This was very good also. Two different cheeses on omelet and nice smoked ham that was shaved in.  Service was so so. Kept having to ask for coffee water to be filled.  Plates sat on our table with several servers walking by.  Big pet peeve of mine.  All in all we would recommend this place to anyone.  Go try it but get there early as it fills up quick."}
{"text":"SO SO GOOD! Just brightened up my finals week. After our 3:00 brunch, we studied there (outlets at every table) and stayed for dinner. Best addition to campus since Ian's."}
{"text":"Horrible... I went there once and it was awful, over priced and poorly prepared. I would rather go to Denny's. Seriously Taco Bell breakfast is better at least a teenager can properly cook the food."}
{"text":"The food was so amazing. Had the American with salmon and homemade biscuit. The place is really chic and decorated very cute. Staff was friendly. Donuts look great and the donut elf bakes them overnight. Ross, our server was nice and very attentive.   I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"All day breakfast -- yes please! Cool, playful vibe, tasty food and friendly staff...a fine addition to the Madison brunch rotation..."}
{"text":"It is hard to beat brunch and breakfast food served all day! especially a place with freshly made donuts. recently visited earlier this month for dinner (of course) and it was tough deciding from all the great choices! had the savory french toast and it did not disappoint. I appreciate that it had greens with it too! Tried both the chocolate hazelnut and one with espresso and I give the edge to the chocolate hazelnut. Service was very friendly."}
{"text":"Wow, the breakfast menu is amazing. So many unusual options. I just had the basic egg breakfast, and the eggs were perfectly cooked, the veggie sausage was tasty, and the grits were delicious! The biscuit tasted like it had been reheated on the grill, which was a little weird. Others at my table ordered omelets, which were gorgeous. Our server was very friendly and helpful. Cool place right inside the Hampton Inn, which is a great alternative for those of us who spend too much time eating hotel breakfasts."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. During my stay at the Hampton Inn, I got both the Savory French Toast and the Mac Attack, and both were delicious. Definitely will come back when I return to Madison!"}
{"text":"I adore this place. Super friendly staff, great food and drink selection (I highly recommend the Savory French Toast and Horchata for brunch, and they have a surprisingly fantastic Fish Fry on Fridays!). You can't go wrong eating here."}
{"text":"Went there on a Friday morning because I was craving grits and heard that they had them. After I ordered them to go, it took an hour for them to come out. For a single bowl of grits. It was fairly busy, but not too bad. When they did come out, they set them on the bar counter (I didn't know for sure if that was my order so I waited for them to say something) and I waited for another 10 minutes before they told me they were ready. So not only did I wait for about an hour, they were also cold."}
{"text":"Food is generally great, service (especially at the bar) can best be described as tentative."}
{"text":"Very pleasant and spacious setting.  Good service.  Solid food for the price.  We tried four different Doughnuts and they were all terrible ... Didnt know this was possible."}
{"text":"Bloody Mary geniuses. Ask for it spicy. Also, breakfast burrito/nito or something, whatever it's called, was ok. The savory French toast was delicious the sauce bacon and onions and salad just make this perfectly harmonious dish. Farmers hash was also great but just a tad repetitive, should've had maybe one or two more vegetables or ingredients in the mix rather than just sweet potatoes parsnips and onions.  Yuuum for maple bacon donuts!"}
{"text":"Oh my god the horchata latte is amazeballs!! And the food. I wanted to order the whole menu! I ordered the bananas foster French toast; it was beyond delicious and a huuuuge portion! Next time I'm going to order the farmers hash because it has parsnips in it. This place embodies the midwestern friendliness vibe with the menu creations you'd expect from a pretentious hipster place- trust me they left out the pretentiousness!"}
{"text":"I find basset street brunch club to be the most consistently prepared brunch in Madison. Quality preparations, with an array of options, makes this one of my weekend staples."}
{"text":"DONUTS!!!!  I always feel a little like Homer Simpson when I go in here because all I can think about its the yummy, delicious, fresh, unique donuts. They're so good, but big.   Rejoice however if you're not the donut type or want something a little more savory. Everything on the menu is great. The TV dinner is always fun and yummy. I love the meat loaf as well. The menu does change from time to time. But I urge you to take a leap of faith because the food gods I'm quite sure have played a role in every dish. If it sounds good at all get it, because it will most likely blow your mind."}
{"text":"This place is so important to me oh my god. The food is so good, any other brunch tastes like ash after eating here. Life wouldn't be worth living if this place weren't down the street from my apartment. Absolutely a Mecca for any brunchgoer in this state or in this country. God bless America."}
{"text":"WOW I absolutely love love love Bassett! I came here on a Monday morning with a friend for breakfast, and I Eggs Benedicto, Red Velvet Donut, Donut w/ cinnamon custard, and Horchata Latte.  What's great about Bassett is that they make classic breakfast foods with their own twists.  And while you can taste this \"twist\", the flavor of the classic breakfast food comes out.  They're really good with flavors such that the flavors mix well and that no one flavor overpowers another.  Both the donuts were really good, but we felt that they donuts were not as soft as they could have been.  Perhaps if we had come earlier (we were there around 10AM), the donuts would have been softer.  Also, I thought the custard filled donut did not have a good custard to donut ratio, and the donut ended up being a bit dry.  The Horchata Latte was amazing, but a little on the sweet side.  This didn't impact my rating, but I prefer sweeter coffee, so it's more of a heads up.  The horchata flavor really came out in the latte without overpowering the coffee flavor, which is great.  The Eggs Benedicto were AMAZING! I love eggs benedict because the egg is so soft and I love hollandaise sauce, and Bassett really nailed that! The egg was poached really well, and you could really taste that hint of lemon in the Hollandaise sauce.  They also add a tomato and salsa verde, and together it was a flavor explosion! (A good one of course).  Overall, I love how successfully Bassett tweaks typical breakfast foods without completely changing them.  They are really successful at combining flavors, and 10/10 I would come again."}
{"text":"The food is good; the wait staff is grace under pressure. The selection of food and prices are excellent. But the wait for a table on Saturdays is crazy long, way to long for me to go there regularly."}
{"text":"Was hopeful after reading the reviews, but...  They seem to pride themselves on their donuts.  I ordered the maple glazed with bacon donut.  The donut itself was more of a firm, possibly baked donut, with a heavy feel to it instead of being light and airy.  The maple glaze did not taste much of maple at all, and the bacon lacked much flavor.  The scrambled eggs were very firm, kind of tough, and barely warm.  The pancakes also had a dense heavy feel to them, not light at all.  They were also not very warm.  The best part of the breakfast were the potatoes.  Nice texture, well seasoned, and perfectly fried.  Would definitely not eat there again."}
{"text":"The service was great and even though sunday brunch is quite a wait, it is well worth it!! This is my favorite brunch spot in madison!"}
{"text":"All of the food was greasy diner style. My donut had a hair baked in. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Very mediocre food without a clear theme. The decor/design of the restaurant is very poor, like a slightly upscale McDonald's. The layout is equally poor as they only have a couple of tables that can fit more than 4 people even though the restaurant is huge! It's in a hotel so they will probably always have customers, but otherwise I don't think it would last.  Also, if you are going to call yourself a \"Brunch Club\" you really should have bottomless bloodies and mimosas and other brunch cocktails."}
{"text":"I went to Bassett Street Brunch Club with my boyfriend this past spring--we were in Madison celebrating our Anniversary and I wanted a cute brunch place.  OMG--this place was amazing!  The food was incredible, but their Horchata Latte was what sealed the deal for me!  I've been craving that latte ever since then... :)"}
{"text":"As with my review of Cafe Hollander, I am not going to lie, much like when a lab tech talks to you while they are doing a blood draw, an attractive staff can be a great distraction for any situation. Luckily I have never encountered a bad meal or situation at Bassett Street Brunch Club. The staff is sexy, they have a FULLY loaded bar and they have homemade doughnuts and a doughnut of the day. The options on the menu are plentiful and the service was excellent and the food comes out hot and fresh. The seating is intimate and the best part? I have not once had to listen to a screaming brat here. Perhaps the location deters parents from dragging their kids there or maybe its just the times of day that I arrive but I cannot stand when I pay for a good meal and someone's unruly child ruins it for me. Give Bassett Street a chance it is really good."}
{"text":"Amazing brunch place!  I found the Brunch Club as I was running by.  So glad I stopped in (twice!). Their \"wake up call\" drinks are delicious.  I would suggest the Wake Up Beer - a mix of a local porter and a shot of espresso.  For the non-beer drinkers, the frozen screwdriver and bellini were equally delicious.  I was also very impressed with the food options, very eclectic and friendly for all palates.  The Lox Box is picture perfect and my favorite.  I also enjoyed the Farmer's Hash - the sweet potatoes are fantastic.  Don't forget to get a homemade donut on your way out, the blueberry cheesecake donut was a winner.  Will definitely come by again when Im visiting Madison."}
{"text":"Very mainstream and not at all what I hoped for in a college town. I thought it was going to be a family restaurant based on their creative menu, but it was connected to a hotel and seemed very corporate. Overall, kind of a bummer. Food was just okay and overpriced for the quality. Service was friendly, effective and prompt."}
{"text":"I posted a review here a few months back, having only been there on a night when the service was very off.  I recently went for a second time and was pleased to discover that service had much improved, even though the day was busy due to the first farmer's market.  While some of the dishes are inventive, I haven't tasted anything truly outstanding yet. But the food has been tasty and well-prepared.  I like to go out to eat alone with a book, and this ambience isn't the best suited. But in a group of people, it could be comfy."}
{"text":"Lots of tasty options.  Vegetarian friendly.  Nice cocktails.  There's usually quite a long wait on the weekends, so I'd recommend going earlier than the students."}
{"text":"Finally got to try out THE BSBC.    Setup:  It was a weekday morning. Me + One Adult + one kiddo = 3. Place was quiet, got to choose inside or out, we chose outside even with the construction going on and no real view. Our waitress was patient and slightly helpful (she hadn't tried everything). I overheard another waitress stating \"not sure\" when another table asked \"what's popular?\"  Drinks: I've been raving to my friends about the best Bloody's in town... someone mentioned here, so I figured I should test it out myself. I sampled the mix by itself (no alcohol) - had hope. Ordered. Was brought an average pint sized glass with a nice looking Bloody - great consistency to it: not too clear; not too much muck. Getting excited... until I see the toppers - um cucumber? in MY bloody? wuuuut? I did ask for a Bloody and not some freaked up mojito or Pimm's cup, right? Ok, moving on... taste. Fail. Maybe too much vodka, maybe cukes are throwing me? It's just another case in point to how hard it actually is to perfect the Bloody Mary, and why my other favorites are really worth it. Coffee - not a huge fan of Collectivo coffee. I died mine down with ice and water. Ordered soy, just in case, charged 0.50 cents, never used it. This just irritated me... another reminder that just cuz it's Madison doesn't mean everyone respects lactose problems.   Food:  Donuts - meh... creative idea... but they just tasted like a chocolate donut I could get at the big name spot. Additional info: when sitting in sun, let chocolate topping melt a little. Gooey!  Savory French Toast - weird looking but very beautiful. By the time you get first bite, you've been eye eating that bastard from every direction! THIS is the MOST POPULAR dish, little miss waitress. The parmesan soaked french toast is an interesting flavor combo: kinda stinky cheese meats slight tasting (balsamic?) vinegar hollandaise saucd. Add bacon and egg = unique. It has this \"slap you in the face\" then \"rub your belly\" approach to breakfast. I loved it. The side salad was a welcome treat... for those of you who feel the breakfast is \"too heavy.\"  Chilaquiles - been making these at home.. just IN LOVE with them. So I want to find a GREAT place in Madison to do it for me. Gave it a go. First, you have to like qaujillo salsa. It's a burnt tomato/pepper taste with a medium heat to it. I am not a fan of this salsa on my chilaquiles. I like fresh basic tomato/cilantro/onion/lime salsa. This kind of broke the breakfast for me... not horrible, just not for me. I did eat enough to gorge, and I will note that the rest of it is just gorgeous and big portions. The chips looked home-made or from a place that makes them home-made style. I give a bonus here. The chicken was moist, pull-apart style medium chunks, and good amount. They accommodated my request for poached eggs - to perfection. The thin sliced radish and cilantro leaves were good additions.    Overall: Outdoor seating is un-exciting with construction right across the way and without the possibility of a good view (I believe those are big apartments going up?). They have large tables that could fit big groups and many menu options to offer different appetites; they even have donut apps! The Savory French toast is a standout. The portions are big. I shoulda listened to my yelpers on the bloody mary, but I had to try it myself. Something's just a little off. Next time I'll try that Vodka lemonade."}
{"text":"Their doughnuts and frozen mimosas are worth the above-average prices. It's in the heart of downtown Madison, perfect for a post-night-out brunch."}
{"text":"What can I say about this place it's Artie got 315 reviews and 315  Route 15 or uses because this place is amazing. I wouldn't for a healthy breakfast and was able to sit there and work the whole time. Free Wi-Fi and great food coffee in service this place Is a home run!"}
{"text":"Went for brunch with my husband around noon on a weekday. Didn't have to wait at all. Place has a sleek and fun vibe. We decided to sit at the bar and try the Bloody Mary. Quite good - really good pickles in it. The bartender recommended the savory French toast and it was VERY good. That dish alone will bring us back. I had the chicken and a biscuit with a delicious corn sausage gravy over a biscuit and fried chicken breast. Also very tasty.  We were too full for dessert but took some donuts to go. If they happen to have the lemon donut when you're there, it's a real winner.  Parking was available for free on Dayton Street but it took me a while to find. I now know that they share the ramp with the hotel (Hampton Inn, which they are located in) so when there is parking available in the ramp that would be the way to go. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place. I have a great history of loving Food Fight restaurants, and on paper this place had a good chance of being my favorite. Brunch all day? Awesome! Full drink menu! Fantastic! Convenient downtown location? Sign me up!  Unfortunately, things don't always work out as well as I want them to. I've been here twice and I'll comment on the most recent outing.   We arrived at about 3pm on a Saturday and the restaurant is soaked in eye-level blinding light. They gave us a booth that was in the shade but ten minutes later the sun moved and I had to sit next to my wife to preserve my eyes. No big deal. I had a great Manhattan (seriously, it's really good) on the way. It should be noted now that I love their drink menu. And they have a scotch selection that is better than most bars. Seriously, Oban 14? You don't see that around. Even Malt House doesn't have it.  Anyway, I ordered the corned beef reuben and my wife got chilaquiles. My reuben was about 50% bread, 35% cabbage, and 15% pastrami, which was a bit chewy. They also forgot to put the 1000 island dressing on it, so I had to ask the waitress for it and got it on the side. The chilaquiles were not chilaquiles. They were \"chilaquiles\". Imagine if you took bread crumbs and put cooked ground beef on top of it and called it a \"burger\". Go ahead and look up chilaquiles. What they serve here is fried tortilla chips with some sauce and chicken dumped on top. I see another reviewer commented on the chilaquiles not having enough sauce. Seriously, go to Eldorado and try theirs.   When we commented on the c hilaquiles being much different than any other chilaquiles we've had elsewhere, the waitress was nice enough to talk to the manager and get that dish comped, which we weren't really asking for, but it's a great gesture that shows good customer service. Unfortunately the manager had to come by later and let us know that the menu really explained the dish pretty well, so (this went unsaid, I just inferred it) really we should've know what we were getting. Regardless, they gave us the dish for free, which was very nice.  I struggled with a 2 vs 3 rating. It's definitely above average and I feel like they are pretty new and still have some menu and food issues to work out. I think if you stick to straight brunch items and booze, you can't go wrong. I'm willing to try it again sometime in the future if things change, but as of now I feel like they've fallen short of my expectations for a Food Fight brunch restaurant."}
{"text":"Ate at the bar with several great local beers on tap! Michelle the bartender is so nice and very cute. Great place and convenient especially if your staying at hotel (Hampton Inn). I look forward to spending time there again on March 28th."}
{"text":"Oh my god was this place ridiculously awesome. Sure our server didn't seem too swift but the good allowed me to forgive everything. Got the breakfast nachos and yes please I will have another. The mole sauce was amazing, avocado fresh and untainted, got a side of black beans and jalapeños and I was in heaven. My beau got the spring break diet and although he said it was ok I tasted it and lived it - big fail putting ketchup on a thing of such beauty!  All around will be back if ever in Wisconsin again. Yum"}
{"text":"Just had an amazing birthday breakfast (Denver Omelette)! Great food/great value. We had perfect service from our server Kate. Everyone was very friendly, knowledgeable of their menu, and welcoming. My manhattan was perfect. My wife had the hot tot burrito and our friend had the green goddess grilled cheese with tomato soup. We expected great and everything exceeded our expectations. We topped it all off with one of their amazing donuts...highly recommend."}
{"text":"Tough to get in on weekend mornings. Everything's great, but the pancake is a little bit too dry."}
{"text":"If I had to sum this place up in one word, it would be Blah.   I've been here twice, and both times I was sure it would great given the large and diverse menu. I was here both times with a group of five, and it's nice when everyone leaves happy. Alas, that doesn't happen here.  The first time, I ordered the savory French toast. It literally tasted like nothing. Nothing. My friend said she nearly went into a diabetic coma with the chocolate pancakes, but I think that can be expected with such a dish. Everyone else's dish was also mediocre, but the tater tots were a big hit.  Though it takes more that potato puffs to win me over, we decided to give this place another try. It certainly is conveniently located. I ordered the Mac Attack, which somehow tasted just like the savory French toast. The only thing I could sort of taste were the sweet potatoes. I ate the entire bowl and still felt unsatisified.  Both times we had good service. I've like my drinks (a proper daiquiri, not a Slushie), and the doughnuts are decent. Honestly, though, I love anything with Oreos on it and I ordered a \"chocolate\" fought which turned out to be chocolate glazed. I'm not 25 anymore (and maybe that is their target market), so doughnuts and booze alone aren't enough to win me over."}
{"text":"One of my favorite brunch spots in Madison! Ambiance is fun and perfect for get-togethers with friends. pro tip: they reimburse for parking in the hotel parking lot that is attached to the restaurant! Also, the donuts are 50% off after a certain time in the night! The spring break diet is one of my favorites for a not-too-heavy brunch meal!"}
{"text":"The 25 minute wait was completely worth the deliciousness that I wolfed down! While the service left a lot to be desired, the food was spot on.   My friend and I sat at the little coffee shop area in the back of the restaurant and apparently there was miscommunication between the host staff and the serving staff. We weren't greeted or waited on for at least 10 minutes. They soon made good on their bad service by offering us each a free donut. We both decided on the maple bacon. The donut was soft and the bacon crunchy. Neither of us could taste much  of the maple flavor.  My Savory French Toast was amazing. It was perfectly balanced between the bacon, tender toast, onions and that heavenly hollandaise. Amazing.  Next time I'm visiting my friend, I will for sure be back...but after 11am so the wait will be less!"}
{"text":"Fried chicken to die for! delicious bloody mary! skip Mimosas:) Great staff and service! Definitely would come back!"}
{"text":"Ambiance/service: Really funky atmosphere. Little hipster diner feel to it. Mostly booth seating. The wait staff is all young and fairly attentive. The wait for food has been historically pretty slow. We had a party of 8 and it took 50 minutes for our food to come out.    Food: all the menu items sound to die for but I've only had some luck in ordering things that are actually fantastic . I've had the Thai peanut bowl. It was really watered down and honestly just gross. Then I tried the rice bowl. Maybe it's my own fault for order Asian at a breakfast place but that was not good either. The last time I went I got the hot to tot burrito and that was phenomenal. Their breakfast potatoes are pretty good too, but I like that you can get greens for the same price.  Overall pretty decent food for a decent price."}
{"text":"Instead of a date night, the husband and I went here for date brunch last Sunday.  We got there around 945 and was quoted a 50 minute wait, which we expected.  I liked that we were able to get a drink if we wanted and wait in the hotel lobby instead of standing clustered around the door waiting.  30 minutes into our wait time, the hostess found us and let us know there were 2 spots open at the back breakfast bar if we wanted to sit there instead of a table, which would be another 20 min. wait.  We didn't care where we sat- we were just hungry! I started with the spiked horchata and the husband got the house 'rita.  The drinks were small, but tasty.  For brunch, I ordered the steak rancheros and he ordered the bananas foster french toast.  The waitress and kitchen staff actually remembered that I ordered without beans or radishes, which I can't say for every restaurant out there.  I had a side order of breakfast potatoes, which I can't say I'd pay extra for again.  They were a bit bland and soggy.  The side of bacon though is WELL worth it! I will say sitting at the breakfast bar is a bit noisy because you are right next to the kitchen window, so you hear wait staff calling for orders, the dishwasher and all the dishware clattering.   I'll definitely be back--I've got my eye on the coconut cream french toast!"}
{"text":"A solid 5 stars. Go see Michelle at the bar.   Good drinks and all day breakfast (full bar) in a funky little cafe.   Although it is located inside he Hampton In , there is nothing 'meh' about this place.   Big, solid comfort food with a full bar and bartenders who know how to pour.   A great selection of craft beers in bottles and a few on tap. Happy hour  from 3-6pm with $3 taps and $5 classic cocktails make his an after work special.   Solid food. Doughnuts. And all day breakfast.   Sold!"}
{"text":"All their food is incredible. Typically has a long wait, completely worth it though. Donuts, coffee, brunch items are all delicious."}
{"text":"Fresh ideas for brunch entrées. Plenty of yummy drinks to try too with clever names. Nice outdoor seating. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to grab some Brunch or Lunch.  Don't let the fact that it's below a hotel fool you.  The ambiance is really cool (read: hip), and the food as really good.  In my top three brunch spots in town.  Don't forget to get a doughnut to go.   NOTE: Highly recommend the Wake Up Beer:  Wisconsin Brewing Chocolate Porter with a shot of fresh Colectivo espresso.  This will get you going!"}
{"text":"Very popular. Unique breakfast ideas, huge selection. Something for everyone. Management clearly cares about satisfying the customer"}
{"text":"I don't eat here anymore due to limited options, but for me the food was always pretty average for the price. The breakfast potatoes are delicious though, and so are their fun and sometimes alcoholic breakfast drinks. They also have vegan donuts on Sundays, which are awesome!"}
{"text":"It was late-ish on a Sunday and we'd just finished up at Badger Women's Hockey game and wanted food before heading home. BSBC hit on all the right notes.   Best Iced Coffee I've Ever Had.   I was recommended to get one of the adult juice boxes, but was unfortunately driving.   We sat on the patio on an unseasonably warm night in October and had the best comfort food a gal could ever ask for while listening to amazingly nostalgic music over the loud speaker.   If you want something healthy and calorie-conscious, this isn't your jam. But if you want fun, creative, delicious breakfast any time of the day, look no further.   We had no donuts - the pickings were a little slim so late in the day and we were full - but I'll definitely be back to try those out.   We'd had a long day, had drive back to Milwaukee on the horizon and just wanted to be content and full and BSBC delivered."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to coming here because the reviews seemed to be good and the menu looked promising.  I'm sad to say it wasn't what I had hoped.  The food was just \"Meh\".  I ordered the Carnitas Hash.  What I did like was that it wasn't overly greasy.  However, the pork was a bit on the dry side and the food was bland, in my opinion.  The cheese curds were DELICIOUS, though!  The batter was spectacular.    We had amazing service from Alisa.  She was positive, upbeat, and energetic.  Even though she was busy, she always took time to make sure we were taken care of.  She was very in tune to the fact that our appetizers were taking longer than expected and did what she could to keep us happy, including letting us try some donuts, which were yummy.  The wait was over an hour (likely because it was graduation weekend).  We took a walk around the area to kill time.  Would I wait that long again knowing what I know now?  Probably not.    Overall, it's worth a try, but not if you have to wait an excessive amount of time.  Would I come back if a friend was dying to try it?  Sure.  Would it be my first choice for brunch?  Nah."}
{"text":"Really creative, fun, and different breakfast menu! The savory french toast and oatmeal creme brulee are just delicious! The service and staff are the most friendly and efficient that I have found at a Madison brunch spot. They really go above and beyond and take care of their guests!"}
{"text":"Food: 4+ stars Drink: 3+ stars Service at Table: 2 stars Service at Bar: 4 stars Service at Host Stand: 3+ stars  This morning, we had great food and good drink at BSBC. But (and the buts are significant), we arrived just before 11 am, and were told the wait would be about 30 min. It was actually almost 60 min. Obviously the actual wait time is not in the control of the Host Stand staff and they were super nice when we checked in about where we were on the list. But they need to get a better handle on estimating wait times. When we were seated, our server took our order, brought us waters, and disappeared. He didn't bring the drinks we ordered and after 30+ minutes, we went to the bar and asked for our Bloody Mary. He checked in with us and we reminded him of our Horchata order. And he disappeared again. 15+ minutes later our food arrived (delivered by someone who wasn't our server) but no Horchata. We resorted to asking the Host Stand about our Horchata, for more salsa, and for a refill on our waters. That got taken care of and everyone seemed to be confused about what happened to our drink orders. We were confused about that, but also how our server never managed to check in with us about water, or when we could expect our food, or ??? until we'd already taken matters into our own hands. So - the service - more specifically - our server needs to get a better handle on how to do his job.   But - the food was great (Spring Break Diet, CYC Omelet, and Pastrami Rueben) and the drinks were very nice. The donut we had while waiting for our table was tasty as well.   Overall, we'd go back, but not a peak time on a weekend, and we'd likely try to sit at the bar as that service seemed to be turning over rapidly.   It is a busy and noisy environment, I'm not sure it's good for groups or for kids during peak times (just due to the waiting, the noise, etc). Based on the appearances of other diners though - it apparently is the HIPSTER place to be. ;-)    And, I really hope they get a better handle on estimating wait times and training servers (or our server at least)."}
{"text":"Bassett Street Brunch Club has a lot going for it--dope donuts, great coffee (Colectivo, a Milwaukee homebrew and Madison favorite), and a pretty fun atmosphere. People have said great things about the frozen screwdrivers, as well.   However, to get my go-ahead, it's going to have to take it a little further. In general, I find the food to be pretty good, but not mind-blowing for the relatively expensive prices. My bloody mary had none of the great snacks that Wisconsin bloodies are famous for, although the pickle garnish was pretty delicious. The farmer's hash is excellent, but otherwise the breakfast options are lacking. And only two types of pancakes? Cmonnn  But, if you're going for a convenient place to nurse a hangover with your friends, it's not a bad place to settle down. There's almost always a wait on weekend mornings (to be expected, I mean, it's in the name....) so be sure to plan ahead!"}
{"text":"Such good breakfast!! Had a vanilla latte, and the American style! So yummy! Service was also fabulous!! The atmosphere was really cool! They even validated our parking!!   The serving sizes are really big for your money. So you're basically getting two meals!  Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"We went here recently with two friends when our thanksgiving trips overlapped. We were just getting back from red-eye, so understandably we were tired.  The food was good, I got their corned beef hash (which they make themselves), and my wifey got the farmer's hash.  The corned beef was great and hit the spot, though the scrambled eggs in the farmer's hash was rubbery (overcooked).    Our dining partners seemed to get inconsistent servings however; the other corned beef plate had *much less* beef and made up the difference with potatoes.  While this place tries screams breakfast, it mostly feels like a Monty's that is downtown... which isn't necessarily a bad thing; it's just not different.  I just felt like this place was missing the 'breakfasty' vibe.  Maybe that's a consequence of its short lifespan so far, but nothing was super notable.  This place doesn't have soul yet..  They validate parking too, you can just pull into the hotel parking lot and you get a 2hr free pass :)"}
{"text":"I was drawn by my love of Shakshuka -- they did not disappoint! Great spice and heat and a classic, albeit upscale, diner setting.  The service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday brunch and I couldn't have a made a better choice! The menu has something for everyone - healthy eaters, sugary stuff, and the dietary needs people! Needless to say, I went with the sweet stuff (French toast banana foster) and it was a great choice.  Full of flavor, and cooked to perfection. Atmosphere is super fun with current music (softly) playing and a retro toy vibe. Service was also excellent. They gave me a free donut for my birthday (as they always do) and when I lightly pointed it out that I had accidentally been charged, he felt so bad that he even deducted the cost of my coffee (which was of pretty decent quality). In any event, I definitely know where I'm going for the rest of my brunches in Madison!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, service, drinks, and food!  My family and I all thought the menu was eclectic enough for everyone to find something that appealed to them.  The food was delicious and the portions are more than ample.  Not really sure what to recommend since I thought all of the meals were very good.  I would recommend the BC Old Fashioned.  As an Old Fashioned purist, I was sceptical at first.  Great twist on my favorite WI cocktail. The doughnuts are tasty too, but get them early...they were pretty picked over by late morning."}
{"text":"This will be short and sweet...   Went at 11:30 on a weekday. Business was slow. Loved all the windows and the decor. I had a bagel and lox. I was super impressed when my meal arrived. It was in a segmented \"bento box\". Cute and functional.   Toasted crispy Gotham everything bagel, cream cheese, pickled onions (fab!), a generous serving of delicious lox, olives, tomato and lettuce. Hit the spot.  Excellent friendly service. Didn't realize you can park there for free. Wish I had known.  Too many mediocre Food Fight restaurants... D-Luxe, Texas Tubbs, Hubbard St Diner. I plan to return to Bassett Street Brunch. I hope I still feel the same way after trying a variety of their dishes."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and got breakfast dishes both times. The first time I got the spring break bowl--it was satisfying without being heavy. Delicious! The second time I got the pork carnitas hash and found it a bit on the salty side. The pork had a leftover taste to it, like it had been prepared earlier and then reheated, and it didn't have much flavor other than salt. But the salsa that came with it was delicious, and so was the multigrain toast I got on the side. Also got a donut to-go and it was tasty. A good place overall--I always love finding unique places that serve breakfast all day!"}
{"text":"Ehhhh I really want to love this place so much. They have great gluten free options and a mimosa that makes me want to drink at 8am but it's just kind of blah. Nothing stood out and it was all very generic - not a lot of flavor. I want to love you guys but just not that impressed!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure how long you could possibly wait for some eggs and pancakes. I don't get it. Our 15 minute wait turned into an hour, and we've been now waiting 52 minutes for our food. 2 half stacks of pancakes and a few eggs. It took 20 minutes to get coffee even. I can't really say how disappointed I am so far. 25 hottest brunches across America poster on the wall. Who cares if you have no service appeal nor bandwidth in the kitchen to make food."}
{"text":"After missing the frozen screwdrivers due to an ice machine malfunction, and thanks to their wonderful owner, I was able to finally enjoy a frozen screwdriver while waiting for my ride home on Wednesday afternoon. It was just as delicious as I thought it would be!   A+ for food and A++ for awesome service."}
{"text":"This place is one of my new favorites!  So many yummy choices on the menu, it was hard to decide.  Sat at the bar counter with my husband and it was quaint AND we didn't have to wait on a busy Sunday.  Service was awesome, food great.  Park at the hotel and they will validate your parking.  It is worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast there. Simple yet delicious! Very nice atmosphere, prompt service! Great place!"}
{"text":"This is a regular stop for us when we're in town visiting Madison. They have quality food at a good price. It's tough to get in most weekend mornings, so pretty much always expect a wait. Their menu is good for both brunch and dinner, so don't be discouraged by the name if you're looking for dinner!!   They also have a good selection of cocktails and desserts. I normally like to get a donut while I'm there! For brunch, pretty much everything is a good choice on the menu.   The reason for the 4 stars is that I've been disappointed in the food the last few times I've gone-- it's been very good, but less flavorful than before it seems. I got the shashushka last time and the sweet potato dish the time before that. Both are good, but don't leave me wanting more!"}
{"text":"I really don't understand the hype about this place. Since all of my friends are obsessed, I've given it a handful of chances (including dinner and brunch), but it disappoints every time.  There's nothing wrong with it per say; it's just very mediocre. I've tried many different things on the menu as my friends are convinced I will find the item I'll fall in love with, but nothing has ever hit the spot.  If I was rating this place for the coffee and donuts, I'd give it 5 stars in a heart beat. The donuts are out of this world. However, the rest of the menu items leave something to be desired."}
{"text":"Are you ready for this jelly? I mean, this review? Well, I am ready for a donut.  BSBC is agonizingly close to 5 stars. What's keeping them from a perfect score? Well, the occasional wait staff error, to be honest. The menu rarely changes and there are no daily food specials to my knowledge. Slight downgrades, but enough to keep this reviewer at 4 stars.  I dream of BSBC's 'Chicken and a Biscuit\" both day and night! IT'S THAT GOOD. The chicken is fried to perfection and boneless. The veggie gravy is a lovely consistency, and biscuit often warm and toasty. Even the side salad is a nice compliment. The donuts are tasty! I enjoy one at nearly every visit! Colectivo Coffee is a major winning decision for BSBC - decaf or reg. That's right...I have ordered decaf here (keep that quiet, it will ruin my coffee rep.), and they brew it well! The menu is diversified and well-developed, including accommodating gluten-free needs and a small vegan selection, if I am not mistaken. GF friends and family have raved about this option, but the price hikes for them are not listed on the menu, and wait staff do not inform you of them either. That's kind of a bummer.  I have ordered coffee beverages to go, which BSBC happily accommodates as a walk-in or dine-in customer - found this tidbit out via the Yelp \"message the business owner\" feature!   Sitting at the bar will SIGNIFICANTLY cut down on any 1-2+ hour wait time you might experience. Especially on weekends - it's a MAD HOUSE. Show up earlier than you expect on the weekends, because you'll definitely find a lengthy wait!  Bathrooms are kept very clean and well-stocked, except right after the main dinner rush hour time, I have noticed. Nothing appalling, though.  BSBC... I will hold out for that final star. You have earned my loyalty as a \"Basic Brunch Bae\".  Nicely done!"}
{"text":"It was pretty crowded for brunch but we got in right away. I had the eggs benedict and it was really good. Pretty cool diner type place without feeling greasy. Job well done."}
{"text":"Are you kidding me?!?  Don't pass this place up! This eatery is amazing!  Came into town for a week for work, stayed at the Hampton Inn.  What a lucky pull...attached to the hotel is this totally awesome restaurant.  I'm a huge breakfast fan and being able to get a fresh made breakfast any time of day is fantastic.  I've been here a week (5 days) and have eaten here 3 times!  Ordered the Cyc Omelette 2.0 on two occasions, it was amazing and is absolutely one of my fave omelette ever!!! I also enjoyed the Lemon Ricotta pancakes.  Added some strawberries just because.  The portion was HUGE!  I'll be having leftovers tomorrow.  Can't say enough about this place.  Two people could easily share these delicious pancakes!  So glad I found this place - total fluke as I had no idea the quality of the food. Fortunately, I'll be coming back to town every few months over he next few years, I will definitely be visiting the Bassett Street Brunch Club whenever I am in town.  Great atmosphere, awesome staff, Tom was a great, knowledgeable waiter and made great recommendations, although I am certain that there is not a bad item on the menu.  Not a breakfast fan?  Plenty of other \"yummy\" looking items on the menu to choose!  Get here soon...and enjoy!  Tell Tom I said \"Hello!\""}
{"text":"I had the bananas Foster French toast, bacon, and coffee. We had to wait about 30 minutes to get in but it was a Sunday morning, so the wait was about what I was expecting. The espresso machine was broken, so I was unable to get a café au lait. I asked the waitress for some extra milk instead--she just brought me cream, but since she also brought cream for my friend who asked for black coffee, it worked out for me. The French toast was good--I especially liked the amount of cinnamon and that the presence of bananas made the breakfast seem less unhealthy. But really, the French toast was just good, not fantastic. The bacon was fine, but not memorable. If rather go to Four and Twenty for breakfast if I have the choice."}
{"text":"All around great people and good food.  They had K4 Fantasy Factory on tap!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend trying the Savory French Toast."}
{"text":"This place has quickly become a brunch staple. Pretty much everything I've had hear has been great!   Love the eggs Benedict! They also have a beer/expressing drink which is surprisingly delicious."}
{"text":"Came for brunch on a Sunday. This was my third time here, have been for brunch one other time and also a late dinner. Expect to wait up to an hour for a table if you come for brunch. Luckily the connected hotel lobby has some comfortable seating and you can grab your coffee or drink of choice from the bar while you wait.  This is a great place to go with a group. The decor is retro and fun and their menu is pretty large so it's great when you can't decide on a specific type of food. I'm giving this place three stars because in my experience, their food has always been just alright.  They have a tendency to add vegetables where they are not necessarily expected so make sure you read the menu description. My first time I had the macaroni and cheese which came with butternut squash. This probably would have been fine if the squash had been cooked a bit longer to have the same texture as the noodles. As it was, I knew every time I had a piece of squash in my mouth, and not in a good way. The stringy texture caused me eat around the squash. Second time I had gnocchi. I don't think this is on their menu anymore. The only thing I remember about was that it was very heavy for a brunch dish. This time around I had the breakfast nachos. This was an intimidating breakfast! Chips like you get at a Mexican restaurant, definitely fresh fried with that tiny taste of grease, piled high and smothered in a red chile sauce. The sauce caused the chips to lose their shape pretty quickly and I was expecting quite a bit more heat. I also grabbed a caramel donut to go and it was just ok. Didn't really taste like anything more than fried dough and I didn't end up eating the whole thing."}
{"text":"A wonderful dining experience! Their staff is very friendly and I've never had a bad meal! They have an awesome selection for any kind of diet you could imagine. I highly recommend the Bloody Mary too! You won't be disappointed with Basset Street Brunch Club."}
{"text":"We swung by around 2:30 today and had an awesomemeal! Ordered the Denver Omelette special with breakfast potatoes and extra ham ($11) and the Oatmeal Creme Brulee with a side of berries ($8).  Pros!: -Our server, Ronald, was funny and enthusiastic! -We were big fans of the decor and super-comfy swivel bar chairs. -Denver Omelette had generous amounts of sauteed onions and peppers and plenty of cheese; It was generally pretty darn savory and tasty -Brown sugar shakers on the tables.. Nice touch! -The staff enthusiastically gave us a table along the South West wall and put up the shades to help me get some Vitamin D. -The Oatmeal Creme Brulee delightfully blended the wholesome mouthfeel of fresh-cooked oatmeal with the serotonin-y desertness of creme brulee.  Cons (just a few minor cons which might not be cons.): -My potato preferences are pretty run-of-the-mill, but I thought that the breakfast potatoes could have used a bit more cooking time.  -Oatmeal Creme Brulee was a bit on the smaller side, thought Girlfriend and I had plenty of food and ended up taking a small box home. -We couldn't buy any of the super-comfy swivel chairs; We asked if they had any old ones they were getting rid of, but nope.  Summary:  Great place to sit around, look at art and decor and listen to music (5 stars) - The people working there are warm and attentive (5 stars) - The food is pretty tasty too. (4 stars)"}
{"text":"Great family-friendly spot! Laid-back vibe with fun robot/retro decor. Plenty of vegetarian-vegan options for me, as well as, traditional options for the rest of the family. Excellent variety of drink options, lots of unique concoctions and menu twists, and a full bar. Booth seating, tables, or the traditional diner bar experience. We all had breakfast options, but there were plenty of appealing sandwiches, salads, and entrees on the menu, as well. In town for 4 days, but probably will be back one more time before we leave!  Note: Biscuits are not traditional southern style. They have jalapeños? (but not super spicy) and are served split, toasted (probably on a flat top?), and buttered. Went really well with our food! Especially with the strawberry jam!"}
{"text":"I came here with 3 others during their busy time on Saturday morning (around noon), we had an hour wait, but I really wanted to try this restaurant so the rest of the party sucked it up and waited with me.  We decided to order some drinks - their Bloody Mary is pretty good, the sweet pickles are delicious. I ordered a frozen screwdriver while we were eating - it tasted like an orange dreamsicle but was a bit too much sweetness for me to finish.  The wait seemed to last forever, but they allow you to sit out in a lobby area which is nice because then you aren't crammed by the bar.  Me and one other ordered the Spring Break Diet, over easy eggs on mine. It was delicious! Served with corn tortillas really made it hit the spot. One other in our group ordered the Eggs Benedict - now this is something I would get if we come back again! The last person in the group ordered the double chocolate pancakes.. I mean these were pure chocolate, like a big 'ol brownie. He is a pancake and sweets lover and he said they were the best cakes he has ever had. Ordered some donuts to try later on and we also enjoyed those. They had good consistency and were just the right amount of sweet.  Overall delicious but recommend coming during their slower hours!"}
{"text":"I enjoy this place quite a bit. I've only ever ordered off their breakfast menu, so I can't speak to the other menu items, but everything I've had has been quite good- the farmer's hash, shrimp and grits, lemon blueberry ricotta pancakes, and my personal favorite, the breakfast bur\"roti\". The horchata is a glass of rich rice-y goodness, and the Collectivo coffee is a fab accompaniment. And don't forget the donuts; good lord that besprinkled ring of deep-fried dough is tasty. So why not 5 stars? I just can't put my finger on it, but I feel like the place lacks a bit of charm. It feels sort of business-y tucked into the bottom of a hotel, and I get this corporate air from the place. So the food has yet to disappoint, but there is still just something missing for me (hence the 1-star deduction)."}
{"text":"I'm really not impressed by this place, despite the other reviews here. I feel like I'm eating at a diner and there's really nothing special about the omelette my idiot self makes at home versus the omelette I might get at my local diner versus the omelette here. Save yourself the hellish wait for a table and stay home. Someone else can make you an omelette"}
{"text":"Bassett Street Brunch Club is best described as your low-key but put-together best friend. With robots and donuts as mascots, the food isn't designed for delicate palates, but it's hard to go wrong in Wisconsin when you show that deep fryer some love and serve up diner-inspired fare with fresh ingredients.   Their unlimited coffee tasted distinctly Colectivo, and I had about two seconds to admire the nice sheen of coffee oils on top before slurping them into my morning face. Their risen donuts are denser than expected in a satisfying way, like squeezing a fluffy stuffed unicorn with your teeth.   My dining companion was a fan of the Spring Break Diet bowl filled with brown rice and black beans, coaxed by queso fresco and creamy avocado. The Farmer's Hash with sweet potatoes and brussel sprouts had all the ingredients I never knew to long for in the morning, and made me think twice about neglecting rosemary in my own cooking.    Validated parking at the Hampton Inn next door provided respite from a busy street like Johnson. While the brunch-a-lots will have this place packed on the weekends, the pleasant waiting experience in the hotel lobby and the location's accessibility will make this a regular go-to spot for my last-minute morning meetups."}
{"text":"This restaurant is on the first floor of the Hampton Inn downtown Madison and I am staying here this week for a business trip. I decided to check it out for dinner this evening. The service was very subpar! First I had to remind my waiter about lemons for my water which he totally forgot. Then after waiting for over 30 l minutes I asked him about my food after he passed my table 20 times. He said he didn't know why it was taking so long but the kitchen appears backed up. The restaurant had gotten busy by that point so obviously their staff was not prepared.  Once he finally brought my cobb salad, I asked for extra dressing and by the time the server brought it over I had finished the salad and was ready for my bill. I still tipped him but I put a note on the bill voicing my dissatisfaction with the service. I know restaurants get swamped but at the same time waiters should at least make the patrons aware of a possible delay and not wait until we have to ask you what's going on. That's customer service 101."}
{"text":"This restaurant was phenomenal! My wife and I ate here while visiting Madison and we couldn't have been more pleased. Service was great, food was excellent, and they do very unique housemate donuts. Definitely stop by if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Conveniently connected to our hotel: Hampton Inn & Suites (highly recommended).  Got the the farmers hash: sweet potato, brussel sprouts, parsnips & onions. One of the healthier options on the menu and it was pretty standard. Nothing note-worthy. They're also known for their donuts - I got a mint chocolate donut. The frosting was tasty, but the donut itself was mediocre, nothing noteworthy. I was looking for the 'melt-in-your-mouth' feeling.  Our server was amazing and super nice. It was not that busy around 9, but 30 minutes later it was packed. Go early."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the lemon blueberry pancakes and the chicken with biscuit :) Moreover, they forgot to bring my me poached egg in time, but they were kind enough to deduce this from the bill. I appreciated his gesture."}
{"text":"I loved the atmosphere of this place. On top of that the food was amazing. I got the Buttermilk Pancakes with strawberries and a side of eggs. The pancakes were absolutely delicious and gigantic, and I couldn't finish them despite wanting to.   I would definitely recommend this place to anybody who loves breakfast food!"}
{"text":"Okay,  so I'm literally typing this review as we are being served.  I could not wait to tell you how amazing this brunch place is! Mostly because the service is phenomenal.  We are seating at the bar and every single bartender here has been incredibly friendly and attentive. Checked on us like three times even though this place was popping!   If you must know about the food.  We had the the pork carnitas hash - delicioso! Not greasy and, of course,  very flavorful. To drink I had a cappuccino with almond milk.  Best one I have ever had.  If you are lactose intolerant,  you know the struggle.   Anyway,  go here.  If you're gluten free and lactose intolerant,  you're in good hands."}
{"text":"Grabbed breakfast with my daughter on my birthday here. Waitress was very attentive and the food was pretty good. Hard to mess up pancakes, egg and bacon. Definitely a little pricier than most breakfast places, we are talking $15 for pancakes, eggs, bacon when most place at most would charge $10. House made doughnuts are pretty good as well."}
{"text":"Local favorite breakfast spot with inventive menu items as well as classics. Pretty happy with the carnitas hash i got, which also included a good amount of fluffy scrambled eggs. This place probably beats any other hotel breakfast place"}
{"text":"Ironically, I still haven't had any of their brunch items yet, but I definitely will (I promise!).  Aside from that, they have some delish sweets.  From their fried chicken and donut balls to their individual donuts (the caramel and oreo cookie ones were nom), you will be sure to find something to satisfy your sweet tooth.  The servers here are also so friendly and fun! Big props to them for letting us use their space to shoot a video!  Oh, and they make a mean margarita. While not particularly strong in alcohol content, it more than makes up for it with its strong taste.   One part I didn't really get was that this place seems like it would be a very family-centric stop, especially with its name and the type of food they offer. However, they've got a full bar with bottles of alcohol lined up against the wall, which would make you think otherwise. Oh well.  Anyways, look out for an update later when I've had a chance to try the rest of their menu!"}
{"text":"The first time I tried this place was when my girlfriend from Tucson came to visit Madison for a week. We went twice! It was so good! The first time, we were seated immediately and had top-notch service. The second time was on a Sunday morning and we had about an hour wait (but it's worth it).   We shied away from the Mexican-American dishes (being that we are from California and Arizona) but I thought it was interesting that they offer them.  Highly recommend but not if you're in a rush."}
{"text":"This place lived up to the hype!!! I have been waiting so long to come eat here. We finally made it today. Loved the service- food was amazing as well. Pork carnitas was the best. The portion was huge.   We also tried the lemon ricotta pancake. Less of a lemon flavor, more of blueberry compote. The pancake was fluffy and the ricotta whip was delicious. This was huge. We couldn't even finish half of it. Next time- this should be ordered for 2 people together.   We also tried their old fashioned donut and ginger bread donut. We must return to try more of their donuts.   All in all, we loved the place. Parking is not easy to find but it was worth every effort in getting to it. We will sure visit again soon."}
{"text":"Never disappoints. I bring everyone I know here because everyone always leaves pleasantly satisfied.  Known for the savory French toast, which is solid, but oh so much more awaits your taste buds.   Breakfast burrito (be sure to add chicken), spring break bowl, hangover omelette, chicken fried brussel sprouts and breakfast nachos! All the basics with a perfect little twist.  I'm not really a donut person but you'd be a fool if you didn't get a homemade creation. Order one or two for the table!  Lastly, their breakfast drinks are all delicious-mimosas, bellinis, the Bloody Mary is beautiful, but they need to bring back the booze bags! Nothing says let's day drink like starting in the morning with an adult \"Capri sun\"."}
{"text":"I've been to Brunch club numerous times and always enjoyed it. Today was even better! I Went to brunch with 5 friends on New Year's Day around 2pm. Was told it was going to be a 50min wait, was only 20!!  John was our server and he rocks! Fantastic drinks. Bloodies, mimosas, coffee, boozy smoothies and juleps were all ordered and enjoyed. We ordered ALOT of food. Chicken fried Brussels were perfection. Mac and cheese for the table = best idea ever. Savory toast had been a table favorite but some ventured out to the Benedict, cyc omelet, chicken and biscuit, and grits. YUM TO ALL! No complaints on anything at all."}
{"text":"This review it not just a 5 star review but I want everyone yo know the is on of the best meals I've ever had. Every course deserved a picture but the pure excitement of the food did not allow. The only reason I'm writing this is because I need to tell some one, any one.... This place earned a 10 of 10. The manager was friendly, accommodating and just trying hard. We had out meal at the bar. The bartender was friendly and made one of the best old-fashioned I've ever had. The chef was amazing talented. Amazingly!"}
{"text":"Free parking?! Wish i did my research.  I walked in freezing from my walk and was immediately seated.  My server (Ben) was fabulous, he suggested two different teas out of their plethora of loose leaf- i chose his suggestion of Lemon ginger.  This actually tasted closer to lemongrass white tea so if you're not a fan- stay away from that.  I tried the breakfast bar - roti with chicken.  This take on the breakfast burrito is a great idea.  It had a rocket style salad on top to give it a little more savory. While tasty I would try it again with shrimp.  I closed my meal with Peppermint Patty Warm Up (tasty drink with Peppermint schnapps).  I will come back again and try another dish.  I'd recommend coming and go for breakfast regardless of the time of day!"}
{"text":"Great, quick service. A fun atmosphere and wonderful cocktails. The best Bellini was great! There is a good variety on the menu and I'll definitely be back for my next breakfast (or lunch or dinner) in Madison!"}
{"text":"This whole day was a blur, but I walked there on a Sunday after we got about a foot of snow - I'm glad I made the trek! I knew I wanted breakfast and it was about 3pm, so a place that serves it all day is certainly the place for me! I went 'Merican Style for eggs, bacon, potatoes and toast. Bassett Street Brunch Club is a place that instead of giving you little jam packets for your toast, gives you a jar of fresh jam (not used to seeing that - but makes the spread that much better).  I sat up at the bar for my meal and found both bartenders to be friendly and attentive. From what I could tell, sitting in the booths looked cozy and comfortable. Looking around at what other patrons ordered has me excited to come back and try other options on the menu.  I also enjoyed the decor, very appealing to the eye and has a classic/retro feel. I could see catching a sports game there too, they have plenty of flat screens (technically not fitting in that retro theme, but hey, can't hurt to have a touch of modern)."}
{"text":"5Stars for Creativity and Presentation. 5Stars for Ingredients! But execution deeply falls short. So close, but something is desperately missing in all the dishes we tried. Perhaps for college students this is great, but overall it lacks so much!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite brunch spots in Madison! Bassett Street Brunch club does a great job of putting a new spin on brunch favorites like French toast and pancakes  (to name a very select few). Their menu is bustling with options, and breakfast is served all day! Some of my favorite entrees include the savory French toast and the Biscuits and Gravy. One thing I wasn't a huge fan of was their side of breakfast potatoes-- not anything extraordinary.   The drinks are also fun and delicious. The orange dreamsicle screwdriver is one of my favorites from there. The pumpkin horchata latte is a fall favorite for me. Also, the doughnuts are literally thick spheres of deliciousness with rotating flavors. Yum!   This place is popular, so the waits can be long. You have to come in to the restaurant to put your name on the wait list, so the best way to work around that is to call in and check the wait time. Once your migrate over, you can put your name on the list. The staff is extremely friendly and accommodating. Though the waits are long, they're well worth it! Plus, you can chill out in the lobby of the adjoining Hampton Inn and sip on free coffee and tea.   Overall, I would highly recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"The menu is fairly hit-or-miss, with some items being excellent and others being downright terrible (avoid the salted caramel donuts unless you *reeeeally* like salt or the bananas foster french toast if you don't want a plate of cloyingly sweet goop). Prices are fair for the area and the portions provided, and the service is perfectly serviceable, even with the constant crowd this place seems to draw."}
{"text":"Came here for bunch while staying the weekend in Madison. With such great reviews and brunch being in the name I thought they would knock it out of the park.  I started with a vanilla glazed donut and it was excellent. It wasn't a puff of sugar like what you find at Dunkin' nor was it cakey. Instead it was just this fantastic and somehow light texture with a great flavor. An excellent beginning.  For my main dish I did the chicken and biscuits. The biscuit and gravy were great, but the chicken was rubbery. Even though the salad was flavorful (particularly the nice, crisp apples), if the chicken isn't up to the snuff it's hard to feel like it was a good experience.  That being said the server was very nice. They were out of water glasses for about 15 minutes which is strange, but she was very cheery and explained the situation well so no big deal there.  Overall I'd give the place a second try and just stay away from the savory dishes."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner while staying in town.  I typically shy away from hotel restaurants, but this is the new breed.  Hotel restaurant run by local restaurant group that knows what they are doing.  Definitely would come back here on my next Madison trip.  I had a vegetable hash for dinner that was a huge portion and a very healthy option.  Wife had their chicken nachos which were pretty delicious.  My only negative on the place is the nachos could have been fried better.  The fixings with the nachos were delicious.    Friendly service, good value, great food."}
{"text":"The food is always very good; have never been disappointed. Drinks are hit-and-miss. The service, on the other hand, can be quite frustrating. Be prepared for staff forgetting to bring water or menus to your table after you've been seated. Chatting with coworkers around the middle register is a core value at BSBC. It's always helpful to walk in with the confidence to snap your fingers in the air or cough loudly until they finally realize you exist!"}
{"text":"9am on a Wednesday, had 3 mimosas with my breakfast, since we were on a mini-vacay. They were half-off anyway, so took advantage of that I got the vanilla sprinkles donut to share with my daughter and my husband had the maple bacon donut before we got our main meals. They were amazing! I ordered The Hangover, to go with my booze, and it was so good. It's a ham and cheese omelet and it's perfect. I will definitely want to come back, especially before 10am and get those half-off mimosas!"}
{"text":"We've had BSBC on our list for ages. Today was finally the day! Going at 8am on a summer Sunday turned out well. We got a table outside right away, and our server, Max, was amazing! It's hard when you want every single thing on the menu.... I ordered the Cyc Omelette, my date ordered the  Hot to Tot Burrito, and we shared the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes. I ran inside to see if I could add a protein to my omelette, and I ended up getting it with their shredded chicken (the kind that comes on the huevos rancheros). YUM! My omelette was awesome! I typically don't like onions, and they were in the fajita-type veggies in my omelette, but they weren't bad and easy to pick out. I loved the chicken on it! My date's burrito was yummy too. Those pancakes, though. We each had one bite and just looked at each other and sighed. SO GOOD! Definitely recommend. Can't wait to try more!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like it - but yeah, it was a meh experience.  Went for an early dinner so had a sandwich and fries and yeah - nothing special.  Not a place I need to go back to."}
{"text":"We love this place. Ate here for breakfast 2 days in a row. The food is excellent and it has a fun vibe. We were seated immediately at a booth then next day at the bar. Both times our food came quickly. There is outdoor seating but currently a lot of construction on Bassett and Johnson so eating outside would be extremely loud and dusty. We loved (almost) everything we ordered. The Bassett Breakfast Sandwich was fabulous. I will definitely get this again next time. It had pesto, egg, bacon (option), cheese on an everything bagel. Soooo good! Comes w a side of potatos or greens. Go for the greens, they have a lite dressing on them. Also had the Savory French Toast. I didn't like that as much. The bread is soaked in a Parmesan and herb batter that makes the French toast remind me of stuffing at Thanksgiving. If you get this ask for 2 eggs and no hollandaise sauce. My sister got the Cyc Omelette both mornings. She couldn't get enough of it. Their donuts are not to be missed.  Made fresh daily and have gourmet toppings like a glazed donut w bacon on top. We took a box of 4 home. YUM! They have a full service bar - many people ordered Bloody Mary's that looked very good and homemade. Also saw them making up mimosas. They serve breakfast all day but have regular food too which sounded very good. Well done, Bassett Brunch Club. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite brunch spots in Madison.   I try to diversify my palette so I don't go over and over but everything I've gotten here is great. I love the Banana Foster French toast for sweet and Farmer's Hash for savory.   I thought their donuts were just an afterthought to compliment their modern diner experience but now with more donut competition in Madison, I'm curious to try them.  The Savory French toast dipped in parmesan with the works will be my next order.   This place really has something for everyone from sweet to savory which is why there is will be an hour long wait here on the weekends, but otherwise there's almost no wait. You can also order a Colectivo coffee from the bar and wait in the huge lobby of the Hampton Inn in the comfy sofas to catch up with friends."}
{"text":"Service, drinks, and appetizers all deserve 5-stars! I stopped in after work for their happy hour with friends. The specials they offer on beer, wine, and a selection of their cocktails is well worth a visit. The Bloody Mary, my cocktail of choice for the evening, had a great kick to it and the celery was a cool sidekick to the zesty drink. The pickled cucumbers were a little less fantastic as a garnish and were cut too thin to hold any weight. The fried chicken and a donut and fried Brussel sprouts both made a regular Thursday evening all the better. I opted to do breakfast for dinner and ordered eggs Benedict. Sadly, the eggs Benedict were really disappointing. The eggs were slightly under, the sauce and/or pesto had lemon zest which really dominated the palate, and the side of arugula seemed like an afterthought. Drinks and appetizer (4-stars) + eggs Benedict (2-stars) = 3 overall stars for the Bassett Street Brunch Club."}
{"text":"After sampling many brunch spots in Madison I would have to say this one is my favorite. Tasty donuts, great coffee, and a wide selection of brunch options. Be ready to wait during peak times as this place fills up fast. I have always had adequate to top notch service and it has always been worth the wait."}
{"text":"So, I officially declare my intention to create a \"school for servers\" and to offer free classes at Food Fight restaurants.  I say this not only because I love eating out, but because I proudly worked my way through parts of high school and college as a waitress in Chicago and SF.  Come ON Food Fight.  How long should it take to turn over a table?  I watched one woman return to wipe down a booth THREE times over the course of fifteen minutes while a line of 12 people waited to be seated.  How hard is it to bring a brunch order correctly the first time?  How many times should someone have to ask for a coffee refill before receiving one?  The servers are well-intentioned, but don't have a lick of training.  I honestly didn't even think about the food because the service was so bad.  I think Food Fight has officially outgrown its capacity to manage its restaurants.  Too bad."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place alot! The atmosphere coming in is exciting, welcoming, and all around nice. We got seated very promptly and then greeted by our server Alisa -- who was super duper awesome. She would get 5 stars alone, but alas these reviews are due to a culmination of different factors so i'll give you the low down.   1) Donuts: Fresh made, I had the apple pie special. They should really warm them up before they serve it. While the flavor was okay, the filling was great which salvaged the entirety of it. It was just okay and I don't need to order it again.  2) $3 mimosas before 10am. AWESOME 3) I got the carnitas hash-- meat was super flavorful, salsa had the perfect kick, but the potatoes, onions and bell peppers were all super bland and made up a large portion of the meal verses the meat. Egg over medium was cooked perfectly. 4) Cheddar chive biscuit--DELISH. a definite get.  5) homemade strawberry jam- also very good, but can almost feel like you're eating the strawberry topping for a sundae.  6) service-- top notch and loving it.   For the atmosphere and service it was great. 5 stars. for the food and flavor 3. Its a good brunch place to start if you haven't had brunch in madison, but overall I wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"Brunch Club is among the more solid breakfast/brunch places in Madison. They have some tasty twists on breakfast classics, good coffee, and very popular donuts with unique flavors. They aren't my favorite, but I seem to be in the minority with that opinion. Waits are longer at peak times on weekends, but that is a good time to eat at the counter.   The restaurant has a contemporary take on retro decor with the whimsical artwork of Eric Joyner featuring Robots and Donuts. There is one entrance to the restaurant from the street and another from the Hampton.   Hampton usually offers complementary parking to restaurant guests, and that is somewhat irritating when you arrive only to find that parking is only for hotel guests on that day. It may be to discourage abuse of the parking for nearby events, but it only seems to be an issue for me when there is inclement weather. Honestly, I keep going back, so it can't be that terrible."}
{"text":"So delicious, this place has everything you would want from a brunch spot. They put a fun spin on a lot of classic brunch options, which keeps it interesting. I came on a Saturday around lunch time and had to wait about 20 minutes, which is not too bad for such a popular place. I got a horchata latte, and shared cheese curbs, pork carnitas hash, lemon ricotta pancakes, and The Hangover omelette with some friends. Everything was delicious and came in large portions. The lemon ricotta pancakes especially were amazing - the dollop of ricotta added the perfect slightly sweet and creamy touch. There are so many options for both sweet and savory that anyone would be able to find something they want, and there's a pretty good coffee and drinks menu too. On my wish list for next time (and beyond): pot roast and egg sandwich, chicken and a biscuit, farmer's hash, toastest with the mostest, savory french toast."}
{"text":"We happen to be staying at the Hampton Inn and had people recommend this restaurant.  I'm usually really skeptical of restaurant attached to hotels but this breakfast/brunch restaurant was really good.  I believe I had the second best eggs benedict ever here.  I only wish I could've eaten all of the eggs benedict.  Their portion size was more than enough.  My husband got the hash which was the best hash I've ever had.  We got donuts which were not your traditional sweet cakey but more of a sweet bread donut.  If we lived in Madison I would come here weekly.  Also had great service from Jenna."}
{"text":"Decent spot. I was not terribly impressed with the huevos rancheros or the chicken and a biscuit dishes. I found the huevos rancheros to be a little lacking in flavor and the chicken to be a little dry.  The staff were super friendly. They serve coffee from Colectivo, which I like. It'so pretty great that they serve breakfast all day. This probably would not be my first choice for brunch but it's an okay option near campus or if you are looking for breakfast food in the evening."}
{"text":"Good breakfast spot in Madison. We also went here for lunch, but I think they do better breakfast. I ordered scrambled eggs, potatoes, sausage, and an English muffin with a coffee. Very good. I also recommend the donuts that come out fresh through out the day."}
{"text":"I really loved this place!! I want to come back more in the near future! Honestly I don't understand why it's not more packed on a Saturday night. Had the donut fried chicken appetizer and it was sweet and savory! Yumm. Followed by a super juicy burger. The menu is really creative, but not too off the wall where you're scared to try something new. I wish I was in the mood for breakfast at night bc so many things looked great! Can't wait to come back! Cool bar and night vibe too!"}
{"text":"My husband, brother-in-law, and our three children ate brunch on a Sunday. We knew it would be busy, so we sent my single brother-in-law to wait in line.  He was quoted a 30 minute wait. Most restaurants overestimate their wait time, but in this case the wait at least 40 minutes.  There was basically no waiting area, so luckily by the time my husband I arrived with our chaotic crew we only waited about 10 minutes.  I was surprised at how small the restaurant is, but I like the decor and all the natural light.  Perfect for taking pictures of the food like a good Yelper/Instagrammer! ;)  The staff (all college kids, not surprisingly) were all very friendly and accommodating.  I have read a lot of complaints about parking. We just parked in the Southeast Campus Ramp (next to the Fluno Center) and walked a block. It was not a big deal.  We started off the meal with their \"famous\" donuts. My husband and I each chose a daily special - a donut filled with lemon curd - and my kids shared a chocolate donut with coconut.  The lemon curd donut was a hit. It had an unusual taste and texture...very different than your typical donut. The chocolate one was a bit of a letdown. It was kind of dry, and neither of my kids finished their half...which says a lot because my kids are obsessed with donuts.    I am not a bloody drinker by trade (Worcestershire doesn't usually jive with my vegetarian ways) but I tried some of my husband's. We both agreed that, while it was visually lovely, it was just missing something. Too much celery salt, not enough bite.  Though I'm not an experienced bloody drinker, in my opinion, it was just not good.  For my meal, I chose the \"Old Skool, Re-do.\" This was the best part of my dining experience. I admit, I am sucker for anything with tomato, mozzarella, and basil...but I've had the good and I have the bad. This was the good. Excellent flavor, fresh ingredients, tasty mozz, the bread was perfectly toasted, and it all melded together  in the way that a sandwich should!  It was very, very yummy.  My husband chose the \"American Style\" which is a basic breakfast with eggs/meat/potatoes/toast.  He's not very exciting.  His assessment?  It was alright. Nothing special.  (Here is where I pointed out to him that he didn't ORDER anything special!) However, this meal (eggs/meat/potatoes/toast) is HIS old standby, and like me, he's had the good and the bad. This was the just okay.     In the end, I would really like to go back to Bassett and try some of the delicious sounding items on their menu. I wasn't super impressed, but I definitely want to go back to see if things improve. I was torn between rating them a 3 and a 4. I would say a solid 3.5...and to be kind, I will round up."}
{"text":"This place is receiving rave reviews, but I think there are much better brunch places in Madison: Lazy Jane's, Marigold, Graze...  I met a friend for brunch at 11:30 AM on a Saturday. A good hour wait and couldn't get a bartender's attention to order a drink. More bartenders, please! Once seated, we each ordered bellinis, but received mimosas. I like mimosas, and it was busy, so we didn't complain.  I ordered the burrito. It was fine, but not great. My friend ordered pancakes that arrived only half cooked. After waiting so long to get a table and order, we didn't have time to send anything back. We decided to share a donut. Again, it was fine but did not match the hype.  We split our checks and I discovered a few days later that the waitress ran my card through for both our meals. I discovered it in my credit card statement, and my friend looked at her statement to find she wasn't charged at all. This is a very amateur mistake!  This place does not match the hype for food or service. I will not make an effort to return."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have now gone here for brunch and dinner! It's so good, and plenty of gluten free options! Reasonably priced and both times we went, we didn't experience a wait.   For dinner we got the hangover and lemon ricotta pancakes (OH MY GOSH THESE ARE SO GOOD). And we got a donut for desert - this was our cheat day obviously. I enjoyed our dinner so much, next time I was in madison I insisted we go back.  For breakfast we got the Farmer's Hash  (I don't always like brussels sprouts in restaurants, but these were good!) and Breakfast Nachos (the sauce on these were greattt, it was hard to share). We got our eggs scrambled, because I don't like runny yolk!  I wish the parking was a little better, but I'm from Florida, so I'm not used to parking garages.  My boyfriend wants to come back for the cocktails, because everyone around us said they were good!"}
{"text":"We were staying at the DoubleTree about a block away.  This was a great spot for a Sunday morning breakfast.  We arrived right when they opened and our food came very quickly.  $3 mimosas before 10am was a bonus!  Very attentive wait staff and great food."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. It's walking distance from campus and downtown. The food is always incredible. My fiancé and I eat here probably once a week and we never have had a bad experience! Highly recommend the breakfast nachos or the pork carnitas hash. The Collectivo coffee is always fresh as well."}
{"text":"Very good food, friendly staff, fun atmosphere. It's typically pretty crowded and there can be a significant wait. We chose to sit at the \"bar\" area to avoid a long wait and we ended up being seated immediately. It was a good meal with a lot of things to look at in the restaurant. I wouldn't want to take my kids here, though, just because it'd be a nightmare to wait for a table with them. Otherwise, I'd go back again!"}
{"text":"We had the grilled cheese and tomato soup combo late Friday night to take to our room; terrible."}
{"text":"The horchata latte"}
{"text":"Kept passing this place in my truck, finally decided to take the wife for breakfast at dinner.  We both ordered pancakes. Hers the buttermilk, mine Lemon Ricotta. Divine on both counts. My pancakes had just a hint of lemon and was not drowned with blueberries. The Ricotta was a nice counterbalance to the sweetness. DO NOT USE MAPLE SYRUP ON THESE PANCAKES OR IT WILL SPOIL THEM.  The breakfast potatoes were thinly sliced and cooked perfectly - lightly crispy and seasoned nicely. Sausage was also very tasty.  Will return again. This place is way better than another nearby breakfast establishment downtown."}
{"text":"I was excited to finally check this place out last weekend!  But, whoa, what a nightmare of an experience.  I mean, look, based on this one experience (for me, two in my party had been here previously and thought it was okay) this experience as a whole absolutely deserves one star.  I guess I'm feeling generous, and assume this place is usually decent.  We sat outside, and the staff member mentioned she was training the person next to her.  That's fine, nothing unusual.  Everyone ordered, with my order being a simple Chicken & a Donut.  When our food arrived, they brought me the wrong item, a plate lacking any chicken or donut.  Whoops, sorry, we'll try that again.  Finally my correct order arrived, by which time everyone else was pretty much done eating.  And...the chicken was clearly not cooked through, as pink rawness was very visible on the plate.  This wasn't me being picky, everyone looked at the plate and new immediately something wan't quite right, including the two employees.  When I pointed to the uncooked chicken, the veteran server immediately reacted in an \"Oh, damn!\" sort of way, and quickly whisked it away.  More apologies, give us another chance.  Wait, didn't I order something pretty simple, like a fried piece of chicken...and....a donut??  When finally my correct order came out and no longer contained raw chicken/food poisoning, I was happy.  Yay, food that won't make me sick.  But gosh flipping damnit, the food wasn't that good!  The chicken was now overcooked and rather bland, and the donut was blah.  And there was a flip-ton of syrup on the plate, which was overkill with the sweetness.  So much sugar! Blah, meh, get me the hell out of here.  Everyone else got shrug of the shoulder \"it was fine\" food, but nothing that was getting raves.  The server and trainee were both apologetic and offered free drinks, to comp my meal and give coupons.  I said I'd take coupons, expecting Food Fight coupons.  I got expired coupons for Bassett Street Brunch Club, not Food Fight coupons - which was a bummer since I don't want to return to this place ever again.  There are a few Food Fight establishments that are decent, so given that BSBC sells Food Fight gift cards, I expected a simple request for Food Fight vouchers of some sort wasn't too much to ask.  This is the point in which typically a manager would walk out and say, \"Oh, hey, sorry for this horrible flipping experience, and gosh we are sorry for that food poising attempt, but by no means can we possibly charge your party anything.  Please let me get you all another drink, and don't worry about paying us a dime.\"  And that manager/owner/not-trainee would be smiling really big, and going out of there way to make sure all ended well.  I got coupons that say they expired on January 1, 2015.  Oh ignore that, we'll honor them next time.  Hm, er, okay.  These expired $5 Bassett Street Brunch Club coupons aren't going to be used by me.  And I'm certainly not sending anyone else in their direction.  So thanks, Food Fight, for a terrible experience and expired coupons, but..no thanks."}
{"text":"Awesome coffee and a crème brulee oatmeal with fruit cup that is killer. Plenty of quality food here. How do those Hampton Inn guests avoid this incredible temptation?!!?!?"}
{"text":"I was very pleased with my visit to the Bassett Street Brunch Club. We sampled the Friday fish fry, Mac and cheese, pancakes, their donuts and some other breakfast dishes, and they were all delicious. The service was excellent and if you go at the right time there's no wait. The only downfall is actually a strong suit: I guarantee it'll take you a long time to decide what to get because the menu is filled with a ton of dishes that look rreeaallllyy good. Overall, I would definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Eggs Benedicto was horrible. Very little prosciutto, tomatoes were not fresh and tasted rotten. When I told waiter he seemed bothered. Overall good restaurant but bad experience."}
{"text":"First I have to give a huge thank you to our server Mariah who was a wealth of knowledge and an exceptional server.  Thanks for making our first visit here so nice! & for that in & of itself will bring us back!  Food Excellent, Service Exceptional, ambiance fantastically Fun!  Go find out for your selves... You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I have been here twice and each time everything was great. I usually scope out bar seating (which is full service) because there is usually a wait. Have gotten bar seating each time in less than 5 min.   Food Menu is diverse and unique. Cocktail menu is the same way. Bourbon Buzz is one of my favorite brunch cocktails. Coffee and booze. Yum.   Food is always plated beautifully.   Servers are attentive and friendly.   Taste is delicious!!! Breakfast nachos avocado/honey ricotta toast  hangover omelette   Definitely give this place a try when you can!"}
{"text":"Visited today at noon. We had driven by a few times over the past months and seen the weekend lines out the door. We didn't stay at the hotel. We had to wait 45 minutes, but got a comfortable booth. I drank a Porter Joe since they have a couple beers on tap, but I just didn't like it. Husband's Bloody Mary was almost to his standards except it wasn't mixed well so first drink was all vodka. He didnt like the pickles because they were sweet. It looked like quite a few were having mimosas, but no super specials or Bloody Mary bar like at DLux. I had the Mother Clucker chicken on pretzel roll. Very good flavor! Slippery though because of one aioli sauce and then another blue cheese sauce. Neither sauce had overpowering flavor. Husband had the patty melt and the burger was ridiculously small for the size of the bread slices. Son had the pastrami Reuben and he liked it with the 1000 Island on the side. Not your normal sauerkraut--it's more like pickled purple cabbage. If we return, I would try a sweet breakfast item. I don't think their sandwiches are their strength especially considering the wait and price."}
{"text":"I ordered the avocado toast which was tasty.  However, there were neither roasted tomatoes nor caramelized onions on my plate as menu describes.  Ordered a plain horchata for my child and the bartender made me a horchata with a shot of espresso instead. Waiter was friendly, but we had to ask several times for water and a highchair. Husband ordered the chicken and biscuit which he reported was lacking flavor.  Free parking in hotel ramp is nice."}
{"text":"Slow even it was not packed at the time we were there. Small portion. Expensive. Not recommend.   Normally, from the outside, this place looks really good because it's always packed. But once you tried it you don't want to come back here again. At least me.  Updated 07/17/2016: I gave it another try. It seems the portion is bigger. I felt full after finishing the chicken and biscuits dish. The food was served quite fast. Great improvement!!! Oh, we ate at the bar because we had to wait for 1.5h if we want a table.  Everything is good except one thing. After we got our food. The server didn't give us the silverware sets. We had to wait until the bartender finishing all the drink orders for about 5mins before we can eat our food after we got them.  No big deal but it would be nice if we can start eating our food right away."}
{"text":"Pretty good place that's generally packed with students and guests from Hampton Inn among others. Due to it being right within Hampton Building, I ended up having a couple of meals here.   Tried their Spring Bowl Mix (perhaps the best thing on Menu) and Fish Fry (okay). Among drinks, I liked their mimosa more than Bloddy Mary, which was kinda sour for me.   Three star for food and one for staff."}
{"text":"I can't believe after all this time, I haven't reviewed Basset Street! I have easily been here 20 plus times, and have easily tried their entire menu. I love, love, LOVE Bassett Street. Anytime I'm in the mood for breakfast for dinner, this is out spot. I know I can get something super healthy if I want, and something not so healthy if I want, too. :) This past weekend I had their biscuits and gravy special, and it was amazing...a crumbled sausage and corn gravy that was to die for. My daughter had their pancakes with strawberries - their cakes are so good that they don't even need syrup! One of my favorite simple meals at Bassett is the Oatmeal Crème Brulee - it is so, so good and I don't feel like I ate two meals after having it. I also love the Shakshuka and the Savory French Toast. Their dinner is great, too - but I'm pretty guilty of mostly going after the breakfast....I would recommend anyone try this place at least once!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in town. The service is always great (especially Samuel!) and the food never disappoints. Only downfall is it's usually crazy busy for brunch. If you don't mind waiting and getting a boozy smoothie or a Bloody Mary this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Wife had the banana fosters French toast said it was amazing I had the Denver omelette in Wisconsin and it was good we had a donut probably should've ate it there and not taking it home but all was good service was good.  Will go back"}
{"text":"We had high hopes based on the reviews.  When we arrived we were told 25 minute wait. We headed to bar and sat down for drinks while we waited. We were not acknowledged at all while bartenders stood in front of us several times. After finally asking a woman to order some drinks, we decided we'd eat at bar. However, we ended up being seated at that moment. She brought the drinks to our table.  We waited for our server to come to our table for at least 10 minutes with no acknowledgement whatsoever. He was upbeat but we got no apology and he didn't follow up while we ate our only decent food.  Service bad, food ok, overall experience disappointing."}
{"text":"One of my absolute favorite brunch spots in Madison! Perfect for a quick hang over cure. My absolute favorite is the Chicken and a biscuit. The fried chicken on it is amazing with a perfectly made biscuit, and the gravy is divine! My other favorites: the Eggs Benedicto and the Spring break diet."}
{"text":"I had checked out Basset Street Brunch Club online before my boyfriend and I went to Madison, and it was the perfect place to go our first morning there.  After getting up late and walking around campus for a couple of hours, we knew this place would still serve us brunch around 1pm :)  I was a little skeptical when we arrived and noticed the restaurant is located in the bottom of a hotel, but shouldn't have been.  Everything was awesome!  The indoors were nice and comfortable, and our server was great.  I believe his name was Lindberg (I remember since it was such a cool name).  He was prompt and friendly without hovering.  The best part was the food.  I got the savory french toast which was one of the best breakfasts I had in a long time.  The hollandaise was delicious, and the combination of bacon, an over easy egg, and the side arugula salad was perfect.  I wish I could have this dish delivered to my apartment every weekend.  My boyfriend enjoyed his breakfast burrito although I think he was slightly less excited about his breakfast than I was.  The coffee was delicious, and the entire meal came in just over $30 without tip.    I would definitely make a point to come back if I'm ever back in Madison just to get the savory french toast!"}
{"text":"After reading the rave reviews online we decided to drive the thirty minutes to Madison to dine at this establishment for brunch on a Sunday. After all the word brunch is in the name and the menu and reviews made it seem like an exciting choice for the family The web page said that we could park in the ramp of the adjoining hotel. However when we arrived, there was a sign that clearly said that we could only get through the gate with a room card from the hotel. It certainly made no mention of any exceptions for patrons of the restaurant so we had to find other parking, which was rather difficult to say the least. So upon walking in the door of this place we already had invested over an hour of our time. I walked straight up to the hostess and asked for a table for three as I normally would at a restaurant that DOES NOT ACCEPT RESERVATIONS!!!! I was straightened out right quickly by the young smiling hostess who proclaimed rather glibly and oddly victoriously that the wait would be more than an hour and a half. I looked about the place and I noticed a few people here and there obviously waiting their turn to be seated, but by no means could I count anywhere near the amount of people necessary to warrant the excitement in the hostesses voice when she held up her chin and proudly announced \" one hour and a half!\" I looked and noticed that people were dining at the bar so I inquired as to the possibility of seating at the bar. \"That seating is first come first serve only!\" Well isn't that the same as any other seating In a place that does not doesn't take reservations?  I turned to the hostess and smiled. After a quick polite bow I relayed to her that we would not be dining there on this day and I turned and exited with my family in tow I regret to say that I cannot now nor will I in the future be able to offer a review of the fine fare supposedly served here. Because I simply will not risk the trip down to the city to find out about this place ever again. And I caution that neither should you lest you live close by and have plenty of time on your hands. But do not feel bad for us as we ended up going someplace else rather impromptu and had one of the most fulfilling culinary experiences of our lives. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Horchatta latte is amazing! The everything pretzels are so good (I get them with the fondue cheese instead of the truffle cheese) The donuts leave something to be desired. They are too bread-like. Great atmosphere. Okay service. Some of the staff are sweet and attentive others are mediocre."}
{"text":"Crowded. Trendy - they have food, so they meet the primary requirement for a restaurant. Other than that it was not a  mind-blowing experience. It was more like a Food Fight restaurant. Wait, is this a Food Fight restaurant?"}
{"text":"Saturday morning brunch around 10 am, minimal wait, great \"Brunch Club Cool-Tails\", great ambience, and outstanding eggs Benedict."}
{"text":"Service was not great and food was underwhelming. I ordered the shakshuka brunch dish which came with two poached eggs. Both of which were very much over cooked. Disappointed.  The one good thing, we were told it would be an hour wait for a table but it was actually only 30 min."}
{"text":"The food has been hit and miss, but never great. The one consistent is absolutely terrible service. It feels like you enter an alternate universe where time doesn't exist."}
{"text":"Wow!  I hesitated eating here, fearing another run-of-the-mill bland American-style breakfast.  I also didn't have high expectations of Bassett due to its being attached to a hotel.  Well, let me tell you, this is the best breakfast I have had in a long time.  If I had more time in Madison, I would have eaten here on multiple occasions, and not just for breakfast.  The young man serving us at the bar was prompt and professional.  Prices very reasonable for the amount and quality of food.  I loved the subtly-pickled onions that were in my egg sandwich; they were a delicious addition.  This is a must try."}
{"text":"Solid food, great variety. They have gluten free options too. I loved their horchata latte, super yum. If you want breakfast at 9PM, this is your place! The food wasn't super flavorful, but the atmosphere, the service and presentation was on point. I might come back if I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"Do not order any espresso drinks here. I have just had the worst Americano ever. It was undrinkable.  I had a bad feeling about my Americano when I saw the bartender poured espresso from a squeeze bottle. The over extraction was so bad that I could not taste any flavors. The bitterness was sickening."}
{"text":"It's in the lobby of a hotel, which is a tough place to start for ambiance. Breakfast was average, but high priced. It was hard to get quick service, despite being very few people there.  Won't go back, didn't hate it."}
{"text":"Love this place! It is so much fun and there are a bunch of options. They also have great cocktails and coffee. It is normally like an hour wait for brunch, but there is always long waits for brunching in Madison and at this restaurant you can get a donut and coffee and sit in the really nice new hotel while you wait and the hostess will come and get you when your table is ready. This is one of my favorite restaurants in downtown Madison."}
{"text":"Food is delicious and creative! Bloodys are very tasty! Coffee is delicious. Fun place for brunch!"}
{"text":"Basset Street is my new favorite place for a late-night snack or an early morning breakfast. They serve breakfast fare all day, and I can report that the breakfast classics (eggs, bacon, sausage, french toast, etc) are all excellent. They also have an extensive lunch/dinner menu, and they serve Wisconsin-based Collectivo coffee. I've had their chicken sandwich, which I can report was actually really good. It came with fresh veggies, a pretzel bun and delicious tater tots, and (as far as chicken sandwiches go) it was one of the best I've ever had.   The staff I've encountered have all been terrific. I was dining during the late night once, and a bartender offered all of us free donuts (since they were going to throw them away).  They have a full (and expensive) bar, with a modest selection of Wisconsin craft beers and a wide array of homemade cocktails. Unfortunately, everybody seems to know about the Basset Street Brunch Club, so weekend breakfasts are always packed. Just bring your patience, and you'll have a great experience."}
{"text":"I'm staying at the Hampton Inn where this restaurant is. They serve breakfast all day and night. But I opted for their curry noodles with shrimp. They were delicious and spicy with jalapenos. The food was fresh and they did justice to a Thai dish even though it's mainly an American cuisine restaurant."}
{"text":"We came here for brunch on a day trip to Madison and we were not disappointed! There was a short wait but they seated us pretty quickly. Our waitress was friendly, available, and super helpful.   I got the savory French toast. It was supremely fantastic and I would eat it every day if I could.  My boyfriend got the carnitas hash and he said it had the best potatoes he's ever had in his life.   We got donuts as well and they were warm and fresh and phenomenal.   The only complaint is that our brunch drinks weren't the best...but they were creative and we drank them anyways.   The robot/donut decor is a little strange but I totally dug. 100% would want to come back here if I'm ever back in Madison!"}
{"text":"Love the variety of food here! have come back here at least 10 times with my friends for brunch and mimosas. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a casual spot for any meal. Great drinks and beautiful warm environment with friendly staff!"}
{"text":"MMMMM yes. Horchata iced coffee was incredible. Service was excellent. I had a hard time deciding what to eat because there were so many appetizing options. I had some breakfast carnitas mix that was decent but there were too many potatoes in the ratio of meat/veggies. The flavor of the carnitas was great, though. Wasn't really into the biscuit as it was a bit dry and crumbly. I would go back for sure, but as far as favorite breakfasts go, Short Stack is my pick for my week in Madison."}
{"text":"We stopped to Bassett Street Brunch club on a Friday morning for breakfast.  We had just flown into Madison so we were starving and were delighted to find seats at the bar right away.  The bartender was attentive and was very interested in helping us not only enjoy breakfast but also our trip to Madison.    The food we had was great.  I had the savory French toast and K had an omelet.  The good came out fast, was hot and delicious.  We also had a donut that was fine but not really anything to write home about.  We tried to come again that weekend but the line was too long so I recommend coming early or prepared to eat."}
{"text":"Busy, tasty place near UW.  At 37, I was older than most of the clientele but the food was quite good.  I think my potatoes were a little undercooked but nothing to whine about.  Service was very attentive, too.  All told, a very good brunch place for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"I ordered a dozen donuts to pick for breakfast for a group of girls celebrating a bachelorette party in Madison. The manager (who was the NICEST manager I've ever spoken to) called me the following day and let me know that they may not have the exact flavors I ordered but would do the best they could to accommodate my order. While I was on the phone l I told the manager it was for a bachelorette party and I jokingly said they could get \"creative\" in the donut designs. Well not only did they make all the flavors we requested, Greg, the baker, designed the donuts to look like, let's just say \"Long Johns\" for the bachelorette festivities. The donuts were incredible and so was the service. Couldn't say enough positive things about this place!"}
{"text":"First time here and won't be my last! LOVE that they use Collectivo Coffee. My vanilla latte with almond milk was delightful. For breakfast I had their All American. Poached eggs, bacon, breakfast potatoes and thick cut multigrain bread. Poached eggs were a little more done then I would have liked, but I'm not too picky so I rolled with it. Bacon was sooo good. Had a delicious maple after taste. Don't forget to grab a donut to go!   FYI for parking...make sure to park in the Hampton Inn. Bring your ticket inside to breakfast because they will validate your parking. Didn't realize that until we sat down and read it on their menu."}
{"text":"My sister and I shared a doughnut, and after that I didn't want to order anything else! haha. we both ordered coffee and drank cup after cup. Really good brew! As an entree we enjoyed the breakfast bur-roti. Worth it! Go as soon as you can."}
{"text":"This place was both interesting innovative yet somehow familiar.  Many of their dishes were new takes from things I've grown up eating like the Mac Attack, is obviously Mac and cheese but they incorporate butternut squash, onions, and spinach in a subtle yet flavorful way.  The donuts were out of this world, we stayed in the area for 5 days and had donuts for breakfast 3 days, just so fresh and so dreamy, the maple candied bacon and the apple pie donuts were my favorite.  The prices were quite reasonable and the overall selection was surprising.  A must for brunch in downtown mad town!"}
{"text":"If you are driving you can park at the hotel. They will give you a reimbursement ticket. Eggs Benedicto were eggcellent. Perfectly poached. The hollandaise sauce had a strong lemon flavor so if you don't like lemon I'd skip it. There were no complaints from the other side of the table who order a generous portion of bananas fosters French toast. Very generous. Definitely going back to try the farmers mash and/or the donuts. Service was quick and friendly. Very clean establishment."}
{"text":"I have been here several times and we (party of 6) come more for the atmosphere than the food or definitely the service.    Last night the food again was ok- a variety of things got ordered and 1 out of 6 finished their food and none took any home.  I made the mistake of ordering a decaf coffee - I use cream - none got delivered with the coffee and had to ask twice - it arrived 'later'.  as it turned out the joke was on me because the coffee wasn't decaf.    1 of the party ordered the key lime pie for dessert and apple showed up - meh."}
{"text":"Want a shot of Jack with your omelet or a beer? Order it here and no one will bat an eye. All sorts of coffee drinks and other stuff as well. A Spotted Cow went well with my pancakes on a weekday last week. Lots of counter space if you are by yourself and don't need a table. Good friendly service but the food is a little slow coming out. People watching is good so the time went fast. All age groups are represented and the turnover is fairly fast. It is a winner in the downtown brunch type restaurants. Some street parking but you will probably end up in a parking ramp on busy days. Who cares if it is a Food Fight place? It is well run and the food is good."}
{"text":"I've been here twice when staying in the area. The first time I had the pork carnitas hash and a side of grits. Both were awesome, the grits mixed well with the hash for a second to go meal. Round 2, I went for the eggs benedicto.  It was delicious. One of the best versions of eggs benedict I've had. I also ordered the pad Thai with tofu to go. This was a huge fail. The noodle were overly soggy and bland. The tofu wasn't fried or sautéed,  they basically just threw it on top as is. The take away from all this is stick to breakfast.  They excel at breakfast."}
{"text":"They have plenty of menu options and the fresh donuts taste great too. Good value for the serving sizes as well"}
{"text":"PHENOMENAL Brunch Experience. After hearing about a 40 minute wait, we were comforted by mimosas and ended up getting seated in 20. The DONUTS were to die for. Specifically the Maple BACON Donut (10/10) and Vanilla glazed. The CREMÈ BRÛLÉE Oatmeal was DELICIOUS. French toast, pancakes, fresh fruit, will be back. 10/10 Quality. 10/10 Atmosphere. 10/10 Creativity.   -A&R"}
{"text":"Yes, like most breakfast/brunch places in Madison, this place is a madhouse on the weekends. Three of us shows up a little before 9 on Sunday (they open at 8) and already at 45 minute wait. Good news is just as I was getting a little woozy, we were seated and in a flash there were doughnuts! Maple glazed doughnuts to be exact. The icing and bacon was delish. The doughnut itself was only fair.   I'm not much of a breakfast person so I was delighted to see plenty of non-egg centric and/or savory dishes. I opted for the savory French toast. It was great. Subtle Parmesan flavor with 2 strips of bacon and hollandaise drizzle. The side arugula salad was awesome and I'm by no means a veggie girl.   My companions had the chicken and biscuit and the carnitas hash. Both thoroughly enjoyed their meals. I'm a lover of both fried chicken and sausage gravy but I'm a bit of a traditionalist. The gravy was kinda weird and had sweet corn in it. Not my thing but my friend loved it. We also had a side of the grits which came covered in cheddar, green onions and bacon. Amazing!! Excellent grits!!  They also have a unique selection of cocktails. We tried the spiked horchata and the bourbon buzz. Yum on both accounts!"}
{"text":"Great experience over all... Only reason for 4 instead of 5 are: didn't love the bloody mix, something just didn't speak to me or the wife, also quoted us a 90 minute wait and for some reason we decided to chance it and were sat in 30 mins.    Other than that... Fan-freakin-tastic.  Wifey got standard breakfast food (someone on this planet please learn how to make over medium eggs)... I have the Biscuits and Gravy special which was incredible and we split the.... Wait for it... Creme Brûlée Oatmeal with fresh berries which was out of control good.  Great coffee and really reasonable prices.  Decor is great, theme is great, service was better as we got deeper... Host / manager guy 7/10, bartender 8/10... Server 9.5/10... I would and will return next time I'm in Madison... Great job... Want a Milwaukee Franchise?"}
{"text":"Okay, so 3.5 would be more like it.  The good? The food. The bad? The service.  Let me first start by saying, brunch is stupid. I like breakfast, and I like lunch, but brunch is just unnecessary to me. Even though brunch is in the name of the restaurant I felt that this was a Madison restaurant that must be tried.  Ordered: -Chai coconut donut and Chocolate old Fashioned -Spring Break \"diet bowl\" aka a veggie breakfast burrito in a bowl -Savory French Toast  The donuts, heavenly, really really enjoyed it. My dish was awesome! Super filling, but it was a healthier alternative that I really enjoyed, My husband also enjoyed his savory french toast, but would have like more hollandaise sauce. Also, the price was really reasonable for our meal. For the two entrees, two donuts, and two beverages it came to 27 dollars. Also, I was thoroughly impressed with their veggie friendly menu. I hate when I go to a restaurant and my only option is french toast because every other option has meat in it, well done there!  Now... The service. Oy.  So it took about 6-8 minutes for us to even be acknowledged when we sat down. She took our order and the food came out FAST, I mean like, less than 10 minutes. Great. I only ate about half of my meal, so I asked for a box when I next saw our waitress. And then she proceeds to put our dirty utensils in my food and walk away with it. I hate wasting perfectly good food, especially when I specifically asked for a box. Not like I can get that back now, can I?  Food was good, but service was a lil scatter brained. Overall a solid choice though!"}
{"text":"We had a great breakfast here last weekend.  Reallly fun, casual atmosphere for families.  I have celiac and cannot eat gluten.  The menu was marked with little robots to distinguish which items were gluten free.  I started with the eggs benedict on GF toast.  I wouldn't reccomend this dish.  I am pretty picky about hollandaise sauce and the sauce here just didn't sit well with me.  It might work for others but it tasted a little like aioli to me.  I decided to order something else and settled on the sweet potato hash which was naturally GF.  It was really good and filling."}
{"text":"Best idea ever to come here for a Sunday brunch. The place was packed and we were told there would be a 55 min wait (perhaps state basketball folks flooded in?) but got lucky with two spots that opened up right away at the bar, so we just ate up there. Delicious bottomless Colectivo coffee! We wanted to eat everything on menu but narrowed it down to the Chorizo Chili Bomb Burrito and Farmer's Hash. We couldn't believe first of all, how much food we got!! (Both went home with leftovers) And secondly, how scrumptious it truly was. Sometimes breakfast out can sort of be the same to me, but both dishes were unique and packed with flavor. I'd have to say if my Farmer's Hash would have some sort of sauce or something that would be nice, but then again I'm just a lover of sauce and extra flavors on really everything. I really was drawn to it because of the sweet potatoes because you don't see those in breakfast dishes much! We grabbed a donut to go...which didn't even make it home into the house with us...that too was amazing.  Don't miss this place for brunch - it is a must!!"}
{"text":"I've taken a couple people here for lunch/brunch, and it has always been pretty good.  We were able to get seated right away and the service was prompt and courteous.  The menu is diverse and the food has been pretty consistent both times.  The coffee was quite good, as was the eggs benedicto and spring break diet.  I was a little disappointed in the donuts, which is what they're known for.  They didn't seem particularly fresh either time.    Some of the other reviews said the parking was difficult.  I actually found the parking pretty easy.  The hotel parking lot had many open spaces both times I went (granted, it was the middle of the week and slightly past the peak lunch hour) and it was easy to get our parking validated.    When I wake up craving a delicious brunch, this isn't the first place that comes to mind, but it's solid and I have certainly recommended it to friends."}
{"text":"I typically don't give five stars on a first visit, I want to see that restaurants are consistent with service and quality.  I was, like others, on the borderline between four and five stars.  The Friday fish fry was divine. I didn't order it, but I definitely ate this off my sig other's plate. The cole slaw wasn't too runny with mayonnaise, just about the right acidity of a slaw.  Their fries were unique in that they were steak cut.  The shrimp and grits were awesome. I've had this dish at the Great Dane in Fitchburg before, and it was good, but this had an interesting tomato and green onion touch with a runny sunny side up egg topper.    The chicken and donut appetizers were excellent, the sauces were nice.    I really  like the decore of the place.  You can park in the Hampton Inn lot above the restaurant, for up to four hours of free validation with your meal.     Finally, a place in this part of town that would be a nice place to eat within walking distance of the south side of UW."}
{"text":"I've been probably ten times, either for weekday lunches or weekend dinners. Never for weekend brunch, so I'm not reviewing for the restaurant when packed. The food is solid. I've had the lox box, breakfast nachos (formerly and more properly called chilaquiles on the menu), and spring break diet each more than a couple of times. And we've often had the doughnuts. The food is consistent, good portions, well-presented. If near campus, I recommend the restaurant for evening dinner in a chill atmosphere setting, casual but not dominated by TV, drinking, or dining noise."}
{"text":"Basset is not amazing, but it is a great location. There are not many places to eat brunch/breakfast near campus, so this place does the job.  They serve great coffee but their bloody marys' are not worth the cost.  Some portions are HUGE while others are really small. Just basic food, nothing to WOW at."}
{"text":"Bassett Street Brunch Club is an ok place to get brunch. The wait is usually long and there's no real place to wait aside from the hotel lobby. Reading the descriptions on the menu, the food sounds interesting. Everything is relatively classic with a bit of a twist. But then you get the plates and there are 30 too many ingredients on each plate. They dishes could use a good editing. And, they serve Collectivo coffee, which is the worst."}
{"text":"BEST SPICY BLOODY MARY IN MADISON. I've ordered it several times and it has always been consistently delicious. It's topped with house-made pickles and a celery stick--and those pickles are freakin' awesome! Service is always great, and food is good. I can't say that any particular dish has stood out to me yet I've been there many times. As of now, I could go for a side of their potatoes and probably three spicy bloodies!!! Extra pickles. Lol. It's THAAT GOOD."}
{"text":"Years later, I still love this place.  Can be pretty busy, depending on the hotel occupancy levels.   Service is consistently good, as is food quality. The lox platter is my favorite, but the house doughnuts are also fantastic. I and my dining companions have never been disappointed with any order over several years.   Great coffee, good outdoor seating area."}
{"text":"Fantastic. Great on a Sunday at noon and even better on a Friday at 2 am. The bloody mary tastes clean, flavorful, and awesome, the biscuits and gravy are savory delicious, and the gluten free pancakes taste surprisingly glutenous."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with the breakfast here. There's a huge smorgasbord of options to choose from on the brekkie menu, and the hardest part is actually picking something to order because they all sound so good!  I couldn't resist ordering the eggs benedicto. What a cute twist on your typical eggs benedict dish! The eggs were perfectly poached on toasty slabs of english muffin and accented with the rich and savory sundried tomato hollandaise. The bits of candied prosciutto added a nice meatiness to the benedict without making it too heavy. And while I don't normally reach for mixed greens for breakfast.... I did like it in this dish because my usual gripe with eggs benedict is that there's just wayyy too much going on. But the greens were a light alternative that kinda balanced everything out in a way that potatoes don't do it for me.  I also picked up the horchata latte. I'm a huge fan of horchata (which is pretty hard to find in Hawaii where I'm from) and a coffee lover, so this was a must try for me! It's totally sweet, creamy, and probably chock full of calories, but worth every single tasty sip.   If you're not feeling in a benedicto mood, that's OK because there's a ton of other food options to choose from. All of which resemble your standard breakfast fare, with a little bit of a twist. Mexican, southern, classic american breakfasts... You name it. If I had more stomach room and a little more time in Madison, I'd wanna try a little bit of every dish on the menu. One of each, please!"}
{"text":"This place is seriously amazing. We started off with an appetizer of donuts and fried chicken, which far exceeded our expectations. My boyfriend had meatloaf which came with mashed potatoes, a biscuit, and tempura onion rings. The mashed potatoes were to die for! I had lemon ricotta blueberry pancakes which were really tasty as well. We also couldn't help but get some donuts to go and are looking forward to having those later tonight. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"In my opinion they have the best bloody Mary in town.  It tastes fresh, well seasoned, and the thin cucumber garnish is half of the reason I order it.  I honestly have never had a bad experience or meal here.  The biggest tip I have for future customers is get there early to skip the frequent long wait and to take advantage of the early bird mimosa special!!  If you do find yourself facing an hour plus wait grab some coffee or cocktail and make yourself comfortable in the hotel lobby.  If you snag a spot in the hotel parking ramp basset street will validate your ticket.  Atmosphere is modern spin on classic diner.  The jam that they give you for toast is super tasty and on numerous occasions was enough to satisfy my sweetness craving and allow me to skip the donut.  Their donuts are pretty decadent so I would encourage sharing with your dining partner.  The Farmer's hash is full of vegetables and flavor and reheats really well.  But their breakfast nachos I think is my favorite item on their menu."}
{"text":"Love the food at this place but the service is just awful. If you eat at this place more than three times you will be disappointed. I had two exceptionally negative experiences there in the same week, I so want to love this place because its so convenient for clean eats but it usually isn't quick even when its slow and half the time- I want to like this place so bad."}
{"text":"Located in the bottom of the new Hampton Inn in Downtown Madison but not affiliated with the hotel itself. Conveniently located.  Stopped in during second week of being open.  Decent bar selection and attentive staff.   Eclectic menu with generous portions...exactly what you want from a Brunch stop.  Favorite was the chicken and donuts. Donut holes were fresh and warm. I'm not even gonna lie....had to order some extra donuts holes they were so good.  To the side is a coffee bar/donut shop thing going on. Interesting selection but they were out of first choices while I was there. Ended up with a maple glazed bacon donut.   Sounds and looked pretty good but the donut itself was pretty bland and the maple glaze didn't really come through. Dessert should be pretty decadent if you're gonna have it...maybe they need a little time to adjust their recipe.  Better than average hotel fare."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely excellent, but the service was very slow. It was busy, but the waitress walked past us a ton of times and could have conveniently left the check after we were finished. Instead, we politely waited for 10-15 minutes. We will go back when it's not as busy because the food was so good."}
{"text":"I love Bassett Street Brunch Club!  I'm here close to every weekend and still am not bored with the food options! I almost always start with an Horchata Latte; I love the mix of sweetness and a bit of spice. Next, my friends and I usually get the Fried Chicken & Donuts appetizer, the sriracha honey sauce that comes on the side is delicious!  My friends and I have covered a good amount of the brunch menu and our favorites so far are:  Savory French Toast Eggs Benedicto (my favorite!) Chicken & A Biscuit (great, even better with a side of the sriracha honey sauce) Chilaquiles Oatmeal Creme Brulee  Service has always been great, no matter how busy! It does get quite busy during brunch hours, but it's easy to grab a drink at the bar and find a seat in the hotel lobby. Bassett Street Brunch Club is must try!"}
{"text":"Driving through Madison I looked up different breakfast joints and picked this one only because it was close to the university. Boy was it the right choice! The parking was a little confusing bit we found out (after parking in the street) that you can park in the hotel lot.  Service was prompt and nice. We had a young gal named Sam and she was delightful. All her suggestions were right on.   As other reviews said, the chicken & donut was to die for. Bloody mary had the tastiest little pickles on top & another TDF was my mom's pick of \"savory french toast\".  4 of us ate 8 different things and not 1 complaint. You might need a nap after but you NEED to stop by this place if you are in or near Madison."}
{"text":"This was our second choice for a day early Mother's Day brunch.  Our first choice had a line around the corner.  This place had a 30 minute wait, but it was lots more manageable. The menu looked promising and the atmosphere was lovely.  They also had a display of donuts that made my little do loving heart beat loudly.  But I wanted something more healthy.  I ordered the Spring Break Diet.  A big bowl filled with black beans, brown rice, scrambled eggs, green onions, avocado, cilantro, roasted tomato ranchero salsa, queso fresco, and corn tortillas.  Sounded great.  Looked even better.  Very tasty.  However, I have only one recommendation.  More salsa.  And perhaps extra on the side.  My dish, in retrospect, was \"dry\", for lack of a better word.  It needed something to bring it together.  All the ingredients were perfect, plentiful and prepared exactly the way I asked, but it seemed dry. The salsa listed on the menu as being in the dish was either missing or not enough for me.    I do recommend this place, but don't be a coward like me and not ask for extra salsa on the side.  It's what brings the place together (Sorry, Dude)."}
{"text":"So glad we chose this place! Coffee was delicious and steamy in an extra large mug. Menu filled with amazing unique options that made it really hard to choose. Ended up picking the poutine with a poached egg on top- yummo! Other friends were happy with their selections as well. My sisters choice really wowed though- savory french toast with hollandaise, bacon, & arugula. She decided to add fried chicken to it & that was really the showstopper! Great crispy breading; so good! Service was a little slow, but very friendly & informative. If we ever adventure to Madison again we will be back!"}
{"text":"I was very pleasantly surprised that this hotel restaurant had such great food, at a relatively inexpensive ($15 a plate) price. The name is a misnomer- this brunch place serves everything from donuts to mashed potatoes and meatloaf. The drinks are creative and delicious, and the staff is polite and courteous. I highly suggest their take on the classic grilled cheese with homemade tomato soup. Would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Addicted to this place. Could be to the fact that I live about two blocks away, love brunch food but really I've never been disappointed. Food aways tasty, service is friendly. They forgot to give me utensils once but gave me a free donut. Wish they were open 24/7. Follow them on Facebook and Istagram for great promos."}
{"text":"Had the banana French toast! Very good - you really taste the freshness of the banana"}
{"text":"We stayed at the attached Hampton Hotel and didn't eat here until the last night. My first impression was that the staff was really friendly. They serve breakfast all day, so we took a while to order, jumping back and forth between the options, but the server never showed any signs of impatience as he came by to take out order several times.  Once a decision was finally made, we ordered the Fish Tacos (fried cod), the Tuesday Taco Special (chicken), and a Hot to Tot Burrito (eggs, bacon, tots, cheese, avocado, and onion). The kitchen happily prepared the chicken tacos \"deconstructed\" so my daughter could build them herself and avoid the \"it's has something I don't like on it drama\". Everything was really tasty.  It was a late dinner, so we also scored 1/2 price donuts to go (after 8:30 pm). Will definitely hit this place up again next time we're in Madison."}
{"text":"I want to like this place because the music is great, I like the vibe, coffee is tasty.....and who doesn't love homemade donuts!?!?!  However, the entree food isn't that great.  I've had the bagel sandwich which is really dry and not very flavorful.  I've had the huevos rancheros and they were really soggy and lacked heat.  Also, the kids meal 2-1-1 thing comes with jalapeno cornbread or something similar....what kid likes that??"}
{"text":"Very disappointing.  The menu looks good - lots of options, very creative.  Poorly executed.  Our food was lukewarm when it arrived.  We got there when they opened, it couldnt have been sitting too long after being prepared, but it must have sat under the warming lamps waiting to be picked up for a while. The potatoes were undercooked.  Service was mediocre - we had to remind the waiter to tell us the specials, and then he couldn't remember what was in them.  He never refilled coffee. I doubt we'll be back for a while."}
{"text":"The atmosphere, the cultured but curious servers and the oddly paired combinations make this place a refreshing break from the remixed menus everywhere else.  Try the fish and chips, or the lox box! The Reuben is one of the best. You may think these seem to be the same old menu item, but wait till your tastebuds beat up the roof of your mouth!  Different in a great not weird way!  A must stop in Madison"}
{"text":"Single handedly made me a Reuben fan. If you can get seated in a reasonable time, definitely a must go."}
{"text":"Drew and Trevor were very entertaining and provided great service. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I spontaneously drove to Madison for brunch and we enjoyed our time there. Their brunch menu was just fantastic. Service was great too but I was a bit disappointed with their donuts. Christmas donuts were cute but didn't taste as good as I expected."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed brunch at Bassett Street Brunch Club! It definitely felt like it belonged in a bigger city, or like I would find it in downtown Chicago not a college town.  We went in at about 1:30 on a Saturday and our wait was 35 minutes. After walking around for awhile, we returned and were seated outside. There wasn't a pager or text system, you just had to wait around for them to call your name out loud. Definitely a good idea of something for them to utilize in the future.  Our waiter was super nice! Friendly young man. Knew the menu. Service was on the slower side, but it was a packed house.  On the food: the iced coffee was good. I had the farmers hash with poached eggs over sweet potatoes and parsnips. The veggies were well seasoned and the eggs were perfectly cooked. The homemade biscuit was more of a cornbread in my opinion--it was a square piece and had some sort of peppers/cheese in it. It was good, but was served with a jam that didn't really pair well. The cheese curds were a bit of a disappointment, a weird texture and really greasy.  Overall, one of the better meals I ate in Madison. I would have loved to see more of the interior decor as the menu and website had great design."}
{"text":"This place!  It was my last morning in Madison and I needed a good brunch place.  I'm from Portland - we know brunch.  So I walked to Bassett and I was not disappointed.  Inside, this is possibly the cleanest cutest cafe I've seen.  The service was exceptional.  And I loved my food.  I had the toast with avocado spread on top - sounded strange but it was so amazing.  I was able to sit, relax, read my book, and enjoy the great food.  Definitely recommended for anyone staying in the capitol neighborhood."}
{"text":"LOVE BRUNCH HERE. YES!! Have the French Toast....to die for!!! but come early, long lineups are a pain."}
{"text":"long waits on weekends but you can go sit in the connected hotel lobby and drink free coffee. My experience has been that the sweet dishes are much better than the savory dishes and boy are they sweet."}
{"text":"I came here with a fellow yelper around 10:30am on a Friday morning.  It was shaping up to be an uncomfortably hot day, but it was not yet unbearable at 10am that we requested to sit outside under some shade.  Thankfully their patio tables had some umbrellas to provide our desired shade.   Since it was National Donut Day when we visited, we shared a maple bacon donut.  It was maple glazed with bits of bacon on top.  It was tasty, but my favorite donuts are still at Greenbush.  Still, I give this place props for the variety and creativity in their donut flavors.  We also ordered and shared shrimp and grits and their lox box.  The lox box came in a bento box with a Gotham's Bagels' Everything bagel, two pieces of cured salmon, and all the fixings you could want such as herbed cream cheese, pickled red onions, olives, sliced tomatos, lettuces, and capers.  We each took a half a bagel and fixed ourselves one of a deliciously decadent lox topped bagel.  The pickled onions added a really nice acidity with a touch of sweetness.  The shrimp and grits were tasty, but I found it heavy and the shrimp a bit overcooked.  I think the tomato sauce that they put over it was meant to balance out the heaviness of the dish, but it just made a saucy mess.    I'd definitely come back here for the lox box, but not so much for the shrimp and grits."}
{"text":"We came here on Mother's Day for brunch. The wait was long but it was well worth it. My partner ordered an amazing bananas foster French toast that was probably one of the best things I ever tasted. My eggs were fluffy and perfectly cooked. Everything was tasty. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"The most creative breakfast spot in town! I've brunched A LOT over my years, but not many menus leave me so indecisive. There were so many gluten free options here which made it difficult to decide. They happened to have a huevos rancheros special that day so I got that, and boy was it delicious. Everything bite was spicy and delicious.   All around the table everyone was happy! We happened to go here from the suggestion of our Airbnb host, and boy was he right. We did notice that it gets really busy on the weekend mornings, but we stumbled in on a Tuesday morning and were able to grab one of the lovely outdoor tables.  There is construction on the street right now so it may be difficult to get there by car, and may be a bit dusty to eat outside."}
{"text":"Awesome place for brunch. I've had a few different dishes here and a few drinks as well. If you're torn between mimosa or bloody, definitely go with mimosa. Their bloodied just aren't their strong point. On the other hand, it's a lovely spot to relax over a weekend brunch session with some friends. A tad bit over priced but not unreasonable. Lots of very unique options, as well as some that fall on the healthier end of the spectrum as well as the more unhealthy side if that's what you're looking for. The carnitas bowl (name escapes me) is insanely good! Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"We had a great breakfast here this morning! I highly recommend the coffee and their poached eggs! I had the American plate and all of the components were incredible!"}
{"text":"Great Brunch spot in Madison especially for the younger crowd, generally a long wait (we waited an hour Sunday at 10 am) but there is generous seating outside and at the bar to grab drinks while to wait. The table turnover is quick and food comes out fast! We had some coffee, drinks and food, all of which was good but not not great.   Coffee - They serve colectivo (a great Wisconsin cafe and roaster for those from out of town), so the coffee is great plus it costs about the same as it would at any of their cafe's.  Food - As others have said the food is generally a spin on classic brunch items. We started by sharing a Bacon covered maple glazed donut (why not try it!). The donut itself was a bit dry but the flavors of the bacon and maple were delicious, though it is something you really need to be in the mood to eat. The breakfast nachos were amazing, great corn tortilla chips, fresh jalapenos (not pickled, thank goodness), and a TON of food. We also enjoyed the Spring Break Diet, which is basically huevos rancheros in a bowl.   Drinks: Go with a bloody or the greyhound!  Overall, we enjoyed the Brunch Club and would go back."}
{"text":"Meh. Basic small town food. Sriracha wings were tasty but everything else...just meh. Also the food wasn't hot. Like butter wouldn't melt in my pancakes. Waste of calories.   Nice spot to hang out if you stick with the wings and maybe a drink."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I wish I could rate this 4.5 stars. My friend and I went to BSBC last week and so many things looked appealing to us that we ended up ordering 4 entrees to split between the two of us.  2 of the entrees we ordered I would give 4 stars and the other 2 I'd give 5 stars...  Butternut and Blue Salad- 5 STARS. This is easily one of my favorite salads that I can remember having. Super unique flavors that all compliment each other extremely well. On top of that, the portion was wonderfully large so it could actually be filling if that's all you choose to order.  Chicken Cimichurri- 4 STARS. Really tasty sandwich that I'd definitely order again sometime. We ordered it with tater tots, which were good, but I'd recommend ordering it with the tomato soup that they have. I didn't try it, but I think the combo would be awesome and our server vouched for the soup.  Mac Attack- 4 STARS. I thought this was quite delicious and a unique, upscale take on an old favorite, but my friend wasn't a big fan. It didn't have your typical cheeses and included both butternut squash and kale, which I thought was very tasty but if you think you're ordering standard Mac, you may be thrown off a little.  Ravioli- 5 STARS. My friend and I both agreed this was our favorite. Not much to say except for the fact it was delicious and we both wished the portion was larger.  BSBC is known for their breakfast and doughnuts and we didn't take advantage of either during this visit, but based on how much I enjoyed our dinner I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Personally, this place is overrated. I'm not saying the food isn't good, but it isn't.. The best I've ever had. It was, dare I say it, average. I know this is a super popular place but I wasn't feeling it. Don't ever order anything but breakfast food! I had something off the lunch/dinner menu and.. I could barely finish my plate. But! I must  say that the seating is extremely comfortable. & the staff are nice."}
{"text":"A very very popular brunch place in Madison. You better wake up early and put your name down for a table or you are gonna wait for hours to get seated. Sadly they don't take reservation so you ought to wake up early. I went there 5 times and gave up all 4 times because of the long wait. When I finally got to try the food I was disappointed because it wasn't as good as I anticipated. Everything was just ordinary and a bit over priced. Don't let the crowd and the long wait fool you"}
{"text":"The Brunch Club continues to impress! There's a reason this place is full at meal times every single day and has an hour wait on weekends... It's what people want in a restaurant! We LOVE breakfast foods, and we want to see them served in a variety of ways... and served all day long. Brunch Club has mastered this! They have sweet, they have savory, they have eggs in all form anddddd meats and veggies. I recommend the Spring Break Diet for a satisfying meal. They have a ton of coffee drinks, cocktails out the wazoo, and even donuts. Needless to say, the menu is a crowd-pleaser. The trendy diner-ish vibe caters to all types of get togethers, from student hangover brunches to work meetings and dates. It's casual but trendy enough to feel like a special occasion. If I can bear the wait, I'll be here monthly!"}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast and lunch foods.  Gluten-free options available as well.   Excellent service, relaxed atmosphere. Good for family or friends."}
{"text":"Good but not great, like all the Food Fight joints.  I know it's hard, but they do a poor job keeping up with the weekend brunch crush.   Overall, I wouldn't avoid this place, but I wouldn't seek it out either."}
{"text":"awesome food but they don't take reservations so expect long wait times during peak brunch hours. I love this place and have been back several times. its well worth the wait times."}
{"text":"Iconic brunch spot. The wait will be long on Sat/Sun mornings after 10 but usually moves fairly quickly. The outdoor seating is perfect for stalling time on a sunny day. Food is good, a little pricey for what it is. Always have excellent service. Also a perfect breakfast-for-dinner spot during the week!"}
{"text":"BSBC is a lively, fun spot to have brunch in Madison, especially if it happens to include one of their summery brunch cocktails. Putting juice in a cocktail automatically makes It acceptable to drink at 9:00 a.m., I say.   There's a lot more to love than just delicious watermelon mojitos, bloody marys, strawberry bellinis or frozen screwdrivers. How about fantastic donuts, made in house daily, with a great selection of rotating flavors?   But wait, there's more.  Whether you fancy a breakfast on the sweet side or something more savory, you'll be sure and find something to whet your whistle. I opted for the savory french toast, which had a parmesan-herb batter and a sunny-side up egg. It was a welcome change from the usual french toast. Other menu items that I found intriguing (and will definitely encourage me to go back and try) were the chilaquiles, farmer's hash, shrimp and grits, and the lox box.  And I must mention the highlight of breakfast: the oatmeal creme brulee. If a dessert and a breakfast cereal knocked boots, this would be the beautiful product of their love. Creamy custard with a crackly skating rink of sugar atop steel-cut toothsome oatmeal, served with fresh berries. We were all fighting over every last spoonful.  Service is energetic, even at what's considered the ungodly early hour (at least in a college town) of 9 a.m. Coffee is refilled promptly, and great recommendations were made on food and drinks.  Despite its name, Bassett Street serves more than just brunch. Come for dinner, an appetizer, lunch, or just a drink. The menu is eclectic enough to not be boring, but traditional enough that it doesn't offend a more vanilla palate.  Oh, and be sure and take advantage of the Donut Drive-Up!"}
{"text":"There was a short wait but the bar service was excellent..we got sat right away and the food was great! I'd definitely come back:)"}
{"text":"I've been to Bassett Street Brunch Club a few times now. Their M.O. is simple: all day brunch food.  I'm a fan of their doughnuts. Their yeast dough is soft and chewy, and they come up with interesting flavors.  Unfortunately, I don't love their food. It's not that the food is bad; it's just that it doesn't wow me.  I found their country fried brussels sprouts  to kind of just be a mouthful of veggies with some crunchy batter around it. Their chicken and a biscuit is good enough, but I find the biscuits at Short Stack and Eldorado Grill to be better. The breakfast nachos are big and crunchy with a nice sweet and spicy guajillo sauce, but it gets boring after a few bites. The eggs benedict is pretty solid, but nothing really sticks out about it.  I have to admit though, that savory french toast is a pretty neat invention. It's great if you like cheese and bacon but also admire the fluffy texture of french toast.  I'd give most of the menu items I've tried 3 stars, but their doughnuts and savory french toast really shine."}
{"text":"Bassett has become my home away from home. I routinely come here with my co-workers and friends to enjoy breakfast, brunch, lunch, and even dinner sometimes. The service is spectacular. Servers Gail and Geoff are the absolute greatest. I recommend the Spring Break Diet or Farmer's Hash. One of the best spots in town. Nothing but great vibes."}
{"text":"Thank you, Yelp! for helping me find this place during my visit to Madison!  We had to wait for a seat, always a good sign for a restaurant. It was a nice day outside so we didn't mind at all, but ended up getting seated much sooner than expected. Then we had to decide on all the great menus options. Everything coming out of the kitchen looked solo good!  We ended up with the Pork Carnitas Hash for me and the Eggs Benedicto for my wife.  See pics. Food was outstanding, service with a smile, and an amazing drink menu!!!  I definitely won't be able to get back soon enough. I will be back every time I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Please note: The 1-star rating reflects the service we experienced only, not the food.  We arrived mid-morning on a Monday, and the restaurant was not too busy-looking, based on the number of open tables inside and out and the pace of the staff.  The host estimated a 20-minute wait for a table for two, so we opted to sit at one of several open seats at the bar, per the host's suggestion.  After sitting at the bar for about 10 minutes, the bartenders had yet to bring us menus, clear the dirty plates in front of us, or even make eye contact with us.  I returned to the host's station and requested our name be added to the waiting list for a table.  The host offered to clear the dirty plates in front of us and to get us menus, which he did.  About 15 minutes later, we had still received no acknowledgement from the bartenders.  Throughout this time, several booths and other tables remained open, uncleared, and unseated, while many people waited.  After about 25 minutes of this lack of service, we left without ordering.    While our experience seems inconsistent with many other reviews here, and the menu did look amazing, our first time here was a disappointment, and we won't return again anytime soon."}
{"text":"The service was good but having read the reviews I thought the food was average: I had the everything bagel which was just ok and the creme brûlée oatmeal which sounded delicious but was not that great especially as there was just some liquid sugar on the top rather than crunchy brûlée topping. Marigold is a much tastier option!"}
{"text":"Had brunch with some friends here today.. there was a 30 minute wait but they got us into the brunch bar right away! Super cute 50ish startle theme.   They had a great, large menu with many kinda of options. They make their own donuts and had many daily flavors. We got the blueberry lemon donut and the espresso cream cheese.. both were delicious!   I got the bagel sandwich with breakfast potatoes and vanilla late and it was very good! I usually don't go for breakfast potatoes but they were the best ones I have ever had!! I was also surprised they could make specialty coffee drinks and they also had a full bar.   The waiter was a little absent minded but he still got the job done well enough!   I would definitely recommend for a brunch any day!   Space is great for families but not so much large groups."}
{"text":"Great food and a creative atmosphere.  My only complaint is that the seating is inefficiently spread out and not conducive to the large crowds that the BSBC draws, so you'll have a long wait for a table on a weekend morning.  Otherwise great experience."}
{"text":"I ordered the American Style, chose scrambled eggs with veggie sausage and a biscuit...very special cheese biscuit, lightly grilled and a perfect accompaniment.  Scrambled eggs and sausages were perfectly done.  The grilled potato slices were tender, tasty and mildly spicy.  Service was courteous and prompt.  I didn't have to wait long for my food, either.  Visited during a late lunch hour (1P.M. or so) on a Wednesday, so it may have been a slow time for them, but I can understand why people stand in line here on weekends.  Intend to try something different each time I come here."}
{"text":"There whole menu does a spin on the classics. The farmers hash has brussel sprouts, sweet potatoes, regular breakfast potatoes, and radish topped with egg. I loved it. Their chocolate chip pancakes are amazing. The avocado toast was a bit disappointing. Their desserts are epic but don't waste your money on their donuts. For being handmade they are okay at best. I'd rather have a gas station donut. They're breakfast cocktails rock. Overall one of my favorite brunch spots in Madison."}
{"text":"I've yet to have a savory dish here that wasn't amazing. The Spring Break Diet Bowl is really good with perfectly cooked rice, plenty of avocado, and really yummy black beans. This is one of my favorite places downtown for a late night meal."}
{"text":"Been here several times, and it's always a solid choice. The menu has a great, unique selection but I usually get the same thing because it's THAT good: the savory French toast. Even comes with an equally delicious little side salad so you can feel less terrible about eating two giant slices of decadent French toast...  Good beer selection for dinner, great coffee (Colectivo) with my breakfast. The atmosphere is unique and fun, and I haven't had a problem with the service. If you can save room, try the donuts! They're amazing! I also just learned that they validate parking if you park in the hotel structure. Definitely a brunch (or lunch, or dinner...) staple. ALSO editing to add that there are many GREAT options here if you are not a huge fan of the typical sausage/eggs/toast combo for breakfast (but you can get that too if it floats your brunch boat)."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a slice of pie.  It was excellent!  I later found out that this place is owned by the same folks behind Monty's Blue Plate diner, which explained the amazing pie.    Service was spot on.  The dishes that other folks were eating looked outstanding, and I really want to go back to get real food soon.  I almost forgot to mention that this is a beautiful space.  Modern, warm, and inviting, whoever designed this place knew what they were doing."}
{"text":"We are staying at the attached hotel and came here for a drink. My rating isn't based on much more than the donuts, drinks, and service.  My husband had a lemon drop martini and I had a spiked type of smoothie. I'd give my drink a 7/10 and his a 9.5/10. His was much better than mine!  The menu is overwhelming. We went with donuts because everything else was too much to understand in the menu. Don't get me wrong, it all looked good, it just required some studying.  Our service was really good. Katie was our server. She was friendly and very helpful.   Prices were typical for cocktails and the donuts were only $1.50 cause it was after 8. Our bill was $15 for two drinks and two donuts so that wasn't bad to me. I can't wait to go back for brunch.... after I study the menu!"}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast in town by a long shot.  I've tried about half a dozen things here and can't find significant faults with any of them.  Service is good, they're accommodating when we bring the kid, and I don't feel guilty bringing her, because it's always full of chatting people.  The carnitas hash is off the chain good.  Like, seriously.  It's so good that it tries to prevent me from ordering anything else ever.  I would also recommend the chicken and biscuit, the coconut French toast, and any of their donut varieties.  It can get REALLY crowded at peak brunch hours.  Last time we were here we waited almost 90 minutes for a table.  We would have bailed, but we had out of town guests with us and wanted them to have the experience.  Finally, I want to thank the staff for saving my wife's first Mother's Day this year.  We were in town looking at houses before moving here and had a disastrous experience at another place.  Because we were staying in the hotel this place is attached to, we tried our luck at dinner, and they came through in a major way.  We will always remember that and be thankful for the extra effort on a terrible day."}
{"text":"Came during UW Parents' Weekend (didn't realize but noticed it was extra busy) for Friday brunch at 11:30. Packed house, and they said the wait would be half an hour, but we got seated outside in 15 minutes. Hostess and waitress were super nice and helpful. The waitress knew all the food and drinks on the menu and gave us great advice when we asked. We had a bellini, chilled screwdriver, and bourbon buzz. Loved them all (daughter from L.A. couldn't believe the drink prices!) but would say screwdriver and bourbon buzz were especially great on a hot day. We had a chocolate hazelnut doughnut which was amazing, and then split the chicken and biscuit and the lasagna. Both were good, but the chicken and biscuit (served with a sunny side up egg on top) was especially awesome. We'll be back."}
{"text":"This is a fun one. Funky decor(robots and donuts are the ongoing theme), eclectic menu, and friendly staff.  This place was HOPPIN' on a Sunday around 9:30--but the waitstaff told us it would only get busier by 11(which is when the apps and lunch items roll out). We were able to get seated at the counter, though, which I actually think I'd prefer. It was comfortable and we were helped right away.   I chose the shrimp and grits and a horchata latte. The dish was good, but my egg was a bit underdone. Clear, raw egg white goo nestled up to my lovely yolk and that gives me the heebies. The latte had good flavor. They brew Collectivo(formerly Alterra) beans, and make their own horchata. Unfortunately, they make it sooooo sweet, I won't be ordering it again. I couldn't even finish half my mug. Maybe we could have an unsweetened version, or at least chill out on the sugar?  I forbid my boyfriend to order his standard meat, egg, bread combo--(here it's 'merican style). I can do that t home for $1.98, dude. So, he rolled his eyes and got the corned beef hash. This is chunks of brisket, not the weird canned dog food looking stuff. He also got a donut to go, but didn't eat it until the next day...so we won't pass judgement because it wasn't fresh.  The validated parking is the cherry on top! It's nice to not have to jockey for a downtown parking spot before you've even had your cup of coffee."}
{"text":"TATER TOTS, people! Hear what I'm saying to you, please, because these tots are worth it; worth every calorie, worth extra treadmill time, worth a 50 minute wait....worth it!!! Perfectly crisp while not at all greasy and topped with just a hint of Asiago and chives. Brilliant! And then you pull out a little aioli and some Siracha sauce, Meta-Brilliant! Ok, I'm calm, but you really must understand.  So this was my first visit to Brunch Club and we did, in fact, wait for 50 minutes for a table at 1:30 in the afternoon. Unexpected, yes, but well worth it. The environment/decor is fun and unique and mod. Every staff member we were in contact with was incredibly kind and very professional, but not at all stiff. My burger was very good - they made it to order and added all the toppings I requested - a solid burger. I also had the Frozen Screwdriver. Yep! A yummy orange slushy (not too sweet) made with vanilla vodka! Danger! But in the best possible way. History will repeat itself - I will be back. I may even try something new, maybe something a bit more breakfasty. And I'll happily wait another 50 minutes if I have to. I can hardly wait!!"}
{"text":"Great brunch eggs Benedict is 100. Highly recommend also serve alcohol for a nice Bloody Mary or mimosa."}
{"text":"Food: 4 Service: 3 Uniqueness: 5  -------------------------------------------  This is a favorite of a lot of Madison-ians and there's a reason why. Their unique offerings are pretty darn tasty. The service can be lackluster due to how crowded and busy it gets, but is generally passable.  Don't forget a homemade donut! You won't get some of these flavors anywhere else."}
{"text":"I LOVED THIS PLACE! And so did my husband!! We love brunch and if you love it as much as us, you must make the Bassett Street Brunch Club your next stop! We went on the weekend, but they serve brunch all the time. I had a bloody mary, which was delicious, and my husband had one of their specialty cocktails. We indulged in the chicken and a donut (pretty sure I died and went to Heaven after tasting it), then for our main course I ordered Chicken and Biscuits and my husband got the Savory French Toast. The chicken and biscuit was also phenomenal, but the savory french toast left something to be desired. I can't give 4.5 stars so 4 stars for inconvenient parking and the long wait (originally quoted 45-50 minutes, but then we ate at the bar). The interior is rather 'cozy' in addition to the fact that there wasn't many places to wait had we waited for table. They have an outdoor (street front) patio with lounge chairs/couches to sit and wait on, but during winter this option wouldn't be feasible."}
{"text":"I walk past this all the time, but didn't get around to going until last night.  I got the eggs Benedict, which come with pesto, poached egg, candied prosciutto, and a sun dried tomato hollandaise sauce. It was good, although the candied prosciutto didn't add much -- I wish there were more of it. Everyone else at my table loved their food, too. I'm really excited to go back and try the farmer's hash!   I gave it three stars because the service was insanely slow. There were four of us and it took a half an hour to get our food. The server was training another one, but I'm not sure why that made the kitchen impossibly slow. Especially considering the other people at my table got sandwiches and pancakes, the wait for our food was ridiculous."}
{"text":"There's definitely a long wait, but that's to be expected with food this good.  I love the menu here. It's not often that I find a restaurant where I want to try and end up liking everything on the menu! I've ordered something different every time (always breakfast food, though) and haven't been disappointed yet."}
{"text":"Was excited to try this place, but was quite disappointed. To start our booth was not clean, there was leftover food on the booth seat, and dried egg yolk on the table. Our water glasses were not clean as well. I ordered the Banana Foster French Toast, the bread was good but the bananas were terrible. My husband ordered the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes, they burned one of the pancakes and then covered it up by sticking it on the bottom. Neither of us finished our meals. It's a Thursday, so it was not busy, can't imagine what's it like on a busy weekend."}
{"text":"I think I found my brunch place in Madison, and I am so happy to say that I've FINALLY have a plate of delicious dairy-free eggs benedict, and my faith in eggs hasn't disappeared just yet.   Came to Bassett Street Brunch Club on a Saturday morning around 11, and the wait was acceptable (around 20 minutes). Environment inside is open and inviting, and I appreciate the cute chairs and tables outside so you can sit and socialize while you wait. Parking is pretty impossible, so I elect to walk here if I come back (which will be soon).   I loved our server. She was so sweet and was able to readily tell me which plates had dairy. She refilled our waters on a regular basis too, which is always a plus.  Eggs benedict was amazing! I've never had eggs benedict with pesto, but I will now. The pesto did kind of make the biscuit underneath a little soggy, but I'm not complaining. The eggs were poached perfectly, and I cheered when the yolk was runny. FINALLY, I can eat a plate of eggs benedict in Madison without dairy! I guess it's true what they say; third time's the charm.  The mimosa was slightly too strong, but it didn't make my meal worse. The strawberry jam also had me going back for seconds. And the toast is made without butter! Hooray!!!  Yes, I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on a random Tuesday and I am convinced this is as good as brunch gets in Madison, probably the Midwest. They have coffee, cocktails, Voo Doo donut rival donuts and great food. Our service was also spot on.   So what did I eat and drink? A triple almond milk latte (okay, I had a better one of these at the Johnson St Public House but whatever). Then upon my server's recommendation had the savory french toast and two appetizer donuts (maple bacon and vanilla glazed). These donuts were huge, cakey and well balanced. I liked that the maple bacon had a maple glaze instead of maple frosting and the bacon on top was crunchy so there is a nice texture to the donut. The vanilla glazed was pleasantly sweet and a bit more dense than the maple bacon. My only regret here is not getting a chocolate donut to compare them with.   The savory french toast was OMG, amazing. You can really taste the parmesan & herbs in the batter, and the hollandaise sauce and arugula are wonderful compliments to the party going on in your mouth. The portion is huge but you'll still eat it all. I was a bit nervous about the hollandiaise making it a bit to rich but it just elevated the dish. In fact, i wanted more of it. My dad got the shrimp and grits. This was also awesome! Not too tomatoey and the shrimp were a decent size. The grits were a bit grainy versus velvety like some are but I'm sure that could be fixed with more cheese.  So overall, I'd love to dine here at least once a week, if my location and waistline allowed it. So you should definitely dine here!"}
{"text":"To be honest, I think this place is overrated. It seems to get a lot of hype for average food.  It is a solid brunch choice, but the food isn't mindblowing. If the wait is more than 30 minutes (and it often is) then I suggest going somewhere else.   I will say, the donuts are delicious. I also like that they have some healthier options on the menu as well."}
{"text":"The most important part of Basset Street Brunch Club: I have waited my entire life for a server at a restaurant to ask me, \"Interested in donuts to start?\" YES. Always.  Jokes aside, though, I really enjoyed Bassett Street Brunch Club. My friend and I had a 15-20 minute wait, which was totally fine for Sunday brunch time (11:30). Our server was very friendly and attentive, and the atmosphere was fun - I didn't completely \"get\" the robot decor, but I think I like it.  First, the drinks: my friend had a bloody mary, which she said was just okay. I loved that they have horchata, and as a Rumchata lover, the spike horchata was a good choice.  The food was also awesome. I started with a chocolate glazed donut with crushed hazelnuts on top (Nutella donut, anyone?). My friend ordered a peanut butter glazed one with Corn Pops on top. Both were very good, but having lived near Greenbush Bakery for a year, I can't honestly say Bassett has the best donuts I've ever tasted.  After the donut course (I can't believe I just got to say that), I ordered the Mac Attack, which was a generous bowl of pasta shells with cheese sauce, shredded parmesan, green onion, kale, and butternut squash. For me, this was probably the best part of the meal.  I liked everything about Bassett Street Brunch Club, and I can't wait to try more of their donuts, but I'm really excited to check out the rest of their savory entrees."}
{"text":"Had a very pleasant surprise at brunch this morning.  Have discovered that it is no longer a given that your toast will arrive buttered, nor warm. As a result, I always specify \"buttered\" when I order. Today I asked for an English muffin  with my eggs. I was delighted to see Maddie saw a naked muffin coming my way and dashed to the kitchen to correct the error. Better still, my breakfast arrived perfectly warm!"}
{"text":"One time I was far too drunk and it was far too late and I ordered some delicious coffee tasting drink twice and it was amazing.  So on that basis, yeah, 4 stars."}
{"text":"My meal was good BUT my dessert was GREAT.  Had the farm hash. This would have been better if the brussel sprouts had been roasted more. Had the key lime pie for dessert. That was perfect.  Loved the menu selection. This place has really long hours. Hats off to my server Akex!!! He was absolutely the best. A definite repeat for this place!!!"}
{"text":"I'd give this place a 3.5. Service was pretty good - they were very friendly but my boyfriend needed to remind them of a side he ordered. We waited about a half an hour for brunch on Saturday morning. Parking is tough, but that's to be expected in the area. Ambiance is cute!  Food-wise, I ordered the avocado toast, which was okay. There was a lot of avocado on top (which I normally like... pro-avocado over here), but it made the bread too soft. My mom got the ricotta lemon curd pancakes. She liked them alright, but I thought they were mighty fine. Noms! I will say that they have a pretty big menu, so I'd go back and give this place a second shot."}
{"text":"I'm sorry. I really am. I wanted to love this place. Not that I think donuts are anything to write home about, and I don't think a restaurant that stays open past 3 should be called a brunch club, but that's just me and the weird things that bother me.  Our service was ok, an over-friendly waitress (they exist, I'm sorry. She was a bit inappropriate) And an order of ravioli that as horribly cooked. Turns out they don't make it themselves (but do get it locally). Traded it in for a sandwich and soup, which were both delicious.  But they didn't offer us any comp for the horrible first dish. The waitress even told us the chef tried it and agreed it was bad. I just feel like to get a customer to come back you should do SOMETHING nice. A donut for crying out loud? SOMETHING? But alas. Wine was meh (would have liked to see more of a selection or a cheap house wine). I feel like I'm being generous with 3 stars but I also believe in second chances and maybe a weird night/weird waitress. Bummer!"}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere. We sat at the brunch counter which was interesting. The donuts are amazing and I got  the chocolate chip pancakes. The pancakes were pretty good but the syrup was different than the maple syrup I've eaten. Reasonably priced and I will be back!"}
{"text":"Mixed but certainly leaning positive.  Good Breakfast sandwich was tasty.   Wife liked Savory French Toast Biscuit was to-die-for  Bad Dining room was WAY too hot - bothered our whole group. Bloody Mary was bad.  Could only taste pepper and salt. Carnitas Hash was super light on pork. Server made numerous mistakes"}
{"text":"Had a Shrimp Cobb Salad and it was a little better than I had expected. The shrimp were about Medium size and had been grilled. But it looked like they were steamed before they were grilled. They tasted okay and the salad tasted okay but I'm not sure I'd go back just for that salad."}
{"text":"Good food, good service, be very prepared to wait.  I went on a Sunday morning at about 9:30am. Which is probably just after the early birds and slightly before the motivated hung over people arrive. It was a 45 minute wait, and the people just kept coming.  To help pass the time, they have a bar where you can get all manner of drinks while you wait!  What I tried and I very much recommend both: Guajillo Burrito- smaller than I was expecting, but packed with flavor. The one I had happened to have a very hard seed or rock in it. The server was very nice and actually took it off the bill even though I just mentioned it. NBD, it's full of veggies grown in dirt, a rogue rock is bound the make it's way through at some point.  Bananas Foster French Toast- Fantastic syrup (I would have like a little bit more) and really think slices of soft challah bread. Almost as good as a similar item at Bluephies.  Biggest draw backs are the wait and the parking situation. If you can walk, definitely walk. Otherwise, there is a garage on Francis between University and Johnson, or street parking if you are very lucky."}
{"text":"the chicken and biscuits is what you're gonna wanna get.  yup.  great breakfast/brunch spot in Madison."}
{"text":"Not sure how this one got such high reviews because we had a train wreck of a lunch. Just maybe the kitchen and staff had an off day...if not, you may want to stop elsewhere. We were there for lunch and were seated pretty quickly. We ordered relatively quickly too...and then sat there for 30 minutes waiting for the food to come out...and when it did it was not up to snuff.   One of our party had the Butternut and Blue Cheese salad...no good, only a spec or two of blue cheese, and not much else other than a stray walnut and apple wedge to go with the mixed greens. Another in our party had the Chicken and a Doughnut...the doughnut was good but the chicken was tuff and not seasoned at all...and it did not come with the sour cream it was supposed to, and the fries were limp. Our last diner had the Pot Roast with an Egg sandwich...the pot roast slivers were fair and the egg was an egg...the cheese slices on top were never melted into the sandwich...all of which was lost in mounds of barely toasted bread. All in all a disappointing meal. After being served we had to call the waitstaff to bring us some forks and knives which were not on the table...they also never came back to ask if we needed anything or to refill any water or tea. I think they knew they blew the meal, so they just gave up and left us to our own devices.  This is a breakfast place first and foremost and maybe we erred in not sticking with breakfast...we strayed into the brunchy stuff. They had a creative list of items - as you can see from our choices - but they didn't deliver. Maybe they should spend a bit more time on delivering what they promise instead of the cutesy artsy menu listings. Just my opinion."}
{"text":"Probably the best brunch place in Madison downtown. It's usually busy so be prepared to wait for at least 20-30 minuets. But it's worth it. We ordered chicken and biscuit with corn gravy, coconut cream pie french toast and eggs benedict. We loved the chicken and biscuit (probably the most popular dish on the menu) and the French toast was delicious. I'm usually a fan of eggs benedict but I didn't like it much this time.   Overall Bassett Street Brunch Club is a must visit place for brunch."}
{"text":"Of course this place was busy at Noon on Sunday. We were told that it would be a 45 minute wait. They were not kidding. It ended up being about an hour. We didn't mind because it was our first visit and we heard from friends that it was worth the wait.   After we were seated, a manager came to our table and gave us 3 donuts, apologized for the wait and comped the donuts. #Yes #ThankYou #AwesomeSauce  We started off with the Chicken & Donut (if you aren't vegetarian/vegan/pescatarian---you MUST get this). It was heaven in my mouth: fried chicken on top of a glazed donut with a plate drizzled with honey and a sriracha sour cream sauce.Every bite was mouth watering and I didn't want the taste/feeling to go away. I was sad when we finished this plate.  So my friend ordered the breakfast nachos. He said it was great, but it looked okay. I probably won't ever order it.  I ordered the savory french toast with potatoes instead of the micro greens. The french toast and bacon were good with the egg. It was super filling.   Again...get the Chicken & Donut (it's listed under appetizer).   Drinks were also VERY strong (spiked horchata and berry smoothie).   Worth the wait, seriously."}
{"text":"By far the best restaurant in Madison! Great food and great service! Food is fresh and has bursts of flavor. Serving staff is kind and polite and just makes you feel comfortable at home. I highly recommend everyone tries this place!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite brunch places in Madison. I've gone here a few times over the years and it has consistently been enjoyable! If you choose to come on the weekend, expect a wait. Every time I've came here on a Saturday or Sunday there has been anywhere from a 30 minute to an hour and a half wait.   One of the coolest things is that they make their own donuts, and they're very reasonably priced ($1.50 each). This week I tried the espresso cream cheese donut and it was delicious!   The first time I ever dined here.. I sat on their patio and had a spicy Bloody Mary .. and let me tell you.. the skewer of refrigerator pickles that come with it are sent from heaven. Sounds silly, but give them a try and you'll know exactly what I'm talking about.   This week I had the farmers hash and it was phenomenal. It came with a generous portion of Brussels sprouts, parsnips, sweet potatoes, and onions, topped with two eggs over easy and two pieces of sourdough toast. I am a fan of vegetable breakfasts so this did not disappoint! Their menu offers a selection of classic breakfast options as well as unique and healthy options. If you're a French toast fan they have amazing sweet and savory options.   Also an FYI.. you get a two hour parking voucher for the Hampton Inn and Suites parking ramp when you dine here! Which is very nice because there is no street parking outside the restaurant."}
{"text":"There are a lot of places that once I find something that I like, that's all I order. BSBC is a rare exception where I take pleasure in trying something different every time I'm in. This time I landed on the lemon ricotta pancakes.   Three thin but dinner plate-sized pancakes arrived with a healthy dose of blueberry compote and a dollop of whipped ricotta that had started to melt from the heat of the pancakes. The blueberries were flavorful and the ricotta added a nice touch of sweetness. The pancakes were tasty, but they were lacking the punch of lemon I really wanted.   One of my dining companions ordered the TV Dinner special which was sesame chicken. It looked amazing and was adorably served on a segmented tray and included garlic rice and a strawberry puff pastry dessert. I tried a bite of the rice and it was incredible. I would buy it in bulk if I could. They should most definitely build a dish around it.   To start the meal we tried the blueberry cheesecake donut. I've had a couple different donuts from Bassett Street Brunch Club, and while I know that's their thing, I just don't care for them. The texture is drier and breadier than I prefer. Kudos on the interesting flavors, but the bulk of the donut just isn't for me.   Special shout-out for our server, John. He was funny, attentive, and totally game for any request and feedback thrown at him. I'll keep my fingers crossed for him on future visits."}
{"text":"Absolutely delectable. By far my favorite place to eat in Madison for any meal. I will definitely miss this place when I move  in the next month. Any other breakfast place is a disappointment after having eaten here. Just read the menu- every food description just gets better and better. Every single item I've had on the menu is made to a T. You can really see the pride this business takes in its menu as well as its customer service. Even the drinks are to die for. Very impressive menu even to a food snob like me. My dog enjoys the outdoor area and the bowl of water offered on hot days"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Server/bartender Jeremy was  incredible in beer knowledge and food recommendations.  Just an all around incredible experience!"}
{"text":"Loved it. We came on a Saturday morning looking for a table for 4. The place was already crowded and we were told it would be about 40 minutes but was really less than 30. While waiting we got some specialty coffee they make there and shared one of their maple bacon donuts. Very friendly staff, super good service and big menu of very tasty brunch breakfast things. I had some kind of french toast dipped in a Parmesan cheese with bacon and sunny side eggs with these tasty grilled onions with a little Hollandaise. Others had the coconut cream pie french toast, the toastest with the mostest and everything was reported excellent. Prices reasonable but expect a fairly long wait on the weekends. Although the place is connected to a Hampton Inn that is cool with you hanging out in their lobby while you wait. Totally worth finding."}
{"text":"In the midst of an awful hangover, I got the savory French toast and a spiked horchata and it changed my life.   Good service, great food and a very cool setting make for a perfect \"morning after\" hangout.   Can't recommend their \"wake up calls\" menu enough."}
{"text":"This place can get busy on a weekend for brunch and I understand why.  Great selection of food items and beverages, PLUS donuts, my own personal weakness.  They offer lots of gluten-sensitive options and lots of vegetarian options as well which is great for this mostly vegetarian, gluten-sensitive gal.  But, don't judge, I got a donut too because I don't have all-out Celiac so I still risk gluten occasionally.  It was worth it!  It was a busier than usual Sunday morning.  Three of us at 9 am would have waited an hour for a table but luckily we scored seats at the bar.  Better Bellini and Bloody Mary's in hand we perused the menu.  I had the Spring Break Diet: rice and beans bowl with avocado, scrambled eggs, salsa, cheese.  It was surprisingly bland, even when I asked for extra salsa.  I realized later that a little salt was all it needed.  The leftovers I ate for dinner that night with a little salt and my own salsa were much improved from the original dish.    My friends tried the burrito and the breakfast nachos.  All three of us left with a doggy bag so no complaints on the generous portion sizes.  The bartenders we pouring generously too and fairly attentive given how busy they were.  Two of us left with donuts as well.  YUM.  The restaurant is a big open space with tables on one side and a bar at the other so it gets pretty loud and chaotic.  I don't mind that in a brunch place but if you're looking for something soothing and intimate this place probably isn't for you.  Parking is tricky.  If there is space available you can park in the adjacent hotel lot and get your ticket validated at the restaurant but that's highly unlikely on a Saturday or Sunday morning.  Your best bet is the Overture or Carroll Street Ramps.  It's a bit of a hike from Carroll street ramp but I just consider it extra calorie burning for that donut going home with me.  Personally, I'll be back.  There are several menu options I want to try and, or course, I need to try all the flavors of donuts!"}
{"text":"Our breakfast was excellent.  The lemon ricotta pancakes were truly inspired.  Unfortunately our waiter-- while friendly-- was too busy eating, chatting with other waiters, and generally goofing off, so our service was sub-par."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this restaurant based on the reviews on Yelp. Unfortunately, my experience with it was not a positive one, as there was not a single aspect of my order where the Bassett St Brunch Club served me correctly the first time.   I ordered their steak and eggs done medium with sides of toast and bacon. How anyone can justify serving sunny side up eggs without toast is beyond me, but evidently that's a thing at this venue. When my meal arrived, it was served 1) Later than the other orders at my table 2) Without either of the requested sides and 3) With a steak so over done that it couldn't even pass as \"well done.\" The chef had managed to cook every ounce of moisture from it. Forget 'light pink', this thing was stringy and ash gray! The egg was also prepared over easy instead of sunny side up.  While they did eventually (30 minutes later) correct all of their errors and comp the ticket, I can't see myself rating them any higher than I am. What a disappointing experience."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped in for brunch during a short midweek getaway . I got the CYC Omelet (with goat cheese instead of feta) and the main squeeze got the Brunch Club Omelet. The omelets were the freshest I've ever had, they weren't greasy, and the ingredients were nice and crisp. I honestly preferred the Brunch Club omelet to my own, it was far more flavorful (most likely due to the meat). They both came with little green salads on the side that were acidic and a good way to cut the fat of the eggs. We also got a side of bacon and sausage. I wasn't too impressed, they both tasted like the Hampton Inn next store sent over the leftovers from the continental breakfast. (Though I love that sausage)  The atmosphere was very chill. We hung out for a couple of hours while we planned our day and our waitress didn't seem to mind, though we were there on a weekday. I really love the fun menu options and the high energy staff, I look forward to returning the next time we're in Madison...and trying, like, every donut!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE. Except that its always busy, and they don't take reservations. But can you blame them? The dishes are diverse and delicious. The bloodys are good. The outdoor seating is great for bringing dogs, and the indoor bar is wide and fairly private if you don't want to wait for a booth. And I haven't even had the doughnuts yet.  My favorite brunch spot in town."}
{"text":"A solid 3.5 but I can't believe YELP seriously waited for one of us to put the place on the Map.   I've been meaning to write a review just so I can check in. Oh well~  This place is the \"Bees Knees\" in my fam.  I'm not a breakfast person so I appreciate brunch or any place that serves breakfast alongside every other possible and feasible option so I'm not stuck eating what everyone else wants but I can't fathom.   ABOUT BSBC - it works to have something of this standard on campus. It really matters. I forget to go to the Hotel restaurants sometimes but this place stands out like the old school \"Diner\" photo that everyone tries to replicate on tv and in the movies. Anywhoo~ the large glass windows are akin to Graze on the Cap Square.   The location is at the right crossroad of campus and downtown.  Not to far so we can walk but close enough to the events if you've got tickets to something.   I hope this place last so I can show my mom and really give a review."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. I went here with my sister for my birthday (I was working nights) and had one of the best Bloody Mary's ever. They had so many great options for breakfast that I had a hard making a choice.   I will be going back here and the bartender/server we had was great. Very social and we had a good conversation talking about drinks and food. I really enjoy the right amount of interaction from my bartender/server.   I have not tried this place at night so I'm not sure how it will be, but sure the same."}
{"text":"Positives: Prompt and friendly service and a clean, airy atmosphere. Broad selection of options for breakfast and lunch, and good coffee. Negatives: The quality and flavor of food was mediocre. For example, the house-made donut had a rich creamy filling, but was too doughy.  My verdict: I won't be in a hurry to return, but would be willing to try another item if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"One of my new favorite brunch spots. I went around 11am last Saturday and the place was absolutely packed. The wait was 45mins or the bar was seat yourself. I definitely recommend waiting for your table near the bar as seats opened up about 10mins after we got there. We had mimosas and the frozen screwdriver - both were great.. The menu is unique, they have omelets, pancakes etc. but all of the items have some sort of unique twists. I had the \"spring break diet\" which was essentially huevos rancheros but served with corn tortillas, black beans and brown rice. I was completely stuffed when I left and still had a huge box of leftovers. They have a ton of gluten free options as well which is always appreciated and the service is great. Parking is limited so expect to have to park elsewhere."}
{"text":"Big fan of the lemon ricotta pancakes!"}
{"text":"Wonderful for a donut and coffee stop. Also great foods. Even some fun drinks, if you are going for more of a boozy brunch. Be sure you get a donut no matter what tons of options ranging from normal to kind of odd flavors.  If you are going to stop in for coffee on the reg make sure you have the punch card, every 4 coffees gets you one free!"}
{"text":"While the food is decent, the host and staff were rude and let their friends jump in the wait line for seating. Avoid there on weekends as its uncontrolled chaos reminiscent of a frat party."}
{"text":"BSBC has an inviting and cozy atmosphere and benefits greatly from its convenient location near the UW campus. When I was a student, BSBC was the place to go for brunch and boozy breakfast cocktails. After visiting several times and giving it many chances, I just can't get on board. The menu is so creative - a variety of sweet and savory brunch options, fun brunch cocktail ideas, and crazy-creative donut flavors. Unfortunately, I've never been impressed with any of the dishes I've ordered, and find that they usually fall short in ways that make me shake my head...like basic seasoning, expected cooking execution, and flavor combinations.   The only dish I do really like at BSBC has to be the lemon ricotta pancakes - they're comforting, flavorful, and generously portioned. Though, they were near burnt one of the times I got it. This is what I mean - falling short in ways that should be inexcusable for a nice restaurant.   The drinks that I've tried there are usually too boozy? I mean, they taste like straight alcohol, which maybe is OK as a college student, but now I just think it's a shame, since the drink flavors *sound* interesting, but end up only tasting like cheap vodka or whatever they use.   Also their donuts - what they elevate the most - are not for me. They are just inconsistent...sometimes I've had a really bread-like, dry donut, then other times the donut is sopping in oil. I'll pass.  Overall, I really never return, because it's always packed with college kids...and I'd prefer not to wait for food that is a total hit or miss. There's better brunch in Madison, in my opinion."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this place for the first time yesterday.  We had the beer battered asparagus starter (which was phenomenal and contained a very addicting dip), the farmers hash (which was so so), the Savory french toast (which was very good), and a piece of strawberry cream pie (which was good but VERY sweet).  Service was very good, wait time was reasonable given that it was a Sunday afternoon.  The server forgot to put the pie on the bill and comped it when we brought it up, which we thought was a nice touch.  Overall, I would definitely go back.  Only didnt give it 5 stars because although I loved the appetizer (whatever the dip that came with the asparagus was, I ended up adding it to the rest of my meal... until it ran out, which was probably a good thing since my husband said I was going to get a heart attack), the main meal and dessert were decent but not amazing."}
{"text":"Basset Street Brunch Club is a great centrally located place to grab brunch in downtown Madison.  Since it's connected to a hotel it offers free parking which is uncommon downtown!    I will say that weekend brunch is usually a 30 min. to an hour wait depending on what tim you go!  If you like your sleep, you will be waiting!    I will say my only complaint is that the menu is very meh.  Nothing super exciting but everything always comes out good."}
{"text":"Very tasty and diverse brunch options. You'll have to fight suburban breakfast searchers and college students alike to get a table on weekends, so plan to wait.  That said, the food and service is quite good. You can park in the adjoining hotel's lot and wait in their lobby before you get a table.  Their bento box was really cute and quite yummy for someone not wanting the standard brunch of heavily sweetened waffles or the simple bacon and eggs.  And...doughnuts."}
{"text":"We have been wanting to go to this place since it opened and it did not disappoint. Every time we have gone for brunch it was so packed and wait time for over an hour. So we went for dinner on a Sunday night instead. Plenty of tables, awesome service and delicious donuts for dessert."}
{"text":"One of the best brunch spot in Madison! I've been here twice now, the first time I had breakfast and donuts to go. I came here for the second time just to pick up donuts because I couldn't go home without grabbing some to go. Their maple bacon donut is to die for!"}
{"text":"Finally got to eat at Bassett Street Brunch Club after hearing rave reviews about the place, and boy was it worth the wait! The menu has a lot of fun and unique options--much different than you'll find at any other place. I had the Crème brûlée Oatmeal which was amazing and like nothing I've ever had before. Madison has quite a few good breakfast places, but BSBC definitely stands out as one of the best. Can't wait to try it again next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Always a treat to come to BSBC, their savory french toast is UNREAL. Some of their dishes are a bit of a stretch, but overall a great place for any meal."}
{"text":"Great breakfast with large portions. Had the carnitas hash which was awesome. Service was quick even though they were busy. Arrived bed at 9:15 on a Sunday morning and was seated quickly even though we had a group of seven.  Staff was polite and served us quickly. Coffee was great and they kept our mugs full.  Will come back for sure."}
{"text":"Prices are too high, but a decent standard breakfast. I'd probably recommend trying Mickie's for value first, and HotelRED's Café Red or Marigold Café for high quality food. If you're looking for pancakes, go straight to Short Stack, and for donuts, straight to Greenbush Bakery. All are within a two-mile radius.  Bassett Street only comes a bit above chain places like IHOP or Denny's, but its location and aesthetic place it as a passable brunch for the cost and location."}
{"text":"Damn, this place was good. So.  Good.  Freshly made donuts. Check. Collectivo (local) Coffee.  Check $3 mimosa's.  Check. Unique and yummy brunch food.  Check. Full bar. Check. Awesome music.  Check.  Everything about this place was amazing.  Service.  Food.  Atmosphere.  And I loved the music selection.  Seriously, if you're in the area, stop here for brunch.  Highly recommend a fresh donut + Savory French Toast.  The french toast is sourdough bread dipped in a parmesan cheese-herb batter and topped with bacon,  grilled onions, a sunny side up egg,  and hollandaise. SO MUCH YES."}
{"text":"Menu has lots of good options it was hard to choose! Went with the lemon ricotta pancakes which didn't disappoint! Only complaint is service was sub par (somewhat timely but not the most friendly)."}
{"text":"Great menu! Ham sandwich was best thing and the brunch menu is amazing!! Highly recommend for a stop if in Madison and if you are gluten-free they are very accommodating!"}
{"text":"Great place! Great prices! Definitely come here at least once to see what it's like. I've tried the chicken on a biscuit and the chilaquiles for breakfast, and a chocolate long john for dessert. Everything tasted just as good as it looked on the plate. Left feeling quite full. Coffee was also pretty good too. Only reason I didn't give this a 5 star was the lack of a \"bottomless cup of coffee\". Rock solid overall tho!"}
{"text":"I am a sucker for breakfast food. Especially breakfast carbs. So this place had piqued my interest on that fact alone when I searched \"breakfast at 8 pm\" on yelp in Madison WI.   Having been indecisive about dinner and finding ourselves hungry at 8 pm on a Friday night, we decided on Basset Street brunch club. We walked in, the restaurant being about halfway filled at this time, and were greeted and immediately seated. Being the carbaholic and general bottomless pit that I am, we opted to try the poutine. The fries were warm and I think the gravy was lacking in terms of seasoning and overall cohesiveness to the sauce itself, it could have been better.  I ordered the  lemon blueberry ricotta pancake and the bf ordered the eggs benedict. I've had great pancakes before. I've made great pancakes before. But I can honestly never say Ive had a pancake make me want to immediately go home and try to create the magic of this pancake. The lemon was subtle and the blueberries not too syrupy/sugary. The BF said the eggs benedict were good; I was too immersed in my carb fix to notice what he had going on.   We got in, we got out. I think that if this was another food fight restaurant that was just downtown, this concept wouldn't work. But as it is on the ground level of a hotel, and across the street from another hotel I have a feeling this will continue to be what works for this restaurant. We got in, were fed, were treated courteously. The price was about on par for any other similar restaurant (9-14 per entrée).   There are more unique places in Madison that I love (and prefer) but it can be awfully hard to find great breakfast food during dinner hours. So for that, you get my 4 stars."}
{"text":"I ate at BSBC numerous times during my two-week stay at the Hampton Inn connected to the restaurant.  On my first visit, I came on a Friday morning for a working breakfast. I ordered a tall glass of Iced Coffee, which was even more delicious when I saw they did not charge me for the additional glass to-go.  In usual indecisive fashion, I turned to the waitress for a recommendation, and she suggested the Chicken & Biscuit.  It sounded delicious and I was famished, so I was on board.  To satisfy my sweet tooth, I also ordered one of the donuts I'd heard so much about.  When the food came out (quite promptly), I was MMMMM-PRESSED. Presentation was excellent and the chicken & biscuit was even better than it looked. The only reason I couldn't give this visit 5 starts was the donut.  Maybe my expectations were too high, but it was a bit of a disappointment. The chocolate icing and hazelnuts were sadly atop a dense, oily, ring of bread that I could hardly eat half of.  I still came back several additional times during my stay, and the food was always the highlight (see other reviews).  If you're looking for a great meal (especially when it comes to breakfast options) this is a sure bet!"}
{"text":"Great place. Quality food and coffee. Try the Chicken and Donut. It's an app but plenty."}
{"text":"BSBC was a pleasant surprise for my partner and I. We ate brunch there the afternoon of the Pride parade, and expected a wait for a table, but found plenty of seating at the bar and outside to occupy us while we waited for a table.  Their menu is varied and interesting, and a thrill for me because there are *numerous* gluten-free options available to choose from. Our server was kind and attentive, and very good with menu suggestions when we asked for advice.  Due to a mistake with the food runners, we were accidentally given non-GF meals, and when the mistake was realized (almost immediately,) they notified us of the issue, had proper, GF meals out to us, and ended up comping our entrees without being asked. It's RARE to see that much respect and attentiveness for food allergies when eating out (I've normally just gotten an \"oops, sorry\" and nothing more at most places!)  If you're expecting greasy, overrated diner food, prepare to be pleasantly surprised. You might have to wait a bit for a table, especially during busy times, but it's well worth the wait.  I'm looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"When a group of friends and I look for a place to go to dinner I always suggest going here. They accommodate large groups very well. The wait is never too long and they have a nice area in the hotel next door to comfortable wait.  The food selection is good but nothing ever sticks with me. I can never find something to eat I really LOVE, but I do suggest the horchata because it's delicious."}
{"text":"I wasn't aware this was a Food Fight establishnent. If I had known that, I probably wouldn't have stopped here.  But, I'm glad I did!   Brunch was great! The food was mediocre at best. The menu looked like there was a lot of themed \"fusions\" happening, but nothing that was consistent. We ordered the American and Hangover omlete. Both were edible and decently presented.   What really put this over the edge for me was our server. Clearly they were busy, but our server was polite, attentive, friendly and knowledgeable. Her greeting to us was, \"good morning. We have donuts and mimosas.\"  On a lazy overcast Saturday? Those are the perfect words."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm biased because anywhere that serves breakfast all day already gets extra points in my book.  Either way, everything I've tried here is fantastic. The Eggs Benedicto is one of the more unique versions of egg Benedict I've tried. The bacon maple donut is brilliant. I also really like the savory French toast, biscuit and sausage gravy, breakfast burroti and the boozy smoothie.   They're super nice here and I've had really good service. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a late-afternoon brunch on Sunday. We were told there was a wait, but an attentive hostess watched the lunch counter for us and came up with two seats in half the promised time.  I ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes, which where the moistest, fluffiest, best pancakes that have ever been in my mouth. The lemon ricotta topping and blueberry jam were sweet, tart, and delicious. Both tasted homemade.  My companion ordered the corned beef hash, which he rated as good but it seemed to be the same recipe that Monty's (also Food Fight) uses.  The doughnuts and pastries floating around looked delicious and there were a wide variety available."}
{"text":"Dude. If I lived in this area, I would be here every. Single. Day. (My waistline and wallet are very happy I don't.) My husband and I both ordered pancakes- I got the banana nut pancakes, he got the one with coconut and fruit. And let me tell you, my taste buds were singing. The coffee was great as well, had a little bit of a bitter kick to it. We topped it all off by getting the candied bacon maple donut. Were we disappointed in this choice? Nope. Definitely not."}
{"text":"We sat down at the bar and got our food an hour later, after finally being asked if we were okay (not by our actual waitress). Food that arrived was mediocre and hardly worth the hype. A couple of waitstaff attempted to remedy the situation but the worst part was, as soon as our original waitress knew there was a problem, she chose to ignore us completely until we left. Wow.  Honest food review - biscuits were dry, wasn't offered a choice of egg style on the savoury toast so ended up being a soggy mess, cocktails were sub-par for $6, potatoes were uninteresting and clearly made en mass to account for the breakfast crowd."}
{"text":"Bassett Street Brunch Club is a place I can see myself becoming a regular at. The staff, from managers to bartenders, are an absolute blast. Some of the friendliest people in the Midwest, and that is saying something.   The menu will surprise you like the movie The Prestige, which is literally about surprises. BSBC has incredible tater tots, creative cocktails like a spiked Horchata, and gourmet doughnuts. Three words: Bacon-maple-doughnut."}
{"text":"Donuts, breakfast and robots. Need we say more?  Well, yes, since this is a review I must mention the \"spring break diet\" is really my favorite dish here. Good for vegetarians. Donuts are good, but seem fresher some days than others... Guessing it depends when you're in there? Mornings might mean fresher donuts?  But most other dishes I've tried have been delicious. Fish fry was good as well and I might say, the portions are quite generous for everything so be prepared for some leftovers. While you're at it, enjoy the colorful illustrations."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! The food is great and creative, their drink menu is very extensive, and their doughnuts rock. I have only ever been for brunch, but their diner hours make it possible to go in for a late night drink or snack. One drawback is that there can be a substantial wait on weekend days even though they have a good amount of seating. However, the hotel lobby the restaurant is connected to is super comfortable and they will validate your parking."}
{"text":"Came for breakfast twice last week while visiting from out of town.  Admittedly I had the same thing both times (cyc omelet), but delicious.  Coffee was good, service was great and parking at the Hampton Inn is super easy.  Have already recommended to my family in Madison!"}
{"text":"I love when I walk into a place--I read the menu for 10 minutes-- and I STILL can't decide....  (Because there are THAT  many DELICIOUS sounding items) Brunch club is awesome with so so SO many options to decide on. My friend and I split a couple items and we loved EVERYTHING!!!  Kid friendly. Yet booze friendly....Wait staff was amaze-balls and I loved that I could bring back some yummy donuts for my husband (the maple bacon was our favorite!)"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time last Sunday and loved it! I got the fried chicken on a biscuit which is so much more than just fried chicken on a biscuit. It was topped with egg and this delicious corn gravy. Drooling, thinking about it rn. Definitely want to come back and try more on the menu. Everything sounded great! I'm already imagining that coconut French toast...(drooling again)."}
{"text":"Honestly, one of my favorite restaurants in Madison. You can't go wrong with any of the menu items - I've had everything from the Cyc omelette (who would think a salad would pair so well with eggs? And the omelette was perfectly cooked) to shakshuka and I've never been less than thrilled with my food. The coffee is also delicious and well brewed.  My only complaint is the wait time, which is entirely out of the hands of the the restaurant. It's just so overwhelmingly popular you may end up waiting a long time for a table. You're much better off going on a weekday mid morning if you really don't like waiting. Alternatively, just go with friends/family you don't mind conversing with and make the most of the wait time - the food will definitely be worth it once you're seated and you've ordered!"}
{"text":"Have been here a ton now! Always have great service, even when they are jam packed. They never make you feel rushed and are happy to help make your meal better! Would highly recommend, just be prepared for a wait during their busy times (typically brunch Saturday and Sunday)"}
{"text":"Awesome brunch place right underneath Hampton Inn! They get extremely crowded around the brunch hours (11 AM-12 PM), so come prepared to wait a little. If you're eating by yourself, they have quite a large amount of bar space, so that's always a nice option!   This place has a cozy diner feel, but their food is quite a bit better than what you'd expect from a typical diner. I feel like most of the lower reviews are due to the long waits. Their service was a little spotty due to their popularity, but in general I would vote this place as one of the best brunch places in Madison."}
{"text":"Over priced. Bland food. Creative yet oh so blah drinks. Low staff morale. Slow bar.   Eh. I'll head to quick trip."}
{"text":"Avoid this place like the plaque.  We had a party of eight that was told we would have a table in 20 minutes.  An hour and a half later we still had no table.  After listening to the hostess's drivel about how she and her crew were having a rough day, we almost left. We stayed only because the three college students in our group insisted the meal would be worth the wait.  15 minutes later we were told that they could seat us, but only if we agreed to break up our party and split into two groups of four. After waiting patiently for an hour and 45 minutes, we felt that we had no choice.  As for the food itself, McDonald's on its worst day was better.  The omelettes were under-cooked, the three strips of bacon were chewy and the breakfast sandwiches were tasteless. This was surprising since it took them 45 minutes to serve both parties which was consistent with how they treated us when we put in our names for a table.  I will admit that the apple donut was fabulous and I liked our waitress, but unfortunately both were exceptions to our bad experience.  This place has a captive audience because of its location on campus and the lack of other breakfast options in the area.  My advice is if you have a car drive to the west side of Madison and stay clear of this place. Admittedly, the restaurant has great potential, but I won't waste another three hours wondering if today's debacle was an anomaly."}
{"text":"Dined here for breakfast on Sunday morning with a friend of mine. We got there at 8:15 and it was relatively quiet. Not for long however. We had bloodies right away and they were fantastic. We sat at the bar and the bartenders were polite and attentive as they could have been considering we literally watched this place get packed with people and people waiting for a table. It was unbelievably busy by 9 am, so get there early unless you want to wait over an hour for a table. So, the food. My friend ordered the eggs Benedict which I didn't try, I had the chicken biscuit with gravy and salad garnish. It was a little underwhelming. Everything was fresh and made with quality ingredients, but was a little lacking in flavor. Not bad by any means, but not exactly what I was expecting. Overall it was a pleasant breakfast experience and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good bloody and breakfast on a Sunday morning."}
{"text":"A couple of thoughts:  The menu is creative, the service is great, and the atmosphere is a fun. Unfortunately those things make this place really popular so there's a pretty long wait on Sundays if you show up any later than 10.   My partner and I got seated at the brunch counter which was great because we had the chance to check out all the food as it was coming out of the kitchen. Highly recommend - there's plenty of elbow room :)  My partner and I had-  Coffee - strong, delicious  Breakfast nachos - big portion but very good. Not soggy despite many, many fresh toppings  Savory French toast - pretty good, but honestly so much food. Almost didn't even need the egg over easy. You might consider ordering the hollandaise on the side to prevent sogginess as you power through.   Strawberry donut with (white) chocolate chips- very light and cakey. Overall delicious but I wish the chocolate chips were semi-sweet instead :)"}
{"text":"We ordered the Everything Pretzels which were a little breadier than your traditional pretzel. But you could tell they were homemade and had delicious seasoning (salt, sesame seeds, etc.) Not buttery or greasy and the pretzels came with a savory, thick cheese sauce and jam.   I had the breakfast burrito which was packed with black beans, scrambled eggs, sautéed peppers and onions. The sauce on top of the burrito was kind of a spicy mole sauce. And the burrito came with a side mixed greens salad (which I'm a fan of with heavy/large entrees).   I also had a shot of espresso con panna (whipped cream) which was a perfect way to start the morning and not fill up on a pot of coffee."}
{"text":"Everybody loves brunch, even a gigantic looming robot (which is what Bassett's interesting mascot).  My girlfriend and I stopped in for lunch to find this joint PACKED with college students. The host told us that the wait would be about an hour. Luckily, we learned that anyone can skip the line by eating at the bar and found a couple seats at the end. I like to sit by my boo-thang, anyway...  I love egg yolk on biscuits, so I could not order the Eggs Benedict? I love horchata, too, so I ordered their latte version.  Everything was pretty solid, although, I think the dish could go without the hard bacon pieces sprinkled on top. I washed my EB down with a my sweet, cinnamon-y, and smooth horchata latte. I should've gotten two!  Great and friendly service! I would definitely consider returning if I was back on campus/ my college dayz hood. Go Badgers!"}
{"text":"Love their happy hour! A great place to grab fancy cocktails and appetizers after work without breaking the bank! Very laid back place to hang out with friends."}
{"text":"I love this place to grab a coffee and a donut. Super cute inside. The menu has good items on it, but some of the menu options are a bit strange. The Service was okay."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. They're super original with their meals in a not-weird, tasty way.   Specifically, I dream about their Savory French Toast. I'm used to traditional french toast with syrup and butter; Brunch Club does it way different. Instead of syrup, the french toast is covered in bacon, arugula, some onions, and a bunch of other really tasty ingredients that work together perfectly. I wolfed it down.  As for drinks, try the iced horchata latte. You'll become addicted. Trust me. Imagine iced coffee with milk and sugar, spiced with cinnamon and nutmeg."}
{"text":"I visited on a Sunday morning and despite the hustle and bustle, got a nice spot at the bar where I enjoyed a great medium roast from Colectiv and the \"Spring Break Diet,\" which is a wonderfully fresh take on breakfast alternatives. The hostesses were really great in helping me find a seat speedily (it helps sometimes to be by yourself). The weather was great, so lots of folks were on the patio. This place is worth another visit next time I'm in town to explore more of their fab menu."}
{"text":"I visited BSBC on the final leg of a four restaurant hash crawl.  Our previous three crawl stops (Marigold, Graze and Madison Sourdough) set the bar incredibly high and while I enjoyed my visit at BSBC, the quality of the food was a step below those other establishments.    Things I Liked: * I'm a fan of the décor, a playful union of retro and modern.  The robot posters, the rotating doughnut carousels, the brightly colored booths and the old school diner counter all combine to create a cheerful vibe.  It's a fun place to be, even when the joint is slammed with customers. * The playful theme of the décor carries over to the menu, which entices patrons with meals like savory French toast, the lox box, crème brule oatmeal and double chocolate pancakes.  The same goes for the drink menu, which offers tempting libations such as boozy smoothies, slushy screwdrivers and spiked horchata. * Kudos to BSBC for allowing restaurant patrons to park free in the Hampton Inn ramp.   * The quality of the ingredients of both the corned beef and the farmer's hash was top notch.  The serving size was on the generous side.  Things I didn't: * Both my visits were during peak weekend hours and service was slow.  During the hashcrawl, it took over five minutes just to have the bartender acknowledge us (we took seats at the bar) and close to fifteen minutes to receive our drinks.  There also was a significant delay getting the doughnut ordered at the end of the meal.  On the positive side, one of the two bartenders was quite personable and did an admirable job checking in with us. * My biggest criticism of BSBC is the weak execution of the dishes.  The vegetables in both the hashes I tried lacked depth of flavor.  They needed more oven time to draw out their natural sweetness.  The boozy smoothie needed more fruit flavor to balance out the alcohol and the rye toast was bone dry and surprising bland.  I hope that this aspect of BSBC will improve with time.  Given my family's love of breakfast food and free parking, I'm sure we'll return when we're visiting the UW campus."}
{"text":"I was excited to try a new spot, as I work downtown and I'm always looking for a great go-to lunch restaurant. I was highly disappointed with Bassett Street Brunch Club. I asked for an Iced Coffee that was on special and they were out of some ingredient to make it. I ordered the Grilled Asparagus Panzanella Salad with chicken. The asparagus, when I could find any, was very hard to chew - like a hard stalk. The chicken was dry and chewy. The amount of red onion was overwhelming. The croutons were missing. The panzanella salad at Great Dane is far superior. In the end, this meal was way overpriced. An iced coffee and salad with grilled chicken was $16. I can easily get a great - and delicious - lunch for $10 somewhere else. To top it off, my companion complained about her salad and our server just said 'oh sorry you didn't like it'"}
{"text":"I thought this would be a great place for breakfast since it had great great reviews and was right next to my hotel. Unfortunately my experience was not that great. The pancakes were good, but cake topped with powdered sugar. This ruins them in my opinion. The eggs had tons of grease on top of them. The breakfast potatoes were like biting into salt blocks. I sat at the counter and saw the toast in piles waiting, getting cold, for them to put on plates. I had to ask for creamer for the coffee after my server quickly walked away and didn't come back with it. The server also didn't even ask how my food was. The water to wash hands in the restroom had one temp, scalding. The knob to adjust temps didn't seem to work. Sorry, when I come back to Madison, this will not be on my list of places to go."}
{"text":"Absolutely love your food. One of our favorite places in Madison. Great pancakes. Chicken and a donut!  Only thing keeping you from 5 stars was the night before Michigan football came to town your food was disgusting. The biscuits were hard. The donuts ran out so they put chicken and sauce on chocolate donuts without telling us. So gross. We haven't been back since. Aside from that, the previous visits were great."}
{"text":"There was a bit of a wait when I went but opting to sit at the bar cut down on the wait time considerably.  DEFINITELY get a donut. We tried both the maple bacon one and the chocolate hazelnut one. The chocolate hazelnut was good but probably something you could get at any standard coffee shop. The maple bacon one, however, is a must try. The bacon pieces were a little large for my liking and I wish they had broken up the pieces more and dispersed it on the donut more evenly but I might be being a little too picky.  Drinks are good too. The spiked horchata was a bit strong for our liking but the frozen screwdriver was perfect. It's like an alcoholic orange julius, if that's your thing.  AND THE FOOD! So many options! If you like brunch, you'll be really happy here. I know I have to go back at least two or three more times with friends so I can sample everything I want to try! I ended up getting the Croque Madame with a side of slaw, and both were very good. I probably wouldn't get it again because nothing about it screamed *special* though.  My friend got french toast, which came topped with candied pecans, chunks of banana and maple syrup. It looked amazing and tasted amazing.  My other friend got the Brunch Club omelette which she loved, clearly since she devoured it in like 10 minutes.  All in all, really good food, reasonable prices, nice atmosphere. It's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Stopped for an early morning weekday breakfast.   I had  chilaquiles. My friend had avocado toast with an egg on top. We resisted the doughnuts, although the maple bacon looked delicious.  Parking was a hassle (no spots left in hotel ramp)."}
{"text":"I got the ricotta toast, it was good and a nice variation from the usual avocado toast but I wasn't really wowed by the execution. The breakfast cocktail, \"the figgy mule\" was absolutely amazing with grapefruit and fig vodka perfectly refreshing I would have liked to order another. Coffee wonderful too and my partner ordered the savory French toast which was very tasty"}
{"text":"Fun breakfast place, great service! Excellent Bloody Mary and house omelette as well the avocado toast and pork hash. The low notes were the Guagillo burrito and the sour too light roast coffee but overall great."}
{"text":"The food is delicious!  The fried chicken and donut is definitely my favorite ! Fresh made donuts daily are definitely a must try! I would go here again. The green goddess grilled cheese had alittle to much chimichurri for my liking though. Wish they were open later in the week days!"}
{"text":"Food is very niche. Not run of the mill. The food is okay but often not worth the 2 hour wait. I've never had anything bad from here and have come back quite a few times. At the same time I've never had something I thought was amazing."}
{"text":"Every time I'm back in town to visit my alma mater, I always stop at the brunch club, despite their 1+ hour wait time during weekend brunch time. Always well worth the wait. If you love salmon like myself, get the lox box! It's a build your own on an everything bagel and it always fulfills my smoked salmon craving. Otherwise the chicken and biscuit is a good alternative if you're not into seafood. I've had one of their donuts and it was pretty good, nothing crazy special though."}
{"text":"I am definitely a fan of Bassett Street Brunch Club after four visits. Don't let it's position within a hotel turn you off - there is very good food and service to be found here. I will say that meat options are definitely better than vegetarian options, although there are some very good veggie options available. I highly recommend the Meat and Potatoes Stack - it is easily the best meatloaf I have ever had. Their donuts are absolutely delicious, and an affordable dessert option. The drinks here are also fantastic, although I usually avoid them in order to keep costs down.  My only complaint is that the kid's meals come with a prepackaged cup of Mott's applesauce. I know that this place can do better than that. The rest of the kid's meals are freshly prepared, quality food, which as a parent I appreciate - I just wish they took the extra step to make their own applesauce rather than offering packaged food."}
{"text":"Awesome unique donut variety and breakfast drink menu. Be advised you can park at hotel adjacent to brunch club."}
{"text":"The best!!!!!!! We were staying in the hotel so we visited on many different occasions ( lunch , late dinner, just drinks etc..) and every time was amazing! The service ! The food! I can't wait to visit Madison again just to come here. They even gave us free donuts because they were going to throw them out . I will try to make sure to stay in the hotel again so this place won't be far away!"}
{"text":"Got to say that it reminds you of the classic Big Boy restaurants with the Bassett Street Brunch Club, but with a full bar mixed in."}
{"text":"You know a brunch place is good if you have to order the healthy option and it still blows you away.  The \"spring break diet\" is what I wish I could have every morning for breakfast! It's served in a big bowl that's filled with black beans, brown rice, scrambled eggs, green onions, avocado, cilantro, roasted tomato ranchero salsa, queso fresco, and corn tortillas. This thing was beautiful and so good. The coffee I had alongside it was strong and also hit the spot bigtime.  This place was busy when we stopped in around lunchtime on a Friday, and I can see why. The service was excellent, and I can definitely see myself coming here again. Other items that caught my eye: the \"chicken and a biscuit,\" the breakfast nachos, and the \"toastest with the mostest.\" A bloody mary will also be happening next time.  I know the college crowd gets huge here on weekends so I'll keep my visits during the week. ;)"}
{"text":"The breakfast nachos are enormous! Our table also ordered a burger, Cobb salad, and the savory french toast, all of which were excellent. The fresh doughnuts were astoundingly good, and were fluffy like challah."}
{"text":"I heard good reviews about this place so my group decided to check it out for brunch on a Saturday morning. We were told it would be about a 30 minute wait by the hostess which ended up being close to an hour...not a huge deal as we had drinks from the bar but be prepared you may have to wait.   By the time we sat down I was pretty hungry so I ordered the Chicken and a Biscuit. We got our food quickly and the portion was pretty sizeable! The chicken, biscuit, and gravy were all delicious! The side-salad it came with was pretty boring and unremarkable but the rest was good. The chicken was crunchy on the outside and tender on the inside and the biscuit was flaky and delicious.   My girlfriend ordered the Breakfast Nachos which we both agree were just ok. The chicken was somewhat dried out and just bland overall. I would probably stay away from this dish.   The others in our party ordered the Huevos Rancheros and the Shakshuka which they said were good.   We also ordered one of their famous cake donuts which was pretty good. We are spoiled with donuts in Chicago though so our donut standards are pretty high :)   Overall, it was a pleasant experience but not overly remarkable. There seems to be a fair number of brunch places in the area so I would probably check others out before this again.  Oh and before I forget, the Mimosa was probably close to 95% orange juice which was somewhat disappointing. The Bloody Mary also tasted like mostly mix and not much vodka."}
{"text":"It was 1,000 degrees in this location. Some of the members of my party actually had to step outside in the middle of breakfast because it was so hot in this restaurant. This place was close to our hotel so our party of 6 stopped in on a Wednesday around 11am for breakfast. After waiting for about 30 minutes we were seated and ordered our beverages. Sitting in the window we all started to get over heated and waiting for an extra 30 minutes for our food did not help matters. I ordered a maple chai latte which was really rich and flavorful. I really liked this drink but regretted getting a hot drink. I then ordered the peanut noodle dish and added tofu. The sauce was a little bland on the noodles I wish it had more depth with some sort of heat added. I did add some hot sauce from the table. I liked the serving size of the dish and all the fresh veggies that were added. The service was okay the waitress was spread thin out amongst the restaurant so she was busy and gave us the wrong change while leaving. Overall this place was okay I would not stop in again."}
{"text":"This was my first stop when visiting for the Crossfit games. The food was fantastic. I had a CES omelet and my girlfriend had the lemon blueberry pancakes with ricotta. I definitely recommend visiting this eatery if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Grabbed a late dinner when staying at the Hampton.  Server was delightful.  Salad and wine were tasty, came quick. The tall booth was a nice way to have a quiet dinner at the end of a long day.   The breakfast / brunch menu looked amazing. Will give it a try earlier in the day next time I'm in Madison."}
{"text":"I went in October with a party of 10 to celebrate a birthday. When we arrived we were told they don't have any tables that will accommodate ten (six was the max) and that they would have to split it us between two tables. It seems odd that they didn't design the restaurant to accommodate larger parties but we were ok with splitting up the group if necessary. We were also told the wait would be over an hour, but it was a Sunday morning so it didn't seem to unreasonable. We ended up waiting almost THREE hours. We assumed we were waiting extra because they were trying to seat us at two adjacent tables, but they ended up seating us on opposite sides of the restaurant. The most infuriating part is that they seated several other parties of six that had arrived after us first. I felt like we were punished for having a large party.   Also, while we were waiting we decided to get some coffee and doughnuts from the bar. We went and stood in front of their bar by the espresso machine and tried to get someone's attention for about 10 minutes. They were busy, which is understandable but nobody even acknowledged us. Finally someone turned to us and said \"did you want something?\" Which was a little rude, obviously we wanted something or we wouldn't be standing here.   The food was good but the experience was ruined by having our party split, receiving poor service, and having to wait so long to be seated. Even though it was good I wouldn't go again because I was so disappointed."}
{"text":"An awesome place to hit up downtown! The food Ive had was good and basic but not amazing. What this place lacks in stellar food it makes up in ambiance, morning cocktails, donuts and service."}
{"text":"Quoted 1.5 hr wait time, which is perfectly fine for a holiday weekend. However, after being told the countertop bar in the back was for wait list guests only and finally being seated there after waiting the 1.5 hours, watching two walk-ins seat themselves next to us without being told they can sit there, was extremely unnerving considering the restaurant was still on a wait.    Service was slow without any sense of urgency to turn or clear off tables quickly.  Lack of management presence to oversee any actionable tasks of the kitchen expediters, host stand, or open tables was felt as food sat in the window for long periods of time, empty tables sat open with dirty dishes on them, and people sat waiting to pay bills.   The food was decent but not worth the headache.  Their \"donuts made fresh daily in our kitchen\" were quite the opposite and a pathetic excuse for a glazed donut.  Donuts that were barely frosted with chunks of frosting missing from once-frosted areas, had been clearly sitting in their donut cases for a few days - these weren't worth it even if they were free.   I understand that it is a holiday and the majority of the employees were probably college students, but it's still not a good enough excuse for the lack of management involvement and lack of general common sense from the employees.  McDonald's lives that reality every day and they're operating just fine.    Positives: the cool decor and the Chicken and a Biscuit dish."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best take on Eggs Benedict I have ever eaten. The Maple Bacon donut was a perfect complement. The coffee was also delicious."}
{"text":"Bassett Street Brunch Club offers a ton of unique brunch dishes. I went with a group of coworkers and we started with the donut hole/chicken finger dish. Delicious and the sauces for the chicken were yummy. I ordered the chilaquiles, which were ok; however, the chicken that wasn't covered in sauce did not have much flavor. The whole dish needed more sauce. Wouldn't order again. A coworker ordered the savory french toast, which was amazing! Totally ordering that next time. Everyone else seemed to like their food.   Service was attentive and they split the check with no problem, but the server got some things wrong (ex. I had a coffee on my bill and didn't order coffee, something else wrong with someone else's check) and it took them a LONG time to fix it.   Will definitely try it again!"}
{"text":"Well, another truthful review removed by Yelp. I went back here and had a few cocktails just to make sure my first experience was accurate. OK? Again: obviously chaotic management and service, and overpriced. The Bloody was good, but nothing special. Two stars just for being served at all. Thanks again, FF."}
{"text":"I'm not clear why this place is so popular, but it is - meaning both times I've been there, it's at least an hour wait. Their breakfast items are the most unique on the menu but I was not overly impressed with how they tasted. I got the feeling that this is a place where people like to be seen while trying to fend off their hangovers. That customers are there because this place has been designated one of the trendy places to be. The service is not good, most likely because the place is too busy to know which end is up."}
{"text":"I had a great birthday breakfast here! Our waiter was really nice, and helped my fiancé pick out a tea to help with his raspy throat after a bad cold. He also surprised me with a pb&j donut with a candle in it! THE PB&J DONUT WAS UTTER MAGIC.  No problems with accidental meat in my vegetarian meal here this time. I ordered the eggs benedicto and asking for the meat to be taken off was no problem whatsoever. Thank you for that! It was so delicious; I was surprised the pesto and sun-dried tomato worked so well with the cheesy hollandaise but there you go. Derek had chicken and biscuits and said they were tasty and loved the crispy. :)  Still pretty annoying to have the sun in our eyes so badly, but oh well. I just hope I don't end up here with a terrible hangover someday!  Thanks for a great way to start off my birthday, Brunch Club!"}
{"text":"Was a little hesitant going to Basset Street Brunch Club and not ordering breakfast but I was not disappointed! Both The Mother Clucker and the Pastrami Reuben was full of flavors and filling. Once again proving Basset Street Brunch Club is one of my favorites in Madison."}
{"text":"The good things were the flexibility to substitute within the entree (ex: breakfast potatoes and fries) and that we were slightly compensated for our poor experience. My friend found two large egg shells on her eggs over medium and my Benedict eggs were completely cooked through. I personally did not like the pesto on the eggs Benedict either as the ingredients were not ground small and often interrupted the meal as I had to remove large seeds or greens - but that ultimately is a personal preference. Not a terrible place but won't be returning as there are much more and better brunch spots around madison"}
{"text":"Good food, awesome service! Our waitress was fantastic! Totally put up with us after a few drinks. I recommend the donuts for sure. Chicken and s biscuit was delicious."}
{"text":"We came back here for brunch on a Saturday, and it was crowded but we got seated right away at the bar. I'm not sure if it's cause we were at the bar, but service was so much better. Our bartender checked in on us frequently and made sure we had everything we needed. I ordered the mother clucker (a grilled chicken sandwich) with fries and a mimosa. The food was good and  very filling. My favorite thing from here might be their spicy bloody Mary... I'm not a tomato fan but it was delicious! Thank you to Alex who took the time to read my review and to generously invite us back. This is definitely a place I'd come to for really good drinks and a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"After wanting to try this place for eons, I finally went this week for dinner.  The interior was neat and interesting.  I  liked that there were different types of sitting arrangements ( from booths to counter to tables).  The night I went, the parking lot and restaurant were quite.  No complaints about getting parked or getting seated.  I know on a busy weekend morning that is not going to be the case.  I really loved the horchata latte.  I am a big fan of cinnamon.  It was sweet and creamy, everything I love.  So yes, I will be getting that again.  Would I like a bigger cup?  Yes.  But I was not dissappointed by the price of what I got.  I have poured over the menu on-line a hundred times and really wanted to try a breakfast.  But my taste buds didn't want eggs or the like.  I got the shrimp and grits instead.  First bite...I wasn't impressed.  But as I continued to eat all the flavors together, by the end, I was almost ready to lick the plate clean.  I may want to try other entrees next time but I was happy with my selection that night.  Worth a visit!"}
{"text":"I decided to stop back in since it had been about a month since my last visit and I wanted to check-in on how things are going. Well, the results were outstanding!   I started things off with the wake-up beer (a shot of espresso mixed with a glass of House of Brews oatmeal stout) which was really fantastic. I have had espresso mixed with beer once before - 2 shots mixed with pbr - which was nice, but this was just something else. It was like drinking a pint of creamy, carbonated, coffee.   For my meal I had one of the specials - biscuits and gravy with scrambled eggs and fried potatoes. The potatoes were crispy and flavorful, the eggs were... eggs (I'm not a big egg person), and the biscuits and gravy were...oh man....the biscuits.  Can we talk about the biscuits for a second? Holy. Buckets. I could just eat an entire plate of the damn things. While I may hate myself between bites, it just wouldn't matter.   Anyway, the corn and sausage gravy was great but there was barely enough of it to cover the biscuit. That was actually rather disappointing. It was so busy that I didn't get a chance to ask for more gravy before I saw my waitress again (who was great considering how swamped she was), but in the end it was still a great meal.  This spot will hopefully get bumped into my monthly rotation if for no other reason than I want to have that wake-up beer and a biscuit on the regular."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice and I deeply regret having given them a second chance.  My servers both times were excellent, and they did their best to improve my dismal dining experience, but unfortunately their free donuts just added insult to injury. I have heard people rave about these donuts. Why? They're dry and bland, just like the sad tiny lemon ricotta pancakes I ordered. How do you make dry ricotta pancakes?!? It's such a forgiving recipe, anyone should be able to make ricotta pancakes that are light, moist and tasty.  I steered clear of the sweet foods my second time there and went with a fried chicken and biscuit dish (maybe it was waffles, I don't remember, but I didn't eat much of it anyway). It was sad. Chicken was over cooked and stringy, the breading crispy but ultimately flavorless. My Bloody Mary was an abomination, essentially tomato juice with Worcestershire sauce and some pepper on top and a minuscule amount of vodka. No balance, very heavy. Bellinis weren't much better, although they were palatable.  I don't know, I honestly feel like maybe when I was there they had an off day, but I cannot bring myself to go back."}
{"text":"Friend living in Madison recommended this place. This is a slightly overdue review considering we were there during Thanksgiving and now it's already 2 months past 2016 (oops, better late than never!). We got in and there was about a half an hour's wait.  Good brunch options, good serving sizes and friendly servers. It is also a family friendly place.  I got the eggs benedict and it was flavourful and delish. My friends' food looked so good too I wanna steal bites of that but I resisted. We got a maple bacon donut to share. It did not blow my mind away - it was a little dry, bacon bits were rather scarce. A tad disappointing but the other food more than made up for that."}
{"text":"A brunch themed restaurant - of course I've been there!  What's good about this place? -Great varied menu items -Boozy cocktails -Fun atmosphere -Free coffee in the lounge while you wait -Decent prices -Downtown location  What's bad about this place? -Yes, you will have to wait -Donuts are just okay -Bloody is not my favorite - but at least it's boozy  Bassett carries on the Food Fight Restaurant reputation well.  I've had the Eggs Benedicto and Chicken & Biscuit on separate occasions. Both were very good. I usually also order a donut because I just can't help myself. In my opinion I think they are just okay. I may just be looking for that wow donut moment, and I just haven't had one yet.  Plan on waiting and get used to it! Grab yourself a cocktail from the bar or a free cup of coffee and have a seat in the hotel lobby area. The best part about their cocktails is they make them pretty boozy. This is a brunch win win for everyone. The bloody is not my favorite. Try it if you wish, but be advised that it isn't that great.   Other than that, this is a great brunch spot in downtown Madison."}
{"text":"This is a go-to for breakfast in Madison! The atmosphere is chic and hipster, with fun pictures,  hot colors, and fonts decorating the walls. The staff are all very chill and give great service, making sure to pay attention to details (like not putting tomatoes on my boyfriends meals because he hates them!!!). The specialty coffee drinks are yummy and their variations on eggs benedict are to die for!! In once instance I got my favorite eggs benedicto and found a long curly hair in my breakfast. When this happens at restaurants it's usually a huge turn off, but they made me an entirely new one and took it off the bill. My heart melted at that moment. We try to eat here as much as we can because it never disappoints."}
{"text":"I really do love this place. I was 100% skeptical when it first went in and I sort of avoided it. My mistake. There are so many things about it that make it great.   First we have the food. They have great breakfast lunch and dinner options. The food is generous with portions and they have some really great unique food pairings. Don't be afraid of a breakfast salad that features apples and bacon! And then there is always their donuts. Ugh. Let me tell you I am not sure that I have had a better cake donut. They can be at times a little greasy. But hey a fresh made donut was never expected to be lo cal. I highly suggest the chocolate hazelnut. And keep in mind that they have 50% off donuts after 8pm.   Second. They serve alcohol and have killer happy hour deals. You don't typically think head to your favorite brunch place for a dink after work but you should be!  And finally the coffee and atmosphere. Their coffee is colectivo coffee. A Wisconsin coffee roaster based out of Milwaukee and it's great. They offer bar walk up service so it's a great place to get your coffee on the way to work or class. And finally the atmosphere is just so friendly and comfortable. I have always had the sweetest servers and bar tenders. And they are totally fine with you staying for hours on end drinking bottomless coffee while you study (please be conscious of this during their busy hours though!)"}
{"text":"We went with some friends to breakfast on a weekday at 7:30 am. Needless to say it was pretty empty. The menu is large and covers a lot of ground with most things coating 9-12 dollars. There was an $11 bagel breakfast sandwich that came with egg cheese avocado. Meat was a $1.50 extra. Being one of the most expensive items we thought this must be amazing for how few and simple the ingredients are. It turned out that the bagel was dry and mealy and barely toasted and there were hardly any toppings. It was one of the most bland and flavorless breakfast sandwiches I have ever had and one of the most expensive. So confusing why this would be one of the most expensive items. Others people food was descent to pretty good I will say. What brought this down another star is that the service was soo slow. There were several waitresses working and not once did someone come and offer a refill of water or coffee until we asked at the very end. Even when we were ordering it was hard to find our waitress. Honestly you would be better off going into the free continental breakfast inside the hotel."}
{"text":"The Bassett Street Brunch Club is attached to the Hampton Inn & Suites Madison downtown and was a pleasant surprise during my trip to Madison.  There menu offerings are vast and include brunch, sandwiches, salads and dinner entrees.  They also have a full service bar and what looks to have a good selection of local beers.  Did I mention the donuts?  The donuts set this place apart from any other brunch place I have been to in years.  They are made fresh each morning and have a ton of flavors to choose from.  The décor and art was playful and fun.   It is a  modern-style diner with striped booths, white swivel chairs, and large pictures featuring donuts and robots. Fun spot, I highly recommend."}
{"text":"There are only a few all day breakfast/brunch places near State St, and this one delivers.  At noon on Sunday, the restaurant was packed, as one would expect; mostly appeared to be colleges students and families of students.  Wait was about 45 minutes, which gave us enough time to mosey over to Four Star and check out a video before returning.  The diner table and tables are seated by the host; however, the bar is first come first serve.  The bar has 2 average size TVs; it's not intended to be a sports bar, but it is enough for you to keep up with the score.   Transport & Internet: You may park in the hotel garage and get your parking ticket validated.  There is free wifi.  According to the website, there are outlets for your devices, although I did not specifically look for any.  Beverage: Ordered the horchata.  This is a smaller size and a higher price than you will see at Mexican restaurants in the area. However, I'm pretty sure this doesn't come from the horchata powder mix, and it's significantly sweeter/more vanilla-y than other horchatas in the area.  I think the super size horchata would have been too much, actually.  Donut: Chocolate hazelnut.  Risen donut with chocolate frosting and topped with hazelnuts.  Not sure what I thought of the hazelnuts, TBH: rather than chopped nuts there were quite a few near full sized hazelnuts,and I think chopped nuts are better on a donut.  Food: Lemon ricotta pancakes were very good, topped with blueberry compote and the ricotta added a nice fluff.  Also ordered the breakfast burr-roti, which is a breakfast burrito in roti rather than a tortilla. The avocado black bean salsa in the burrito is very good (you may recognize it from Bluephies), and I would recommend ordering extra guajillo chili sauce.  Service:  Weekends at noon are the busiest time for any brunch place, so I don't fault them at all for the wait. One odd thing happened is that while we were waiting for food, the waiter asked \"Can I get you a check or a donut to finish your meal?\"  Of course we gave him a \"what?\" look, given that we hadn't received our food yet. He realized that we hadn't gotten our food and said \"Oh, let me check on that\" (although we had been waiting, it wasn't unexpected given the peak time).  I also noticed that he clearly did not go to check on our order, as he went in a direction away from the kitchen and  clearly not checking with the kitchen. Why tell the customer you are going to check with the kitchen if you will not do so, as I didn't even ask him to check on the status of our order?  Overall, I can see going back here, but at the same time, it's not really stuck in my mind as a top destination on my near weekly brunch trip. I hesitated about what rating to give this restaurant, but overall I decided based on how much I felt compelled to go back here for a future meal, although a future visit may change my mind. If I were specifically looking for a place to go near State St, I would definitely head here."}
{"text":"A nice brunch and dinner place! The savory French toast is something that you wouldn't want to miss. Never disappoints me ;)"}
{"text":"Excellent food, good ingredients, stellar service, diverse menu, pleasant accommodation inside and out, great value. Can't go wrong with this place. Nice crowd. This is what most of the pretentious Chicago places should be like. Will come back here."}
{"text":"I love Bassett!!   The menu is so versatile and has something for everyone. I've had the bur-roti, chilaquiles, and the spring break diet. All are super delicious.   I also tried a couple bites of the chicken and a donut appetizer, which comes with a but of drizzled honey and siracha cream sauce. So Yum.  The decor is also really fun. His place has really grown in popularity lately, so pack your patience if you go for breakfast/brunch."}
{"text":"After many visits to BSBC, here's the low-down on all of the menu items I've had thus far: -- American Style: what you'd expect, nothing out of this world but the breakfast potatoes are definitely good! -- Cyc Omelet: my favorite savory option! The omelette is stuffed with black beans and roasted red peppers and onions and the salsa and avocado mash combo on top knocks it outta the park. Whenever I can't decide what to get, this is my fallback because I know I won't be disappointed! -- Farmer's Hash: I wished I would have liked this more, but the brussels sprouts needed to be cooked a lot more and I ended up avoiding them. I'm a fan of sweet potatoes, and sadly there weren't as many in there as I would have hoped (looming in my mind was Monty's Blue Plate Diner's sweet potato Hash which is ALL sweet potatoes and is simply the best!!!).  -- Pork Carnitas Hash: would DEFINITELY get again! The pork is very tender, and all of the flavors meshed well together. I ordered mine with eggs over easy and loved it. -- Toastest with the Mostest: Avocado option is soooo good and next time I order it I'm adding fried eggs on top! The ricotta option was meh for me. I wanted to try both, (they will let you get one of each flavor) and I wasn't a big fan of the combo of mint with the sweet ricotta and honey. Also, the dried apricots on top were very chewy and they got annoying to eat. -- Savory French Toast: Real good. The hollandaise is great, and this dish is so interesting and worth trying!  -- Spring Break Diet: I usually skip out on the tortillas and just eat the whole thing as a big breakfast rice bowl and it is so great! I also like to get poached eggs instead of scrambled so I have runny egg yolk in there. SO GOOD. I'd definitely get the Spring Break Diet again when I'm in the mood for something savory, and I heard a tip to ask for a side of the sauce that goes on the burrito which I'll try! -- Coconut Cream Pie French Toast: Amazing. -- Bananas Foster French Toast: Also amazing. -- Lemon Ricotta Pancakes: THE BEST and my absolute favorite sweet menu item! -- Crab Cakes Benedict (Valentine's  Day special menu): extremely disappointing... the crab cakes crumbled when I cut them with my fork and were dry, and the yolks of the eggs that were supposed to be poached were cooked through entirely. The chipotle hollandaise was good, but I needed more of it to cover up the dryness of the crab cakes and non-runny eggs. Would not get again. -- Red Velvet Pancakes (Valentine's Day special menu): SO good! These saved our night as we were so disappointed by our main entrée. We split the plate of three pancakes (which were very good sized) into quarters and shared them as a table and it was perfect! Great taste and wonderful whipped cream on the top!"}
{"text":"Just amazing!! I went here with 6 coworkers after a night shift on a Monday morning and all 7 of us fit in a booth! $3 mimosas as a morning special and they're very good! I had the Chicken and biscuit and it was so flavorful and perfect!! We also ordered a couple of the maple bacon donuts to split and it was so moist and full of flavor and absolutely delicious!! The only bad thing I have to say is that that downtown area has quite a bit of construction and the parking ramp for the hotel was closed so we had to park quite a few blocks away at a different ramp but that has nothing to do with the restaurant and definitely didn't affect my experience. I will making another stop there soon!"}
{"text":"CanNOT seem to stop brunchin'! There are so many good dishes here that this review may seem like a listing of sorts. I am not paid or compensated for by writing this review, I just simply like their brunch food and the atmosphere they create. If you are looking for a study space, you can order food or coffee here, sit at the bar, or sit at the adjacent lobby if you are looking for a relatively quiet area. If you are looking for a chill, out of the ordinary, place to drink some brews and/or wine, you can do it here too (whether it's in the morning, afternoon, or at night). The wait may seem daunting, but there are many places to wait, and you don't have to stay there either since they call you when your table is ready. Expect anywhere between a 45 minute to 2 hours wait on weekends. They do many things great!  I highly suggest trying the Chicken Fried Brussels Sprouts which although may be a tad bitter, the crispy buttermilk marinated and seasoned flour takes just the right amount of edge off. They also offer a variety of salads that's complimented different types of meat! My personal favorite is the cobb salad with salmon. After a long night of Wisco downtown drinking, the Hangover Hash always offers the ultimate assist. Their lox box has a really nice smoked salmon with it, not too salty and not too bland either.  Their Savory French Toast is really good. Although, I should have known better and asked for the hollandaise sauce on the side since that's not my usual favorite. BUT the parmesan crusted bread more than compensates for it. TONS of coffee choices to choose from, so take your pick! Or if you're feeling more alcohol, try their screwdriver or a Bloody Mary (I heard more alcohol sometimes cures hangovers). Lastly, top off your meal with donuts! ALWAYS share with your tablemates! This way you can try more! My favorite is the maple bacon donut! Pro-Tip: Do NOT shy away from the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes. Order it for your table and look like a pro!"}
{"text":"Very good shakshuka, cute atmosphere, friendly waitstaff, LONG waits. It's not my favorite brunch place but it's certainly quite good and well worth visiting every now-and-again."}
{"text":"I find their dishes usually quite refreshing compared to the other breakfast joints I enjoy in Madison."}
{"text":"The biscuits and gravy special I had here is easily the greatest plate of B&G I have ever had in my life. Fiancée had the bananas foster french toast and she loved it. Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"We arrived at about 2:00 in the afternoon on a week day. We waited about 10 minutes for a table (we could've been seated immediately at the bar). The decor is enjoyable. It feels lively and slightly trendy. We had great service throughout our meal.  For starters we ordered an appetizer: the Chicken and a Donut. I was slightly hesitant, but wow. This was off the hook. The freshly made donut was just right. Not too heavy or greasy, but not wimpy either. It was topped with very delicious cut strips of battered and fried chicken breast. I'm not crazy about fried foods, but this was done perfectly (especially with the ring of sriracha sauce). It was amazing.  Even though we had ordered the sweet donut as an appetizer, I still chose to order the lemon ricotta pancakes with blueberry topping. These are the largest pancakes I've ever see before. Huge, beautifully grilled pancakes. The toppings of blueberries and whipped ricotta were wonderful. Alas, after enjoying that delicious appetizer I could barely make a dent into my pancakes, I was so full.  We loved our visit and I am looking forward to visiting again, as there are many more eye catching meals and cocktails on the menu that I'd love to try. I was also happy to see that they serve Colectivo coffee. I was able to eat a delicious meal, AND drink a decaf coffee alongside it that did NOT suck.  Will be back again soon! Highly recommend trying these guys out."}
{"text":"Jacob is my favorite. The only upsetting thing was when Jacob and I couldn't hear the 80's playlist loud enough to keep jamming. But I also had a blast with Dina; did the crossword with Zach; appreciated pretty Matt; got quality time and a hug from John; admired Jack's tattoos; laughed with Max and Ben and the list goes on. You gotta love the frozen screwdriver and drool over all the brunch food. I had an amazing time here in Madison because of all these beautiful people. Thank you guys!"}
{"text":"Server was way better this time! Super nice and polite! (Thanks Jeff!) The food was even better this time as well! Love this place!"}
{"text":"I really want to like this place and I think I will eventually, but I'm not racing back after my first visit.  The BSBC has a homey feel to it, similar to a small-town diner. They have an awesome menu with both vegetarian and gluten-free options. A big bonus is my book is offering brunch all day long. Another big win in my book: they offer power outlets at all the booths.  When it came to ordering, I got the egg special of the day: a scrambler with tomatoes and queso fresco, potatoes on the side. Me and my date also tried to order donuts, their signature item, but they were out. This is where they're losing their biggest star: if you're going to put donuts all over your website, menu, and ads, make sure you have enough to at least get through brunch (we were seated around 1pm).  When the food came is was pretty good. I really liked my scrambler and the potatoes were really good. The food runner that dropped off the food seemed to be in a hurry and didn't give us the right plates, so service dropped a bit. Additionally, they serve breakfast potatoes here, and I prefer hash browns. A lot of places offer both, so it would be nice to have the option.  I really want to give this place another star or two because I think it has real potential, but I won't be running back in the immediate future. Give it a try if you're looking for somewhere new!"}
{"text":"The service was awesome but that's all the credit I can give this establishment. Our group ordered the savory French toast, chicken and biscuit and the chicken donut. I don't know what the hype is because the food was below average. The donuts were nothing to talk about. Bland food."}
{"text":"I was in town to visit my daughter, and ate here several times while staying at the Hampton Inn (just the fact that the hotel is attached to Bassett Street Brunch Club makes it the best hotel in the world, but enough about them). I can't say enough about this place; I had the best salad I've ever eaten, loved the breakfast items, and the M-F Happy Hour (great pours at great prices). I always said I would go back, but now I want to move into the place.  My daughter was pretty sick recently and couldn't get up off the couch. They swooped in to the rescue and brought her soup, even though they don't deliver and aren't really set up to do so. The best people, running a great business and going out of their way to help. I'm a huge fan - of them AND their French Toast."}
{"text":"This was a great place and I will be back.  Clean, nice decor. I enjoyed sitting in one of their 8-top booths. Very comfortable.  They have all of those beautiful windows and thankfully, they also have sufficient window treatments to block any sun that might be streaming directly onto your face.  Regardless, it was still a bit too hot in there.  Usually restaurants freeze me out, but I was borderline sweating. Friendly service.  I started with a generously sized cup of their boldly flavored coffee.  I also enjoy certain niceties such as my own mini carafe of chilled half-and half to go with it. I then had Bassett Street's version of a Mint Julep and I'd like to note that their beverage making skills are not secondary to their brunch making skills.  I ordered the Breakfast Burr-Roti.  It was quite good and it was served atop a not only beautiful, but delicious guajillo chili & sour cream sauce.  One more shout out to them for the super convenient and [usually] free parking right next door at the Hampton Inn parking ramp.  Don't forget to validate.    Even their marketing materials make me giggle.  That little robot guy \"mascot\" they have sprinkled about is cool ...in an odd kind of way. Not sure what he has to do with Brunch and I don't care. I like him.  The food photography on Bassett Street's materials is great too.  You can almost taste the photo of the raised doughnut with chocolate icing and did you ever know rainbow sprinkles could be so beautiful? These types of details make me happy.  They are reminiscent of Bluephie's marketing (also FoodFight/so not exactly a coincidence) I look forward to my next visit there.  If only they took reservations, I would have been there prior to today and I imagine quite frequently."}
{"text":"Went for brunch two days in a row. Great menu, creative, tasty dishes, large portions, great morning cocktails, cool donut art on the walls. It's loud and lively with booths and a bar.  Negatives: The celery in our Bloody Marys had dirt on them, rotten strawberry in my berry side, and one of our meals was served lukewarm."}
{"text":"I heard good reviews so I decided to head there. This place is crazily popular and you have to wait a long time to get seated. They do not take reservations.   The quality of the food is not as good as I expected. Our server was super slow and the service was not good."}
{"text":"Phenomenal brunch. I finally tried BSBC this weekend and now I understand what all the hype is about. I can't believe I didn't come sooner! I ordered the Boozy Smoothie and The Hangover omelet with breakfast potatoes.   The smoothie was strawberry vodka, banana liqueur, and a mixed berry puree. It was really delicious, but definitely not as thick as a typical smoothie, and the mixed berry puree was very seedy.  The food was incredible. The omelet was wonderfully fluffy as the menu had promised and it had generous amounts of ham, bacon, and cheddar cheese in it. It was also topped with this amazing Vermont white cheddar fondue. The potatoes were fantastic as well; they were just the right amount of crispy and very well-seasoned. It was a travesty that I couldn't finish the last couple of bites!  Overall, the place has a nice, modern interior, and the staff is very friendly. But note that if you come on a Sunday around 10 or 11 like I did, you should be ready to wait at least an hour. (So worth it though!!)"}
{"text":"It wasn't our first choice, but so glad they're one of the only places we found that was open on a Monday. We had the best brunch we could've hoped for on our one day in Madison. The breakfast nachos were delicious, as was the Eggs Benedict that my friend got. Besides the food being amazing, our waitress was incredible. Hayley took the time to chat with us about our day and gave us advice on where to go next. She even gave us donuts for the road! She is a great asset to the establishment and we greatly enjoyed her service."}
{"text":"This restaurant is really trendy and the atmosphere is bustling for weekend brunch. I had high hopes for the menu, as everything sounds really delicious. I ordered the chilequiles, but when the dish arrived, it seemed more like nachos. The chipotle sauce and chicken needed salt or spice. The dish was bland overall.   My sister ordered the savory French toast, which was tasty. It was salty from the bacon, but savory from the hollandaise and sweet from the maple syrup. Would recommend this dish.   Prices for brunch drinks are very affordable."}
{"text":"Definitely an interesting Brunch spot.  Being tucked away in a hotel I didn't know what to expect, especially given that there was the hotel's pleasant looking breakfast lounge next door, but Food Fight has another winner on their hands here.    My wife and I went during peak brunch hours and it was busy with a variety of demographics, with everyone having a good time and lots of smiling faces.  We sat at the bar due to a long wait for a table, and it paid off because our bartenders were great (more on this in a bit).  We tried the bloody mary which I thought tasted good and unique, but more of the classy variety rather than food buffet.  Then I saw the donuts.  Boy they are a marvelous site.  I'm not really a donut person, but these looked delicious and I immediately ordered one before my concious could say otherwise.  It was really really good, chocolate with sprinkled nuts, and you could tell it was freshly prepared that morning.  They have quite a few options, so absolutely indulge before your meal.  It's not greenbush level, but still a taste-tay treat.    World Cup Soccer was on TV at the bar, with just enough volume to hear and have conversation.  Job well done, an easy but often overlooked mission to accomplish.  For our entrees we ordered the Chicken and Biscuit with Gravy and the Chilaquiles.  The former was nice and crumbly with a loveable gravy to dip in that wakes up your tastebuds nicely.  Sadly, the Chilaquiles had a really poor taste, almost like an overdone Mole sauce that was over everything.  My wife really didn't like it, and I had a bite and thought the same.  Both of us love Mexican food but this was just too much neo-fusion try-hard for us.  Everyone hates to return a dish.  I rarely have ever done it, with the last time being about 3 years ago at Ha Long Bay which caused a manager to rudely berate us, try and charge us for two meals, and make a scene in the restaurant.  Mind you this is with a plate with literally one bite taken out of it.  Anyways, Bassett Street Brunch Club's bartender was a saint and deserves a medal for how she handled the situation.  \"No problem\", all smiles (genuine), friendly conversation, quickly swapped it out for a fresh dish (the spring break diet which was somewhat healthier and absolutely amazing), didn't charge us for EITHER meal, and offered my wife a free drink.  THAT is how you save a bad situation, get a huge tip, and win a customer over.  Congratulations, we will be back again, A+.  Prices in general are reasonable, and they have a good menu selection.  The parking ramp is kind of a nightmare and beware of long waits, but otherwise this is worth putting on your shortlist."}
{"text":"While the city of Madison is most certainly a metropolis of wonderfully eclectic restaurants, the town does lack in a certain category of cuisine--comfort-food. In large part, the restaurants in this capital city either fit themselves into the delineation of a trendy gastropub or a divey burger joint. Therefore when new foodie destination Bassett Street Brunch Club opened its doors this past Thursday, I was super pumped. Serving up classy spoofs on traditional breakfast dishes and diner fare all day long!!!!, the Brunch Club adds an entirely new dimension to Madison late-night. Soooo for these random moments where it's midnight and I'm craving pancakes or chicken & biscuits, it's nice to know this place has me covered.    In terms of ambience, the trendy embellishments of the restaurant all merge to devise a conclusively atypical rendition of the conventional diner. In fact, Bassett Street Brunch incorporates the swank of black leather booths with a backing of wacky-colored upholstery. The pattern is bold and the contrast is striking, yet this sense of stylistic flair is a defining feature of the space, which distinguishes Basset Street Brunch as an upscale repository for ardent breakfast enthusiasts.   The menu itself is laden with savory brunch options as well as more dessert-like breakfast concoctions, all of which are tantalizingly expressed with an aureate collection of delicious diction. The Brunch Club transforms classic comfort food into wildly-imaginative dishes the likes of a savory french toast of sourdough bread drenched in an indulgent blend of parmesan cheese and herbs, then topped with layers of bacon, arugula, grilled onions, a sunny-up egg, and a drizzle of hollandaise. Similarly delicious was the Farmer's Hash that I sampled, which was composed of a medley of roasted sweet potatoes, brussel sprouts and parsnips, all sautéed with onion and rosemary, topped with two eggs and served with a hefty side portion of rye toast. Cozy comfort-food at its best.   The more sugary items on the menu were also dangerously tempting with alluring descriptions of lemon ricotta pancakes and an oatmeal crème brulée, and that's not to mention the rotating assortment of donuts that the shop bakes up daily. And as I am quite a fanatical donut freak, I knew that I had to check these guys out. Although the chocolate, sprinkled, and peanut butter Cap'n Crunch donut varieties that I ventured to try were rather dense and lacking in the bold flavor profiles I was anticipating, I will most certainly dabble into some of their other varieties in the future.   As a whole, the addition of Bassett Street Brunch Club to Madison's repertoire of food joints was an expertly calculated decision in that breakfast at all hours is now a secured option. While the prices are a tad unsympathetic in terms of college student budgets, the ingenuity of the menu items for the most part eradicates any pecuniary hesitation with dining here. Bassett Street Brunch Club's variety of comfort-food offerings is sure to satisfy any appetite."}
{"text":"I would give it four stars, but the place is always ungodly packed. Expect more than an hour wait on the weekend if you want to get a table.  The brunch drinks are great though and prices for brunch are reasonable.  The dinner menu is also good, so if it's too packed for brunch, try dinner.  Staff is always friendly and make sure to try a donut!"}
{"text":"This place is just not good. It's trying really hard, but nothing is done well except the donuts, which are okay at best.  I've been here a few times. When they first opened, I thought it was good and the couple of times since then, I've left super disappointed.  One time I got avocado toast that honestly tasted rotten.  Today we had service that was just plain awkward, with the waitress asking what we wanted before we were even sitting down. Then just kind of being oblivious to any cues after that.  My husband got the biscuits and gravy, which he described as \"garden fresh\" and not in a good way. The gravy was full of carrots and corn, which is... not what you'd expect or want.  I had the farmers hash. The only good thing about it was the scrambled eggs on top. The rest was a mushy, flavorless pile. There were also bits of potatoes and parsnip that were still crunchy mixed in with the mush.   I don't recommend coming here, even though it looks cute. Having cute decor doesn't make up for weird service and bad food."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Friendly staff. Ask for Grace. We were hands-full and she made us feel comfortable and handled like a pro."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. I had the avocado toast and my wife had the strawberry pancakes. Both were delicious and I will definitely go again."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!  My mouth is watering just thinking about the food here.  The eggs benedicto is a nice twist on a classic eggs benedict. The perfectly cooked poached egg sat on top of an English muffin with a flavorful salsa verde and a fresh tomato slice. This was topped with a classic hollandaise sauce and candied  prosciutto. Every bite was packed with flavor, and the side of arugula was a delicious compliment to eggs.  The breakfast burrito had a delicious spicy sauce with a tasty kick that makes you want to keep eating. It was so loaded with delicious food that it's actually more like a pocket or quesadilla rather than a burrito.  Definitely add the chicken!  The only downside was having to wait quite a while to be seated, but after eating the food, I totally get why there is a wait.  The food is worth waiting for."}
{"text":"Food is the same as always- decent and over priced with a fun atmosphere but the service has tanked... almost to the point of embarrassing. Things I've never seen b4... don't see myself going back"}
{"text":"Love their savory french toast! Love their chicken and biscuit! It's really good."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Good ambience. Yummy food! We were here on a Saturday morning during summer for brunch. Very crowded - nothing new for downtown Madison on a Saturday morning but we didn't have to wait for long. I got the 'Spring Break Diet' and it was very filling! Reasonable price for the quantity of food."}
{"text":"Dinner...who knew that the bunch place was open for dinner?  Loving it.  Eclectic brunch choices served all day and into the night, full bar, funky, punky digs.  Cool.  I came in looking for something \"diner-ish\" and found it with the house cured pastrami Ruben Sandwich on marble rye.  It was tangy and juicy with a generous portions of meat, but not overstuffed and showy.  Perfect balance of meat, kraut, cheese and dressing with each bite.  Paired with the greens which were dressed with a zippy mustard vinaigrette.  The sandwich gets soggy fast from the juiciness of the meat, so don't let it sit.  Service, A-OK.  Prompt and unobtrusive.  Not super warm, but I got what I needed and and left happy.  Price was a bargain...sandwich and side was around $11 bucks."}
{"text":"One of the best brunch choices in Madison. Huge serving amount with similar price comparing to other brunch restaurants near state street/capital area. (You will see the entree sizes are way larger than donuts)  Toasted with the mostest(avocado toast) is a very healthy brunch. Two thick - cut 8 grain toast secretes with a side of mixed greens. Corn, black bean salsa, quest fresco and cilantro. (Normal menu has red onion on it, but I am not the fun of raw onion). To me, If the grain toast is little softer, it will be better!  French-toast also is served as big amount. The coconut  milk-battered challah bread is really good, not too sweet and soft. I love the mix berry, coconut cream and French toast combination.  I am not the fun of the donuts, which are too sweet for me. But the heart shape during valentine's period is so cute!   I used to try the egg Benedict, which is delicious as well. Plan to try the Fried chicken and donut, fried chicken biscuit  in future"}
{"text":"Always busy and for good reason. Staff is wonderful, food choices range from traditional to eclectic spins on classic plates. The bartenders are attentive and keep up with both those seated at the bar and walk ups. Coffee on tap for those weekend mornings with lover waits and mimosas and bloody Mary's are excellent for those so inclined. Keep it up BSBC, you guys are doing stuff right."}
{"text":"Love this place. Homemade donuts, local collectivo coffee, delicious menu, fun environment, and attentive service. Free parking at the adjacent hotel. Ask for a coffee to go at the end!"}
{"text":"My friends and I were pretty excited to come here, thinking it might be our new go-to spot for brunch, but all 4 of us were underwhelmed. First off, I had a rough time parking- my friends walked, but i had to park in what I'm pretty sure was an illegal spot to avoid being 10 minutes late. Luckily, no ticket. We also had a reservation, but ended up waiting about 15 minutes past our reserved time for a table. After that, the service was good, nothing memorable, though.  I had the Chilaquiles: Corn tortilla chips topped with braised chicken,  guajillo chili sauce, queso fresco, avocado,  jalapeños, cilantro, radish, and two eggs over easy.  It was okay, but I opted not to take home the leftovers... it didn't blow me away. Others at my table had the burrito, breakfast sammy, and farmer's hash. All said their food was okay, but nothing we hadn't had before. We probably should have sprung for the donuts, but by the time our meal was over, we were feeling a little disheartened and just felt like leaving. Seriously, we had really high hopes. It looks like the brunch club has gotten better reviews, so maybe we caught it a little too early, before they had time to work out the kinks and tweak the recipes.... I hope so. Maybe we'll try it again some time."}
{"text":"The newest addition to the Food Fight family...this little spot is a fresh urban diner in downtown Madison.  When we arrived it seemed bustling but we had a very short wait for a table and ended up in a booth.  The energy was great and service was prompt and cheery for breakfast!   We placed our order and our food was out quickly and was delish!  We started with one of their housemade donuts (flavors change daily) in chocolate hazelnut and it was very \"adult' and a great breakfast appetizer!  We then ordered the farmers hash which included brussel sprouts and sweet potatoes...a little off the beaten path but scrumptious!  We also tried their version of eggs benedict, which was outstanding!  A zesty hollandaise sauce laden with sun-dried tomatoes and topped with crisp prosciutto set this dish apart!  We also ordered a side of the aged cheddar grits topped with bacon and scallions and they were as fabulous as I was expecting...not too mushy and full of flavor.  As an added bonus they serve Collectivo (formerly Alterra) coffee and have raw sugar on the table in a shaker!  Can't wait to go back and try their other dishes...a great spot if you're looking for breakfast / brunch in downtown Madison!"}
{"text":"BSBC is one of my favorite restaurants in the city. I am a big fan of all the FoodFight spots, and this one is one of the best, IMO.   I visited here the other night with a friend, on a Tuesday. I didn't realize there was a concert happening at the Kohl Center that evening, so it was crazy downtown. LOTS of traffic, LOTS of people, and LOTS of frustration just trying to get to the restaurant. BSBC is awesome because there is an attached parking garage that you can typically park in and have the ticket validated - however, if the also attached hotel is full, and there is something big going on, the ramp is going to be full. We had to walk a few blocks once we finally found a lot with an open spot. Brrr.   Now, every time I have been in to BSBC the service has been stellar. Friendly and attentive staff, quick food delivery. This most recent time was very different. You could tell the staff was under a lot of pressure, and I don't blame them! The place was packed! We still only had a wait time of 15 minutes, though, which isn't bad!   Our server was nice enough, but not super friendly or chatty or personable.   The food was definitely the shining star of the night! SO YUMMY. We started with the everything pretzel app, it was HUGE! The two sauces it was served with were both very delicious and paired perfectly with the pretzel, despite how very different they were from each other. I had the savory french toast entree. OMG! The hollandaise was perfect. The egg was like the cherry on top. My friend had the pot roast egg sandwich which I will be trying next time I visit, it looked amazing.   Will I go back? Absolutely. Will I make sure there are not concerts happening at the Kohl Center next time I go? Absolutely, and you should too. That was a disaster."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Conveniently located close to downtown Madison. Great all-day brunch options including many low carb high protein meals. Economically priced, fresh and delicious foods. Friendly service. Indoor and outdoor seating. Nice variety of exotic specialty teas."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere; however, it can be crazy busy and there was a very long wait for just 3 people. I wish they did a better job of managing the crowd around the bar and the front door. But overall, worth the wait!"}
{"text":"If you want to go to brunch at a reasonable brunch time (10am-12pm), you are going to be waiting a long time. If you have a group of 4+, you may be waiting 2 hours. That said, it's one of my favorite brunch places in Madison. I have loved everything I've tried."}
{"text":"Great place for some comfort food!! Got the pot roast sandwich which was topped with an egg. Didn't think it would work but surprisingly it did. Place is nice and clean and waitstaff are friendly!!  Tots seem to be the thing here in Madison they seem to be everywhere I go. I also tried the Spicy Mexican hot chocolate and hazelnut chocolate donut! Hot chocolate was good but not very spicy! Donut was ok but a little greasy.   All in all I was suggest this place especially on a cold night!"}
{"text":"Love this place for the food and the aesthetic of the restaurant. Super busy over the weekends but the wait is definitely worth it! Recommend the horchata iced latte"}
{"text":"I came here for the vegan options and I am reviewing this restaurant as a vegan.  If you're not a vegan, then I'd look at other reviews.  The restaurant seemed nice and popped up as vegan friendly when I was searching for somewhere to eat brunch.  Once there, we were told there were good vegan options, however we didn't entirely agree.  Once we got there we realized that vegan options are extremely limited, especially for breakfast time, which was prior to 11am.  The waitress said they could make any lunch item we wanted since there were more vegan lunch options, however not many.  Most vegan options could be \"made\" by removing egg and cheese from the item, with of course charging us the same amount.  The place had nice staff and a nice atmosphere, however overall, I'd say that vegan items were limited and we ended up leaving and going to Monty's Blue Plate instead for better options."}
