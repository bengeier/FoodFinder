{"text":"I like the food, but am not often in the mood for such boisterous service. There is a bit of a rough feel to the place that I sometimes want, sometimes don't...

Definitely a good spot to have in the neighbourhood, though."}
{"text":"Everyone has their neighbourhood haunt and this is one of mine. 
It's kitschy, it's cool, it's unpolished and it's always a good time.

10 Feet is not for you if:
- You think that menus inside old 33s leeves are dumb.
- You think that tables and chairs from the mid-70s are silly
- You think that super-friendly service is intrusive.
- You think that drinking with the staff is \"getting too close\"
- You don't like feta on your benny.
- You don't like live music.
- You want to remain anonymous.

It's reasonably priced, super-friendly and I'm proud to be a regular."}
{"text":"I haven't been here to listen to live music. This place isn't to pleasing to the eye but it adds something to the neighbourhood which is lacking on good spots.
The food her is pretty good. They make a jerk chicken pasta that is addictive that I keep coming back for more.
Friendly staff but more so to the regulars."}
{"text":"I decided to check this place out because I heard it was pretty kid friendly and had decent food. My friend was pretty upset the weekend before when she dragged out her two kids on a Sunday for some eats and was turned away at 6:30 for closing but I thought I'd give them a shot anyway. 

My husband and kid and I rolled in there to this really laid back atmosphere place that would never give you the impression that it was kid friendly if it wasn't for the other strollers in the restaurant and row of high chairs. 

The menus are cute and packed inside record sleeves and has such things like a Mac and Cheese boutique, yam fries, brie bake, hot pot, phud thai and calamari strips.

I had the yam fries and the mac and cheese with brie cheese with spicy beef and mushrooms.

The sweet potato fries (served with one of about 9 sauces - I had the piri piri) were hands down the best I've had in the city so far. 

The portions were great and tasty. I'll definitely be back there many times and bring back my friend's kids too to check out their kids menu.

Update: spring hours have Sunday's now open until 11pm"}
{"text":"Customer service goes a long way.  I must say it has been a really long time since I have had an experience  this bad.

The venue on its own has much going for it .  It's tacky art and kitschy chair and table ensemble does this give this place a charm and comfort.  There is a neighbourhood feel. Ya know, like Cheers, wherever one knows your name.

So naturally, our regular that came with us told us that it's a busy night, Sunday jazz afternoons .  I would like to think the staff would be aware of that. This part was quite an enjoyable experience especially seeing how many people came in to sit and listen.

Our server, a blonde haired woman with a red top and black spandex pants, on the other hand, made us feel awful. We were a kind group so we could not understand why she was being so rude to all of us. Kindness  should not be returned with attitude. Each of us thought were we crazy? Is it just me? However, no, we each went through some really genuine curtness. Also, our favourite, the artificial grin that looked completely like a an unnatural strain.  It was alarming really.

One of us, wanted to ask her a question but she just ignored her and walked away mid question. I watched her walk away go to her billing station and raise her hand and the bill in frustration and  walk back to my friend.  What my friend was trying to ask was how much the bill was because she couldn't read it.  

She took my money and never gave me back the change. Though  none of us were surprised.

In addition, it took quite awhile to get the menu. Then when we had asked for a couple of menus later it never came until we had to remind her. 

She was stressed out and unfriendly. All seven of us could see it.  The thing is, this is the service industry. Some of us have worked in the service industry so we understand a busy .  However, when you have bad days, you can't let it show. You just can't because it will affect business. You are their front of house, the face of the business. The trickle down effect of bad service is enormous.

I never want to be afraid of my server. 

Now, all this aside. Perhaps she required more assistance. Could the owners have assisted more.?

I am not saying do not go here.  I am just warning, do not be surprised by the service."}
