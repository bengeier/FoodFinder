{"text":"Tried to have dinner at Rush with my family  of 6 and was turned away at the door as my daughter is only 16 and the hostess claimed it was a \"restolounge\" and no one under 18 was admitted. Having eaten in high end restaurants all over the world (and my daughter was served wine at several establishments in NYC last year) I was shocked that they would turn away paying customers when the restaurant was not even half full. Oh well we went and had an excellent meal at Alloy and spent our $800 there instead..."}
{"text":"I have been here four times for work lunches.  The food was mediocre but my main concern was the waitress's attitude. When I later wrote to the manager regarding our experience there was never a response. I've given this place 4 try's and I will take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"My first experience at Rush was for an Xmas party and it was fabulous. Fabulous because 1. My boss paid for everything 2. The service is outstanding 3. The food is fantastic.  While perusing the drink menu, the server who approached me asked what I was in the mood for. I told him something fresh and  I was served exactly that: grey goose pear vodka ( who knew there was such a flavour?!) with lime, water and a splash of ginger ale. The service during our main meal was done by stealth like servers, that we barely noticed. They seem to not want to get in the way of your dining experience, but are on hand at the exact right moment if need be. Rush may seem like another boys club meeting place for downtown corporates, but if you can get past that, your in for a real treat."}
{"text":"Only place in Calgary so far that compares to the Boulud, Bourdain, Samuelsson, Ramsay and Batali's of the world.  Service is what sets it apart from the other places.  Set your napkin down, go to the bathroom, come back and it's neatly folded back waiting for you on the table.  Food is also of very high standard, some of it is local and seasonal which is a plus.  The best part of all this, it's great value for the money.  Without wine it'll be difficult to spend over $100/person here."}
{"text":"To be precise I would give it 3.5 stars  The restaurant is stylish.  Honestly, the food was OK. In comparison to restaurants of similar caliber, it just scores above average for me. The food, presentation and service, all felt 'young'  - still needs some maturing to do.  The wine list is EXTENSIVE but not ALL of them are great.   -Foie gras casserole - I was looking forward to this... unfortunately the pickled blueberries with the foie gras was not my forte. I would have preferred it without the blueberries. -Driview lamb was okay.  Can't even remember what I had for dessert. Some sort of cake and ice cream... It was sweet."}
{"text":"Service was good, ambiance was good, selection on the menu was good, presentation was good, however, the overall quality of the food was average at best. It was a mediocre meal and nothing about would encourage me to try them again"}
{"text":"The food was good and decor was great. A little put off by the swarming wait staff and unfriendly service. Waited a half hour for a beverage other than water. They still need a little more maturing to figure out the optimum staff quantity and how not to make it feel like a shark tank."}
{"text":"You walk in the high ceilings and lush ambiance only add to your hunger. Order the truffles (but not overly!) marine diver scallops and pork belly. Not only were the scallops cooked perfectly and the taste so fresh it's only $13! Next up, the lobster chunk papardelle noodles tossed on a lemongrass sauce. So good. Did I mention they also have Rosemary and olive oil frites?....okay. Your turn!"}
{"text":"I've only been to Rush at noon for business lunches. I have never been disappointed by the quality of the food or service. The restaurant is large, very modern and exquisitely designed. Just love the cellar and incredibly wide  selection of excellent wine.   While the ambience upon entry appears pretentious,  the friendly welcome and attentive service dispels any notion that the dining experience is going to deteriorate over time. I've enjoyed the innovative and fresh dishes and the ability of the staff to suitably romance the dishes when describing the specials and when the dishes are brought to one's table.   Pricy yes! But this is equivalent to a comparable  modern European or International New World Restaurant. I would have no hesitation recommending this Restaurant to seasoned international business travellers."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was great, but service and food was poor.  Took 45 minutes to get lunch entrees for party of 6.  Server didn't seem very polished."}
{"text":"The food was really good. The service was mostly great. However, god forbid you go to this restaurant with a large group of people, be the first to leave, and ask the waiter to see what your portion of the bill is. The waiter made a point to tell me that they don't normally split the bill and he seemed shocked that I'd even ask. I guess he wanted me to pay the 700 dollar tab for everyone?! I thought this was unrealistic and it was an unfortunate way to finish off a wonderful evening. I doubt I will ever go there again."}
{"text":"Recently dined at Rush during a visit to Calgary. For Fairmont guests, very convenient - just across the street! The restaurant is beautiful, and dining room is very comfortable. Service was very good, and food was delicious. Both the food and atmosphere are memorable!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure I've seen anything quite like Rush in Calgary.  Think high French service... surprisingly 'Big' space... contemporary decore and food.  The tasting menu was pricey but well worth it.... I don't cry often at dinner but I came close with the Ravioli stuffed with Pollenta (who knew you could even do that??).  Did I mention it was expensive? With a flight of wine and several (sensational) courses it came close to $150/person but it's hard to feel too upset with the full package.  Personally I've never been a fan of the BIG restaurant (in Calgary, think Teatro) or BIG service (in Calgary, think La Chaumiere) but it works for Rush.  It's not the place you'd go to all the time (and if an astroid was hurtling towards Calgary and you could only save one restaurant I'd be more inclined to save River Cafe) but for particular events there is clearly a space for Rush."}
{"text":"After years of driving by and reading good reviews, I was excited to try Rush for a business lunch. I even checked out their menu before hand!  But alas, it didn't live up to the hype or my expectations. The service was solid - I will give them that. But the good was not good at all. I will pay good money for great food but this missed the mark. I had the fried chicken sandwich. The chicken was over cooked (dry and borderline burnt) and the bun was also burnt. You could smell a burnt smell coming from the plate. The fries, which were supposed to be the best fries of my life according to my dining partner and the server, were good but luke warm.   Decor is nice but it's awfully dark in there, even during the day (which is why I'm not sure if the chicken was burnt or just close to burnt). My friend had the seafood pasta which looked good - she enjoyed it - but seemed pretty simple.   Disappointing that the food was not good. They have a relatively short menu, and they weren't super busy, so it shouldn't have been hard to make an awesome sandwich and fries. I won't be \"rushing\" back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I went here for my wife's birthday. I must say that the restaurant is functionally correct. It looks good, the wait staff is quite friendly, and the wine selection is very good. However, I found the food lacking, especially for the price.  We did the Chef's tasting menu, and I have done this many times before at restaurants in Calgary and all over North America. I have to say to was probably the worst to date. It wasn't bad, but for a \"Chef's Tasting\" it was simply uninspired. The tasting broke down like this for $95:  1. canapés and amuse bouche - A cold cauliflower soup in a cup. Tasted very cold and bland. Not very appetizing. I drank it like a shot of Tequila, and gagged the same way.  2-4. A whole bunch of un-memorable dishes that were extremely rich and bland.  5. spring creek beef tenderloin - Was the best part of the meal in my opinion. Very nicely done, rare to perfection. The bordelaise sauce, morels, parsnip purée complimented the meal perfectly.  6-8. A whole bunch more rich and bland unmemorable dishes and desert which was good, not great.  So bottom line, Rush is great if you have money but are not critical on food. Also, you like great service is a modern/trendy (isn't that style getting a bit dated?) environment. There are better restaurants overall  out there in Calgary like Rouge, Capo, and yes the old school staple La Chaumière. However, I guess for \"Americana\" style this is not bad, but for $300 a couple it is not great either."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: 4/5 Service: 4/5 Food: 5/5 Overall experience: 4/5  I was on a business trip to Calgary and decided to try Rush.  They have a $75 tasting menu which is well worth the price.  If you are a fan of tasting menus, I would highly recommend Rush."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful experience at Rush!  The food and service were excellent and I really loved the decor and overall feel of the restaurant.  Rush also gets bonus points for being proactive about food allergies and being able to accommodate my gluten-intolerant husband.  It's always nice when he can choose from almost anything on the menu instead of being restricted to one or two entrees!"}
{"text":"Calgary has amazing upscale eateries and Rush has been hyped to be part of that elite group.  Swank decor aside; I can't say I can agree given the mediocre overall experience at the restaurant.  The first impression from th entrance is stunning, the interior decor is ultra-modern and sophisticated.  The service is prompt on the slow side  although lacks attentiveness when asking something out of the menu description or receiving the food cooking temperature as ordered or suggested .    Eight people were in our group, two having specific dietary requirements.  This is supposed to be a seafood and steak house, the steaks came back way undercooked for medium and medium well, while the seafood and particularly the seared salmon were way overcooked for medium.  One of our guests ordered a seared salmon with a salad instead of the starch accompanying it; a rubbery well done fish came to the table with a tiny round cup of sliced butter lettuce and 8 tiny little square green pepper squares (less than penny sized each); the portions left very little to be desired.  All and all, the decor is impressive but the lack of service attentiveness and the food being well below average for the category of establishment \"Rush\" is Branded to be, leads us to keep moving to other downtown Calgary dining explorations; next!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch today with seven co-workers.  Five of us ordered the Rush Burger.  We all agreed it was tastless and maybe slightly undercooked.  The other two had Seafood and enjoyed their meal.   The service was lousy, not sure if they were under-staffed today.   We all agreed that Rush was not something we would do again."}
{"text":"I really like this place! I visited Rush during Calgary's Big Taste event and the food was superb, though somewhat mismatched. A crab cake followed by curry followed by gelato doesn't really have a theme, but maybe that's what they were going for. In any case, it was delicious. Service was fast but a bit stoic. The whole vibe from Rush is pretty high-end, which is lovely for luxury but I prefer something a bit edgier with more engaging staff. Nevertheless, I'm hesitant to give them any negative review comments because I feel like they did everything right even if it's not my style! Decor is very modern and beautiful. I'd really love to come back on a date night or a special occasion, that's what Rush seems perfect for!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for a few years now. This Restaurant features contemporary modern stylish decor. The Restaurant set up does give you sense of high end luxury feeling. In comparison to other Restaurants this is a very nice modern stylish. If you are there for the first you kind of wonder what's on the menu?  They have valet parking At the front in the evenings. They serve fusion style of food as they have French, Italian, Europeian, Asian sauces and spices. They come up with some interesting dishes.  Their presentation is wonderful and clean makes the food look even more appetizing.  They also have a great selection of wines and spirits to compliment your dinner. Price is a little on the high side. They also have a full bar.  Appetizers are awesome as well tasty and light. Dinner was very tasty not over powering with spices cooked just right.  Dessert is light yet creamy not overly sweet just hit the spot killing your sweet tooth.  This restaurant has a over all package and experience clients that I bring all end up coming back."}
{"text":"Rush is truly an experience for the senses. The menu is as beautiful as the decor (so is the wine list).  If you're feeling adventurous, put yourself in the hands of their Chef, Sommelier and wait staff by choosing the tasting menu with wine pairings. The portions are perfect, ensuring you can make it to the end of the meal without needing \"buffet pants\".   Beware the faint-of-heart or spendthrift...this experience will run you $95 for the tasting menu and an additional $65 for the wine pairings before taxes and gratuity. If you want a taste of their superb cuisine without the investment, dining a la carte is also available. My recommendation is to save up and do the full experience - it is worth every penny."}
{"text":"Rush was a great experience from the get-go. When we arrived, the FREE valet service took our car, then we were quickly greeted by staff at the door. The staff then took us on a short tour of the restaurant, including the bar/lounge space, the two private dining rooms (which can be separate or joined to seat up to 28 people); the private chef table in the back next to the kitchen (which can be booked) and the amazing glass encased 3500+ bottle wine cellar with private cellars for investors.  A nice touch is the in-house created sparkling water, served in tall bottles. The food options were well balanced for both meat eaters and vegetarians. You can choose from a tasting menu with or without wine parings or from a selection of starters, middle and main courses.  Things began with an amuse-bouche and cocktails. Then onto our dinners which were fantastic. The service was amazing throughout with multiple staff serving the table and timing all arrivals and departures with grace. The dessets, coffee and tea were a great way to wind down the evening.  It's not a cheap night out, but you certainly get what you pay for."}
{"text":"a few notes from my visit a couple of nights back - a little on the pricey side, but not over the top for the food, ambiance, and decor - beautifiul restaurant decor (very shi-shi, but nice) - the bar side had a live lounge-ish band playing - our server was a little pre-occupied, and we had to ask for things like bread, why our wine was taking so long to come out, dessert menu... he did try and buy his tip back by offering a couple of bags of housemade granola. - food was great: * 5 out of 6 oysters tasted beautifully (it came with types of sauces for flavour, but i'm a straight lemon and horse radish guy). the 6th was a little off. * lobster bisque was tasty as heck. * beef tenderloin was magic. one of the best pieces of beef i've had in my short time in calgary * halibut was cooked perfectly - flakey, yet firm and juicy. - i'd go back."}
{"text":"I really wish I was able to write a good review as those before me. Unfortunately the server was anti-social and awkward. The scotch poured was barely an ounce. The salad was lettuce and oil - seriously! The salmon was half raw, the pasta like mush soup and the lobster like second day leftovers. I have eaten almost everywhere in Calgary and have had great meals and OK meals but never anything this horrible. I thought the film crew for Kitchen Nightmares was going to burst through the back door at any moment. RUSH off to a better place."}
{"text":"We had a terrific lunch experience at Rush!  The service was awesome from the time we entered the building through the end of the meal.  The lunch menu had good variety, and the food was very good.  The presentation was crisp throughout.  While the food is a little pricey relative to the quality of the food, the service and atmosphere make up for it."}
{"text":"Food: 3/5 Atmosphere: 4/5 Service: 4/5 Overall experience: 3/5  (1- Terrible; 3- decent; 5- Fantastic)  My friend and I started our \"girl's night out\" at Rush; enjoying a lovely 4 course dinner and drinks. We were seated at one of the tables with a comfy curved sofa with a few pillows for us to lean back on. In the center of the dining room was a large table with a beautiful centerpiece circled by wine bottles and water pitchers. A very creative yet practical way to act as the 'servers' area.   The service was good; our server was really friendly and answered any questions we had about the menu. I also found it helpful that they told us what we were eating before digging in. Unlike most places I've been to, they cared about what you thought of the food and offered to correct any problems that may arise. Our appetizer came out fairly quick and the food continued to come out at a steady pace.   We started our meal with their \"Seared Sea Scallop\" appetizer ($13) with air dried bison, minted pea, cashew, sun choke, and chanterelle. The presentation was lovely, but the dish fell a bit short. You get two large pieces of scallop, but the temperature of it was warm and cooled down quickly. The scallops were only okay - could have had a better sear and more seasoning. The best thing on the plate however was the 'dried bison' which is even better than prosciutto *gasp*!  Next up was a mid-meal dish prepared by the chef which consisted of their in-house cured salmon with bagel chips, pickled cipollini (onion), caviar, and creme fraiche (can't quite remember). There was a lot going on with the plate, but when I combined everything onto my fork, the flavours came together well. I had only wish there was more pickled onion to cut the saltiness of the fish.  For our mains, I ordered the \"Rack of Lamb\" ($36) with ash crust, autumn vegetables, ricotta gnocchi, chick pea puree, and port jus. I really need to stop ordering lamb from restaurants because this is the second time I've been really disappointed with a lamb dish. I was expecting a juicy, beautiful \"rack of ribs\",  but instead I got one awkwardly sliced chop and two pieces of unevenly cut lamb medallions. I asked for medium rare and I got more of a medium to medium well, with the temperature of the meat being warm. The ash crust added no extra flavour and the meat was not juicy at all. So disappointed! I did however, enjoy the port jus which added a bit more flavour to the meat and the ricotta gnocchi which had the perfect 'melt-in-your-mouth' texture. The way gnocchi should be!  The highlight of our meal was the Cioppino my friend ordered ($30) with clams, mussels, prawns, scallops, fresh fish, and chorizo in a spicy tomato broth. The dish was presented in a stone pot with two pieces of bread on the side to soak up the delectable broth. There was a decent amount of perfectly cooked seafood (large shrimp, scallops, pieces of salmon) with scattered lumps of chorizo. The first bite was excellent and I could definitely taste the fresh seafood stock used in the broth. My friend (who doesn't eat a lot of spicy food) thought it had the right amount of kick - without leaving her mouth burning.  Last but not least we had a chef prepared dessert with hazelnut chocolate, toasted marshmallow, hazelnut icecream, and a piece of fudge which was like a warm, gooey chocolate chip cookie. A deconstructed tiny dessert, but packed a sinfully sweet punch! We also ordered their \"Trio of Creme Brulee & Sweet Biscuits\" ($10). Their daily selection for the night was a small dish of brandy creme brulee, classic vanilla, and espresso. If you are a creme brulee fan (like my friend), you will enjoy this dish which was like eating creamy whipped butter. The flavours weren't too over powering except for the espresso which was like eating raw espresso beans. At this point, I was pretty full so I only had a nibble on the biscuits that accompanied the dish, which turned out to be stale.  Overall, the food was only okay. However, if I'm paying $30+ a dish I expect high quality food which I didn't find. I left a little disappointed.   If you are tight on cash, not into fine dining, or a big man with a hearty appetite, I say skip this place."}
{"text":"Fraudulent. Yup, there's no other way to say it. Waiter: \"Can I have that topped with bearnaise sauce for you.\" Us: \"Sure.\" The bill: \"Additional $15+ tax\". Waiter: \"The special today is a bison steak\". Me: \"Rare please.\" The bill \"$68+ tax\". (Ended up being more expensive than ANYTHING else on the menu!). Sorry guys but if you're to do the used car salesman bait and switch, then have the common decency to mention the upcharge. Disgusting behaviour. Lost a customer for life."}
{"text":"Rush perpetuates the trend of overpriced and overhyped restaurants in Calgary. This review may sound a bit harsh, but when we consider the hysterical price points of the menu items, an elevated quality is expected.  Our group of 10 went for dinner at Rush. Decor is quite spectacular, with a beautiful layout and inviting lighting. Service was friendly, but poor. ~15min to fill a drinks order when the restaurant was not that busy is too long. When they did arrive, we had to help the staff sort out where the went. This was a trend all night as items got placed at the wrong seat, or wrong table entirely.  The one major highlight I should establish immediately: the beef selections are spectacular. They were generally well cooked (though sometimes not to spec, I'll get to that) and are of high quality. I had the wagyu 10oz, asked for it rare, it came medium. Not the end of the world as the beef is such a spectacular cut and was still very tender with an excellent sear. Most others in the group saw medium-ish. Effectively, nearly everyone's beef was overdone. Not to the extent where it reduced the quality, but a bit of an issue when you start at $40 without sides.  A few of us got the lobster accompaniment. All were rubbery and overdone and hysterically overpriced. It's $18 for a half lobster. No really, it's exactly a lobster split in half. Tiny claw and tiny tail, and a bunch of  nearly inedible bits in between sprinkled with shell. That said, the hollandaise sauce was great, however. You can also select a number of small portioned green vegetable sides for $10-15.  Another ordered the scallops and short ribs, which come with potatoes, of course. The short ribs were cooked well but were otherwise quite salty. The three small scallops were rubbery and overdone. Scallops are not difficult to cook. Had the dish been in the mid 20s, it would have been acceptable. But again, we are talking $34 here. This is a place that centralizes its marketing on surf and turf. You'd think you'd know how to properly cook them.  Back to the composition; the steaks came with overcooked and soggy carrots, with two or three slices of baby potatoes. Really? Is this a 1980s steak house? Do we really have to pay $10 extra for broccoli? It's a bit absurd that this trend is allowed to continue. You can opt for a $5 side of red wine demi glaze, which in my opinion is just too salty and overpowering for a good cut of beef. I didn't ask for it, and got it anyway and was charged for it.   And, of course, the ever prevalent 20% mandatory tip. Is tipping really that bad of an issue in this city that we've now stepped up to a mandatory 20% on large group? Regardless, I am continually seeing this practice being used and abused, particularly in the case of Rush where service was sloppy, slow, inaccurate. Dishes were overcooked, sides were overpriced and lacking, and drinks were poorly made.  Throw in the fact the bathrooms were disgusting, out of towels by 9pm, and already occupied by drunks by 10pm (one of them nearly passed out on the chair in the bathroom), and you have one awkward dining experience.   For dessert, I just had a macchiato. Not sure what they actually served me, but I'm pretty sure it was just strong coffee. Complete with coarse grounds in the bottom of the glass. Disgusting.  Another questionable practice... we were not given the option to split the bill and had to deal with a suddenly impatient server. No really, it's 2014 and it's a large group. Either give us the option to split the bill up or wait a few minutes for us to do the math. Instead she awkwardly hovered over us. Since the bill had charges with names that didn't match the menu, it wasn't particularly easy to figure out quickly. My wife and I had two beers, one gin and tonic, wagyu 10oz, scallops/short ribs, half lobster. $178. The best part is, as we were about to leave, a server came by with a dish asking who ordered scallops. Slow clap.  Don't get me wrong, we still had a great time, and that may be because we're an easygoing group. But, for the prices Rush demand and the mandatory tipping, a harsh review is required. I do not recommend this place. Honestly, go to the Keg. It's equally as unremarkable but will cost you significantly less."}
{"text":"Rush!! What to say about Rush! I have been there twice but my most recent visit was Saturday night. I went there on a date and it was pretty much perfect! It is the definition of what service should be like (and was like at one point in time..)  When we arrived, they had free valet service. I know this is only a weekend thing, but boy is it convenient. Parking downtown on a Saturday night is nearly impossible at times.  The hostess took us to our table and laid our napkins on our nap (Major brownie points there!!) She also took my jacket and gave me a purse hook for the table. More restaurants should get into this!  We skipped appies and went straight for the meal. I had a lobster pasta dish and it was delicious! It looks like nothing when you get it but it's so filling. My date got the pork chop. I'm not a big pork person because we had pork chops a lot when I was a kid but it was delicious. It was huge! Speaking of which, their prices are pretty fantastic considering they are in the heart of downtown. I was really impressed with that.   Our waiter was really knowledgeable about the menu and made some great recommendations. He wasn't too pushy and he wasn't distant either. He was perfect. For dessert I order Les pots de chocolats. One of them was a coffee one, the other a white chocolate green tea one and the last a grand marnier one. SOOOO delicious!!! I think i liked the white chocolate green tea one the best. The flavors work surprisingly well and they are a pairing you wouldn't usually put together.   I will be going there again, certainly sooner than later. I wasn't a fan of all the turquoise decor in the dining room and actually prefer the lounge, however it does suit the restaurant.   Recommended for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Love it.  I've been here for New Years Eve... and a few times since then. Gosh, the food was so delicious, it's on the steeper side of the bill but it's a great fine dining experience. I love the atmosphere, the decor. Service was really outstanding  - as it should be. Valet parking in the winter is appreciated.  AND... let me tell you, I don't care much for red velvet cake (yes I'm party of that 1% of the population)... BUT the red velvet cake here SOOOOO GOOD. Actually all the deserts are to die for. So good!!!!  Definitely not for the people who like mediocre stuff."}
{"text":"expensive but worth it. good food good service . love their rack of lamb and their complimentary tri bread."}
{"text":"I've been to Rush many times for business lunches and evening meals, and have never had a bad experience here.  Their food, wine and cocktail list and service are all exceptional.  On my most recent visit, I enjoyed the chili garlic shrimp, 6 oz CAB tenderloin with the most delicious scalloped potatoes, and a lovely bottle of Malbec.  We had one server who was a little on the odd side, but otherwise the service was very good.  Attentive without being intrusive.  Very intimate and upscale environment, but not pretentious.  If you are having a small dinner party, it's really nice to book in one of their private rooms."}
{"text":"Wouldn't go  back. Went for the express lunch, and they were already out of the main.  Ordered the tomato burrata salad. Tomatoes not in season, they were tasteless.  I don't understand where the burrata was from, as the skin was tough and nasty. The curds weren't soft and oozy- they were like chunks of week old dry ricotta.  There was honey drizzled on top- made no sense. It did not go with the balsamic reduction and 1 sprig of  basil.  Ambience and service was great, but I went for the food!"}
{"text":"My wife took me to Rush for my b-day dinner.   She had been raving about it since she went there for lunch with her work a couple months ago.  Let's just say it was everything that she had hyped it up to be.  It started with complimentary valet service. Of course you feel obligated to tip the guy when you leave but a tip wasn't required.  I will start with a brief description of the restaurant and then go into the food.  The interior design was sexy. Dark colors, cool atmosphere and killer music with a live DJ spinning. Not sure if they have it every weekend but they had a DJ spinning some funky hip hop instrumental beats. Let's just say the music was definitely younger and hipper than the majority of the crowd in there. But overall the place did not feel like you're your typical stuck up, pretentious restaurant in the high end price range.  Now on to the food which was fabulous.  They started us with an amuse-bouche which was some thinly chopped chorizo and prawns served with a lentil sauce.   We were then brought two kinds of bread both made in house. The bread was tasty and the service and presentation were wonderful.  We considered ordering the chef's tasting menu which looked interesting but we decided to order several dishes on the regular menu instead.   We each ordered appies so that we could share. My wife had the risotto carbonara and I ordered the foie gras casserole. Both were excellent. The risotto was nice and creamy. If you are a fan of carbonara you will enjoy this appetizer. I usually don't order foie gras but since it was my b-day I thought I'd indulge. The foie gras was prepared very nicely and it went surprisingly well with the blueberries in the dish.  My wife's main course was spring creek beef duo which consisted of nice piece of braised short rib topped with a hen egg and a sliced flat iron steak served with a side of Maitake mushrooms. I thought the flat iron steak was a perfectly cooked medium rare and the sauce that it was served with was superb.  My main course was Maitake mushrooms on a bed of mashed potatoes served with edamame.  It was tasty but in hindsight I should have ordered a more substantial entrée.   We also ordered a side of rosemary and pecorino fries, which were some very tasty fries. Albeit they better have been for $7 for a side of fries. This is a high end restaurant so be prepared to drop some dough. Our bill for the meal was about $180 including tip for 2 people which I think is reasonable for a high end restaurant but we did not order any drinks. I would say this was good value for money when compared to other high end restaurant in town such as Capo or Teatro.  I can't forget about the dessert which was a fine ending to a first class meal. Their dessert is structured according to flavors. So you can order a vanilla or apple or chocolate or blueberry or banana dessert. We ordered the apple and banana desserts. The apple was basically a small apple pastry served with a scoop of gelato. I think they call it gelato because it sounds nicer than ice cream. But it was a very good apple pie with ice cream even if it did cost $10. I thought the apple was better than the banana. The banana dessert was three different preparations of the theme. It was a very interesting concept. Similar to what you would see on one of those fancy cooking show.   The service was top notch. Everyone was very attentive but not over bearing and still friendly which is tough to do in high end restaurants. Sometimes the servers think they need to be a little pretentious which I disagree with but that is another rant. The only negative was that one waiter seemed a bit weird in a socially inept kind of way but his service was still very good.   I would thoroughly recommend Rush to anyone who wants to enjoy a fine meal in a fine establishment."}
{"text":"For me, never quite lives up to billing and price"}
{"text":"Rush is fine dining with a friendly touch.  I've always been a fan of steak, so when I was told that Rush has one of the best in the city I knew it would be my birthday lunch destination. I started the meal with the calamari which was a less traditional non-battered approach which worked well. For my main, I ordered a steak with fries and was not disappointed. My steak was cooked perfectly and was served with a large portion of flavored butter on top which complimented the steak very well. There was a huge portion of fries that I could never have finished but they were some of the best fries I have ever had. The staff was very kind and provided a great level of service while happily answering all of the questions I had. I will definitely be back to Rush when looking to impress a date or to celebrate an occasion.  Great food with nice décor and pleasant staff."}
{"text":"I found Rush online and absolutely glad that we went. The ambience is perfect and service was superb. Let's not forget about food, I had the lobster & coconut bisque and halibut for entree. They were amazingly good! I highly recommend anyone who wants to have a fine dining experience in Calgary to check this place out!"}
{"text":"Went Saturday Oct  2nd, 2010.  Complimentary valet parking was a nice touch.  Very nice restaruant, small bar area at front, and bigger restaruant area around back.   Had a tasty lobster bisque and rib eye!  Waiter was very helpful and accomodating for us.  They did play some top 40ish music as background music, which I enjoyed.  Worth going to.  Nice fine dining restaurant."}
{"text":"Love Rush!  The restaurant decor is very modern and the table for 2 we got was actually a U-shaped booth with 2 cushions on the booth chair.  Really fancy!  Also, the maitre d asked if I wanted a purse-holder to hang up my purse!  How neat!    The food is very good, service is impeccable.  The waiter came by and took our drink orders.  I didn't fancy anything to drink except water and did you know that this restaurant has its own filtered water and you can have it normal or carbonated!?!  Serious.  I ordered the Crab Bisque for a starter and this was a very delicate soup in a large deep white bowl.  In the centre was a garnish of finely julienned pieces of apple.  There were pieces of crab in the soup.  I wanted to slurp every little bit of soup.    For my entree, I ordered the Braised Short Rib.  It came with mash potatoes and snap peas.  I asked if I could substitute the potatoes with more vege and it was substituted for a combo of finely chopped snap peas and slightly wilted watercress.   As the waiter told me, \"the short rib is excellent!\" and I agree wholeheartedly.  It was a 3' x 3\" x 1 1/2\" piece of braised short rib with the vege garnish on the top.  The short rib was so soft that you could cut the meat with a fork.  Absolutely melts in my mouth!  My guest ordered the Steak Sandwich and Frites - he had a 3\" x 3\" x 1/2\" of steak on a piece of bread (can't remember the type) and a little metal bucket of fries.  Ketchup was served in a little bowl.  Pepper and salt also came in little bowls with spoons.    Dessert time - we both ordered the Apple - apple finely sliced and tossed with brown sugar and restacked to form the shape of an apple.  It sat on a little pastry to hold it all together.  What was the best part was the little jug of brandy caramel sauce!  The waiter poured a generous portion over each apple dessert, luxuriously covering each apple portion.  It was quite simple yet so delicious.  All in all, I can see why Rush won an award recently in enRoute magazine.  It is THAT good!"}
{"text":"What a stellar restaurant. The service was great and the decor was so pretty! It was very sleek and well maintained. It was surprisingly not that busy for a weekend night though.  My boyfriend had steak and I had fish. We had the calamari to start and usually I think calamari is too much of a typical appetizer choice, but boy am I glad that we ordered it. I'm tired of the typical breaded rings that are deep fried and come with the same sauce as every other restaurant. ROP actually does not bread the calamari and instead drizzles this light tasting sauce on top right before serving. They were so tender and tasty - just delicious!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place. It has a really nice environment, Everything on the menu is exquisite, you won't be sorry! The service is excellent, the staff are professional and courteous.  Try their express lunch menu, or book their private dining rooms for bigger groups or functions."}
{"text":"we went on a Wednesday night so it was really dead but the waitress barely came to the table or asked how the food was or if we needed anything. there were just five of us and she had the nerve to charge us 20% gratuity . the food was fantastic but the service was so shitty. such a shame."}
{"text":"Wow. Rush is swank! The service, the food, the decor... it's top-notch. The exterior of Rush is unassuming. The silver letters used against the white walls of the building are easy to miss if you're not looking for them. Guys, if you want to impress your ladies on a special night out, Rush would put you in very good favour IMO. I came in to check Rush out during Yelp Eats Week.  Inside, the resto is divided into the lounge at the front and the dining room at the back. Half round bench seats/booths make up tables for 2-4, while a long table at the back is accommodating for a larger group. If you really want the place to yourself, I noticed a private room just beyond the dining room.  If you aren't used to fine dining in Calgary, the service here is something else. The staff are so well coordinated, a team of two collected our plates on cue, while others refolded a dinner companion's napkin when he left the table for a moment, swiftly brought over another place setting when a friend joined us a bit into the meal and beyond checking in on our meal every now and again, did all of this without so much as interrupting conversation.  For dinner I ordered the goat cheese salad and the Miso Roasted Sablefish (squid ink fettuccini, truffle scented dashi, ginger, baby bok choy, shimiji). I need a word stronger than delectable and delicious combined to describe my dinner. Maybe divine? That doesn't quite conjure up the right image of just how flavourful my dish was. The Miso broth alone was incredible. And the sablefish seemed to just melt into my tongue the second I had my first bite.   By the end of the meal, we were so full there was no room for dessert (we also filled up on their complimentary buns. They have three different kinds that come out baked in this little trio for your table). There was a bit of a lag between our appys and our entrees, but I attribute that to our third party joining us a bit later in the meal. Rush ensured all of our entrees came out at the same time. My fish was hot and ready for me to eat!  Rush is not a spot I could afford to eat out at all that often. For a glass of wine, dinner and my salad, my part of the bill was about $65 including GST and tip. But man oh man, I'm still thinking about that sablefish.... if a dish leaves flavour traces in my memory, it was worth every penny."}
{"text":"We went to Rush on Valentine's Day. It wasn't over crowded as most places are on such an occasion. It is a \"steak and seafood\" restaurant. The atmosphere was great, but definitely more lounge like, but a very fancy lounge. We ordered the chef's Valentine's menu and were served a four course dining treat. I'm not the biggest fan of seafood and I would go back just for the prawns we were served that night. All the courses were fantastic and finished off with an amazing dessert. I find that sometimes dessert at nicer restaurants is sometimes lacking, but Rush definitely is not in that class. If you're downtown I would definitely recommend to check this restaurant out.  Courses: Seafood tasting plate 7/10 Bacon and Eggs 8/10 Scallops and short ribs 9/10 Rush Butter Cake 9.5/10  Note: I only give full marks for life changing experiences!"}
{"text":"I've yet to encounter worse service in one of Calgary's fine dining establishments.  Teatro runs a close second, but The Rush?  Truly terrible.  Nice looking young lady, but rude, inefficient and seemingly without a clue that she didn't know her job.  Being cute just isn't enough, in my opinion.    The menu?  Good gawd.  You'd think in a city where healthy individuals abound, this high end restaurant (as most others in town do) would offer healthier options.  Everything on the menu was horrendously high in fat with nary a vegetable to be found; a definitie sign of a lazy chef.  The prices?  Horrendous.  The only reason  I could fathom?  The lovely decor.    I won't be back and - as you see - am not the least bit shy about telling everyone."}
{"text":"Such a nice RESTAURANT!!!! Ok the only down side is that we went on a holiday and Calgary was quite empty and so was this restaurant. Bf & moi can't wait to try this place again when its packed~ The deco is super cute, the lounge and the dining room is very upscale and modern. I loved the feel to the whole place. I had the goat cheese salad (roasted & marinated beets | walnut | maple truffle emulsion $11) which was superrrr tasty! I also had the roasted & cultivated mushrooms $9 side super yummy, I am a big mushroom fan and these were GOOD! My bf ordered the fraser valley duck (crispy skin breast | barley pilaf | frisee | brie | blackberry $32) after he got it he remembered he doesn't like duck lol, he loves trying new things but is very limited in his likings. He wants to try the steak next time, they have tenderloin, rib eye, and striploin or maybe even lamb. We ordered a few sides to share - overall the meal was delicious! Just wish the restaurant was a litte more busy, but will def try it again as the last time we were in that area we walked by it and just looking through the windows it looked quite busy! Can't wait 2 try it again n update my review :)"}
{"text":"I loved this place!... The food was very good, and the service really friendly.. The dessert was great, I had the creme brûlée and I loved it... I would definitely go back there..."}
{"text":"Good but lacking in subtlety. Overspiced does not work well for seafood"}
{"text":"Well, Prime it is not. Service was very slow and inattentive. There were literally 5 people in the huge restaurant and I waited for 25 mins for a drink refill. Had the beef tartare and it was quite good. Then waited 40 mins to get my scallops and rissotto! When it came, rissotto was so undercooked, it was crunchy. I think over those 40 mins they could have at least cooked the arborio! For the high price point, this restaurant completely over-promises and under-delivers."}
{"text":"An average sized group came here for dinner a week or so ago and while the decor is swanky, the food and prices are meh.  We all ordered drinks which took far too long to arrive.   When we finally got to ordering our food we were all on drink #2.   The service was disorganized and chaotic - no excuse for a place that takes groups and was really not busy on the night we were there.    They couldn't keep straight who ordered what, and messed up the meat \"doneness\" on almost everyone's steak.    You cannot call yourself OCEAN and PRIME and mess up your seafood and beef.   It's insane.    But they somehow managed to.   I ordered the short ribs and scallops - rubbery scallops, and run-of-the-mill short ribs.     The portions were a total joke.   Mediocre protein and then 2 carrots and a potato?  For 50 dollars.     Total rip off to charge customers 10 dollars for a side of vegetables to accompany protein.   The cherry on the horribly cooked cake was that after we finished eating and were ordering our tea/coffee a server brought out a plate of scallops to one of us....  So strange!      Never again"}
