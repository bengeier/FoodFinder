{"text":"This should be the flagship example for the Circle K gas stations. I recently observed an upgrade in the convenience store that was astounding. The already excellent coffee area and cold drink box area has been upgraded modernized very pleasing to the eye. The management of the store is superb. Donna, the manager of this location is a caring compassionate person towards her customer ensuring that their every need is met, and she has a trained staff to ensure that her standards are met. What more could you ask for in a gas station, short of free gas."}
{"text":"This is a decent store on South Tryon St adjacent to I-485.  They have everything you would expect from a convenience store...gas, drinks, hot foods, coffee, beer and my favorite lottery tickets.    The staff can be really friendly here or not...just depends on the day or their mood but you get that at any convenience store these days.  The main reason I keep coming back here is because they once sold me a $400 lottery ticket. Of course that was a few years ago and I haven't won the big one yet but you never know when you will."}
{"text":"It's a gas station. Everything is cheap but tasty and quick, and it's located off of a main street."}
{"text":"Not the cheapest gas, but how much is your time worth? Inside, decent selection of coffee and snacks. Then you're back on and can get onto I-485 fast."}
