{"text":"24 hour Korean delight. I woke up at 4 am and felt like having Korean so I took advantage of the services. The place was busy actually with customers. The waitress seemed tired but greeted me with a smile. I got my side dishes along with my main at the same time. And gave me time to enjoy my meal without any rush. I recommend to everyone to visit the place and it is the closest one to finch station"}
{"text":"I have a love and hate relatishionship with the place.tonoght  We had a group of  6.   We irdered a mix of table and a la carte 




Table cooking 


Fresh beef (looks and price loke wagu)  $31   very small portion and not work the price 

Short ribs    good but pricey at $30

Special Sliced  pork belly  $20 very good but I usually order the regular pork $17 (best bet)



A la carte


Ka ja tang     solid

Bi bum bap   good



The side are a little better then the other korean place around and found the 
Noodle side dish with seasame oil excellent but they do offer free refill on that dish.



Here the oart why I did like them.  They are not consistent when they comp client.   Most restarent may offer things on the house if yiu frequent them enough.   This place is so random. Sometime they offer free lettuce other tine they charge me $2 per order.  It is cool if you charge but why randomly.   And yes it is the same group of 4-5 wait staff that does that to me. 

Also the last 3 visits it was very hot in there and we aaked politely to turn on AC.  The waitress ask managment politely said no.  It ok I still came back two more time when it was 30+C outisde"}
{"text":"The food was terrible and the service was really bad.  We were so disgusted to find a plastic package in the hot pot and we did not get any apology or discount. Our bill was $95.99 and we paid $100 out of courtesy. When we were leaving, the server lady came over to ask for extra tips (at least 10% of the total in her words).  It was just so ridiculous."}
{"text":"One of the restaurants I visit the most when I'm in the area. Their soups are the best and I love their pork and chicken cutlets. And the best thing is, I've never payed over $10"}
{"text":"I love this place, why its so underrated? I went there three times already and i continue to love it. I ordered the fried chicken (AL02) and it's so so good it's sweet and spicy!  And me and my friends ordered the Korean bbq, it's ok but the side veggie that goes along with the meat wrap were really nice.  I also tried their soon tofu and pork bone soup, love their broth! !! It's not oily as nakwon.  Love this way more. I like their interior is not old nor dirty.  And it's 24 hours!  Perfect for late night dinner!  The only complain i have is that the waitress lady has no facial expression sometimes you wonder if she is pissed off.  Other than that i enjoy this place and I'll come back!"}
{"text":"Food is very average, there's nothing wrong with it except there's been a few times here when it tasted like the dishes weren't as fresh. But mostly given a poor rating because I completely agree about the terrible attitude of some of the (older) waitresses. They do rude little gestures like slamming water cups down on the table, not speaking to you at all (accompanied by a stone face that looks very angry), and demanding a tip (i'm not joking) even if you order on the go (meaning stay less than 10 minutes)."}
{"text":"Just like most other Korean restaurants, they have beer/soju combos which consist of 5 bottles of beer or 1 bottle of soju with one dish starting from $20.00 to $35.00.

The food was okay nothing spectacular. However, with that price, I don't expect very much. 

What got me there was their opening hours. They said they open for 24 hours. So we got there around 1:00 am and were told they are closing at 2:00 am. The owner said they are doing some test runs for the extended hours. They would like to how busy they get and hire more staffs if so according to her. :(

Please do not say 'we are open for 24 hours' if you were not sure yet. Customers are not guinea pigs for your test runs. 3 stars for decent food and drinks. For service, it is almost nonexistent but it is what it is for most Korean restaurants so not applicable for me."}
{"text":"I crave Korean food a lot, something about the extreme spices that are very distinctive and addicting. Pyung Won definitely fulfilled my craving but wasn't mind blowing at the same time. 

I came with two friends, excuse me for not knowing the exact dish names, we ordered the seafood pancake and a hot pot dish. My favourite was definitely the pancake. It is most synonymous to an omelette for those not well versed in Korean food. The pancake was cooked to perfection, although I can clearly taste the oil that it was pan-fried in. The hot pot dish was alright, it was simply a large pot of instant ramen noodles. 

This little spot was just the place for me, because I was in the mood for junky/salty Korean fare. I enjoyed the meal, but there are plenty of places just like it."}
{"text":"convenient location, average food at affordable price and cleaner than other korean restaurant in yonge and finch area. but i find nothing special and the food is too average. its not bad but its not good. but they have a large selection to choose from so if u have nowhere to go, its not a bad choice"}
{"text":"Unbelievable I've been coming here all the time and they just told me that they will charge me extra for all you can eat pork belly for the salad which was our first one and said there's a new rule if your not into serving customers all you can eat don't offer it honestly I've been here all the time learn how to treat your regulars certainly never coming back here."}
{"text":"Here's how to piss off customers... 

My wife & I tried this Korean restaurant for the 1st time. It's around 10pm on a week night. It was cool and we asked to be seated inside away from the entrance. My wife is pregnant - there's no mistaken . On ordering, the waitress comes over and scolds us that our table seats 4 - \"will not seat us AGAIN at a table for 4 next time!\" she says. WTF?! Firstly, it's 10PM and there was no one waiting for a table for 4. Secondly, my wife is pregnant; thirdly, they already seated us at their discretion. THERE WILL BE NO NEXT TIME!

Ps. We enjoyed our dinner next door for less and better service."}
{"text":"Food is fine but service is terrible. If you do not want to spend $100 dollar buying an angry night, do not go."}
{"text":"One of my go-to Korean restaurants because the food here is cheaper than some other Korean places I've been to. They offer yummy pork bone soup, pork katsu, and deep fried pork dumplings! I think this place is good value for the price, and the portions of the food are filling! I felt stuffed as soon as I ate the 8th dumpling (they gave me 12pcs with a small salad). The Side dishes they offer are not bad either, I liked the tofu and potatoes they give. The atmosphere is nice and usually never quiet, since this place always has people out and about, and there is always kpop music playing in the background. Their service is OK, not the best. Sometimes I find the servers tend to forget about checking up on me. 
Other than that, I really do like coming to Pyong Won House, especially since it's right on Yonge and Finch and closely settled near the TTC station (so it's a short walk to grab a bite to eat)."}
{"text":"The best Kim chi fried rice! Have tried lots of things on the menu and its always been good. The staff are very friendly."}
{"text":"If I could give this restaurant less than one star, I would. Possibly the worst place I have ever gone. Waiter asked for my order, took the menus, and then completely forgot that I ordered. Complete waste of your time and money. I do not recommend."}
{"text":"On July 3, 2014 around 9:10 pm, me and my girl friend went to this restaurant, we sit at the table in front of entrance, my girlfriend ask the waiter tea.(the only male waiter. my girlfriend asked tea with the same waiter for three times. he finally bring us the tea, after drinking it, my girl friend saw something in the teacup she use, she opened the teapot, we found there a big spit inside the teapot. i called over a waitress,showed her the inside of the teapot,right away within 1 second she said sorry and brought us another teapot. we still don't felt good, i went over to the counter question the waiter who brought us the teapot why did you spit in our tea, the waiter answer within 1 second, how did you know its spit, i told him, she saw it, i pointing at the waitress who replace our tea(found out she is the owner)after i pointing at the owner, she did not denial and didn't say a word, he look at the waitress(THE OWNER) and reply at me: So? what are you gonna do? ( i personal think they are mother and son relationship)
we just pay the bill and ask receipt and left. after we came back home, my girl friend start to Nausea and vomiting. receipt number: 001-1-0131"}
{"text":"The food is decent. I got the Kim chi chigae and my cousins got the pork bone soup. I also got the spicy rice cakes. The food was pretty standard/average and almost good. 

I didn't really expect much from a restaurant like this so was happy and satisfied with the food and the price point I guess is relatively standard.

My reason for such little stars was the upon asking for the bill I had requested a box for my rice cakes. She brought one out and my cousin asked for another box as she wanted to take the pork home since she didn't eat it and only drank the soup. I handed her my large box and asked the lady to just replace my box with a small one. She insisted to get a soup container for the pork but I explained that there is no soup we just want to take the meat. She rolled her eyes and went to the back and got me soup container anyways and the started to clear the table very rudely. I don't really know what I said to offend her so much but for that reason alone  I will not be returning because the food was not worth the terrible attitude. 

Having said that, prior to this incident they were as cordial and friendly as one can imagine a Korean establishment with nonenglish speaking people to be."}
{"text":"This review is for lunch.

I have been going here for many years. Recently they have increased their prices by a lot. Now most of their lunch items are priced at $12-13 before tax. The food quality is the same but at this price point I don't think it's worth it. Why an earth would anyone should pay $11.99 for a kimchi fried rice?  It used to be $8.99 that's an increase over 30%. I couldn't order it knowing the old price. What a disappointment."}
{"text":"Conveniently located right across from Finch station. 

I think the lunch specials are a little cheaper than the competing Korean places close by. I paid $7 from a kimchi jigae.  Also, they give more banchan dishes than I am used to getting from other Korean places in Toronto. 

The food was average though. Turns out that I didn't have any meat whatsoever in my kimchi  jigae dish! I let the waitress know and she asked me if I wanted them to remake it. I just asked them to bring some meat.... I assumed she'd bring pork but she came with some small pieces of bulgogi looking meat. 

I will probably return to give it another try"}
{"text":"Short Review: Great 24-hour place if you are looking for something to eat after drinking too much, especially 3 am in the morning where the place is nearly vacant. Although most of the items are either sweet or spicy and if you feel nauseous after drinking too much, it might not be good at all to eat here. 

The place also has barbaque but I doubt that I would want that late at night.."}
{"text":"Coming super late at night, this is a nice option for those that are looking for a 24/7 spot. I rarely come down to Yonge/Finch area for Korean food, so this was a nice change of pace. 

Parking was a breeze considering it was almost 2 AM, and I was surprised to see how busy it was inside. We got a table relatively quickly, and were able to get our orders in. We ended up sitting for a while before anything came to the table though. We got some water and plates, and a tiny portion of salad to share between 4 people... 

When our food arrived, it was decent. Our table got many different options, from Bulgogi and Kalbi to Bimbambap and Cold Noodles. All were quite good, but I was pleased to see the side dishes arrive! They had 6 different side dishes, but there was this sort of root or radish that was really good. 

Service wasn't too bad, but they didn't seem to have enough servers working. 2 people when they were really busy just slowed them down. 

A nice place to go when you're out late, but not sure I'd head to such a busy area when there is Korean food closer to home."}
{"text":"Nice clean place with good decor. Was able to easily find a spot even though other places we went to were busy. Seems like this place is good for table cooking but we weren't up for that. 

Ordered the soya bean soup with grilled Mackeral. The soup had tofu and some beef and veggies in it. It was good, a taste that I was not used to but different, like a fermented bean taste. The mackeral looked really black and charred. But I was able to remove the skin and eat the rest. Came with two very thin slices of lemon, wished they could give bigger slices, goes well with the fish. The side dishes selection was not as large as some other places, but they did have seaweed and fish cakes so I'm not complaining. 

Overall the service was a-ok. They were quite busy so sometimes it was hard to get their attention but otherwise they were polite."}
{"text":"This wasn't the place we wanted to eat at, but the other place was full and my friends and I wanted Korean food. 

We ordered 4 meat dishes (different kinds of Kalbi and pork belly) which came with 2 soups of our choice. We ask ordered a seafood pancake. 

We were served with chap chae first, then the small side dishes. The server was friendly in the beginning, coming back with side dishes and water. However, later on became kind of annoyed and avoided coming by our table. 

The seafood pancake was delicious, everyone loved it! The meat was good as well, but took us a long time to cook it because there was something wrong with the gas and fire. 

Overall, this place was alright. The food was great, but the service could be a lot better."}
{"text":"My bf and I went here today and the experience was good. I ordered the Porkbone soup and omggggg it was delicious there was so much that I took more than half of it home and was full all day. My bf ordered a soup with bulgogi in it (don't know what it was called) it was sweet and also had Japchae noodles in it, he loved it. The service was polite and friendly."}
{"text":"I am a self declared kimchi stew expert and I get it all the time at korean restaurants so this one was no exception. Around 4-5pm, Pyung Won House was not too busy but it was definitely picking up. I got the kimchi stew which contained tofu, onions, kimchi, and fatty pieces of pork (no rice cakes!). The stew was also served with white rice and 7 side dishes (pickled cucumber, kimchi, bean sprouts, fish cake, seaweed, radish(?), and japchae) which is definitely more than many other restaurants.

The kimchi stew was VERY SALTY. As in VERY SALTY. I had to continually drink water to alleviate the saltiness but that definitely caught me by surprise. The side dishes were delicious but the stew did not meet my expectations. Service was good too."}
{"text":"In the hood and decided to try this Korean resto. 

Busy place at 8:45 on a Friday night.  Service is friendly and prompt.  We ordered soon du bu, soon dae, and seafood pancake.  Food came out pretty quickly and it was all tasty except the soon dae was not as good as other places.  It was sliced too thick which makes a difference too.

Worth a trip back when in the hood...."}
{"text":"There is always that one place that no matter how bad the service or how inconvenient the parking situation is, you still keep going back. I think this is that place for me. The food is just that good. The prices vary from cheap to mildly expensive depending on what you get. Now I am not saying the service is horrible, I've had great service here before, but it is hit or miss. Now on to the important part; the foodizzle. Let me start off by saying that you must always order the kimchee soup with what ever you're having. It is hardy, spicy and delicious. By far one of my favourites. Food wise I love me some korean bbq. If your feeling jewy, (yes i said jewy), I highly recommend the L.A. short ribs or the beef bulgogi. If you have time and some cheddar to spend, then I insist on getting their beef short ribs in unique sauce. I do not know what's so unique about the sauce but my lord is it delicious and comes with lettuce to wrap your beef in. They even cut it up and throw it on the table grill for you if you're feeling lazy. Simply delicious. Honorable mention would have to be the chicken katsu don, which is a fried chicken cutlet with a rich sweet and tangy sauce. Yum. Definitely a great place to eat late at night."}
{"text":"There are lots of Korean restaurants in the area and you can't go wrong with PWH. One reason to come here is their AYCE pork belly (sam kyup sal). At $16.99, it's not the cheapest option in the GTA, but it's not terribly expensive either. 

Of course, if you aren't looking for BBQ, they have other standard fares like bibimbap. None of their food strikes me as super amazing. None of their food were bad either. It's just a decent restaurant that happens to be very close to Finch station and is open 24 hours. 

One thing that is different is the atmosphere. The decor is slightly more modern compared to other Korean places. I like homey places so this isn't a plus to me but I thought you should know."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why all the negative reviews but this review is for their Korean BBQ. I originally wanted to go to Dal Dong Nae for Korean BBQ and apparently quite popular these days. But my bf told me he didn't recommend that place and suggested we come here. 

The restaurant is very spacious, there are a lot of tables. We ended up ordering two orders of samgyupsal and a peach makgoli (rice wine). The bbq also came with a side of stew of your choice and rice. Of course there's the usual banchan but we were given a lot of them! I don't remember how much it was but I would say it's worth it. The meat itself was good, the kimchi stew a little salty but that wasn't the main star. Overall, i would come back again!"}
{"text":"Pyung Won House can easily be missed along this stretch of Korean restaurants and shops. It blends in with the area at Yonge/Finch on the S/W corner.

There was free appetizers, which is always nice and appreciated.

I tried the ChalPan BulGoGi with vegetables on a sizzling plate and rice ($11.99). It was pretty standard. The only complaint would be that the beef was a bit thicker and a bit fattier than most places.

It's fairly busy, might have to wait but not too long. There's only street parking or Green P in the area."}
{"text":"I'm not going to lie to you.. I've never been to this restaurant sober. And I've never been here before 2am. This is a really convenient restaurant to go to especially after those late downtown nights.. right at the corner of yonge and finch. And it's 24/7!

Maybe it's the times I come, but they never seem to have enough people working here. I am (barely) standing for around 5-6 minutes before anyone even notices me. One thing I've also noticed is that the workers tend to stay behind the counter and never come out. It's like an endless game of hide and seek. A tiring one at that, especially when you're trying to order some food for your midnight cravings.
 
The side dishes here are small and unappealing - we barely touched ours. The soups there taste strange and not as great as Nak Won's next door. The portions are also super small and pricy. 

None the less, my friends and I will always find our way back here as we are heading back uptown.. unless we can find a better 24/7 korean place. (And no, the one down the street beside cha time sucks more than this one)"}
{"text":"Actually not a bad place for Korean food in k-town. We originally wanted to go to a different restaurant for Korean food but that one was too packed. Not wanting to wait, we came across this place and it was pretty decent. It was cold outside so we ordered a Korean hotpot. It had the clear noodles, veggies, octopus and chicken. The dish was filling and satisfying, I highly recommend trying out their hotspots! I would come back here again, portion sizes were good, was definitely enough for 2 people.
Pros: good service (wasn't too busy) variety of appetizers and good hotpot
Cons: no major cons but food took some time"}
{"text":"Pros:
- Affordable prices.
- Staff were friendly and accommodating. 
- Food was filling. 
- Bathrooms were clean, which is a rarity...especially since they were basement bathrooms at an Asian restaurant!

Cons:
- The food was average. Nothing super special. 
- We ended up getting stomach aches after eating our meals.
- Complementary side dishes were mediocre."}
{"text":"15 dollars for 9 pieces of dukbokki the same amount can be bought just outside this place by the lady at the cart for like 5 dollars"}
{"text":"I came here yesterday with a coworker for a quick lunch. Normally, if I'm heading out for Korean food, I go to Nak Won next door or Narooe up the street but since I hadn't tried this place yet, I figured I'd give it a go.

My coworker simply ordered Chicken Fried Rice for lunch but I wanted to compare their bento boxes to those I've had elsewhere so I opted for the Teriyaki Chicken. On the menu, it says that the chicken is deep fried (which I didn't want) and when I questioned the server about it, she said she could have it grilled for me. Perfect!

Our side dishes and salad came of which I was not overly impressed with and after picking at random things, decided to leave the lot of them.

My poor coworker, who doesn't seem to have much lunch when coming out with me for Korean food, didn't like her rice at all and I must say, it didn't look overly appetizing either. Even pouring a boatload of Teriyaki sauce over it, in an attempt to add some flavour, seemed all for naught. It's never a good thing when someone say's 'well, it's edible'.

My Teriyaki Chicken on the other hand was quite good. The chicken, although it did come grilled, still had a different texture than I'm used to but the flavour was definitely there. The salad consisted of shredded cabbage, sliced apples and oranges and had a very nice dressing. Accompanying this was three Gyoza and rice. The salad was nice albeit a little difficult to eat because the cabbage was sliced so long and the Gyoza was really tasty.

Overall, my dish was good but not better than those at the places I frequent. What will make me not come back is the service. Once I placed my order, the server was trying to take my coworkers menu right from her hand as she was asking questions. To the point where she had to grab it back. They were not attentive at all and didn't seem to care if we were there or not.

I wouldn't recommend this place, especially with so many other Korean restaurants in the area. 

Service - 1 star
Cleanliness - 2 stars
Food - 3 stars (based on my dish only)

Overall?  Meh, I've experienced better."}
{"text":"It was okay.  Pork bone and potato soup was a good portion for two with 6 bones.

But the server delivered the rice to the wrong person and they brought the rice for the correct person.  Then they charged +$2 for the additional rice. :O"}
{"text":"I was pregnant while visited this restaurant, therefor I can't drink too much tea, so I asked for a hot water. This is the only restaurant that I've been to that don't give you hot water. I mean, you can heat up the tea, why not water? Simply is because they are lazy to do so. Oh, by the way, they also don't separate bills. For these kind of service, I am not leaving them any tips. (Normally I do give pretty decent tips). Will never come back again."}
{"text":"Went a couple of days ago for the first time. There were many reviews repeating that the food is nothing special...and they're right. 

I've had my fair share of meals in Korean restaurants and there was nothing impressive about our meals that night. We ordered a chicken katsu and bulgogi on sizzling plate. I've had better chicken katsu elsewhere and the bulgogi was over-flavoured. The side dishes were average.

They had buttons to call over the servers, who were prompt but unless called the servers never really went around which is good/bad depending on what type of customer you are. 

Overall, not bad but nothing special. I probably won't come again."}
{"text":"Formerly Toong, this new incarnation is Pyung Won House or Pyung Won Jip via the direct Korean reading of the sign. \"Jip\" means \"house\". It does brisk business Friday around 7 pm. 

I found the floor exceptionally dirty. They didn't bother to sweep up after the, presumably, last diners at the table. 

A few favorites on the menu failed to impress. I was pleased to find yukhoe (aka yook hwe aka yuk hui aka yukhwai aka the dusty buckaroo). Yukhoe (pronounced like UK) is a Korean version of steak tartar. Both dishes originated with the Mongols who swept into the Korean peninsula as well as the gates of Western Europe. The Korean version is dolled up with loads of sesame oil, pine nuts, garlic, and a farm fresh raw egg (no bacon or rich creamery butter). It's usually served on a bed of shredded Asian pear[1]. The Pyung Won House version I found had a nasty after taste. I really wanted to like it but couldn't get past a certain sourness with each bite.

Another favorite is budae jjigae. The budae jjigae means roughly army tent or army camp stew. It's a kind of \"stone soup\". It was originally brewed by people around American military bases using scavenged US army chow. It can contain hot dogs, spam, and ham. This is a serious comfort food to many Koreans but its origins seem to embarrass many locals. Korea is a rich nation and many seem to want to forget its recent past as a nation of impoverished people feeding itself off of whatever fell off a US army truck.[2]

The budae jjigae was pretty decent although the caldron was over full and at a precarious angle. It made it very hard to ladle out the food.

The naengmyun was different from Nak Wan but pleased my dining companions. It was a simpler version but still pretty good.

Remember to look for the table side door bell to get service. Have no fear ringing that thing.

_______________

[1] Koreans doggedly claim the \"Asian pear\" is called a \"pear\" and call normal pears \"Western pears\". Difficult people, Koreans.

[2] A Lonely Planet author got in some hot water a few years back with the Seoul Tourism department when he failed to dance around budae jjigae's origins. http://www.zenkimchi.com/FoodJournal/news-media/shameless-self-promotion/joe-harpers-bazaar-2/

||Budae jjigae or Johnsontang is a unique dish that originated in the hungry years after the Korean War when tins of ham, sausages and baked beans were bought on the black market around American army bases (such as Yongsan) and mixed with noodles and vegetable scraps to make a meal. Try it at Nolboo in Hongik.||

If that passage upsets Seoul's tourism officials, I've heard the dish described even less charitably as being made from food scraps fished out of the garbage."}
{"text":"A happening place on a Friday night!

Service: Despite having a call button, there were only 3 waiters so we had to keep reminding them to bring us water and food/drinks that we ordered. The waiter that took our order didn't write anything down (maybe English wasn't so good so he didn't understand us) so we had to tell him again. However, there was one lady server that had better English and helped us correct our bill when it was wrong. We did wait a long time for our dishes though, especially the pork and rice cakes. 

Food: We did KBBQ and ordered two servings of short ribs and pork belly. The cut of the short ribs were good quality, but it was not marinated so it had no taste. The pork belly was really good! Lean, but tasted great. They provided lettuce, other greens, sauce, pepper and garlic for us to wrap our meat in. With this meal, we also got two soups, rice, and all the korean side dishes. They gave us unlimited quantities of the sides.

Sweet and Sour Pork - A very large portion. The pork was crispy and tender. They added green apples and oranges to the mix. Very saucy! I really liked this dish! We got the combo that included 4 beers with a choice of a dish. Good price for this combo.

Spicy Rice Cakes: Too spicy for my liking, but my friends enjoyed it.

Price: Pretty good! for 7 people, our total came to about $180. Not bad.

Ambience: Bigger than a lot of other korean places near by. Suitable for a group whereas as other places are not."}
{"text":"They changed their menu for the worse, so we stopped going. It changed to smaller portions, more money, and less tasty recipes. With so many other great options, this one kind of falls off the radar."}
{"text":"I go here quite often for the Chicken Katsu, which is the only dish I have tried so far. There is very unique and delicious sauce drizzled across the chicken and the dressing on the salad is very fresh. The portion is perfect for one person and is not as big compared to most places. There were six side dishes on the side including kimchi, some sour salad, and more. 

There is also a grill attached to each of the tables for those who want to come here for korean bbq. The place is a bit cramped considering it is normally packed. It's a perfect place for family and friends, and the service is very quick as well."}
{"text":"Nice environment and typical Korean restaurant. The only issue is they only accept debit card and credit card on $20 or above, which means it may be not convenient to pay AA."}
{"text":"Read it as 2.5 stars.
Ordered two dishes. Food was decent enough. The sides were also average. The food is good but nothing spectacular. 1 star off for just average food. I literally sat down and was looking at the menu for 10 seconds tops and the waitress wanted to take my order right away. I said I need a minute and she came back in 30 seconds. I wasnt ready to order yet! 1 star off for that.
When it was time to pay, they over charged me on BOTH dishes by a few dollars. I hate when restos do this. For that .5 stars off. I will not come back again for the lackluster service and over charging compared to menu pricing."}
{"text":"Worst service. 

Went to this restaurant despite the reviews. Ordered 6 dishes and out of the 6, 3 of the were incorrect. The server forced one of my friends to just settle with that dish. The other 2 we sent back but the server kept insisting that it was our fault for the wrong order."}
{"text":"Pretty pricy Korean place, won't come back again. Came here wanting to have BBQ, but a plate of short ribs is $15 while I can get AYCE for that price somewhere else. Ended up ordering regular stuff.
Tried cow ribs soup (so small), grilled fish (I swear the fish weights less than 0.5lb), and rice sausage (flavour was bland, no seasoning)
Not coming here again that's for sure"}
{"text":"Food was good, friendly service here. I ordered the lunch special just before 3pm. Sides were modest at best but would def come back."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant several times under this new management and when it was Toong. The food is good, but I prefer the Korean restaurants near by. The side dishes are not as plentiful as other places (but decent) and the kalbi isn't as flavourful either, but passable. However, if I'm going to pay the same amount for it, I might as well go next door.

This place does have Korean BBQ grills, but I have yet to try it. Maybe next time I will come back here for that.

I like the atmosphere because it's bright and the tables and decor look modern. Not much to comment about the staff because you just press a button and they come to your table!"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to take his cousin here for her last night in Toronto. After raving about Korean food, I'm distraught I brought her to this place. Firstly, we stood at the door waiting to be given a table. No luck. Then went to the bar and asked to be seated. The gentlemen came to the table when we were ready to order. He took down our order without writing it down. I'm no one to tell anyone how to do their job. But if you plan to memorize my order kindly get it right. Of course of the 5 things we ordered we only got 2. Went back, told him we were tied of waiting and to cancel the order. Instead, he placed the order again. What a nightmare. My husband asked to speak to the manager. Her response to our grievance was \"no problem.\" Ok, I'm telling you we did have problems. Her response \"no problem.\" In other words its cool if you don't come back. Which of course we won't! Even with all these issues, we looked forward to the meal. Sorry, another fail. Korean food is so delicious with all it's flavors I find it talented you can make it taste this bad. The beef short ribs were tiny and dry. Steer clear folks! Tons of other places on yonge and finch that are crap loads better!"}
{"text":"Severely, severely understaffed.  

No amount of good food can make up for the \"service\" (if any).  Besides a tasty pork bone soup, there aren't many positives I can say about this place.  And if you've seen most of reviews, I for the most part try to bring businesses into a positive light but I get how hard it is to survive in arguably one of the most competitive industries...ever.  And this is in North York Korean town, need I remind you that there are a butt-load of places that can take your place?

But not with this place.

This place is a classic example of where expectations are set but not met.  I'll just list off the things that they did and I guess what made this place just blow it for me.

1. When we came in, we were greeted nicely and one of my friends (a party of 6 we were) asked if they accepted credit card/debit card.  The server said that they did accept credit card/debit card and cash.  Upon paying the bill, we were given a single bill and I politely asked for 6 separate bills.  The other server then said, \"oh, we don't accept credit card/debit card below bills under $10\".  I would have been understanding had this been mentioned from the very beginning but as I'm about to list the other faults of this place, you'll see why my patience has run dry with them.

2. Their \"lunch\" specials on their menus, are supposedly not available on a Sunday.  Of course that wasn't indicated anywhere on the menu, so while I don't blame service for it, I do blame for clumsiness on the owner's part.

3.  The 1st server (there were only two servers), seated our party of 6 and decided to put a table of 6 and 4 together.  We didn't ask for it, but we were pleasantly suprised at this gesture.  What wasn't so pleasant was the 2nd server that came up to us and \"you're not supposed to have two tables\".  We were taken aback and just said that the other server arranged it for us.  The 2nd server gave a cut-eye stare at the 1st server. (Now that's drama that none of us wants to witness, keep that business in the back of the house).

4. 3 out of the 6 of us ordered GamJaTang (Pork Bone Soup).  None of us were given bowls to discard our bones.  When I finally flagged down the server, after several attempts of pressing the button and waving her down, I asked her if we could get some bowls to put our pork bone in.  I was to about forgive them for just forgetting to provide them on the 1st go, but when she came back, she gave me 1 measly rice bowl...(how on earth am I supposed to fit my bones in there).  I kindly asked her again, if we could have a \"bigger\" bowl to put our bones in.  She finally clued in and she came back with 1 big bowl. By this point, just decide to give the bigger bowl to the two people and I would make do with the tiny rice bowl.

Having said all this, the pork bone soup was actually decent and very tasty.  The banchan was ok, not the best.  It's a shame that I have to list out these incidents that all happened in a course of a meal.  Truth be told, I do feel sorry for the two servers, because they looked stressed and are running all over the place.  I can't imagine what's happening inside of their minds.

I'm just going to say this, and I hope the owners read this.  Me listing out these \"moments\" is not here to punish the staff that work here but to merely bring out the point that, good food is not sufficient for a successful restaurant.  Service plays an integral role and from my consumer opinion, this place is understaffed and the poor service is a result of that.  

I would implore that the owners review this and take this advice because it appears that I'm not the only one who feels this way."}
{"text":"Food was yummy! Tried the sea food hot pot, it was delicious and the portion was huge! No complaints on the food :) 

Only reason I didn't give it a full 5 stars is because the heat was not on in the restuarant and the doors kept being opened, so everyone was freezing! But with that aside, I'll be back! :)"}
{"text":"Was here for dinner recently at 6pm. Didn't have a problem w/ seating and got a table right away. They also take reservations. 

Like Nak Wan, Pyung Won House also provides every table w/ several dishes of mini appetizers. There was glass noodles, seaweed, kimchi, fish cake, bean sprouts, etc. 

I usually prefer eating my fav dish at every Korean restaurant... which is the Soondubu Chigae (soft tofu stewed in a hot spicy broth with seafood and vegetables). However, I noticed the price was slightly more than what next door charges so I ordered smth else instead. 

Kimchi Fried Rice - loved this. It was so tasty and wish the dish was a bit bigger! Still got to pack less than half. 
DDuk Bok Yi - Friend ordered this. Thought the fish cake was delicious
Fried Dumplings - Came w/ a spicy sauce & also  spicy mayo. The mayo might have been for the small salad on the dish but it was so good w/ the dumplings! 

Would not mind coming back again! It was clean and service was fast and prompt."}
{"text":"One of worst dining experiences ever. My friends and I (5 of us ) decided to have some Korean food here cuz apparently this restaurant is kinda popular (and you have to wait in line at 9pm), it turns out the food is really mediocre here. The bill was $64 something we gave $90 in cash, hoping to get some change in order to split the bill between us. Firstly the waiter brought back $25, one $20, one $5. I asked the waiter to split the $20 into four $5 bills, and the waiter obviously thought it some kind of hassle and swore in Korean. I don't understand Korean but I guess it pretty much wasn't something nice."}
{"text":"NEVER EVER AGAIN 

Server gave us wrong order .... decided he was right about it . Forced us to eat it (but did not ) Manager said it's fine but had to starve for another 25 minutes to get the right food .... 

Chicken tasted funky , very low quality chicken . Do not recommend if you are super hungry .

If you are drunk by all means come by !"}
{"text":"Their sauce of the Albap is different from the regular bibimbap. I felt like there's coconut milk in it ;)"}
{"text":"When I go to Korean restaurants, I usually judge them by their bulgolgi dishes and that's exactly what I ordered (with rice, of course!). It was very very good, but it was much thicker then other places I've been to. Bulgogi would normally be thinly sliced beef but here, it was thicker than I expected. It did not kill the  flavor but I felt like it was a bit chewy though. I'd for sure come back here."}
{"text":"Pyung Won House is conveniently located just across from Finch Subway Station and it opens 24 hours!! (a few big posters of the wall screaming to me that they never close!)

The inside looks clean and the deco are quite nice. 2 big tv on each end showing Korean soap opera which is great when your friend got bored with you or the food... I was wondering why he just stared at me but not really looking at me...

Banchen though plentiful but most of them tasted bland...... We left most of them untouched and it is really rare for that to happen as my Yelp friend would never waste food.

Lunch Specials if order during other time just $1 extra so pricing here is quite reasonable.

Pork Bone Soup ($7.99) was not too spicy as there's no complaints at all. The order was quite sizable.

Bibimbap with Spicy Beef ($8.99) was A-OK since it was served pipping hot. 

Menu selection here is quite extensive, decent services, great location and decent prices... Pyung Won House might be the place I would come back in the middle of the night when I am hungry...

They accepts MC and Visa too! I don't even need any cash!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE! I'll first start off with the food, we were a group of 4 but not that hungry so all we ordered was 2 servings of pork belly and it was fairly a good amount, but the slices were really thin(a little bit thicker than bacon) and came with soup of ur choice (choose kimchi) food was ok. SERVICE! First off when we arrived it looks at least 5 minutes for someone to seat us, and they have a button when you are ready to order, we pressed it and waited 5 mins again. We ordered and they didn't even give us water after 10 mins we asked them for it. They didn't give us side dishes after 10 minutes, and our pork belly until 15 mins. Than we were still waiting for our lettuce and we asked them if than can bring it. Than after i payed I didn't want to even think of tipping anyone so just as were about to leave the waiter stops us and asks for a tip. HE SAID WE HAVE TO TIP HIM 5$. I was planning on giving him 1$ bc that's literally how bad the service was, but I couldn't find it so i just gave him 2$ and he was like no ,3$ more. He was asking all of us and we were like we don't have any more money. He looked at us like money would instantly grow out of our heads! He literally wouldn't let us leave. He was like we have a credit card machine but none of us had any. And he than saw my 20$ which i was not planning to use whatsoever and he was like I don't think so and he said he could bring my 20$, TAKE MY 5$ and give me 15$ back. He kept telling me he \"doesn't think so\" that we don't have money. I WORK HARD FOR THIS MONEY AND HE LITERALLY JUST BROUGHT THE SIDE DISHES AND REFILLED OUR WATER THATS IT! I don't recommend this place for their crap service (a woman was serving us too while she was eating her mouth full). Never ever ever going back to this place. IF I COULD GIVE 0 STARS I WOULD! ALSO THE. TABLE BESIDE US ORDERED AND GOT THEIRS 20+ MINS AFTER! But they're was only 2 other groups (including mine) and they weren't even serving us nor the other group. They also had a bad experience and i truly honestly have never ever thought someone would have the audacity to do what that man just did. ALSO HE DIDNT LET ME KEEP THE RECEIPT! HE TOOK IT FROM ME AND NEVER GAVE IT BACK!"}
{"text":"I use to come here pretty frequently when I come uptown for karaoke or other such event. The food has always been decent, service was always subpar and there have been a few occasions where issues like \"you need to order a certain amount of table bbq to eat here\" happened, though this \"rule\" seems to be inconsistent. They like to throw on random rules if they think they're not going to make enough money for your table. (Me and 3 other friends got a hankering for bbq so we came here to eat some bbq pork but they refused to let us only order 1 bbq serving and insisted that because we were 4 people we needed to order at least 2 bbq servings otherwise we couldn't eat here, so we left.)

However, a recent altercation has basically put this restaurant off my list forever and it seems like, from reading other reviews, I wasn't the only customer put through this.

It seems like common practice for them to over charge on food. Not only that but my experience involves them forcing me to pay twice. The first time I paid there was a slip at the beginning of the receipt from a previous transaction that said \"declined\" that they didn't tear off so when I made my transaction via credit card, they thought mine was declined even though it had printed a cardholder purchase receipt with the transaction CLEARLY MARKED ON IT. After half an hour of trying to explain to this server that, no, my transaction went through here is my GODDAMN RECEIPT, she called the manager over and I have to explain AGAIN how the credit card system works. I'm explaining their credit card system to them? Yes. Because they don't know how their damn credit card system works so all they see is declined from the last transaction that wasn't mine. After a good long while of arguing that my transaction went through HENCE MY RECEIPT THAT SAYS CARDHOLDER WITH THE AMOUNTS AND SUCH PULLED OFF MY CARD, my boyfriend was pleading that we just pay again and leave because he was tired of having to deal with this. I was tempted to just tell them to call the police and settling it there but I ended up conceding and paying again.

I was fuming so the next day I called my credit card company to see if the transaction went through and they did indeed charge my credit card twice. I asked my credit card company if they could do anything about it and they said no because I authorized it via chip.

Moral of the story? Don't eat here unless you want horrible service, and to get overcharged on your bill, or forced to pay twice. People here don't even know how their system works, not even the manager so it's common to get overcharged on it or double charged.

I have called the restaurant to get reimbursed for my money, the owner still has not replied.

Btw if anyone has any advice on what to do in this situation as of this point pm me. I know it's only a $30 bill, but the principle of it pisses me off. People go to a restaurant for the convenience and food. Not to be harassed to pay twice because you don't know how to operate your payment systems.

Go to Nak Won's next door. Surprised with all the reviews they get that are bad that Nak Won hasn't just swallowed up the competition."}
{"text":"First off where the HELL do I start. Not only am I royally disgusted but appalled at the service I received this past Saturday. This place is right around the corner from where I recently moved and a quick short walk from my condo. My friends and I decided to go for a walk and try out something local we haven't tried before. 

We walked in (mind you there were 3 of us) and waited to be seated. The lady working the tables waved her hands in a \"come on in\" motion and pointed to a table. So far so good, so I thought. When we sat down we were scanning the menu and trying to decide what we should get (since I have never had Korean before). The lady returned with 3 glasses and a jug of water, she slammed it down on the table (some water spilled) and didn't say a word. POOR customer service right there!

We waited for about 10 mins before trying to get the servers attention. We even closed the menu's (golden rule as to let them know we are ready to order) and still nothing. An oriental single lady walked in and was seated right away, given and menu and within 3-5 mins placed her order. At this point we were sitting for 15 minutes or more. I raised my hand to try again to get the ladies attention. She look at me then turned her back and walked into the back where I could no longer see her.

At that point we were pissed, hungry and felt WAY out of place. We ended up leaving which is a shame because this place was so close to my place and if the service was the other way I would probably been a regular!"}
{"text":"I've come here a fair amount of times, and most of times I've had a good experience with the food and fairly friendly service. Nothing out of the world but good enough that i found myself returning occasionally. However because of one recent experience i had, I will not be going back.

One night, 2 of my friends and I came here for kbbq (Ive only come to this restaurant for their regular menu at this point so it was my first kbbq experience here). We ordered a couple of different meats as well as their soondae and tteokbokki. Overall, the food was really delicious and came in fair portions. 

The bill came to around $100 (we ordered more than we could finish). When we got our change back we start counting out the tips. Before we were done, a waitresses passes by, glances at the change and says coldly \"minimum 10%\". This made us quite annoyed as we were not notified of this prior to ordering and the rude way she told us when we weren't even done counting out the tips. We clearly looked un happy as another older waitresses came by and explained to us that the kbbq option requires a 10% minimum tip. We argued that although we are not hesitating to tip more than 10%, we felt that it was wrong and unfair that no one had let us know prior to us ordering. We ended up giving the minimum 10% as we did not want trouble and it was clear that they would not let us leave until we did. 

In my opinion, tips should be earned with at least decent service, not expected. So for them to have essentially demanded tip from us is absolutely ridiculous. It is ok to charge a service fee but this must be made known to the customer beforehand. 

Overall, despite the good food this place offers, the bad experience I had ruined their reputation for me. Will not be recommending this place or returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times before and I considered the experiences acceptable, but this time we were treated very rudely. 

I came with 2 friends at around 11:30pm so the restaurant was only half full. Only one of us hadn't had dinner yet so we ordered one deokbokki for the three of us. 

They didnt give us water, plates, napkins or side dishes. Other Korean places I've been to give side dishes for just one order, but I won't complain about that. It's ridiculous that they didn't even give us water, even when we asked for it. We also asked for a few plates and the owner/manager lady (unsure of her position) gave us really nasty looks and complained that we ordered only one dish. She said that we should have ordered at least two dishes. Well why didn't she tell us before we ordered? We would've just gotten up and gone to a different place. Nevertheless, that is not a valid reason to deny us of basic dining needs and basic service.

The only options are 1. we come and order one dish since only one of us needs to eat or 2. we go somewhere else and they don't get our business at all. Keep in mind, the restaurant was only half full so we weren't even making them lose customers.

I definitely won't be coming back again. There are plenty of Korean restaurants nearby that treat their customers appropriately."}
