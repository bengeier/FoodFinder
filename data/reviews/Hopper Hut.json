{"text":"Awsome food, I was eating these pan cakes called hoppers / apams after a long time. We were are large group of 10+ people who were both vegetarian and non-vegetarians and there was a good selection for both.

Only one problem is that they have almost non/ limited selection for someone who cannot handle spicy food like my MIL.

I enjoyed the food and in fact over ate, I will most definitly visit again when I am in Toronto the next time. My wife loved the Mutton Curry, I enjoyed the Sumbol both the onion and the coconut version. The spice really hit the spot. I did not try the Rooti as I was full with the pancakes itself... i saw few people chowing it down, maybe the next time"}
{"text":"For the best in traditional Sri Lanka delicacies, it's worth the trek out to Scarborough. I;ve been a fan of Hopper Hut for many years. Last time I was there they had renovated not only the dining room, but the Take_Out counter as well. I think they even improved what was already delicious food. For the un-familiar, it is unique, spicy and very filling food. And delicious. (Ask for some butter chillies to nibble on too!)"}
{"text":"Went last night based on the write up in the  Weekly Yelp and I am definitely a fan! For $35, including a big tip, the two of us ate like royalty. We had: Hopper Combo #2, plain rotis (2), pitthu combo with the mutton curry (soooo good), and a vegetarian lampries. 

Sure it's not a fancy location or atmosphere, but the food is so good and so inexpensive that absolutely outweighs the lack of ambiance. It's not an \"impress the boss/in-laws\" kind of place. It's a \"i love tasty food\" place.

For cheap and cheerful and amazingly tasty, you can't beat the Hopper Hut."}
{"text":"THERE WAS HAIR IN MY PATTY!!!!!! On top of that I paid for 3 mothakam and the guy only gave me one. When there are 20 people in line there is one guy at the counter UNDERSTAFFED. Please do not go here. If you want good Sri Lankan catering go to RajaRam caterers or if you want good take-out go to New Spiceland Take-out.
Thanks."}
{"text":"This is my first foray into Sri Lankan cuisine and it was a pleasant experience. Tried two Tamil staples - Khothu Roti (chopped roti shells stir fried with meat, eggs, veggies, and spices) and a Lamprie (a flavorful smorgasbord of your choice of meat/seafood,  eggplant, anchovies, potatoes, onions, sambol and more topped over rice wrapped in fragrant banana leaves). Portions are quite generous with well-rounded flavours - salty, sweet, tangy, spicy. Prices are fair for what you get - about $9-14 a dish. Dining area is hidden behind the front counter, where trays of snacks greet you upon entering the restaurant. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Horrible. The service is horrible, food smells like its been reheated from a few days ago and is about to go bad, tables are nasty and sticky. This place used to be great several years ago, now it's a dump with garbage food and service."}
{"text":"Good tamil/south indian food, spicy too. Value for $

You should try the various Biriyani combos here... definitely stimulating your taste-buds ;-)"}
{"text":"This place was recommended by a Sri Lankan friend of mine and I've been back several times since. They have a good variety of short eats. I highly recommend their mutton rolls. If you want to get a taste of this and that, try one of their lampries. Their hoppers are light and fluffy. Excellent value for money."}
{"text":"For those of you who have never had Sri Lankan food before - They love to have their food spicy.

Food:
We ordered Plain Hopper, Veggie Rolls, Masala Dosai and Vegetarian Plate. 

Plain Hopper: The plain hopper was almost exactly like a Dosa (Rice Crepe) but it was in a shape of a bowl. I am not a 100% certain but it had a hint of sweetness to it, so I'm assuming they add a little sugar to their Dosa batter for these hoppers, this hopper was useful to reduce the fire caused in my mouth from the vegetarian plate.

Veggie Rolls: Veggie rolls were mashed potatoes with various spices, turmeric that was deep fried in a bread batter, the inside tasted almost exactly like Masala Dosai filling. These rolls were fairly spicy, they served it with a hot ketchup!! I wouldn't order this one again until I build up some more steel plates on my tongue to handle the heat, but my partner who can handle much hotter foods enjoyed it.

Masala Dosai: I love south indian food and I have had masala dosa at many restaurants in the past. The one from here was excellent, it was more oily than what I am used to but it was still yummy. The chutneys that this was served with was just awesome, there was this red coconut chutney that was very flavourful. The filling was a potato filing and the Sambar served with it had actual whole cooked lentils in it which was an interesting texture, usually Sambar is served with lentils completely mashed up. I enjoyed this one very much and I would order it again. This was a main course that I ordered that wasn't spicy compared to everything else that we ate.

Vegetarian Plate: Serving size of this plate was massive, it could easily feed two people. It came on a stainless steel plate all wrapped up in a wax brown paper in the shape of a square. The brown paper is the same one used by butchers! When we unwrapped the brown paper there was a banana leaf with all the food wrapped inside it. Once we unwrapped the banana leaf, all the different dishes were mixed in served on a bed of rice. There was a potato dish, a veggie dish that appeared to be made of flat green beans, a dish with some coconut powder in it and a lentil dish. It was very spicy but there was rice that I was using to mix in to reduce the heat. The experience of eating on a banana leaf made ordering this worth while, I would order this again but I would share this with another person.

Drinks:
Chai: I wanted a chai, I have ordered a chai at a Sri Lankan restaurant before and it was nice and spicy, but the one here was just a tea bag served with hot water, milk and sugar. I was a little disappointed that it was not authentic where it is steeped with a mix of ginger and spices.


Ambiance:
For the price that you pay the ambiance was alright. The place is bright, so not good for a romantic dinner, plus the spicy food might have you breathing fire at your date, depending on what you order. The chairs could've been more comfy, but I'm not fussy about that stuff I was here for the food. When you enter this place it almost looks like a bakery with this huge display case in front, only in behind the display case is all the awesome Sri Lankan food that they offer, if you would like to be seated there is a walkway to the left that leads you into their dining area. Table was set when we arrived and we did not have to wait for a table, the dinner napkins are paper but were nice and thick.

Bathrooms: 
The washroom was clean, which is what I like to see because if a washroom is dirty I think the kitchen would be in the same condition. They have a hand wash station next to the washrooms because a lot of people eat with their hands, so if you enjoy that it is recommended that you wash your hands before and after your meal.

Service:
Service was fast and they offered suggestions when we asked. Our server kept our glasses of water filled as required which was important for me as I'm not used to the spice level in the stuff that I ordered.

Parking:
There is plenty free parking available in the parking lot right at the front of this restaurant."}
{"text":"Delicious SriLankan Food Here. The chicken biriyani is Really good, perfectly spiced, leaves your mouth tingling and satisfied.
The veda is well prepared, and tastes great too.
I would come here again when in the area."}
{"text":"On my return visit I opted for take out. The place was busy on a Tuesday evening, a sign of just how good this little gem is. We got the chicken Lamprie and a few bite size samosas, and it all came to $10.00. 

The Lampries are massive and good to feed 2 people. The chicken was tender and juicy, and everything inside (rice,curry sauce,potatoes,sardines,egg and pickled veggies) were all spicy and delicious. I love this thing! The samosas were a bit too greasy, but tasty nonetheless. 

I am so glad that this place is whiting easy reach for me because this place offers really good food, friendly service and amazing value."}
{"text":"We came here after seeing some really nice yelp photos, regardless of the bad reviews. The food looks nice, and it ends there.
1. The place is filthy, they didn't even clean off our table and we were the only ones in there. 
2. All we could hear coming from the kitchen was some guy sneezing, coughing and hacking all over.
3. The food looks nice but there was no flavour except salt! Beef roti was so tough you couldn't chew it. Corriander chutney was NOT fresh at all, and again no flavour but salt. 

Please don't waste your time, not sure how these places even stay open."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday for dinner with the family.

Location: The area outside the restaurant is a little dirty. The restaurant has barred windows.

Restaurant: Once you walk in, you will see their takeout section, walk in a little more and it a small restaurant. 

Staff/Service: There were 2 people taking care of the whole restaurant, so service was a little slow but friendly, so if you are in a rush don't do the sit down.

Food: Good Sri Lankan food. We asked for the mild heat because that is the lowest we can go for the kids but it came out to be more spicy for them than we hoped for! We ordered: Combo Hopper 2 $7, served with spicy raw onions ( wished we got the coconut instead of the onions). The kids loved the hoppers because it's the only thing that had no spice and bread like shapped into a bowl. The shrimp Lampries (spicy) $11.50 is tasty too, wrapped in banana leave, the key is to mix all the ingredients up when it arrives at your table. String Hopper Kothu-mutton  (spicy) $7.00, which is like compacted vermicelli dry noodle dish. Lastly, the mutton curry $6.00 was the smallest dish and mildly spiced, it was good but small.

I would come back here if I was craving Sri Lankan food because the price is good for the amount you get for most dishes. Total including tax was around $36 and fed a family of 5 people with left overs."}
{"text":"Hopper hut was pretty good.  Had the mutton kothu rotti and a mutton roll from take out.  Large portion and very filling!  This is coming from a guy that once ate a 5lb turkey.  Probably could split it in two portions to eat. At 7 dollars total cost it would 3.50 for a filling meal. The kothu rotti is a dollar cheaper than Babu's and just as good.  I will be returning to try their Lampries next time. Another hole in the wall with good food."}
{"text":"Pathetic dosa. We just came back from a most frustrating dosa experience. I think their other foods wrapped in banana leaf and stuff are good...but dosa is beyond bad. I'm not one to write reviews...too lazy...but this I had to. It wasn't cooked fully...not crispy...the batter they used to make the dosa tasted stale, esp the uncooked part. Please do not go their for dosa that's all I can say."}
{"text":"So many delicious vegetarian short eats. I absolutely love this place. I lived in Sri Lanka for four months, and eating their food makes me so happy.

I've only ever gotten take out. I load up on stuffed roti and fried delicious things and bring them back for my friends and family. I also make sure to get lots of plain roti (comes with pol sambol) and red lentil curry. 

A magical delicious place which is worth the drive from Buffalo."}
{"text":"I did not know what to order so I settled for the khotu roti. I was in the lineup and another lady who was ordering food as well said \"you can sit and eat\" as they have a dining area. 
As I sat to eat and was enjoying the dinner a Tamil guy with a beard showed up and said \"excuse me you can't eat here if it's takeout\" lol I was shocked and insulted because other ppl were sitting there as well. 
Im walking out and never coming here again! How unprofessionally rude!"}
{"text":"We were in Sri Lanka recently and this restaurant was better than most places we ate at in Sri Lanka.  Highly recommended!

If you are vegetarian, tell the waitress and she will give you the veg version of the string hopper combo which is outstanding.

The hoppers (appa) are better than anywhere else. If you are veg then order the \"plain hoppers\" with a side of dal curry to put in them."}
{"text":"Sri lankan food is like indian food in high def. Flavors are deliciously overwhelming, portions are shockingly excessive and the price was dirt cheap! 

As I've said before I'm having a full on love affair with indian cuisine, be it east west or island, I just can't seem to get enough. Now I'm not sure if it is because they do vegetarian so well, or if it is the intoxicating layers of flavor. 

A few true Canadians and Susan ventured to the Hopper Hut. With a gleam in our eyes and an adventurous palate we perused the menu with high expectations. Let's just say for me anyways, thank goodness for the pictures! As a new indian eater some of the commonly known terms were lost on me. So I stuck out my tongue and tasted our waiters' recommendation. 

I had the seafood lampries, basically a few curried dishes with fish potatoes and rice. The massive paper pouch held a cacophony of flavours, some I loved to taste, and some I'd love never to taste again. But fantastic overall!

We each nibbled on the others' platters and found that we could barely make a dent in the sheer amount of food. A subtle hint from the waiter would have been helpful, but we each left full and fired up. Literally fired up, the food was HOT!

So if you go to this delightful little place, come with an empty stomach an adventurous palate and make sure you try a hopper. Great company doesn't hurt either. 

The only reason dropped a star was because towards the end of our meal the owners lit some sort overpowering incense and I had to literally run from the building due to a powerful allergic reaction. . I'm still sporting the hives to prove it. 

Bottom line...sri lankan is my newest crush!"}
{"text":"After reading reviews here, I went with a lamprais (a beef version).  The beef was tender and moderately well spiced.  The eggplant, dal, and potatoes were all serviceable (I ignored the fish cutlet and dried fish since I'm not a big fan of seafood).  But what really made the dish for me were the pickles as they were beautifully spicy and crunchy and gave the dish that kick that it needed.  The rice was a just a touch mushy though.  But I enjoyed my meal and for only $9.00, I left the place completely stuffed."}
{"text":"Been looking to try Sri Lanka food for some time. This place came recommended. It is mostly a take out joint. They do have place at the back that functions as full service restaurant but you wouldn't want to take a date there.  Food was pretty good.  I tried the 2 hopper combo with fish curry. This is decently spicy. My wife who is vegetarian tried egg plant curry and did not like it and then tried Aaloo tomato curry and that lousy her a bit disappointed as well. Apparently they have special vegetarian stuff on Fridays.   I cleaned out my food. Just fyi..if you are from india,.hopper is nothing but aapam.
Next time we will try the food cooked in banana leaf."}
{"text":"This my first foray into trying these dishes from this region. Knowing this regions repute for hot dishes I was looking forward to this visit. My DC didn't want to stray too far off the beaten path so ordered a biryani. I wanted to try their claim to fame dishes so ordered Kothu Roti with Chicken and Lamprais with chicken as well (should have gone with shrimp) 
The take out was busy but we had to wait a bit to find out that there is sizable dinning area in the back. Ah well you live you learn. 
On to the main event. 
Biryani was OK not what I expect from this dish. Spiced well though and the mild version had a kick. The chicken served with it was dry as well. 
Kothu Roti. I didn't like this dish. Hot but the bread felt kind of stale (not sure its supposed to be this way) and meat was dry as well. Hmm maybe now that I have a reference point I will know what to compare it with if I try it elsewhere.
Lamprais. This was good and well worth the visit. I had the spicy version and this is a generous portion. The meat cooked in with the rice was moist (owing the this method of cooking). Nice heat with a complex combo of spices. I liked the dried fish as well (though some people will refrain for it). This was a lot of food for 2 people and I ended up taking some home. 
4 Stars based on Lamprais (very reasonably priced( as I don't think I will order other items in the future if I am back to this place. 
A hidden em in this faceless plaza."}
{"text":"Great Sri Lankan food. Got the fish lamprais and the string hoppers (with mutton curry). 

Fish lamprais was great. Good combination of ingredients including the fish curry, mini fish (no idea what the correct name is), eggplant, some kind of pickle, potato, etc. Only complaint is I don't think that there was any seeni sambol (common ingredient of lamprais). Also the rice: meat ratio was higher than what I like (lots of comments mention the big size, but really a lot of it consists of rice). 

String hoppers were also good. In addition to the mutton curry, comes with sambol and potato. I wasn't the biggest fan of the mutton curry (quite a few pieces of fat), so I probably won't get this dish again. 

I will definitely return for the lamprais though. 

Accepts credit card
Lots of free parking"}
{"text":"I tried Sri Lankan food for the first time today.  I didn't get anything crazy...just hoppers.  I went with the hopper combo 2 which comes with a egg, milk and 2 plain hoppers.  The Hoppers aren't as exotic as a thought it would be...but their good.  What makes it stand out is the coconut sambol.  They give a generous amount of this side to eat with your hoppers.  It gives a nice spice and texture that is not overpowering.  The egg hopper was cooked to perfection and was able to coat the hopper in silky yolk as you break through.  The milk hopper was pleasantly sweet...almost desert-like...really good.  The plain hoppers were light pillows to enclose the awesome sambol.  $4.50 tax in...can't go wrong.  I think I will be more adventurous next time and get a a fish or mutton lampries.  I will definitely be back to explore."}
{"text":"I like Tamil food, but it wasn't fresh when I came in on a rainy Saturday night, though it still tasted good. It's definitely popular with local Tamils, but everyone seems to order it as take out."}
{"text":"I like their appetizers.  The food is good, but very spicy.  The staff is friendly."}
{"text":"As a first timer to Hopper Hut I was really pleased. Also as pleased were my fellow Yelpers. All new to Hopper Hut as well. As proud Yelpers, and purveyors of cuisine around the world, we informed our very helpful waiter that this was our first time having Sri Lanken food.  The service we were greeted with throughout our entire meal was great.

The menu has some poor English translation, but absolutely can be overlooked as the pictures of the food on said menu will make your mouth water. 

The take out area, sit down restaurant and bathrooms are all very clean. If you are going for the eat in option, be sure to check out the display of food in the take out area on your way in. You will want one of everything! 

Go with a group. Everyone get something different and share. Portions are huge! I got the beef roti (see attached). I think I have found my new favourite roti casing. The texture of the roti is thicker and fluffier than Mother India, nothing like Caribbean roti. This roti is far from dry. It is in a word, heavenly. The flavour of the beef was so robust. Fennel is a dominant spice, but marries well with the rest of the seasonings. The beef, although a bit dryer than I like, was very tasty and was accompanied very well by tons of onions and the curried sauce. 

The hopper is so good. It really is a crowd pleaser. The crepe-ish bowl is crispy at the top, and more doughy in the centre - something for everyone's preference. 

As Chris P mentioned, not all of the items on the menu were available when we went. Maybe because we were there for lunch? Not sure. 

This place can be hard to find. It is in the back of a plaza that sits on the north west corner of Ellesmere and Kennedy. If you are driving along Ellesmere and go past the Highland Farms grocery store, you have gone too far. 

I will absolutely be going back. Oh - did I mention it is uber cheap?! My huge roti, a can of pop and a hopper, came to a whopping total (including tax) of $7!! There was enough roti, after sharing, for me to have leftunders the next day."}
{"text":"Two things to get here: Mutton curry and hoppers! Hoppers are lightly battered crepes that you accompany your curry with. They have a few different types of hoppers, with my favorite being the coconut. The mutton curry is SPICY, but so tasty! You definitely need to order extra hoppers to stop your mouth from burning!!"}
{"text":"I haven't been here for a while, and almost forgot that the place is not visible from the street, and can be easily missed. 

There were a lot of media activities going on inside and in front of the restaurant when we were there because it was the day that Canada decided to allow the asylum seeker ship from Sri Lanka to dock in B.C. We watched our waiter tactically avoided camera man, dangling cords, and interview-seeking reporters while providing pretty good service to customers. Brilliant! 

Since Janelle W has provided excellent description of Hoppers, Lampries, etc., I will just pile on her comments: 

-- Milk hopper is great with gooey sweet coconut milk at the bottom/centre; the surface is firm enough to form a thin crust but the inside remains soft. Some people eat it as a dessert, but I have it with my meal, rip a piece off and use it to scoop up Kuttu Roti or whatever (amazing sweet and savoury combination). 
-- String Hoppers are rice noodles. It has a nice and unique texture compared to other versions of rice noodles from Chinese/Vietnamese/Thai/Singaporean cusines, soft and slightly springy but not chewy, probably because it's made by forming the rice flour dough first and then forced through a sieve-like equipment to make the noodle strings. Give it a try. 
-- Lots of great snack items to be picked up from the take-out counter for people on-the-go. I am partial to the stuffed Roti rolls (chicken or mutton, with potatoes, seasoned nicely and add half of a perfectly boiled egg)"}
{"text":"The quality of this food is poor.
It used to be great back in the day. It has lost its touch.
I ordered sambol (a coconut dish to compliment the larger dishes) and there were flecks of actual coconut shell...the curries taste of mostly cinnamon - wrong spice to have overpowering the curry.

I would not eat here, also for the lack of cleanliness. 

There are so many better places nowadays in the GTA to get good Sri Lankan food."}
{"text":"I grew up in Scarborough and have always had a lot of Sri Lankan friends.  I would say 95% of my friends are.  The weird thing is that I have never experienced Sri Lankan cuisine.  

At around 9:30PM, my hungry boyfriend calls and tells me he hasn't had dinner and tasks me with finding a place to satisfy his growling belly.  I think SO's with Yelp SO's are lucky!  Seeing as by the time he wrapped up with his buddies it was 10:30PM, I had to get creative as not many places stay open that late.  I gave him 3 choices, and he picked Hopper Hut.

Although most people have written about the lampries, we opted for the Kottu Chicken.  I am such an amateur when it comes to West Indian/Indian cuisine and felt intimidated as I stepped into the restaurant.  Its like when a foreigner goes to dim sum and the menu is all in Chinese, and all they can do is lift the steamers and point... That would've been me at Hopper Hut.  

Fortunately, the SO is a pro when it comes to West Indian/Indian cuisine and knew exactly what he wanted.  I had already had dinner, so I was really just there for company.

I did however snag a few bites, and it was absolute delicious!  We had ordered the mild, but it was still pretty spicy.  The portion sizes are extremely generous... It would probably count as 2 portions for me, but the SO is a big boy, so he gobble it all up.  

There is a seating area behind the food counter, though I'm not sure if the menu is different as we didn't explore.  

I will definitely come back and try some of their other offerings!"}
{"text":"A place to grab a bite when you have nowhere else to go. Lines can be long and service a bit slow but seems popular with the locals. There is little décor or distraction. One can dine in or take out; take-out seems to be the method of choice. Price point is the main selling point here. Food is quite average.

We decided to dine in on a Wednesday night after a long work/study session. Service was glacially slow but friendly. The menu was extensive with pictures as references (which is always appreciated, though we still has to google search a couple of items). Ordered a Mutton Lampries, hopper combo w/ an egg hopper, a milk hopper and 2 plain hoppers served with onion sambol, and a masala dosa. 

First off, for two, that's a lot of food-we barely made a dent in it and ended up pack 80% of it home. The lampries was interesting. Rice and various components are packed and steamed in a banana leaf - very similar to other Asian cuisine. I found that I did enjoy many of the components of the pack-like the salty dried anchovies, the sweetness of eggplant, pickled vegetable, and starchy potatoes. Everything was quite good, I didn't particularly enjoyed the mutton however, the taste was good but the meat was tough and quite dry.  

The hoppers were easily the star attraction, aka their namesake. Each had its own highlights. I especially loved the milk hopper eaten with sugar (as recommended by our young server). Wonderfully light and delicious. The egg and plain were eaten alongside the sambol and masala (from the dosa platter). The dosa was a bit disappointing. To compare it to other dosa places, the dosa was very lackluster. The dough was neither crispy nor thin. It had the consistency of a soft crepe and just didn't showcase any of the wonderful dosa charactistics. I was quite disappointed. 

Overall, this place had wonderful hoppers. The price is the main attraction. Close to average on all points. Be prepared to be patient, and don't go when you are hangry. We'll be coming back on those lazy nights when there's nothing to do or crave."}
{"text":"Sri Lanka formerly known as Ceylon lies off the Southern Coast of India. Unsurprisingly it has a number of different influences ranging from Indian to the various traders who have passed through. The food is similar in some ways to Indian food, as it tends to use cardmom, cumin, turmeric. However there are differences in the actual ingredients such as the fishes they use.

The funniest thing about the Country that I have always found, is that the first introduction to Sri Lanka that Indians have is through the story of Ramayan. In which a demon king from the country comes and steals the main protagonists wife, and they go to war. Beyond that the country has a pretty rich history, but I'm not going to go into the politics of it here.

I myself haven't seen a lot of this type of cuisine, usually the food tends to be pervasively South Indian rather than from Sri. Lanka. I like the food here well enough, the hoppers are pretty decent, though we got an odd fish smell from some of the rice. The food is usually spiced pretty well. 

The hoppers were the best I have had anywhere though. I don't know if they were cooked right because I don't have a lot of experience with them, but they tasted pretty good. 

The service I have found has been generally decent.

The restaurant itself is a kind of smallish place which generally seems to be clean."}
{"text":"Bought some banana balls today. They were raw in the middle. Returned to the place and received a refund. This is the second time this has happened this year. I really hate eating raw dough. It is unsanitary. I am thinking about filing a complaint with the Toronto Public Health. After years of visiting this place and having good service I just cannot continue going to an establishment that serves unsafe food. Leave the banana balls in the fryer for a minute more? Do not put your most junior person on the fryer for banana balls? Train your cooks better? I don't know the reason. Just do a better job and not poison your customers. Banana balls have been on the menu for over a decade, so there is absolutely no excuse.

The first time they gave be undercooked banana balls I phoned them to complain and then I let it slide. This second time is infuriating. They obviously did not learn from the first case."}
{"text":"Hopper Hut is way back in the corner of this plaza and if you're not a local resident that walks the area, it is definitely an unknown until great Yelpers put this place on the map.  As this place has been reviewed a few times already, I'll keep it short and sweet(SPICY in this case).

There is the traditional path of parking in front of the restaurant/take-out shop or the more local/sketchy narrow ghetto pathway from the back where you can get across to the Baskin Robbins on Kennedy road.  There's only enough space for one person at one time and you'll even notice a Hopper Hut take-out plastic bag on the ground letting you know you're on the right path.

Hopper Combo(#2) is a great option as an introduction to Hoppers.  Egg, Milk, Plain were all tasty.  The Sambol didn't really get my attention but it's served separately which means totally optional, therefore I enjoyed the Hoppers as is.  Fyi, Sambol did wake me up a bit with the spiciness.

Chicken Roti($6+) came unconstructed which seemed to be a popular culinary gimmick at some time prior.  The bowl of Chicken along with sauce was delicious and the Roti Wrap made for an excellent source to soak up the sauce. Maybe a bit on the small portion size, so order 2 next time.

Mutton Lampries($8.00) was a Banana Leaf bundle of Mutton, Rice, Veges, Beans, Curries and more that melted the flavours nicely together. It gave me an initial head sweat but as it calmed down I was able to finish most of it, maybe even a bit more.

The friendly Host(Man) really did a great job for us, but it's unfortunate that he was on his own out in the front which meant he had to man the front Take-Out counter most of the time and wasn't able to have proper vision to the dining area when we needed some additional service(Water).  Yes Yes, the Water was for me.  Thanks for the person going out to get more Water for me."}
{"text":"I love hopper hut. Everytime we come to visit family in Toronto, this is a must stop place. The food tastes home cooked!

Hoppers are always light and fresh, curries are always spicy as HELL. 

BEACH ROTI-- you must try this. And dip it into mutton curry= heaven. GREAT food. 

I had the mutton kothuroti and shimp curry on my last visit...good stuff as always.

Sri lankan people- this is our place! Great food and great service!"}
{"text":"What is the power of a good Yelp review? Write one well enough and you'll go to the ends of the Earth to try their restaurant of choice. Or in this case, to the ends of the Toronto subway system. My lady has a Yelp crush on a Detroit reviewer. It's been a rewarding crush, as it has led us to an introduction to El Salvadorian and now Sri Lankan Cuisine. More to the point, it's changed our definition of lampries from fish that clings onto sharks to kick-ass curry stew dish.

So what is a lamprey you ask? It's a package of meat, curry, yellow rice and an egg, wrapped to cook in a banana leaf. When you open it up, it's like opening the best present under the Christmas tree. And this is coming from someone who had a Weber grill under the Christmas tree this year. Inside, you find perfectly stewed meat (chicken just waiting to fall off the bone in this case). The curry adds just enough spice to make your mouth burn without the painful need to guzzle the nearest liquid, be it soda, water, milk or lighter fluid. 

The lady, however, would argue that the chicken kottu rotti was the winning dish. It was probably the least spicy thing we ate, but it had a good flavor to it especially when it was doused with lime juice.  We also tried the #1 Hopper combo (1 Egg Hopper, 3 Plain Hoppers) with sambol, which was more for those of a spicy inclination. The hopper was almost as if an Indian restaurant hired a French chef to cook naan, and ended up with something more akin to a crepe. It was light, airy and the perfect sidekick to the spicy sambol.

For about $15, we got enough food to feed an army. We can't wait to come back and take a another trek to Sri Lanka on our next Toronto trip."}
{"text":"9:30PM I am peckish & not about to eat some McFastfood.

I am pretty familiar with Indian & Sri Lankan foods & I usually judge places on how tasty & copious in amount their Kothu Rottis are.

I got some chicken kothu & not only was it delicious, but copious in amount as well. I ordered the mild, but it was still pretty spicy.  Again the portions could be shared between two people but I am glutton & one box does me in real good.

There is seating in the store. Overall I was very impressed with the Kothu Rotti & I will definitely come back to try other menu items!"}
{"text":"I really like hoppers (Appam) and this is my go to place in Toronto to satisfy my cravings and appetite. I got milk, egg hoppers when i was there and they served it with coconut sambal (Grated coconut with chilli and spice). Hoppers and sambal is a very traditional Sri Lankan dish that I have had the good fortune of enjoying very many times. However, the sambal served here did not really hit the note right. Something was missing - which was unfortunate.

For appetizer, we got fish pattis (A dish made with fish curry similar to empanadas) and it was hot and spicy. We asked for hot sauce and they gave us an almost empty maggi chilli sauce, which did not seem so professional. The combination was great so no complaints.

Finally to finish off the meal, we ordered tea and I felt that tea had way too much milk than tea. Again, another classic item did not hit the note. Even with all these small misses, i was still a happy camper! Prices are reasonable and food was served quick. (I'm always hungry when i order food so appreciate getting food quick) :) Great meal. Go to hopper hut to get some of the authentic Sri Lankan foods. One caution though, if you are not used to hot/spicy food, please make it a point to ask your server to make it mild."}
{"text":"The last few times I've been here I've gotten very sick and finding out they have had a few yellow card health violations is not surprising at all. 
I should note that I'm no stranger to this kind of food, I'm didn't just have a bad time because I'm not used to the spice.  There was absolutely something wrong with the food I had the last two times."}
{"text":"Had a couple of friends visiting from out of town, and we dropped by mid-afternoon to grab some food.  We sampled a little bit of everything, eating like kings to our hearts content and our total bill came to something like $12/person.  Amazingly cheap for food this good.  If you're in Scarborough, do yourself a favour and stop by."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located in the back of a big plaza and has 2 sections: the front is for short orders (snacks) that are on display in food trays. This includes fried things like vadas. They also have bags of dried snacks like channa (chickpeas). The back is sit down with menus. It was eerily quiet when I went but there were a lot of locals there which made me happy to see. There wasn't enough servers so service was slow but I expected this from the other reviews.

This might be the only place in Toronto to get hoppers (if I'm wrong please message me because I would love a place closer to downtown). Having not tried Sri Lankan food very much before, all I can say is WELCOME TO FLAVOUR COUNTRY! I got the hopper combo, string hopper combo and mutton rolls with both crab and mutton curry. I loved everything. The curries were spicy (like really really spicy so if you don't like a lot of heat this might not be for you) and delicious and complex. The hoppers were amazing and were the clear winner, don't waste your time on the string hopper. The hoppers are like little dosa bowls and you can eat them with your curry and the orange coloured coconut and the vial of yellow liquid that comes with it.  

I'll be back anytime I get a craving for hoppers!"}
{"text":"Dropped by at lunchtime to satisfy a craving for hoppers and idly. Ordered the Hopper combo of 2 plain, 1 (coconut) milk and 1 egg, served with a heaping bowl of coconut sambol. Although it was fresh and delicious, after a few bites, I ordered an extra veg curry to balance out the flavours and add some heat. Now I was in Heaven! Just wishing my dear daughter could finish work early and join me. :-)

The idly were not listed on the menu as side dishes, only as a main order. In hindsight, I should have ordered them, had a taste and brought them home. I ended up driving over to Babu Catering to buy some and I was underwhelmed by their lack of tartness.

Oh well, there's always tomorrow..."}
{"text":"First time trying Sri Lankan cuisine and was really impressed. Tried the hopper combo, chicken buriyani and chicken curry. There is no lack of flavour and you get so much food. I would've ordered less if I knew that hoppers are not good for leftovers - best to eat them fresh. Will definitely visit again"}
{"text":"Get the crab curry and milk  hoppers. Total perfection. Kotthu has also been a solid 4.5 stars when I've gotten it.  It's a Sri Lankan restaurant so depending on who's working there that day you may have to be assertive in terms of asking for service, but I feel like, when you're back home at a restaurant sometimes it takes two hours for the food to come out, so whatever. The falooda was bright green and from a mix the time I tried, but everything else has been on point. This place is a classic of Lankan food in Scarbs. I believe it when folks say there are newer, better places, but I end up coming here because I live in west end Toronto and it's the closest Scarbororugh spot to get to. Don't come here if you want mild food (ha!) or if you want to order a North Indian style dish."}
{"text":"Eaten here a few times and keep coming back - so that tells you something. 
I personally would prefer to grab the food and take it home but we don't live close by and some of the dishes (Hoppers) don't transport well.
The Mutton Roll is really good, so are the stuffed Rotis and Lampries. Not the biggest fan of the Kothu Roti which can be a little dry.
Overall a tasty joint which keeps calling you back."}
{"text":"Hopper Hut is a Sri Lankan Tamil institution in Scarborough. Whenever family visits from out of town, a group of us ends up there for authentic food like our grandmothers used to make. Hoppers [or appam in Tamil], are a thin pancake, made from a batter of fermented rice flour, cooked in a small wok-shaped pan [appachchatti, or seenachchatti, in Tamil].

The mutton rolls are quite good, as a starter. For main, it's a good idea to get the hopper combo, which features an egg hopper, a few plain hoppers, and a sweet hopper. They come with coconut sambal. I usually order the mutton curry to accompany, which is quite good.

The kottu roti is also very good there, as is the chicken curry. It's a good idea to go with a large group, so you can try a variety of curries."}
{"text":"They make the best Crab Curry in town similar to my mother's. This is why I go there. I heard about this place from people in Mississauga who drive all the way there just for their Crab Curry. They make spectacular Medu Vadas as well. Kayal who normally serves at the pick up counter is very kind and always greets you with a smile. They accept Mastercard, Visa and Amex. Great value for money."}
{"text":"First time to the Hopper Hut and to Sri Lankan food last night. Wonderful experience from the food to the friendly waiter who helped us order.  Other reviewers were right, the food is spicy and delicious. I wish I lived nearby!"}
{"text":"Last time we had Sri Lankan food was several years ago at Colombo and Unawatuna, Sri Lanka. So over the weekend, we decided to try it in Toronto. 

The place is pretty clean, the server was excellent and very polite (just like what you can expect from a good Sri Lanka restaurant). We had egg hopper, friend shrimp and stuffed roti with beef. The food was good. Especially the shrimp was tangy delicious. Though the menu said fried shrimp, but it was not crispy fried, it was stir-fried with a tangy spicy sauce... it was really good. The hopper was freshly made and everything was good.

We really need to go there several more time to try the rest of the dishes  :-p"}
{"text":"This is a pleasant enough little restaurant but I cannnot concur with the other review in liking the food.  I would preface this by saying perhaps it is a matter of taste and unfamiliarity with Sri Lankan dishes:

Of the things we ordered, a sort of Hakka style noodle dish was tasty, a dish of fried rice with chopped up rotis was spicy but just acceptable, a vegetartian thali was inedible, a dosa combo was okay but boring (we thought it would feature different kinds of dosai but they were all plain), and the beef lumprie was also inedible due to unpleasant texture and seasoning.

Again, perhaps we ordered the wrong things or do not have the acquired taste for this cuisine.  I do like North Indian and standard South Indian food, however."}
{"text":"I've only tried the snacks from the take out counter here, and they are all very good  - patties, rolls, vadas are all good quality, hot and fresh. Very nice! I have yet to try any of the meal items, but judging by the volume of take-out they are doing, it seems popular.

My only critique is that it can sometimes seem a bit disorganized. People cut in line, and its not always clear who is being served next. 

But, the people behind the counter are very friendly and are clearly doing their best. 

Nice place!"}
{"text":"I have never had a hopper or a lampries before visiting this place and even before I arrived, I was very intrigued.  Tucked away in a rear unit in a building across the parking lot of Highland farms, this little joint was everything I had expected it to be.  

We ordered some hoppers with onion sambal and a mutton lampries to share between the two of us.  I must say, the hoppers (egg & plain) were very tasty and I liked the mildly chewy texture and the sweetness.  I would have been a happy camper just eating the hoppers by themselves without the sambal.  

The mutton lampries, on the other hand, was like being smacked in the face.  In a good way, that is.  I am not the one to shy away from heat but this was seriously spicy.  My poor husband who does not fare too well with spicy food had tough time with the level of heat in this dish.  He downed almost a whole glass of mango lassi (which was excellent) by the end of our meal and was still sweating.  This dish was packed with a boiled egg, chutney, pickles, little salty fried anchovies, rice...etc and was so substantial that we had to bring the leftover home and have it for another meal.  

The lady who took our order was very helpful when informed that it was our first visit to the restaurant and helped us with the menu.  All in all, our foray into Sri Lankan cuisine was a good one and we would return to try their less spicy curries soon."}
{"text":"Had to see what all the hype was about. I had no idea what I was getting into though. Most people recommend  lampries so I thought I would give it a try. I didn't know what it was gonna look like but when it arrived it came wrapped in banana leaves. It was huge like the size of a big mac when they came in the box packaging (sorry, best size comparison I could come up with at the moment). After unwrapping the leaves it revealed the deadly contents inside. There are just so many different ingredients inside (1 boiled egg, shrimps, 2 different leafy veggies, little dried up fish, rice and some kind of hot sauce just to name the ingredients I recognized - there were other things in it which I can't even describe what it is) The first few bites were bearable but as I kept on eating it felt like nuclear bombs were going off inside my mouth. It was that hot. I was tearing up, my nose running non-stop and my face turned a bright red. Not a pleasant feeling but its all part of the experience. I came with my sister and she ordered a roti type dish which was stuffed with goat meat and hot sauce of course. My sister used a knife and fork to eat this and when she cut into the roti and reddish, orange liquid started leaking out. It was the freakin hot sauce!!! Nuclear level type hot sauce once again. She took a few bites and she couldn't continue any further. It was just too hot for her. So I had to finish it off myself as I hate wasting food. I was so disoriented by the hot sauce that I forgot to take a picture of the roti dish. Do I even dare to go back and order it again just to get a picture? 

Even though the dishes were very spicy hot, the taste of the food was spot on. So I just kept shoving the food down my throat. It just tasted too good. After a while I think my tongue got use to the hotness OR it was just numb and had no feeling. I myself couldn't finish the 2 meals and this is rare. But good thing the lampries came in a nice portable package of banana leaves so I continued the madness for dinner. A must try in my books as it is definitely a different dining experience and if you like things hot then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Location - a bit hidden-- its on the upper level of the corner complex. Park on the side facing Highland farms for easy access. In the front is the takeout counter and if you continue walking to the back there is the restaurant. 

Service - great, willing to answer any questions (which there were many) and attentive and checked up on us often to see if everything was ok. 

Food - Mutton roll - SO GOODD! Crisp crust, not super oily and filling is delicious and not spicy. 

Hopper combo 1 - hoppers alone dont come with coconut sambal, so get the combo. These were really good!! A cross between an idly and a dosa, I would actually prefer these to either, because it's the best of both worlds - crisp shell with a thick spongy interior. 

Chicken Lamprie - this was ok - I think next time I would try the veggie. While I love the diversity of the dish, I think the proportion of rice to topping was a bit off. It was good, but didn't blow me away. 

Overall, would definitely return just to continue trying the diversity of items they have on their menu :)"}
{"text":"Everyone seemed to take out but we decided to be the only ones to dine in. Waitress was attentive and polite, lamprey was extremely spicy but I was expecting it beforehand. First time trying hoppers and I really enjoyed them!"}
{"text":"This place is ... interesting. I had never tried Sri Lankan food before, but I figured since I like all the surrounding regional foods i couldn't go wrong. 

I started with the egg hopper. It was ok. The texture is nice and they give you this strange chunky spicy stuff to eat it with (I would have preferred something spicy with a sauce consistency - but it tasted good).  In any case, I wouldn't return just for these.

I forget the name of the main dish I had, but it was this massive rice & meat dish cooked and served in an enormous banana leaf. It was HUGE. Too much food for two people. And it seemed like it had everything but the kitchen sink in it: beef, chicken, rice, tamarind, vegetables, even some little sardine type of fish. Most of the meat was of the end trail variety with lots of bones in it. Didn't make for easy eating. It was mildly spicy. Probably not overwhelming for the average person who likes their food a little spicy. The dish did seem a little overcooked as it was a bit dry. But, a decent dish nonetheless.

I'm definitely glad I checked it out but I can't say I will be going out of my way to go back. Maybe If i'm with a really open-minded friend who wants to try something different. Oh yeah, this place is dirt cheap. that massive banana leaf thing was only $7."}
{"text":"Hoppers here are much better than Kottu, since they are a little \"stingy\" on the meat. So get the hoppers only!!:) they are well made, and I give them a 5/5. 

Overall, this place is a bit dated, but its Legit for good Sri Lankan food. 

They also have a nice selection of \"short eats\" as we natives call! haha! 

Definitely recommended if your new to Sri Lankan food, although if your in the Toronto area, there are places now even better than this ol'place! 

Nevertheless, be adventurous and try some Sri Lankan Food."}
{"text":"First venture into Sri Lankan food and I must say Hopper Hut definitely passed the test!!

Loved everything we ordered however the spicy coconut sambal and the 6 vegetarian curries steamed together in a banana leaf? was truly amazing and that dish alone would garner 5 stars!!!  Deeeelicious!!

Hoppers are great in lieu of utensils-haha (they do give you utensils, btw, but the hoppers were more fun)...All in all, it was a fun messy food fest, perfect balance of herbs n spices....what more could one ask for????"}
{"text":"The moment you enter the restaurant your olfactory senses will be woken up by a myriad of fragrant spices. The friendly staff guided us to the dining area which was separate from the glass protected ready made section of the restaurant. The decor is alright, there are big tables and small tables. The server helped us as we did not know what to order. It's a good thing he advised us to order one lamprey instead of two. We barely finished one haha in the end. We also ordered roti, which was soft to my liking. It came with some sort of spicy spread, tantalizing and a hint of curry leaves which was a plus.

Onto the main dish, a chicken lamprey (serves 2). Eating it was very fun, the whole thing was wrapped in some sort of leaf, maybe banana leaves. When you open it, the aroma of the dish will make you salivate. There's rice, lentils, eggplant (I love eggplant, this was really good and I ended up hogging it from my girlfriend), potatoes, 1 boiled egg, and a bunch of bone-in cut up chicken. I used my hand to rip a piece of roti and scoop up a morsel of the lamprey. Oh so good! Watch out, it is spicy! My mouth waters while writing this review. I would come back to this place.

Takes all payment options including debit/credit (AmEx, MC, Visa). Along Ellesmere, turn into the parking lot before highland farms. Hopper Hut is at the corner and the end of the lot."}
{"text":"Crazy volume for the money and good but quite hot food. Wooden faced servers could possibly crack a smile? Asking me if I needed a fork would seem a natural on a take out order? All in all I felt an intruder."}
{"text":"Hopper Hut was my first experience with Sri Lankan food and, while my experience was mixed, it was certainly worth the trip out to Scarborough to try this unique cuisine. Portions were large, prices low, and the food was interesting and mostly good. The restaurant has a takeout counter up front and a sit down restaurant, which was totally empty on a Tuesday evening, in back.

Our server was very friendly and helped explain the menu to us; most items were unfamiliar to us. We were eating vegetarian and there were plenty of meat-free options on the menu. Refer to janelle w's excellent review for an explanation of the main dishes on the menu. We had:

Hopper Combo #3 ($5.25): One egg hopper, one milk hopper, and two plain hoppers with coconut onion sambol. We really enjoyed all three types of hoppers. The milk hopper (coconut milk not cows milk) is sweet and meat to be eaten with white sugar. The other two hoppers are savoury and meant to be eaten with the sambol. I've never had sambol before but I found it a little dry for me, otherwise it's tasty.

Kottu Roti ($5): This was our favourite dish. It had great flavour and the lime wedge it was served with really added to it. This was the spiciest dish we had but I wasn't unbearably spicy.

Vegetable Lampries ($7): Six vegetarian curries and rice wrapped in a banana leaf and baked. This was the dish I was most excited about and it looked amazing when it came out. Unfortunately, while good, it turned out to be our least favourite of the three dishes we ordered. I really disliked a couple of the curries in the dish and, while the others were tasty, since they were all combined together I had to pick around the bad ones.

Overall the food didn't live up to the high expectations I had for Hopper Hut. It was good but I kept feeling like it could probably be done even better. Sri Lankan food has tons of potential and I felt Hopper Hut wasn't fully tapping that. Of course, I've never had Sri Lankan before so I could be totally wrong. I'll certainly try Sri Lankan again but next time I'll probably go to another place for comparison.

For now, I'll give Hopper Hut three stars for the friendly service, low prices, and above average food. I'll adjust the rating accordingly as a try more Sri Lankan places."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. 

Had the mutton lamprais. It was good but kinda stingy on the meat. Will come again though to try some other dishes."}
{"text":"Don't but anything from the display counter. Bought some snacks such as mutton roll's and fish buns. They were definitely old and most likely left over stuff from previous day. Only the made to order products are OK to buy. Learned my lesson today."}
{"text":"Nish N, your parents come up to Toronto from Rochester to eat at the Hopper Hut?  I find any excuse to come to Hopper Hut from Milwaukee!  My father is Sri Lankan, I so miss this food, there isn't any Sri Lankan restaurant, authentic or otherwise, anywhere in the American Midwest. Hopper Hut is the best and closest place for real Sri Lankan hoppers.  It's tasty, spicy, authentic, delicious, cheap, in the city's ugliest restaurant ever.  I'm actually drooling on the keyboard right now so I have to cut this review short.  Amma, mata badagini!"}
{"text":"My brother-inlaw introduced me to this Sri-Lankan place. Located not far from where they live in Scarborough called Ellesmere Village,  where you'll  find  West-indian groceries, and a huge Supermarket.

First we had the Lamprey...It's your choice of meat, Goat, Lamb, chicken or Fish Curry wrapped in Banana leaves with rice, boiled egg & salted fried anchovy .  DELICIOUS!!! can't get enough of it...I tasted it all and I must confess, I like all of it...

Ehen I came back to New York I found one in the Village...and what did I order?  Their Lamprey of course..An excellent  choice..."}
{"text":"Wow Hopper Hut.  Where do I begin?  The food here was awesome.  My sister and I visited Toronto recently and I had started a thread in the Toronto Talk page asking for suggestions on restaurants to try.  Kat F chimed in to say that she has a List Of Things For New Yorkers To Do In Toronto list.  Hahhah!  It's Yelp sarcasm.  Very funny.

But wait.  She wasn't kidding.  She really does have such a list.  And it's got 28 items on it.  At the time of this review, Kat F has 101 lists.  She is out of control with those lists.  If it is possible to have lists of lists, she'd probably have a few of those, too.

And so it was, from this list I picked out Hopper Hut.  I have never had Sri Lankan food before, and neither has my aunt, two cousins, and my sister.  Altogether there were five of us ready to try Sri Lankan food for the first time.  We had no idea what to expect.  A few of us thought it would be like Indian food.  But there are different regional varieties of Indian food, I maintained.  And I wondered, to what kind of Indian food exactly would it be similar?  We arrived at the restaurant on a Tuesday night and it wasn't busy at all.  The space inside Hopper Hut is not big and there were two or three other tables of people eating.  

We sat down and told the waiter than none of us had ever had Sri Lankan food before.  Very friendly, and patient in explaining some of the dishes to us, he was able to immediately give us suggestions on what to try.  Egg Hoppers, Mutton Lampries, Kothu Rotti with chicken, and Masala Dosai.  Hoppers are a Sri Lankan specialty and they were also the namesake of the restaurant itself.  So what is a hopper?  It is difficult to describe, but I'll try: a bowl-shaped thin-pancake made with rice flour.  I think it's cooked by frying.  Confused?  Ok go look at a picture.  The Egg Hopper is a hopper that is cooked with an egg fried in the middle, and it is quite a tasty delight.  The Masala Dosai had what looked like a very long rolled-up crepe along with sauces to dip, and the Kathu Rotti with chicken was a flavourful and spicy dry curry dish.  It was the Mutton Lampries that stole my heart though.  This lamb and rice dish with a boiled egg wrapped in banana leaves was delicious, meaty, and spicy.  My mouth is watering right now thinking about it while writing this review. 

I now have a mission - to find good Sri Lankan restaurants in New York City.   Unrelated note: it seems from the food we had that Sri Lankans love eggs.  I think there was at least one egg in almost every dish we had.  I think that's pretty great.  I love eggs, too.

{"text":"These peoples mutton rolls are to die for. No other store in the entire GTA makes their rolls as huge and delicious as Hopper huts."}
{"text":"In a word, delicious.  That sums up Hopper Hut.  The food is fully authentic and the portions are massive.  None of the five of us Yelpers that went for lunch could finish what they had ordered.  The waiter was extremely helpful with navigating us through the menu as none of us had eaten Sri Lankan before.  Also, he spoke perfect English, bonus!

Make sure you try a hopper.  It's similar to a pancake or crepe but in a bowl shape.  I had the Chicken Kuffti Roti which is like a normal roti except they chop up the bread into the dish.  My suggestion is that you order what you want, but the whole table shares what they ordered because any way to look at it you'll be taking home a doggie bag. 

My only hit on this place was that they were out of a few things and the waiter had to go to the kitchen a couple of times while we were ordering to see if they had what we wanted.  The once dessert we all wanted to try, the pineapple pluff, was not available that day."}
{"text":"After eating at Hopper Hut, I now daydream about eating Sri Lankan food. 

I just love Hopper Hut!

Lampries! I love the Lampries! Not only that it is sizable, cheap can feed 4 of me, the spices in there are so complex... with all those different spicies in it and serving steaming hot.. oh what a treat! Even I am not into Mutton (I don't eat lamb, goat!!)  but the Mutton Lampries is A+ OK for me!

All the items are delicious. And it is a good restaurant for sharing with your friends or fellow yelpers

The owner of the restaurant that served us are really nice and friendly and with a nice smile!

I definitely will be back! LAMPRIES!!"}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in Toronto I swing by this place to get a plate of Mutton Biryani. Decent portion size and the price is great. The biriyani is delicious. I would avoid the chicken biriyani because it had a ton of bones and very little meat.  Do try their Hoppers. It's delicious. 

Great place to swing by and try different Sri Lankan dishes."}
{"text":"My parents have been known to drive from Rochester to Toronto for a fix of the Hopper Hut. This joint does Sri Lankan food justice: vadais, seeni sambal, curries, of course hoppers, it's all here. 

Warning: when they say spicy, they mean it. Fiery times for your mouth and belly will ensue."}
{"text":"Third time's a charm - after two failed attempts at gracing this Sri Lankan mecca with our presence (they were undergoing renovations earlier this year), I finally made it here!

It's closer than you think: only a 20 minute** ride by subway and LRT from the Danforth stretch of the Bloor/Danforth line at Ellesmere station. Seriously, it's right at the TTC's doorstep and no reason for you not to come here, unless you hate guzzling cheap and satisfying food. 

I ordered an Egg Hopper ($5), which is a sort of crepe made from fermented rice flour and fashioned into a 'bowl shape', with a fried egg dropped inside. I highly recommend it with the egg, but you can get plain ones too.

Next was the Vegetarian Lamprai ($7), which was an incredible value considering the sheer volume of food. Basmati rice circled by six types of vegetarian curry (pending availability), wrapped in a banana leaf and then baked and served in butcher paper (see photo). There was beet curry, green beans, lentils as well as okra and tomatoes. All nicely spiced and full of different flavours, but not too hot. I sampled some of Danielle's fish lamprai as well and when I come back, this is what I'll order. It had many types of fish (some deboned, some not) that were infused with curry flavour and extremely tender. Were it not considered rude I would have continued eating from her plate till everything was gone. 

I feasted like a beast for just $12.

My only regret is that I didn't take a closer look at all the prepped snacks and appetizers in the takeout area out front. There were dozens upon dozens of fried crepes, mutton roti, samosas, rice balls and other bite-sized things that all needed explanation. I wanted to eat everything in sight.

**TTC permitting, of course."}
