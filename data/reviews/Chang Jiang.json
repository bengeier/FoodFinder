{"text":"No good! I had sesame chicken and mongolian beef, they were the worst chinese food that i've ever had in madison."}
{"text":"I've been here many times and with the many Chinese restaurants I go to, this has been my favorite! So far I have gotten the General Tso's Tofu, Beef in Garlic Sauce, and Mongolian Pork. With the $5 lunch special (entree, roast pork fried rice, soup/egg roll/soda) this is the place to go for lunch! The tofu was a weekly special and it was 7.50 for a HUGE portion of tofu with broccoli and rice! The workers here are very nice and the cooks really know how to make food well. My family and I love coming here because we know everything is fresh plus there is always a good helping of vegetables with every meal ordered. I will definitely be coming back here for more delicious hot and fresh Chinese food!"}
{"text":"Don't do it..our food tasted old and bad chicken. Will never go back... I should've follow my mind when I walked in and the store had a really bad smell..."}
{"text":"4 star for food.  One for service.  I have been there three times.  Each time I was not greeted, no eye contact during the entire transaction. I find this very rude.  Employees should be taught to be friendly to customers.  They do not even say 'may I help you?\"  They wait for customer to ask for service."}
{"text":"Great value and taste. Daily specials are amazing and practically feed the whole family. Do yourself a favor and get an extra order of eggrolls. They're my favorite in Madison."}
{"text":"I would have liked to have tasted the food. It never came. We called at 5:15 on a Sunday and placed a delivery order. We were told it would take 45-55 minutes. At 6:45, we called back to see when the delivery might occur. They assured us that it was on it's way. At 7:15, we called to cancel the order."}
{"text":"Average americanised Chinese.   My girlfriend and I have ordered take out numerous times.   This last time we both ordered the sesame chicken dinner special with an egg roll.   After about 8 hrs we both became violently ill.   I have had diagnosed food poisoning before and this was it.   My guess would be the egg rolls.   Again this was an isolated incident, but we will not be eating here again."}
{"text":"It's a really great place! I would probably say it has the best Chinese food in sun prairie. I can here to visit and was craving Chinese so I came and ordered some food. It was pretty busy but they got the order out in around 5-8 ish minutes. The staff is really great! They helped me decide what to order and were really catering towards my needs. I would recommend the General Tsos chicken, it's really crispy and coated with a mild spicy sauce.  I also really liked the crab rangoons! They're so creamy and tasty. I would definitely come here again when I come to Sun Prairie!"}
{"text":"As far as Americanized Chinese goes (neon sauces and gigantic portions of food and MSG), I think this place is excellent. Obviously it's not grade A in appearances or uniqueness but the flavor and quantity is there for a great price. Really, really fast service, and it is crave able. Definitely a solid \"on my way home and don't want to cook\" option."}
{"text":"Good, hot, plentiful Chinese food for the money. If you get delivery it's super fast. Better than other 'fast' Chinese places."}
{"text":"Great dinner specials (choice of three different dinners for $6 when I went). You get a lot for your value. Food wasn't too bad either. Worth checking out if you live nearby."}
{"text":"Family enjoyed the food quite a bit especially the sweet and sour chicken."}
{"text":"I haven't had better Crab Rangoon than they serve here.  The people who work there are pretty nice, too."}
{"text":"Okay, so this is my first time writing a review! I just got my food delivered and was pretty disappointed. My favorite Chinese restaurant recently closed (huge bummer because it was actually authentic and family ran) so I decided to venture out and try a new place. I've read some mixed reviews about this restaurant but its the only Chinese restaurant in the area. Delivery took almost an hour which wouldn't have bothered me if the food was worth the wait. Very very bland food. I ordered steamed dumplings and broccoli beef. Beef was really chewy and fairly tasteless. Dumplings were not that bad but still not great. I would not reccomend this restaurant, especially if you love authentic Chinese food."}
{"text":"My relentless quest for respectable Midwest Chinese food continues to Chang Jiang of Sun Prairie. Let me first say that I have searched many locations nearby, including the House of Mei, and that I have pretty high (but reasonable) standards when it comes to Asian food: Delicious food, fresh ingredients, adequate portion sizes, and (for a huge bonus) something that makes them stand out from the others. I should also note that the dish I judge all of them by is Vegetable Lo Mein (plain, I know, but it levels the playing field). So, I ordered take-out of the Lo Mein, lunch special (General Tso's Chicken) and hot and sour soup.

FOOD TASTE/QUALITY: The overall taste was okay; pretty good. Not bad, but nothing really stood out to me as tremendous. Some of the dishes were better than others. The General Tso's Chicken was a mix of predominantly dark meat, and the sauce was pretty standard. Some pieces were stuck together, making a clump of meat (not my favorite). The fried rice that came with the chicken was very good. Lo Mein was not bad. The egg noodles were cooked nicely (not overly cooked; firm), but it was a bid too runny for me (i.e, liquid at the bottom of the box). Soup was also pretty good. The vegetables seemed to me a mix of fresh and canned. Again, not my absolute favorite food taste/quality, but not at all bad for Sun Prairie.

PRESENTATION: Styrofoam boxes and plastic containers for the take-out (small box for the rice and Lo Mein). But, it was packaged well and tightly put together in a brown paper bag. Everything made it home nicely. 

PORTION: This is where Chang Jiang shined. The lunch special was so much food, that I could not finish it in one sitting. It was allot of chicken -- perhaps 1 to 1.5 pounds. The Lo Mein comes in two sizes (small and large); the box was packed tightly and came with a nice amount. Overall, I was very impressed with the portions. You will not go away hungry!

PRICES: In short, very reasonable. All of their menu and prices are posted at changjiangsunprairie.com , so there are no surprises. As an example, the small Lo Mein was $3.55 (large would have been $6.25). General Tso's Combo plate was $7.55. Soup was $2.15. Considering the monstrous portions, the prices are a HUGE draw. They often have coupons online for an even sweeter deal.

DELIVERY/TAKE-OUT EXPERIENCE: This is a classic take-out place. Pretty small without any real places to dine-in; think small take-out window in a strip mall. I ordered online (before they opened for lunch), and they were Johnny-on-the-spot, having everything ready at the exact time I said I would be there. The person I paid was very nice, even honoring a coupon that I forgot at home. They seemed genuinely happy to have my business. That was impressive. Living in the Midwest, though, I would LOVE for them to take up delivery! But with online ordering and easy pick up, it was pretty good.

FINAL NOTES/IMPRESSIONS (3.5 to 4 stars): As I said, I am admittedly hard on Chinese food take-out/delivery, and want food that blows me away with quality and taste. Was Chang Jiang doing all of that? No, not completely. But, the food was good, the portions were fantastic, and the prices were awesome. In the Midwest, that's not too bad! For me, I will return and would not have a problem recommending it to others."}
{"text":"Our go to Chinese food. They deliver so fast and delivery only costs $1! Chicken fried rice is awesome and the crab rangoons are the best I've had. I've never had anything bad from this place. Try it!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Its super easy to get to. The food is great. Basically you can get all your staple takeout foods at a decent price with pretty large portions. I love their noodles and the terryaki sticks..... mmmmm. I would recommend if you need a quick chinese food fix at a great price! Note: this is not a sit down place. Simply takeout. You can sit at their very few seating areas, but they focus on takeout, which is speedy service I might add!"}
{"text":"I feel compelled to weigh in on this one.
I have ordered from here about four times. It has been very inconsistent. Out of all the things I've had the General Tso's chicken has been consistently good. Granted I have not inspected the chicken closely as it would ruin the experience. It's got the crunchy/chewy texture I think the outside of General Tso's should be like without being mushy and it tastes pretty good, it also reheats well in the microwave. To be fair, I don't judge Chinese takeout on much more than that."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised.
One of the only places in town that offer cold sesame noodles.
Their 'House Special' soup was impressive; similar to a 'sizzling rice soup' without the rice.
High quality take out containers; easy to wash and re-use.
Asked for crispy vegetables in two dishes; both were perfect.
Only downside: Hot and Sour soup was bland.
Definitely order again."}
{"text":"I normally get the general tso's chicken and fried rice.  They normally cook it within 10 minutes. I think it tastes pretty good and reasonably priced. They may only have 1 table with 4 chairs, but I only consider it a take out restaurant. It is not gourmet, but it is good for what it is."}
{"text":"I'm not from this area, but while I was in Madison I decided that I had to have some Chinese food. OMG! The food is awesome from Chang Jiang! The beef fried rice is delicious and the doughnuts are heavenly! Delivery was super fast and the food arrived blazing hot. I will definitely be ordering from this place again if I'm ever in the area."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place!

My husband and I order take out from here around once a month just to enjoy a Friday night in and it is always a-m-a-z-i-n-g! The food is hot and is extremely flavorful. We've never had any issues with what we've ordered. We've lived in quite a few places and this is by far some of the best Chinese food we've  had. 

I'm always weary of ordering take out online (Like what if they forgot your order? Or they made it too early?), but I only order online from here because they do such a good job. Generally I order around lunch time for dinner and just pick it up on my way home -  zero problems.

if you live in SP, you need to go!"}
{"text":"I ordered \"Roasted Pork Eggrolls\" it was super greasy and was a ton of cabbage with bacon bits. This place is awful."}
{"text":"Served it's purpose as far as trying to satisfy my Americanized Chinese cravings!

Hot and sour soup doesn't contain any wood ear mushrooms or Chinese pickles, but had equal parts soup and tofu plus veggies. Consistency was thin. Wonton strips accompanied the soup.

The fried pork dumplings had generous filing and no traces of mystery meat. The wrappers were thick and it came with a garlicky, sweet, soy sauce based dipping sauce.

Yay! Cheat day lunch!!"}
{"text":"With decent food and average prices, it's probably the best Chinese takeout place in the area. Pros? The menu is large so there's something for everyone and the food is ready in 10 minutes, you can't beat that. Cons? Customer service has never been so great and I don't always get the right change so I just figure it in as part of the tip. We'd probably order more often if they offered delivery but it hasn't stopped us from getting it whenever we're looking for Chinese! When you're craving a quick bite, order for pickup and it'll be ready when you get there."}
{"text":"They have really gone downhill in the past couple years. I used to order from here all the time and the order was always great, being the only place in Madison where the General Tso's chicken actually had real chicken, but no more.

Service:

When I arrive the woman running the place initially gives me the wrong order. Then she says it'll be $8 something, when I paid online to which she says sorry. Then I wait for an additional 10 min, on already 30 minutes when it should've been done in 25. After that point she finally gives me my order, only to get home to find there is no rice and just chicken (foolish me I suppose, should've checked)

This order was like Murphy's law, everything that could go wrong did go wrong. I will never order from here again, hopefully the location on Raymond Road is still good...

Food Rating: Two Stars (way greasier than usual)
Service Rating: One Star; get the basics right, I mean it's not that hard cause they were visibly not that busy."}
{"text":"Good food/good prices. I ordered my food online and it was ready when I arrived. Quick and simple online ordering."}
{"text":"I ordered Fried Rice, Crab Rangoon and Crispy Seaseme Chicken.  I enjoyed all of the food.  I really liked that the chicken was crispy.  I don't like when chicken gets soggy from sauce and loses the skin.  I got a free pint of pork fried rice because my order was over $15.  I definitely have enough food to feed me for a week and the price was great.  The major downside was it took over an hour to get delivered.  Have to remember to order early so I'm not eating at 730 at night!"}
{"text":"This place is ' ok' it's not the worst or the greatest but I still return for more. It's really hard to rate this location so that's the only reason I am giving them a 3. I've came here before and my food was absolutely fantastic! Then sometimes I come here and its either bland or too greasy. If I'd had to choose between this location or Raymond Rd, I'd choose the Raymond road location hands down..plus their service is way better. The Gammon location should take some notes on their customer service."}
{"text":"Can't say I was overly impressed.  The food is OK, the servings are large and prices are cheap but the food is bland. Boring."}
{"text":"Meh. It's okay when you want something quick. Not overly impressed. Fried rice is good."}
{"text":"Exactly what I was looking for in cheap Chinese takeout.  I ordered sesame chicken and 2 egg rolls.  The order took about 10 minutes and cost around $13.  The people behind the counter were very polite and pleasant- good customer service.

Not a 5-star restaurant and not 5-star quality food, but Chang Jiang works very well for what it is.  The chicken was tasty and tender, the white rice was nice and sticky, and the egg roll was not greasy.

My fortune was: \"You have a deep appreciation of the arts and music.\"  True!

I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I hadn't eaten from Chang Jiang in yeeeears until recently during a visit home to my parents' and my mom wanted take out for dinner. Fast, fresh, and tasty, this took me back! Chang Jiang has been in Sun Prairie for eons, and they hold up. Solidly good Chinese take out at a good price. I like it!"}
{"text":"Your standard Chinese takeout option.  The same menus as every Chinese takeout place you've been in your life.  Nothing special. Average. Decent portions. I guess I've got nothing else to say."}
{"text":"Worst Chinese food I have ever had! Tastes like soap and my wontons where fried burnt and dry. Never again Chang!!! This time I mean it"}
{"text":"I've been to 3 Chang Jiang Chinese take outs over the last 16 years in Madison. The first was on the far eastside along a road I can't recall the name of and I enjoyed it well enough to be a repeat customer during the first year I lived in that home. Years later after moving to Middleton 6 years ago I began frequenting the location near Woodman's West and I have been extremely pleased with their service and food. 
Tonight I discovered and tried the Fitchburg location. Ordering the house Special Fried Rice, Wonton Soup, Teriyaki Beef and an order of General Tso's Chicken. 
When I finally arrived home totally stoked to dig in after smelling it in my car for 30 min's on my drive, I was shocked when I opened the bag to retrieve the Teriyaki Beef and instead find what looks like four slices of thick steaming Beef Jerky. Not a container with (white) or perhaps fried rice, and lots of sliced up meat seared in a glaze of teriyaki sauce and maybe some broccoli to round off the meal with some bright green. Every time in my entire life, when I request the simplest of Asian dishes, asking for a simple Teriyaki Beef means the simple rice and meat thing. Seattle was jam packed with takeout places that sold essentially this meal, being varied usually with chicken or even tofu for the faint of heart who are overly concerned for the well being of our furry or feathered friends from the farms. 
The second thing I opened to quite a dismaying scowl was the yellow/orange fried rice! Yes, YELLOW ORANGE! Like the crap that gets called Spanish rice at Mexican restaurants such as Laredo's (this just happens to be essentially right next door to this particular Chang Jiang)
Yellow fried rice is not what fried rice is supposed to look like. It's supposed to be prepared with SOY SAUCE! Not Tamarind or yellow number 2 Easter egg dye. Not only was it terrible to look at but it tasted like, well, rice from the crappy new I Love Tacos I will be reviewing probably tomorrow when I get around to it following tonight's disappointing dinner.
Terrible meal number 3 was the General Tso's Chicken. I've had this dish at dozens of places in Madison alone, and each and every one was somehow much better than the Chang Jiang location in Fitchburg! The red sauce tasted like overly sweetened Sweet n sour sauce with Ketchup blended in to tone down the theatrical blood tint of the jellied sauce! It was horribly oversweet and had zero hint of any recognizable spice, though I asked specifically for the cook to please bump up the heat to be about a 4 star heat rating. The rice that was in this dish too was the Easter egg surprise mentioned previously.
Finally, the Wonton Soup. This is ALWAYS a hit and miss item at every Chinese place; it seems that every different chef seems to have a phobia from adding too much salt. But fortunately this is easily amended to suit my tastes. Often however the chicken stock itself is bland which need a tad more assistance to bring out the flavor. But tonight's was simply yellow tinted vegetable broth with wontons that contained even more blandness.

So in short, I could've summed up the entire experience with a simple 1 star rating, but I gave it two because the service was at least very friendly.

If there is any confusion, I will reiterate that this place isn't any good, and I am strongly suspicious that the chef was pulling double duty as the Mexican Can opener next door for Laredo's which I previously ate a quick one-off meal their a year ago and am reminded that it wasn't much good itself, but at least the piss tinted rice was where it belonged!"}
{"text":"This is a take out site only. The food is fresh and prepared quickly. The staff are very friendly and overall this is a extremely easy way to order take out food. 
I was very pleased with the ease of ordering and the care my order was given."}
{"text":"This Chang Jiang location was my go-to place for Chinese takeout when I used to work in Verona.

As with all the Chang Jiang chains in the area, the food can be quite greasy, but the portions are huge, the prices are decent, and the food doesn't taste bad at all. Your orders are completed quickly and sometimes one order can last 2-3 meals."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a great Chinese take out for awhile and thought I would give this place a chance. I ended up being pretty disappointed. Their dumpling dough was very thick and the cashew chicken had a lot of large pieces of celery. I won't be going back to this location."}
{"text":"As for take-out Americanized Chinese food goes, Chang Jiang is pretty good. The food alone gives them 3 stars. What gives them that extra star is the service. I have a severe fish and shellfish allergy. Every time I order from Chang Jiang, and let them know, they take care of my food. They make sure that it does not have any cross contamination or oyster or fish sauce in any of my food, even if it normally does. They make it safe to eat take out chinese."}
{"text":"Chang Jiang is good, solid Americanized Chinese food. It's not the best Chinese take out I've had, but it works."}
{"text":"Really good, fresh take out. The vegetarian food is consistently well made and flavorful. It tastes fresher than the other local options, where the veg dishes tend to be soggy and bland. I've been ordering here for years and have yet to be disappointed."}
{"text":"A friend offered to buy Chinese for lunch. So I figured why not try this place out. I have to say the Shrimp Egg roll was good, however the Sesame Chicken was way to breaded in my opinion. Maybe I just expect to much from Chinese food? The inside of this place is full of tacky crap that you can buy from them. Not much of a seating area either. Maybe I just came on a bad day? 

Either way I probably won't eat this again, not even on par with the mediocre Happy Wok."}
{"text":"Solid option.  I live on the east side and delivery is limited.  Chang Jiang is not the greatest place out there, but it is decent.  

They have online ordering or over the phone.  They deliver in blizzards and on Sundays.  They also regularly send out coupons.

They have a huge menu!  Their appetizers are lacking, there are only about 8 options which include the usual crab rangoon, egg rolls and soup.  

I generally order their orange chicken or their General Tsao's chicken.  All of their meals come with fried rice (unless otherwise noted) or you can substitute.  I love my food VERY spicy and they always amp it up when I request that.  They make it exactly how I like it.  

Overall flavors are decent.  They sauce can sometimes be overpowering to the point where you can not tell the different between veggies and meat in your container.  The portions are inconsistent.  They had switched containers for awhile and portions got smaller.  Then all of a sudden we are back to big containers!  It is not a big deal, I still got a ton of food.  

Basically this is a typical/standard Chinese food place."}
{"text":"It's been years since I've had food from here.  Mostly because the few times I did, it was not great.  I was hungry for Chinese food and this place was on the way home so I decided to give it a try again.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The crab rangoon had plenty of filling and was delicious.  The garlic chicken with vegetables was also very good.  It was the perfect amount of spice and had great flavor.  I would order from here again."}
{"text":"Probably the best cashew chicken anywhere in the Madison area.  Nice folks who were working there."}
{"text":"A few of us ordered a delivery to work. When i opened my steamy lunch combo, it was super greasy with a  hair to boot. ( which i discovered only after my first two nibbles) nice. i have never ordered from them since. yikes."}
{"text":"I like this restaurant mostly because they really aim to please.  I called wanting vegetarian soup, which isn't available at most Chinese restaurants or as a matter of fact at Chang Jiang, but they offered to make it for me.  It was really tasty and the vegetables weren't overcooked at all.  I've tried various dishes there and ordered my own creations, but the eggplant has been my favorite so far with broccoli with garlic sauce a close second.  

It's really cheap, and there is free hot tea to have while waiting for to go orders.  I'm lucky that I live so close to it."}
{"text":"This place is the best Chang Jiang I go.    The food is excellent.   My favorite is sweet and sour chicken"}
{"text":"This place has your standard chinese food; their stuff is nothing special. I have ordered it twice, and after the second time, I will probably not get it again. The egg rolls and rangoons were way too greasy. While I understand that chinese food is typically a little on the greasy side, you shouldn't be able to sop grease from an eggroll with a paper towel. Their food is okay but they need to step up their game."}
{"text":"This was the Chinese restaurant that convinced me to start being more fussy about where I buy my Chinese food.  Though they have had some good food at times they used to have some gawd awful cobwebs hanging off their decorations at the front desk.  I don't know how they missed this but if they miss this they also miss other details.  Never went back .  I hope they cleaned their decorations.  If you go there check it out.  If not, well there you go, I rest my case."}
{"text":"We have purchased food from other Chang Jiang locations and you would think they would put out similar food.   But that is not the case.  A person I was with wanted to drive a good distance to another location because they said their food was very good.   I said, \"why not just stop here since it is close to where we are?  They should be just as good.\"  They said I would be sorry and they were right.  
One meal was ok and the other was not ok.  I actually threw some of it away.  I should have made the trip elsewhere."}
{"text":"I tried the Cottage Grove location as it was closest to where we live when we first moved to Madison.  Just tried Sun Prairie after a period of a couple years.  Had avoided regularly based on first experience.  Same.  Consistently mediocre, bordering on bad Chinese food.  Both Cottage Grove and Sun Prairie consistent over span of years.  Don't bother."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is so hit or miss. I'm honestly just not sure what I'll be getting for delivery each time I order (the same thing). They must have a different person cooking the stuff every single time because nothing ever comes to me the same as the last. 

I have had some great General Tso's here, and I have had some horrible way too spicy un eatable Tso's here. It's just so confusing.

I enjoy the lunch special the best. Most lunch specials are around $4.99 and come with fried rice (or white/just ask) and a egg roll. Great! It's enough food for a second meal for most. Who can beat that? Pretty much anything and everything is offered under this lunch special as well. What a deal!

Great egg rolls, Very good Rangoon! Awesome soups! 
Yet...like I said, you can't expect the same dish every time. It's a surprise to what quality of food will end up in front of you. 

Pretty quick delivery (usually around 25-30 minutes). 
Good sesame chicken, orange chicken, beef and broccoli."}
{"text":"The general tso's and boneless spare ribs are about as good as you'll find. No lie!"}
{"text":"Foods always well prepared and tasty. New online order system is a breeze. Not a place to sit down and eat but the beat for carryout."}
{"text":"We used to go here for our Americanized Chinese food every so often for the last 7 years.  However, in the last year the quality of their food has taken a nose dive to unacceptable levels of blech and blah."}
{"text":"One word.....Meh.  This is a place to go if you really don't care how good the food is and you are dying for msg.  I would call it cheap Chinese, but the word cheap is not entirely accurate. The food is moderately priced, and what we ordered lacked flavor and was rather plain.  The plus side is they are fast and have a big selection of typical American Chinese favorites."}
{"text":"Yep- It's close by my home when I am too lazy to cook.  Yep-I never have to wait long after placing my order.  Yep-I like to feel guilty after eating a metric ton on General Tso's chicken (extra spicy).

This place \"is what it is\".  The food won't blow you away but it definitely will help satiate your Chinese take-out addiction for at least a month or two.

One piece of advice.  They usually put in a free mega container of some sort of wonton soup.  To this day, I have no idea what the wontons are stuffed with.  Caveat Edax"}
{"text":"Babe picks up the phone and she orders, the food shows up hot and fresh. I always get the steamed dumplings; love that dumpling sauce. Never had a problem, never got bad food, never got a wrong order. Solid Chinese Take-out. And I'm about 70% sure this is the location we order from...as I said I don't order the food but I always eat it. ;)"}
{"text":"The portions are huge and food taste great! I loved their hot and sour soup. And the pork egg rolls are awesome."}
{"text":"My go-to Chinese take-out. To be fair, options are limited in Verona... with that being said, I have ordered from Chang Jiang COUNTLESS times.. with my family when I was still living at home 15 years ago, all the way to now as an adult Verona resident. Have never once been disappointed. That's a pretty good track record."}
{"text":"I've been here many times, as it is convenient for me. I am a Chinese food fan and I can definitely say, this is one of my favorite's.
I really like their $5 lunch special and their portions are huge. I always have days worth of leftovers.
Their staff is really friendly and always have a smile on their face.
I really like coming here because I know their products are fresh and their cooking is great.
I like that you can always find parking outside and the little seating area allows for you to wait on your order."}
{"text":"Love this place for great delivery. They will customize your food order to your taste. Alway asked them for Order Read Back so you know your Both on the Same Page."}
{"text":"Officially my favorite Chinese takeout/delivery restaurant in Madison. Everything from the bone-in spareribs to the chef specials are prepared with the up most quality. I order online at least once a week. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"I realize this is carryout Chinese and my rating reflects this understanding.  Went in today for lunch while I waited in line for Charter Communication next door.  I ordered the Kung Bo Chicken with Fried Rice (the special of the day) and a Pork Egg roll.

Overall, there was nothing offensive about it, there simply wasn't any flavor to the Kung Bo Chicken with Fried Rice.  For something that is so unhealthy for you (ala Carry Out Chinese), I expect it to at least be flavorful.  Unfortunately, it was just incredibly bland and boring.  I did my best to kick it up a notch with hot chili sauce, I even added some soy, which I never do.  In the end, it just wasn't great.  

The egg roll was fine, nothing really to write home about and nothing to really complain about either.

Not taking into account flavor, value was actually high.  It was the lunch special and was $4.35 for the chicken with fried rice and $1.20 for an egg roll.  Total price was like $5.60 or so.  Quantity was very good as well.  I actually only ate half of the meal, which was probably a combination of quantity and lack of excitement on my part.

I'll skip Chang Jiang next time around, there are much better carryout Chinese locations out there."}
{"text":"I really, really, really don't think this place is going for a 5-star review, and that's perfectly OK with me. In my opinion, this place fills its niche perfectly: it's quick, it's cheap, portion sizes will fill you up, and it has all the basic dishes you'd expect at a Chinese takeout place.

No, it doesn't have authentic Asian cuisine. No, it doesn't have all the specialty dishes I'd want. No, it hasn't blown me away with its flavors or service.

But it has always been accurate, speedy, and exactly what I expect. Don't come here for Chinese food. Do order from here for Chinese takeout food."}
{"text":"Questionable Beef

Ordered two things in my takeout order tonight - Sezwaun Lo Mein - there was no description so I pulled the trigger.  A bit more expensive, it had a sauce that I did not find spicy but my wife did.  It was fairly flavorful and had veggies - onion, carrot, spring onion, broccoli.  Was not bad really.  

The real awful part was the combo order of broccoli and beef.  The beef is cheaper than the chicken - the beef had a strange flavor, like beef jerkyish flavor, not a flavor that should be in chinese food.  Perhaps the beef had 'aged' some?  Gross isn't really the word, downright nasty.  The fried rice was flavorless and not good.

This place does do a few things right, the teriyaki chicken tends to be very good, but based on what was ordered, the horrible beef means that we will be not ordering for any future chinese food needs.

Update: I can confirm that my wife got food poisoning from the beef, she started feeling bad within an hour or two after eating, and had vomiting, and diarhea.  Avoid this place, and most of all avoid the beef."}
{"text":"In town for a meeting and had a craving for Chinese. This place was the closest and had decent reviews so I gave it a try. Food was delicious and hit the spot (shrimp fried rice, shrimp/scallop dish, veg and shrimp egg rolls. Food was ready for pick up in less than 20 min. Service was very friendly and helpful. I would order from them again."}
{"text":"Very mediocre. Lots of food for the money, just wish it was better. Ordered crispy sesame chicken. Very dry and not crispy. Also ordered broccoli chicken, also dry. Ordered two egg rolls, only got one. Decided to try a new place - won't be going back."}
{"text":"I like Chang Jiang. The barbecue pork is nice and dry, not greasy. I enjoy their Singapore noodle as well. They are quick, reasonable and have reliable food. It's one our go-to restaurants in Verona."}
{"text":"By no means the greatest, but is a good choice for quality Americianized Chinese takeout. Don't know if it's me, but they seem to be one of the speediest when it comes to having my order prepped and ready by the time I arrive for pickup."}
{"text":"Love their chinese food! Have ordered many times and have tried general tso, garlic shrimp,  singapore thin noodles, sweet and sour chicken and they are all very good. But the spicy ones are not spicy enough. Overall, generous portions, good quality, delicious and pleasant workers!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Chinese I've had anywhere! Great service, only take out!  My favourite is the sweet and sour pork,   Roast Pork fried rice, Crispy Sesame Beef!! Its all at a great price too!"}
{"text":"It's cheap for a reason.  

If cheap biomass is what you're looking for, then Chang Jiang is the place for you.  However, if food quality matters at all, it's best to give this restaurant a wide berth.  

I had a short window for lunch and perusing the \"it's cheap and it didn't kill me\" reviews on Yelp, I figured I'd roll the dice and order the Mongolian Beef ($5.75) to go.  The ordering process went smoothly and my food was neatly packaged and ready to go when I arrived ten minutes later - sweet.  

Once I returned to my office and popped the top off my carryout container, things took a turn for the ugly.  A slight grayish hue to the beef was a telltale sign that a bout with gastric distress may be in my future.  Amplifying the grossness factor was the pool of grease and gloppy brown sauce at the bottom of the container.  Even the accents (flaccid snow peas and limp canned mushrooms) couldn't rescue this Hindenburg-esque disaster of a dish. Exercising no self respect and overwhelmed by a morbid sense of curiosity, I tried a couple pieces of the beef.  Narsty, narsty stuff - gristly, chewy and largely flavorless.  Lunch, meet garbage can.

There are several stellar Chinese restaurants on the south side of Madison (Orient House and Ichiban to name a few) where I can enjoy a well-prepared meal with quality ingredients.  With that said, a return visit to Chang Jiang is not in the cards for me."}
{"text":"I grabbed a quick lunch here and I was very pleasantly surprised. I ordered the hot and spicy beef with hot and sour soup. The portion was absolutely huge! The soup was not a full, standard size cup, but still more than enough with the rest of the meal.

The meat had was cooked well and the vegetables were plentiful - although the big pieces of green pepper threw me a bit - but this seems to be a common element of most styles of this dish. There also was a note of ginger that was really awesome! 

The spice level of both dishes (soup and beef) could have been better - it was very mild for being listed as \"spicy.\" 

The real standout was the fried rice that came with. This dish was not a mere afterthought and actually had flavor, peas, and carrots - it was good! 

I would definitely be willing to try more of the menu once I finish my leftovers of course."}
{"text":"It's cheap. So there's that. 
But I was in and out in under ten minutes, so that's weird. Why is it so fast? 
It's also weird that there's one table and four chairs right when you walk in. Can you eat there? At the end of the day I guess it doesn't really matter, the grub I grabbed was a-ok. Delicious? Ehhhhhhh, I don't need to rush back there. Edible and satisfying? Yup. I was also a little weirded out that you can see the kitchen, like every inch of it. And you can watch them cook. Like every step of the way."}
{"text":"I like the food here - it's a fast chinese lunch place so, don't expect the best Chinese food.  That said, it is good, prices are very reasonable, and I have had good experience with the seafood dishes - generous with shrimp.  The servings are very large - two lunches even for a big appetite.  Crab Rangoons are a particularly nice treat."}
{"text":"Chang Jiang is our go-to Chinese take-out place in Sun Prairie. It's not the most amazing Chinese food I've ever had but it definitely satisfies a craving.

We like getting their chicken lo mein - spicy and the curry chicken with mixed vegetables added. 

No complaints!"}
{"text":"Terrible! Food tastes like crap and the customer service is horrible. Woman behind the counter looked miserable didn't smile once. When my takeout food was ready the miserable woman just put my bag on the counter and said nothing. No \"thank you\" no \"come again\" nothing. This also has got to be the worst takeout Chinese food I've ever had. This will be my first and last visit."}
{"text":"Love the new Steamed Dumplings!! Also the online ordering is great, need to put a time ready in the e-mail though.  We've lived in Sun Prairie for over 10 years now and you just keep getting better and better!"}
{"text":"Chang Jiang is awesome! It's close to my house so its super easy for pickup. Sometimes it's not even necessary to call ahead! We just drop by and order in person and it will be out in 5-10 minutes! The food is delicious, i'm a huge fan of the chicken and broccoli, sesame chicken and general tsos. The egg rolls and crab rangoon are good as well although its nothing special. I will continue to order from here whenever I need chinese food"}
{"text":"Food is your average americanized Chinese food. The sauces all taste the same and you can't tell the difference between general's chicken or sesame chicken. The meat is of not great quality and can be kinda chewy or slimy. I have enjoyed more their home style tofu but still a similar brown sauce you would find on any of their chicken dishes.

We've been coming here for years since I was in high school. Service has always been good and the front staff very nice. They are also accommodating to special orders and substitutions. If this is the kind of Chinese food you like come here. But there are so many more places that have popped up in the last couple years that are so much better and much more traditional that we rarely come here anymore."}
{"text":"For a Chinese take-out place, Chang Jiang is awesome. I prefaced with \"Chinese take-out\" because that is very different from authentic Chinese restaurant. So, put your expectations in place before ordering is my suggestion!

They give huge portions. I swear my take-out bag is always many many pounds heavy. I've had the House Mei Fun twice now. Its flavor is pretty yummy. It's not overwhelmingly oily like most take-out places. I've also had the Eggplant with Eggplant Sauce (Yo, I heard you like eggplant amirite?). I'm guessing the eggplant sauce means the sauce in which eggplant is cooked, which is like a garlic sauce. Otherwise, I'll be impressed if the sauce were made from eggplants. The eggplants themselves lacked a bit of flavor, but I enjoyed it anyway. I highly recommend the Kung Pao Chicken. The chicken is breaded and it actually tastes like chicken, unlike chicken from other take-out places. 

Side story... I ordered on Eat Street last week, and it was my first time ordering at Chang Jiang. I totally skipped over the tip portion and felt awful about it. So, fortunately the food was good, because before we picked up the food, we had already decided to go a second time the next day to tip extra since we forgot!"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed in my order. They did not deliver sweet and sour with the crab Rangoon. That's the best part!  Also I ordered the steak and orange peel for the first time. The \"steak\" was pure gristle. I won't be ordering again."}
{"text":"Had delivery and it was good. Veggie mu shu had good flavor and lots of pancakes. General Tso's  tofu was fine, but wasn't as crispy as I like it. Really nice veggie lo mein, however. Fast delivery. Much better than any other Chinese take out around here."}
{"text":"Thought the food tasted great!  I ordered the Lo Mein, Sesame Chicken, General Tso's Chicken, and Sweet & Sour chicken.  Fast prompt service.  Easy to pick up and run.  Wished the General Tso's was a little more spicy and hot.  They package their food well so that you can save it for another day.  Prices were very reasonable!  Egg rolls were okay and so was the Crab Rangoon.  Good Take-Out!!!!"}
