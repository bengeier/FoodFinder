{"text":"groupon and yelp are a total scam.  They hide most of the poor reviews in their filtered area for any company that advertises with them.   Not reliable at all.   THis restaurant is not very good."}
{"text":"Small, whole in the wall type restaurant. Food was really good. Used restaurant.com coupon. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Took my groupon and wife on a date.

The cafe was dirty (at least it felt) I love hole in the wall's but my appitite was gone upon arrival. It was also warm inside and the nice tai food smell wasn't their (some other smell was). 

Meal's were mid-range $10 and would have given it 3 stars for flavor but really didn't feel like eating there; wife barely touched her food. I was worried about getting sick off the food (we were fine). They have pass all health inspections for the last 8 months I checked on my phone while I was eating."}
{"text":"Really good Thai food, especially for the price of the lunch specials!  I have never been a huge fan of curry, but I decided to try the pineapple curry and now I crave it often!  I recommend you try it, even if curry \"isn't your thing\"... it wasn't mine either, but now Jasmine's pineapple curry is.... enjoy."}
{"text":"I visited with a friend to use a Groupon and had the most hilarious experience. First off, let me just say the food was very good, especially the mango curry. We also had vegetable egg rolls and traditional pad thai. All good. So I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the food. But the ambiance was surreal. Communication was very difficult because the owner's and employees' English is very poor to nonexistent. I'm just sayin'. It's nothing against them, it's just if you are going to run a business in the US it's probably more incumbent on you to speak the prevailing language of your customers because, in general, most people don't speak Thai as a second language. But the menu is printed in English so if you don't have any questions you'll be OK. At least you know the food is authentic Thai!

The other weird thing was they had a TV on and it was tuned to some indy film that basically turned into some pretty graphic soft porn, which was a bit of a surprise, especially considering it was just 6:00 in the evening and there were families with kids sitting barely 15 feet from the screen. I read thru some of the other reviews and see that other diners have commented on seeing violent slasher stuff on that same TV for their dining pleasure. It's not going to keep me from going back because it really was a good laugh, but just be warned - it's not like your typical sports bar!"}
{"text":"Do not be scared away by the looks of it.. This is a classic example of you can't judge a book by it's cover.  I am a huge fan of Thai and everything I have ever had here is incredible!

update: 2013 - Service is lacking to say the least :( BUT food is still delicious"}
{"text":"The curry is amazing. Some of the best curry we have had on the east side. The pumpkin curry is ubertasty as is the mango curry. Go for the curry.

Only downside that the appitizers, while tasty are quite small. So just stick with the curry."}
{"text":"Checked in here while visiting my sister-in law. She raved about the food, so I was surprised to see that the place was empty on a Friday evening. The place isn't fancy, but they did try to spruce it up with some colorful lamps and bright paint.

The food was excellent! We had the green curry, fusion noodles, thai fried rice, and noodle soup. The green curry was my fave. It was so perfectly spicy, and the flavor was excellent. The fusion noodle dish was another win! Lots of veggies and the perfect amount of thai basil. The thai fried rice was okay. Not bad, but was closer to chinese fried rice than thai fried rice. The broth in the noodle soup was so good! Just a nice subtle taste mixed with some yummy noodles and cabbage.

I think the woman that took our order cooked our food as well. She was super nice and accommodated our requests for some substitutions since we had someone with food allergies.

I hope this place gets busier. It's so yummy and prices were very good for the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"Reviewing this place is very difficult. The food is excellent. We ordered yellow and green curry(both outstanding), chicken noodle soup (amazing broth a bit spicy) and a noodle dish. Appetizers were chicken satay (good) and fried shrimp. 

We arrived on a Saturday night, Groupon in hand, having read the reviews here, with trepidation. A busy strip mall on Saturday night, lots of kids in the parking lot with the bass pounding. We walk in and no one to greet us just ring the bell and we wait quite awhile. The entrance is not as nice as it could be. The fish tank desperately needs to be cleaned. The main lady who I believe to be the owner, waitress, and kitchen manager greets us happily and leads us to our table. The restaurant is very busy with a high maintenance table that seemed to skip out on the check. 

Another family walks in and is seated and then waited on before us - never makes my husband happy. But we can see this is a small family-owned restaurant and we aren't in a hurry. She finally takes our order with profuse apologies. We get the fried shrimp first, half the order was good  - the other half stone cold. Scary. Chicken satay had a wonderful flavor and very tender. 

Yellow curry comes out and is perfect, chicken, carrots and potatoes. Kid's chicken soup comes out with shrimp instead had to send it back to get chicken (felt terrible about it). Then it turned out to be too spicy for an 8 year old palate. I thought the broth was amazing. My other kid's noodle and chicken dish came out looking nothing like the description but he toughed it out - it was very good. Green curry was amazing, lovely spice, chicken and veggies. 

The main lady was completely overwhelmed by the Groupon experience which made for an odd dining experience. But she was so sweet and worked so hard to make it all good. It was just too much for one person.  Also they had a TV on with a violent real life killer reenactment and it was really upsetting my son so my husband got up and turned it off. (Just odd)

So in summary not the most pleasing ambiance experience but the food was really good. If this place was closer to our house we would most definitely order take out and eat it at home. I'm sure that would make it wonderful."}
{"text":"Food: Food is good, I have only tried the wonton soup, fried dumplings, and ice cream. The fried dumplings tasted okay, nothing special. I would mainly go here for the ice cream, bubble tea and smoothies.

Atmosphere & Service: The staff are nice, and you can sit inside, take out or sit outside during summers.

Pricing: Prices are great, this is somewhat why this place is given a four stars! Ice cream for $3, bubble tea is cheap ranging from $2.50 to $4."}
{"text":"I sit, staring over the menu, wondering to myself which dish I am going to get.  I could get something to compare to other Thai places, but we've already decided on Thom Yum, and that usually sets the tone for the rest of the meal.  Panang?  Nah.  Something green?  That sounds good.  Wait...what is this?  Pumpkin curry?!  Oh yes.  

I am a sucker for all things pumpkin.  And I must say they do pumpkin right.  Big chunks of some gourd (not necessarily pumpkin this time of year) as well as it being so delicately pureed into the reddish curry sauce, so as to have every bite permeated with deliciousness.

The Thom Yum was good, and my wife enjoyed whatever noodle dish she got.  Get medium; it is just the right amount of spice."}
{"text":"Hokkaido Bubble tea with pudding and Mango Milk shake with mango jelly are awesome???"}
{"text":"I LOVE their curry! Ambiance is meh but you can always order as take-out. I can never get enough! I think my favourite is the Pineapple Chicken Curry. It can be pretty spicy though so if you're kind of a spice wuss like me than ask for no spice and it will be mild, I asked for mild once and it was still too spicy for me lol.

I've eaten at a few different Thai places and none of them come close to how incredibly tasty this place is!"}
{"text":"I saw a groupon for this place and the menu is ridiculous. Curry galore. I just had to purchase it. I drove all the way from Scottsdale to try this place and I could not believe what I saw. The place has blacked out dirty windows with chalk writing sprawled actoss them. There were about 40 plants sitting in the front doorway of the restaurant in rusty tin cans. My mom started to walk back to the car, but I preservered. I enter the restaurant to find that it was completely empty. To the left there was a very large fish tank with cloudy brown water. The fish looked near death. To the right, next to the hostess stand, was an old dusty television. The surrounding area was covered with clutter. We turned around and walked out, groupon in hand. This place could not possibly make health code. I can not even imagine what the kitchen looked like. The place looked very unsanitary!"}
{"text":"I came back to try the bubble tea.  The place was empty on a Wednesday around 5pm.  Yay, no wait!  I went with a large (24oz) Taro bubble tea with lychee jelly $0.50 extra (although they spelt it weird in the menu like litchi) and after taxes came out to $5 even.  Good drink, yummy jelly, I was happy.  Next time I'd probably go for the milk shake.  They also have green apples jelly, coffee jelly, grape jelly, mango jelly and caramel pudding.

It looked like they added new items to their menu, too.  I'll have to come back and try the food - sandwiches (BLT, tuna, grill cheese, etc), bagel, soups, omelette, wrap & pita, poutine, etc.  They also have lunch combos $6.50-$8.50.

There's outdoor seating available.

They take credit cards (Visa or MC)."}
{"text":"Armed with my groupon I scoured the Yelp reviews.  Some was positive and a lot was negative.

Walking into the place, I feel like I'm in somebody's home... Just somebodys home I didn't want to be.  Gordon Ramsey would have a field day on Kitchen Nightmares with the place.  The best part is walking in and to the left is the dining room, and to the right had a handwritten sign that said VIP ROOM.

The older lady was very nice.  She seated us in a mostly empty restaurant but greeted with a warm smile.  I wish she would've gone over the menu a little more.  We ordered larb na, curry noodles, and yellow curry.  We didn't realize the curry noodles and yellow curry were the same thing except one had noodles and the other rice.

The larb na was fresh and full of flavor.  I really enjoyed it.  I wish they would've added toasted rice like most place would.  Also, I was hoping for cabbage used to scoop the larb na into.  Instead, there was this soggy lettuce underneath the larb that was drenched in lime & fish sauce.

The curry was okay.  I know I could make a better curry at home and in about 5 minutes too which was a shame.  

What really weirded me out like other yelpers was the tv.  She had wheel of fortune on one tv.  At another table, there was this portable dvd player playing kenny g.  The best part was the older lady was sitting there browsing the web.

I hope groupon doesn't slay this place, but even if I had another one, I think I will pass."}
{"text":"I love this little place. The woman who runs it is always on top of it and happy to have your business. Have eaten here twice and both times it has been fantastic. The cleanliness of the place isn't the best, but the food is great. She has a mango and pumpkin curry that are worth visiting for."}
{"text":"I'm going to start with three stars for Jasmine Thai.  Though the food that we ordered was tasty, it wasn't just what I had hoped for.  I ordered drunken noodles and it seemed like the noodles didn't separate all the way."}
{"text":"I feel as though I am over-rating this place with one star. As you walk in during the middle of July, there is no AC in the front room. We should have known better as there were only 2 other tables occupied during the lunch rush. My wife got up to use their restroom, and ran back to me because the lights in the hallway were not working, and she needed the assistance of my keychain flashlight to find her way to the dingy bathroom. Our chicken sate did not come with skewers, or cucumber Saliad as was listed on the menu. The Jasmine fried rice with chicken was not even jasmine rice, but rather a soggy calrose rice that was burnt. The chicken legs were still frozen, and had to be sent back. The cook simply re-fried the chicken and sent it back, burnt rice and all. 

Even with a groupon, which is a total scam with multiple limitations, we ended up paying an extra $10 bucks for a mandatory 18% tip and tax. I never write reviews, but this was the worst meal I have ever had in my entire life!!  Avoid this place at all cost!!  Please!!"}
{"text":"I love getting Thai takeout from here.  The atmosphere inside is something to be desired, but the food is good.  I order from here all the time.  The portions are pretty good sized and it is relatively cheap.  The staff is always very friendly."}
{"text":"I used to eat here several times a week for the last 2-3 years. However I've stopped going to the Jasmine Cafe. When it comes to choosing everyday lunch food there are three basic dimensions I use: quality, quantity, and value. Sadly, this location has slipped in all three over the last few months. What used to be a gem in an area of greasy take away has since dropped to mediocre fare. The staff are delightful. I think the final straw was the floors; they're grimy, particularly around the counters, and they've been that way for a while now."}
{"text":"I'm so done with this place. I ordered for the last time the other day as they are scammers. We order to-go food from here because they actually put out a rather tasty product but the process is just way too painful. Just placing the order is an incredible task as the people answering the phone speak next to know English.  Don't dare tag me a racist as I'm far from that but it's reality that you need to convey an order and have it made correctly - that's basic. To exacerbate this their on-line menu is conveniently numbered but it's THE WRONG ONE further adding to the confusion. What a hot mess. The last few orders we have gotten home and the order is wrong...errrrr! The topper is the last two times they have tried to scam when we had a coupon and that is where the line gets drawn when you lack integrity with your customers.

{"text":"Very disappointed. 

My husband tried ordering coconut juice to drink, and duck for dinner. The waitress said they ran out of both, because the previous night was very busy. I found that hard to believe, considering we were the ONLY patrons in the entire restaurant on a Friday night. He got a mango smoothie instead, but she forgot to add the boba he requested. The cream cheese wontons had absolutely no crab in them, and the spring rolls were made mostly with lettuce. The mango curry was bland and boring. An unappealing broth overwhelmed the few pieces of squid and shrimp in my husband's seafood dinnner. Our food took much too long to be prepared, since the cook had no one else to serve. The hostess ignored us for the majority of dinner, and was very cold the few times she interacted with us. 

Poor service and lackluster food. We gave this place a chance, and it was terrible."}
{"text":"In the old location of the Weng's Chinese Restaurant, I really hope this little Thai restaurant does not suffer the same fate.  The first time I walked in, I was definitely surprised by how bright and colorful this place is. Weng's was always sort of drab; a fresh coat of paint has done wonders for the place.

The reason you need to go to the Jasmine Cafe is their lunch special. For  $7.00 you get one of 10 entrees, a small bowl of curry, and buffet.   The buffect includes: stir fry noodles, kind of like a pad thai, steamed rice, fried rice, fried wontons and a soup of the day.  The soup of the day was tom yum soup, the last time I went there.  It was all delicious, and I keep going back.  Especially the curries.  THey've got the traditional red, green, and panneng curries, but they also have massaman curry.  I won't call it life's blood, but damn I could live off of massaman curry.

Admittedly, the food is not that spicy.  I've learned the first time at a Thai restaurant order mild; it's safe and unlikely to cause pain.  Jasmine Cafe's medium is still pretty weak, and Hot could still be hotter.  But I believe that spicy food should be hot enough to make you sweat.  Unlike one of my friend's who believes that spicy food should melt your face off and burn through your intestines like thermite.

The only downside to the Jasmine Cafe is it's pretty empty.  The first time I went there, I was the only person in the  place.  It's definitely not a scenesters place to be, but but good cheap food it is."}
{"text":"Great, fresh food along with friendly service and a colorful interior keeps me coming back to this thai restaurant.  

The food is  a little light but that only allows me to use the wonderful sauces they have on their chili tray.  It allows me to \"tune\" the flavor of my meal to my liking without being overwhelming.

Delicious food, great price!"}
{"text":"showed up at 6:30 friday with a friend to use my entertainment coupon. first impressions of the ambiance had us concerned. Bathrooms were clean, and peaked in kitchen seemed clean. We decided to stay. started with spring rolls for appetizer, and was just ok. My friend had crispy golden noodle, and I had Pad thai, and they were both delightfull."}
{"text":"Passed by this place the other day and stopped in at 2PM; was still able to order from the lunch menu, which made me pretty happy; soup, entree and spring roll. Served me the bowl of soup while waiting for takeout. I was really happy with the  pad thai, and the huge portion size even though it was from the lunch menu. Spicy the way I asked for it. I've been looking for some good pad thai in the EV; and I found it. 

Not a very very fancy place at all, but not an issue for me, since I usually do take out."}
{"text":"Bought a Restaurant.com certificate and they are out of business with a disconnected phone number and for lease sign on the doors."}
{"text":"What a rip off. $10 for the beef special and it wasn't even close to resembling the picture. A small amount of beef with some sauce along with rice and a small salad. They ran out of chicken. I would not recommend this place. I went there because of the review and seemed like an inexpensive place with good food. It is expensive for what I got. If you get take out make sure to look at what you getting before you leave. 

There are much better places out there that offer better value."}
