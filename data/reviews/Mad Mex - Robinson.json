{"text":"Came in on Wednesday night around 9. No hostess, so I sat close to the bar. Took a long time for someone to address me. My waitress didn't seem too happy about being there. Got a beer that I didn't like. My waitress didn't inquire why I didn't finish it. The food was good. Wouldn't come back though. Service is important to me."}
{"text":"I love Mad Mex!  I know I'll have a guaranteed good time.  The food is tasty, they offer a good beer selection, the service is friendly and attentive and they play cool music.  My one complaint is the meals are too big!  But they let adults order off the kids menu.  Not many places allow that, but Mad Mex always meets my request.  Mad Mex puts their customers first!  Oh, and they let you sample the beer!"}
{"text":"The waitress was very nice and quick and the establishment was clean. I enjoyed the feel of the atmosphere.   However, for the price the flavor was not outstanding, it was good, just I was expectinf more. And the portions were microscopic, it's mexican it should be tons of food. It was very little. And the margarita was literally nauseating. Don't know if it was the mix or tequila."}
{"text":"Ate the kateys red velvet enchilada ... awesome. Very cool patio too."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a nightcap. Good food options and bar offers something for every craving.  Went with their top shelf margarita...fresh tasting (read: no premix taste) and the boneless wings. Go southwest style for something different. Atmosphere is open and bar staff is friendly!  Adding this to my list of places to visit next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Went for a nice family dinner on a Monday.  Hostess and service were attentive and pleasant.  Very efficient. Overall an OK experience.  Some things need updating such as chip baskets that are frayed and coming apart.  The menu had decent variety but just seemed like standard Mexican fare.  Nothing like the Salsa seemed like it was made fresh.  Just basic fare.  Even the burritos just seemed like they were basic.  No great thought or Wow! factor. It wouldn't hurt to have daily features of some sort to enhance the menu. Just not a place I'd make \"must visit again\" ."}
{"text":"A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. Get yourself here if you like Mexican food. Especially if you're vegan like me! The atmosphere is dark and seductive, and the service is very prompt. When I come here I order the tofu wrapture with daiya cheese, vegan sour cream and southwestern sauce, and I don't know if I've ever had a more satisfying eating experience. The blend of flavors is divine. The tortillas aren't too flour-y, and the individual flavors meld into one glorious whole. It's not like a standard Mexican place where all the flavors taste separate and you feel like you ate a truck afterwards. They have this thing down. Recommend."}
{"text":"This place was so good! Cheap, fast and great service. Only complaint was a long wait time, but we did come on Friday at 7.30. Our server was awesome and the food was delicious."}
{"text":"Dont understand the great reviews here. Mad Mex is ok at best. Service was poor and slow, unappetixing platings, food was not great. Everything tastes like it was cooked with beer.    If you want mexican, save time and money by going to taco bell.  The food quslity is similar"}
{"text":"It was OK. I am more of a traditional when it comes to mexican food. It wasn't worth the money. I could have gotten authentic mexican for half the price. I did like their vegetarian selections. Probably won't go back. Their brownie and ice cream that comes with the kids meal was great. Again not worth the money."}
{"text":"So many great memories here!! Love to grab margaritas with friends and eat some great food.   The cilantro lime dressing is to die for!"}
{"text":"Really good atmosphere, food was good, however nothing out of this world.  Price was moderate...A little pricey for what you get however I'd come back"}
{"text":"Awesome place for lunch.   Kids meal is the best value around.   Great tasting food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Awesome food, great service!  I had carnitas tacos and my husband had the shrimp fajitas. Both were great!  Our server was very attentive, got everything correct, and everything came out very quickly. Nice, relaxing atmosphere too. Our booth was very intimate. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"All I can say about Mad Mex is WOW! The atmosphere was right up my alley, music was perfect and the service was attentive and visually pleasing. Then came the food! Portions are more than enough and the flavor is out of this world! It is an hour drive from my house and I could justify the drive for this any day of the week. Mad Mex, you just blew my mind!!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here and was amazed by the food and all the options. The menu had a nice selection for vegetarians. I loved the potato taquitos. Went back for dinner the next day. Only downside is the place had a small smell of old beer."}
{"text":"Good food, 2/2. Good manager interaction, he really cared about everyone, 1/1. Poor greeting, we could not find a hostess for 1 min and 30 secs, I mentioned this to the manager and he apologized and took fault which made me like the manager as for the greeting however, 0/1. As for the server it may have just been him but when the person I was with asked for the carnitas tacos he quickly said they were not good and was quite rude about it, also when I asked what enchiladas he preferred he said the carnitas enchiladas were not good rather then saying what was good. He didn't smile a lot and I felt weird about him all together, kind of a jerk for a waiter. 0/1"}
{"text":"i've visited 3 mad mex locations in Pittsburgh (Robinson, Oakland, & Greentree) and have yet to go wrong. on this particular visit, my friend and i took advantage of coupons for free burritos that we'd been sent via email for signing up for the Mad Mex mailing list. They aren't bombing my inbox too frequently except for the things I'd like to know about (like new beer selections available.) The Robinson location is in a corporate looking building but once you're inside, you'd never know it. We visited around lunch time. The music was good. There were tables available inside and outside and we had our pick. Our server was terrific, giving us plenty of time to figure out what we wanted to order. My friend tried the russion stout on nitro tap which was a good time. The food was as great as I've come to expect from Mad Mex. I didn't care for the toritilla soup that came as part of my  meal--but that was on me. There were other selections available that may have better suited my tastes, for sure. I'm used to a more spicy tortilla soup so my expectations weren't met there but that isn't Mad Mex's fault! The carnitas burrito was delicious and the blue cornbread a perfect pairing. I'd visit any of the Max Mex locations I've been to so far again & wouldn't hesitate to explore other locations. The service and food seem consistent so far and when I'm craving sit-down tex-mex, I'd visit Mad Mex again."}
{"text":"I eat here all the time the desert is amazing! The tacos are brilliant! The chick en Fitaia is the best! Waitresses are awesome! If your looking for high quality food come here! In conclusion give this place a 10/10! This is my favorite place to eat!"}
{"text":"The tortilla soup was awful.  Tasted burnt and had 1 cube of chicken.  Hardly any meat in my order.  It was all beans and lettuce. Won't be there again."}
{"text":"Mexican with a twist. Large menu...Everything I have tried has been good. Great beer selection."}
{"text":"I was a little unsure of this place based on some of the negative reviews but have had nothing but the best experiences the three times I have visited Mad Mex!  The service is what you would expect from young twenty somethings... Aka not the best but the beer menu is usually spot on so I will forgive their sub-par service.  The carnitas nachos are my fave! Really good and fresh ingredients used on all of their dishes, this one included. You get a boat load of nachos too!  I would definitely not call this a Mexican restaurant. More tex-mex or Cali Baja type menu but I will continue to frequent Mad Mex."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant, decent service, food was below average at best. My shrimp burrito was full of rice and beans and hardly any shrimp at all. I don't mind paying for chips and salsa ,but when I do, I don't expect to get mostly broken chips and salsa with no flavor at all. Disappointed"}
{"text":"I decided while still at the table that I never want to come back again. The seating hostess was terrible, we didn't see a waiter at our table for about fifteen minutes. And after requesting the chips, salsa and guacamole, we waited at least another fifteen minutes. It could have all been overlooked, if the food hadn't been absolutely terrible and the waiter hadn't spilled the salsa and guac all down my pant legs. And we still had to pay for the chips and guac. I cannot recommend ever going here, even if only for happy hour, and most certainly not for the food or service."}
{"text":"Chips were good regular salsa was way too salty.  Tomatillo and avacado salsa was nearly straight tomatillos, it really needed something to tame the tomatillos.  The carnitas burrito was ok but was just a little off on flavor making it soso.  The Mexican corn bread was absolutely awful.  I had two bites, I only had the second because I didn't believe it was as bad as first thought but I was wrong,  it was that bad.  Nothing here to make me go back and plenty to keep me away."}
{"text":"I have had two bad experiences at the Mad-Mex in Robinson.  Service is terrible and rude .  20 minutes before server came over, had to pay for chips and salsa.  Better Mexican in the area.  Will not be back."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.  The food is not traditional Mexican; they have actually improved on it.  The spices they use are delicious.  I like things hot and they've got plenty of them.  My favorites are the spicy Mad Mex chicken burrito and the spicy black bean dip.  When I first had their salsa I thought it had too much garlic.  But it has really grown on me and I can't eat one of their burritos without slathering on a ton of it.  The service is usually great too.  The only negative is they allow smoking at the bar."}
{"text":"I would have given it a 5 since I have such a great time here usually, but when I went this past weekend, I got a shrimp quesadilla, and the peppers were literally black and the shrimp was soggy/squishy. Normally though, I have a great experience here. You can usually get right in (not a long waiting time), and the service is standard. But they have the BEST margaritas (I love myself a good margarita), and pretty good queso. This is one of my favorite places to go when I come back to Pittsburgh to visit."}
{"text":"Saturday after getting my hair done next door at the salon, I came in for dinner. I had a white sangria along with mahi mahi tacos. The food was delicious and the staff was friendly. I enjoyed every bite. I'll return again when I'm the area."}
{"text":"Dirty silverware. Bad-tasting drinks, salsa, and guacamole. Haven't even been served my entree yet. Very unimpressed."}
{"text":"This update is in regards to Mad Mex at the Robinson Township location, specifically going with a larger group of people:  I most frequently visit Mad Mex at this location and being that it is at the crux of roads between where I live and other family lives, I have gone here a few times with a bigger group of guests. After my most recent visit I would not suggest that is a good plan.  The most recent visit with a group was on a mid-weekday night with no special game playing on the screens. However, the place was really packed. Our plans had been completely last minute, so we didn't get to call in a reservation. We were told the wait would be 20-25 minutes; we waited about 50 to an hour to get seated. Service does take longer for big groups but it was so slow about 2 hours passed from when we were seated to when we were able to pay the check and go. The evening included our server who spilled the whole tray of drinks on our table (hey, it happens) and who eventually became either so stressed or annoyed that she didn't tend to our table for long periods of time and when she did so she was not very polite.  Another warning for going with larger groups is in regards to ordering dessert. We had a few kids with our group and so ordered the brownie a la mode and a couple of ice cream burritos. All of the ice cream was melted for all three dishes when it arrived. It was as unappealing as it sounds (think: soupy cream burrito) but we were all so eager to leave that we didn't bother to mention it. Melted ice cream at restaurants usually happens if the plates come straight from the hot wash or--as it appeared in our case being that the plates weren't hot--the server waited too long to pick up the dessert after ordering it through the P.O.S.  I can most accurately describe the entire experience that evening as arduous. Though I enjoyed the guests that I went with--this time being my family--the atmosphere of stress and negativity was set by the service and pacing of the meal. I was quite relieved when we left and was wishing in hindsight that we had gone anywhere else. It will be awhile before I can go back again, but it definitely won't be with a group of more than four."}
{"text":"Southwestern wings are very good.  Nice tequila selection at the bar. Thursday evenings are great for happy hour.   The menu is no doubt unique.. refreshing .. something for everyone.   The restrooms are clean and the restaurant has seating inside and out.   The prices are slightly above average but some items on the menu are worth it."}
{"text":"36 minutes to get chips and salsa, 1:15 to get chicken tacos, and we had to go to the bar to get our own drinks. Everything was so spicy, it was almost inedible, even the guacamole.  Poorly managed, no one checking drinks or clearing plates.  Other tables arriving after us ate and left before we got chips. Never again."}
{"text":"This particular location tends to draw in more families with children than the other locations, so it can get noisy and the acoustics are pretty bad - lots of hard surfaces.  A friend had a wedding reception at this location and the service was great and very accommodating.  This may have been because they were guaranteed a big, BIG tip, but either way I was pleased.  If you're a hardcore fan of authentic Mexican food, this is probably not the place for you.  The enchiladas remind me more of chilaquiles - definitely more layered than rolled.  The burritos are huge but it really drives me crazy how segmented they are.  One bite will be all rice, the next will be all meat.  The tofu tacos are okay, but the bean sprouts seem like a weird addition.  I know, you're probably thinking \"What DOES this girl like about Mad Mex?\"  If you can let go of any previous Mexican food experiences (or if you've never had Mexican food before, as I hadn't when I first went to Mad Mex), some things are ok.  The tofu tacos minus the bean sprouts.  The California grilled salad.  The chickpea chili and black bean soup, the potato taquitos.  Nachos, chips & salsa, and guacamole are all decent.  Their sides are ridiculously huge and the desserts are all ok (except the sopapillas).  Basically, stick to the least authentic stuff and you should be fine.  Additionally, some of their entrees are available with your choice of either chicken, steak, shrimp, portobello mushrooms or tofu.  They have tons of vegetarian options.  They have good happy hour deals and good late night margarita deals.  They have raspberry, strawberry, mango, and kiwi margaritas year round, with one or two seasonal flavors per month, plus a full bar, a bunch of tequilas and a huge, varied beer list that tends to focus on local beers.  So basically: the less you know about Mexican food, the less disappointed you will be.  If you're a fan of authentic Mexican food, either stick to something more basic like a salad, or pick a different restaurant."}
{"text":"Since I hadn't been to this Mexican chain before, I decided to give it a shot. My girlfriend and I decided to try lunch at Mad Mex since we both love Mexican food and are always open to trying new places. This one however, will not see us again most likely, unless we want to try some drinks. We started with chips and salsa, after seeing another table with the same. What we hadn't seen prior to ordering was the prepared state of the salsa. It looked more like tomato salad, as it had none of the juice of any of the ingredients. The flavor was good, but it was very dry; not what you anticipate when having salsa. From there, we both ordered burritos. The Mad Mex signature for her, and the wing burrito for myself. I had expected a decently sized burrito along with some sort of side, like rice or beans. Instead, I got a plate-sized rectangular burrito, with a questionable sauce topped on, and a small bit of lettuce and more of the salsa (really making it look like salsa salad now). To my surprise, the sides I was expecting were in the burrito. Rice and beans throughout, and, except for the meat (which I might add was added very sparingly), there was nothing else to my burrito. While filling, the burrito held a flavor which did not really kick in, despite asking for the hot wing sauce when ordered. After smothering it in hot sauce from the table, it was better, but only as good as a rice and bean burrito can really be. I have no problem with a vegetarian meal as such, but I would've liked to be told before ordering it. Overall, the food wasn't overpriced and the service was decent, but I also didn't get much of what I wanted either. Maybe we ordered the wrong things, and this place is truly great underneath it all. However, the chances of returning, especially with other great Mexican meals at Taco Bell and Plaza Azteca looming nearby, are very slim to none. Thanks for trying, but I'd rather not try it again, Mad Mex. Adios!"}
{"text":"The steel sculpture at the entrance provided a glimpse at the whimsy of this joint. We were lead to a booth near the bar, which had happy lunch patrons. We were a bit surprised we had to order salsa and chips. The chips were good; warm and crunchy and the salsa tasty. Ultimate margarita on the rocks and red sangria were tasty and delivered quickly.   The lunch crowd had emptied just enough for the cool music to float into the room and contribute to a cool vibe. Service was prompt and spot on. The chimi came with a tomato cheese sauce which tasted very similar to vodka sauce. It was a good addition to a plump chimi. My companion said the black beans were tasty, but the rice was too bland. Guacamole was devoured with gusto.  A chopped salad had grilled cauliflower, butternut squash and Brussels sprouts; as well as corn, cherry tomatoes and greens. The ordered skirt steak was done perfectly and was surprisingly tender, given the cut. I would order this again AND again.  My companion was a bit taken back by the tariff, but it seemed on par for this city girl. I would return again and recommend them!"}
{"text":"Mad Mex is kind of a Pittsburgh favorite. The food is not Mexican and may be best described as a loose creative take on Tex-Mex. Once a Pittsburgh-only, super-local chain, they have expanded as a local chain in surrounding towns. This location is probably my second favorite due to it's convenient location, good service, and fun atmosphere (behind Shadyside which has two floors and a huge open air windows). My favorite thing about Mad Mex is that they have a huge variety of flavorful food - large, fresh salads to burritos and even lots of vegan friendly options. Also the strawberry margarita is almost dessert-like which I find pretty delightful."}
{"text":"I absolutely wish they had a Mad Mex in New Jersey.  This place is pretty much all I look for in a Mexican restaurant.  Apparently, there are about 7 Mad Mex's all in the Pittsburgh area.  The weird thing about this one is that it is located at the bottom of an office building.  Our group started at the bar.  The bar area was actually pretty packed on a Tuesday night - mostly during Happy Hour time.  There was only bartender working and she was completely overwhelmed.  It took a while to get a drink.  They definitely should have had at least one other bartender working.  They had a decent draft selection and everyone said the margaritas were pretty good.  I did not try one.    Our table was seated and I'm pretty sure there were at least 10 of us or so.  The waiter was very good and attentive throughout the meal.  Our table started out with a bunch of different baskets of chips and a number of dips.  1. Guacamole - it was good but it had a little too much lime zest for my taste.  If you're into that, you're going to love this one.  2. Red Salsa - I liked the red salsa but I felt like it could have used a touch more spice.  Not bad, though.  3. Queso Dip - we also had some sort of queso dip that was good.  It was my 2nd favorite - nice and spicy and who doesn't like cheese?  4. Black Bean Dip - typically, I'm not the biggest bean dip fan but this was excellent.  It had some melted cheese and it had just the right amount of spice to it.  I was surprised I liked it so much and I would definitely order it again.  I housed a ton of chips and dip - probably too much but I enjoyed it.  For my meal, I went with the Spicy Mad Mex Burrito and I went with chicken as the filler.  Also, the burritos are ridiculously cheap at less than $10...and they're huge.  It's served American style - this is kind of like my own term - meaning it doesn't come with melted cheese and a side of rice and beans.  It's served in a huge tortilla wrapped up with only a little bit of some sort of chipotle sauce on top.  It also came with a ton of guac, sour cream and salsa on the side.  It's amazing how many places are stingy with those but not Mad Mex.  They totally hook you up.  The burrito was pretty freakin' good.  Nice and spicy and came stuffed with a ton of fillers.  It was also huge - I have to stress that.  Not many people will be able to finish a burrito in one sitting.  It's a huge meal, but the quality of the food was also very good.    This is a really cool place.  I enjoyed everything about my meal.  Service was pretty good and the prices are more than reasonable - dare I say cheap.  I'll easily come out of my way to stop back here again the next time I am in Pittsburgh.  I'm hoping Mad Mex opens up some spots in Jersey by me."}
{"text":"For starters, their salsa is unique and great with the chips they obvi make here.  Went with a cup of Tortilla Soup and happy I did. Menu is extensive and exciting. Soup definitely made fresh.  Just got my Grilled Mahi Fish Tacos. I'm from the Jersey Shore area where fish tacos at Surf Taco was born... These are amazing!!!  Fresh, not skimpy, abundant and great tasting guacamole has me eating AND typing cause I can't wait to spread the word.  My only complaints are the food came at me too fast and one bartender was crazy although she kept up with managed frenzy.  I am not a big fan of multi-unit, or more so franchises, but I hope Mad Mex comes to NJ! My lunch veggie burrito yesterday and today's dinner were made with consistency and equaled freshness and quality and served pleasantly.  So they got it down so bring it on east please!"}
{"text":"The best Tex Mex in the area. Fresh preparations - good selection. Would like to see a few more vegetarian selections. Will be back here if my choice if the day is Mexican!"}
{"text":"After a long day of moving from Ohio to the Robinson area, we were hungry and tired. Mad Mex seemed like a casual dress place to eat since I had been there before.I remember good food an service. NOT THIS TIME  Busy as expected, but 3 hostesses couldn't make a decission on how much of a wait...and we asked for a beeper, that they really didn't want to give up???Off to the bar where the waiter there told us we could sit at a hightop and eat there! GREAT! We were waited on , and the restraunt manager came buy and said that wasn't good, but we could stay...we got some food,but one in our party wanted his steak to go because of the VERY LONG WAIT...soon after, ALL our our food is boxed up and the check is presented!!! What the heck??The waitress said it was a mistake...an what did we wanna do? DUH! I paid, and won't be back...There are plenty of dinner places in this area, FORGET THIS ONE!"}
{"text":"Nice side stop on our way home from Johnstown. I had the seasonal chicken and corn enchilada.  Really good - nice big and moist chunks of chicken, sweet, tender corn and the goat cheese was a nice add. The Colorado sauce was a spicy surprise so I was glad I got the guacamole as a cool compliment. My hubby got the crab and corn quesadilla and he loved it. Said the crab was nice and sweet. The one thing that bummed me out - the chips and salsa... Ok, they charge for it which I don't like, but whatever. What bugged me was we paid almost $4 for what seemed like the bottom of the barrel of chips. Lots of little corners and crumbs."}
{"text":"Another great Mad Mex location right in Robinson close to the mall. I met up with my father who was staying close to the airport overnight, and I actually had a bit of trouble finding the place (it's cryptically hidden facing the highway on the first floor of an office building. Once I found the parking lot, though, it was smooth sailing, good company, and good food. One thing I will complain about, which happens at every Mad Mex location, is they put small tables incredibly close to other tables- which means that you're essentially immersed in both of your neighboring tables' conversations (and vise versa). However, the food was really great- I had a taco salad and they allowed me to substitute the beef for tofu (which was above par). The waitress was incredible, not even considering that it was a crazy busy Friday night. I probably won't eat there again because I live closer to the Oakland and Shadyside locations, but I definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Food poisoning for everybody who had a \"mad mex\" steak burrito. I thought the decor was dreadfully ugly, tacky and overdone, but my friend (who tells me he has a cast iron stomach but was still internally disturbed by the horrible food here) claims to have liked it.   I am giving this place 2 stars because they had a wide tequila selection (altho they don't seem able to mix a drink to save their lives), and because my friend liked their gaudy art. Service was ok, food was terrible (mostly rice with a tiny scattering of presumably rotten meat), art was questionable.   Bottom line: AVOID, unless you are looking to do shots of top shelf tequila."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. This is our favorite place to eat. Tons of burrito choices. Try the seasonal choices they never disappoint. Awesome Tortilla soup. Ultimate margarita is delicious. Husband loved IPA week. Great beer choices. Bartenders very knowledgeable and always make you feel welcome. Jeff the manager is top notch."}
{"text":"Recommendation: A must visit! Delicious and unique food, great presentation, helpful and friendly service. I would definitely return and recommend it.   Food: The food was pretty great! We started off by getting delicious locally-made chips and Pineapple Habanero salsa. The salsa was uniquely sweet and spicy, but the spice wasn't enough to overpower the fruity flavor. I ordered a Spicy Mad Mex Burrito, which is a typical rice/beans/steak burrito with some added spice. It came with sour cream, guacamole, and pico de gallo on the side, all of which were excellent. The pico de gallo was a little on the dry side, but the moisture from the rest of the ingredients was more than enough to counter it. I ended up eating half the burrito and taking the rest (and as many chips as I could) home to eat for a snack later.    Ambience: The decoration was great! Lots of laser-cut metal with tex-mex decoration, the plates were colorful, and the music was hip and modern while not being Top 40 hits. I have to say I seriously enjoyed the menus, which were a leather and wood wrapped affair and were very nice. The food names and descriptions were entertaining while also being extremely easy to interpret.   Service: Our waitress was friendly and helpful without being too imposing. She frequently refilled our water, which was wonderful considering the spicy foods we ate and the fact we sat outside in the heat. She checked on us often, brought out our food quickly, and processed our check rapidly as well. It was great!  Final thoughts: I'd definitely go here again. There were a variety of other items on the menu I'd like to try, the prices were completely reasonable (each dish was about $10) and the ambiance was inviting. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Was in Pittsburgh for business and was trying to find something different to eat, something that we didn't have back home in Colorado.   I read the reviews and totally got that this was more Tex-Mex, and I came in with out the expectation of comparing it to the Mexican food I get in Denver, or Pasadena where I lived prior.   At first , being unfamiliar with the area, I couldn't find it.  I almost ended up going to Ditka's ( bldg in this complex) , but as I was pulling around, I saw Mad Mex, in bldg 2 of this complex)- so i gladly made my way over.  I didn't realize this place was in the first floor of an office building.  Good to know :) .  I like the decor and the atmosphere, enjoyed the service, and the queso and chips I ordered.  I ordered enchiladas.  I shouldn't have, because we make enchiladas at home all the time, and it may cloud my judgement.  It came with Colorado 'red' sauce, so I thought I would be ok, and then half green sauce.    The food came out quickly and I did like the green sauce, but didn't care for the Red sauce, it almost reminded me of spaghetti sauce.  So, I ended up scraping it off and trying to smooth out my green sauce.   This isn't going to deter me from coming back and trying something else, it was just a matter of me not being positively overwhelmed with the sauce on this particular item.   I think I would probably like something else, and look forward to updating this review... from good to great :)"}
{"text":"MAD MEX is definitely in my top list favorites list.  All locations that I've been to offer a different feel to the scenery, but offer the same high quality of service. This is a usual happy hour location for my friends and I after work.  Half off drafts and wings.  Pretty good deal! They have a great lunch menu which gives you many dinner options at a lunch price.  You will be stuffed and pleased with the bill.  Also, if you sit at the bar (anytime of the day) you get free chips and salsa.  At dinner the price goes up a little, but still the great food and very filling.  Try the mahi mahi fajita.  It's so amazing I almost cried while eating it.  This is a very vegan friendly restaurant where you can ask for soy sour cream and tofu cheese as substitutes (tastes amazing).   The kids menu at dinner is surprisingly cheap for a lot of food.  They can get a burrito, with sides, and a brownie and ice cream (if I remember this correctly) for like 5 bucks.  That's great, because its hard to rationalize paying big bucks for kids when dinning out.   Also, the staff is very friendly and helpful.  My family loves this place and I highly suggest it, thus the reason I chose to review Mad Mex first as a new Yelp member!"}
{"text":"Our server was wonderful and the food was great! Unique items and large portions. I spotted it as soon as we got to town getting off the interstate, so it was one of the first restaurants we tried, it was late when we got there but we weren't rushed at all."}
{"text":"Delicious! Fresh! HUGE portions! Mexican decir & friendly staff. My mom & I both got chicken enchiladas with vegetables and they were delicious- while our order was not vegetarian, they offered many vegetarians options or substitutions.  The music was loud but they moved us to a quieter table without a problem.  I wouldn't have found Mad Mex without Yelp & was even a bit unsure when we pulled up - but I am so glad we went and will highly recommend it (I might also recommend splitting a meal if you won't be able to refrigerate left overs because so much awesome food).   Got more food than I expected for the price of our enchiladas and the flavors & textures were excellent !"}
{"text":"If you like Mad Mex, you'll like it here. The decor and menu are both pretty standard for this particular chain of restaurants. That's not a complaint, by the way - I love Mad Mex. I love their menu, I love their drinks, and I enjoy stopping in to enjoy enormous meals at great prices. This particular location is not the closest Mad Mex to me, but it certainly struck me as the potentially least crowded location I've been too - especially since I visited on a Thursday.  This Mad Mex is the first in the chain where I ordered tacos during my visit (I'm pretty fond of this chain's burritos and quesadillas and usually order one of those). I opted for their special tacos, which were basically veggie tacos with shiitake mushrooms and asparagus. What I got had a unique flavor profile and I really enjoyed it since it wasn't the typical round of taco toppings. And the tacos alone would have been plenty of food, but the order also came with rice and beans. I was more than satisfied with my meal.  The only thing I could negatively comment on about my first visit here was that a friend's tea order was seemingly lost by our waitress. My friend ultimately had to ask for it again when the food arrived. But none of our food orders were wrong, and we each got our water, so for the most part we were all more than satisfied with our service. I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Rude staff, overpriced food.  On my first visit to Mad Mex, it was early Saturday night. We were a group of ten looking for a meal, and were promised a twenty minute wait time. We still hadn't been seated when we left two hours later. The manager was waving his arms and saying it wasn't his fault, and that there's nothing he can do.   I did give them another chance. I went with a friend on a Monday evening. It was a quiet night and we didn't have any trouble getting seated. The waiter was lethargic, and couldn't answer the simplest questions about the beer or the food menu. The food wasn't anything special, and overpriced for what it was.  My third visit was for drinks in a small group, on a weeknight, perhaps a Wednesday or a Thursday. We were sitting at a table. It was a quiet night, yet we had to keep walking to the bar to tell the staff to find our waiter and send him to our table, over and over again. Even though it was over an hour before closing time, staff kept working with their rags and vacuum cleaners all around us, and making faces like we should consider leaving soon."}
{"text":"After living in the south west, it's hard to find a good authentic Mexican restaurant. Mad Mex nailed it! The chicken mole burrito was amazing! The chicken fajita was perfect. The kids menu was ideal. Thankyou!!!"}
{"text":"I'm vegan and definitely appreciate the vegan options.  Everything I've had has been delicious.  Service is usually okay - last time there my partner was given something he said no to and charged for it.  Not a fan of how noisy it is there.  At dinner time it's pretty impossible to hold a conversation across a table without yelling.  I really enjoy the food so will continue to eat here, although might be better for carry out if not at a slow time of day and you mind the noise."}
{"text":"Came in to use my Free Birthday Burrito and DAMN, was it delicious.  I was flying solo so I sat at the bar.  The bartender was very nice, I think his name was Heath.  He helped me order a Wingo-rito with Inferno sauce and it was awesome.  I think this location is going to be my new fav Mexi-merican restaurant.  Keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"Food and service was above average ! Really busy friday night at Mad Mex! The wait time was 45 mins for table but they got us back in 15 min while we were hanging out at the bar !"}
{"text":"One of the only restaurants that actually cater to Vegans! They have a LOT of veggie options and Tofutti sour cream and Daiya cheese to replace the dairy. Everything is clearly labeled on the menu so there is no confusion. Our server was also very knowledgeable and happy to answer all of our menu questions. The chef brought the food to our table and reassured us that everything was Vegan. This is my new favorite place to eat!!"}
{"text":"Food was AMAZINGGGGGG!!! I had the Angry Hippie Burrito with tofu sour cream and cashew cheese. The burrito was HUGE! Made me feel like I was back on the west coast with authentic Mexican food!  The portion size was amazing! I eat a lot and couldn't even finish the burrito. So much flavor! The vegan cheese literally melted in my mouth. Very hard to find above average places to eat out when you're vegan. But I would absolutely go back here!   Our servers name was Paisley and she was awesome! Super sweet and attentive. It wasn't too busy when we went but the venue is nice. Very clean. Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Ok. I lived in Texas for 8 years so I know a taco or two. The street corn and steak tacos are on point. Watch out for the fresh jalapeño!  The margaritas are so so...nothing to write home about but they did one thing that absolutely amazed me. The SOUTHWESTERN WINGS. To incorporate cilantro on fully cooked, yet still moist chicken wings.....I'm still trying to finish them. (FLATS!!)  If only they'd turn the AC down so your food wouldn't be cold before you got halfway into it...  Other than that- id do it again!!"}
{"text":"I will say first I absolutely love Mad Mex I'm vegan and the options for me are great here. When I lived in Pittsburgh I ate here at least once a week and the service and food has always been top notch. This location has me very confused. I ordered a salad and asked to omit an ingredient (never has been a problem before) this location refused to accommodate. The waiter was also very argumentative when  I asked questions. I am very sad and needless to say I will not be coming to this location again ...I talked to the manager and he tried to make the situation better so we submitted another order and it came out wrong again .. I think in a nut shell this location has a rude wait staff and a lazy kitchen staff .. Don't let this location sway you from visiting mad Mex my favorite locations are shady side and monroeville :)"}
{"text":"A chain restaurant which does not serve authentic Mexican food, but it is open late and has a $7 Big Azz Margarita from 10pm till Midnight (which is when I dine). Happy hour features half off drafts and wings too so that is probably the best time to visit though. The atmosphere is loud, with televisions around the bar. Service is mediocre at best but the staff is friendly so that balances it out a bit.  If you like hot flavors try the Pineapple Habanero salsa (I find it sweet with a kick). Their guacamole was good at least the couple of times I tried it, and their jersey chips and taquitos make up for my choice of appetizers. If you want to try their wings, the Southwestern and San Francisco are well balanced with spices.   This place will keep you well liquored and pleasantly satiated. Their burritos are ok - I frankly prefer Chipotle or Qdoba burritos, however the Max Mex burritos are humongous and generously packed with a lot of stuffings. The Quesadillas and Fajitas are better choices in my opinion. I liked the hard shell tacos with the grilled steak too, though I found a lack of consistency in the flavor - the meat was well seasoned a couple of times and the other times I found it to be bland.  This is a good place to hang out around the bar, get a few drinks and some appetizers."}
{"text":"We had gone here pretty late for dinner, later than I usually eat but I figured we were hungry and I really wanted to check this place out.  We arrived around 10pm after a long day of driving and shopping but I was looking forward to eating here for quite some time.  I knew they were open late and I was pretty hungry and when that happens I get pretty greedy.  Jake was our server this evening and I had told him it was our first time at Mad Mex so I'd have to go through the menu a bit.  There is a lot of choices here, burritos, tacos, enchiladas, fajitas, chili, it just went on and on.  The drinks menu was pretty interesting.  It was sort of confusing as it appeared there were some drinks on both the drink menu and the main menu but I ended up with a Green Flash PA.  I've been drinking a lot of pale ales recently and this one was really good.  A smooth taste and a nice hoppy flavor.  I ended up ordering 2 of these that night.  My wife ordered an apple cidar margarita.  I tasted it and it was really good.  It tasted like an apple pie.  My wife who does not drink anything really besides wine and very little at that drank the whole thing and loved it.     Jake brought a really generous serving of salsa and chips.  The salsa was really good.  Not runny but solid chunks of tomatoes.    I had ordered the large order of San Francisco style wings (honestly I didn't know what that meant) which on the menu said that they were sweet and tangy or something like that.  Jake asked if I wanted them spicy and I basically said middle of the road was fine.  My wife can't really handle hot so I thought it was safe.  The wings were just awesome.  Properly cooked through and through and crispy and saucy at the same time.  Hot and fresh, and as I said, cooked well.  My wife can't eat wings if they aren't cooked well so it passed that test with flying colors.  I loved these wings and for a large order that said something to the effect that were 14 or so it seemed to go on and on.  I didn't count them but it seemed to be more than 14 wings.  They weren't small and skimpy either.  We're talking naked wings (not breaded) but they were meaty and filling.  My wife had ordered the turkey chili and I had ordered mahi mahi tacos.  While my wife had her chili she said it was really good but it was overly spicy for her.  I had tried it and it was really tasty but I had agreed it was rather on the hot spicy side and for her she unfortunately can't handle that level.  Jake said it had chipotle in it.  For me to think it was rather on the hot side, it's hot.  I eat a lot of hot and she had forsaken the chickpea chili because it had jalepeno in it.  She probably would have been better off with that instead.  Still, the chili was a solid chili, just too hot for her.  She had more wings and I gave her a taco and offered her more but she only wanted one.    The mahi mahi tacos were amazing.  They had that grilled taste and the baha sauce had a really nice kick to to it.  The food here was simply great, just a tad hot and I can't believe I'm saying that...   I'd love to go back to Mad Mex and try more of their menu.  I'd love to try their carnitas."}
{"text":"Cool music, great food - too filling :)"}
{"text":"This is my go-to for Tex-Mex. No, it's not authentic Mexican, but I don't think it pretends to be.   I appreciate the VARIETY of vegetarian/vegan options and the SEASONAL features. (Protein options for meat-eaters and veg alike, so everyone can find something they like.) The fall vegetable mix (roasted Brussel sprouts, cauliflower, and butternut squash) can be added to most things - salads, burritos, etc. And the butternut squash soup is fantastic. In the spring, they did something with asparagus and snow peas. Portion sizes are huge. The pick-a-dippa appetizer combo is great if you want to try the different heat levels of salsa; the guac is subtle, cooling, so I like it as a balance to the pineapple-habanero salsa, my favorite for clearing the sinuses.   I've found the service to be good 90% of the time. There's always that odd time when you'll get a new server - usually at the beginning of the summer when the college students first start. But year-round, the bar service is friendly and on point. I'm not a big marg drinker, so I can't comment on the subtleties of the margarita options. But the beer menu is large."}
{"text":"The wings were good and my wife's salad was pretty good, but I had a 22oz big azz margarita and then two 12oz ones on happy hour.  I don't know if there was any alcohol at all in any of them to be honest.  I think that is a rip-off, so you are better off getting beer at this location or making friends with the bartender.   I felt no effect at all from 46oz of margarita?  Really?  i was sitting outside, so couldn't see the bartender make the drinks.  I am a former owner of a bar and years of experience in the industry, so it ins't like I don't know what I am talking about.  Anyway, the food was okay and service was okay.  I just would like to get what I pay for when it comes to drinks.   Maybe next time I will ask for the tequila on the side, so I can actually see if they put any in at all!"}
{"text":"Nice and cozy, strong character like the other mad mex. food was good as always. The bartender was nice to adjust my drink to my like without any attitude. Don't forget to get free chips and salsa if you sit at the bar."}
{"text":"I have no idea why people love this place. My fiancé got the combo fajita with chicken and beef. The rice was undercooked, the meat had no flavor, the chicken was overcooked and dry, and it did not come with beans, all for $16. She ordered a side of beans and they were pretty dry. I ordered the barbacoa burrito and ordered double meat for an extra $2.50 and got carnitas meat with it. The burrito was about half rice half meat.  On the plus side the strawberry lemonade was delicious and it was a nice restaurant with average service."}
{"text":"Great staff and great food. We had date night here and our waitress was very personable and didn't make it seem awkward at any moment. The management came over to the table to check on us and that was nice to see."}
{"text":"Mad Mex is my favorite restaurant! Birthdays, anniversaries, happy hours... always at Mad Mex. This place is great for vegetarians! My go-to order is the tofu mad mex burrito with a whole wheat tortilla. So good! vegan cheese and sour cream are also available. The chips and salsa are fantastic and the margaritas are pretty top notch as well. Watch for special seasonal margarita flavors- the apple cider margarita last fall was the best!"}
{"text":"Great service Good sangria Had the dip trip to start Xx queso is spicy and delicious Roasted tomato salsa is standard salsa Guacamole was very very good for not being prepared table side  Ordered the seasonal crab/corn quesadilla and it did NOT disappoint.  They have a PLETHORA of healthy and vegan options  Great concept and great atmosphere Would love to see this franchise expand"}
{"text":"Holy guacamole! This location has never disappointed me. From the consistently friendly bartenders, to the ingenious selection of beers and spirits, any time I stop in here turns out to be a good time!  On this adventure, I took the chalkboard recommendation and ordered a 12 oz Bomb Bananna Slammin' margarita! Referring back to my opening sentence... holy guacamole what a good idea! Along with my pre afternoon beverage, I ordered the nachos grande with chicken! Which brings me to the disappointing part of my day. While the nachos were everything I dreamed of, the portion was far to large! I decided to grab a doggy bag, so that I could enjoy it again later. Unfortunately, I got distracted and left my doggy bag behind. Sad day.  So learn from my mistakes friends! Don't ever leave your doggy bag behind!  To sum it up, good food, good drinks, and a great atmosphere and service!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in the city. Their tacos are amazing as are their margaritas. They have a great craft beer selection as well."}
{"text":"Mad Mex is super vegan friendly, and has a huge menu that pleased even my Mexican food-disliking dining companion. I had the veggie enchilada, and got it with dairy-free cheese and vegan sour cream. The portion size was huge, and the plate was very inexpensive. The vegetables were fresh and the meal was all-in-all very delicious. All in all, I would go back for some good Tex-Mex cuisine."}
{"text":"We met some friends here on our way into Pittsburgh on a Thursday night and man, we were impressed! None of us had ever eaten here before, but we all want to go back! Only 20 minutes from downtown in the Robinson Towne Center: a welcoming, fun atmosphere.  I don't know if it's the preferred place to bring children because it has more of a loud bar atmosphere, but it's great if you're looking to meet friends and you don't mind the noise level. I noticed it became louder while we were there (6-8pm) and it did cater to a boisterous happy hour crowd. I can see how this place would do very very well near a college campus (several locations are near colleges). It just feels very trendy, a little hipster, and someplace that the bar crowd would feel right at home.  But let's get to the food! I was shocked that chips and salsa didn't come with our meal automatically: this is officially the first American-Mexican restaurant I've ever been to that didn't serve chips and salsa right off the bad. We did order some and they were tasty. The Pennsyltucky fried tofu was delicious and I highly recommend it to start as your appetizer.  So what's your pleasure? Enchiladas, burritos, fajitas, chimichangas: if the patrons at my table were of any authority, then it's all great! It sounds like you can modify just about anything, so talk to your server. Speaking of servers, the customer service was great and that in itself can make or break a dining experience for me.  By the way, I was so excited to find that there is a Mad Mex in Columbus, which is where I live. Excuse me, I have to go there NOW. If it's anything like the Robinson location, then I'll be a regular as much as I can be."}
{"text":"Service was good.  Environment was great.  Thats about it. Food only resembled mexican in namesake.  Ive had mexican in Mexico, and ive hadgood mexican in the states...  hell, ive even had good tex mex...  this was nobe of the above.  The spice combos made the food taste spoiled...  disappointed to say the least."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. The food was wonderful great tasting! The salsa is AMAZING! I will be going back. An the staff is very friendly!"}
{"text":"It is Saturday night, I am hungry and I am sitting here wishing I could head to Mad Mex.  We used to live close to Mad Mex Robinson and it was our go to place when we wanted good reliable food and beer in a relaxing atmosphere.  As others have mentioned the food isn't authentic Mexican but it is delicious and fresh.    They have great vegetarian/vegan options too.  The chick pea chili burrito is an all time favorite.  The salsas and guacamole are flavorful and fresh.  Have I mentioned the beer?  They always have a wide array of seasonal beers on tap and if you get there during Happy Hour even better.    Viva Mad Mex!"}
{"text":"I was torn as to how low to rate our experience at Mad Mex. I'd say this place certainly falls somewhere between 2 or 3 stars. Here's why...  Food: The food here is average (at best). We both ordered the \"Mad Mex\" quesadillas. I've had better quesadillas from Chili's. I actually even make a better quesadilla at home. We both agreed that it was just subpar. The real irony here is that you'd expect a menu item named after the actual restaurant to be superior in quality to the other menu options. Correct? The quesadillas here are just blah and as for the guacamole, I've had equally as good from Trader Joe's. They come with no sides, so expect to pay around $2 for about 4oz. of canned black beans.   Service: So we stopped in over the weekend and ordered dinner. We stood at the hostess station for about 5 minutes patiently waiting for a hostess to appear. She never did. We finally walked to the bar and the kind bartender apologized and explained that things were slow, so they'd just sent home the hostess. Okay that's fine, but why not have the servers or someone else lookout for potential customers? Silly error.  We requested to be seated on the patio. It was night time, but boy was it dark! I'm talking parking lot lights to read the menu dark! Here's a tip...Get some light so that customers can actually read the menu at night or just close the patio altogether after dark. I probably would have ordered more if I could have actually seen the menu.  Let there be light.  Our waitress kindly informed us that the kitchen was taking last call on orders and would be closing an hour before close of business. Fine. Restaurant hours are listed for close at 1am and we arrived 11:30. We understand that kitchens typically close early, but we were clearly being rushed to hurry up and pick something. Again, I would have liked to get an appetizer and dessert, but felt pressed for time. Lastly, as if the aforementioned wasn't enough, the waitress was apathetic. Just bad.   Bottom Line: I wouldn't go here again. Food is average (or slightly below) and the service is lacking. There are far too many better restaurants in the area with higher quality standards."}
{"text":"We were seated at a high-top on the patio. It was probably 10 minutes before a server informed us that our server would be right over. Wasnt her table so, who cares I guess. No drink menus and I went back inside the restaurant to get our silverware from behind the host stand.  The queso/cheese dip had that off-color look as if it came from out of a can. I pictured them scraping it out of a can and mixing with their canned rotell tomatoes. And it didn't taste good. They never said it would be fresh though. I had the steak fajitas which were good enough and cooked how I wanted. The drink menu said Dos Equis Special. They should specify if that is that lager or amber. I'll still go to the location in Shadyside for drinks."}
{"text":"Ariba, Ariba! - I think I am going to need to work out more...  I went there for lunch with a group.   I remember in C-bus - their appetizers (wings) were really good.  I ordered the Chicken Chimichanga - it was yummy.   The meal was not loaded wtih shredded chicken but grilled chicken.  I will definitely go there again.  I don't know if there is a low calorie meal here but really don't care - it was that good :-)  Food - Yummy! Service - Great! Price - Lunch - $12 - $15   I will definitely go there again and try some other dishes fellow yelpers recommend."}
{"text":"Pretty cool ambience when you walk in. Very clean  and cool vibe. Love the art work and decorations. The food was awesome and so was the service. A little late with the food but I'm sure it wasn't his fault. I'd come back again or try another chain for the other Mexican entrees."}
{"text":"I've been going to Mad Mex for so many years. Everything is delicious, funky, and fresh. The Super Mad Mex Enchilada is my favorite (it has spicy spinach and chickpea chili), and the tacos and fajitas are tasty. Guacamole tastes wonderful, since it is always fresh and has a unique taste. For gluten and dairy sensitive people like me, there is non-dairy cheese and sour cream and corn tortillas. They even have non-dairy ranch for the wings! The staff is friendly and the food is consistently spot-on. I have all good things to say about Mad Mex!!"}
{"text":"I love Mad Mex but on several occasions now their Sunday night bartender has been just terrible. Before we moved a little farther away from the Robinson location we always had exceptional service from Heath and Lucy. This other guy just does not seem to care about the customers at all. His timing is terrible, he isn't friendly and he never has remembered us despite having seen our faces at the bar many times now. I've always enjoyed the food at Mad Mex and their rotating list of craft beer is exceptional. I will definitely return but I would not recommend visiting the bar on a Sunday night."}
{"text":"I usually never give bad reviews but I had to here. First time ever to a Mad Mex and the food I got was terrible, flavorless and tasted a couple days old. I was hoping to ask for some salt to add to it so I could eat some of it but my waitress was nowhere in site. After a good 20 minutes after bringing us our food she finally comes over asks if I need a box for my untouched plate. By this time I just wanted to pay and leave so I could try and get some dinner somewhere else before it got late so I said no thank you, it wasn't that good and she goes ok and quickly disappears before I could ask for the check, and is gone again for another 20 mins. We had to ask another waitress to find her so we could get our check. She comes back a little upset and asks \"were you guys looking for me?\" We just ask for our check. She leaves without a word, sets it down without a word and doesn't come back so we ended up just having to leave cash and walking out of there.   For me, if service is bad but the food is really good I'll still come back to a place because good tasting food is more important in my opinion. But this all around was a shit show. Maybe I'll try a different location, but I will definitely not be coming back to this one."}
{"text":"This was another Yelp recommended stop. The food comes out quick in almost all Mexican restaurants but it took quite some time for us at this place. The dining room wasn't even full which was odd. Food was really good though so that made up for it."}
{"text":"Best in pittsburgh for mex burritos. The wing-o-rito is amazing when you can't decide between wings and a burrito. I'll be back mad mex!"}
{"text":"I used to be a prep cook at the one in Oakland. The food quality has declined somewhat in the last decade but I was very impressed with knowledge of beer that everyone who works there seems to have. I hope the leftovers are as good as I remember. Cold MM burritos used to be one of my favorite breakfasts!"}
{"text":"I crave this place when I'm in SWFL, and it's always on the top of my list when we come back to Pittsburgh. The wing-o-rito in a bowl done buffalo wild is my go to here. I'm not certain that I've ordered anything else in years. It's the perfect amount of spice, and usually enough food for two meals for me.   They have great happy hour specials here and their servers are always very friendly. It amazes me that most times the servers don't write a single thing down but they've always gotten it right.  I wish their chips and salsa were included though like other Mexican places around town. I love their hipster vibe and they've picked great locations around town. You won't go wrong here in my book."}
{"text":"This is a better location that others. I always have Tofu Tacos and my mom enjoyed the chicken quesadilla. Large portions, so wasn't able to finish.   The only issue with this location, is its very hard and confusing on how to get there. You see this tiny sign and then you have to turn left through other cars backed up at a light."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Mad Mex, not only because of the delicious food, but also due to the great selection of beers on tap. It's a bit on the expensive side for Mexican food, but you do seem to get a lot for your money, and I've never been disappointed coming here.   I have had the burritos (spicy chicken is good), the chimichanga, and the wings, all were great, and tasted even better after supplementing the food with a delicious IPA or a 'Big-Azz' margarita (strawberry is my go-to). There house salsa is good in my opinion, but not for those with an aversion to cilantro. The 'fire roasted' salsa wasn't so great and tasted like the house salsa with way too much liquid smoke added.   The best time to go is probably for the happy hour and the late night half-off deals. Mad Mex isn't anything outstanding and certainly isn't 'authentic Mexican,' but if you find yourself tired of the same old Chipotle/Qdoba burritos, Mad Mex is a nice, tasty (albeit more expensive) change of pace.   Come for the burritos, stay because you can't legally drive after your Big-Azz margarita."}
{"text":"The enchiladas with portobello mushrooms are to die for!  The atmosphere of the place is real nice, service could use a little touch to match how great everything else is but I wouldn't complain and will come back."}
{"text":"The margaritas were great, but oh my gosh let me warn you do not get the vegetarian taquitos. They were basically mashed potato mini burritos. I'm still having nightmares about them. Thankfully the trio of dips was great to save it from being a bad food experience."}
{"text":"I work locally at a hotel, so I work late.  I've come here about a half hour before close sometimes and the bar staff has always been really nice and friendly and never make you feel unwelcome.  One of the best bartenders they have, is Lucy.  She is fun, funny, friendly, and makes you fee like you are part of the family.  The food is always awesome, the margaritas phenomenal, and the cherry on top is definitely having Lucy as a bartender!"}
{"text":"This review is just based on the beer since I didn't eat, but I was very pleased they had two IPAs on special, 22 oz for $5 and they were solid beers.  And this was 11pm on a weeknight, not any sort of happy hour special."}
{"text":"First time visiting Madmex. I was very excited because my wife and I absolutely love Mexican food and were interested at what this place has to offer. The place was semi busy and we were seated right away. The waitress we had was very kind.  She said she was newer and think that she did a wonderful job. The big problem I had was the food. My mind is telling me I should of had the burrito ,but I was very hungry and decided to get the chicken and steak fajitas with extra shrimp added on. The portion of food that I got was laughable. I could fill 3 small tortilla shells with everything I got. I paid 23 dollars and definitely was not worth it. My wife got the mahi tacos and had to return them because they were unedable. The fish was so charred and smelled. Our waitress took those off menu for us. ALSO got the chips with 3 dips.. sides were pretty good and chips did not taste too fresh. Drinks were great.  But after spending so much money im not sure if I would return or not,,especially with amazing Mexican restaurants near by."}
{"text":"Staffing problems.  Was told 45 min. to an hour.  An hour and 45 min later the hostess told us it would probably be another 45 min. after we were seated before we had food.  Somebody from management should have stepped up to explain the situation instead of leaving it to the hostesses."}
{"text":"Thank goodness I don't live too close, or I'd be 500 pounds. The food, the ambiance, the drinks, top notch. Mad Mex could be my absolute favorite restaurant.  Get the black bean dip, it is delicious."}
{"text":"This place is awesome."}
{"text":"Interesting.    My husband and I use this word frequently between us to describe something that we either can't quite grasp the concept of, or as a euphemism for \"this is quite possibly the worst thing we've ever experienced\".  In this case, I think that the use of the word may come to mean both when it comes to Mad Mex.  We had high hopes for this place after reading the Yelp reviews.  Unfortunately, the experience started off on the wrong foot almost immediately - we walked in and were kept waiting for nearly ten minutes while the hostess did - well, I don't know what she was doing.  My husband later said that she was checking for tables, but seeing that the place was half-empty when we walked in, that's kind of hard for me to believe.  To the staff's credit, several people did stop and ask us if we were being helped.  But, still.  We were led to a table and were about to sit down when one of the staff was like, \"No, don't sit down.  It's not clean.\"  And... yeah, no, it wasn't clean.  Spilled drink everywhere.  Not earth-shattering.  But, still....  Finally we're settled in and the server comes up and takes our orders.  She asks us if we want to keep the menus over dinner and I said, sure, we may want something else.  Thing is, she asks us this several times over the course of the night.  Did she forget she'd asked the question or something?  I just found that really odd.  I ordered a Thai Curry burrito, and my husband ordered a Mad Mex Quesadilla plate.  Maybe these were just the wrong things to order, I don't know - but in my case, the Thai ingredients just did NOT fit into the scheme of things.  Peanuts, pineapple and bean sprouts wrapped into a tortilla?  Uh... somehow the taste of this should have been a LOT better, and it sounded a whole hell of a lot better than it actually was.  The sour cream and diced tomatoes that came alongside was just a bizarre addition to what I already considered a bizarre dish.  And the slaw?  Ye Gods, that was just an abomination.  I took one bite of that and left the rest behind, and if I leave any type of cole slaw behind, you KNOW it's bad.    My husband's dish was lacking cheese.  And I mean, it was a SERIOUS lack of cheese.  More veggies than anything else, which is fine, but a good quesadilla has cheese in it, folks.  He did like his food a LOT better than I did mine, though.  Another service misstep - I wasn't asked what kind of filling I wanted in my dish (even though the menu states that there's a choice).  The server came back and asked me almost timidly if chicken was okay - it leads me to believe that the food was already made with chicken in it and she was hoping (or praying) that I wouldn't choose something else.  Luckily for her... I like chicken.   We didn't need those menus after all, because we beat feet out of there.  I knew I wasn't going to want anything else.  I tipped way more than I should have, to be honest, but the quality of the food isn't the server's fault.    I will say that the food choices are... well, interesting.  There are a LOT of vegetarian and vegan options, which I guess for some is a plus - points for the fact that neither dish was overly greasy or even heavy on the stomach, which can be a problem with a lot of Mexican food.  I went in knowing that this wasn't going to be authentic, and I never expected it - but it really shouldn't be THIS \"health-conscious\", and that's the feeling I got when I came in here.  We don't live in the area, so it's highly doubtful that we'll be back, but if we did live here, we most likely wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"Excellent service.  We (two adults and a teen and tween) shared two orders of chicken fajitas and it was just enough.  The atmosphere is a just *a speck* too loud and bar-like but not totally over-the-top.  The food was very good.  LOVE the salsa.  The fajitas had a little too much oregano (not even sure I'm a fan of oregano on fajitas) but were still very good.  Good value, price-wise.  There's a PokéStop right outside the front door!"}
{"text":"Maaad mex! I loved living in West side of Allegheny county for about 2 years... it was absolutely awesome! One of my favorite things was all the restaurants crowded around the shopping center that was right beside my house... unfortunately being a 22-24 year old I was, I also wanted to hang out with young folk and kick back/chill and there wasn't too much of that going on the Robinson area, but mad mex was always an exception.   Quality Mexican food - square burritos(get the mad mex)  and spicy queso with great brews and wonderful ambience for the win every time. Top it off with great service with nice bartenders and servers and you have a local favorite (I know , it's a chain- BUT ITS AN AWESOME CHAIN). Loved coming here whether it was with friends or my parents mad mex was open late and was always a good time.   Will return I'm sure..."}
{"text":"I'm a huge Big Burrito fan, especially the Mad Mex branches.  I've been to the one in Greentree, Oakland, East Liberty, McKnight and now this one!  In my experience they have all been consistent in terms of the quality of food and service.    I love me some wing-o-rito (southwestern sauce please) with waffle fries.  I recently discovered you can get a tofu burrito with the same options of wing sauces - score!  The location of this place is interesting - it seems a bit removed but maybe it seems that way because I'm not from the Robinson area.  In any case it wasn't difficult to get to and parking was plentiful on the evenings I've been there."}
{"text":"Never got.the chance to try anything. Waited on a table for one for over 30 minutes than after I sit at my table for 15 minutes with no waiter I just left and went to eat somewhere else. Drove up from Oklahoma and the place looked neat. To bad the lack of service and the wait kills the atmosphere"}
{"text":"The darkest restaurant I've been in, and we went during the day. Food was pretty bad, use to love this place and unfortunately it's not good anymore. I ate here with three other people and no one could finish their meal it was that bad. We also all tried a margarita and it tasted very fake and syrupy."}
{"text":"I grabbed lunch here with my mom the other day and had a good time here.  We wanted to get our grub on before getting our shop on at the Tanger Outlets.  The restaurant had a cool vibe.  I liked the interior mucho, ha!  See what I did there? *cheesy grin*  ANYWHO, we ended up ordering the Dance Marathon Enchilada (w/ chicken, spinach, and portabella mushroom) and the Kristy's Big Sister's Red Velvet Quesadilla (chicken, grilled zucchini, spinach, pico de gallo and jack cheese).  Oh, and I say \"we\" because my mom and I always split our food!    Let's start with the good.  The quesadilla was AWESOME!  Pipin' hot and perfectly cooked.  I also LOVED the side of guac that accompanied the dish - probably the best guac I've had in years.  FYI: it was a lunch special ($9.50) so it came with soup - you can also get salad if you wants.  We went with the turkey chili, and it was RIDICULOUSLY tasty - lots of hearty filling with BAMF heat.    Unfortunately, my Enchilada was \"meh\".  I feel bad because it was mad fresh with tons of grilled chicken and veggies, but it was tasteless.  I had a really rough time finishing it.  The beans and rice that came with it were even worse - pretty sure the rice was old because  It was hard and dry.  CONCLUSION: I'd definitely come back for the Quesadilla lunch special!  I'd also be down to try the Fajitas out, but I won't be getting the Enchiladas anytime soon. Also, the happy hour seemed legit!  Might be back to check that out with frands! Who knows..."}
{"text":"I love all the Mad Mex locations, this one included.  The food is great and consistent between locations.  They are more than happy to substitute the meat in non-vegetarian items with tofu whenever I ask, even though it's not stated in the menu that they will do this.  That means big bonus points for me!!  There is no shortage of veggie-friendly menu items, but any time I have made a special request it has been honored without question.    This location seems to have more craft beer on tap than some of the others (namely Oakland).  That's great too!  There's really nothing I DON'T love about Mad Mex, it's probably my favorite restaurant in the 'burgh."}
{"text":"As a lover of all things Mexican (although Mad Mex puts it's own twist on Mexican), I can't believe I've waited so long to give Mad Mex a try. My boyfriend and I have adopted more vegan meals into our diet lately, and we were in search of a restaurant that our non-vegan friends would enjoy, too. Mad Mex's family environment and vegan menu items fit the bill for what we were in search of, and it was a great first experience at their Robinson location.  For starters, we got the classic guac and salsa and our friends got the queso. The menu says that Mad Mex's style is \"Cali-Mex,\" which from my own taste buds seems to combine Asian fusion with classic Mexican cuisine. I ordered the tofu tacos that came with beans and rice, but I subbed out the regular sour cream for vegan sour cream. I was SO pumped to see they had vegan sour cream, because no one likes dry, boring tacos! My boyfriend got the tofu and portobello fajitas, and since his meal came with cheese he subbed that out for the vegan Daiya cheese, too.  I wasn't sure what to expect from a tofu taco, but the bean sprouts, sauces, and crispiness of the tofu blew my expectations out of the water. The tofu was marinated in Mad Mex's citrusy-ginger-soy sauce and it was FULL of amazing flavors. Anyone that has worked with tofu knows that the challenge lies in getting the tofu to soak up and retain flavor so it isn't bland, and Mad Mex mastered this skill with their tofu tacos. I would order these 1000 times. The vegan sour cream was just icing on the cake at this point.  While to tofu in my tacos was out of this world, I was a little unimpressed with my boyfriend's fajitas. The tofu looked like it wasn't marinated or flavored, and after ordering the waitress came back and said the fajita sauce isn't vegan. At first there was no substitute offered for the sauce, but my boyfriend just asked for a cup of the sauce that my tofu was in to add some jazz to an otherwise plain dish. I was glad to hear him say the veggies gave it some flavor, because tofu without sauce is definitely not the most exciting thing to eat.  Overall, the menu substitutions made all the difference for us. It's not easy to find a good restaurant that satisfies both plant-based eaters and those with a traditional diet, and Mad Mex made that whole situation a lot less stressful. The food was good, prices were fair, and service was quick. We'll be back again, and next time I'll be sure to indulge in a margarita (or a few!)"}
{"text":"Big Burrito is a well respected restaurant group, but this location damages it's reputation tremendously. The food is less than acceptable, the draft beer is warm, flat, and the overflow makes for a sticky drinking hand because no bar nap is supplied. This place would provide great material for the writers at SNL."}
{"text":"I have now been to Mad Mex twice, both with disappointing results.  Mad Mex is about authentic as Taco Bell, that's not a complaint - I just want anyone else reading these reviews should realize this is not true Mexican food. However, they DON'T try to be and are in your face about it which I like. It pisses me off more to fake something and do it poorly than to take parts of it and do it well.  I like the theme and design of the restaurant, the rusted steel plates, cowboy/Inca art motifs, its obviously a fun atmosphere and they have done a great job and spent a lot of money in design. Perhaps they should spend some of that money in training their servers. One of the servers knowledge of the food was pretty bad, I asked three simple questions about menu items and only 1 could be answered. The two she couldn't answer there was no attempt to find out - a simple \"I don't know\" seemed as an acceptable answer. However, the server we had on another visit was much better.  For starters we have tried the pepito hummus - great idea, but salty, very very salty, the other starter I've tired is the chicken tortilla soup - the soup was good even though there was not one piece of chicken in it. It's definitely not a traditional tortilla soup instead you have rustic cream of tomato soup with garlic, cumin and other spices. As I said not traditional - good - very mild flavor, it could have used a little bit more spiciness and of course the chicken the menu proclaimed it had.  I have read and was told that their burritos were very good so the first time I tried Chicken Fajita Burrito. These are knife and fork burritos that come out square. On the side is Pico de Gallo, which in my case was warm, contained the tomato core and was flavorless. My burrito contained bland rice, unseasoned black beans, red and green bell peppers and onions - some burnt, cheese and chicken. I guess the idea was to throw the bell peppers and onions in and viola you have fajita style, unfortunately it had no fajita seasoning so it didn't really work. There was a  nice smoky flavor to the chicken which helped. But overall this burrito needed some serious help - it was bland on the flavors, even the addition of salt would have helped it out. One last comment is the tortilla that was used, a quick trip on the griddle was needed or maybe finish the tortilla in a press but it came out very white, with a doughy almost uncooked flavor.  On the second visit my partner had the Mad Mex burrito with steak and was very disappointed, he thought they had forgot to put the steak in it until the very end he found 4 pieces of meat in the very corner of the square-itto. Until then he was just eathing plain rice and beans - not good.   On the second visit I tried the Dance Marathon enchilada and this resembled and tasted very little like a true enchilada. All they did was put a very small ladle of ancho sauce on the plate, then put on the chicken spinach and mushrooms and top that with tomatillo sauce. Then throw a tortilla on top. Put the required rice and beans on the plate and you have a rather poorly executed and plain tasting dish of food.  Mad Mex looks like a great place to enjoy some drinks, but if what I had was representative of the rest of the  menu offerings I would pass on eating there again - food was very under par and someone should tell them that Mexican foods carry bold flavors - they should at least try to add some of those flavors to what they serve.  Ambiance 5 stars Food 1.5 Stars Service 2.5 Stars  3 Stars and that's only because I really liked the ambiance."}
{"text":"Did you know Mad Mex has a rewards program??  They do!  For my birthday, I got to create my own amazing burrito...for FREE!!  It sounds easy, but there was much coaching by Heath, Dr Margarita, for both my burrito and margarita.  He was a fantastic bartender and the food was even better!"}
{"text":"More like BAD Mex! We dined here yesterday on our way to the airport. Our waitress was average and forgettable but she did keep our glasses full when needed. She didn't really check in with us after our meals were served otherwise she would have learned that I HATED my food. It's rare that I encounter food I don't like but the chicken mole burrito I had was terrible. They melted the cotija cheese on top which is usually a fresh crumbled cheese. The smell was so off-putting that I couldn't even eat my meal. Maybe it was bad or something!? The waitress could've asked why I didn't eat but she didn't seem to care or maybe she just wasn't paying attention. I took a bite of the hubs carnita tacos. They weren't too bad which is why I gave this place an extra star.   The restaurant wasn't really clean. It smelled like it was wiped down with a dirty rag or something. Right outside the restroom area was a dustpan full of dirt and grimy litter from the floors. Just looking at it made me nauseous. Made me wonder what kind of condition the kitchen was in but I'd rather not think about it.   Won't be back. Spent $50 on apps and food that I didn't touch. Yeah- Bad Mex!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Big Burrito restaurants but service here at this location stinks. It's 9:00 on a Thursday night and half dead and the waitperson (plus trainee) took ten minutes before they asked if I wanted a drink, and then didn't bring a food menu. After another five minutes I had to ask for a menu and then it was another fifteen minutes before anyone came to take my order. When I pointed out that the wait was unreasonable, the trainer was rude and said \"why didn't you just flag me down?\" Is that my job, as a patron?!? Also, you can't flag someone down who is nowhere to be found. Lame. Post-script; my food just arrived and the server just shoved it in front of me, and said nothing. Literally nothing. Not \"can I get you anything else?\" Not \"sorry for your wait.\" Absolutely nothing. I will never come back to this location and might need to swear off Big Burrito properties more generally. Totally unacceptable."}
{"text":"This is by far one of my favorites in the area and it keeps me coming back time and time again. I know it is not authentic Mexican by any means but they have a very interesting spin on Mexican food. My go to is the wing o rito with buffalo sauce. What's not to love when you are mixing buffalo sauce and a burrito together?! With that said there is plenty of other great items on the menu such as a carnitas quesadilla, carnitas burrito, fish tacos, tortilla soup. AND the famous gobblerito that makes an appearance around thanksgiving each year. Personally I wish they had it year round because it's that good. It sounds slightly gross on paper mixing your entire thanksgiving meal up in a burrito but I promise it is good. I will say if you are someone who doesn't like their foods touching then this probably isn't the burrito for you. The salsa is also one of my favorite restaurant salsas. I like that it's not a runny salsa. It is definitely worth paying for in my opinion.  Now on to my favorite item...the margaritas. I'm not sure what they put in these margaritas but let me just say my friends and I don't call them suicide margaritas for no reason. $10 for a big azz margarita may sound like a lot but you will feel good after 1. They also change their specialty flavor each month. They have flavors such as cranberry apple cider, apple cider, watermelon, banana, strawberry banana, and passion fruit just to name a few. At this point I think I've tried them all and they are all amazing. The sangria blur is a personal favorite from the regular menu.   I would also like to comment on the staff that works at this location. Each waiter/waitress that I've had over the years has always been pleasant and very nice. Some of the staff behind the bar have been there for years and you can just tell they love their job. They are always checking on you and asking if you need anything. Lucy and Heath are always being friendly with each of the customers and anytime I go there and don't see them I'm a little bummed. This location is by far my favorite."}
{"text":"Stopped on my way home from the airport to miss the rush hour traffic.  Fantastic idea!!!  Tried something different tonight - a seasonal menu item - Dynamite Shrimp Tacos!!! Three tacos with shrimp, slice of avocado, zesty mayonnaise, and asparagus (I got mine without the asparagus).  It came with rice and black beans.  Also some sour cream and guacamole.  Absolutely wonderful.  Light, tasty, and perfect portion.  Sorry I didn't stop to take a photo - I just dug right in :)"}
{"text":"3 things i miss most about pittsburgh (in no particular order):  1. Family 2. primanti bros 3. MAD MEX!!!  this place is so delicious it really doesn't even make sense... between the food and the margaritas, mad mex can do no wrong... they really cater to vegetarians, and are willing to make most things on the menu vegan if you ask (but there are plenty of options for the meat eaters as well)... usually when I go back to visit family, I hit up the Oakland mad mex once, and then the robinson location the next day (my mom lives way out in Robinson, so we go together)... I love that this location has the same happy hour specials as Oakland (see below), but without the crowds and the long wait times... AND this location is about 4x the size of Oakland... all-in-all, it's just great... 5 stars!!  Specials: Weekdays from 5 - 7 - $7 big azz margaritas (they really are HUGE) - $3 for 12oz margaritas - $5 for 16oz margaritas - Half off all drafts and wings  Everyone night from 10 - midnight - $7 big azz margaritas   p.s. try the blue cornbread!!"}
{"text":"This is not the typical Mexican place to eat, so if you think your going to Mexican family run place like most, then you will be caught off guard. no free chips and salsa.   the burrito I had  was huge! and had an excellent flavor. the salsa on the side was perfect for me however the person i was with said it was too hot for them.  really interesting atmosphere, Will go again!!"}
{"text":"Mad Mex is always good when you're in town. It's my favourite Mexican place in Pittsburgh -- they actually have quite a bit of spice in their food. Plus they are a sports bar as well.  This time, we started with 3 dips. While all of them are good, the black bean salsa is hands down, the best. Sadly though, my chickpea chili burrito was mostly bland. I blame it on my [temporarily] vegetarian diet, and the lack of ingredients in that burrito other than chili. I miss their chicken.  The waitress was unbelievably good. She wasn't intrusive, but somehow was always there even before we realized we needed her. If only all waitresses are like her..."}
{"text":"I love most of the Mad Mex locations that I've tried.  This one is close to lots of shopping.  I loved their Horny Toad Margarita, which unfortunately is no longer on the menu.  But if you get an old timer, they'll still make it for you.  The closest thing to the Horny Toad is the Ultimate.  If you like a wicked sour margarita, this is the one for you.  I'm not a fan of the big azz margaritas that are popular there, they're  just too sweet for me.  The red sangria rocks!!  There's always and awesome selection of drafts and bottled beers too.  I like this location because it's really small and really dark.  I know that's not a plus for lots of people, but I like it.  I love the Insane San Francisco Wings with Blue Cheese.  We always order them well done.  Insane is the highest on their heat scale, the heat level isn't consistent, but it's usually pretty hot.  The blue cheese is a perfect balance to the garlicy San Francisco sauce.  My husband almost always gets the Chicken Chimichanga, its generously stuffed with tasty chicken, it's always nice and crispy.  I love most of the quesadillas and fajitas... but I think my favorite entree is the Dance Marathon Enchiladas.  I love the garlicy portabello mushrooms and spicy spinach.  The tortilla soup is thick and creamy and so good.  The casa salad is awesome with the Lime Cilantro dressing.  A garlicy spicy creamy pesto-type dressing that is also great to add as a dipping sauce for quesadillas and taquitos.   The salad is a simple combination of leaf lettuce, cherry tomatoes, red onions, blue cheese crumbles, green pepitas... the crunchy pepitas with the salty, tangy blue cheese topped with lime cilantro dressing... YUM!!!!  One of my favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"I've always liked the Mad Mex chain but I would have to say I like this location the most. The service is always excellent and it has more of a restaurant feel than the other locations that are more bar oriented. The cranberry margarita flavor they've add for November is very good if you like a sweeter margarita. The Fajita Burrita was also great with some added queso inside. The one thing I wouldn't recommend is  nacho appetizer as all the toppings are piled on top with nothing on the chips underneath."}
{"text":"We were heading to IKEA to a couch. It was raining and we were hungry so we decided to stop in for a warm bite. The decor is a quirky mix of Mexican, with skulls, weirdly designed animals and cacti.  I ordered a cup of tortilla soup and a chicken quesadilla. My spouse ordered a cup of black bean soup and a chicken burrito. My soup was warm and filling. It had chunks of grilled chicken and some shredded cheese on top. It was the perfect texture with just a little kick. My quesadilla was crispy on the outside and filled to the brim with chunks of grilled chicken, onions, green peppers and cheese. The peppers had been roasted which added flavor. The quesadilla comes with salsa and sour cream but I ordered guacamole too. Yum! My husband's black bean soup was a little plain even though it came with a dollop of sour cream. It could have used a bit of spicyness. His burrito had chunks of grilled chicken, rice, and black beans. Unfortunately it was light on the chicken and heavy on the rice and beans. The burrito also comes with salsa.and sour cream but he too, added guacamole.  It was a nice warm meal on a rainy day."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times and each time has been great.  The guacamole is great and I highly recommend the Margarita.  Last time I had Fajitas and thought they were above average.  Tonight I got the carnitas burrito and it was superb."}
{"text":"Go for their halt hour. Their draft beers,wings, and margaritas are hals off.  The beer selection is above par and you can walk out of there with a low bill (during happy hour )"}
{"text":"OK, MAYBE I am bias, but the grilled fish taco here are amazingly consistent. heavenly!!  WHY do you make them so fabulous ????    What is your secret ?? They are disgustingly addicting, and I will go to my grave saying Mad Mex Grilled fish tacos are superior!!!  I have tasted the same from Mexico, (west & east)  Baja, Barbados, Belize and still...... Mad Mex gets it a good as good gets in the US!!!  I run my own business and I take Mad Mex Mahi Take out as a tip !!!!"}
{"text":"Very consistent place for lunch or dinner. Great tequila and microbrew selections. Staff is also excellent."}
{"text":"Mad Mex was really good. The food tasted nice and didn't make you feel gross after eating. The service was very good and the atmosphere was upbeat and busy. The portion sizes are decent - I took a good amount home for left overs. Not the best Mexican food I've ever had but is good."}
{"text":"Went solo for Friday dinner at the recommendation of many who knew I was interested in some Mexican food. After finally locating the place (a bit of an odd location that lacks good visibility) I was promptly seated at a bar-side high top that afforded a good view of the Pirates/Rockies broadcast. The server (B. Starkey) visited me quickly and was friendly/helpful throughout the meal.  I'm getting old and was quickly reminded of that depressing fact as I struggled a bit attempting to read the menu. With nothing unusual or surprising offered I went with the Chicken Fajita ($14). The order arrived in less than 15 minutes. All ingredients were tasty (while the chicken portion seemed a bit stingy)and I found myself eating the nicely seasoned veggies at meal's end.   My only issue was that cleanliness seemed to be a factor. My table was sticky and the restroom needed work (even considering the place was relatively busy). Mad Mex would certainly be a better location with a group but I would visit the next time visiting Pittsburgh. Give it a try...but come with a group and a pocket flashlight!"}
{"text":"Screw my GPS for hating the location of this place, because I loved it! The greeters are ambitious to put on welcoming smiles, and the atmosphere provides a great social experience. I ordered the Spicy Chicken Burrito, and it was stupendous. It was the size of a Jumbotron! They have the best televisions I have ever seen, but the Pens lost to the NJ Devils whenever I was there. Their water tastes like expired battery acid. Great food, and even better date nights!"}
{"text":"My friend was visiting from Texas and we wanted margaritas and quesadillas before we went shopping at the mall. Our experience wasn't awful, but I doubt I'd visit the restaurant again. They charge $3,75 if you want chips and salsa. Also, service was pretty slow. Finally, the margaritas we had were 12oz but they charged us over $6 which we felt was pricey. It wasn't the worst restaurant I've eaten at, but I feel there is better food in the city."}
{"text":"I am in love with their Elotes.   It is a corn-on-the-cob seasonal specialty which means my heart will break in the Fall, but in the meantime my love and I will be happy one  grilled, seasoned and cheese-covered ear at a time.  I could have eaten a dozen ears (and perhaps should have instead of venturing into loaded nachos territory... they're perfectly respectable as nachos go but - oh the Elotes!  Mi Amore!  At least when the Elotes leave me I will have vats of Big Azz Margaritas in which to drown my sorrow.  Darn good for the size/price and the bartenders take custom requests - my 3rd was a 12-oz in a 22-oz glass with a nice blast of soda water so I could still function to get abck to my hotel."}
{"text":"I live in California, and every time I'm here (twice a year or so) I try to stop in and get some awesome Mad Mex on my way back to the airport. It's tasty, filling, fresh, spicy, and the service is always super awesome. I've hit up some of the other locations too (like Oakland) and they're also great.  It's not really the same as you get at taquerias in California, but that's cool. It's more inspired by it. Mad Mex does their own thing, and they get it right."}
{"text":"My favorite chain restaurant in the Pittsburgh area!  Fun happy hour atmosphere, and phenomenal hugely portioned meals!  If you are looking for Jose's $0.75 tacos, this is not your place.  The food is a delicious modernized fresh twist on Mexican cuisine.  With so many Mexican restaurants popping up in the Robinson area, this one still takes the crown.  Oh, and the beer game is on fleek.  Lots of IPAs on draft at all times.  Don't like beer?  Try out the seasonal marg.  My fav is and always will be their fall apple cider option.  Bartenders are the bomb.com!  Tips: Vegans and meat-eaters alike, try the black bean chili! MMMMmmmm"}
{"text":"Very so-so.  Reminds me of the \"On The Border\" places all over DC.   Sauce on the enchiladas was more like tomato sauce.  Rice was a hard.  Plus, $13 for an enchilada is a bit steep."}
{"text":"Kay and I were here last weekend for 'nother taste 'o Mex.   The complimentary chips 'n salsa were so plentiful, we didn't need a starter. The chips were deadly perfect; the salsa deadly spicy, chunky and loudly colorful, and vibrantly flavorful.  My Skewered Jumbo Shrimp Fajitas were a tremendous union of garlic, olive oil, and seafood, the fat shrimp bursting in my mouth upon each tear of the teeth.   I'll also add that the rice was light, fluffly, and much better overall than last time.   What's causin' all this? Mad Mex."}
{"text":"I love all of Mad Mex's locations because of all of the vegan options, but this location really took the cake for me today!! My boyfriend and I went to a concert and got absolutely soaked in the rain. We came to Mad Mex for a snack, and saw that they sold t-shirts, and thought it would be a good idea to buy some to dry off and warm up. The manager gave us our tees for free!!! This is a restaurant that really cares about their customers, and they really made my night :) food was excellent as expected and our waiter was quick and attentive"}
{"text":"Definitely a go-to for me when I am in the mood for some huge portions of Tex-Mex and a bunch of alcohol.   My absolute go to when I come is the Carnitas Burrito (Pork slow-roasted in garlic, ancho chili and Dos Equis. Roasted green chilis inside, blue cornbread, pico and sweet-n-sour slaw on the side). The pork is ALWAYS tender and juicy and that slaw just does something to this dish that I can not explain. The cornbread is always welcomed as it is usually warm and fresh. Plus, it's such a big portion that I can usually get about four meals out of it.  For dessert, we usually get the chocolate brownie to share. It is definitely one of those things that you have to share. A huge brownie, four scoops of ice cream and a bunch of whipped cream. Pretty much heaven in a dish. I'm not sure what the deal is with the ice cream, but its definitely better than any vanilla ice cream that I have ever had.   The margaritas are to die for. I can easily finish a few Big Azz margs without even thinking about it (though it really isn't a good idea!)   The service is always exceptional. The staff is always so attentive, even on a very busy night. I definitely would recommend this location if you are in the area."}
{"text":"This place is insanely hard to find. But the food was decent, nothing amazing. Seemingly reliable Texmex in an area that doesn't have much of that type."}
{"text":"I joined Yelp purely to express I hate Mad Mex food, lol. The name is pretty appropriate, MAD Mex. If you want Mexican food for cheesie, sour creamy, refried bean goodness, do Not go to a Mad Mex. I searched entire menu. It is all super health conscious, very fresh, steamed veggies, if not raw veggies. You find chunks of zuchinni, strips of corn off cob in your burrito. I think I found a couple green beans in my burrito. Maybe some cucumber. Why not? Their black beans are steamed.  If you are doing the health conscious, lookin good, diet, go to a Mad Mex. I did see their bar before. If you are a drinker, you will like their bar.  But if you like Tasty Mexican food, pass on Mad Mex. Go to Jose & Tonys or Taco Bell."}
{"text":"I've been a Mad Mex fan for years. Since college, I've not met a Mad Mex I didn't like. You can't go wrong with \"Big Azz\" margaritas and doesn't-make-you-sick, Americanized Mexican food. I frequent the Robinson location regularly, as I both work and also also live nearby. Lunches with co-workers, happy hours, date nights and dinner and drinks with friends have always been hosted at Mad Mex, with delicious drinks, boneless wings, pick-a-dippa, and decent, but not-delicious meals.   Throughout the years, I've seen several families inside the restaurant. A children's' menu, high chairs, and a dark, loud restaurant made Mad Mex our first choice for dining when our friends came into town. (You see, they have a toddler and I have an infant, plus there aren't a whole lot of non-chain restaurants in the area.)   We walked in at 5:20pm on a Saturday evening and asked for a table for 4 with two high chairs; we were seated at a booth and given only one high chair, as policy prohibits flipping the chairs upside down to accommodate an infant carrier (annoying, but....fine...whatever.) We were given 3 adult menus for 4 adults (?) and a children's menu and crayons for the toddler. The high chair was FILTHY! As my friend cleaned it for her toddler, the waitress greeted us and proceeded to tell us that most people don't bring their kids to the restaurant. We instantly felt embarrassed for bringing our families and unwelcome.   Despite our less-than-desirable greeting, we decided to stay. Margaritas, tortilla chips, guacamole and salsa were happily devoured. As usual, the dinners were just okay, boasting uncooked vegetables in the BARErito (think burrito bowl) and fajitas and undercooked blue cornbread, served with the enchiladas.  While the toddler seemed to enjoy her quesadilla, brownie and ice cream from the kids' menu, we will likely not return to Mad Mex, by choice - certainly not as a family - after being made to feel unwelcome.   Oh, and by the way, I counted 8 young children in high chairs on the floor and spotted two families with carriers waiting to be seated. I hope their experience was better than ours."}
{"text":"The food and service here was amazing! We dined  with them this afternoon and accidentally left an envelope of cash on the table. We called the restaurant and spoke with the manager, Jeff. With the help of multiple busboys, Jeff personally saw to it that every inch of the restaurant- including the dumpster- was searched. Thankfully they located our envelope! We are so grateful to Jeff and his staff for their professionalism, honesty, and kindness. They went above and beyond and I can't speak highly enough of their dedication to phenomenal customer service!"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE Mexican food but have consistently been disappointed by this place. My boyfriend and I have been here multiple times to give it another chance and won't be going back. Their salsa is more like dried up marinara sauce than salsa, and their tacos have come out to us multiple times lukewarm. The only redeeming aspect for me is the margarita but when we went and sat at the bar (there were only 3 other people sitting there and it was not busy at all) it took FOREVER for the bartender to come take our orders and even then, he didn't make the drink I asked for."}
{"text":"We tried Mad Mex for our 1st time today and at first glance if the menu I thought great freakin Tofu on the menu, I looked up and yep it said Mexican food so I'm thinking this is not my kinda place. So wrong the freakin Mahi tacos are killer. Wife had grilled chicken tacos and ditto. And try the XX cheese dip it is great just the right amount of bite."}
{"text":"Nice place to hang out for a drink. Very friendly crowd. Food was only so so. Guacamole was brown and should not have been served. Bonus star for for being a relatively cool place in the Suburbs (with a capital S) and for being open late on a Sunday night.  I would go again but would eat elsewhere first."}
{"text":"Good service and very good food! Very accommodating to our large group including pleasantly offering to print out separate checks."}
{"text":"always good beer and great staff of very fun people. food is fast and filling. best late night grub and that lunch that leads to happy hour is a very good time"}
{"text":"I'm beginning to think that whatever Mad Mex I dine at, I'm going to get great service, great food, and a great atmosphere to enjoy it in.  My friend from Columbus was in today to get ready for a job interview tomorrow, he's worked at OSU for years and he wants to teach at CMU. So after he checked in he phoned me and we met at Mad Mex in Robinson.  He gushed about the Mad Mex that recently opened in The Gateway on High St. in Columbus, saying it was one of the hottest restaurants in all of Columbus, and how lucky we are here to have one close to every neighborhood. I ordered the Mission Shipwrecked Double IPA and he had Rogue John John Dead Guy Heller Bock.   Our waitress was so understanding, we decided to enjoy our beers before ordering, and she said \"Sure, enjoy, I'll come back and take your orders when ready.\" So we talked, caught up and enjoyed our libations. Finally I got hungry (and a little buzzed from drinking a double IPA with a specific 12% alcohol listing), I ordered the black bean soup, and Happy Hippy burrito. He had the Mad Mex Burrito with steak and said it was every bit as good, if not better than the Mad Mex in Columbus.  Sure, it's not authentic, it's Cali-Mex, it's fresh, healthy, and I'm sure glad we have the Big Burrito group here in the Burgh!"}
{"text":"I moved away from the area over a decade ago, and this is still my favorite place to eat when I visit home. The food is clean and pretty much everything other than the chimichangas can be made in a healthy manner. Mad Mex is conscientious of and caters to all diets and allergies. As a vegetarian, I have always been able to enjoy a healthy, filling, delicious meal. There are numerous options, and they will modify everything to accommodate your dietary needs. The portions are generous, so you can enjoy leftovers the next day. The salsa is made fresh daily, and you can taste the difference. Someone posted negative comments about their sour cream. It is pure sour cream without the chemicals and preservatives you're served elsewhere, so if you don't like it, you probably don't truly like sour cream. If you want fresh, spicy, delicious food, with a fun atmosphere and an alternating array of craft brews, you'll love Mad Mex!"}
{"text":"Bland, imo. Have eaten at Mad Mex at least a dozen times with a friend who loves the place. Tried everything from tacos to enchiladas and burritos. It all tastes the same and in some cases looks the same. Another corporate restaurant offering big food that's better marketed than prepared."}
{"text":"Mad Mex is one of my favorite restaurants when we are home.  If you are looking for classic Mexican cuisine, this is not the place.  But if you're looking for a tasty meal at a reasonable price, it is a great spot.  The food is a mix of Californian with some Mexican and Asian thrown in.  Sounds weird.  It is...but it really works.  If you are a vegetarian or vegan (I'm not), I would think that this would be a great place as many of my favorites here are meatless.  They have a lot of beers on tap that rotate."}
{"text":"I've been to Mad Mex dozens of times and I've never had a bad experience! If you're looking for a place that offers great food, great drinks, great service, all thrown together in a lively environment, this Mad Mex will do it for you!  In this adventure, I tried their drink special for the day which happened to be the bomb banana slammin' margarita. It was like slipping on a banana peel and falling in love! I also had the tortilla soup and potato taquitos. Both were just equally delicious.   One of the things I love about Mad Mex is their menu options. They have a wide variety of options that will suit a variety of appetites."}
{"text":"Very average food. The waitress suggested any of the \"wing-o\" options so both me and my husband got the wing-o tacos but in different flavors. He got the BBQ flavor and was better and I had the California one that was not good at all. Very odd flavor. Spicy but there was supposed to be some sort of honey hint but you can't taste any sweetness. Also, they are literally a flour taco shell, some lettuce, and a wing on it. No sauce, or slaw, or any other additional flavor level. I only give this place 3 stars because the waffle fries were really good. I would suggest getting anything else if you come here."}
{"text":"I have been to the Mad Mex in Shadyside many times, but I had not been to the Mad Mex in Robinson until last week, and I ended up going twice! I went for Happy Hour one day, and the it was a great crowd. They have a nice selection of beers on draft, and have an IPA week coming up (not sure what that means exactly, but I am excited for it nonetheless...). Good Happy Hours are hard to find these days, Happy Hour there is exactly that - good deals on beer, drinks, and appetizers. We had the trio of dips - the jalepeno pinapple is my new favorite!  On Sunday I picked a friend up from the airport and we wanted to find somewhere we could eat and watch the Superbowl, and this was the perfect spot for that. It wasn't overly crowded like many of the sports bars, and once again our waitress was super friendly. I had a margarita and the shrimp taquitos - both were very good. I'm not sure I would use the word \"authentic\" but as long as it tastes good, I don't really care."}
{"text":"My husband and I love going to Mad Mex! We normally go to the one on McKnight Road, but we recently moved and have been frequenting the Robinson location. I almost yelped a not so good review last week when we were there, but I didn't thinking they were just having an off day. Tonight was even worse than the last time. Our waitress took an extremely long time to get to us, hardly ever checked in, never brought us napkins (our 5 year old is messy) no straws, the glass that my husband's margarita came in was so disgusting. I'm not OCD about stuff like that but you could clearly see something stuck to many different spots on the inside of the glass.   On a positive note, the food was great as always. I love Mad Mex, but their service makes me not want to go back. :("}
{"text":"Lots of vegetarian options which is great. Good happy hour drink specials and food prices are comparable to other restaurants in the area. The portions are huge and their birthday club is great, when you sign up they mail you a postcard for a free burrito anytime during the two week span around your birthday."}
{"text":"This is our usual hangout. Love it! The service is always prompt, and the food is consistently awesome. Occasionally, the bar area gets crowded, but that's a sign of a great establishment, right?"}
{"text":"Service was great! Atmosphere was family friendly. This was not mexican food at all. I couldn't even finish my enchilada. The margaritas were not up to par and I could only take a few sips. I had higher hopes from reading other reviews, but I will never go back."}
{"text":"This place lives up to it's name. The pictures on the walls are bizarre but in a good way. I got a corn on the cob for an appetizer and it was really good. Then I got a chicken burrito. The food was all-around good. Just don't go here if you like basic, boring food. Very interesting place"}
{"text":"Our experience was so good because our waitress was amazing. We had a large group of 25 and she made sure we were all taken care of. They were featuring a beer from flying dog and had a special for $5 22oz of 8% beer. It was bomb to say the least. The food although was mediocre."}
{"text":"Best. People. On. The. Planet. Ever.   True. Story.    I don't know where to begin.  My love affair with Mad Mex Robinson is a long & complicated relationship that is difficult to explain in such limited wording. But tonight represents it nicely.  Mr.Toddler & I dined w the grandparents & Uncle.  From the excellent personalized greeting from Dan, who was busy with tending bar, &  to the manager stopping to check on the table despite the rush- the individual people make this location stand out as special.   During the hubbub Mr Toddler had a meltdown because he recognized the kids dessert bowl and one was accidentally brought to the table and almost set down. It was meant for elsewhere. Mad Mex is so nice that when he recognized it, they sent him his own complimentary kids brownie sundae for their mistake but without the ice cream that he doesn't eat the other one had. And trust me.  He enjoyed every single bite of the brownie, fudge, & whipped cream.  He gave it five \"yums\"   But this what really showed that they care about customers. We forgot Mr. Toddlers best friend behind on the floor. His stuffed dog.  When I realized this at bedtime- the hight of business on a Friday night, not only had he been set aside with care but he was brought out to the car so Mr.Toddler wouldn't have to get out of his car seat! That's a team who really gets & cares about their regulars.    So ya, you can choose any Mad Mex in the area. The menus are the same.  The foods a personal presence of you like Cali-MEX. Its certainly not Authentic Mexican food. Don't try to fool yourself into thinking it is. But it's certainly extremely tasty American Mex.  Like, REALLy Really good. Drink the ranch dressing good. In fact, Mr. Toddler pretty much just uses the chips as a vessel to scoop the dressing into his mouth.   We tend to order the same items often. The kids quesadilla, adult chicken fajita, chicken quesadilla, or enchilada.   I love it all.    And when it comes to choosing a location, I think Robinson is hands down hitting way above the highest mark!"}
