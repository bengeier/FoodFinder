{"text":"Meh. That's generally how I feel about this place.

Customer Service:
I was considering giving it a 2-star rating. But their counter service really was above par. And many of the customers appeared to be on a first name basis with staff. 

Food:
Meh. Definitely wasn't bad or anything. But I didn't feel the urge to write home about it. They have a choice between halibut and haddock (I think it was haddock...) - chose the halibut as my fam prefers that. Was decent, but wasn't excited about the batter crust... A bit too bland/heavy deep fried oil tasting. I couldn't finish my portion - and my capacity for eating deep fried food could be likened to a middle aged man with cholesterol problems stranded on a deserted island. Even my dude friends can attest to this.

Ambiance:
Did take-out, but it's small so I got a good idea. Wall-to-wall tapestries of different townships in the UK, as well as random international locations. Appears to be a spot for \"regulars\" more than the drop-in type. Very casual.

Price:
I admit I over-ordered for our group of three, and that had an effect on the price. Buuut - and maybe I'm crazy (wouldn't be a new notion) - it seemed pricier than one would expect for fish 'n chips. Just sayin'.

Trying out other fish 'n chips places in P-town - if we don't find better, I guess we'll go back out of lack of selection."}
{"text":"My favourite fish and chips place for sure. It's so fresh and just...wonderful! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Solid fish and chips. Not oily! Quick service. Prices are about $1-1.50 more than what is posted on photo of menu here."}
{"text":"Great place for fish and chips. Nicely battered, freshly fried, juicy fish. What more could you ask for. We had the platter to try the shrimp and scallops as well and both were excellent as well. Definitely recommended if you're in the mood for fish and chips in Pickering!"}
{"text":"This place has the best fish and chips I've had in a very long time.  The staff are great and Jenny (the owner) makes sure to welcome you by name!  We always have the halibut and the fish does not disappoint.  A large piece that is lightly battered.  (Now there's a switch as usually you get tons of batter and a tiny bit of fish).  The chips are great too!    We usually get ours to go."}
{"text":"Had lunch here yesterday, fish nice and crispy, but did lack a bit of flavor. And yes it was a bit pricey for the quantity of food.  Staff friendly and quick service."}
{"text":"My friend took me here when she had a craving for fish and chips one evening. I usually go to a place down the street for me so I thought it would be good to try a different place. The inside of this place was interesting to look around while we dined in.There were a few other people dining in, but mostly take out orders for the night.

I got the Halibut and onion rings. The fish was pretty good, a very light a crispy batter. The onion rings were nothing special. I would come back if I was in the area, but mostly I'll stick to my usual spot because I like the batter they use better, as well as their chips with gravy."}
{"text":"In our never ending quest for delicious lunch items, we finally got around to to this little fish and chips joint.  Its a humble little restaurant in Pickering, with a few tables and takeout.  We phoned in our order to take back to the office and voila, ready on time and waiting for us when we got there.  I ordered the one piece of Halibut and 1/2 order of chips.  The portion is generous enough that was enough to satisfy me for lunch.  Everything was certainly fresh, and definitely tasty.  The fish was light, the batter was crisp, the oil used to cook it must be very clean because it not soggy at all and was very well prepared.  I would love to come back here again.  Next time i think maybe we will eat in just for a change of scenery.  I'm a fan of this place now."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Generous portions of fish and hand cut thick fries is well worth the visit and it's always tasty.  The staff there is very friendly and always polite.  Always a pleasant visit."}
{"text":"Fish and chips are always fresh and tasty. Service is decent and prices are average. This tiny restaurant is tucked into a strip plaza and would be missed if you did not know about it. It is worth a visit."}
{"text":"Really good fish and chips! smaller portions it seemed like and it would of been nice to have some coslaw"}
{"text":"A family favourite for many years.  Light & crispy batter on their fish.  Generous portions.  Friendly service.  The seating area is simple chip shop decor.  Don't visit if you're looking for ambiance!  But the food is great & that's why we keep going back."}
{"text":"Great food and service! If you are in Pickering and want fish and chips, this is the place."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try out this place for awhile now, tried it out on Friday as I had a huge craving for fish and chips.  
My husband and I ordered the halibut and chips, son ordered the shrimp. Food was very good. The fish was nicely battered and not greasy at all, crispy and super nice.  The fries were chunky and delicious.
The service was very good, maybe a little too quick.  We ordered, eat and were out of there is less than 1/2 hour.  Only complaint was the price for the portions received.  Total bill for two pieces of (small portion) fish and fries, plus 6 fried shrimp, one coke and one hot tea was over 45$
We would consider going back but will not make it a regular spot due to the price, on the other hand,  as I prefer to give my business to local mom and pop joints I'm sure we'll come back semi-soon!"}
{"text":"This is the greatest place to enjoy the perfect battered halibut fish and chips. Great portions with thick crispy fries. The owners are the friendliest people and I've loved this place for years."}
{"text":"A simple diner yet the seafood is excellent quality.  Had the Halibut fish and chips. Fish was firm and fresh. I even forgot to use a lemon wedge because it really didn't need much additional seasoning to make it taste better.

I especially like coming here because the batter isn't thick. You won't get a mouthful of deep fried batter and fish isn't mushy.  The fish is still juicy, batter is light and crisp.  

Just writing this review about it makes me hungry again.  I'd definitely will be willing to drive out to Whitby from North York for a good meal such as this occasionally or stop here on along my way to and from road trips."}
