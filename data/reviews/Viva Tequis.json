{"text":"Went in for a late lunch. I am in need of healthier options so I asked the front counter lady and she was incredibly helpful and kind. I wish I got her name now. She suggested the shrimp tacos and said the tropical guacamole was popular.

Sat down and was attended to by a very courteous young man. Received my guacamole first. It was amazing. The mango, yuca and plantain chips were such a wonderful surprise. Guac had just the right amount of spice but with 3 other spicy salsas to choose from....I was in heaven. Received my one shrimp taco and I cannot compliment it enough. The corn tortilla was like no other corn tortilla I have ever had. Shrimp was perfectly cooked, the \"slaw\" type mixture inside (unsure what you'd call it) was so complimentary. I had told the young man and the young lady (both came to check on me separately) how wonderful and fresh everything was and how I may have to get another taco. The young man offered to place the order for me as well.

I really cannot brag enough about how fresh every single thing was and nice the employees were. It's sort of what I've been looking for in a food establishment and I plan on coming back again and again to try everything out!! And yes, I'll definitely be bringing anyone that will come with me! If not, I'll go alone again!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped in for the first time yesterday. Off the bat I had a good feeling, the interior is very stylish and welcoming. I got two tacos, al pastor and carne asada, and he got a carne asada burrito. We also got the chorizo queso. Everything was delicious!! They make their own corn tortillas as well. And it was about 20 bucks with a sweet tea. The service was friendly and prompt! I believe it is recent to open, more people should go check it out and support new business in downtown! We also got some traditional guacamole to go as well, and it was just as delicious."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff!! The food and ambience are worth it alone, but it's so nice to have a friendly environment as well. The pork carnita and fish tacos are so good!"}
{"text":"Ordered for the first time tonight. Food was great. I had the chicken bowl, fried pintos, and chips and salsa. Husband had the steak bowl without cheese sauce. Will definitely order again in the future. My husband said the inside of restaurant was nice and roomy."}
{"text":"Phenomenal food all around. Chips - Fresh, Chicken - Fresh and even the guacamole, kiss ya mama - FRESH!! Definitely make a stop for great food at a great price"}
{"text":"Excellent fresh Mexican food, got our order to go and all stayed hot and delicious.  Not on menu, but today they had fresh tasty chicken soup with chunks of carrots, rice, shredded white chicken and chunks of corn.  Soup was a perfect size to share.  The street corn was grilled with char marks, the elote was DELICIOUS.  Tacos are reasonably priced and taco carnitos was gull of meat and garnished with cilantro, went with no onions.   They have beers and margaritas with a cute inside dining area.  Staff is super helpful and friendly.  Yummy!!!"}
{"text":"AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I came last night and came back today for lunch. I'll be back again before I head back to Florida."}
{"text":"I picked this taqueria based on the Yelp recommendations and was not disappointed.  The restaurant is clean and we'll decorated.  The staff are very friendly.  I started with the steak salad and was very impressed.  The meat was perfectly  done and the greens light and fresh. I got their 'Rosita' margarita,  delicious.  I met the owner and he recommended I try their tacos since that is their specialty.  WOW! I've had A LOT of Mexican food and these were the best tacos I've ever had.  The meat was juicy and flavorful.  The salsas delicious with just the right amount of heat. I wouldn't bother with any other Mexican food in town,  in the state, maybe in the US.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"My friend and I just got food at Viva Tequis and it was out of this world. We love eating their as always."}
{"text":"Found my new favorite authentic Mexican Restaurant! The food was FRESH and awesome! The staff was also Great"}
{"text":"New name, new style but still the same great food!!!! This use to be the old Tequila's spot. If you loved Tequila's, you'll love this too. And don't worry, the other Tequila's location in Gastonia is still the same. I wanted some chips and salsa so I ran by here after getting a mani and pain and I was pleasantly surprised at the change and new concept of the fast casual dining. I think it works better for this location."}
{"text":"First time here and it was amazing. I will definitely be back. The guacamole was my favorite. Also loved the tomatillo/jalape√±o sauce"}
{"text":"Overpriced especially compared to price when it was Tequilas.  Food did have good flavor."}
{"text":"Better than the other Mexican options in Gastonia. And they offer vegetarian options. Worth a try."}
{"text":"The is without a doubt the best Mexican/taqueria restaurant in the area. The wife and I love to stop in and get a guacamole to start with and some tacos for our entree! So excited to have a place like this close by!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing and delicious. We were visiting for a wedding and we r foodies and always looking for good eats. This was one of those places. The employees were very attentive and friendly"}
{"text":"Very good food! I wish the salsa was complimentary though. It can be a bit pricey. I usually get the chicken bowl, but I recommend getting the queso on the side because they will drown your food in it. The staff is very friendly.  Good atmosphere."}
{"text":"They tacos are really small I would of went to Taco Bell if I knew that and the ppl who work their are kinda stuck up I probably what even be going back I like to feel at home when I'm out with my kids"}
{"text":"Small menu, terrible pricing and options. Just trying to get salso at 8oz. for $4 made me wonder what the He11 was going on. 
The food I had I had to pick from what they had instead of what I wanted. 
I was pissed about the salsa not being part of the meal, so I got Jolopeno Queso dip, which was runny melted store bought and way over priced. The steak burrito I had was mostly rice, and some semi-touch stringy meat i could not ID as steak. I'm guessing brisket or flank.
The truth is, I had a water I took in, I paid $13 plus tip to go to a counter and order what I had to pick from and then find out I had driven out of my way to force feed myself and embarrassing myself by having people meet  me there saying I heard it was awesome.
Salsaritas KILLS THIS PLACE in value, quality and selection. PERIOD
Don't wast e your money"}
{"text":"We went here looking for a quick afternoon bite and drink. Service was great, food was better. We had steak tacos and they had a torts special that was good. My margarita was awesome as well."}
{"text":"This place was amazing!! The food was great ! I ordered 3 tacos, steak, chorizo, and spicy pork
And the roasted corn all were amazing delicious! I am here for work and will definitely be returning this week for more! The Jose Cuervo margarita was amazing too!"}
{"text":"Awesome Mexican food in Gastonia 
Friendly staff 
Great place for lunch 
Loved the Quesadilla"}
{"text":"Me and the wife went on a date night here and I have to say, it was awesome! Great food, atmosphere and staff!! Definitely going to be our new taco spot!!"}
{"text":"I ran across this spot looking for street tacos- made my husband take me for my birthday dinner!!! IT WAS DELICIOUS!!!!!!! We ordered a lot (and took a lot home) just to try out a few different items- I got carne Asada tacos- he ordered chicken tacos- we had chips and salsa with southwestern guacamole! The elote (grilled corn) was not only beautiful but just as delicious! The carne Asada bowl was full of rice, veggies and cheese sauce topped with mouthwatering steak!!!! Everyone in the place stopped and talked to us (our 1 year old waved to everyone) and expressed how much they enjoyed it! Waitstaff was super nice and overall we had a great experience!!! We will definitely have to go back and make that a regular date night!"}
{"text":"Omg they have the best tacos I ever had in my life I loved it!!! And they are so nice and sexy men too  the drinks are the bomb"}
{"text":"Doesn't get any better if you're looking for authentic Tex-Mex. Meals are fresh, made-to-order, and the service is timely if you are rushed for lunch. This joint doesn't have the extensive menu of other area Mexican restaurants, but that's what makes it SO GOOD...they do a few things and do them incredibly well, and you come up with the variations. You can't beat the Daily Deals or the $2.50 tacos! Outstanding, fresh, made-to-your-liking Guacamole that satisfies the mildest to the hottest palate. Filling, tasty, affordable, fun, clean, buzzing atmosphere. There's a small area for outdoor dining at the rear of the restaurant. Full bar with fantastic Margaritas and Happy Hour specials. Summertime brings music to the downtown pavilion and this spot is in the heart of the fun."}
{"text":"Everything was good.  Burrito al pastor.  Some gristle but overall pretty good.  Sauces great.  Will definitely go back try more."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!

Authentic and properly priced street tacos which can be ordered in a range of traditional protein configurations including pollo asado, carne asada, carnitas, al pastor, camarones, barbacoa, etc. There are also a couple of neat less-common options like nopales (cactus) and calabazita guisada (zucchini). The tortillas are hand made corn, mmmmmmm.

We also had he traditional guacamole which rivaled my wife's and of you'd had my wife's guacamole you'd know that was a legit compliment. We added the queso which you can also get with add-ins like chorizo or poblano peppers. We had Be latter and it was KILLER.

The fire-roasted corn on the cob is an elote lover's dream. Absolutely delicious.

I had the al pastor, carne asada and camarones tacos. They were each wonderful. I had one small issue with a shrimp that hadn't been properly cleaned (not an issue on my wife's order so an honest overlook) which the staff fixed promptly and courteously.

I will be back tomorrow and the next day and probably the day after that.

Hurry up and get over here."}
{"text":"This place is perfect for a quick bit or a casual dinner. They have all the classics on the menus like burritos, tacos and quesadillas. They also have a great variety of unique guacamole's. When we got our food they also offered three different salsas on squeeze bottles. One was a mild green then a classic red and finally a spicy jalape√±o. You order at the counter and then they bring the food out to you. The interior is simple tables and benches against the wall. In the back they have a bar and I want to go back to try their margaritas. 

I had a pork burrito and it had rice and beans with onions and cilantro inside. It was huge and tasty. I could also see the chief in the back cooking the meat. My boyfriend got a steak quesadilla and had zero complaint. It was super nice that it came with pick de Gallo and sour cream on the side. We drank water but it was nice to see they have the new fancy coke fountains that lets you select a lot of options. 

I will be back for sure. The staff was super friendly and helpful. And the food was perfect."}
{"text":"Great shrimp tacos and fresh guacamole! The corn tortillas were excellent. I saw good reviews of this place online and it did not disappoint."}
{"text":"Tried today for the first time - I had the chicken bowl and my husband had the steak quesadilla and a corn on the cob side. We shared the traditional guacamole. I also had a margarita. Everything was fresh and delicious . This is a place where you walk up to the Counter and order and they bring your food out to you.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I had two tacos, shrimp and el pastor both of which were delicious. My wife had carnitas tacos which were also very good. The queso and guacamole were great with fresh chips. I was so happy to find this location on our trip to Charlotte."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for guacamole and this tropical guac is giving me life. It's as if baby Jesus himself made this guacamole. There's a perfect balance between the sweetness of the pineapple, spice, and your traditional fresh guac taste...it won't let you down. I didn't take a picture of it because I practically inhaled it because of how good it was. The light guac is like a traditional guac but instead of chips it's veggies, which is also pretty tasty, but I'd prefer the tropical. 

Along with the guac, I got a fish taco, which I also loved! It appears as if the fish was VERY lightly breaded. I usually don't like breaded fish, but this was not noticeable at all. The fish has amazing flavor along with the pico de gallo, and I highly recommend pairing it with their jalape√±o sauce. You best believe I got another order of this and took it home for dinner. 

The overall ambience of this location is great! Modern, with an industrial twist and very clean! The staff is also very friendly (Yesenia was the cashier at the moment of our arrival). This would be a great place to come to with friends and family."}
{"text":"I'm so stoked to have finally found a place that tastes like real California Mexican! The hibiscus drink is bomb, the veggie tacos are bomb, the service is super efficient and kind, I can't wait to go back and try more stuff on the menu. Also have you ever been somewhere, where they have a dedicated guacamole menu?!?!? Well they do, and it's AMAZING"}
{"text":"Holy cow y'all!!! This place is absolutely amazing! Everything from service to food and decor is perfect. I can't believe I am just now finding this place! I ordered three tacos: carnitas, carne Asada and pollo asada. AMAZEBALLS. My boyfriend had a carnitas burrito and he said it was the best he ever had! We also ordered the kiss ya momma guacamole and it was PERFECT! I feel bad I didn't catch the dude at the counters name, but he was so nice and helpful. It always makes for a better visit when you receive that type of service. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"After moving to the area a couple months ago, my fianc√© and I had been looking for a good Mexican restaurant. This place has more than fit the bill. We ordered way more food then we would on a normal trip but we wanted to sample multiple things. We ordered the kiss your mama guac, poblano queso, grilled corn, steak quesadilla and 2 steak tacos. (I only got a picture of the queso and guac) Everything was excellent and made fresh. I watched the guacamole being made right after ordering it. The queso was also delicious. A meal could be made with just those 2 items. The steak in the tacos and quesadilla was also grilled fresh upon ordering and it did not disappoint. If you're looking for good Mexican, I highly recommend this place. 

Almost forgot, the margaritas were also delicious!"}
{"text":"This is the ONLY Mexican joint you should go to in Gastonia. 

They have the staples: Street Tacos, Salsas, Elotes, Plantains, Tortas and Guacamole, etc. I love the \"al la cart menu\"/cantina. It gives you an opportunity to try something new and not be stuck in a \"meal\". They have a wide variety of meats (lengua, cactus, etc.) and guacamole's. Everyone that works there is so friendly and helpful. I am a Native Texan, where tacos are life and Viva Tequis is a weekly stop."}
{"text":"This is a different style of Mexican restaurant than most in Gastonia, it's more traditional so it may not suit everyone. My friends and I love it, though. The tacos are street tacos and are fresh and good. I had a burrito for the first time last night and it was great. We keep going back for the guacamole, though. It is the freshest guacamole, the ingredients taste of better quality than what you're usually served in a restaurant, even other restaurants tableside guacamole. It's a little pricey for portion sizes but the taste and quality more than make up for it. I also highly recommend the street corn. We have had nothing but great experiences at Viva Tequis!"}
{"text":"Simply the best Mexican we've ever had!!!! The owner of The Sleepy Poet antique store recommended it!!!
      Outstanding!!!"}
{"text":"There is so much to enjoy!  The shrimp tacos are wonderful, the al pastor burrito is always a delight, and the salad topped with grilled mushrooms was a lovely surprise.  This place is perfect for lunch because the staff is quick and attentive. I highly recommend this place for a casual group dinner."}
{"text":"Traveling from California for work related reasons and located this restaurant. Great choice. People were very pleasant and food was delicious."}
{"text":"First time eating here today.  The staff was super friendly and very attentive.  We ordered chips and salsa, a steak quesadilla and a chicken & steak rice bowl.  Everything was delicious and very fresh.  We'll definitely come back.  Nice addition to a sparse downtown Gastonia."}
{"text":"Loved the queso! I got 2 tacos, the pork and steak. Both were very good but the steak definitely needed some type of sauce on it. The queso with poblanos was my favorite!"}
{"text":"First time eating here.  Order taker very friendly and knowledgeable on the menu. Dinner specials reasonably priced. My shrimp bowl was ready in under 10 minutes. Great taste and lots of food for the money.  Yes, I will eat here again!"}
