{"text":"I signed up for yelp just to give this restaurant a good review. The service was great the food was awesome. I dread going to the chain Mexican restaurants when my wife says she is in the mood for Mexican. This place place will now be my go to Mexican restaurant. True authentic Mexican food. Do yourself a favor, skip the chains and go straight to this place."}
{"text":"This place is great, but VERY HARD TO FIND. Both Yelp and Google Maps don't know where it is and will send you on a wild goose chase.   HERE IS THE KEY: It is in a strip mall on Robinson Center DRIVE right next to THE EXCHANGE. Turn off Park Manor Drive into the parking lot for Joe's Crab Shack, then head to the north end of the strip mall.  We ended up driving around Robinson for 20 minutes, including 5 minutes after we spotted it but missed the turn. Worth the effort, but it can be easier if you know where it is! See that little map up there? That's not where it is. It's across the street from Buca Di Beppo, near the intersection with Robinson Town Centre Blvd."}
{"text":"Great place - completely authentic - carnitas were awesome - good guac and queso - skip the margaritas and stick with the Mexican cerveza - other chain Mexican places in Pittsburgh don't hold a candle to Jose.  The flan was one of the best we've ever tasted.  Seriously.  Good service too."}
{"text":"We've lived in Colorado, Tennessee, and North Carolina. While these places are extremely diverse, the one thing that they have in common is great Mexican food. Pittsburgh does not share this...with the exception of Jose Ole.  The food at Jose Ole is about as authentic as it gets. The enchilada sauce is always solid, the cheese dip is the right consistency and level of spiciness, the salsa is spot on, and the rest of the dishes continue to impress us. If you are vegetarian, note that their rice is cooked with chicken stock.   In the land where Mexican food forgot, Jose Ole is a shining oasis of goodness. It easily outshines every single one of the Mexican restaurants that Pittsburghers swear by and is thus definitely worth the trip to Robinson."}
{"text":"Oh dear I'm crushed!  This place had the absolute best crab quesadilla I have ever had and they were super cheap. But alas I had a craving for them and just went to find the place has gone out of business. Now what!  I guess the search is on for crab quesadilla.  Oh well it was good while it lasted.  See my new review of El Paso Mexican Grill yahoo got my crab quesadilla again"}
{"text":"I've been driving past Jose' Ole since it opened saying, \"I'm going to check that place out sometime soon.\" A good amount of time has passed it wasn't until tonight that I made the plunge with my lovely Yelp/life sidekick and I couldn't be happier that we did. Upon entering I was a little thrown off by their pint-sized hostess, but more than impressed with her ability to seat us. Hostessing doesn't seem like a hard job, but don't tell that to most hostesses in the country. What comes off as a favor from a condescending teen/twenty something instead became what it was meant to be; someone seating us so that we could be served food. If Jose Ole were on Restaurant Stakeout, Willie Deagle would be pointing out that this ten year old girl is ready for upper management.  The good service didn't stop once we were seated. Our server was on top of her game even with it being a good sized dinner rush. The manager also stopped by the table twice throughout our meal to make sure that everything was good.  One problem I have with most Mexican joints is the size of the menu. Being more than indecisive, dozens of options really slows me down and will almost undoubtedly be the reason my upcoming marriage will fall apart. The menu here is even bigger than most. They really could cut over half of it out and be alright. I ordered the Carnitas Chile Colorado and it was love at first bite. Along with the entree you get three tortillas, and after I finished mine off but had more delectable pork left on my plate, our server offered to get me more tortillas. Normally Rikki and I have a hard time keeping quiet when eating, but Jose Ole shut us up for a little bit as we quietly enjoyed our meals.  The food is great here, and they could easily get away with charging another dollar more an entree, but it's really the service that made me give it five stars. I'm rarely this impressed with how people treat their patrons anymore. Jose Ole does it right and that's more than likely how they survive in Robinson, which has more chain restaurants than you can shake a churro at."}
{"text":"This restaurant is tucked away in a small shopping plaza in Robinson, next to The Exchange and across from Bucca di Beppo and is very easy to miss.  If we hadn't been regular Exchange customers, we may have never even known this little restaurant existed.   The food is excellent, the service is great and very attentive.  I have tried both combination platters along with more authentic items and everything has been wonderful.  The restaurant itself seemed clean, open, and bright.  There seems to be a patio in the back that they may open up in warmer weather, though I cannot confirm this.    I really do hope they can stay afloat and catch on as Robinson is in dire need of some good ethnic dining options."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food you can get. This is the 1st time I have written a review BEFORE I finished eating! 5 stars and probably 6...."}
{"text":"Robinson Township lacks authenticity and solid non-chain options.  Thanks to Jose Ole we have a great local legit mexican place to visit.  Grab a pitcher of margaritas and some carnitas or tacos and enjoy"}
{"text":"This place is fun.    We checked out this place based on some of the comments.    The prices were reasonable.  The atmospher was okay - we were in a strip mall and the decor did not provide a lot of privacy and had a fast food feel (we were sitting in similar booths).  The Food - I ordered an appetizer - Shrimp Quesidilla and  their special which was a honey chipotle chicken served fajita style - served with beans, rice, and tortillas.   The meal was okay - not great but I should have ordered something off the menu to compare with other places.     I really liked my Shrimp Quesidilla.   I will definitely go back for that - I don' tknow why - it is just mexican cheese and shrimp but I think they do a great job on their shrimp (next meal I get will have shrimp in it).  I don't normally have a craving for shrimp ... but they do it right.  Price was pretty good - appetizer, meal, and a beer - $18  Summary:  Atmosphere - Okay - this is a place to take your pals - your company will be your atmosphere  Meal - Okay - but the appetizer is what I really liked and was the influencer for my rating.  Cost - Okay - it was comparable to the other Mexican Restaraunts in the area.  I will go back and try some fajitas or somethign."}
{"text":"As a transplant to Pittsburgh, I've noticed a lack of quality authentic Mexican food.  I was extremely fortunate to have stumbled upon this place.  This is comfort food.  All of the Chicken Dishes I've had have been excellent, as well as the Fajitas Vallartas.  The bang for your buck goes a long way here, especially with the Special Dinner which is somewhat of a sampler dish featuring a wide variety of favorites, including Chile Rellenos.   The staff is friendly, the prices are incredible, and the chips are always fresh.  I look forward to frequenting this establishment more often."}
{"text":"Jose Ole purports to be \"the Real Mexican Food.\" For the most part, I'd call it REAL quotidian. I apologize for not feeling JOMG (what an internet acronym!) like others are, but their food just didn't inspire me much.   I'm looking at their takeout menu as I write this, and it reads very much like El Paso's in Beaver Falls, suspiciously I might add.   I mean, even the food was very similar. Are we dealing with a chain that is trying to hide the fact that it is a chain? Who knows?  The salsa was only mildly spicy, tasted as if it had come from a jar, and was served in a carafe, JUST like El Paso Mexican Grill.   Now the guacamole wasn't bad and was admirably buttery, but it had the consistency of baby food, EXACTLY like EPMG's. I may not be an expert on Mexican cuisine, but I know that I prefer my guac to be chunky and fresh. This was neither.   The chips were great, however. Cornmeal-dusted and newly fried, they were just fine sans anything to dip them in.  The highlight of the meal: My entree, the Burrito Durango, the Omega of all the burritos on JOMG's bill of fare. A mammoth, foot long (no shit!) thunderbeast of a burrito, it was stuffed with a laundry list of items that included beans, rice, bell peppers, tomatoes, onions, chicken, shrimp, and beef strips. For overkill, this chupacabra de la cocina is then slathered in a tomatillo coulis, a melted white cheese that I couldn't quite identify, and red pepper flakes. The tortilla was a luxurious blanket fit for an infant king. A mad, decadent queen would bathe in the cheese, which I longed to have a crock full of for chip-dunking purposes. The proteins were all superbly cooked, but the shrimp was especially well-grilled and caramelized. The Durango is one steamin' mutha of a burrito that saved lunch for me.   Even the desserts were the same as those offered at EPMG. Hmmmm. Hell, they even had the very same vending machines!   Moment of cuteness: One of the young, elementary school-aged daughters served us our beverages when we sat down, went back to her laptop, downloaded \"We Will Rock You,\" and then sang along to it with another little girl at her side. Thankfully it wasn't Justin Bieber.   Unfortunately, she was the most personal employee in the house. The gentleman that served us during the bulk of our meal was curt, cold, and seemed to want all patrons out of the restaurant as soon as possible. He made zero eye contact with us the entire time, almost slid our entree plates onto our tables as he mumbled under his breath that they were too hot to touch, and didn't even ask us if we wanted dessert. Bad day? Did I give off a bad vibe? I couldn't tell ya. We were planning on going to Cold Stone afterwards anyway, so ay nimodos...  P.S. We found the restaurant with no distress thanks to the review put up by Todd S. Set your GPS for Buca Di Beppo's address. JOMG is right across the road in a shopping center. Now that's IF you want to go there, and I can't say completely recommend them. If it wasn't for the burrito, I'd have given JOMG a 2."}
{"text":"I find it odd that the first 3 reviews are not only 5 stars, but by those with zero friends and only 1 review - this one. I find that rather suspicious, but I digress.  I agree with fellow Yelpers that the decor leaves something to be desired, but that's ok. If the food and service are good, I don't mind it being a little bit of a dive.   The menu is extensive, which was both pleasing and overwhelming. After combing through it, I noticed that fish tacos were not on the menu. Bummer. I ended up with the honey-chipotle shrimp which comes with Spanish rice and re-fried beans. The dish is also served with warm tortillas. The shrimp tasted like it was pre-cooked and then later browned in a skillet and topped with sauce. This made the shrimp a bit tough and lacking in flavor. The sauce was tasty and had enough spice to be interesting. The Spanish rice and refried beans were typical - nothing special. The complementary chips and salsa were also unremarkable. The salsa was not fresh and seemed as if it came from a jar.   Mr. J had one of the lunch specials - Chicken Enchiladas. He was a bit disappoitned that it did not come with rice and beans, so he left somewhat hungry. The enchilada sauce tasted watered down and bland.   Service was prompt and friendly, so I feel somewhat guily for giving two stars. But the food reflects the star-rating - Meh. This may be considered authentic Mexican, but that by no means defines it as \"good\"."}
