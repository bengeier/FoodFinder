{"text":"Food is decent..I would give it a 3.5-4 out of 5. Wings are decent..AYCE is $13 (plus mandatory $3 drink) and you can change flavours every order. Your first order is 6 wings after that you get 4 and it's annoying waiting between orders.  It's what you expect from a Bar...greasy fries, old washrooms, and a big TV over the bar. A decent spot, but not worth getting excited over. Beware though..it's not free refills. I paid over 9$ for name brand coke.... Overall 2 of 5"}
{"text":"Went here on a friday night and was very disappointing as soon as we pulled up. We had a great coupon so I decided to give it a try regardless of what my spidey-sense was telling me. Wow this place looked like a seinor citizens club from the 70's. Its very clear that this place hasn't been changed since before the jays won the world series. walls are cluttered with old sports memorabilia purchased when Bi-Way was still around.  We decided on have wings, just the wings. Hot, Hot & honey garlic. They were large, but not that tasty, Meh. Nothing special at all they didn't even bother to do the basics well,  Half of my wings were half coated in my desired sauce. Its safe to say we wont be returning to this place. Now i know why there were 8 people in the bar, including staff and customers."}
{"text":"I had seen tons of signs around the local area promoting the \"all you can eat wings.\" I thought it was a great concept, I just never took the time to go check it out. One night the guys from work and I decided we would go for a beer & wings. $13 for the all you can eat wings, and we split a pitcher.  You pick your sauce and you start with 6 wings...........then slowly......... yep........ slowly they bring you refills of 4. They make you wait. No doubt part of the strategy, I assume they hope you get full waiting. Perhaps they think it will reduce waste. During our visit we got full while waiting and two us wasted 3 of the 4 wings each.  I think this is such a stupid practice.  (A) I'd never suggest anyone check it out!  So no good word of mouth coming from me (or anyone in my group).   (B) I'd certainly not rush to go back here, not now, possibly not ever.  During our visit I asked the lady if we could double our order,  I let her know I'd eat over 10 wings easily. I was told, \"no, other people are waiting.\" Like you cant drop more in the fryer ? The kicker, the place had two other tables of apx 3 people per table. So 9 people including my group. But again, this is what they make you do. Slow service hoping you get full. I guess they want your $13 and no repeat business.  Bar is dated and old looking, as I would suspect. Bathrooms were AWFUL.  To be fair I should add, the wings were decent in size. The sauces are just your local grocery store sauces. The wings are all cooked the same, then sauced in your pick. We tried the HOT - it was dusted with some odd spice, not good. The Bufalo wings we ok. The sweet chili reminds me of the PC sauce I buy from no frills, and the parm/garlic were decent.  All in all I would not go back. The expericne does not warrant another visit. The way in which they serve the customers is just off putting."}
