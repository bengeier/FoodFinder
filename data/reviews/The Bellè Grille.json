{"text":"Food was excellent. I had the firecracker shrimp with fried broccoli. Very impressive. I am planning to return to try something different but to also hear a music performance. Hear bands are also great!"}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've ever had. The Tilapia Alfredo was out of this world. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"I recently had Sunday brunch at The Belle Grille. I had the Shrimp and Grits, which was hands down the best Shrimp and Grits I have ever had. The also serve flavored mimosas. I had the Blueberry and Mint, which was delicious. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"We finally made it over to Belle Grille last night.  The place is casual and the food fantastic.  I had the barbeque turkey ribs and my husband had the crab cakes.  Both entrées were very good.  I couldn't imagine turkey ribs...but they were meaty and tasty and just fabulous.  Served with sweet potato casserole and fresh sautéed veggies...the sides were also very good.   We glanced over at a plate of chicken fingers at another table...it was HUGE!  We ended the meal with homemade apple pie and ice cream.  All in all, a very satisfying meal and great service too!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our meal here. Menu was different with a nice touch of southerness We shared an excellent crab cake appetizer. Chicken and waffle was best I've ever had and my wife loved her salmon BLT."}
{"text":"The alfredo was the best I ever had. The belle sampler was delicious! The owners come to your table to meet you and make sure everything is perfect. Our server, Walker, was spot on!"}
{"text":"Went to celebrate our anniversary.  Always went by this shopping center but never noticed this place.  Made reservations for dinner which I highly suggest given small restaurant space.

Live jazz was great!  Space is very inviting and staff great.

Fried broccoli was amazing with light tempura type batter.  Husband's pork chop was on the thin side and was slight dry.  He choice to substitute asparagus for steamed broccoli because of the appetizer but it was not a good choice.  My Belle alfredo was good with shrimp and chicken.  Side salad with good as well.

No offer of dessert was made so not sure it was available or just a busy night for them.  One family left after being seated because they felt like they had been forgotten when waiter didn't take order quick enough."}
{"text":"Great small local restaurant with soothing atmosphere, tasty food and good service.  I would consider the cuisine to be high-end mixed Southern/Soul/Cajun.  The owners are very friendly and councientous.  I highly recommend you trying the restaurant and what it offers out."}
{"text":"Good service good and friendly staff. The fries are tasty and never oily and the turkey burger is so delicious. Thank you."}
{"text":"This place is seriously sooo good!! Haven't bee disappointed yet. The service is great too, not something you see much anymore when you go out, a very genuine hospitality. Will definitely continue to go back!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. Great service! Food was impeccable! Great vibe! Definitely will be going back."}
{"text":"WhoHa!  Add the firecracker shrimp and the lobster mac and cheese side to my growing list of \"favorites\" at The Belle Grille.  They've now added fried green beans as an appetizer.  Haven't tried them, yet, since I still love the fried broccoli!  However, next time we stop for lunch or dinner I might just have to go \"out of the box\" and get more creative since everything at The Belle Grille is SOOOO very good!  Yummy, yummy, yummy!"}
{"text":"Hidden jewel of a restaurant across from the Siskey Y. They have great food, friendly staff, and reasonable prices. We've been their several times and love the Talapia Sandwich, Firecracker Shrimp on a Salad, and the Belle Wrap (is the best in Charlotte)! Their Parmesan Fries are the tasiest ever! A great new restauant for Matthews and Weddington.

{"text":"As always the food was excellent and the staff is top notch. Great environment for a family or a couple. The turkey burger is delicious and the drinks are \"real\"! Great people in that place."}
{"text":"I feel that the 4.5 star overall review was a little misleading. We chose to go here for our monthly \"date night\" on a Friday night and were pretty disappointed. It took about 10-15 minutes to get our drinks after we ordered them. We tried the fried broccoli per Yelp recommendations and thought it was pretty good. I ordered the chicken marsala for my entree and it was chicken with all cooked onions - no mushrooms at all (it was the weirdest thing, and super disappointing!) My husband ordered the crab cakes and thought they were great (they were recommended by waitress.) I guess I was a little disappointed by the ambiance as well - I knew it was in a strip mall so expected that \"feel\" but the wait staff were all in casual daytime outfits, jeans and casual tops, etc. I think having a dress code for wait staff would go a long way. It just felt super casual and not special. Food was average."}
{"text":"Great service and food to match. The margarita was  as good as any Mexican restaurant would serve. One of the owners even asked how everything was. I hope they do well!!"}
{"text":"This easily became one of my favorite places to eat in my area after a single visit. I loved the comfortable decor, that still felt romantic in the middle of the day. 

My boyfriend got chicken marsala with mashed potatoes and broccoli. I landed on a salmon blt. Both were absolutely delicious. We also ordered the firecracker shimp as the appetizer, and each one was seasoned perfectly. As our dessert, we shared a strawberry margarita, which was such a decadent treat!

I was pleased with the display and the quality of the food, and I'm excited to try a few more dishes from this comforting place."}
{"text":"This place is our new favorite. I've been here twice now and have sampled several items, all top notch. Most items are spicy, which is not really my thing, but I still love this place because the quality is great. You can really taste the love in this food. Crab cakes are wonderful! Almost all crab, not much filler! Chicken and waffles are amazing! Best waffle I've ever had! Had a chance to speak with the owner and listening to her describe how she makes the waffles, I could tell she really takes pride in serving great food. Turkey \"ribs\", yum! Fried broccoli, Chicken Marsala, Bellé Alfredo, all great! Even my boyfriend loves it and he is a food snob. Must try!"}
{"text":"We had the chicken & waffle (forgot what it was called on the menu), crab cakes with sweet potatoes and asparagus, and the kids had Alfredo. We loved every bite of it!  The service was great as well. 
My husband couldn't stop raving about the crab cakes.... We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Wanted to give this place a shot for date night. We were very disappointed. The server didn't know about the menu or specials. My steak was over cooked.  I told the manager and he did nothing. The chicken Marsala was a deep fried chicken breast. The menu was weird and the ambiance was horrible. Unfortunately we won't be going back."}
{"text":"What's not love about this place? My GF is a crab cake snob from the beach and this place is right up there with the best of 'em according to her. I loved the unique take on the chicken and waffles. The apps and salads were fantastic too. The service was top notch. I couldn't recommend this place more."}
{"text":"I came here recently based on the other 5-star reviews seeking something that has been lacking in the Charlotte restaurant scene. Originally a Richmond native, we had been missing the great local restaurants that we had been used to. To me, Belle Grille wasn't all that it was made out to be. It's casual dining down to the paper napkins and the taste. I ordered the tilapia Alfredo for a main and the firecracker shrimp as an app. The tilapia had been seared a little too long on the grill leaving a burn taste all around. The firecracker shrimp had me thinking of a bang bang shrimp like item, but it was only fried shrimp with a spicy mayonnaise dip. No real beer selection other than miller and bud lite is what I was told. Overall, the restaurant has a nice ambiance and atmosphere, but the taste did not deliver as I had hoped."}
{"text":"First off - 98.5 Health Grade!!!  Yay!! 
This was our first visit, and the service was very slow. However, after watching the moves of our sweet waitress, I honestly believe that she was brand new and we will forgive that.  I think the bartender must have been doing double duty because it did take longer than expected to get our drinks.  Finally, the waitress delivered them, along with our first glasses of water. 
Their food is absolutely delicious!  My Buffalo Parmesan Kick'n Chicken \"whole\" wings (and I mean whole - with tips attached) were very good and we totally killed them. Parmesan-truffle fries and Cajun chicken roll were great choices as well, and the sauce served with chicken roll is awesome.  The side salad was good, but the blue cheese dressing wasn't - a different brand would be better. The live entertainment was great, but keep in mind that in a restaurant this size, it can get loud."}
{"text":"Very disappointing- again. I wanted to go back for the broccoli but tonight it was cold and not brought right out of the kitchen. We ordered the sampler with the chicken, shrimp and broccoli and the chicken was the only hot item on the platter- manager came to ask about it and we told him that a couple items were cold but he never came back or seemed to care to fix or be accommodating at all. Also, none of the accompanying sauces came with the platter as advertised. Had to ask for them. And one arrived after the platter had been removed- really?? Ordered wine, which were the smallest glass pours of wine I have ever seen in a restaurant. I usually have 1 glass of wine at a restaurant which lasts me through apps and dinner- tonight I ordered 2 before dinner even arrived. Tried to order a third but it didn't arrive before I finished so I had to cancel it altogether. Waitress assured us manager would come over and speak 3 times but he was too busy socializing to worry about his other patrons. Needless to say, we will NEVER be back- marking this place off our list.
And we were charged for that third glass of wine on our bill that never came to the table for dinner- total BS - don't waste your time or money on this place"}
{"text":"I LOVE this restaurant!  It has the best food I have had in a long time while eating out.  Everything is freshly made and cooked to perfection.  It is casual but elegant, and perfect for date night.  My new favorite place to eat!  Everyone is very nice and helpful to the guests as well."}
{"text":"The food and customer service is excellent. Belle Grille is a wonderful addition to the neighborhood. WELCOME"}
{"text":"My first time here and I'll be back. Very nice casual atmosphere with food made with love. 

Definitely a great find!!

Owners are on site and very hands on!!"}
{"text":"I have order food through Doordash a few times now and the food is always good. The portions are perfect and the menu has some nice items to choose from. Now the wife and I just need to actually go to the restaurant and  eat!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Sunday night unknowingly right before close-the owner insisted we stay and I'm so glad we did. 

Started with blackened chicken rolls with a sweet chili sauce-very crispy and flavorful.

We both got a version of alfredo pasta with blackened chicken. The sauce was homemade and creamy, and had lots of good cheese flavor. The chicken was well cooked and seasoned. Great service as well.

We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"The food was mediocre. I had a coupon from the GoPlay Save book that they said was printed wrong and the supervisor (?) didn't want to let me use it at first. She told me that it said one thing but it was meant to say something else. After a long process of me telling her that I understand what she wants the coupon to say and but what it actually says is not that she let me use the coupon. It was a weird experience but the waitress that we had was super sweet."}
{"text":"The food was great, but it took 30 minutes for the food, they forgot a main course for one person, and there was no compensation such as \"sorry we forgot about one of your entrees and were 30 minutes late - that one is on us.\"  I have no plans to revisit."}
{"text":"My coworker and I have been looking to try new places in the area. So naturally I took to Yelp for assistance. I looked at the menu, pics, and reviews and decided The Bellè Grille was a must try. I was NOT disappointed. Actually WE were not disappointed. We both loved it. The atmosphere was amazing, the service was superb, and the food was great. This is my first 5-star review and it was well earned. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Decided to try a new spot.  We had guest on town. I wasn't disappointed. Service was good, food was tasty and warm. It is a family run place and you can see they really care. We will be back. I had the Belle salad, my husband had Belle signature wrap....he enjoyed it. I recommend it!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had a fantastic experience here last weekend! We started with the fried broccoli then had shrimp and penne pasta which was amazing! They had a two man jazz band (keyboardist and sax) that really added to the ambience and sounded great! The owner came over and talked to us at length and was a truly nice, genuine guy obviously interested in making his restaurant one that people want to keep coming back to. This little spot is tucked away in a strip shopping center but it quaint and intimate once you step inside. We'll definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Unexpectedly Amazing.  We stopped in without any prior research, which is unusual for us.  Boy, are we glad we did!  

All three of us agreed it was the best meal we've had a long time!  Super friendly staff.  \"Miss Darlene\" greeted us & was very cordial to my wife, my 13 year old and and our twin infants.  The twins definitely got the most attention, but I digress. 

Appetizer of fried broccoli and green beans.  Delicious!  

Fried chicken with Gorgonzola & the most delicious waffle I have ever had.  The Sweet potato mash was to die for, as were the garlic truffle fries.  We had an incredible tilapia Alfredo and their home made sauce was delicious!  

Topped it all off with a home made apple pie, and the dinner was simply put: perfect!  We are definitely going again!

One of our new favorites."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this spot!  Came here based on yelp reviews and I was totally surprised!  Food was good, drinks were great....atmosphere was on point!  I am here with my bestie on karaoke night.  They almost got me..  started swaying to the jams, feeling good and almost got up to sing!  Whew, stopped myself just in time.  Check this spot out!  I am coming back!!!  Hope to meet you!"}
{"text":"Second time there and it was just Meh again.. both times the broccoli tastes like it was frozen and was presented luke warm at best. The fried egg rolls we knew were frozen as the waitress said that's why we had to wait so they would thaw out. I had the chicken and waffle and both were really good but the syrup tasted old to me. My husband had the pork chop and it was dry as Ghandi' s flip flop.seriously.  Doesn't help when the only knife you have to cut with is a butter knife. The mashed spuds were way too garlicky and they were also cold in the center. Please keep in mind we were the only customers in the place. 
On a good note,  The fried bang bang shrimp was really good and the accompanying sauce was not to bad altho the shrimp was good on its own.As already mentioned the chicken and waffle was very tasty. Im not a big fan of frozen food, but with so much competition around why not try to do things fresh?"}
{"text":"I've had Belle on my list for a several months, but since it's way on the other side of town I always forget about it.  I recently had an appointment in the area and decided to check them out for a late lunch.  The restaurant is in a shopping center, so there is lots of parking.  It was late afternoon and the restaurant was empty so I ordered takeout from the bar.  I had the Belle wrap(grilled chicken, grilled onions and peppers, mushrooms, lettuce) which was good, but a tad much of the house sauce for me.  I also ordered the chicken alfredo, which came with garlic toast for my son and he loved it but again a little heavy with the sauce but that's just me.  It's a really nice location and they provide live music on the weekends."}
{"text":"Came here with a group for Black Restaurant Week. It's a hidden gem in a shopping center in Matthews. They had live music tonight to kick off Black Restaurant Week and they usually have live music on Fridays and Saturdays. They have a fully stocked bar and the cocktails are super cheap. $6 for a Cosmo, you can't beat that. They offer lunch and dinner and they have a lot of different food options. I'm giving them 3 stars because the dish that I had was okay and becuase of the obvious markup of certain prices on their menu for Black Restaurant week. I started off with the fried broccoli. This was delicious, the batter is tempura like and it's served with a sweet chilli dipping sauce. The broccoli was very crisp on the inside of the batter and not mushy. The appetizer was great so I was expecting great things with the main dish and I was a bit disappointed. I ordered their signature chicken and waffle. The resents ton of the dish was great. The waffle was good, not too sweet and it was crispy on the outside like I like it. The chicken wasn't seasoned well. The outside of the beast was seasoned, but not the middle of the chicken. So you can taste the flavor only is you had some of the breading in your bite. If the chicken itself had been well seasoned, this would be an outstanding dish. Now on to the menu. We all know that it's no secret that sometimes restaurants may mark up prices for a special or a special week. My hangup is that it was so obvious. We received a Black Restaurant Week Menu and we received a regualr menu as well. Some items on the Black Restaurant Week menu had higher prices than the regular menu. The markup could've been anywhere from $.45 to $2. So this did turn me off a bit but not completely. The service was good and my app was good. I will be back to try some other things on the menu. My friend had the turkey ribs and she said they were good."}
{"text":"Their bellè Alfredo was wonderful. My girlfriend wasn't a big fan of the hibachi burger she had. We went around lunch time and the cook was willing to cook my entree even though it was a dinner item. The service was good and the place was nice and clean. Overall it was a great experience"}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service.  The waitress kept out glasses full and the crab cakes were to die for!"}
{"text":"The food is absolutely amazing the atmosphere is so peaceful enjoyable and the people are so friendly"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a great local business that specializes in service. It is family run and every staff member will give you attention whether you are \"their\" table or not. The team has a great work ethic and they are all so nice. We have been a few times and LOVE the fried broccoli appetizer and the salmon. Chicken and waffles are also yummy. They get fun music acts in to play and do a great job of engaging local community and entrepreneurs. They often have events going so check their Facebook page regularly. We have always felt welcomed."}
{"text":"On a cool 48 degree evening we walked in to a warm atmosphere that was a little chilly. Our waiter Daniel was friendly, attentive and quick to take our order. The oven roasted chicken was fall off the bone ready that was a touch on the dry side. The steam broccoli was done well and the parmesan crusted fries were scrumptious. The garlic mashed potatoes could take a seasoning tip from the fries. If they can get their heat up to 69ish we may come back and try another selection."}
{"text":"The food was very good. We ordered the fried broccoli as an appetizer and I had the chicken and waffles for dinner, but the real stand out was the service. Our waiter was very attentive and personable. We also interacted with two other people while we were there who I would assume may have been the owners...they were also very kind and made our experience very pleasant. Try the lemonade too, the touch of pineapple in it was really good!"}
{"text":"My husband, our 5 year old and I were looking for a lunch place after hitting the park and The Belle Grille came up in yelp with a 5-star rating. We had never heard of this place (only around for 3-4 months), so we figured we'd give it a shot.
It was 12:20p and the restaurant was empty, but that didn't worry us. We checked out the menu and it looked pretty good. We ordered the appetizer sampler, which included the fried broccoli that the hostess said 'everyone loves', plus chicken fingers and mozzarella sticks. The broccoli was okay, but the fried mozzarella was not great and the chicken fingers were all crunch and very little chicken. The chicken that was encased in super-fried coating was very stringy and definitely not tender. My son got a grilled cheese and fruit cup, typical kid fare. I was surprised the fruit wasn't fresh . . . just one of those packaged cups of cubed peaches and pears in syrup. My husband ordered a salad and the Cajun (?) spring rolls. The salad was a good size and he said it was fresh, so that was a plus. The spring rolls were VERY greasy, with mushy red peppers and some sort of chicken in them. The flavor was gross and the oil dropped out when each of us took a bite. After our initial taste, we let the server know we didn't want any more. I ordered a turkey burger, with steamed broccoli as my side. It took about 10 minutes to get mustard after the burger arrived, but it didn't really matter. The brioche bun had been either buttered (or sprayed with oil?) on both sides and was soaked. I took a couple of bites, but it wasn't worth the calories (which I don't tend to count ever). I'm not certain the burger was turkey, possibly beef; either way it was over-cooked (fried) yet still greasy. Since I don't eat red meat, that was another reason not to eat any more. 
This review may sound like I don't eat fried foods, but that is far from the truth. I would eat fried foods all day long (don't tell my doctor), but I don't want my fried foods to drip, ooze or sit in grease.
Sadly, this is the first and last time we will go to The Belle Grille.  Both my husband and I felt like we could hear Robert Irvine (Restaurant Impossible) or Gordon Ramsay (Kitchen Nightmare) critiquing every aspect of the restaurant as if they were doing their shows. We got the feeling that the restaurant is a venture from someone who has no background in running a restaurant, but likes to cook (fry) a lot. 
On the plus side, the spring rolls and my burger were taken off our bill.
P.S. By the time we left, most of the 2 and 4 person tables were full, so maybe we just ordered all the wrong things."}
{"text":"Just left this restaurant and the food was Superb!!! My fiancé & I travel a lot so we are able to compare many places... EXCELLENT!!!  To our surprise there was also GREAT live music by a talented saxophonist and great customer service! We highly recommend this place. Oh by the way...I'm VERY particular. Yay...great find. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great food, service & atmosphere!  Shrimp scampi, fried broccoli & cauliflower. Super staff! Great to have them in Matthews!"}
{"text":"Chose to try The Belle Grill to celebrate our 25th anniversary.  While the location might seem questionable, the food was incredibly good. And because you are in a strip center, you have plenty of parking. 
We tried the Belle sampler for our appetizer and each sample was tasty. The chicken a'liege (chicken and waffles) was really good.  Though the ribeye was flavorful, it was a bit grisley... would make a different choice next time. 
But the ice cream-topped homemade apple pie was truly wonderful.
This is a family-owned business. I hope you give them a try, I am certain you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"My wife and I finally dropped by this highly rated little eatery for a 2:00 Friday lunch and our initial impressions were mixed at best. Following the advice of fellow Yelpers, we started with the Fried Broccoli with a sweet and sour dipping sauce and had the Belle Salads as our meals. We also had iced teas that (EEK... sound the beverage gouging alarm!) ran $2.50 each. 

The tempura battered Fried Broccoli was  golden brown and tasty, but things broke down a little when it came to the salads. The fried shrimp and sliced chicken breast that topped them were indeed crunchy, hot and savory and the accompanying sauces - one hot, one sweet - were the perfect complements. They were also beautifully presented and full of good veggies, however, we found the salads themselves to be disappointing. A stickler when it comes to fresh lettuce, we just had to pick out too many brown ended and slimey pieces to be totally satisfied. The cherry tomatoes were also tasteless and mushy, and the croutons and bread were just okay. At $14 each, we expected a lot better.

Our server, Keisha, was attentive and friendly, and was passionate in describing the menu choices. The dining area was comfortable and attractive, and the sanitation rating was an impressive 97.5. 

After an $8 off coupon, our total lunch tab, including tip, ran right at $40. Our dining experience may have been an anomaly, however, as most of the other reviews have been very positive. We will give it at least one more shot though because we have to try the Chicken and Waffles (but not without a coupon)."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I planned a bridal meet & greet for my best friend's wedding. They were on of the only places willing/able to accommodate our large party. The food was amazing, as was the service! The waiters were so sweet and we got to meet the cook. All of the girls loved it. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"So glad we had chosen to eat here. The chicken and waffles were awesome. The service and ambience was what we needed. The jazz sax player top it off. When in Charlotte this is going to be our go to place."}
{"text":"Fabulous food, atmosphere and company! I had the salmon BLT ON a buttery brioche bun, hearty crispy bacon and yummy parmesan fries."}
{"text":"A nice intimate and unpretentious joint with wonderful food and service. The Firecracker Shrimp appetizer is simply marvelous. A generous portion of lightly breaded, seasoned and fried shrimp is complemented with a bang-bang sauce with nice latent heat and a tangy finish. I'd eat the sauce on toast if I could get away with it! The entree was the Bella Pasta featuring blackened chicken, shrimp, red & green peppers graced by an light Alfredo sauce with shaved Parmesan. Very rich and heartily satisfying. I wish I had room for dessert! I hear they do a killer brunch on Sundays which I will have to check out. The place is small and fills up quick, so reservations are a good idea. This is a gem, and highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Loved this new neighborhood restaurant. The decor is very well done for the small intimate space. The food was delicious. My husband ordered the fish and chips and I ordered the shrimp. They both came with truffle fries which are wonderfully good with a dusting of Parmesan cheese. The shrimp and fish were both fried crispy and were not the least bit greasy. The shrimp came with a spicy dip; very delicious and the fish came with a homemade tartar sauce. Service was great and I can't wait to go back and try more of the different dishes offered. The fried broccoli is offered as a side or a starter and I want to definitely try it next. I highly recommend this neighborhood grill & restaurant and will be our next girls night out. Very reasonably priced too."}
{"text":"Wife and I dropped in on a Tuesday and had the place all to ourselves.
Was greeted by the charming Miss Walker, a nice start to our evening.
Great to see that they crafted unusual plates for us to choose.  The other reviewers covered  them pretty well.
Wife had the crab cakes and I ordered off the menu, some of this and some of that.  Chef created something just for me.  Very tasty.
Not too big, service great, food is clever and well prepared.
I have to say, didn't know what to expect in a strip mall but it's wildly good.  
What do I recommend?  
That's easy.  Go now before this place takes off and it's tough to get in!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our lunch here.  My husband and I said, let's come back soon for dinner!  The ambiance is really laid back.  We started with Cajun chicken egg rolls.  Very lightly fried but with just the right amount of heat.  As soon as I saw the fried broccoli on the menu I knew I had to order it.  My goodness!  The fried broccoli is a must try!  Light, delicate and all around delicious.  I paired it with the firecracker shrimp which was a large portion, lightly battered and with a delicious bang bang sauce.  My husband had an asiago bacon burger - perfectly cooked and nicely seasoned.  Full bar with a good selection of domestic and imported beers.  Lots of choices from both appetizers and main dishes.  This is a friendly joint with a menu that focuses on solid dishes and has superlative service."}
{"text":"What a great find! We walked in right at the beginning of dinner rush without a reservation, so we elected to sit and eat at the bar. Upon recommendation, we started with the fried broccoli and the Berry Henny cocktail. Both were absolutely delicious. For the entrees, we had the Belle Alfredo (based on the recommendation of the manager) and the crab cakes. The Alfredo had blackened chicken and shrimp, and overall the entire dish was seasoned perfectly. My SO doesn't even like pasta and kept stealing bites from my plate. The crab cakes were moist and delicious and I will be back to eat an entire plate of that on my own. Please note that it is a small restaurant with max capacity at 66, so if you need to wait a little, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"The Bellè Grille is the trifecta.  Awesome food, fantastic and friendly service, and a great overall experience.  They offer steak, seafood, chicken, fish and more so you won't go wrong. 

Must haves:  Firecracker shrimp, crab cakes, and the apple pie.  And so much more.  The apple pie is homemade like your mom's and that is hard to find.

I love this place!  Great, quality food and service!"}
{"text":"I love a good family-owned spot!

Backstory: My girlfriends felt some kind of way that I had traveled to Charlotte several times and never invited them. So, I took them and made a commitment to come to this little place that I'd had my eye on for quite some time. Little did my friends know, they didn't have a choice in the matter.

So, we stopped by before heading to a party. Everyone was so sweet and gracious, which already had me sold. The space is a little small but I feel like the tables are well-spaced. We happened to go on a night where there was a live saxophonist and it really added to the ambiance, along with the guest performer who belted out a tune or two (come to find out, she was also a patron lol). The food was awesome! Very well seasoned, but not salty. The chicken was tender (which surprised me, because I'm not a fan of breast due to the dryness), and the portions are plentiful. All three of us had enough for leftovers the next day.

I forgot to mention, we were also celebrating a birthday! The sax player played the Birthday song for our table and Chef Rob took extra special care in making my friend a birthday treat. It was beautiful and delicious!

All in all, I'd definitely go back. Rumor has it that the brunch is great."}
{"text":"The service was very professional and friendly.  We tried the crab cakes and they WERE BANGING!!! They didn't have any fillers and all lump crab meat.  The truffle fries were delicious too.  I will be back to try more on the menu!!  This is a cozy spot that's been kept quiet so try it out for yourself!!!"}
{"text":"Fried broccoli is the highlight for us and everything else was very good too, but the service is outstanding! Nice people and quaint place. Live entertainment kept everyone grooving"}
{"text":"I consider myself a bit of a foodie. Some foods I am picky about more than others. Fried chicken and fried shrimp are 2 of them. I have to say this was the best fried shrimp I have put in my mouth. They aren't kidding when they say fresh and hand breaded! The chicken was the same! Fantastic!!! This may be my new neighborhood hang out!"}
{"text":"This was one of the best dining experiences that I've had in Charlotte. We happened to be back in town and wanted to try this place out. The atmosphere was very cool, and we were lucky enough to be there in the night that there was a live band. 

But the atmosphere was nothing compared to the food. We started with the spinach dip which was the best I've ever had. The we ordered the chicken and waffles, the pork chops, and the shrimp alfredo. While I refused to share my chicken and waffles, I stole a fork full of the shrimp alfredo. I'm not a huge pasta guy, but that had to have been the best ever. And believe what everyone is saying about the chicken and waffles. 

On top of everything, the staff was great to us. I would recommend this place to anyone who likes food. Lol."}
{"text":"First time guest during black restaurant week and I don't think they have a bad choice on the menu. Fried broccoli was tasty, Turkey ribs in house bbq sauce excellent! I recommend that you make reservations because it fills up quickly!"}
{"text":"We like to try new restaurants in the area when they open up and The Belle Grill did not disappoint.  The Service was fantastic and the food was excellent.  I tried the Chicken & Waffles and my wife had the Bombastic Sliders.  Both were excellent and we would definitely recommend.  My daughter loved her burger and the fries were great.  We definitely plan to go back."}
{"text":"Very pleasantly surprised.  I went with several friends to celebrate one of their birthdays.  I had salmon, grilled asparagus and smoked sweet potato which was delicious, not overly sweet.  They had a jazz duo  that started playing at 8:30pm.  This was a Saturday.  The restaurant allowed us to bring our own birthday cake.  They brought it out with candles and the jazz duo played the happy birthday song.  Very nice. Our wait person was very knowledgeable and attentive.  The owner was very personable.  Only drawback was their timing.  I ordered an appetizer which was delivered at the same time as the meals.  They were also a little slow with the meal deliveries.  But, that was the only drawback - not enough to keep me from coming back.  Definitely recommend.  Small restaurant with nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"We tried Belle Grille for the first time on Friday night (Good Friday).  We were greeted by a very pleasant hostess but she should lose the gum. She walked around constantly twirling it around in her mouth .... not very professional.  The ambience of the place was nice.  We thought they did a great job with decorating and the table and chairs were comfortable.  The servers could use some uniformity as it seemed they could wear whatever. It was Karaoke Friday so the DJ was playing nice old school music which we really enjoyed for the most part....he would play questionable songs at times like the theme song from Frozen....which is a children's movie. However, at times the staff would gather at the back of the restaurant and engage in very LOUD conversations which was distracting.  

Our server was good.... very attentive and kept us updated on when we would get our food.  I don't remember her full name but thought she said we could call her Deja. I ordered the Chicken Marsala with broccoli & mashed potatoes and husband ordered the Pork Chop with yellow rice & broccoli...the portions were nice but the food had absolutely NO Seasoning which was terribly disappointing.  We had to ask for salt & pepper shakers because none were on our table which was odd.   

We will give them one more try as far as the food goes because maybe that was a fluke.  This place has great potential with some staff training and flavor consistency ( because again I'm hoping the no seasoning was a mishap and not the norm)."}
{"text":"Really cool casual dining spot with great food, service, and modern decor. Family dined in on first visit and did take out next time. Really enjoyed burgers, shrimp, chicken wrap, and sweet tea was perfect (not the sugar water you get at many places)!  Owner was really personable and took time to chat with us at our table. Hope this place makes it...just what this area needs - mix of good, local dining options."}
{"text":"Food is Amazing.  The Smoked BBQ TURKEY Ribs and the Cajun Chicken Rolls were awesome. I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Patronize this place y'all!! You will not be disappointed. We came as a family and it's perfect for either families or a date night. The food is nothing short of amazing. We will be back."}
{"text":"The live saxophonist made for great ambiance. All the staff were very friendly and attentive. Everything we ordered was well seasoned and delicious (fried broccoli, firecracker shrimp and parmesan truffle fries, Carmel Appletini and turkey ribs). Brie our server was very knowledgeable about all menu items and extremely pleasant! I'd definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place with my husband and kids and the whole experience was great. Our waitress was super sweet, even when my 4 year old was screaming at the top of his lungs. We had an assortment of appetizers and the spinach artichoke dip was possibly the best I've ever had (and I've had more than I care to admit)! We'll have to go back soon and try their lunch menu as well."}
{"text":"How can you have semi-fine dining and not serve coffee except on the weekend?  We have eaten here before, and The food was good, but if you can't have a cuppa coffee with your meal it isn't worth the time and effort. So we left. And we won't be back. That's a shame."}
{"text":"Awesome food and service! The food is fresh, well seasoned, and had great presentation."}
{"text":"The food is spot on, the fish and chips (Lent Friday) were fresh and the batter was just special and not typical, in a great way. Truffle oil fries... yes please. The service, thank you Taylor or Tay as she likes to be called, was knowledgeable and when she wasn't she was honest and found out the answer to the question I had. The highlight was the Jazz/Contemporary Live music that I absolutely love. I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Great experience last night.... food was delicious and unique. Awesome service as well. Bre, our waitress, was absolutely wonderful. She was pleasant and responsive. I got the turkey ribs and fried broccoli (not sure how healthy that is but good eating!) I would recommend this spot"}
{"text":"Delightful spot. The food was delicious and the staff was friendly. I enjoyed my grill pork chops and leftovers were great the following day for brunch. My 2nd had the turkey ribs, he wasn't impressed. The service was a little slow but I will give it another try."}
{"text":"I don't want you to go here. I feel like I just found my new favorite, local, hidden place to eat, and I don't want so many people to love it that I can't get a table. But I also want the restaurant to succeed, so, you should go. We found it thanks to Yelp and thought it sounded like a great new option to try. It is a bit hidden in a shopping center with a grocery store and other retail stores, but definitely worth finding! Staff was friendly (shout out to Walker for being patient with us and making menu recommendations) and the food was great. We had a sampler appetizer with kickin' chicken tenders, firecracker shrimp and the fried broccoli. Honestly, the fried broccoli was my least favorite, but it was still a fun, new thing to try. I prefer a crunchier crust if I'm going to eat a friend veggie. However, I will be ordering the firecracker shrimp as my meal the next time we go. They were fabulous! I ordered the chicken a'liege (chicken and waffle), and this was branching out for me, but I really enjoyed it crispy chicken with (I think) a Gorgonzola \"sauce\" on top and a sweet, crunchy waffle. I would definitely order it again. My husband had the crab cakes with garlic mashed potatoes and asparagus. He ate every bite. Apparently the owners used to operate a food truck and have moved into a restaurant. I'm so glad!!!"}
{"text":"Friendly folks (dad cooks everything) and good food. Get past the unusual location. It's good!"}
{"text":"Really great food really cute atmosphere I like that this restaurant is a hidden gem the spinach dip is to die for I love love the the pita chips it's served with everything taste homemade I also enjoy the chicken Alfredo"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and the food was amazing an great servers. They have live music and that was my favorite part jamming all night long with family and friends"}
{"text":"This is my 2nd visit to this fine establishment. each visit has been an over the top experience with service and food. The restrooms are clean when ch is important. The cap the night off the live entertainment they had was by far the best band I've heard in a very long time. Leslie and Friends.!!!"}
{"text":"What a gem!!!  Fantastic service!!  Great food!  Something a little different. The turkey ribs were a delightful surprise!  Fried broccoli-yum!!! And their crab cakes were perfect!  The owners are very experienced in the restaurant world (food trucks too) and IT shows!  Live music - entertainment on weekends. Too bad we live an hour away!  Give them a try!!!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely awesome! 
The service, the food selection, the location....truly awesome.
I dropped in to checkout the place whilst in the area. The hostess was very friendly and gracious enough to answer my questions.
I decided to return the following day with a few friends and to say we enjoyed the meal would be a huge understatement. We LOVED the meal and our waiter (William) was dee-lightful! William was full of energy, offered suggestions and very attentive. Thank you!
I looked over the menu the previous day and my intent was to order chicken & waffles but instead opted for the spinach Florentine omelette, stone grits, and toast. The omelette was amazing and full of flavor! Not salty at all, and a robust flavor. 
My friends ordered the Breakfast bowl and a side of pancakes. They were not disappointed.The pancakes were light and served with rich maple syrup. Sunday is \"mimosa\" day but we decided not to indulge (maybe next time).
I will be returning to Belle Grille in the very near future, I have to try the chicken & waffles and also the shrimp & grits.

{"text":"I have only eaten here once for lunch.  The food was good and they were large portions.  There were so many unique and yummy looking dishes on the menu we all decided that we will be back to check out more dishes."}
{"text":"Family owned spot in Matthews across from the Sisky YMCA.  Inspired by their food truck venture, this is their first brick and mortar.  

They have a southern inspired menu that jumps out to anyone who loves the likes of Chicken n Waffles, Crab Cakes, Wings, etc.  

I tried their chicken wrap for lunch and it was very light and flavorful.  I love that parmesan truffle fries come standard with all sandwiches and burgers.  They were delicious!"}
{"text":"The turkey ribs were amazing! & you have to have their limoncello. The atmosphere was relaxed & all of the staff were friendly & helpful. I've had lobster Mac & cheese at several restaurants & so far this is the only place that's done it RIGHT! I will be back."}
{"text":"Best Restaurant in Matthews, NC. Loved the environment and great staff. Very attentive. Met the owner, She came over our table to make sure that everything was to our like. I will definitely recommend The Belle' Grille to Family and Friends looking for Fine and Casual Dinning. Love those Crab Cakes."}
{"text":"I was so elated that my mother suggested this little  Place...  Tysha waited on us and  She was great. Appetizer that we order was Artichoke and spinach dip delicious. The chips that they use where so crispy light they were the perfect compliment to this is a must try dip. The  owner came out to meet us which is always nice. From appetizers to the dessert the experience was beyond my expectations so glad my mother convinced us to go!

11/5/17 
Ok, I'm back today because of the great food and the dip I had a dream of last night. Today I'm having brunch and my mother got the Belle salad totally deliciousness. The shrimp and grits is also the rave. But please make sure to save room for the dessert. I love dicovering these great locally owned and operated food finds. The quick service and personal touches we received doesn't go unnoticed. Our server Bree was attentive and observant. Along with the personal touches the owners both paid attention to for each customer... Even though I do not like Sarah the chef was making a special strawberry syrup for me to put on my Frenchtoast. That's attention to detail. Amazing French toast..."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place today, it opened in October. It's a small, casual family owned restaurant, clean and more importantly the food is delicious, simple, very tasty it's got that homelike feel good food with some southern love.
The menu has a small selection of items which I loved, all the options were well detailed and sounded very appetizing (there is something about those 3 page menus at the big chain restaurants that make me feel uneasy about how much food is sitting in their freezers and for how long). 
We learned from the owner that they change up the menu every so often to keep it interesting.
We ordered the Fire cracker Shrimp it was delicious just spicy enough. My husband ordered the Crab cake diner and it was full of real crab meat well seasoned no fillers and my recent favorite the delicious Fried Broccoli was so good it brought me back memories of my mothers cooking. 
The service was great and the attention was very friendly I highly suggest you try this restaurant and support our local business owners, take a break from those big chain restaurants and their never ending never changing menus.
Oh btw the owners mentioned the have some live music their schedules are available in Fb...got to find them"}
{"text":"This was my first time at Bella Grill. The appetizer was excellent, wings and Parmesan fries. Atmosphere was excellent, live salsa instructions. The waitress very friendly, she smiled but was very forgetful and was not able to articulate the drink specials or menu items. I think my pork chop dinner was quite pricey for one chop and my potatoes were bland. To my surprise the fried broccoli was delish. All that being said I will return."}
{"text":"Great little place with charm, good live music Fri & Sat night, takes reservations, and offers awesome unique dishes. Even worth the drive from Uptown Charlotte.  Do yourself a favor and check it out."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing valentine's day dinner! My fiancé and I went on a whim, and were pleasantly surprised. The service was great and friendly. Authentic liege waffles and great salmon!"}
{"text":"Amazing! I had the fried pork chop, my fiance had the ribeye.  Everything was great! Will be back for those crabcrakes soon"}
{"text":"Food and customer service were excellent! Glad to have a great new restaurant close to our house!!"}
{"text":"I truly do not understand how this establishment has 4.5 stars.  I can only assume that they are very old reviews and the place has since gone downhill.  My husband and I decided to come here for dinner based upon the 4.5 stars on Yelp on a recent Friday night.  We couldn't quite figure out what this place was supposed to be.  The decor and atmosphere is all over the place.  They have a dry erase whiteboard outside with daily drink specials and when you walk in, there is a bar with a tv to the left (giving the place a sports bar type vibe) but when you are greeted by the hostess they lead you back into the dining room which is decorated with more a lounge feel.  The service was friendly, but seemed extremely disorganized.  At one point while we were waiting for our server to get our drinks, another server came to our table and asked us if we had gotten served yet, it was very strange.  We ordered an appetizer of the Turkey ribs, which were very good. Again, the weird disorganization, we were given tea cup saucers as our appetizer plates, they weren't quite large enough for the ribs.  It just made it awkward to eat.  We went to order our entrée's and there was another awkward moment.  They have two sides to their bifold menu, the menu on the left has a Lunch Plates title, the menu on the right has a Dinner Plates title.  Generally, when you have food being served during a specific time, it's mentioned somewhere on the menu, to let you know.  Literally, every single restaurant I've ever been to, if they have a specific time frame for certain menu items, it's mentioned, usually in bold type under the title.  Not here.  So when I went to order the Belle Burger, I was told that is only served at lunch (however, they don't specify exactly what time that is).  So, we took a few more minutes to make our selection.  There wasn't really anything on the dinner menu that interested me, so my husband got the chicken and waffles and I ordered a side of parmesan truffle fries (figuring we'd split his entrée and my fries).  When our food came out, it was only his chicken and waffles that were delivered to our table, no fries.  Our server never came to our table after taking our order so we couldn't even ask about where my fries might be.  We started in on the chicken and waffles. I can deal with disorganized or slow service, I can deal with awkward moments, but only if the food is phenomenal.  This food was not even close.  The waffle tasted old.  It wasn't crisp on the outside and cakey on the inside.  It was chewy, tough, and flavorless.  We tried dipping it in the maple caramel dipping sauce to try to moisten it up a bit, but even the sauce was bland (it didn't even taste sweet, which was so weird).  The fried chicken was dry, and seemed overcooked.  The saving grace on the chicken was the gorgonzola sauce.  It at least imparted some flavor.  We didn't even finish the waffle nor the chicken.  We put our utensils and napkins on top of the plate to indicate we were done.  We probably sat there like that for 10 minutes, until I finally caught the eye of one of the servers (not ours, but I wasn't picky at this point) and said we'd like to get our check.  She asked me who our server was and we told her, and she said she would find her.  So we sat for a few more minutes.  At this point, my husband could not stop laughing at the absurdity of our situation.  So, we finally see our server come out of the kitchen door with food in her hands, she sees us, and immediately goes back into the kitchen. A few minutes later she comes out with a small bowl of fries and tries to give it to us.  I tell her I no longer want it as we were finished eating, and we are just looking for our check.  She then tells me \"They didn't tell you how long the fries would take so I'm sorry for that\".  It's nice that she's apologizing, but it seemed weird to me that fries would take longer to cook than fried chicken and a waffle, especially since we ordered them at the same time.  Also, she is the one that took my order, so I'm not sure if she meant that someone else was supposed to come to my table and tell me that the fires would take 3 times as long as an entrée.  We finally got our check, paid, and got out of there.  We ended up going to another restaurant since this one had been so disappointing.  All in all, I would say our experience here was not a 4.5 stars experience, but that's how it works sometimes.  Maybe the night we went was a fluke, but we won't be back to find out."}
{"text":"Went with my sister for lunch. Only one server on...she told me the lemonade was freshly made but it was as yellow was a Lemon and clearly made from a mix. The food was TERRIBLE and nothing we ordered was correct. Order Caesar salads and they were garden salads, my sisters sandwich didn't have the correct toppings and was almost inedible. Would have been better if we had gone to McDonald."}
{"text":"Me and a friend had lunch at this little place today.  It was 12:30 on a Saturday and nobody else was there I was kinda surprised.  I had found it on yelp and added to my bookmarks to try one day based on other reviews.  The food was excellent, the service was excellent, the prices and portions were appropriate, I hope we just picked and off day or they do more dinner business because this place is very very good.

Menu wise they offer a little bit of everything wraps, burgers and sandwiches, seafood, chicken and waffles.  I ordered the lunch firecracker shrimp which comes with Parmesan truffle fries.  The fries were super crispy but tender in the middle and seasoned well, more Parmesan than truffle flavor which was fine by me, they were absolutely perfect I thought.  The shrimp we're also excellent, lightly breaded and fresh fried, seasoned well and the dipping sauce was solid.  My friend had the crab cake sandwich and substituted the fried broccoli for fries.  She was very happy with both items, I sampled them both the broccoli was excellent and the crab cake was also good.  

The only negative for me and I'm being picky here was when the server asked us what we wanted to drink she said homemade lemonade and my eyes lit up I love lemonade.  Well it wasn't bad at all it's just different, there is pineapple in it and I'm not sure why, it was more a shock than anything else to me, I was just expecting lemonade I've never heard of anyone adding pineapple flavor to it.  Now I love pineapple to eat but not a big fan of its flavor being mixed with beverages.  However like I said the lemonade wasn't bad just different and unexpected.  My only criticism is maybe warn people it has pineapple.  I probably wouldn't have ordered it in that case, but again I'm being as picky as possible here.  

I would like to go back and try the chicken and waffles, and the apple pie I saw in another yelp photo looked amazing too."}
{"text":"An absolutely fantastic dining experience!! The food was great, the music was fantastic, but the service... the service was spectacular!! Well done Belle Grille - we didn't want to leave and can't wait to come back!!"}

{"text":"Went to The Belle Grille for Sunday Brunch today and in was great!
I had the Chargrilled Salmon Benedict. The chargrilled salmon was outstanding!!  It was some of the best salmon ever.
My wife had Nana's breakfast and said it was very good. She especially 
liked the country ham. Our server was very good and thr owner stopped by to say hello. Overall a very good meal."}
{"text":"I picked this restaurant based on Yelp reviews, and was not at all disappointed. The service was prompt and friendly, the menu had a nice variety of appetizers and entrees, and the food came out quickly and tasted great.

We crab cakes for an appetizer. It was moist and delicious with an amazing sauce. We had chicken and waffle and pork chops for the entrees, and also thought those were great. We did not try the fried broccoli, although I was tempted. The portions were plenty big, and left us too full for dessert.

Definitely looking forward to coming back for some other dishes."}
{"text":"A delightful surprise in our local shopping center! Attentive and inventive, with personalized service in a real conversation plus a creative menu and use of space in Harris Teeter strip center. Inside feels very contemporary and hip, a diverse crowd. The signature turkey ribs(!) lived up to the hype, and my chicken and waffle was an impressive balance of crispy and succulent. Felt like we'd stumbled into a hidden treasure, made me want to go back and try some of the fish dishes."}
{"text":"We had a surprisingly good lunch .  The fish in the fish and chips was cooked perfectly.   The belle salad was full of goodness, and the firecracker shrimp tasty and tender.   We highly recommend the Belle Grille"}
{"text":"I picked up dinner from Bellè grille a few weeks ago & was pleasantly surprised. It's nice to have a friendly place nearby with good food that is not typical fast food fare. We're looking forward to trying other dishes from Bellè grille."}
{"text":"We had the best service and food at The Bellè Grille. We came in on a Wednesday nite and we were seated quickly and made to feel very welcome as first time visitors.   The place has a great vibe and very calm romantic ambience. 

OMG the chicken and waffles dinner was amazing and the smoked bbq turkey ribs are the truth!!! We will be back and highly recommend..."}
{"text":"Omg there Belle Alfredo is sooooo good. I am very picky when it comes to my Alfredo. There Alfredo sauce is so good I would put it on everything. Also the portion is big for the price. I will defenitly be coming back!"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful experience here when we stopped in for a late lunch. The food was amazing! I had the Alfredo with chicken added. It was delicious! Will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"This place is so tiny, but far from intimate.  The staff is young and inexperienced and the food isn't any different than any other restaurant in this region.  Everything seemed prepared in a rush and not prepped prpperjr because in my opinion, chicken feathers should not be deep fried with the wings... that's disgusting. The highlight of the evening was this very talented band who I had seen performing before at Hickory Tavern.  A singer and a guitar player with a wide range of songs that made the experience worth it. Phenomenal vocalist.  The staff however was inattentive. I had to keep flagging them down for refills and other needs. 

The diners in attendance were not friendly,  going out their way to avoid eye contact which made the experience more unsettling.. 
I will not be going back."}
{"text":"First visit.  Nice atmosphere.  Good music.  Great food reasonably priced.  Very welcoming.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"This was our first time eating here after a friend recommended we try something different.   We ordered turkey ribs and chicken and waffles. The food was really good and well worth the drive. The service was really good as well we strongly recommend it."}
{"text":"This is located in a grocery shopping plaza and is not fine dining.  However, the quality of the food is far above its location.  Cute bistro look inside with a neighborhood corner bar setup.  The service staff was short handed and it was busy so the wait was slightly longer than ideal but they were upfront, apologetic and working quickly, so no foul.  Drinks were standard cocktails and good.  The fried broccoli appetizer was unique and delicious.  The fried chicken was EXCELLENT in the chicken a'liege!  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Great Ambience, good service!! We had the fried broccoli, and waffles/pancakes(brunch items on Sunday)."}
{"text":"I was thoroughly impressed! The ambiance, the cleanliness, food everything was just superb. Did I mention the food!  Everything was so flavorful. I had the sweet potato soufle' with chicken wings and it delish. Please go and check them out, I promise your tummy will thank you for it!"}
{"text":"So excited for this new place! The owners were more than accommodating for the large group  group I was with. We only ordered appetizers and everything tasted spot on! The shrimp were light and crispy. The egg rolls and sauce were delightful.  I wanted to take a bag home with me of the chips that came with the spinach/artichoke dip. And although I don't care for crab cakes I do know that a good one should be mostly crab, little filler and that's what the ladies that did order marveled about. We all couldn't get over the sweet tea and the lemonade. There were so many other apps I wanted to try plus I haven't even gotten to the entrées. I do wish they were a little closer to Charlotte but I won't let that stop me from coming again and again. Definitely on one of their live music nights!"}
{"text":"My first time visiting was Friday night for dinner. The food was PHENOMENAL . The ambiance was great. The music was on point. I would given 5 stars but there was 1 slight down fall seems like their was a disconnect between our waitress and the kitchen staff. Several items we didn't order was brought to out table as well as items we ordered weren't brought initially yes eventually we got everything but it clearly was a mixup.  Overall I give a 4.5 stars and will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"We came into this place and ironically it was only 2 other tables. My friend and I immediately had second thoughts. Once we sat down and was greeted by our server (which in turn, turned out to be one of the owners, a sense of comfort and eagerness was our next emotion. The food was great, our drinks were great and customer service was even better. I read some of the other negative reviews and it's sad people can be so critical or harsh of a new local owned restaurant that is really trying to put their stamp down. I did notice the young servers but I also saw them trying hard to please customers. I think it's awesome they give teenagers a place to work and GROW. The owner was very involved and even working with the rest of her team. (This you barely see.) of course they have some kinks to work out, but I will definitely return and I'm telling all my friends to come. Prices were ok but as soon as I got my food it was well worth it."}
{"text":"This place is outstanding. Everything on the menu is spectacular. Great customer service. A hidden jewel.  I can't wait to go back.  Definitely recommended from this foodie."}
{"text":"Came here tonight for Black Restaurant Week. Heard some good things about it so decided to check it out. The restaurant itself is in a nice location, kind of in the center of a shopping center. They have a nice little patio with outside setting. The inside is dimly lit and has a romantic feel. Friday & Saturday evening they have live music, we caught a little bit of it & the saxophonist was good.
Started off with the fried broccoli, it was good but nothing special. Had a tempura batter and the broccoli itself was cooked perfectly, served with a side of sweet chili sauce which made the dish. 
For my main dish I choose the turkey ribs which were perfect and I would highly recommend that dish, it comes with mashed sweet potato & a melody of vegetables. The ribs just fell off the bone & the bbq sauce was tasty. 
The service was good. And the owner even came out and thanked us for coming."}
{"text":"My husband and I really enjoyed this place.  One of the owners, Darlene, welcomed us and gave us more information about what type of events they're planning.  I can tell she really cares about the customer's restaurant experience.

We shared the crab cake appetizer and we were left wanting more.  We both ordered chicken and waffles.  I've had them for the second time now.  They never disappoint.

The prices are great and the servings are satisfying.  This is a much needed restaurant in this area of Matthews.  We have more than our share of great barbecue.  I hope they stick around for a long time."}
{"text":"Phenomenal crab cakes! No filler....it is full of lump crab meat with a crunchy panko exterior. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"My first experience here and I was pleasantly surprised. One of my prior coworker's from NY had posted the last week she was going here and I asked how is this place?  From what I saw online the pics looked awesome.  She suggested we make plans for lunch. 

The interior is exactly what I was anticipated, but I liked there was an out front eating area too. 

The crab cake appetizer was spot on. Love mine not over cooked and not dry. Only thing I would do next time is ask for more of the sauce, it was scrumptious!  Even drizzled it over the veggies too, I'm old school and remember mom saying eat your veggies. Well I did . 

My friend had these amazing broccoli that was nothing like I've had before. They seemed to be fried (not  sure) they had a chili sauce drizzled on them that I was mmmm so good. 

Next for the entree, my friend is vegan and they made what I want to say is a special for her, I would just check prior to going to see if they can address your dietary needs as I tell people you should check ahead of time. All I can say she what is in-front of her was not all of it. She had another veggie medley. It looked like something I would settle for too if it wasn't I wanted one of the good southern meals I was hoping to taste. 

To many choices but I've been drooling for some for a good chicken and waffle meal. I didn't need more than that to eat trust me!  The waffle was cooked to just the right texture to be able to hold the chicken and the maple syrup without getting that awful sogginess. The chicken I was just as I hoped! Thus the reason for 5 stars!  The chicken was crispy on the outside with the right crunch and the inside had that wow factor, which most chefs miss because they focus on the outside but not on the inside. It was juicy and moist, not over cooked or under cooked, both I so do not accept for chicken and make me not go patronize a establishment again. This place was spot on with all the food. I also hate, yes hate those who  go heavy handed on salt and pepper. There are hundreds of other spices and herbs to use while preparing foods and sadly, many places think that is the way to go. 

Yes I love cooking and have helped Mom since I was 4-5 yrs old and majored in Home ec in high school and yes is still cook for people to this day, sorry I'm Italian Mom always said have food or staples in the house for unexpected visitors. 

So if you're in the area, stop in and be pleasantly surprised and bring an appetite. Oh and they have jazz night so make sure to call and find out the dates."}
