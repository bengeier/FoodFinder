{"text":"This is my local Joe's and I love coming here.  I've had various menu items and I have never been disappointed.  When I'm looking for some comfort food and a good beer, this is one of my first choices.  Staff is always friendly and fast.  Never had a bad or meh experience."}
{"text":"I went here during my visit to Calgary...

The first big plus is that they are open late. It seemed like everywhere downtown sort of shuts down at 9pm. I was really hungry after a play and Original Joe's came to the rescue. 

I had the Thai-style Salad and it was very good. The grilled chicken, noodle and cashew nut mix  was an unexpected combination... but it tasted great with the sauce. 

It is a place I will visit again."}
{"text":"The food was a bit salty and greasy, the service was average. I didn't have to wait to get seated and it didn't take too long for my order to be served. I liked the outside patio, it is right on Kensington and I went on a weekday."}
{"text":"It's alright its clean enough the staff are friendly but some of the food isent good. The bands they have are good time to time. The general noise is loud at least to me but I've experienced louder in my day.   It's ok in a pinch !"}
{"text":"Alright, with the amounts of time we've been here I guess I should update my reviews and rating. I normally always get the same thing so the quality of the food is on par and always hits the spot. The service has improved to a point that I want to give it 4 stars but they recently increased their prices which makes my update only to 3 stars. 

I keep forgetting to mention about the bathrooms here, I don't know if all OJ's have this but the foot door opener is a nice touch and enables you to open the door with out touching the handle keeping your hands clean (if you washed). Loves it! Wish every establishment had this!!!"}
{"text":"OJs at 7403 Macleod Trail SW opened quietly this afternoon.  If you are already a fan of this popular restaurant chain then the interior of this new location will be immediately familiar.  It's the same décor with dark wood floors and bar height seating.  Televisions line the perimeter and you are greeted at the front door by young, perky staff.

The menu is solid with options that are always predictably delicious and available for reasonable prices.  You will also find gluten sensitive options along with starters, greens, bowls, flatbreads, burgers, and desserts.  Try their house branded craft beer options available on tap.

The building Original Joe's now occupies used to house Soundsaround.  There is plenty of parking in their lot behind the building.  I am looking forward to their large patio opening once the weather improves.  Until then I will have to be satisfied with a serving of their warm, chewy, chocolate chip cookies and milk.  Mmm."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, waitress was very nice.  Hubby and I were here for our date night.  I wanted to try drinking beer, as I usually don't like beer, so the waitress brought me a sample to try before I ordered a big glass.  Had the Alley Kat Aprikat beer, which was super delicious!  I highly recommend it!

We shared the Red Tractor nachos with spicy beef on them.  They arrived in a huge basket with the perfect amount of cheese and other toppings.  We couldn't finish the whole thing, it was quite a big portion!  I'm glad that we shared it lol.

We'd come back here for sure, especially on a hot day when we can sit on the patio :)"}
{"text":"Newly renovated - looks great!  Menu is really appealing - meal was fresh and awesome.

Was impressed with the diverse menu - but not overwhelming with loads of items - clearly some thought was put into the menu.

I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"Original Joes (or OJ's, as it's more commonly known) is a friendly, laid back place with good food and good beer. They serve \"Thirsty Beaver\", which is a particular favourite of mine. 
OJ's is a wide open space with tons of cozy booths to settle into. Come summertime, their patio, with a view of 4th Street, is an ideal place to do some people-watching and catch some rays. Get there early on weekends if you want a spot, because the patio fills up fast! 
Owing to its location, this OJ's is a favourite of service industry types to unwind after a shift. Or before, depending on your capacity and the strength of your breathmints! Nevermind that, though. 
Perhaps because they cater to so many service industry workers, the service is always spot on. Always fast, always friendly and often easy on the eyes. All good things!"}
{"text":"Have to seat yourself. No one came to give us menus. Didn't see a waiter or waitress for over 15 min so we left. Won't return. Horrible service!"}
{"text":"Went for a quick dinner tonight at the neighbourhood OJs Service seemed kind of  inefficient as the wait staff was buzzing around but it seemed to take forever for things to arrive at the table.
The cash desk at the front of the restaurant appears to be the space to store the rags they use to clean up the tables. The wait staff would fling these cloths at the desk and it looked pretty messy with the rags everywhere but whatever.
We were waiting , and waiting to pay for a pretty average meal when one of the wait staff picked up one of the rags WIPED her FEET with it and threw it back in the pile!!!
I told our server that it might be a good idea to clean up the  the cloths based on what I saw.  She giggled and did Nothing!  It took a chat with the manger for a clean up to happen.
Pretty disgusting. Won't return."}
{"text":"Their food never is a disappointment. Staff is super friendly. Potato bacon soup is divine! Can be noisy. But at least it's not full of screaming kids. Wait time on Friday was 20 minutes, not to horrible. Will definitely come back"}
{"text":"Food here is always awesome. Been coming here for a while now and I have zero complaints."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I go here every couple of weeks. The food is always great, the service is about what you'd expect from a pub. All in all I really like the place. 

The kona burger is really great. I love everything on it. They have unique burger buns which are good and you get two sides with a burger. I have loved everything I've eaten."}
{"text":"Had a really great time here with some colleagues. We came on 1/2 price wine night, Thursday, and the selection of white and red was very good. Split between 3 people, 2 bottles of wine was an AMAZING price. 

We all ordered a variety of meals, the chicken fingers, veggie burger, and some appys. Everything was really great. Their sweet potato fries and dry ribs are especially delicious.

Service was also great. Our server and greeter were very friendly. Only recommendation is if you go on 1/2 wine night make sure you get there early it gets busy!

Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I have been to OJ's quite a few times now in a few different cities, and overall I would say I enjoy their pub fare and casual atmosphere.  The value offered is excellent, with generous portions and a wide range of side dishes.

For this particular location, I would rate it as just average.  One of my favourite items used to be the beef dip, which is what I decided to try again last night.  I love the flavor the horseradish, grilled onion and mushrooms, topped with cheese all offer.  And their dip is spot on.  I ordered it with fries and gravy, and honey slaw.  The problem with the dish is that the beef was tough and chewy, and the fries were overcooked and dry.  

This isn't the first time I have had this problem with this location, which is why I wouldn't rate it above 2 stars - consistency.  Consistency of food quality and consistency of service.  I could probably overlook the service, but I can't overlook the taste of the food.

I've tried ordering different items on the menu, and have fared a little better.  Because it's such a great value, convenient and a great atmosphere, I'll try it out again.  Maybe a burger next time?"}
{"text":"We tried to come here for lunch on a Saturday with our one month old daughter since it says it's a restaurant and were kicked out because they don't allow anyone under 18 including babies... how can you call yourself a restaurant  AND bar... be real just say you are a bar and put the proper signage up+"}
{"text":"I'm really really done with Original Joe's this time.

Really. No more chances.

If anyone followed along last summer on my blog, I encountered bone chips in my turkey wrap at the Kensington location. The server said 'oh there shouldn't be bone chips ...'

Thanks, Tips.

The bone chips broke a temp crown I had on my back molar. I was leaving for Toronto the next day for a gig with Molson and couldn't get it taken care of until the Saturday of the Labour Day long weekend. Yeah ... whole tooth removal on a long weekend.

Eff.

People have worse problems, I know.

Anyhow, I swore to never set foot in that restaurant again. But I do like OJ's food and figured I would give another location a shot (this even after questionable service at the Stephen Avenue location for only a beer).

The food was delicious. I had the lettuce wraps (although I can't for the life of me figure out why they went with Romaine lettuce instead of the easily wrappable iceberg leaves) and Chelsea went for the fish tacos.

We started with the very spicy (perfect) spinach and red pepper dip and finished with the OJ's Dirt Pie.

The food was delicious. It was a fabulous meal, start to finish. My sincerest compliments to the boys in the kitchen.

The service, however, sucked. Terrible. Brutal.

Surly. Unfriendly. Lack of attention. Outright ignored us at times.

Like Chelsea said on Twitter, if you can't be at least friendly, you probably shouldn't bother with a job in serving.

Seriously, OJ's. Never again."}
{"text":"We stopped in one weekday evening to grab a pint and a bite to eat . . .  basically, this place was right beside us, so why not give it a try.

Inside, this location is a bit smaller than other OJ's visited.  There isn't a huge capacity.  It didn't matter on this night, though, as it probably was only half occupied.   I'm sure it fills up on weekends with the neighborhood \"staggering distance\" crowd.  

Anyhow, an Original Joe's is what it is.  I pretty much sum them up as being average.    Typically there is someplace better nearby, if you want to put in the effort.   

What did stand out on this night, though, was our waitress.  My friend was watching attentively from first arrival, and finally announced an observation:  \"She can only do one thing at a time, period.\"  

And so, like budding anthropologists, we started watching and taking notes.  And it was fascinating!

Observed behavior:  

We would finish our drinks, and close our menus, ready to order.  She would take our empties, look at our closed menus, and walk away without mentioning food or refills.  

She would then come back, take our refill drink order, and quickly walk off before we could order food.   Our closed menus still clearly visible on our empty table.

She comes back.  Food order given.  Drinks getting low.  No mention of drink refills. Gone like smoke.

Food arrives, still no drink refill order taken.  

Finally drink order given.

It continues.  Visit by visit, table by table in our section.    Each fly-by for one specific task, and one only.   The attention was there.  The effort was there.  The multi-tasking.... not so much. 
 
Anyhow, I don't mean to be critical.  I personally can't remember anything either.  But I'm aware of that limitation, so I make use of a notebook.   Otherwise, like her, I'd be repeating the same thing in my head all the way to the kitchen and praying I didn't get interrupted.    \"Extra napkins table 7.  Extra napkins table 7.  Extra napkins table . . ?.  Extra natchos table 7 . . . Cleanup on aisle 7 . . .   Doh!\"  

Things can just go so wrong.

Well, anyhow, I guess you get my point.  Service was kind of on the slow side, but not due to a lack of effort, just a lack of skill.  Maybe it was her first day.   The food was fine, the beer was cold.  If I lived nearby, I'd drink here so that I could walk home and not worry about cabs."}
{"text":"This used to be one of our fave spots. Now the food sucks so badly its impossible to eat here. I've even reviewed this spot before...about how great it was! We always loved the people that worked there and always ran into friends. Now all of the OJs restaurants serve terrible food so we don't go anymore. Many friends have said the same thing. I assume it is due to the Cara Group takeover...regardless, its a bummer."}
{"text":"Our service at this location was great and our waitress was wonderful, the food however left us a little disappointed. Be cautious when entering as it is very dark even during the day which makes for a great bar atmosphere but also makes it hard to see your footing on the way to your table. 
We started with the truffle parmasean potato crisps which are the Monday night special. There is a fair amount in the order but some chips were way over seasoned and too salty and other chips had no seasoning at all. 
For dinner I had the Mediterranean chicken wrap. The wrap was dry with more wrap than filling and the chicken was overcooked and dry as well. The dish comes with two sides, the fries and gravy are good but the coleslaw was very bland and tasted like it had nothing on it, you could see the sauce but not taste it. 
My husband had the street dog which he said was tasty but the dog was much too small for the bun. Again the fries were good but the slaw was the same. 
It is hard to say if it is a not so great menu or just a poor execution of the menu at this location."}
{"text":"This is the best OJ's I've ever been to. The food is always delicious (especially the Kona Burger!) and the staff are friendly!

OJ's also has 4 shots for $12 (choice of lemon drop, burt reynolds, sour jack, and one other I have forgotten and can't find online!)

Tuesdays are Wing Night (this location's Greek Wings are to die for!) and  Thursdays are 1/2 price bottle of wine nights. 

Only caveat: avoid the coleslaw; they drown it in dressing!"}
{"text":"Original Joes is one of my favourite places to eat for pub food. We tried to eat here a few weeks back on a Friday. 5 of us arrived at about 7:45, 3 of us ordered food within about 20 minutes. We asked the server for our food closer to 9 because it was taking forever and they weren't that busy. By 9:15, my 'hot wings' came out at room temp with a dash of sauce. I asked our server for some additional hot sauce and she wanted to send them back to the kitchen because she knew they looked like crap. When they came back out 5 minutes later, they were the same wings, colder, and with a side of hot sauce. I asked if my wrap was going to be out soon, since it had been well over an hour since we ordered, and she came back and said she had no idea how long it would be, but it would be more than 5 minutes, so I cancelled the wrap. My wings were comp'd which was good because I would have been super unhappy paying for those. We finally left at about 9:45. It was incredibly frustrating and disappointing. Our server was apologetic, but I think she should have warned us ahead of time that they were short staffed in the kitchen. She should have recognized it took a plate of wings, nachos, and dry ribs over an hour to get to a table, rather than us having to bring it up and ask multiple times. Even after cancelling the pita, there was no manager or anything to apologize for the terrible terrible service and quality. OJs is usually our first choice when my husband and I have our date nights or want to go to a pub with friends, but I think that has changed since that experience."}
{"text":"Kitchen staff seemed very unprofessional. I witnessed a few of them playing on their cell phones, then handle food. Grossed me out!"}
{"text":"Great place, consistent, fast, and friendly. LARGE portion sizes (which is a must have for me!)

I will continue to go here!"}
{"text":"I love OJ's.., they are probably my favourite pub chain, but this location is lacking. I've been to this location several times and I find the service particularly bad. Food is good as per the rest of the chain, but the wait staff here seem to need a wake up call."}
{"text":"I like Original Joe's and have always been served a decent meal here. I especially like their hotdog deal. It's filling and comes loaded with stuff....
This one is the original Original Joe's in Calgary, they tell me. We showed up there early on a Sunday morning after a very long Saturday night. I was a little out of it, but I think they were serving us booze at 9 am. Could that be?? It was early in any case....
So, if you're looking to avoid church some Sunday morning, swing by Joe's for a beer and stay to watch the football game.
It's a good place and the staff are very accommodating....."}
{"text":"Stopped in to Original Joe's during a business trip in Calgary in August 2011.  Nice ambiance sitting at the bar and enjoyed my first Grasshopper wheat ale from local Big Rock Brewery.  I will definitely have this beer again next time in the area.  

After enjoying my beer for a while I explored the menu and noticed a wide arrange of different foods (jambalaya, burgers, salmon).  It was a good mix of food, which meant to me it was probably a chain restaurant, of which I later found out it was.  No problem here though, because they had a summer fresh menu of which I ordered the Gogi Taco's.  You knew I had to try the taco's if I saw them.  The taco's consisted of pork shoulder and a ginger-cilantro slaw.  These taco's were great!  They were also served with some sweet potato fries which very tasty as well.  Overall, very nice place and a good variety of food.  Definitely recommend for the traveller looking for some variety and a local brew."}
{"text":"Our first time at this OJ in Aspen. Busy Saturday evening but service was very good although our very attentive waitress never introduced herself. My wife enjoyed her Mojito and I thought the Honey Brown (OJ draught) was excellent and only $5 a pint Saturday's.  

The soup special, Mushroom Bisque was exceptional and I wish they would make it a menu staple. We shared a Nom Namaste Flatbred which had some heat due to the curried tomato cream sauce, chili flakes & spiced yogurt. Very good but a bit on the small side if sharing unless you each have something else like soup, as we did. 

OJ lists their nutritional info for every menu item. Well worth looking at before ordering as some of their items have up to double the recommended daily allowance for sodium! Better take a defib along with you!!

Plenty of TV's for game watching. We look forward to going back again!"}
{"text":"Considering how busy pubs are in the Marda Loop area, I've never had to wait a ridiculous amount of time for a table . The longest I've waited was 15 minutes, but we waited near the bar and had a drink. My husband and I often go there on weeknight evenings. It's usually busier during the summer months. This is a good local pub/restaurant that has delicious food, excellent service and great prices."}
{"text":"I ordered the Steak Sandwich, Medium Rare. The steak was unseasoned, and burnt on the outside, and due to the lack of seasoning, the only flavor experienced with each bite was burnt meat. 
The service was excellent though, and our waitress was very friendly. I really wish Yelp would allow you to rate the food and service seperately for this reason."}
{"text":"I had the butter chicken bowl; it was delicious. The service was great, received my food within 20 minutes. Great mellow place for a quick meal and some cold beers. I would go back again!"}
{"text":"Not a fan... their wine special was great! But their food is mediocre at best. I've been there a couple times and have never left thinking wow that food was amazing... sorry"}
{"text":"I didn't know this Original Joe's existed until last Sunday, when we stopped in for lunch. It met the standards of other Original Joe's I've been too and the service was prompt and adequate (remember this is Calgary, adequate is a huge compliment in this city).

We were all pleased with our meals and they even had import beer on sale which went down well with the hotdog meal I ordered. Everytime I show up at a Joe's I say I'll try something else, but that always seems to stand out on the menu. It's two hotdogs, cut down the middle on one delicious bun, covered with fried onions and mustard. It really is quite good and they seem to cook it to perfection every time. Plus, you get a choice of two sides, which makes the plate full and a good value....

This Joe's is clean and spacious with good food (as always) and fresh beer. I recommend it on a Sunday afternoon."}
{"text":"Good thing we ate here before reading the reviews.  We had a excellent and very attentive waitress and the food was superb.  Sat out side on a busy Saturday night and was never rushed to leave.  Seems like a lot of the visitors were locals which is always a good sign in the middle of tourist section of town. 

Our food:  wings with half honey garlic and half sweet chili were quiet good.  Sweet Chili rocks and the wings were cooked just right.  Pepper burger was quiet tasty and the fries were yummy.  Lastly the home brew was especially good.  I loved the red beer.

If we ever come back to Calgary.  OJs will be on the list."}
{"text":"The French toast was great  banana bread Bailey compound butter.  We also had the smash brown Poutine sub hollandaise add two poached eggs and it was very good.  Beats standing in a hangry lineup at nearby Cora's for sure! $5 Caesars and tall cans doesn't hurt either."}
{"text":"After walking up and down Stephen ave to find a place to have lunch with my friend we finally decided on Original Joes.  We were greeted at the door by our server and the hostess, and picked a table in the dining room.  

The server came over with menus as we sat down and immediately asked for our ID's.  My friend is 37 and I'm 28 and neither look underage in any way.  I informed her that neither of us would be drinking today and we were just here for some burgers.  She insisted on seeing our ID's and my friend gave the server his, however after searching for mine realized I didn't have it with me (didn't think I'd need it to order a burger and potato salad at 1pm on a Wednesday). 

At this point we were asked to leave and told we could not be in the restaurant even if we were not drinking and/or were not sitting on the bar side of the restaurant, unless we had ID with us.  I was flabbergasted and we got up and left, hungry and pissed off.  

Since when is this the case?  I've seen many families and younger looking people eating happily in the restaurant side (back end) of original joes, in many cities.  To the best of my knowledge this is not a minors prohibited restaurant so even if i was 17 I should have been able to sit down and eat.   I can understand asking for ID if i was trying to get a drink or had already been drinking that day, but having to have ID to get a burger in a family restaurant at lunch time is a bit extreme."}
{"text":"Had lunch here with a couple of colleagues. Ordered the steak sandwich with sweet potato fries and topped it up with a creme brûlée.

There was no real wow factor to the food. Dining room itself had the rustic vibe and was pretty noisy. Conversations had to be shouted and service was a little slow for lunch period"}
{"text":"A large group of us decided to go to Original Joe's, as our regular restaurant unfortunately shut down. It was a big  group, 20 +. Our waitress seemed to flitter in and our of the area, making it extremely hard to get a menu, let alone a drink.
After about 5-10 minutes, we got our drinks. Another 10 minutes until I got a menu.
The food was mediocre, and much TOO overpriced.
At the end of the night, it was an absolute nightmare! It took 15 minutes to find the waitress again, and she absolutely refused to split the bill, even after we told her over 15 people would be paying individually.
Needless to say, we were left to using a piece of paper and writing down every single order.
We will not be back ever again. Parking is a nightmare too!"}
{"text":"I can't decide whether I'm being fair in reviewing this; as I didn't actually EAT at this location.

My review is pretty much just on the Atmosphere and Experience I had in my first visit. I'm willing to review if the opportunity arises. 

Backstory: Went to a Friends Birthday; so I'm already miserable in the first place. I love Original Joes; the food has always been delicious - and the drinks awesome.

Walked in. This is probably the WORST place to have a Birthday. Small and Unaccommodating. 

Wasn't quite sure of how many people were actually coming.. but the table room we were given clearly wasn't going to be enough.
I say it's not fair for me to review based on the fact that I didn't actually eat anything. While I was outside having a smoke, everyone else had ordered.
I'm not going to blame our waitress for that; more-so the people I was with.. She did ask me if I wanted anything.. but I had been so off-put on the evening already I declined.

So there we have it. A review based merely on the Atmosphere and Location alone. I'm sure the food would have been delicious. It usually is.. Willing to review this again in the future. But I'd only revisit this location if I was with a friend, and not a big group of people."}
{"text":"I love the patio on 8th ave, great for people watching. OJ's has pretty good drink specials, especially the $6 2oz mojito on Monday. The food isn't amazing.. My fries were luke warm and the burger was a bit dry (but big!) but the atmosphere here is really nice. My friends meals seemed really good, especially the fish and chips."}
{"text":"I have to give Original Joe's credit for having a number of vegetarian items on the menu.  When I'm with a group and we need somewhere quick to grab a meal, I know that OJs will always be an option.  On my most recent visit I had the veggie burger with fries and honey slaw; love that the burger comes topped with hummus and salsa (I get enough crunchy lettuce in my diet without needing it on my burgers!) and I appreciate having a choice of sides.  

That being said, I am NOT a fan of this location.  The layout of the restaurant isn't great, for starters.  To access the bathrooms you have to squeeze past the food service area, and I'm REALLY, REALLY, REALLY sorry, but my long hair got way too close to food that servers were bringing out.  One coughing guest on his way back from the bathroom could infect an entire table's food with avian flu!  While we're discussing bathrooms... um, gross!  They're located in the basement, which actually has a stench reminiscent of the New York City sewer system.  The stalls are cramped and weird (my door had a triangular cut-out allowed the door to close along an angled wall); another patron commented to me that she felt like she was in a dungeon.  Keep your eyes peeled for trolls.  The stairs leading to and from the bathrooms are narrow and slippery; on the way up I actually noticed some fist-sized holes in the stairs!  (Maybe that was where the smell was coming from?)  We came when the restaurant was quite busy, so the only available seat was near the door.  Original Joe's has double doors in this location- when it's cold they need to use them!  With huge groups of guests coming in and out the doors remained opened for minutes at a time and freezing air kept blowing over my table, meaning that I actually had to keep my winter coat on to eat and my food cooled quickly.  All that the serving staff needed to do was close the second set of doors.  Overall the experience was just kind of icky... I felt like needed some hand sanitizer and some mittens after my meal."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I meet at the Kensington OJ's every time she's in town from Toronto. We are appetizer people so we always share a bunch of starters. Everything we've tried as been yummy. From the gyoza to the sliders to the calamari. The servers are very friendly and one even remembered us from a previous visit. I really like this Original Joe's location. I live near the Quarry Park OJ's and the food there is terrible and service just ok. Kudos to the Kensington Road OJ's for picking it up a notch."}
{"text":"I was going to have dinner with 2 other people.  I arrived early.  It was so loud that the waitress had to stand very close to me to hear me.  A little uncomfortable LOL.  I knew that there was no way I would be able to talk to my dinner companions.  I asked her why it was so loud and then I had to repeat myself.  She said that this is the atmosphere they want here.  I pictured us sitting there not saying a word waiting for our drinks then trying to order food.  OMG I had a problem asking a questions never mind ordering.  Then we would sit there and wait and look around not saying anything.  I think we would eat so fast just to get the heck out of there.  I waited for my people to show up and ran outside when I saw one person.  They were shocked and jumped a little when I started yelling that I wanted to go somewhere else because it is too load.  I was deaf from standing inside for more than 5 minutes.  Just then someone opened the door to get out and they were blasted by more loudness.  Wow.  A little much don't you think?"}
{"text":"I was pretty excited when this pub opened up within walking distance but we've only visited twice so far. 
We went with my son and his girlfriend for drink and food on a Friday night. The place was pretty packed but we found the last table.
Our beer and food order came in a reasonable time. Everyone was quite happy with their choice but I found that my salad was drowning in oil. I've had some oily salads in my time but there was literally a pool at the bottle of my plate. I rarely send food back but I just couldn't eat the salad. A new salad arrived...and I mean a new salad! It was the California style salad instead of the spinach and beet salad. At this point I didn't feel like sending the food back again, especially since the salad was actually really good!
I would probably come here again, mostly because it's really close to home though."}
{"text":"I only ordered chicken fingers, Not being too hungry, thinking it would be the typical small portion. Well was I ever wrong. Huge portion, brough out fast, great service. Great value. A few of my friends had the fish tacos which were also huge portions and they said they were delicious. I would go again for sure."}
{"text":"Wonderful service - Greeted by the bartender and waitress was prompt efficient and funny.  Our drinks never ran out and the food was pretty tasty for its restaurant class.  I'll be going back again."}
{"text":"I had another mind boggling experience at this place, oncegain reaffirming my belief that this place has to be a strong contender for the worst managed establishment in town. The funny ting is people ask me why I return and the simple fact it has become a bizzare form of entertainment, in a train wreck manner, I usually can;t wait to see what the management will do next."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a Saturday afternoon with a group of friends for drinks, eats, and to warm up a little.  First thing I noticed was the strange layout, this place feels cramped as soon as you walk in.  Granted, the restaurant goes way to the back, but it still feels pretty cramped.  I would not want to be here when it's super busy.

Waitress took some time to visit our table and then even longer to bring drinks.  Oh well, I get pretty used to this in downtown Calgary.  When we could finally order food, it didn't take too long to be ready and it was pretty good.  Standard nachos and calamari, no complaints there.  My $5 glasses of wine were tolerable enough as well.

They did have a band set up on stage and do a sound check that was extremely loud.  We didn't stick around long enough to hear them play, but I can tell you that sitting next to the stage would be way too close due to the nature of the layout.  Not sure if I will return to this location any time soon.  Not that I don't like OJ's, but this spot just wasn't my kind of atmosphere."}
{"text":"It's been a long time since I left a restaurant before the food I'd ordered arrived because it was taking too long.  We waited 45 minutes, after telling the waitress that we had a time consideration.  No food - had to be somewhere so we left.  During that time no one checked on us.  Apparently you're not an important customer unless you're drinking (we weren't).

The manager apologized but made no attempt to do anything when we said we had to leave.  Worst service I've had at a restaurant in a very long time."}
{"text":"I've been to this location and the Marda Loop one several times, so I know what to expect: good social atmosphere, with generally good service, in a well-kept interior, with casual (and some business) attired guests, and with an availability of a pretty diverse menu with all sorts of typical bar-themed and healthy-themed food options.

This particular location is right in the east edge of 8th Ave on Stephen Avenue mall. Considering how thin the location is (eg- about 15ft across), the interior is surprisingly spacious with the very high ceilings. The service, normally quite good, was excellent - we were never wanting for anything, especially considering how busy it was on a Friday after work. 

I had a steak sandwich which, at $17 for the 7oz steak with a side dish, was a decent price. All the food was great, though while the meat was a very good quality cut, it was slightly overcooked. After mentioning to the waitress, she knocked it off the final bill even though I'd not asked for nor expected it.

So, overall, a 4 for the food (3 for the steak) and a 4+ for the service and I would happily come here again."}
{"text":"I like to pop off with my buddies on their half price wine! Not to mention the Buck Hunter and Golden Tee golf! Highly recommend the Ace Burger and a white wine spritzer"}
{"text":"Favorite neighbourhood pub with a surprisingly great menu and reasonable prices. 
Service is excellent and the staff are the most friendly I've ever encountered. The bar staff deserve kudos too for being very friendly and quick to take drink orders. 
It is always packed here and for good reason. 
I still have huge respect for this place for the way they handled business during the flood. I was one of many who obviously sought refuge here, as it was beyond capacity I'm sure, but the skeleton staff were upbeat, service was still incredibly fast, and they had the news on every tv. The sense of camaraderie and community was simply astonishing.
OJ's stands out amongst the many drinking establishments of Marda Loop and will remain my #1."}
{"text":"This is a great addition to Macleod: good food at a reasonable price & you know what you're going to get. 
My parents are not interested in sushi so this is a place on Macleod I can finally take my fussy father and he loves it."}
{"text":"I was at OJ's on 4 st sw on Friday December 21 2012 and sat there for ten minutes before I even got a menu and it wasn't busy at all. Another 15 minutes to come an take our order and serve our drinks. It was like the waitress didn't want to come and serve us, hate to pull the race card but hey they were on top of everybody else and were just snuffing us off, but the food was good as usual. It's just not a welcoming environment at this location, if u are a prejudice and snobby then the bar/pub industry is not your line of work. I see I'm not the only one that feels this way."}
{"text":"There's nothing unique about Original Joe's.
Not only has it become a chain, expanding through the West, but the menu is pretty uninspired. While I've had a decent meal there (pulled pork sandwich was pretty tasty), I remember that I once ordered a soup that literally tasted like they'd boiled some Ichiban and threw in a few vegetables. $12 for Ichiban. Yeah, right.

Their patios are good in summer and very popular across the city so for a drink, it'll do. Their interior could really use an overhaul and some imagination though. Perhaps it's because I'm a girl and I just find it lifeless. It lacks a sense of homey-ness, uniqueness with a feel of independence. Good for guys because let's face it...many Calgarian guys are the target demographic of OJ's. So, have at it guys...I'm sure you'll dig it."}
{"text":"My Husband and I went to Original Joe's for a late night dinner.  Neither of us had been here before.

The place seemed quiet from the outside, but was buzzing on the inside.  We chose a table in the back area near the pool table, which was right in the middle of the area and thus a bit awkward to play on.  A game of pool costs $1.25.  Our server brought us menus, told us the drink specials and soup of the day, then asked what we would like for a beve.  We both decided on the Joe's honey brown, which was on special for $4.99 for a pint.  

The menu offers some great variety and the prices are all very reasonable!  My husband decided on the steak sandwich and I choose the pulled pork sandwich.  I got to choose the kind of sauce for my pork, I decided on BBQ.  You get to pick 2 sides with their entrees, there were about 6 options, then ones for additional charge, like the sweet potato fries I choose for another $1.99.  We waited around 20 minutes for our food.  When it came, I was surprised by how much food was on the plate!  My green salad was a very decent size and I got a ton of fries!  The pulled pork sandwich was so very good.  The sweet potato fries were the best I have ever had!  My Husbands steak was very good, we were both impressed by that!  Our entrees cost about $12 each, so our bill came to $38.

While we were eating, there were 3 guys that sat at the table next to us, one guy had obviously had a few before they came there and was cursing really loud.  They took over the pool table so he would practically yell at his friend from across the room.  It ruined the mood a bit, but it wasn't the restaurants fault I guess.

I was very impressed with the quality and quantity of food here!  The service was very friendly and efficient!  This is a great place to grab some grub!"}
{"text":"The place was kind of cool and the food was good. Fish Tacos as good as any I have had. However the staff is/was terrible. Not sure they cared if I was here or not. Too bad, could have been a very fun night. Instead it was just a missed opportunity!!!!"}
{"text":"Real solid place. I was in Calgary recently to see some hockey with my brother. We needed a place to eat late on a Sunday night. After striking out at a few places on Stephen Ave, Original Joe's came up big for us. 

Joe's has fantastic food and a good beer selection. I had a great steak sandwich. Well, it was called a steak sandwich. It was a steak on a piece of garlic bread. Either way, it was tasty. My brother had a veggie burger. Really good sides too. We had sweet potato fries, brocchilini, and greens."}
{"text":"My sister and I were here looking for a bite to eat on our way home one Saturday night. Man, were we disappointed! We should have walked out after our first encounter with the waitress! She did nothing but complain about how tired she was (she didn't even bother to stand up to talk to us, choosing to sit down at an empty table instead). She also told us the kitchen closes at midnight, but they didn't want to stay open that long so would we please please hurry up and order now (it was 11:05)?
The poutine we got was absolutely drowning in gravy - so much gravy! We had a plate of gravy left over when we had saved as many soggy fries as we could handle. The brussels sprouts were delicious.
If I were the owner of this place I would be getting rid of some staff ASAP! 
I will never go back to this place, preferring to spend my money somewhere that at least tries to make me feel welcome."}
{"text":"I came here to visit with family from out of town. welcoming atmosphere, low music in the dining room so we could still talk, and good food. The types of comfort food you'd expect to find on a pub/sports bar menu.

Overall i would go again and would also recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I keep getting stuck going back here.  NEVER my choice and I was reminded again why I don't chose to go there AGAIN today.
The waitress was so rude, we had just sat down when she asked us what we wanted to drink and when no one answered her right away she said \"Hello! Anyone?\"  really?
When we went to order, one of my friends asked what Tortellini was and she said, pasta, you know tortellini.  I couldn't believe that was her answer.  
Then I ordered Five Cheese Tortellini \"whole wheat tortellini, stuffed with a five cheese blend in a roasted tomato cream sauce with garlic sautéed onions and mushrooms; topped with shaved parmesan.\" 
It was sooo incredibly spicy, wayyy too spicy.  My girlfriend tried mine and said it was almost the same as her butter chicken, was the same colour too??
I never ever recommend this place.  Save yourself the attitude of the staff and disappointing food."}
{"text":"I went there recently with friends for lunch.  It was after the lunch rush, so it was not busy.  The service was very slow and it took a while before the server came for a drink order.  The 3 of us put our orders in and a half an hour later, only 2 of the orders came out.  I waited and waited and finally I had come to the realization that they had completely forgotten to make my burger and fries.  I mentioned it to the server and she let the cook know.  Not 10 minutes later, my burger and fries came out.  I took one bite only to realize that the burger was undercooked and the bacon was uncooked....completely grossed me out and I sent it back and stuck to drinking my water.  At this point, I saw the server speak to her manager about our situation.  He glanced over, and didn't even come to talk to me about what had happened....simply ignored us.  The other 2 meals were average...nothing special.  Overall, a terrible experience.  Won't be going back there to eat!"}
{"text":"Tried the breakfasts here and other locations too. Really good and good value as well. Prices have been creeping up in our other haunts, so we were looking for a new place. They have a small but varied brunch menu, but we've tried most of the items and not been disappointed. Many items come with fruit, but the highlight is the smashed brown potatoes. These are baby potatoes, smashed and given the french fry treatment. Other good choices were the breakfast tacos, poutine, the one that comes with turkey sausage. Generous servings, but not ridiculously huge.
Original menu, good value, and no lineups."}
{"text":"I like that this place serves unique beers that are not dictated by molson. Their food is very good as well, but I wouldn't say it's gastro. The patio sucks because it lies on a busy street.  But, so do all patios in this city. 

The service here varies from abhorrent to acceptable. One night, we sat on the patio which was shut down at 2200hrs as per the law (thanks, elected officials of calgary!). We were not told about this. In hindsight, our server passive aggressively suggested this through the stacking of the chairs and never coming back outside, but at the time, we found this to be incompetent. Yes, incompetent at serving. We paid our bill by eventually meeting her at the spot at the bar where servers socialize, yell at people who dare stand in their area, and do the odd amount of work. She was very friendly and flirtatious at the point of time when capital was changing hands, but wouldn't say a word to me after she saw my tip on the bill: \"nil\". And I don't think that she liked it very much that I went to the kitchen and gave the guys 20% for the delicious nachos, either. 

A above mediocre bar with the usual medicore canadian standard of service. Experiences like this actually make me think we should move closer to a, yes, British system (of all systems): eliminate the server and order at the bar ourselves. 

We came back a few weeks later for wings and found out the kitchen closed at 2300hrs on their wing night. Weak."}
{"text":"I meet up with friends. Order a vodka soda and I get some watery drink that costs $7. I get a quesadilla with added grilled jalapenos. Woman gets the exact same quesadilla but with no onions or avocado.

Out comes a pretty decent ques but without the jalapenos. I point this out. Politely. Yes. Me. Politely. Seriously. The waitress says: \"okay, I'll take it back\". She didn't give a fuck. Then she zones into the woman's quesadilla which correctly had the 0 onions and 0 avocado. She then says \"okay I'll get you one with no onions or avocado\". I say \"incorrect\". She smiles and walks away. As she walks, I say \"nononon, IN-CORRECT.\" I read back the order to her like an air traffic controller giving taxiing directions to a pilot that speaks horrible english. \"Everything, avocados, onions, everything you have in this quesadilla but grilled jalapenos please.\" She smiles and nods while walking away.

Out comes the quesadilla. No onions. No avocado. But jalapenos. Good lord. Shit happens. But it's ok. Being a dick will just hurt their feelings and have us ignored for the rest of the night. Let's try it again. Just get it right. All of my friends are half finished their food. But it's ok. I'll catch up. I point out that she got the order wrong again. She looks at the plate and says: \"ohhhhhkayyyyyyyyyyyyyy\" in this \"I'm right, you're wrong, here comes another Calgary labor market shortage! ahahahahah fuck you! waitresses run all the bars in this city now!\" kinda tone. 

Finally, round three gets thrown on our table. It had 7 jalapenos. I counted. It was alright, too soft though. Salsa and sour cream in those min urine sample sized cups. But they were sure to charge $0.99 for the jalapenos. 

A friend also got a bailey's and coffee. Asked if he could get it to go. ABSOLUTELY NOT said Alison Redford/waitress. My friend pours it in his travel mug anyways. This city is horrendously boring when cold and sober. 

We pay up, $82 for a few drinks and 3 plates of food. Outrageous price, which works out to be an average price by Calgary standards. I do not want to tip the waitress, but my friend insists. Fuck. We give her $7. Too generous. She is absolutely certain to grab the credit card receipt as soon as I put my pen down. She does the classic canadian passive aggressiveness; as she walks away she says to us (but in the type of manner that makes it seems she is saying it to herself) : \"really!?\". I call her out on her bullshit, asking if I should rescind my tip or something. She says she was acting like an entitled bitch because my friend took the coffee to go. But really, we know why.

It's too bad OJs has such shitty service across all of their locations. I had bullshit service like this at the k-town location a couple times. It's too bad that this OJs is just as shitty, in spite of its beautiful interior (but ruined by flat screen TVs playing the 2008 WSOP). It's also too bad that such decent pub food and the experience that goes with paying way too much for it is ruined by useless middlemen that we can do without. In fact, bars would be way better in this city if they were all self service. Bars have waitresses the same reason the canadian government has its \"economic action plan\": to give people jobs for the sake of giving them jobs. 

Anyways, good lord. Why do I eat out in this city."}
{"text":"Our server was absolutely horrible and a lady at the table next to us brought a dog into the restaurant. No one did anything about it. Will not go back"}
{"text":"I have been a fairly regular customer at OJ's on MacLeod Trail since late Spring 2017. We like to come here because the food is generally good, there is a variety to please most anyone in a crowd, and the service has been very good. Many servers remember us and are very kind when we come in. Tonight however, from the moment we arrived to when we finally left, everything was off. We were greeted
promptly with menus and would have ordered right away, but we were told our server was someone else. That someone else never arrived and the original server came back and said she was our server after all. Not sure if there was a mix up or some stress amongst the servers, or whether our server was having an off night, or if she just didn't like us, but she just didn't do a good job. She warmed up taking our food order, but then was slow. When we said we didn't with anything else ( food or drink) we waited and waited for the bill. At one point our server disappeared with some other servers in the back, at which point we asked the bartender if we could get our bill. We waited again. She finally showed up again with the bill which we were prepared to pay then and there, but of course no machine. She said she would be \"right back\" with the machine. She wasn't. I have never ever considered being a dine and dasher, but when you have to wait  and wait, I can see why some people simply leave. She finally came back and apologized, saying it got a little busy. Granted it was busy, but there were plenty of servers and we didn't see others getting the (lack of) service we received. So Lucia, perhaps you just didn't like us. Perhaps you were having an off night. But you made us realize how a single negative experience can impact the way we feel about a place we have had probably 50plus pleasant experiences! It is thought provoking and rather sad the impact one person can have, but negativity is pervasive. I can no longer recommend this OJ's. Which we have up until now."}
{"text":"I never think of this place whenever it's a last minute decision on where to go for lunch. So when my coworkers suggested OJ's after we'd aimlessly wandered down Stephen Ave, I figured why not.

We snagged the last table and looked over the menu. I went with the fish & chips, one coworker got chicken strips and the other a chicken sandwich. The pieces of halibut that came for mine were HUGE! They were battered nicely and not greasy at all. I even got to try a chicken strip and omg YUM (I've actually gone back to OJ's a few times just for the chicken strips!)

Seating is limited here (the restaurant is really narrow), so if wanna dine here at lunch I'd suggest coming a bit early."}
{"text":"i've been boycotting OJ's for a while now because a couple years ago i got food poisoning (at a different location!!!) but man. a friend convinced me to just shut up and give this place a shot and i can not get enough! affordable and delicious with a wide variety of choices for food and bevvies! awesome staff also. i always tip extra well here. love getting the gyoza and fish tacos! yum yum. keep it up ojs"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch yesterday. I didn't have super high hopes-I've been to other locations and things have always been good but nothing to write home about. This was almost worthy of a note home to Mom.

We went for lunch and were seated right away on the patio. Our server was very promptly and friendly. I had the Kona burger which was huge, fresh and very tasty. I was a little overwhelmed with the 2 side options but it was nice to have a taste of more than one thing. My friend had one of their pizzas and it looked great.

The server had a great sense of humour as well as the required serving skills which you don't see enough of any more. She didn't hover too much but was around when required.

Overall this was one of the best visits I've had to this type of place in a really long time. I will definitely be back with other coworkers or with friends on the weekend. I wish the location closer to my home (by Quarry Park) was half as good as this."}
{"text":"Chain restaurant.  It is what you'd expect.  They aren't gonna go out of their way to make you feel at home stay longer and drink more, but if you want a quick drink and appy it's fine.  The beer and wine selection is again what you'd expect out of a chain restaurant.  I'm not sure why I'm even writing a review about this place."}
{"text":"My wife and I really enjoy going to this location the majority of the time, with exception to friday nights or late night as the crowd is typically the young, dumb and drunk. Aside from this, the other concern is that the smokers hang out by the front door so you have to walk through a cloud of smoke at times to enter the establishment.

Food is quite good most of the time, there has been times where the B Shift in the kitchen must be on as the quality is just not quite the same.

Service has always been good, friendly and familier."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Original Joe's restaurants in Calgary a few times now.  However, for this visit I have to give it a 4 star as the service was very good, the atmosphere was buzzing on Saturday night, plus decent clientele and the food was awesome!  The grilled cheese burger is a must!"}
{"text":"I love Original Joe's usually, but this location seems to be really hit or miss... which unfortunately, it's been a huge miss lately. 

My first few times the service, and food was great, which is why I kept returning. The past two times I've been there my food has been cold, and took forever or our waitress had forgotten about us completely."}
{"text":"The food is great and does not feel frozen. They prepare it every morning. The staff is great and welcoming. The only thing I don't really like about them is their chicken wings. Just like the waitress said the are been cooked in the morning and then warmed up again and that's why they are so dry. Gotta try the salmon fish, it's really good."}
{"text":"I know there's mixed opinions out there about Original Joe's, but I tend to be a big fan for the drink specials if nothing else. Half price wine by the glass is a good way to win me over!

My roommate and I hit up this location yesterday afternoon to celebrate a new job. We had originally intended to go to the Quarry Park location, but she ended up at her parents' house without a car and Avenida was walking distance -- and I'm really glad we came here instead! At 3:00 in the afternoon, the cute patio overlooking the Macleod Trail side was not packed at all and the service was GREAT. The waitress always managed to be right there when our drinks were low and otherwise she let us alone to chat and celebrate.

The food is always slighter better than the typical \"pub\" fare and this was no except. We shared two items from their summer feature menu - the mussels and the street corn. The mussels were great - perfectly prepared, all the mussels were opened and came with delicious toasted bread. The street corn was a little bit odd. It was tasty, but we weren't quite sure how to eat it.

In any event, we shared two appies and had three beers each... and our individual bills came to just less than $25! How can I complain about a cute afternoon on the patio?"}
{"text":"They have a huge gluten free menu !! Their gluten free burger buns are delicious. Everytime I crave a burger ojs is my go to! try the broccollini :)"}
{"text":"It's just your average Canadian pub-fare chain, but I love OJ's all the same. They have a big menu and everything I've tried there has been good. I love that the sandwiches come with two sides so you can have a little of everything. Great salad dressing! And the patio is really nice on those good-weather summer days."}
{"text":"Had one of their salads (the avo one) - super delicious & filling. I don't normally like pub salads, so it was a great treat! Friendly service."}
{"text":"Found myself here on a Saturday night. The service was good and the food was decent. I was surprised how large the venue was, I almost got lost looking for the washroom. Needed directions to get back to my table! Though the Marda Loop location makes for an interesting mix of clientele, I really didn't feel like this restaurant is anything special. It had beer, decent nachos, pool tables and people.  A-OK in my books, but not a first choice.  

Had a great time at OJ's, but I think it was more the company than the venue."}
{"text":"We have visited regularly as we live nearby. However, in our last visit, we were a group of 8, we had a terrible experience dealing with the shift manager and one of the staff. Our waitress was very rude as well as the shift manager. The shift manager pretended he didn't see us and finally when we went to talk to him, he had a terrible attitude and was answering every question we had in a very rude way the restaurant wasn't even full to excuse him on that (when we asked him if he had a minute to talk, he responded us by saying \"what do you want?\" )!!! 
The shift manager completely ruined the experience, so we will not consider this restaurant as a nice and relaxed place for our gatherings anymore, there are so many more good restaurants in the neighborhood with properly trained and friendly staff."}
{"text":"I enjoy the food I really like the chicken wrap or the slider burgers , it's a nice classy place for a date or for some friends. It's not to busy during the afternoon but evenings tend to get busy. I love the fries they are tasty , it's decent price food nothing to much. The staff are friendly and it's a trendy place to go if your looking for a nicer dinner."}
{"text":"Has been excellent every visit.  Beer Choices great, Sgt.Pepper Burger and sweet potato fries. Other items tried on the menu are great,  service has always been prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"Dinner was okay on a busy Friday night. I had turkey wrap w fries & a salad. The wrap tasted bland & it was cold (as in part of the wrap had been sitting next to an ice cube). Salad was ok - lettuce was kind of wilty but feta & crisp apple were delicious. 

Friends all enjoyed their dishes so I guess mine was the odd dinner. It wasn't bad - just tasteless.

Wine special? I don't know but 5oz of house white was only $4.50....and it was good.

Excellent service for this table of 7 gals. Great atmosphere w plenty of TVs & good music (not too loud)."}

{"text":"Hey you want to drink and eat in a earls bathroom , Iam tired of establishments ripping off the decore of una . Service amazing, decore garbage, food ..... Microwaved"}
{"text":"Generally speaking Original Joe's doesn't really offer anything different in its genre of restaurant, a mid to high end chain restaurant trying to be unique and different from the rest and in most cases failing. When travelling, a place like this is one I generally avoid. Why go some place I can visit back at home? One evening while visiting Calgary my wife and I found ourselves stopping in for a couple drinks and some appetizers. I did not have my hopes up but they were open and it seemed right at the moment. For various chain type restaurants reviews are always difficult, as these places try for some level of standardization while trying to feel unique. Do you review the restaurant as a chain or an individual place. I think there is sometimes room for both, but in this case I honestly felt this location (Stephen Ave) attempted to be different. A credit to management to really create a nice spot with quality drinks, a nice atmosphere and service. The food fits in with their average fair, not amazing but satisfying. Not horrible but you never know you may just crave that favourite dish of theirs from time to time. 

The food and drinks were good, I encourage you to decide for yourself. The real treat from this location was indeed the atmosphere and service. It in no way felt like a chain restaurant and really felt like it belonged on Stephen Ave with the other great niche and unique restaurants. Take a visit and decide for yourself but I think you will be pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"A good pub in Kensington, and a great spot for breakfast the next day! Not super fancy, but no line ups and a nice, casual place."}
{"text":"Haven't been to OJ's for 10 months and it's nice to see that the quality of food and service is still excellent.

I had the double-dog, one of my favorites and highly recommended if you're a first-timer, make sure you opt for the extra jalapenos. The house Blonde beer is always cold and consistent. 

Next time it's the fish tacos for me. My lunch mate couldn't stop raving about them and said they were \"the best in town\"."}
{"text":"This was our first time at this restaurant. Our MIL had been to one of these places in another town. We had several items from the menu. We tried the daily soup, fish and chips, and lettuce wraps.  I was trying to be healthy and tried the lettuce wrap with Chicken.  I will try it again and look for a recipe to try at home. It was too loud to visit and the fish and chips batter  was over cooked too crispy."}
{"text":"Pricey for what you get, it wants to be trendy but its not really.  Food is adequate but nothing special."}
{"text":"Love this location!  I drive from Calgary just to come here.  The staff is always really friendly, fast and courteous.  Very clean, lots of TV's, no minors, really yummy caesars (rarely found now a days) and the food is always amazing. They make the best Original Joe's french onion soup! Over time I have taken 19 people here and every one has agreed, 5 stars."}
{"text":"I'm really not sure what is with all the bad ratings. OJs has a great atmosphere, the service is always good when I come here, and the food is always the same quality as any other time. I really enjoy the Appies, and the steak sandwich is always good. I am never disappointed here and it's always a good night with friends and good food :)"}
{"text":"Hung out to wait out the rush hour traffic before heading to the airport. Started out on the patio but rain pushed us inside where it was a little cramped and noisy. Decent beer selection but not great. Ordered Goose Island IPA since they didn't have a local offering.  Had the Grilled Cheese Burger.  It was a handful.  Needed to unhinge the jaw to eat it.  Prepared well done  (not my favorite) and the bread was a bit over buttered fire my liking.  Good but more indulgent than I was looking for."}
{"text":"I had a great time at this OJ's over the weekend.

I got together with a big group of people and we ended up staying until close. They had the patio set up and we spent a good part of the night outside (at least until it started to rain).

The staff was great, the scenery was awesome (great place to people-watch) and the snacks were delicious.

I'm mos' def. a fan!"}
{"text":"Local neighbourhood favorite. Great place to catch a game, plenty of TV's and for bigger games they bring out the projector. Lots's of good seating, and the bar is always a good time, all of the bartenders are good guy's and good times always ensue.

Seating wise it's great for small and large groups, they have a few big wrap around booths that can seat six or so comfortably and tables along the side that could be put together to seat considerably more. On game nights (Flames, Stamps, etc.) it's pretty packed, so come early to get a decent spot. Also during warmer months have a great patio, awesome for people watching on 4th St.

Food is fantastic, I've never had a bad experience and being a regular I've tried a good portion of the menu. Highly recommend the fish & chips, it's fantastic. A great feature of all of their main courses is they come with two sides, so you get a little variety. Chicken caesar salad is another solid choice as well.

Booze is decently priced and they have a pretty good selection of beer both bottled and on-tap, and every drink I've ever had made has been quality.

Definitely a fan, very much recommend!"}
{"text":"Last night a friend and I headed over to Original Joe's on Stephen Ave.

I have to tell you - we had a *great* time. 

First of all, I just love the vibe of Stephen Ave as it is. Second of all, Original Joe's was buzzin' with people and laughter. Our server was a true pro..  It's  obvious that the staff here is used to serving patrons who work in the restaurant industry; the service was spot on.

This was my first time visiting an Original Joe's and I was quite impressed with the menu as well. Serving everything from sweet potato fries (YUM), butter chicken, veggie burgers, wraps, pasta, pizza and salmon, there's no chance that you'll leave this place hungry. What I loved most is that they have a ton of selection for vegetarians. They also have a ton of selection in the drinks and dessert realms as well :)

My date and I were having such a great time in such a great atmosphere that we ended up kickin' it here for a good part of the night.

Good vibe, good food, good crowd. Any questions?"}
{"text":"In Calgary, this is the only OJ's (in Mission, 4th street location) that consistently has good food and great service. Since it's in our neighborhood, we dine here at least once a week for dinner or breakfast. Their food is well priced and at this location, you get a very generous serving... Who doesn't like 2 sides with their burger/ sandwich along with gravy included in the price! Their patio is a fun place to enjoy a pint and people watch on 4th Street. The servers and bartenders are friendly and fast.

Their draught beer is always fresh and they offer a good selection of Canadian brewed beers on tap (AlleyKat, Wildrose, Tree's HopHead, Bigrock, Mill Street Organic are favorites). I also like how they make their Strawberry Mint Mojito- the other locations have forgotten to put in the mint and/ or rum!?

For reliably good food, drinks and service, try OJ's on Fourth."}
{"text":"Not a bad pub. The service leaves a bit to be desired, but there is enough food and drinks on the menu to distract you from it. They have fun beer + hard alcohol mixtures, which I love. And their butter chicken is really quite good!"}
{"text":"This is a brand new OJ's in this business park. They recently opened, and you can tell because the inside is brand spankin new and shiny. 

I have always liked the food at OJ's. It's safe, tasty and filling. In the past I have tried the Chicken Tikka Masala, and liked it. Huge portions, and very tasty. On group lunches, I have recommended it to others and they have also liked it. Their Steak Salad is also very good! They have very generous portions of meat sitting on the salad, so you're getting a lot of protein in, even if you're just eating a salad! 

The service has been good too. They always bring your orders in a timely fashion, and keep your water glass full.

{"text":"Atmosphere is dark. This place makes you want to sleep. Def not a place you want to go after dark. Honey hot wings were super hot I barely tasted honey kind of disappointed."}
{"text":"This review is for the 12100 Macleod Trail SE, Location
Horrible service! My wife and I walked in looking forward to a date night. The waitress at the front told us to help ourselves to a table so we picked a nice quite spot. There was maybe 6-10 other people in there, not busy at all. We sat there for over 10 minutes with not one single person talking to us or offering any service. We literally watched the staff talk and walk around. A waitress even cleaned the table right freaking beside us and didn't even ask if we've been helped. At this point we decided to leave. What a joke. My wife and I rarely get a date night so it was unfortunate and we're looking forward to ordering the double dog. 
Oh well, we went to another OJ's in the  sunpark location  where we enjoyed our time and received  the service we expected."}
{"text":"Half price wine on Thursdays, holla! I've been two thursdays in a row now... I can buy a bottle of wine for the same price as the liquor store and walk home with half the bottle... or less.

I've also had two great waitresses in a row - very friendly, a bit funny and really attentive and helpful. 

Food... I enjoyed the cajun chicken burger, and the fish tacos w/ salad. I also tried the market soup - it was exactly Chunky vegetable soup, meh."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious gluten free hamburgers! Great service, consistent food, nice atmosphere. I highly recommend it :)"}
{"text":"These guys are one of my favorite restaurants to eat at. On Saturday and Sunday they have a brunch menu which has the cheddar BLT, that is just awesome and would recommend checking it out. Also, our favorite thing on the menu would be the Kona burger as it has everything a perfect burger should have. Saucy, pineapple, thick juicy Patty, lots of toppings awesome."}
{"text":"Nachos are amazing! Hopefully one day I can get a seat on wing night!"}
{"text":"I never write reviews but thanks to Original Joe's I have created a Yelp account. 

My experience at Original Joes was awful. I was with a group of friends celebrating a birthday and we decided to go to Original Joe's. When we went inside we weren't greeted, so we decided to find a seat our selves at the very back because it was crowded in the front. Once we seated our selves it took 10 minutes for a server to come. Nichole is her name, she's very rude and unprofessional. My friends and I decided to order drinks, I ordered a shot, and when I got my shot I noticed about 8-10 little bugs in it. I told my server Nichole and she said \"it happens\"..what do you mean it happens?! 

By the end of the night, I had to pay for my nasty shot. The manager didn't even come to see if everything was okay. I was going to order food there but since I got a bug shot I felt the kitchen was probably not up to standard. 

The following day I phone the manager and explained what happened. He didn't care one bit, he said covered my shot (which they did not) and was being very rude on the phone. I explained to him that I'm a Chef and that you should have standards and if you don't that get out of the industry. 

What happened to me was because of laziness. The bartenders probably don't cover their liquor bottles at the end of the night which results in bug shots. 

If you want to see the picture I have posted it. So people eating/drinking"}
{"text":"Usually ok however tonight the service was slow. Had to ask if we had a waitress. Usually after they say sorry for the wait everything goes ok but not tonight.
Slow throughout. Not sure if I want to go back."}
{"text":"Ordered from Uber Eats and delivery was only 20 minutes during dinner time.  Fish and chips are delicious, it's one large piece of battered fish with hand cut fries.  Includes coleslaw and lemon.  Side of potatoes with gravy we great.  We also ordered the cheesy garlic bread, would recommend!  To go containers are nice and good for reheating."}
{"text":"Loving the patio here! Our waitress (I believe her name is Cass) is really funny and chill and the food is delicious! She recommended the Patio Joe to drink and it's the perfect refreshing taste for a summer day! You've also got to try their lettuce wraps!"}
{"text":"Always good! Meets expectations every time. Good food good locations and great staff."}
{"text":"A real let down the other night. I wouldn't have fed the dried out pinkish meat that came in my fish tacos to a cat. Although, the portion-size was cat appropriate. My friend's fish and chips looked awesome, so I don't know why they'd bother using the catfood fish on the tacos. The waitress took so long between visits that my dinner was a write-off. Pity."}
{"text":"Surprised at how nice the interior was. Dim and moody, candelit on the upper level, larger than it looks from the outside. We we not greeted at the hostess area. After a few minutes, staff just asked us to seat ourselves, so we did.
The restaurant itself and washrooms were clean.
Service ok, a little rushy-rushy. And it was not at all busy.
Pints were on sale for a Wed night, served at a good temperature.
Ordered - Original Burger. It was good, 3 stars. It needed something more, like avocado, at extra charge of course. We opted to pay more for a Poutine side order with the burger. We were sharing that so we were advised we could double up on the same side. Guess what? That added a double charge for the side, 5 bucks more on the bill, not $2.50. Sneaky. They could have told us beforehand, no?
Also ordered was the Pacific Rim Noodle Bowl. I was told it was a good choice but it really was not. It was bland as hell, only saved by Sirracha sauce and cayenne pepper. The veggies looked brownish and old, the chicken was obviously of the frozen variety, the shrimps were gritty-dirty and the rice noodles were way overcooked. I was disappointed as the menu is varied and I could have no doubt ordered something else that was straight up edible.
The server knew I was not thrilled with the dish but, oh well, right? She just avoided eye contact for the rest of the evening.
There was a manager in tonight that knew it was our first time in and could have helped out but did not. In short order, I advise against getting the noodle bowl! My tummy is doing mini flips right now. Go and buy Pho down the street for half the price.
I do not like being nickled and dimed at an already over-priced chain restaurant!
All in all 2.5 out of 5. The ambiance rescued some of our evening! (adults only over 18 years of age)"}
{"text":"This was the worst experience I've ever had at an Original Joe's.  Told to take a seat wherever we like, sat and waited 15 minutes without so much as a menu being brought to us or a drink order being taken.  This despite the fact that the server saw us when she brought the interac machine to the table next to us and the dining space was at half capacity at best.  We eventually just got fed up and walked out.  We've been to other O.J.'s around the city and are big fans of what they do but this was beyond subpar service. Maybe it was just one shit server but at the end of the day it reflects badly on the chain and we wont be going back to this location."}
{"text":"Pretty good beer specials and standard chain style food meant for a good meal. Didn't pretend to be anything other than a beer bar with food which was great for me."}
{"text":"I went to Original Joe's about about a week ago for the first time and I was impressed!! It was delish. There was a hockey game on that night so they were quite busy. However, I was surprised there were many couples in there as well. For a bar type restaurant, it has quite a romantic feel to it. It's dimply lit and they put candles on the table. It was really relaxing.

My guy and I both had a burger. I had a chicken one and he had a regular one. Their menu is quite impressive and the price is just right. It has a large variety of things on it along with a large variety or burgers. My chicken was super moist and juicy and the fries were delicious. My caesar salad could have had more garlic in it but it was still good. I ordered a margarita and it was huge!! However, for 8 bucks it should be. Yum!

I can't wait to go to Original Joe's again. The atmosphere is perfect, the food is so yummy and the service is great."}
{"text":"As good as it gets for a pub! 

I always enjoy OJ's as they have a gluten free menu. A couple of us wanted a casual dinner so we popped into this location. It was overcast and a bit dreary, but we knew the patio was heated so we sat outside, which was awesome. It was quiet, warm and we got to enjoy the outdoors. 

We had a wicked server, she was just the right amount of chatty, came back often to ensure things were good, catered to me being a celiac and was fun. It was quiet busy inside, but we didn't notice. 

I've never had a bad meal here, and the fact they have a specfic menu for gluten free, they get my vote. If you're looking for a fun or casual spot, OJ's should be top of your list."}
{"text":"OJ's in Apsen is a regular go-to for me. It is worth pointing out that they have $5 OJ's pints on special every Friday. It seems that, in Calgary, a good Friday drink special is hard to come by. There is no need to stick to familiar brands, as the OJs beers appear to be a high quality microbrew. The blonde on the patio on a hot day is very satisfying. The House Frau is also worth trying if you're into German beers.

The food, despite being somewhat uninspiring, is dependable and reasonably priced. You can't go wrong with the grilled cheese burger or chicken wrap. They also have a solid brunch that is, again, very reasonably priced and comes complete with a selection of breakfasty booze choices.

Service is always prompt and friendly in my experience."}
{"text":"Service was good but it was early on a Tuesday night.  Food sucked as the ribs were old and dry and there weren't enough fries provided.  At least they have some kind of beer selection with a bit of flavor."}
{"text":"Food looks good but it's pretty standard fare for the type of place it is. I'd say that Earl's can be better, that Moxie's is better but all of them kinda fit into the same now-mainstream whatever that is underwhelming when such places are often surrounded by better restaurants on the same street for little more spent.
Why go for borderline boring when our taste buds were designed to savour really good food?"}
{"text":"Just having experienced Charcut #alleyburger..  if you don't know what that is, you should look up Charcut & find out :)...

Needed something to eat, friends were gathering at Original Joe's, so I met them there.

Interesting place - very long and quite narrow.  It was so-so busy for a late Thursday nite.  Staff was quick to help our group get seated and quick to get a drink order in.

For tonite, I just wanted an appetizer and decided on the chicked (sliced think, breaded, served with chili sauze, cucumber & noodlels).  It tasted great.  Nice size order - reasonablly priced - served quickly.  Doesn't get better than that.

Memorable Thursday nite of a long weekend.  Thanks Original Joe's for helping to end the evening with a great experience. :)"}

I am a man of few words"}
{"text":"I was a little disappointed in this location, compared to ones I have been in Calgary. I came with my mom for a mommy/daughter day, and it was crazy busy. It was Friday at lunch, so that was to be expected. 

Our server was really slow, and took a long time to even get waters. I had to ask for the GF menu, which took another insane amount of time. We were finally able to order our food, which came out pretty quick considering how busy it was and the slow service. 

My burger (patty, no bun) was super salty, I think I ate maybe half and couldn't finish, it was too much. Fries and slaw were good though. As well, my raspberry mojito. 

My mom had curry bowl and said it was good. I know we'll go back as they do cater to GF and it's close to my parents house. I was just disappointed this round."}
{"text":"We were headed to a friends for drinks in Aspen. Figured might as well get on the bite on the way there. 

It was slow, and it wasn't that busy. In the course of a 45 minute dinner we had 3 different servers as well. They have totally changed their menu, my husband was mad as they no longer have the mango salad for a side. So he went butter chicken, which he said was ok. 
I went the steak sandwich without the bread...so basically a steak. It was good, I had the quinoa salad and coleslaw for sides. Both were tasty. 

Due to it's location, I dont see myself coming here very often, but it's a good option for those in the area."}
{"text":"Of all the Original Joe's locations I've been to across Alberta, this one is probably my favourite. Unlike some of the reviewers mentioned, I've never had any issues with service. Granted, I usually come here for lunch when things tend to be slower so it would be worth checking out on a busier evening for curiosity-sake.

As for the food, it's surprisingly good for a pub-type atmosphere. I almost always opt for the jalapeño mac and cheese. If you're into spicy food, I highly recommend it. If you're not, stay away! This M & C isn't for the faint of heart. Original Joe's also has one of the most vegetarian-friendly menus I've seen at a bar. Pro-tip: they use vegan gravy for their poutine so if that's your thing, eat away!

I think the thing I like most about this Original Joe's location is the mixed crowd. It's the kind of place my mom feels comfortable going for lunch with a friend but at the same time, it wouldn't be unusual to see a group of 20-somethings sharing a pitcher here. It's just comfortable like that.

Overall I have no significant complaints. I enjoy coming here and I'm sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"Beer Good! Food Good! Waitress fast!
I am a man of few words"}
{"text":"Came here for a burger and sangrias for lunch. I had the dynamite tempura shrimp to start.  The crunchiness of the tempura mixed with the sweet and tangy sauce really elevates this appie.  The Kona burger was really delicious with the added grilled pineapple.  Grilled fruits is always delicious but it tastes so much better in a burger.  I wouldn't have it any other way. The sangrias were really delicious with the generous amount of fruits and red wine mixture. You can feel how quickly it cools you down when sitting on the patio in +30 degrees temperature.  The only downside is that they don't offer a white wine variety.  The patio wasn't as busy at noon on a Friday.  It makes getting a table a lot easier for a group of 8 which is a wonderful perk!"}
{"text":"I have been to this oj's quite a few times and every time I have been there it has been consistently good from the food to the waitresses and I have had almost everything on there menu, it's a great place to go in the summer to just sit on the deck have a beer and some apps and relax with friends or a good place for you and the lady to go for dinner overall with how consistent they are with food and service I will give them 3 stars"}
{"text":"OJ's is a good spot in the neighbourhood.  It's worth checking out."}
{"text":"We where for a large charity event and the staff absolutely worked it and exceeded expectations. The place was full and service was great we had the Greek ribs and lettuce wraps both came without delay and tasted great. We will definately return."}
{"text":"My Wife and I had plans to meet another couple there for some drinks and conversation. We had some time to kill so we went in early to eat dinner. 

It was fairly busy when we showed up because of the Flames game that was on, but we were seated in a large booth right away. Our server came by and took our drink order and I kid you not, our drinks arrived in a minute. It was the fastest I have ever received a drink from this type of establishment.  Our server did a great job and our glasses were never empty for too long. Kudos to her!

We ordered our meals and the food came out promptly. The meal was good, and is exactly what I would expect from an OJ's. 

Overall, it was a great experience and we will be heading back!"}
{"text":"They've got $5 tasty Caesars on Sundays! Oh... You'd like to know more?

They're an \"approachable to everyone\" kind of pub. Not too offensive and not too boring. But what they do they do pretty well.

Well they've a nice patio along Kensington avenue for you to enjoy those caesars on. The patio has a slat pergola roof that does a decent job of breaking up the sunlight to give you some shade. These slats serve double duty as there are a bunch of heaters hooked to them to keep you warm and happy in the cooler evenings. If you're not feeling the fresh air there are plenty of booths inside, many that have got a good view of one of the many TV's hanging around. It's got that usual Calgary Sports Bar feel to it, but that's just fine by me.

I was here with some friends on the final day of Stampede and we were not interested in making decisions for ourselves so we put our faith in our server and asked her what we should order. She recommended the Sgt. Peppers or the Kona burger. Done! We got 'em both.

 Thank you for the suggestions, they were delish. The Kona (giant beef patty with a grilled pineapple ring, red onions and some extra Hawaiian flare) was fantastic and the Sgt. Peppers (bunch of banana peppers and a pepper sauce too, I believe) looked pretty darn scrumptious as well!

You get LOTS of food here.  All of us opted for lighter sides like the quinoa salad or house salad, but still noone finished their meals."}
{"text":"Outstanding place, people drinks and fun especially the manager Emma who was so cordial to our group! A must try place!!!"}
{"text":"Never again! We went with a group and all we received was attitude from the waitress and the manager. Manager comes over stating \"I hear there is a problem here\" all we wanted was service and food. Was that to much to ask?"}
{"text":"Never even been here, but after this report, I wont go to another location ever.

{"text":"One of the few places on Stephen Ave where you can get a bottle of wine for under $40.00. I drop by with work friends and always enjoyed the food. My picks: chicken lettuce wraps, calamari, and Kim Crawford Sauv Blanc. For the price, you can't do much better in the downtown core."}
{"text":"One star is stretching it....unfortunately I can't pick zero stars. 
Horrible! I didn't even make it past the hostess station. My boyfriend and I walked in and weren't sure if we were to wait to be seated or not as there wasn't a sign stating either way. A girl started walking towards us from the bar and said something....it was loud and we couldn't hear her so she literally yelled \"anywhere you want!\"
We both immediately walked out. 
I will never give my money to a place that treats customers this way. I usually go to the OJ's further down MacLeod near heritage Dr and have always had great service. I will continue to go there....and will absolutely never recommend this location."}
{"text":"Joes is always the best place to go , good food and awesome drinks. It's a little dark to see the menu."}
{"text":"Nice to have a neighborhood pub nearby. I enjoy the craft brews, and the food is tasty, but a little overpriced.  The jambalaya is good, but even better if you ask for additional heat. The nacho's are generous and tasty.  The kitchen staff seem talented, and the servers are friendly.  It is a bit of a problem hearing conversation over the volume of the TVs especially during sports events of any kind.  For a while, they had a bartender who was constantly feeling up the some of the servers, which made some of the female patrons uncomfortable, but he seems to be gone now.  Convenient, good tasty and generous portions.  Good overall experience."}
{"text":"Food was so so and very expensive.  Service was crap. I would not return since the service was terrible."}
{"text":"First time at this location and had a good time with the wife. Made it for wing day which starts earlier then most and was happy. Missed the waitresses name but she was awesome. Good wings, good price, nice place."}
{"text":"Wings were awesome, beer was good. We came after work and felt a little out of place and kind of like we should have chose the patio. If you don't have any dirt under your fingernails your golden but maybe not the place to meet up with the buddies after a long day."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Waitress, hostess and the lady who served us. Can't stand ppl who think they going to get tipped with non existent service. Waitress took off when one of the ladies in our group asked her to skip her first so that someone in our group who knew what they wanted could go first. Then I had to wave her down to get our order down. Then she asked if there was something wrong with the service. Well obviously if you didn't get a tip! Won't be going there again."}
{"text":"OJ's doesn't always get the credit it deserves, mostly because there are a few franchises around. In this case the location in Kensington is pretty darn good. The food is quality and tasty and they have no issue with special requests (I know this because my brother is a vegan).

Their beer selection is quite good, and they often have drinks specials. The glasses always come out clean and the taps are cleaned frequently. It's the perfect place to have a few drinks during the summer or watch the game in the less-than-patio-weather months.

Give it a shot, I doubt you'll regret it."}
{"text":"Great food, great place to spend an afternoon with friends! I had a grilled cheese burger, and a queso fundido as a start."}
{"text":"Another hidden secret in the SE! I'm loving having this pub so close to home - not crowded or overly noisy, good food with healthy choices, fast service. I really enjoy coming here before a movie or hockey game for a quick bite to eat - never have to worry about slow service, not getting a table, etc."}
{"text":"SO happy when there is a vegetarian option besides pasta or salads. Had the quinoa mushroom burger and had a choice of 2 sides and was able to have veges and dip and sweet potato fries. It was so tasty and filling. I would absolutely eat here again the next time I'm visiting Calgary. Everyone I was with were happy with their meals. Also our waitress was very attentive. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I have made the mistake of going here twice in the last month. I arrived, sat at the bar and was greeted with a simple hello. It was then ten minutes before the bar tender stopped doing glassware and asked if I would like anything. I asked for a beer and a menu, both of which took far too long. I then had to get his attention again after having my menu closed for a while, felt like doing dishes was more important to him then taking care of guests. I ordered the veggie burger and proceeded to wait, and wait and wait. Luckily the football game was on so it wasn't too bad but my friend and I noticed it was 45 minutes before getting my food. The food came out, and the bun was cold and the fries were soft and cold, yummy. Ate the food, paid my bill, which took a while because the bar tender was off and the manager was now washing glassware and left, next time I want a pint and some football I am sticking to Fergus and Bix, which was closed that day."}
{"text":"Marda Loop is a such a high-density, quasi-yuppy area of Calgary, that many of my live in.  I also had a condo for a number of years in Bankview, back in the days when I loved living in a high-density area. 

Therefore, I am no stranger to Original Joe`s, since it has been sitting in Marda Loop for a long time.  

I have reviewed a few Original Joe`s, simply because I know what to expect from them, so they are a comfortable place to go if I am just meeting a friend for a quick drink to catch up.  I know I can always get a seat, and even though the food isn't the best out there, I know what I'm getting.

Marda Loop location specifically, I have two specific examples of why I like to support them.

1.  I have done a number of silent auctions for different charities, and they have supported me with a gift certificate on more than one occassion.

2.  I threw a suprise party for a friend of mine there in November, 2010, simply because of the proximity to where everyone was, and their staff were EXTREMELY accommodating.  Since this place is so busy, I didn't expect this level of service.  Kudos to them!"}
{"text":"Original Joe's Quarry Park opened up a stone's throw from my neighborhood of Riverbend, and I have gone about three times now.  It is so nice to have a nice place to go that is so close.  The staff are very friendly and helpful (which has been the case in any Original Joe's I have frequented) and the food is consistently great (also the same as any other Original Joe's I have frequented).

Once we had the waiters attention, our food came fast and was decent. Average pub food! No complaints here!

Then the evening entertainment had to do a sound check and holy did that ever clear the place out. The sound quality was awful, just way way way too loud, we resorted to texting each other at the table and then left. 

Terrible experience."}

{"text":"So disappointed. 5 of us Went in last week, on a Thursday evening it was pretty slow. Took our drink order, missed my husband. No big deal, when she came back we placed his drink order. 15 mins later she came back with no drink. Took our food order and brought hubby drink. 
Appy's showed, my husbands was missing. When we asked her about it she acted very inconvenienced. Food came, friend couldn't finish her burger it was terrible. She would have sent it back it our server checked on us. The fries were undercooked & bland. The calamari was so fishy.  The food & service here used to be great. Think they just gave up."}

They have a decent wine list and some days the wine is half off bottles and you can take it home! Booyah. I try different stuff off the menu all the time. My husband goes for the \"Ace\" burger every time. And yes, it's delish! Can't beat the dill dip they have with their fries!"}
{"text":"They have changed the menu, and not for the better...got rid of queso fundido and flatbreads, and replaced with shrimp tempura which sucks, and wings are now smaller and overcooked.   Good atmosphere and staff but the food has gone downhill."}
{"text":"They are not messing around here, top notch food and great service. Since they have opened I have been here with my significant other almost 10-times. Very rarely do we order out and eat-in and the same restaurant multiple times in the same month. The food is always on point with huge servings, they do not skimp here. I have been here on Friday nights, mid-week for supper and for lunch, it can get busy on weekends during dinner so plan appropriately. The manager is very polite (Yuki?) and she graciously covered our meals when we had a slight mix-up with a salad the next time we came in. I found the drinks needed a bit more attention (Caesar's were bland) but the food is the star here. I really hope the quality of food will continue on for years to come as this has become our new favorite spot."}
{"text":"Four of us stopped by for dinner on Wednesday evening. We looked at the beverage menu and liked that there only local craft beers available. The beers were offered on a special menu that isn't available on-line, so I really don't remember what we ordered. I tried a raspberry flavored beer that was refreshing and excellent.

 We ordered the Mediterranean Short Ribs as an appetizer for the table -it was listed in the menu for $10, but was being offered as a $5 special tonight.. Our dinner order was two of the Saigon Subs ($12.50 for \"roasted chicken breast, simmered in a hoisin peanut sauce with melted provolone, matchstick carrots, cucumber and chopped cilantro. served on a toasted baguette with chili garlic mayonnaise and sweet soy sauce\"), one Pacific Rim Noodle Bowl ($13 for \"an asian inspired noodle soup; with chicken, prawns and steamed vegetables simmered in a flavorful broth. served with your choice of shanghai or rice noodles\"), and for me, a Shanghai Noodle Bowl ($14.50 for pan-seared chicken or prawns and fresh cut veggies, sautéed in a spicy szechuan sauce over steamed shanghai noodles. garnished with chopped cashews and fresh pea shoots\"). 

It took s while for any of the food to come out, and when the entrees started appearing before the ribs appetizer, we figured something was not right. Our waitress apologized and said she didn't turn I the ribs order, so we cancelled it.

The food was very good, my friend that ordered the Pacific Rim Noodle Soup loved it, and we were all impressed at the mammoth size of the serving. Every square inch of the Saigon Subs were inhaled. They were served with a choice of two sides, and sides of fries, mango pasta salad, a Caesar salad and roast vegetables also disappeared.  My Shanghai Noodle Bowl was very good- six nicely cooked shrimp tossed with noodles, veggies, cashews in a savory sauce.

The atmosphere was fun, maybe a little loud with televisions showing sports all over the room. The service was good, except for the missing appetizer. Our server checked on us a lot, refilled our beverages, and was nice and friendly."}
{"text":"I'm from the US, and this was my first time at a Original Joe's.  I went with a party of ten the night before NYE.  They check for your ID when you're seated. I think it should have been checked at the door, before you are seated.

The Sweet Potato Fries with Dill Dip, and the Spinach & Sweet Potato Dip are the must-have when coming here!  The Steak Sandwich I had was good too, though it could have used more juice/sauce. I also had a mint mojito, which I've had better in the States.

The only drawback was the service and ambience.  The service was ridiculously slow... We got there at 8:30pm, and got our drinks at 9. Then waited for another 30-40 minutes for our food to arrive.  There a local band playing very loud country music, which nobody at my table enjoyed.  You had to shout out to communicate across the table. Our server was nowhere to be seen in the restaurant when we wanted to get our check...

I'd only go back for the appetizers and to try other main dishes."}
{"text":"The daily specials, gluten free options and location keep me coming back, but the food just doesn't cut it. It's enough to get down, but always seems so-so at best. The burgers come overcooked, the hummus is served with barely enough food to dip (bread or veggies), and the nachos come only covered on the first layer leaving plain chips to force down. The malted vinegar aioli dip and dill dip were raved about by my dinner mates, and the mashed potatoes were very tasty. The reason this gets a three is for the 1/2 priced bottles of wine on Thursdays, and the friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Food is 5 stars but service is more like 2-3. Had the grilled cheese burger with the brown sesame rice and fries. Very well prepared and great taste. 

Waitress are so so at best. Restaurant overall was clean and cozy."}
{"text":"I first went to Original Joe's when I was attending university in Lethbridge. Since then, Original Joe's has become prevalent in cities across Alberta. I highly suggest it checking it out. The atmosphere is easy-going, but still polished. It's not a dive-bar by any stretch of the imagination.

Back when I used to eat meat, I loved their burgers. Especially with the pasta salad as one of the sides. All sandwiches also come with two sides--with plenty of choices! It's an awesome deal!! I really enjoy the food, and it's a great place to chill out and enjoy a drink and meal with friends. I've never felt rushed to leave, despite sometimes lingering for several hours."}
{"text":"You know the food is always good at OJs. The variable is usually the service. This afternoon we took in a lunch at OJ Quarry Park. About six tables of diners there, we sat outside on the patio. Very nice seats. 
The service was acceptable but scarce. When I say acceptable I mean the bare minimums like a diner counter.  And when I say scarce I refer to when I came in from the patio I was standing in the middle of the restaurant and no one was there. No one!  No bar tender, no wait staff, no one!  Strange feeling. Don't know where they all were. 
The food tasted good as it always does but the old fry with my wings and the old, darkened celery show a sign that they don't care as much as they should when serving $12 wings. Maybe some will say I'm picky but these small things tell me a lot about bigger attitudes.  A chef I know would be horrified if the old food floating in the deep fryer ended up on a plate. But then again, he would not let it go out like that. 
Keep an eye on OJs. They are a successful operation in several locations in Calgary and should hold themselves to a better standard. 
Side note:  I ordered a dish to take with us for someone at home hoping to place the order just before we left so it would be warm by the time I got home 2 block away. I told the server my plans but she brought it out when we still had half our food to eat!  It sat there on the table for 45 minutes while we finished our meals and conversation.  This made me feel they didn't really care what I was doing they just wanted to close the bill out.  Nothing about the wait staff said \"glad you are here\" or \"hope you will be back\"."}
{"text":"Came with 5 other people. Server came over to say hello, then ran away. Came back 15 mins later to take drink order. Drinks took 15 mins to come. 30 mins from sitting down till getting a single sip. Burger was burnt. Be careful reading tiny print, in low light, on menu. Most sides cost extra."}
{"text":"Original Joes (OJs) in Kensington delivers a similar experience you'd expect to receive at any OJs location. Good food, casual atmosphere and fair prices. I'd describe OJs as more of an upscale pub or gastropub for those who have never been. One of my favorite things about OJs is you get to choose 2 sides with the majority of their entrees! Lots of food and no more having to choose one side over another! OJs draught selection is a bit lacking and their bottle selection isn't the best, but the prices are good and the house draught is actually decent. The daily specials OJs has are worth while and they're also good with seasonal offers for both food and drinks.

On my most recent visit I ordered from their \"Summer Fresh menu\" and chose the Mediterranean Chicken Wrap. It was a nice change from the norm with a good balance of flavors from a little bit of spice in the chicken and naan, to a nice offset by the tzatziki. I also got a side of their industrial strength Chicken Wings which are on sale on Tuesdays, I handle my heat well so they were enjoyable, about a 6.5-7/10 for spiciness IMO. For my drink I tried their \"Guest on Tap\" special which was a Grapefruit Lager, wasn't my favorite. As for service, our server was good and on point, no complaints there. 

You'll have to do street parking at this location, but there is nearby angle parking and a private lot if It's too busy. A big draw to this location for me is their patio, Kensington doesn't have great patios but this one is bigger, heated and right on Kensington road. 

Everything considered, I'd definitely recommend OJs in Kensington if you're looking for a slightly upscale pub experience a bit above the usual Kensington offerings. Definitely a 4/5, but not quite the wow of a 5/5."}
{"text":"Walking home from work on Tuesday following the long weekend and saw their happy hour sign.  Why yes I think I will stop in for something to extend my long weekend feeling.

Service on the patio was prompt and friendly.  We unfortunately just missed Happy Hour, it was 6:03 but there was $1.00 off Alberta pints, cans and bottles so we didn't feel like we were too hard done by.  It was also wing night 4.99 for an order and they were decent sized wings with lots of sauce.  We also shared the fish tacos which came with a side so plenty of food for the two of us and a reasonable bill for a last minute stop with dinner on the way home.  

This is one of my favorite patios in the area.  Its a good size, nice seating and it's not too loud despite being right on Kensington Rd."}
{"text":"horribly service. slow kitchen. took us 30 min to be seated although they said 10. they have no hostess. another 30 to order and another 30 to get our food. appies came w the meal. no one checked up on us till we were nearly finished eating. only reason they get an extra star is because my wings were hot"}
{"text":"This is the McLeod Trail version...
Had the Butter Chicken, its a good size meal and fairly tasty. Half decent price. My complaint here isn't the food or service, but just that it is so loud.
Other than that its close to the Wingate Hotel (a good stay) and they have lots of drafts.

Back to the Butter Chicken, I wish the sauce\chicken was to the side and there was enough sauce to dip but overall it was still a nice dish. I'd be back."}
{"text":"Not a whole heck of a lot to say about this location.  It looks decent inside and is comfortable.  The food is pretty good, but if it's busy both food quality and service drop.  It's a shame but has been consistent with the multiple times I've been to this spot.  I'll only go during slow times now."}
{"text":"If you love pub food you will probably love this place. It's not my cup of tea because I don't like pub food but with that in mind it's good quality and hearty sized for the price. The pub is trendy while still being like every other pub too. For those of you that can drink they have plenty to offer."}
{"text":"I'm torn with these guys. Upon my first visit I had a great experience. The food was great and the service was good (but could have been better). On my second visit the other day, the food was poor and the service not much better.

Back in January when I came here for the first time I came in for lunch on a Sunday afternoon. I had a caesar to start which was delicious. For my meal I went with the grilled cheese burger and chose the tomato and bacon soup as my side which was part of their seasonal winter menu. The food was great.

A couple nights ago I came in with friends to grab dinner before heading to a Yelp event. It was a Monday so they had their house beer on special for $5 along with beef tacos for $2. The beer was good, not the greatest, but I can't really complain. For dinner I ordered a few beef tacos and the french onion soup. The soup was mediocre. The cheese on top was barely melted and no crunch on top like you usually get with this soup. The tacos were not good. They were cold and flavourless and mostly lettuce. For $2 a taco I feel like I shouldn't complain but they're just that bad.

Now what's really dragging down my review is the service. I'm not sure if its because I've come outside of peak hours or if they've had a lot of turnover but the service has not been that great on both visits. Overall it just seems to be a lack of experience. On Monday night we had a couple different people coming by our table and each one just didn't have to seem that polish that you would expect from basic table service."}
{"text":"The new menu is actually really good, If you haven't been to OJ's for a few years its worth another shot.  I wasn't a fan of the old menu it was all fried and greasy.  The new menu is actually really good!  I'll be going back!"}
{"text":"Apparently my 4 week \"minor\" isn't allowed inside incase we were going to feed her a double vodka slime. Hello Keg! Sitting inside the bar area, yes the bar area where our month old daughter will just sit and sleep in her covered car seat not bothering a single sole. Wow."}
{"text":"Sat down and was immediately greeted by our waitress. We told her the kinds of drinks that we wanted and she provided us with her favourite twists on them, we both ordered her suggestions and they were both thoroughly enjoyed. The food was well timed. The bread served with the bruschetta was soft as opposed to crunchy and it made it more enjoyable. It reminded me of pizza. In a good way. I like that you can order 2 sides with your entree and the fact that you can substitute soy chicken is great for vegetarians like myself. Finally we finished with dirt pie (half size) it was just the right amount and delicious to boot. Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time tonight. It was fairly busy, although there were still tables left here and there. It's loud inside. Pub loud, but with the live music, almost intolerably loud. I would suggest sticking to the patio (especially when it's nice out), if you can.

The service is alright. The food is alright. I shared the fish tacos and a Desperados pizza (bbq chicken, onions, three cheeses) with a friend and that was certainly more than enough for both of us.

Overall, it's your standard fare. Would I come back? If somebody else suggested it, maybe. I hear OJ's chicken wings are good so likely a wing night sometime in the future."}
{"text":"We visit here a quite few times and find something wrong sometimes, but basically OK.
Foods are good, staffs are fine as usual. Sometimes we needed to ask a new drink because cups have lip mark.. needed to ask new fries because they were too hard to chew. Sometimes they made us wait like 10 minutes without menu or asking drinks. not a bad place though. probably depends on how busy they are or who serves you"}
{"text":"Original Joe's was never a regular stop for me, despite living in Kensington.  This has nothing to do with the establishment, it's people, or the food and beverages they serve.  It's simple distance, as there were a few other restaurants/bars closer to my apartment.

However, having lived in Kensington for over 3 years, there was no shortage of infrequent visits.  I found they tended to draw in a younger crowd than some of the neighboring locations, specifically at night.  During lunch, however, they are quite popular with the adjacent businesses and thus draw an older crowd.

The few times that I ate there, the food was very good.  Their menu is nothing ground breaking, but what they do offer tends to be prepared very well.  The beer selection is impressive, as they have several items available on draft that you might not find elsewhere.  They are also one of the few places I've been to in Calgary that run the tap for a second or two before placing the glass underneath; very important in clearing out stale beer from the pipes.  I can't comment too much on the service though, as all of my visits were attached to the bar (is that a bad sign?)"}
{"text":"Looking for a nice summer patio to have apps and cold drinks in a hot evening? Well, Original Joe's has a really nice patio outside with some pretty good food to go along with it. 
Haven't been to Original Joes since the Red Mile days and I'd have to say... I was quite impressed with the service, drinks, and food selection. 

Everyone in our party of 7 liked their food and we all enjoyed our dinner on their relaxing outdoor patio.

A great evening with friends and good food. I would recommend trying this place out if your looking for something new and tasty."}
{"text":"Just barely a 3 if it wasn't for virtually the server Jody Vance's look-alike sister lol, and not just for the eyeglasses.

It's so so narrow, almost like a long hall but in a way, great for ppl mingling I suppose.

Probably the only quiet spots are right at the front or way deep in the back.  Washrooms are a bit of an ordeal, after fighting through the tables, then it's a flight down the stairs, as well as a low ceiling but I'll digress again.

Ordered the usual California cobb salad, a sure winner when you need some greens.  Didn't come with as much candied pecans as I'm used to.  Avocado very fresh, the highlight.

Amex yes."}
{"text":"The food was pretty damn good as always. The dill dip is pretty much one of the best things ever invented for your fries. Service was a little swamped so slow at times but to be expected when busy. My ONLY complaint is the lighting is way to dark. At least let me see the food I am about to eat plus when you walk outside after a meal and it's dark but seems brights that's not a good thing lol..

  Got blitzed in the parking lot before we went in making the meal totally awesome! If your munchkin hard. Get them fingers and fries!"}
{"text":"The food at OJ's Aspen Landing is always delicious and comforting. I just wish it weren't so crowded all the time. It can get very noisy and there isn't a lot of room to move around. The service is always very good though."}
{"text":"I have visited this restaurant before and was really happy with the food and service. They had some great priced specials tonight but we can see why. The food lacked seasoning specifically the fish tacos. We won't be back there are a lot of choices out there."}
{"text":"OJ's, what's happened to you?
I used to love you, depend on you, crave you.
Now look at ya. So disappointed in how you've grown up.
I'm taking out my frustrations on the chain restaurant as a whole based on my experience at this newish location.
My friend and I got there just in time for happy hour - whoo hoo! We quickly ordered glasses of white wine and each ordered a $4 fish taco of the HH menu.
The wine was great - a nice crisp refreshing house wine. The \"fish\" tacos, however, BOO. We couldn't even identify if it was fish. I think they scraped the bottom of the pan to give us the leavings. And the rest of the taco had no flavor.
We told the waiter what we thought, and in fairness to the restaurant they comped our tacos. Hence the second star they are receiving.
We then ordered the dragon boat lettuce wraps and sweet potato fries instead.  We didn't eat much of the wraps - waaaay too much hoisin sauce and very little chicken. But the flavor was ok and there were a decent amount of veggies in there, so a C+ rating. The sweet potato fries were good but I think their pepper shaker lid came off when they were seasoning them - most of the fries were almost completely covered in black powder, which was a bit disappointing.
Our server was very busy but still very good. The space is weird - tons of stairs to get in the door and you feel like you've entered an apartment building, and the restaurant is quite small. 
I'd like to give this place 2.5 stars, so I waffled between 2 and 3 but to be honest I won't go back so it's gettin' a 2 from me. sorry."}
{"text":"Half price wine on Thursdays. That's pretty much all you need to know. Gather some friends. Drink several bottles. Be amazed by a $20 tab."}
{"text":"Checking out this place as we had a coupon for free wings.  We first arrived there were not many people in the restaurant.  As we were there the restaurant got a rush. The location is pretty big in a popular mall area. 

The food and service was good.  We ordered 3 pounds of wings.  BBQ, teriyaki and sweet chili.  We also. Ordered a healthy bowl and Two of the original dogs. The hot dogs came with two polish sausage in a French bread.  They were huge portions."}
{"text":"Not sure what happened to this place but they need to be checked by the health service. Myself and friends the past few times had issues after eating here so the food must have been expired or sometimes. Unless the work with dirty hands in the kitchen no idea. But it was 6 ppl and all of us got sick. The following week my friend went with her college and both of them got sick again"}
{"text":"I remember when Original Joe's first opened. I had just moved to Calgary and was working with one of the Franworks partners. They had one restaurant at the time. It's been awesome watching them grow and expand across Western Canada.

My one dislike about Original Joe's is that they do not allow kids. Ever. Unfortunately they lose business over this (and not just mine) as my family will go to the pubs for dinner that do allow kids until 8 or 9pm. In this economy it is a bad business choice IMO.

But moving on. A new OJ's has opened not far from where we live. So hubs and I had an hour w/out kids one Saturday afternoon and decided to pop in. 

The decor is gorgeous. Franworks has their own contractor for their restaurants and I must say they do amazing work. 

There were a handful of people in the restaurant so we were able to pick the table we wanted. We sat next to the large floor to ceiling window that almost over looks the Deerfoot and you can even see Nose Hill Park in the distance (less than a 10 minute drive). Service was friendly and quick.

We weren't overly hungry so ordered a couple of the on tap beers along with our wings and parmesan chips. There were tv screens playing different sports games for those who were interested. It's not a huge space but a cute one for sure. And note it is upstairs above Smashburger.

Like the location, everything was spot on, we will return."}
{"text":"I've been frequenting Original Joe's for over 10 yrs following some consulting work I did for their parent company early on.  From a distance I've enjoyed watching the company grow and never had a bad meal or experience at any of their locations.

We've become regulars recently at this particular location since we started dropping our kids at an activity nearby and have just under an hour to ourselves before we have to pick them up.  A married kind of speed date on Friday evenings if you will.  Friday's are typically busy here so if we are lucky we squeeze in and sit at the bar where we can enjoy a brewski, sometimes a bite and a chat with bartender Dan.

Since we are limited for time we never have a full meal.  So far we've had bits & bites in the form of..wings...poutine...queso fundido and bruschetta.  Also loving the Wild Rose they have on tap. 

The service is always quick, reliable and friendly.  They know our time is limited and are always accommodating....these are things that keep us coming back."}
{"text":"I just want to say this was one of the best places to cure an insatiable hangover one Sunday morning after a night of hardcore laughter, dancing and drinking.

I believe we all crawled out of bed the next morning at approximately 11 am starving of course, with that all too familiar dry mouth taste and the need for fresh coffee and some comfort food.  And OJ's was just the answer.  

We took over a lovely patio seating of 4 and it was perfect place to settle our stomachs but still have a bit of a view of the passersby's and take advantage of the sun.  

Our waitress was great, small on words and big on getting our food to us, coffee was quietly poured and fresh orange juice was served and before we knew it, our Breakfast platters were in front of our not so attractive morning after faces.  

I had the Eggs Benny with home cut fries and it was delicious; ham, spinach, the perfect amount of hollandaise sauce and a good morning brew, slowly but surely cut away that morning after feeling.

What my friends ordered was honestly pretty much a blur, but I do know that they were incredibly satisfied and it wasn't too long before we were back on our feet again only to head to the Kensington side to eat ice cream. 

OJ's the perfect breakie place for me, good portions, great service and good prices."}
{"text":"Great selection of food without getting overly fancy. There are many gluten free options, the food is very consistant, and the staff is pretty nice. The pricing on the food is a great value, and portion sizes are filling. One of the only places I'll eat out at in Calgary."}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed in this place. Friendly staff and reasonable prices, it's usually crowded enough to be fun, but never too packed."}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed this place, provided that you keep your expectations realistic. It's a fairly priced place to get drinks and steak sandwich or burgers, the staff are always friendly and the good thing is that on busy weekends where all other pubs are full, I have always managed to find a seat in OJ's somehow!
Try their steak sandwiches."}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed in this place. Friendly staff and reasonable prices, it's usually crowded enough to be fun, but never too packed."}
{"text":"I had lunch at this location with my mom on Friday afternoon. It was fairly quiet being early and somewhat of a rainy day, we were seated and tended to by a really friendly waitress. She seemed to be flustered and forgot a few things, but nothing that stood out or bothered me too much. I ordered the Salmon Club & my mom had the Steak Sandwich, both came out quickly and tasted good. I'm not a huge fan of the sides at OJ's, they don't taste freshly prepared, but rather store bought. However for the price, we did get a lot of food, so it wasn't bad. OJ's will never be my first choice, but it was definitely nothing to complain about."}
{"text":"My mom and I had a late lunch here on a weekday afternoon. Since we were in the plaza already and starving, we decided on OJ's. I've been to many other locations before, usually only for drinks, and to be honest I have never really noticed this one! It's tucked in a corner of the plaza and smaller than other locations. We decided to sit on the patio since it was a beautiful day. The service was quite good, we were seated quickly and looked after by a lady who was very friendly. We both ordered margaritas, and I had the salmon club while my mom had the fish tacos. The food was good - I actually really liked that you could pick two sides instead of just the standard one side. However, the sides left much to be desired. I opted for the mango pasta salad (don't ask me why) and it really wasn't good. My sandwich hit the spot though, and my mom seemed to enjoy her meal. I really have no complaints, other than the food is just 'average' and there are tons of places I would rather go before I would come back here. Sorry OJ's!"}
{"text":"The hubby and I have ordered a couple items from here off the skip the dish app and this place has yet to disappoint. First of all they will deliver cookies and milk right to your door! I could have stopped there and been happy!! But we've also had the dragon boat lettuce wraps, which we fight over, butter chicken, to die for, and the truffle Parmesan potato crisps which are a great starter. Can't wait to try more stuff! Haven't gone into the restaurant yet, but using skip the dish to have this food delivered to our hotel has been amazing!

{"text":"I've only been to the Quarry Park location once and it was  meh ok. The food was good and they had football on every T.V., but the service was slow and it's priced the same as trendier, more convenient locations. I would go again but next time with tempered expectations. I would recommend to others though cause O.J.'s every else is solid and eventually this location will bring it's game up to the standard.
15/30"}
{"text":"This location has been many things over the years. It's most successful incarnation appears to be OJ's as it's been this for quite a while now. To be honest, out of all the OJ's in the city this one is my least favorite. I don't really know what it is. The food is ok, the service isn't horrible, and it doesn't ever seem to be too busy so seating is barely an issue. When I go in there it just seems like a really big pub, which in normal circumstance wouldn't be a bad thing, but I guess for it being OJ's I expect a little more. If you're down south it's not a bad option, just don't expect them to deliver the \"wow\" factor.

Its pub food at its best and they're consistent between cities.  If you're on the road and don't know where to get some grub, stop in at an Original Joe's.  The burgers are especially good, and you can take in the game on the big screens while you're at it."}
{"text":"The service is great I've been here twice both times I had a fantastic meal. Their menu is very broad and their staff is great! I love the cheddar ale soup I've had it both times I've been here. It's overall a great experience in a relaxing atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Two stars because this place fits the yelp description of 2 stars perfectly. Meh, I've experienced better. Our server was inattentive and while I was happy there were bear specials going on it took forever to get our drinks, food, and bill. I actually had to ask three times to get the proper cutlery to eat my food. A little frustrating but I feel like it's your typical pub."}
{"text":"Underwhelming experience. The lounge was darker and the servers inattentive. The food seemed average and the ambiance was nothing thrilling but I guess that's what happens when you go to a chain restaurant. This place seemed quite large which is good - it can house a lot of people. I will give them credit, their fish tacos are particularly good."}
{"text":"It's 9 pm on a Friday. The pub down the street is full of people watchin' a fight. We need food. OJ's has our back. It's crowded, but there are still a couple of tables free. We grab one and wait for another friend to arrive.

The server is right on things, stopping by our table within minutes to let us know the drink specials and bringing us some menus. She's chatty and neighbourhoodly. What does neighbourhoodly mean? Not snooty, not dressed in an uber cleavagey shirt with a mini skirt. She's a normal person. I appreciate that.

House pints are on special. I order a blonde (what is it with me and blondes anyway?) and the cajun chicken cheddar burger. What I like about OJ's-all OJs' in fact-is automatically getting two sides with my burger. This time round I choose a salad and some mashed taters. Portions are big, but I inhaled that burger faster than a Dyson after a hair ball.

OJ's is OJ's. Dependable food, typically dependable service, usually not so crowded you can't find a place to sit, but not usually deserted. Menu's decent, price is right. What else can I say?"}

Food and service are amazing!"}
{"text":"Hard to comment because we've now been sitting here, 2 beers in and no entrees....
Fish tacos appys were good....when they showed up an hour in...
What can I say?"}
{"text":"This is actually one of my preferred locations for Original Joe's.

The favorite one was on 4th street, but this on 130th is an absolutely good choice.

Number one reason for that, from my perspective, is a manager of this place. Admire this guy! Absolute situational awareness, always super-helpful, seeing every little detail, immediately responding whenever needed, bringing plates and helping with take-out. Five star dude, seriously.

Rest of the staff is generally friendly and helpful, kitchen works fast, food quality is good.

Original Joe's menu is reasonably ample, with a good variety to choose from. Beer selection is not that shiny, but there is enough good stuff to drink.

Lots of cozy corners, generally well-planned floor, and almost flawless take-out. The only time they've messed it up was immediately corrected, with extra plate added as an apology - much appreciated, good job.

Recommended? Absolutely! Glad I have this location nearby."}
{"text":"Came here with a bunch of friends Sunday afternoon, and ran into another group of friends. We wanted to join forces and the servers were very accommodating. Everyone enjoyed their food. The server recommended a soup to my friend and he said it changed his life. I was very impressed with my shrimp tacos. Always a positive experience with a group of friends at this OJs!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious, there was plenty of variety in their menu. The service was good and we were well looked after."}
{"text":"My friend and I went on a busy Friday night so we did expect to wait. Took 25-30 minutes to get a table and we had to wait in the front entry entry which was a bit crowded, they don't really have a waiting area. But when someone left and paid BOOM the tables were cleaned and we were sat down almost immediately.

Our server was good. Our choice cider was not available on this day but the server recommended something similar. Our nachos were delicious and had corn chips that are good for my gluten intolerant friend. The wings were great but only received 9 for $10, which is supposed to be a full pound. Wish there were more.

All in all the atmosphere is nice and you can tell the staff works very hard."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Original Joe's for a few years now, and I visit the Kensington and Marda Loop locations as well now and then, though Northland is our preferred restaurant.

Originally I was going to give 4 stars, but have now dropped to 3 due to some small changes made since around Christmas.  The menu got updated and if I remember the old prices correctly, many of the items went up about $1, which isn't much considering that the cost of labour and ingredients have gone up in the last couple of years.  However, at the same time the food portions have gotten smaller.

In the past, I would never be able to finish an order of the Double Dog or Pulled Pork Sandwich with the 2 sides on my own, even for a dinner meal.  Having visited them just recently, I polished off most of my meal along with an appetizer of chicken wings.  One of the reasons could be the fact that they replaced all their plates with new, more clean and modern looking white ones that look like they are from 2011 rather than a 1980s family diner, but they are considerably smaller.  Still, for $11-15 you could get a very decent meal that is hardly expensive when it comes to sit down restaurants.

The one change that really bugged me though, is the change of buns they used for Joe's Double Dog.  They used to use a soft, sweet roll that I rarely find in other restaurants, and my friends and I love it.  But gone are those days as it is now replaced by a very boring, standard white roll that is not as soft or tasty as it's counterpart.  A couple of times, we found the bread to be dry or overly toasted.  Double Boo.

Some of the dishes are hit and miss, depending on your personal taste and expectations.  For appies we've only had the sweet potato fries and chicken wings.  Both have been great, and the sweet potato fries are a must even if you don't order it to share as an appy, order it as a side to your meal and pay that extra $1.99.  It's worth it.  The wings we had in salt and pepper, honey garlic, and dill pickle were happily consumed by our table without any complaints.

The salads are only so so.  Having tried 3 of the 6 or so they offer, I can't really say any stand out as a recommendation.  The sandwiches and wraps are a good deal as they come with 2 sides, and you could pick a salad as one of them instead.  Stay away from the philly cheesesteak or beefdip sandwich, as it's always dry and tough no matter how many times we try it.  The pulled pork sandwich and double dog seems to be popular with my family and friends.  The wraps are decent and filling.  The steak sandwich is not too bad though it's not steakhouse quality, but that's a given.

The restaurant is at a good location with plenty of parking on weekends and evenings.  A relatively safe and quiet neighbourhood close to Northland Mall, with a Royal Bank next door.  Not much ambience inside, though clean with plenty of TVs for those following any games that might be on at the time.  Service varies, sometimes it's great and sometimes half hearted.  Don't order the cranberry juice unless you honestly don't want to drink anything else.  It's almost $3.50 and is majorly watered down.

{"text":"I'm glad we stopped  here! Excellent  food and great service.  The brussel  sprouts are the best!"}
{"text":"This is a great little pub, very friendly and attentive servers, so good as a stand alone pub. But holy cow, the calamari here is amazing!  I'm from Newfoundland and don't usually get seafood in Alberta but we got some as a snack and I have to say it was some of the best I've ever had. The hummus was pretty spectacular too!"}
{"text":"I've only been here a few times, this afternoon included.  I've never had any complaints and our server today was definitely on the ball.  OJ's has a very inexpensive house wine, which is a treat compared to other restaurants.  I like that the outdoor patio is far enough off of the road that you don't feel like you're eating dirt or yelling over traffic, despite the nearby intersection which can get pretty busy.  It's clean, casual and you can park during the daytime without having to pay.  What else does one need from a neighborhood pub?"}
{"text":"This is a nice neighborhood pub whose best feature is that it's walking distance from our house. Someone described it as \"approachable\" and that's a good adjective. It's not too hipster, not too divey. It's a nice upscale gastropub with terrific food, good service and nice drink selection. I didn't realize it was a chain, it's run like a neighborhood mom & pop pub. Winner."}
{"text":"The food was good.  Fish tacos were tasty although overloaded with lettuce.   Drinks were average but they worked.  Apparently there is a shortage of napkins because we only found one with our silverware.  The waitress must have undergone oral surgery and although we didn't see her cheeks filled with cotton she wasn't doing a great job of being social with the patrons.    She was definitely more interested in something other than our table.   We come for the experience, but enjoyed the conversation amongst ourselves... Hint... Eat at home.   

Bottom line:  food good, Service not so much."}
{"text":"I ate there a couple weeks ago with my husband and it took some time for the server to get to us. She explained that they were short staffed, and she was slammed (understandable). We placed our orders, and I had informed her of my severe nut allergy. She told me she'd let the kitchen know and it would be safe for me to eat. I usually had good experiences with Original Joes. The food came out and looked delicious. We were very hungry (the food was fairly timely), and we started to eat. Within about 15-20 minutes, I started to have an allergic reaction. I stopped eating, and my husband attempted to get the bill so we could leave as quickly as possible. As the server was busy, it took her some time.  I explain to her that I am in the beginning phases of an allergic reaction to something in the food, and she then tells me that they could not guarantee the prevention of cross contamination with nuts. This was after I had ordered food, informed her, and eaten the food I thought was safe. I told her while I was leaving that it is good to know those things before I order because it could mean the difference between life and death for some people.  I was horrifically ill that night and survived (and was lucky). But this place is not nut-allergy friendly. Be careful, fellow allergy sufferers!"}
{"text":"A few weeks ago we noted the brunch for $5 sign and thought we should hit OJ's after church at Commons. Today was the day and on our way back from coffee we stopped in. The $5 gets you a plate full of food including hash browns?, toast, egg, ? and bacon. As keto friendly people the restaurant accommodated? our need by replacing the toast and hash browns with a generous serving of fresh sliced tomatoes. The food was fresh and delicious?. The portions were generous, especially for $5. This may become our summer hang out place after church, it is fantastic. Service was excellent too."}
{"text":"Pacific noodle soup. Usual with chicken, shrimp and chilli sauce rice noodles.  I'm allergic to shrimp, so they make it without, which makes for a lot of broth.  And not much chicken.  Makes a good partner with the Wraspberry ale but meets more protein."}
{"text":"We came here for Sunday brunch today. 

the reason they get such a low rating is we were served mouldy fruit and you could tell that the fruit had been sitting for some time it was dried out and gross. Totally ruined my experience here. Be careful what you order.

After the fact it took about 15 minutes for the waitress to come back with our bill. And guess what! They charged us for our extra mouldy fruit skewer!!!

The manager gave us a gift card for this issue however it will probably end up in the garbage. We won't be coming back.

I would never come back here again. What a joke. If I could give them a zero I would! Make sure you check your food here."}
{"text":"been here a few times for drinks/small eats when im downtown calgary
its a friendly bar with good vibe! it's chill and all the girls working there seem nice and friendly
they just need to serve mimosas in the early pm :)"}
{"text":"We had a family get-together last night at OJ's and we had a good time. The service food and prices were great. The only thing that prevented achieving the coveted 5-star rating was were surprised by the live music. This made it challenging to talk. Would have been great to be advised of the music before we arrived. 

BTW, I had the Jalapeno Mac and Cheese with Chorizo - very tasty.

Regardless, we had a good time at dinner followed by a competitive game of darts.

We will return and look forward to the opening of OJ's in Cochrane."}
{"text":"This OJs location delivers every time I visit and they have one of the very best patio options in Kensington. 5 stars for meeting expectations without error over the past four years I've been going.

If you want to please a group, have a decent meal and a cheap beer while you watch a Flames game or sit outside for brunch, lunch or dinner, OJs is a safe bet. It's a chain, so let that be part of your expectations. I've never had anything mind-blowing here, but when I want a satisfying grilled salmon sandwich, a homey jalapeno mac and cheese and a good basic beer that doesn't cost $8 (or a half price bottle of wine!), I know I can head here.

The patio has heaters and they do a good job of often being open on those late fall and early spring days when it's sunny but would be just a bit too chilly without the heaters on. There might be a wait for the patio in summer, but I've found there's often space at the bar or in the restaurant if you don't mind waiting it out a bit.

Several staff have been there at least for the past few years, which helps things run smoothly. I've always had courteous service. Bonus: vegetarian and gluten free menus available on request."}
{"text":"We went to @originaljoes a few weeks ago.  The food they served almost killed my wife with cross-contamination with a nut allergy.  She's fine now but only after being sick and having to purge for a few hours to get the toxins out of her system.

When a restaurant can't guarantee cross-contamination they should say so right from the start (we informed her of the allergy before ordering).  When we informed our server that my wife was reacting to the food she told us they couldn't guarantee cross-contamination.  No apologies, no offer to comp us the bill, the bill even took awhile to get to us and we were in a hurry to get out of there.  Accidents happen but own up to it and make it right.

Record of Twitter conversation:

@jcruzfotodotcom:  @originaljoes my wife is suffering an allergic reaction after eating at your 4th St #restaurant #nutallergy please be more careful

@originaljoes: @jcruzfotodotcom Sorry to hear that. I hope she feels better soon. I'll let the team know.

Hopefully this was followed up and it won't happen in the future.

---Update----2014-01-20------

The area manager contacted us and sincerely apologized.  He said he would take the steps necessary to investigate and ensure this doesn't happen again which I believe they will.  They have a good track record and take this incident seriously which gives me a better feeling about going back to an Original Joe's again.

{"text":"Just ok... I didn't find anything special in this restaurant. It was not bad, but not really good. I am not going to say I will never go back there, but I would prefer to go somewhere else before going to  Original Joe's... The beef was overcooked for my taste. The service was just Ok, nothing special either. The prices are not bad. But I still prefer going to a great place, even if I have to pay more.."}
{"text":"Is not terrible for drinks.. But nothing really awesome... The appetizers are just ok, and the cocktails too... I would prefer to go to any other bar in the area... However, is not the worst place in the city.. Is just ok..."}
{"text":"A few weeks ago some friends from work and I had gone here for a lunch. There was approximately 10 of us and we had specified it was our lunch break and only had an hour. The restaurant was not busy there was only a handful of other customers in there. We ordered our food and two people had ordered appetizers. We ended up waiting and hour and a half for our food. After asking multiple times where our food was and being told it would be right out. Finally we asked for the manager she came and found out that only the two appetizers had ordered. Our main meal was still yet to be put in. They ended up covering everyone's drinks and the appetizers but still. Brutally long wait for the food which was only average."}
{"text":"Pretty standard OJ's experience here. 

The couple of times I've come with my parent's the staff have been good and the food as well. This location never seems to be exceptionally busy for dinner compared to to the one on 130th Ave that I normally frequent which can fill up some nights.

This is a good choice for the area with few dining options other than fast food and two other restaurants."}
{"text":"I thought the food was just alright. I got the eggs Benedict and felt it needed seasoning. My bf got the breakfast poutine and I'm not sure why it was called that because it really wasn't poutine.

Smash Browns are not hash browns, they are diced potatoes."}
{"text":"The Golden Tee Machine's spin button is not working. How can you expect to make nice shots without controlling your ball?

Also it was The Masters today and they wouldn't put on the TV noise so we couldn't hear the announcers. Instead it was some rap type music. 

The food and service was fine otherwise though."}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed at this location. Staff are friendly and efficient. The food never disappoints (although my salmon was a bit jerky-like today but they took it off my bill no questions asked). 

This is a great place for drinks, appies or any meal. Would recommend it any day!"}
{"text":"This Original Joe's is one of my favourites in the city.  I love the levels, the crowd and workers, and the location!

First, the levels.  There are two levels in this place.  The bottom one has most of the seating, including some looking out on Kensington Road.  This is also where the bar is situated, so it has plenty of high stools to sit on as well.  The upper level houses the pool table and a couple of big tables, for the larger groups.  This was always my favourite level because you can look down on the lower level, play pool, or just sit in the corner and not be seen at all.

Second, the crowd and workers.  I've found that people seem to be nicest at the Kensington location.  There have been a couple of times that the patrons have been super nice and we've actually had a couple games of pool with random people.  The workers are exceptionally nice, too.  They seem extra cheery and always happy to be serving people.

And lastly, the location.  I love the central location of Kensington and all the people there are to watch.  That's why I love this OJ's location.  It's great for people-watching and making new friends.

So, that's three out of three in my books!  OJ's rocks!"}
{"text":"Good eats at a mid-range price. Tacos were big, not soggy and the tortilla was fresh. Salad was a solid house mix with a light balsamic. The house branded beer was a little flat but may have had the end of a keg or a pour from a line due for a cleaning. Service was quick and spot on and did not have to wait. I'd go back."}
{"text":"Went here with some friends over the holidays. I'm ok having to wait for a table but I don't understand the set up of this place. There was a row of banquette seats with only a table for two at the end. Other than that, there was a huge open space. I'm assuming they were understaffed that night, but given it was the Thursday before Christmas, expect a busy establishment. The bartender working that night must has been new because they weren't that great in making cocktails listed on the menu. A member of my party ordered an old fashioned and had it taken back because it was just plain awful. The food was mediocre and the service was good, but I think I'll be heading to other establishments in the area."}
{"text":"Came in on a Wednesday afternoon ro kill some time. I decided to have a bit to eat. Had the Long Beach fish tacos. Gluten free of course.  There was a mistake when they came out not gluten free.  My server was on top if it she got them to remake them. Once I took my first bite I was in heaven. My fish was grilled perfectly and everything was super fresh. I will definitely be eating this again.  I kinda want to order 10 for my home but don't because I'd rather come back to see the friendly staff and enjoy these environment."}
{"text":"I love coming to Joe's! Great atmosphere and I have yet to experience bad service or food. Great music. Highly recommended for a casual beer and burg!"}
{"text":"I don't usually give bad reviews, and I have been to Original Joe's quite a few times but this particular experience was God awful. We asked for dill dip got gravy the server was not to be found anywhere within the building, the service was incredibly slow just generally speaking avoid this place at all cost the fish tacos had nose fish mostly lettuce and the tortilla was burnt"}
{"text":"This is a good place. Not just because I like it, but because it is good.

Can't count times I've been to Original Joe - like dozens and dozens - and except for some minor silly things, I was never disappointed. Nor were my friends I was inviting there.

I've tried about 70% of the menu, and everything was cooked right, never bad ingredients or sloppy work. Absolute respect to the chef and the rest of the kitchen people, very well done! Pizzas or butter chicken, jambalaya or hamburgers, pasta, steak - everything was good.

As for the drinks - I was mostly ordering wine or beer, though Joe's has a complete bar. Wine list is relatively brief, but good enough for me. Beer list is mostly local, again a bit brief, but still decent. Drinks were arriving on my table almost immediately upon ordering - thanks for that.

Kudos to the servers - they were actually recognizing us and were cheerful, polite and helpful. Overall feeling when dropping in was like \"this is my place, everyone knows me\". Excellent job, guys!

So next time in Calgary, even though I'd probably not be able to grab that gorgeous corporate condo at Destiny Suites, I will definitely pass by Original Joe's, just to feel myself at home."}
{"text":"This is the watering hole myself and my coworkers convene at after a long week's work.  The staff is generally friendly and accommodating - and patient when 10 people try to split bills.

I love the fact that they offer 2 sides with many of their entrees, as I always have to have their fries with dill dip and then something healthier so I don't feel like a terrible person for gorging on deep fried goodness on such a regular basis.

They typically get good seasonal beers in from Canadian craft brewers (Granville Island, Okanagan Springs, etc.)  And their home brews are also pretty good, their blonde is tasty.

Our staff always enjoys their half price wine bottle specials, as it makes sharing a bottle an easy choice.

Will continue to be a go-to for a quick bite, a pint, and a good time."}
{"text":"Original Joe's of 4th has become a HUGE disappointment.  Very close and convenient but with lousy service or no service at all in 4 out of the last 8 visits.  

Tonight they couldn't even bother to acknowledge us (and this has happened before - we were stupid enough to give them another chance). They were too busy paying attention to the big ticket tables.

Suggest you find a different OJs location. Or skip OJs entirely. If you decide to go - good luck"}
{"text":"Lovely day for a patio. Trads were on sale...but as usually my veggie burger tasted like crap. Its they type of patty that ruined this burger. I am Vegan so can't have veggie patties with cheese . This was a SOY patty and although there was lots of topping it was dry and nasty. I even added a ton of mustard and ketchup to juice things up..

So my suggestion is to either make your own really yummy Vegan patty or try some different brands.

Service was good. :)"}
