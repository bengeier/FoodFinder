{"text":"What a great find! The tapas are wonderful. The grilled calimari (takes 45 minutes) is so worth the wait. Order a bunch of other things and it will show up as the highlight of your meal. The quail is excellent and the chorizo was a treat. I wish we were here long enough to try more dishes. Service was excellent and very casually friendly. It was also the most affordable meal we have had in Montreal."}
{"text":"The food looked good, but the service was the absolute worst. They treat their potential customers like dirt. Really unfortunate."}
{"text":"If I was just visiting Montreal and didn't know any better, I'd walk right past this place and would not give it a second thought -- minus the wonderful smells that come out of smoke stack on the roof.  But if you want some of the best Portuguese chicken you've ever had, go here!  If you're ordering chicken, you need to give them an hours notice before picking it up.  They're an extremely busy take-out joint.  I love their pork sandwiches as well.  It's simply two slabs of pork on a big bun -- so mouthwateringly good.  I like their fries as well; small and thin and coupled with a pork sandwich or chicken you'll feel like you're in grilled meat heaven.  Heaven I tell you.  A whole chicken is around $10, pork sandwich is around $4 and fries are around $2 (if my memory serves me correctly).  Don't mind the surly Portuguese men who serve you or the mounds of people waiting for their order.  They do have a small seating area in the \"other room\" but I've always opted for take-out.  I heart Portuguese chicken."}
{"text":"Best roasted chicken of the city. Many of my friends and family who visit Montreal always pass there to order and take out. I recommend you the spicy the chicken. Last but not least, order and take out. Don't try to eat there, it's very very small, crowded and noisy."}
{"text":"Best Portuguese chicken in town. But the worst service as well. Hours vary, you have to pay cash for takeaway, interac only if you eat in (which you are supposed to know, according to the staff). Tons of attitude, they act like a bunch of gangsters ready to rumble. I hate the place but love the chicken."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and years. I loved it before they even had a dining area. In my opinion it is THE place for a bifana sandwich. Anytime I'm in town, they get a visit."}
{"text":"Super poulet cuit sur le gril, un des meilleurs à Montréal sans aucun doute. J'ai acheté le poulet entier pour apporter. Il faut réserver pour avoir un poulet bien chaud et bien juteux. Ce que je n'ai pas fait. J'y retournerai la prochaine fois pour le petit restaurant. C'est une histoire à suivre."}
{"text":"Used to be my go to place for Portugese. Service here is pretty rude and terrible, been coming here for years but yet they seem to always try and find an excuse to not let me in! I do love most of their meats though. Fries are very similar to Mcdonalds fries. If service is important to you dont come here , but if not its worth a try."}
{"text":"absolutely amazing, i dont know why am i so obsessed with their salad but man... ribs are delishhh and the chicken sandwich is also very very good... i agree that the food takes a little bit of time.  Its a family owned restaurant and no matter how long the wait is i will return because the food tastes always great. Just writing about this restaurant i am salivating."}
{"text":"Among the best portuguese chicken in town and also grilled sausages and more!!! Must try!"}
{"text":"For this trip to Montreal, it was my personal mission to find my favorite Portuguese chicken spot. And overwhelmingly my folks here recommended Portugalia. So the other night, the boo and I scheduled a dinner there.   Because of traffic and other unforeseen obstacles, we arrived a little late, but the staff was kind enough to fit us in. Part luck, part hospitality. The setup is kind of interesting: the entrance is the kitchen/take-out area, and around the corner is the dining area complete with a bar and hidden restrooms.   Because I was so intent on trying the chicken, we ordered (huh?) the ribs! I wasn't mad because they were amazing. We also ordered a mixed meat plate that included the chicken, some sausage, and a seasoned pork patty. Everything was amazing, though next time I'd get a chicken plate and a rib plate.   What sets Portugalia apart from other places is that they use a dryer seasoning and a little less grease, which to me allows one to taste the meat and char more. That being said, I would probably pick this place over others I've tried.   The service was also superb, the staff attentive and informative, and again quite accommodating based on our tardiness. I definitely recommend a reservation if you prefer to eat in, though the take out doesn't seem like a bad option neither."}
{"text":"Very poor attitude by the server, he was slow to take our order and then refused to give us a sandwich on the menu.  He said we had to order the plate instead.  Many other good places to choose from, try another."}
{"text":"Good chicken. Everything else is just noise.   Just get your food to go - there isn't much in terms of ambience."}
{"text":"My foodie boyfriend brought me here in Montreal for some good eats.  Indeed the food was excellent, but the service was lacking.  We split a chicken, fries, and a salad.  The meal was also served with delicious Portuguese bread. (The bread is the best part)....  We were seated right away and the decor is cute.  I hear the carry out is really good, but I've never tried it.  The service problem is as follows...  We wanted to order squid, but it takes 40 minutes... so we ordered chicken... it took 40 minutes.... should have ordered the squid!  We were a bit ignored as there were family members in the restaurant.  I had ordered a diet coke, but some how was served a sprite.  We also ordered coffee after our meal - that took another 30 minutes of balking just to get.    Good food, bad service!"}
{"text":"I recently read a review of this establishment in the mirror, which gave it a sub-stellar review. So I decided to give my two cents on the place.   I went after a Moroccan friend of mine recommended it to me claiming it to have well priced, well cooked, and well seasoned meat. So we gave it a shot.  Food Quality/Price - 3.5/5 I had the assorted meats which included pork, quail and beef. I was asked if I wanted in spicy, and I did so ask for it that way. I believe it was well seasoned and well cooked. The portions were ample and the prices fair.  Ambiance/Service - 4/5 I was very surprised by the ambiance and service. The unlike the mirror, I found the mural to be cute and appropriate.  And the hidden the bathrooms was a nice added charm.   Overall - B + I would definitely go back. If good cheap meat is want your after you'll get it at  Rotisserie Portugalia."}
{"text":"I had \"the Mix\": chicken, ribs and Portuguese sausages. It tastes very good."}
{"text":"The chicken is moist and delicious and there is a secret door and super chill friendly service, hence the 4 stars. But I have to be upfront and say that usually it'd be an automatic 3 stars or lower for giving me salad with kraft (or no name) 'Italian' salad dressing on it...in a restaurant...in a Portuguese restaurant. Still in this case somehow I overlook it without hesitation. Freaking delicious chicken, crispy fries, chill family friendly environment. And a secret door. 4 stars for SURE."}
{"text":"The chicken is pretty good, but the service ruins it. At the takeout counter, I ordered a sandwich at 5:50, it was ready at 6:30. Yes, it takes them 40 minutes to make a sandwich, seriously. They like to believe it's because they're popular, but in fact it's just because they're so badly disorganized, and they spend more time fooling around than actually working. Fries were cold. Salad dressing was store-bought Kraft vinaigrette. The kitchen is so dirty, you're lucky if you don't get salmonella.  There's about a dozen Portuguese restaurants in the area where they can fix you a good sandwich in less than a minute, without the attitude, and for much cheaper. So do yourself a favour and leave these clowns alone."}
{"text":"I travel to Montreal every week and this place has become one of my few staples.  The chicken and fries are fantastic (as most other places in the neighborhood are), and very consistently so.  Not a single person that I have introduced to this place wasn't eager to find another excuse to come back ASAP.  They only take cash, which is a bummer, but seems pretty standard compared to other places.  You can actually sit down and order the food like a regular restaurant OR call ahead for a delivery (usually takes about 30-45 min) and pick up.   Dining in is great, as you get the Portuguese beer, bread and olives to keep you busy as you wait for your order (grilled calamari is out of this world! but sometimes requires 40min (worth it) to heat up the grill).  These guys are straight out of Portugal and know what they are doing.  I plan on putting their chicken head to head with Romado's to see who is Montreal's true chicken champion!"}
{"text":"Really good chicken, steak, quail and lambchops. What makes it good is the real charcoal grill. The warm bread and olives they serve with the meal is also a nice touch.  The sides of salad, rice and fries are nothing special. The salad is an overdose of white onions.  What kills this place is how long it takes to recieve your order. It's about 45mins - 1 hour from the time you place your order and the time you receive your food.   Tip: The bathrooms are a behind a secret trap door. See if you can find it."}
{"text":"Malgré une mauvaise note attribuée lors d'une visite précédente, je m'étais promis de revenir ici pour offrir une seconde chance à ce petit resto portugais. Faut dire que j'adore la bouffe de ce pays, et surtout, j'adore le poulet épicé sur charbon de bois. C'est donc un client satisfait de sa seconde visite qui s'apprête à vous décrire son expérience chez Portugalia.   J'ai choisi le demi-poulet épicé qui était tout simplement délicieux. La peau grillée par la cuisson au charbon de bois s'est révélée croustillante et assaisonnée juste à souhait.  Dans son ensemble, le repas accompagné d'une salade, de frites et d'un pain portugais, rencontre les attentes de l'amateur de poulet portugais que je suis en raison du prix et de la qualité.  Le service, qui m'avait apparu totalement déficient (pour ne pas dire impoli) lors de ma première visite ici, était franchement meilleur. On nous a servi rapidement et avec toute l'attention nécessaire.   Points négatif : Les frites allumettes servies avec l'assiette de poulet sont décevantes et nuisent à la qualité d'ensemble du repas. J'aurais préféré de bonnes frites maison. La sélection de vin est limitée. Le resto offre un vin maison très correcte, mais j'aurais aimée avoir plus de choix.  Ma critique décortiquée : Le poulet : 5 * Les prix : 5 * Le service : 5 * L'ambiance : 4 * La carte des vins : 2 * Les frites : 2 *  La prochaine fois, je tente le calmar rôtis dont j'ai entendu beaucoup de bien dans d'autres critiques de confrères yelpeurs. Je recommande à ceux qui passent dans le coin et qui cherchent un bon poulet servi dans l'atmosphère sans prétention d'un petit resto de quartier."}
{"text":"I really like this place. Chicken is not dry, does not have a lot of bells and whistles but the quality of the food is good.  You can smell it from outside and there arent crazy lines/wait times like some of the places out there"}
{"text":"Honestly, with so many portuguese places in montreal it is hard to choose. I usually go back for the service and the ambiance. It's a lot like portugal.   The chicken is delicious. The fries are just the right amount of spice too. Love that they serve Superbock beer! The only reason I give it 4 stars is the fact that they serve Kraft \"italian\" salad dressing on their salads.   Besides that, great place."}
{"text":"The chicken sandwich had an excellently executed chicken and bread. The chicken is juicy and tender. The bread is robust, yet soft, with just enough of a crust to give an interesting texture.  However, the chicken had way too much salt. This dominated the flavor profile of the bird. With a nice mayo-based sauce maybe this could have been overcome. But the saltiness was so profound I can't give more than 3 stars."}
{"text":"I am not a big meat eater in general, I went to this place with couple friends visiting. The sandwiches were delicious, we sat at the bar by the entrance to watch the chef cooking. There are couple other good chicken options in town but this is definitely in the top three best"}
{"text":"Yum!! I'm here visiting and when I was looking at a menu at another restaurant a local man told me not to eat there. When I asked where he would recommend he instantly told me to get a chicken sandwich from here. So I read the reviews and got a whole roasted chicken, chicken sandwich, ribs and fries.  ALL WERE DELICIOUS!!!! The fries could use some salt but the meats were succulent and tasty!!!  This is not. A great picture of the ribs but I recommend them. They are clearly grilled and not. Oiled like other places do to save time.  I called for take out because I have little kids and make sure you call early. He told me 30 m but it Took 40. I'm. It complaining as it was really hot and fresh. Staff is so nice!!!! Go!"}
{"text":"Great no-frills Portuguese at a good price.   A little difficult to get the lay of the land first.  When we visited in Sept 09, they were having some issues with the city as far as getting a new sign put up, so it was hard for us to find the resto.  Then, when we walked in, we were greeted by a huge grill loaded with chickens (they do a mean take-out business, it turns out).  The dining room was actually tucked in around the corner, a new addition to their grill/store-front.  But once we were in there, it was a pleasant little place to have a meal.  We didn't try the rotisserie chicken, which is apparently the draw.  Instead, my dining companions and I focused on their other meat offerings: the steak, the mixed (pork) grill and the chourico.  Everything was excellent and authentic.  And maybe it's because I'm a Bostonian and just used to paying a lot to dine out, but the prices were ridiculously  low.  Service was casual and friendly.    Can't wait to take my parents here, if they ever agree to come to Montreal with me again."}
{"text":"This to me is the place to get your Portuguese grilled chicken craving fixed! Grilled to perfection, the chicken is charred just enough for you to have that smokey aroma. Juicy, tender, moist, melts in your mouth and oh so delicious! Order a few hours in advance your chicken to go because they are that busy and famous! Especially after featuring on A La Di Stasio show. You'll be asked if you want it mild or spicy. I always ask for extra spicy lol! You can also dine-in since they have a sitting area but not a lot of people do that. Service is ok. Nothing else to say about that. Oh ya. I also suggest their chicken sandwich. It's also very good! The prices, in my opinion are fairly reasonable. You'll be full and still have money to go clubbing on the Main ;)"}
{"text":"This place is around the corner from where I'm staying which is convenient. There isn't much signage for this place so it's possible to miss it.   I decided to get 1/2 chicken that came with fries and salad. Chicken is cooked Portuguese style and it's very juicy. My friend got a steak sandwich and liked it. It took 15 mins for them to make it and they don't accept credit cards. It is cash only."}
{"text":"You walk in as a normal human being, you walk out still mostly normal but with such deep scents of smokeyness in your skin you'll probably never get it out.    Portugalia is a rotisserie chicken sit down restaurant you don't really get in USA#1, with full service and menu and the food being cooked and the aromas flying about the restaurant.  Go there, order some chicken, eat some of their fantastic bread, and have a beer or two. You deserve it."}
