{"text":"Left the warm house in the freezing cold to have a dessert. Showed up at 830pm they said we finished  waffle awhile ago!!!! Google and Yelp has 9pm closing time. His door has a 10pm closing sign. The person working there said this happens regularly!!! Really change your hours to when you know you will have waffle; this is really unacceptable."}
{"text":"Just went here. The waffles are fantastic; they make the waffles crispy, the strawberries are fresh and the Nutella is fantastic as always! The inside is also really well decorated, and the chef/owner of WaffleU is super friendly and polite. Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"I'm impressed, very impressed. Each Liege waffle is personally customized and freshly made for you. As others have said, there's only the owner making the waffles, so you'll need to wait for your order when it's busy. But I think the level of attention in making the waffle and customer service makes this place really special. Along with unlimited topping and only 99 waffles are made each day justifies the $10.00 (tax in) price tag."}
{"text":"This guy puts quality and care into each and every waffle he makes. You don't see this kind of care put into food these days anymore unless you go high end. Seriously one of the best waffles I have ever had. However because there is only one of him it tends to take a long time to get your waffle if the store is busy."}
{"text":"When we entered this WaffleU location, we were warmly greeted with a  jazz music filling the atmosphere along with a bright and cheerful greet from the owner.  He told us how he made the doughs (which takes 24 hours to make) and how we are able to customize our waffles the way we want with any toppings at a fixed cost.  When we wanted to order our waffle, we didn't see any list of toppings but he recommended the Classic which was the most popular. It took approximately 7 minutes for the waffle to be made and it was served in a hybrid of a box and a dish.  First impression was great, the Nutella drizzle, the vanilla ice cream, the slices of both strawberry and banana, and the roasted marshmallow made the waffle even more appetizing. The first bite was very favourable as the waffle's characteristic was crunchy on the outside and very chewy on the inside. The highlight of the waffle was mostly vanilla ice cream and the Nutella drizzle as it went together with the waffle so well.   In conclusion, although some may think that $8.95 for a waffle is a hefty price to pay, remember, this is not a waffle that was made from a batter from milk and eggs that can be made within 30 seconds. Also, they produce a limited quantity of 99 waffles per day as I am predicting 'quality over quantity'. This waffle was a delicious way to finish my dinner. I will most defiantly come back for more in the future!"}
{"text":"The concept is great. I don't know what it was, and I still can't put my finger on it, but I just expected more."}
{"text":"Waffles were great and the place is cute it was very busy when we were there and they could have used help there was only 1 guy working also they could use more seating there's plenty of space for it"}
{"text":"The hours are wrong, you say you're open at noon to 9pm? I came at 6pm today and you weren't even open.... misleading. And there was a guy in the store who saw I was at the door and walked to the backroom instead of opening the door for me.."}
{"text":"Let me start with how much I love the waffle here - i skipped lunch for it. So when I walked into the store with only one person ahead I fully expected to stuff my face into a waffle pretty soon. However, i ended up waiting for 20 mins until i was helped because the owner, who is extremely friendly and I would appreciate the friendliness if I'm not stuck waiting, took his sweet time making the waffles of the guy ahead of me. Now being the one waiting, this friendliness translates to a sort of disrespect for the customer waiting which I'm sure it's unintentional. With that said, I shouldn't have had to wait for 20 mins before I was served. This wouldn't have been tolerated anywhere else.  When I dug into my waffle, it was still the delicious waffle that it was but I realized something was missing - the beet sugar. It's my favourite part of the waffle and I was disappointed that the crunch I was looking for isn't there. I'm not ready to say he forgot because he was busy talking but again this tells me more attention needs to be paid instead of connecting with customers. Don't get me wrong, it's important but the food has got to be on point as well.   I'd still go back but only because of the waffle is good. If I have to wait this long again then I'd have to really reconsider if it's worth my time."}
{"text":"Hours on Saturday say 12-9pm. I came at 7pm and they were closed...  Very disappointed since I was very much looking forward to trying this place. Couldn't find phone number."}
{"text":"Great waffles some of the best that I have ever had!! They are made different then the average waffle a bit pricy but the quality of the waffle more then makes up for it plus you can get any topping you want    The restaurant has a great atmosphere it's is a great place to eat and you can tell there passionate about there product."}
{"text":"Go for the waffles stay for Alex.  He is the life of waffleU and a true representation of Canadian small business. He's personable and helpful.    Not to mention that those waffles are damn good! They aren't your traditional waffles so don't go there and expect fluffy waffles but a denser different waffle.   So, go out there."}
{"text":"Went here today for the first time based on Yelp reviews and it was a great decision!   It's a small little spot where, what seems like, the owner makes your special waffle to order. We got a huge warm welcome the second we got in and were seated as there was a group of others waiting for their waffles. It is a bit of a wait as there is only one person working but it's a super cozy environment that it really doesn't seem to be a bother. I would assume is picks up on the weekends and holidays.   Overall great experience and I will be returning with my hubby next time!   Ps. It opens up at 6pm- 10pm"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! The waffles are so fresh and delicious. Not to mention that the service is great - the owner is so nice and you can tell he is passionate about the business. Will definitely be going back soon!"}
{"text":"Pretty yummy with a friendly owner! I enjoyed our visit. Waffles on a stick are a fun idea and I would come again sometime. We chatted with the owner, got the whole place to ourselves since we came during the day. He told us it can get crazy busy after about 5 pm with over a 2 hour wait so I'm glad we came around noon. I hope this place strong success!"}
{"text":"I finally came here yesterday after seeing reviews for this place a few weeks back. They only sell waffles and drinks. The waffles cost $10 with unlimited toppings and I got a bottle of ginger ale for $2. The owner was really friendly and answered all questions we had. I would definitely return and recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I would definitely come back!!!! From the moment you arrive you feel welcomed by the gentleman at the front, who is the SWEETEST. The prices are pretty good considering the portions. While you wait, there are games like connect four you can play. The decor is so nice and the whole place has an atmosphere that makes you feel instantly comfortable. The waffles look and taste AMAZING!!!! They are warm, delicious and definitely fill you up. I loved every minute here and can't wait to return"}
{"text":"This place is great. My kids devoured a waffle like the walkers in The Walking Dead. They went embarrassingly crazy. We live in the neighbourhood and saw it pop up a while ago but didn't get a chance to try it until recently. The owner/chef was really nice and I think this is a great addition to the area."}
{"text":"So good! A little hidden spot in Maple on Major Mac between Jane and Keele. The owner is super nice and runs the whole show on his own! I've gone during the time he made waffles and also the waffle sticks. Both were great and the pricing is reasonable. I prefered the waffle stick but both are good. (I think he's selling only the waffle stick right now). Will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"It was my first time coming down here all the way from Newmarket and I am super impressed! The own is super kind and talked to us the whole time we were there. He even remembers our names! Never met a server that has even mentioned our names ever. I don't usually leave a lot of reviews but I had to for this place. I was kinda bummed since I came to this place hoping to get those really creative waffles that were posted onto this shop's yelp page, but for some reason we were presented a white piece of paper to check off what we wanted, and only basic waffle options were available. None the less, the waffles were still amazing and I will definitely be coming back whenever I am in Vaughan!"}
{"text":"Summer 2017 Update to WaffleU's Summer Menu!  It's here and it's fucking delicious (pardon my language, but really though) went on their first day to get one of the first looks.  What me and my party got were 2 different Waffsicles and an ice cream cone.  The Waffsicles which are basically waffles on a stick taste just as good when they were waffles themselves. It had that overall Crunch on the outside and it was Fluffy on the inside. They were about $5 something and comes with a choice of a chocolate sauce and 1 topping. We got 1) Waffsicle with white chocolate and coloured chocolate pebbles and 2) Waffsicle with milk chocolate and oreo topping  I got the ice cream and it was really good ice cream. Creamy and fresh tasting if I could describe it. The ice cream was about $6 something Supposedly ice cream flavours change day by day but the one I got was the \"Chiquita Banana\" and Red Velvet. The Red Velvet was just like any red velvet ice cream, it tasted good but the Chiquita Banana surprised me. I'm not much on a banana ice cream kinda guy but this hit it out of the park, it wasn't too sweet and the banana wasn't overpowering at all. It was completely well balanced. Also have to note that it came with a fruity pebble waffle cone that brought a different flavour as you ate the ice cream with the cone.   Overall there is more that I would want to try on the menu like the ice cream sandwich bun and the milkshakes, will be coming back for more"}
{"text":"St. Jacob's Apple Pie ice cream is to DIE for! Topped it with Skor bits & couldn't get enough of it. Waffle on a stick is hot, fresh & made to order...delicious recipe & the hot melted chocolate makes it that much better! Only improvement could be being able to choose more than 1 topping for both the waffle & ice cream, even if it cost a little bit extra! Ice cream cup with topping was $2.99 & waffle was $5.95...so the price point is great! Definitely recommended to give a try when in the Vaughan/Woodbridge/Maple/Richmond Hill area!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. Stopped by this past weekend because we were out on the west end running errands and boy was that a great decision.  The owner is super friendly and very engaging with the customers. Because of the set up (only making one waffle/serving one customer at a time) there will be a bit of a wait but hands down completely worth it.   When it's your turn, you're asked how many waffles you want and then whether you want bananas, strawberries or both. Then you get to go up and select your toppings by placing jars in front of your waffle. Pretty cool process.   The waffle comes in at $10 but this is with unlimited toppings, and they really do mean unlimited. We had Nutella, icecream, bananas, strawberries, candy, sprinkles etc. Apparently one of the icecream flavours rotates so it changes every now and then (just another reason to come back!).  It comes in a little container you can split open if you're sharing it or if you just want to take a great picture!   We came around 3 pm on a Saturday and didn't have any issues with the 99 waffles per day. I think if you're downgrading the ratings for a concept they openly advertise the problem's with you and not the business."}
{"text":"What a great experience. Cozy interior, delicious waffles, and a super friendly owner!  As it probably isn't a surprise to you by now, the owner of this store only makes 99 of his signature waffles per day. Though the batter recipe remains a secret, the waffle dough is generously kneaded with chunks of pearl sugar instead of cane sugar before heading to the machines. Toppings are unlimited, and presentation is always on point.  Fruit selections = banana, strawberry.  Jarred selections = walnuts, almond slivers, peanuts, gummy bears, chocolate wafer sticks, shredded coconut, chocolate chips, oreo crumbs, sprinkles, toffee pieces, m&ms.  Sauce selections = peanut butter spread, nutella drizzle.  Ice cream selections = vanilla, chocolate, strawberry, coconut.   Even at $10 per waffle, I'd come back again. It's not an overly large portion but since it is a rather sweet dessert, I'd recommend sharing it so that it satisfies any immediate sweet tooth cravings and will still leave you wanting more for next time."}
{"text":"After passing by a couple of times and a friend recommending this place to us, we thought that it was time to give it a try. By god I'm sure glad that we did! This has got to be one of the best Waffles that I have tasted. Its clean and simple, nothing fancy, good ol' great tasting waffle with toppings if you want to have them on top, which I suggest you should.  Entering the place you are greeted by the Owner(I assumed) big smile and very friendly to everyone. You jot your order down on a piece of paper and you give it to him. There's a bunch of toppings to be selected, it did note that their Whipped Cream was home made. After you give your order you wait, why don't you go play some Connect 4 said the owner, we did! I lost 3-0 but it was great fun! After the game we were treated to a lovely waffle made with love.  This is a food experience that I won't forget, it has that small business vibe that you don't really get from the usual restaurants. Great service and great food! Will definitely go back! I suggest you to stop reading this review, hop on your car and head to WaffleU!"}
{"text":"We heard about this place through Instagram. Me and my cousins decided to go and check it out. We got to customize the waffle with ice cream the way we wanted. It was so good that I probably could have gotten another one."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place since I first heard about them on Instagram. The waffles are made by the owner himself, a super nice and bubbly person. So I decided to order a waffle + Nutella + strawberries. First off I would like to start off with the presentation of it, two words, mouth watering!!! The waffles were delicious, not too hard or soft, just right. If you love waffles or Nutella in general, this place is a must try! However, for those who have allergies, you can always switch out the Nutella for maple syrup or chocolate syrup.   Side note: order, sit where ever you like, enjoy your food then pay for your meal! They accept cash, debit and credit here as well."}
{"text":"WaffleU is the perfect place to go for amazing waffles and service. Depending on when you go, there may be a bit of a wait because the owner manages the store alone and it's an interactive process to make the waffles. However, it's definitely worth the wait!! Unlike some places that are stingy when it comes to toppings, he truly means \"unlimited toppings\" when he says it. You can ask for as many as you want and he doesn't cut down on the amount with every additional topping. It's also great that he gives you suggestions for additional toppings that would pair well with the ones you have chosen. If it's not enough, you can always ask for more!"}
{"text":"After much coaxing from my daughter I decided to try Waffle U.  With one server (the owner) and 6 people ahead of us in line I thought I was in for a long wait.  We ordered 3 waffles for the 4 of us and now with his fixed menu, the options are limited to basically bananas, strawberries, ice cream and whipped cream. We ordered a combination between us and the wait was not bad at all for a one man operation. The waffles came warm and well topped with fresh ingredients. While i'm not a big fan to begin with of waffles, these were more dense and fine.  I wasn't mind blown like some of the other  yelpers but wouldn't say this place is bad, it was just okay. There is a lot of potential here for this guy to offer more desserts and specialty coffees but i don't think that's in his plan. Oh well, maybe some day."}
{"text":"This place is amazing ! The waffles and toppings are fresh , you can choose your own toppings and make the waffle just how you are craving it. The owner is great and provides great service and quality fresh waffles . Will definetly be back more often"}
{"text":"This place is not your typical waffle joint. What differentiates this place from other places is that the owner, Alex, makes liege waffles and only 99 of them a day. The liege waffles are different from Belgium waffles. It's more doughy and filling compared to a fluffy and light Belgium waffle.  Before, the waffles were fully customizable with one price but now there is a set menu with around 8 or so options to choose from. I prefer the set menu because it makes ordering a lot easier and the wait time shorter. The only thing I miss from the old menu is the candy as an optional topping lol.   Another thing I really like about this place besides the waffles is Alex. He takes the time to interact with all his customers and makes sure everyone has an enjoyable experience. He greatly accepts feedback and is always looking to improve his shop and menu."}
{"text":"My friends and I were really excited to try this place out. You get to pick 4 toppings for $8. The waffle size was tiny. Think size of your palm. There was an interesting variety of topping selections (coconut , pecans). We were enjoying the first few bites, until we noticed s long white using baked into my friend's waffle. The strand of hair was literally stuck inside the waffle. We returned it immediately. Initially we were charged for half price for it because my friend had taken a few bites. We had to insist that it was unfair to charge even half when the waffle was not up to standard. Overall not a good customer service experience."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a tasty waffle. The service is amazing even though there is just one worker - Alex, the owner. He is extremely nice and talkative. However, he only makes 99 waffles a day, so the place closes fairly early and there is no clearly stated time - you have to direct message his Instagram page @waffleu to ask! A bit of a hassle but pretty cool at the same time.   Each waffle is $10 after tax with unlimited toppings. In addition, you get to go up and add more while you're still eating if you want to try something else that didn't initially fit. I have probably tried every topping at least once, and have loved each one!   There are also some beautiful paintings on the wall and the interior design looks very nice and modern. Lots of red and white with unique decor.  Personally, WaffleU is my favourite place to eat a waffle. They're so goOod! Definitely worth trying this place out in my opinion.  Check out the Instagram page for more info and photos because the owner is really active on it - @waffleu. That's how I first heard of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Waffle u is really good it is so unique I love it   ! There's so many options  its pretty clean"}
{"text":"Came here once with my girlfriend, the owner was super friendly and gave us a great treat! I had white chocolate on my waffle and she had the milk chocolate, both were amazing!!!   I recommend trying this place out when your sweet tooth kicks in!   Great food great service"}
{"text":"So decided to try this place for the first time. It's 9:33 pm... Full of people and even one guy at the counter ordering. I get turned away and they tell me their closed. 9:30 on a Saturday. Really? OK? If the waffles are anything like the service.. Then stay away!"}
{"text":"Yes!   The passion the owner has for these waffles is obvious from the second you walk in.  The liège waffles are truly unique and different from the ones I have tried before.  Great selection of UNLIMITED toppings.     Perfect spot for those with a sweet tooth."}
{"text":"Amazing! Service was great but the waffles were incredible! Made fresh & unlimited toppings. Waffles are a little small but worth it. Definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"The waffles here are so good, fluffy, sweet and perfectly cooked. The owner is very friendly and seems to be very passionate about waffles! I love waffles. I had the waffle with strawberries and maple syrup. These are seriously the best waffles I've ever had. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Friendly service. I went in after having this bookmarked on Yelp for some time, and unfortunately the menu had since changed so I didn't get what I wanted (regular square waffle with unlimited toppings). Instead, the menu consisted of waffle sticks or ice cream.  I opted for the waffle stick, with comes with 1 sauce and 1 topping - I chose the milk chocolate sauce and dark chocolate nibs. The waffle stick ended up being larger than I expected (OK for the price which originally had seemed high), and was thick and chewy. The chocolate toppings worked really well with it :)"}
{"text":"Summer hours are 12-9pm as per instagram I have been following them for awhile I was in the area so I stopped by.   I loved it. The owner is supper friendly and helpful. The waffles are made to order so it's a bit of a wait less than 10 min though. The waffles were incredibly soft and the chocolate was creamy. Don't be afraid to sample the toppings before choosing."}
{"text":"Had a great time here, really friendly owner and a tasty waffle+chocolate+strawberries+ice cream that we all enjoyed (maybe a bit too much lol)."}
{"text":"The food looked better than it tasted. We tried the mint ice cream with cotton candy topping and a waffle stick dunked in milk chocolate and walnuts. The waffle didn't taste spectacular as many reviews here would have you believe. In fact It tasted very 'doughy'..not sure how else to explain it. The store itself is clean and looks good, and has ample seating. But for the price tag and quality of food...you don't get much. I've tried much better elsewhere. Also, the owner is nice to talk to, but doesn't offer exceptions in his menu (ie summer menu is summer and fall menu is fall). It doesn't make sense in a business perspective, give the customers what they want. If they want traditional waffles with a scoop of ice cream on top...why not?"}
{"text":"Just finished our waffles , all I have to say is that they really do make Delicious waffles ! Love the atmosphere . Fresh ingredients , great service  ! Yummy milkshakes with original flavours ."}
{"text":"Very cute little place. Absolutely delicious waffle! And the stack of Nutella cans is mouth watering :))"}
{"text":"The saying \"Do one thing and do it well\" certainly applies to Alex and WaffleU.  The waffles are delicious and perfectly made. They have a nice crunch to them, and that's because Alex sprinkles pearl sugar (made from beats and not sugar cane) over the dough before he cooks them fresh for every customer. The dough takes 24 hrs to proof and he makes enough to serve 99 portions per day. After that he shuts down and gets ready for the next day.  This is not fast food and well worth the wait. The process is unique, personal and filled with pride. Alex makes up to 4 waffles at a time and serves them before moving onto the next batch.   On top of my waffles I had roasted marshmallows, fresh banana and strawberries, chocolate Sicilian ice cream, baby M&Ms and Nutella drizzle.   The best word to describe my Liège waffle experience is mmmmmm!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Only had three flavours of ice cream and waffle on a stick. The waffle was 6$ and only had one topping and chocolate. It was very messy to eat and way to rich. Did not enjoy experience at all!' Was hoping for the waffle with ice cream treat I had seen in pics. My son looks happy but found it really hard to eat and way too sweet. Will not go back unless other options brought back."}
{"text":"Delicious waffles, friendly service and Nutella. What more do you need! Stopped by here yesterday after having lunch and was welcomed warmly from the chef/owner. We were able to choose which waffle combination we wanted and it took 20 minutes for three of our orders to be prepared. What I loved about their waffles is that there is a delicious crust on them and when I asked the chef about it. He mentioned that he only makes so many waffles a day, he uses yeast instead of the pancake batter that many other places use and he puts brown sugar for that crust. Definitely will be coming back for another waffle soon!"}
{"text":"One of the best waffles ever. Alex is great and makes this experience definitely a 5 star. Have came her multiple times and each time is consistent with quality and delicious!! I crave these waffles on a daily basis.    UPDATE:   I've said this 6 months ago and I'll say it again, best. Waffle. Ever. No more unlimited toppings but that's okay, still amazing and I will always crave this place."}
{"text":"The waffle is goood . It's somewhat flakey?  Small menu easy to choose from . Wanted to try the milkshake but I'm sick so I got a hot apple cider instead. Would be waaaaay happier with a milkshake so for sure will be back for one. The shop guy is super friendly. Very Instagram worthy."}
{"text":"Very welcoming, very sweet guy and feels homey. Must try! The waffles are awesome and customizable. Very consistent taste every time we go so you know he's a pro at what he does! :)"}
{"text":"This is my new go-to place for waffles! Came across Waffle U on Blog TO and had to try it. Waffle U makes only 99 waffles a day because the owner believes in quality over quantity. The place closes once the owner sells out all 99 of his waffles. This is actually my second time here because when I came here the first time the owner had already ran out of waffles. You can always message him on Instagram @waffleu to ask.  For $10, you get a Liege waffle (waffle with deep pockets) with unlimited toppings. Once you get there, you pick a table, sit down, and the owner will call you up to the counter to pick up your waffle once it is ready (takes about 10 minutes).  He will have several jars of toppings that you get to choose from at the counter. I decided to add the chocolate chips, marshmallows, PEANUT BUTTER, almonds, walnuts, strawberries, bananas, vanilla ice cream, and nutella drizzle which was actually a great combination. I love how he carefully places a marshmallow in each of the pockets to make sure each pocket has a marshmallow in it. He then torches the marshmallows and chocolate chips as well which gives it a very nice touch. If you are unsure of what to toppings to get you can check out his instagram for some inspiration or ideas. It is almost like art work.  I was very excited to try my waffle and I must say it was truly amazing. The waffle was fresh, buttery, crunchy on the outside, and stretchy like fresh bread. All the toppings blended together so well - the way the chocolate melted and the way the marshmallows turned stringy like cheese just really made my day.  It's very relaxing. The jazz music and the black and white murals painted by c8mk_design add a very nice European touch to his overall interior as well. Loved the red, white, and black theme inside. I will definitely be back again soon"}
{"text":"This waffle joint serves THE most delicious waffle I've had in a long time. Would recommend to anyone and everyone!!! Definitely would be revisiting in the near future."}
{"text":"Had this place bookmarked for a long time. I heard great things from a lot of my friends as well as saw it on social media a lot. It seems its the owner himself who makes the posts on facebook and instagram. I think he would get a lot more exposure if blogTO makes a video! Or one of those popular sites writes about it...   Food: Anyways, I was a big disappointed to see \"unlimited toppings\" removed. When I look at the older photos posted, they are so much bigger and loaded with toppings making the value so much better. It is up to 4 toppings now which made me a little sad because there are so many options! Loved the cookie butter. I saw him pull out a blowtorch. I'm not sure what it was used for LOL. When we came in, there was a huge stack of waffles already made. Like 40 waffles. I thought our waffles would be cold and soggy. Especially since he had so many to make (we came in a large group and he is only 1 person). However, he made them very quickly, the WAFFLES WERE WARM, CRUNCHY, and he clearly tries to make them look pretty. Great effort.   The mango icecream was NOT tasty... the vanilla was fine.   Also love the decor inside! Lots of seating and wifi."}
{"text":"When I think of waffle my ideal ones are tasty, but light, thin, but not cheap and made with personal care. Waffleu is that. They have nutella, peanut butter or whipped cream as the main topping and then banana and strawberry as the fruit topping options and from there one can add unlimited toppings. My personal favourite: peanut butter, cream, chocolate sprinkles and banana. So tasty. Waffleu opens at noon and when the limited run of waffles is finished will close its doors. The owner has travelled Europe (or so he told me) and was inspired. The waffles are really good, but unfortunately run at $10 each.  How did this university open up here?"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for years now after recommendation from one of my tattoo artists (power of social media, but also power by Word of Mouth). Upon entering, Alex the owner greeted my friend and myself and asked if it was our first time here. He told us they have nutella in all their waffles, but we can substitute it with another sauce if we'd prefer. As he was introducing the menu options to us, one of his customers was leaving and informed us \"you won't be disappointed, ladies!\" That loyalty. Anywho, I ordered the #8: waffle, strawberries, nutella, and vanilla ice cream. It was $8.30. My friend ordered the #10, which was everything included in my order, plus bananas. Hers was $10.45.   Alex informed us that we don't pay until we got our food, so we waited less than 10 minutes and then he called us up to grab our waffles/pay. We were the only customers in WaffleU, but it started picking up speed around 4pm that Saturday. While I greatly enjoyed my freshly made waffle, I must admit that I've had better (and bigger) dessert waffles elsewhere. I think what made WaffleU so successful before (and currently) was Alex's personal touch.   Right before we left, I asked Alex about the unlimited toppings I'd been hearing about. He informed me that he only offers that promotion during special events or holidays, the most recent being Easter weekend. I'll definitely be back to try the unlimited greatness.   Final verdict: a worthwhile dessert place, and definitely one of the best in Maple."}
{"text":"Waffles were very good, they only had waffles on a stick today, I was actually surprised with how large it was. We ordered two waffles and two ice cream waffle cones, everything was delicious. My two young daughters were with me and the owner was very nice to them. He gave her samples of ice cream and toppings when she couldn't decide on what she wanted. My only disappointment was that there was no whipped cream or fresh fruit options. He also doesn't sell any coffee or drinks. I like my waffles with strawberries and whipped cream. However, I will definitely return for the ice cream."}
{"text":"What an awesome place. The owner (?) who was serving us was hilarious, engaging, and entertaining while he made the waffles. I loved the assortment and selection of toppings, plus the waffle itself was so fresh. The quality is impeccable here. For the price, I think it completely matches with the product we got. Will definitely return, not only for the delicious waffle but for the amazing service. Just wish they had some pitchers with ice water - the waffle is so sweet I needed something to balance it out haha."}
{"text":"The power of social media! It was my first time in Maple and I was craving some sweet things after a business meeting on a Saturday afternoon. I quickly checked on instagram and out came \"WaffleU\". I also double checked the reviews and pictures on Yelp before deciding to come here! The reviews looked goood :) It's interesting the instagram logo is a part of the shop sign.   I was greeted by the owner, Alex, as soon as I stepped into the shop. He was very welcoming and asked me if it was my first time there. He proceeded to let me know what the shop offered and all the available options if I didn't like Nutella or if I was allergic to nuts. The shop specializes in waffles + nutella, and the price starts at $4.99+tax. The different set combos have different prices as it depends on the topping you choose.   There are quite a number of seats there and it is a great hang out spot for any age groups. The place is spacious, red and very clean. My excitement of trying out this place and the colours definitely made me feel very happy.  I opted for a strawberry milkshake that day, as it was one of their best sellers. It was creamy and sweet (I reckon it was just blended icecream, milk/cream, strawberries, and strawberry syrup with a healthy serving of whipped cream). It for sure satisfied my sweet cravings. Unfortunately I didn't order the waffle with nutella that day, but it looked good and smelled even better. While drinking my milkshake, I noticed that the waffles were not made with the traditional egg batter method, but instead, Alex puts a dough (like bread dough) in the waffle maker!!!   I will definitely be back to try the waffles + nutella + a combination of toppings in the future!"}
{"text":"These waffles are not your typical Demetres or café waffles. They are real Belgian waffles- they seem smaller than your norm but they taste amazing! And it's only $10!"}
{"text":"If only I could give 10 Stars!!!! The waffles were the best i have ever had, and the service well that was the best I have ever had too. The kids, Hubby and I were extremely impressed. I figured if its in the name then it better be good and he did not disappoint."}
{"text":"Bookmark removed!   Came here with a great friend on Sunday at noon. It had just opened and we were the 5th and 6th person to arrive. Only 99 waffles are served so come early!   We placed our order and took a seat for about 10 minutes and then grabbed our delicious waffles. I got strawberries, marshmallow, chocolate chips, coconut, dried pineapple topped with chocolate ice cream and Nutella plus a few Chocolate covered cranberries They got rid of the peanuts due to allergies but it might be coming back. It was not entirely clear.   2 waffles for 20 bucks all in and unlimited toppings.  The waffles were so delicious, unlike anything I have ever had. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Location, service and customer service are all on point!!! Just like how perfect he made our waffle ice cream! The owner was approachable and very friendly.  Toppings are unlimited so go all out! For $10 you get a serious foodgasm in this place!  Definitely worth the money!  #wemadeafam#summerbod#cheatdayeveryday"}
{"text":"The hours suck and I tried in the past to come by, but the kids are in bed after 8 and they'd sold their 100 and had closed up...   Today was a successful mission 6:10, number 7...   Holy sh8t, maybe some other expletives too... I wasn't creative with my creation... everything on top and wow, orgasmic...   Thankfully I can't make it everyday, due to the  hours 6-10(ymmv)...   Beats any waffle store out there... Belgian waffles loaded with goodness are definitely tops on my dessert list, nvm the cupcakes, cakes, crepes...  They didn't have coffee??  I live 5 minutes away, I grabbed it to go and the wife had two bites left to enjoy, I devoured it in minutes before I even made it home.... :-( I knew I should have bought 2....  Everyone needs to try at least once...."}
{"text":"Delicious waffles and the wonder was very kind and friendly. A great place if you are a Nutella lover like me!"}
{"text":"Literally the best Belgian waffle you can get in Toronto!!! Reminds me of the Belgian waffle I had in Brussels !!  The owner is SOO friendly too! He puts effort into every waffle!"}
{"text":"Waffle 4.5/5 - Ice Cream 3.5/5 - Service 5/5 - Setting 3.5/5 My rating is 5 stars because I think its the best waffle I've had! This is my 5th time visiting WaffleU, I've been to this place since it opened (over 2 years ago?) The owner is a passionate chef hence you can taste his passion in the waffles. This place has its uniqueness, you order, take a seat to wait, eat and pay before you leave! Im going to comment on the most recent visit.   The waffle did not disappoint this time! Its a more dense, chewy kind of waffle, big portion (i suggest to share!) you can choose 4 toppings of your choice. I had oreo, reeses, condensed milk & bananas. You can also choose your choice of ice cream with extra charge, I'm a huge fan of ice cream but not a fan of the ice cream they offer. But if you must have ice cream on your waffles its still good! Their choices of ice cream changes and the owner is good at keeping them interesting! Follow their instagram for updates on flavours :) Oh! You can also help yourself with a game of connect 4!"}
{"text":"Waffles are ridiculously yummy. Be warned as it is not your traditional fluffy waffles that you would get at a typical Spin or Demetres Cafe. It's a \"Belgium Liege\" waffle made with yeast dough thus it has a more fuller and a soft bread texture to it that just works. For ten dollars you get unlimited toppings and the waffle is made fresh right in front of you. The owner is very sweet. He does this all by himself so do expect a wait time as he cares more about quality and tries to ensure that he puts 110% in every waffle that's served. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Been to this place many times and will continue to be a regular, especially that I live nearby. My boyfriend would even travel from Scarborough to specifically come here.  Alex, the owner, is SUPER welcoming and always creates casual convos with each if his customers. He makes 99 waffles daily and once he runs out, he closes shop for the day.  The waffles...oh man the waffles! Blessed! That is all. As it is still a growing business, I hope to see a wider variety of ice cream flavours (chocolate, vanilla, coconut and strawberry) and toppings in the future."}
{"text":"I never left once I found out about WaffleU. Alex (the owner) is amazing - he is very friendly, very hospitable and very entertaining. His personality, besides his food, is what makes you come back. The waffles are made in front of you and you get to choose which topping you want in them. You can even play Connect 4 while waiting for the waffles.   Alex often changes his menu based on the seasons and no matter how many changes he has gone through, it is a very enjoyable experience.   My boyfriend and I has been coming to WaffleU for over a year now and we have never gone to any other places ever since.   When you come to WaffleU for the first time, you just don't get a new experience with a new food, you also find a new friend in Alex."}
{"text":"Waffle U might probably be one of the best place if you are looking for Liege Waffles.  Liege waffle is a little more dense, chewier and can be quite filling. And since Waffle U let you pick unlimited toppings and the nice owner even offered if I want extra ice cream, I was on serious sugar high.  Only 99 waffles are available everyday. So if you are planning to be here later in the evening, it is best to message or pm before coming so he can save you 1 or 2 orders.  If you are into sweet, I strongly recommend you give Waffle U a try. I just love freshly made waffle straight from the oven. There might be a little wait for your custom made waffle, but it  definitely worth the wait.  $10 tax in per order is a little pricey but for frequent buyer you get 1 free for every 3 waffles purchased. I wish they can have a plain version with just a touch of icing sugar for a lesser price as I don't usually overdo my toppings. I want to enjoy the waffle itself as it is and I won't be on this sugar rush."}
{"text":"We came to WaffleU on a whim one day after reading all the rave reviews. The restaurant is certainly spacious and clean. The owner asked how we stumbled upon his restaurant, then provided a rundown of how he makes his waffles and what toppings can be applied. He asked if we wanted strawberries or bananas, or both. He then laid out all of the available toppings, of which two will be toasted (marshmallow and walnuts). He then asked if we wanted nutella drizzle. Once the order was placed, we waited for several minutes while it was being prepared.  The waffle with toppings were definitely good. The waffle itself is not your traditional waffle batter, but was much fluffier yet still maintained the crunchiness that are associated with waffles. It was definitely a treat on an extremely warm Saturday. However, the price point ($10) was not really worth it."}
{"text":"Okay, not sure where to start...Every time I go to this place it's seemingly closed. I just submitted the new hours which are from 6-10pm. So 4 hours and that's it!!  I subscribed online to get Instagram updates and get posts that they are \"out\" soon after they open...I'm realizing this place may never be in the cards for me and it clearly belongs to the fools who run for it club.   The premise, if you want to be part of the club, you must get there soon after they open in hopes that they don't run out of waffles, I assume they close early on nights where they sell out.   So, for myself who will not have any opportunity to take part in this limited time offer, short supplied,  dessert place,  I do not have something good to report other than times I have tried to spend money here and failed. I hope this may one day change so that I can visit during normal business hours and not worry about them running out!.   There should be at lease one review that talks about this place as a whole. Very often, it is  more than food that makes me increase or decrease my ratings and affect my review. Since no one mentioned this businesses practices in the past, why not add this in so everyone is aware and can be informed."}
{"text":"Cookie waffle cone with black cherry and raspberry sorbet, milk chocolate waffle stick with strawberry crisp!"}
{"text":"The owner Alex greeted us as we entered and was extremely friendly.  He provided us with all the details on how the waffles are made (fresh daily), and these were our choices for toppings:  You choose the fruit which he cuts on demand, (bananas or strawberries) and then you choose from a line up of toppings on the counter (pic included) then a choice of peanut butter or Nutella and finally your choice of ice cream (vanilla, chocolate, mango?).  This is a different waffle than your standard Belgian waffle, much more dense but absolutely delicious.  Keep that in mind when ordering because they are filling.  We ordered one with roasted marshmallows, Nutella, walnuts and vanilla ice cream and it was excellent. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Took my nieces here tonight. One ordered the waffle nutella and cookie and cream ice-cream. The other got the hazelnut ice-cream. It smelled delicious and they both gobbled it down quickly and happily. Clean place. The owner was friendly. Definitely would come back."}
{"text":"Dropped by again after work today. Open, with very few people. 3 stars for the waffle, one more star for the guy. Got the waffle nutella strawberry :)"}
{"text":"Absolutely Amazing Waffles and Customer Service. I visit all the time, and its just amazing. Its weird how they're changing their menu a lot, but I get it. The fresh waffles are delicious and the options are endless. Ironically, so are the calories, but oh, so worth it!"}
{"text":"I really really really wanted to love waffle u after all the beautiful reviews. It's been on my list for a long time to visit. I live very close and it was only a matter of time before I went. I have gone to waffle u 4 different times during \"business hours\" and it has not been open. I am disappointed with the concept of 100 waffles and then that's it. I understand that it's exclusive but it is a really difficult place to do business. I will try 1 last time before I finally throw the towel in :("}
