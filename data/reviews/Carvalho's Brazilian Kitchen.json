{"text":"We were staying at the Boulders resort which is only about 2 miles away from the restaurant. We found the restaurant on Yelp after having tried the restaurants at the hotel (which were overpriced and the food was just ok). Forgot our waitress' name (I think it was Corina) but she was super friendly, offered suggestions and explained the dishes to us- we weren't too familiar with Brazilian food. We tried the Feijoada and the Picanha, both dishes were delicious! Service was fast and friendly! Would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This place was really nice. Everybody was so attentive and the food was great too. I love the plantains and the yuca frita. I recommend this place for people who likes flavorful food. Pleasant ambiance."}
{"text":"Good Brazilian food and atmosphere.   Staff and owner were friendly; we enjoyed the whole experience.  It's real Brazilian with regional variety - the Mocheca Peixe was delicious.   Plantain chips are a nice touch.   A great find among the sea of choices in the valley."}
{"text":"We went there for my boyfriend's birthday.  I had a seafood stew and he had a steak. They were both very nice dishes.   And their service was very attentive and friendly.  It was on Thursday, they had a date night special $45 pre-fix dinner for 2 people.  One appetizer two main and one dessert.   It was more than enough for 2 people.  We love to go back there again and try difference dishes!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely fantastic! The owner is super nice and makes you feel like family. The service is great. The dishes are very delicious and have a very unique taste. The specialty seafood stew is the best seafood dish I have ever had. Overall I give this place a 9.5/10 on service, 9/10 for the delicious meal, and 8/10 for value for your buck."}
{"text":"From the moment we walked in and were seated, I felt that their process was off.  There didn't seem to be clarity of roles between the staff.  It took over 10 minutes to be greeted and served waters.   I ordered the cheese bread appetizer and it was delicious, fresh, and served hot.  Unfortunately that was the only part of the dinner that impressed me.  I ordered the Feijoada, in which both the rice and beans/meat was served cold as if it was sitting around for the majority of the 40 minutes it took to get to our table.  My girlfriend ordered the Brazilian steak with grilled veggies.  The steak was pretty good, but the veggies were cold as well. 
For meals that are priced $30 I would expect the to be served hot, especially on a night that didn't seem to be too busy.  Normally, I chalk this up to an off night, based on all of the other positive reviews I see.

*** I feel that I need to point out what we observed with the owner.  As we were paying the bill he apologized that 'we had to wait forever' for our bill (we didn't have to wait at all).  He apologized to the table behind us \"you have been waiting forever to order\" (they already ordered).  He apologized to another table \"you have been waiting forever for waters\".  (they were done eating, paid their bill, and were leaving.)   Basically, he was throwing his employees under the bus!!   I feel he should have been focusing more on improving the process flow from the kitchen than blaming his servers.  Maybe my food wouldn't have been cold.    ***

Anyways, our server Marlon was very nice, funny, fast, and did an excellent job.  I wanted to give him the credit that he is due, because I don't think he boss will.  

PS, the lighting on the patio is horrible in the evening.   The table next to us used the flashlights on their iphone to read the menu.  After we pointed this out to the hostess, she lit some candles."}
{"text":"Great food, great drinks, great service! Owner stopped by to ensure we had a great experience. Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"This is the best new restaurant in North Scottsdale!   The quality of the authentic Brazilian cuisine is top notch and the authentic class of the staff adds to the experience.   A must stop."}
{"text":"A local favorite of ours.  We passed by this place many times because my husband is vegan and we weren't sure if they could accomodate him.. But luckily a coupon came in the mail and we thought we'd try it.  Well not only did the restaurant offer many dishes my husband could eat- but they were willing to make accomodations. Tthe food is outstanding. We have been back since many times.  Very friendly and professional services as well."}
{"text":"If you looking for something new and different in North Scottsdale, this is the place. Great food, staff makes you feel welcomed! No rush, no pressure. Plan to come back soon to try other items on menu."}
{"text":"This first time was solo happy hour. The caipirinha is fresh and refreshing, a great changeup from the typical margaritas around here. The coxinha de frango is seasoned ground chicken croquettes with a great crispy outer armor served with a fresh house-made spicy pepper sauce. Very satisfying, with 3 generous pieces to easily share. If you love a French dip sandwich and are tired of being disappointed in Scottsdale even after spending almost twenty bucks just for a down-sized roll, then have the \"sanduiche de carne\". You won't miss the fake au jus of the overpriced alternative. The French roll would make a Parisian proud, crackly and crispy on the outside, light and airy on the inside, a perfect roll for a perfectly grilled (medium rare for me) steak, thick enough to be cooked to order, juicy and tender, cut on the bias for your eating pleasure, with romaine, onion, and roma tomatoes to apply as you wish. If you've got a big appetite this is the ticket, but you can easily share half with someone you like, leaving room to sample something else yummy. When a place is family owned, and they're present, well, you get the point. Carvalho's is like a 5-star white linen tablecloth Michelin-rated Manhattan restaurant, except they're Scottsdale casual. You can make this a weekly spot without guilt or breaking the budget, and you can leave your shorts on in the summer."}
{"text":"What an incredible restaurant!  Fresh, well seasoned dishes served by knowledgable waiters in a great setting.  The owners are genuinely interested in providing excellent food and service and want everyone to be happy.
We had the baked squash with shrimp, the black bean stew for 1, and the flan for dessert-- all were amazing.  I can't wait to go back.  Such a nice addition to the area."}
{"text":"Amazing! Authentic Brazilian food! The ambience, flavors, spices were just like a local Brazilian house! Worth the try! You won't regret!!"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem! Our family wanted to try something different and Carvalho's did not disappoint. In fact, it exceeded all expectations. The owner Phil came to our table and welcomed us and asked if he could show our kids some of the Brazilian artifacts on display in the restaraunt. The entire staff was wonderful and unlike anything we have ever experienced with regard to hospitality and service and we eat out often and all over the country. 
The food was just as incredible. The meat and seafood were cooked perfectly and the flavors were outstanding. Every one of us cleaned our plates. The deserts were the perfect ending to an amazing experience. We will definitely be back and can't say enough great things about this place!"}
{"text":"The food was terrific and the service was excellent.  We had the beef and beans over rice, which was hearty and very flavorful.  If you like spicy, be sure to try their homemade hot sauce which is really good.  We also had the little rolls filled with cheese and steak on skewers as appetizers and they were bot excellent as well.  The price was very reasonable."}
{"text":"Tonight we tried Carvalho's for Arizona Restaurant Week, and it turned out to be an excellent choice. My husband tried the cheesy bread, which was like little bread puffs filled with cheese, and a steak dish, along with a dark Brazilian beer. I had the pasteis, which are like empanadas--crispy and hot--and a caipirinha. My main dish was fantastically good--shrimp in a cream and cheese sauce inside an acorn squash--this is a must-try. My daughter also loved her nut-encrusted halibut with asparagus (ok, she is a weird 15 year old). Our server was Marlon, and if you go, ask to be seated in his area. He is terrific! I love to have waiters who are really happy and enjoying themselves and enthusiastic. The owner also came by several times to make sure everything was right. We will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is an interesting place with good, authentic food. I was in from the east coast and wanted to treat my family to something they might not find on their own.  Carvahlos hit the mark. Food is authentic and rich. Thank goodness we weren't counting calories. Service is attentive and it is definitely a family restaurant. Management/owners clearly want this place to succeed and make sure they treat you well. Try the fish stew!!
Location is a bit strange and entrance on the side of the restaurant is awkward."}
{"text":"Tonight, I went to this amazing Brazilian Restaurant to celebrate my mom s birthday and the pastel  was amazing as well as the feijoada! The food tastes really good!

We will be back!

{"text":"This is the second time we have eaten here and this time out did the last. I had the mahi mahi with shrimp and loved it. My husband had the boneless chicken with black beans and rice also equally delicious. We eat out a lot and I could see this being a favorite place of ours!"}
{"text":"This my wife's and my first time to a Brazilian kitchen. 
Wow! 
The service was on the spot and our server (cody) answered all of our questions and helped us a lot with making decsions and the food was excellent. 
As we were just finishing up on appetizers the owner (phil) came over and introduced himself to us and was very polite and really wanted us to have a great experience. 
We will be returning to this restaurant for sure, in fact my wife enjoyed the food so much she ordered a to go dinner to take some home."}
{"text":"This place is excellent.  Great ambiance and everything we've tired here has been amazing.  It's a great little place with great people and great food.  Try it out!!!!"}
{"text":"Loved our dinner we had at Carvalho's.  Beautiful interior with a nice patio next to a little stream. We started off with the Brazilian Cheese Bread. They came out warm and are really good.  Standout dishes were the Feijoada and the Moqueca de Peixe, which is a seafood stew with mahi mahi, shrimp, tomatoes, peppers, onions, and coconut milk. It was amazing. I will definitely get the Moqueca de Peixe again. We had the passion fruit mousse for dessert. It was so good. Nice restaurant with great food and great service."}
{"text":"Went over grand opening weekend! Food overall was very good, but Cai piranha drinks a little weak. Service staff try their best but still needs some tightening up. In summary, I give food a 7.5 atmosphere 7.5 drinks 5 service a 6
I hope  Carvalho's makes it, as the area needs a good Brazilian  restaurant. Will be  back in a few  weeks with hope's for noticeable progress."}
{"text":"Went with the family and it was a great experience. The staff was so friendly. They explain all the various dishes. There is so much to try. Food was awesome and the drinks were great too. This could be a special occasion place too. Will go back again"}
{"text":"I had high hopes about this meal. Having travelled to Brazil, I was excited to relive the culinary delights. The night started off well enough. It was a full house and lively.  Our waiter was pleasant although not sufficiently trained. The drinks were weak but had nice flavor.  Our trio of appetizers was good. That is where things went downhill.  Our entrees took an hour to arrive. Two of the meals were lukewarm on arrival.  The attempt to reheat did not rectify.  The waiter was gracious but the management should have handled the situation better. The frustration prevented any in our party from enjoying the remainder of the meal.  The restaurant should re-evaluate how they are doing things as this does not bode well for longevity."}
{"text":"Came in with the family for dinner, picked based on yelp reviews.  Did not disappoint!  Great food, drinks, and service.  
Had the black bean and pork soup as an appetizer, the grilled picanha(sp?), and cheese bread.  Yummy!
The kids had steak sandwiches and adults had steak plates and the stew over rice.  

Will come back for sure."}
{"text":"A great atmosphere with live music that included a flutist and saxophone!  This is a one of a kind restaurant with North Scottsdale being Carvalho's first location.  There is a an enchanting side patio with twinkle lights which would make it a very romantic spot although it was very family friendly with large comfortable tables.  The service was outstanding.  The crispy plantains, served after you are seated, are a real treat.  My favorite is the Skewered Picanha appetizer. (beef on a stick).  It was well marinated, tender and cooked perfectly.  I would also recommend the Grilled Vegetable Salad. I also tried the Seafood Stew which was outstanding.  I will be returning to Carvalhos hopefully soon.  Thank you for being in my neighborhood!"}
{"text":"What a magnificant place!  From the enchanted outside patio, to the cordial, informative and friendly staff, to the star of the restaurant, which is, of course, the wonderfully exotic and distinct flavors of Brazil, this establishment never disappoints.  It truely is a little gem in north Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Today I went to Carvalho's with my  family for a Sunday lunch and the experience could not have being any better, from the food to the atmosphere, everything was great! The staff is really friendly. We had the pleasure to meet the owner who gave us a little tour of the restaurant and sharing a bit of his adventure stories back in the days in Brazil. My family and have a new favorite place to go."}
{"text":"Very nice dinning experience. Great atmosphere to enjoy authentic Brazilian cuisine. Caipirinhas are spot on. Unique and interesting menu choices that offer something for everyone, Plenty of beef, chicken, pork and fish options. Tastey appetizer and salads should not be missed. High quality dinning coupled with affordable pricing makes this restaurant a must try in North Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This is the place for Brazilian food x lant

{"text":"An excellent choice for some different cuisine for the area. We enjoyed great service in nice atmosphere at a solid value. Even the drinks are a decent value. One of us had the traditional Brazilian meal, one the Shrimp Bobo and two the seafood stew (forget the actual name).  The two seafood meals were the best.  Lots of outdoor seating for when the weather warms in a nice garden setting.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Authentic and high end brazilian food. A bright spot of flavour in an otherwise pretty boring scottsdale food scene. High points include the pasteis appetizer, picanha, cupuaca mousse, and of course, the caipirinha (cocktail)."}
{"text":"We met friends here that we had not seen in forever!  We had lots of catching up to do.  Service was amazing, my husband is still raving about his steak!  I had the shrimp as recommended by our server as a traditional Brazilian meal and it was outstanding.  We met the owner, had a great conversation, we know we will be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went on a Saturday night and enjoyed the fabulous live music. The food was EXCEPTIONAL and the service was perfect. Don't miss this place!"}
{"text":"Loved the live music and the Feijoada!! 
The interior of the place is basic (if you're into ambience) but the music and good food make up for it! Was very excited for a different cultural experience since there isn't much of that in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, a really attractive setting, an attentive, helpful, and courteous staff. This restaurant has it all. If you're ready for an outstanding dining experience, this is it."}
{"text":"Another great meal at Carvalho's.  Great representation of Brazilian cuisine and the service was outstanding.  The coxinha de galinha is better than the ones I had in Brazil.  Highly recommend"}
{"text":"This place deserves 6 stars! Beautiful high-class restaurant with a warm and welcoming atmosphere. The staff is friendly, and the food is DELICIOUS! Wow, just wow! Talk about a restaurant that goes above and beyond to make your dining experience wonderful. I already can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Feijoada was good as well as coxinha. Restaurant was empty during our Sunday visit. I'd recommend if you are dying for a feijoada. For the same amount we paid for coxinha, you can actually pay for Fogo de Chao e get a much better food and service."}
{"text":"Good service. excellent authentic Brazilian dishes. The feijoada is very good and is served with authentic Brazilian side dishes, I would recommend Carvalho's to anyone seeking some good, well-prepared, and expertly served Brazilian food."}
{"text":"Was with a party of 7, overall we had a good experience. The staff are very friendly and helpful, making suggestions and always checking on us. I had the filet with a fried egg on top and it was cooked perfectly. We all really enjoyed the meat and cheese stuffed pastries for starters. Everyone at my table was happy with their food and we tried a variety of dishes."}
{"text":"This sweet restaurant is a hidden gem.  People don't know what they are missing!!!  The food is delicious, and we have been there for lunch and dinner.  They will not be open for lunch over the summer, but we will be there for dinner as often as possible. The owners and staff are delightful, friendly and accommodating. 

 It is tucked away, over a little bridge and next to a stream and much more spacious then it appears from the outside.  The portions are large, reasonably priced and the Chef knows how to bring the flavors out in just the right way."}
{"text":"The food is amazing. I loved the atmosphere. The service was fantastic. We celebrated my husband's birthday yesterday there. We had at 3 different servers beside our server checking in if we needed to refresh our drinks or more appetizers. This place is really on point! I highly recommend Carvalho's."}
{"text":"Great quaint regional restaurant serving the best authentic Brazilian food. I enjoyed so much all the times we went there. Great hospitality!"}
{"text":"Food was outstanding and it was a great atmosphere. Inside decor was inviting, and the patio with water features is perfect ambiance for the great weather we've been having. The tira gostos (appetizers) were amazing! I'm going to crave the Churrasquinho de Gato, a perfectly done picanha, and the Moqueca de Peixe with great flavors. The bar was very nice. This is definitely a go-to date night place. I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Very good flavor and good service. We shared the cheese bread and the plantain chips as appetizers. For the main courses I had the Picanha with Brazilian potato salad and Palm heart, she had the grilled salmon with maracuya sauce. Both excellent. Will be coming back to try out the rest of the dishes. Also available is an interesting list of Brazilian beers and of course the guaraná soft drink."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Great service. Food is terrific with lots of options. A regular for us."}
{"text":"We get to AZ a few times a year and always go to Old Town for dinner.  We thought we would try something new.  Have to admit...when we walked in...there was only one other table in the joint occupied (the Mexican place next store was hoppin').  Long and short...The food was over the top.  We had the black bean soup.  Very flavorful.  It is a meal in itself.  My sister had the tenderloin sandwich...medium rare.  Perfect.  I had the salmon.  Perfect.  My other sister had Bobo De Camarão...shrimp in like a cream sauce...She won for best meal.  The service and the presentation was outstanding.  The cheesy bread rolls were good... almost forgot that.  A real head-scratcher as to why we were only 1 of 2 tables in there.  Would not hesitate to go back."}
{"text":"Beautiful place! My dramatic younger daugther had tears in her eyes after the first bite"}
{"text":"Great find! Awesome service and the food was fantastic! The live Brazilian music was a plus!"}
{"text":"This was an absolutely fantastic and authentic experience. The feijoada was completely spot on as was my boyfriend's picanha grelhada. The pão de queijo took me back to the street side shops in SP. We will be visiting again!"}
{"text":"Not really sure where all these 4 and 5 star ratings are coming from.  Not only was the service bad, my salmon was awful!  Overcooked, fishy and like rubber- I complained and not only did not get \" sorry\" but had to ASK for them to take it off my check.  I never do that - most places are so apologetic that they take it off without asking.  Had to call over the manager and when we were given a new check, the dinner was removed-bill just thrown onto the table and not another word.  Not a great way to deal with a new customer.  Will never go back.  Word of mouth is how a restaurant STAYS in business today....."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Family owned and you feel like part of the family when you go.  We've been several times.  The food is awesome, very authentic."}
{"text":"Great Brazilian food. Authentic and delicious. Be sure to order the Feijoada as that is the national dish of Brazil, and order the caipirinha too. A delicious lime and vodka drink."}
{"text":"Always a nice atmosphere, delightful dishes and 
Brazilian live music.
We had the pastries appetizers, the acorn shrimp stew and the seafood stew and everything came out delicious and with nice presentation.
Love it!"}
{"text":"Nothing negative to say about our experience.  The reservation process through Yelp was easy.  The staff is warm and welcoming and provided very good service.  We went for the first time for my husband's 50th Birthday and the staff all greeted him with \"Happy Birthday\".
We had the salt cod and the shrimp appetizers and they were fine - not memorable - but good.
My shrimp stuffed squash main dish was fabulous and so unique.  I looked up the recipe when I got home so I can make it myself - Yum.
My husband had the medallions with mashed potato and broccolini.  He liked the flavor and the tenderness of the beef.  In future, he said he'll try something else, though, because he realized that he likes his beef more rare and this style of preparation does not lend itself to choosing how well cooked it can be ordered.
The complimentary birthday dessert, with candle and decorated plate, was the chocolate cake with coconut filling.  It was fabulous and I will definately order that again when we return.  
The decor is pleasant and even with the lights dimmed, it was not too dark.  
We will be back."}
{"text":"Great food and hospitality.  We were a 4 person party and each had a different menu item.  Every meal was really good.  I had the steak w black beans and rice.  Steak was generous for only $15.00 (one of the Brazilian specialties) and had a great flavor, not mushy like some restaurants serve.  One person had a seafood bowl dish w a sauce so good we wanted to dive in.  All servings were generous, the staff super friendly about explaining what and how each dish was made up.  All-in-all a great experience.  Will be going back soon."}
{"text":"WOW - The restaurant has been open for 1-1/2 years - where have I been?  Food and service is excellent.  I am a Concierge for a luxury residence club in North Scottsdale and always looking for something new but wonderful for our guests.  The entire Concierge team, along with our boss, dined here this evening and we were absolutely delighted with the food and the friendly staff.  We ate \"family style\" which is what I would recommend because every dish we tried was better than the next!  Leave room for the desserts - Personally, I will be back with family and friends AND I will be referring guests.  Thank you Justin and team - it was a wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"Been here twice, the owner greeted us both times.  Food is delicious.  Wait staff is super friendly. Patio is amazing.  Can't say enough."}
{"text":"I went here last night on a whim. I was hungry for a good meal, something out of the ordinary, not your average steakhouse or Mexican food. Carvalhos did not disappoint!

I was happy to find that it's Restaurant week and I opted for that option because I could sample everything and get 4 courses for $33. 

I started off with the Brazilian cheese bread which was delicious and gluten free! Second course was caldo verde which is a soup with potato, chorizo, and collard greens. I've had caldo verde before but this was even more delcious than I remember. 

My entree was Boboa  de Camarao  which is essentially a shrimp dish in a delcious sauce of coconut milk, onions, peppers and spices. The entree is served with rice and was delicious. This didn't disappoint either! 

Perhaps the best part of the evening was the live music. The woman was singing in Portuguese, not too loud that you couldn't enjoy it and not too low that you couldn't hear it. Her voice was so soothing and the songs were perfect for the atmosphere.

The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that the service was a little slow. It was restaurant  week and it's a new restaurant  so I'm certain they will work out the kinks! 

If I were to find myself back in Scottsdale, I'd definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Love the food and hospitality , Carina was super Amazing, she took the time to explain everything on the menus to us we will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Ohh a little pricey but you pay for what you get! Which is great service and great food and great atmosphere ! Bobo of shrimp is amazing, my server Joel was great too! Very humble."}
{"text":"This restaurant is straight out of Copacabana!  The food and drink is absolutely authentic.  If you have wondered what Brazilian food is like, give this a go.  Start with a caiprinha, Brazil's version of a margarita only better:-)  Made from Brazilian sugarcane, the spirit being cachaça, this drink has an unforgettably flavour that combines perfectly with the sourness of fresh lime, and the sweetness of Brazilian sugar.  For a starter, the p?o de quiejo (cheese bread balls with real cheese inside) is exactly as one would find in Ipanema.  For the main dish, my wife selected the Feijoada which is egualzinho the finest Brazilian hotel restaurants (we do not want this to be too authentic, as the original is a slave dish made from appendages of the animals that plantation owners butchered for their repast),  I had a Muqueca de Peixe (fish stew)  from the northern state Bahia, which was filled with delicious fish, prawns, coconut milk and dendé (palm oil).  Everything was perfect.

The restaurant is a bit remote on the northern outskirts of Scottsdale, and is located in an outdoor mall, but the owners have selected a locale featuring a lovely side patio with a stream winding through to help you make the transition to a much more exotic place.  Owner Phil came to greet us at the table to bate papo (chit-chat) and share his story of transitioning from one of the most successful fishing camps in the world on the Rio Negro in the Amazon, to the dream restaurant of his lovely wife.

By all means, a churroscoria rodizio (all you can eat barbecue) is also authentic and fun, but if you want deeper insight into the culture, give Carvalho's a try."}
{"text":"We loved it.  We had the black bean stew and it was perfect, especially with the condiments!  Loved the sausage in the stew too.  Very nice service.  We came on a Wednesday so the owner was able to come around & chat.  Very interesting guy & the place is full of Amazon artifacts too.  We really enjoyed our meal"}
{"text":"My wife and I took my mother here for her 77th bday dinner, and it was awesome!  The steaks were tasty and explained in light of the South American culture.  We were delighted to meet and talk with the owner who authentically cares about his food, culture and customers."}
{"text":"This place is so good.  Hidden gem.  Food was outstanding and very authentic.   Also had great service. Gabriel was very attentive.  Owner came by to ensure we had a great time.  That is always a good thing.  Think I found my weekly Friday place."}
{"text":"This was an outstanding dining experience. Friendly and attentive staff. Unique Brazilian dishes did not disappoint our foursome. Plan on a doggy bag as the portions are huge. Order the signature drink, the Capriani. Check out the Brazilian artifacts which add to the charming decor. We will back whenever we are in town. This culinary stop is a must."}
{"text":"Very good, friendly staff, nice relaxing atmosphere!  Definitely try it!  I'll be back:)"}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere at this little restaurant. The staff is amazingly friendly and made us feel so welcome. We really enjoyed the picanha, perfectly cooked and seasoned, and the grilled pineapple and potato salad were the perfect accompaniments. We also ordered the acorn squash stuffed with shrimp. It was a very unique dish. I just wish the squash was cooked through a little more. Also, the shrimp seemed to get lost in the cream sauce, and I would have liked it to be a little more spicy. Overall, the staff will make you feel right at home here, and the picanha will make you want to move in."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, the service was very good, and the owner came by and told us a little bit about the restaurant and himself.  My 10 year old found something she enjoyed too.  It was a terrific experience; we will be back."}
{"text":"We will be back!
Unique foods. ALL courses. Not spicy hot, but great flavors. The soup I had was very good, salads we generous and fresh. The main course selection were all great!"}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong - the food here is very good. It's fresh. It's flavorful.  It's delicious.  But the service though.   Bad service and high prices isn't enough to keep me coming here.  I gave them three tries and was disappointed every time.  I hope they turn it around.  Lower the prices... and for god's sake, you don't need a valet - we need those parking spaces."}
{"text":"Not only is the food fantastic, but the ambiance is wonderful.  Our waiter remembered what we ordered last time, even though we hadn't been there in 2 months. The owner came to our table and thanked us for coming in and chatted with us for a few minutes. Just a delightful experience all around."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. My criteria for an excellent restaurant is 1) Great Food ... you can't eat atmosphere! Carvalho's delivers here. I go for the PICANA GRELHADA, a tender, juicy, unctuous South American steak cut that retains the fat cap, which baste the meat while it cooks. I had this before in Brazilian Steakhouses but it's small slices. Carvalho's gives you two perfectly seasoned cutlets, which is more than enough for me ( and I am a big eater... in more than one way) and some to share with my wife. To me this is steak perfection! No steak sauce required! But if you desire there is a wonderful Brazilian pico that pares nicely with the meal. I have mine with their well seasoned black bean (black beans are not my favorite bean but I really enjoy theirs) and rice. My wife had the FEIJOADA, a black bean stew, with sausage, pork rib and beef. It is great as well (and again I am not a black bean fan). This is paired with rice and some of the best collard green I have ever had and I am from the South. These are not Southern greens...they really transform the into a sophisticated side! We have also had their black bean soup ... wonderful with slight orange favor! My wife had a grilled vegetable platter on another occasion that was good also. 2) Friendly service ... waiters are great and I had not seen the owner for while, he recognized us and warmly greeted us and checked to make sure everything was enjoyable and thank us for dining!  If you have the time I suggest engaging the owners in conversation as the have a fascinating background and back story to the restaurant. 3) Great prices ... I have eaten a $70-$100 a plate restaurants that did not deliver near the enjoyment that we had for $50 meal, my wife and I, at Carvalho's 4)Lastly atmosphere ... can't eat it but it nice to have especially when is interesting. Brazilian artifacts mixed with brightly colored giant bowls on the back wall makes it a charming and enjoyable place to dine! One of my favorite dining experiences in North Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"I wanted to treat my boyfriend to a nice birthday dinner on our first trip to Arizona. So after hunting through dinner options I came across Carvalho's and decided it would be a nice choice to try Brazilian food. I made reservations for 6:30, but the place was not full at all when I went, so it made things more intimate. We decided to be seated in the outdoor back patio where they had a very pretty ambient setup with a small pond. We were greeted with delicious plantain chips, and I decided to try the cheese bread after reading so many reviews about it. My boyfriend got the classic steak rice and beans dinner and I had the shrimp bobo.
To be perfectly honest, I wasn't too crazy about the bread, but maybe that's just me. The type of cheese used is very firm whereas I like my cheese gooey so maybe that's why. I also tried the Brazillian soda which was yummy, as the waitress described it \"a slightly fruity ginger-ale\". As for the dinner, it was delicious! The Shrimp bobo tasted very good and the rice had a unique but complementary flavor for it being white rice. The steak and beans my boyfriend had was delicious as well.
I would definitely recommend this place for people craving something a bit more special than the hundreds of Mexican options in Arizona."}
{"text":"You definitely need to know this cuisine prior to going. We were looking every dish up on google lol. What we ordered was great. The appetizer were awfully small but the plantain chips they offered at the beginning were delicious!.. yum"}
{"text":"We love this place.  My husband had shrimp bobo and I had acorn squash with shrimp.  They both were amazing!!  We loved the romantic atmosphere.  The owner was very sweet.  We will definitely go back to try other things on the menu.  Another plus, is that they offer military and veteran discount!  Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"Just like some other reviewers, we tried this using a Groupon. It's in a small shopping center within walking distance from our house which was also an incentive to try it. We weren't sure what to expect and were pleasantly surprised with it all! The food was delicious, the service attentive and timely and the menu varied. We will DEFINITELY make this a regular spot on our dining out rotation!"}
{"text":"Hello Everyone:

This is a review of Carvalho's Brazilian Kitchen for lunch.  This was my first time at the restaurant, so this review is based on the meal and service on a Wednesday for lunch.

Ordered:
One order of Shrimp Bobo
One order of Black Bean Stew
One order of Brazilian Cheese Bread
Mango Ice Tea

Salted, warm, plantain chips are brought to your table to enjoy while waiting for your meal - a nice touch.

We were only two of four people in the restaurant this day for lunch.

Service was unhurried.  

Review of Mango Ice Tea - a bit bland, the mango flavor really did not come through.  I was never offered lemon or sugar for the tea.

Brazilian Cheese Bread at $5.00 - these are small knots of bread, per the waiter made fresh to order, so they take a 10-15 minutes.  I have mixed feelings about the order we were served.  They were definitely hot out of the oven, but the cheese inside the bread was very gooey making it hard to chew.  It was like having a piece of gum in my mouth.  As the cheese cooled the texture was not appealing.  The knots are small, only about one inch.  We got eight knots with our order.  I think the portion represented more of a $3.50 charge, not a $5.00 charge when you can purchase entire specialty loaf of bread next door at Safeway for $3.99.

But, the bread came in handy to sop up some of the Shrimp Bobo sauce. 

There was not any salt and pepper on the table.  The waiter asked us if we wanted salt and pepper when our entrees were brought out.  Since the salt and pepper was not on the table initially, we assumed it was because the salt and pepper was in a nice grinder of sorts the restaurant did not the expensive grinders to disappear.  Instead, a regular salt and pepper shaker you would take on a picnic lunch was brought out for us to use.  For the price of the entrees, this was a let down.  Freshly ground pepper and salt is a definite need at this restaurant at these prices.  

The Shrimp Bobo was $20.00 and involved sauce, a scoop of rice, and ten medium-size shrimp.  The sauce was thick with a nice flavor.  But, it was not really hot.  Rather, the dish was served lukewarm and being seafood, the low temperature was a bit unnerving.  I had to ask the waiter for some lemon to bring the flavors to the next level.  While the sauce was nice, it was a bit flat for the price and for only ten shrimp, this entree represented a $15.00 portion. 

The Black Bean Stew was priced at $15.00 and involved black beans, rice, collard greens, orange slices, smoked meat and sausage.  The sausage in the entree served to us was one piece that was one inch long.  The smoked meat was two small stew pieces about 1\" square, and there was also some meat which had a long bone in it (still in on our plate) heavily disguised by the dark sauce from the black beans, but we found it when we bit into it.  The sausage bite and smoked meat were all tender.  There was not an abundance of meat served with the entree, perhaps representing an inadequate amount for the $15.00 charge.  The collard greens while sliced very thin, were still chewy and could have used one or more minutes of cooking.  Two orange slices were served with the entree.  Personally, I expected a little more orange flavor to come through in the stew.  The black bean flavor kind of took over everything because all the ingredients were cooked in the black beans and sauce.  It needed some freshly-grated orange zest on top as a garnish to perk the dish up.  

The waiter did not ask us if we cared for any dessert, although there were several selections on the menu.

We were also not offered any coffee or tea or another after-lunch beverage.

Other reviewers indicated the owner came out to their table while at the restaurant and talked about his history and how the restaurant came to be in Scottsdale.  We did not experience this during our stay.   

It appears the lunch and the dinner menu are the same and represent the same prices.  

Therefore, if you are going there for lunch, expect to pay between $22.00 and $30.00 per person including tax and tip (if you get an ice tea or something to drink).    

I think with some refinements regarding:  temperature of entrees served, upgraded salt and pepper at the table, and a bit more enhanced flavor in sauces, the restaurant could be a hit and we would definitely return in spite of the overall high cost for lunch!"}
{"text":"This place impressed us so much!! The staff was so friendly and the food was divine!!! Every single menu item we ordered was cooked to perfection and tasted delicious! Sol happy we chose this place and we are definitely going back!! Make sure to try the Brazilian Cheese Bread!!! A MUST!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I loooooved it here!! Every dish we ordered was absolutely fantastic (appetizers, entrees and desserts) and owners were also on site and incredibly friendly. I'd eat here every night of the week, but I don't want to weigh 400 lbs so will try to restrain myself:-)"}
{"text":"5 stars.... Everything about this cool place is very good.

And it's 5 min from us in Cave Creek which is so nice because it significantly expands the diversity in our localvore options beyond (great) BBQ, Mexican, and Italian eateries.

Our service was excellent and we had a nice conversation with Phil and Justin about the inspiration for the restaurant. If Phil is around, I'd highly recommend chatting with him for a few minutes because the guy has an amazing background.

I think we've all seen and maybe even eaten at a \"Brazillian\" restaurant before like the Fogo de meat kind of places. Those are great... but I never really understood the nuance of what \"Coastal Brazillian\" was, until trying it the first time in Ventura Ca a couple weeks prior at another restaurant. Now I can't seem to get enough of it.

The seafood stew Moqueca to me is just about the perfect dish. Perfectly prepared light and fluffy fish and large shrimp cooked in a mind-boggling base of cilantro infused coconut milk, tomatoes, garlic, and some kind of secret Brazillian magic. To me, it's a fusion of everything great in a fresh seafood plate + the amazing flavors you get in certain Thai dishes that combine sweet, creamy, and zesty citrus. it's served with a large scoop of garlic infused rice, which is delicious by itself and incredible when paired with the Moqueca.

We also ate the Feijoada, which is a traditional dish made with Brazilian sausage and long-stewed smoked meat (that falls off the bone...). Because the meat is cooked for a long time, it has completely absorbed the many flavorful herbs and spices they use and it's delicious without being overly exotic. It is nearly black, so at first glance it may not appear really appetizing... trust me, just put a bite of it in your mouth and you'll forget about the color. They serve it in a stew with black beans, and bring a healthy portion of rice, sautéed collard greens, farofa (excellent), and orange slices on the side.

We coupled the meal with the refreshing traditional drink called Caipirinha, which is similar to the ubiquitous Cuban Mojito... but better in my opinion because these have a significant portion of muddled lime in the drink and it is totally addictive. I could drink 10 of these... although the bartender recommended we stop at 2 or 3 because he says they will \"sneak up on you\". I'll take his word for it.

One more suggestion: Grab an order of the cheese bread balls called Pão de queijo right at the beginning. They bake them fresh on order, and believe me when I say, you and your kids are going to love these things. We found out about them years ago from my aunt, and believe it or not they are gluten free, and you can order the mix on Amazon Prime :) Basically, it's a cheesy doughy ball of hot bread that rounds out the entire meal very nicely. I think it comes in a basket of 6, which for two of us was too many (a welcome surprise because now I have left-overs!)

All in all, I'd say this place has successfully embraced the Brazillian Kitchen concept very nicely. The decorations around the restaurant are very personal so make sure you take a few minutes to appreciate them. We spoke with Phil the owners husband and he has a really interesting background and most of the decorations have a story behind them.

The prices are very reasonable, they provide a happy hour, and Fridays do live music and dancing with a Brazillian flair. Overall, we're very happy to have this new Gem in our neighborhood and we hope anyone in the area looking for a great option to the ubiquitous Southwest food gives it a visit. 

We've lived in this North Scottsdale area for two decades and I've been up this way for three (first graduating class from Cactus Shadows!) We've (unfortunately) seen a lot of businesses come and go. 

We hope this is one of the few that survives. It's our new \"favorite\" according to my wife."}
{"text":"A local family owned business that deserves your support! Carvalho's saved my wedding dinner by providing us with last minute catering service far exceeding our expectations. As the days before our wedding started to become stressful, and plans fell apart, Phil reminded us that \"God will make a way\", and showed us exactly how. He was very accommodating, gave us great advice, and gave us a wonderful service both in restaurant, and at our event. Everything was beautiful. 

At the restaurant we recommend their signature Brazilian cocktail, chicken fritters, and seafood stew! For catering, they will help you decide what's best for your party.

Living in East Mesa, I will say this restaurant is well worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's birthday! Wonderful food. Honestly, their chips were so addicting I had to stop myself from eating more or else I would be too full for dinner.

Ended up getting a soup for dinner and sampled some of my friend's food. Everything was marvelous and would recommend coming here!

Wonderful service as well! The owner came to greet us and explained his thought process behind designing the restaurant, which I thought was a really sweet gesture."}
{"text":"I love traditional Brazilian food and I have spent years traveling all over Brazil so I have a good idea what good Brazilian food actually is. Unfortunately after some very high hopes and expectations, Carvalho's did not meet the grade.  My wife ordered the Bobo de Camarao, my two kids each ordered the Picanha, and I had the steak sandwich with tenderloin tips...which I have to admit was not very Brazilian but the waitress highly recommended it. For starters we ordered some cheese bread \"Pao do Quiejo\" and also some coixinha. Lets begin.... the chips they served after we sat down tasted and looked like they just came from a bag....very commercial tasting and not a great first impression. The cheese bread was fine, but I find $5 for a basket of 6 to be ridiculous as most restaurants serve bread for free once the meal is ordered. If they want to give you a true flavor of Brazil...give the bread for free!! The coixinha was quite tasty and I would order it again.  My wife's dish was bland and she could not even identify the flavors it was so simple. The kids' Picanha was tasty and well cooked, but my son got a piece that was much smaller then my daughter's and his piece also had a huge piece of fat on it, abut 1/3rd of the entire piece that he had to cut off. My daughter's piece had a very small piece of fat on it and was a much nice piece of meat. We made a comment to the waitress when she came by to check on us and she said she would mention it to the kitchen. If she did we never knew abut it as nothing was ever said to us. My steak sandwich, although of good quality products, was absolutely tasteless. I could not be more serious when I tell you that a Jersey Mike's cheesesteak has a ton more flavor and that costs $7.25, not $17...scary!  It seems to me that the spice rack was locked up for the day as overall flavor was just not there. I am sad to report this because I truly hoped for a great meal. Unfortunately it was our first and last meal at Carvalhos as it is just not worth the price of over $100 for the four of us, no alcohol or even sodas, just tap water and the food mentioned.  Lastly, but not least... the service from our waitress Kristy...sorry if I spelled that incorrectly...was very good. She was attentive, friendly, and did a great job, albeit she did not cook or season the food.  Sorry Carvalhos.... you have a good idea, but you need to make some changes in order to have some longevity in the restaurant business. There is plenty of room for good, flavorful, quality food in Scottsdale, but you are not there yet on the flavorful aspect. Good luck and if you change things up, send me an invite and we will give you another try."}
{"text":"I had feijoada and pao de queijo it awesome. They give you banana chips while you wait and that's great also. I sat outside and it was really nice. Great atmosphere for a date. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"As a Brazilian living in the US for a while I've been dying to have some good authentic Brazilian food and I finally found it at Carvalho's. Excellent food and service. I felt I was back in Brazil."}
{"text":"Always friendly service.  Been here a half dozen times.  Nice and quiet setting if you want to relax.  All of their food is pretty good.  They have an awesome Seafood Coconut based stew that can also be vegetarian with Heart's of Palm.  We get some variation of this dish everytime.  Only issue we've ever had is their bartender is only so so, but the food is great."}
{"text":"From the caipirinhas and coxina de frango at the beginning of the meal to the brigadeiros at the end, this place truly transported you to (back to) Brazil in a truly genuine way. Almost brought me to tears to taste such authentic flavors and recipes here now to see that it's gone is such a loss  I hope they can regroup in a more populous, diverse area of Phoenix"}
{"text":"Nice place with live music. Our first time here. I had the signature Brazilian cocktail, really good! I had the culotte steak with grilled pineapple and potato salad, meh. But my sister in law had the shrimp in acorn squash and raved about it. All in all enjoyable."}
{"text":"Oh dear.  DO NOT GO for dinner to this overstretched, lackluster restaurant.  Although the two main Brazilian dishes are fine (and ought to be at a Brazilian restaurant), the service was terrible (really terrible), from the hostess who stuck us by the band, then moved us by the toilets, until one of our party who is a regular asked for one of the three empty tables by the windows, which we were told were reserved for people that request them.  Are you kidding?  No one sat in them all night!  The appetizers came slowly, the meals came in an hour, after being told that they did not have a couple menu items, with the kitchen apologizing for the delay by running out of rice.  AT A FLIPPING BRAZILIAN RESTARANT!  Where practically everything is served with rice.  So you tell me, bad planning or what?  Management did remove the cost  of one plate, yet it certainly wasn't worth the drive. We all had a good laugh, but hey, you can find better.  Eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"This was our first time there and during AZ Restaurant Week. We live around the corner and no idea why we have not been there several times already. Very warm and comfortable atmosphere and just a nice place to enjoy a great meal. The owner/management and all staff were very warm, helpful and sociable. The steak, seafood, appetizers and cheese bread were artfully prepared and efficiently served. We were also privileged to enjoy a brief discussion with the owner Phil who joined us and told us of his vision for Carvalho's success. We highly recommend Carvalho's Brazilian Kitchen for a fine dining experience"}
{"text":"First time at this establishment and we had the good fortune to be seated in Karina's section of the warm and inviting dining room.

My beautiful wife ordered a traditional meal with steak, black beans, rice and a cabbage salad. The temperature of the steak was perfect and all of the sides were delicious!

I had the Moqueca de Peixe or, seafood stew. Wow! A large filet of fish with shrimp and the most amazing sauce I have ever had in any seafood stew!

If you've been thinking about it but haven't pulled the trigger yet do yourself a favor and get here!

The place is very clean and there are two large patios of which at least one is pet friendly. 

We will undoubtedly return.

Thank you again Karina!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, and my husband who lived in Brazil as a missionary felt like it wS the best the valley has to offer! Glad we got to try it out!"}
{"text":"Great find.  Excellent steak and seafood stew.  The appetizer was on point with the hot sauce.  All authentic dishes.  As a self proclaimed foodie, it is worth a visit"}
{"text":"I was shopping on Groupon & came across a deal for Carvalho's which was a restaurant that I had bookmarked on Yelp quite a while ago so I couldn't pass up the opportunity. My husband & I had date night planned with a drive up to the restaurant on Saturday night. We arrived a bit earlier that anticipated (around 5:30pm) so it was fine that we didn't have a reservation however by the end of our dinner, we saw that other guests weren't able to get a table on the patio since the tables were reserved & most of the tables inside were also full so I'd recommend calling in ahead of time for anything after 6:00pm.

On to the food itself - it was good! We overheard the owner talking to a couple other groups & he was saying how all the dishes on the menu were his wife's family recipes. They really seemed to have items that took a while to develop flavor, like stews. Our server made some recommendations so we went ahead with a few of those -- Pao De Queijo (Brazilian Cheese Bread) to start and Moqueca de Peixe (Seafood Stew), & Feijoada (Black Bean Stew) for dinner.

The Cheese Bread was different than I expected but good. It had a very mild cheese flavor & wasn't super cheesy but still tasty, it came out freshly baked, piping hot! My husband & I agreed that we both liked the Seafood Stew more than the Black Bean Stew due to the flavor. There were large shrimp & a sizable piece of fish in this dish making it very filling. The Black Bean Stew did come with multiple items to eat together which was different, my husband enjoyed it.

If I were in the area, I'd consider stopping by but probably wouldn't go out of my way again. The service was a bit slow but still attentive, no complaints. We were in a bit of a hurry to leave but if I do go back, I'll save space for dessert - specifically, the flan!"}
{"text":"Wow this place is awesome.  It's kind of on the fancy side so if you have kids, beware.  We brought our two young kids so it can be done but just wanted to give you a heads up.  Definitely not a good idea to bring them on a date night.

Food is awesome.  We came during lunch in the middle of the week.  They weren't busy but the food took forever which kind of sucked, especially when half your party are minors but at the end of our meal the chef/owner came by our table to check up on us which I thought was a nice touch.  

Having had Brazilian food in Brazil, I think this place has really nice flavor.  Not 100% authentic but my mom who lived in brazil for over a decade even asked to bring home their hot sauce oil so I'd say it was pretty darn close!"}
{"text":"Food was mediocre. We waited an hour for entrees and they came out cold. Drinks were weak. Waiter needed more training.  Manager did not handle situation graciously."}
{"text":"Please take the time to visit this fantastic, authentic Brazilian gem. You will be treated to traditional home style meals created by the owners father and restaurant's name sake.  We ate the Moqueca de Peixe (Fish Stew) which tasted like a treasured family recipe and indeed was. Elegantly simple, tastefully spiced, the ingredients were fresh and mouth watering. As a bonus, Phil and Gabriel made my wife and me feel like family with their easy going manner. The history of how this place was created is a fascinating story passionately told by Phil which takes you from the Amazon river to Arizona. We certainly hope to dine here again. We would encourage all of you to spend an evening here too. You will not regret it. Senhor Carvahlo must have been a very loved and cherished gentleman. The restaurant reflects his passion and ensures his legacy. Obrigado!"}
{"text":"We were visiting Scottsdale with friends and found this gem on Yelp! There were 8 of us including 4 kiddos and one of my boys wanted apple juice to drink. Phil the owner went to the store and bought the juice himself and returned with it to the table!!! They treated us like family :)
The food was absolutely delicious- authentic Brazilian food and drinks. My husband was a little skeptical but he thoroughly enjoyed himself. 
Great food great service!! On our Next trip to Scottsdale we will be back!"}
{"text":"What a cute friendly family-owned restaurant. The shrimp bobo was delicious and also the baked acorn squash dish. Started with some Brazilian Cheese Bread - fantastic. Ended with the chocolate cake - omg. This place is the real deal!"}
{"text":"Wonderful on every word! You always feel welcome, and treated like a friend.
Food is delicious, service outstanding, and music great!
The chocolate cake desert is to die for!
Best caipirinhas in town
Is like being in Brazil!"}
{"text":"We so enjoyed everything about our experience. From the owners to the fabulous start of our meal with the Brazilian Bites.Do not miss out and order them.The food was excellent and service impeccable. Loretta B"}
{"text":"We found this place through a Groupon and I had imagined that it was one of those places where you were served slices of meat from servers walking around with rotisserie skewers. I was very wrong and the ensuing dinner was fantastic. 

My wife had the Feijoada (Black Bean Stew) which was very favorable and I had the Moqueca De Peixe which is a Seafood Stew featuring a large mahi-mahi filet and shrimp. Both excellent choices.

We also had two Brazilian beers, pricy, but high in flavor and alcohol."}
{"text":"Fabulous little place. We were treated very well. The owner was very attentive. He took the time to tell our party the story of how the restaurant came to be. The service we received from our server was extraordinary. He took the time to explain the dishes and answer questions. The food was the best I have had out in a very long time. The people that work at this restaurant should be very proud."}
{"text":"My husband and I had the best time at dinner - we had never had Brazilian cuisine and were interested to try this place. Mind. Blown.  From the moment we walked in to the time we left it, was a great experience for date night. The host (I did not catch his name, sorry) was very friendly and pointed us to the patio where they have a hammock, if I wouldn't have been in a dress I would have jumped in. Our waiter, Gabriel, was on point and very personable - we had no idea what to order and he walked us through some of the more popular items and was very knowledgeable of everything on the menu.  The owner came over to say hi and was very welcoming and went through some of his / the restaurant's history which was fun to hear.  We ordered caipirinhas with muddled fruit and they were very refreshing - our waiter was very sweet when we explained we were googling what they were and went into more depth on how the spirits were made. We started with the coxinha de franga which Gabriel explained were served with hot sauce and it was game over. They were amazing, as was the hot sauce. For our main courses we ordered coxinha de franga and the seafood stew. Again, mind. blown. We had no idea what to expect for flavors and were very surprised in a great way, we hadn't had anything like it before and we're big on trying new things so we figured it would resemble something. The portions are very large so we tried not to inhale the main courses so we could try a dessert - we were already planning our next visit and what we wanted to try next time while enjoying the flan.  Overall just a great experience and place - highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"This place is always great! The food and service are always top notch. The plantain chips are delicious. I had salmon and my husband had the ranchers steak. We managed to save room for dessert - the ice cream cake was worth it! 

We do not get there as often as I would like (I travel a lot) but this is one of our favorites!"}
{"text":"Best restaurant we've been to in a long time!! The food was spectacular! We loved sitting outside listening to the water. Our waiter was very knowledgeable. The owner came by to check in & explain some of the dishes which was very helpful. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"First timers... Nice place and spotlessly clean.

Unique menu with some interesting dishes that were explained extremely well by Cody, our server. Cody was attentive and helpful with his recommendations.

The food was great with a nice presentation. Plenty to take home for lunch the next day.

The owner came by to introduce himself and told us the story of the unique Amazon artifacts on display. 

We WILL go back!"}
{"text":"We liked this place! The service is incredibly warm, welcoming and friendly...the prices are reasonable, and the ambiance -- we sat on the side outdoor patio -- is very pleasant. We really enjoyed the signature Brazilian cocktail, and the food was nice. Not a \"foodie\" destination by any means, but the sort of place that will have us coming back whenever we want a comfortable meal in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Exceptional: service, ambiance & food with great prices.  Beautiful artwork is a bonus."}
{"text":"I had s wonderful time... enjoyed the food, drinks, and ambience, it all truly brought back great memories of my time spent in Rio! I also enjoyed the conversations with the owner, and the attentiveness of the waiters. Looking forward to returning when there is live music! Obrigado!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent! Awesome service, food and live music! Torta bis desert (ice creak cake) was frozen and not that great, otherwise awesome."}
{"text":"Wow! My husband and I loved everything about Carvalho's! The service was great! Our waiter was more than willing to explain every dish and how they were prepared. The food exceeded our expectations. Wonderful flavors, ample portions and a very interesting variety! The ambiance was very lovely as well.  We were very pleased to be approached by staff as well as the owner as to our experience. One definitely doesn't find that in the \"chain\" restaurants.  Definitely an A-1! We will be telling our friends and return SOON!"}
{"text":"I understand it's the beginning of AZ restaurant week.  I understand they had a server injure themselves and need to be taken by the manager to the hospital for stitches.  I understand one other server quit and one had to be fired for coming to work under the influence.  BUT.  The restaurant wasn't packed and it literally took 3 hours to eat a meal with only 4 courses and our group took desert to go.   Even if you're short a couple of servers, ok, fine dishes come out 15-30 minutes late.  But there is no excuse for the kitchen to take 2 and a half hours to get main entrees out.  And having worked in a restaurant in the past, you generally try to make sure tables get served together.  Not one person at a time with 10 minutes between people. I'm sorry.  That just isn't gonna cut it

That being said.  We had enough people that everyone was able to order something different and our table managed to order the whole restaurant week menu between the 6 of us.  We shared the food and everything was delicious.  Really quality food.  Everything properly seasoned and cooked and made sense.   Didn't have a bad bite...once we actually got to take a bite. Although putting quality linguisa in anything can make it tasty!  I really hope that the staff can get their act together because the flavors are unique and would be welcome in the Phoenix food scene."}
{"text":"This place was very good! Probably one of my new favorite restaurants in the area. We had the traditional steak meal and mahi mahi. Both were very tasty and flavorful. The patio is really nice to sit outside at, with plenty of shade, nice plants, and water features. The service was also wonderful. Make sure to try their spicy caipirinha, which is like a spicy margarita. Try the fruit one if you don't like spicy, it was also good."}
{"text":"Was very impressed with the service.  We celebrated our wedding anniversary and they made it special.  The owner came out and was very kind.  To top it off the food was awesome.  Can guarantee I will make the drive from Goodyear to Scottsdale to enjoy again!"}
{"text":"Tranquil, Delicious, Flawless

We were visiting the area for a couple of days and were looking up some food recommendations nearby. Carvalho's cuisine and high ratings stood out to us right away, and after talking to a few locals we were convinced. 
The place looked quite empty on a Sunday night, but don't let this fool you. The tranquil ambiance, the dimmed lights, the decor featuring Brazilian art and the friendliness of the staff looked very promising. 

While we were navigating the menu where all the options looked delicious, the owner came out to greet us. We ended up going with a steak with palm hearts, grilled pineapple and salsa; and shrimp with mahi-mahi in coconut sauce served with rice. 
Needless to say, we cleaned up our plates and my husband, who is not a reviewer, told me: \"We should write a review when we get back\".
 The only downside of Carvalho's is that it's about 3,000 miles away :)"}
{"text":"Always excited to see a new place open up in this area and especially when it is a locally owned restaurant with some really delicious Brazilian food.

This review is for a Saturday lunch that we enjoyed on their beautiful patio that overlooks a cool little relaxing water feature. The weather was beautiful and the patio chairs were actually comfortable. Nice!

Got there right when they opened and started off with a couple appetizers and then shared a dinner portion. We ordered the Espetinho de Camarao (grilled shrimp) and some Bolinho de Bacalhau (fish cakes) and they were very tasty. I could have easily eaten a couple dozen of those shrimps myself.

Next went with the famous Feijoada off the dinner menu. This is a smoked meat dish with black beans and a bunch of killer condiments and veggies to add to your dish. The combination of flavors and textures were out of this world.

Service was friendly and we were greeted by one of the owners at the door. The complimentary fried plantain chips that they brought to our table were a nice surprise and definitely a treat. We make these at home and theirs were both cooked and seasoned perfectly.

This is a nice place check out and they also have a good selection of wines and beers to get you grooving. I think they even have live music during certain times of the week.

We will most likely be back soon to try out some more of their interesting menu items. These are flavors that you do not see much is this part of town and the prices and portions are very reasonable for north Scottsdale. SOUNDS LIKE A FLAN!

4.5 STARS"}
{"text":"Everything is awesome!  You can't go wrong with this place.  The staff are attentive and the food in soooo delicious!  Very happy to have found this place."}
{"text":"This restaurant serves the real deal, truly great Brazilian cuisine. I, my Brazilian girlfriend and my parents had a delicious meal and we all had nothing but high praise for everything that was brought to the table. We each had something unique from the menu and each plate was excellent in itself. However, what set this place apart was how the food was brought out... everything was served \"family style.\" We all shared our plates and the each flavor complemented the next perfectly. Not many restaurants can present such a cohesive menu. Additionally, the service was very good and the owner's husband brought out a complimentary appetizer for the table. Carvalho's is one of the best restaurants in Phoenix and a must-try for anyone interested in Brazilian culture and food."}
{"text":"There's many Brazilian steakhouses in the valley, some chains that give a \"corporate\" experience and there are some that try to give an authentic dining experience.

Started off with a Caipirinha (traditional Brazilian cocktail) that made made perfectly- the right mixture of lime, sugar and cachaca.  

Had two appetizers, the cheese bread which to me was slightly under cooked but very good and fried casava which was excellent.

Since we weren't to hungry we ordered the Feijoada, which again is a traditional Brazilian dish with rice, black beans that have sausage and smoked meat with a small side of greens and a vinaigrette that perfectly balances out the dish. I was absolutely amazed at the taste and the layers of flavor.

The staff was incredible, the food definitely homemade and everyone there seemed really to care about the guests and food.  This so far is on my top ten list of the valley"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the food here! I'm Brazilian and true Brazilians can be very picky about the food seasoning and just that perfect flavor that takes you back home when enjoyed. 
Every chance I get, this is always my restaurant of choice, Carvalho's Brazilian Kitchen. 
Try it, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"The high reviews are warranted.  The happy hour is fantastic - all manner of fried things and delicious caipirinhas for next to nothing (and you can eat anywhere - you aren't put in \"bar time-out\" in uncomfortable chairs).   

The apps were delicious and I look forward to returning for a meal-meal."}
{"text":"Delicious! Everything I had from appetizer to dessert was amazing. The seafood stew is a must have and the coconut-filled chocolate cake is so rich. Great service as well. Highly, highly recommend."}
{"text":"What do you mean closed? Closed for good? Nooooooo!! Nooooooo! Please come back! Why did you close?

I moved to AZ recently and this place was the only option to get Brazilian food (not steakhouse, rodízio style, but real Brazilian food). Everything was so tasteful, I was going there everyday after church, and would always leave so happy and satisfied.

I don't understand!!?

What went wrong? The service was great, food was fantastic, what happened? Are you opening somewhere else? I went there on Sunday and everything was gone, I even cried!

Come back Carvalhos, please don't leave me."}
{"text":"Service was wonderful for lunch. Food was great, steak and chicken grilled vegetables salad.  Huge fans!!!"}
{"text":"First time there and will definitely be back!!!
Amazing flavor!!
Great service!!
Try the house drink!!"}
{"text":"This place rocks. We went on  Saturday night to celebrate mothers day. We were greeted warmly by the owners. They asked where we wanted to be seated because we had our 9 month old  and 2 and half old with us and they wanted us to be comfortable. They were so warm to us and so kind. The kids even started laughing when the owners talked to them. We order some drinks. I got their classic Brazilian beer and it was good. Very refreshing. Everyone that ordered loved their food. I personally got the steak topped with an egg and the steak was perfectly cooked. The also had a love band playing Saturday night and my 2 and half old loved dancing to their music. A great establishment to celebrate any occasion or simply for a night out for dinner."}
{"text":"Nice experience. Lovely room, with generous space between tables. Attentive servers. Imaginative cuisine at good prices. Excellent steak, with a quality that exceeds the price. The shrimp dish was fantastic. With the owner having lived in Brazil, this is authentic stuff. This restaurant fills a gap-- actually makes its own place -- in the Scottsdale restaurant scene and is definitely worth a try -- as is the chocolate cake. Wow."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, great service and helpful, knowledgeable staff.   Far superior to Fogo de Chao...this is like coming to someone's home for dinner."}
{"text":"I'm not entirely sure what compelled Ruth Carvalho and her husband Phil Marstellar to move to the valley after decades together in the Amazon.  But its clear their partnership has brought the valley something truly special and unique.  When you think of Brazilian food (if you ever think of Brazilian food to begin with) thoughts that come to mind would likely include barbecue or one of those all you can eat meat orgies like Fogo de Chao offers.  For the most part, Carvalho's wants nothing to do with that.  Here its about a variety of traditional home cooked meals that you would sit down to at a typical Brazilian household.  Armed with a meager knowledge of Brazilian cuisine and an empty stomach, I approached Carvalho's for lunch on a Saturday.

Carvalho's is embedded in the Safeway shopping complex on the northeast corner of Scottsdale and Pinnacle Peak Roads.  On the north side of the shopping center (a few doors to the right of the Ace Hardware), you'll find Carvalho's tucked away in this busy complex.  Despite appearances from the parking lot, Carvalho's is quite large with seating for upwards of at least 100-125 inside and another 20-30 outside.  Even more surprising is how tiny the bar is relative to the rest of the restaurant with seating for no more than a dozen patrons.  I grabbed one of the aforementioned bar seats and let bartender Jose take charge of my lunch this go around.  Plantain chips come free on the house as soon as you sit down.

Not wanting to order anything that didn't resemble authentic traditional Brazilian fare, I did what any responsible foodie would do.  I looked up Brazilian cuisine on Wikipedia in advance.  Putting my newfound knowledge to work, a Caipirinha was my drink of choice.  Lime, cane sugar, and Cachaca 61 (a sugarcane based hard liquor).  The national cocktail of Brazil is indeed a refreshing delight that would be ideal for a day on the beach.  For my appetizer, I got an order of Brazilian cheese bread, known as Pao de Queijo.  Six pieces to a lunch order.  No butter is served with these and there's no need for it.  Hot, super soft bread made of cassava flour and a variety of cheeses.  The bread stands on its own as a warm, pleasant, cheesy, chewy snack.  For my main dish, why its the national dish of Brazil of course.  A black bean stew known as Feijoada.   Beans, smoked pork, smoked sausage, and rib meat with a side of rice, collared greens, farofa, vinagrette, and orange slices.  The orange slices are meant to act as palette cleanser, but otherwise just mix in everything else together.  A quick note that you will have to pick out the rib bones and some bay leaves before diving in head first.  Really hearty stick to your ribs dish.  Probably works better as a dinner staple as this dish will surely induce a food coma for some, but nevertheless a tasty mix of meats and seasonings.  And you'll want to apply every bit of that farofa and vinaigrette to enhance the flavors that much more.  For the big finish, it was the Brigadeiros.  Brazilian chocolate truffles served cold and made of chocolate, condensed milk, and butter and topped with chocolate sprinkles.  I was already pretty full from the stew so these were the perfect bite sized finishers.

Total cost for the food, drink, tax, and tip came to about $45.  Per Jose, the dinner portions of many of these items are larger (particularly the stew) and are priced a bit higher so bear that mind.  If you're trying Brazilian food for the first time here, I absolutely recommend you grab a Caipirinha and one of their stews to get acclimated.  I should also note they play Brazilian music in the background here and there's live Brazilian music on Saturday nights.  I'm not sure if I'll ever visit Brazil in my lifetime, but thanks to Ruth and Phil I've now gotten a taste of what I might expect to eat if I do.  And if first impressions are any indication, I'm intrigued."}
{"text":"Food was very tasty,not spicy hot. Everything was prepared well. The service was excellent and the owner came around twice to talk and asked to let him know if there were why problems that he could improve on. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Service was supurb.  The menu was described in full and the waiter made a few recommendations.  We started with a few non alcoholic drinks.  The sugar free mando ice tea was excellent.  There were five of us and we all had something different.  The Brazilian potato salad was a hit with those that liked olives.  The steaks flavorful.  The bean soup one of the best ever.  The only disappointment was the fired ribs.  They were extremely dry.  My steak salad was fine except the toppings we're at the bottom of the bowl so I was eating greens with steak.  The restaurant is beautiful.  However it is very dark so you cannot see your food.  The outdoor patio looked nice but the temperature a little too warm to give it a try."}
{"text":"So happy to have found this little gem!  Was in North Scottsdale on business and needed to find a place to take clients for dinner.  Thank you, Yelp reviewers!  So much to like here.  First off, the service was awesome.  Servers were charming and so helpful; ours was Brazilian herself so was intimately familiar with what was completely new to us.  Food was terrific, the wine list was great - had a lovely bottle to go with our meals, which we ate \"family style\" so that we could each try everything.  I won't even attempt the Brazilian names, but we had the acorn squash with shrimp, the black bean stew, the halibut and the steak (picanha).  Also tried the flan and the capuacu mousse for dessert - very unique! Honestly, there wasn't anything that we didn't think was terrific.  Also, so fun to see the artifacts and photos that the owner collected during his boyhood in the Amazon.   Very much looking forward to going back as soon as possible!"}
{"text":"I thought the place was nice but the food was quite Americanized. Service, location, cleanliness were 5+ stars. Wine selection was small but acceptable. Cheese bread was not bad. Feijoada wasn't really a mix of meat and beans- it was a straight up meat stew. The real one is a black bean stew with pieces of meat in it but this one was a bowl of what looked like pulled pork with very few beans, almost like a garnish. The flavor was bland but not bad. Probably good for someone who has never spent time in Brazil. Overall, a nice place. If I was in the area I may pop in but wouldn't go out of my way to visit."}
{"text":"Excellent service and the food was delicious.  The owners are friendly and make you feel at home.  The décor is nice with interesting Brazilian ethnic artifacts.  I will most definitely go again and especially at happy hour."}
{"text":"What a great Brazilian experience!  Will go again!! The service was outstanding and the dishes were authentic.  Fantastic!"}
{"text":"Good flavors, quiet ambiance, wish they had a better wine selection. Service was good (above average) the pasteis AP was good- the sauce was flavorful and spicy, my steak was cooked perfectly (Med rare) and the potato salad was delicious..but my wife's halibut was over-however, the flavors made up for the error. 
Solid 4 stars"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. The food is delusions. We sat outside. They had a very nice water feature. 
The servers are very friendly and attentive. 

We had the vegetarian potato soup Cadi Verde- out of this world. The Maqueca de Peixe was very tasty. 

The ambience was quiet and we were able to have a nice conversation."}
{"text":"I was super pleased to see the menu for this restaurant and I couldn't wait to try it. It's a pleasant change from the typical Brazilian steakhouses or Churrascarias because I am not a big meat eater. We went for happy hour and ordered the coxinha de Frango, mandioca frita, pão de queijo, and prato feito (chicken, Rice, and beans). Everything came promptly and was delicious! I was there mainly for the coxinha (my favorite) as it is hard to get in the valley. 

The only thing stopping me from giving 5 stars is the lack of flavor in the beans and rice. I've spent time with a lot of Brazilians cooking at home and have high expectations for those two staple items in the Brazilian cuisine. Overall great place and nice service. I will be back for more!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, service and atmosphere! I am a serious foodie and I loved it! 

I tried to find their menu online so I could name the dishes but I didn't find one. My fiancé had a chicken dish that had been marinated in beer and I had a traditional Brazilian smoked meat stew. Both were de-lish!

They have a sommalier who helped us choose wine and beer. He suggested a Malbec with my stew. I was skeptical because I've never had what I considered to be a good Malbec. Usually, it's too weak-tasting for me. Surprise! The Malbec here was very complex and rich...changed my mind entirely about Malbec. My fiancé got a beer that was a Brazilan craft beer and was also rich and delicious. Note: the beer was 20 ounces, you might want to share one or designate a driver.

As it also happens, I don't like rice. Instead of ordering a substitution, I decided to try the dish the way it was traditionally served.The rice that came with the stew was delicious! 

Yummy chocolate coconut cake for desert was kind of like German Chocolate cake with the coconut icing between the layers and chocolate icing and sprinkles on top. Definitely enough for 2 or 3 people to share. 

There is a beautiful little pond right by the patio and they had lots of heat lamps. It was very romantic. Each person that spoke to us gave us a little background on Brazilian culture and food. 

The prices were reasonable (for Scottsdale) and the portion sizes were good. 

It's just a matter of time before people are lined up out the door to get in here!"}
{"text":"My husband and I made a special trip and it was well worth it. The food was amazing, drinks were fabulous, and the service was top notch. Phil, the owner, even stopped by our table. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"It was a nice place, I had the Frijolada which is a very popular Brazilian dish. Nice out door sitting."}
{"text":"Wow!!!! This place is a gem!!! The food is unbelievable!!! Cozy and friendly staff. Dined here with a few friends and I was blown away at the service and the food. The appetizers were amazing, particularly the Coxinha!!! Wow!!!! Melts in your mouth. We also ordered the Bolinho de bacalhau and for a meal the feijoada. All amazing!!! If you want something different, come visit this restaurant. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The food was really good!
The ambience is really nice, the music on the background it's not so loud but enough to change your mood.
The service was outstanding, we have 2 little kids and usually you \"notice\" when kids are not welcome at some restaurants, well we were honestly greeted and welcome by everyone including the owner who approached to our table to see if we were doing ok.
We will definitely coming back.
Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"Great location!  I actually appreciate a Latin restaurant opening on my neighborhood.  It feels I have to drive long distances to find one, but not anymore.  It is family owned, and you realize that from the moment the daughter's owner greets you warmly at the door. The owner came to our table and the son explained the menu and gave us some recipes. There is live music,  and a great ambiance. I just wished there were more options for dinner dishes on the menu, more natural juices as is custom in latin countries  (less soda) and that the appetizers had better prices, so i can try from everything, but based on the location prices are understandable. Overall it was a good experience.  I plan to be back."}
{"text":"Wonderful food and atmosphere. Authentic. Brazilian food, loved the Mahi Moqueca. Also a highlight is the feijoada. On weekends great Live music with Brazilian artists, not to miss!"}
{"text":"Had a pleasant dining experience here. I was looking for exotic fare in Scottsdale and found this place.  It did not disappoint. We had to of course try the Feijoada and the Caipirinha and they were just absolutely fantastic. The Feijoada was a tad salty but not incredibly so. The owner did ask us about it so have a sense that they care for what they do. He was also very engaging and told us a little story about how the restaurant came about which is an added treat for us. Ensure you have an appetite as you would want to take everything.

{"text":"My husband wanted to try something new so we gave this place a shot. I am a very picky eater and I was thoroughly impressed. They give you plantain chips to munch on while you're waiting and they were delicious! We had three servings of them and they also gave me a box to take home. We ordered the marinated shrimp, which was perfectly cooked and had a great flavor.  I had the shrimp bobo( can't even remember what it was really called and I don't want to mess it up). It was delicious! The flavor combinations were so good and the shrimp was cooked perfectly again. My husband had the black rice stew with all the meat in it( couldn't pronounce it if I tried) and he was very impressed. Our server was great. He was very knowledgeable about everything on the menu and was very attentive and friendly. The manager came by to check on us and the owner came to introduce himself and thank us for coming in. The overall experience was great and we will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. We waited well over an hour for our food. When we left it still wasn't ready so we left hungry, without eating. Don't go!
This is the first time we have ever left a restaurant-this not our usual practice. We ordered our food at 7:40. I really care what time was on our ticket-not our problem. When we left at 9:00, we were told it would be another 10 minutes, but the could not guarantee it would not be longer. This is way too long to wait for food. We eat out quite often.  Most restaurants cook food to order for each customer. Saying this is the reason our food was going to take 1 1/2 hours to serve is a pretty lame excuse."}
{"text":"The owners were very nice and checked in multiple times to make sure our party was satisfied.  Live music was a great plus and the overall atmosphere was pleasant.  

The picanha was excellent as was the moqueca de peixe and everything had generous portion sizes.

We would definitely return again the next time we're in Scottsdale.  

Certainly one of the better stateside Brazilian dining experiences I've had."}
{"text":"Great new place! We started with the Yucca Fries and Beef Skewers!  We then had the Feijoada and the Prato Feito Beef! Both were excellent dishes! Our server Austin was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu! We will return again!"}
{"text":"I'm brazilian and it's hard to impress me when I eat out in a brazilian restaurant.  I'm so happy I found out about this place! The food is the real thing. You can tell there  is a brazilian chef in the kitchen. Iam coming back and I'll bring my entire family with me!"}
{"text":"Went here on a whim after work with a coworker one day because it was \"one of those days.\" We sat at the bar and ate almost the entire appetizer menu. It was my first stab at Brazilian food, and I really enjoyed it! Joel the bartender was funny and very helpful in describing what we were ordering.  It's a family owned business. If you get the chance, chat with the whole family about their history. This place has character and I'll definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Great experience. The food was tasty. Exceeded my expectation. It was recommended by our server. The place is very clean and cozy. Great ambience with the music. Service was prompt and very pleasant. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Coming from some one who used to live in Brazil, this place is very genuine and very good. I recommend the Pão de Queijo (cheese bread) and  feijoada."}
{"text":"We went to Carvalhos for lunch and we found a nice gem in Scottsdale.  The restaurant is in a strip mall area and due to the color of the buildings, everything melds together, however, you can find it next to the hardware store.

They have pet-friendly outdoor seating patio on the front of the restaurant and a nice covered patio on the side with a nice stream along the side of it.  Great ambiance.  The inside is very clean and decorated appropriately.  There are some of the owners own memorabilia from his time growing up in Brazil.

The service was fantastic.  Our waitress Juliana was super friendly and gave us a great description of the menu and suggestions.  She was always on point with everything and with a genuine smile that was very warm.  Everything in the menu is the owner's wife's recipes.  Needless to say, they have a winner here.

This is a traditional Brazilian restaurant and not the all you can chow down meat on spike BBQ.  There is a nice selection for all for any taste.

We had the Picanha na Grelhada, one with the salsa and one with heart of palm.  The meat which was two decent size pieces of meat was cooked to perfection and had beautiful flavor that you know and love of Brazilian meats.  It was outstanding!  Perfect side dish's to accompany a perfect meal!  It really was great!  The only issue I had was the salad was a bit on the small size for $5.00. 

We completed this fine meal with a piece of their Vanilla Ice Cream Cake that has Kit Kat on the back and drizzled with chocolate.  Very good desert!  Needless to say, we were comfortable and all tasted great.  

The place is not cheap as lunch for two was $98.  However, the quality, of the food was great, the taste was fantastic and the service was spot on dynamite.  I guess you get what you pay for and here at Carvalhos, it is a great dining experience!  Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Great family run Brazilian restaurant. Phil they owner mans the bar and makes these amazing drinks with muddled limes and rum. The food is very good. Later we had the pour over coffee with Flan. Delicious. Authentic Brazilian live music set the theme. We sat at the bar."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to this restaurant and we loved it. Authentic Brazilian food. I moved from Brazil 6 years ago and the food made me feel like I was home again. I will be returning again in the very near future."}
{"text":"This is a newly opened stylish family ran Brazilian Restaurant with a beautiful patio that sits by a running water feature with plantings.

They start everyone off with crispy plantain chips.

We started off with Pao de Queijo that are basically baked fresh to order chewy cheese puffs that are gluten free. They take 12 minutes to bake and came out piping hot and tasty. 

I had the cold chicken salad called Salpicao de Frango. I never had a chicken salad like this before. The chicken salad with studded with corn, peas, apples and raisins and topped with matchstick crispy potato chips that sat over fresh romaine. Somehow it was very refreshing and sort of seemed tropical to me.

My husband had the Feijoada that is a variety of meat and sausage in a black bean stew with rice and collard greens and condiments. He liked it very much and said he'd order it again the next time.

I thought the food we had was very good and the service was friendly and efficient.

********4.5 Stars******"}
{"text":"I went there for dinner Saturday only to find the space empty.
I'm so sad this resturant closed. The food has always been excellent and the service always friendly. 
I will miss rhis place."}
{"text":"Awesome food, friendly and professional staff. Met the owner and he couldn't have been any nicer. Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for the new lunch menu. Really really good deep fried pork ribs and black bean soup.  

The staff was attentive and timing was perfect. 

The place has a great high end feel and is really clean.  The owners are in there a lot of the time and it has a family feel."}
{"text":"This is one of my new favorite restaurants! The ambiance is lovely (a couple charming patios) & the live Brazilian music really adds an extra flair! I dined with 4 other family members and we all had excellent meals. From the plantain chips, cheese bread, chicken fritters & yucca, to the multiple steak entrees and shrimp dishes, everything was extremely flavorful and prepared beautifully. Besides the food being fabulous, the service was fantastic as well. Our server was friendly, attentive and knowledgeable and the owners visited our table multiple times throughout the evening to check on us. Overall, it was an extremely enjoyable and delicious dinner! We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"A great spot that gives you a more authentic and less corporate chance (I'm looking at you Fogo de Chao) to taste the diverse flavors of Brasil. The staff adds another layer to the experience and the love of their culture definitely shines through in their service, knowledge, and ambiance.  The dishes ordered were great and I hope that they soon expand their menu to include more dishes from the home regions of the Cavalho family."}
{"text":"Great experience from the moment we walked in. Friendly staff and principles.  

Started with Churrasquinho De Gato app... EXCELLENT!  Also the beef turnovers were delicious. Caldo Verde soup was also very good. 
Shared two entrees ... traditional seafood stew. Great flavors!  Only disappointment of the meal was their \"fried\" pork ribs. Too dry. Other than that we're looking forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"A true find. Phil, who owns the restaurant with his wife, introduced us to the menu and helped us make great choices. The food and the service were superb. We could have stayed (and eaten) for hours. A \"not to miss\" for Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Have lived in the neighborhood for 10 years so was looking forward to a new restaurant close by.

While our server was ok, i cant same the same for our food or presenation.  The \"De-boned\" chicken came out with all the bones in, and side dishes were bland/boring.  No offering to fix the mistakes either by reducing the bill, other than offering the bread as free.  Which we assumed it was already free as we didnt order it, and it wasnt much."}
{"text":"First of all, this place is a hidden treasure. We were slightly confused with the entrance but we figured out it was on the side. The staff was warm and welcoming upon our arrival. Our waitress, a young woman from Brazil, was absolutely wonderful! She was smart, attentive, informative and gave wonderful recommendations.

We came for an early early dinner and found out that we had the restaurant to ourselves. This didn't last long, but was such a treat to enjoy each other's company in such a lavish location with wonderful staff.

Phil, the owner, came out to talk to us about growing up in the Amazon and about the items on the menu. We were quite surprised to find out about his life and what led him to opening the restaurant. He made us feel right at home. We ordered the Brazilian Cheese Bread for our appetizer and it was.....simply incredible! The complimentary plantain chips that were refilled 3x's were amazing. I could eat those all day every day. I should've ordered more!!
My wife ordered one of the steak sandwiches while I ordered the steak PICANHA GRELHADA. I highly recommend the Picanha, what a wonderful steak seasoned just right....and cooked to perfection.

*Tip, substitute the potato salad for the cabbage salad. AMAZING! I would substitute the grilled pineapple for something else, mine was tough and REALLY charred.*

To end the meal, the staff surprised us with some homemade chocolate cake in celebration of my wife's birthday. Come to find out, the cake is Phil's mother-in-law's recipe and the cake is made daily by his wife. We felt like royalty!! What a lovely dining experience. I highly recommend Carvalho's to anyone out there."}
{"text":"It's our second time in the Scottsdale area and we came back to Carvalho's!  That should say plenty!  This is authentic Brazilian food rich in flavor and excellent, makes you feel like family kind of service. The fried cassava is a must have! The seafood stew is amazing, the kids meals are not like other restaurants, simple but authentic. Enjoyable, yummy, great atmosphere that is family friendly and group ready.  We will be back again for sure!!! Keep it up Carvalho's!"}
{"text":"This place uses only the freshest ingredients and has grass fed beef. This is authentic Brazilian cuisine and it was fantastic. Definitely coming back, plus they are gluten friendly."}
{"text":"Nothing but praise for this gem. We visited Carvalho's last weekend for my fiance's birthday celebration. 
Pleasant decor, comfortable seating and great service are some of the great things about this place. But nothing beats the amazing food hands down. Good happy hour drinks and excellent steak skewer appetizer.
For entries I had the salmon in passion fruit sauce and my other half had the steak. All the food tasted very fresh and tasty. A must visit restaurant for all food lovers."}
{"text":"Get yourself to this restaurant fast.  You need to try the amazing food and experience the fabulous service.  Everything our party of five ate was flavorful, expertly prepared and served.
I am gluten free and was delighted to find so many options on the menu to try.  The feijoada was an explosion of ingredients blended together for an unbelievable combination of deliciousness!!  I could have eaten just the pao de queijo (a gluten free cheese bread) but then would have missed out on the rest of the meal.
My only regret is that I am not a native and sadly must return to Minnesota soon."}
{"text":"My daughter and I went for lunch and couldn't believe how flavorful the food was.  Our server, Gabriel was amazing and excellent at offering suggestions and answering questions.  I can't wait to take my husband there because it was just fantastic."}
{"text":"Love the delicious Brazilian cuisine!! Food is made to order and its amazing! The cheese bread is a must have! very good! Staff is very friendly!"}
{"text":"I love Carvalhos! I would first like to prefice with that fact that I lived in Brasil and was an exchange student there and have returned to Brasil on many occasions. I LOVE Brasilian food and I LOVE Carvalhos!! The service, the food, the ambiance is amazing! Its literally like taking a vacation to a wonderful restaurant in Brasil. Have a caipirinha and relax and enjoy anything on the menu. Its fabulous!!!"}
{"text":"Been wanting to try Carvalho's for some time and finally gave them a try. Must say my wife and I were very impressed, nice quiet relaxing atmosphere, good service, great food and good prices. The owner and his family are basically running the restaurant and he stopped by our table to make sure we were enjoying our meal. Be sure to give them your support, as we need more places like this in our area."}
{"text":"This place is never busy when we go in and it makes no sense to me. It has great food and a very welcoming staff. If you idea of Brazilian food is a place with endless piles of meat from guys in a costume then this is the wrong place. This is a great place for seafood and Brazilian flavors (says the guy who has no frame of reference for what is Brazilian). ;-)

They start you with plantain chips that are addictive. They not sweet, but more of a potato chip experience. 

I have gotten the seafood stew each time I go and it is really good. There is layered fish and shrimp with a great sauce. But I must admit I am really most happy when I add the Brazilian hot sauce they bring on request. The waitress suggested we try some and now I and my friends are hooked."}
{"text":"Terrible service..took forever to get cutlery on the table, had to hunt down salt and pepper as that was never put on the table. Ordered a steak that came swimming in a sea of black beans..much more beans than steak. Steak was ordered medium and came back very overcooked..terrible food and service, would skip this place and go instead to a real steak house, there are plenty of better selections in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I was a little confused because the entrance was around the corner. Also the misters were on super high and my hair is not friends with moisture but that's a personal problem so I'll overlook that. 
We were greeted warmly and treated like we were the only customers there the whole evening even though we clearly weren't. We got the cheese bread appetizer, streak and halibut. The food was SOOOO delicious. I swapped out the asparagus for sautéed collard greens and holy moly I am so glad I did. Absolutely amazing. I also got the flan for dessert and I have to say, totally worth every calorie. The prices are reasonable, the food is excellent and the service was spot on!!"}
{"text":"Unique very tasty food, excellent service, nice ambiance and reasonable prices. Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful place!  After several days of eating hotel food, we decided to drive out and try a local restaurant.  I had the Bobo de Camarao.  It's very different from any 'Brazilian' food I've ever had, but it was very good.  The shrimp was very fresh.   A very unique dish!  Family owned and very interesting photographs in the walls."}
{"text":"Excellent family run Brazilian Restaurant.  They love their culture and heritage and want to share it with the community.  Service is consistently on par and the food is great.  Atmosphere is a step above nice and it feels like a very expensive restaurant but it is actually right at the edge of reasonable.  That makes it a great value and a neat place off the beaten path to bring clients and family from out of town."}
{"text":"Everything was excellent. I took my parents here to thank them for helping with the move, and I could not be more delighted. The atmosphere (we sat on the patio surrounded by cooling misters and a jungle-like creek) was unique and pleasant. The staff was extremely knowledgeable about the food and also ready with perfect suggestions (thanks Dylan!). We were visited by both the manager and the owner to make sure we were enjoying our evening, which is always a nice touch to feel well cared for.

The food. Dear lord the picanha was not only a fantastic cut and paired well with the grilled pineapple, it was simply one of the best cooked steaks I may have ever had - a perfect medium-rare that was seasoned lightly but flavorfully. My parents had the moqueca de peixe and the feijoada on suggestion and they were also delicious (though my steak was my favorite). I even wish I had a giant bag of the complimentary plantain chips always available in my pantry.

And do yourselves a favor - start with the cheese bread and a few caipirinhas, and end with the passion fruit mousse and a cafezinho. You may only regret it only because of the stuffed stomach - the portions are quite generous."}
{"text":"delicioso, gostoso, saboroso, apetitoso, atraente

Are there any other ways of saying yummy in Portuguese?
When Brazilian restaurant was suggested I didn't feel like eating that much meat from lunch. That's all I knew about Brazilian restaurant is just bunch of all you can eat meat.  When I read the yelp reviews, I was pleasantly surprised they have other form of Brazilian restaurant and this one just opened early this year.

When we got seated, the server brought us complimentary plantain chips.   It was slightly salty for my liking but it tasted like they just made them that morning.  Deep fried food doesn't taste good next day but this one didn't have that stale taste to it.  We started with fried yuca as appetizer and it tasted like french fries. Dipping sauce went well with fried yuca. It reminded of Peruvian food I had before.

For lunch, I had Bobo De Camarao - shrimp dish.  Shrimp was in a puree of yuca and coconut milk, and I tasted the hint of coconut milk and I thought I could just eat this sauce with rice only.

For desert, I shared the Brazilian Flan. The texture was between Mexican flan and New York Cheese cake, was a little harder than I anticipated but really enjoyed the flan with caramel sauce.

Service was slow for lunch but most people there didn't seem to be in a hurry. We just enjoyed conversation and nice leisurely afternoon. 

This was my first time to eat non-steakhouse Brazilian food. Other food they have on the menu looks very inviting. I would like to try more of what they have on the menu."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the food here! I had never tried Brazilian food before I tried Carvalho's...and boy am I glad I did! I'm a vegetarian, and both the server and the owner took the time to tell me what their favorite vegetarian dishes were. I have not received this kind of service at any restaurant in a very long time! I also love that this is a family owned restaurant, and I could tell from the second I walked in the door. Everyone is smiling and the service is fantastic. Keep it up you guys!!"}
{"text":"Great food & drinks. Family owned with friendly service. Have tried several things on the menu and am yet to be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great experience and good food. Don't be afraid to try something new. Brazilian and Portuguese food is not well known but you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Went here with a Groupon and got a steak and fejuada.  Food was bombtastic and service was awesome. Will definitely try to go here again."}
{"text":"Found this place because of a Groupon. So glad we did. Great food, very good service. Great ambiance. Everyone who worked there always checked on us to make sure everything was ok. Try the Brazilian beer, really good. We will go back soon. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Really good brazillian restaurant. Get couple caipirinhas, pastel de queijo, caldo verde, feijoada, pudim and Im sure you will be happy!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were here for dinner on a Saturday night.  The restaurant seems sparse for some reason and the tables are rather large. We felt so far from one another at a table for two. It's perfect when ordering a bunch of food when it comes out all at once but if you're not doing that, the table was quite large for two. We felt like we needed to lean in to talk. My husband ordered the Mango naturally sweetened tea which was delicious and I order hot green tea.  For appetizers, we ordered the marinated grilled shrimp skewers (Espetinho de Camarao) and the salted cod & potato croquettes (Bolinho de Bacalhau). To our disappointment, they were out of the croquettes. The shrimp skewers were very good. For dinner I got the Halibut Na Crosta Da Castanha which came with mashed potatoes and two asparagus. Yes, just two (2) asparagus. The fish was delicious and the potatoes were very homemade which I like.  My husband got the Bobo de Camarao which was shrimp with rice in a garlic coconut milk sauce. His was also delicious and I would recommend.  I feel as though my Halibut was overpriced at $29. Shrimp dinner was $20 and seemed a better deal for the food received.  Overall, for us, we felt like it was a delicious home cooked meal that made us feel warm...perfect for a cold evening in Scottsdale. We will be back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"My husband and I went there a couple of months ago now for our wedding anniversary. I found this place through Groupon and thought it would be a great way to check it out. 

The server (Juliana?) was amazing. She recommended drinks and answered any questions we had. She was very friendly and attentive. 

The food was amazing. It was flavorful and we enjoyed it very much. 

The only downside is the location. It's quite a drive for us otherwise we would be going there more often!

Definitely worth checking it out though."}
{"text":"Amazing Brazilian food. Staff is very attentive. My husband ordered the halibut - totally delish. I ordered the squash with shrimp - hearty yet light, with a cream sauce. Yummy!
Go during happy hour and try to order all the apps!"}
{"text":"Really great authentic Brazilian food. As a Brazilian I believe that I had a wonderful experience and enjoy every bite. The cassava fries and pao de queijo were just perfect, made to order, fresh, delicious. The fries were light and fluffy. The pao de queijo made me remember good childhood memories! 

I had also the chance to meet Phil (owner) and learn more about his history and links with Brazil.

The menu also gives you a good opportunity to try different things other than the \"Brazilian steakhouse\" restaurant you probably already know. There is a wide range of options from different regions and cuisines from Brazil.

If you want to try something different with a real Brazilian experience for a fine dining, you should try Carvalho's."}
{"text":"I discovered Carvalho's on Yelp and decided to give it a try.  I have never left a review in my life, but I loved this place so much I wanted to share it with others.I called to make an early reservation and it only took 10 minutes from shea/101 to get there.  The wait staff was friendly and knowledgeable.  The owner walked around and greeted the guests as the live music played in the background.  The food was fresh, hot and delicious.  The waiter suggested we have our two meals served family style so we could sample each meal and it worked very well.  The desserts are out of this world!  I will be back for Happy Hour so I can sample more of their menu.  You will not be dissappointed."}
{"text":"Absolutely AMAZING hidden 'GEM' of a restaurant! I chose Carvahlo's because my 'date' speaks fluent Portuguese and ALL of the reviews I read were outstanding! I thought it would be fun to try traditional Brazilian food and I was absolutely blown-away by the entire meal! 

From the Caipirinha's that were refreshing and tart with JUST the 'right' amount of sugar, to the Grilled Shrimp appetizer and the entrees Brazil Nut Crusted Halibut and the Grilled Picanha. The FLAVORS were spectacular and everything was perfectly prepared, cooked, plated. We ate EVERY bite!

Not only was the food a delight, so was the service and atmosphere. Our waitress was friendly and attentive but also very patient as she could sense that we were enjoying each other's company and not in any rush. The Owner, Phil, was a gracious Host and stopped by EVERY table, including ours to engage in friendly conversation and to share some personal stories about growing up in Brazil with his parents who were Missionaries. He really made us feel like welcomed and valued patrons.

I have been to MANY restaurants in and around the Scottsdale area and I have YET to find one that is better than Carvahlo's Brazilian Kitchen. Highly recommend it for a wonderful, upscale casual evening with friends and family..or a delightful date;-)"}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful dinner last night !! Phil the owner came over & introduced himself. Clearly , we had no idea what to order since we are not familiar w Brazilian food. So we let Phil order for us. He made sure to ask our likes & dislikes !! It turned out to be one of most delightful eating experiences. We had a couple of appetizers ( which we ordered on our own & clearly did not need because dinner was so filling ) Our entrees were a fabulous seafood stew & a steak w/ grilled pineapple & potato salad. Phil sent it over family style !! I thought we would be taking most of it home but hubby ate every drop !! Aaron our waiter was great . We can't wait to return. Don't miss this fabulous restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Amazing- we love everything we've tried. The seafood stew is bomb. Everything here is made from scratch. 

The cheese bread & casava (yuca) fries are fav starters, but be careful to leave room for the meal. 

I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"My fiance is from Brazil and when he is in the mood for Brazilian food we usually go to Fogo de chao. When we found out about this place we immediately wanted to try it and we will def be going back again. We went Saturday night when there is live music and the singer, Cleo, was amazing! The food was fabulous and the staff was very sweet and attentive. My fiance loved the food as well and said when his mom comes to visit from Rio we are def going to be taking her there. I had the Bobo and I give it 10 stars. My fiancé had the steak and even though it was cooked a little too rare, it was not an issue. The cook came out and said he'd take care of it right away. We absolutely loved this place and will be going back again. Thank you so much for the wonderful evening. :-)"}
{"text":"We were very impressed with the quality of food. The yucca fries are addicting !! Everyone was very nice and the service was great. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Delicious food, great atmosphere, & exceptional customer service! Definitely a hidden gem in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"A fantastic find. One of the best meals ever. There are ample gluten free options. Family owned with real Brazilian connections. The staff is super informative as well as friendly. This place rates 6 stars!"}
{"text":"Awesome place!

Had mango iced tea which was super refreshing and fettuccine Na Primavera with chicken which was super awesome"}
{"text":"The food was great and the service was fantastic!! You have to try the Pão de Queijo (Brazilian cheese bread), it was incredible, and gluten free! I will definitely be going back!!!"}
{"text":"I'm struggling to find a high enough compliment for this family run establishment...  \"Amazing\" will have to do for now!

The entire staff was attentive within seconds of walking in the door. I was immediately made to feel comfortable and at home. All of the food was explained to me and expertly prepared!

I highly recommend the fish croquettes and seafood stew! Of course the Caipirinhas are not to be missed!!! 

Do not miss out on the opportunity to hear the owner's stories regarding the Brazilian artifacts - you will think you've walked into the set of an Indiana Jones movie.

Awesome!"}
{"text":"Brought back so many memories of the great taste of Brazilian cuisine. Their feijoada was amazing, and you have to try the pão de quiejo. I went all the way from Tucson and it was truly worth it. If you want authentic and traditional Brazilian food Carvalho's is the place to go."}
{"text":"I am currently floating away on my food coma!  The staff was attentive.  The owner came by twice to make sure we were well taken care of... The Seafood stew features PERFECTLY cooked shrimp and fish in a rich flavorful sauce that will make your palate sing.  The black bean stew (first entree presented) was hearty and with extremely tender meat & great flavor.  The flan was a great finish to our meal.  Even the coffee was good!  No complaints.  PERFECT meal..."}
{"text":"I never understood why this restaurant wasn't packed, our first visit was a 5 star without a doubt and so good we had to come back and bring the in-laws for a special dinner. 

Unfortunately the second visit failed to wow, there were so many blunders that unfortunately left us disappointed from most recent visit. 

Being that it was winter, we opted for indoor seating because it was pretty chilly out, the inside of the restaurant wasn't much better. The lights were dimmed probably a little too far, our in-laws had to use their phones to read the menu. It wasn't until 10 minutes later when we had already figured out what we wanted to order, that our server came by and asked if he could adjust the lighting (by then it was too late). 

My husband and I were going to order tea, but we like gourmet tea and for $6 a cup that would be my expectation at this sort of restaurant. Unfortunately, when we asked about tea, we were presented with a box with the most generic teas that run about 10 cents a bag. Unfortunately hot water doesn't really justify the remaining $5.90 price tag so we stuck with cold water in the cold restaurant. 

I wasn't feeling like anything too heavy, so I opted with the vegetable sandwich, my husband went with the chicken one. My husband also ordered a cup of soup, and for a small bean soup it came to $8. It was good, but again I can't really justify a $8 price tag. 

Our sandwiches were pretty bland and the vegetable one tried to compensate for that with excessive balsamic vinegar.. it was OK but I would not recommend it or order it again. The side of yuca fries was the best part of the entire visit, but not nearly impressive enough to warrant a return visit.

Our server appeared to be very new and nervous, excessively so and it was rather frustrating. The manager (the owner's son) and the owner stopped by chatting for about 10 minutes at a time, which was nice having them stop by, but again a little excessive. I almost feel they stopped by to distract from the fact the food was so slow..

It took about 30 minutes after ordering to receive the first amount of food (besides the complimentary plantain.. which were good but not as good as the previous visit because they were cold and didn't taste fresh). There honestly was no reason for the service to be so slow as there were at least 6 employees and only 3 tables of customers! 

No one ever came for our drink order or to follow up on the tea.. we were going to do dessert, but decided to skip it after how long it took to get our entrees and everything. 

My husband had asked for his sandwich to be wrapped up to go about 10 minutes before we asked for the bill.. The bill came and it wasn't until we were nearly home we realized our server never came back with the leftovers.. I've honestly never experienced that before.

All and all, this was a hugely disappointing visit. I would say consistency is their problem and quite frankly we will be looking for a new spot after this visit."}
{"text":"Great restaurant!  My fiancée and I were visiting for the week. We stumbled on this restaurant.  The service was exceptional.  The food was homemade and authentic.  The cheese bread is a must! The calde verde soup was delicious. I would highly recommend this place!  The price was also very reasonable."}
{"text":"Love it, love it, love it. We had dinner here tonight and the food, atmosphere and ambiance were all on. The owner greets everyone, and makes us feel like a welcome guest. He lived and worked in Brazil for many years, and according to my Brazilian friends, serves up an authentic rendition of classic dishes.  We had salt cod appetizer, acorn seafood dish, and seafood stew with rice.  Really excellent.  Food is proportioned, displayed and served perfectly.  Live music some nights.  I would definitely return when in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Amazing halibut. All food is organic, all meat is grass fed and Arizona grown produce. Service is wonderful. You can sense the passion in all done here. Brazilian live music es magnifique."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. We had the Feijouda and the shrimp stuffed acorn squash (can't remember name). Both excellent. If you are a stout drinker the Belo Petroleum was a great Brazilian beer that you likely will not find elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great food. Nice atmosphere. The espresso was so expensive I would have been mad at myself if I ordered it and the truffle desert is so small and unimpressive that it should just be a free give away. That being said, great expirience. Will be back."}
{"text":"Gorgeous restaurant indoors and outdoors on the dog friendly patio!  Wonderful Brazilian food from the crispy seasoned plantain chips to the Fejoada and Brazil nut encrusted halibut!  Great service too!  We are coming back!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our experience. Britney our server was knowledgeable  and very friendly. Not sure if it was the owner or manager that stopped by our table to ask if we were enjoying our meal. Everything we had was delicious. The prices are reasonable too. We will be back."}
{"text":"Great authentic Brazilian food!  Feijoada was MUITO BEM!  I enjoyed the outdoor seating.  Cool atmosphere and I enjoyed getting to know other Brazilians at the restaurant.  Obrigado!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food and several good choices for non-meat eaters. The kale caesar salad was very good as was the Prato Feito (without meat). I love black beans and these delivered. My husband loved his salmon and black bean stew. We will go back again when we have more time to linger over music and desert."}
{"text":"Very good date night with the hubs. The owner was very friendly, the weighter had great recommendations for food and drink. I had the fish stew which was good, hubs had the picanha which was awesome. We also had the cheese bread which was excellent."}
{"text":"Knockout feijoada, and I have eaten feijoada at Brazilian friends' homes and at Brazilian restaurants in many major cities including New York and San Francisco.  The Brazilian flan is also the densest flan I have ever had, which is how I rate a good flan. Quiet, romantic ambience, inexpensive.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I'm going to have to to come back again and order off of their dinner menu. We came on a whim and realized we only had an hour to eat since we were going to watch a movie right after so we ordered off of the happy hour menu. 

Our order:
 -Beef pasteis: one of my fave items that we ordered. They are practically beef empanadas and it packed lots of flavor. 
-Bolinho de Bacalhau: unfortunately, I was not a fan. They reminded me of fish sticks that you buy at the grocery store
-Sopa de Feijao: this is a black bean soup and I really enjoyed it. It came with pieces of bread and it was a good portion. I couldn't eat it all but it was good.
-Sanduiche de Carne: the steak was bland and all that came with the steak and bread was a few pieces of tomato and lettuce and fries. I would not order this again. 

Hubby ordered a red sangria and during happy hour, it was only $4. He really liked it too. I did scan the dinner menu and there are a few items I would like to come back to try. So until then, I will update my review. Hopefully, I'll be more of a fan like the rest."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing in all possible ways - service, food, ambience and owners making their rounds to make sure your experience is top notch.  I had the black bean stew that was so tasty.   The portion was large enough to share unless you want to go home STUFFED to the gills!  The artwork is beautiful and I honestly do not have the words to tout this place to the nines!   We will be back!"}
{"text":"This review is quite simple.  You can always get a seat here...because there simply are near-zero regulars.  The menu is complex and the food is overtly bland.  The concept needs to be completely reimagined.  I'd love to give this place a fourth look but can never bring myself to go back in when the restaurant is consistently empty."}
{"text":"Brazilian cuisine in AZ? Yes indeed! We dined with some friends and we were all impressed... Aaron was super friendly and made us some spicy Caipirinhas to start with. The Brazilian beer Palma Local (sp?) was crisp and refreshing. Our server was also attentive and made excellent recommendations from the menu. 
We ordered:
The Brazilian nut crusted halibut with pesto sauce 5*s
Seafood Stew 5*s
Filet in burgundy mushroom sauce 5*s
Sirloin with pineapple and potato salad 5*s
The beef empanadas and cheese empanadas were a shareable start accompanied by a red hot, really hot, sauce so addictive. 
On Sundays and Wednesdays they serve $5 Caipirinhas all day we will have to come back."}
{"text":"I first heard of Carvalho's through a Facebook friend. I was intrigued. Intrigued because it's an ethnic food I had never thought of trying. I checked it out on Yelp, like I do and it was already well-reviewed and well-loved. This only gravitated me towards Carvalho's even more. This all happened...hmmmm...maybe two or three weeks ago. Now, I finally gave it a try and was no where near disappointed. The experience and the food lived up to my expectations. 

It was a late Sunday afternoon (today). Not a lot of clientele around, as I would expect at around 3:30 in the afternoon. I would say I came at a great time. No wait and I was provided immediate attention. We were asked if we had visited before; of course, I answered no. We were provided plenty of time to stare at the menu. The dishes; especially, the names (in Portuguese) were all new to me. Not to worry, there was English translation. I decided on two items: the Bobo de Caramao (shrimp bobo) and the Pao de Queijo (Brazilian Cheese Bread) as an appetizer. My companion selected the Moqueca de Peixe (seafood stew). I would say waited less than 10 minutes for our main dishes to come out. They looked amaaaazzzzing. I didn't try the Moqueca de Peixe, but it looked so good. I would see it's appearance was prettier than my dish, but my dish tasted incredible. It was creamy and had a mild flavor. My appetizer, the Brazilian Cheese Bread, came out a little later, but that's okay. It was a great complement to the abundance of creamy bobo I had left over. 

The staff was very friendly and attentive. The food was delish both in taste and aesthetically. I can't wait to come back to try the other dishes."}
{"text":"We love this restaurant and the family that runs it. The picanha and moqueca are my favorites. Get in when they have live music! My wife and kids love this place. Perfect for when you want Brazilian prato feito or a nice meal alone or with friends."}
{"text":"This is truly an authentic Brazilian restaurant.  Everything made from scratch.  The steak was seasoned well & grilled perfectly.  Dessert tropical fruit mousse was nice & lite perfect for summer. The restaurant space is well decorated with perfect lighting.  Service was on point..from owners & manger checking on our dinning experience."}
{"text":"Great way to learn about the rich Brazilian culture! Their food is authentic and very good. Favors are complex yet simply delicious. Flan is to die!!"}
{"text":"We were in town recently and decided to give this place to try. Service and food were both outstanding. 
I wish I were better at remembering to rate restaurants."}
{"text":"Horrible food. Unispired, zero creativity or culinary enthusiasm. There's really nothing authentic that screams Brazilian. Food was tasteless and bland. 
Worst birthday dinner ever"}
{"text":"This place is great! Best Brazilian restaurant in Arizona hands down, it's very authentic and amazing food."}
{"text":"What a wonderfull place to celebrate fathers day!! Caipirinha was very tasty, the shrimp bobo excelent and the BIFE A CAVALO perfectly cook. The bossanova sound adds to the ambience.  We will be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I have eaten at this restaurant a few times and have not been disappointed.  The food is delicious and the environment is cozy.  If you want to try something uniquely Brazilian, my suggestion is to try the coxinha as an appetizer, guarana (Brazilian soda), Feijoada (beef stew), and Pudim de Leite (Brazilian flan).  The service was also great! We will definitely come back again! :)"}
{"text":"Great restaurant. Friendly staff. Easy to get in during the week. Delicious seafood stew and steak. I could eat a boat of plantain chips. Neat story behind the family running the place."}
{"text":"A wonderful family-owned restaurant with family recipes.  My husband and I came here for our weekly date night and were not disappointed.  This was definitely a restaurant with authentically Brazilian cuisine, so don't think Fogo de Chao when coming here.  Service was all in all friendly and attentive.  We started with the pao de queijo- can't go wrong with Brazilian cheese bread.  My husband had the feijoada which was a type of stew with lots of different toppings.  I had the bobó de camarão- a sort of shrimp chowder.  Tasted kind of like a curry, very delicious!  And we shared a musse de maracuja- passion fruit mousse.  Out of this world!   I do have a bit of a sweet tooth though.  So if you're up for a culinary adventure, make sure to check out this place."}
{"text":"We have been wanting to try this place for a long time and are happy we were finally able to go. It does get pretty busy so I would highly recommend reservations. The service was phenomenal. We we're greeted by the owner and he spent time explaining the menu to us and helped us make our chojces. The food was amazing. There were 4 of us and we all enjoyed our meals. Highly recommend trying it out."}
{"text":"Hate to select a star rating since we didn't get to eat there but I can't warn others without it. Made a trip from Tucson with a friend who loves (loved) this place. Arrived to a completely dark empty restaurant. No tables, no chairs, no decorations. No explanation note on the window, just an empty space"}
{"text":"Delish drink & food with an old friend/co-worker and their husband. The restaurant is a very nicely set up, yet simple. I believe it's a family run business, three brothers care for the front of the house and I believe the father cares for the general management of it. The entire wait staff (the brothers) provided an excellent dining experience. We started off with complimentary plantain chips that were not overly sweet, which was delish and a cocktail, which is a traditional drink, Caipirinha (Brazilian Margarita) and appetizers Pao de Queijo (Cheese Bread) & Coxinha de Frango (Chicken Fritters w/a spicy sauce). For dinner, two of had the Feijoada (Black Bean Stew that had 3 smoked meats- I believe, Short Rib, Pork Rib & Sausage and you topped it with sides of Collard greens, farofa (crispy bread crumb)) and Felipe tried the Prato Feito (Deep Fried Pork Rib dinner). Our dish was very well seasoned and cooked to perfection. And finished off with dessert, Brigadeiros (chocolate truffle). Felipe is from Brazil and said that it was all very traditional and good, even down to the way dessert was presented. It's definitely worth the drive to North Scottsdale/Pinnacle Peak Rd"}
{"text":"If you are looking for impeccable service, the proprietor visiting your table, live music, two outdoor patios and attention to detail... this is the place in north Scottsdale. I'm not from Brazil and have never been. If the food here is any indication, guess we need to schedule a trip. I had the waiters choice; rice, fish and shrimp (Moqueca de apiece). My wife enjoyed the steak (Picanha grelhada). Did I mention great service! The 5 stars are for getting dinner right. This is not to fancy of a place that you need a jacket and tie. If this was in a 5 star resort, add a reality TV star the lines would around the corner. Whew, I'm glad we even got in tonight without a reservation. A wonderful spot! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"** Crucial Disclosure: Don't eat here if you're wanting the men with large sticks of meat! Giggidy giggidy 

I wanted to treat my dad for Father's Day to this concept, but Fogo de Chao was booked solid yesterday. Boooo. Okay, I find an alternate and find Carvalho's and they have availability! Hot dog!

I RSVP and we drive our merry selves to the restaurant. I walk in and the venue is pretty quiet and smaller than I would imagine. And, no gauchos weaving through the dining area! What?! I panic and ask our Server where these meat-pushers were in a high-pitched frenzy.

She politely answered that this restaurant is a Brazilian Kitchen, and they do offer similar cuisine, but don't have the same concept as others do. I nod nicely but pout/sulk after she leaves. I feel like crying a little.

After some internal dialogue and to not spoil my dad's special day, I pull myself together and make the best of it. I'm sure it's good, right?

I quickly learned it was even better than \"good\"; it was fantastic! Comp plaintain chips were presented quickly and a genuine smile started appearing on my face. Dad and I ordered the same - Picanha Grelhado (grilled steak). 

It was SO nicely done and had a superb flavor of spices and was grilled to perfection (but still rare, like I like it!). Was served w/Brazilian potato salad and grilled pineapple ring. Plus, 2 hearts of palm (OMG, num!).

I did have to doggy-bag the food I couldn't finish - it hit the spot later that evening. 

Great decor and friendly service. I'll return back in the future."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely fantastic! Outstanding entrees, deserts at very affordable prices. Great atmosphere and excellent service."}
{"text":"My daughter, who is Brazilian, LOVES this restaurant. The Brazilian dishes are authentic and delicious. The owners and the staff never fail to provide excellent service. For a special treat, order the Brazilian cheese bread."}
{"text":"Our first time here. We will definitely be back. Sat outside next to a little stream. Beautiful restaurant. Wonderful service. Delicious food. Many gluten free options!!! Loved the plantain chips. I had the salmon with passion fruit sauce which was very good. My hubby had a steak with grilled pineapple  (I can't remember the actually name of it). It was amazing."}
{"text":"Most amazing food and service. Wanted to try something new and different. What a very pleasant surprise.  The menu is full of great choices.  We had the black bean soup and Kale Caesar salad,  entrees had the fettuccini primavera and Brazilian steak.  Finished with house-made flan and Brazilian coffee.  Service from Livens was so sincere and most attentive ever.  Thank you for great food and  great service outside on your patio. Perfect Nite"}
{"text":"I'm not one to usually leave reviews, but after my experience at Carvalho's I knew I had too. I will start off by saying that i come from a Brazilian family, with a mother who is amazing in the kitchen, so I came in with some high expectations for what authentic Brazilian cuisine tastes like. I was also not looking for a \"churrascaria\" experience which can be overwhelming at times. I decided to stop by for lunch on a Sunday and expected it to be a bit slower and quite and that's exactly what I walked into. I was promptly greeted by one of the two servers who were working and decided to take a seat at the bar as I was eating alone. From the get go service was awesome and I was quickly handed a menu, water, and asked if I needed any explanation. Since I was quite familiar with most menu items I got to ordering right away. The \"pasteis\" appetizer were perfect. I ordered the cheese stuffed one and the kitchen accidentally made me the meat version instead...no big deal, they let me eat the meat as well as the cheese order! I then went straight for what I had come in for...\"feijoada\" The portion size was perfect and the taste phenomenal. I can honestly say that it rivals any meal that you could eat in Brazil. Service was on point, and the owners wife even came out to speak some portuguese with me. Live Brazilian music on Saturday nights, quality service, and amazing authentic food. Can't really ask for too much more. I can't wait to get back there to try the rest of the menu. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Really good Brazilian food in a cozy and romantic atmosphere with great service. What's not to love? 
We ordered these dishes to try:
Pão de Queijo - cheese bread! these were bigger than the ones I had in Brazil but the flavours brought me back to my trip. It's such a treat to find them here. Their version is pretty good. 
Feijoada - black bean strew with meat and rice! This one is a classic and their version is so tasty. It is heavy though.. I was only able to finish half of it as it's very filling
Picana Grelhada - steak served with Brazilian potato salad. Both the salad and the streak was so delicious!!!  I highly recommend this dish. 
They also serve complimentary plantain chips and those were so good as well.Seriously if you're in the area and want to try something different, check this place out!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent place, nice music, don't you miss the Muqueca de Peixe, just awesome.  And Caipirinha like home made."}
{"text":"My mother in law asked me if I had ever eaten Brazilian seafood stew and I said, no I've never heard of it!  So on a whim I searched for places in the Phoenix area that serve up this delectable treat...and to my surprise Carvalhos popped up as the only place in the metro.  I had to check it out.
It did not disappoint.  The location is great and the ambiance at this beautiful restaurant is fun.  We dined on the awesome back patio, right next to the stream and the hammock.....which both the waiter and the owner encouraged my young children to lay in and relax.  They happily obliged.
From the moment we walked in the customer service was top notch.  Our server was extremely knowledgeable in helping us navigate the menu.
The owner came over to meet us and took my children on a tour of the restaurant and all the artifacts they have on display.  My 7 year old son was enthralled.  He left saying this was his favorite restaurant.
Not to mention the food is extremely tasty.  From the plantain chips and cheese bread to the seafood stew (perfection) and the steaks-food is on point.  
This could easily be a fantastic date spot, nice romantic atmosphere.  But if your children are well behaved, it's a great family spot as well.
We cannot wait to return and bring our out of town guests for a taste of the Brazil in Arizona."}
{"text":"I wanted to give this place another star but the service was so bad the food couldn't make up for it. It is restaurant week so we got items from the fixed menu. The mojito like drink that came with was delicious along with each dish as well. Unfortunately our meal took nearly 3 hours and we had them box our desserts.  We did learn that 1 server had cut themselves severely and needed medical attention and then 2 more servers quit mid service along with a cook who left early. Being a former member of the service industry I had empathy for the situation. However, better communication with the customers would have gotten them a lot farther with my patience. Hopefully this place sticks around because the food was good but they need some help in the service and management department."}
{"text":"Great food.  Nice atmosphere. Reasonable prices.  I sat on the patio and enjoyed a great local beer, while waiting for my dinner. The seafood Stew with rice was perfect and the service was fast and attentive."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved everything! Me, my uncle and aunt went for lunch, around 1 PM. They weren't busy. The service at first was a little slow, but after we ordered everything came really fast. The owners go to every table and talk to you, very nice. 

I'm Brazilian, so I know what the food should taste like, and it is spot on. We had the feijoada for two, that can easily feed three people. For appetizers, coxinha and pastel de queijo, both amazing. My aunt had the bobó de camarão, and she said it was also very good. Too bad they didn't have bolinho de bacalhau, I was craving for that! 

Oh, caipirinha is a must have also."}
{"text":"What a great dining experience.  Food was awesome, and reasonably priced. Our party of four each ordered different plates off the menu, and we were amazed at the food quality, and the service.  The staff was super friendly and the owner gave us some history behind him and his restaurant.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I concurr with the other positive reviews of this place.  I have been there twice for dinner.  The first time i went primarily to see the Peter Skid art work that the place features.  The restaurant  is located in a small shopping area down from Ace Hardware, but still manages to have a romantic ambiance.  You can get to the terrace by crossing a little stone bridge, and the terrace has soft lighting at night.  On both of my visits, the food and service was outstanding.  On my first visit,I had the CAMARAO NA MORANGA.  I have now tried to make it at home a couple of times.  The second visit, I decided to scale back on the fat grams a little and had the halibut encrusted in nuts.  Also excelent.  We had the Mandioca Frita for an appetizer.  The owner visited the table and was happy to answer questions about the food.  If I could give this place 10 stars, I would.  Will I be back?  Just try to keep me away."}
{"text":"My wife and dined here while on vacation! We were very impressed with the authenticity of the plates as well as the quality! Karina, our server and made our visit a pleasant one!"}
{"text":"I have been wishing for a Brazilian restaurant to open in the valley that is not a rodizio steakhouse for about 20 years and my wishes have finally come true! We started with coxinha de galinha, which was seasoned perfectly, but it could have cooked a little longer as the inside was not heated all the way through. We could have also done without the side of mayo and ketchup; a side of Brazilian hot sauce or molho de pimenta would have been much better. For the entrees I had the Bobo de Camarao and my husband had the Prato Feito with the deep fried pork ribs.  The shrimp in my dish was cooked to perfection and the sauce/puree was so good, you could eat it with just rice and be happy. I ordered this dish because I've made it at home before and it takes some serious effort. My husband truly enjoyed his dish and contrary to the coxinha, it came out piping hot and every time he would separate the ribs, steam would come out of it. For dessert we settled for the brigadeiros and a cup of Brazilian coffee.  The brigadeiros did not taste fresh and that is the only thing I would not order again but that's okay, because they have four other desserts I need to try. Our server was very attentive and because it was valentine's day, I was presented with a rose at the end of the meal. I thought that was such a sweet and totally unexpected gesture. They had a drink menu that I cannot find online with four or five Brazilian beers I have never heard of and some traditional cocktails as well. I can't wait to go back and try the beer, the moqueca de peixe, and their mouse de cupuacu."}
{"text":"I was excited to eat at Carvalho's after seeing all the good reviews and looking at the menu. Since it was restaurant week we decided to give this place a try. It's been a few years since I had Brazilian food so I was looking forward to a food reunion!

The restaurant itself has a lovely serene patio that is dog friendly with an equally pleasing interior. On weekends they play live music and they have a happy hour from 3-6 (Currently Tuesday-Saturday, Monday-Saturday after June 13) that includes discounted drinks, appetizers, and sandwiches. We got here at 5:30 just in time to get a discounted caipirinha ($7) and bolinho de bacalhau ($5). The caipirinha was excellent, with bold lime flavors, strong but smooth cachaca liquor, and the perfect amount of sweet and tart flavor. I had never had cachaca 61, but it is a lot better and smoother tasting than cachaca 51 which is more readily available in the U.S.

In addition to the bolinho de bacalhau (Salt cod fritters), our party ordered other appetizers as well to share as they ordered from the restaurant week menu ($33 for four courses). They included mandioca frita (Fried yucca), pasteis (Savory turnovers), and pao de queijo (Cheese bread). My favorites were the pasteis and the bacalhau. The pasteis was very similar to an empanada, with a perfect crisp flaky crust and well seasoned beef. The bacalhau was a great mix of lightly crisp breading with salt cod and potato.

For entrees, we ordered the feijoada for two ($21), and tried a few dishes others ordered from the restaurant week menu. I loved the feijoada, it is probably my favorite dish out of all the ones I tried. It was a simple black bean stew, but it packed a lot of depth and nuanced flavor from the combination of beans, seasonings, pork and beef. It was served with a diverse spread of chopped marinated peppers, farofa grain, orange slices, shredded (Collard?) greens, and white rice. The combination of all the flavors together was truly wonderful. 

Service was superb. Our server was friendly and humorous. A manager (Or the owner?) stopped by to chat which we appreciated.

I would love to come here again for the delightful food and atmosphere. Thanks for a great night Carvalho's!

Edited 5-31-16 to include the corrected happy hour times. Their website states 2-6 P.M., perhaps it's time for an update!"}
{"text":"I was brought to Carvalho's for my birthday. The first thing to know is this is not a Brazilian steakhouse, they do not come to the table to cut beef. We ordered the bread cheese as an appetizer and I was worried because it was underwhelming. The cheese was mellow and the bread a bit bland, so I was expecting the rest of the meal to be the same.

Man was I wrong. The main dishes came out and they were overloaded with flavor. I ordered the PEIXE GRELHADA NO MOLHO DA CAIPIRINHA and the flavors popped. Perfectly cooked. Amazing, I tried a few dishes that ranged the menu and was overwhelmed.

I cook nightly for my family and have one rule. As an amateur cook if the food is worse than mine I never return, if it's better I will keep it on my list forever. It would take me awhile to figure out how they created their dishes, it's a keeper.

Outside of food the owner stopped by and was completely charismatic. I'll skip the details but I left thinking this man that grew up in the the Amazon and piloted a helicopter in South America was a bit of a James Bond, and I'd love to hear more of his stories.  Maybe next time!"}
{"text":"5 of us went tonight. Great service, delicious fresh food; we think the owner came to check on us (he didn't introduce himself but that would've been nice).  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"How could anyone write a bad review on this place!! I just finished licking my plate. My husband ordered the tradition Brazilian steak plate, and his first words were \"wow!\" With a mouth full. I ordered the Capirinha to drink (the waiter recommended it) and I was blown away. I had 2 of them before my meal even arrived, ops ;). I ordered the black bean stew item and holy moly I'm so full but I want to keep eating! We are waiting on the Brazilian flan to arrive, I'm sure it will taste nothing less than exceptional. 
I told my husband we will be back, I want to try everything on this menu."}
{"text":"The absolute best food in N PHX & Scottsdale; the service and unique tasting food is as good as it gets!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the ambiance on the patio and recommendations from the cultured servers. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Our party of 5 met early so as to avoid the dinner crowd. The atmosphere was enjoyable and relaxing. Too many places today play loud a noxious music - not here.  We were able to have good dinner conversation while enjoying delicious appetizers, (roasted vegetables) salad, main course and the (chocolate cake with coconut filling) desert.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Having been to Brazil on two occasions, this place is the real deal. The food was delicious.  I had the fried pork ribs with rice and black beans. Really tasty. The rice was spot on and the beans were fresh; not canned. Phil, the owner, stopped by our table twice. Very nice man. My friend and I were hesitant about dessert because we were full. So Phil comped us each a dessert. I asked for the flan, brought it home and had a bite. I loved it!  Will have it for breakfast tomorrow. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is terrific! An upscale yet casual dining experience for the whole family. I've lived in Brazil, and I can say this food is authentic. It's also delicious! I had the picanha grelhada (with rice instead of mashed potatoes--true Brazilian style) cooked medium rare, and it was incredible. You'd be hard pressed to find a better steak. My wife had the salmon (not a cultural dish, but it had a passion fruit sauce that gave it a Brazilian flare). She raved about it. We doubled up on desserts--bolo prestígio for her, musse de maracujá for me. Both consumed rapidly! The staff was so kind and helpful, including the owners who will visit with you and make you feel at home. Our six week old daughter was with us, and she was the star of the show for the whole staff! Haha. We love this place."}
{"text":"What?! Veggie dishes on a Brazilian menu? I'm there!

Yum yum yum. Carvalho's is open for lunch and dinner and the professionalism was A+. The food was A+. The atmosphere was A+. So the average of those three grades would be -- ummmm...

I dunno. I'm not good at alphabet math. But I am good at eating. This was my order:

APPETIZER
Mandioca Frita: Fried Cassava with Parmesan shavings and dipping sauce - $5.00
Fries were thick and good, but the sauce was bland so I suggest asking for a substitute of something more spicy

SALAD
Salada de Vegetais Grelhadas: Grilled Vegetable Salad with a balsamic dijon dressing - $9.00
This was good. I think the ingredients were eggplant, bell pepper, zucchini, mushrooms, and onions over mixed greens that were so fresh, they didn't wilt under the warm vegetables.

ENTREE
Moqueca de Palmito: Heart of Palm Stew - $20.00
In a creamy coconut milk and palm oil sauce, they give heart of palm slices, tomatoes, bell peppers, onions, garlic and a cup of white rice. I rarely eat white rice, but this tasted so good with rice. I hated to share it.

DESSERT
Musse de Cupuaçu: Cupuaçu Fruit Mousse - $7.00
Whoa! How do I describe it? 
It came in a martini glass. The mousse itself was thick and eggshell coloured with spice dusted on top. It was fruity, citrus-y, vanilla-y. You'll just have to order it for yourself. 

If you prefer chocolate sweets, there are a few rich items to choose from including truffles, cake, and ice cream. They also serve flan.

{"text":"I like hanging out at Carvalho's because I feel very comfortable there.  Carvalho's feels a lot like the Scottsdale I remember from the Olden Days back in the 70's when everyone was from somewhere else and all just melted into this elegant, easy lifestyle while still being themselves. (Full disclosure, I only observed this upscale lifestyle from central Phx.)

The owner and staff are always welcoming and are so conscientious.  I like to just go with the experience and not push any expectations I've gotten from nice Corporate restaurants onto this place.  It's very relaxing.

The Brazilian food is very good, especially those cheesy rolls.  The caipirinhas taste just like margaritas to me and are also very good.  Oh my gosh - try the chocolate cake.  I may not know Brazilian food but I do know chocolate cake and Carvalho's is up there with the best of them."}
{"text":"This was our first time at Carvalho's, but it certainly won't be our last.  We had lunch there because we had a Groupon, and what a treat that was.  Our server, Dylan was personable, professional, and incredibly helpful.  My wife had the Bobo, which was shrimp in a delicious sauce that looked somewhat like a yellow curry.  I had the Feijoada, a black bean stew with meat the collard greens.  Both were served with perfectly cooked rice.  The Feijoada was also accompanied by a small dish of yucca powder (to sprinkle on the dish like one would parmesan in an Italian restaurant) and a Brazilian version of pico de gallo.  Yet another unexpected treat that really enhanced the \"stew.\"  The lunch portions were big enough that my wife and I both took home leftovers and had them later - and they were just as delicious as leftovers as they were at the restaurant, if not even better.  Add a glass of wine and a wonderful dark Brazilian beer and the lunch, with tax was only $56.  To us, that's a bargain considering how delicious everything was."}
{"text":"Came here with my Brazilian coworker! Amazing authentic dishes! We had restaurant week menu which was a total deal and way too much food! The appetizers a were prepared perfectly, delicious and unique! We had the fried cassava (yuca), perfectly crispy, cheese bread, fish cakes (fish croquette) perfectly fried and crispy! The green soup was to die for! I wanted to order another one to go! I had the bobo de camarao and my coworker had the feijoada and we all loved our entrees! We took the flan home coz we were way too stuffed! Awesome awesome find!"}
{"text":"This review has been in my drafts...my boyfriend and I wanted to try something new so we did, we tried it about 2 months after it opened. We enjoyed it and the atmosphere. It was my first time trying Brazilian food and it was so flavorful! The service was great and they had some beautiful music on the Friday we visited."}
{"text":"I'm not Brazillian but I felt at home at Carvalho's. Clean, friendly restaurant with quick and attentive service by Joel. Had a seat on the patio enjoying the laughing waters. I ordered pan de queso, caldo verde soup, a classic Caipirinha and, of course, picanha. My wife, the Moqueca de Peixe and fried yuca. All were cleanly presented and tasted excellent. Only downside was shooing the flies away from our delicious food. Thanks for the wonderful meal and service."}
{"text":"Five stars doesn't mean perfect, and Carvalho's is not, but it does mean that Scottsdale now has a new interesting dining experience that I can recommend to everyone.  Once.  Whether you will want to come back time after time depends on how much you like Brazilian food and whether the limited menu has enough variety for you.

The restaurant is very attractive, especially the outdoor seating towards the back (they also have a few tables in front near the parking lot), which is isolated from roadways and borders on a small pond with a fountain.  These may be some of the best tables in Scottsdale and almost worth a visit on their own in nice weather.  But there's more to like here.

The food is really Brazilian, although you will find some other Latin American influences present as well.  As far as I can tell, everything is not only fresh but freshly made, and that makes a big difference.  Plantain chips, which are served when you are seated, get stale easily, but these were fresh, and fried and salted perfectly.  Our fried yucca and coxinha de frango (chicken fritters) were also impeccably prepared, fresh, and crisp.  

The Feijoada, a traditional black bean stew with sausage and smoked meats was tasty but in this case it was the presentation that wowed - the stew was served in a bowl, the rice in another, two small cups contained a pico de gallo and toasted ground yucca, and a plate had shredded collard greens and orange slices.  Color, shape, and a dynamically fresh appearance made this dish a visual delight.  You put the ingredients together yourself in another plate.  All for $16.  Another entree, the Picanha na Grelhada, was a plain steak with a slice of grilled pineapple - well prepared but rather mundane.

We tried a dessert, Bolo Prestigio, a chocolate layer cake filled with what I believe is a reduced condensed milk-coconut pudding.  It was just too sweet after we had filled ourselves on everything else.

The service speed was fine, but our waiter was new - not just to the restaurant but to being a waiter.  Although nice, he made mistakes such as taking our forks and knives when removing the appetizers and not replacing them, then disappearing for ten minutes..  You may have to put up with that here.

I would consider Carvalho's a dining experience and not overpriced.  Our two appetizers, two entrees, one dessert, and a drink cost me $80 including tax and tip.

If you are at all adventurous in dining or want a romantic evening, you really need to try Carvalho's."}
{"text":"Loved this place. They have a very friendly staff. Went above and beyond any staff in a restaurant I have seen. The MANDIOCA FRITA - FRIED CASSAVA and PAO DE QUEIJO - CHEESE BREAD appetizers were amazing. I brought my parents and they loved it. My mom is from Rio and she was in heaven. My father loved the FEIJOADA and my mom loved MOQUECA DE PEIXE - SEAFOOD STEW. I had simple grilled chicken and that was so flavorful. Of course had to have the BRIGADEIROS for dessert. Will definitely go again. If you want real Brasilian food go here and not Fogo De Chao."}
{"text":"I first heard about this restaurant on Groupon.com, checked out reviews on Yelp and decided to give it a try.   We were very happy we did... this place has wonderful service; attentive, helpful, friendly and engaging.  The food was fantastic!  Our party consisted of 2 adults, 15 year old and 10 year old, we are all looking forward to returning!"}
{"text":"We regularly travel to Scottsdale and love outstanding food.  This restaurant did not disappoint. It was well worth driving through the construction.  We had the most delicious steaks.  We travel with our twins and they made them feel very welcome.  Everything is house made and authentic."}
{"text":"Feijoada was one of the greatest things I ever put in my mouth. Awesome flavors!"}
{"text":"We went to Carvahlo's for restaurant week, and it was well worth the drive from Tempe. This restaurant has not been open long, but the food and the experience were the best we had this week. They still have some kinks to work out in the mechanics, but the food was excellent and generous in portion, and the personal touch added by the owner made the experience complete. Stories of growing up in the Amazon with a pilot father flying in missionaries and a personal tour of the various artifacts in the restaurant added to the dining experience, making it among the best I've had. He even sent us off with a DVD of his fishing exploits after I conveyed my own upbringing in a prominent fishing community. Despite the distance, we will be returning here soon, and I hope word gets out about this exemplary establishment. They deserve your business, and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"As far as I know, this is the ONLY Brazilian restaurant in the Phoenix area that is not a rodizio-style steakhouse.  The food was excellent, as was the service.  I spoke briefly with the owner, who was also very friendly.

I just saw this place closed.  WHY?  I was dying to go back."}
{"text":"Update..

The owner of Cavalho's reached out to me to try to make it right and I can appreciate that. So I'm changing my rating because I believe great customer service can go a long ways. Maybe it was just an off night for them and we all have those from time to time. Thank you Philip for your emails, I did appreciate it."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise. The food here was amazing. We were visiting from out of town and found this place on yelp and after reading the reviews we figured it was worth a try. We could not have been more satisfied, we had a party of four, all of us tried something different, every single dish was absolutely exquisite. Would highly recommend Caravhlo's."}
{"text":"The food was excellent. The service was excellent. The only reason this place gets 4 stars instead of 5 is that the pricing is high for the type of Brazilian food .  expect to pay some dollars. Outside seating is great though."}
{"text":"This amazing restaurant in N Scottsdale is out of this world, it is authentic real Brazilian Nothing  like it, the owner Philip is amazing.The food is homemade, & the coffee is real authentic from Guatamalia
is made fresh, desserts  are awesome. Not a restaurant for Kids, this is a romantic restaurant, with music on sat. This is the best of the best, enjoy"}
{"text":"Can honestly say I would not give this restaurant five stars simply for the food.  But combine the great service we received, with the great ambiance and it deserves all five.
It was a slow night so maybe we received better service than normal but our server did an outstanding job of explaining the unique features of Brazilian cuisine.  
Right before the appetizers arrived Phil the owner came to our table to welcome us and give us some more information about himself and the restaurant.  Very interesting and informative.
All five of us had something completely different all were excellent in their own way.  Everything is made there at the restaurant including the deserts.
Please give this restaurant a chance and I think you will thoroughly enjoy the experience."}
{"text":"This is a great little restaurant! The food is excellent, really enjoyed the flavors of Brazil. The menu is not big, but there's plenty to choose from. The have a good beer and wine list. Out door patio is cozy with hammocks and a small stream. The food is great give it a try!"}
{"text":"Fantastic approach to Brazilian food! Was very happy to find Carvalho's because they have a wide variety of traditional dishes including grass fed picanha. The atmosphere is relaxed, the decor tasteful. Brazilian background music completes the ambiance. Service very attentive and enthusiastic. Watermelon caipirinha was excellent though to my taste it could have used a tiny bit more cachaca if I spell that correctly. Enjoyed my dinner on the patio. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Food was delicious! Autêntica comida Brasileira! Owners are really nice and friendly! Great staff!! One of the best caipirinhas I ever had!"}
{"text":"This food is very authentic and delicious.  We had the feijoada and it is delicious. The passion fruit mousse and chocolate cake were great. I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"From the first taste of the delicious plantain chips, I was hooked. Then there was the pour-over coffee, which was smooth, strong, and not in the least bitter. Okay, I was happy even before my excellent fish stew with its not to spicy pepper, onion, tomato, and garlic sauce arrived. For my wife a nice halibut with pesto sauce. The pleasant and accommodating staff adjusted to our needs and went out of their way to provide outstanding service. The ambiance is a bit dark, but the Brazilian artifacts are fascinating. Special mention for the soft jazz, my favorite music for dining. I will be back to try the meat and the chicken dishes."}
{"text":"We found this place randomly online and decided to try it for lunch based on the great reviews on yelp. We were not disappointed. The food is reasonably priced, especially for the great quality you get. Staff is exceptionally friendly and forthcoming. We will definately be back !"}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere and food is so flavorful, authentic, and delicious. The owner genuinely cares about the dining experience his guests have while at his restaurant. A hidden gem in Scottsdale you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Very authentic food. Great service. The owner is very nice and comes by your table to talk about the food. Appetizers are amazing we tried four. Definitely will go back again."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great music and band, fabulous food, service a bit slow at times. Carvahlo's is a gem to try in the Pinnacle Peak area. The food is super fresh and easily some of the tastiest I've ever had - the drinks aren't bad either!"}
{"text":"My wife and I enjoyed an excellent dinner here tonight. We started with marinated grilled shrimp on a skewer and fried turnovers filled with beef. They were both delicious. Our entree was a classic Brazilian Feijoada, which is a traditional black bean stew with sausage and smoked meat, served with rice and an array of garnishes. Excellent dish! Very authentic Brazilian fare right here in the valley. The staff was very friendly, and our waiter, Dylan, was amazing as well. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Good service and very good food. We started with Caldo Verde (soup), and then had beef pasteis, espetinho de camarao , and Feijoada. They were all new dishes to us, but all were great. The server did a good job showing us how to eat the feijoada (not real complicated but the instructions were helpful).  Great experience and we'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Simply amazing.  We have driven past this jewel for 2 years.  2 years of happiness averted by not coming in to sample the amazing food and homemade ambiance that has been created in North Scottsdale by the owner Phil and his family.  Phil began his life as the son of a missionary pilot in the heart of the Amazon and brought the culinary delights of South America to create his restaurant surrounded by the artifacts he gathered as a child from the indigenous people in the area and art made from some of his 300 employees who worked in his world class destination fishing resorts throughout Brazil.  This South American version of Crocodile Dundee visited our table and shared his passion for Brazil and his restaurant.  The staff is knowledgeable and accommodating.  Their recommendations were perfect and the overall experience was great.  I can't recommend this place highly enough."}
{"text":"WOW, the best Brazilian and possibly best shrimp I've ever had.

Here are about half of the items we had.

BOBO DE CAMARAO
BIFE A CAVALO - HORSEBACK RIDING STEAK 
MOQUECA DE PEIXE - SEAFOOD STEW

ESPETINHO DE CAMARÃO - SKEWERED SHRIMP

All were just simply out of this world. Especially the shrimp. Being spoiled living in Florida a good part of my life, I've become a seafood snob. The shrimp was better than any I've ever had. The steak and chicken were exceptional as well. The service was superb. The atmosphere was great. The owner was just kind and very giving. You can tell his Christian based business, is followed up by his kind actions and great heart. 

I can't remember what we had for dessert but it was great too, as well as the coffee. 

This place may be 2,000 miles from home but I felt as if I were home. We will be back again one day."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch, food was delicious but the best part was the owner that stopped by several times to ask if we needed anything. He is the most gracious host.
We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Truly authentic Brazilian food! For a real Brazilian, and real delicious, meal head over to Carvalhos. So many memories were brought back with the feijoada and the Prato feito mixed with a cold glass of Antarctica guarana. Please don't leave without having the mousse de maracuja; perhaps the best dessert ever. Just sayin'."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. The pao de queijo, feijoada and the moqueca de peixe were all incredible. Our server, Carina, was so sweet and incredibly knowledgeable and her pride in the food was definitely well placed. Fantastic experience and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Great family owned restaurant. Hospitality is through the roof. Food is very tasty. Big fan"}
{"text":"We went here today, on a Saturday. There was live music too with the amazing food. I'm a vegetarian and it's almost hard to find good options in a steakhouse like this. Since my boyfriend loves steak, we decided to try this place. Ambience is amazing, serving was amazing, everything is amazing. This is one of the places that goes under my 'must try' list. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Sadly this restaurant is no longer in business. They closed their doors. Blessings to you. Thank you for sharing your talent."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend and I decided to try this place. A very simple atmosphere  with few things to catch the eye but shows a lot of class doing it. I loved the outdoor pond at the patio was a very nice touch. We both ordered the passionade which was very delicious. Both ordered the steak and it came with the potato salad. Both were very satisfying and enjoyable. The staff were very kind and courteous. Well done Carvalho's."}
{"text":"I feel somewhat bad leaving this review as the food is good, but our waitress was pretty awful. Food was 4/5 and service was 1/5. I said the waitress specifically because I believe the owners stopped by our table a few times and they were very nice and attentive, but our waitress whose main job it was to take care of us was severely lacking in her skills. She was extremely inattentive and never checked on us after our food was delivered by the owner to see if our order was correct or the food satisfactory. Our waters sat empty and she never asked if we wanted another drink. It wasn't busy so there was no excuse for not even stopping by our table for over 25 minutes. When she did finally stop by all she said was \"are you done with your plate?\" She was so awkward I almost laughed. 
My husband who was a restaurant manager at a very busy restaurant in his younger years picked up and commented on the poor service before our food even arrived. I initially did not think it was that bad....and then she never checked on us after our food was delivered and I quickly found that my husband was right. I can honestly say that has very rarely happened to us in all of our dining experiences. This ranks in the top 3 worst service experiences we've had in the 15 years we've been together. It is a shame because the food was good and the live music was enjoyable, but I am not sure we can get past the exceptionally poor service to actually go back. If we got that waitress again I think we'd just walk out so I doubt we'll take our chances."}
{"text":"We're visiting Scottsdale and I stumbled upon Carvalho's while searching on Yelp for nearby restaurants with the filter \"good for kids\". It caught my eye because it was it was Brazilian food and I've been unable to find many Brazilian restaurants that are not churrascarias in my hometown.  But good for kids? Based on the pictures, it looked way too nice to be taking kids. But trust in Yelp...

I was pleasantly surprised how accommodating and understanding they were of our toddler! We came at 5pm (because when you have young children that's when you eat) and were able to enjoy happy hour. We had caipirinhas, the beef skewers, fried yuca, pao de queijo, and moqueca de peixe. All were delicious."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful meal Saturday night. There were four of us (granddaughters aged nearly 12 and nearly 9), my husband and me. Lovely setting with beautiful patios (we ate inside as it was quite cold). Live combo playing soft Brazilian music. Decorated to feel elegant, yet \"homey\". The food was traditional (not touristy steak on a stick). Between us we had the Pasteis (fried turnovers), Feijoada (traditional black bean stew), Fettuccine Na Caipirnha (grilled chicken on fettuccine in a muddled lime and cachica sauce), the Prato Feito (traditional plate with rice, black beans, grilled chicken and cabbage salad), and the chocolate cake with coconut filling. Everything was delicious. Good choice of wines. Excellent service!"}
{"text":"Craving something different from the southwest American cuisine, we dropped by for happy hour and early dinner on Friday. We tried the chicken and potato croquette, Brazilian cheese bread, cheese pasty, and the shrimp and fish moqueca. It ended up being too much food for two - we took some of it home, but everything was really good. I would definitely come back for the moqueca, a delicious seafood, coconut curry stew dish. They also had a very nice patio by the fake steam, which made our meal very relaxing. Happy hour is definitely a great place to start but the other dishes on the main menu looked great too. I would love to come back to try some of the other dishes."}
{"text":"Went to Carvalho's last night and the service was excellent and the food was outstanding.
Had the Espetinho de Camarão (shrimp on a Skewer) and the Churrasquinho De Gato (beef on a skewer) for appetizers. Both were very good.The Moqueca de Peixe (seafood stew) which was outstanding. A nice glass of wine and coffee after. I do travel to Brazil often and the menu comprises of traditional Brazilian dishes that are authentically prepared. Most of the meals are gluten free so being on a gluten free diet this was a major plus in my book. I will be back as I was quite happy."}
{"text":"Real authentic food,  the service was great. Very comfy and clean. We will definitely eat at Carvalho's Brazilian Kitchen again. Our family of 9 had a wonderful mother's day."}
{"text":"This Brazilian restaurant is as authentic as it gets. From the decor inside that the owner, Phil personally collected himself, to the ambiance and the food!!  Delicious and priced very well. The service was impeccable. They have inside and outside seating as well.  Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Perfect meal, Amazing Service, Cute Waitress, and AMAZING FOOD!!!  Whether you ate going for a nice evening out, or to impress a date with your highly tuned food tastes; this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Came here while visiting Phoenix from out of town. Gave it a try based on the yelp reviews and I was not disappointed. I lived in Brazil for a few years and the food was as good as any restaurant in São Paulo or Rio. 

I had the Pão de Queijo  and the Mandioca Frita  as an appetizer and the Picanha and Feijuada as our main dish. It was amazing. Service was excellent too. Must try in northern Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Finally had the opportunity to go here. I love family run business such as this. The owner made a point to visit each table for meet and greet. They had restaurant week menu in addition to their regular menu. We ordered from both and everything we had was delicious from the appetizer to dessert. The restaurant is very clean and portion sizes are big. Service was exceptional as well. What more can you ask for. I will be going back."}
{"text":"Went with friends to try this new restaurant during AZ Restaurant Week expecting good food but maybe not so good service after reading some previous reviews. The service wasn't bad.. I think they are trying to work on it. The wait staff doesn't gave the finesse that some of the finer dining establishments have. They start you off with complimentary fried plantain chips, very good. The cocktail, Caipirinha tasted like a Margarita and was very good.  All the food was fabulous! The appetizers were great cheese bread was very good but the pasties were better; was flaky and delicious. We could have eaten a ton of the skewered shrimp, just so very tasty perfectly marinated. The Green Soup was rich and delicious and we really liked our entrees the Fejoada, our friend thought was great, my husband and I had the Picanha also very good. We were all so very full with the huge portion sizes and 3 courses we had a hard time finishing dessert. But dessert was delicious too! Everyone got the chocolate coconut cake which looked wonderful and very rich. I had the flan and it was probably one of the flans I've ever had, very creamy.  The owner Phil stopped by several times to make sure we were happy and it was nice to see a family run business; 2 sons, daughter and his wife all working hard. They had live music with a wonderful Brazilian singer and they didn't rush us out we were there 3 1/2 hours. If you go and love coffee you've got to get the Brazilian coffee each cup is made fresh! We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Family owned business with owner visiting each table trying to make your experience uniquely enjoyable. First time I'd had slow drip coffee table side other than when visiting San Francisco. Obviously Brazilian coffee, an improvement from standard and comparable in enjoyment to a well made cappuccino. Not your standard Brazilian restaurant. Thanks for the experience."}
{"text":"Excellent food , fresh and authentic.  Great drinks!!!  A fantastic Tito's and Tonic. A very nice family owned place with a high level of service. Live music on Saturdays!"}
{"text":"Lunch was exceptional. The owner spent time going through the menu   The steak appetizer and cheese bread were great.  

Platines were very good as well. Highly recommend this restaurant for both the food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful experience here, honestly I did not eat the food but will be back to try. My children had desert while I enjoyed a glass of wine, we stepped out and enjoyed the hammock on there patio. The reason why I give this place a 5 star is because the owner was so welcoming, he shared so much knowledge on his background and shared his history with us, he has lovely showcase of things, I love his welcoming and sharing his story's a wonderful family man and a very welcoming individual!!! We are looking forward to going back!!"}
{"text":"Our first time with Brazilian food and we were NOT disappointed. Our server was exceptionally knowledgeable and friendly. The menu all sounded divine, but we opted for the Beef and Bean stew and seafood stew. Very generous portions and flavors that were out of this world! We will definitely be back on our next trip to Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Great food from start to finish. We were a party of 13, service was great and everyone thoroughly enjoyed their meal. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was absolutely amazing. I called to make a reservation and Jose was extremely friendly including when I had to call back and change the time. Got to the restaurant and the host, Spencer, was just as friendly. Our server Aaron was friendly and on top of it with descriptions and suggestions and checked on us often. I forgot the owners name, but he was awesome going around and making sure everyone was happy and told wonderful stories about his childhood and the artifacts that he'd collected and now have them placed in the restaurant. The food was so tasty. It was filled with flavor and the right amount of seasoning in each dish. With my family being from the islands I'm a connoisseur when it comes to amazing food and Carvalho's did not disappoint. We had Feijoada, Prato Feito with pork ribs, and Moqueca de Peixe. All three dishes were five stars. We're excited to visit again and try the other amazing dishes on the menu. If you enjoy good food, you'll love this place."}
{"text":"I've been here twice for the dinner service. The service is great and the food is amazing. The first time I went was with one other person and the second time was with a group of 36 women. Both night we had Aaron as a service and he is wonderful! I've had the steak, the black bean stew and heart of palm stew. DELICIOUS!! Great value! I look forward to returning"}
{"text":"The food here is REALLY GOOD!  We have been here twice now, and tried different foods each time.  Even items I might not usually order are amazing!  The owners are super friendly as well."}
{"text":"Restaurant week! I love spending my long weekend with my closet friends trying out new restaurant and sharing good food together. I knew it was going to be a good experience as soon as I walked in. The outdoor patio & the interior are beautifully decorated. We were greeted by the owner of the restaurant & seated by his daughter. The general environment was just simply relaxing. 

When the menu arrived, I was having a tough time pronouncing all the items Lol....3 of us ordered off the restaurant week menu (how can we pass up a 4 course meal for $33/person?) & my friend ordered a dish off menu. We all shared it family style. 

For entree, I ordered the Pasteis (fried turnover stuff with beef). I slice it into 6 pieces for everyone to try out. It was absolutely delicious. The meat was well seasoned & pastries was soft and flaky. The second course came with the bean soup which I didn't really care for. I didn't like beans so naturally I probably wouldn't like the soup neither Lol. For main entree, I had Picanha Grelhada. The steak is bit tougher than I wanted. Overall, it is still tasty.  The side dishes that it came with (grilled pineapple and brailizan potato salad) were absolutely delicious. For dessert, I ordered a Brazilian flan. It had just the right amount of sweet. The other dessert, chocolate Truffles were amazingly delicious.

Overall, it was an amazing experience. My friends & I were laughing, sharing good food & stories of our lives. Enjoying good food together. Service was wonderful and I love our waiter. It was simply a wonderful night. I'll most definitely come back here again."}
