{"text":"Today was my second time going to this Tequeria.  I heard a lot of good things about this place and after reading the reviews I thought \"wow,  I have to try this place.\". Boy oh boy were these reviewers wrong. On my first visit I got a burrito de tripas and enough carne asada tacos to feed my family of 4. The tacos were edible but not \"amazing\" and the tripas were disgusting. They were just boiled and excessively chewy not at all fried like they claim to prepare them. After that visit (in April) my husband and I decided to give them a second chance so we went today(June).  BIG MISTAKE!  Our order consistent of Mendo 9 Carne asada tacos, 2 tacos de pastor,  4tacos de tripas ( we asked for them to be fried because we like them crunchy).  We had the order to go because it's  only  3 minute drive.  We arrive home and sit down for our meal to our disappointment they had forgotten 2 Carne asada tacos, the tripas were once again excessively chewy (not fried at all), and the menudo was cold, greasy and lacking flavors that it's well known for.  Not at all the \"RICO MENUDO\" they advertise. I did try calling to speak to who ever is in charge unfortunately the phone rings a few times and goes into voice-mail but the voice-mail is full.  I will definitely NOT be patronizing this place again."}
{"text":"These are my favorite tacos in town, and you have to try the Gringas-- giant quesadillas with pork and pineapple!  It is a hole in the wall, family owned place, not fancy but great food and great people!  

They also cater private events and do a great job--I first learned about them when they did an event at my school."}
{"text":"These tacos are great! I go pretty often to this place to get my taco fix for the week."}
{"text":"This place has the best tacos.. $1 tacos on tuesdays! The chicken there is the best. You have to try it.. the staff is very friendly and they are also very quick. I hope for the best with this place... they are doing good things and they deserve it."}
{"text":"Now this place I am crazy about. We have been regulars here for 2 years now. Consistency and quality are always guaranteed. I bring many friends and family to try this place as opposed to their regular carniceria, and they convert. I am happy to live very near this location to frequent it as often as I do."}
{"text":"This place has the best tacos al pastor and asada. I can truly say this is authentic Mexican food and with an amazing flavor! 
I recommend it."}
{"text":"Bomb tacos hands down! Super legit and super cheap! The pastor is my favorite. It's a dive place but a must have if you like authentic street tacos. On the weekends they have a taco cart outside and can get pretty packed so make sure to go before it gets to hot outside."}
{"text":"My first taste of southwest Mexican food and it did not disappoint! The Sopes were amazing! The tacos my co-workers ordered looked amazing and they said were delicious! Tiny joint. Authentic and fresh!"}
{"text":"One of the great neighborhood finds in this area. The food is great and the new expansion makes it that much better."}
{"text":"Had their tacos pollo and Carne at Arizona taco festival and was sooo tasty way better than a majority of others the line was long but for good reasons! I will be stopping by to pick up pollo for dinner tonight! Good Job guys your tacos are better than the other guys."}
{"text":"I only give them 4 stars because it was hot as hell in there. Otherwise everything about the food was great. I had a asada and pastor burrito with everything... bomb. The green salsa.. bomb. The light green salsa was spicy but good and the red salsa was more bold but also good. Don't know if they were tryna save electricity or what but I felt no A/C. And the fans on the ceiling weren't on. I was sweating while eating so I felt a little uncomfortable."}
{"text":"literally best taco spot in arizona!!!!! we are here at least once a week... can't get enough!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow some of the best tacos in Phoenix Arizona. It's tucked away in a old neighborhood so if someone doesn't tell you about it, you want find it. This was purely luck that I was in the neighborhood on yelp looking for somewhere to have lunch and there it was. A very busy yet small place but huge flavor for the tacos. I had two asada and two pastor tacos."}
{"text":"Delcious tacos for $1.50?! Count me in! They had chicken, steak, pork, cow tongue, tripe...etc. They also had burritos, cubanas, tostadas, menudo, etc.. Those I hope to try on another visit. 

The location is in a random plaza right near the freeway wall, which is a little off putting but don't let that sway you. You have to wind down some neighborhood streets to find. 

Overall service was good and the place was pretty much at capacity during the lunch time rush. I will be sure to visit again!"}
{"text":"Came by this place yesterday to pick up some tacos to go and let me tell you this place looks amazing compared to how it looked before. That's about the only thing that has changed at this place. Food is still great!! Love their street tacos. I've had carne asada, pastor and longaniza and they don't disappoint. Pastor is a bit on the greasy side but still taste good nonetheless.  Place is always clean and employees are great too. Glad this place is not too far from me."}
{"text":"I first tried Tacos Huicho at the Tacolandia festival and they were by far my favorite tacos at the event. Other shops were trying to get fancy but Tacos Huicho was holding it down. On the real, these are some of the best tacos al pastor I've had in Phoenix. They don't play around with their salsas either. They are spicy and that's the way I like it. This is my favorite taco shop and I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Small place,  tacos de asada, and tacos de pastor are some of the better tacos I've eaten lately at this place.  
They have tortas, alambres, y burros."}
{"text":"We had Tacos Huicho's cater my father's retirement party last night. They were such a big hit. The food was amazing and they were so professional and great at setting up and taking down everything. They got there about an hour before the party started to set up and helped me set up so.e other stuff for the party too. They were so nice. The food was amazing too, I think I ate about 8 of their street tacos and my husband ate like 12... hahaha. The meat was so tender a d seasoned just right and the salsas and guac were delicious. I will be having them cater lots more events for us in the future."}
{"text":"The tacos are so good. My husband had a torta and loved it! Cheap and delicious! The red salsa was spicy and was marvelous with our food."}
{"text":"Amazing. Tacos. This is up there with Tacos Haliscos - absolutely the best tacos. the Al Pastor is to die for. When we went there, something may have been being fixed in the kitchen, because they had an awesome outdoor set up with grills and tables out front, in 110 degree heat. I was so impressed! LOL."}
{"text":"The tacos are really good! So is the rice.
I am not a big fan of their re-fried beans (my husband on the other hand likes it).
I wouldn't buy their chips and salsa.
But the tacos or burritos are recommended.
The picture is of the combo plate (3 tacos + rice and beans)"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite taco shop in all of Arizona. I came across them a few years ago at the Taco Festival in Scottsdale. They always have the longest line at the taco festival and I make it a point to show everyone this place. They're well worth the drive from Tempe to Phx. Everything is great here. I typically get tacos de cabeza, carne asada, and tripe. I wouldn't say I like tripe but this the only place I've been to North of the border that knows exactly how to make tripe. The tripe is crispy and so flavorful but not so greasy. They have a green salsa with little chunks of avocados and a red salsa that will bring you to tears but absolutely necessary to put on your tacos. Great service every time I go and I have my family absolutely addicted."}
{"text":"Love their taco Tuesday,
But food is good everyday!!.
Quick service an affordable prices .
Can't ask for more..,"}
{"text":"Go on the weekend and witness the Al Pastor in action and taste the deliciousness for yourself!"}
{"text":"This is officially my go to place for tacos!! They have the best meat and cooked to perfection! Try the pastor tacos and asada burrito, you won't be let down"}
{"text":"My favorite place for tacos in Phoenix. They've expanded to a nearby location so they can accommodate more people (mostly Hispanics eating here). Everything I've had here has been excellent. They are fast and efficient. On weekends they take over the parking lot with a giant outdoor kitchen because of the demand. The green salsa is exceptional, and the prices are good. Overall, a notch or two above any of even the best hipster tacos joints or hole-in-the-wall places."}
{"text":"The best Tacos al Pastor I've had anywhere.  They load em fat as well, and double wrap so you can improvise and get two out one, especially nice on $1 Taco Tuesday.  The Gringa (Quesadilla) with Pastor or Carne Asada is fabulous.  This place wins awards for a reason, IT'S ALL THAT...The green salsa with Avocado is also very special.. A lot of bang for the buck here.."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best tacos I have ever eaten, period. Tacos are simple street variety but pack a wallop of flavor. Just the right blend of soft corn tortilla and fillings - yummy. When we got there at 6:45 on a Saturday night, the kitchen was moved outside of the restaurant - obviously to help with crowd control. There was a continuous line of 10-12 patrons placing their orders at the walk up counter.  Inside the restaurant it was packed but we managed to snag a table for the four of us - just wait a few and someone will clear out.  The total bill was $22 (about 10 tacos and two Horchatas) although I probably could have eaten twice as many tacos than I ordered. Not because they are small or they skimp on the fillings - it's because they are just that good. No sides, no frills, just great tacos!!  Salsa bar lets you spice them up as you wish - don't miss trying their great tomatillo salsa. Thick, green and delicious. The three tacos I ordered were beef tongue, brains and steak. All were incredible. Can't wait to go back. FYI - If you are looking for a fancy Mexican restaurant, this is not the place for you and they do not have a liquor license. BUT if you are looking for some of the finest tacos Phoenix has to offer then Tacos Huicho is it!"}
{"text":"Buenos tacos a un precio accesible los tacos árabes están muy buenos y la torta de pastor con queso"}
{"text":"Yes, Tacos Huicho live up to the hype. Love coming here, specially on the weekends when they are making the tacos outside. Highly recommend this place if you need a taco fix."}
{"text":"This place catered a tailgate for the ND - ASU game last weekend, and I can say with 100% certainty that they are the best tacos I've had in my life. The meats are cut in a way that allows you to put just enough on the taco, and the juices don't bleed through. Oh yeah and the meats are salted perfectly. I had 9 tacos, and though I don't live in the area would consider stopping by just for a lunch! The employees are super friendly and really enjoyed the time - this was an unforgettable taco experience! I want some now..."}
{"text":"Ate here a while back and really enjoyed the tacos.  They have since relocated next door into a much better place with the same prices. Carne asada and al pastor travis area my favs."}
{"text":"Came here to pick up some carne asada and salsa to cook for dinner...well it's not that kind of party.  Everything here is cooked to order.  I quickly switched gears and ordered two pastor tacos (can't let a trip go to waste).  Paid a couple bucks and took a seat.  A few minutes later my order was up.

The tacos were double wrapped, packed with meat, and fresh off the grill.  This is what I am talking about.  All these new taco shops are popping up all over that are charging 3 bucks a taco and the food is precooked and waiting for you to order.  Not here.  That dude cooked it up right in front of me and was generous bout it.

The flavor was awesome.  I put some green and red salsas on it from the bar and threw those bad mothas back.  My goodness...

Def would come back and mos def would recommend.  Not a carniceria in the way I thought it was but what a great find for tacos.  They had a pretty good menu: tortas, burros, tripas, etc. so I will try some of the rest next time."}
{"text":"Hidden Gem- my son and I were out taco hopping (we will go to 2-3 places and have a taco and move on!) Taco Huicho was the first one we went to on this particular day. We get a Carne Asada and a El Pastor. We each ate half of each taco. I was in love! These are obviously street size and by the time we got to the next place I was full! They are chucked full of meat and delicious! The salsa is tasty, fresh and the place is clean. They practically make the food right in front of you on the hot grill. Don't underestimate the power of the little place it is great!!"}
{"text":"Delicious tacos!! Small carniceria that makes food inside such as, tacos, tortas, quesadillas and burritos. They also have some bomb guacamole salsa and another delicious red salsa.  At night they bring everything outside and have a taco stan in front of the building in the parking lot. Probably some of the best tacos in Phoenix! A hidden gem for sure."}
{"text":"I could eat carne asada every day.  

This is the best carne asada burrito I've ever had.  
Period.  

The beef was juicy, salty, and delicious.  (Carne asada can be pretty tough.  This was not at all.)  I wanted to drink the green salsa that came on the side with the burrito.  The tortilla was cooked perfectly, warm and brown with flavor from the flat top.  I like my burritos with beans and cheese.  The ratio of each to the beef was excellent.  

There was a small line when I got there, which worried me slightly as I have a limited time for lunch.  The line moved quickly.  I was also standing in line behind two Phoenix cops, which is the highest endorsement a small hole-in-the-wall place can get. Firemen and police know where to eat.  

The people who worked there were smiling and polite and the prices were VERY reasonable.  

I couldn't ask for anything more."}
{"text":"This place serves some of the tastiest street tacos I've had in all my years here in Arizona. Glad I found another fine gem of a taqueria, with the best, juiciest tacos de lengua (among other things) I've ever had. Not surprisingly, it is extremely popular even if it is not exactly in the best of neighborhoods."}
{"text":"Tried three different tacos places yesterday to compare them,  these were the best the meat was tasty,  soft and juicy. The salsas can make or break a taco in my opinion, and they hit it out of the park! Will diffiently be back."}
{"text":"Carne asada tacos are bomb!! so far, the best street tacos I've had in phx since I've moved up here. fulfilling portion & doubled tortillas. The price is right. Salsa bar is awesome with salsas & guac! A lil small in here but the ppl move fast. Def coming back again & again & again"}
{"text":"Tallyho! Time to tag Tacos Huicho to Thursday's tasty tantalizing taco trek, they're the tops; they'll tickle those tonsils.

I've had my fill of standing in hour long lines at Central Phoenix's other late night taco stand just a few miles away on camelback, which sent me in search of something just as good, but not such a burden on your patience. I've visited Tacos Huicho for lunch, I've been here for dinner and yep, also late night. While not quite as late night as the spot open until 2am, they're happy to serve until midnight on the weekends, which is plenty late enough for me the few times I've been craving a taco past 10pm.

They've got tacos at 1.50 per, and in my opinion, well worth the price. They're not a full service restaurant, so don't come in expecting table service. During their day time business hours, you can find them cooking inside behind the counter, but visit in the evenings on the weekends and you'll find them cooking outside on their cooktop grill. Maybe its easier on the ventilation, maybe it's easier than having the 10 minute long line of people waiting inside, maybe it's because their outdoor grill can cook more food than their indoor grill. Whatever the reason, they're doing something right.

A little known secret to their success, I think, is their uber delicious hot salsa. Every order of food from their grill comes with a serving of it and it burns so good. Not in a \"I can't even taste the salsa this is so hot\", but in a \"I tasted this awesome sauce, and a few moments later, I can really feel the burn\" kind of way. Get some, you won't be sorry you did, unless you don't like spicy food, then I would suggest you avoid it.

I'll be back for sure, the only real question is just how long can I go without making a stop back in?

Happy Yelping Phoenix, eat more tacos!"}
{"text":"Really wanted to like this place. Was recommended by a client who swore by this little taco shop at the wall of the 51 freeway @ Oak. Staff was overall pretty rude & the tacos were.. How u say I need a Pepto b sry Tacos Chiwas the bomb digg tacos thx!"}
{"text":"Meant to take a picture of my tacos then I got carried away. We're absolutely delicious At a very low price, 1.75-It's at hole in the wall on Oak Street off from Cambridge.Place was packed! Delicious flavors. I got an assortment and every bite was so seasoned just right! Very friendly staff! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"So my friend told me about this place and said it was great. I disagree 3stars at best I had some al pastor and asada tacos. They weren't anything special and they were kind of overpriced for the quality of taco and meat if you ask me. I wouldn't recommend this place or eat here again."}
{"text":"Thee best $1.50 street tacos I've had in Phoenix over the past 17 years, definitely worth checking out or making the drive. Try the red and green salsas...both have great flavor and the el pastor taco was the bomb!"}
{"text":"For benchmarking I always order Lengua and/or Tripas, and these guys are doing it right. Will come again. 4.5/5"}
{"text":"Your basic barrio taco house.  Tiny tacos at tiny ($1.50/each) prices.  Salsa bar offered green sauce, sliced radishes, and chopped greens.  There are about a hundred and fifty similar options all over the Valley - and this one seemed pretty standard, though authentic, to me.  Personally I would prefer paying a buck or so extra per taco for a more meaty and hygienic experience.  Lengua, though sparsely served, was pretty decent.  Tripa not so much..."}
{"text":"Whoo boy. I was on my way to another extremely popular taco joint in the neighborhood and saw a line out the door. Pulled over, checked Yelp, and saw this little place nearby. I'm so glad I did, I think something changed inside me. These could very well be the best tacos I have eaten north of the border. Nothing fancy; you wont find find hipsters behind the counter, no coffee-braised anything, just simple and straight-to-the-point amazing street tacos. And I'm a man who knows my tacos. Trust me, eat here."}
{"text":"Top taco shop in Phoenix. So authentic I thought I was in Mexico. Want bomb tacos? Go to tacos Huicho"}
{"text":"One of my new favorite spots for street tacos, right after Backyard tacos. However, I feel like this is more comparable to the tacos by Charlie's.

I was excited when I drove up to this location. It's always a good sign when there's a line for food. It's even a better sign when's there's the al pastor is actually slow kicked on the rotating skewer machine - that just makes my mouth watery already.

From least to favorite, i tried the chorizo, carne asada, and al pastor. I just planned out didn't like the chorizo - I thought it was over cooked. The carne Adams was good, but not the best. The al pastor was spot on! It's marinated very well and cooked very well. It's not soggy or drenched in oil but yet not dry. 

Also, loved the salsa here - very flavorful. You can also ask for grilled onions; grilled onions will always win some extra brownie points with me. Hot hats was smooth and milky with good amount of sweetness and spices - none of that chalky powdery texture.

Best of all their prices are good!"}
{"text":"So fresh so good.  Really sweet folks who have lots of pride for serving the best street tacos in Phoenix. Lines are sometimes long but its way worth the wait.  Once your order is in food out quick with fresh onions, cilantro, kick ass salsas on the best tacos to ever enter your taste buds.  The garnish with fresh mini limes and cucumbers, perfect touch.  Inside the building is very clean and remodeled.  The night I was there a dude was singing and playing the guitar, so cool.  A perfect Saturday night. A great place for awesome tacos, Mexican food and even ice cream cones."}
{"text":"Tacos Huicho has a really good authentic street-style burrito just a light shmear of beans, lots of meat and cilantro and onions for flavor, no rice, no fillers, no-nonsense.  The tacos are good and meaty too - the only thing I would love more is if the tortillas were made in-house - then they'd be perfect!  This is definitely the taco spot in Phoenix.  On the weekends they set up outside."}
{"text":"Order the \"campechano burrito\". It's not on their new menu, but was on the menu at their old location next door. It's a combination of pastor, carne asada, onions, cilantro and beans. It's one of the best burritos you'll ever have. The meat bits are tender and have bits if crispiness on the ends. Excellent flavor and their meats have the tastiest marinades. Their red sauce is hot and flavorful, and pairs well with their guacamole sauce. I'm getting hungry as I write this.

*Pro tip#1: order the burrito with rice, sour cream and cheese. *THIS WILL BE THE BEST BURRITO  YOU WILL EVER HAVE IN YOUR LIFE, SO PREPARE YOU MIND FOR THIS CULINARY MASTERPIECE.

*Pro tip#2: while you wait for the burrito, you can make a small salad.  Start by layering sliced radishes, then top with cabbage and pico de gallo.  Add hot sauce and guacamole sauce on top."}
{"text":"I will describe this place with the following sentence : My favorite taco spot in Phoenix!!!! P.S. try the all pastor tacos they got the best in town."}
{"text":"This place is HOT! Authentic Mexican food made with love and you can just taste it! I love it!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. Everything that I have tried here has been excellent. Be prepared for how busy it is on the weekends when they move part of their operation outside. The al pastor is fantastic and the salsa is hot just the way I like it."}
{"text":"This place is incredible. $1.50 per taco is tough to beat. They're fast too. The tacos themselves are wonderful. Not much to them - meat, onions and cilantro, but they are delicious. I put lime juice on each, but I stay away from the hot sauce as the meat is seasoned well and doesn't really need much dressing. It's a gem that's tucked away and I will be returning again and again."}
{"text":"The best tacos ever. Al Pastor are amazing. And Carne Asada. But mostly al pastor seriously they are the best."}
{"text":"Used Tacos Huichos aka Taqueria Los Primos to cater our son's wedding. They served three kinds of tacos: carne, chicken, and al pastor. All were excellent. I loved that they showed up on time and had a wonderful spread of condiments. All were labeled so the guests knew how hot the salsas were. All in all they were a huge hit. Thank you!"}
{"text":"This place wuz not as hyped up as ppl said it wuz. The pastor wuz not good I've had better. The carne asada wuz good not great."}
{"text":"My friend told me I had to try this place and I am so glad I finally did. It's a small space and doesn't look like much from the outside but the food is delicious. I tried the carne asada and pastor tacos. Both were delicious but the pastor was my favorite! The tacos came with lime, cucumber and radishes on the side. The salsas were flavorful and tortillas tasted fresh. I've also tried their carne asada that is marinated there. My friends threw it on the grill and it was so good. They also bought some of the small flour tortillas from there that were perfect for tacos. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"the food here is absolutely fantastic. always fresh and hot and tasty. my favorite Mexican restaurant in Phoenix. however, the girl cashier that's young always has an attitude. she's so rude. almost makes me not want to go here."}
{"text":"What a great find!  If you want authentically Mexican food - this is the place. We tried the pollo, asada and pastor tacos. Each taco is $1.50 and so packed with flavor. It is a very small space but fortunately there was no wait on the day we went. Definitely we will be back."}
{"text":"I have been hesitating on reviewing what I feel to be the best tacos in Phoenix.  The hesitation is in part that I want primos/huichos to be kept secret.  Enough of me being selfish, this spot is Lo Mejor!
You can't go wrong with the carne or pastor but for a real tastebuds treat, treat yourself to the cecina.  Whoever dissed the tripas was wrong, not sure how they can be soft when they throw them on the grill right before your eyes.  Lengua is on point and so is the pollo.  
I have been visiting this shop for well over a year and have never had anything I did not like.  My new go to is their burritos, so good.  So for some legit tacos, burritos, even some take home meat Primos is the place!"}
{"text":"BOMB AUTHENTIC TACOS! Go on taco Tuesdays, they have select tacos for only $1! My favorite meat choice is Al Pastor fresh off the trompo! This spot is rather small so If you need personal space, call it in for carry out or there is outside seating BUT IT'S COLD CUH! SOPES AL PASTOR ARE A MUST EAT WITH THE SALSA ROJA!!! My mouth is legit salivating just thinking about their tacos!"}
{"text":"Finally made my visit to Tacos Huicho as my ongoing trek for the best tacos in Arizona continues. Read good reviews by fellow yelpers of this place. I believe they just renovated the dining area as I did not see the broken chairs, sticky tiles, nor limited seating that some yelpers experienced. I was introduced to laminate flooring, new chairs, and fresh smell of paint. Also the fact that they were repairing the bathrooms during business hours was quite frank as you can hear the workers drilling away (it was really loud, quick tip may want to compete repairs before or after business hours). Now to the tacos, they were above average at best as nothing spectacular about it: cabeza, pastor, longaniza, and tripa. There was no salsa bar described by others but bottles of there salsa itself. I gave it an extra star as the price cannot be beat, $1.10 for the three tacos for tacos Tuesday special and $1.50 for the tripa taco! I believe all tacos are $1.50 on a regular day. Total paid was $4.90 for four tacos, which is unheard of nowadays as most tacos shops charge at least $2 per taco. You get more variety here and bang for your buck. Though it won't hit my top 10 tacos shops here in AZ, it definitely lands within the Top 20. I shall come back again and try the rest of their listed tacos!"}
{"text":"These are by far the best tacos in town. But don't just try the tacos...try everything here. You will not be disappointed! The location is Definitely in a shadier part of town but don't let that discourage you. So so so good"}
{"text":"Love Tacos Huicho. Pastor tacos with some lime and that delicious green sauce with a little bit of the HOT red  out of this world."}
{"text":"I loved this place! They were out of chicken when I got there, so I went with carne asada tacos instead. This is normally a mistake (at places like Filiberto's), but theirs was wonderful! I'm looking forward to going again!"}
{"text":"I had been waiting to try the tacos from this place and I was pleasantly surprised when I did. This is a walk up and order and sit wherever you'd like restaurant. Don't let the exterior scare you either, it's not the most aesthetically pleasing. The serve you on paper plates as well. Please don't expect five star dining either. This is a family ran and owned business and stays true to its nature. The menu is simple and the food is tasty. The tacos are truly authentic street tacos that you would be served if you were in Mexico City. They have a salsa bar which I highly recommend. I tried several tacos and enjoyed all of them. I would have given a fifth star if the chicken wasn't so crispy, it had been over cooked."}
{"text":"This is a solid spot for some carne asada tacos.  The salsas were really good. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Best tacos I have ever had the meat tastes fresh and vestibule looks fresh as well I love it for lunch, dinner and on weekends!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. We go almost every Tuesday for the special. Anytime we go anywhere else for tacos, we wish we went here instead. So much food for the price, and it is always AWESOME!!!!! It's hard not to come here a couple times a week...."}
{"text":"Visited this place Sunday 6.17.18
I do not often give 1 star ratings to businesses. I am not picky with my food and I will try everything once but here it goes.... 

The customer service was not a great experience.
The person taking our order spoke English so I began to order in English because I was with an English speaking party, as soon as the person realized I was a native Spanish speaker he only spoke in Spanish to us. My English speaking party shared with the man that we were very excited about being there and he completely ignored him and would only direct to me in Spanish.

It was very disturbing  because I felt the tension.

The food was okay, Their pastor tacos has too much fat, the longaniza tacos are not good and their tripas taco did not have lots of meat. we asked for cheese in our beans and didn't not get any.

I will not recommend this place to anyone I know."}
{"text":"It's been a hot minute since I've had a good tasting taco! Had the asada tacos and tried a bite off my kid's cheese quesadilla. Tacos were delicious as was the huge but tasty (meatless) quesadilla. This is a hidden gem, located in the most random spot. Will sure be back to try the Guarache and the Al Pastor tacos!"}
{"text":"Tacos Huicho is well . . . I don't know what you would call it. A restaurant? Sort of, except they cook everything outside in the parking lot. You can then either eat inside or outside. Additional items, such as the salsa bar and some extra treats are located inside the building. 

A lot of people seem to be praising this place like it's the second coming of Christ. My girlfriend and I ordered a combination of tacos, including asada and their highly recommended al pastor. I also threw in a gringa, which includes al pastor with cheese and pineapple. There is canned soda, but no bottled Coke. 

The tacos here are decent quality in comparison to a lot of places that charge similar prices. They're good - but I didn't find them to be superior to what I've had at some of the other hole-in-the-wall joints. I regret not getting pineapple on my pastor tacos (we weren't asked). It worked well with the gringa - even if it was a bit grease-heavy.

We didn't eat inside, because the place was very dirty. All of the tables were covered in leftover food. Additionally, a worker damn-near ran me over when I was trying to cautiously carry my salsas and limes outside. He either didn't notice or didn't care. Clearly, customer service needs a bit of work.

If you pay with a debit/credit card, like pretty much everyone in 2017, you'll get the 50-cent small-business upcharge that I actually forgot still exists. The girl taking our order forgot to add the soda, so she had to ring up a second transaction. Thankfully, I had some spare change, because there's no way I'm paying two separate service fees on the account of their mistake.

In the end, they're good for some cheap eating - but probably not a place we'd ever return to."}
{"text":"Amazing tacos, great prices, awesomely me employees, cute restaurant, and great hot sauce & pico for the tacos!!!"}
{"text":"No other pastor or Asada tacos beat theirs. Not frontera not los Yaquis. Plus they're reasonable with the price and the amount of meat on each taco. You won't go wrong going here."}
{"text":"this neighborhood secret has some of the best pork al pastor i have ever had in phoenix, and thats saying a lot. friendly service and amazing food at a cheap price, i can't recommend it enough, especially if you like pork"}
{"text":"Great hole in the wall !! Don't let the neighbourhood hold you back!! Tacos are amazing  I will for sure be back SOON !"}
{"text":"Some of the best tacos in Phoenix, especially there al pastor tacos. Staff is very friendly, and restaurant is clean."}
{"text":"If you have a pick up phone number just for phone orders we'll pick it up.  Walked in and about 15 people sitting and the dudes said they were busy.  Lame excuse pick up the phone that's what it's for."}
{"text":"Man just found this Lil hole in the wall joint in the hood but man it is worth it and cheap the food is off a cart just like in Mexico believe me you will not be disappointed Loved It"}
{"text":"The best taco place I know! Proud to say I've been coming here since I was they first opened. I would love to see this place expand!"}
{"text":"Damn this place is good. I've eaten pretty much everything on the menu by this point and I can tell you three things:

1)hangover cure
2)bellybuster
3)totes worth it

Go for the al pastor, stay because you're so full and don't want to move."}
{"text":"I've died and gone to al pastor heaven. These tacos are legit and at $1.50 a piece you can't go wrong.  The carne asada was also pretty good but the al pastor won the game. 

The salsa bar is awesome with a range of medium to hot and green to red salsas. I like to go crazy and Christmas my tacos so I get a taste of both red and green in every bite. Muy Bueno"}
{"text":"Best street tacos! We've met people here that have driven from Glendale and Mesa because the food is that good. Excellent Carne Asada. Reminds me so much of street tacos in Mexico."}
{"text":"We recently hired Tacos Huicho for our wedding this past weekend and boy was it a HIT! The food was amazing per usual (we love frequenting their local shop as well), and all of our wedding guests raved and raved about the food. Everything is just so savory and they brought their ovens onsite which made it an extra cool experience, along with homemade salsas, beans, and rice. We were so happy and they are very reasonably priced as well. We would 100% hire them again if we ever needed food for an event! Although the booking process was handled entirely via text and isn't very conventional, you will absolutely not regret booking them!"}
{"text":"The best tacos in town.  This is my reward for anytime I'm doing well or need a boost. A little hidden,  but that's what makes this place such a treasure.  I was never a fan of pastor until this place.  Now that's the only thing i get here!!"}
{"text":"This place is money. Went here on a Friday night around 11pm, and it was packed with a line of about 20 people waiting to order and tons of cars piled up in the parking lot, with good reason. The tacos and burritos were amazing with really tasty al pastor and carne. The quesadilla was enormous and packed with meat, don't think I would order chorizo with this again, it was too greasy of a pairing. The salsas were amazing as well. Watch out for the red sauce, it's got a kick."}
{"text":"Best home cooked fast and easy Mexican food. Authentic, yummy, sopes, meat and food not overly salty. I'd like to come back here as often as I can."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food. Great tacos. Coming from a Mexican family I can be tough critic on Mexican food it's hard to find a taco place that sparks my interest. This would be one of them. Great service as well. Highly recommend:)"}
{"text":"Coming from San Diego I feel like maybe I was taco spoiled. The absolute best tacos I have ever had where at my finger tips in Tijuana or could even be found at Tacos El Gordo in SD. That being said this is the number 1 spot I have found for tacos that can match my home town taco level. 
The meat is prepared fresh from the in house carnicería and this is the only place I have found in Phoenix that uses a trompo/ spit to roast their al pastor. This is a huge litmus test for authenticity in my book because if the meat is not prepared correctly it turned into nuggety chili covered dog food that is passed off as al pastor. That is 100%not the case here. They have the finest meat cooked whole and chopped to order. 
All tacos come with onion, cilantro, and salsa but gauc can be found inside at a salsa bar. You can treat yourself to as much as you want with no extra charge something I believe should never be a premium at any taco shop. To top it all off they had champurada during winter and normally have several aguas frescas to wash down their tacos."}
{"text":"Can't believe I didn't know this was here. I helped a guy jump start his truck, his wife and six daughters in the cab. He told me this was the best taco joint in town. 

Even ran into Nino from Nino's Greek Cafe. I had the Cubana Torta of course. Can you say mouth-gasm? Get that!"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb, its not a classy place by any means, but the food is economical and delicious. $1.25 small tacos, the pastor is amazing! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Yelp is meant for finding places like this. In a sea of corporate taco malls, Taco Huicho stood alone as the taco spot I hadn't heard of at the Arizona Taco Festival. Their pastor tacos reminded me of my favorite street taco place in Cabo which I constantly crave and haven't been able to find a substitute for here in Phoenix. 

That all happened Sunday. As in... yesterday. 

Needless to say, lunchtime rolled around and I got that familiar craving and decided to find them on yelp since I had no clue where they were located. I would definitely describe their location as \"tucked away,\" but the dot on the yelp map was 100% spot on. 

Round two with the pastor was even better than the first. It came out super hot and the salsa bar is nothing short of amazing. There aren't 15 different types of exotic, over-thought salsas but everything tasted fresh and delicious. Located on the counter I saw a small unassuming trophy for the recent taco festival - 1st place - People's Choice. No surprise. That kind of trophy seems fitting for this place, no flash necessary when you do it like this. 

Every restaurant in the greater Phoenix area that is even thinking about serving a taco should come here first. This goes double for the Scottsdale \"luxury cantinas\" that charge $4.00+ for a taco. Now I'm not saying you have to be cheaper, but if Tacos Huicho can inspire me to write a novel about their tacos at $1.25 a pop you can put something semi tasty together for 4 times that. 

I fully expect Tacos Huicho (and the associated Carniceria) to end up in a top spot on yelp with 100+ reviews and a 4.5* + rating. It would be criminal if they don't become one of the hot taco dives of Phoenix."}
{"text":"Best tacos in Phoenix without question. Also must try a quesadilla with carne asada and beans. I die."}
{"text":"This place is great!  I enjoy them at AZ Taco Festival every year and FINALLY made it to their location.  The tacos are out of this world!  Exactly what you expect and hope for from an authentic taco stand.  Thanks for staying open late for us last night too!!  We arrived at 10:55pm, closing time is 11.  They happily obliged us with multiple rounds of tacos and sodas.  Can't wait to be back!"}
{"text":"I can't recommend this little hole in the wall enough. Tucked in the neighborhood behind Phoenix Children's Hospital, the inconspicuous taco stand first piqued my interest with the aroma of finely grilled meats that wafted through the hot Phoenix air. Imagine authentic Mexican street food where the Tacos are bursting with flavor and the cool horchata quenches the heat of the hot sauce that so righteously compliments the flavors that burst forth from the perfectly grilled corn tortillas. Though the aroma drew me in, the outstanding Mexican style street food is what has me coming back for more. The pastor tacos are reminiscent of the street fare found in most border towns. Grilled to perfection on the traditional vertical spit and adorned with a pineapple on top, the pastor tacos are soul satisfying. Sadly, it is rare to find a restaurant that serves tripas cooked to perfection (not overly cooked and dried out like chicharron, yet not rubbery either). Carniceria Los Primos doesn't disappoint with their perfectly cooked tripas...accompanied with onion and cilantro. Lengua, longaniza (chorizo), and asada round up my top pics for favorite taco filling. However, what keeps me and the family coming back for more is the absolutely astounding Pastor and the ever so succulent Tripas!"}
{"text":"Finally the best tacos al pastor this side of the border. I've searched and searched for that specific taste and these guys are real close. 

Try the gringas it's a quesadilla with al pastor meat, cheese, and pineapple. It's pretty life changing. 

They serve no alcohol but luckily you can order to go and grab some cerveza from the store next door. 

Happy eating."}
{"text":"I wasn't too impressed with this place. The inside was extremely dirty: tables were not cleaned and had food on them, chairs were torn up, floors were sticky, the self serve salsa bar looked pretty dingy. The tacos were okay but the meat was extremely greasy and very crunchy. If you use a card they charge a fee and if you want pineapple on al pastor tacos they also charge."}
{"text":"Best tacos in Phoenix. They remind me of taquerias back home, super authentic. If it don't feel like Mexico in your mouth, they're not real!"}
{"text":"The tacos were good for lunch. Really reasonable pricing and great service. I tried several of the different tacos. All of them were good. I also ate the chichorines"}
{"text":"You go here and you are in Mexico. These are the most authentic al pastor tacos I had since Mexico. Salsa is great and spicy. Las quesadillas de asada estan bien buenas tambien. This place will take you back in time."}
{"text":"Not open till 11. Drive from the other side of town to get some salsa at 10pm and they were closed. Waste of time."}
{"text":"Hands down the best tacos I have ever had! & the staff is incredibly friendly! I live in Tempe but whenever I'm on that side of town... I always make sure to stop by!"}
{"text":"Pastor was awesome but the Longaniza was out of the world (greasy as they come) but really tasty. The Cabeza not so much. Try everything with their tomatillo garlic salsa."}
{"text":"The tacos are so good and well worth visiting, but dealing with the awful customer service will make you second guess it. They really need to hire someone who offers a nice friendly smile and has proper phone ethic, the young girl that is the cashier has a terrible attitude over the phone and in person, I have gone a few times and she would be on a personal call while taking orders and not really paying any attention to her task at hand ( her customers)  I return to this establishment because the food is good. But I try my best to warn folks before that they aren't as welcoming as you would think a small hole in the wall taco place should be."}
{"text":"Awesome little street taco venue tucked along 19th St and Oak in Central Phoenix.  These guys have also catered several events and parties for me and everyone is always impressed with the street tacos!"}
{"text":"This place has excellent tacos.  The prices are great for the quality and quantity of meat per taco.  
The asada tastes great and free of gristle.  The pastor is great.  The tripa is nice and crispy.  The lengua and cabeza tacos also excellent.  I've also tried the chicharron gordita.  Everything that I have tried was great.  
The salsa bar could have more options.  I've ordered take out and received salsas that were not at the salsa bar.  I would go back and recommend it to anyone looking for authentic tacos.  It's surprising to find it so hidden away in a residential neighborhood.  If they were on a main road, they'd be super busy."}
{"text":"Best authentic tacos. Everything was fresh. Taco plate came with 3 tacos, rice & beans, and soda for $7."}
{"text":"This is the place where everyone in here is Mexican, and the guy who takes your order does not speak any English, when I asked him what were regular customers' favorite items to order.  He had to get a customer out of his seat to translate for me.  These are signs of truly authentic Mexican food.

Eating buddy told me about this place, said she read about it in New Times.  Kinda hard to find your way when coming from the eastside, being that the fwy and \"wall\" is in the way, and the entrance to 16th Street from McDowelll says \"no right turn\", cos it is one-way for a few feet there.

I picked pastor (pork) meat, Cabeza  (head meat), and lengua  (tongue) for my first round, all with onions, and cilantro on them.  The tacos all tasted pretty much the same when you put the salsas on, but they were GOOD!   One think I do not like at all, is that the salsa in the salsa bar  is SOOOO COLD, the salsa in there was bordering forming ice crystals.  It is like putting ice in your tacos, the meat was hot, but I want to keep the meat that way, when I eat it.  

I liked my tacos so much, that after my square dance ended, I knew Tacos Huicho was open till 11 and I came back to have three more tacos.  Tripa, Longaniza (chorizo), and carne asada.  I could not tell the tripa was tripa, but they assured me it was.  Out of the six meats, I decided Longaniza was my favorite and most flavorful.  Another Yelper was right tho, it was very greasy, and the orange grease puddled several times in my plate as I bit into the little thing.  Next time I go, I will order Longaniza in a burrito.  Oh boy, lotsa grease.

I give the food 5 stars, but the dirty and torn up seats, dirty tables, and food particles and Coke spills on the floor 1 star.  Seemed like more than 50% of the chairs, which had black pads, had major corners missing, showing white stuffing, and MANY had big canyons opened up in them that the stuffing had been excavated by butts sitting in them, over time.   Made me think, wow, do they make so little money that they can't at least buy cushions to cover the canyons, or replace with white resin yard chairs?  

There were food particles all over the tables and floor, and before I sat down there were spills of Coke right at my feet, large spills, so I put napkins over them.  Don't wanna walk out with sticky soles.  

But since the food is good and cheap enough to come back, again and again, despite 1 star for \"dirty and pathetically ripped chairs and food particles and spills throughout\", I will be generous and give my review 4 stars, one star for being open till 11, too, so I could go eat there AFTER square dancing ends at 9:30 pm."}
{"text":"Believe the hype these tacos are delicious. Alpastor and a must is the Cecina. The hot sauce is hot and delicious. The Custer service 5 stars.."}
{"text":"I've been coming to tacos huicho for years! Hands down one my my favorite stops for authentic street tacos. Their carne asada is the best, the burritos are a little pricy, but very worth it. Have been to many parties they cater work a taco stand and their service is incredible, very down To earth people!"}
