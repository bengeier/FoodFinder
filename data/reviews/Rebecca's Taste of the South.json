{"text":"Worst Service I have ever had.  Do NOT go there to eat!!!!!! Repeat.. Do not go there to eat!!!  I wish there was an option to give 0 stars, because in my opinion they deserve a BIG FAT ZERO.."}
{"text":"For a new restaurant how can you be out of food? The food took awhile to come, when it came it was hot but without taste. It could have used a bit of seasoning. The Mac and cheese was the best part of the meal. I will not be coming back to this restaurant. They make not be around long!"}
{"text":"Solid experience.  Fried green tomatoes Lemon-herb salmon (potato salad/beans) (Fried okra/Mac& cheese)  The beading for the tomatoes was excellent, and remained crispy fat longer than I expected. The salmon was nicely visited on the edges, while remaining flavorful. The Mac& cheese could have been a little cheesier, but I'm spoiled by the store bought ones. The okra was AMAZING. The beans and cornbread were alright, but combined, they were wonderful.  The potato salad was a bit creamier than I preferred, but this scratched my itch for that home-cooked flavor. Worthwhile."}
{"text":"I tried to call to speak with a manager/owner before I posted this, but was told 'they' were busy.  My question was, busy doing what??!!  Maybe, they're the only 2 cooking?  The location on WT Harris next to Cheddars, has the SLOWEST service I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED IN MY LIFE!!  I have been there about 5-6 times and tried to patronize them, but I will NEVER return there again!  The place is ALWAYS empty...I mean each visit has never had more than 7-8 table occupied during the visit...so, why does it take 55 minutes to deliver a meal?! I MEAN 55 MINUTES!!!  It is absolutely UNEXCEPTABLE SERVICE.  The servers aren't too sharp and will disappear on you for a long period of time.  I had to look for our server several times.   Make note...this restaurant will not be here long.  There is no excuse for receiving a meal as long as it takes them.  ESPECIALLY seeing that there is always JUST a HANDFUL, and I mean a HANDFUL of customers.  I wanted to go back there and cook, that's how long we waited...and if you've been there, you would know I'm NOT exaggerating.  This has been EVERY VISIT.  What are you all doing back there???!!!  The reason why we returned so many times was because the food was tasty and wanted to patronize our people.  But NOW...it's not worth it!  This visit, Saturday, 2/20/16 we decided, while waiting for someone to come and come and come, that was our LAST VISIT to Rebecca's Taste of the South.  And whoever cooked the mac and chez on 2/20, shame on you...it was horrible.  The pasta was WAAAAY overcooked...it usually is nicely cooked and cheezy...the only cheese we tasted was on the top of the ramekin...I couldn't even eat it.  SHAME on you for serving that mess!  The that leg quarter?...Come on, what baby chick did you get that from?  For the price, the portion should be much larger.  I couldn't even share my experience with the hostess as she was somewhere chatting as most of the servers are...instead of checking on their tables and apologizing for the wait!  Good luck, Rebeccas...You need it!  You all need to really assess your environment...you all are helping Cheddars with parking spaces...YOU sure don't need them.  You might want to consider posting signs that the parking is for Rebecca's Taste of the South, just in case people decide to return.  Also, assess why you have so few customers...Really, you couldn't handle more than 3 tables at a time with this SLLOOOOOWW SERVICE!  Hire some cooks to help you out or teach those servers who aren't doing any to come back there and make a salad or something! ...You shouldn't have to wait more than 15 mins for a meal...and I've NEVER received my food in 25 mins or less at Rebecca's...NOT EVEN A SALAD!!!  COME ON!...WHY WOULD IT TAKE LONG TO MAKE A SALAD FOR 2 PEOPLE AND YOU ONLY HAVE 15 CUSTOMERS IN THE RESTAURANT.  WHAT A SHAME.  WE'VE HAD SLOOOOWW SERVICE EVEN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE AFTERNOON WITH 4 CUSTOMERS...THIS MAKES NO SENSE!  I SPENT OVER $100, INCLUDING TIP ON MY LAST VISIT...AND I MEAN MY LAST.  I AGREE WITH DONNA P - DO NOT GO THERE - WARNING YOU....ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE IN A RUSH!  Y'ALL NEED TO GET IT TOGETHER."}
{"text":"No. Please drive away. The food was bland. How do you mess up Mac and cheese??? But call yourself a soul food restaurant ? Nah bro. Nah."}
{"text":"We ordered our dinner over an hour ago and are still waiting. Service is slow. Table beside us, chicken was not thoroughly cooked and food arrived cold. Would definitely not recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"I really wanted to try this place and was disappointed when we arrived and waited nearly 10 minutes to be seated before we gave up and left. The hostess was MIA and we were never seated. It didn't seem that busy either. It was very strange."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible horrible. Don't waste your time. I blame management and the owner. An hour just to get our drinks, water and tea mind you. Then when we went to talk to them about it they told us \"your food is ready but we're not giving it to you. We want you to leave.\" service so horrible and slow one group left complaining and a lady in their group of took her plate because they never bought her a to go box. She literally walked out with her plate. Please don't go here. You will be disappointed. If you try to talk to them about it you will be kicked out. Glad my mom has patience and a kind heart because otherwise they would have ruined her 60th birthday celebration. Just horrible. Oh and she called the police on us. Yeah it happened."}
{"text":"This place was great! The fried chicken as tender and juicy with wonderful flavor! Service was amazing. We will be back!! I recommended others give this place a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Extremely poor service and overall disorganized. Poorly managed and run. We had a large party that was previously booked. We ended up serving ourselves. Several members of our party had to help out the waitstaff by delivering drinks, food and cleaning off tables. My 3 year old niece never received her plate.   In addition the food was mediocre at best. Fish was dry, macaroni and cheese was bland and the cornbread was dry. When I asked for salad dressing for my salad I was told that they had to bring every single plate out first before they could bring out dressing. Over an 1.5 hours later, they...sorry I mean WE are still bringing out food.   I would NOT recommend this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"We were here for a private function on Saturday, birthday party, as the restaurant is only open for lunch. So no one else was in the place. We had a preordered menu, given with our rsvp to the person paying for the event (uncle). Salads came out, waited at least 45 min for entrees. The sides mysteriously changed (unknown to my uncle) so everyone got the same sides. The chicken was overcooked, the collards were tough and flavorless, bread came out at the end of the meal. I could have forgiven all this, however, I had to jump through hoops to get my three year old some food. I ordered a child's plate with rsvp. Half of the room had been served, including my table, and I stopped a server and asked for his plate, And was told she would get it, as he was complaining. Waited 10 min and asked again, and told her to only bring the fries. Asked again in 10 min, as most were done eating, where his fries were. A server said it was ready, only to be interrupted by  another server and told he didn't have a plate because only two child's plates were ordered/ cooked and they were given to other children. I offered to pay for the fries. 5 min later, NO FOOD. I went to my car and found some cheese crackers and he ate that. My uncle complained, as he did order his food, as well as they were refusing to let people take their food home (this was not a buffet) or give him several orders of food to go that was already paid for as several people didn't show up. hostess was found in the back stuffing her face (after she refused my son food). Finally his plate mysteriously appeared on the table, only to be cold, hard and inedible. The only thing good about this place was the tea, which they never refilled, ran out of, and servers disappeared. Got water ourselves. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I have been here three times.  Each time I took a different friend with me to share in my experience because I am a true foodie.  Well this last time, I was utterly embarrassed.  I ordered the chicken and waffles.  The chicken was not to my satisfaction so I asked to order a piece of fish to go with my waffle and I planned to take the chicken home to my son because he will eat anything.  The waitress said I was not able to order a piece of fish because they cannot charge me for a single piece of fish it would need to be a whole meal.  I politely asked to speak to the manager to discuss my dissatisfaction with their policy.  The owner comes and as I am telling him about the situation; he proceeds to tell me they are a new restaurant and their POS system is not able to charge for a piece of fish but they were getting a new one in a few weeks.  I said that is unfortunate because I have come here a few times and I have also referred others to your business, but at this time he has lost a customer.  He was very rude and said \"He can't please everybody and he hopes I find a restaurant I like.\"  Oh yeah, did I mention that I had a gnat in my water! Anyway, as we were talking,  I didn't notice the waitress took my plate.  I asked her what she did with it because I intended to take the food that I just paid for home.  She said let me check.  I waited 21 minutes while she was back and forth in the kitchen and continued waiting tables, avoiding my area.  I finally asked her for an update and she said, \"The owner is not making you more chicken, he didn't come to tell you?\"  The owner then comes to my table as if he didn't know what I needed.  I said, I am waiting for the chicken I paid for or a refund.  He opens his wallet and gave me $8 of my $14.61 bill, snatches the receipt before I could even sign or add a tip for the waitress, who did her part as she isn't a decision maker, then he says, \"There is your chicken now leave.\"  I was speechless as was my coworker.  I will NEVER eat here again.  As the owner, he should have and could had a better attitude and also could have made an executive decision to comp a substitute piece of fish for an unsatisfied customer as opposed to losing one, especially since I didn't even eat a whole wing and had 3 more.  I had no problem paying for my food, I was even willing to pay for a substitute in addition to my bill.  Poor Rebecca's.  I am sure you won't be around long unless you get rid of the gnats and take Restaurant Ownership 101 over again.  Owners who can't run a restaurant should hire an effective GM to do so."}
{"text":"Food was subpar and a complete waste of my money. You see cars in the parking lot but don't be fooled. Those cars belong to people walking over to Cheddar's and so should you!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Rebecca's.  I ordered the Shrimp po boy and it was all bread and barely any shrimp. It was super dry and the wait was long for such a simple meal. I'd try again just a different selection."}
{"text":"I wish there was a no star option. I've heard the good is good at this place but after my family and I sat down and waited for an hour with no food, I'll never find out.   1) there was hardly anyone there tonight that we could tell  2) our waiter greeted us maybe 10 minutes after we sat and took our drink orders - he promptly returned with our drinks and took our food order  3) 45 minutes later no one has stopped by to give us an update - trays of food keep coming from the kitchen and being delivered to a hidden party - we couldn't see anyone... we felt completely neglected   I finally stopped someone and he said he would check on our order - he came back and said that our waiter left because his shift ended and that our food would be up next, I asked how long and he said he didn't know.   We waited 5 more minutes and made it a Bo'jangles night.   Absolutely disappointed and frustrated with the waste of time. Wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Yummy food and friendly service. I like the fried chicken, ribs, and sides. I really like they way they don't over season their food, unlike most soul food places."}
{"text":"Ate there once! Food was prepared fresh, served hot, waiter staff was cordial, price was right, & will be returning!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible service! Terrible terrible terrible everything! Just don't even waste your time or money...."}
{"text":"I had lunch today. I had the fish and chips, which is fried flounder. Instead of fries I had the steamed cabbage. The fish was fried to crispy gold perfection!! Rebecca's daughter came by our table to Thank us for coming by. I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I desperately want to see a non chain restaurant make it in this area.  Unfortunately,  we were the only table for most of our time at this restaurant tonight.  One other table finally came in after we got our food, so we weren't the only ones.  We had a really sweet server who did a good job of checking on us an appropriate amount without hovering.  The food was good - I had fried chicken, mac and cheese,  and cabbage;  hubby had chicken philly and mac and cheese.  I just wish the menu was a little more creative.  Overall,  I have to give  Rebecca's an average rating."}
{"text":"Food here is always good. I have tried it a couple of times and never disappointed especially being pescatarian. Only improvement I would give is the service could be a little quicker. Although, the employees are amazing and super sweet they do tend to drag their feet a little. However, not to the point that I wouldn't return! I will always recommend this place"}
{"text":"First visit...atmosphere is fantastic. Ordered fried pork chops w/steamed broccoli and mac & cheese. My pork chop was dry and the mac & cheese was bland. Son had chicken and waffles, no complaints from him. Husband had rack of ribs w/cabbage and mac & cheese, no complaints from him either. Ribs were really tender. The food took quite a while and our waiter changed 3x  but the hostess assisted with drinks and bussing our table. Over-all good experience and will try them again soon."}
{"text":"This place is a total mess!  My family & I sat in that restaurant for an hour. We never received our dinner & the manager did not come to the table when requested.  The disappointment is real with this place.  On the way out of the restaurant there was another party of 5 who had the same experience. I don't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Good service and atmosphere but the cuisine is just not there.  Decided to give Rebecca's Taste of the South a try today and I've always liked Soul Food. Charlotte is fortunate to have several great ones but alas this is not one of them.  It's a very attractive restaurant located in a former Sportsbar and it's got a nice clean feel. The service here is great and between the hostess and our server, we did not lack for anything the whole time we were there.  One point on the atmosphere however as a word of caution. On first glance, each table has a small bowl of what at first glance appears to be nuts or trail mix but it's really dried beans as decoration. Not paying attention, both my wife and I took a bite and found out they were just decorations.  What we had was not what I would call Soul Food. It's been Americanized to the main stream that about the only thing left of the menu that resembles Soul Food is the Collards cooked with Pork. They do have Chicken and Waffles but that dish came out of NY and not the South.  We started with Fried Green Tomatoes which is a favorite.Came out nice big slices that looked great but when we ate them, what we found was green tomatoes cut micro thin in a very thick batter and fried. Green Tomatoes has a natural tartness and there was so little of it in each slice, that all you could taste was the breading.  I ordered the two piece fried chicken, white meat and got a breast and a wing. Last time I checked, a wing was not considered white meat.  The Mustard Potato Salad was good but with a little too much mayonnaise to the point that in was beginning to get runny. Prefer mine with a nice crunchy texture but the flavor balance was good otherwise.    The BBQ beans appeared to be straight out of a can with no distinct flavor other that a heavy molasses.  My wife a bit better experience with a Chicken Cheese steak and Fried Okra but  with the exception of the Fried Okra, not exactly what I would call either Southern or Soul.  Could be a good restaurant because the atmosphere and service is here but the menu and the execution needs a total correction."}
{"text":"Wish I would have checked the reviews before I went. If you have little ones still in a high chair or booster this is NOT the place for your family! All of the tables are raised so any kid sitting in a high chair is unable to reach the table! I had to get up and leave. We literally could not eat there! My daughters xhin barely touched the top of the table! From the reviews it looks like I wasn't missing anything great."}
{"text":"Rule #1 is location. If a Restaurant Location has been three places in the past there is a reason and then deck is already stacked against you. This location has been multiple things. Now is a Soul Food place.   Rule #2 - There were no cars in the parking lot, reason number two to avoid it. If people are not beating in the doors to eat there, then there is a reason. When we got inside there was no one in there either. There were only three people in the entire restaurant with over 10,000 tech employees within 2 miles of this place...empty. Myself and the two guys that I came with.  NOTE: The inside is clean but there was a bucket for a leak in the AC.  Rule #3 - Service - The women who finally got up to seat us from playing with her phone was nice but not \"soul food\" nice.   Rule #4 - Short Menu typically means smart chef....not in this case. The menu is short and that is a good start.   The Sweet Team is way too sweet. The table was sticky and the wood additions to the tops of the booths was not finished. The food took forever and was not warm when it came out.   Chicken & Waffles - This is not a wing dish! It's a chicken tender dish. You need to be able to cut up your tender and eat it with the waffle. So you took a really tasty idea and destroyed it in a few seconds. I can't even wonder what you all were thinking to make it a wing dish? How?  Fried Pork Chops - For $12 you would think they would have been thick cut and juicy except they were not. They were thin and dry and frankly slightly above room temperature.  Collards - They were old and tasteless.  Mac & Cheese - Way too much butter and old as well. The mac was extra soggy.  Corn Bread - You guessed it DRY as all hell.  BBQ Samich - Looked like something from a school lunch menu with it's scooped up meat and boring.  Banana Pudding - Looked like they put some sliced bananas with some pudding from a pudding cup and some whipped cream on it in a brandy glass that is hard to eat out of. Took them 10 minutes to make and just the same, boring!  The entire meal took forever to get to the table and then waitress did the old \"boring worker\" disappearing act the entire time.  So for a lunch there were 3 people in there and 2 guys did take out, that makes 5.  Not only that it's soul food without any soul. It's like a bunch of people told someone to open a soul food restaurant and just read it out of a cook book. It's bad. Not even close to being soul food or good food. Won't be going back. I grew up in Savannah and this is nothing on the soul food meter....NOTHING! Total waste of $20 for a bad lunch."}
{"text":"Good soul food restaurants are hard to come by in Charlotte for some reason but Rebecca's has been holding on. I was pleasantly surprised on how good my meal was. I ordered the herb grilled chicken breast with a side of macaroni and cheese and cabbage. It came with a corn muffin. The chicken breast was juicy and well seasoned not over grilled. The Mac and cheese was baked perfectly, cabbage could've had a little more seasoning but over all the meal was good.  The restaurant was pretty quiet and seemed to be in a space too big for the crowd they usually have but it was a Tuesday night.  I hope they continue in business and market their restaurant more for more business."}
{"text":"Food as delicious pork chops were seasoned very well .., customer service was polite and friendly"}
{"text":"We came in at 7:40 pm on a Saturday night. We were starving and all of the nearby restaurants had long waits. Not here. But as the host was taking us to our seat someone ran out of the kitchen and said \"Why are you seating these people, we are closing.\" The sign on the door said closing was 10pm, but they walked us out at 7:40 on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"the food is okay if you don't mind the wait and terrible service. I would just save your time and money and go somewhere else. really not worth it. the menu is also very limited. there weren't very many people in the restaurant and we still waited quite some time for our waitress to even come take our drink order and even longer for us to get or drinks."}
{"text":"I'm visiting the area, and the hotel staff mentioned over 20 nearby restaurants I could walk to. I looked up a few of them online, and Rebbecca's menu looked the best. I ordered the food to go, and I was happy with everything; Fried Chicken, mac n cheese, cabbage and potatoe salad. I liked it all all, especially the cabbage.   I also picked this restaurant over the others, because it has history behind it. If you go to their website, you can learn a little more about Rebecca. It was an honor to support her hard work, and I hope the local community continues to support family businesses over the big chains when they can.  My only regret is that I couldn't eat it there, I was helped by Lili, and she was very sweet and friendly. She showed me my food when it was ready, to make sure it was to my liking. When I come back to NC, I will stop by again, and dine in. Good soul food."}
{"text":"This place has A LOT of potential.  Went there tonight about 6:30.  There weren't a lot of people there.  We figured it was because it was new.  Service was S L O W.  The menu looked delish but the food was \"meh\".  Might give it another try in a few months.   It looks like a family run business.  I really hope management figures out how to make the service and food better."}
{"text":"There are good things about the restaurant and there are things that could use some improvement.  I will start with the good.  The food was excellent.  I was with a church group that was traveling from NJ to NC and we were looking for some down home cooking and we definitely got it there.  The food was seasoned to perfection and it tasted like it was made with love.  The wait staff was excellent, knowledgeable about the cuisine and were very friendly.  Things that need improvement was the wait time.  We had to wait over an hour for our food and we were a party of ten.  There was another party of 25 before us apart from them there was no one else there.  I am sure if they work on service time that place would be jam packed."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place. A nice soul food place near my house. Lol it is not anything like that. When we arrived, it was obvious our waitress was new which she confirmed by letting us know that it was her first day. We got our drinks then waited at least 15 minutes to get our orders even taken. I wish we had taken that as a sign to not eat here, because the food took even longer to come out we waited almost an hour for our food and was informed that there was only one chef and after a large party they had completely ran out of food. When our food arrived it was underwhelming at best. I ordered BBQ turkey wings, mac & cheese and baked beans and my best friend ordered fried chicken, fried okra and mac & cheese. Her chicken was undercooked and my beans tasted just like bush's baked beans. The mac & cheese was lackluster. Not worth the wait in the slightest. We spoke to the owner and instead of really listening to our complaints, she just made excuses. Did not give us a discount, not even an extra piece of cornbread. Overall if you're in the area and all the other restaurants have a long wait, suck it up and wait at a better restaurant."}
{"text":"Why oh why didn't we read the Yelp reviews first???!!! We were in the area, noticed a new place and thought we would give it a try. We walked in and it was not busy at all. Service was slow and my drink was never refilled the entire time. I had an \"ultimate burger\" and my husband had the fried chicken. Both were just \"meh\". Burger was on par with Hardee's. Bojangles chicken is better. It really didn't taste like much was homemade at all. Dressings and sides were clearly not. Everything lacked seasoning and frankly we were underwhelmed.   I would be seriously surprised if this place is still here in 6 months."}
{"text":"I would give a zero Very few people in the restaurant well reason you can not get your food  We ordered and 35 minutes later still no food -  finally left  They will not make it"}
{"text":"This place is terrible! I ordered the chicken and waffles.. the chicken was just okay, but the waffle was awful. When I attempted to send it back the manager said \"it looks like a waffle to me\" WHAT!!! I never disputed if it looked like a waffle, I just said it was nasty. Would never return"}
{"text":"Awesome southern inspired food. I had fried chicken. Perfectly cooked!  Fried wings, grilled tilapia very good.  Nice environment and friendly staff. A little hard to get here but don't be discouraged. It is worth it."}
{"text":"My family and I came here twice back to back. We had two different experience. Saturday we had a minimal wait still longer than it takes at most restaurants. Food was good hot and fresh. On Sunday (Mother's Day) we came no wait the restaurant was a little bit more full than the day before. We arrived at 2:50pm and food arrived at 4:30pm. The food came and was lukewarm the only thing hot was the Mac and cheese. My mom requested to speak with the manager we were told when they can they will come out when they can. Needless to say we waited another 30 mins before the manager came. The food and concept is good, the service is not great. I would recommend coming on Saturdays before 8pm."}
{"text":"So let me just say that this place has the potential to be something great. Unfortunately it doesn't appear the management/ownership has invested to make that happen. There were 10 of us dining that evening. We had reservations and no problem being seated when we arrived.  A nice young man greeted us and saw us to the table that was prepared for us. Off to a great start.  The same young man took our drink order and then ultimately our food order. He was the only person we saw working there the entire 2+ hours we were there...yes 2+ hours and that wasn't because we didn't have anything else to do but because it took our food more than an hour to come out and when it did it came in waves with at least 10 minutes between each wave.  One person in our party never got her food. I'm not sure that one young man wasn't in the back cooking it himself. He was a one man show helping our large party and the couple of other tables that were there on that Tuesday afternoon.  The food itself was very good.  The sweet tea was excellent. So I'm being generous with my star rating - largely because this young man was amazing! So my hope is that the owners/management will staff appropriately and address the customer experience issues before it's too late. Not everyone will be as patient as we were that night."}
{"text":"Rebecca's is near my neck of the woods but due to reviews I would always pass on them.  However after a year in business, I figured maybe they had worked out kinks- I was wrong. I called to place an order and my first flag should have been someone answering the phone with \"Yeah\". I had to clarify if I had reached a restaurant or someone's personal phone. The person taking my order didn't seem familiar with menu...but eventually my order was placed. My order was wrong when I arrived. The food itself-the only thing good was the wings-this was the most disappointing soul food ever.  I ate only one bite of each side and put in trash."}
{"text":"Gotta admit..was a little worried after reading the intial reviews after we sat down..But to my surprise the food and service were good. The owner even came by the table to take ownership of their past reviews..they have only been open for 4 weeks..we will be back..good food good music..  A birthday lunch"}
{"text":"Tried Rebecca's for lunch on a Friday afternoon, and the place was DEAD.  I figured it was because it was new, so we gave it a shot. First, the menu is very limited.  I still found the ribs, so I ordered that.  One of my companions tried to order shrimp and grits, but apparently it was discontinued...along with 3 other things, making the menu incredibly limited now. For my sides I had a baked potato and the mac and cheese.  The mac and cheese was homemade, but bland, which was a shame because i love homemade.  It needed salt just to put some kind of taste. My ribs came out finally and were OK at best.  They fell off the bone, but that's a sign of over cooking.  I prefer some kind of pull from them.  The sauce seemed to have been added close to the end of the cook cycle or afterwards.  It didn't seem to mesh properly. My friend's chicken was bland and boring, according to her.  Overall, I had hopes for this place.  It is lacking good exposure, advertising, and unfortunately the menu really needs work.   I gave it two stars because the waitress was great and the front staff was very friendly too.  I just do not see what will keep this place from going under soon.  Unfortunately a restaurant needs a strong menu to survive.  This just doesn't have it."}
{"text":"Great clean environment, old school R&B music playing and very good food. Excellency choice for a date place."}
{"text":"I was nervous about coming here because of the one bad review but I was very satisfied with my entire experience. From the beginning everyone was very nice. The food was delicious. One of the managers came over and introduced herself and was very pleasant. The food was good and the sweet tea was delicious. Overall I had a wonderful experience. The atmosphere is very inviting and they have great music!!"}
{"text":"This place did not have much to offer. They ran out of a lot of food so their we're not  many choices to choose from to eat. I left because they had a lack of food that was on the menu. Everything I wanted to eat they didn't have."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time going there!! Slowest service ever. Waited 10 minutes before the waitress came, 10 more minutes for water. Left after 40 minutes and still no food and the restaurant was not even busy....now we know why!"}
{"text":"I wasn't sure about this place, but I figured... what the heck! Man oh man... I was glad I did!   While the food wasn't overly saturated \"southern love\" it was good and fulfilling. But make sure you know what you want because once it's made there's no giving it back (they have a clear warning on their extensive menu). Not to mention, based on what you order the price for two will be about $20-35.   The music was great and the place was huge, so it would accommodate a large group. Plus, the GM Eartha was super nice. For that alone, I would try them again."}
{"text":"Bad place to eat. Staff was very nice. But food was Cold and took longer than an hour. Never again. Don't waste your time or money. Manager wouldn't even come out to speak. Just took it off the tap. No apology for the wait. Also I ordered salmon and they tried to give me cold ass tilapia as salmon. Super sad. This place won't last long here in Charlotte."}
