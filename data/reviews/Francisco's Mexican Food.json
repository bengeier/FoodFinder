{"text":"Just \"ok\" in my opinion! Could drive another mile for filibertos. I spent $9.65 for the #4 with no drink. That's pricey! (2 tacos beans and rice) The restaurant that was here before was at least fair in the pricing! Combo should include a drink or you lower the price ... food is alright.. service is alright. Eh .. pic attached"}
{"text":"High prices, low quality food along with their rude service combines to make Franciso's a complete waste of your time and money. They guy/kid running the window acts like everyone is bothering him and talks down to you. Beware of their $3.50 Chips and Salsa which comes with taco sauce as they do not have actual salsa. $17 for two burritos and chips lacking salsa. Been there twice, first time was bad, second time was worse. Won't be back again. What a waste."}
{"text":"C.A. Fries are delicious. Best chips & guacamole I've had in a while. Great local find, nice service. Many good selections to choose from. Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"My favorite drive thru for Mexican food. Give it a try. The tacos are big and flavorful."}
{"text":"We were hesitant to go here because of the other reviews but....We were really impressed by the food and the portion size. The man who took our order was very nice and polite. The prices did not seem that bad to us. We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This place is very similar to Filibertos. Got the Carne Asada fries which I thought were better than Filibertos! I will probably go here instead from now on."}
{"text":"It used to be Betito's, and before that it was something else, but I hope that these folks stay here because their food is slammin'. We've been here twice now to pick up some breakfast, and both times we were extremely happy. Are those tortillas homemade (I think they are)? The only reason that I dinged one star is because they didn't include our jalape√±os with our last order, and I need to see how they cook 'em before I'll commit to all five stars. Everything else has been top-notch, I just need to see what those peppers do."}
{"text":"Went to the business with Entertainment offer on my phone and the boy just acted like he didn't know what is going on.  I have shown him the offer on my app which had the offer of two for one Burrito with the purchase and redemption of the offer.  He gave the coupon to his sister while having kids running in the back of the kitchen and say that they couldn't contact the owner so the offer had to be refused.  This is none sense.  I have reported you to the Entertainment Corporation for your bait and switch business practice.  You also have other locations in the valley..Is that the treatment that you give at any one of these locations?  I would like to know."}
