{"text":"The food is fantastic. The decor is dated, an understatement, but has charm in how old it is. The service was friendly and well-paced. Several of us had the chicken and dumplings soup, which was excellent. The dumplings had to be homemade. The chili dog was just outstanding. I've enjoyed quite a few from different places, and this chili dog is really good - the chili is just right for a hot dog, meat and beans seasoned nicely. The chocolate milkshake, handmade was terrific too. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Basic fare. 
Friendly atmosphere
The place could use a refresh / remodel. Maybe some new carpet or hardwood floor?"}
{"text":"Average food, average service. I had breakfast. Just wanted eggs and toast. The breakfast special comes with eggs, toast and potatoes. Did not want the potatoes, but they will not take any money off if you don't order the potatoes. so you will pay for the potatoes whether you take them or not. I was not told that. So I get charged for potatoes even though they didn't give me any. I did want an extra egg and a slice of toast which they charge me a whole  breakfast price for. Beware, just stick to the menu."}
{"text":"First time here. We had breakfast which is served all day. Food was very good and as ordered. Waitress said it was her 1st day and she was very nice and attentive. Decor is a a mish-mosh of stuff, kinda old diner style. Will be back."}
{"text":"First time here. It's like going to grandmas. Old fashioned but good food! Had the stuffed peppers and it was delicious. Service was good. Only reason I didn't give a 5 star is I think they use salad fresh as the salad had a funny taste."}
{"text":"Nothing better than perfectly cooked over easy eggs, perfectly browned hash browns & crispy bacon every single time! I have to disagree about remodeling needed, I think it almost has that vintage feel inside which is perfect for that type of diner. Also you can't beat the prices either! I can't say enough good things about this place & our family will definitely be loyal customers."}
{"text":"This is an old style greasy spoon diner.  The restaurant doesn't look like its been updated since they added push buttons to pay phones!  The d√©cor is right out of 1971 with red vinyl table cloths.  It might be worth the experience to see this place, but I think I'll pass on coming back.  Their are plenty of other places that are better for the buck."}
{"text":"Great old time recipes, old building, but it adds to the charm. Stuff cabbage is exactly my family's."}
{"text":"How has this place not been reviewed yet?!  Its been there FOREVER and its called the frickin WHIP!  Family owned mom-and-pop home cookin.  Chicken paprikash, salsbury steak..you know the drill.  Guess it deosnt have a d-bag celebrity chef or hasnt been on Food Network yet.  Check it out anyway.  They dont serve booze so get hammered first!"}
{"text":"BRAVO! .. they have certainly cleaned up their act .. the patch repair on the ceiling could use a bit more touching up but overall a huge improvement .. great work! .. now I am back to enjoying their food as I always did .. tip:  their home made chicken + dumpling soup served on Wednesdays is not to be missed!"}
{"text":"Took the family to The Whip this evening for din din.  We were seated immediately as the place wasn't full.  I was expecting a long-standing establishment such as this to be busy on a Friday night.  Our waitress was friendly and she quickly took our drink orders.  I ordered a root beer and liver and onions for dinner, which came with a salad.  Actually, I let my daughter order for me, and she chose liver and onions.  It was pretty good...all liver tasting and such.  I haven't had liver and onions since I was a kid, but it appeared to have been cooked well.  It was a thin slice, I'll bet, because liver has a strong iron flavor.  I finished it, but I probably won't let my daughter order liver and onions for me anywhere again.  I'm hoping I got some kind of health benefit from it.  I got a side of mashed potatoes, which came with gravy too.  They were tasty.

No beer - bummer.  The side salads could use a little sprucing up too. We sat next to the pay phone, which not only works, but they use it.  There were at least two incoming calls while we were there that the waitress took while leaning over our booth.  Interesting, but not unusual in a 76-year stronghold.

My family said their food was good.  The meal went pretty quick, which was nice because we wanted to get home for the Cavs game!  I'll be back to taste the pierogies."}
{"text":"Came here last night for a late dinner with my husband. I was a bit confused because on google it keeps coming up as a coffee shop. We were seated instantly as it was not crowded. While it might deter some, I really liked the vintage look inside. I had a French dip and my husband got the hot roast beef sandwich. My French dip was ok but just didn't have a lot of flavor and came with crinkle fries which I am not a huge fan of. My husband's looked great though and he said it was good. I will say our waitress and the staff were nice and very attentive. The price was not bad at all. I would think about giving it another chance."}
{"text":"The diner is cute on the inside.  Very charming.  Staff nice and helpful. 
The food is subpar."}
{"text":"Just visited with my kids.  It's been a few years since the last time.  I remember it being outdated and needing some cleaning back then.  Still true.  Ceiling is peeling in places, decor is decades old and tired.

They have their loyal clientele, and on a weekday evening, they had a few tables going.  I guess that's why they aren't motivated to clean and remodel.  Business is going \"well enough\" I think.

I don't want you to think it was disgusting.  More like - cobwebs in corners and dust on window sills and blinds.

Service was friendly.  Value was good.  Kids meals are more than fair in quality and price.  My hot sandwich was very good.

I'd love to see them remodel and pack the place out.  It's a nice location and has old school charm from the outside.  I even think the 1950s wood paneling on the inside has a coziness.  We gotta do something about all the vinyl overload.  I'm not talking LPs.  Walls, booths, blinds, and table covers."}
