{"text":"Herd so many good thing's about this place ,and that they had lots of celiac options. The place looks nice ,and when you arrive and look to your right you see a giant menu. At the bottom of the menu is says \"all items can be made gluten free\". Holy hell was I so excited to see this . 
My husband says he would like a gluten free poutine the lady who was not taking our order but another lady says \"there is no such thing\" . Alright then he was hoping we could share . I was confused since they advertise that everything can be done gluten free on the menu in giant letters. Then I ask if they have gluten free buns for smokies the one girl says yes . Then we start ringing it in , the girl who said \"no such thing\" then says they do not have gluten free hotdog buns . They will put it on a burger bun . At this point there are people behind me so I just say fine .  When we get our food the smokie is nothing special . I could have bought a better one from the grocery store and there was just so much bun I didn't finish the thing . Things to take away from this . Train your staff better . Make sure your staff actually knows your inventory , maybe have a management member on at night to handle staff. So they don't come off as rude . Also don't say everything on the menu can be gluten free if that's not true . There are better places to get burgers I won't be coming back ."}
{"text":"Have driven by this place several times and finally decided to give it a try.  Got a hamburger with cheese, clive style toppings with jalapenos and onion.  Quite honestly I've had better burgers, was expecting a juicy burger but the patty was thin and well blah.  Did order fries though and must admit it was the best part of the meal.  Also ordered a chocolate milkshake, it was good but not good enough to be $5 bucks."}
{"text":"The serving of fries was huge, so we split the large into 3. Even split, each serving was more than enough for the price. It came with ketchup and the clive sauce. 

So if you're there with some friends, split the large instead of ordering a small each."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of this place. There was a couple times where they forgot to put on all the toppings but it's always delicious. Turns out you don't need almost all the extras for a great burger and I always get extra Clivesauce."}
{"text":"Quality burgers and fries that taste fresh. Love the Clive sauce.

The outdoor seating is nice in the summer."}
{"text":"A very good burger.  Went there twice over the summer and it was good both times.  Very good service and they can serve beer which is a very nice bonus.  Nothing beats a good burger with a great cold beer.  A nice addition to the 17th Ave. eating scene."}
{"text":"I had a hamburger with cheese, mayo, onion, tomato, and pickle with a milkshake. I like this place. The milkshake was awesome! The burger was  oily, it is a delicious burger but it was dripping. I have been here twice and had the same problem before. It's worth a try though the meat was yummy!"}
{"text":"The burger was great, but the fries were the best I have ever had. Had so many left over, put them in the oven and ate them the next day. And that was a small order. The spicy mayo sauce on the side was not only an added surprise, but was very tasty as well. I will be going back to Cliveburger the next time I am in Calgary, no doubt about it! Their environmentally friendly packaging seals the deal. Go to Cliveburger. I think you will be glad you did."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Clive Burger as we'd heard it was very good. We ordered two burgers with cheese, various toppings as they have a nice choice and they're free, a small order of fries and two milkshakes - a vanilla and a coffee one.  The burger was very good and just the right size -not huge and not small.  The milkshakes were different from others but also quite good. Now the fries.......the small size is more than enough for two people to share. We were disappointed in them, though.  Yes, they are fried in peanut oil which makes them crispy but about 3/4 of ours were way too crispy to eat!  Too crunchy. When we'd come across one that was soft enough, it was very good. Not a fan, though, so probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Nope.

This place is really great to look at. Decor is nice and they have the right idea, but the service is awful and the food is just covered in sauce.

Do not like this place."}
{"text":"Burgers are really good. Love the Clive sauce. If you want mustard on your burger, ask for a little as they tend to have a heavy hand for it. 

Milkshakes: Have not tried it yet, but have heard only great things about them.

Fries: mixed review. I enjoy them, especially with the Clive sauce. BF could care less about them, doesn't like how they taste."}
{"text":"The burgers here are amazing.  Moist and flavourful, it's defintely a hearty meal.

The fries are great too.  You can tell the difference that frying them in peanut oil makes.  It's also a large portion (about a paper bag's worth) and I can never finish one by myself.  It's worthwhile getting if you have a friend to share with, but I really wish they had a smaller portion size for those who wish to pair some fries with one of their burgers.

They have hot dogs here too, but they pale in comparison with the burgers.  They have gluten free options here too, but I've found that those buns are a bit dry.

Free wifi and some power outlets make it a great place to work over lunch, and they do serve some beer and wine here too.

A great burger joint that was sorely needed at that location.  If you're a burger fan, you owe it to yourself to check this place out."}
{"text":"yum yum yum...they call me the burger connoisseur. It's about time 17th Ave had a gourmet burger joint. Wendy's was just not cutting it anymore. Finally, good beef made fast! I usually order a single burger with cheese with fries...beware they give you a ton of fries! you can share an order. The place is clean and the price is reasonable. I think they may be one of the best burger joints around...and i'm sure other yelpers will agree."}
{"text":"Awesome Awesome Awesome! Love the Boozy shakes and the burgers, the regular size fries are enough to share with about 3 people. Great spot!"}
{"text":"This place makes me think \"meh\". I live just off of 17th so I see this place on my way home every day and I've always been wanting to try it. So I went in this Saturday and just wasn't impressed at all. Maybe all the hype this place used to get made me expect better, but I mean... its nothing special. The vibe of the place is alright, but the food is nothing spectacular. Definitely not worth the price, so I think its safe to say its overpriced. Customer service could also be better. In general, this place was kind of a huge let down."}
{"text":"This is my first and possibly only yelp review. I went to clive burger on December 29th. 5 people, including myself, ate meat products there and 4 suffered food poisoning, including one friend who was admitted to the emergency room. This was the only place where all of us ate."}
{"text":"I'm not usually one to eat burgers, but I had to try out this new spot...mostly because its Model Milk's chef who's involved. 
Its been nicely renovated. Very casual, yet clean, and you can see the staff cooking up your order.
I had a plain burger, and split the fries with a friend since it was a huge portion...HUGE. They are cooked in peanut oil, and were salty, crispy, fresh and delicious. There are tons of options for toppings on the burger, I had mine with onion and mushrooms. My friend chose them all...I dont recommend doing that...it turned into a gigantic mess, and required a dozen napkins to clean up.
The burger itself is not overly huge, and the bun is on the thinner side...but it was the perfect portion size for me. 
Im a fan of the fact that the meat is homone/antibiotic free, and they serve everthing 
in compostable packaging. 
The BEST part of the entire experience, was that hours later, I wasnt regretting eating the burger. Nope, no evil stomach pain from the meat, since its healthy and not served in a portion size for a football team. 
There are also gluten free and vegetarian options. 
Next time, Im going to try a custard milkshake...."}
{"text":"I'm not going to say the food isn't tasty... however, three of my coworkers (plus myself) have all had TERRIBLE experiences after eating here, namely food poisoning. I don't know what's wrong here, but I HIGHLY recommend you think twice before eating here!"}
{"text":"This joint is based on the less-is-more philosophy, and in general it works.  For example, the burger itself is quite plain, but made with good quality beef.  The bun has a good give and light flavour that doesn't interfere with what's inside.  The star is the Clive Sauce: a tangy, somewhat spicy mayo-based concoction that I need to try to replicate at home now.  

Ordering \"clive style\" does not get you the works, so be warned and do your homework!  A wide selection of toppings are free, including mushrooms.  These toppings are a little sparse, so if you really like something, ask for double.  If you want fries, a drink and a loaded burger, expect to pay up to $20. I'd rank this in the 85 percentile of burgers I've had, and of course they are cooked as-ordered (though slightly disappointingly, not to-order: I'd prefer mine about medium). 

The only real disappointment was the vanilla custard shake (chosen at the recommendation of the cashier), which while passable was not the unctuous epiphany of frostiness I was hoping for, given their focus on a less-is-more menu."}
{"text":"This is one of my go to places. The Burgers are excellent, but its the fries that keep me coming back. They fry them in peanut oil (allergy alert for some of you) which makes them so delicious and crispy. **Warning, Science Moment: Peanut oil is great for frying because it has a high smoke point, is low in saturated fat, and is high in polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fat. This means that the carbon atoms don't have as many hydrogen atoms attached to them, so they.... Ok I'm told this is boring...

Anyways... I love this place. The fries are awesome. And that Clive Sauce. I have recurring dreams about it. They will always give you extra sauce if you ask them, and you can take it home and keep the magic going on other exciting sandwiches!

Take your Mom, take your Dad
take your girlfriend if she isn't too sad
Take your dog, take your cat
take your brother if he isn't too fat
Wear some shoes, cover your feet
Lose your socks after trying that Meat"}
{"text":"Cute, trendy, laid back burger place on 17th ave. Fun and friendly staff. Choose your toppings and they put in on a burger for you, simple. I went out of my way to make a review of this place based on one thing alone: their veggie burger. AMAZING. Goes well with their clive sauce. I haven't been a vegetarian in about a year now, but I'll never order anything else from this place. I just love the veggie burger too much."}
{"text":"Love eating here. My burger ritual is serious: cheesburger with swiss, lettuce, tomato, pickle, ketchup and a side of fries with a coffee shake. The kitchen guys are entertaining to watch and the atmosphere is great. Once my burger arrives I tie back my hair, roll up my sleeves and dig in. A perfect, delicious mess every time."}
{"text":"Been coming here for quite a while and I am always excited to eat one of their veggie burgers. I love the seating arrangement which is quite relaxed and it doesn't take too long for them to get your order ready. Only problem I have with this place is that getting a veggie burger is pretty expensive (I believe they add 2 dollars), and with a single burger already being $7 without cheese it can get pretty expensive, especially since I usually am only satisfied with the double burger. 

Overall, really like this place and would recommend to anyone looking for a tasty, quick burger and fries."}
{"text":"Great burgers! Everything you order here is quality. Clive Burger is also environmentally conscious, as all the garbage is recyclable. The style of the restaurant really enhances the experience. Although there are better tasting burgers out there, Clive Burgers won't make you puke later ;) 

I recommend this burger joint!"}
{"text":"We stopped in at Clive Burger on Friday night. It was the very cool sign that got our attention as we were just walking by. It looks cool - I love all their wall murals.

Great to have a quick food option along 17th. Loved the decor and that they serve beer / wine with their burgers. Pirce was pretty good and they fellow at the cash told us all about the quality of their beef and loved that they had we could cusomize our burgers. We had a couple of burgers, shared a small fries & drinks. They had great pickles and the people watching was extraordinary.

However, couple things... seems really funny that when eating in, our foot comes in a big paper bag filled with napkins when there are also napkins on the table and we were given a bunch of dips for our fries that we didn't ask for or really want. It seems like a contraction to their whole environmental/conservation/compostable message we saw printed on the napkins and burger wrappers.

Everything in the restaurant needed a good cleaning. I realize it was Friday night, but the floor in the upper seating area was really dirty (floors, tables, benches). Bathroom could also use a good clean. The good news is that with an open kitchen concept, it looked pretty clean.

Food was average... akin to fast food, but with better toppings (did I mention the pickles were good). Small fries were soggy and definately enough for 2 people contrary to what we were told.

If we were walking along 17th and dying for a burger, I might pop in as an alterative to chain fast food, but not sure I would seek this place out for a burger."}
{"text":"Stopped by Clive Burger around 1:30 am this morning and chowed down on a veggie burger and a small fries.  Clive's veggie burger is way better than most of the other late-night vegetarian choices (Tubby Dog, which was so bad it had my friend and I in a fit of laughter, and The Big Cheese, which is just average), and the meat burgers got rave reviews from my friends.  Apparently the milkshake was awesome- described as \"better than Peter's\" (now if only it too came in like, one million flavors).  The fries were interesting... I ordered a small and it was definitely big enough to share.  The word I would use to describe the fries is \"dense\"- it must be something about the peanut oil that, while making them perfectly crispy, also made them just a little bit heavy.  I would order them again, but I'd want to share the small order between three or four friends.  The only disappointing thing, in my opinion, was the behavior of one of the girls at the cash register.  She was ALL OVER a guy in front of us in line, which held up ordering for a really, really, really long time.  They swapped numbers, Facebook contact info, you name it... all while my alcohol-filled tummy rumbled.  I'm pretty sure that's what Craigslist's Missed Connections is for, honey!"}
{"text":"Veggie burger isn't vegan despite what the staff will tell you. Great fries though."}
{"text":"Beside Corbeaux Bakehouse, Clive Burger is a great place to sit down with a friend or two for a great burger and a custard shake.

AMBIENCE/SERVICE: Over-the-counter/fast-food style ordering and a good amount of interior seating. Drinks and beers were on display as well as a giant menu on the wall beside where a long queue will inevitably start. Open kitchen and everything is made to order. 2/2.5

FOOD: Had a double ($9.50) with lettuce, tomato, clive sauce, ketchup, and fried mushrooms ($1). It was a juicy burger with fresh ingredients and the clive sauce is amazing. They also serve these cool sodas (made with cane sugar iirc?) and custard shakes ($5) which I can't wait to try next time. 2/2.5"}
{"text":"Went to Clive Burger on a whim with a co-worker of mine. It was in the middle of stampede hell week.  The staff were friendly and attentive and explained to us how and what to do to order. I had a milkshake and he had some sort of pop. The burgers were good, but a little small for the amount of money I paid. Needless to say the food was awesome and so was the service. the only reason they are loosing a star is the pricing. will be back though"}
{"text":"Best Burger Spot in Calgary hands down!"}
{"text":"The burgers are really tasty but the meat is only half the size of the bun which made the experience disappointing. I hope they can improve since the group I was with all noticed it and you are expecting an amazing burger when you wait 20 mins."}
{"text":"Note: I've updated this review. As I live in the neighbourhood, I go to Clive all the time because their burgers are fantastic. But at least one out of ten times at Clive I'm treated quite rudely -- unapologetic staff who don't want to provide service (or an explanation), an inability to fulfill orders (and poor communication), etc. So despite my endless support of the business (because they have good food), I'm not going to return. I'm just super fed up with feeling like someone doesn't want to take my order or is just annoyed at my existence. I like to give a balanced review, so I'll say again -- their burgers are fantastic. But I'm done giving them my business. 

Previous review:

First off, I should point out -- I go to Clive all the time.  For fast(ish) food they have the freshest, most delicious burgers and ingredients you can find in this city.  But I'm writing this review because I've been finding it frustratingly inconsistent as of late.  Last time I attended (last week), the burger was charred (literally black, no way the cook didn't look at it and go \"sheeeeiiiit that would be hard to eat\").  This time -- I ordered a poutine.... once my order was ready (15 minutes later), they told me \"oh, we're out of gravy, are you alright with a small fry?\".  I thought about my answer.... could I have responded \"no?\".  That would be silly.... they're out of gravy, what could they do?

Well, they could walk eight feet and tell the person at the till they are out of gravy and shouldnt sell any poutine.  But they didn't do that.  And they could have said -- \"hey, since you paid for a poutine and we can't deliver, here's a coupon for your next time.\"  But they didn't do that.  Instead, they only offered to give me something worth less than what I paid for.  I felt silly having tipped in advance.

In summation -- please consider Clive.  They are a great alternative to fast food -- sure, you wait a little longer and pay a touch more, but their product is significantly better, because they use better shit.  Buuuuut..... they don't always seem to care about quality or their customers.  I hope that doesn't affect them negatively in the long run, because Calgary deserves more independent, quality food service establishments."}
{"text":"Good food but bad organization with orders...waited over 30 mins for my order due to buzz device not going off and oder should have been remade right away not keeping a customer waiting....finally got my order and they still forgot the topping i wanted.  complete FAIL ON MY FIRST EXPERIENCE!!!!!!"}
{"text":"welcoming interior atmosphere, expensive magazines, decent beers on tap, and even has healthy hippy soda pops, = nice marketing tactics..........
but.......
YAWN.......BORING burger......
fries were yawn-alicious as well........
save the money from your potential future visits and buy a baby Weber grill from Home Depot and cook your own at home........ 
and keep the stoner cook away from the grill.......my burger was so black and dry I could draw a graphite still life with the charred burger itself........ 
Generic Heinz Ketchup, Mustard & Relish you can buy at Safeway........nothing unique about blowing $10 here.......if your drunk and looking for filler.....eat a box of crayons instead"}
{"text":"Well this is legitimately my first online review of any kind, but my experience has been so horrendous, it must be done.

Trip 1 - I arrived about 30 mins after opening and ordered a burger and fries. I have a high gluten intolerance so I ordered the gluten free bun with my burger. I was there on my lunch break and had about 40 minutes to get in and out to make it back to work. I ordered it to go so I could eat at work. My burger was completed before my fries were even started. When they dropped my fries in the oil, it was realized the fryer wasn't turned on. No one said anything to me but as my burger was sitting on the counter and I was the only customer, it was pretty clear what was going on when 3 people huddled around the fryer for about 10 minutes to get it going. No one seemed to know what was going on or even seemed to really care. As I watched my fries be \"test-dunked\" in the oil about 12-15 times as it was heating up, they just said \"do you want your burger now?\". I proceeded to eat my burger which was delicious besides the gluten free bin which was among the worst I've ever had. Extremely dry and crumbly, 1/5 on the bun. They then gave me the same fries that were dunked in the oil a billion times!!!! They were, as expected extremely oily and the 2nd half was inedible. On the way out someone gave me a stamp card for a free burger, which is the only reason why there was a trip 2.

Trip 2 - Arrived about 45 minutes before close to find a cardboard sign saying \"closed at 9:30\". (I could be off on the correct wording of the sign.

Trip 3 - This is a good time to mention the menu says all of their menu items can be made gluten free. I ordered a burger with a gluten free poutine. I asked the cashier if the gravy was gluten free and he said \"yes I think so, it's beef gravy but it is gluten free.\" I paid and said to the cashier \"not that I don't trust you, but can you please check on the gravy, I'll be quite sick if you are wrong\". He said no problem and went to check. Another employee came up to me and said \"we are out of gluten free buns, do you want a lettuce wrap?\" My reply was no, what about the poutine? Her reply was \"the gravy isn't gluten free\". I was insanely frustrated at this point and just asked for my money back. They gave me another stamp card and my poutine money back and muttered \"sorry\" at my back on the way out. 

Absolutely terrible, I honestly want to give the card away, but not really no anyone I truly care for. Makes me more sad than anything."}
{"text":"I read the Avenue magazine review which was glowing so decided to take my sweetie down and check it out.  I ordered a burger with all the fixings plus sauerkraut.  Well when we finally got our burgers I was hugely disappointed!  The tiny dollop of sauerkraut was about the size of a quarter!  The rest of the fixings were disappointing too.  The meat was ok, but McDonald's Angus burger fully loaded is way better and much cheaper.  The fries were almost cold as well.  They may have been good once upon a time, but not anymore.  Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"My standard go to for a good burger. Must get Clive sauce for the real experience. Thanks for keeping it consistently tasty, Clive Burger!"}
{"text":"Custom made burgers in the heart of 17th? Seems like a fantastic idea. 

While it was not the best burger I've had, it was still satisfying. The menu is really simple, choose how many patties, cheese, then your toppings and you're good to go. 
Fries come in a pretty good portion, and are a little on the too salty side for my taste.

They have Village Brewery's Blonde on tap, which is great since it is a good beer, as well as a Calgarian micro-brewery. (helps wash down the salty fries)

A little over-priced, but I'd recommend to check it out at least once."}
{"text":"the near immediate food poisoning i got after eating a burger here was the worst internal hell i have ever experienced. We got our food to go and ate in pretty dim lighting while watching a movie at home. after a coupe bites i thought it was kinda gross, but it had been transported for 15 mins so i thought it was just a little soggy. I finally got to a bite near the middle i could tell wasnt right, turned on the light to discover it was completely raw in the middle. My hopes that consuming a small amount of raw ground beef wouldnt hurt were what i went to bed with 20 mins later, violent puking and stomach cramps followed by a steady flow of painful diarrhea were what i woke up to, and would wake up to another 7 times before morning. I spent the following day going from toilet to floor to toilet to shower to bed to toilet praying to a god i dont believe in  to take me now but to also let me not die in a puddle of my own excrement. Around 5pm the symptoms started to subside and i tried to sip some water, this was immediately rejected by the devil inside me. at 8 pm i tried again, at which point either my symptoms were subsiding... or i was so dehydrated my body absorbed it before it made it to my stomach. I was weak and immobile for another 16 hrs and around noon on Jan 1st i nibbled a cracker and realized the storm was finally ending... oh I forgot to mention this is a hella late review and this all started Dec 30th and i completely missed my trip to banff for new years.... so ya, happy 2018 Clive Burger, maybe hire a certified chef or trained cook instead of a bunch of teens who could care less if they serve quality food."}
{"text":"As soon as you walk in, you are greeted by the staff. They make their 1/4 lb burgers to order and you have you choice of delicious toppings. I had the one with cheddar cheese Clive Sauce, Ketchup, Relish, Mustard/Hot, Mayo, Pickle, Lettuce, Tomato, Onion, and Jalapeno. It was delicious, but much greasiest than expected. I also ordered a small French fries. Their small is enough for two people to share with their burgers. Their shakes are delicious and you can combine two flavors if you please. They should have larger straws available because it was hard to drink a thick shake with a medium straw. Great atmosphere! The mirror at the back really made a it feel open."}
{"text":"The only burger place I've been to with jalapeño toppings!

Pros: 
- The topping selection was unique and the jalapeno's were just perfect!
- The staff is friendly and the location is trendy.
- The $4 order of fries is enough to feed a family! haha Come to think of it, Peter's Drive In doesn't even have this many fries in a large order from them; I couldn't even eat half. Its a lot of food. If you love fries and I know many people do, you can expect great fries at a bargain price.

Cons:
- I was a little disappointed with the size of the patties. Although some may disagree, what do you expect for a $9 double burger? I expected bigger patties. 

I tried their unique take on the classic shake - their Custard Shake. It's said to have more dairy than the traditional milk shake but tastes a whole lot richer. I opted to stick with my burger & fries and got a drink elsewhere.

Although I miss the fiasco gelato that was there before on these hot summer days, its always a treat to have a good burger joint close by now.

Clive Burger was good, but not the best burger I've had in Calgary."}
{"text":"The way they handled a mishap the last time I was here is what has warranted the two stars for my review.

We lucked out by getting here just before it started to get lined up, ordered our milkshake, two burgers and fries and waited. And waited. And waited as everyone else behind us got their orders. I went to check on our order and informed the cashier that it'd been 20 mins and we still hadn't gotten our food. She went to \"go check\" and came back with \"It'll be right out\". I asked if our order had been misplaced or forgotten and all she responded with \"I dunno\" and shoulder shrug - ARGHHHHHHHH! 

Another 5 mins passed before our food came out, and at this point I was beyond hAngry. No apology as our food was handed over, just silence and averting of eyes. 

I probably would have enjoyed my food better if I wasn't so mad. I would like to give this place another chance but it probably won't be for a while."}
{"text":"We tried Clive Burger because most of the reviews were good- Not sure what happened the night we went? Customer service was terrible, slow and incompetent cashier, snarky manager with no apologies for distasteful music, NOT family friendly unless you like to hear the f bomb dropped a lot (by staff), burger..... What burger.... Reminded me of a frozen flat patty I could have gotten at McDonalds- Ugh! Where's the beef?"}
{"text":"Fried egg option on a burger... delicious! Clive burger is good for what it is, fast food burger but with great ingredients. The Cherry milkshake is also a must try."}
{"text":"Burgers were small...so small they look like larger sliders.  Not worth the money."}
{"text":"Village beer on tap, boozy milkshakes, tasty burgers and super cute wall art? Sounds like my kind of burger joint.

First of all, I love that this is a chilled out spot where you can grab a drink and have a conversation on 17th Ave. Especially since they have some good local beer on tap (currently Village Blonde and Village Triplet for $8).

The burger: I opted for the hamburger (single, $7), a bunch of their included options like the clive sauce, hot sauce, pickles, tomato and lettuce, and a few added extras - mushroom ($1) and bacon ($2). The burger was pretty tasty and I loved the soft bun. My main comment is that the burger patty and bacon were warm, but the rest of the burger was on the cold side, including the mushrooms.

The service was pretty good overall (a mix of good and pretty good depending on which time I went up to the counter), and the burger only took about ten minutes before they called out my name. 

Did I mention that the wall art is super cute? It's all cartoon style with their burger and hot dog characters. Definitely worth a good five minutes to check out while you're waiting for your tasty burger. And sipping on your beer."}
{"text":"Tasty burgers and long crispy fries with an irresistible spicy House sauce. Whenever you go to clove burger you have to order the custard shake it's unreal."}
{"text":"5 stars for the burger. I love the burger. Why does it have to be so good? I can't stop thinking about the deliciousness that is Clive. This place makes me so happy! I love the design inside, I love their store design (Come on! the little happy burger on the bag?) and I like that it's casual and chic at the same time.  Great place for a date or just to go for a bite with a friend. 

Perfectly portioned burger, the beef patty is so damn good and speaks for itself. Delish. And!!! they serve village brewery on tap. A blonde and a burger? Hell yes. 

Have to say, I don't like the fries at all. But I wouldn't want to waste precious gut space on fries when the burger is where it's at."}
{"text":"Veggie Burger was pretty good. Didn't have to wait very long for my food to be ready. 
The custard shakes are tasty, but the texture is a bit different than a normal milkshake."}
{"text":"I really love it when classics get a contemporary makeover. An example of this protruded while house hunting a couple of years ago. Oddly enough, I was drawn to features (or the bones) of older houses with modern makeovers on the inside. Those darn wonderful pointed roofs with angles that make the most experienced roofer think about their safety, original exposed brick chimneys and perfect sized porches meant to serve ma and pa with the option of having the odd child or grandchild lingering around really appealed to me. However, at the same time the inside had nice clean modern looks with large kitchens and granite counter-tops, plenty of windows and sky-lighting to let in natural sunlight in and nice, though small, landscaped backyard to enjoy those long summer days. A nice harmony between old and new, the classic and the contemporary, history and modern conveniences. It made me happy.

These are the thoughts that peculated within my skull while eating lunch at Clive's. They've managed to maintain the classic juiciness and guilty-pleasure-greasiness of biting into a quality burger and fries while maintaining the evolutionary advances in diet and space design of 2012. There are gluten free and vegetarian options available; a nod to our understanding of modern dietary restrictions and choices. A large and clearly visible menu that allows you to plan your order while in line; making things both efficient for the establishment and their customers. After ordering you are given a square device with a number that vibrates when your order is ready; the contemporary version of yelling out a number when your order is complete. While waiting for your order, a cyclical mosaic on the west wall reminds you of how you can do your part to make the world of the burger sustainable; a reminder and understanding of the connection of things. Once you receive your order you can sit down at a nice spacious bench, that is 4 times the size of any burger joint I remember frequenting, which is ideal if you need to do some work on an laptop or tablet. Should you not have devices with you, some of the latest arts magazines are dangling at eye level for your browsing pleasure (I learned that the 80s are back, alive and well on the streets of Tokyo). 

It is a place that appeals to a wide range of people. I see families, couples and individuals sitting here. Malt vinegar is available within arms reach at most tables. It seems like it has something for everybody. A $4 order of fries will feed three people which is total incentive to bring a group of people when make a stop at Clive's. Well played! 

Keep the bones of a good burger joint and modernize everything else. Sounds like a winning formula to me. Clive's, respecting the classic burger joint, but living in 2012!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I don't normally like burgers but I can't get enough of these burgers! I hear they changed the oil from peanut oil, I'm not sure I like there fries now which is a shame."}
{"text":"cool place, feels like an actual place you'd want to hang out

double burger 4/5
fries 3.5/5"}
{"text":"I feel like Clive Burger has seriously gone downhill. The burger was overcooked, even though we were the only people there. The gravy in the poutine was so salty that it was inedible and I had to throw it away after a few bites. The only good thing was how friendly the staff was and the custard shake. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I'm surprised I hadn't written a review for Clive Burger earlier, because for my first 2 years in Calgary, I was here so often after the bars closed the restaurant staff would greet my friends and I as soon as we walked in the door. Sometimes they even broke out in song, I kid you not. I miss those days. Now my visits to Clive are much more ordinary, but still usually occur after 1am with few exceptions. This is a much superior alternative to McDonald's after the bar! Burgers are incredibly delicious, maybe because you get to pick exactly what toppings you want, and the \"small\" fries is enough to feed 2 people. Their fry sauce is something special, so ask for extra. The restaurant is awesome modern-diner decor inside, and you can purchase Clive Burger swag if you so desire -- and you should, c'mon, show your support. Clive Burger holds a special place in my heart (and my stomach) forever."}
{"text":"My veggie burger was okay. My friend's hamburgers were just okay. They did not like the taste of the custard shakes. The fries were stone cold which was very disappointing. I am not motivated to return. There are many other options in Calgary."}
{"text":"I went here last Saturday, beacuse Loungeburger was closed. (For lunch that is).
I parked in front of MRV, and was pleasantly surprised that I was given 2 hours of FREE parking by one of two parking elves.
I walked in, and found it wasn't very busy. I thought, man could the previous reviews been wrong. Maybe this place isn't that great afterall. 
I ordered a burger Clivestyle, which is a basic hamburger with your usual fixins'. Also the fries, and a couple of pops.
The girl that took our order wasn't REALLY friendly. It seemed like she wasn't into greeting, but was there just to take orders.
The family and I sat down at the counter and waited for our burgers and fries.
I also noticed that even the three guys back behind the counter weren't really engaging. I don't know about you, but I like it when the guy whos cooking your lunch at least looks over and says a simple hello.
We got our food, about 10 minutes later and that was the only time anyone spoke to us.
I guess I should explain something first. After taking your order, they give you one of those flashing coaster devices. When your order is ready, you guessed it, it flashes.
Then when you hand the \"coaster\" to the guy he thanks you for your order.
The burger itself was tasty, and the bun comes toasted. The fries were good as well.
In conclusion, would I come back here ? Maybe if I am in the area. Otherwise I'll stick to South St. or Fat burger. They're both alot closer to me !"}
{"text":"Clive Burger is the reason I am constantly in need of a hamburger. In my opinion, they make the best burgers I've had so far and their signature Clive sauce is to die for. The only reason, however, that it only got 3 stars from me is due to a number of things like staff and pricing. I find the staff are hit and miss with Clive; most of the staff are teenagers-young adults which is totally fine but almost every time I come, the level of professionalism does not meet the average standard. Most of the guys are the chefs, and they all look like they're having fun for the most part but the second an attractive girl comes in and happens to be sitting at their bar area (where you can watch them cook the burgers), the guys usually lose focus and put all their attention on the girl and leave customers awkwardly waiting... Another thing I have noticed is that the girls on cash are never nice and have a serious attitude problem. It's actually ironic because they all seem to get along and have fun on the job but when you actually get served by some of them, it's completely different unfortunately and doesn't make the experience that great. Don't get me wrong though, I have had some super friendly people serve me as well, but it's the majority of the other ones who don't add in a positive way. The prices are not great either. I get that it's supposed to be organic and all but at the end of the day, a burger is a burger and fries are fries. It's really unnecessary how if you ask for extra containers of clive sauce, they charge you... it's SAUCE. Despite these curveballs, I still recommend Clive as being one of the best burger joints Calgary has to offer."}
{"text":"I was getting the late night munchies, and I finally decided to try this place out. I've heard many raving reviews, so I was ready to feast on the best burger in Calgary.

I love the setup of the joint with the elevated level mid-restaurant and the long side-tables. I thought the burger was alright, but they're holding back on the meat portion. I'll admit their Clive Sauce is damn good.

Definitely you're nicer late-night snack."}
{"text":"Delicious!  I already want to go back. This is one of those 'order here, pick up over here', fast food style restaurant type places with really cool interiors and a great burger!  I loved it. Delicious burger. Fresh cut fries (and plenty of them), and a cool modern simple style in Calgarys trendiest neighbourhood. You should try this place!"}
{"text":"Well I'm sad to say but this is my lowest rating of a restaurant I have given out. I LOVE burgers. That's why I had high hopes for Clive burger. I walked in and liked the atmosphere. However when I turned and looked at the menu I was a bit shocked. The prices were a bit high but I just figured the burgers may be sizable enough to justify it. So for two single burgers with cheese, one order of fries, and two drinks it came to $28 bucks. These prices are higher then at the stampede. When the food arrived it was ok. Nothing special, nothing fantastic. Just ok. There is no value for your money, nothing the sets Clive burger out from any other burger (even a large fast food chain burger) and I can't see me ever going back."}
{"text":"I've heard sooo many good things about this place, and when I went i was less then impressed.
First of all, the vibe, the ambiance whatever you want to call it, is totally chill and I really like the overall aesthetic of the restaurant. That said, the whole idea of compostable materials is beautiful, thanks for the great idea, BUT, why when you order in are we not using reusable containers? seemed to defeat the purpose.. but anyway.

I had a veggie burger. I was really grossed out when the burger was so sloppy and messy and covered in egg pieces from the griddle. The french fries and custard shake were really delicious though, but I don't think i'll ever go back for another sloppy, cross contaminated, eggy burger."}
{"text":"So many delicious burger places popping up all over town! Its making it REALLY hard for me to watch my waistline and reach my goal of 'rock-hard-beachbody' by end of November!

Clive burger is awesomeness. I love their burgers. Good size (on the smaller side), and not messy. I LOVE their fries. A tad too salty for my taste, but crispy and delicious. I love that their menu is so simple, and you can get a beer too if you're so inclined. Or a milkshake.

But what I love the MOST is the restaurant artwork! Adorable little cartoon drawings of clive burgers and clive fries. Everywhere you look, there is a little drawing that will make you happy! I LOVE them! So much cuteness!!

Great addition to 17th!"}
{"text":"Basically, the Clive burger is a spendy, high-end McDonalds burger. Not bad, but nothing special, either. The fries are quite good, though, and as others have stated a small order is going to be sufficient for most people. (edited for spelling)"}
{"text":"Starting from the outside in, The bun makes the burger here. The potato bun just keeps moist while it gets that delicious crunch when it is toasted. Then you get to pile on all the toppings you want! Simple ketchup and mayo, cool! Sauerkraut and onion, awesome. And finally, the meat, cooked right in front of your eyes so you know it's hot and fresh. Great burger all around."}
{"text":"Shame... It was so good a couple of years ago but the quality of the food, service, cleaning and everything else is so bad now ... Not sure I'll come back"}
{"text":"On the pricier end of quick hamburgers.  Love the clive sauce on both the fries and burgers.  Great choice of toppings.  Inconsistency in how much the fries are cooked.  One of my go to places when I am hungry and have not yet made dinner plans."}
{"text":"Nice hipster burger joint.  The burgers were very good.  Love the favor and the meat, the ingredients were super fresh.  I strongly recommend the chocolate custard shake... omg... I'm a sucker for custard and it was heaven."}
{"text":"Burgers come in all sorts of interpretations, but always have stayed true to their quintessential elements - quality beef, a bun, fresh toppings and condiments.

Cliveburger is Uptown 17th Avenue's newest jewel in the crown of casual eateries on this famous Calgary strip. The ingredients are fresh, the beef is handpicked and ground to very high standards. What I like about Cliveburger is clearly evident as soon as you bite into one. It's the perfect harmony of ingredients, when at their freshest, stand out to each be noticed.

Add a side of fresh cut fries (that you can easily share) and a pint of draft and you are a happy person. 

Yes, this is a short review, but when things are simple, ingredients are fresh and the food is made to order, You can't complicate a good thing with more words. Just go there and see for yourself."}
{"text":"Not kidding, the best fries I've ever had! The peanut oil (and the right type of potatoes of course) makes all the difference. They remind me of fries in Amsterdam, and they're dam good! You even get a side of clive sauce, a cajun-mayo of some sort, and it's tasty too.

Burger was very good but a little skimpy on the toppings... I'll ask for double next time, no big deal. The bun is unique with a tasty glaze on top, but it could be softer with a little more flavour... it's no Shake Shack ;) (NYC)."}
{"text":"So after my Borgo shut-out (because apparently it's not breakfast if it's not smothered in mozzarella), I walked to Clive because I knew they had a vegan burger. \"Had\" being the operative word, because after waiting for about 15 minutes in their line-up, they were all out. Also, I've been told that their buns are not vegan, regardless of whether or not you get the vegan patty. They will, however, wrap it in lettuce for you. While it was my fault for not asking about this before, someone that thinks it's acceptable to give vegans eggs needs a clue-tip.

Sorry, I'm not sorry. The idea of a burger wrapped in lettuce makes me sad. Doesn't it make you sad? They also don't seem to respond to tweets, unless they are full of glowing comments, and that's pretty bogus. You should open yourself up to dialogue and honest criticism from your customers."}
{"text":"The burgers are OK. The gluten free buns are fragile.  I find the fries tasty but greasy.  The milkshakes are really good, but once again really heavy."}
{"text":"Very good burger.  I had a double and wouldn't have wanted it any bigger, especially since the portion of fries was huge.  The fries were very crispy, which isn't for me, but they were still high quality and tasty.

There's a lot of bar seating if you happen to be alone and want a casual lunch, they do composting, and the staff that I dealt with were friendly and laid back.  Definitely worth giving a try."}
{"text":"Clive Burger opened yesterday in the old Wok Box location.  As they put it,  its a \"Seriously Simple Menu\"  burgers, smokies, fries, shakes, pop, beer and wine.

I had the basic Cheese burger, with their Clive sauce, and the basics, relish, mustard and pickles.  The Burger was cooked just right, but honestly the cheese could have used some more time on the burger to be melted more fully,  I'm sure that will improve with time.

I had a glass of wine, comes in what I always call a Euro-glass,  more of a juice glass,  the burgers come in a recylable wrapper, no plating,  so when you order the question never arose, \"is this to go\"  Not an issue.  

Considering it was the first day and how busy they were, my wait time was less than 10 minutes from ordering to having the burger in my hands,  I had my wine to enjoy so all was good.

The atmosphere is bright, fresh and clean,  a great interpretation of the classic burger joint.

I look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"So, legend has it that what you do in the first three days of the new year is a representation of the entire year to come. This is a superstition that my family has instilled in me since I was young, shared by many traditional Japanese folks.

On day 1 of 2016, my friend had a \"strong craving\" for a hotdog. I happily exclaimed \"then let's get a hotdog\" despite my après NY's eve headache, lethargy and overall disinterest in going outside and roamed the blustery streets of 17th Ave in search of a hotdog that would appease my friend. 

As one can imagine, the streets were fairly desolate and scant of in-service hotdog establishments. Dairy Queen was closed. The closest establishment relative to where I was was Clive Burger. When I had a burger from Clive Burger a couple of years back, I thoroughly enjoyed it. This time however, service was very slow and the food lack lustre. I'm not sure if it was because they had more patrons than anticipated and they understaffed and the \"stock\" was old but the \"smokie\" we ordered was just a long, floppy, European wiener, and the poutine had a 6:1 gravy to fries ratio and was sopping wet. Now, I'm a gravy lover and could swim in a vat of gravy with my mouth open, but it was too much gravy. Too much. See the photos. It's not hard to imagine how the meal tasted. I wouldn't write Clive Burger off for the future, however. I've always thought quality was poor at dining establishments during the first of January. One year, when I had a tuna sub from Subway, I ended up getting food poisoning. I digress...and that's a story for another day.

So, if the Japanese NY's superstition holds true, I am to look forward to eating a lot of gravy, will not say \"no\" to friends who invite me to dine, and I will trek in the bone-chilling-cold to fill my stomach or that of my amigos. That I think, is a great omen for 2016 my friends."}
{"text":"After reading all the reviews and seeing so many ratings of it being one of the best burger places I decided to give it a try! It was very very good and tasty. Was bit of a wait but sometimes you have to wait for quality!"}
{"text":"I felt the need to re-review, as I was there again (so good!) and it was brought to my attention, you can get lettuce buns! Yay!!! So happy about this. Don't get me wrong it's great they do GF buns, but sometimes you want a little healthier option, not that the side of wine was healthy, but hey. 

Always have a great burger here, fries are great and wine is good too."}
{"text":"Wow! First time to Clive and it didn't disappoint. We're always in search of that great burger and I think we found our hidden gem. Service was friendly, helpful and fast! Clive all the way!"}
{"text":"It seems like a lot of the bad reviews are from people who went at nighttime when the food wasn't fresh. I was here on a quiet sunday afternoon so everything was being cooked from scratch. I had a mad craving for fries. They were excellent, and the clive sauce was sooo good!  The milkshake machine was broken otherwise I would have tried one."}
{"text":"Shooot, Arc said it best, \"classics [with] a contemporary makeover\". We walked in here after a disappointing visit to Model Milk, whose infamous burger wasn't available on a Sunday night and National, who is the Hansel (re: Zoolander) of 17th-it's SOOO HOT right now reservations aren't possible with that place. So after a few quick punches into my yelp app, I was more than glad to direct my out-of-town visitors to this place.

Their menu is quite simple but offers a lot of choices and encouraged me to come back. I went with a double cheeseburger with a fried egg and lazily picked my burger to be \"clivestyled\". I also ordered fries and a Pabst beer as well. My companions also ordered the same along with their Vanilla shakes. It was an amazing meal, especially on a day where all you needed was the simplicity but meaty goodness of a burger. My Clive Burger was juicy and the fixins were arranged to proportion. I happily scarfed this (what I estimated) 1000 calorie goodness down without any reservations or guilt. Their fries were also delicious and done just the way I like it; small bites and crispy fried. The Pabs went down really well and I was tempted to go back and try several of the unique beers Clive had.

This city boasts some of the best burger joints and best burgers in the city, and Clive has won me from all these other places"}
{"text":"The cutest cartoon burger people on their compostable packaging, and locally sourced ingredients to make both you and your tummy smile. Clive Burger is the classic American burger stand reinvented with a local, Alberta twist. 

It's simple: single, double or triple, and your choice of fixin's. Make sure to get one of their delicious custard shakes to wash it down.

I was most recently in Clive Burger because my friend, Dallin L. was about to propose to his now fiance! Yup. At a burger bar - and I can't think of a better burger bar to do it at.

I say that pulling aside any sort of significant value this place might hold for them, or how unsuspecting this location may have been -- Clive Burger is just really freaking cute!

The walls are covered in the most adorable little burger cartoons depicting the adventure of Burger, Hotdog, Shake, Fries, Beer and friends. I love having a burger and a super delicious, seriously so good chocolate malt shake and enjoying the artwork.

I went with a single burger and got everything I could put on it. Bacon, an egg and beyond- all if it went of my burger. So good. The buns were a little chilly today - I don't know if that's a common thing but it sure wasn't enjoyable. I bet something was weird.. I doubt that's a \"thing\" here.

They've got Village Brew on tap and even have a selection of boozy shakes. I can't wait for my next Clive Burger."}
{"text":"I liked my burger and fries, but wish they offered sweet patatoe fries.  Great service good food, but I was tunred off by three containers of fries next to the dish pit???  Sure they're in containers, but the moisture from the dirty water could make its way into the container.  Health and safety lacking!!!"}
{"text":"Yum, the burger was delicious, but the shakes were lacking.  They call them custard shakes, apparently thicker than regular shakes, but I found them quite thin.

I definitely appreciated their focus on environmentalism in the packaging and operations.  The price was fair also.  I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I've tried a few different burger places in Calgary (including the infamous Peter's Drive In which I have no idea is so popular) and I can confidently state that Clive Burger is the best. My friend Seano recommended this place and if there is one thing that he knows, it's a good burger. Ever since my first visit (a few months back) I've been back almost every couple of weeks.
Burgers are 5 stars
Fries/Poutine 3 stars
Atmosphere 3 stars
Overall: A solid 4 stars (5 if you just want a good burger)

I must also say though that even though most of the add ons are free (lettuce, tomato, onion etc.), the ones you do pay for a ridiculously expensive...$2 for a fried egg?!"}
{"text":"Decent and fresh burgers and really good fries (especially with the Clive sauce). A bit pricey, but made to order fresh. A little slow if busy, so if you're in a rush probably not the right place!"}
{"text":"Good burger and decent poutine for sure. However the goddamned milkshake - the custard vanilla flavor one.... Wow just wow. Easily the best milkshake I've ever had in my life. So so so so so so good! Will judge all other milkshakes based on this from now on!"}
{"text":"Licensed.
Alcoholic milkshakes.
There's a record store near by.
And Analog at the corner.
The burgers are good.
The fries are fine.
But it's those Alcoholic milkshakes man.
Those milkshakes..."}
{"text":"I love Clive Burger. The burgers aren't too big. They're just greasy enough to be a little messy. The fries are fantastic but they could give you a little more clive sauce to dip with. I consider it fast food and when you compare it to other fast food burgers it's unmatched."}
{"text":"Burgers and fries were really good, hot and fast. The bourbon chocolate banana milkshake is a must though. It was delicious! The staff was really friendly and it's a cool place inside."}
{"text":"All I want to do is talk about the burger. I passed by Clive Burger on a very sunny afternoon and decided to do some takeout on a whim. The menu is really really simple to understand and there are some really interesting toppings to choose from. I decided that I wanted my single cheese burger to be, \"Clivestyle\". If you're going to put your name on it that's what I'm trying first.

The bun was really nice. Soft on the inside, crisp on the outside. Biting into my burger earned a satisfying little crunch before really could taste the meat. The, \"Clive sauce\" was the first thing that I could taste. I'm not sure what it is. Mustard and something else combined?

The burger itself was really flavorful and the texture was fantastic. I got a little bit excited when some drippings landed on the wrapping paper because after reading the description of how the burgers are made I was expecting something dry. Not the case at all!

The pickle was crisp as was the lettuce. The tomato even had some texture, like it had just been sliced (I hate slimy tomatoes).

I thought the portion size was a little bit small, but it was seven dollars which is very reasonable. If you're really hungry you might want to have a double or a triple. A very fresh and satisfying burger!

I'll be back."}
{"text":"I've only been here once. The burger was really good (aka super fattening). 

As I ate my burger and got to the end, my face stopped and my husband said \"what!?\"  I dropped the burger as there was a giant curly black hair in the meat! Ughhhh *shudder*. I had almost eaten the whole thing so there was no need to make a big deal out of it. I just haven't been back. But what I ate was good!"}
{"text":"The burgers here are very good and made to order. However, once you order it will take a while to get your burger especially if you come during a peak time. Hopefully a different process can be created so burgers can come out more quickly. We sometimes avoid Clive if we don't have time to wait around."}
{"text":"Long wait, shitty service, messed up a simple order. This was their last chance. Time to close.

Crabby, surly girl at the till, warm pop, and when the burgers finally turned up the order was wrong!!! I told them they'd put the wrong cheese on our burgers, the cooked laughed and said, \"oh yeah\" while nodding. Are you serious??? Nice customer service, mess up and order and then laugh and offer to do nothing. 

The manager or whatever he was, was more concerned dimming the lights just right (at 6:45pm???) than making his customer happy. 

DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME at this past it, hipster dump."}
{"text":"Now there's an awesome burger joint for you!

It's all quality ingredients and everything is fresh. They have perfect lettuce and gorgeous tomatoes (I never thought I'd compliment the lettuce in a burger place but a good burger is so much more than just good meat). The patties are the right thickness, juicy and are actually tasty. I was starting to think there is a by-law that prohibits the use of salt in burgers in Calgary! 

The staff are really cool too! I'm just glad I don't live very close to this place otherwise I'd be fat again in no time!!!"}
{"text":"When Clive first opened it seemed like the food was made with love, it was really good, if a little expensive. 
This time, miserable girl on cash, long wait for the food, the mixed up the cheeses and the burgers were dry thin bricks, they could also be less generous with the salt on the fries, (you can add more but you can't take it off) Made with indifference, still too expensive, even more so when the meal was crap."}
{"text":"Great service and good ambience. Got a veggie burger which had a great bun and toppings but the burger itself was a standard garden burger which I can get at Costco. Boozy shake was great."}
{"text":"My daughter and I just arrived in Calgary and were starved for lunch. Noticed Clive Burger and wanted to check it out. Went in, ordered our burger, and it was made fresh!  It was deliciously juicy and it was tailored to our liking. Menu on the wall is straightforward. You can chose toppings, sides, etc. When we ordered the large fries, make no mistake it came in a HUGE bag, plenty for four. 

Great to see the restaurant decor, also. Very inviting, comfortable and modern. Resto is big with composting and recycling, which is the greenest way to go.  Good on you Clive Burger.  Will definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"I've been here twice for lunch now. Once on a Saturday and once on a Friday. Both times it's been a pretty positive experience. They're a little expensive for a burger joint but they are downtown so it goes with the territory. Last time it was me and my three-under-six kids and I had a pint, double burger, large fries, single burger (that they split) and a milkshake (the kids split that too) and it came to $43. I like, I hope it sticks around Calgary needs places where you can get a good burger and a pint."}
{"text":"Good ol' Clive Burger! My go-to place when I crave a burger past 9pm since most of other burger joints in this city are closed by then. Always there. Always solid.

I typically order a double with cheese and eggs plus a couple of other free add-on's, and fries on the side which amounts to about $17. I've never been disappointed by their burgers. The patty is always juicy although the burger could get very messy even without the egg. Patties don't seem to be frozen. Always satisfies my hunger. Fries are always soggy unfortunately.

Pretty expensive and I have other favorites for that price but if you're ever in need of a solid burger late at night, Clive will be there. I prefer it over Flipp'n Burgers."}
{"text":"Food was really good but guy working at the front counter had some major attitude. I asked for a simple request and he argued with me before rolling his eyes at me. He also cut off my friend while she was ordering. Clive Burger needs to work on providing better customer service. Disappointed. :("}
{"text":"Stopped in here while driving through Cowtown for a quick take out lunch and to scout it out for future visits with the family.

Got the eponymous Clive Burger with all the standard fixings and the bag full of fries (also known as the \"small\" serving\" with Clive Sauce as well as a custard shake to round out the experience. 

Loved it! Will definitely add to our regular stops."}
{"text":"I was out sneak a peeking and stampeding as people are wont to do, and finished up the night close by to this delicious joint. I've been hearing rumors of the Clive Burger goodness, and was only too happy to get sucked in by the classic, modern decor, burgery smells and overall delicousness. The wide open spaces make this a fantastic post-night our space.

I am 90% positive that my... er... even-headedness this morning is due to that pleasant mix of hamburger, clive sauce, and the majillion toppings I ordered to exactly suit my tastes! At last, no onions to deal with! It was indeed an epic night out burger, and I consider myself a bit of a connoisseur about these things.

The staff and patrons were all super-nice and friendly too, making it a great experience! I loved the vibrating order coasters - it's all about the little touches.

The casual, easy-going atmosphere makes me want to come back during the day and try one of those custard shakes that they were advertising. Perfect for a fantastic night out."}
{"text":"4 stars for the service, 3 stars for their custard milkshake, which doesn't taste like it should sound.  When I think of custard, I think of fresh from a bakery, but voila, it comes out of a machine...look, I love the Dairy Queen soft serve too, which is also straight from a machine but i digress.

Ordered the coffee one, and it was barely any strong taste of coffee, even if you're not a coffee lover, Kit Kat would give you more flavour.

ended up ordering the chocolate, which was much better."}
{"text":"We love to wander 17th Avenue on a nice day, grab a coffee, window shop or have lunch/snack/froyo. Today we wanted a burger and somehow ended up right in the area of Clive Burger just before lunch. Perfect timing since it wasn't busy and we have minions who can't wait in long line ups.

The kids had fries and shamrock shakes, the grown ups had burgers and shared a massive bag of fries. Holy cow we had fries for days. But they were good.

Everything was tasty, we got seats no problem and service was great. Can't wait to stop in during YYC Burger Week and check out their burger offering."}
{"text":"Hands down my favourite burger in town. Add in a bag of golden brown fries and a crack-laced milkshake and we have a meal fit for royalty.

Also what's neat is that all their packaging is compostable. Clive could probably go one step further to reduce waste and just hand me the burger off the grill; it's not like the burger stays in the wrapper for all that long, as I can inhale those bad boys.

In any case, if you want a good ol' burger: go to Clive."}
{"text":"Huge burger, good toppings, great fries.  Simple menu - burgers (veggie & gluten free options), smokies, fries, drinks.  My single burger was plenty; my date's double burger was massive.  Yummy custard shake.

Cute space - clean, tables inside and out.  Staff were great.  We were there on a sunny Sunday, and there was a line; not sure what the situation is like other times of the day.

If you're on 17th, it's a great stop for a quick meal."}
{"text":"ERMAHGERRRDDDBERRGERRRRS!!!

Sooo stoked that I finally got to try Clive Burger! I'd been hearing rave reviews about it since it opened, but never had a chance to check it out. I was greeted by a lovely woman at the front cash, who was full of smiles and anecdotes BOTH times I went in (once to eat, and again later that evening to get take out). I ordered the Double with cheese, Clive style, as well as an order of the fries and a custard shake. Absolutely DELICIOUS. I really love that they make each burger fresh to order, so although you have to wait a few minutes, your burger is insanely awesome. I found it to also be pretty messy!! I was in heaven. The fries come in a bag, and the order is huge so you really dont need to order more than 1 per group of 2-3. I loved the custard shake as well. New favorite burger joint in the city!!"}
{"text":"The place is really nice, hip, great joint. The fries are good but the burger isnt the best thing on the menu! Dont order the large fries its tooo large 
Although good service but u get ur food late, honestly best thing bout it is how cool the place is"}
{"text":"Clive has one of tastier burgers in Calgary, and the price is pretty decent. I'm surprised to see all the negative reviews on here. The menu is simple: single, double, or triple burger? Cheese or no cheese? Cheddar or swiss? Toppings? (most free, some not), anything to drink? Here's the buzzer for when your order is ready. Done. Reminds me a little bit of Five Guys, but local. The only thing I always find awkward is when first approaching the cashier to place your order, they interrupt you to \"get your name first\" and you can tell the employees are tired of doing it, but it's not their fault, the point of sale system must be built that way. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"I'm conflicted on whether or not to write a review. It has been a very long since I've come here, and my visit here yesterday just... wasn't what I expected. The bf needed something for supper yesterday, and we thought that clive burger would be the best option as we have both been eyeing it each time we come down to 17th.

The ordering was quick, and the cashier tried her best to convince us to get their peppermint St. Patty's shake as it was for a \"limited time\" only. Instead, we opted to get a chocolate custard shake :D The shake was made quickly as we were paying, no complaints about it at all, I couldn't help but keep staring into the eyes of the hamburger on the cup as we waited for our food.

For \"food\" we got a double burger with swiss cheese and a small fry to go. There were seats available during our wait, but the tables were all either dirty or cluttered with empty water glasses. The wait wasn't too long, so I was glad we could get out of there in a hurry.

During our two minute walk to the car, I attempted to munch on the fries. Every third fry I got was either too salty or was way to hard to even chew. I think they may have over done the fries... just by a few extra minutes... epic sadness.

Unfortunately, that was not the end to my sadness. It turned out that the burger we got hadn't survived our two minute walk to the car either. The burger was a mess to unwrap as they had over done the clive sauce. The overall texture of the burger meat and swiss cheese... was mush. Just mush... I wish we weren't in a hurry yesterday because this was a meal I would've taken back in a quick second. The price vs. quality did not match up at all yesterday.

Overall... You win some you lose some. This visit was a write off in my books, maybe some day the hamburger with legs with lure me in again... but not anytime soon for sure."}
{"text":"\"Clive Burger. Our friend wants to try it out because his name is Clive.\"

For real. Word for word quote from two people outside contemplating whether they should head in or not as I was out munching on my cheeseburger with swiss cheese, mushrooms, onions, lettuce and tomato (a few of the many free toppings you can get on your Clive Burger.\"

\"I hear it's even supposed to be better than Five Guys,\" the gentleman says.

I'd agree with this statement. Then again, I've never been overly fond of Five Guys since I tried the Deerfoot Meadows location last year. Clive Burger though, it's got a vibe about it. Maybe it's the straight forward and simple menu? Or the peanut oil fries? Or the fact that more fries than 2 of us could share, a good burger and a drink all cost me around $13.50? Then again, it could be that everything they serve is either recyclable or compostable. Seriously, there's no garbage can in the entire joint-only compost and recycling receptacles.

The burger may take a little longer for you to get than a fast food joint, but what the hell! For good quality meat AND to get my do-gooder environmentally-friendly self going, I'm all for it.

Oh, also... girl at the counter. Amazing! I only wish I had gotten her name. I'll have to check my receipt. She gets 5 stars. No wait... 6.. no 10. She was fantastic! \"What's in the Clive sauce?\" I asked her. \"It's sort of like.. well, you just have to try it. And with what you've ordered on your burger it's going to taste sooooo good!\" She also talked up the natural soda available made from sugar cane. And all like she genuinely enjoyed each, not like she was just trying to talk up the products.

Clive Burger, you're doing good things so far. If I may suggest one thing at this point, it's that, if it is at all possible, can you give folks an approximate wait time for their burgers? Being my first visit, I found myself waiting on the patio and wondering if I had missed my burger or if there was something wrong with the little buzzer you handed me."}
{"text":"I just had what might have been the best burger on the best bun with the best toppings and the best fries I've ever had in my entire life at the newly-opened Clive Burger. Single with clive sauce, jalapeno, FANTASTIC pickle and cheddar cheese. Jimmy H, this is real cheddar, not processed cheese food, so it won't melt that way, but it was perfect anyway.

Aside from those words, there are none. Except that the prices are extremely decent too."}
{"text":"When I was younger I had a shirt that said \"Clive\" on it in fancy lettering. That shirt pissed me off because for months I thought it said \"Jive\". Upon discovering the horrible truth I couldn't find any definition for the word \"Clive\". So there I was, some dork in a Clive shirt that nobody understood. 

That has very little to do with this review, but I need you to understand that for this bizarre reason I was pre-determined to not like Clive Burger. It took some introspection while staring at my bedroom ceiling before I realized the source of my dislike for a place I had never been, but, well, there it is. Psychoanalysis complete.

Luckily, Clive won me over.

Going to Clive is like meeting the sexiest hippy you've ever come across in your life while attending a business course; a Hippy who unabashedly sports long dreadlocks but also happens to be listening to Bon Iver on an Ipod they fashioned out of all-organic coconut husks while wearing a pinstripe three piece suit made of fair-trade cotton.

\"Hippyster\", if you will. 

The place is extremely trendy; whoever is responsible for their branding hit several home runs. The space they're in is ultramodern and you feel slightly cooler for being in there, smiling as people walk by and thinking to yourself \"I am SO in right now.\"

But then, behind all the suave branding is one of the most environmentally aware businesses I've come across in the city. Everything they give you is compostable - from the burger boxes to the corn plastic cups your shakes come in. Their beef is some sort of crazy organic meat setup where I'm sure the farmers hug the cows and give them names and insist that they are only hand-fed grass grown in a terrarium. 

Oh, and they have Gluten-Free and vegetarian options, but why a vegetarian would go anywhere that ends in \"Burger\" is beyond me. Maybe it's the same reason straight people go to a gay bar.

The greatest thing about Clive, and what I'm shocked nobody is really emphasizing, is that unlike other burger joints (like the massively underwhelming Loungeburger) you can put as many extra toppings on it as you want without having to pay more (With the exception of cheese and bacon). 

I can't emphasize enough how rad this is. It's like buying a car and then having the salesman tell you that you can add an obnoxious sound system, spinning rims and an 8 foot spoiler for free. Suddenly you're driving the coolest Prius in the neighborhood. 

But seriously - add jalapenos, mushrooms, caramelized onions, hot sauce, special sauce, mayonnaise, two kinds of mustard, ALL. FOR. FREE!!!!!! 

But sadly, reader, I took this privilege too far. I ordered a double burger with cheese. Then out of foolish excitement, I pretty much added every single optional topping there was. What arrived to me was indeed my burger, but I had created a goopy, dripping monster.

Granted, they gave me exactly what I asked for, but my burger looked like burger soup. How did it taste!?

Glorious. Not the best burger I've ever had in my life, but a great addition to Calgary's food scene and far and away less embarrassing than going to Harvey's (\"Oh, you actually come here too!? High five!\")

But the joy doesn't end there. Crispy fries cooked up in Peanut Oil are sure to please, unless you've got a peanut allergy in which case you will die a horrible death upon consuming just one.

Their shakes are delicious also; I sampled one but can't recall the flavor, probably because I had seared my tastebuds off at that point eating hot sauce, hot mustard and jalapenos amidst a sea of other toppings.

Not feeling a shake? Good news, they're licensed.

In the end, Clive's friendly service, super-customizable burgers and environmental awareness make it a fantastic place to drop by. It's not the best burger you've ever had - and if you don't add the extra toppings the price point might seem a bit high - but I was a happy customer.

Not quite happy enough to go dig out my old \"Clive\" shirt, but close."}
{"text":"Pretty dang good burger place.  Fast, cheap, and close.  However, I recommend staying away from the cherry shake.  Chocolate shake was awesome though."}
{"text":"Yummy! The burgers are fantastic (fresh buns, juicy beef), and the poutine was surprisingly great too!

Pretty sad that their poutine is better than the actual \"poutine\" place next door. The gravy could be a bit better/ more flavourful (hence the 4 Stars) but the cheese curd to fry ratio is generous and the portion sizes are too! If I could give this place 4.5 stars I would! 

Definitely a win! Will be coming back :)"}
{"text":"After my positive experience of nomming on french fries at Clive, I'm afraid I have to take back my happy rainbow vibes. Last time I visited with another vegan friend, she ordered the veggie burger. Like I mentioned previously, I had to actually ask whether the burger was vegetarian or vegan, to which the cashier responded they have both options. So, unless specified, they would probably give you the vegetarian burger anyways which still contains animal byproducts. 

Anyways, I shared the fact that Clive does have a vegan burger with some other veggie friends. One of them ended up going, and when she ordered the vegan burger and asked about the buns, it was discovered there were eggs in them. Clive's solution to this was to wrap the burger in lettuce for her which...wtf. 

So, I emailed AND Facebooked Clive about this issue. Here is an excerpt of what I said, \"...To me, it kind of defeats the purpose to offer a vegan burger patty, yet throw it on top of a bun that vegans cannot eat. So used to having to cook for ourselves and cope with crummy salads in most mainstream restaurants, we love a good vegan option. Put a tasty veggie burger on your menu, and we will worship it. We will tell all our friends and patronize your establishment loyally. We don't want to cause any trouble because of our cruelty-free lifestyles, we just want to feel comfortable when we put our trust in a restaurant to serve us something that matches up with our values.

If I'm not overstepping, I might suggest considering serving burger buns that contain no animal products. Some byproducts to look out for on the market include egg(both inside the bun and eggwash on top), l-cystiene (derived from duck feathers), milk/milk powder, whey, etc. With so many great local bakeries, finding breads free of these ingredients is easier than ever....\"

No response. Ever. Really? Is it that hard to just confirm someone's message was read, and even PRETEND that you will take the issue into consideration?

Finally, over the weekend when The Coup was way too busy, another pal and I decided to stroll over to Clive to see if anything had changed. We acted as though we had never visited, and asked the cashier if there was a vegan option. She claimed, yes, there was a vegan burger. Before she plugged our order in, we interjected, \"So...everything is vegan,even the bun? No eggs or dairy?\" She seemed caught off guard and went back to the cooks. She came back and gave us some rambling excuse that the bun was not vegan, and the gluten free one had eggs too, and offered us the same stupid consolation of wrapping it in lettuce. 


By failing to provide a vegan friendly bun (which is not hard at all), or even a disclaimer to explain this option must be wrapped in lettuce, you fail to provide a wholly vegan option. And generally, if something in a restaurant claims to be vegan, we assume you can back your shit up and have done your research. Therefore, some people are going to trust you enough not to question whether the whole thing is actually animal-byproduct free, which is a bummer. Would you disrespect an allergy in the same way? Is your gluten free option MOSTLY gluten free, but with some flour hidden in there somewhere? By omission, you are greasy liars, and you are fucking with peoples' lifestyle choices. I'm not sorry."}
{"text":"I'm a burger guy amongst other things, out for long ride. And decided I needed to try burger here a few weeks ago, AWESOME, for a burger guy I really enjoyed it. Initially they miss placed my order so while i waited they brought me a free milkshake as a thank you for patience. When, the burger showed up shortly there after, and included fries (again as thanks for waiting) you would have to be18 and playing football to not be totally stuffed with a double burger, Clive style , fries and a shake.    Great place for the burger boy or girl."}
{"text":"It's hard to claim the best burger in a town founded on the cattle trade. Clive Burger is arguably one of the many contenders and perhaps the most successful. 

Always a suggested stop for some burgerlicious."}
{"text":"I've been a fan because of their options for gluten intolerance as well as great brand design but last time I got a lettuce wrap I got a patty smaller then my iphone wrapped in 5 huge leaves of lettuce. I ended up having to pick all the lettuce off and trash it until I found my actual burger. Definitely not worth 6 dollars. in the future I'll drive the distance to five guys instead."}
{"text":"An amazing burger spot!  Love that all the packaging is compostable and recycled.  There's a nice list of toppings for your burgers and also can combine them with their yummy fresh cut fries!  I love the Clive Sauce!  
Their shakes are also very tasty!  Great place for a tasty burger!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped into Clive Burger Saturday afternoon. We have drove by this place so many times and finally got a chance to try it out. Glad we did! My husband really enjoyed the burger here. He ordered the 2 patty burger with cheddar cheese and a bunch of the free toppings. He said the meat is really tasty and we appreciated that it was 100% grass fed AB beef! The line was a little slow but I felt bad because only one girl was working at the front taking orders and making milkshakes and 2 guys making the burgers. Maybe they should employ one more person to help with the drinks. Great little place on 17th."}
{"text":"The burgers here are ok. That is it. They're just ok. You'd only think they're amazing if the scope of your burger experience is limited to the golden arches and the king. They put too much sauce and seasoning in the meat doesn't blend well with it.

And for the price they charge, it's simply not good enough. 

What they do get right are the fries. They're really good."}
{"text":"I had high expectations for this place, this was my first time and you know what they say about first impressions. I walked in thinking I would get a burger but got woo'd by thier Poutine Week offering- fresh fries covered in cheese curds, scratch gravy, and thier signature patty. I was sadly disappointed. I arrived before the lunch crowd, when barely anyone was in the restaurant, yet it took 25 minutes for me to get my poutine! Apparently no one got fries for almost half hour as none were prepped (so said the cashier later on after I finally did receive my order).

The poutine itself was disgusting. The fries managed to be cool to touch and without colour. The cheese curds were ICE cold. The patty was ok. The gravy was by far the worst of the whole dish- it consisted of barely cooked onions, large amounts of parsley and very little actual liquid, and again was barely room temperature. 

I sat at the bench looking into the cooking area, my food didn't sit waiting to be served to me, all the components were legitimately not hot.

I am unsure if I will return again to try the burger."}
{"text":"Their burgers and shakes are delicious! Staff are usually very friendly, but it does take a bit of time before I actually get my food. The prices are also a bit high, but overall, I really enjoy this place and do visit from time to time."}
{"text":"Clive Burger makes a pretty mean burger.  It's a really nice atmosphere as well.  I tried their YYC Burger Week burger which was a stuffed burger.  It was tasty but I think they relied too much on the sauce. It was dripping in the sauce and was quite messy.  I really liked their custard shakes spiked with bourbon... I had the \"coffee\" one :)

Their fries were unbelievably salty.  I almost had to spit one out because of the salt.  I wonder if that's their normal thing or someone screwed it up.  It would've been 5-stars if it weren't for the fries being too salty and the burger being too messy and falling apart.

I'm definitely looking forward to trying their regular burgers.  I"}
{"text":"I love cheap burger joints such as Clive's. This place is a blend of modern and hip with a vintage diner feel. I like how the menu is set up, it's simple and easy to understand and nothing too overwhelming which is nice. I got a cheeseburger with mustard, ketchup, their special house mayo, and the regular veggie toppings. Also a side of large fries (which they were very generous with) and a bottle of water all for $15. Which is not bad if you think about how expensive McDonald's or A&W meals can get up to these days. 

I love that they are open late because I am a night person and a girl gets hungry past midnight you know? Things to expect: lots of beer, drunk people, and lots of hipsters. Nothing against all of the above, it makes for a good party."}
{"text":"The burgers here are very tasty and I love how they have veggie patties. Serving beer and wine is a nice bonus as well. There is plenty of seating and it's very bright. The fries are great at first but I think because they're fried in peanut oil they get hard very fast. The quality of the burgers definitely makes up for the shortcomings of the fries however. I think this will become one of my favorite burger joints this summer."}
{"text":"all of my friends who ate here are shitting themselves to death. I hate this place. I hate it's clean designer lite decor. I hate it's two dollar toppings. I hate it's stupid little mascot. I hate that it gave the people I love diarrhea. fuck clive burger. fuck every concord group restaurant."}
{"text":"Cute place on 17th! I liked the atmosphere here and the burgers were definitely delicious. I didn't like the fries at all but I must say that their portions are huge! You definitely get your money's worth. 

The thing I didn't really appreciate was that they just had no idea about any of the ingredients that were being used there. I have severe allergies and when we asked what kind of oil they used they couldn't tell us. When we said I have a severe peanut/ sesame allergy they said they're pretty sure I should be fine but they weren't 100% certain... I mean things ended up being fine- I just really appreciate when the staff at a restaurant are able to tell me what's in the food. 

Otherwise- it's good! I'm sure we will be back."}
{"text":"Decent burger but could be much better. I am debating between a 3 or 4 star but for the benefit of doubt I will give it 4 for first impression. 

I ordered the hamburger with the Clive sauce and ketchup and almost all the free toppings plus extras for swiss cheese and mushroom. When served it comes with an egg bun which looks very promising. However that is where the disappointment starts... the bun was cold so it made the overall experience like eating a cold hamburger. They could have toasted or warmed it and the burger would have felt a lot better. Taste wise it was pretty good however the patty was a processed patty, for a premium burger place I would expect a homemade beef patty. 

The good or the green, everything they served can be recycled or composted."}
{"text":"Great ambience, service. Design. 

Everything is compostable & or recyclable in house. 

Locally sourced ingredients. Sounds good so far right? 

Zero Waste? : But wait a minute..... 

My burger wrapped in paper, fries placed in a paper container, then all stuffed in a Paper bag, THEN placed in a basket. That was a standard order to STAY. (I observed all orders were carried out the same way.

I finished my meal and then recycled / composted any waste in the appropriate bins (no garbage) 

Wouldn't it be easier to have a burger & fries on paper and then a basket to stay? 


My first visit: Loud Rap & Hip Hop sounding. The burger: metallic tasting. 
Fries, I don't remember. 

2nd visit: (I often give places a second chance as this one had so much going for it. 
I walked in, smelled this salty, fried, metallic, familiar odour and walked back out. 

BTW, i did contact the owner directly before I posted this, to be fair. 

This review is based on 2 visits. (to be fair)"}
{"text":"Clive's design is really their winning factor. 

Their menu is simple and easy to navigate, their interior is bright, friendly and inviting, their \"mascots\" and logos are cute and appealing and their model of sustainability is smart and inspiring. (That sentence sounds rather sing-songy, but maybe it's because Clive Burger inspires me to want to create children's programming for public broadcasting.)

Clive Burger is not mind-blowing by any stretch of the imagination, but it is a solid burger place serving up tasty fries, shakes and of course, burgers.

I got a double burger with cheddar and bacon, which set me back about $12, and which is a little steep when you consider that that's the price for the burger alone; fries and drinks are priced separately. But I don't mind paying a little extra for the local guy, and especially when you know that their whole concept is creating a burger shack with a healthy relationship with its suppliers, and an angle bent on reducing impact to the environment (their packaging products are all compostable). 
Besides, it is easy enough to share a shake ($5) and an order of small fries ($2.50) between you and your loved one (trust me, it's more than enough!). 

The shake was maybe my favorite part. The cherry flavor was bursting and the shake was creamily delicious. The fries were good, but as I said before, nothing mind-blowing. 

The bun was the best part of the burger and the meat was seasoned well. You can pick your own \"fixins,\" although, cheese, bacon or an egg are extra.
The biggest downside of the meal was maybe the greasiness. Don't get me wrong, I like m'grease as much as the next guy, but when picking up the burger, the bun seemed to get unnaturally greasy.

At any rate, a solid burger! I will certainly be back, and I could definitely see myself bringing my future family down here for a treat every once in a while."}
{"text":"Seriously.  The best burgers I've ever had in Calgary.  I also love how they recycle ;).  Great place good people and very clean.  And if you knew me I like clean !  lol"}
{"text":"Hey Clive,

I can't make up my mind about you. 

Your facility is lovely, it makes me want to butcher some meat on your counter tops and I really love your philosophy on waste and your cute cartoon food stuffs. So much that I wish Calgary had a drive-in movie theatre and I could watch your cartoon burger, hot dog and shake dance across the silver screen as they urge me to visit the concession stand.

As for the eating experience itself, choice seems like a good thing, but I asked for Clive sauce and mustard on my burger and I felt like I was biting into a bottle of French's. It also seems to take an inordinate amount of time to get my order from the grill to assembly to that grease soaked bag.

But your fries, I love them and Clive sauce on them, why are those containers so small? Can I get a jumbo side of Clive for my fries.

Your shakes were good too, but I am not loving the burger for the price.

For now, Clive sauce just get in my mouth."}
{"text":"Generally speaking, I'm a fan of classy, high-end restaurants. But sometimes you need a hot beef injection. Even better, a hot beef injection on a 17th Ave patio during Calgary's laughably brief summer. Clive Burger is just the solution. It's a new burger place right beside The Big Cheese. They loves them some burgers. And I love what they're offering. 

The place is very cool on the inside. The interior designers knew what they were doing. The decor is simple and fun, with a massive menu board on the side wall that you read off of. There is a small patio outside, and a small bar facing the patio for some prime people watching. It's licensed as well, so you can get a beer (a cringeworthy $8 for a draft beer) and enjoy the sights.

You order at a counter like a fast food joint, but they give you a buzzer for when your food is ready. The staff was very friendly, though the person taking my order was a little discombobulated by her machine. I had to talk slowly. Chalk it up to growing pains.

You order your burger and as many sides as you want for free. Things like Clive sauce, ketchup, mustard, relish, mayo, pickles, tomatoes, lettuce, onions (fried or not), jalapeños, hot sauce, etc. As tempting as it is, don't go overboard or your burger will be a mess. Unless you're into that sort of thing. The burger was a reasonable $6, or $7 with cheese (your choice of swiss or cheddar).

The food took a bit longer than I would have liked, but it was a busy summer day and the people watching was easily distracting me. While I was waiting, an employee came by and refilled my water without me asking. That was a pleasant surprise. When it came, the burger was great. Juicy, flavourful meat and fresh buns and condiments. Great sauces. The burger was one of the best I've had in the city. It's as good or better than Five Guys but Clive Burger is way more fun and has better ambience, nothing chain-like about it. The fries were done in peanut oil and very delicious, especially when dipped in the free Clive sauce that comes with it. My wife and I shared a $4 bag of fries, and it was pretty huge. One order was definitely enough for two people.

Everything they make is compostable or recyclable, and they shout it proudly from the rooftops. Nice touch. My wife remarked that \"Everyone here is skinny - it's no McDonalds!\". Really good food, really fun ambience, what's not to like?"}
