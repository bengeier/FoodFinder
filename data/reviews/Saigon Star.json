{"text":"Their curry crab is overrated, pricy and sauced to death. I'm not sure why this place is popular. When we went on a saturday night at 6:30, the tables were so squished together, I could almost reach over and steal a mussel from the table over. Maybe I should have since the portions were tiny. Pineapple rice and curry crab seem to be the two of the most popular dishes and both are incredibly mediocre. I can't imagine how much laundry detergent they go through seeing that everybody rubs their bibs and plastic gloves soaked with curry sauce onto the tables. Also see people came here for date night...wow you must really love each other."}
{"text":"People are extremely friendly.. Since I can't eat curry crab, I sat around and watch my friend ate 3...I gave it 4 stars because the price.. My gosh I don't know what we eat but the bill was up the roof.."}
{"text":"The best and most popular dish here is their curry crab.  Pretty much every table orders at least one crab.  It is absolutely delicious.  I love getting roti to mop up the sauce.  It's a pretty messy situation so I really appreciate the plastic gloves they give you to sort of keep your hands clean (I say sort of because the plastic is pretty thin and breaks easily). The best part is taking home the extra sauce to mix with rice the next day!"}
{"text":"Came for lunch, place was dirty, had to beg to place an order for food, 25 minutes later no food and terrible service."}
{"text":"The $49.95 curry crab is nothing to write home about. It's bland and loaded with MSG.  The price for the crab dishes are simply labeled as 'seasonal price'.   The patrons who praise the curry crab are obviously either chinese or white or 'tasting curry the 1st time in his life'  Get ready to be ripped off at this ok ..over-hyped upscale wannabe Viet/Thai fusion restaurant."}
{"text":"This place has been open for years. Gotta try their signature dishes like the curry crab, broiled lamb chops, garlic butter oysters, clams, giant shrimp, and eel. Servers are great as they always remove your dirty dishes and replace with new ones. I've tried this place during lunch as well and their veggies and fried rice/ noodles are top notch. Definitely would recommend this place to anybody- you won't be dissapointed."}
{"text":"Saigon Star has been around for a really long time so I figured it would be a safe option for a a nice family dinner. The first thing we noticed when we sat down was the old and tattered furniture - the paint was faded/scratched and the seats were all ripped up. You'd think they would spare some money to upgrade after being around for so long...   We ordered:  - Tom Yum Fish Soup (large): Generous portion and ample amount of ingredients in it. It had a good balance of spiciness and sourness without either flavour overpowering the other.  - Sambal Wok Clams: These were \"meh\". It's supposed to be spicy but it wasn't at all, and there was a general lack of flavour.  - Pan-fried Lemongrass Pork Filet: The pork was cooked perfectly but there wasn't much of lemongrass flavour.  - Thai Red Curry with Beef Brisket: This tasted good but they were definitely stingy on this dish... barely any meat in it and it was mostly sauce. We ordered roti on the side for this which I would recommend for you to dip into the curry sauce.  - Vermicelli with chicken, shrimp on sugar cane and spring roll: Good but nothing outstanding about it.  - Hot Pot Seafood Rice Pilaft with Curry & Coconut Milk: My favourite dish of the night - it was delicious and very flavourful. The curry and coconut milk made a great sauce for the rice, but there wasn't much seafood to top it off.   Overall, I was disappointed. My overall impression was that the food is average but more expensive then it should be. I'd think twice before coming back."}
{"text":"The raving about the curry crab is for real.  Try them, you won't be disappointed.  The four of us at dinner almost licked the plate clean.  Oh, and do not forget to order the bread to go with the curry - light and fluffy on the inside, crispy on the outside, warm from the oven.  Better than a real bakery.    Beyond the crab, the rest of the food that we ordered was above average good, but not the best I've had.  Sour and spicy shrimp soup (we ordered the fish soup, but they gave us the shrimp on, oh well) was well done but not sour enough.  BBQ pork neck also flavourful but not crunchy enough.  The Vietnamese flour roll was decent, but have had better downtown at Que Ling (where it remains in my opinion, the best flour roll in the city).  Veggies were well done but very salty.    On the whole, however, I would recommend Saigon Star as an excellent place for non-Pho Vietnamese food.  Certainly, I will be back to try their other items."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant quite a number of times. Had the curry crab once, it was extremely overpriced and messy and it wasn't even that good so I never ordered it again. Had pho a couple of times and it wasn't that good either. Also tried their lemongrass beef dish, it was very salty and overly saucy. The only thing that I liked there was the curry roti. The service there is pretty bad especially the last time I was there. The servers are rude and they also lied numerous times when I asked for dessert. I'm never going back again and would not recommend this place to anyone else."}
{"text":"Love the curry crab. Delicious flavor that I can't find anywhere else here.   They've got good lunch specials too for those who don't want to rack up a huge bill. The green curry chicken noodles is hands down my favorite and has amazing flavor without the amazing thirst. Everyone I've recommended so far for the noodles hasn't been disappointed.   Portionsize on the skewers are good too. The chicken ones are exceptionally big but all 3 meat types are very good nevertheless. Satay sauce is yum!"}
{"text":"A no-frills restaurant with takeout, but a good one. Good prices, good food, good service. I like that the subs are cheaper if you do takeout."}
{"text":"Solid, but average compared with all of the options available in Markham area."}
{"text":"rude waitress made me cry and made me so upset and i got up and left. learn some manners and respect. dont start clapping in someone's face to get someone's attention. even last time i went i kept saying no freaking meat and the damn waitress kept on saying why? when my order came it had beef! worst resturant in the world. i hate the rude service and your waitresses ruined my amazing day."}
{"text":"We ordered curry crab, short rib and clam stew. Flavors are very good. More flavorful than Cantonese dishes."}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday...It was busy, but good thing we reserved a spot for 7 ppl. I thought the food prices here are a bit much for what is offering. \"Famous Curry Crab\" for $50!!! A bit much...even for the better than usual curry gravy... Got their oysters that is regular like any other Chinese restaurant. Got their pineapple fried rice, its put in a pineapple, and it tasted a little better than the usual fried rice.   I liked that they have 'kang-kong' which is a unique type of green veggie cooked on sambal sauce... Overall, for this place and the food they are offering, I thought the price is a bit steep, and I'd probably not come back here for that reason. I believe I can get more crabs for $50!"}
{"text":"I went to Saigon Star for a birthday dinner and was surprised at how good the food was. It's pretty clean and the service isn't too bad.  The clams and curry crabs are sooooooooooooo YUM here!"}
{"text":"Really yummy curry crab, it's messy but so good! I could eat just the sauce, so the crab is a bonus. Make sure you ask them for fresh warm bread so you can dip it into the curry. The garlic oysters are really really garlicy. The fried rice was good as well. Everything is served family style so get ready to share!  Watch out for the waiter upselling you on the specials, we had the large BBQ prawn, they were like little lobsters, in size, but they were each $10! Something on the bill that we weren't expecting. What is also neat is that they expect you to have really dirty plates after you've slopped up all of the curry crab sauce so every once and a while the waiters come around and offer new fresh plates with more paper napkins! Fantastic!  Some of the live eels and crabs in the tanks looked a little sad however, but maybe it doesn't matter so long as they taste good once they are served up to you!  It can get crowded and loud and you may have to wait for a table especially if you are a walk-in on a Friday night. But the food is served relatively fast so once you are at a table, you don't have to wait long. There is parking available which I always appreciate."}
{"text":"The foods are okay and very limited spaces. Last time I went there with friends, our dinner bills was over $200 for a group  of 4. This is more like a Chinese restaurant than a Vietnamese one, plus the waiters don't know how to speak Vietnamese at all. The plaza is also small so it is hard to find a parking spot, especially in the evening or on the weekend. Never come back again."}
{"text":"Vietnamese restaurants are a dime a dozen in these parts, so even to merit three stars you have to do something well.  Can they put vermicelli in a bowl with a spring roll and chopped meat?  Yes, but that's a pretty low bar, and they are my no means the Pho king (hee hee). Their wor wonton soup has a strange preponderance of cauliflower, wontons, and not much else. They do attempt to make other different things, but the \"Pad Thai\" was so bad (picture a Campbell's soup recipe for pad thai) that I haven't dared try anything else off script.  If you go, stick to your foolproof vermicelli bowl."}
{"text":"Vietnamese subs aren't particularly cheap, but probably among the most budget items in the area - conveniently located right by Foothills Medical Centre.  Sate chicken and sate beef are both safe sub choices. I can't comment on the other dishes, but based on the constant bustle of people whenever I pop my head in, they must be doing reasonably well.  Unlike home resale values or fine wine, however, these subs don't get better with time. If left alone for a half hour, they will get soggy. Demanding little creatures, aren't they?  $6.50 for one sub."}
{"text":"You must get these dishes while you're here:  Curry crab  Bread and pita Pork \"neck meat\" Lamb chops  Yes, the curry crab is messy. Most people that grew up in Western culture might not even know how to approach the crabs. All my table manners were thrown out of the window the night I had curry crab there. But it's okay, because it's totally worth it. Use the bread and pita to dip into the sauce - it's the best.   If you come here with one other person, just order one (or two) curry crabs with bread, that's it. Let me repeat, you MUST get the curry crab here."}
{"text":"Place is soo chinese... not traditional viet food at all, wouldn't have a problem with it if it wasn't soooo expensive!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here on and off for almost ten years now. What I have to say about this place:  The owner is kinda a stuck up. He caters towards better dressing people or people who looks like they have money.  Don't order pho. The servers/owner give you attitude if you order pho. I don't even know why they have it on the menu if they hate serving it so much.  Their bigger dishes are great. Especially the seafood section like curry crab.   So if you do end up going, order dishes to share. Their food is good, just the people working aren't."}
{"text":"Very yummy! The curry crab for sure!!! Get the roti/pancake or bread to go with the curry! I will definitely go back!! I want some now!"}
{"text":"Heard about this used to be a very famous restaurant with high reputation. However, I had a very poor experience and felt very disappointed.  Knowing that crab with curry is one of their famous dishes, we asked for the price of it (which usually live crab is in current price). A lady server replied that it was like $41 for a dish (instead of calculating per pound, but that's ok), and then corrected that it should be like $45 or $46 but should be under $47... . We were like... what the heck?! We then just didn't bother to confirm the exact price but decided not to order it.  We finally ordered a few other dishes, which were all very popular and common ones. Very disappointingly (and surprisingly in a negative way), the pig neck meat was extremely overcooked (not burnt into charcoal type but very dry and chewy), as it was overly cooked by microwave oven! (I think almost everyone would have such an experience for how the food tastes by that mistake.) The roti (Indian style pancake) was as hard and dry as a dog's frisbee! The pad thai (or phat thai, a very famous and popular fried noodles in Thai style) only tasted tomato sauce but not spicy at all, and the noodles were in overly orange color which not supposed to be.  We told the server that how we thought about the dishes (which was not in serious complaining tone already), she defended that of course the pig neck meat was not cooked by microwave oven; and we should have consumed the roti as soon as possible right after being put on the table, for it will get dried out very easily. I really wanted to tell her that we actually did eat the roti right away (cuz my wife and I love roti very much that we couldn't wait for another second to eat it!) but it's hard and dry that we didn't feel like finishing the last piece so the server thought we have left the last piece cold and dried. We didn't bother to argue any further. But of course, we'll never go back again!"}
{"text":"I randomly walked into this restaurant for lunch one day, and I'm glad I did. They have an awesome lunch special that comes with springrolls, and a soup. I've only been here for lunch and always order the same dish so I'm not sure how everything else is."}
{"text":"Really poor service !!  We ordered curry crab, and it only took about 5 mins from the time we order to the crab actually come to our table.(That's the first dish we had on the table, which never happened in other places) Even worse, the crab was not even hot which obviously indicate that the crab was not made after we order.  For the one crab they charge for $80, doesn't worth at all.  I will NEVER go to this place again !"}
{"text":"Came to this restaurant as a party of 8, you have to make reservation.  Had to wait a 15 min., not  a big deal but I usually expect a table to ready when reservation is made.  The restaurant is a decent size but there's way too many traffic, no waiting area, and all the tables and seats are cramped way too close for comfort.  For some reason, the A/C was off and the place feels like an oven.    Anyways, on the to food.  We tried their famous curry crab, fried black pepper crab, pineapple shrimp fried rice, curry beef brisket, fried tofu, and their appetizer which had spring rolls, bbq curry chicken and vermicelli.  Nothing wowed me but nothing tasted bad either except for the fried tofu (it was SOFT and CHEWY).    Their service was good.  Food came quick and leftovers were cleaned up throughout the meal.  I would recommend this place for groups of 2-4 so that you can get a booth to sit comfortably but then you wouldn't be able to order a variety of shared dishes. =\  If seafood is your thing, there's better places.  If Vietnamese food is your thing, there's WAY better places without the steep prices and wait.  I don't think I'll ever come back again to be honest.   Cheers."}
{"text":"I heard this place used to be much better than it is now.  I come here from time to time and regret it each time. The food is simply sub par. I've had the pho and the curry and am not impressed.  Last time I had the hainanese chicken rice and it was terrible. Oily small serving of chicken, rice was plain white rice and the sauce they served it with was completely wrong! It was some sort of a sweetened vinegar liquid. Everyone knows this dish is to be served with the ginger sauce, hot sauce and the soy sauce! The soup it came with was nothing more than chicken bouillon mixed with water.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"The best curry crab in Ontario, must order the freshly baked bread. The lamp chop and full plate appetizer are another must order for me when I go to this place. It is better for you to come in a large group so you can order more and you will. I will advice to make a reservation during weekend for dinner, but you will still have to wait a little."}
{"text":"The service is really poor. The servant take our dishes away even we did not finish yet. They came twice in a minute to ask did you finish. It is really annoying and disrespectful. And the crab is overpriced. You definitely will get a better curry crab in other place."}
{"text":"I have not visited this restaurant for quite a while.  I went with my family for dinner.  I ordered a platter, lamb rack, curry chicken, pineapple fried rice and cod.  The curry is extremely good.  This restaurant is very famous for its curry, especially the curry crab that I did not order this time.  I recall people will piggy pack just the curry sauce after the dinner.  The lamb rack is better than a lot of the Italian/French restaurants.  It is tender, juicy, well seasoned and as we ordered medium rare.  The cod is average.  This restaurant has maintained its quality over the years.  As it is a long weekend and I expect much less people, I found it is fully packed.  The restaurant is a bit crowded with the spaces in between tables but if you are looking for food, it is a good pick."}
{"text":"Came here late evening on a Saturday night and the place was still packed which is a testament to how popular this place is.  We got to look around and seemed like all the dishes are well presented and delicious.  Live crab swimming in the tanks gave us confidence that their seafood is fresh, and reaffirmed that we should try the house specialty: curry crab.  The curry crab does live up to the hype.  Flavourful and meaty, finger licking good. There were two of us, and with one order of crab and one order of bread, we were fully satisfied. The crab was huge and the meat was easy to remove. The bread is a must as it is warm and soaks up the sauce nicely.    Suggestion: if you do order the crab and want to also order other dishes, get the other dishes either before or after the crab, as it will take a while for the crab to be finished and the other dishes may get cold by then.    Service was pretty good for an Asian restaurant as well.  They've got servers and bus boys so requests were met quickly.  Our glasses of water were always full.  Excellent experience overall.  Warning though, the crab can get pretty messy so don't order that on a first date!  5 stars and looking forward to trying the other dishes (but I know I probably won't be able to resist and will order the crab again)."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times with my family for dinner because we all agreed that this is probably the best vietnam and Thai restaurant we've known with great quality seafood!!!!! If you love seafood you have to come, as well if you love curry !!!! I recommend their curry crabs of course. And, I recommend their baked oyster."}
{"text":"Thai and Vietnam appetizer platters were good for sharing, everyone got to try a small piece of everything.  Roti: BAD, dry and oily, they re-heat the roti, for sure they were not freshly made! They were HARD to chew even after dipping into the curry sauce; they were still tough.   pineapple fried rice was average better than their pad thai. They steamed the crab first then put the curry sauce on top of it... it wasn't the type of curry crab we used to have.   no, i will not recommend this restaurant to my friends and family."}
{"text":"Ordered 24a - Tasty rare beef curry. Bit spicy, nutty, Thai/Asian. Not too greasy and plenty of steamed veggies & rice. Lots of cold beer imports - Hit the spot!"}
{"text":"Went here last night - wow the quality of the food blew my mind!  The curry crab was so good - we got a whole crab for the 3 of us which was more than enough.  The roti prata was really good and came fresh.   Also loved the chicken satay (loved the peanut sauce) and pineapple fried rice (shrimp was so good)!  I'm definitely going to put this place on my favourites and come back everytime I visit Toronto."}
{"text":"Like many others have said, the curry crab is amazing!  So flavourful - cooked perfectly.  You can really taste the natural juices from the crab - it's not overpowered by the curry sauce.  Definitely need to order the roti to soak up on the sauce.  I went in November...seasonal price was about $60 for a crab.  The Thai chilli prawns were pretty good as well.  Definitely would order it again.  The reasons I couldn't give 5 stars.  Big time up selling!  He keeps listing off things we should order - even after we've ordered 5 items for 2 people.  Also, the pineapple fried rice and curry pad thai are awful.  The shrimp in the pineapple fried rice are big and look great.  However, they are not fresh at all.  Bite into it and all you get is a mushy texture.  Yuck!  The curry pad thai was dry and void of flavour.  The only thing you can taste is the heat from the spice."}
{"text":"Great curry crab, although a little expensive. Good with Roti as well, although I feel like it was better a few years ago. Lunch specials are a good deal and quite filling!"}
{"text":"It was really quick to get in and have our food ready. The food was not very flavourful unfortunately. The bubble tea was good."}
{"text":"Everything is awesome. From pork neck to curry crab. From clams to salad. Go to place for a good seafood dinner.  Need reservation. Always busy"}
{"text":"This is my first time going there and will also be my last time. The teapot that was brought to our table had curry sauce on it. The satay chicken skewer was at room temperature when it was brought to us.  I will not go back for sure."}
{"text":"Must try curry crab and roti to dip in curry sauce!!!"}
{"text":"Saigon Star is one of my favourite places to go for Curry Crab!! It is THE best!! I suggest to order a side orders of  crusty bread to slop up all that delicious Curry Sauce. It's so delicious.   We ordered the set Dinner for 6. The Charbroiled Oysters with Garlic Butter... so impressed by the size and freshness of the Oysters. Grilled Honey Pork Neck ... flavourful and tender. We also added a side order of the Vietnamese Grilled Lamb Chops which I highly recommend.   This place has been around for a long time. If you havn't been ...do give this place a try!!"}
{"text":"Grilled jumbo shrimp and the BBQ pork jowl was good! The curry crab with a side order of bread and roti was good if you eat it right away, while it's hot!!! Service was good! Waiters were friendly and frequently changing up a new plate, which was good! Overall, messy but worth a try!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here recently. Ordered salad rolls which were very good with excellent peanut sauce. Banana bubble tea with pearl which was also very good. However the wor wonton soup was disappointing, a few mushy wontons, 2 shrimp, couple pieces of over cooked chicken, some cauliflower and broccoli and loaded with cabbage. The broth was weak. I always judge a new restaurant on how good the wor wonton is, Saigon Star did not pass . There are better places in Calgary for wor wonton such as August Moon and Thai tai on 17th ave"}
{"text":"Like the curry crab and the fired rice.  The sauce is tasty, good with the rice and bread. But better go with a group of friends."}
{"text":"totally agree with a lot of the comments here... its a good restaurant with very interesting and tasty dishes. Service is really fast considering it was packed when I was there.The pho...iv'e had better.. perhaps trying to have chinese, thai, vietnamese, malaysian in the menu is just too diverse. Other purely \"pho\" places are definitely better...  the curry crab seems to be the go to dish here... most of the diners had that at the center of the table and it looked really really good... slurp slurp"}
{"text":"Food is too salty / burnt (WAY TOO EXPENSIVE) and service is terrible.  the lamb and shrimp was burnt and ridiculously expensive.  the waiter kept pushing me to order more and wouldn't take no for an answer.  after i ordered a few dishes and i never kept count we asked the waiter 3 times how many dishes did i order and he wouldn't tell me! he just kept saying oh you didn't order much. just a few appetizers. and kept trying to sell me more dishes. it ended up i ordered 14 dishes and he kept telling me it was very little and that i only ordered a few appetizers. (AS A WAITER ITS YOUR JOB TO TELL ME HOW MANY DISHES I ORDERED, not to just ignore my question and try to rip me off more.)  i was charged $65.70 for 6 pieces of \"big head shrimp\" (he recommended it and i never asked the price \"stupid me) and $46.95 for 1 crab (waiter asked me 3 times to order 2 crabs cause he said 1 wouldn't be enough for 6 people? and finally i paid $49.90 for 10 slices of lamb (i ordered 1 but he kept pushing me to get 2 orders cause he said 1 would not be enough)  the waiter was laughing after i paid the bill of $370 for 6 people  my advice is when you go just be careful not to let the waiter try to rip you off by recommending things on the menu that have a seasonal price *unknown price*  i felt like i got scammed walking out of that restaurant. i don't recommend the food was too salty and burnt and i don't recommend their deceiving service."}
{"text":"The place was empty when we walked in but filled up pretty quickly. We ordered off of the lunch special menu, which is reasonably priced at around $9 each. Unfortunately, the food was disappointing. The lemon grass chicken had more fat than meat. The red curry was a little better but nothing special. Very, very few vegetarian options and they wouldn't substitute the chicken-based soup.  Also, the piled-up crabs in a tank in the corner of the restaurant made me feel a little sick. We won't be returning."}
{"text":"Don't go there to order chinese food. Go there for the crab. The curry crab could be spicier and with more varied flavours, but overall, it was cooked to order, moist, and delicious."}
{"text":"Been to Saigon star a dozen times, mostly for dinner and twice for lunch.  This place get busy quick at night and the wait time can be long.  Remember to make reservation if you planning to come here during the weekend.  The Curry crab is the best I had, remember to order some bread with it.  The Pad thai is okay as well.  Only thing I do not recommend is the pho from this place as it is not the best.  Other than that everything else I tried so far as been stunning."}
{"text":"This place certainly lives up to its hype! I came with 2 other diners for lunch and the bill was racked up to $140. A bit expensive, but mostly worth it.   We ordered a lamb rack, clams, curry crab, Asian pancake, veggies sautéed in shrimp paste and a bowl of noodles.   The lamb was tender and delicious. Two pieces were a bit more cooked than my liking but nonetheless still tender and very flavourful. The dish came with six pieces. Next came the clams. Wow, I never see such full looking clams at an Asian restaurant. They were definitely a good size and had tons of meat on them. The dish was delicious. Curry crab was definitely my favorite. The curry was so flavorful with just the right amount of kick. The sauce was amaazingggg. I used the pancake to dip the sauce. There was so much sauce in it that we took it home after. I would definitely be back for this crab!   Service was like any other chinese/Vietnamese restaurant. Is it authentic Vietnamese food? Probably not. Seems more like a cross between good quality Chinese food with good quality ingredients and Vietnamese styles."}
{"text":"2.5 Came here one late night with my boyfriend because we wanted to try a new pho place.  Nothing memorable about this place except the lighting. They've spent money on the lighting which is nice. It almost looks like a lighting store rather than a restaurant."}
{"text":"A very average Vietnamese restaurant. We've been  back for abuse several times...simply because there aren't other vietnamese restaurants in the area. The miserable, poker-faced proprietor/owner looks like an Asian reincarnation of \"Mo\" from TheThree Stooges. Never an acknowledgement when we arrive or leave. The service is perfunctuory, but quite prompt. The food is average...but if you love Vietnamese as we do...it'll do with no alternatives. The crab referred to by others...is great...but not only messy...but disgustingly unhealthy in terms of lipid content.  As for cleanliness...this place is filthy. Despite a bizarre and random Reno about 5 years ago ... The biggest problem is the filth. The floors leading to the washrooms and all surfaces in the washrooms are a microbiologist's utopia. Much safer to invest in a Package of Depends for your party!"}
{"text":"This place was a food frenzy!!! I'm glad we went as a large group and experienced a variety of dishes. Th first thing that comes to mind is how fresh everything was from the sauces, rolls, noodles and the crab! Even the smoothie were fresh and light tasting !!  We had the pineapple rice, clams (my fav was the black bean), we had a platter of apps but the The show stopper was the curry crab!!!   It was mouth watering and eating it was fun. Out came the glove and the tools to snap the shells. After everyone was dipping or pouring the curry sauce on everything: rice, roti, bread, vermicelli, etc   The service was quick. Those guys move fast to Bring out the dishes and to take away the empty ones too.  The turn table was a lifesaver and an intelligent idea.   My least fav was the bean soup.  Parking was easy and the place was easy to find as well."}
{"text":"The Sub was decent. But Do Not buy the bubble tea. The Taro was absolutely disgusting and inedible, it was powdery and artificial tasting and the jelly's were hard and disgusting like they were incredibly old.  Was disappointed"}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch at Saigon Star recently for the first time while having a craving for some Pho. A busy little spot in Stadium Shopping Centre, Saigon Star features the typical Vietnamese fare you'll find in most places. I think that the Pho is good with an uncomplicated an light broth with some generous toppings. I do like the fact that the Saigon Star Pho Special (Dac Biet) is not shy with the bits I like in Dac Biet, being tripe and tendon.   The most aggravating thing about some Asian eateries in the West is when they make the assumption that a diner will not like a dish the way it's intended, so they hold back. As a restaurant owner myself, I understand that, but also take the time to talk to someone that might have apprehension on a certain ingredient. A little information beforehand can save a lot of heartache, and in most cases, show a diner a very positive dining experience encouraging exploration and discovery. Ok, enough of that.  I love  Pho, I enjoy bubble tea (which they also make), and banh mi. Saigon Star is a great place to get them all."}
{"text":"Very good curry rice ans satay skewers at reasonable prices (but some things can get a tad expensive). Too bad it's a bit too far from where I live.  Quality: 8/10. Services: 7/10. Value: 6.5/10. Overall 7.5/10 (Not an average)."}
{"text":"Curry crab is No.1, but the accompanying roti is even better. This is a place I go once in a while (just for the curry crab). The garlic oysters are also good."}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to try the curry crab here. Just like everyone else says, it's to die for but damn is it expensive! The other food we ordered, a clam dish, veggie dish, beef dish and noodles were all flavorful and plentiful. OMG the bread, mind you I'm not crazy for bread normally, was sooooooooo good! Came out warm, crusty on the outside and soft on the inside. It's the same buns used for viet sandwiches but I've never had them so fresh. So perfect for mopping up all that curry!"}
{"text":"Alright where do I start? The curry crab was good, the lamb was good, the platter of Vietnamese sides was also good, and the overall service good. Recommended!"}
{"text":"I concur.  The curry crabs, mango salad and spring rolls were really good.  I unintentionally left a nice mess for the waitress - curry crab sauce everywhere. haha.  She wasn't impressed but my stomach sure was satisfied.  Oh btw - I've got to mention that the atmosphere was modern and clean.  I'd be scared with those suede seats they've got decked out.  I'm surprised they're weren't any curry crab stains.  Or, maybe, I'm just super messy.  hahaha"}
{"text":"We went to the restaurant ordered a clam and curry crab. There is much more shells than meat for the clams. The curry crab wasn't fresh and super scrawny. We complained to the manager/boss, his attitude was horrible. If you don't order a crab, they don't give you free dessert and argue with you the dessert cost money. If you want to eat curry and a crab with very little meat, then please go! The service was horrible too!"}
{"text":"Curry crabs are totally yummy and worth the trip all by itself. But the other dishes are great too - the sour/spicy fish soup, BBQ-ed oysters, lamb chops, and stir fried morning glory when in season. Oh, can forget to order the fresh bread to mop up the curry sauce, or the Vietnamese style coffee.   Services are not bad, but sometimes you get a waiter/waitress who tries a little too hard to up-sell. Just smile and ignore and stick to what you want to order.   No, definitely not a place to order Pho, that should be left to one of the many Pho restaurants in Toronto."}
{"text":"5 star for curry crab. 3 star price. 3 star for selling overpriced items like lamb rack and oysters and jumbo prawns. I'd only come here for the crab. Everything else is overpriced. If I could get the crab elsewhere I would."}
{"text":"I had to update this review for my second visit... not such a good one. When I walked in, I should have walked out. There was only 1 other table occupied, the carpets were filthy and all I could smell was Javex - I think they wipe the tables down with this?  I took a seat and that is about where the service stopped. I was never checked on, my dishes stayed on the table long past my being done eating and was charged this time for a cup of tea. This usually comes free at other Pho places I have been to? I had the satay seafood Pho with shrimp only. The shrimp were not properly cleaned and their feet and tails were dark to the point of black? Old? I could not eat most of them due to this discoloration but even with what I did eat, I had to head straight to Shoppers for Pepto tablets. I pointed this out to the server who just brushed me off. One had to listen to 2 sets of music - one terrible collection of music for patrons and another equally bad station for the kitchen staff. Won't be fooled again. Take your service somewhere clean and delicious with staff who care, even a tad.                             ."}
{"text":"Not a big fan of fusion restaurants.  From the moment we arrived at the restaurant we felt like we were being rushed.  There were lots of empty tables with reserved signs on it, I guess it is a popular place.  To me though, the Hainese chicken and rice was nothing special, we ordered the vietnamese appetizer plate but it didn't seem authentic to me.  I guess I'm used to the vietnamese places in Boston, it's all about the authenticity rather than the packaging.    I wish we ordered the curry crab, which seems like the thing to get, but at that point we just wanted to eat and then go.  The place filled up quickly and it just feels too crammed inside to eat comfortably.  We didn't want to hang around too much and take up their few available tables.  Rush rush rush."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite Vietnamese restaurant in the GTA. Their specialty dish is an amazing curry crab dish that is worth getting your hands dirty. Also, they have a wide variety of other vietnamese dishes that are great as well and it is definitely worth the drive to Richmond Hill."}
{"text":"Saigon Star is a great restaurant for large groups. Although customer service may be inconsistent at times, it is a great place to celebrate special occasions with family, friends or even colleagues. My favourite dishes include:  Grilled Honey Pork Neck Meat ($13.95):  The thinly sliced tender neck meat is glazed with a thick honey sauce. I have been to restaurants that make it difficult for me to identify the type of meat I am eating. For this specific dish, the sauce is only glazed on the edges of the meat, allowing me to appreciate the natural taste of the pork.   Sautéed Curry Crab (~$40.00):  Saigon's signature dish is its Curry Crab. The restaurant consistently serves large and meaty crabs to its customers. My favourite part about this dish is its sauce - rich, smooth and thick, making it a perfect dip for the crab meat. A good pairing with the sauce is a white baguette. Saigon's baguettes are the typical looking $0.50 supermarket baguettes; however, they are crisp on the outside, fluffy and soft in the center.  Vietnamese Style Grilled Rack of Lamb ($18.95):  You might be reluctant to order a rack of lamb at a Vietnamese restaurant. Do not fright foodies because the rub on the lamb is savoury and aromatic. This dish comes with five medium rare lamb chops and a light minty sauce. I recommend you to try the sauce even though you might prefer the natural taste of meat. Saigon's minty sauce is an exception.  Tip: If it were not for these three items on its menu, I would not be a loyal customer. Unfortunately, this place does not specialize in pho. Looking for good pho? Try V.I.P. Vietnamese Restaurant in Markham!"}
{"text":"Food was probably more of a 2.5 for me but the service was amazing. Super helpful staff. We were in a large group and they were patient with us and attentive.  7 of us shared the 8 person meal - and it was barely enough food. The french seafood soup was very creamy, it tasted unique but not my cup of tea. The lamb was very tender but also VERY salty. Had to order a white rice to eat with it. The famous curry crab was ok - would've been just as happy with just the curry sauce and roti without the crab. I didn't think the curry sauce tasted that unique. The grilled lobster was really good, probably my favourite dish of the meal (came with 4 lobsters, halved so each person gets one half lobster). The veggie dish was good. Eel had nice flavour but too many small bones for my liking!"}
{"text":"I come here at least once a week.  It's one of the cleanest viet restaurant on the hwy 7 area.  However, the service is usually pretty poor, so don't be surprise ;)  And don't forget to order their curry crab!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We went to the restaurant and ordered curry crab and several other dishes on the side. Food was sub-par, dishes were reasonably priced except the $69 curry crab which was severely lacking in meat. The restaurant is clustered from front to back, with the waiting area where they have overflowing seafood in tanks directly in front of the bathroom. The dining area itself was crowded to the point that I could feel other customers hitting my chair constantly as they sat down. Extremely rude service and poor attitude even for an Asian-owned place as the waitresses were uncomfortably pushy and just dumped dishes onto our table. They even forgot to give us the crab cracker or plastic gloves to eat the crab with. No dessert provided and one waitress even had the gall to chase us as we left the restaurant demanding for MORE tip. Absolutely disgusting. Won't be going back for sure and I recommend you all not to go either."}
{"text":"This is always my go to place when I'm out eating with my parents. They love the curry crab - that's pretty much their staple.   Everything is pretty good too, I had the clams which was meh. Their drinks are also kinda below par. I think if you were to just come here for the crab and the vietnamese lunch I think it would be good. Otherwise, if you just want a simple vietnamese place - there are better choice out there.   Oh and make sure you get the bread to dip in the curry! Soo soo good!"}
{"text":"Actual rating is 3.5/5. Came on a Saturday night. Restaurant was about 60% full.   Food - 4/5 We usually get 2 curry crabs for takeout but decided to dine in. We ordered the Vietnamese platter and curry lobster this time instead of the crab, just to change it up. The platter was very good and reminded me of authentic Vietnamese cuisine. My only complaint is the Viet ham, which I feel they cheaped out on and bought a cheaper brand. It wasn't very good, which was somewhat disappointing because I love Viet ham. The curry lobster was very good. The curry colour seemed a bit darker than when you get curry crab and flavour seemed a bit more concentrated. The lobster was cooked well. The presentation of the two dishes boosted my appetite as well.   Service - 3/5 The restaurant closes at 11, and we got there at about 9pm but I felt like they kept rushing us to order like they wanted to close early or something. Two other parties came in after us too... After the server gave us the menu, she asked us if we were ready to order literally 2 minutes later. We said no, then the owner came by and asked us another 2 minutes later... and we were still not ready. Very annoying. Other than that, service was fine, I guess.   Value - 2.5/5 The seafood depends on market price, which I understand could change daily. However, at 9pm, with almost all other tables with curry crab on their tables, you would think the waitress would know the price off the top of her head. She said she had to ask the owner, which makes me feel like he just makes up prices depending on the customer. Anyways, eating seafood at a restaurant is never cheap so I give it a 3/5 for value. There was not enough curry saucr on the plate so I'm taking away 0.5 from the rating. Portions are decent though. I probably won't ever dine in again, but will definitely continue to order their curry crab for takeout. It is their most popular dish and for good reason."}
{"text":"The food and staff were good but it's not authentic Vietnamese enough for me.  Tried ordering some normal Vietnamese dishes but ended up getting very good tasting fusion chinese/Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"My new favourite restaurant. A place to bring your friends and family if you want to impress them!   Their food is amazing ! It's flavourful without the MSG like a lot of Chinese/ Chinese fusion restaurant would have.   I love their variety and they don't cheap out on the ingredients with the dishes they bring to the table.   Seafood bisque soup - delicious ! Don't know how to describe if. Almost like curry texture but not as thick   Chicken skewers with peanut sauce - so good so good! Great appetizer. If you re a fan of skewers and peanut this is the dish for you.   Lamb chops - extremely tender and moist.   Gigantic baked oysters - firstly did you see the size of them ? Mouthful of oyster meat in every bite, extremely savoury  Chicken skin appetizer - didn't think chicken skin can taste so good till today   Fish - blacked fish ? Can't remember how it was cooked but it was crispy on the out side because of the fish skin and soft and tender on the inside   Deep fried Vitanamnese spring roll - I would come here just for this if not hungry. Never had a spring roll so full of stuffing and so good !  Seafood fried rice with curry sauce - must get. Very different from other fried rice. Almost like a French fusion vitanamnese fried rice  Curry crab - ultimate dish. Also their signature dish. Their curry is made extremely well. You can dip the curry with the complimentary roti or bread ! Must try if you re coming here and if you want to impress your guests.   Lychee coconut slush - really good ! Not too sweet, yet could taste the fruity goodness.   Vietnamese coffee - a new authentic experience to drinking coffee   This restaurant can cater up to about max 12 guest per table so it'll be a great place for large family dinners as well as for special occasions.  I enjoy the atmosphere of the restaurant. The waiter and waitresses are polite and nice. They are children friendly and provide high chairs for the families who needs it.   My only regret is not knowing about this restaurant before and missing out on this great food !"}
{"text":"Not bad, but also not amazing. The curry crab was interesting but not my favorite. Pricey and packed. Be ready to wait."}
{"text":"There are not that many components in Bun Ga Xao Xa (Rice Vermicelli with Lemon Grass Chicken), so what is present needs to be stellar. At Saigon Star, stellar is not an adjective that I would use to describe the food.  Food, cold. Too much lettuce and not enough peanuts. And if the chicken was even in a room with lemon grass I would be surprised because the chicken had absolutely none of the lemongrass flavour.   The only part that I even liked about this place was the music that they were playing. The synthesized versions of old western tv shows was sooo wrong it made me smile."}
{"text":"This isn't authentic Vietnamese food. More like Chinese/Vietnamese fusion. They have some dishes that can almost pass as being from Congee Queen.  Their service was decent, not overly attentive and kind, but you quickly get served when you are hungry.  They get plus marks for their humongous portions. Probably can feed two people with one of those noodle dishes. I didn't like the chicken they used for the salad we ordered to share, it was gooey."}
{"text":"Saigon Star is known for their crab so we definitely ordered a few variations of it. I have been here in the past and really enjoyed their curry crab, but this time around the quality of the food went down a bit. We ordered the curry crab which lacked some flavour, although heavy as a sauce, but something was missing in terms of taste. Needless to say, we also got he drunken crab which I preferred this time as it was stewed and the vermicelli/ glass noodles within the stew soaked up all the sauce.   Their appetizer platter had a good variety of their apps with spring rolls, skewers, sugar cane shrimp, and Vietnamese ham. The spring rolls were nice and crispy with a balanced filling. The ham tasted like your typical Vietnamese style ham. The peanut sauce with the skewers were well flavoured and tasted peanuty as it should've.  Overall, service wise was ok, but can be better. Food is not as good as it used to be, but acceptable. At least the seafood was meaty!"}
{"text":"So my stomach is a fickle thing. Last night, it's all: \"Oh no you're too full, put that curry crab down, you never want to see curry in your life.\" Then this morning, it's all \"GET MORE CURRY CRAB NOW.\" I guess that's a testament to how good it was. Saigon Star was the setting for the 3rd event in the Asian Sensation CMYE series (Thanks for hosting Amy!) and I was able to meet some absolutely lovely people while we dug into a colourful Viet/Malay feast.   Everyone keeps talking about the curry crab so naturally we got it but damn, $129 for two crabs!! You'd think these crabs were covered in gold. But no...just metaphorical liquid gold: in the form of delicious, delicious curry. Sop all that goodness up with some crispy buttery roti or buns. Gloves and clamps were provided.   The clams were another highlight for me. We got the lime chili clams and the chili black bean sauce clams. Both were amazing. These were meaty clams, still in the shell, covered with some amazingly flavoured sauces. At $12 a plate, this is a much more affordable seafood alternative.   The pineapple fried rice was actually kind of bland but it's served in a pineapple! Anything served in fruit is suddenly 10x more interesting. Speaking of fruit: avocado juice. GET IT. It's the perfect accompaniment to curry and spice. Seriously.   Service was actually very good (we did order a lot). Even though our group was pretty big, they were patient with taking our orders and splitting our bills. Our plates were constantly exchanged for clean ones. When it came time to packing up the boxes, one of the waitresses made sure we took the extra roti/bun home. This is definitely a more upscale version of the typical Viet/Malay places in Markham and the service reflects that.   This place is an establishment. I remember seeing commercials for it on the Chinese channel from when I was just a kid (with really crappy animations). And yet, I've only been here once and that was more than a decade ago. I asked my parents about this and they said it's because the waiters were too pushy with the expensive items. Fair enough.  (38/100) - 2016"}
{"text":"I agree with another reviewer that it is not worth it for $100+ for 2 people. I suggest coming here in a larger group, order the curry crab as well as the other dishes cause it's just as delicious!  I absolutely love the curry crab! The sauce is amazing! Perfect with the warm bread / roti.   The other dishes they have to offer is very good also."}
{"text":"I've never been disappointed at a meal from Saigon Star. My family and friends always come here to enjoy their Vietnamese food and one of their specialties the Drunken Crab with Garlic Butter. You need to try this dish if you are a seafood lover. It has beer, garlic, butter and crab and is delicious.   Their satay chicken or beef and the peanut sauce is also very good. We also tried their short ribs this time and the plate was empty by the end of our meal. The green beans with garlic dish was also cooked perfectly.   They have a lot of great lemongrass, curry and traditional Vietnamese dishes as well but, I highly recommend the Drunken Crab on your visit. Their service is good and they never disappoint on the quality of their food and dishes."}
{"text":"Their curry crab is to die for :)  Grab some bread for dipping and do not forget to order the Emperor Rolls, deep fried and crispy.  All of my friends who I have brought here keep asking when we are going back.  Next trip is planned for next month."}
{"text":"I dont know what the hype is about the food was good but not the best obviously the best dish is the curry crab and pork neck. Definitely not your average Vietnamese restaurant has more creative dishes and worth a try but wouldn't come here regularly."}
{"text":"Come here for the curry and the crab of course.  Had curry brisket was very good with the right amount of spice. I got a side of French bread and it was toasted to perfection crusty on the outside and soft on the inside. Also got salted tofu which was great dunking in the curry.  Didn't have the crab this time around as it was $40 a pop, all best on market price so ask in advance."}
{"text":"Overpriced. First off, I'll say the service here is great. All staff is courteous and efficient which made the experience pleasant. The food was good, I especially enjoyed the pineapple rice which was not only flavourful but had a great presentation. I wasn't big on the curry crab. It was way overpriced and wasn't very enjoyable. While the meal was decent, the menu prices exceed its quality and should be adjusted otherwise there are plenty of authentic Asian options with a bigger bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying, the service was phenomenal and no other vietnamese/chinese establishment has ever left me so happy with the service. With a big group of 13 beautiful people, we sat down to enjoy a feast.   I had called to reserve and the gentleman was super friendly (you know how you can tell their tone from their voice?) and when we got there, we were seated right away and they even told us we can move to two tables instead of one if we found it to be too squishy. We decided to sit at one, which held our party perfectly. We took a little longer to order because of different preferences of 'food-sharing' and we were not rushed at any point. When I ordered the platters, I didn't particular like the idea of 'chicken feet' and she was quick to offer me a bunch of items that I can switch it with for no additional cost. How sweet!   Our food came and it was a beautiful, gorgeous feast! The curry crab that our party ordered was AMAZING. Huge and even thought it was over $120 for two, I think it's worth it to try. Having only tried the roti dipped into the curry part of the crab, I can stand witness to the fact that the curry was indeed delicious. The roti, although buttery and worth every bite, was so pricey! While the bread was cheap af, the 4 orders of roti could've ordered us another plate of appetizers and more. I guess that's what yelpers do.. we don't inquire about pricing and instead hop straight into eating. The mixed veggie fried rice, which was my main entree, was deliciouso. Perfectly cooked veggies and lots of carbs makes a girl happy.   We took awhile splitting the bill and they never lost patience with us and even made gestures to help us pack up everything to go. Also, they treated all of us to their dessert - this traditional red bean pudding. Not my thing, but it was definitely nice of them."}
{"text":"Everybody is raving about the curry crab but tbh I thought the pork neck was the star of the meal.  They didn't have one of the clam dishes I wanted, unfortunately.  But halfway through the meal, they said their supplier just delivered some fresh clams.  Note: This meal was actually one of the most memorable of my trip (I'm writing this review almost half a year after my Canada trip.)  **They give you plastic gloves and bibs to eat the curry crab :)"}
{"text":"Food here is excellent, you must try the three following dishes:  Curry crab 5/5  Pineapple fried rice 4.5/5 Lamb chops 5/5  The curry crab is flavourful and messy so wear an old shirt and be prepared to get your hands dirty. They give you gloves but they are flimsy and the curry will soak right through. We also ordered roti to dip in the curry sauce.  The pineapple fried rice is a solid fried rice by Chinese fried rice standards and it comes in an actual pineapple which makes for impressive presentation.    The lamb chops were surprisingly juicy and flavourful, I would go back just go eat them.   We ordered an 8 person set meal for roughly $300 + tax and tip.   Minus 1 star because it's a crowded restaurant and spacing is tight. It's also difficult to find parking on plaza level. There is an underground free parking lot, but I have not tried there so I cannot comment on the spaces available."}
{"text":"The quality of the service hasn't changed much since the last time I was at Saigon Star - probably because the same servers as last time are still working here! We came in during lunch on a Saturday afternoon and the restaurant was quite full. The restaurant was understaffed and as such, we weren't given the best service. Service was overall, non-existent. We were put in a corner where the sun kept beating down on us. We asked to change tables because of this but we were told to simply pull the shades down - fine, it helped, but we still felt hot af because we still felt the heat from the sun. They could have also agreed to have moved us to another table too rather than ignoring our request. We weren't served tea when we sat down. It took a while for us to finally get our orders in. We weren't given the customary side plate of raw bean sprouts and lime when we got our pho bowls. It also took a while for us to pay our bill because none of the servers bothered to look for us until my dad finally had to get up from the table and ask for the bill. As for food, the food itself was good. Wasn't spectacular but good nonetheless. The curry chicken pho that I had didn't have as much chicken as I would like and the broth was kind of watery but overall, it was okay. Would I come back again? Maybe. Perhaps when it's less busy."}
{"text":"Get the curry crab!! With extra roti on the side because you'll need it to sop up all the extra sauce leftover from the crab. The roti is what stands out the most for me, aside from the crab. It's made fresh in house and always very flaky and buttery. After you're done with the crab, dig into the pineapple fried rice for some more carbs! Everything else on the menu is pretty standard for a Vietnamese restaurant. The portions are large enough that you'll be stuffed if you order 4-5 dishes for a group of 6-8 people.   The restaurant is always packed whenever I go on the weekend. I have been during both lunch and dinner and, fortunately, have never had to wait for a table but there's always a bustling crowd inside. If you have Service is quick but not the friendliest.  Parking can be found at the lot right outside. The restaurant is one of many restaurants in a plaza."}
{"text":"Curry crabs are ok but lacked the spice and punch. At 59 CAD for 2.5 lbs it is quite pricey. Pork neck is good but serving is not so much.  After trying the food, I'd prefer to go to Chinese resto for chili garlic crabs.   At any rate, worth a try but quite expensive.   Yang chow rice was ok. Congee Queen has better yang chow.  I would still prefer Chung King at Market Village right behind Pacific Mall."}
{"text":"Terrible. I have tried ordering from them a few times now and each time has been inedible. This time I ordered lemongrass chicken on vermicelli and the chicken was rock hard and grayish in color! The spring rolls were cold. They also charged me $7 for delivery, I live less than 2 blocks away."}
{"text":"Bustling on a Thursday night, Saigon Star was the champ of the plaza. Lovely decor - classy and yet casual. My family and I headed here as it seems to be the only place to offer curry crab (or crabs in general, actually).   It was my dad's and little sis' birthday dinner and boy, did we go all out. Curry crab (I used this curry on their delicious bread + everything else imaginable),  fresh shrimp mango salad (absolutely adored this!), veggie spring rolls (LOVE),  veggie platter (a beauty),  sambal wok clams (saucy!), coriander honey chicken (so utterly tender),  malaysian wok bean stalk (mmm, flavourful),  pad thai noodles (staggering portion),  charbroiled shrimp on sugar-cane (interesting appetizer) and finally,  beef noodles a la saigon star (this was only okay - I've had better :P).  I swear the food came within ten minutes - one after the other, it was an unceasing onslaught of sheer gloriousness. The Mun Bean + Red Bean + Coconut crushed ice drink came almost immediately. Really tasty stuff.  Saigon Star was a winner. Not only is its service prompt and friendly... more importantly, the food was colourful, light and //most definitely// flavourful! We also received a complimentary dessert on the house. Some sort of sweet taro bowl w/ clear tapioca! YUM!! :D"}
{"text":"Had curry crab for my birthday here.  It was delicious!  Remember to get some bread to sop up the curry.  Everything else looks good, but the two of us could only finish the crab.  I'm glad we didn't order another dish.  It would have been cold since we spent all of our time cracking crab."}
{"text":"Came here for mother's day. We ordered the infamous curry crab - it was $75 for ONE crab. Was not worth it in our opinion. The dish itself was decent tasting - curry was rich and flavourful (reminds me of Khao Soi in Thai food), but was not worth $76 for sure. The stirfried clams were around $12 and there were so little of them. Their pineapple fried rice is delicious but again, small portions. Overall, in my opinion, this place has pretty good food but is wayyy overpriced."}
{"text":"First off, Let's talk about the food and service. We made reservations but I didn't understand the point of that because we made reservations for 7:30pm but didn't get a table until close to 8pm. So reservations probably didn't mean anything to them. The door,  waiting area, was crowded, people were coming in from the front and back door.   Food: curry crab is very yummy, satay grilled chicken kabobs, veggies with garlic, green curry, grilled oysters.. food is up to par...both times**  Service was the part that seriously upset me. First experience, waitress was super pushy which made me feel uncomfortable. Second experience, were quite rushed to leave. Food came super fast and I felt like being watched to eat..once we finished the food, someone came to pick up our dishes. This is not a place for you to sit down to enjoy food and have chit chat still for more than 1 hour restaurant. You come here for the food...eat and leave...  Tables were squeezed together with close to no space between tables to either walk and/or going to the washroom.   All in All, this place is an A-OK for everything put together...Yes to the food..No to the service!"}
{"text":"I was very disapointed. For a vietnamese restaurant, I had high expectations when I ordered a virmicelli bowl with grilled chicken for dinner. The noodles where unusually fat. There were no fresh herbs in the bowl. The chicken was not char grilled--in fact, it was teriyaki chicken... not sure why they even put this on their menu, it was so sadly sub par. Even the imperial roll was below average. Would not reccomend."}
{"text":"Tasty Chinese food but not authentic Vietnamese and did not have a wide variety of Vietnamese food. Should not be named Saigon Star it is more Chinese than anything else. As for the Thai food the curries are very watered down and bland. Would not recommend the Vietnamese and Thai  but the Chinese food was very tasty."}
{"text":"The Pad Thai was way too sweet and Heavy. I would stay away from that dish. We tried a unique and fun dish (24A) which comes with meats and veggies and rice paper so you can create your own rolls. Tons of fun. The meat on the other hand wasn't so great. The BBQ Pork tasted very processed and the beef had no flavor.  I will return and try the Pho and Subs. I have a feeling these Vietnamese staples might be the heart of their business and be better quality."}
{"text":"The curry crab is a win - it is warm, creamy and full of flavour! The dish itself is heavy so I only indulge in it once in a while. Also I feel like I can taste the MSG - our whole table was thirsty and lethargic after. The pork neck was so good as well. Ask for the roti to come out with the crab, sometimes the roti comes before and becomes hard and not so yummy!  Oysters were a little salty - they were OK. Probably won't order them next time."}
{"text":"It's been soo long since the last time I came here, I don't even think yelp existed at that time. A craving for curry crab brought us here. The place was busy on this Friday night, we still waited ten minutes even though we made a reservation in advance.  We ordered the samba fried clams, curry crab, fried small lobsters, lamb, and fried string beans. Everything was delicious. The prices are on the high side, but it's OK to indulge every now and then.  People mentioned the lamb was really good but I thought it was just average, not sure I would order it again. The curry crab was the best and the sambal clams were very tasty also.  The waitress changed our plates often and have us new utensils halfway through. All in all I think it was great service and great food. I'd definitely go back for the crab."}
{"text":"Classic Yelp save.   Looking for a good meal in a part of Toronto I was unfamiliar with.   Walked up and it didn't look like much from outside...Check.   Bustling inside with a huge crab tank with spectacular looking live Vancouver crabs...Check.   Only white people in the place...check.   A great a meal with a rare combo of comfort classic Vietnamese food with a huge seafood menu wiith Crab a half dozen ways.  We went Drunken Garlic crab and never looked back.  The Bun was fantastic as well with real deal refried imperial rolls, not the imitation egg rolls you usually get, and top quality pork.  The spicy fish was nice as well but I'd recommend trying other things  Great find, thanks Yelp."}
{"text":"If anyone likes eating curry crab or grilled lamb, I would strongly suggest Saigon Star.  The price of the curry crab is very expensive, I must say.  Always different every time I go there with friends or family, they call it \"seasonal price\".  Every time I visit Saigon Star, I would always be curry crab with bread and grill lamb, the other food on the menu, I would not even recommend at all.  The Vietnamese cold platter was terrible.  The spring rolls was not fresh, the thick noodles (aka banh cuon) was as hard as rock, satay chicken have not satay taste at all.     Overall, I would give this restaurant an \"OK\" since there famous curry crab and grill lamb was so tasty, but all other dishes at this restaurant I would not even try it even if it's FREE !!!"}
{"text":"It has been a long time since I visited this restaurant, so it was a nice surprise to find the food decent and services friendly.  We ordered the following dishes, and to be honest they were all pretty well done.  -Vietnamese Platter-Spring Roll, Rice Crepe,Satay Chicken, Pate & Sugar Cane Shrimp -Sambal Wok Clams -Thai Red Curry Beef Brisket Pot (I wish the curry was hotter) -Pineapple Fried Rice (chicken & shrimp)  Will definitely come back and try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Our last dinner in toronto this year so we decided to try Saigon. Loved the curry crab and satay chicken. The roti bread was good with the curry sauce. If u like Vancouver crab u need to try this place."}
{"text":"Not your typical vietnamese restaurant at Saigon Star, but more like an upscale asian fusion. A little on the pricey side, but delicious. You pay for better quality and taste. Their cod fish is to die for. Service is ok. The waitress did forget one of our order, but it was fine, since we were already full."}
{"text":"This is a must for our group when we visit Canada! Always the first dinner to start off our five days trip here. We consider it to be one of the highlight, and a big reason for us to take a trip that required an eight hours drive.  Reservation a must, they are always packed. As usual, we order our favorites, which are so many. The grilled pork Neck, steam shrimp rolls and short ribs to start. The new set dinner menu for ten was perfect for us, every dish was what we would had order ala carte any way, and it would've costed more. Lobster, lamb chops, oysters, eel,fried rice,every single dish was perfectly prepared with the freshest ingredients.  Their signature curry Dungeness crabs was spectacular! Can't wait to be back next year!"}
{"text":"Amazing place.  Get the tomyum soup, curry crab, and lamb.  Pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"I used to live in the area, and unfortunately the pho here isn't too great.  The soup was mediocre at best, the noodles were the flat thick kind, and meat was so so.    Sorry, would not recommend this place for pho."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for many years but unfortunately after my last visit I won't be coming back.   For dishes I love to get, I recommend getting the following:  - Curry Crab: if you like mild curry, you'll love this  - Honey pork neck: very juicy and tender and comes with a bit of vermicelli  - Tom Yum Soup: not very spicy and very flavourful  - Chilli Sauce Clams: not spicy either, so good!  - Fish Maw soup (Vietnamese is called soup bong bong ca): one of my absolute favs!   I usually get the Curry Crab (which they are very well known for) because the sauce is so addicting. Very creamy sauce which tastes great with bread, roti or rice. Unfortunately during my last visit, I didn't feel to good after the curry crab and neither did the rest of the party. We all ended up getting upset stomach afterwards (which has never happened before). Very disappointed in that    The main reason why I won't be coming back is because of the service. We made a reservation for 6 but only 5 showed up, the owner did not look to happy. You could see it on his face, we ordered and we felt like he kept pressuring us to upsize and order more, even though we did not want too. While we were eating, we could feel Him just stare at our table which really made us feel so uncomfortable. The last few times I came, my table was given dessert meanwhile my table was not given dessert the last time. I find this to be very weird as it doesn't seem consistent. It seems like it is given to certain people. I am particular annoyed by this as it doesn't seem fair   Overall, I am very dissatisfied with my last visit. My bill was about $180 for curry crab, honey pork neck, Tom yum soup, chilli sauce clams and a few loaves of bread. Seems very overpriced for what your getting"}
{"text":"I must have over reacted a bit last time with a 5 star review. When I went back for a second time it was probably just as good but I just wasn't as impressed as last time. I just think I am spoiled with all the other foods I have been eating as of late. Ordered the Vietnamese yellow curry chicken again for $11.95 and added the flat bread for $4.50 which came with 3 small flat breads. The curry was really good and came with huge pieces of dark meat chicken which could feed 2 or 3 people.   Also tried the small pork neck dish for $8.95. Its listed in the entree section but I thought it was more of an appetizer. The meat was so soft and tender and it had a nice sweet sauce to top it off.   Also tried the pork chop and fried rice lunch special for $7.99. It came with a small soup and a deep fried spring roll. Its good value if you are on a budget and everything was quite good. A bit on the small side but perfect for those little ladies out there with tiny appetites.   Also got a fried noodle with chicken and shrimps for $7.50. Nothing worth mentioning here as its pretty standard and you can find this at just about any other Chinese restaurant.   I would say everything is as good as last time but I am only giving 4 stars this time because I think I was just overly impressed the first time since I only had to share my food with one other person last time. I got to eat so much the first time but this time around I had to share with more people so I got to eat less. Still a great place for some good food."}
{"text":"Let's be brutally honest : without the chef, this place is doomed.  It's not hard to see why.  This place has gone down in quality over the years.    Somehow, over the last year,the space has gotten dirtier, (you can tell by the tanks used to house all the crabs for their signature curry crab), the space has gotten more cramped, and the prices just got steeper.  I think it's general consensus that the service has miles of room for improvement.  I won't go so far as to say it's atrocious and comparable to a Soviet era prison, but it begs the question : how hard does the chef have to work to keep these people in business?  That question is easily answered : and the answer is, it varies.  Some people absolutely adore the hard work the chef has put into it.  The love it so much they can ignore the fact that they are hardly sitting comfortably.  I almost managed because that's how amazing the rack of lamb is.  The comfort level isn't just isolated to seating, even standing or walking is difficult.  The store hasn't gotten changed much since its inception back in the early 90's, but they've managed to find an excuse to squeeze in a lot of gigantic tables, making it more and more cramped and more and more difficult even for their own staff members to walk around.  How have they not violated a safety hazard for that?  That's a recipe for trampling!  On the note of rack of lamb, here's an interesting story.  There were 3 people at dinner today including myself, and seeing that there's 3 of us, and the rack of lamb comes in a set of 5, the server asked if we'd like 6 pieces instead of 5, so each person can have 2.  We answered yes.  While it was delicious and just mindblowingly good, I can't help but realize, we had to pay $29 for that.  That's almost $30, meaning it was about $5 for just one piece.  That price was not that steep last year, but I understand, times have changed, but I guess that's one thing I'll think twice about before ordering.  $30.  You could get a decent meal for that price for my party of 3 at most places.  So, at this point, you might be thinking : \"This is the n-th review about this restaurant from another snarky Yelp-er who's clearly upset about the ambiance and service.  Maybe it's better to just not put ourselves to this.  It's not worth the steep prices if you'll be treated terribly in a terrible environment\".   Well, don't hold off just yet.  I'll do the most cliche thing and suggest that you try the food.  Why is it cliche?  Simple..all the other reviews written about Saigon Star have said virtually the same thing : the food is pretty decent.  Is decent worth approximately 20-30 percent more?  That's entirely up to you.  My suggestion is, it's worth a try at least once.  The food does get here pretty quickly, and it just goes to show how well the kitchen works.  That kitchen, houses the most underrated team in the city, and it's great they're still pushing out amazing food at a great pace.  That gigantic banner inside the front door that advertises it's crab?  That part is still true.  Of course, if you can just ignore the dirty crab tank near the door, it'll taste even better.    So yes, the management and staffers are ruining the restaurant, but that's what makes this business so interesting.  People will always come back for great food, in spite of the price and service.  That might be a key indicator of whether or not you should return."}
{"text":"This is a fusion restaurant which I didn't know before hand and had I had known before, I would not have gone.   Saigon is a fusion of Thai, Vietnamese, Malaysian.... I thought I was doomed....     -The curry crab was very good! they scoop out all the crab brains and cook it into the curry sauce yum!   You can order hot toasted bread to eat with this dish ( I think it is a must you do so), the hot bread in that curry sauce is a marriage made in heaven!   I also saw roti on another table that could be an option as well.     -Garlic oysters was a bit oily but i enjoyed it.  minced garlic & spiced baked on top of a big meaty oyster, what's not to like?  -Malaysian stir fried \"oong choi\"   the vegetables were fresh and young and they didn't over kill with the Malaysian sauce which I find many restaurants do.  Win!  -pork neck meat - not an appetizing name but it was an appetizing dish. tender meat not too fatty, flavorful.  - lamb chops, tender, fragrant, not too gamy, good job.  -Clams stir fried in spicy sauce - this was a good dish, however for the price the dish was too small, very few clams, minus 1/2 star for that.  A little too much corn starch but the flavor was there.  Most of these dishes came with Vermicelli and usually in Vietnamese restaurants it is a filler could be used in lettuce wraps, however these dishes did not come with any lettuce and no sauce so it was just the meat and the vermicelli, with no sauce eating the  vermicelli and a small piece of meat didn't have much  flavor, minus half star.  I took pictures of everything I ate that night, please take a look!  All in all this is a good restaurant and I do recommend it."}
{"text":"Wow, came back here for my birthday and didn't disappoint!  Curry Crab was so delish that I'm craving it now!  We had a full day of meetings and didn't stop for lunch so it was even better.  Last time I was here it was $40 for a smaller crab and $45for a larger one.  Tonight they only had one size for $45.  Not a cheap man's meal but so damm tasty!"}
{"text":"Horrible take out experience. Glued together pho noodles that would not come unstuck even after stirring it in boiling soup. Meat was over cooked and tough and taro spring rolls were hard and over fried. Not a fan. At all."}
{"text":"Used to love this place but the quality have gone down greatly. What even worst is the owner only see customers as dollar signs"}
{"text":"I had the worst service ever here. The food was decent, curry crab was good but everything else was either salty or just decent.  I was recommended by friends to go here and I can't say how much I regret this and I will never go there again.  When we first ordered, the waitress was already very pushy with recommendations. We turned down clams and she continues telling us to order them. We had 7 people and ordered oysters, veggies, pork, beef & 2 crabs. We asked for water and never got it till the second time. The veggies took the longest to come and it came wrong. We asked the waiter to take it and he took it without saying anything. However, the original waitress came over and complained about us ordering that when we clearly did not ask for that type of veggies. She continued trying to push the dish on us and told us to just order the one we wanted as additional. We were like what?! You made the mistake, we don't want this. So she finally went to make the correction.  When we had enough, we just asked for the bill. The other tables around us who left just a bit earlier got desserts but we didn't (as I'm guessing we returned the wrong dish, they didn't want to give us anything). When a friend asked a waiter why we didn't get it, he just ignored him and walked away.  Due to this horrible service, we decided to not tip but in the end just gave them $2. The waiter who came to get the visa machine was like tip is SUPPOSED to be 10%. We were like it's not mandatory, especially for the service we got. He was like but the other waitress already changed your dish for you. But that does not make up for the horrible overall service, then the owner comes to yell at us telling us that he did not charge a service charge and that WE SHOULD pay 10% tip. What kind of restaurant demands a 10% tip? We argued for the service we received, no tip was even earned. We left but we can hear him complain in the background to his more nicely treat clients who were 'regulars' as there was OBVIOUS bias treatment to them.  NEVER GO THERE. If you don't mind BAD service, go ahead. The crab is worth eating but not for the treatment they give you."}
{"text":"We came here with family we visited in Toronto.  Apparently this is one of their favorite places and I can see why.  This place calls itself fusion of Vietnamese and Thai but I feel like you could throw in Chinese in there too because some of the dishes definitely had elements of all 3 regions.  We started with some good smoothies (mango-strawberry) which had a nice consistency (not too thick/thin).  The Vietnamese platter (spring roll, rice crepe, Satay Chicken, Pate) was good.  The house specialty curry crab was good too and if I had more room in my stomach, it would've been nice to sop up the sauce w/ the bread they give you.  The rack of lamb was also well cooked and I enjoyed the light sauce that came with it.  There was a seafood hot/sour soup that was unlike anything I've had before (in a good way).  Check this place out!"}
{"text":"Come here every time when I travel to Toronto, but this time the service and food are getting worse then before. I guess I will have to go to try another restaurant who make the curry crabs from m the area!!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was 1/4 full, around 6:30. I went there by myself. I told them I'm here by myself. The staffs around the bar are talking to themselves and dont let me in, all they said is 'One person? No!'. How much time I can spend there? maybe 20 minutes. by that time it's not even the busiest hour yet. Poor attitude."}
{"text":"So delicious! And quite reasonabley priced for authentic food! They have both vietnamese and thai food and give quite nice portions I've had the pad thai which is quite large and very tasty the green curry chicken is also SO tasty... a perfect amonut of spice in my opinion (not too spicy to burn your mouth off!) i've also had the tom yom soup (could've had more shrimp) and the lemongrass beef noodle soup (i actually put a bit of the tom yom soup in my bowl with this soup to give it some more kick) but the soup is really large and full of noodles and other yummy things also tried the beef satay which comes covered in sauce ( something i love!) i think they put crack in their food because I can't stop thinking about it  ...in the past week, i've been there twice! next time: MUST try the curry crab.. a bit on the pricey side ($40 when i was there) but def seems worth it! DELICIOUS! and quite nice inside (many times these authentic restaurants are more dingy or not done up as nicely but this place has nice chandeliers and a trendy decor)"}
{"text":"Pork neck meat and Curry crabs with nam bread are a must. Unless you don't like curry. I came here with my boyfriend for dinner. We only ordered this two dishes. It was soo much food for 2. The crab was fresh, we ordered the smallest one.  It's not the meat that filled us up but the sauce. Dipping the nam bread in the sauce was the best thing. Who cared if you were using your hands. Note: It's at least $40 for just the curry crab."}
{"text":"Note: This rating is just for the Viet offering of this restaurant. A Chinese food review could have been different but since I did not try any of those dishes this is all that I had to go by...  I think the name here is a bit deceiving because even though it has \"Saigon\" in it, this place was more of a Chinese-pseudo Vietnamese cuisine. I had been a tourist in the area and wanted to try authentic Vietnamese food and Pho and I chose this place because it had the most number of  ratings and positive reviews.   However, after we sat down we sort of regretted it because it's not really the place to for what I had in mind. Also, the Viet food itself was mediocre and had a lot of ingredients substitution.   The first clue is that everything on the menu was in English with English descriptions, nothing written in Viet or Chinese. We ended ordering what we think was Pho but it was called more like \"noodle in beef broth\" and my hubby ordered a version of the vermicelli noodles with grilled pork. They substituted the noodles, spices in my soup was different too. It didn't have the Pho smell. Overall, the piece wasn't bad, I think we had two lunch entrees for $15 and they were nice enough to accept half American and half Canadian money.   I think if you are a Westerner, it probably wouldn't make a difference because the food isn't bad, but if you are an avid Viet foodie, you can skip over to a more authentic place over in the next plaza. Be careful though because there are a lot of Chinese/pseudo Vietnamese eateries in the area. I'm not sure if it's entirely possible to find an authentic Viet place in this part of town but you can try, just be on the lookout if Pho is listed as \"Noodle in Beef Broth\" or something like that. If you want a tip: go to the Old Chinatown part of Toronto, there is more legit Viet menus there."}
{"text":"I am a little undecided about Saigon Star, but what you need to know foremost is that the food is flavourful and the portions are generous.   With that said, you will pay for it. We had a crab curry, rice and one plate 93 of spring rolls and it came to $98. The tea was complimentary. We found it expensive. The rice was good and the spring rolls quite original (for me). They are much thicker and starchier than the average spring roll one gets anywhere else.  With that said, the curry crab was delicious, plentiful and the crab was large and obviously fresh. In fact, they fished it out of the dirty tank moments before it was served to us. I am a hypocrite and I know it, but hopefully my hypocrisy propels me to make better choices in this world going forward. I felt very sad for the crab. The manager promised us a big crab and he was true to his word and he picked a big one and we could barely finish it.  Going back to why I am not giving them a better rating the tank, washroom and floor were not as clean as a restaurant should be. They need to clean. There is an attempt at a modern atmosphere, glass drops hanging from the ceiling and dark panels on the wall. Slightly strange was the Cheers-like artwork of Caucasian folk on the wall, which felt out of place in a Vietnamese restaurant, and the sound of the always annoying Mariah Carey/Whitney Houston repeatedly coming out of the speakers. How about some Vietnamese music instead?  The second reason (after hygiene - OK 2,5 with Whitney Houston shattering sonic thresholds) that lower my opinion of the restaurant is that the staff and customers are speaking in Chinese. They may be Chinese-Vietnamese possibly, but I always feel that the food is inauthentic if the staff do not speak the language of the food's country of origin. It is like all the Koreans at Kushi Sake Bar, Menami or AYCE sushi restaurants, you know?"}
{"text":"I hate to ding small, independently owned restaurants, but two stars is about right for Saigon Star.  We ordered two dishes -- pho, and charbroiled pork on rice. I thought the pho was fine, although my wife (who eats more pho than I do) said that the broth was underdeveloped, and the noodles were \"weird\".  The pork was remarkable in its skimpiness. There were about fifteen thin strips of pork, averaging maybe 5 cm x 2 cm x 2 mm. It was, if we're being quite generous, about as much meat as a McDonalds' hamburger -- not a Quarter Pounder or a Big Mac, but one of the cheap little burgers that you get in a Happy Meal. (This is the first time I've mentioned both McDonald's and pho in a single review.)  It would be one thing if these dainty little strips of pork were intensely flavorful, but they weren't. I have to be honest and say that I didn't walk out of the restaurant hungry, but I didn't feel particularly full either.  Unremarkable food in remarkably small quantities means two stars in my books."}
{"text":"Was driving by and decided to stop in for some takeout.  First impression was this place is extremely dirty.  Floors are gross, tables not properly cleaned, crabs stuffed in an aquarium that's filthy, and overall very old.  Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I'm shocked i haven't reviewed this place.  About a decade ago, i was introduced to this gem of a restaurant. Since that day, no other curry crab in the world has been able to compare (ok I haven't been to Singapore or Malaysia yet).    You can come to this restaurant and experience it in one of two ways - as another Pan-Asian restaurant, or as Seafood heaven. The prior comes with a smaller price tag, the latter requires you to spend some money.     My order is pretty standard here - the biggest crab they have in curry (don't even bother with the other styles of preps) with steamed rice and roti (if we're doing it - we're doing it right). Along with this, an order of rack of lamb, an order of grilled jumbo prawns (thankfully they get them from Vietnam now and not Japan anymore) and baked oysters.   There is a large menu otherwise, so lots to choose from, but these are definitely the dishes that stand out.   Be prepared though - things are going to get messy.   If you're expecting excellent service here to match with the pricing - move on - this place isn't for you."}
{"text":"The issue I had with this place is they claim to be a Vietnamese restaurant, yet no one there speaks Vietnamese and their menu is not in Vietnamese. It is basically Chinese people hijacking the name in order to sell you something. I took off a star because parking was difficult to find. And I took off another star because the food was good, but a bit pricey. No issues with their service or the and aesthetics. And they seem to be doing well based on the amount of people that were there."}
{"text":"I had the famous curry crab, chili paste clam and some pancakes. The clams were very flavorful and delicious. The curry paste was great but the crab that night was not very fresh... It had little meat inside, and I felt like I paid for mainly the shells and the curry paste. That one crab was worth $64.95 (seasonal pricing)! Clam was more reasonably priced at $12.95."}
{"text":"I only go here for the curry crab and sometimes lambchops, everything else I can get at another chinese restaurant for cheaper and better taste.   Seasonal Price for this summer Curry Crab is $64.95: the sauce is just soo good, with a bunch flavours all combined it's delicious with the bread or roti (doesnt come with the crab which i think should if youre paying about $70 for just the crab. extra charge of $4 i think for bread or roti)   Server was this cute little asian lady who was very attentive and friendly. You dont get that kind of treatment at chinese restaurants normally so thumbs up :)"}
{"text":"The only thing I enjoyed here was the curry crab, everything else was subpar, the shrimp and lobsters were overcooked and dry, Definitely just stick to the curry crab if you come!  Also it was extremely pricey, I don't think it was worth the meal even after exchanging usd!"}
{"text":"I and my staff often order food here. Very fast, efficient and professional on handling and delivering food. They always give decent discounts. I would recommend it for people looking Vietnamese food. I always love to order salad rolls and their delicious peanut sauce and the special Beef noodle soup. Will definitely go back and order again."}
{"text":"While looking for a place to try seafood, we were directed here by some friends of ours. It was about 4pm and the restaurant was empty but most of the tables were booked for a later hour.  To say that this was a great experience is an understatement. The service is spot on, we were served promptly with everything we needed without asking too much: they saw that we were 6 and one teapot was not enough and they immediately brought another; they recommended all the popular dishes and answered all our questions with style; they changed our plates as soon as they were full of remains.  In terms of food, we all got appetizers and entrees. The food was great, it is rare that we enjoyed all dishes without having the smallest complaint. We ordered 2 types of crab (curry and pepper), tom yum soup, pepper tofu, bbq pork neck, garlic butter shrimp, pineapple fried rice and 2 types of rolls.  In conclusion, a very good place and highly recommended. We'll go again to try the lamb."}
{"text":"I often mention how Toronto is home to waves of immigrants. I admit, I'm fascinated by the changing character of our neighbourhoods; how communities get a foothold downtown and migrate up our main arteries into the suburbs. The trek from Spadina and Bathurst to Bayview and Highway 7 is an example. Jews, followed by Chinese and now Vietnamese owners have made their way North. Saigon Star was one of the first outposts of this migration; an attempt at upscale Vietnamese dining. It's new, and delicious.   If nothing else, Saigon Star merits a visit for it's superb Imperial rolls. Steroidal cousin to the common spring rolls, these monsters lie within a slightly sweet, chewy-crunchy blistered yellow wrapper and contain a mix of ground pork, veggies and taro. Wrapped in leaf lettuce and dunked in thin sweet-sour-fishy sauce, they're uniquely good.   Shrimp on sugarcane is similarly excellent; light shrimp mousse wrapped around sticks of sugar cane, they inherit sweetness and texture from their time in the fryer.   Starter soups are fine, but miss the boat. If it's lunch time you're a fool if you don't go for pho. A chicken and lemongrass version features fragrant broth, perfectly chewy noodles and expertly poached white meat. Sprouts, herbs and lime provide additional layers of flavour, mixed in just before you inhale the lot.   Beware \"special\" beef pho; ordered one day, you get a gloriously spicey and rich red broth, loaded with shaved raw beef that languidly cooks in the bowl as you eat. Another time, you get the 'real' version; tendon, tripe and all. The latter's broth is also good, goosed as it is with cinnamon and star anise; but I admit that I'm not quite hardcore enough for the extra textures. If I'm going for straight-ahead beef noodle soup, I tap out at rare beef and dense, sausage-like meatballs. Portions are big enough to share.   Similar noodles reappear in Bun platters; lukewarm noodles served with fresh and pickled veg, and your choice of fixin's. Grilled chicken or pork are safe bets. Well-marinated and addictively smokey, they're a great contrast to the starch. Hint: you can get one of these meals with the above-referenced spring rolls and shrimp mousse. Do it. Do it now.   Mains are good, if a bit sweet. Cho Lon noodles reflect Chinese influence. Barbecue pork, fat shrimp, scrambled egg and a sauce that echoes pad thai, but with greater depth of flavour.    A variety of curries deliver subtle heat. If you're a spice addict, try to flag down an English-speaking server (although they're pretty rare). Don't try this with the manager. He's an angry, angry man.  Remember expense account dinners? Yeah. Me too. If you're lucky enough that you can drag a business associate to Saigon Star, do some serious bonding over the drunken crab; a giant whole crustacean slightly cracked and bathed in an addictive mix of butter, garlic, beer and spices. Served alongside rice/roti/baguette, it's so good that the perfectly cooked crab is almost an afterthought. Almost. Order extra napkins, and a bib, and maybe just wear clothing you don't mind throwing out post-dinner. It's an unholy mess, but like most things unholy, too good to resist.  Dessert is available, but Vietnamese iced coffee is crack-tastic. I've never tried any illicit substances, but this is what i imagine they must be like.     Mmmmm. Vietnamese Iced Coffee. i need one. Now."}
{"text":"Been here twice during my lunch breaks. With respect to the location, it is clean and head a nice atmosphere. Right now \"never going to give you up\" (Rick roll song) is playing behind me which just makes it more enjoyable and casual to have lunch.   Food wise, they naturally they give decent quality green tea. I ordered the Vietnamese imperial spring rolls and the beef a la siagon star pho. The spring rolls were awesome, tasted legit Viet (few places have this done well) and the pho was tasty pretty good flavour. Only thing they include that I don't eat is the tofu. Bleh. But that isn't a factor in my review.   Only reason they didn't get a 5 star with me is that I would have to constantly wave then down and I'm about to write this entire review while waiting for the bill. I think they may have forgotten, but it's okay.   I would recommend going here, good experience."}
{"text":"This is restaurant that my family and I visits at least once every 2-3 months.  Now as a vietnamese restaurant your pho must be AWESOME and in this case it is =P That's why we often go back.  The soup base is rich but not overly intense.  The veggies are always fresh and so is the noodles.  You can really tell if you haven't pho / Asian soup noodle for most of your life.  Definitely a must try if you never had pho at a non franchised viet restaurant north of the city.    While you are there, get a papaya smoothie and if the pho doesn't fill you, go for the chicken hot pot rice! SO GOOD and flavourful.    Now the sad part.  We always wanted to try their curry crab and since it was my mom's Bday last week, we decided to give it a shot.  It was late into a weekday evening and we were super hungry and seeing crab and chicken hot pot rice would usually take longer to cook then other dishes we ordered it immediately (without asking for the price).  The food came and as expected, YUMMY!  Crab came with fresh thin pieces of bread and to my surprised plastic disposable gloves (for those who don't like to get their hands all curry'ish loll)  When the bill came there was an item that came to $60.  Taken a further look, it was the curry crab.  I immediately asked the waitress, is this a mistake?  We ordered 1 crab ...  And my parents jumped in asking what's the weight of the crab.  She answered just about ~ 1lb.  but it's not charged based on weight, it's per crab.  Ok guys, i'm definitely not cheap when it comes to trying out new taste, but $60 for a ~ 1 lb crab?  At #FishmanLobsterClubhouse they charge \"Lobster ($17/lb) and King Crab or Vancouver Crab ($45/lb)\".    Lesson here is ... ask the price before ordering.  We deserved to be charged double / triple for what's worth, but maybe you can get a deal if there were more patron and it's not a weekday?"}
{"text":"I was taken here for my birthday dinner by my wife and other family members.  This was not my first visit but probably will be my last visit.  Let me start off the review by saying that the service we received by everyone at the restaurant was superb. We arrived on time for our reservation and was seated immediately which was great. They were all very attentive and very helpful.  They saw that our table was too small for our party of 5 so they asked if we wanted to move and we did.  We thought that was a nice gesture on their part without us asking.    Where it fell short was the taste and the pricing.  We ordered the combo meal for 6 which included a soup, grilled pork neck, curry crab, a veggie dish, baked oysters and clams (it was supposed to be eel but we switched for clams).  Then we ordered jumbo prawns which was 13 bucks each!  The prawns tasted great but not sure if it was worth the 13 bucks each though.  We also ordered the fried rice inside a pineapple which wasn't anything special except the appearance.  Everything tasted very mediocre and the portion size was kind of small for what we were paying.  In addition, everything seemed very overpriced.   By the end of the night we paid close to $400.  For that price you can be super stuffed at other seafood places."}
{"text":"Simply masterful.  Curry baked crab ordered with a side of fresh baguette (to soak up the curry sauce), grilled lamb chops on a bed of vermicelli.  Both are signature dishes and have not lost their high quality over the years.  Other dishes we ordered were incredible as well, but the curry crab is what keeps returning customers over the years.  Since we do not live in Canada, this was almost a pilgrimage of sorts (13 years in between visits), and we cannot wait for our next visit."}
{"text":"The lady who served us had a bad attitude and the food was okay but not as good as other Vietnamese places"}
{"text":"I visit Saigon Star again because of the Pho-bruary. This review is regarding their Pho.  I can tell Saigon Star did not put in much effort in preparing their Pho at all. There is no depth in their broth at all. Just some soup based laced with MSG. There is only 1 size $6.50 for the lunch order. I would said that it is a medium size when compare to other restaurants. The noodle is fresh noodle. I have a piece of lemon instead of a lime....  I have to say this Pho is a Cantonese version of vietnamese food.   My advice is NOT to order Pho if you go Saigon Star!"}
{"text":"Service is horrible at this restaurant, but the food is good enough that it makes me come back every time I visit Toronto for the abuse. I always feel like they're trying to rush you out (i.e. giving you the bill once everything is served). Once they even started to clear the table as some of my party was still eating. It was kind of awkward, so I wouldn't suggest taking people you want to impress to this place.  With that said, my favorite is the bbq pork neck, satay, and curry brisket. The curry brisket has the same curry base as the curry crab, but their crab is a total rip off. We always get it with the naan or the french bread. Yum!"}
{"text":"Rip off  They are playing disgusting game of giving you variety of change and you end up with less then they own you.  My experience: Takeout order: $7.99+tax=$9.03. gave $20. the change given $9.95 before tip. $1.02 stolen. its just a small gesture but make a difference when you pick a place next time.    Never again."}
{"text":"Carb quality is not as good as beReally disappointed with the crab!!! The crab is so thin with little meat. It is not justified for the price $70. Never come again .... Really no good !!!"}
{"text":"Saigon Star is an okay place to eat.  I've tried it a couple of times because it's near me, and haven't really been satisfied after.  They have subs, soup, noodles, etc. - much like any other Vietnamese place.  I tried the beef noodle soup and it was pretty yucky.  The noodles were soggy and the broth was cold.    If you're not looking to leave your house, they also deliver.  I've had subs delivered, which weren't quite as good as the ones you buy fresh... I just like that they delivered.  It seems like the prices are a little expensive for the quality of food too.  If it were cheaper, it would make more sense to me, and I wouldn't feel as bad buying from them.  As it is, the food isn't that great, and the prices are too high.  If I'm in the mood for Vietnamese, I'll go the extra mile to Saigon Y2K... which is literally only a mile away."}
{"text":"We came here with a couple of friends for a weeknight dinner. Fortunately Saigon Star is open until 11pm. The food was great. Everything was very tasty. We started with the oysters, which were encrusted with garlic. Then we had the curry crab. Not only was the crab good, but the curry was yummy. You'll want to get a roll of bread to soak up the curry. We also ordered the clams, yellow curry with chicken (more curry!), and a vegetable dish.  Probably the best curry in the GTA so far."}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY?!  The curry crab and the black pepper lobster!!!  Known for their seafood here, especially the signature crab. Get ready to have your hands get messy. They have Vietnamese dishes that are marinated and barbecued in their lemongrass concoction too. The curry crab is my favorite dish to order here though! Love the curry sauce and how there's so much curry sauce left over to eat with white rice or a baguette.   Food comes out relatively quickly and the service is great. We also ordered the oysters with minced garlic and butter as well. They come out pipping hot! This is a great option to order too.   The rack of lamb comes barbecued in lemongrass marination. It doesn't taste gamy at all and barbecued just right. It's not overcooked and inside is very tender.   LAST TIP?!  Order some baguettes to dip the remaining curry sauce. Nice crunch to go with the curry sauce. Don't forget to stay for dessert too. There's complimentary dessert soup made in house every night to finish your meal!"}
{"text":"Two words: Curry Crab!  I go to Saigon Star every once in awhile, but this was my first time having their House Specialty Curry Crab, and it was absolutely amazing! I could not stop slathering that delectable curry on everything else I was eating... whether it was spring rolls or fried rice. The baguette is heavenly and soaks up all that golden delicious goodness.  Everything else was also very good. The honey grilled pork neck meat had that luscious fattiness that really satisfies. The Vietnamese spring rolls here are also very good, and I always get them to share.  The Vietnamese coffee is also very good, but it takes forever to drip! So make sure you order it early in the meal (and not at the end, like we did, which meant we were sitting there gazing at every drop).  All in all, a great place to dine with a large group! I'll be back for the curry crab."}
{"text":"my distant memory of it from couple years ago was only an \"ok\".   went there during my visit even though there are plenty of vietnamese food in boston bc i got attracted by their gigantic poster-sized pictures of food, one of which featured the REAL vietnamese spring rolls with the \"rice paper\" wrapper.  ordered one, and to my disappointment, it didn't look like those on the poster pictures. they use the normal, crunchy, cantonese wonton wrapper instead. *sigh*  can't remember the food being super good or super bad; they were about what vietnamese food/pho should be. however, did remember leaving with a bad taste in the mouth bc of their service. either bc the staff was unresponsive, got wrong order, or downright unpleasant.  so, yeah, with that many choices in toronto, don't see why i need to go back.  btw i thought this restaurant is in Times Square? maybe they've moved in the last couple of years? they might have coz the decor Adrian K. described sounds nothing like the one i know (the one i went to looked very old-school). i hope they food and service had improved since then, and maybe there will be a second chance. lol."}
{"text":"They have really great lunch menu sets to choose from; Vietnamese, Thai, Malay etc.  Definitely try their specialty drinks such as ice coffee and 3 coloured drink!  They're famous for their curry crab!"}
{"text":"This is where my family and I go when we want to have a really good meal. We tend to only go when there are a lot of us so that we can share a lot of the dishes - sort of like a not too expensive special occasion place.   Like everyone else, we love their curry crab. Delicious! Their French bread is also crusty on the outside and airy on the inside - a perfect complement to the crab. Prepare to get messy though, if you're having the crab! Definitely not first date food.   Their slushy juices are also delicious. We love the mango, papaya, and a pink one that I think is guava.  I've heard good things about the avocado smoothie but I've never wanted to deviate from my fruit options.   The dishes are great too - charcoal grilled pork neck, nam yu sauce grilled chicken, this garlicky oyster dish (can't remember if it was grilled or baked)... Only thing I don't love from there are the assorted appetizer platters because I don't like sweet fish cakes. Oh, and the stir-fried clams are also so good!  Would highly recommend for large groups."}
{"text":"The curry is totally worth the hype. A little pricey but I took the sauce home and made another meal out of the delicious curry sauce :)"}
{"text":"People come here for the curry crab.  The pricing on it fluctuates so much, I can't figure it out.  I remember once it was around $50 - years ago and now it's around $80.  It is good but I'm not sure what we are eating sometimes, are we having the curry - as there were really no real crab bits to eat and the legs are hard to crack.  If you are counting calories, this is not the food for you as it is really rich!  If you have it with their roti - add another bazillion calories.  Again...it is good though!  Not sure if it's worth the $80 for a single crab.  Other things on the dinner order was the kang-kong vegetable (or is it tong-choi), and chicken curry.  The chicken curry was hit and miss - one time, it was to die for and then the last few times - meh.  After coming here off and on for a few years now, I only come when I hang out with people that want to try the crab.  There are plenty of other places to go for viet/thai cuisine.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Curry crab. Roasted lamb. You can't go wrong!   Everything was SO flavourful, it's crazy. Honestly I miss uptown Asian food since living in downtown Toronto. I didn't think I would!  You can ask for gloves when you eat the crab. The curry tastes AMAZING with their pita bread. It's like made for each other. I ate so much of that.   The other dishes were okay. Saigon Star has about the same flavours no matter what dish you order.  Service is super quick. They're nice if you're just as fast as they are."}
{"text":"Worst service ever! Food is not bad but not worth it for the price you pay. Don't ever order their combo! It's a big ripoff!!! We ordered the combo that includes the French soup, lamb, oysters, bbq eel, curry crab, sea cucumber with bokchoy. They advertised that it's a great deal and cheaper than ordering the items individually. Not true! It's cheaper to order the items individually. In addition, some items like the sea cucumber tasted so bland and the bbq eel was so so. Their famous curry crab is good but too much work for just for a bit of crab meat. Not worth your time or effort. I would order their less expensive items if you plan to go next time."}
