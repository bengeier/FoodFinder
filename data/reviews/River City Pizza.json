{"text":"Just ordered a sub and fish sandwich from River city pizza. Was told it was only going to be 30 to 35 minutes. A hour and 15 minutes later and the sub showed up missing the Italian dressing, the bread is hard and taste like it was sitting on top of the oven for an hour. Ordered cheese balls as an appetizer and it didn't have any mustard. These guys used to be pretty good but boy have a gotten sloppy. Not likely to order from them ever again. Guess I'll try Dominoes next time."}
{"text":"This is a great option for a quick dinner.  The pizza is good, they have a nice variety toppings and one super great option they offer is gluten free dough.  With everyone not eating much gluten they really played it smart by adding this to the menu.  They are all very nice to deal with and I've never had a problem."}
{"text":"Ordered one cheese and one pepperoni pizza, for delivery. They arrived on time and hot! The crust was great, sauce tastes good and overall, we enjoyed them. This was our first time eating their pizza. We will order again!"}
