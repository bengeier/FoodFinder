{"text":"I was in town on my \"mini-moon\" with my husband and I must have been so distracted by the bag I fell in love with that I didn't even notice they had a cafe....so I hope I'm leaving this review for the right spot!  I bought a Kimberly Fletcher (Flechr) bag (style was Angie) and holy hell I'm in love.  I haven't been home a week and I've already received several compliments on the bag.  I love that it's a local Montreal designer and I can't wait for when this designer blows up to know I have one of her bags!!"}
{"text":"Une très belle découverte inattendue. Situé au fond d'un commerce spécialisé en décoration intérieure, le Comptoir Végétarien dispose de quelques tables et de quelques tabourets au comptoir. L'endroit est calme. Ouvert que le midi la semaine et le week-end, il faut savoir attraper le moment pour en profiter. Pour cette première visite, j'ai choisi le choix du jour, soient une fameuse chaudrée de maïs Thaï et un savoureux sauté de légumes sauce arachide sur un nid de nouille soba. La cuisinière/hôtesse est accueillante et prend le temps de faire le tour du menu avec vous. Je suis conquis :) et je vais revenir souvent.  2e visite à la mi-avril pour y dîner. Je suis conquis. Ce resto-midi végétarien est un incontournable."}
{"text":"Fantastic vegetarian slash vegan refuge in a wonderfully decorated furniture store. A zen sanctuary close to the old Montreal and NotreDame. Super friendly service to boot. Highly recommend their delicious salads and kombucha"}
{"text":"Visiting from Boston. Delicious food and exquisite decor. The ambience in general is relaxing and it's not overly crowded like the nearby cafes. Nice people too!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It's a hodgepodge of all kinds of things. It has some great home furnishings, unique lighting fixtures, furniture, tiles, kitchenware and clothes.  The staff was welcoming but definitely left you to explore and wander the store.   It also houses a cool little cafe with bread and pastries from L' Amour au Pain.  The latte was really good. Sorry, no drip brewed coffee for any Americans out there. I believe they make sandwiches and salads for a quick no fuss lunch.   Ok, now the part I've been hesitant on whether I should share because I want it to be my own little piece of urban paradise.  I figured in the end, it is not mine to keep and I would be doing the business owners a disservice by not helping them attract more clients to them. This place should be shared with anyone willing to explore the hidden treasures of the City. Most tourists would not come into a home furnishings place, but trust me. You want to at least grab a coffee and follow me.   My absolute favorite part is their little shaded \"terrasse\" ally.  If you ever need a little hideaway when you are in Old Port.  It's the perfect place. I feel like I've been transported to a different time and place.  Nothing fancy, just tranquil, a simple elegance that the French are synonymous with. I wonder if the manager would kick me out if I curled up with a book one day."}
{"text":"The chic decor lured me in but the cafe kept me there for an hour. Settling into the back with a nourishing and cool smoothie after a long morning of cycling through the sights was a welcome repose. We lingered over the wallpapers (because doesn't everyone wish they had exposed brick?) While listening to the loungey beats. I could've stayed for days..."}
{"text":"Wonderful selection of well-made locally made fashion and housewares. Hang out for a while and have some organic coffee and pastries."}
