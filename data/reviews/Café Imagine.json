{"text":"Work/Study space with unlimited coffee+snacks for $4/hr ($3 for students) and max pay $16 ($12 for students)

Pro: 
-really good for work, lots of natural lighting, quiet
-plenty board games for recreation 
-staff is friendly
-If you're staying for an hour only, it's really cheap coffee because you get cappuccino, latte and other espresso based drinks for just $3
-clean desks
-they offer drink for take out as well

Cons:
-none of their hot beverages are hot enough. The filter coffee was almost cold whereas filter coffee is usually steaming hot. The chai latte was also cold even though steamed milk was used.
-their snacks are store bought basic stuff  like two-bite mini brownies, social thé biscuits, president choice cookies, and bananas. You won't get anything sophisticated such as croissants etc
-if you're staying for ~3hrs or less it might not be worth it and also very expensive. You can usually stay the same amount of time at any other cafe and get better food such as sandwiches and stuff and still be paying around $9/$10

Conclusion: come here thinking that you're paying for the space and not the food. A very office like space with office like kitchen and coffee. If you're hungry, you'd have to go somewhere else for food."}
{"text":"Clean and cozy place where you pay 3$/h for a maximum of 12$ for students. You get unlimited drinks such as coffee or tea and cookies. There are also board games. It's a perfect place for studying or just chilling with friends. 

The staff was super friendly and helpful. It's located near the mont royal metro. Very convenient. You can also order take out food to eat there if you're hungry."}
{"text":"Pay-by-the-hour concept with unlimited snacks, drinks (amazing homemade iced tea!) and coffee.
When not crowded, the atmosphere is really quiet with a luminous room, perfect for studying! In terms of snacks, there's much less choice than at anticafe (famous pay-by-the-hour coffee), but it's clearly better quality.
Really good service too!"}
{"text":"My quest of an awesome coffee shop has me stopped by this place for a conference. Tons of natural lights coming through this coffee shop and it is pretty quiet. The food isn't that bad and the drinks are probably the best part of this place. For 4$/hour or 3$/hours (student price), you get an awesome place to chill, play board games, eat/drink how much you want and do your work. Every Wednesday from 7pm to 9pm, there are a lot of quality conferences with special guest in an intimate space for the price of 8$ to cover food and drinks (moka, latte, cappuchino...). The drinks are not varied but you get a server who will gladly make it and serve it to you HOT with a smiling face. Conferences live are posted on Facebook for the ones who missed it or could not make it and they are free! 

I guess you can say... The affordable conference makes this place worth a visit at least once."}
{"text":"Okay, you should know - since I didn't - this place is a co-working space, so you pay by the hour and all drinks and food are free. 

I prefer it to Anticafe at Place Des Arts because even though Anticafe is cheaper and bigger, its cookies are dry and stale. This place has nicer food. 

However you should also know that this place is SUPER QUIET. It's not somewhere to go in a group or with a friend; it's for working and whispering only!"}
{"text":"Café Imagine est un nouveau café à quelques minutes à pied du métro Mont-Royal. Je suivais leur compte Instagram depuis un moment puis je me suis décidé à y passer une après-midi. L'ambiance est agréable, la musique est douce et bonne et le personnel est vraiment sympathique. Il y a énormément de prises alors inquiètes-toi pas pour ton laptop. Puis, le concept est vraiment intéréssant, tu peux manger et boire à volonté pendant ta journée d'étude pour près de 10$ (si tu es étudiant). 

Cependant, il proposait très peu de choix de gâteaux, de fruits et de boissons, peut-être parce qu'il vienne d'ouvrir. Mais tu peux retrouver tout de même du café, de l'eau infusé, des bananes, du lait 2% et lait d'amande et quelques gâteaux. J'ai donc finalement pris du thé, une banane et quelques cookies, ce que j'aurai pu commandé dans n'importe quel café. Également, le café n'est pas très grand pourtant certaines personnes réservent des places pour leurs affaires personnels, c'est vraiment dommage pour ceux et celles qui arrivent en milieu d'après midi, comme moi ! 

Enfin, je pense qu'il devrait y avoir plus de café de ce type dans Montréal, mais je ne suis pas tombé amoureuse de la place, que j'ai trouvé très simple au final. Mais je vous la recommande tout de même si vous êtes curieux."}
{"text":"Café Imagine offers a modern and clean take on the pay-by-the-hour concept. It is $3/hr, with a $12/day limit ($9 for students), which is perfect for students and those who work from home.

Their selection of snacks is more limited than anticafe because they are a newer business; however, it is higher in quality. 
They offer: bread w/ jam or peanut butter (and option to toast), 2 options of fruit-infused water, coffee w/ option of 2% or almond milk, a large variety of teas, bananas, and a selection of cookies and cake.

The service is also more attentive - you don't have to do your own dishes, and the owner is readily available to help out. I look forward to my next visit!"}
