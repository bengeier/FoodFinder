{"text":"This place was recommended, but I found that it fell flat. The pizza crust had no crunch and the cheese didn't taste like cheese. We were sitting at the bar and a waitress threw her bar rag onto our pizza so we didn't get to enjoy the last 2 slices. Even though it was a clean towel it was gross and we didn't even get a sorry! The only redeeming fact for the stars were generous pours of their wine."}
{"text":"Best authentic Italian pizza ever.  Loved the ambience of this restaurant and the flavours of the food.  Great family restaurant and great place to bring the kids."}
{"text":"Went for a light lunch here with my husband and two kids. Shared a large pizza and Cesar salad. Great meal, fresh food. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"It was okay, not my favourite.  The crust was nice and thin but the pizza wasn't very flavourful."}
{"text":"We went here tonight for dinner. This was a good decision.
A few tables were occupied which hopefully means that we don't have to wait too long for our food -- because we were starving! The crackling sound and rustic smell of the wood fired oven gave us hope for a great tasting pizza, and guess what: we got what we were looking for.
We had the medium size Puttanesca and Diavolo pizza.
Puttanesca: a thin crust baked crunchy on the edges and layered with all the good toppings - mozzarella, anchovies, capers, black olives, chili flakes and olive oil. Delicious with a good saltiness from the anchovies, rating 4 out of 5.
Diavolo: same thin crust with good amount of Italian sausage, spicy salami, sauteed mushrooms, mozzarella, olive oil and basil. It is a great taste combination with a hint of spiciness. Perfect, best pizza so far in Oakville. Rating: 4 out of 5.
The service was quick and friendly, the size was \"medium\", however it means that we got a huge pizza, which we could not finish. But who does not love left overs, eh?
This place is very decent and we can recommend it to others on this website. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Nice place.  Good food.  Had the Lasagna and the Margarita Pizza.  Nice portion sizes and atmosphere.  Staff seemed friendly and welcoming.
Not overly loud.  Bright.  

Here are my OFIs (Opportunity For Improvement)

*Bring bread and olive oil/vinegar to the table
*sweep floors before we get seated not while we are eating and if you must, please say excuse me before shoving a broom pole under our table
*wall trim needs paint touchup
*finishing over blinds in dining room needs improvement
*make sure linens are dry on the tables.  Ours was freshly washed and still damp

Great value overall!  Will come back and recommend!"}
{"text":"I am always amused when my best friend tells me there's nothing in Oakville. Had he looked around the corner, he would have seen a lot of local establishments that provide fresh, delicious food -- like Justino's Pizza, a restaurant I was introduced to very recently.

I came here for a relative's birthday party and was very impressed by the experience. The restaurant prides itself on offering wood oven-cooked pizza, which is done up in the kitchen and can be seen virtually anywhere in the restaurant.

The place was already busy when we showed up at 5 p.m., and was packed by the time we left three hours later. Even the outdoor patio was nearly filled, despite being the end of summer and it becoming much cooler in the evening.

We started off with a number of appetizers, including several plates of the \"Justino's Own\" salad, which comes with sundried tomatoes, cucumbers, olives and more. I found myself scarfing down multiple plates of it in-between nibbles from a cheese tray, which had selections of mozzarella, Parmesan, blue cheese and more.

Though I was initially planning to go for the grilled chicken ($16.50 - not listed on the website's menu), my family and I ended up settling for the Piero \"white\" pizza, which comes with roasted chicken, red peppers, goat cheese and fresh-cut arugula, among other ingredients. I greedily helped myself to several slices, although it didn't really fill me up. Loved the taste and the texture of the pizza, though. Wood-fired pizza is definitely a different beast, and I enjoyed the difference in flavour and how it crunched as I folded it. Several other members of our group mentioned that the dishes they ordered (which included the aforementioned chicken, cheese tortellini and \"vegetarian\" pizza) were also great.

What I was most impressed by was the extras. The owner of the restaurant gave our group a free round of amaretto aperitif shots, which \"went down smooth but hit you like a truck afterwards\". Had a nice almond flavour and was very nice of him to serve.

I give the waitress a lot of slack because she was very friendly (I was also told that she had recently been hired), but if I have one complaint about the restaurant, it's that the ordering was a bit confused. We ordered a large pizza and ended up getting a medium, while others were missing items or the orders weren't relayed correctly. Some of our group members had to ask for something two or three times before it was brought over. It wasn't a deal-breaker, but it led to a lot of confusion at the end of the night when we received the bill.

Regardless, I had a great time at Justino's and will likely be back in the future. This is one of my new favorite spots in downtown Oakville, and proves that there are plenty of great little restaurants in the downtown core.

Well worth a visit."}
{"text":"Maybe we were there on an off day?  Came around 1pm and we were the only customers.  Service was below average (when you are the only 2 customers in restaurant, you shouldn't have to wave your waitress over for service) and we didn't really dig the pizza.  Apparently we are in the minority after speaking with some friends who have enjoyed it.    Will simply chalk it up to an off day for them."}
{"text":"Delicious! I had the Diavolo pizza and my companion the Amante della carne. Great atmosphere in part because of the delicious smells coming from the wood oven. Service was great as well."}
{"text":"Really delicious pizza. Had the marinara with no cheese. Nice crust, good sauce. Their website is a disaster and they didn't answer the phone when I called to order twice but the pizza was great"}
{"text":"I would highly  recommend this restaurant to eat at  with family and friends. Staff is very friendly, the food is absolutely delicious and affordable. The pizza, is my personal favourite as I always go there with my friends on my lunch breaks. It is always made fresh for us, and we can never get enough of it."}
{"text":"This place claims to be Italian, ha thats hilarious. My mom ordered a pasta with sausage, sounded good on the menu, however she found out that it was hot dogs.... nice try. she sent it back and was disgusted. BTW my mom was born in italy.... so ya, she knows whats good. She NEVER sends food back at a restaurant, but there was no other option. Do what you will with this information. Beware, you were warned."}
{"text":"Unreal food. But,
Took 1 hour to get a soda. Another hour for food. Quinoa salad with no quinoa. 1 fill up on water in the 2.5 hours (continuously asked for water). Didnt realize we had reservation. Bill was wrong."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now, and it's almost always a disappointment. The food is delicious, as is the wine and beer selection, but it is the service that makes this place so bad. The last time I came, it took the waitress about 45 minutes to get our order...then I asked for a refill of wine about 3 times before she finally got around to doing it. Our food arrived about 50 minutes after we ordered it. My boyfriend's order never came! They simply forgot about his order of spaghetti! Then they tried to offer us free tiramisu to make our experience better, but it's over for them. Wanted to take my dad to an Italian place for father's day, but I do not trust this restaurant to get their orders right and on time. I don't want to be embarrassed by my poor restaurant choice. 

Final thoughts: come here for some good food, if you've got some time and patience. But don't expect that they'll get your order right."}
{"text":"Really like this place for the bruschetta and pizza and wine is cheap and not bad . Been here a few times and would probably come more often if the wait staff was on the ball . They always seem short staffed . My order is always wrong , you can't get a new drink to save your life and they lack basic wait staff experience . Too bad because the food is good ?!?!"}
{"text":"We've eaten here several times now and the food is always great. The pizzas are probably my favourite thing on the menu, but the pastas and salads are good too. Pretty authentic Italian by my standards, and the service is consistently friendly and efficient. Definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"Best pizza ever, the crust is well done and the smell of wooden pizza makes you order more. My friend suggested this place when we came to visit from Toronto and we loved the place. And the  caffe macchiato just made my day."}
{"text":"Worst service ever! I would never go back again. If you are looking for good customer service not a place to go for sure! They serve the water in beer glasses. Bacon in the pizza even though didn't order it. Nothing special about the pizza I don't know how they've gotten excellent reviews."}
