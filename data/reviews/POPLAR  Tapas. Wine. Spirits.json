{"text":"Beautiful restored house with southern charm. Food is good but very overpriced. Ordered the Tres Leche cake which is served at the owners other restaurant, Viva Chicken, but it's twice the price at this Cafe. Owners should reconsider prices to draw the neighbors into this Cafe and make it a Fourth Ward staple."}
{"text":"Lovely place, perfect spot to spend a weekend afternoon with friends! The tapas were great and the atmosphere is just so relaxing...if you like Sangria you should definitely try theirs."}
{"text":"Great and much needed addition to 4th Ward. Friendly service and laidback vibe. Try the tuna fish sandwich!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with a co-worker.  The historic building is beautiful inside and out!  There is a patio outside with some seating.  Cozy seating inside in 3 different rooms.  Very relaxed atmosphere.  You order at the counter and they bring the food to you.  The desserts look amazing, but we didn't try one today.  I had the Arugula Pear Salad with chicken.  It was fresh and delicious.  Co-worker ordered Turkey & Provo sandwich and liked hers also.  Prices seem to range around $7-10.  Can't wait to come back and try other items on the menu.  I love the casual, comfortable atmosphere and we were able to get in and out in about 40 minutes which is a rare thing for eating lunch out."}
{"text":"This place was amazing and everything Charlotte needs and more! My girlfriend and I went to Poplar StreetCafe for for wine and apps looking for a peaceful place to catch up and it couldn't have been cozier or more perfect with amazing service and great music. We had the hummus, and quiche of the day with a bottle of wine followed by the passion fruit mousse. All was amazing - highly recommend this place!! Alvaro was also so great!! Great place, great night :)"}
{"text":"If you want an intimate atmosphere with delicious food go no further than here. Nestled in 4th Ward, this restaurant magnifies the area. Enjoyable time could be had by all."}
{"text":"Very quaint neighborhood restaurant.  Awesome wine and tapas.  Definitely get the figs wrapped in prosciutto and smoked salmon panini.  Our server Olivia was awesome."}
{"text":"Fun and inviting!  This place has a cool city environment inside with a lovely Victorian feel on the outside. I saw that the outside is getting a patio which is much needed!!   Wine was grad but they only offered it by the glass. The meat and cheese plate was amazing!  would love the wait staff to be more knowledgeable on the tastes of wine and offerings of the food when ordering from the table."}
{"text":"Popped in on a Saturday for a quick lunch which turned out to be an outstanding decision!  A good selection, everything was fresh and the dessert was amazing! We will definitely be back -- often!"}
{"text":"The ambience is very nice. They now have a full bar for the liquor drinkers out there. Convenient location in 4th Ward and walkable to just about anywhere."}
{"text":"We came here a couple of weeks ago and had an amazing time. Decided to come back last night (9/29) for a couple of drinks before our anniversary dinner and it was a complete failure. First, someone from the restaurant posted on their Facebook page that their cocktails were $7 each. When we arrive, our waiter says that is not their special for the night and I mention that it was posted on Facebook and so he goes to speak to the manager. After he spoke to a couple of different people, he finally found out he could honor what they posted online. While waiting for our drinks to arrive, we hear another server speaking to the table next to us and they ask if the sparkling wine is half off and the server said not tonight, but the cocktails were $7. The only issue with that is there was a big chalk board on the way in that stated sparkling wine was half off. I feel they may need to start the afternoon with a staff meeting so everyone can be on the same page.   Now comes the drinks. We each had a different cocktail and I don't think either of them had a single drop of alcohol. This is in complete contrast to our prior experience. I think they purposefully made the drinks this way seeing that I had them honor the special that they posted online. I spoke to the manager about this, who was not friendly at all, and he just walked back to the table and took the drinks without even saying a word to the person I was with. Extremely unprofessional and I would have not expected this, at all, from this type of bar/restaurant. So they take the drinks back to the bar, say they add more alcohol to the same drink, re-shake it and bring the same drinks back out...utterly ridiculous that you would not just make us a new drink the correct way. I had the mojito and it still was not made properly. According to their menu, it was supposed to have Bacardi and Captain. If there is Captain Morgan Rum in a drink, the drink will have a brown tint to it since it's a spiced rum. There was no brown tint at all.   To my stupidity, I decide to give them another try and order a second round of cocktails. It was just like the first time where they were extremely watered down and you couldn't even taste the alcohol in the drink. See other reviews of this place that state the same thing.  Lastly, I overheard that there is a new manager at this place and I have to say, they should have found a different person to run the show here. He doesn't have any of the characteristics that a manager of this sort of place should have."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in Charlotte. Fantastic food and ambience in a quaint Fourth Ward setting. A beautiful front cobblestone patio is a real treat on a perfect temperature evening. I look forward to trying out the music on Friday nights. Last visit for brunch we had a delicious tapa that consisted of three half avocados with a scrumptious, bright, fresh shrimp salad on top. Can't wait to explore the menu more on future meals."}
{"text":"Cute little wine & beer place! We only had drinks here but it was a nice summer Friday night & they had a live music band. We liked the drink choices for local brews and wines by the glass. The menu looked good but we only had drinks. There is a shortage of parking because you have to park on the street. Cute old house!"}
{"text":"Umm this place saved my life. After dining at McNinch house last month on a Saturday night we stumbled in here and had way better food and service. Jenny behind the bar, was awesome and accommodating. The drinks were great and the mac n cheese with prosciutto helped fill us up. I ate an entire slice of their chocolate cake and it was so delicious. I went here when it was the wine bar, but really like the changes they've made to the bar and menu. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very promising restaurant for CLT but needs some honing. Noise level was obnoxious especially for the sedate surrounding. It could really use some acoustical tiling. Also service was slightly spotty. We waited a looong time for our food (table that came after us was served faster) then everything came at once. Food was fairly good but could benefit from another type of greens as garnish. All 4 of our tapas had the same arugula!  We'd be willing to try again but only if we could sit outside where it would not be so loud."}
{"text":"Quaint and quiet with a twist of sophistication and charm, Poplar offered more than the initial drawn of being a tapas place.   Stumbled upon this beauty when I was in the area and in search of a late dinner and drinks spot with some girlfriends. The house turned restaurant/bar offered everything we desired from light accents of southern charm like a swing bench on the lit patio, dim lighting beside a fireplace and delicious tapas and drinks to spare. The service was timely and courteous while the ambiance kept the mood at ease. We all had a delightful experience and will definitely keep this little gem in mind when I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Extremely limited menu and overpriced.  Went with 2 co-workers and ordered sandwiches which were very dry so we asked for mustard or balsamic vinegar, mayo, etc.  We were told there would be an upcharge!  Really!!!!! Even McDonalds gives you free mustard!"}
{"text":"First time here on Monday evening! The pictures are unable to transfer the uniqueness inside and outside this house. We enjoyed the charcuterie board and a glass of wine on the patio. Quick drop in on a beautiful evening to check it out.  They have food and drink specials different nights of the week. Looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant. Great ambience, music, service and food. One of the reviews mentioned it being pricey - I actually found it to be very reasonably priced for the quality of food we ate that night! If you are used to chain restaurants, then this may not be the place for you. If you like style, ambience, romantic settings with good food, then this is the place for you! We ordered a bottle of wine and a bunch of tapas, including dessert. We did not leave hungry at all and really thought the entire experience of Poplar was incredible. We will be back - soon - and have told all our friends about this place! It was not super busy on a Saturday night- I hope this place is around for a long time to come."}
{"text":"A GEM hidden in Charlotte! My husband & I went there last night & it was Wonderful! Loved the atmosphere & patio! The service was great & the food was great! It's low key yet elegant. Can't find a negative thing about this place. My new favorite Tapas/Wine Bar!"}
{"text":"Went here on a whim last night with my friend. We were drawn in by the beautiful lighting outside. Once we entered we were greeted by who I would guess is the owner, or a high up manager. He told us not to be shy and gave us a little tour of the place and left us alone to decide if we wanted to stay.   I love the distance he gave us. So we decided to give it a try.   The interior is beautiful and cozy. There was live music and the guy was really good, he played Journey, Stevie Wonder, TV themes, everything. And what you want to know is how was the food, it was really tasty and priced well. We also got coffee beverages. This is a great date night place or just a cozy outing with a friend. I would definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went there last night and we loved it!  We sat on the outdoor patio and they had live music out there.  One thing I really liked is that they music was not too loud and it was nice background.  We got the meat and cheese plate, a panni and some local craft beer.  Everything was great.  We will be back again very soon."}
{"text":"Super cool. Place is like. You are at home  love the charcuterie panini. Best in town. I don't think anybody else is doing it.  Have to try the other ones too. Desserts are to die. For. Tried the dulce de leche cake. Amazing congrats to the chef. Really good stuff will be bringing my family. This weekend. The patio outside outstanding a cool place to chill. And the staff so really attentive thanks you guys. Will be bringing  a lot of businesses"}
{"text":"We had a work party here. Quietly elegant in a historic 4x4 house in fourth ward. The food was excellent and they were able to accommodate our eclectic food life styles.  Everyone enjoyed themselves. Thank you!"}
{"text":"The service is excellent and so is the food.  I haven't given the bartender any work because the wine selection is very nice.  There are many choices for vegetarians and vegans, not just one fruit plate and a salad-hold-the-bacon.  It is in the 4th Ward and you do have to find street parking.  Or use a parking lot on Tryon Street and stroll through the neighborhood to get there.  There isn't enough traffic on 10th and Poplar to make outdoor seating unpleasant.  But, the inside of this lovely, old house is charming.  So, either is nice."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this and had a delightful experience. From the service to the food and wine, the evening was perfect. Highly recommend for an extended evening with friends where you can enjoy the food, wine, and good company."}
{"text":"Poplar Street Tapas, Cafe, & Bar provides an inviting ambience and something for everyone. Situated in The Morrison House, a historic landmark nestled in Fourth Ward, Poplar Street keeps the natural interior room structure which provides cozy alcoves in which one could read for hours without interruption, work on laptops with a business team, grab cocktails with friends, or whisper in a lover's ear. Poplar Street manages to offer a varied menu, from charcuterie and cocktails to quiche and coffee, while maintaining a clear vision and minimalist attitude.  I went in to Poplar Street Tapas, Cafe, & Bar to get a quick coffee on a hot Charlotte afternoon. Immediately upon entering I was drawn to the counter on my left, where customers can order anything from the menu (wait service is an option after 2 PM). The desserts, the creations of one the owner's sister-in-law, were just gorgeous and seasonal. Unable to help myself, I ordered the passion fruit mousse. The mousse, covered with a thin layer of whipped cream and topped with blueberries and a strawberry, was a taste of heaven: tart, creamy, fluffy. I had to restrain myself from licking the cute glass clean!  The iced vanilla coffee I ordered was exactly as I expected, I did not have to add milk or sugar. But the passion fruit mousse really stole the show. The desserts are not listed on the menu because they change depending on the season and the whims and inspirations of the pastry chef. Also, pastries are delivered on Mondays or Tuesdays. I came in on a Thursday and I got the last mousse, but there was still passion fruit cake, \"sexy\" triple chocolate cake, strawberry shortcake, tiramisu, peach tart, tres leches, dulce de leche cheesecake, and raspberry chocolate cake. The waitress apologized for the \"limited\" options, so I cannot imagine what it's like on a Monday! I will have to come back and see. And I might have to buy a slice of passion fruit cake to hold me over until then..."}
{"text":"A delightful little place! The restaurant is in an old Victorian house and is divided up into four little rooms. They have live music most nights and an outdoor patio for warm weather dining. I've only sat at the bar and had the charcuterie plate - which is a phenomenal deal - but the service has been great. The parking can be a bit of a challenge which is the only draw back."}
{"text":"Charming atmosphere on the patio; love the house too. Generous on the cheese plate; other servings were good, not stellar-"}
{"text":"I can't believe I went so long without knowing this place existed! Poplar is so adorable, every room has excellent ambiance and the patio is just lovely. We ordered drinks, a cucumber water for me and an old fashioned for hubs. Both were great, we also ordered the figs wrapped in prosciutto and they were to die for, so delish!! I will definitely be back! This would be a great place for a GTO. Service was excellent!"}
{"text":"We came here just for drinks. Beautiful restaurant, with an upscale ambiance in a historic building. Great bar. Good service. Tasty pisco sour. The menu looked good, although I expected more of a Peruvian menu. They offer brunch on Sundays."}
{"text":"Definitely would recommend . The hummus is amazing . They make it just like back home in the Middle East. The environment is very laid back but classy!"}
{"text":"What a cute dining experience! I came in from Chicago late and was looking for relaxed meal. The glow of the place gives it curb appeal. I loved the southern feel with the porch and soft lights.   We came in for a late dinner 30 min before closing on a Wednesday, and there was no sense of rushing from the staff. There were tons of fun seating options - alfresco, a couple dining rooms, and a bar - all thoughtfully situated in a house. We opted for an indoor dining room seat by a window. I loved the authentic feel, which also made it romantic. Pictures don't do it justice.  The menu had nice variety. The hubby and I ordered the tasty sangria and pisco sour to start. We then ordered the prosciutto wrapped honey figs, shrimp ceviche that came with flatbread, and a panini that was delicious (I think the charcuterie one).   It was a perfect last minute dinner, and I would definitely love to come back for some of the live music and seeing the space during the daylight for some brunch. It's an Excellent find!"}
{"text":"We chose this place for its environment, music, and vibe. Unfortunately the service and food ruined it for us. We has Charcuteria and Bocados de Pollo. Charcuteria was torturously salty and the chicken dish was not great. Both dishes were too expensive for the content. For the drinks, one was too watery and the other tasted like bad vodka! They don't have waiters and no one is here to serve the tables. The hostesses and boss boys were serving and wait time for food was so long we were wonder what they did for preparing such simple dishes.   We had high hopes for this place. Won't come back here again."}
{"text":"Impressed by this place. When I went on a Saturday evening they were playing live music. The interior was comfortable and classy, but still felt casual. I ordered the shrimp ceviche and flatbread.   Great service, cool old house, a great place to think, go on a date, or relax on a summer evening."}
{"text":"Poplar Street Cafe & Wine Bar is so underrated. Why isn't this place filled with people? Why aren't there fights for reservations? It blows my mind.   I have been here twice now and it's been exceptional both times. It's such a cute and romantic little spot. It gives you a warm southern welcome as soon as you step on the property. The hanging lights in the trees, the front porch swing and the creaking old door looks like it was stolen a Nicholas Sparks set...and it's right in the city!   They let us seat ourselves both times and it was hard to choose between the historic classy rooms or the outdoor patio. Our waitress gave us a tour of the cafe and filled us in on the history of the house.   The waitress was so sweet and welcoming. She memorized all of our orders and they came out perfectly...I was so impressed. I don't know how she did it! She even brought me a sample cheese plate to choose which one I liked for my salad. I didn't even ask her to do that.   We started with asian chicken skewers, the hummus plate and a charcuterie board. All of the starters were great. Rich with flavor and enough to fill the whole table of four. I LOVED the hummus and the way they grilled the warm pitas for dipping. *they should serve veggies with that plate.  I ordered the Arugula Pear Salad: Arugula / Anjou Pear / Gorgonzola / Walnuts / Olive Oil Lime Dressing + Chicken  The salad was HUGE and all of the flavors went so perfectly together. I was full after eaten half but it was so good I couldn't stop. Their homemade dressing was a hit! I'd love to get my hands on that recipe.   All of the meals/appetizers were very inexpensive and you get a lot of food. My friends ordered paninis and those were just as great. We all passed around the food having each other try them.   Dessert and coffee is a must. It's a place you won't want to rush out of. My boyfriend even had fun serenading everyone on the piano.   Why only four stars? A couple things...  1. They should serve veggies with their hummus plate. 2. They should open their coffee/dessert bar early mornings.  3. I wish they were open on Sunday and only closed on Monday. 4. I wish they had weekend breakfasts.  5. I wish they'd post more on their social media/instagram. (weird i know) I'd be happy to take over that task for them.   This is a place I want to bring all of my friends and family who visit from out of town and a place I hope stays open forever because I love it! It would be great for meetings and events."}
{"text":"One if my favorite tapas in the area. Portions are a great size and everything tasted amazing. We got the cheese & charcuterie platter and the smoked salmon tacos and will definitely be returning for those."}
{"text":"We found this place on accident last weekend, but am so glad we did! I would certainly suggest this restaurant for a few reasons. It's located in a historic house on Poplar St. (hence the name), and tucked just enough away from other hot spots uptown. We were surprised to find out it had been open for over a year while they had been doing renovations and not much advertising. There are so many of the house's original details which added to the ambiance. I had a fantastic mojito, followed by a light rose'. The bar selection was nice and I thought well priced. While the food was tasty, I thought the flavors were definitely safe. All light in flavor, too. There was someone singing bluesy covers in another room, and at no point did we feel rushed which was pretty fantastic. I truly loved the feel and vibe of this spot and can't wait for warmer weather and their patio seating to open!"}
{"text":"A gem dropped in the middle of a town that has come a long way, but still lacks in establishments such as PSC with so much charisma and character.  The food is delicious and resonates with both the new up and coming Charlotte flare as well as the timeless class you can only find in a city such as ours.  The staff is warm and outgoing, and there is a great variety of wine and local beer available for those who are working there till 5, or 4 in my case.  There are generous spaces to work, and play, and feel free to relax and take in the Charlotte sun in outdoor seating or swing on the deck swing while enjoying a cocktail.   Speaking of working, for us work from homers, could I suggest switching out the power outlets to 3 prong so I can work there longer than what the battery in my laptop allows?   Keep up the good work over there.  An absolute must visit in Charlotte."}
{"text":"This place is really very cute. I absolutely love the quaint, cozy feel. I hope this establishment thrives and does well. On my visit I had wine which was decent (note- I wanted Sangria but they were out :( ) and a panini. The panini was delicious! The service was pretty slow, but hopefully this will improve as the kinks are worked out. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"This is an inventive restaurant concept in the heart of Charlotte's Fourth Ward; a historic home built in the 1800's has been converted to a watering hole for drinks and American-inspired small plates (tapas, but not quite without the endless supply of red wine).  The outside is very inviting, it hosts an array of seating much like your grandma's house in the countryside if she were to throw a party for you and your friends. From the looks of the house, it almost seemingly resembles a regular home.   When you enter the front door, there are places to sit in many different rooms, which each have a small, retired fireplace. The indoors is lined with tiny decorative items that are like an owner's memorabilia.   This place is classy and very charming. The brooding, jazzy music fits the aura. The staff is friendly and accommodating. The food is also pretty good, yet it's not your classic idea of Spanish tapas. Come here for a drink and good discussions, and you'll leave satisfied."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Love the location and the outdoor patio. Inside has a very homey feel, reminds me a lot of Charleston. Would recommend to everyone!"}
{"text":"Welp, looks as though I've found my new spot. Looooooooove this place. The driver dropped us off out front and we were already impressed, gorgeous house with a lovely sitting area out front. We opted to sit inside because it was just so inviting, perfectly dim lighting, subtle music in the background, comfy seats and not a tv in sight! I don't want to mislead you though, the food is NOT 5 stars, maybe a 3, MAAAAYYBBE. But everything else more than makes up for that.  As others have mentioned the menu is simple, but I am a fan of that. Wednesday is half off wines by the glass or bottle so we went straight for a bottle, why not when with the discount it was a total steal. For food we ordered the meat and cheese board, spinach with garlic in white wine and wild mushrooms in red wine. The spinach and mushrooms desperately needed salt, and were very heavy in garlic. The meat and cheese board while nothing fancy was really good. This is probably what I will get every time.  If you are looking for an intimate date spot or a place to hang with friends in cozy and classy digs with excellent service look no further than POPLAR."}
{"text":"Been here a handful of times, and I can honestly say that Poplar is becoming my new favorite place to meet up with friends.  Situated in a historic house, Poplar's interior, exterior, and magical patio are just great. We opt for patio seating whenever we go, and on Friday and Saturday there's live music as well - always great people playing.  The food is wonderful too - we've had a big variety of things from ceviche to mac n' cheese, to the cheese plate, to the wrapped figs, and every time we order something new we're never disappointed.  I know they have wine as one of their three points, but the wine list isn't very extensive, and there's about a 50% margin in what you get compared to if you bought it at a shop... instead, opt for the cocktails. The mixed drinks are for the most part well priced and always flavorful and refreshing. The Lady likes gin drinks and there's plenty to go around here - AND Poplar is one of two places in Charlotte that sells Pisco Sours, a big draw. Located IN uptown but not quite in the bustle of things is a huge draw, so we'll absolutely keep on coming back to this awesome little house."}
{"text":"Such a classy looking spot! Our server was so genuine and helpful. The cheese board was delicious and great portion sizes of cheese. The panini my husband got was delicious and the Mac and cheese too! I had the chicken tacos and they were fine- avocado tasted very fresh! My cocktail tasted great. We will definitely return here!"}
{"text":"What a precious little spot! I don't know where to begin since there's so much underneath one roof! Let's start with the house itself. It's one of the long standing homes in a city that is constantly torn down and replaced with stucco and mirrored glass. It has been lovingly restored and is a gem of a home with historical ties to the city. Local artists' paintings adorn the walls and add more character.   My husband loves the back room where the bar is since it's tucked away, yet has a great feel.  Then there's the food. It's a simple menu that doesn't overwhelm, yet so delicious and everything is made in house. The appetizers, salads, and sandwiches do NOT disappoint! Delicious ceviche, and stuffed mushrooms that I could never get tired of eating. I've yet to have anything here that I didn't like. Then there's desserts, desserts, DESSERTS!! When you first walk in the house, there's a pastry case that honestly gives a popular local bakery a serious run for their money!! The passion fruit mousse is a must try!! I admit that I have a serious sweet tooth and these desserts are made with 100% love!  Be sure to go when they have live music on Tuesday and Friday nights. There is a small patio are out front and it's like having a relaxing night at a friend's house. Very simple: great little bar, relaxing ambiance,  and excellent food all downtown. It doesn't get any better!"}
{"text":"Shocked by all the positive reviews. My husband and I went for dinner last night and had a terrible experience. We ordered 4 items and received only some of what was ordered. The charcuterie plate was missing multiple items, only one kind of cheese was served (supposed to be 3) and instead of pesto aioli there was a dollop of standard mayonnaise, all served on a bed of wilted arugula. Yikes! Next were the tacos, drenched in the same mayonnaise despite the menu not indicating this. The chicken kebabs consistent of poor quality charred meat. Our final item, the kale and quinoa salad with honey lime dressing, came drenched in (you guessed it!) a ton of mayonnaise, no honey or lime in sight. In addition, there was no staggering of the food, it all came out at once and was plopped down on our small table after which we never saw our waiter again. To make matters worse, the wine portions were tiny for the price. A truly disappointing experience. Advice to the chef: if you don't have the ingredients, don't put it on the menu, dousing the \"tapas\" in mayonnaise is not the solution."}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time on Friday night. This place is beautiful inside. Live music. Service and food are outstanding. Talked to Cookie, she is so friendly. Highly recommend for any occasion."}
{"text":"Came to Poplar street cafe for an after dinner coffre. Beautiful place, amazing coffee and service. They have a full bar and full menu with a lot of choices. Great place overall."}
{"text":"It's still pretty early but my initial experience was very positive. The ambiance and service were wonderful. The wine and craft beer selection were also very good. Next time, food and dessert."}
