{"text":"Only been here once, I'm not a fan of it. The food was extremely lacking and the woman I'm guessing owner was too relaxed and wasn't very professional. I went once, and it was enough for me, and it's a little over a mile from my house. I would've even go there again because of convenience."}
{"text":"We visited this charming café after hiking Pinnacle Peak Trail.  I ordered the chicken salad sandwich and when the nice lady behind the counter heard it was our first visit to her café, she gave us each a free cookie - and there were 6 of us!  The cookies were FANTASTIC and so was the sandwich.  If I didn't live on the other side of the country, I would visit here daily."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst sandwich I ever had.  A couple little pieces of pastrami and a slice of swiss cheese on stale rye bread.  All for $8  Are you kidding me? Don't bother with this place!"}
{"text":"We love this place! Food is simple, homemade and fresh not to mention delicious. Owners Jill and Randy are friendly and give excellent service and free drink refills."}
{"text":"Great food and very friendly people.  I had the French Dip, which was very generous, enough for two meals.
Be sure to try the baked goods, which are made on the premises.  The Red Velvet Brownie is yummy.
I stopped in on a Sunday afternoon, and everything was fresh, the staff was excellent, and the café was clean.  Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"Had lunch here with a friend. We both loved our sandwiches and the portions were really big. For only a dollar extra you can add soup or fruit. The homemade soup that day was Thai carrot and it was outstanding. We each had a homemade cookie and they were really delicious also. It took a while to get our meals and for me to get a refill on my iced tea so that is why I took one star off, but the husband and wife were working really hard to keep up and did not have help so I know they were doing the best they can. I wish they were open for breakfast. This is a lunch only place. I wish them success."}
{"text":"Delightful place for rustic fresh homemade food! Run by super nice down to earth family. More than accomodating to my 2 picky toddlers, (Volunteered) to make things not on the menu for them. 

Breads are fresh, healthy & THICK! Quiche is awesone, fluffy & flavorful, comes with delish homemade salads & pumpkin bread. And NO its not expensive! Generous portions. Trust a busy mom who eats out a lot."}
{"text":"lovely new owners and delicious food. Fresh bagels made daily, excellent breakfast burritos and bagel sandwiches. small simple menu but everything hits the spot.. We are glad that we gave the new owners a chance to earn our business. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The Pony Express Cafe is under brand-new ownership as of winter 2013.  The reviews expressed on Yelp to this date (4/15/13) seem to be from the previous ownership.  The phone number is incorrect, also.  Just thought that needed clearing up.  :-)  The new owners are a mother/daughter team, transplants from CO, and they are wonderful!  The prices are modest (contrasted against previous owners' prices) and the food is great!  It is a great little \"find\" on the corner of Alma School and Dynamite Blvd.  The coffee is excellent, the breakfasts are home-cooked to order, lunches are terrific, and Lorraine's homemade baked goods are worth the caloric intake.  Alas, they're only open Mon.-Fri.  Weekends are family time for them, and we can't fault them for that."}
{"text":"Fresh salads, homemade desserts, excellent service and tables outside! Everything prepared well, and the staff efficient and friendly."}
{"text":"The best breakfast burritos! Filling and satisfying. Also on the menu that I strongly recommend is the Kahlua Vodka Cake. Definitely a must try. A deliciously moist chocolate slice of heaven!"}
{"text":"Giddyup to this place! Fresh, home made, delicious, and well within a budget.  Atmosphere  is conducive to eating,talking and enjoying the outside views from the pet friendly patio.  If you are still hungry after the generous portions of staples, try the homemade desserts.  This is the best place for home made soup, too.  Totally in love with the wild chicken rice soup.  Do not pass up this gem.  And, did I say, the owner-operators are just as wonderful as the food!"}
{"text":"Always get the Breakfast Burrito. Stuffed with Steak, Eggs, Cheese, and potatoes, then smothered with a spicy sauce on top. So big I am stuffed when I eat it. 

Beth (the owner) will take good care of you, she always greets me with a good morning and a big smile!"}
{"text":"New owners, Jill and Randy are awesome. There is a new menu that serves lunch only, it is so worth it. Randy makes homemade soup every day - amazing. Jill bakes wonderful treats every day, too! If you tried this place before and wasn't impressed, please give it another shot. It's worth it, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch here! We randomly stopped out of convenience on our way to a dessert tour. The food was great and staff very personable and friendly! Sandwiches and salads were great and very fresh. A pleasant surprise for somewhere we didn't know. The raspberry vinaigrette is homemade and SO good!!"}
{"text":"A keeper for breakfast or lunch!
Casual, with great food and service."}
{"text":"Just had some of the best biscuits & gravy at The pony express. Small place but very nice inside. Everyone was very friendly and the owner and her daughter spent time with everyone. The owner made sure to introduce herself to everyone. What a pleasant surprise. Definitely worth the drive."}
{"text":"The food is much, much better than the prior owners.  Delicious and fair priced food made fresh every day!  The owner/operators are delightful people who make you feel welcome. Also try the yummy cookies also made fresh daily."}
{"text":"My husband & I came here for lunch on a Monday after hiking at the nearby Brown's Ranch. The food was fine. The menu is pretty small (6 breakfast options, handful of salads, 7 or 8 sandwiches) and unfortunately they stop serving breakfast at 11. I initially wanted to get a salad but nothing on the menu sparked much interest for me. The vegetarian salads don't come with cheese so I doubt they would be very filling. I ordered a caprese sandwich and my husband got the turkey. The turkey sandwich was a little sad looking. Basically a thin grilled cheese sandwich on regular bread. Looking at the menu now, I see it should have been served with lettuce/tomato/etc on the side but it was not. Overall it was just overpriced for what was produced. My caprese sandwich was certainly more impressive looking, and the pesto and mozzarella was really really good, but it had a strange gloppy balsamic dressing on it that I wiped away with a napkin but it still had made the bread soggy. I was really impressed by the pesto on the sandwich, it was thick and delicious as opposed to very oily. I think it would have been much improved if the bread had been toasted or warmed. Service was fine. In the future I'd probably head up to Rare Earth for some hearty salads and warm pizza instead of returning here, simply because I prefer my salads to be big and meals to be warm."}
{"text":"Should be a 5 star. Great food, fast service. Thanks mom ( the cook)for the great food."}
{"text":"Yeah great food service and atmosphere 
Chicken salad sandwich amazing 
Prices great too."}
{"text":"Great little place, very nice folks.  Fresh bagels every morning from her cousin's bakery.  I love my scrambled egg & feta with lettuce, tomato and diced pepperoncini on toasted everything bagel with my iced coffee (ok, actually I never make it out of there without having a 2nd iced coffee).

5 stars for being within walking distance of my house at Dynamite & Alma School.  My morning ritual has become walk 2 miles there, breakfast then walk home in time for work.  Wished it opened a bit earlier than 7AM.

update 3/2/2013 - new owners, new menu and furniture.  breakfast and baked goods look quite good but no longer has an espresso machine :-(   Will write an updated review once I've had more than just a coffee."}
{"text":"I LOVE the bagels.  I have never ordered a sandwich but have asked them to make a veggie \"sandwich\" using one of their bagels.  It makes a great meal and, if you love a New York bagel, I suspect this is the best you'll find in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious!  The owner was super pleasant and helpful.  The prices are reasonable and the cookies are amazing!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood destination at the corner of Dynamite and Alma School Parkway. The coffee is delicious and made to order food. The service is exceptional and friendly. Give them a try. Tell them Carol sent you!"}
{"text":"Small little local place. Great place for breakfast. You could tell there were a lot of regular locals that came in.

I got the breakfast burrito. It was rather large. You could share it with someone.


She also has some homemade bakery items.  I also had some of the coffee cake which was quite good.

It is about a mile north from Four Seasons resort. I walked there in about 20 minutes."}
{"text":"Friendly husband and wife \"two man crew,\"  according to the wife, run a nice little spot out in the outskirts of Scottsdale off N Alma School rd.   

Roast beef and provolone on sourdough with all the fixings really hit the spot.  Full sandwich is a hearty portion for a reasonable fare.  Side of texas all meat chili for $1 was all beefy and sausage goodness without an overwhelming kick many texas chili's possess.  Chili was served with a moist homemade piece of cornbread.  BLT on sourdough also had generous thick bacon and a large portion.  Both meals had slices of watermelon and purple grapes which was a nice touch and palate cleanser.  Diamond in rough and closed sundays and mondays.  Pet friendly patio dining with a few tables outside some covered some under the arizona sun.  Several tables for indoor dining as well.  Can't wait to try their biscuits and gravy and breakfasts."}
{"text":"Wow what a great find!! I'm so happy I stopped in here for lunch.  Super friendly owner made me a wonderful Panini type sandwich with a side of delicious soup and fresh fruit.

Prices were great.  Lot's of friendly customers sitting around talking to each other from table to table."}
{"text":"Like eating from my grandma's kitchen.  Really good and shockingly inexpensive for what ya get.  I'm only pissed I didn't find this place years ago.  Kinda tucked away and not easy to see."}
{"text":"On a keto diet and they were super accommodating. They whipped this bad boy up for me custom and it was really cheap for this part of town. On top of that, great service!"}
{"text":"Great lil place!! Loved eating here after hiking at pinnacle peak park. Very friendly couple running this place. Food is delicious. Definitely try their daily soup. I recommend this place to everyone, especially the hikers.
Oh and try their cookies!!"}
{"text":"Open early (6am) for breakfast then close (2pm) after lunch.  Indoor & outdoor seating.  A soup or salad and sandwich combo special was $6.50.  The 1/2 turkey Rueben was a generous size as was the side salad.  Delicious ice tea as well as can/bottled n/a bevies.  Very casual place popular with locals and workers.  Value pricing for anyone looking for a quick bite.  Friendly & accommodating service."}
{"text":"I recently went here for lunch excited that this place opened back up. My husband and I both ordered sandwiches and were less than impressed. 2 slices of turkey between small slices of white bread for over $8.  The menu is so basic and overpriced for what you get.  It's too bad."}
{"text":"Had the pony express salad and it was fantastic. The chicken was freshly cooked, the dressing complemented to blue cheese perfectly, and it came with a strawberry and watermelon. Love this place"}
{"text":"excellent! Short menu of sandwiches &soup of the day. Very pleasant woman working, she even had free homemade cookies! I had half sandwich & soup of the day; warm roast beef with provolone & chicken with wild rice,  so good.
The sandwich was put intro a panini press, great. 
The soup was very thick like a stew, chunky & plenty of chicken,  creamy delicious."}
{"text":"So after many years of driving by the location, I finally decided to try pony express café for lunch. I am sad that I did not try them earlier! I ordered a Montecristo Panini and it was perfectly done.  Although the service was not extremely fast, the timeframe was disclosed to me upfront, and they provided me with a complimentary bottle of water while I waited on the patio and enjoyed the great weather. They were very attentive to the customers needs and the food, although limited in options, was prepared perfectly. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Always a warm welcoming face to greet you behind the counter.  Wonderful specials each day and homemade SOUP!
Very reasonable for a bite to eat to get you though the workday."}
{"text":"Really good hot food at a great price. Has a \"mom and pop\" feel to it. Everyone is very pleasant. Perfect for a quick before school breakfast."}
{"text":"Amazing food and good people. Wish they were open for the weekend they could really kill it. I would agree on a couple of the other reviews it may be a tad over priced except for the Breakfast burrito....it is huge! Great flavors on just about everything. Have not had an bagels yet but they looked great all around us. That is next on the list."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! The service was prompt and very friendly. The food was hot and freshly made. Excellent portion size! The price was great too! The restaurant was very clean inside and out. I will definitely eat here every time I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Got there at 1o minutes to 2pm according to my Verizon phone. Doors locked. Sign says open till 2. We could see the people hiding out in the back. These operators will last less than the last 3 owners."}
{"text":"This is the wrong phone number for this place!  Go to the other Pony Express yelp for the correct phone #. 
They have the best homemade cinnamon rolls that we buy in bulk & pig out on at home on the weekends!  So yummy. 
Continues to be great service & fantastic food."}
{"text":"Not sure what the hype is about... Most definitely not 4.5 stars. The middle aged woman that runs this place is efficient but the furthest thing from friendly.  She's almost militant: we witnessed her being so curt with customers that one group left. She literally grabbed the menu out of my hand before I was done ordering. They have VERY strict rules here... And make no excuses exercising them. \"Breakfast will stop being served at 11am Sharp! (No ifs ands or buts)\" reads one sign... Another, \"restrooms for customers only\" - greets you on the door. The food was basic as basic gets... Worthy of a solid 2-3 stars... And the location is convenient if you live nearby, but that's it. So, if you aren't coming for service, and you aren't coming for food, then why bother coming at all? Pass on this joint..."}
{"text":"Open to 11 for breakfast. Convenient stop after riding at McDowell-Sonoran Preserve early in the am.   Good food."}
{"text":"Great friendly family run sandwich shop. They use high-quality ingredients and are always generous with their portions. If you're in the area I definitely recommend eating there."}
{"text":"This place is SOO yummy! Everything tastes so fresh! I don't know how they make a club sandwich taste so darn good, but they do!! They're soups are always super flavorful and delicious! This is our favorite place to go on our lunch breaks! Great food and great service!"}
{"text":"Great little mom and pop! Soup was amazing.  Easy eating for everyone.  Topped with the best flour free monster cookie ever. The owners are nice and personable.  This was a great stop after hiking. We will make it an after hike regular stop."}
