{"text":"You have to LIKE this kind of Chinese food - shopping mall food court style - the price is right and it's not bad, not great."}
{"text":"food took 2.5 hours to arrive - no apology from restaurant. no explanation other than they hadn't even started making an hour after I ordered. food was not very hot. I was really disappointed by the service and would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Don't ever order delivery from this place. I've waited for an hour and a half for the food (didn't even show up), called a couple times and no one picked up. Wasted $30."}
{"text":"Great eat in or takeout spot for chinese good.  Good amount of food and fills you up.  I get the combo a with 1 meat and 2 veg with fried rice for $6.75 (tax included). Also comes with choice of soup if you dine in.  The hot and sour soup is hearty and has good kick with nice peppery taste.  Decor is decent."}
{"text":"Decent solid place, with a good attitude. No-nonsense mall-style Chinese food in this clean and swanky new fast food eatery. It's just off the main drag of Chinatown, Spadina Avenue and Dundas, but far enough along Dundas to blend in more with the Alexandra Park neighbourhood, rather than the hustle and bustle of the spine of Chinatown. Combo 1, 2 or 3 means you get a choice of levels of price, with the top end at $4.50. Start with delicate Cantonese fried rice with layers of egg, or thick noodles in soy sauce, and move to the vegetables, long green beans, or broccoli covered in garlic, maybe cauliflower in a white sauce, then progress to the meat dept. Chicken, beef, pork, or fish, your choice and they're savoury and delightful, with the choice difficult given the attractive presentation under the glass. Delicately breaded shrimp, thin slices of beef with a dark sauce, thin fillets of salmon, all ready for the slinging. This is a blue collar lunch, worthy of chowing down if you have worked hard all day and deserve it. The portion is huge and satisfying. Friendly staff, with a hearty, NO PROBLEM! shouted out to me from them a few times, and well worth the deek off the main drag to go to Yoo J."}
{"text":"Tucked away in the back corner of a local mall off dundas, me and my friend just wanted a quick bite to eat, there was a nice special going on for 6.99, three choices of vegetables and one choice of meat, food was good, only thing that bothered me was how we were charged an extra quarter to be able to use our credit cards.  The woman who served us was friendly enough that, would probably to back if I was in the  area"}
{"text":"The new chinese server is a snob. My friend likes to eat here but i dnt like the server. They have lots of choices before but now I couldnt see fish, salmon, and much more. The server should be more friendly and aproachable this is not the first time I am disappointed with her."}
{"text":"This place is inside dragon city on the main floor. You may need to walk around until you find it since they don't have a sign sticking out.  It's just another chinese fast food place in chinatown with all the items sitting out in hot trays. They have bubble teas, desserts, combo meals, and noodle soups available.  The turn-over rate for the food doesn't seem too bad, as they were seen re-filling the trays during the time I stayed.  Place offers better disposal chopsticks, along with plastic spoons and forks. No washrooms inside, so you'll have to find one in the mall (I'm sure it's somewhere)  You get quite a large portion of food for the price you're paying. At this time, it's 6.99 for a 4-item combo which consists of your choice of rice/noodles, two types of vegetables, and a meat option (chicken, beef, or pork). For an extra dollar, you can get fish instead. It also comes with a bowl of chicken bone soup.  I got some fried rice, tofu, cauliflower, and some sort of fish with white meat.  Rice tasted ok. Not too greasy. Had some light flavoring. Tofu was drizzled with sauce, and had a slightly spicy flavor. Cauliflower looked like it was just boiled or steamed with no sauce, so if you enjoy the taste of regular cauliflower, this isn't too bad. Fish had no particular flavor either beyond its natural flavor. The soup had hints of ginger and something sweet, though I found it too much on the sweet side.  Overall, everything had very light flavors, but you get a lot of food, so I think it's pretty good if you just need to satisfy your stomach.  Only issue I had with the place was this one large fly that just kept flying around our table, and a dirty delivery bike parked beside the seating area."}
{"text":"This place is tucked away in the Dragon City Mall, on the main floor in a corner near Fashion Optical.  The first thing I noticed is that it's very clean, unlike the places in the food court of the Chinatown Centre a bit further south on Spadina.  This place serves fast food that is a little bit Manchu Wok/Tiki-Ming and a little bit Bourbon Street Grill/Caribbean Queen.  They have fried plantains and their sweet grilled chicken is a little bit like bourbon chicken.  The portions are huge and the prices are cheaper than the major chains.  The quality is also better in my opinion.    My parents and I ordered 2 combos (which is enough to feed 3 people).  We got 1 Combo #1 (1 meat, 2 vegetables, and rice or noodles) $6.59 and 1 Combo #2 ( 2 meats, 1 vegetable, and rice or noodles) $7.99.  FYI: Tofu counts as a vegetable.  So in all I got to try the chicken fried rice, sweet grilled chicken, spicy grilled chicken, stir-fried beef, mapo tofu, eggplant tofu and green beans.  The chicken fried rice has very little chicken in it, and not too much flavour, but it was soft and nicely cooked.  I liked the sweet grilled chicken.  It was like chicken char siu or a really sweet chicken tandoori, very reminiscent of bourbon chicken at Bourbon Street Grill.  The spicy grilled chicken was not that spicy, it was like a mild version of blackened chicken.  The stir-fried beef was tender and came with pieces of carrots, green peppers and onion.  The mapo tofu was soft and silky.  Eggplant tofu was deep fried and sweet and sticky (in a good way).  Green beans were a little oily but nicely done on the softer side of al dente.    This is not gourmet eating.  It's Chinese fast food.  For the price and quantity, it's an awesome deal.  I think that this place is better than Manchu Wok, Tiki-Ming and Caribbean Queen in terms of quality.  Probably on par with Bourbon Street Grill or maybe even a bit better.    I've noticed that the good reviews of this place on here are from people who dine-in or take out and the bad reviews are from people who ordered delivery.  Not sure why, but it's a pattern...  Anyway, I had take out and I liked it.  I will be back."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place when I was walking through Chinatown. I noticed it had a sign for ice cream rolls and it piqued my curiosity because I had always wanted to try the popular thai dessert at places such as Arctic Bites but never had a chance to. We decided to get two order of ice cream rolls, which was matcha and mango.  The person chopped up mango before adding the ice cream mixture and made our ice cream. He definitely knew what he was doing. He rolled up the ice cream perfectly and topped it with our choice of toppings.  The matcha ice cream rolls was made from a pre-made mixture but it tasted so creamy with a subtle but delicious hint of matcha flavour.  Compared to other restaurants, we choose our own toppings (up to 5 allowed). They have over 20 such as fruits, sprinkles, tapioca, popping boba, oreos, waffle crackers, pocky, marshmallows and sprinkles.   The service was really friendly and quick. For a creation such as this that only cost 5.99 which I feel is really worth it compared to other places because we get to customize our order, it's definitely a place to try out the next time you're in chinatown!"}
{"text":"When you set up ordering with a mandatory tip for the driver (which is fine) maybe it's best to let your driver know so they don't call us out for not tipping them again when they arrive. The spring rolls were inedible. The general tao was good, but the chunks were enormous and there was bones in the chicken.  And not only bones in that chicken, but there was bones in the chicken fried rice. ......... like, what!?! No way.  The broccoli and garlic sauce was the best thing we ordered and, luckily, I ordered it on my own as it wasn't part of the combo.  Will never order from there again."}
{"text":"Ordered through just eat. Food came quickly but due to weather conditions, the soup was spilt! The delivery guy helped clean up and then left to get another soup. He didn't speak the greatest English so I was concerned about getting my soup but it arrived within ten minutes!  Food was classic good Chinese food. Shanghai noodles, chicken balls, deep fried tofu, and egg drop soup. All decent. More a guilty pleasure then anything. 4 stars merely for the fast service and means of recouping the spilt soup!"}
{"text":"This small place that used to be a bakery is fantastic. Even though, it's tucked away on Dundas Street west of Spadina (Part of Dragon City Mall), the service was excellent. There's 3 different combos to choose from. You have the option of either rice or noodle, then choosing a variety of veggies and moving onto the proteins. There's also soup, salad and sushi if you choose to have any of that. I have gone to the place each time I am in Chinatown. To be honest, the menu items can vary sometimes so there's always something new to sample. Food is above par and cheaper than Manchuwok and Shanghai 360, the portions are more for $4.50+ while you're paying almost $10 for the same thing. Definitely check out this small restaurant when you're craving Chinese takeout."}
{"text":"This place told us 45 minutes to deliver but came in 15 minutes. The food was clearly left overs. It was not edible whatsoever. It was extremely heavy (probably MSG). Ordered 4 dishes and the portions were extremely expensive and paid $45. I promise that making instant noodles at home with spam would taste much better and will save you the money."}
{"text":"SO BAD!!!! I don't know why this got such good reviews.. How Asian people like this place is beyond me.. I'm Asian and eat a lot of Asian food and to say that places like Manchu Wok and Asian Gourmet just shows how bad this places was... I ordered it out of sheer laziness and the only place that does early delivery (I ordered at 1pm on thanksgiving Monday).. It only gets points cuz of early delivery and you can get a combo as opposed to getting a whole order of rice, a protein and a veg..  What I ordered:  Chicken fried rice: no chicken, no flavour General Tao: it was ok.. But I'm a sucker for fried chicken  Broccoli: good... French fries: I was craving fries so I thought how bad could it be.. Turns out, really bad.. Deep fried in in greasy Chinese oils.. And disgustingly oily Cantonese chow mein: how dare you call it Cantonese chow mein! It was noodles with soy sauce Spring roll: worse thing I've ever ate.. It was terrible.. Had a weird Asian taste Deep fried shrimp: it was ok.. Small though Spicy grilled chicken: such a shame... It was moist and cooked perfectly.. But the sauce was not good at all Chicken balls: pretty sure they're store bought.. Way too uniform to be homemade.. So where ever you bought them from, stop and at least buy them from m&m or costco  All in all... Go to Manchu Wok"}
{"text":"Summary: cheap, large portion, good varity, ok taste home cooking meal Price: around 7 for lunch box plus tax  I went this place a lot for lunch because it is so cheap to eat here. I saw some construction workers going here and order lunch to go, so this tell you about portion here. I would not need dinner after eating here. It is like typical Chinese food court lunch, but pretty cheap, and taste OK. For around 7 + tax, you could eat 2 veggie + 1 meat and rice. If you dine in, they also give you free soup. I like the fish option here, even it costs 1 dollar more. I would usually order 2 veggie + fish over fried rice. I recommend this place if you want to have a quick and cheap meal."}
