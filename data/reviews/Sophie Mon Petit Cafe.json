{"text":"This high traffic spot has been dusted off with a fresh new interior, well decorated and welcoming from the exterior. By appearances it seems to fit in well with the neighborhood. I wanted to love it because they did a great job with the space, but the menu and portions need some real work.

I visited with my wife and another couple. We ordered,
- Goat cheese and tomatoe flan: Tasty but the portion was more starter or snack than lunch and came with nothing else. 
- Bagel and cream cheese with smoked salmon: Pedestrian and missing anything to want us to come back for.
- Roasted Veg. and Goat Cheese Sandwich: The highlight of the lunch was satisfying but again portion was short and more snack than lunch.
- Tourtiere and tossed salad: While the tourtiere was forgivable the tossed salad was not. Withered lettuce with grit, had no seasoning and overripe cherry tomatoes. 

They have a few other salads in the display and some desserts. Again very pedestrian attempts and nothing that will garner a loyal following. Given that they opened very recently (Mid-September 2009) I would normally say I would go back in a month or so once they had worked out all the kinks. Unfortunately, I don't think it is worth the price of admission. Taxes and tip included for four our bill came to $50.00 and we left very hungry and less than satisfied. There are a large number of options close by and I think that the owners should have done a bit more homework. 

I wish them all the best but we probably won't be back again. 

Will post pictures of menu as they have no website yet, or table menus."}
{"text":"Great!
A new and vibrant locally owned and operated business in the neighbourhood.

Sophie has taken a dive and turned it into a cute place, nicely decorated and comfortable. Perfect for the area and a great alternative for a coffee and a pastry or a light lunch. I am glad there are daily specials and the choice of catering and take out.

We just got back from Itlay and decided this morning to go out for a coffee in the neighbourhood. Sophie's was a perfect choice. We sat and enjoyed a french press and a little morning snack. I had a great St-Viateur bagel with scrambled egg and swiss cheese, my companion had a delicious pastry wrapped pear filled with custard and marzipan. YUMMY! A great way to settle back into life here at home and a perfect morning pick me up.

Everything that we have tried on the menue at this new and bright little coffee shop has been a pleasure. My favorites though are the pastries, sweet or savoury. These little gems are all freshly backed in the kitchen.  The lemon tart and the Tourtiere are the best. I like to sit and have a quiet coffee and a scone again fresh made and the delicious creamy scone filled with yummy fruit. My partner enjoys the waffles and the crepes. 

Every time we go by there is something new and fresh to try out. I hope Sophies newness and fresh brigh attitude stays for a long time.

I am happy and pleased that this little shop has opened right here in the middle of Leslieville. Adding another dimension and some new flavours. I am glad that this is an independant owner operated store and offers such great choices in place of the international mass merchandisers or the super trendy, have to wait in line for a crowded table choices available in the area.

Thanks Sophie! I wish you the best!"}
{"text":"Had not been to Sophie since they had opened but I did remember the St. Viateur Montreal bagels they had.  You can get it with smoked salmon too (I need to go back to explore whether they walk down the street to get it from Kristapson's).  I enjoyed the tourtiere as well - great seasoning and the pastry was flaky but not too buttery.  

Cookies are kind of bland tasting like a shortbread - maybe good with coffee tho.  I think I'd try some of their other baked goods if I had a sugar tooth.  

Overall, I'm glad this place does not have bacon and eggs like every other brunch spot on the strip.  Small-ish menu, reasonable prices and bright corner location - good for a coffee and a lunch.  If you want a greasy breakfast boot-up head to the Tulip or similar."}
{"text":"Not much recent love for this place, so I figured I'd add my two cents.

First, Sophie isn't:
-A full-service, everything-made-to-order restaurant that offers dozens of meal choices
-Trendy, or a scene
-A destination spot that's necessarily worth crossing the city for

That said, Sophie is:
-A small European-style cafe where they focus on just a few things, and do them right
-A great east-end neighbourhood spot, perfect for a lazy weekend brunch where you don't want to sit amongst crowds and don't want to feel rushed
-A great place for a quiche and salad, maybe paired with one of their great baked-in-house scones or muffins, and an order of French-press coffee (trust me, get the Bodum, not their regular brew)."}
{"text":"I went in today for the first to try one of their dishes. It was called Poisson en papillote, which is baked fish in parchment paper. I never had this dish before and decided to have takeout and give it a try. I was utterly surprised later to find that the fish was raw and uncooked. I called them to let them know and they did not even offer me a free meal or my money back. If you're going to sell a dish at least know how to cook it. I was disgusted and will never step foot in there again."}
{"text":"My wife, cousin and I ended up here when we couldn't get into Lady Marmalade at 9:30 on a Saturday morning.

It has a bright, airy, yet stark interior  which took a while to warm to, but as it wasn't busy at all, it became a comfortable place to linger over breakfast.

The food and service were just OK.  My OEUFS A LA SOPHIE  (\"eggs folded with this week's filling, served on St-Viateur bagel\") was just exactly that.  Nothing else on the plate...no garnish, no nuthin'.  (This week's filling was swiss and mushroom...'twas tasty.)

My wife and cousin had the OEUFS A LA PROVENCALE  (\"eggs over easy on oven roasted tomato with garlic and fresh herbs, served with green salad and baguette\").  The baguette was what tipped their decision, but unfortunately it arrived with some kind of \"milk bread, because the baguette hadn't arrived yet\".  Perhaps our waitress should have told us that before.

Let's end with some good news/bad news.  The coffee was good, but they have no potatoes (home fries, hash browns, frites) on the menu.

All that said, I think it may still be worth a try if you're looking for something new in the 'hood."}
{"text":"What I like to do on Monday's with my mommy friend is ruin our awesome class of yoga with some counter productive food. So we decided to try out Sophie since we both had passed it a few times but had never gone in. 

The cafe is cute and minimalist - we had our carriers with us that day so no need to worry about dragging strollers in which is a good thing because there really isn't that much extra room. 

I ordered the portobello mushroom, carmelized onion and brie sandwich and wanted to motorboat it to death - it was fabulous! My friend had the scrambled egg and swiss on a bagel and I was eyeing it wondering how much her kid would really miss her if I killed her off for it. 

The waitress was super nice too and quick and made space for me to change the kid on a bench at the back of the store. 

Overall it was a great experience and I'll definitely make it back to sample something else off the menu soon."}
{"text":"Yelp didn't post my previous review of this place so I decided to copy and paste my review: I really give this a FIVE star but am just putting four so they won't think this is a phony review and filter it. What a load of crap.

It was by sheer luck that I discovered this delectable spot in Leslieville, Toronto. For those of you who want to divulge in sumptuous, delicious goodness, come to Sophie's. 

I discovered Sophie's just last year and I would probably say that I've been there about 20 times already. The food is incredible, the service is great and the ambience is comfortable, casual and simple. 

I've had practically everything on the menu - my favorite dishes are by far the Green Salad (they have an incredible white wine vinegar dill dressing that is just to die for), a savory potato leek soup (broth based and a nice deviation from the typical starch-filled puree ones that you would have at other restaurants), a caramelized onion brie and prosciutto galet, tourtiere, roasted vegetable sandwich with arugula and pesto. The frittatas and quiche are also great  -  a mushroom quiche that they have is especially nice. 

Try not to let those 2-star reviews scare you - this restaurant is nothing short of amazing. Let the food in the restaurant speak for itself. If you're like me and love to appreciate good food at a reasonable price in a non-pretentious atmosphere, come here. It's one of the best kept secrets in Toronto."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Sophie. Really cute decor, nice bright colours, great music. It looks like everyone agrees on these things. It also looks like everyone agrees on the food.

We went in for lunch. My mum got salmon quiche and I got a baguette with caramelized onion and portobello mushroom. I'm pretty sure that my mum didn't see that both the quiche and the baguette were taken out of the display case and reheated for our meal, or else she would have talked about it all day.

The portions were on the small side, the baguette was stale and REALLY DO I HAVE TO EXPLAIN HOW WRONG IT IS THAT A SANDWICH COULD NOT BE MADE TO ORDER? Honestly, keep the onions and mushrooms in a container in the back and slap them on the baguette when I order it. Even make it ahead of time and hide it somewhere. But please don't wrap it in plastic and keep it in a display case so that it's really obvious that my food is not fresh. Also, there are 3 bakeries within a 10-minute walk. There is no excuse for not having fresh baked bread products when you have that kind of access.

I was disappointed, but hope that Sophie makes a few changes that aren't huge to execute but make a big difference."}
{"text":"Poor Sophie, I guess some of us saw it coming. I hate seeing new businesses go under. It's not nice to say bad things about dead restaurants so I'll try to keep it nice.

The food was okay, the portions were small and left me hungry, there was no garnish to speak of on the plates, the wait person was devoid of appreciation for your patronage, and the menu was limited.

I hope you open a more successful restaurant in the future."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today and was surprised to see the negative reviews here. I echo people's comments on the nice, minimalist decor and welcoming vibe. 

I had the baguette with brie, portabello mushrooms, and caramelized mushrooms. Hopefully they read Jessica's review, because my sandwich was definitely made fresh. I had a seat and the waitress let me know that the baguette was still in the oven so it would be a 10 minute wait. I didn't mind at all, and my sandwich was fresh and tasty, served with mini pickles on the side. The baguette was warm with just the right amount of crispy-ness. She also brought me a jug of ice water while I was waiting and was very attentive, considering this isn't a real full service restaurant (more of a get your food at the counter style cafe). 

Looks like they have a nice selection of quiches and salads that change daily."}
{"text":"I was so excited for this place.  They did a great job decorating it and I peeked in the windows pretty often while it was under construction. 

I don't like the weak menu.  I really WANTED it to have bacon and eggs, which they don't.  This might be a problem with me, just wanting what I can't have... but it really deflated my joy when I saw a collection of sandwiches and pastries on the menu and no hot breakfast options, save crepes.  I just expected... more.

The good:
- I had a raspberry scone, which was good
- The ambiance and decor was good
- they were playing good music
- there are steps which discourages strollers (although it's not like steps are an impenetrable fortress of stroller haven)

The bad:
- limited menu
- busy at lunchtime
- no hot breakfasts
- basically NOTHING has bacon, which blows

Would I go back here?
Maybe if they changed their menu and added stuff that I like (like bacon),"}
{"text":"\"You live around the corner and you've never been here?!  Why haven't you come here?  Why do you wait until I come all the way from Austin to Toronto to go to a place like literally next door to your house.  

LOOK HOW CUTE THIS PLACE IS.  

Those waitresses were so nice to me.  You have no idea.  They brought my milk out all cute, they let me order just fruit a la carte then surprised me by asking if I wanted them to throw some granola together to go with it... 

Get the salmon quiche!  Get it!  I don't want to order it myself- I'll be fat!  But if you get it, and I just take two little bites; I get to try some and it doesn't count.\"

 I still can't believe you never come here.  Christ.

 If I lived with you in Toronto, I'd definitely come here.  I'd be here, like, every day.  Why don't they have wi-fi?\"

 (my rant to my friend)"}
