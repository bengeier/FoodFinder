{"text":"Quick, delicious and great price. Ordered 2 of their subs for delivery. They arrived very quick and they were large enough that I had one half for lunch and the other half for dinner. Tonight I tried their pizza and wings and happy I did. It was $10 cheaper than my alternative and only a 15 wait. Oh and delicious. One thing I will recommend for people like me who like a more saucy pizza is to request it, I will next time! Overall two very good experiences!"}
{"text":"I have been living in Parma for three years and have tried many pizza places.  Godmothers is by far the best pizza in town, I always recommend it."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of their bottled pasta sauces and I always wanted to try out their pizza place.  Well today's schedule accomodated this.  Tried some wings (hot), breaded mushrooms, an eggplant parm. sub. and a pizza with pepperoni, mushrooms and green peppers.  Rest assured if you want to wrap up the review here, I'd definitely recommend this place.  Everything was very good!  I was impressed with the wings which I just picked up as a simple \"add-on\" to my order.  They were very good as were the breaded mushrooms.  My least favorite of the group was the eggplant parm. sub.  While it was good, something seemed to be missing - it's straight breaded eggplant, cheese and sauce on a sub roll.  I guess for myself it could have used something else (pepperoncini, tomatoes, etc.) but, overall it was decent.  The star of the show though is the pizza. Good amount of toppings and the cheese they use is excellent.  Only thing I ordered extra sauce on the pizza and paid for it.  There was no way I could say there was extra sauce on the pizza.  Not a single drop of sauce fell onto the plate or was left in the box.  None the less, I would venture that this has to be one of the best pizzas in the Parma Heights area.  Note the store is in a Discount Drug Mart complex at York and Ridgewood Drive.  It's takeout only!  When I am in the area I will definitely go there for takeout.  It's well worth it!"}
{"text":"Although in the past I have given them a bad review, basically for the rude way I was treated. However I have been there a few times since because my boyfriend loves their subs and I must say things were different. Not only was I treated with respect but every time the food has been amazing. Best pizza I've had in a long long time!"}
{"text":"I do not live in Parma, infact, I live about 20 minutes away from it.  My coworkers told me about Godmothers pizza and how good it was, so after work one day I stopped by to try it.  I didn't know at first that it was a carry out only place, but when you walk in, you figure that out pretty quick, no tables or chairs.  So I ordered a medium mushroom pizza.  All I have to say is AWESOME!  I have not had sauce like that in a long time.  Plus the cheese combination is different than most pizza places, heavier on the Parmesan side, which is delicious.  Needless to say, when I got home, I had already eaten half of the pizza in the car and wife was not to happy... Oh well, it was to good to wait.  Since then, I have been back about 7 times and loved the pineapple and jalape√±o pizza!  Even though we live out I the way, whenever there is a talk of pizza, I drive out there to get it.  They really need to open more locations or change spots.  If they were on the west side, they would have so much business...  Definitely worth the drive.  Try it for yourself."}
{"text":"Very good pizza this is one of my go to spots when I'm in the area, cheesy garlic bread is to die for..."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite pizza in the area! Their sauce is the best! They also make a killer Stromboli.  Always consistent and delicious."}
{"text":"We ordered the Margherita pizza (40 pcs). The man at the counter was not helpful and actually rather rude. He was extremely stingy about giving literally five Paper plates and some red pepper even though we made a $30 purchase. He actually yelled at another employee in front of us since she offered us condiments. He charged us an extra $1 for a pinch of chili flakes. To top it off, the pizza was awful. You can't really call it pizza. It was more like a big piece of dry garlic bread (there was no sauce and barely and cheese on it). We will not be going back.  Oh and also if you buy a bottle of pop and ask for an empty cup they will charge you $1. Some of the most stingiest things we've seen happened here. Good luck getting napkins.there is no indoor seating and it's probably for the best."}
{"text":"We get the Chicken Parm dinner and order an extra bread, and this is MORE than enough to feed both of us and I usually have enough to take for lunch the next day.  It has always been delicious and fresh and the bread is soft and fresh.  The salad is basic, but it's included in the meal, the dressing is good I'd only suggest cutting the lettuce in a lil smaller pieces.  The spaghetti is good, not watery, the sauce is delicious and the chicken pieces are generous.  This is my go to, I don't want to cook, but I want good food meal!  And I am Italian, so this is an honest, true review!  Better(much) (and cheaper) than Olive Garden!  Everything I've gotten from here is great.  You might hear some yelling, but that's not much different from home.  MANGIA!"}
{"text":"Love their food. I've never had anything bad. The one guy that is always there can be a little rude sometimes. Regardless of the staff temperament the food is awesome! They are a little pricey. But food doesn't disappoint. Funny story. I called to place my order. They called me back for a name and phone number for the order. Lol  I always grab a jar of sauce for lazy days I want spaghetti but don't feel like making sauce."}
{"text":"If the pizza is anything like the Stromboli this place will turn out to be a really great find!  Stromboli was great!  Can't wait to try out some of their other selections."}
