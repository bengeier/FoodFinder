{"text":"If you are looking for a traditional italian restaurant that serves great italian food then this is the resto to go to. This restaurant is perfect for big group parties and special occasions. The resto offers wood oven pizza. Staff is super warm and friendly and interior is cozy and rustic ...as soon as you walk in you can't help but notice their beautiful wood oven. Their pizza's are truly tasty and they are very generous with their toppings. Truly enjoyed their food and would recommend."}
{"text":"La Vieille Cheminee has been around for years and is hidden way out in the suburbs.  They focus on serving the staples of Italian food (pasta, pizza, etc) and they do it well.  The service is always fast and friendly.  It's a great place to go when in the mood for Italian.

I always opt for the pizzas here.  They cook them in a wood burning oven which gives the crust a burnt flavour.  They also bring foccacia to your table with the bread that is always made fresh and is highly addictive.  If you aren't careful you'll be tempted to fill up on it instead if your meal!

If you're going to go for a dessert give the chocolate lava cake a try.  They serve it piping hot and it's always undercooked in the middle like it's supposed to be.  In my opinion it's their best dessert by a long shot though to be fair this is my go to standard here.

The prices are the major downside of this spot.  I find they are a bit too high given the restaurant is way out in Saint Leonard.  If it were in the Plateau or another neighbourhood similar to it they would be justifiable but this is the suburbs."}
{"text":"Je suis allée visiter ce restaurant à l'occasion d'un souper d'équipe avec mes collègues. L'endroit est parfait pour recevoir des groupes. L'ambiance est plutôt décontractée et assez calme. Malgré notre groupe d'une quinzaine de personnes et celui d'à côté, nous nous entendions bien parler. Niveau bouffe, rien d'impressionnant. Le veau au citron et vin blanc était plutôt insipide. Toutefois, les pâtes à la sauce tomate en accompagnement étaient vraiment goûteuses et dignes de l'Italie! En dessert, le baluchon de pommes avec caramel à la fleur de sel et crème glacée était intéressant, mais trop sucré et trop copieux à mon goût. J'y retournerais pour donner une chance aux plats de pâtes et aux pizzas, mais je ne sens pas l'urgence de le faire pour l'instant. Service impeccable!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and every time this place gets better! 

Osso-bucco is amazing, it wasn't 1 big piece but rather 5-6 smaller pieces (which are more tender) and the sauce wasn't too salty. 

Grilled Octopus is a must for an appetizer. It's not a huge piece but you don't need a big portion just good quality!

It's not the most easy place to find, behind the gas station. 
And it doesn't look like much from the outside but do try it, you will be back! 

Staff are friendly and speak both French and English ( for us that have a little difficulty with the French language) 

There is an out door patio that is covered and a good size, weather permitting eat outside!"}
