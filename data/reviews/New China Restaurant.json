{"text":"Okay first, they did not have regular tea, that's what makes Chinese food great! I love my tea, they only had some type of 'lemon tea' that they have in the fridge (Didn't try it)and I had a soda instead. The egg drop soup was a funny color and didn't taste all that great either. The food took at least 40 mins to cook and I was hungry (we had just left one restaurant to come here) the guy was cleaning the grill with a push broom and soap n' water before he could cook. The stuff was going up and down and sloshing all around, but I was HUNGRY! so I ate anyways. It was General Tso's for me, not sure what my buddy ordered, but mine was extremely 'chewy'. I hate having to drive all the way to Locust to be able to get decent Chinese! The food seriously lacked flavor! I was Starving at this point and still thought it was BAD!"}
{"text":"Not the best Customer Service, Last time i called in an order my husband picked it up, but didn't know that I had ordered her drink so didn't ask for it..  I called to let them know and they said they would give it to me the next time I placed an order.. That was this time.  I reminded them I didn't get my drink the last visit, and explained what had happened, their response?  \"No, No drink!\" Really!.? You just lost a customer over $1.69..? Okay.. I am a \"Principal-ist\" It's the point of it all."}
{"text":"Food is always really good and made fast! Though the folks inside are hard to understand when the women is not working in there ."}
{"text":"Great egg rolls, okay egg drop soup, my husband's General Tso's chicken was WAY too chewy, you could not even swallow it & we fed it to the dogs, my sweet & sour chicken was a little better but wasn't amazing.  The Broccoli was so hard and had zero flavor!  I'm used to amazing Chinese food back home."}
