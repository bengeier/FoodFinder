{"text":"Place is a quick stop to get your burger or breakfast sandwich...food is fine..I liked it...yes it costs a bit more...Fremont is right outside..if you want to price shop..
Breakfast Burrito seems to be very popular."}
{"text":"Nobody likes a long wait for food and soggy fries :-/"}
{"text":"We were staying at the Golden Nugget and wanted burgers, so we ended up here. Reading the reviews,  we were nervous but also didn't feel like going out. Maybe we got lucky but our experience was very good. We ordered 2 cheeseburgers, fries, coleslaw, and wings. The coleslaw wasn't very good but everything else was. Cheeseburgers were tasty and fries were lightly crispy. Just the way I liked them. Our order didn't take long (couldnt have been more than 10 minutes) at all and the service people were friendly."}
{"text":"Pricey but yummy! One of the best fries I have had. Pretty small place which can be missed very easily. Not much seating."}
{"text":"Really good Reuben! The best I've had in a long time. Was not expecting something that good from this little place"}
{"text":"I give this place a plus 10 rating. Food is phenomenal and so are the fries. I have been here the last 3 years and I'm back. Burgers and Pulled pork was yummy."}
{"text":"The only time we ate lunch in Las Vegas, we ate at The Grille. It's located inside the casino and serves sandwiches, salads and breakfast, also snacks like nachos and buffalo wings. They have a few dessert items, like cookies and ice cream, too. My husband had corned beef on rye and I had pastrami on marble rye. The sandwiches come with french fries, cole slaw or potato salad. Breakfast is available all day. The corned beef and pastrami sandwiches were good and hearty. We're from the east coast, where you can get a pastrami sandwich that can feed a family of six, so this was tamer in comparison. The meats were yummy and just what you'd expected them to be. They had good half-sour pickles, too. We saw people coming in to get food to take out."}
{"text":"We had a group of nine people. It look about 15 minutes to seat us and then another 10 minutes to take our order. We waited about 50 minutes before our meal came. A majority of our meals were cold and soggy. The plates average around $10 to $30 dollars depending what you get.

Not worth the money for the quality of food or service."}
{"text":"For standard breakfast food this is just ok.  The problem is there is not a whole lot around the Nugget to get breakfast.  If you stick to the basics it will be average.  The service for us the morning we ate here was very slow."}
{"text":"An average-quality cheeseburger and fries, at an above average price. I could have bought a steak burger for $10."}
{"text":"Ordered breakfast here, a breakfast burrito and a breakfast sandwich with Orange Juice. In totally it was about $17. 

Breakfast Burrito: Scrambled eggs, breakfast sausage, pice de gallo, black bean, cheese. It also comes with some potatoes. Menu price is about $6.50 and it doesn't come with a drink. Not too bad.

Breakfast Sandwich: Eggs, Sausage and Cheese. Pretty much like a Mcds Breakfast Sandwich. Except my sandwich was a bit too greasy, still good though! Also $6.50.

Overall the food was pretty good, decent prices. Combos don't come with drink."}
{"text":"Their cheese pizza is just gross, and it took such a long time. The food is horrible. The staff were very abrupt too. It was a huge disappointment. 

Years ago, before they remodeled, I believe the place was just called the Snack Bar, and the food was excellent. The cheese pizza was delicious and authentic, chicken tenders were yum, and sandwiches, hot dogs, pastries were top notch. Once Steve Wynn sold the place, the Golden Nugget restaurants and buffet started going downhill. I think this is probably rock bottom, because I refuse to believe it could get any worse."}
{"text":"Stay a way  from this shit hole. Waited over 30 min for a quesadilla. While everybody else in my group got there food at different  times."}
{"text":"You're at the Golden Nugget on Fremont Street.  It isn't the Four Seasons.  Grab some cheap grub at the Grille.  Let your kosher hot dog, grilled cheese sandwich or fries sop up some booze and then move on to the next destination.  If you're in a hurry, there's a Nathan's Famous Hot Dog cart posted about 30 feet northeast of the Grille inside of the Golden Nugget.  

I have to mention my favorite dive diner on Fremont is the Binion's Cafe.  If you're feeling bold, finish the evening with a plate of Country Fried Steak & Eggs, accompanied by a greasy spoon and stiff cup of Joe."}
{"text":"Slow, slow, slow. Also, they don't know how to do something basic like toast a bagel. I asked for 3 bagels to be extra toasted, and they came out barely even regular toasted. Supermarket quality crap at high prices. Did I mention they were slow, slow, slow?"}
{"text":"Before we left our Vegas trip we wanted to go to Fremont Street for a fun last day. Handsome's parent met up with us and we decided to grab lunch here and do some gambling before our flight. We all liked our food. Handsome, my FIL and I got burgers and my MIL got a club I think? Everything was good! It's not gourmet burgers but it was good for what it was!"}
{"text":"Always a good comfort food place to eat. The ladies and cooks always handle the huge crowd of characters who frequent this food stop. Very satisfying menu to select from when your taking a quick break from the casino, always a good choice for quick bite."}
{"text":"This is a basic refueling stop when you have been out of Fremont Street or just doing the whole Vegas thing and are in need of grub.

The prices are about what you would expect for being in a touristy spot.  Two of us stopped in the breakfast one morning and the total was just under $25 for two traditional breakfasts. 

the taste and quality was decent but being served on a Styrofoam clam-shell sure did lower the dining experience a wee bit.

Meh."}
{"text":"Food is decent. Pricey, but good sized portions and well prepared. I was disappointed they won't allow you to upgrade your fries and pay the difference. 

Refusing to allow upgrades or substitutions and the droll/unfriendly attitude of the cashier are the main reasons I dropped 2 stars. The place was pretty clean and for being inside a casino, it wasn't too noisy."}
{"text":"I ordered Sliders and Parmesan Garlic Fries. The sliders were nice and Juicy, and the fries were heavenly. Delicious Fries!:)"}
{"text":"They have the best chicken pesto sandwich!! You can't beat the price, $8, and it came with fries."}
{"text":"Every casino has a 24/7 diner/cafe type place that offers quick eats. For the Golden Nugget, that place is called \"The Grille\". And the creative name reflects the establishment - this is no 24/7 wait service dive diner with charm. It's quick counter-service style with a rather basic menu. 

Nonetheless, what I ordered was pretty good. The breakfast burrito, stuffed with chorizo, potato, and egg, is ample and filling for $6. Many cite the slow service here, but I didn't have an issue with the service. There are better places for late night eats on Fremont St, but this isn't bad if you are staying at the Nugget and want something quick and close."}
{"text":"The line gets extremely long!!!!! I waited in line for over 25min just to buy a $3 ice cream sandwich! NOPE! They should have a separate register open to make things go faster ... the 1 start is for the line."}
{"text":"This place was ok for a quick bite to eat... their was only one chef and a very long wait  about 20 min. the food was medium priced and was good.  would eat again if was hungry and didnt want to go to far."}
{"text":"No Room Service. 
No Take Out. 
Can't even call in an order for pick up. 
Hole in the hall in the middle of filthy cigarette smokers and drunk cougars.
Lots of obnoxious white people. 

BUT through all of that negativity is a place that has some good food. I purchased a Grilled Cheese Cheese Burger and holy lord was it amazing! Picture 2 grilled cheese sandwiches and a cheese burger jammed in the center! Very tasty totally worth the money!"}
{"text":"Came here on a whim. Ordered the Reuben and was not disappointed. Sat at the bar and watched the games that were on. Basically a no frills grille. Order at the counter and pick up at the counter. Very limited beer selection. But you come here for a quick bite and go elsewhere for drinks anyways."}
{"text":"Surprised at the lackluster reviews. A nice spot to grab a bite thats open 24 hours. I had a breakfast burrito for $6 which was huge and filling. My meal also took about 5 mins to come out which is standard for food actually being made."}
{"text":"Solid snack bar fare in a good people watching spot downtown, also conveniently located next to the GN's sports book."}
{"text":"We ate at The Grille twice during our stay at the Golden Nugget, once for breakfast and lunch. For breakfast, my BF and I each ordered a bacon breakfast sandwich... pretty reasonably priced at $8. It was a big sandwich! The bacon was crispy and there was a nice sized egg patty. The muffin was also really warm and everything was melty. Yum! The garlic parmesean fries were really fresh and tasty too a la carte.

For lunch I ordered their club sandwich, which always seems like a Vegas classic to me. I like how they subbed the usual extra piece of bread for more turkey :D. Their fries were also really hot and crispy. My BF ordered a BBQ cheeseburger. He thought it was delicious! Nice bun & patty."}
{"text":"We stayed at the Nugget with some friends. When we got in, they were already at the casino and we were hungry.  Our friends suggested us to run over to 
The Grille.  We thought it was good. My husband had a burger and I had a Turkey club.  It hit the spot.  We got there at a good time and our food came out about 15 min. or so.  Tasted fresh. 

 Not sure why all the negative reviews. I mean this place is in a CASINO and there are lots of people anyway.  This food is cooked to order, you can tell it's fresh."}
{"text":"Me and my friend's Reuben and Fried Chicken Tenders took THIRTY TWO MINUTES for it to arrive! 20 of those minutes were spent sitting on the window counter while the bitchy old cashier lady was processing new orders and tickets at a insanely slow pace.

As soon as I stood in line with my date, we both noticed one thing. Despite having only FOUR people in front of me, the line is moving SLOW, even for the cashier register!

Once we both got to the front, there was these two dudes on the bar trying to wake this other guy up because he was passed the fuck out. 

We ordered our meals, totaling almost $25, and I gave my name so they can call the ticket.

We waited, waited, and WAITED! We got our lemonades quickly, but as I was checking the time, I realized that the order was already taking more than 25 minutes. The bitchy grandma cashier/busser was walking by, I called her over to examine our ticket and the time. She rudely replied that it isn't done yet and stormed off.

Are you serious? Reuben's are composed of thinly sliced meat that can be cooked quickly, toasted bread, thousand island sauce, sauerkraut, etc. How the hell can the line not come up with my order within TEN minutes? My companion ordered her chicken tenders and fries, which is as simple as dropping both into the frying station. 

How fucking long does it take to cook thin meat and bread on a flat top? 

Both of us work in the restaurant industry, and we went straight to the front to reseat ourselves at the bar to keep a close eye on the line and the unsold tickets sprawled out on the counter. 

By the 30 minute mark, we saw our meals piled on the counter in to-go boxes. My girl tried to get the old lady's attention since the front is EMPTY. Grandma NEVER called my name nor our order number (#270). And then the old bitch fucking ignored her! 

When she finally \"found the time\" to give us our orders, my $10 Reuben got soggy from both the French fry grease and thousand island sauce and my friend's chicken tenders got cold and SOGGY from moisture. 

The sandwich was falling apart from torn bread as I was trying to hold it, this deformed, greasy pink and white blob with oil piling up on the bottom of the styrofoam box. My date took a few bites and decided to not finish her \"meal\".

We are not coming back. Not to this shithole where passed out drunks lie against the bar (and the staff indifferent to the entire scene) and deformed meth heads regularly line up in front of us with uncut and dirty nails. Yes, it took so fucking long for the orders to be processed that I began examining every single bit of detail of the scumbag regulars that come here. Nasty lack of hygiene, but particularly, the toenails of the crackhead couple in front of us are long, uncut, dirty, and PITCH BLACK! The lady looked like some sort of midget cave troll.

We only went here because all of the other restaurants inside Golden Nugget had closed."}
{"text":"Well not the best priced, but the food was good. We had an oatmeal, Caesar salad, Reuben sandwich, and burgers. Everything was good but the salad. The chicken had no flavor. The salads on fremont street were a lot cheaper and tastier. Sweet people though. Just a bit pricey."}
{"text":"Terrible, flavorless hamburgers on stale buns with mediocre fries.  Save your money.  Salads are premade & refrigerated."}
{"text":"Service wasn't great, the woman who took my order was not friendly. But the food came out quick and the Classic Reuben was extremely good! Would definitely eat there again to have this great sandwich"}
{"text":"Shared the huge Megaburger with wife and daughter and still managed to give a 1/4 of the burger to someone that asked for a couple of bucks. This thing was huge but most importantly it was very good. 

The Grille only has 6 tables so not a huge area but the service is pretty fast. Enjoyed my lunch and they had the TV's on the game so good to go.

Prices are a little high as there is a lot of deals in the area but if you want to stay in the Nugget this is a good place to go."}
{"text":"I was at the Golden Nugget for a convention and needed something quick to eat. Asked the people around for suggestions and decided to come here. They offer some sandwiches, pizza, salad and so on.

ATMOSPHERE
This specific place is surrounded by slot machines. Didn't like the cigarette smoke and loud noise coming out from the slot machines but it's a casino so what can I expect -_-

CUSTOMER SERVICE
none.

FOOD
After looking at the menu, decided to get a chicken focaccia. It was pretty good!
Fries had some spice/seasoning and was tasty. Chicken focaccia was tasty as well. It reminded me of gyro for some reason. Other people mentioned here that price is a little high but I felt that chicken focaccia was worth the price I paid($9.72 including tax).

OVERALL
It was a ok experience for me. Food was pretty good but wouldn't come back just for that. Food came out in less than 15 minutes which was fast. If you are looking for something quick to eat inside the Golden Nugget then this is it, just don't go with high expectation."}
{"text":"Stopped in to grab food before I went to my hotel room and had a great time waiting for my food. The one staff that helped me made my morning with his retorts to my \"jokes.\" I ordered a cheese pizza and steak nachos, which was pretty good (considering it beats the microwaveable pizzas I get from the grocery store... and the nachos were larger portions compared to the nachos I get from Taco Bell).
Cons: Price is as expected in Vegas, I suppose.

TLDR: If you're hungry, this place hits the spot if you're staying at the Nugget."}
{"text":"There's really nothing spectacular with the food at the Grille Inside the Golden Nugget.  The Golden Nugget actually has a lot of other food options.  I always find the Grille convenient, quick, and the dirt cheap.  The menu is basic and consist of all-day breakfast, burgers, hot dogs, grilled cheese sandwiches, and salads.  The service from the cooks have always been great. Overall, I can't knock The Grille because it is what it is and it's basically a fast food restaurant inside the Golden Nugget."}
{"text":"Came down to get a nice meal from this place with about 5 other friends. Ordered, got my sandwich and fries meal sat down to eat and I notice the sandwich that originally is already made with avocado did not have any so I'm about to get up to tell them and then my friend states there is something wrong with the tomatoes in his sandwich. The tomatoes had a weird brownish moldy looking part on it and realized yes the tomato is molded. I get up to tell the staff about the avocado and the tomatoes and they tell me, \"Oh its just from the seed\" (the tomato) But sure enough i let them know it was not from the seed because I then notice MY sandwich also has that brown in it as well and it was a big section of the tomato. So then I ask about my avocado. The lady says \" Oh yea we don't have anymore avocados\". I then say well you couldn't have told me that in the first place? The sandwich was about 10$ or so and I state arent I basically paying for the avocado? They then gave me my money back as well as my friend woth the bad tomato. All in all their service was not great I didnt not eat my food and will never go there again."}
{"text":"I stopped in to for a bite before work and to watch the start of the Alabama-Notre Dame game (the Sports Book was full) and ordered the Reuben Sandwich and coffee. The cashier told me the sandwich came with chips but for $1 more I could get fries. That was a really good up-sale. The sandwich was delicious but when I pushed my cup up for a refill, I was informed that the refill was $1 \"but if you had ordered a soda, the refill would have been free''. REALLY!?! I wasn't happy and said so. She just stood there staring at me. I told her that I appreciated being told about the dollar for fries but that I didn't appreciate not being told about the coffee. I felt that they were more interested in making their money and didn't really care about the customer. I paid for the refill but took it out of the tip I had set aside. Needless to say, I will NOT be going back there again, based on principle! I really expected better customer service. Especially since two of their restaurants AND the employee dining room had just recently been shut down by the Health Department for roaches."}
{"text":"Great food! We ordered the onion rings and the Reuben and the food was amazing! Nice and hot and very fresh. Very impressed. Thank you so much! Will be back again for another meal for sure"}
{"text":"With so many eateries located in the many Casinos around Fremont Street. This is a mediocre attempt at a snack bar/grill. The place has only one cashier and one cook. Everything is made to order(which is good) however, can you imagine the wait for your food when there is only one cook. Can you imagine the line when there is only one cashier?  We had experienced that the night we went their. I wasn't hungry so my husband ordered a patty melt and I shared with him. The taste of the sandwich was average at best. The wait wasn't long because we got there when there was nobody in line. As we sat there more people came and a line formed. The wait was about 10 minutes for everyone to get their food. Prices are average but not cheap. I would say explore Fremont Street, their are other places that you can dine for the same amount of money and get better quality food. Oh btw, if you park at the Golden Nugget, the Grille does not, I repeat, does not validate your parking, even though it says that Golden Nugget Eateries will validate."}
{"text":"Pricey for what it is, but I wasn't expecting greatness anyways. If you are inside the GN and are in a hurry and need to grab something quick, come here. BTW they don't validate parking tickets."}
{"text":"Ate here a few times during our stay. It's a good quick service option. The quick depends on how busy they are. They give you huge portions. My boyfriend and I learned after the first visit to share as items are a la carte. They have your traditional sandwiches, burgers, chicken fingers, salad, etc. The garlic Parmesan fries are really good."}
{"text":"Man, I needed a quick fix after a night downtown and we literally stumbled upon this place.  

I can't really say much as I was really drunk, however I do remember that the place is pretty small. There's a bar countertop and maybe a few chairs.   Little quaint place inside the casino.  The cashier who helped us was cordial and she even joked around a little with us which made it a great interaction.  

For the food, I got the mushroom swiss burger.  I can't remember the cost, however, I remember paying around 10 bucks for that and a shared appetizer of some sort.  What I do remember though, is that the burger was not flavored.  I thought it was super bland.  I the mushrooms were perfectly carmelized and the swiss did bring a little flavor, but the star of show (or supposed to be), the burger, wasn't really seasoned.  I really did enjoy the fries however.  They were super crispy and shoe string-ish.  My preferance!

All in all, it was an ok kind of place.  Not much to choose from that late at night but it did the trick!"}
{"text":"This was pretty expensive I think for a small bowl of oatmeal and a cup of coffe it was 12.99 that is crazy I think. I only ate there the one time because of cost. The oatmeal was only ok and we did not get milk with it and no toast oh well lesson learned"}
{"text":"This place is definitely not worth it.  Compared to the other restaurants in the Golden Nugget, this one lays goose egg and not a golden one.  I almost never recommend other places, but the Cafe in Binion's across the street is way better than this place.  It is open 24/7 and even though it is usually very busy they are really good at moving people through there."}
{"text":"How much does Tillman Fertitta, the self-named \"Billion Dollar Buyer\", charge for a gallon of barbecue sauce? What if I told you it was $207.36 per gallon? Lets do the math. 

There are 768 teaspoons to a gallon. When you order the barbecued pulled pork sandwich at the Grille inside the Golden Nugget in Las Vegas, Mr. Fertitta puts almost no barbecue sauce on the sandwich. 

Even if you asked the people working there to look at the sandwich (see picture below) they will gladly SELL you 2 teaspoons of barbecue sauce for for
 $.54. So let's go back to the equation. 

If there are 768 teaspoons to a gallon and Mr. Fertitta gives you two teaspoons of barbecue sauce at a price of $.54, how much is he selling his customers a gallon of barbecue sauce for?  

I admire Tillman Fertitta. The guy is brilliant. He sells barbecue sauce at a price that no human being on the planet can replicate. And people actually buy it if there's no barbecue sauce on their barbecued pulled pork sandwich at the Golden Nugget in Las Vegas. 

If you think you are smarter than Tillman, you show me that you can sell barbecue sauce for a price of $207.36 per gallon and I will be very impressed! 

In this case the people working in the restaurant ultimately relented, and brought me 2 teaspoons
of barbecue sauce at no charge. But they clearly did not want to do it. By the way Tillman, you have showed me that I need to up my game on what I sell products for. I'm coming after your barbecue marketshare buddy"}
