{"text":"I've eaten here twice. Both times the food tasted great, but the second time I ordered to-go and discovered that the portion was extremely stingy upon my arrival home. I ordered a large bowl--they have the sizes out so you can see the portions you can expect for a regular and large bowl--and the large bowl was half empty. Like...it very easily could have all fit in a regular sized bowl. For extra $$ (the bowl was more than $15) I would expect the portions to be accurate. The portions for the protein were okay, and I understand that the seafood ingredients are expensive, but the rest of the bowl is rice and other really cheap staples. Being stingy on rice makes no sense, especially at $15 a pop. May or may not return."}
{"text":"I've been to Poke Poke for lunch a couple of times so far. The poke is really good. They have a half dozen house creations or you can build your own. I start with a house creation and then slightly modify it. The ocean feast includes tuna, salmon, white tuna, scallops, shrimp, octopus, cabbage, onion, nori, ginger, and tobiko. I substitute brown rice and a lemon ginger sauce. So good! There are about ten different proteins including chicken for those who don't like seafood. You can choose from a dozen fruits and vegetables, another dozen toppings and a half dozen sauces. There are three types of rice or greens for the base. There are two sizes. It is completely customizable so you can get exactly what you want.

It's an order at the counter and they deliver it to your table situation. Drinks are available near the counter. They also have a few sides and desserts your can order. The interior isn't impressive,but the staff are always very friendly and the food is fresh and so delicious! It's not cheap but it is really good! We'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Not anything special but not horrible. Poke is my favorite food in the world, so maybe I'm just holding to a high standard. I live in Phoenix and regularly get Poke there. I was surprised to see only 2 poke places in the whole town of Madison. Not going to lie I was not impressed walking in. The cashier was not knowledgeable and told me he could not use my printed out Groupon, also charged me extra for seaweed salad when it was one of the included sides. All I said is \"I like seaweed salad can you give me a decent amount in my bowl.\"

I got a build your own. I was a little unimpressed at the quality of the appearance of the ingredients in the build your own items. I also was unimpressed at the amount you get for the price. I got the regular size bowl which was $10.99 which was sadly small and is more like an appetizer size. In Phoenix, I get a *small* order which is about twice the size and $2 less. 

The only redeeming factor was the quality of the food. I was worried about eating raw fish in Madison. The taste was great. Make sure to get the chili mayo. I was sad the bowl was so small that my food was gone in 5 min!"}
{"text":"I'm usually torn between Poke on Monroe (Miko Poke) and Poke on Willy (Poke Poke). Poke Poke has an Asian flare vs the Hawaiian version in Miko Poke. This Poke tends to have fresher ingredients, I really like the house creations and I love the mochii. Can't go wrong with either in my opinion. I get Poke Poke when I don't have time to deal w/Monroe street construction and want some mochii."}
{"text":"Great little poke place.  Seafood tasted fresh.  The atmosphere is clean and crisp.   Pleasant employees.   The flavor was a little underwhelming."}
{"text":"I like the feel of this restaurant. Also, the poke bowls are all very delicious! If you don't like raw food, you can also order eel bowl or curry chicken bowl."}
{"text":"New poke spot in the downtown/east side of Madison? I definitely had to stop by! 

I completed my order online for carry out, after work. The website was easy to use and had to option to link to FB--so why not? Especially since the site offers a free bowl after ordering 10 times through the site. The site gives you the option to pick up as early as the next 15-20 minutes. I ordered two custom bowls, a large for the Hubs and regular for myself, and opted to pay in store. 

I arrived 15 minutes after ordering. Parking was probably the worse part of this experience. The lot is small and shared with several other businesses. I parked around the corner, across from Wah Kee. A young lady greeted me and had my order ready to go. She was nice, and we chatted quick about how business is and the parking. She said it was probably due to the CrossFit classes occurring during this time. I'm here thinking, what a great place for these CrossFit'ers to eat! Decor was basic, but tables and chairs were plenty! 

Poke bowls were delicious! Vegetables and protein were fresh, and plenty. The fruit (mango and pineapple), however, seemed like they might have been canned. The other flaw was that my regular sized bowl didn't leave much room for me to mix ingredients/flavors. I'm also a huge sauce fanatic so next time I order, I will likely request for extra sauce on the side."}
{"text":"It is interesting that three new poké places opened in such a short span of time, and hopefully the hidden location of this place doesn't lead this one to disappear too quickly. It was deserted on a Friday night. We got ours to go, regular size, and the portions were quite large. We were both stuffed. Not quite as many topping nor sauce offerings as some of the other places - and kinda weird to have sweet corn as an option? We both got ahi, which was fresh and yummy, as were all of the toppings. I especially enjoyed the fresh shredded kale. The chili mayo wasn't very spicy, so we added more hot sauce when we got home. The lemon ginger sauce really overpowered the delicate flavor of the ahi, so I wouldn't get that again. Once we get our optimal topping mix for our palates figured out, this could be one of our new faves."}
{"text":"My first visit here. Great options and generous portions. I got a small bowl and it was more than enough. Each bowl is made with care and visually appealing. Can't wait to go back and try more."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite poke place in Madison. It seems like poke places are popping up all around Madison as of lately and I've tried most of them. Poke poke blows the other places out of the water. The ingredients are quality and incredibly fresh. They make their own spicy mayo and it's incredible. The Hawaii green (I think that's the name) is my favorite- the crunchy onion string topping combine well with the mayo and jalapeños to form a flavorful  kick. All of the ingredients compliment each other leading to one incredibly satisfying poke bowl. I would eat here everyday if could. Other places I've tried have not held up to the same standards. This is my go to place in Madison"}
{"text":"Yes to Poke Poke! I ordered a regular-size build-your-own poke bowl for lunch, with purple rice as the base, scallop, octopus, and crab for protein, and edamame, kale, carrot, red cabbage, corn, daikon, crispy onion, cucumber, seaweed, scallion, tobiko, and tamagoyaki as toppings, all tossed together in a chili mayo sauce. I was blown away by how delicious and fresh it was! They were generous with all the ingredients, and I was even more delighted to find out that the $2 crab add-on was real crab, not the imitation stuff. I'm so glad that we have a poke place on this side of town now, so I don't have to trek through the Monroe St construction to get to Miko. Poke Poke is a welcome addition to the Willy Street neighborhood, and I'm looking forward to trying their house creation bowls next time!"}
{"text":"very high quality fish and crisp/clean interior.  wisconsin snow is a clever name for a bowl.  had the hawaiian green bowl, which was great and I'll probably get again. they had infused water, which I always like too.  staff were very friendly. glad to have a good poke place in the neighborhood :)"}
{"text":"Fresh, creative, friendly.  This is a simple but graceful place that's quick and delicious."}
{"text":"If someone visits Madison and asks for a Poke place, this is where I would recommend them to go. The price is a bit more premium than other places, but I really appreciate them mixing all ingredients with the sauce together prior to serving them in a bowl. This is the true way to prepare Poke in mainland USA, and allows customers to enjoy the intended flavor.

Pro:
- Ingredients are mixed together before serving, allowing flavor to be equally blended
- Condiments and furikake are available as toppings on the table
- Vast selection of toppings and proteins

Con:
- Premium pricing
- Takes time for them to prepare a bowl

Over time, they need to find the perfect balance between mixing all the ingredients and preparation time."}
{"text":"I should preface this by saying that I don't love poke. I went with a friend who does love it.

We visited around 6:30 PM on a Wednesday night. Parking was sparse, but the restaurant wasn't crowded. Service was fast and friendly. (Many people stopped in for takeout during our meal.)

I built my own bowl (with tempura shrimp), and my friend had the signature ocean feast. We both had the regular size bowl (not the large) and no drinks. The total was just under $30. The bowls were made to order with fresh ingredients.

You order at the counter and food is brought to your table. You pick up your own condiments and utensils. There was a water station that was stocked with small paper cups (like bathroom cups).

The atmosphere was...eclectic. The decor was a mix of Asian and beach that just didn't work for me. 

I was left feeling underwhelmed. I know high quality, fresh ingredients are expensive, but $30 seemed expensive for dinner for two. A little extra something (like improved atmosphere or more attention to details in the experience) might have made for a more positive experience."}
{"text":"Great new poke place! Cozy little restaurant and staff are very friendly. They have a great variety of Japanese sodas and teas available, which I thought was cool. They're also very generous with the sushi portions in their bowls compared to some other places I've been to. Everything tasted delicious!"}
{"text":"You order at the counter and they bring it out to you! It took awhile to come out but it's worth the wait! I got the Hawaii Green because I wanted some spice. The jalapeño and chili mayo brought some kick but I ended up putting a bit more Sriracha to get some more ;) Definitely fresh, savory and filling. I wasn't able to finish the regular size and gave the rest to the bf. They deliver and are close by so I'll definitely try other types of their bowls when I get a chance!"}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious poke. Salmon, shrimp, tuna, scallop are all fresh. I love the cute octopus  So sad today the snow crab salad is sold out. Did not have a chance to try...
If you are a fun of sushi and sashimi and poke style food, you are welcome to have a try though the price is little higher than my estimation. 

Also I wish the sushi/protein part and rice part ratio is reversed. I mean more protein and less rice since I am not a fun of rice. Just asking too much. Haha.
The other thing is that I think for me the rice is a little under cooked but my friend loves this taste/feel! 

All staff here are very friendly. The environment is clean and nice with simple but beautiful decoration! The milk tea is yummy!!"}
{"text":"First time eating this genre. Loved the Signature dish of many varieties of cooked and raw seafood. Delicious sauce and warm creamy rice with sprinkles of nori and a good helping of other seaweed and pickled ginger convinced me that Poke is WAY better than sushi. 

Guy behind counter was very pleasant and helpful."}
