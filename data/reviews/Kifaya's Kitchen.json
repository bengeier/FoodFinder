{"text":"Fantastic and delicious food. Extremely authentic food and experience. Happy to support a local business and female owner."}
{"text":"Very small family run location, but AMAZING FOOD!! I was in town for work for a few weeks and just happened to spot this place, what a great find. I will definitely be back. Hats off to the chef!! It's in a sketchy part of town, but if you enjoy good quality middle eastern cuisine you have to check this place out."}
{"text":"They made us a vegetarian dish with all kinds of veggies, beans and rice.  Had this amazing spicy sauce and also a mild white sauce my husband really liked.  Super sweet ladies behind the counter.  Eat here and support small business!!"}
{"text":"My partner and I tried this place out for dinner tonight. We weren't sure of their hours, as it's quite hard to find information about the place online. Anyway, we gave it a go around 7pm on a Sunday, and they were open!  A few people were at the counter when we arrived, and there were four women in the kitchen with a couple of babies runnin' around, crashin' into things and causing a ruckus (I knew I was gonna like this place). We ordered the chicken and goat (the latter being the favorite, but duh), both prepared with spices, bell peppers, and onions and a heaping side of aromatic rice. Their hot sauce is limey and delicious. You'll definitely need it if you're after some jazzier flavors. The food itself is pretty basic, though thoroughly delicious. It's Ramadan right now, so they had some special meat pies for $1 each. We snagged two of those, plus our entrees for just $22.  Bae's already got a secret wager on how soon I'll suggest we come back, so, you know, maybe we'll see you there."}
{"text":"Delicious food, friendly service. I had the vegetarian,my boyfriend had the fish. A lot of food, all of it savory and very, very good. My boyfriend even suggested getting it as takeout and having it in the park when the weather gets warmer. There were a bunch of people there when we were,and I felt like I was having dinner at someone's house.The ladies who are cooking are wonderful- they even made some injera for me, and it was the best I've had. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"This food is amazing and you will become addicted to it if you try it! Everything here is great, you can't go wrong. The rice is cooked in homemade broth, and the flavors layer up from there. Don't forget to ask for bread, and definitely don't forget the green sauce! Great restaurant. Catering, too."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious and Kafaya was pleasant and welcoming to this English only speaker. Fresh ingredients, delicious tilapia and I loved the beans! The hot sauce is great too - quite hot!"}
{"text":"My sister has been raving about Kafaya's Kitchen for weeks.  It's a tiny restaurant run by Somali refugees (you can read about the family here:  http://www.cleveland.com/business/index.ssf/2013/10/welcoming_refugees_pays_off_fo.html)    I finally got to sample some takeout last night for dinner.  I haven't personally been to the restaurant yet, but plan to go soon.  I'm told it's very small inside, so not a place to go with a large group.  There are no menus, just chicken, goat, and vegetarian meals.  We got vegetarian and chicken meals.  The portions were huge (3 adults and 1 child shared 2 meals), cost only $8 each, and come with a can of pop.  My sister said the dine-in experience was much better, with breads and sides.  On her previous visit the vegetarian meal had several vegetable accompaniments, while our takeout dinner had rice, pea soup, and salad.  The chicken dinner had rice, chicken with onions and peppers, and salad.  If you go, ask for some of the white hot sauce!"}
{"text":"Authenticity and an adventure in eating even though simplistic by nature.  You'll probably pass on eating there but head up to Edgewater park to complete the outing.  Considering the current bent of Cleveland's trendy places with uncommon parts of animals, weird veggies, artful but skimpy plates and high prices, this food seems rather tame.   Lots of rice, grilled peppers/onions and either chicken, fish (tilapia) or goat with a wonderful, huge piece of naan-like bread and the good vibes flow throughout your body.  A side of red onions/cukes/radishes is delightful and rounds out your to go box, and while you see the sign that says place your order, have a seat for 15 minutes while waiting for the freshly cooked meal to arrive, you won't mind as you sip the chai tea with milk (and a distinctly Indian hint of cardamom).  Everyone around you will be speaking a distinct middle-east dialect, but for us it just validated the whole experience."}
{"text":"As others have said, it's a very basic dining room. There are menus up at the counter and you just tell them what you want and have a seat. The menu is pretty simple. I had the chicken and rice dish and it was delicious. It smells great as they are cooking everything and the staff are very friendly. We went on a weekend and they had samosas too and those were a nice addition. I have never had Somali food and didn't know what to expect, it's a Mediterranean and Indian spice palette. The starch options were rice (which was delicious), pasta or chapati. There's bottles of spicy sauce on the counter that went well with the samosas, but definitely had a bite if you like hot. We also had the tea with milk, which was sort of like Indian masala chai. It's at the lowest end of the $$, I think each entree was $11, so it's a cheap, delicious and filling meal. We got a container for takeout that managed to satisfy a hungry teenager, so you get your money's worth."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of trying different foods off most peoples radar and this sure fit the bill today. What a fantastic find!!!! A coworker and I walked in with no idea what to expect. I asked for some direction to help me with the menu and found it very unhelpful as it all sounded wonderful. I asked if they had a sampler platter so we could try everything and let me tell you they delivered huge. Every bite of chicken, goat or tilapia left me wanting more until I finally had to tap out."}
{"text":"My brother and I was in town for Easter weekend 2018.  We ordered the Goat n Rice, Vegetarian n Rice, both came with soda - total bill under $20 (to go).  As authentic as it gets.  We live in NY, and it's rare to find great food outside of NY, but this place is definitely AWESOME!!!!"}
{"text":"Yes, serious food zone here. Two longer tables, with a window to the kitchen. Very little between you and the people making your food, which is tremendous."}
{"text":"Spectacular food!! They don't mess around, aerious cooking happening here. You give your order , go sit, wait 15 minutes! Don't complain, it's fresh and delicious! I was hesitant to enter in the begining since the place doesn't look like a fancy restaurant but oh my! Was I happy at the end!  Ladies! Congratulations, awesome job, decent prices. Definetely will come back"}
{"text":"Must try combination of a new cuisine and comfort food. Portions are huge and well priced. Tried a goat dish and a chicken dish, both were amazing. Samosas were so good, I wish some how I had room for more. Had enough leftovers for a whole meal. Highly recommend, already look forward to going back."}
{"text":"Excellent, authentic food. We waited about 5 minutes for the take-out and it was extremely savory. Great amount of food given, as well. Of course not the best ambience but the food is really, really good. Might come back again when I'm craving African food again :-)"}
{"text":"I was very happy with my take-out experience at Kifaya's.  The lady who took my order of rice with goat was very pleasant and patient to show me the vegetable choices (I tried all of them) and insisted that I MUST take a drink, which was amusing.  I chose coffee, which turned out to be sweetened and flavored with cinnamon and cardamom, and was delicious.    Portions were very generous, enough for two meals, really.  The food was home-style, which is to say wholesome, nutritious, and flavorful.  Prepared with love!"}
{"text":"This is currently my favorite restaurant. I come all the way from SF to go eat here. I tried many of their dishes and KayKay with goat now is the one I usually order. This is very interesting food. I would describe it as a mix of many different cultures. You got samosa, then you got goat meat and bread that is very close to an Italian piada. The KayKay has what I would call a goat meat stew, with beans and bread mixed in. Simply incredible! The people working at this place are always super nice, and the customers too. Worth a drive to go there, what the heck, worth flying across the country."}
{"text":"Tea is excellent.. chapatti bread is tasty .. the rest of the food is ok .. had hair in one of my items which was a major turnoff. Samosas we got were overcooked .. we sat in  and ate which was not the best experience .Place needs major updating if they want people to enjoy dining in. Old torn seats.. not that clean. Surely not a date night place .   I was hoping for better than it was ..."}
{"text":"I was introduced to Kifaya's Kitchen through SPACES-they had an opening ceremony and provided some yummy foods from the restaurant.  I was so impressed, my boyfriend and I decided to order carry out for dinner last night.  Like others have said, it is small, however there were two groups of people enjoying their meal and didn't seem crunched for space at all.  I ordered the Fish w/ Rice and Beef Samosa.  The fish was tilapia (which I don't really like), but the flavor and spices they used turned it around for me.  Needless to say, I ate it ALL!   I loved their rice pilaf too, and they were so generous with the portion.   Now, the Beef Samosas were the star of this meal!  They were only $1 a piece and I wish I would've ordered more!  My only advice is to make sure you order more than one =)Only negative thing, was they added some lettuce and lemons on the side as some kind of garnish, however the lettuce was brown and wilted and the lemons were old as well.  I just tossed these aside though, and continued eating all the yummy foods. Give em a try, you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Excellent food, generous portions, quick service.  My favorite take-out destination. I ask for the seasoned rice with vegetables, no meat, and it is superb.  Don't let the modest  exterior fool you; there is a treasure of tasty treats just waiting for you inside!  Went there again today, 7/2/18.  Still awesome!"}
{"text":"Never had Somali food before, but it was amazing. Rice was perfectly cooked the goat was tender and flavorful and the stewed vegetables were the best part! The samosas were a little greasy but they were still the best samosas I've ever had. Restaurant is tiny but the passion and love makes the place feel bigger."}
{"text":"This off the beaten path restaurant has the best goat and fish in Cleveland! The take out servings are big enough for two meals. The service is fast and the prices are really good."}
{"text":"First place I've tried Somali cuisine! It's very small and got hot with the door closed, but they were very accommodating for our large dining-out group of ten (with reservation). Decor is minimal. Orders are placed at a counter (where you pay at the end), and food is brought to the table. They mixed up a few orders in our large group but promptly addressed them without complaint (eg chicken samosas instead of beef were placed on our table while the appropriate order was prepared.). Drinks and bananas were brought out while we waited for food. There is a sink in the dining room for hand washing.  Quality of food was excellent! It is reminiscent of Indian food.  I had goat with rice and vegetables. Portions were enormous including a variety of veggies--lemony salad strongly scented with parsley, peas and potatoes, greens and okra, and white beans. The goat was on the bone (with marrow), tender and flavorful. Hot sauce and ranch were brought out in squeeze bottles. Others in the group pasta (spaghetti) or Kay-kay (grilled chappati mixed with goat gravy) instead of rice. We also tried samosas which were flavorful with delicate pastry. We also had a side of sabaayad which was like a slightly sweet griddled bread--delicious!  Parking is tight and I had to wait for someone who had double-parked behind me to move their car so I could leave, but the food is delicious and unique enough to warrant the drive all the way out here!"}
{"text":"Amazing! I wish there were more places like this. Kifaya is actually in the kitchen we got to meet her and her daughter. Both of whom are super kind and welcoming. The place is small but the food is phenomenal.   There are some dishes and days that the food is better than others and sometimes the food is more generously spiced and extremely flavorful. But even on the worst days I'd still come back.   Really a great place to try some somali food I only wish there were more African restaurants to try.   It is however a very casual place and seems more oriented to take out based on the small size and amount of tables, however I've never had trouble dining in although there doesn't seem to have a full dine in feel but more of a meal at a friend's house where you're comfortable enough to get your own silver ware."}
{"text":"Food is absolutely delicious and everyone was extremely friendly and hospital. Also, the coffee is spiced and tastes like no coffee I've ever had (very good). Definitely recommended for take out or if you're looking to try something different than most places in Cleveland. Will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Hole in the wall place run by a Somalian. It's a simple menu, pick rice or pasta, and then your meat - goat, chicken or fish. Portions are big. We had a party of 6 and she gave us 2 plates of complimentary veggies and beans, which were really tasty. I ordered the fish which was AMAZING! My husband really enjoyed the goat too. One star off for the physical restaurant itself. It's not cozy, the chairs are old and rickety, and the only water you can get is bottled. So it's probably more of a take out place. But 5 stars for the food. And the owner/chef is really sweet and friendly too."}
{"text":"Heard about this and place through a Facebook group. Boy am I glad I gave it a chance! No set menu, just tell the ladies behind the counter if you want fish, goat, chicken, or vegetarian. The food is beautifully spiced!! The goat was tender and juicy and the chicken was incredible. It's served with a cucumber, tomato, onion relish and a huge side of rice, and salad. Huge food for $10??? Count me in!! Comforting and delicious I will be back again!!"}
{"text":"Very nice home-style meal. The Somali way. I ordered Goat and rice and received a take out tray as the pictures on yelp are shown. Which is a relief. It is refreshing to get what you see on the picture. Large amount of food. Two days easily. Stewed vegetables were my favorite. Samosas or sambosas were delicious. Good experience. God Willing, I will go again!"}
{"text":"Super friendly, great atmosphere, food so filling and good, omg  And the tea is piping hot, sweet and perfectly spiced   Those veggie samosas, that fresh bread, mm."}
