{"text":"This place was absolutely delicious! I had the orange chicken an it was tender and flavorful. The staff was extremely attentive, polite, and very fast. Will definitely be coming back again"}
{"text":"I was quite fortunate to have discovered this nice little Thai restaurant near work! Their food is quite exceptional and beyond the many great eateries we r bless with in this great city of our. The thing I like most about this particular Thai restaurant is the in-house made curry and the friendly service from the staff! Eventhough I m not a really  big fan of spicy food! The curry has enough special herbs to balance out the flavor! I will definitely be back for my lunch break at this little desert flower!"}
{"text":"THEY DO NOT WASH THEIR HANDS!  UGH! - I will hunt my own food before I return to Sin City Thai.

While I was waiting for my take-out a man drove up on a blue scooter.  He parked and came inside.  Then he proceeded to assist the staff in preparing my food.  I had an unobstructed view as he simply walked into the kitchen and set to work on my food.  I walked over to another person at the counter and asked if he was going to wash his hands.  She spoke to him and he briefly ducked out of sight and came back wiping his hands on a paper towel.  This is unsafe and pretty disgusting.  I took my food when it was brought out but threw it away, no thanks."}
{"text":"Friendliest & nicest staff & the best tai food in town. Barbecue  chicken combo is my favorite along w/their Hibiscus lemonade! 
Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Sin City Thai was amazing! I had the pot stickers and iced thai tea . I could eat there again and again!!"}
{"text":"Yuck. Ordered zero stars and it's so spicy I can't eat it. They also forgot the coke I paid for. Came with a mushy piece of wanton. Gross. Never coming back."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch and it took nearly 2 hours. My salad had hair on it and the curry was too watery."}
{"text":"Great service & food was yummy!!
Good place to come with family.  
Our kids loved pad see u~~!!"}
{"text":"I am never going to go order from this place again. I paid for something and I never got it. I'm pissed they basically just took my money."}
{"text":"I ate here about a year ago and if i was reviewing, i would say definitely a 5 star plus restaurant....because their yellow curry chicken was very good....and then recently I tried something different - the Orange Chicken...and  I'm not sure it was chicken....  a co-worker ordered it also, and then got sick... never again...sorry Sin City...we like chicken in our chicken."}
{"text":"Simply put the customer service here is horrible. I ordered food came to pick it up and they had no record of my order then the cashier remembered she had wrote it down on the back of a random piece of paper. I was ok with her making a mistake until she said that even though I had ordered an 30 minutes ago and it was her mistake that they would not put my order in the front of the others. She said I would have to wait another 20min. I won't be back and will tell my friends and colleagues of my experiences here."}
{"text":"Holy crapola. 
This place is awesome. I ordered the red curry spicy #3 and woah. Heat factor!!! Definitely spicier than i had anticipated. The server told me it was very spicy and suggested i do a #2. I should have listened to her. Also tried the thai wings. And the tom kha soup. Definitely delicious and next time ill be ordering a lower spice level."}
{"text":"Ordered the Spicy Basil Shrimp and Chicken Satay on delivery.  The shrimp was set on a 4/5 heat scale, and it certainly came through on point, flavorful yet intense.  About 6 large shrimp in a deliciously spicy brine of basil and spice; the satay came on 4 skewers, about the amount you'd expect for an appetizer, and the perfect flavor -- not too salty. The spicy chili sauce was a perfect balance of heat and sweet.

Delivery came fast, and friendly.  Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for solid, quality Thai in LV."}
{"text":"Four of us visited Sin City last night for a take out whilst we are visiting Las Vegas.
The food was freshly prepared and the owner kept us up to date on what he was doing with the place as he had only been open for three weeks.
The owner is in the process of smartening the interior up and I'm sure with his high standards once this is achieved it will be worthy of 5*. 
We had chicken wings, soup, sweet and sour chicken, garlic chicken and teriyaki chicken.
All the food was excellent and we couldn't fault anything. 
If we lived in Las Vegas I'm certain this would be one of our go to spots for good food,whether it be eat in or take out"}
{"text":"Service was great, food was pretty good. 

Ordered the chicken salad with a spice level of 7 (I think). Wasn't bad, but not really an unforgettable experience. All iceberg lettuce with some veggies and chicken. Seemed a little too generic given the price. Dressing was good though."}
{"text":"First time I got food from here I ordered Chicken Fried rice and Crab ragoons. Rice was awesome. Ragoons were a little too sweet for my taste so I wasn't feeling them. Went back like a week later during my lunch time but this time I only had the fried rice it was just as awesome as the first time. Definitely recommend it. There's not many places in this area to eat if you work around here, this is a good place to consider. It's cheap and they only charge 2 bucks for delivery I believe. Portions are great too. Fried rice I ordered was enough to feed 2 of us."}
{"text":"Great foods and very friendly environment. And clean restaurant too. And they lunch special bery good too"}
{"text":"After hearing the other Thai place we use to go to closed down, we came across this one and it is our new favorite! The staff is so friendly, fast and makes amazing food. If you want spicy this is the place for you, but don't fret if you aren't a fan of spicy food, they will make it not spicy if requested. The sin city pot stickers are my favorite! I love to pair them with the mongolian beef and a Thai Tea! The place is a bit small so if you go for lunch get there before the rush or just call and go pick up your order either way you won't be disappointed by the food!"}
{"text":"Ordered a $12 Salmon teriyaki but they got my order wrong and gave me a $7 chicken lunch special.  I was back at the office before I caught the mistake. I tried to call to see if they would give me credit for the next time I came in but their phone line was down. The food was OK but  I wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"One of the best things about my workplace is that Sin City Thai is right around the corner. My lunch break has never been the same since discovering it. 

Sin City Thai puts other Thai restaurants to shame. They have hands down the best curry in Vegas that I've ever tried (especially the Panang!) and their other dishes are also excellent. I've been Thailand and the food here is as good or even better as anywhere else. 

It can get a little busy during the lunch rush, but that's just because the place is so awesome. 

Lin and his crew are awesome too! They always greet us and are super friendly. If you're looking for a good thai restaurant in Vegas, check this place out!"}
{"text":"Updated to give another star. Got the pad Thai chicken recently, and it was tasty. I think they have taken steps to improve the food here. Lunch specials are decently priced, so not a bad place to grab some quick Thai if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Never been to the restaurant, but hubby brought me home some Pad thai and papaya salad, and taste pretty good, I cook my own pad thai at home and im  very picky about my pad thai, so is my hubby. Next time im trying sumthing different. =)"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch during work.  The food was pretty good I suppose but I haven't yet been to a lot of Thai restaurants so I don't have many places to compare it to.  One thing that I have to note though is that the \"Yellow Curry w/ Chicken\" (lunch special) had a small strand of hair on the spoon which I had to send back.  But they quickly took it back and brought me a new bowl as soon as I mentioned it to them.  If it wasn't for my friends I probably would have just left, but I was being a team player."}
{"text":"I order delivery from here quite often to my office at work. The staff is always friendly over the phone, the food doesn't take to long to get to me, and the delivery driver is always super friendly. I feel the prices are reasonable as well. 

I always get chicken pad thai with a side of white rice. I am not disappointed by it, it certainly kills my pad thai cravings, but its not my absolute favorite pad thai. Their excellent customer service here (that I have experienced anyway) certainly makes up for that. And for that reason, is why I keep going back.

See you soon Sin City Thai Restaurant!"}
{"text":"Finally, a place that actually listens to how   spicy you would like it and actually does it!  The spicy basil with fried tofu was just perfect!  
We will be back!"}
{"text":"First time trying this place today. Placed a to-go lunch special order of spicy mint chicken. I feel jipped..! The order of spicy mint chicken was soooo small! I didn't get full whatsoever. An eggroll, wonton crisp, and steamed rice also came with the lunch special, but it still wasn't enough. The price wasn't bad.. $6.75. But I was soooo disappointed in the portion size. 

I won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying the service here is absolutely horrible! Stopped in for a weekday lunch & took over an hour & a half to get chicken pad thai from their lunch menu ($6.95) as well as an order of pot stickers. The restaurant was busy when my co-worker & I arrived which I thought was a good sign - meaning good place to eat. However I should have realized immediately that only 1 table actually had their food. Took over 10 minutes just to get our drinks (water). And they screwed that up. My dining partner had actually ordered iced tea. Watched as the cooks in the back took food (some type of ribs) out of the microwave while we were waiting for our food. Was glad that I hadn't gotten that. Saw a couple of tables that sat down after us & that ordered after us getting their food before we did which is upsetting that the waitress couldn't figure out who should get served first. I realize we did order an appetizer but we also ordered a lunch special in which we should have received our soup prior to our meal. Once we finally received our food was sadly disappointed. Pot stickers were frozen from a box type. Could tell as there was freezer burn on them. As far as chicken pad thai there was quite a bit of chicken actually in the dish which I was surprised to see. I like to order a spiciness of 1 so that way I can make my own spiciness. Well apparently the chef thought I asked for a 3 or something because it was spicy. My dining partner ordered a 0 & his was spicy. How does a 0 warrant any spice? Had to ask several times to get our bill. I only get an hour for lunch & this place was a sad disappointment taking over an hour & a half to take our order, get our food, eat, bill, etc. They need to learn how to speed things up as I know there were many 9-5 workers in there that day & I am sure they all only got an hour as well. While waiting for our food watched several people come in & place take out orders & they ended up waiting 25-30 minutes to get their food. There was absolutely no pep in either waitresses step. They both seemed like they didn't care how long it took them to get your items out to you. Would rather go to Archies Thai & spend a little more on their lunch special & know that I am going to be able to be back to work in my allotted time frame. I wouldn't waste my time coming back to this place even if it is cheap. I guess what they say is you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Sin City Thai restaurant is my new go-to spot for Thai food. I used to always go to Archi's Thai restaurant, but I've gotten bored of the flavors there. Today, I ordered my favorite beef salad with a spicy level of 2/5. I also ordered pad se ew with shrimp. The food is very flavorful & the staff is very friendly. The prices aren't bad either. If you're looking to try a new Thai place, I recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"So my office eats here quite often because its pretty close and we only have 30mins. Never had issues before but this past time was just terrible. 
Ordered 2 lunch specials, 1 reg chicken entree, order of egg rolls and 1 sticky rice. 
Got there to pick up and wanted to add on an extra sticky rice but they said they were out. OK.. no big deal. Got back to the office and realized I didn't even get my 1 order of sticky rice one of the lunch specials had onions (requested to leave them out) and only 2 packets of soy sauce.
Called and told them we'd come back for a new order w/out onions. The office assistant went back and got the new order, asked for extra soy sauce and asked for the sticky rice we didn't get. The bigger guy said he put it in the bag himself so he knows we got it. 
She got back to the office w/the new order.. it was sooooo spicy, maybe I was being punished for complaining they got my order wrong. They gave 2 more packets of soy sauce (like really?). And when she told me about the man telling her about the sticky rice I was so annoyed I called..
Talked to him and after arguing for 5 mins he said \"now that I think about it I might have given it to someone else.. We got really busy.\" 
Why would I lie about a $2 side of sticky rice, come on?! Very rude. Service was horrible. And food was just OK."}
{"text":"The thai tea is very watery.  The wontons were very crispy and some were delicious while others were burned.The chicken was very dry. The fried rice was good. There was no one there so we were the only ones being waited on. It just tasted like something from a microwave."}
{"text":"This was my go to lunch stop. Came here for the authentic taste and friendly service. Sadly, most recipes have changed since new ownership and that authentic taste isn't there anymore. Super bummed. I advice for new owners to reconsider using recipes old owners left behind for their use."}
{"text":"Service was genuine. Food was overall good. The curries were okay. The only challenge was that a small black bug was found in the pad Thai. Eating ceased immediately and they were very apologetic for the issue. I am sure an isolated incident."}
{"text":"Recent studies have shown that curries can actually be effective in lowering blood pressure, and sometimes by lunch after a frustrating morning at the office I am certain I could use this.  While this may be true, it also true that I never need an excuse to eat Thai.  So my go-to workday Thai lunch spot is the nearby Sin City Thai.

In addition to any benefits of lower blood pressure, Sin City Thai will clear up any sinus problems.  Their food is HOT and they will let you know that when you order.  I wouldn't be surpised if their mild 3 is hotter than some places spiciest 5.  I don't mind the heat and occassionally I enjoy the tongue blistering heat.  If that is how you like it, this is the place for you.

Besides the heat, the curries are fairly straight forward with onions, carrots, and potatos.  The meats are thinly sliced which allows the sauce to mix in throughout the meat and gives a powerful flavor.  It includes a spring roll and wonton that along with the sweet dipping sauce provides a nice contrast to the heat of the main dish.  When dining in, the meal also includes a bowl of soup.

Their lunch specials are very reasonably priced ($6.95) and for about the price of a McDonald's value meal you can get a real meal.  Between the good food, the lunch specials, and the close proximity to many offices, it is quite popular during the week and can be very busy at the noon hour.  The dining room has only a few talbes so I would recommend calling ahead for carry out if you are pressed for time."}
{"text":"I ordered through UberEATS.  I ordered pad Thai; Part of the order process was to ask how spicy you wanted the food.  It was a multiple choice, I picked medium, there were two options above that.  The food was so spicy we threw it out, it was atomic.  I like spicy food, but this was over the top lips burning, fire hot.  Why ask what I want if your going to do something different?"}
{"text":"Wish my red curry was thicker...

This place offers really cheap lunch specials and with that said the portions are on the small side and don't always leave you satisfied when it comes to the tastes. 

My old office was located very close to this place so it was convenient more than anything. I'd get the mixed veggies with chicken lunch special and enjoyed that the most from the menu. The red curry is really watery and wish it had more coconut milk. The Thai teas tend to be on the very sweet side here so I started to skip them. Overall it was mostly about convenience but I wouldn't find myself here again. There are so many great Thai places in town that also offer great lunch values and richer flavors."}
{"text":"I love this place the food taste good authentic Thai and the price is very reasonable! Plus, they wear glove when they cook and the the service is very friendly. I would recommend to try curry and pad Thai."}
{"text":"Edit: I had to drop one star.  Their consistency has gone down.  Their curries used to be sooooo good but the last time I got it it was soupy and liquidy. Not like their normal items at all.  Same with their Pad Thai. Disappointed.  :-(  



I am picky when it comes to Thai food and this place was surprisingly good.  The pricing was cheaper then archi's and the decor was definitely not there but the green curry was great.  The pad kee mow was a little disappointing but the owner told me that it was not gonna be the same since they had run out of the large flat noodles. And i agree it was not the same but it was still decent.  The Thai tea was ok...I still think archi's is better... but I saw the thai coffee as I was leaving and it looked good.

I will definitely be going back to try the other dishes I have not tried and a another huge plus... they deliver!"}
{"text":"Great lunch special. Clean and fast. I got a pad Thai much that came with a egg roll, soup and a wonton. Add a soda and it came out to $10 bucks. I'm happy

The pad Thai was good. The beef was soft and the flavor was good. I watched them make it which is always a bonus. 

I will add this place to the lunch spot list."}
{"text":"We went there on a coin toss, and boy am I happy we did! I ordered the Yellow Curry and my boyfriend ordered the Pad Thai. She asked us how spicy on a scale of 1-5 how spicy we wanted our food and they were spot on. The Yellow Curry was delicious I loved the addition of coconut milk. The Pad Thai was excellent as well. The food is super healthy. The prices are very low, and the service was awesome. Check this place out for sure!"}
{"text":"This place was one of the few thai places open at 10:30AM (my stomach thought it was lunch time). I called in and the girl was quick to take and repeat my order:

1. beef salad - surprising amount of beef! but needs more lettuce and juice/sauce. i love any beef salad, this was middle of the road good flavor wise. the beef on it though was better than average because it was cooked well, wasn't chewy, and there was a ton of it.
2. beef pad see ew - not bad, not great, just averagely good.  i wish there was more broccoli in it. 
3. green curry - i debated between yellow and green and the waitress said \"our yellow curry is more popular but i like the green curry flavor more\". so i went with the green curry with chicken. it comes with white rice, and is the greenest green curry I've ever seen. almost a lime green. the color threw me off but the curry itself was good. Good consistency, packed with veggies and thin (maybe too thin) slices of chicken. I told them \"mild spicy\" and it was on the tame side. i'll try this again next time but with \"medium spicy\"

10% off if you pay cash! (which I didn't have) .... my total came out to $30.11"}
{"text":"Went here yesterday , customer service was. It the best lady was rude but the food was very good and price was reasonable . What we ordered was very delicious and made quickly. I would have given 5 stars but the service was a bit upsetting . Overall the food is worth it ."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times and some things are better than others. The Tom kha soup is good. I've had it with chicken and shrimp, but I prefer the latter. I also liked the chicken curry which comes with potatoes, carrots and too many onions, but the pad thai was probably the worst I've ever had. I dont know if maybe because I ordered it with little spice or what, but it was so bland. Their food is super spicy too, on a scale of 1-5 I ordered a 1 and my nose was running. 

The lunch special $7.95 and there are about 8 options to choose from. You also get a cup of bland rice soup, an eggroll and a fried wonton. Since this place is close to my work, I'll probably come back when I'm in the mood for soup. But I'll likely make the drive a little further for more flavorful food."}
{"text":"This is a very nice family run place immediately next to the much beloved Phat Phrank's.  The restaurant is small with maybe seating for about 20 but comfortable and inviting.  In particular we really enjoyed the soft shell crab salad and the Tom Kha Gai (chicken and coconut milk soup).  Generally, a thing to watch out for here is that their idea of spiciness is set a little higher than most places.  So, if you normally like your Thai food a 4 out of 5 for spiciness, you should start with a 3 out of 5 here. (Or maybe even a 2, if you want to be cautious.)  In terms of prices, I was  pleasantly surprised.  My impression is that the Sin City Thai prices run about 15% lower than those of competing Thai restaurants.  One more cool thing about this place is that if you're dining out with friends and maybe one part of the group wants Thai and another would prefer Mexican, both Sin City Thai and Phat Phrank's are totally cool with you getting food from both places and eating in either.  (They're not related businesses, they're just both very up with customer service about things.)"}
{"text":"This is one of my go-to's for lunch. I'm kind of monomaniac there and always have the lunch special pad-thai. The lady keeps getting mad at me (in a very nice way), telling me I should try their other specialties, but... I love pad-thai.
Perfectly sized (and priced) for a quick lunch, at $7.45 or something like this, with an egg roll.
Very small joint, but super friendly and always busy! Which is a good sign to me :)"}
{"text":"Normally this is a place to go during lunchtime because it's close enough to my wife's work. Today we went and literally sat there for a long time and still weren't greeted or asked if we wanted any drinks. Wow horrible, so we left. The other times we were served quickly. Now this just gave me bad vibes about this place and do not want to go."}
{"text":"I ordered their pad thai and rad nah, and a side drink of their Thai hibiscus tea. I did a take out and it was fast and food was good. It close to where i live and i will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Excellent beef salad!! Ordered level 3 for Tom Yum and was very spicy. Too spicy for me, but great flavor otherwise."}
{"text":"I ordered from Sin City Thai restaurant through UberEATS and the Uber driver forgot to bring my Thai tea. I was promised that she'd come back to pick it up and drop it to me but she never did. I called Sin City Thai restaurant and not only was the staff so kind and helpful on the phone but a gentlemen named Lin drove all the way to my apartment and delivered me my drink and gave me an extra one. This made a crappy situation turn into a pleasant one and all the food I ordered was delicious. I will definitely be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"The food is great, and I love coming here, but I've been sitting here my whole lunch hour, and haven't gotten my food yet. I usually don't mind, but they just told me 17 more minutes. I love the food, but they just cannot keep up with the rush. They are more worried about to go orders than people sitting at their tables."}
{"text":"So always thought about checking out Sin City Thai Restaurant. I have my normal Thai spots. Friend was mentioning about the lunch specials that he comes here often with co workers. He like it solid good Thai food. I was like why not plus always helps keep reviews up checking out new places. lol. Anyway stopped by for lunch it eventually got crowded by 12am so early lunch be ideal. It small restaurant not lot of seats. 

The lunch specials they have nice selection that can choose from for your entree. Some Thai places there lunch specials might not have as many choose from but here it nice list. One that for sure will be back to try more of the list. I decided to start the list with Kung Pao. I was going with Orange Chicken but server warning me that not your typical orange chicken just in case thinking Panda style. I appreciated the fact that she mentioned to me that the restaurant style is more true Thai style dishes. The Kung Pao it really did have different taste then normally associate with Kung Pao. If there one distinct thing that STANDS out. The HEAT on the dishes are insane. Start you need to know that the heat scale goes from 1-4. Not your norm like most other Thai places might go 1-10. Other need to know VERY important no joke talking about the heat. They warn you and she even double warns you if think high and mighty can handle the burn. I had the 2. I never had 2 that HOT. It was good kind of heat. The portion size is decent, all lunch specials comes with choice of soup, rice, and egg roll. Best part is under $10 for any lunch special. Get your choice of protein just if want Shrimp dollar extra. 

The service can be slow only because only one waitress for the whole restaurant. The interior decor is nice. Don't forget to check out the chalkboard with the daily specials or non menu items. The staff is awesome. It was my first time. She did awesome job explaining to me the heat scale works and made a great recommendation change my order from Orange Chicken to Kung Pao. 

No doubt plan on coming back again...till the next lunch special!!!"}
{"text":"Ohmygosh! I had completely forgot how much I loved Thai food since this brain injury. The infection had caused my sense of taste to disappear and the brain damage makes me forget EVERYTHING! I think there was one day when I first was released that we ordered delivery from one other Thai place but I couldn't taste anything. TODAY WAS AN EXPLOSION OF FLAVOR! I ordered yellow curry chicken and my wife did some sweet and sour something or other. My mouth is still smiling :) Not only was it fantastic because of time away from the flavors period, this particular version was put together VERY WELL! My wife was very happy with her meal, I apologize for the lack of pictures but we will return and ill update at that time. If you're in the neighborhood I can highly recommend based on our meal this morning! :) Thank you!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and it was packed. Usually a good thing. They have a nice looking lunch menu for $6.95 which includes an egg roll, won ton, soup, rice, and choice of curry, pad thai, beef broccoli, and few more. Warning they use a 5 levels heat scale for their curries just incase you order a 5 thinking its medium, most places I've been to use 10 levels. Customer service was great. The interior was nice and clean. Sounds like I should be having a good experience. 

Unfortunately when it came to the food, the one and only time I think I'll ever be here, it was pretty bad. Yea I ate the whole meal but it was a struggle and I was hungry. I went with the yellow curry with chicken from the lunch menu. It was pretty runny to what I usually  have at other places. The chicken seemed over cooked and some of the veggies were partially raw. The flavor wasn't as strong also. After the first couple spoons I was like I don't want anymore. Started to add rice maybe I would get better nope. Anyways I ate it all feeling very unsatisfied. Would I be back? Maybe, I should really give them another chance but not rushing it."}
{"text":"For the last 20 minutes, my nose has been running, and my lips have been on fire. Sin City Thai brings the HEAT!  Finally, I found a Thai restaurant that understands how to infuse spice into a dish without compromising the other ingredients.  

They offer plenty of lunch specials for $6.95, but I was craving spicy chicken with basil for lunch. I ordered Level 3 (out of 5) and instantly knew I was in for a challenge. I like Hot food, but not to the extent where my mouth goes numb and I start crying. The food smelled so spicy and delicious, I couldn't wait to get back to work and eat it. After giving it some thought, I decided to sneak a bite at the first stop light to see how spicy this food really was. Then it hit me--WOW! Not only was this dish hotter than Jennifer Lawrence, it was really good. 

The chicken was cooked perfectly (sliced not ground) and was mixed with white onions, basil, red, and green peppers. However, what I liked most was the fantastic sauce this food was swimming in. I tossed my steamed rice up in there to soak up every last delicious drop. 

The place is casual, and the gentleman who took my order was really nice. My food was ready in 10 minutes which made me nervous. I didn't think you could put a dish together that quickly that packed so many flavors. I really like it here. Next time, I will bring my wife so she can try something else and I could sample it. I know what I am getting! Why mess with perfection?

Challenge accepted Sin City!  I laugh in the face of your level 3. Just kidding-don't hurt me. Level 3 is just fine!"}
{"text":"The food here is great. Services awesome . I brought in the whole family we all had a great time .thank you Sin City Thai restaurant!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite thai restaurant in Las Vegas. 

The people there alway welcome you with a smile. 
Their food is always bold in flavor, alway spot on with spice levels and well portioned. My favorite  orders are pad see ew, thom tum/ka, panang curry and laab. 

Try this place out. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The quality of the food is five stars. But, the reason I am giving this Thai Restaurant 5 stars is that they made my food spicy. I like to feel the burn when I ask for it and my mouth is watering a sensation I rarely get. There heat level is accurate and beautiful."}
{"text":"Great service! Best Thai iced tea I've ever had."}
{"text":"Second time here and the food is still delish. I tried their Thai beef salad today along with my usual chicken pad see ew and it hit the spot again."}
{"text":"I was just passing by and saw the sign. Stopped in on my lunch break. It was sooo good! I had Chicken Tom Kha soup and Yellow Curry chicken. I asked for mild because I don't like much spice. It was perfect. Hot enough to make me sweat but not too hot to eat. I will definitely be coming back for more lunch breaks!"}
{"text":"They sure know how to heat up their dishes. They are seriously HOT! Unfortunately my beef was a little overcooked and tough and I would have happily given more stars. Given what I paid I'm not too upset though."}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this place. I can't think of one time I've gone and have been disappointed!! The food is so good! I strongly recommend the wings, they are hands down the best wings I've ever eaten in my life! They have great curries and the pad see ewe is the best I've had anywhere. Be careful with their spice levels cause they are not the normal spice level...Way more spicy...I go for 3 most of the time which is their high medium and it's spicy for me, and I love and can handle spicy. I try taking everyone I know here that likes Thai because this will easily become the best Thai restaurant they've ever been to!"}
{"text":"I am crazy for Thai food so me and my boyfriend decided to give this place a try. We had Chicken Tom Kha (level 3), Chicken Spicy Basil ( level 2), and Pad Thai (level 1) just to try how their spicy levels are since I usually do level 10 at archi's and krung siam. I LOVED the Tom kha, the perfect amount of spicyness with still a great amount of flavor. However if you're not into that spicy, it might be too much for you. The spicy basil was really tasty as well. However the pad thai wasn't my favorite since I like it to be a little sweeter. Oh and we also had the Thai tea, a little too sweet like candy but still okay. Overall I was really happy with the Tom Kha and Spicy Basil, I will definitely be back!! :)"}
{"text":"I'm from SGV, CA, so I'm familiar with most ethnic food. This place was unlike any I've had before. I ordered Pad Thai and it was interesting because they added cabbage to it. I like the healthy twist, and there was a perfect amount of spice added. I was debating if I wanted it more spicy, but the host recommended I had the extra spice on the side as it could get a bit too spicy. Great recommendation. Although they don't have happy hour any more (boooo!!! :( ) the food was reasonably priced and super delicious! And the staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"I like the lunch specials.. 6.99 for a quick thai fix. At least around these parts.
The entrees were a good portion and the bbq combo is a great choice for a high protein lunch. Our waiter was talkative and fun but the only down side was the wait for service. Lunch here can be pretty  busy and they could use some extra staff on the floor to maybe accommodate those of us on a tight schedule. Other than that.. I would recommend this place as a low key utility thai food spot that has pretty good food for a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"Awesome Authentic Thai Food in Vegas. We Woke up from A Hard night of Partying and We wanted to eat thai food. 1)Went on Yelp, 2)searched Thai Food, 3) Gave us a Few List of thai restaurants in the area ( We've Been to at least 5 other) 4) picked out a new restaurant   6) drove.
If your coming from the strip you have to make a 10 min drive, but def worth it.
App: the thai jalapeno popper, and chicken wings were awesome
entree: pad seu  spcy basil pork and there green curry DElicous
Definitely coming here everytime we come out to vegas.
A Real Thai Flavor in Sin City."}
{"text":"There are the business owners that take to Yelp to combat bad reviews with canned responses, and there are those like Sin City Thai that read the reviews and fix what needed to be fixed with hard action. 

I have been here many, many times since my initial visit and the service & quality here doesn't stop improving. They know what it takes to get it right, and they apply it! 

Well done, Sin City. You've earned this one."}
{"text":"Food is delicious but they forgot my second order of chicken satay, didn't get acknowledged for 5 minutes (not a single customer in the restaurant) and when I finally did get service, the man smelled of cigarettes."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT service. There was a young girl working up front. She greeted us, took care of us, made us feel welcome and brought us everything we wanted while going above and beyond. She also had an actual conversation with us and was genuinely interested in how we felt about the food and if we had ate there before. It's so hard to feel like you've received great service anywhere lately at least in our experience. The food was also really good. I got the pad keep Mao spice level 1 and it still had some spice to it! My husband got the yellow curry spice level 3 which he said was really good but pretty hot and couldn't imagine above a 3. We also ordered some potstickers for our toddler."}
{"text":"Highly recommended! I was vacationing in Vegas when I happened to drive by. I ordered the chicken lab and shrimp soup, can't remember the name. Oh my! The flavors were amazing, not too salty like some thai restaurants can be. The staff was very friendly and helpful. They don't sell beer but they told me I was welcome to buy one next door and drink it in their restaurant. I will definitely be back next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"This is a great place for lunch specials and their green curry is packed with lots of flavors and spice. Do check out their generous lunch special menu ($6.75!) if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Great authentic Thai food. Vegetarian friendly with vegetarian oyster sauce as well as other options. The owners are so nice and accommodating to special food requests. There are many Thai restaurants but this one is more clean than the average restaurant. I've seen the chef wearing gloves when food prepping, and the fryer and vents cleaned monthly. Prices are good too."}
{"text":"Tried this place with a friend last week. He ordered the Pad See Eew and said it was ok but nothing that topped the charts. I ordered the Tom Yum soup spice #5. Could have been much spicier. It was alright but lacking a bit in the fresh factor and could have used more lemon grass as the shrooms dominated the soup. Nothing that I would rave about. It is around the corner from work and the service was decent. Could have been a lot worse for that area which seems to attract mediocrity in the lunch department. 

Have said this before and it may be to cater for those who are clueless in the Thai department, but so many of these places add American Chinese items to the menu which is baffling. Good on them if it captures a lost market but it causes me to question the quality of the majority of food on offer. 

Try if you're in the area but otherwise, Chinatown it is. I'll try again in a pinch."}
{"text":"Thank you for listening it's back on top curry has been great every time!!


This used to be my favorite place for yellow curry. Now that it has changed owners it's not as good. I was eating here like 3 times a week please go back to the old recipes the new ones do not compare!"}
{"text":"Happen to find this spot driving by and wanted Thai iced tea...ended up ordering potstickers and red curry. Absolutely delicious!!!! We compared it to Pin Kaow since it's our favorite Thai place... just as good but the prices are excellent here. Customer service was great as well!!! Friendly with recommendations as well."}
{"text":"Great spot off the usual food corridor but worth the trip. We ordered the spicy potstickers and pork basil both were great. I will come here again."}
{"text":"This joint is just around the corner from work... So, I literally only have an hour when I get around to giving it another go.  

That said, I love me some Thai food and can dutifully handle spice ( I'm from Buffalo, kids) but the heat on this Pad Thai was off the wall and ruined the dish. They go from one to five, I ordered a three.  

The next time I found myself parked in their tiny, but lovely dining room I elected to reel it back and stay at one. While it was much cooler, the flavor still packed a punch. I must be getting wimpy. 

Fresh ingredients and sluggish service makes me want to go check this spot out on the weekends to adventure further into their menu."}
{"text":"Every time that I come here I stay amazed. A small family business that's always busy but still delivers great food and a big smile to open your appetite . The ladies are very sweet and she made sure that their spicy level is SPICYY cz my 2 was flaming hot. Try the sweet and spicy chicken dumplings. NO PORK ADDED !!! I am in love with this place. Also if you stay for lunch special which is 10:30am to 2:30pm (isn't that cool!!) then you get this amazing chicken soup complimentary !!! Highly recommend it"}
{"text":"I work up the street from Sin City Thai, so when it opened up I was excited to have another potential lunch spot. I finally got around to trying them for lunch on Valentine's Day with the lovely Jaime W. as my dining date. 

We started out with delicious hibiscus lemonades. Very refreshing, definitely something I would try again. We also shared a chicken satay appetizer. It was good, but not great.

For my meal, I went with the Mixed Vegetable lunch special which is a good deal at $6.95. The menu does not give a description of the dish, I assumed I would get an assortment of veggies like corn, mushrooms and broccoli. Instead I got onions and peppers in assorted colors. I was rather disappointed by this. 

I decided to go back and get some takeout before posting a review. This time I went with the Orange Chicken lunch special. I did not call in my order, but they still had me on my way in about 15 minutes. I liked this dish better then the Mixed Vegetable dish, but it still didn't blow me away and I doubt I'd order it again. 

Service each time was efficient and friendly, and since I work really close I will probably go back at some point to try the Pad Thai. Hopefully after that I can update and add another star but until then, Sin City Thai is just alright to me, nothing special."}
{"text":"This is by far most delicious Thai food I have tasted in Las Vegas. The server was amazing and very attentive. Whenever I am in vegas I will try my best to come and eat here. Seating is comfortable, resturant is clean, food is tasty, prices are low and service and attitude is friendly. Thank you."}
{"text":"We actually tried to go to Berlin Cafe but it is closed on Saturday for lunch. Since I was hangry, i just needed to eat and this was next door. 

The space reminds me of a diner with seating and an open kitchen. The seating area was decorated minimally with some wall decor and small fake floral pieces on the table. 

The server was friendly and nice. A little young and needs to learn the service process more, as our table did not have enough silverware and she never came back to check on us

We ordered: 
Silver Noodle Salad -  this was a 3 out of 5 in spice level and out was out of control hot for a \"medium\".  In terms of flavor, I couldn't taste it because my mouth was burning. 

Mongolian Chicken - not Chinese style but good flavors

Pad See Eww - it was ok, nothing special. 

I would not come back."}
{"text":"Spicy 0-5... Items with a pepper symbol... 1.. I think. I ordered level 2 and could've lived with a 1 or a zero... Good food. Tasty. 6.95 lunch special."}
{"text":"INCREDIBLE THAI FOOD!!! I totally found the place by accident when stopping for gas. I decided to pop in for some Thai food (I'm 1/2 Thai) and I was blown away at how good the food was. The staff is awesome! Real Thai people cooking and working there. They have TV with amazing videos of Thailand. 
They have THE best potstickers in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Yay!!! A thai restaurant thats closer to my work.

This place used to be Sin CIty Burgers, but that didnt last too long.  Its totally different owners, but they kept Sin City in the business name.  The restaurant opened about 1 1/2 weeks ago.  Been there twice last week and planning on going there tonight for lunch break..haha.  So far I got to try the Panang Curry ($7.95), and the lunch special Pad Thai ($6.95).  Both were pretty good, tasty and just enough heat for what I asked.  The chef stated her spicy level is higher than most restaurants.  I can't wait to try their other dishes. My mouth is watering and waiting for break time."}
{"text":"Fast delivery to my hotel and the delivery guy was polite. I ordered the spring rolls and they were Judy ok. The pot stickers were very good. The Red Curry with chicken was decent. I ordered it on a scale of 1-5 in spiciness a 3....it was nice and spicy. Prices were fair."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Thai restaurants in the neighborhood !!! The food is always fresh and delicious , it's fast and cheap ! Definitely the spot for you if you like spicy Thai  food with a home cooked vibe ! My favorites are Yellow curry and a Silver noodle salad ;)"}
{"text":"I was on my lunch,  and decided to give this place a go,  since I was really craving some Thai food and it was the only location close by.  
The restraunt it's self is pretty small,  only about 8 tables.   When I arrived in was still kinda crowded from the lunch rush,  and none of the tables looked bused yet.  The gentlemen in the front serving noticed me right away and cleaned off a table promptly.  
I ordered a plate of pad kea mow,  which is my favorite Thai dish.  I got my food quickly in less than ten minutes.  One thing I thought was strange was how the noodles used were not fat wide noodles that I usually see in the dish.  Instead they were similar to fettuccine noodles.  When asking how spicy I would like,  the waitress asked between one and five stars.  Now,  I'm used to them asking me in between one and ten,  so it took me a second to decide on my desired spiciness.  
I went ahead and went with a two.  
The dish it's self was still pretty spicy, and it was lacking some of the essential flavors I was looking for.  
All and all,  it was a nice cheap and quick place for me to spend my lunch,  and I will probably be coming here again."}
{"text":"First time trying this place,
1. Dr pepper tasted like root beer-they say it's not
2. No soup with the special 
3. Kung pao chicken bland - asked for mild (3) but it was more like 7
4. Wonton was basically a chip

Overall the food was less than average and the service about the same"}
{"text":"Green curry and pad Thai were both fantastic. The flavors were full and well layered. 
Not much for ambiance, but the flavors more Tha. Make up for it!"}
{"text":"Food was decent and serving size was great it's a lot like most other small Thai restaurants good for take out and food in a pinch. I was the only person sitting down and they served me and were polite in all regards. Some of the employees were eating their lunch at one of the other tables and would grab water or offer me other items as the need arose, so that made it more of an enjoyable experience overall. My only real complaint was that the pot stickers were not flavorful at all."}
{"text":"... i dont know why the hate on this place...     I gotta tell ya the yellow curry was bomb ...im very well pleased to say !! curry could be cooked down a tad   bit longer ... but for the most part it was defently not lacking any flavor at all!! im defently comming back for my curry fix ... i really like this place ... :] glad i found it"}
{"text":"Don't let the cliche name fool you, the Thai food here is authentic and delicious.

Great lunch special or for takeout. The dining room is a bit small but very comfortable.

Excellent service, very clean restaurant, great spice and flavors!

Kung Pao tofu is my go"}
{"text":"Love this place!! I work down the street & come here about 8 times of month. Their curries are the best & the  Teriyaki Salmon is at the top of my food list! The customer service is amazing and the restaurant's cleanliness is immaculate.

Sin City Thai has a customer forever"}
{"text":"So I didn't feel like cooking and decided to order Thai food for me and my gf and stumbled upon this place through the Yelp app. 

We ordered Pad Thai (hot) Chow Mein (medium) and a Spicy Chicken of some sort. 

The reason for 1* was that the range of spicy was INSANE. The Pad Thai was so spicy I couldn't eat anymore. I lost my appetite because the spicy wasn't spicy it was like I was eating medicine. The Chow Mein was barely manageable and the chicken smelt like it was pure peppers. 

We usually eat spicy food on the regular but this was disgusting. Waste of $35... If you order here DONT get anything spicy they clearly don't know how to cook spicy food."}
{"text":"We order the pad kea mow spicy level 3, papaya salad spicy level 3 and a side of sticky rice. Every thing taste good and spicy!!"}
{"text":"This review is long overdue.  I ordered chicken bbq combo but was given pork ribs bbq combo.  I told the waitress, and got blamed for not ordering correctly.  Lost my appetite because of the attitude and everything I tasted us overly sweet.  Not recommending this placem."}
{"text":"Hot hot hot!!!! The owner warned me three times if 4/5 heat was really what I wanted. This place properly heats their food in my opinion. Best part, I enjoyed the flavor and the ingredients looked fresh."}
{"text":"I usually order Lunch here, as it's close to where I work and their lunch specials are GREAT!

The dishes I order most are:

Pad Thai Lunch Special (Chicken, sometimes shrimp)
3 out of 5 spicy

Yellow Curry Lunch Special
3 out of 5 spicy

Pot Stickers

Everything is great and for lunch, you can't beat the price (lunch specials are $6.95 and include all the fixings except a drink). In terms of how good the food is, it's better Pad Thai than I've ordered anywhere else in Las Vegas, and at that price, I would not go anywhere else. Their curry is good, not the best I've ever had, but again, I can't beat that price.

If you're looking for a quick Thai fix, I would highly recommend this spot. Good prices and good food."}
{"text":"Last year my wife and I went here to eat after going to the Immigration Office a block away and at that time I didn't write a review right away after dining at this restaurant thinking they would fix the restaurant but today I saw this restaurant on Darcy Spears's \"Dirty Dining\" and I wanted to voice out our experience that I've been meaning to do after dining with this place. Anyway, the place had old chairs and tables and there was a lot of flies in the restaurant. When I received my food, it had a strand of hair! The lime that they gave me was also old and looks dried up! As soon as I saw the hair, I didn't finish eating and we left... The price is cheap but normally YOU GET WHAT YOU PAID FOR!!!

Lesson learned, next time when you go in a restaurant and when you see something unsanitary, just leave!!! LEAVE!!! And find a better cleaner restaurant..."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is fabulous. I am completely addicted and the service is the friendliest in Vegas. In a town where finding good customer service is almost impossible it is refreshing to actually get service as good as the food!"}
{"text":"\"I came here on New Years 2014 week to visit my relatives & this was the first stop I made...\"

FOOD: Best BBQ RIBS I've ever had in my life! The flavors were smoky & mesquite; it was just perfect!

SERVICE: Extremely friendly with beautiful and welcoming smiles!

SPICE LEVEL: Now I am Thai-American and I can handle about 6-8 Thai chillis so order what you can handle, ONCE AGAIN ORDER WHAT YOU CAN HANDLE!

THE EXPERIENCE: was very satisfying, no complaints from me, I'm not a very picky eater so if you are a picky eater then, please read some of the other picky comments, thanks ;)

I will definitely be BACK, BACK, BACK!"}
{"text":"We came here on a Monday night, 30min to closing, and ordered
1. Chicken Tom Yum Soup, 8.95
2. Panang Curry - Beef, 8.95
3. Pad Thai - Chicken, 8.95
4. Mixed Vegetables - Fried tofu, 8.95
5. Extra bowl of rice, $1. 
for $39.18 (10% off if you pay with cash). We paid cash. 

- Looks like a fast food joint. Threw us off since it's a Thai restaurant next to a Gas station and Popeyes. Lowers the standard. 
- Tom Yum: Great Taste! Spicy. Hot. Loved it. Must get!
- Beef panang: Too much peanut butter. Beef lacked tenderness. Worst panang I've ever eaten. And I've eaten a lot of Panang. 
- Spicy Basil with tofu: Not enough tofu and too much onions 
- Pad Thai: was too chewy. noodles were too soft. 
- Service was friendly, but demeanor seemed like they wanted us out. 
- Sloppy-tasting Thai food. Although, A nice place for Thai-Newbs that enjoy eating frozen Thai entrees from Trader Joe's. Or a good Lunch stop for the 9-5 worker looking to get out from a monotonous grind from McDonald's during their break. This is not a family-affair kinda restaurant."}
{"text":"Order to go from here today. Ordered the orange chicken & spicy basil lunch specials. The orange chicken tasted like fruit loops, not a totally bad thing but I never thought a Thai dish would remind me of my favorite childhood cereal. I ordered the spicy basil at a level 4 spicy (1-5) holy sh*t was that spicy as f*ck. my mouth finally stopped burning almost an hour later. Call me crazy, but I enjoyed the pain. Will def eat there again & next time try one of their curries..."}
{"text":"Ordered from here 7-24-14. I work right around the corner, and found out they deliver to our place of business. Most places will not for some stupid reason. 

You have to order online through yelp, not a deal breaker, but it's like they did not read the instructions given. I asked for no Onions (I'm allergic)  and the Pad Thai had Onions. Since there is a $15 minimum to order online, I ordered the chicken satay. So I was able to eat that."}
{"text":"This guys are ridiculously slow. EVERY TIME I order online and send someone down to pick it up it takes an hour. They NEVER get the order right. I order 2 items and they make one. How difficult is it to read the order correct and make the right amount of plates? This isn't the first time this has happened it happens EVERY SINGLE TIME!

So what do you think happens? One plate is hot, and the other is cold because its been sitting around for 20 minutes. I've given these people way too many chances, I'll NEVER set foot in that place again. 

I dont recommend anyone go here if they value their time. 
STAY AWAY FROM SIN CITY THAI
and go to a place that gets your order right.

EAT24 please remove these people from your ordering system."}
{"text":"Great local Thai restaurant. I like spicy food and #4 spicy was perfect. The Penang curry was excellent. The Shrimp Tom Yum was also very good. Our waitress was also very helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"I was excited to see a Thai restaurant in the area where I work.  After reading the reviews here on Yelp, I decided to give it a try.  I called in my order and the girl who answered said it would be ready in 15 minutes.  I arrived in 15 minutes and was greeted upon walking in and my order was hot and ready at the counter.  I ordered the basil chicken lunch with a spice level of 3.  It was absolutely delicious.  As I was eating, beads of sweat was forming on my nose and my lips started burning.  People have posted on here are 110% accurate about this restaurant being a little more spicier than the rest.  Even though it was a little too spicy for me, it was still very very good.  The luncheon plates come with a fried egg roll and fried wonton.  I also got the thai tea.  The thai tea was just a tad too sweet but still good.  I can't wait to try other things from  their menu.

April 30th
Since my initial visit, i've come back and tried the pad thai and the red chicken curry.  Both very good.  I told them I wanted a spice level of 2.5 for the chicken curry and still think it was closer to a 4.  But nonetheless tasted very good."}
{"text":"Never had anything besides pad Thai n broccoli n beef but it's so good that I always come back! I work down the street n this is the only quality food place that I can get a good meal during my 30 minute lunch. We keep coming back because the seasoning n flavor is incredible n they're fast!"}
{"text":"I've only tried the chicken yellow curry  here, but it was good. The spice levels are 1-5 but they  are waaaaay hotter than you'd expect. i usually get a 5 out of 10 any  other thai  place and that's enough heat for me , but the equivalent here would be a 1.5."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Follow the guidance of your server, she guided me on the spice level and it was perfect! Lunch specials are a great value and food is delish!  Ingredients tasted fresh and authentic and service is excellent, very genuine. No frills, great for lunch or take out."}
{"text":"I like this place! Especially when ordering take out because the portion is bigger than others. I love the fried rice and green curry here. Little mom and pop shop that will hit the spot."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!

I work around the corner from Sin City Thai and multiple people from my office (including me) eat here religiously... at least once a week!  Everything I have ever had has been awesome, and the food is consistently good... I am a curry snob, and their curry is some of the best I have ever tasted!

I also love the staff; they're all so friendly and you can tell they really care about their customers! :)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat and most definitely the best Thai food I have found in Las Vegas. For people who don't like spicy food, take their spice chart seriously.  I love that they have real spice with their food. I haven't been able to find anything like it anywhere else."}
{"text":"I have had Sin City Thai on my to do list for a while and finally got the opportunity to dine there with the some regulars. They offer delivery and takeout, but we opted to come in for lunch. 

The servers are so sweet and friendly. They were very attentive and so nice. They have a number of lunch specials to choose from that are reasonably priced and I decided on the yellow curry with pork. I ordered a 3 out of 5 spice level and had a sufficient amount of heat. My curry was a little on the sweet side, but the heat definitely helped overpower the sweetness. They offer brown rice, which I will keep in mind for my next visit. 

WIth excellent prices and convenient location, I see this as a good option for Thai food in the area."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came in for Thai and were amazed. Fresh Ingredients!!!!! Awesome service!!! A great family owned business. A must have in Vegas"}
