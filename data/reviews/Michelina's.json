{"text":"Terrible.  Don't waste your time or money.  They only have one waiter to handle the entire place and he is so scripted he doesn't make any connection to the customers.  He's just working for tips.  The food is not to my liking the marinara sauce is way too sweet for my taste.  It's also expensive for what you get.  I will never go back to that place.  I'll go back to the Avanti.   Location is not great but the food and service is so far above this place it's not even a consideration."}
{"text":"A wonderful place to have dinner. The food was superb and the service to match.  Served immediately after being prepared. Did not sit under warming lights. We had the sea bass over linguine with a delicious sauce, not too heavy just perfect. After the dinner the waitress came out with a cordial to send us on our way. It was on the house. A very pleasant surprise. I look forward to a return visit."}
{"text":"Best bruschetta that we have eaten since visiting Italy! Locally owned, cooked with love and the most Fabulous Italian food you will eat in the Valley. Excellent price. Must try.  Do not miss this Gem!"}
{"text":"3 words:  DON'T GO HERE!!!!!!

Only because I am being selfish and don't want everybody to go here.

The place is great.  Everytime we go there the food and service is great.

The cocktails are great.  

Great. Great. Great."}
{"text":"I brought an old friend from out of town to this lovely restaurant which came highly recommended. I was not disappointed! 
The ambiance was delightful, service very gracious, and the meal delicious. We started with the Oysters Michelina as an appetizer, it is the house specialty and truly a must have for anyone dining here. For entrees we had the Sea Bass and Chicken Marsala. Both cooked to perfection and wonderfully seasoned. Unfortunately we were too full for dessert but still enjoyed the complimentary after dinner drink served called \"Michelina's Kiss\". I urge anyone who is a true lover of authentic northern Italian cuisine to dine here, you will leave with a smile!"}
{"text":"Great Italian restaurant. Everything tasted very fresh. Service was excellent. The menu selections are wide ranging. The personal touch given to the service was a breath of fresh air. We loved it. The cappuccino was especially wonderful. The final dinner\"mint\" was beautiful end to a great meal."}
{"text":"Don't let the location put you off. It's in a run down, dinky strip center, but the restaurant itself is very nice.

The staff was very friendly, professional and attentive. The food was also very good. Our group had the salmon, veal Marsala and Lasagna. All were very tasty and included salads. They don't have a kids menu, but my 8 & 10 yr olds had no problem finding something they liked on the menu.

Portion sizes were just right, except for the Lasagna which was huge! Prices were on par with similar nice restaurants in Phoenix/Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"Michelina's should pop up as the #1 Italian restaurant in a Phoenix/ Scottsdale Yelp search. The menu is large enough to satisfy anyone's cravings and the preparation spot on.  Our first visit was a \"word of mouth\" recommendation and I'm passing along the favor. During my last visit, everyone at our table ordered a different entr√©e, and all I heard were raves. And the service was impeccable.  Try the Veal Marsala or any one of the chicken dishes, you won't be disappointed. And save room for the Zabaglione; fresh and fabulous.

If you are seeking delightful Italian dining, Michelina's is the place!"}
{"text":"We've been going to Michelina's for 8 years now. It's our favorite romantic date night spot. The food is unbelievable. The owner/chef is always in the house, but the main host is very sweet and attentive. Excellent service here. I can't even start to tell you what to try. Everything I've had is good, starting with the appetizers all the way to dessert. I love the Caprese, the chicken Marsala, and chicken parmigiana. It's all good. They have a pretty extensive wine list as well, including some very reasonable offerings price wise. Surprise your date with this fabulous spot. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"There are few places in this city which can truly transport you to the country of culinary origin and Michelina's does just that. Michelina is the owner and chef (if you couldn't tell by the restaurant name) and she made it her personal duty to meet us with every dish she prepared and ensure its taste to our delight. She cooks all of the food and even hand picks and prepares the flower arrangements that are placed throughout her restaurant. She was born and raised in Southern Italy and knows her Italian cuisine (I know this because she took the time to simply chat with us; her passion for pleasing her customers is palpable). I will have a hard time enjoying everyday food after now tasting true quality. This is a fantastic place where my wife and I will be enjoying dinners for many years to come."}
{"text":"First time there after seeing on Check Please AZ.  Service extremely slow.  Very noisy.  Was very busy Sat. night.  After 15 min with no one asking us for a drink order, had to ask a busboy to find our waiter.  We had the fish special and the Veal Parm.  The veal was average at best with average pasta side.  The red sauce was good.  The Fish special sounded good but was average at best.  My wife and I agreed that we would not go back."}
{"text":"We came to this restaurant on the recommendation of a friend. We were sadly disappointed. While the atmosphere and service were great, the food was barely mediocre especially for the prices. Their meatballs are like rubber. Won't go back."}
{"text":"Had a very good experience approximately a year ago and decided to go there for Mother's Day. What a miserable experience!
I don't think that they can handle a full restaurant. The service was terrible and the food was below average. The Salmon Special was very fishy and the chicken dish i ordered was dry and didn't taste very good. Nobody at our table enjoyed their meal. We chose the worst to complain about and they did take the Salmon off the bill. The waiter said that nobody else complained about it. I find that hard to believe. As we were exiting the restaurant the fishy odor was so strong we could hardly breathe. The bread and salad were good and the fresh flowers very pretty, but the food wasn't. It took over an hour to be served and the order wasn't right, when we got it. 
So disappointed! We all left feeling hungry."}
{"text":"We dine here about once a month, and have for years. Love the food - the oysters Michelina are so so good (especially with her homemade bread to sop up the sauce) and the pasta is fresh and lovely. It's a small place and has been at the same location for something like 20 years, so the decor is slightly dated but we go there all the time for the fabulous food and wine. Brad is awesome as host/waiter/bartender, and of course we alwasy enjoy a visit to our table by Michelina's herself, which is always a nice touch."}
{"text":"Interesting soothing decor makes me feel at home when growing up as a first generation Italian American. Both parents from Napoli Chicciano and Ischia.

Cuisine reminiscent of home"}
{"text":"Michelina's,  without a doubt, has the best food of any Italian restaurant in the Phoenix metro area, if not the best food of any restaurant period.

The Oysters Michelina are amazing.  Make sure you dip the bread in the sauce!  The fried calamari is done perfectly and is served with Michelina's marinara sauce, which is so good you can just dip bread in that too!

All the parmigiana dishes, veal, chicken and eggplant, are outstanding and served with linguini in marinara sauce.  The fresh fish putanesca (sometimes halibut, sometimes sea bass) is served over linguini and is delicious.  If you want to eat healtier, get the grilled Escalar served over fresh spinach.  It's awesome.  My wife doesn't like fish but she LOVES the escalar.  I saw another reviewer say the escalar was bleh.  She must have drank too much wine that night.  Best grilled fish of any kind I've ever had.

Michelina also makes her own italian sausage from scratch.  Try the sausage and peppers over pasta.  Wow.  If you like it hot, ask for it hot and she will gladly make it spicy for you!

I can go on and on because over the years, I have eaten everything on the menu.  I can honestly say I have LOVED every meal I have ever eaten at Michelina's.

And with Michelina's great food, you also get Brad's great service.  Brad is the best waiter that has ever existed in the Phoenix area, if not on the planet.  Ask anyone that knows him or knows of him and I am sure they will say the same thing.

For dessert, the zabaglione (a creamy italian custard over fresh berries) and the tiramisu are to die for and are both made from scratch by Michelina.

Is it expensive?   Well, if you are used to getting the $10 special at the Olive Garden or some other chain, then, yes.  But, I took my wife and daughter to the Cheescake Factory the other night and dropped $100 and my wife and I went to Pappadeaux's a couple weeks ago and spent $90.  And, we do not drink anything stronger than Iced Tea.  Both times, on our way home, we said \"We should have gone to Michelina's\".  The bottom line is that the prices are very reasonable.  

Do yourself a favor.  Next time you want to go to a chain and spend $50-$100, go to Michelina's instead.  You will be glad you did!"}
{"text":"By far without reservation this is the best Italian food you'll have without having to fly to Rome. Being from Chicago I was absolutely blown away by how authentic and fresh the food was. You'd be hard pressed to find a better Italian joint that's family owned for miles. Take my word on this place. 10 stars with food and service."}
{"text":"We love this cozy Italian neighborhood restaurant.
The owners and staff are so attentive and make everyone feel special.
We have loved every entree we have tried here.
The ambience is quite romantic and the food is authentic Italian.
We always look forward to returning"}
{"text":"We were customers during the first week after opening and we have been coming back for all these years. We eat great Italian food at home, but sometimes the Italian cook wants to go out to dinner, too. For Italian, this is the place! However, we think that for seafood, this is the place, too. There are always 2 or 3 fresh fish  specials and they are always terrific. The pasta is always well prepared. Michelina will adjust anything to taste, and, when time permits, she strolls through the restaurant, checking with all the tables.

Brad is a waiter, a greeter, a bar tender, and a jack of all trades, having been there for as long as we can remember. There is nothing like a warm greeting when you show up at a familiar-feeling place.

Don't miss the fact that there are big bouquets of fresh flowers spread throughout the dining room."}
{"text":"We had: excellent artichoke salad, superb oysters Michelina and veal piccata. As for the saltinbocca I was quite disappointed not to find at least one leave of sage in the preparation. I have been eating Saltinbocca from Brussels through Paris, Milano, Bologna, New York and Chicago as it is my favourite veal recipe but without sage it is not a saltinbocca. We'll definitely will return to this restaurant but I will insist on getting the saltinbocca as it should be."}
{"text":"I am always comfortable in Michelina's, the service is excellent and they are not rushing you to \"turn the table\".  Michelina's cooking is fantastic!  Her daily specials are so inviting that I rarely order from the menu.  The drinks are excellent, bread just right, and the after dinner complimentary cordial is a nice finish.  One of the best kept secrets in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place to eat at in the Phoenix valley.  From the outside, it doesn't look like much, but inside it is a classy and cosy little place.  The food, of course, is the main attraction - I love Italian cuisine, and they do it very well here.  The bread is great, the house salad is fresh and very satisfying.  I ordered the cannelloni, with the red sauce instead of the white, and enjoyed it very much.  (I really like their marinara sauce.)  We were stuffed, so did not order dessert, but we were brought a complimentary little liquor drink after dinner - it was yummy.  We can't wait to go back again and explore the menu more, and next time, we must try the cheesecake. Our waiter was wonderful - very knowledgable and helpful."}
{"text":"Unbelievable food! The oysters Michelina is some of  the most amazing food I've had in a long time! The family atmosphere and personal service make me feel like a vip!"}
{"text":"After seeing so many 5 stars on Yelp and craving some good italian food, Michelina's was a no-brainer.  Arrived right on time with a 6:30PM reservation and they took us the moment we arrived.  The place looked nice with white tablecloths and beautiful fresh flowers throughout.  We sat on chairs that were so comfortable that we felt the owners really considered their customers' comfort.  We ordered a house chianti which was delicious and were provided a bread basket that had the most delicious bread.  I don't know for sure but it might be from Noble Bakery.  We made a mix of olive oil, salt and pepper on our appetizer plates and had a dunk-fest with that great bread.  All entrees come with a salad which was fresh and had the most delicious balsamic-based dressing.  I'm not crazy about balsamic but this dressing was really good.  It took about 1 hour for us to get our entrees but we realized that home cooking along with the crowd made for a slow turn-around.  Hubby ordered Halibut Puttanesca, one of the special ,which was accompanied by a little pasta.  I ordered the Chicken Sorrentino which also came with pasta.  I have one word for both dishes.  UNDER-SEASONED.  My husband was silent while eating... that means one thing... either it is so delicious he can't stop eating... or he is trying to cope with an unsatisfying dish.  So I asked, how is your halibut?  He said OK.  So I asked a more meaningful question:  Would you order it again? To which I received a quick, NO.  I asked to taste his dish.  I thought the puttanesca sauce was good although a little vinegary.  The halibut was almost without salt. I might even venture to say that it had no salt.  Saltless halibut takes like nothing. Any food without salt is tasteless.   Either the cook thought that the capers and olives might over salt the dish or s/he is cooking for people with high blood pressure.  I really hate tasteless fish. 
My dish suffered from the same ailment.  The chicken had no salt,  the eggplant in it had no salt.  Only the proscuitto in the dish had any salt.  Did the cook think the proscuitto's saltiness would be imparted to the chicken and the eggplant? Not so my dear, not so.  So I ate the pasta which accompanied my dish and that was it for dinner.  Glad I ate bread at the beginning of the meal as well as the salad.  You might say I had a vegetarian meal.  The Service provided by Joe was spot-on.  Otherwise, it was a disappointing meal for both of us."}
{"text":"Great food! A traditional menu which is hard to find among trendy restaurants trying to outdo each other with ridiculous offerings! Lots of flavor and all 4 of us were very happy. They make their own bread. It comes out hot with butter. Amazing! And we were given a yummy complimentary cordial at the end of our meal. Atmosphere is always important and sets the tone. Love the multilevel rooms which are conducive to low noise and a sense of intimacy.  White tablecloths yet not pretentious. The staff were impeccable. Not too clingy but there when you need them. It irks me when people write a review based on their guesses. Guessing that Oslo Bucco. veal was cooked separately from the bone with no fact to back that up should not be reviewed that way. And if you think things were cooked without salt then add some. There are plenty of people that over salt their food and some that prefer none. Personal preference. I would definitely return!!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful little restaurant hidden in a strip mall.  Great food.  Service is top notch.
If you have not tried this food you are missing a real treat."}
{"text":"This food at this restaurant is to die for!!! Best Italian food we ever had, by far the best! My husband and I ate there last night and I am still thinking about that delicious tiramisu we had for dessert. Everything about this place was excellent from the time we reserved the seats to after we left. When I called to make our reservation, I spoke with Brad (I think it was him), and he was very friendly and welcoming. The server and the lady who brought us bread and kept filling our glasses with water so we never run out were great. The salads, which was part of our entrees, were perfect. The dressing made the salad so delicious. Bread was warm and fresh, I am pretty sure they make their own bread. Haven't had real fresh baked Italian bread since I left New York City, which were many years ago, and this bread brought so many flashbacks from My time enjoying Italian bread. I ordered the mussels in marinara sauce with linguine (I think that's what it was) and my husband had the fettuccine Alfredo. The pasta felt so velvety and silky, this pasta was the best we ever had. We usually do not order dessert, but we just had to have it at Michelina's. My husband and I shared the tiramisu and it came with 2 small glasses of blended liqueurs. It was tasty and sweet. The tiramisu was the best I had. I've tried tiramisu a in other places, but this one was perfection in a plate. It was not too sweet, it was just right! Michelina, the owner of the restaurant, and Brad came to our table to see how everything was going, despite how busy it was. When we left, Michelina was at the door asking how everything went and also wanted to get to know us better. She was very welcoming and made you feel like a guest at an Italian home. Best dining experience we had, and we plan to go back! This restaurant was recommended by our tour guide Cory when we asked which was the best Italian restaurant in Phoenix. We came in with high expectations of this restaurant, and left with exceeded expectations that were met!"}
{"text":"We have eaten here a number of times and have never been disappointed.  We took our son there on 6/23/17.  He had the Osso Bucco and thought it was very good (I have had it in the past and I agree).  I had the Sea Bass and was very pleased with the meal.  My wife had the Penne Pasta and thought it was very good.  The service is outstanding.  I think that if you give it a try, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Michelina's is my favorite Italian restaurant in Phoenix! Completely authentic with no modern twists. I love the red sauce and the chicken parm is incredible!"}
{"text":"I went to dinner at Michelina's for the first time last night.  It is located in a strip mall just west of the 51--and talk about unassuming from the  outside!  the strip mall neighbors include a psychic and a locksmith--once inside the aromas take over and you know you will be having something wonderful.   The restaurant  is nice inside, but it is the food that is wonderful.  I had the sausage and peppers which was terrific and they provide everyone with a complementary frangelica after dinner.  the meal was reasonably priced for the quality of food and i will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"A very good Italian restaurant near where we stayed during a conference in Phoenix.  I would say very old style Italian as it was very dimly lit and had that ambiance about it that definitely is not modern or fast food bright and slick.   The food was very nicely done and the service was impeccable.
 
We tried the Oysters Michelina, supposedly inspired by a dream of the chef.  They were outstanding, one of the best baked oyster dishes we have tried and it's hard to beat what you find in New Orleans.  I had my reservations since Phoenix is a long way from the ocean. The chef should keep on dreaming.

We stuck with the classic Italian dishes.  My lasagna was very good and my son tried the veal parmigiana.  Wonderful house bread and butter and a glass of house Chianti rounded out a perfect Italian meal."}
{"text":"Group party dinner the night before the 2011 Rock and Roll Arizona Marathon. The restaurant was busy that night, but isn't it always before a marathon? The entrees were pricey, but I guess that's normal for authentic Italian dishes. Good times, great company. 

I had the veal lasanga, side salad, with 2 bottles of Heinekin. Wasn't the best, since the portions were smaller, service could've been better, and the prices were just a bit too much."}
{"text":"Had I great experience and outstanding  dinner at Michelina's tonight! Brad our waiter was very personable and made some great suggestions. The bread was very good & hot and there was plenty of olive oil & butter on hand.  I had the cioppino which was excellent and huge - large amounts of fish calamari & clams. Others in the group has the sea bass putenesca & the the braciole - all were very pleased - will certainly go back soon"}
{"text":"My daughter and my first time here. AMAZING! 
My daughter keeps on saying that she hopes to be engaged here! (me too! Haha)
Food, wine and ambience is wonderful. 
We are from NY and very reminiscent of a NYC/Bronx mom and pop establishment. 
Plates are clean! 
Will be back!"}
{"text":"Perfect in every way. Terrific, warm & knowledgeable team. Terrific Italian food with a emphasis on fresh seafood creations. Always a pleasure to visit when in Phoenix area and worth a drive if necessary. Put it on your short list!"}
{"text":"We come to Phoenix about three times s year, and we never miss a great Italian dinner at Michelina's. Family owned and great food."}
{"text":"Very good food. Love the bread, salad and stuffed shells w/alfredo sauce. The complimentary after dinner drink is pretty awesome too. Great spot."}
{"text":"I can't say enough great things about Michelina's!  Wonderful food, great service!  I have eaten there twice in the last three weeks!!  Took my mom for her birthday, and loved it so much, had to bring some friends from out of town two weeks later for a Christmas dinner.  Outstanding authentic food, beautiful atmosphere!!!  I will be coming back again and again!!  Brad is great, takes reservations and is a waiter as well!  Great, great service.  I have been to Italy and this quaint, lovely restaurant really brings me back with the little bar at the entrance too!  Brings me back to Rome.  Just great, you must go!  Truly a lovely dining experience!"}
{"text":"I had seen good reviews for this restaurant, and wanted to try.  It's a block from my apartment, but the prices looked a little high.  I'm so glad we decided to go anyway.  First of all, don't be fooled by the outside of the building.  Once you enter, you are transformed--the place is much bigger than it appears, and beautifully decorated.  I knew we were going to be happy when the server brought out the most terrific, crispy bread I've had in ages.  We split the calamari, which had a light, tasty breading and wasn't greasy at all.  Even the tentacle pieces were good (if you don't think about it too much).  I got the spaghetti and meatballs, as they did not offer just spaghetti marinara.  Rolled those two giant meatballs right onto the plate with my partner's lasagna and every one was happy.  I have to admit, though, I would have just been happy eating a dinner size portion of the garden salad that came with the entree.  The salad dressing was amazing, the vegetables were fresh, and when I was done I wanted more.  Next time, I'll probably just get an order of bruschetta and a side salad, if that's possible.  But I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"We found this place through the great reviews on Yelp.  We are always looking for tasty and authentic Italian food.  We split a caesar salad and I enjoyed the penne di casa...a large portion that was so tasty.  This is definitely a great neighborhood find and it seems to have a great following of regulars to enjoy this great and reasonably priced food.  The restaurant could definitely use an upgrade, but the food is good enough to overlook the decor (or lack thereof)."}
{"text":"Yum! Good hearty Traditional Italian food. The chicken Parmesan was delicious and everything tasted completely  homemade.  The house dressing was absolutely delicious as well. Service was good and I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to this wonderful place.
The outside of the restaurant is very unassuming with a simple awing that hints at the wonderful experience that awaits for you beyond the doors.

The atmosphere within is very warm and welcoming and fresh flowers adorn the many half walls that divide the dining rooms from each other.
The staff are very attentive and made sure I didn't have a want unfilled.

I had the Home Made Sausages with Peppers meal.  I wish I had my phone out when the food arrived so I could have taken a picture.  It looked wonderful and the aroma that was wafting up from the plate filled me with awe.  Then I took my first bite.  It was like gates of heaven had opened and fill my soul with pure joy.  To say it was very good would be an understatement.

The meals also come with a house salad and the salad had two slices of beets.  As a child I hated beets and would avoid them at all costs.  However something told me to try them in the salad.  Much to my wife's amusement, I discovered that I liked the beets. :)  
 
I very much look forward to returning and trying other wonderful dishes prepared by Michelina."}
{"text":"Great spot, excellent traditional northern Italian meals.  Great service, price is right.  Hidden gem."}
{"text":"We have ordered take out from this place for the last few years and finally had dinner a couple of weeks ago. I love the food and the out-dated decor. I really do. I would not change a thing here. The food is great, the wait staff remember us, the owner/chef is always cheery and welcoming. The food is always delicious and we always say that we need to come here more often."}
{"text":"Too pricey for the food. The meal I had was just ok. My MIL had a terrible loud garlic pasta. It was stinky. They were also not too happy to see my two kids in tow."}
{"text":"I just read an unfavorable Yelp review and felt the need to respond.  Michelina's is the finest Italian restaurant in Phoenix / Scottsdale.  The location does not inspire, but the food and service are 5 Star.  I have been going to Michelina's for 30 years.  The pasta dishes are amazing and the specials are always...special.  The sauce in Oysters Michelina should be trademarked.  I have dined at every top rated Phoenix area restaurant and will always choose Michelina's for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Okay...... The only reason I did not give five stars is because of the desert. Everything else was perfect.  We loved the decor the feeling we got there everything was great. The food was outstanding we had to travel quite a ways to get there it was well worth the travel. We ordered the desert that everybody talk about on yelp the custard. We think it might've been the day before's custard because it was watery at the bottom. We would not let this from stop us from going back.  

Our waitress was very well spoken and was very informed. Made us feel very welcome and we thoroughly enjoyed it. Funny we read a lot of stuff about Brad the waiter and she ended up being his stepdaughter she was a great waitress too.

Feel bad I have to get four stars because of the desert but I have to be honest for my fellow yelpers."}
{"text":"I love Italian food and my boyfriend is always looking for new places to try, so we went here NYE. Dinner was amazing. It was a set menu for the holiday like many restaurants do, but excellent nonetheless. All of the staff gave the impression that they have been working at Michelina's a long time, and genuinely happy to be there, despite it being a holiday."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places! The food is consistently excellent and the waitstaff friendly and attentive. Not unusual at all for Michelina to visit with the diners and ask how their food is. 

It is in its 25th year and is located in a very non-descript center which boasts a palm reader and small appliance parts distributor, but don't let that fool you. Once you walk through the door, you are transported into a very well-designed space with great ambience. Several of the waiters have been there since the beginning, and if you are somewhat regular, they may even remember your favorite beverage!!

I would suggest leaving young children at home - I'm not aware of a specific kid's menu but I'm guessing most people dining here probably prefer their dining experience to be sans little ones. It's a great date place, but also a wonderful place for larger gatherings.

On New Year's Eve, they have a prix fixe menu which is awesome and very popular. You can be notified of special events such as wine tastings throughout the year, too.

Excellent all the way around."}
{"text":"Terrific meal, family owned, the cook came out and talked with our  group!"}
{"text":"As I gave a presentation early in the week on Memorable Customer Service. A woman mentioned this place.  I am delighted by the food, and especially the service!  Wonderful find. Support local business, and having amazing cuisine makes it easier."}
{"text":"I've lived in the neighborhood, less than one mile away from this restaurant for over 20-years and I don't know why I never went here. But just last week my entire family went in and I could not be happier we did! The food was excellent. It may not have been five stars but four for sure. The service however and the overall experience was the best I've ever had anywhere! You feel like you are eating in Michelina's home kitchen and you are. Everyone who works there takes a tremendous pride in the restaurant and what they do. Everyone who works there is very, very good at what they do. It's a restaurant operated with love instead of profit in mind. A great value. We will be back over and over again."}
{"text":"After hearing from my parents how amazing this place was we decided to give it a try.  It is small and intimate and exactly what you would expect a family owned Italian restaurant to be.  The food was delicious (both of us had lasagna and both of us cleaned our bowls).  The dessert was amazing (cheesecake was fantastic) and the after dinner drinks were a fun touch.  We will return and often.  I can't believe I never tried this place before!"}
{"text":"On a trip to Arizona we looked for an Italian restaurant and scored a big hit !!

Probably a nice a dinner as I have had in years.  We were able to enjoy our cocktails and not be rushed to place our order.  Excellent salad; outstanding Banfi (from Italy) wine; the  veal parmigiana was to die for!!

The Owner / Chef was the perfect host ... the complimentary after dinner drink was a plus.

The prices were reasonable, the service terrific and the dinner was great."}
{"text":"We thought we'd  try it for Jamie's 17th birthday after seeing it on Check Please, service sucked. Forgot our hosts beverage and compd it,  thank you. Food sub par. Never going back. Tutti Santi 10x better for the price, service, location."}
{"text":"One of the most romantic places I've ever eaten dinner is at Michelina's in Phoenix, and if you haven't been there yet, I suggest you set up your next date there now.

The Italian restaurant, run by Miss Michelina DiSibio, is a gorgeous fresh flower-filled eatery, complete with white linen-covered tables, pretty lighting and friendly, competent servers. And usually, Michelina herself visits tables to make sure guests are perfectly satisfied with what they're dining on.

The menu is classic Italian, with recipes Michelina brought with her from her native Italy. At a recent visit, I had the absolutely amazing pasta shells stuffed with spinach and ricotta ($17.95), which I covered in both alfredo and marinara sauces to create a divine creamy concotion. I've been there many times and also really love the salads and desserts, especially the tiramisu. Everyone I've dined there with has also raved about the food.

The place is so pretty and cozy, the food so delicious and the staff so professional and friendly, it's a guarantee you'll want to go back."}
{"text":"Amazing chef, Michelina. Service by Brad, the man of many hats, is unsurpassable. Elegant & romantic atmosphere make for a fine date night. I would eat here every day my health could take it. There is not an item on the menu that won't knock your socks off. Menu is suitably priced for the quality and service that comes with it. Can't wait to visit again."}
{"text":"No change after 20 years. We moved from Phoenix in 1994 and haven't been back until yesterday. It's the same, and that's a great thing. Same great food, same reasonable prices, same Michelina. One of the hidden treasures of Paradise Valley. It's right on the 51 at Shea so it's convenient from anywhere in the valley. Can't recommend it enough. It's great when good things don't change."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely amazing. Michelina puts so much love into her food and you definitely can taste it. This woman cooks so good I wanted to kiss her hands. From the moment we walked into the restaurant they did nothing but impress. They knew my name and who I was as soon as we walked in. Greeted me and took us to our beautifully set candle lit table. The intimate, gorgeous, flower-filled restaurant illuminated alluring lighting. The manager was a master of his craft. He was an absolute pleasure. He knew everything on the menu and off the menu. We started off with the bread, olive oil, with a little balsamic, la caprese. The tomato was so fresh and the tomato and the mozzarella were perfectly sliced. The wine we ordered was a Malbec. Hands down the best wine I've ever had. We were going to order a salad but they bring you a delicious salad before you receive your meal. I was unsure about what to choose for my entree because everything looked so great. I thought I would keep it simple with spaghetti and meatballs with angel hair pasta. I should have known by now, nothing is simple with this place. It was the best spaghetti and meatballs I've ever had! After the meal, they brought us these small drinks. I'm not sure what they were but they had a hint of mint, and honey. Very delicious. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Mother's Day dinner, busy dinner. Excellent service and food. The sea bass was excellent, my husband had shrimp and scallops it was very delicious. The owner stopped by the table and we were were impressed."}
{"text":"This restaurant is great. Best real Italian food around. Michelina is an amazing cook and is such a great lady. Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"How could this restaurant get anything other than 5 stars....The food is exceptional, the atmosphere is quiet and Brad who has been there for 30 years is the best server on earth. What else is there to say but try t.. Added plus, they take reservations."}
{"text":"I really would like to give Michelina's more than 3 stars.  The service, atmosphere, wine, and food were all pretty good.  Michelina herself even came by the table to check on us.  However, for $50 per person, I believe we deserved to be blown away!  We were satisfied, but not blown away...

It was a rainy Friday night, and my boyfriend was craving Italian as was the other couple we went out with... They relied on me to choose the restaurant, so I remembered that I enjoyed Michelina's a few months back with some family that was in from out-of-town.  (Please note that I never saw the bill that last time and had no clue how expensive everything was during that visit.)  

There were no Yelp reviews yet, so even more appealing, right?  I could be the first!  So, here it goes:

Michelina's is hiding in a very unassuming little shopping center off of Shea and the 51.  I would guess that their business is mostly from word-of-mouth because I'd never noticed the location before my first visit nor had I heard of it!  I made a reservation to be safe, but I don't know if we really needed it or not.  

Brad was our server and he was excellent.  He took drink orders and recommended 2 appetizer specials:  Eggplant rollatini and Oysters with spinach, ricotta, and bay shrimp in an alfredo sauce.  We took one of each for the table.  Brad commented that we could wait to see if we liked the apps to know if we could trust him or not.  We did trust him - we were all pleased with the appetizers even though I thought the Oysters were a bit heavy.

We went with a bottle of Merlot for the table (I don't remember the name of it) and it was good - nothing special, but good.  For our entrees, I went with the escolar special - served on a bed of sauteed spinach; Jared went with the Veal Chop special served with fresh pasta shells stuffed with spinach and ricotta; Deborah took Brad's advice and ordered the Chicken Genovese special; and Jack had the Veal Saltimbocca layered with prosciutto and mozzarella cheese.  (More on entrees coming soon...)

This is where the highlight of the meal came in... we were all pleasantly surprised that dinner salads came with our entrees.  There was no mention of this on the menu, so when Brad brought out the salad course, it was an added bonus!  The house dressing was delicious and the salads were basic but fresh and delicious!

Back to the entrees... Jared was the most pleased with his (the Veal Chop with fresh shells) - he said it was excellent!  We all had meal envy because the rest of the entrees were kind of bleh - not Worth the $25/$30 for each of them.  Jack and Deborah mentioned after that perhaps our meals would have been better if Michelina added about a cup less salt to each of them!

We opted against dessert, but the boys had some coffee/cappuccino and Brad brought us all out a complimentary apertif of amaretto, creme de menthe, and creme de cacao... I don't think any of us were interested, but it was a sweet (literally sweet) gesture.

We all left feeling satisfied but not blown away... We won't be rushing back to visit Michelina anytime soon, but if money is not an issue, go check it out and let me know what you think.  Maybe your experience will be worth more than 3 stars!"}
{"text":"Omg can I just say, AMAZING!!!  I love Italian food and back home in Hawaii we don't have much a selection.  So when making this years Valentine's date I came across this place.  Food is awesome! Service is awesome!  I didn't get the name of our server,  he was a taller gentleman with glasses and his service was fantastic!  At first this place looks like a whole in the wall place and I thought I failed the date lol but we got in and the authentic Italian \"family\" environment was exactly what I was looking for.  I had the Veal which fell of the bone and melted in my mouth! Wine! Stuffed shells! Muscles! I can go on!  All I can say is I will be back again and that I was very satisfied with this restaurant and would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I cannot even begin to tell you how angry I am about my experience here.  My family is Italian from NY and I drove almost an hour to try out this place because of its reviews.

We pulled into a dark divey parking lot, next to an appliance part store. We walked in and my first thought was that they were busy, so that's good right? The decor is sterile and outdated, no music and in need of some warmer inviting ambiance. We were told it will be would a few minutes since we didn't have a reservation, although there were still tables open, so we waited 10-15, no big deal. 

We finally get sat, and a lady brought over water and bread. We looked over the menu and planned what we were going to order. The waiter finally came over 10 minutes later and got our drinks and told us the specials....then walked away.  We waited another 15 minutes for him to return which never happened. By this point,  I have been here over 30 minutes and felt like we were absolutely being ignored and judged on purpose. Btw, the server was an older gentleman, gray hair. I own a business,  if one of my employees treated a guest like this I would be embarrassed. 

I would not recommend this place...ridiculous customer service."}
{"text":"What a sweet little surprise. Adam and I just loved it.  Everything is homemade and it is a very romantic spot"}
{"text":"We found this place because of Groupon last year.  We waited until the day before it expired to redeem it.  That was a mistake.  We made reservations for 7 pm and when we arrived the place was slammed.  Everyone was trying to redeem their Groupon.  Because we had a reservation, we thought we were golden....nope, we ended up waiting for 45 min.  You could tell that the employees were super stressed.  I actually felt bad for them.  The food was very good and we wanted to give this place another chance, so we decided to come back another time when they weren't busy with Grouponers.

Several months later we returned and had a normal dinner here.  The service was excellent and we had a much better experience than before.

Some of the menu items we sampled:

Escargots - $10.95
Caprese Salad - $13.95
Stuffed Shells (Spinach & Ricotta) - $17.95
Lasagna - $17.95

The Better Half loved the Escargots.  She ordered it both visits.  I enjoyed the Stuffed Shells the first time and had the Lasagna on the second trip.  Between the two, the Stuffed Shells were my favorite.  I'm glad we came back for a second trip.

Return Factor - 85%"}
{"text":"My fiance and I tried the place because of a Groupon.  We live in the same neighborhood and see the place all the time but the look of the place was never enough to draw us in.  There is nothing eye catching about the business front at all.  It's in a strip mall and looks old.  At night, they turn on strands of tacky Christmas lights that only attract attention to the fact that the lights are so poorly hung.

When we arrived for dinner we were greeted by an empty corridor, no host station and no host.  We could see what looked to be a bar but it wasn't a bar that I'd want to eat, drink and socialize at.  To pass the time until we were finally greeted we browsed the many framed publications touting how incredible the place was.  I'm already here...I don't need any more persuasion.  It's time for the Chef/owner to take down the \"look how good I was\" trophy wall and go with a more inviting modern look.

We were greeted by friendly gentleman who seated us on the main lower floor.  He handed us our menus and asked if he could get us something to drink.  There is no drink menu on the menu.  No beer list, no soda list, no liquid period.  We asked to see the wine list, which had only bottle prices and doesn't even hint that they sell wine by the glass.  Once I asked if they had beer and sold wine by the glass it was like we made a breakthrough.   The menu seems a bit outdated so I  went with the Lasagna, the basics.  While we sat waiting for our meal, the salads came.  Weird...the menu didn't mention anything about a salad nor did the waiter.   More lack of information from the menu.

Now on to the decor.  It is terribly outdated.  Tacky, bland, pale paint scheme, brass fixtures, mirrors and cliche wine bottles.  There were beautiful fresh flowers throughout which we really enjoyed.  I was unfortunately seated directly in front of two paintings both with a woman and a little girl drinking what appears to be wine.  I'm guessing they are personal family paintings but they are horribly out of place and bordering on creepy.  I couldn't take my eyes off of them and that distracted me throughout the night.  This place needs a makeover, new modern paint scheme and some updating on the artwork.

The lasagna came.  It was OK at best.  I tried my fiance's chicken genevese at it was horrible.  The chicken tasted like it was boiled which is an instant dish killer for me.  We did not take our leftovers.  We asked for the check and it came with a after dinner cordial which was a nice surprise and tasted delicious. 

We won't be back.  To be honest Oregano's lasagna is better by far."}
{"text":"I ate at this cozy little restaurant during a visit to Scottsdale.  While the place isn't glamorous from the outside the inside has a nice traditional atmosphere that provided a nice dining experience.  The food was worth while as well. I had a fettuccini dish that was pretty good and my company had the \"special\" that got good reviews.  All in all this restaurant provides a nice dining option for Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I gave three stars due to the good / bad parts of dinner. We started out with the soup which was excellent. For my meal I had eggplant parmigiana which was fantastic and a large portion. I loved that they peel the eggplant so it does not have the skin on. It was cooked perfectly. Unfortunately my husbands meal was not as good. He had the clams in marinara sauce which had good flavor but also had sand and broken shells in it. He kept trying to eat from another portion of the plate but the results were the same. We mentioned it to the waiter even giving him a piece of shell. The waiter said he had never seen that before and would show the cook. Nothing more was ever said or done about my husbands meal which is why the three stars. It was like it was brushed off and never happened. Don't order clams if you decide to try this restaurant."}
{"text":"Originally from Chicago I'm used to great Italian food. Michelina's is now my \"go to\" restaurant in Phoenix. I judge Italian restaurants on their veal Parmesan. It was delicious! It is a down home Italian restaurant moderately priced. The service is fast and friendly. I have been there 2x in the last 6 weeks and will go again soon. Highly recommend if you like authentic Italian food"}
{"text":"Oh Noes! You told! This was supposed to be a secret place so we could have it all to ourselves! Now, there will be crowds waiting for the eggplant rollatini and antipasto salads... I'll have to wait in line to get a table so I can have my Shrimp FraDiavolo or my Tortellini. Surely they will be running out of the dinner specials early now that everyone will be flocking there for dinner. I'll have to call ahead to make sure they save a Tiramisu or a cannoli for me."}
{"text":"I have been to Michelinas a couple times in the last 6 years or so. Both times the food was very good.

Last time I had the eggplant Parmesan. Very tasty and a generous portion. My husband had their seafood pasta which he said was delicious.

The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because of the steep prices. It's not very often I spend more than $20 on a vegetarian dish. Hence why I only went a couple times. But the service is great and the atmosphere is classy and romantic. It is a good place for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Found this place searching online for veal parmigiana.  The food was excellent and the service by Joe was impeccable.  I always judge an Italian restaurant on the marinara and it was excellent here.  I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"I am going to start with mentioning that I don't feel this is a kid-friendly restaurant at all.  Matter of fact, if you need to accommodate a child under the age of 12, you might as well not even consider this restaurant.  First of all, we walked in with a reservation, but still ended up waiting for almost 20 minutes for a table.  Once we were finally seated, the lovely bartender/host took our drink order, and we waited another ten-fifteen minutes for our server.  Our server never introduced himself and honestly seemed like we were a bother because we weren't one of his \"regulars.\"  We asked if our daughter could get an order of fettuccine Alfredo without the protein and were promptly told he didn't know because they frown on substitutions.  It wasn't a substitution. It was an omission.   Fettuccine Alfredo was already a menu item.  We just wanted it without the salmon.  Our drinks and salads arrived, but our server was pretty much out of the scene until after our entrees were delivered.  Our entrees were good.  I ordered the Chicken Sorrentino.  My husband ordered the stuffed shells, and my daughter did end up with a child's portion of fettuccine Alfredo for $18 a plate. Ouch.  The food was tasty. The homemade pasta was delicious.  We had the Tiramisu for dessert. It was incredible.  This, in my mind, was truly a case of \"bad service ruins good food.\""}
{"text":"I had heard a lot about this place to start off with, but it is definitely one of those \"Gotta experience it to believe it!\". 

It definitely lived up to its reputation with the most AMAZING oyster plate I have had in a long time! It was stuffed with shrimp, spinach and topped off with some WONDERFUL sauce that drove me absolutely crazy for the place. 
Mind you, it's only Michelina herself cooking for, on a Friday night, over 30 people easy, as far as i could tell. 

At the end of our dinner, she came out and introduced herself to ALL her customers to make sure everything was tasted up to par. How many cooks will do that every night? 

To say the least, I will definitely be seeing her soon and enjoying those DELICIOUS Michelina's Oysters!"}
{"text":"Very authentic Italian food. It has been established for many years. The taste in every dish is very good. I had the salmon with fettuccini. My friend had the angel hair pasta with red sauce and chicken. The desserts were exceptional. I believe the cheesecake is one of the best I have ever had. Just angelic. I will drive to eat their homemade cheesecake. The mango sorbet dipped in white chocolate was delicious as well."}
{"text":"I'd give Michelina's more than 5 stars if I could.  Delicious hot bread arrived after we were seated.  The service was attentive without being obtrusive.  The decor is frozen in time which only enhances the charm.   Our entrees were some of the best Italian food we've ever eaten even in more traditional Italian cities.    Compliments to the chef and staff! What a hidden gem in North Phoenix"}
{"text":"This place was recommended to us by an Italian girl, so we were thinking it has to be good if an Italian girl loves this place! 
Off we go...

The place is a little hard to find. It's in a crappy smelly strip mall. We walked in and it was almost like walking into someone's home with a the family oil paintings and stuff. We were seated in the maiming dining area. While the decor was outdated, it was refreshing to see some authenticity to the place. You don't see that anymore. 

The bread they brought out was delicious! it was hot and smelled of heaven! I ordered the spinach ravioli and my boyfriend got something garlic fettuccine. We ordered the fried calamari as an appetizer. A huge portion of it came out and it was by far the best freaking calamari I have ever had! It tasted fresh! Sooooo good! Then to our surprise, they brought out salads, apparently it came with the dinner. It was delicious! I loved the dressing and it had beets in it which I don't like but for some reason, it was delicious with the salad and dressing. Then our dishes came out and we were hoping they weren't too big of portions or too small, they ended up being just perfect! Our dishes were freaking delicious! The noodles tasted like they had just been made!! Mine was so flavorful but not over the top, and I tried my bf's and it was garlicky and delicious! We were very pleased! 

Service was good. Server was informative and polite.  No complaints! 

We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I will begin by saying we never made it to the food. We went for our anniversary and actually had to walk out before ordering.  I am SO very disappointed we have been talking about going here for years, so we waited for a a special occasion. I am truly perplexed by the actions of our server Joe.

Like others have said the location and decor are not noteworthy but we went for the food. From the moment we arrived it felt that we were being judged as unworthy. Feels like it has a strong base of \"regulars\" and if you aren't one well tough. 

A few others have mentioned that they felt ignored we must agree. It seems that they are under staffed or that is their business model. The majority of communication is body language and Joe said through his that either we weren't welcome or we were an inconvenience. 

When we got up to leave after 30 minutes of waiting and we were still waiting to place a food order, he seemed surprised and charged us $5 for our tea. I don't remember ever having to leave a restaurant to avoid losing my cool but you did it. Thanks. We went across SR 51 to Bootleggers and that was much more our scene. 

Word of mouth is a great way to build a business, but it appears that they have been living on that for a while. But it can also tear a business down as well.  I for my part will probably tell more than a few people our story of possibly the worst experience EVER at a restaurant.

Oh by the way he didn't even ask why we were leaving, my guess he already knew the answer."}
{"text":"First timer at restaurant. My mother has been talking about this place forever! Clearly this restaurant caters to the older crowd that has been coming there since it opened. We waited 3 hours at our table to get our main dish! First table sat, last table to be fed. Unbelievable!!! They didn't even care. Food, was just a B quality too. Service matters!! Fail!"}
{"text":"Meh.  There's so much better food and service out there in Phoenix/Scottsdale.  We tried this place again, only to be disappointed by the small portions and very poor service.  Our third time here was not a charm!"}
{"text":"The staff and the food are equally great at this quaint family style Italian Restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"I chose this restaurant for a family birthday dinner, as I had heard it was good, but saying it's good is an understatement.
It's in a small plaza, and if you aren't looking for it, you would probably miss it.  The interior is charming. Perfect for family and or friends, it's not very large so I'd recommend making reservations, which are easy via Yelp or phone. 
In addition to their menu, they had 4 dinner specials, which I think is a lot for a small business.  We were made to feel special from the moment we entered, we're seated immediately and water was served.   The meals come with a house salad. The timing of the salad to dinner was perfect, we never felt rushed. 
The food was wonderful, the staff very attentive.
I highly recommend this restaurant, and we will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Excellent Italian food.  We had the cannelloni and the lamb chops.  Everything was cooked perfectly.  Service was great.  Everything was home made.  Cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"5 stars for the food, 5 stars for the service, 2 stars for the decor.

The food and service is amazing for this family owned restaurant. Fresh and incredible food. I've been here several times and will keep coming back. 

Walking through the front door it's like going through a time warp back to 1985... oak and gold everywhere! Look passed the dated decor and you're sure to have an excellent meal / service!

Prices are reasonable. 

The after dinner free digestif drink is a nice touch! It's like a mint cookie in a glass! 

It's funny because the place is always packed with the local old peeps. I guess they know good food!"}
{"text":"Came here tonight. They had a lovely stuffed Pork with stuffed shells.  Everything tasted amazing. Especially their oysters Michelina. Always an amazing choice."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Italian food restaurant in all of Phoenix.  Everything is delicious and tastes homemade.  The cannelloni are my favorite, but pretty much everything on the menu is delicious."}
{"text":"I love this place it is locally owned who is originally from Sicily and cooks her own food and has been consistent for 20 years plus that I have been going there.  Homemade is the only way to go and there is a lovely surprise at the end of your meal."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Food is delish and service is excellent, especially when you have Brad as your server.  He's someone that truly loves what he does for a living.
Ravioli is amazing, and the linguine with clam sauce, well I could eat it every day.  Really anything you order is good!!!  Home made salad dress-yum!
Nice little neighborhood restaurant tucked away in a strip mall -try it you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Great service and food. Smaller place but makes you feel like you're home. Our server brad was amazing, very knowledgeable!"}
{"text":"Wow I really am glad Groupon guided me to this place.  I was a little worried after reading some reviews but pleasently surprised that the place didn't stink as one stated and that even though food was pricey it wasn't without merit. 

For starters the bruschetta was great I am a huge fan of garlic and there was a lot of it.  After that came the dinner salad which had a creamy homemade Italian dressing on it which was just awesome they should bottle that stuff up and sell it at the front.  Finally my main course was Veal Lasagna yes that's right VEAL mmmmm.  It was full of flavor and the portion was just right.  

After all this I still had to try a dessert so I went with raspberry sorbet dipped in dark chocolate.  It was a nice refreshing way to end the meal.  

This place would be a five star if it wasn't for the a/c pumping the whole time when it wasn't needed.  Other than that I loved it and will totally go back.  It was one of the better Italian places I have been to in the valley for food."}
{"text":"I have passed this place for 20 years and had always heard good things. Well one night when we were kidless we went. It was pricier that we thought but we forgot the price once the meals arrived. We were both very impressed. Warm homemade bread. Awesome salads. I tried the escolar (it's a fish that a friend of mine loved but I had never tried it) and it absolutely melted in my mouth. My husband enjoyed his sausage and peppers. We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Intimate Italian restaurant with great service and food in unlikely an setting. Convenient to the freeway but away from other \"hotter\" dining destinations. Don't let that fool you. It's a comfortable place with food on par to what I've had in favorite neighborhood places back in Chicago. Worth a try!"}
{"text":"We took out-of-town friends to Michelinas for their first time and they loved it as much as we do!  We all ordered something different and shared...the huge stuffed pork chop, a veal parmesan the size of the plate, two different shrimp dishes, both extraordinary!  Kayla waited on us and she was great...daughter of a great guy who has been a part of the Michelina \"family\" since its opening.  Super service by all the staff and ever so friendly.  Highly recommend this small and wonderful Italian restaurant!"}
{"text":"I ate here alone because I saw this restaurant on Check Please where I saw they ate osso bucco, my favorite Italian dish.  I have eaten osso bucco in various places in Europe as well as 3 times in Italy.  I like to match American Italian restaurants' osso bucco with the 3osso buccos I had in Italy.  

I give Michelina's osso bucco 2 stars because:

1.  it was rather small, and did not seem like a whole shank, though nothing said that it would be a whole shank.  The meat on my plate, was not attached the bone, and was a shape that inferred to me that it was never attached to THAT bone.  I think Michelina buys the veal meat, and also buys the bones separately.  Then she serves one bone and \"some\" meat on the plates.  Or she buys a whole veal shank, takes half of the meat off, and puts half of the meat plus one bone (meaning she has to buy extra bones), to make 2 dinners out of one veal shank.   Get it?   This is the smallest osso bucco I ever had in my life.

2.  the meat itself was flavorless and bland, like it was boiled in unsalted water, and then a tomato-based sauce is served over it.  But the meat does not taste like she cooks it in the sauce for hours.   

3.  the meat was soft in that it could be mashed with a fork (the meat fibers separated), but the meat itself (the fibers) was not all that tender.  I have to chew and chew and chew, the fibers do not come apart.

4.  The osso bucco sauce itself was not that exciting.  If you do not ask for extra sauce like I did, the meat would be dry and flavorless indeed.  Without the sauce, it would be just flavorless, fibrous bland meat.  

I had much better osso bucco in a square in Florence (osso bucco in Italy is only about $12 - $15 euros), on the Viking Vili from Amsterdam to Budapest, and a restaurant in Palm Springs called Miros.  

The salad was colorful, but taste was unremarkable, needed more dressing.  I like Olive Garden salad better.  

I felt the best thing about my dinner was the crusty bread.  I asked Brad to make my bread extra crispy.  I ended up having another bread order after I already got the check.  The olive oil and balsamic with the bread was soooo good, so was the butter.  

My water glass was filled each time I took a few sips (not by Brad), dirty dishes were taken away immediately (not by Brad), and my water, salad, bread were brought to me almost as soon as I sat down.  I give service 5 stars, Brad is so nice and pleasant, and the lady who poured the water was so attentive.  

I also liked that I could smell the fresh flowers by my table as I sat there, but I don't think I'll be back to try something else, because the food is expensive, and restaurant is not that close to my house.."}
{"text":"Right off the 51 at Shea, this restaurant is a hidden gem. I have visited so many Italian places for Chicken Marsala and have been disappointed. Michelina's has great ambiance, service and food. My friend had a wonderful filet dish with a flavorful mushroom sauce and I had the Marsala. Both were scrumptious. Even the bread and house salad were good. My highest compliments to the owner of this establishment."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. The service is top notch!  My water glass never empty. I had the green lipped muscles in white sauce for an appetizer. It was absolutely delicious!  My mom ordered the bruschetta. It was also delicious. I ordered the special veal osobucco, which was also scrumptious. Mom ordered the angel hair pasta with grilled chicken. She said it was delicious. I will definitely be back to try more menu items. 

I highly recommend reservations. It fills up fast!  You can useYelp to make reservations. An hour before our reservation I received a text asking to confirm or cancel. Very convenient."}
{"text":"Correcting some gross Misconceptions on Yelp regarding Michelina's.... PART 1

   My review will be overwhelmingly thorough, to aid others I will post in a 'bullet point' format for ease of reference (I have enjoyed this restaurant approximately 10 times in the last year (I am a foodie what can I say)...

History- Michelina immigrated approximately 29 years ago and opened her wonderful \"Ristorante\"(more on what this means later) and blessed Phoenix approximately 27 years ago...

Food- Excellent! Italian food from the area of NAPLES (this is where Michelina is from)... Food from this region is a blend, \"Campania is one of the largest producers and consumers of pasta in Italy, especially spaghetti. In the regional cuisine, pasta is prepared in various styles that can feature tomato sauce, cheese, clams and shellfish.(Wikipedia)\" PUTNESCA IS A POPULAR SAUCE from Naples...

Recommendations for food: One SHOULD attempt to incorporate seafood/shellfish as a choice; however, Michelina's has many excellent 'Turf' options (osso bucco, veal, eggplant, etc...)...

Appetizers: Escargots (dip the bread for garlic and butter lovers, this is the best)

Oysters Michelina-fantastic

SALAD IS OFFERED COMPLIMENTARY (FYI)

The bread is exquisite (with butter how its meant to be churned)

Entrees:
Surf: Many fresh fish specials usually served ala Putnesca (fantastic)
Turf: Osso Bucco (frequent special, this meat will fall off the shank and is incredibly tender, flavorful, and moist), Veal Saltimbucco, Veal Piccata


Dessert-  zabaione (with fresh berries) by far the best!!!!
Tiramasu- not bad but do yourself a favor and get the Zabione

A complimentary cordial is provided (fyi)

REAL ITALIAN MASCULINE COFFEE (go espresso or Cappuccino and you will be pleased (don't expect fu fu starbucks)


Dining EXPERIENCE- In Italy one enjoys the 'TABLE' for the evening (i.e. it is not a rushed affair, rather something to be savored and relished in)....(Notice it is an Italian named Restaurant (not Michelina's Restaurant) but rather \"Michelina's Ristorante Costa Campagnia\" which means, \"Michelina's [exquisite/higher end] Italian restaurant featuring food from Campagnia\".... 

Service- Brad is a wonderful and exceptional server... Request him if possible... Additionally, as inferred from \"Dining Experience\" above, this is an Experience to be savored... IF YOU HAVE TIME CONSTRAINTS, IMMEDIATELY INFORM BRAD, they will be accommodated (i.e. opera, symphony, movie, or just want a wonderful meal at a heightened pace).... The service WILL NOT HOVER over you as an American Restaurant will!!!!!! The exceptional service staff wants you to enjoy and relish the evening, as is done in Italy...

Ambiance- The restaurant is classically subtle and expresses the 'family and regional' values of Michelina's experiences in Naples as a young woman.... Some may call it dated, others may suggest classically influenced, and yet those that appreciate the Italian cuisine and experience might suggest that it is \"Old School\" in a \"Marlon Brando\"-esque way... For those of you unfamiliar with Marlon, Michelina's IS HOW A NAPLES RESTAURANT IS?WAS?AND SHOULD ALWAYS BE....

TO CORRECT SOME GROSS MISCONCEPTIONS OF OTHERS I WILL ADDRESS them below...

           \"There is nothing eye catching about the business front at all.  It's in a strip mall and looks old.  At night, they turn on strands of tacky Christmas lights that only attract attention to the fact that the lights are so poorly hung.\"

- The restaurant is 'Unassuming' from the outside, this is a treasure, not to be shared with just anyone... It also looks old because it is, she has been in this location for 20+ years....

\"When we arrived for dinner we were greeted by an empty corridor, no host station and no host.  We could see what looked to be a bar but it wasn't a bar that I'd want to eat, drink and socialize at.\"

-Michelina's is not a bar, they have excellent drinks however. Additionally, Michelina's is family run AND the expectation (once you have been their more than once) is to walk in and introduce yourself to Brad or Michelina's son (as you will become friends to dine with)....

\"To pass the time until we were finally greeted we browsed the many framed publications touting how incredible the place was.  I'm already here...I don't need any more persuasion.  It's time for the Chef/owner to take down the \"look how good I was\" trophy wall and go with a more inviting modern look.\"

-See Ambiance section above... Michelina is a remarkable woman and created this restaurant from LITERALLY NOTHING 27 years ago... She has won best Italian in AZ/Phx many times and would continue to win (however the same restaurant winning does not sell reviews/publications)...

...To be continued.."}
