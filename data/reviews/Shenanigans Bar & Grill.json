{"text":"This place has a divey atmosphere and the bartenders are friendly. Their traditional hot wings are good."}
{"text":"Cassi on night shift was really great! So helpful. Knew a lot of new drinks! So nice. Will come back because of her. Prices are great. Great happy hour!"}
{"text":"This is an area of town with old strip malls on one side of the street and car dealerships on the other. Shenanigans is attached to a Big O Tires. It is frequented by locals , is a dark, well worn bar. It has more tables and even pinball machines upstairs. I think the owner of Big O was in there. They specialize with their chicken wings but I had a burger and a beer. The burger was hot and the beer was cold, nuff said. These travelin' shoes would return."}
{"text":"I guess Im a \"Regular\" lol - Free Poker and  no the poker is not rigged otherwise Id win more :) But its about socializing for me rather than the big win. Been going for a few years now. People that go there are friendly and its a great place to learn the game :) Bands and Karaoke. Great Neighborhood Bar :)"}
{"text":"Always have a great time here. Poker a few days a week and karaoke some days with great specials.  This had been a go to hang out for me over the last 3 years.  Owners are great and I have been told the all of food is good but I have only had wings and they are great. Prices can't be beat. The only things missing are UFC and live bands."}
{"text":"This is the absolute best Packer bar in Phoenix.    Game day specials and entertainment to go along with every Packer game.  There is even a DJ calling out games/trivia/contests and playing Packer music instead of commercials.  Staff is super attentive, food decent and the management is awesome to work with.  Check out the game here and you will never go to another bar.   Best Packer bar I have found outside of Wisconsin."}
{"text":"We, my boyfriend & I, enjoy trying the different local bars. After settling into our new place having just moved to Az, this was the first place we tried. We went in on a Thursday night. Not exceptionally busy. The place was clean & the girl behind the bar was very nice. She went on to give us a little more info on bands that come in, etc, etc.  We plan to eventually make our way back there."}
{"text":"This is an awesome dive bar!  My wife and I accidentally stumbled into this place.  I found it on yelp and thought it was long shot because the reviews weren't good.  I put the address into my gps and I couldn't find it. It's in the parking lot of this auto repair place... what?  The sign is big, but it wasn't lit up so I missed it.  But, This place is so legit and unique.  Free poker buy-ins?  25cent wings on wing night?? Happy hour specials almost all day long? They should rename this place \"happy hour.\" I ordered the burger and it was pleasant.  The beer selection is just okay except the amber bock is a nice surprise. I wouldn't complain if they got a few ipa's on tap.  The atmosphere is super chill. The bartender was this crazy chick who ran the entire bar by herself. She is the cook/bartender/server/bus girl/manager/etc.  I think her name was Katie. She's a hero and too nice.  She knew the answer to every question we had. She should be on jeopardy.  I love this bar.  I will be a regular here for sure."}
{"text":"Havent been here since 1996, looks alot different inside. Still smells like sweaty Raiders fans as it at one time was a Raiders bar. Very quiet on a Sat. afternoon. Burger was good, service with a smile."}
{"text":"This place has been here for EVERRRR It's behind the Big O Tires in the same parking lot as a bunch of car shops. This was the original \"Raider\" bar of N. PHX. for over 10 years I guess its under new ownership now and the new owner ousted the Raider Club. Ouch this place used to be packed!! I haven't been here in awhile, well since I had a kegerator and with these bad times I found myself here again last night for a bit while the Fiesta Bowl was on. You would think with sports on that people would be here but the parking lot was pretty empty. It was about 8-ish and the bar was quite bare with only a handful of patrons sitting at the bar possibly just for the barbie bartender behind the counter in a tight corset. It was just my brother and I but we didnt get greeted upon entering or feel welcome so much. They only had Bud, Bud Light and Amber Bock on tap and what looked like a decent selection of bottled beer. The staff wasn't overly friendly or attentive to us with my brother practically having to beg to buy another round.  The atmosphere was just pretty blah all around. The projection screen looks to be the same old one and is in dyer need of being replaced. The flat screens above the bar are nice but thats about it. One more good note looks like they put in a smoking patio that seems new and some fresh paint outside to green and white. Used to be Silver & Black I guess this place really wants to set itself apart from those crazy Raider fans.   I didnt make it upstairs  to have a look around (they used to have pool tables) but most of the furniture looked to be the same nothing special or new. This used to be such a great place full of energy and happy people. We left feeling neglected and spent the rest of our money on scratcher tickets at the liquor store where they like us. I don't want to believe this bar is THAT bad so I plan on returning on a busier night, to give it another go and hopefully update with more stars??"}
{"text":"Day bartender is extremely rude!! No beer selection. Its very interesting that they have the show 'Bar Rescue\" advertised all over the bar, this bar could sure use the help, however I'm sure John Taffer would fire most of the staff! Don't think ill be going back anytime soon!"}
{"text":"This place isn't quite a full-fledge dive but it can smell funny, their beer selection is basically bud light on draft and whatever dusty bottle of domestic you want. They offer a menu with what they say is food... its basically deep fried whatever. They do have Karaoke, Pub Poker (pays $50 cash, I managed to win last time i was there and it was a nice surprise to leave the bar with more cash than i came in with.) and they have colorful collection of waitresses. They only have 2 pool tables and their bathrooms are small and awkward."}
{"text":"This is a tough one for me. I hate to review based off a short visit.   Here goes.  I messaged the new owners to see if they were serving real \"coke\" for a mixer yet because the last time I was there it tasted horrible. She said it was RC COLA  OK cool. We hear they have Karaoke and decide Saturday 4-18-15 would be a good time to check it out. We arrived around 830pm. There was 3 guys at the bar and the bar tender. We both went right into the restrooms before sitting down. THE MENS ROOM IS FILTHY AND GROSS, NEEDS A CLEANING FROM TOP TO BOTTOM AND A GOOD COAT OF PAINT.   I walk out just in time to see a tall slender black man (I only bring up race to assist in identifying) exit the WOMENS restroom, where my wife is, I was dumbfounded, I look around to see if she was in the bar and look to be sure she was in the right restroom.   She came out with the same WTF look on her face. We exchange a few seconds of dialog while walking into the seating side... look at each other, and NOW that we should just leave.   We walked out 4 min after being in there... laughing at the train wreck that just happened.   I doubt we would go back, not until they get cleaning and get real mixers."}
{"text":"I started going to this place because my girlfriend's court classes were a stone's throw away. The drinks are fairly cheap Thurs-Sun because of $3 you-call-it's. They also have like a Wednesday poker night. Well, I never went for the poker because it seems that this place is small to medium size and so the poker tables seem cluttered, I do like it for the cheap booze.   After my girlfriend's class, we would usually come here for a few drinks with a group of ladies from her group. They've got a full bar and the bartender Cassie is pretty nice and fast at serving. The mixed drinks were pretty decent and once in a while they have jello shots and they're priced cheaply. The food turn around time is not bad. I've only gotten food a couple of times here and the prices were alright. They could've been cheaper but well, still alright priced and it's bar food. I wasn't expecting Blue Fin or Olive Garden at the least. The food itself was alright. Wasn't burnt or overly greasy and it filled.   The decor is, well, a bar. But this is a neighborhood corner bar. If you were seeking to go somewhere upscale, you would've went to Old Town anyways. Because of the cheap drinks, this place I could probably see myself crawling out of or being carried away by friends. I would recommend if I was in the area or if friends were looking for a cheap boozing adventure. Wish it was a little closer but while my girl was taking classes, it was quite convenient and well worth the trip."}
{"text":"Been here about 2-3 times back in 2002.   The bartenders/servers all had breast implants and were fake as hell! And not very nice either.   The last time I went in, there was this bartender with short blondish-brownish hair named Mickey (or Nikki, I don't remember). She had fake boobs that look like she could be in the porn industry (they were like a H cup or something). She had the worst attitude I had ever seen in a bar. I was dating this guy and he kept his attention at her the entire time. I left the bar, after I stuck the finger at her, and walked home. He came and got me and said he was sorry. I stayed with him for another 3 months and left his butt after.   The atmosphere was very boring (all the men were breasts fanatics only). The drinks were too expensive for my taste. Just not a good place. I don't know about these days, but in 2002, it was horrible. And if you're a female patron, you find that the bartenders are going to want to compete against you on who is more gorgeous. That's what it felt like to me at the time."}
{"text":"Have had rude bartenders yep I love to ignore you unless the place is dead, expensive drinks and a really weird vibe on top of really crappy pool tables.  I have given this bar multiple chances since I used to live so close to it but was always unsatisfied and it seemed that for two drinks it was over 25 bucks.   The only plus size is that their food is pretty good (plus good price of wings)have amazing outdoor patio and they have karaoke."}
{"text":"Alright, so my other half and I had a gift certificate that we attempted to use for dinner here on take out, but apparently it was only for dine-in. Regardless, I decided to reluctantly pay the full $25.00 for the meal, which was supposed to include (2) 1/2 order of wings (6 wings) with fries, and (2) 1/2 orders of just wings. Without fries, it would be $5.25; with fries, it would be  .50 cents more, making it $5.75.  The total should have been $22, instead it was $25.00 flat. Paid with a card & gave a $1.00 tip.  I gave them the benefit of a doubt and added tax of $3, but as I was waiting for the food to arrive, the bartender came over and barked that they didn't charge me for the side of fries; and that it would be $1 more. By this point, after waiting approximately 15 minutes I told her to not worry about it.   Finally after getting home with the food, and noticed for the amount I paid, the food was mediocre, quite bland and a bit over-cooked. I was charged $30.00 for Shenanigans, don't remember making that $1 into a $4 by any means. I am contacting my bank tomorrow to get this corrected. I can usually tolerate establishment's faults; but this one is just downright fraudulent. Never will i be giving this dive-hole my time again."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times, usually for happy hour drinks and some food. This place is pretty cool tucked away in a little auto strip mall it's a nice change of pace"}
{"text":"Great local spot with great service I was greeted with a friendly staff. Bartenders  Andy and Lauren were amazing they made sure my glass was always full, what more could you ask for."}
{"text":"If you want to have a good time, this is the place. The staff is always friendly, the live bands or DJ is fun. Plus you can play poker and win some cash."}
{"text":"This is another one of those places that has been here as long as I can remember.  The staff is always friendly and the drinks are inexpensive.  Tipical bar food not too exciting.  Good place to come hang out while getting your car serviced next door.  Plan on making this place a more regular stop for refreshments :)"}
{"text":"The place was a great hang-out bar. Nice people, casual, layed-back atmosphere. Bartender was nice. Service was a little slow. But, there were nice people to talk to while we waited. I will definitely return to this lovely dive bar."}
{"text":"I just checked out this bar after I was here 6 months ago. Apparently it's under new management. I met the new owner who was very inviting and nice to talk to. The bartender was very sweet and totally on top of my beer drinking needs. It's only a mile away from  my house to that was a plus. They have a patio where you can smoke and a great jukebox. The crowd is friendly and hot bartenders are a plus. Not bad for a Wednesday."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE this neighborhood bar.  It is perfect for hanging out with friends over drinks... The food and drinks are reasonably priced (cheaper than most places), the staff remembers your name and you can play the jukebox from a smartphone app (no more standing in line with dollars).  In addition, they highlight some great bands and have poker games, everyday. BONUS: pool table and darts.  I've been a patron for over 13 years and drive in from Anthem just for their warm service."}
{"text":"NEW OWNER AS OF 3/1/15!! OLD REVIEWS ARE NULL AND VOID!!  (No I don't work for them. Just love a fair review of an awesome bar.)  That said, this place has turned around from the days of old. The new owner greeted my group of 5 and readily accommodated us wherever we wanted to sit on a Tuesday evening. The place is tucked away inconspicuously behind a tire shop and was a little light on customers but has so much potential.  Very clean appearance, 2 stories, a bar on each floor, 4 pool tables, 2 dart boards, outdoor seating, stage for music, poker on the weekends...lots going on at Shenanigans. Plus there is a pole on one end of the bar (for dance or flare, I don't know) and what looks like monkey bars above the remainder of the main floor bar. Didn't figure all that out.  The service was great! Super friendly bartender working well with her team of what looks like only two cooks and the owner for that night. They did great though. So much so that they had time to make sure all guests were happy and got a chance to mingle a bit too. I like feeling that the crew care about the guests and are interested in actually talking to you, not just trolling for tips.   For not having a really diverse menu, they do great. We ordered a bunch of appetizers for variety. Tacos were really good, same with the wings and fried zucchini. Garlic bread was delicious and plenty big for the small price. EVERYTHING was priced well and there are amazing specials each day. We almost had an order mix up which the owner was on top of calmly and graciously within seconds. Turned out to be my dumb fault but the staff was all about making it right and quickly. SUPER IMPORTANT.   I will DEFINITELY be back. For poker, drinks, pool, the whole lot of it. I'm excited to see all the fun that can be had there!    I wonder if they'd sponsor a softball team...hmm"}
{"text":"All the food offered sucks balls (except the heaping mound of french fries for like $2 that the cook fries up quite well), and the owner guy is a TOOL, the kind of jerk that thinks it's okay to banter in a talking-shit/put-down kind of manner with a complete stranger as if they were a long time friend.  Fake friendly doesn't cut it in the service industry."}
{"text":"I'm curious what this building used to be beore it was Shenanigans.  It's in an auto complex, so I assume some kind of garage or auto parts store.  It is a larger building, with a big upstairs.  The layout is a little strange for a place like this, which again makes me think it used to be something else.  I just stopped in here briefly to check it out, but it looks like it has potential.  I'll have to try again when they have karaoke or something."}
