{"text":"Great food, and amazing service! We had catering from Casa Grecque for an event, and the food was exceptional and was very well received.  We tried the souvlaki, which was very tasty and comes with a large portion of rice and potatoes. Definitely check it out if you're in the Plateau area!"}
{"text":"I spent years of my life in Greece. I learnt to cook authentic Greek food. I eat, obviously, real Greek food and when it comes about Greek food...I am home :)  Leaving my absolute modesty aside, I was very disappointed by Casa Greque. No authenticity at all! Even the tzatziki was a hybrid of what I know, not to mention simple dishes like Greek salad and souvlaki that were not even close to the real ones. Spanakopita was ok, but I sensed a lack of ingredients in it. I understand that you must adapt to the tastes of the customers, but I am sure that everyone, no matter the origin, would appreciate much more the real flavours of Greece. The place didn't make me say OPA, but whatever..."}
{"text":"It was a good restaurant, we had fun. But our waiter was really rude and not helpful. But still had fun with my friends"}
{"text":"This was by far the worst Greek restaurant I've ever been too. To begin with, our server was rude, patronizing, and lazy. He didn't bring us anything to drink until we flagged him down and asked him for water. Then after we ordered our meal, Calamari, Steak and Chicken with a coffee, it didn't come! I waited an hour and a half for a damn coffee and my meal. You may think I should have simply flagged the man down again? I would have if that pretty boy with the greasy goatee had even showed up to see his tables, but nooooo, that would have been doing his job. Eventually I gave up on that moron and got the other servers attention. He brought our food, my coffee, and  it only took him 1 minute. Which tells you right there that the food had been under a heat lamp for awhile and our previous server was as I mentioned before, a bloody moron. The food was mediocre at best and I have no idea what the hell they did to the Calamari. Last time I checked it should be battered. It looked, smelled, and tasted like chunks of rubber.  So finally, two hours later. After dealing with this unpleasant individual. He has to gall to ask me how much I want to tip, 10, 15 or 20 percent. I took the damn machine from him and tipped him what he deserved........$1.50. NEVER AGAIN!!"}
{"text":"Nous sommes allés en groupe(11 personnes) et nous avons eu une bonne attention, les serveurs ont été super gentils,  nous avons eu un dessert pour l'anniversaire de notre ami. Nous avons eu du fun. Je le recommande! J'ai adoré la grillade pour deux"}
{"text":"It's a chain BYOB Greek restaurant. Is it authentic? It's as authentically Greek as Yoplait Greek Yogurt. It's okay if you are in the neighbourhood and your friends think that Greek food is exotic. And seriously folks, why is there Italian food on the menu?"}
{"text":"Wow! talk about value. I've enjoyed eating at the Casa Grecque on Prince Arthur, but this D.D.O. location is in a league all it's own. Both I & mom took lunch specials, being used to the portions at  Prince Arthur, I order the tzatziki side dish. We started with a super fresh and tasty salad bar, which in itself could be a meal as it had peel shrimp, calamari, feta cheese, hummus, and though not the most extensive, everything was fresh and well-prepared. The wheat bread rolls were served hot, the plates arrived within 5 minutes, the service was attentive but not sticky. We ate and ate until we could no longer. I bagged and brought home 1/3 of the food. While the coffee and dessert where nothing to write home about they were more than passable.  What's deceptive is looking at the front of the restaurant you can't tell if it's open. Upon approaching the front door we notice it was propped open. When I asked a server where the bathroom was he said it was under reno & I would have to go to the 3rd floor events room next to the Jacuzzi - I replied can I use the Jacuzzi too? We'll definitely be back. The parking situation downtown is what keeps us from frequenting the Prince Arthur location but here there's loads of parking but we have a fair drive to get to it but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Quand on va à la Casa Grecque, c'est pour manger une assiette monstrueuse pour peu cher.  Ce que je veux dire, c'est que c'est pas la qualité qui prime dans les assiettes, disons-le comme ça. Le menu s'étale de crevettes (gratinées à l'ail) au steak 20 onces,  ou bien de poulet, le tout accompagné de riz, ou de patates frites. L'avantage ici, c'est qu'on peut apporter notre vin. C'est la raison principale d'aller manger-là. (pis un peu pour les crevettes papillons aussi)"}
{"text":"I was invited to a birthday at this restaurant and we had about 6 couples with us. The server only came by twice: to ask what we wanted to eat and to bring us food.   The guy was clearly confused with the order and most people ended up with someone else's order. The server was expressionless and robotic but at least he wasn't rude. Only one couple could speak French and the server responded in French even when they spoke English to him.   The food is quite overpriced for the size of the portion however it tasted alright."}
{"text":"Decent diner style food with a little Greek touch (not an authentic Greek place). If you're someone who loves a bang for your bucks then this is a must try, HUGE portion that leave you super full. Items are around $23-$27 but comes plateful. I took grilled Atlantic salmon with skewered shrimp. The salmon was slightly over cooked but I enjoyed it nonetheless, you can barely go wrong with salmon; also came with beautiful lemon butter sauce on the side. What I really loved was the seafood casserole appetizer, really cheesy and creamy and goes so good with seafood, served hot and straight out of the oven. I might go back just for the casserole. Generally a safe bet if you're entertaining a large group because it's a type of place that can cater to a variety of tastes."}
{"text":"I much prefer Arahova, the menu is tired and boring, the soups and creams from Cans diluted in water no thanks and the garden salad sucks that's why we must always pay extra for Caesar and the desserts suck but better this than junk food I guess"}
{"text":"I love the place, food is delicious, great ambiance, friendly staff, bring your own wine and great view."}
{"text":"This is the kind of place that makes me think of my childhood when my parents would bring us to, thinking it was some fancy, fantastic place. But once I've traveled and seen and tasted different things and also eaten for 2 weeks in a lot of restaurants in Greece...then, I come back here after decades absent and I see clearly that this is but a McDonald's disguised as a Greek restaurant.  Bring your own wine is a sign of cheapness. From both the owners and clientele.  Their dinner specials (after 4pm) are accompanied with some nasty old coffee served in dirty crusty cups, with disgusting mid 70s style desserts.  The meal specials are all much smaller in portion than their regular menu items.  The kind of restaurant that have way too many menu items and nothing that stands out in taste or presentation.  Very old and bland. Perfect for your grumpy old friends.  Salad bar is small and really not worth it, have these people heard of kale or spinach? Iceberg lettuce!  Remember bread buns sealed in plastic bags served with frozen butter?   Like time stood still.  McDonald's a la Greek!  I have (had to) come here way to many times over the years and have come out thinking the same thing; never again.  One waiter left a broken wine glass on the floor in front of our table for the entire time of our meal! I had to tell the clueless manager who had walked by several times, crushing the glass under his feet, for him to do something.  The waiters here seem to be so fed up of working here, maybe they wanted to trip on it and get early retirement?  Terrible food, terrible service with no warmth. Actually, most McDonald's are better than this now.  There is a huge reception area upstairs, they should move the restaurant there, much nicer.  Sad and depressing."}
{"text":"J'avoue, en matière de bouffe, je suis plutôt exigeante. Mais c'est comme ça : quand je sors au resto, je m'attends au grand jeu! J'aime imaginer que je vais goûter quelque chose que je n'aurai pas été capable de faire moi-même ou alors auquel je n'aurai pas pensé. J'aime être surprise et agréablement de préférence. Et c'est justement ce qui me manque à la Casa Grecque. En soi, je n'ai rien à vraiment reprocher : la nourriture n'est pas mauvaise, le service n'est pas désagréable, le cadre n'est pas affreux, le menu n'est pas cher. Non, vraiment, ce n'est pas mal du tout. Ça peut même être une très bonne solution pour les soirs où vous aurez la flemme de vous mettre derrière les fourneaux, ou même pour un repas de groupe pas trop cher. Bref, pas vraiment de point négatif pour la Casa, si ce n'est que quand je sors dans un resto, j'aime y aller pour les qualités qu'il a plutôt que pour les défauts qu'il n'a pas.  Quand je vous disais que j'étais exigeante..."}
{"text":"We visited Casa Grecque tonight.  Been awhile since we have been to the area.  Food was great and reasonably priced with good portions.  Service was friendly and attentive.  We will be back."}
{"text":"very comfortable and warming setting.. The food is good and very big portions so that you can have leftovers the next day for your lunch... I recommand the shrimps"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but everything we had was lackluster and inauthentic. We had the pikilia plate and a large order of calamari. The calamari was very salty and a bit rubbery. The feta and olives were so salty that it's obvious they skip the step of soaking them in water to take some of the saltiness away (what most Greeks traditionally do). The salmon on the pikilia plate was not fresh. The spanakopita was just okay. The tzatziki was okay and the taramosalata was very paste-like. The prices were good but the food wasn't. We found out after that this place is a chain so if you want half way authentic Greek food, avoid this place. Our waiter was nice and our water was constantly refilled but that was the only good thing about the place."}
{"text":"My preferred spot always with my bottle of wine and a good meal to share. Nice music and excellent service. I always come to casa grecque especially in winter. It reminds me of old days staying by the Mediterranean Sea and eating fresh seafood.  I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Ver very bad experience. I work in the restaurant industry, hence I am more understanding to factors such as slow service etc. However, this place was so bad that I am writing the review right now sitting here. I just ate the very salty calamari and waited long time for the entree. We were already standing close to the door and would just want to pay because we did not get our food yet for a long time. Then our waiter has the food on his hands and went to us. So we just sat back and my friends ate. I had lost appetite so i did not eat the entree. Whenever I'm in a resto im observant, so i know that there was a couple that came in after us, then a big group. The couple already had their entree way before we got our. And the big group are getting all their entrees when we were at the door."}
{"text":"We were looking to grab dinner and one of my guests remembered this place favorably from her youth. We ordered there 11$ special. 1 chicken brochette, 1 cheese cannelloni  and 1 calamari dinner. Brochette was ok but a bit tasteless, cheese cannelloni was meh and the calamari was passable. The rice was awful. Can't recommend it."}
{"text":"Casa Grecque is an interesting place to visit with family. This isn't a date type place. It is considered a type of \"fast food\" Greek restaurant. The food is good, the portions could be a little bigger. Don't forget it is a BYOB.   The layout of the restaurant is a little weird. There is an upstairs where you will sweat it out during winter, and it feels like you need room to breath.   Over all nothing everything is good on the menu, avoid mixing different kinds of meat because you will regret it later. The Greek salad is enough for a meal, so stick with the salad that comes with you meal.  Waiters are not so professional, many are young college students working to pay off school, so you gotta be patient."}
{"text":"Very well made spankopita here; the seafood casserole was ok. The salad was delicious. Nice ambiance."}
{"text":"I am really impressed that this place was so packed on a Sunday afternoon. I hadn't been to a casa grecque in ages; it never really stood out in my mind as a great place to eat because the food, from what I remember, was always your typical hearty-grained rice and a grilled meat. They haven't deviated from that.   The menu is light and offers ~five variations of the same protein with your standard rice ball and deep fried potato slice. My protein, the grilled chicken, was pretty plain and had nothing distinct about it. The rice was on the greasy side. And the potatoes were dry, merciless potatoes that were begging for moisture and add-ons. My family's dinner was very similar. Included in the meal was a celery soup and house salad, both of which were fine.   Here's what bugs me: the same meal we had for lunch (at 2pm) at regular price was being offered for considerably less had we dined there after 4pm.   Our reservation was for 2 and we only got seated at 230, despite larger groups coming in after us and getting seated. On the other hand, we were seated in a pretty private booth which was nice as we had two birthdays to celebrate.   The maitre'd/owner/host was flat out rude to some guests. He asked a father of a group of five if they could leave before 315 (giving them about an hour to order and eat) and the father responded that he didn't want to be given conditions for eating at a restaurant when had reservations. The host looked visibly annoyed at this man and started pacing around him while saying multiple times \"I'm just gonna keep my mouth shut.\" Are you kidding me? The father played it remarkably cool and ended up getting a condition-free table.   I also despised how the host was talking to the employees who were seating customers and answering phones-- he had zero respect, zero diplomacy. If I had to base my review on what I saw and not what I ate, this review would be one star.    Could I ever recommend this place for its food and service? Not in a million years."}
{"text":"Seule un samedi soir, n'ayant pas très envie de chausser d'interminables  talons et revêtir des paillettes, je suis partie explorer la rue Prince-Arthur, non loin de chez-moi. Je me suis alors dit que ce resto ferait l'affaire: sans prétention, menu pas compliqué la zone de confort culinaire, quoi! Mon Dieu! Cauchemar culinaire! Les crevettes à l'ail gratinées: des crevettes en boite (minuscules) trempant dans une mixture blanchâtre sous de la mozza. Fort goût de poisson longtemps congelé. Je passe... Plat principal: un steak. Ordinaire, qui a cuit sur le grill. Accompagnement: une salade César qui baignait depuis quelques heures dans la vinaigrette. Du riz fade, des pommes de terres \"grecques\" réchauffées au micro-ondes. Les calmars que j'ai pris pour emporter à chéri étaient très coriaces et avaient ce goût de poisson longuement congelé. Après tout ça, on se dit qu'on a droit à un petit dessert. Ouais... le gâteau n'était pas du jour, c'est sûr! Voilà pour la \"belle\" expérience."}
{"text":"J'ai pas aimé du tout les plats sont très gras beaucoup d'huiles , j'avais pris le plat à la carte c'était au saumon on avait avec la soupe ou la salade j'avais pris la soupe aux légumes bof bof mais très déçu par le plat principal. J'avais même pas pris de désert car j'étais écurée.par contre le service était excellent rien à dire . C'était un apportez votre vin"}
{"text":"I had the only vegetarian dish in the restaurant which was tomato cheese cannelloni  and it tasted really good. It's BYOW! I went with my friends and they said even the other dishes they had was good."}
{"text":"Worst service ever, I made a reservation on Saturday at 7:30 pm and I arrived on time to know that there was no places to sit, It was my nephew's birthday. First they offered us a partial bench then they asked us to wait. We had leave because nobody seemed to care. Never go there again. I should have listened to the reviews before deciding to go there."}
{"text":"The food was delivered and looked exactly like the menu. Very tasty large servings heavenly shrimp and potato. You go across the walkway to the liquor store to buy wine or beer with no corkage at the restaurant. They provide wine glasses. Great service!"}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE: The interior is quite nice actually. It offers a classic vibe. I often see people come here in very casual clothing so no need to get dressed up. It's not as fancy as you think it is.  FOOD: Not the greatest whatsoever. I found that the food was very bland and dry, especially the chicken. Definitely lacked flavor. However, I do find that the salad bar is a nice touch to this restaurant. The quality was slightly lacking in my opinion. I definitely think you can find better restaurants in the area.  PRICE: Prices are decent. It's pretty much the same price range as the other Greek restaurants in the area. Although it's not worth it in terms of price-to-quality ratio.  SERVICE: Service was okay, the waiters did what they had to do. Nothing more or less."}
{"text":"My family and I are pretty much regulars of this place. One of the only Casa Grecques I know of that has a salad bar included in their meals. Friendly staff, good food, and bring your own wine makes for a very enjoyable evening."}
{"text":"Worthless place, don't go there.  I have been to this place twice - in 2010 and 2011 - first time by an accident, and second time by an error. Both times the experience was miserable.  What you get for your money is a smallish portion of some ridiculously overpriced food, prepared to the Swiss Chalet level of \"quality\". Whatever should be fried would be burned, and whatever should be cooked would be bland. Plus tons of salt.  Menu looks like it was stolen from a rathole bum-eatery on the corner, the servers are more or less polite, but will only notice you after you'll wave your hands and yell or break something. Oh, and don't expect your drinks to arrive before you'll get your food. If you can't wait, wave to the server - frantically.  The only funny thing about Casa Grecque is that there is no boose inside, except for the beer. Want wine? Bring it in, that's what menu suggests."}
