{"text":"Dined here after experiencing the fremont street.. Food was awesome.. one of the best chinese foods around. Service could have been a tad better as the server didn't understand much English, nor was he able to talk himself.

All in all, great if you are looking for seriously good asian food."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good
But I was also only craving vegetables and tofu. I had to ask about the tofu and pay extra for it, but it was well worth it in my opinion. 
After eating at the hotel cafe for 2 days it was nice to have an option. 
Service was decent and the place seemed pretty well run."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located near the pool at the Golden Nugget. Great environment we really enjoyed our Hot & sour soup and spicy tuna roll but the five star was the sake sashimi, they serve thick pieces that just melt in your mouth. (as I'm writing this my mouth is watering lol  )  Overall a fantastic place.  Cant wait to go again soon."}
{"text":"I'm not happy at all... Americanized terrible food all I gotta say is good luck... The dim lights don't hide the crappy food"}
{"text":"We were wandering Fremont Street with some out of town guests and decided on Firefly at the Plaza, only to find out it was closed. Yelp helped is find this alternative.

There are 2 distinct parts to this restaurant, the teppanyaki side and the restaurant side.  They really should warn you that if you want teppanyaki, you need to sit at the bar area.  And if you want to be able to hear the person next to you, you should sit as far away from the teppanyaki bar as you possibly can.  While I can appreciate coming and having a great time, the group at the teppanyaki bar was so loud and obnoxious, we couldn't even carry on a conversation with one another.

The food was okay, but for someone who has never been to china and is looking to try something new, the wait staff could not describe the food or how it was prepared (as bad as it sounds, it may have just been a language barrier. The wait staff was authentic and Asian, but we had some difficulty understanding what they were saying).  I ordered the Hong Kong Chow Mein.  In my personal taste, if this is what food tastes like in China, I don't ever want to go there.  The thick sauce was extremely salty, without much other flavor. It did have large pieces of white meat chicken and pork, which would have tasted great if the sauce wasn't so bad.

The price was average, but the food was below average. I am definitely willing to return and try the teppanyaki bar, as the energy and food produced on that side of the restaurant was definitely better than what I received."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of experiencing dining at Lillie's. My wife and I arrived for our reservation AT 5:30PM. We were seated at our teppanyaki table and promptly greeted by our wait person. He was at our side from the time we arrived to the time we departed. What wonderful service.

The dinner started with a bowl of hot mushroom soup. It was savory and had enough mushrooms to give it a wonderful texture. The next course was a simple salad with a very tasty ginger dressing. My wife said she would go back just to have the salad and dressing. Then the show began.

Our teppanyaki chef came to prepare our spectacular meal. My wife and I had a combination of Shrimp, Chicken, New York Strip Steak, and Fillet Mignon. Along with the main dishes came three delicious sauces as well as fresh grilled vegetables and steamed white rice. One sauce was a spicy mustard that went with the steak and chicken. Then was a seafood sauce and a spicy sauce that went with the red meat. All three sauces really awakened the taste buds. I really enjoyed the combination of the chicken and the spicy mustard sauce. What a taste treat. The taste was similar to Dijon mustard, but it did not assault the sinuses. My wife thought the combination of spicy sauce and white rice was enjoyable. Everything was prepared just as we asked for and the meats were oh so tender.

Our chef was a real joy. His jokes were very funny. His teppanyaki skills were well mastered. From the onion volcano to the flare in his knife skills my wife and I enjoyed the show. We have been to many teppanyaki restaurants through the years, but this has to be the best we have even been to.

The only reason my review does not get five stars is because of the price. The pricing is a bit high. Luckily we had a coupon when we went."}
{"text":"This place is great! I have ordered gen tsos chicken all around the country and this was far better than any I have ever had.  First of all it was actually spicy enough for me! I ordered it extra spicy and may have gotten in over my head...Even made me sweat a little. And every piece of chicken was cleaned well and cooked to perfection. No grizzle or battered dough messing it up.  The taste was wonderful.  The pad thai my wife ordered was excellent as well!  And the crab Rangoon appetizer was also extremely tasty.  Excellent service!! Water was always full. Waiter and manager checked in on us often to make sure everything was perfect.  Overall I can't give them enough kudos!"}
{"text":"We just returned from a few days at the Golden Nugget and ate here multiple times.  We loved the food and the service.  We absolutely hated the incredibly annoying music that blared obnoxious synthesized drums at us.  Had we not loved everything else, we would not have returned.  The waiters and floor manager said lots of people complain about the music but they're unable to correct it because the owner has a concept.  The concept must be to torture the diners while they're eating."}
{"text":"I really wanted those wonton chip things.... but the waiter said the cooks are pretty strict on those they're only served with a few dishes so they don't offer them by themselves.... so what did he do?!?!

HE TOLD THE COOKS THAT I WAS PREGNANT AND CRAVING THEM...SO THAT I COULD HAVE THEM!!! possibly the BEST waiter EVER!!!

and aside from that one point that made my night....the FOOD! omg the food! I ordered the teriyaki salmon... I still think about about that dinner every day. I mean salmon is one of those foods that could be easily messed up... and this was cooked to PERFECTION. best salmon i've eaten in my entire life, hands down. Huge portions too! The salmon was a huuuge piece, a gigantic amount of rice, and delicious string beans that had all these fabulous spices on them.

I wish I lived in Vegas so I could go to this place all the time."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible service.  Sat at the table for 10 minutes before the waiter even stopped by to take a drink order, and he was rude the entire evening. Same if not worse experience waiting to order food.  Food was not good.  Would not recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"We ate here twice during our visit to Las Vegas. The first time, we ordered spring rolls and marinated jelly fish followed by kalbi steak and roast duck. The spring rolls were ok, but the jellyfish was spectacular... a bit spicy, crunchy and gingery with a little vinegary kick that was addictive. The  kalbi steak was well-marinated and delicious and the roast duck was roasty, toasty, ducky goodness. We went back again after seeing a show and just had the marinated jellyfish (I wish I had a plate of it now) and wor wonton. You have to ask for the big bowl (entree sized) unless you want the small cup.  We both had this as an entree and it was packed with pork wontons, shrimp, cha shu pork and veggies. We would eat here again!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for good Asian authentic food? This is NOT the place. My husband and I ate here, it was probably one of the worse over priced Asian/Chinese food.  I was expecting the food to be really good especially for the price but it was very disappointing. I won't eat here again."}
{"text":"We stopped in Old Vegas one night to check it out. If you've never been to Old Vegas, I highly suggest stopping by.

We were starving and Lillie's was the first restaurant we stumbled across.  We love Hibachi and figured it couldn't be that bad.

Our food was fine, portions were on the smaller side and you were charged more for fried rice, which I found odd.  Most places I have been to include that in your hibachi meal.  Portions weren't huge and service was okay.  I'm not sure we'd go running back, but it wasn't awful either.

We also waited quite some time as they never turned the grill on, when the chef arrived to cook the grill was cold!"}
{"text":"This place is located inside the Golden Nugget in downtown Vegas. A lot of cheesy restaurants downtown but this one was nice and clean. Very small place. They also offer teppanyaki. The soup and salad that came with the meal was very good. Better than most. The chef was nice and did the normal teppanyaki tricks. Our main course was good. Nothing spectacular but good. We tried several alcoholic beverages and enjoyed them all. While this isn't a 5 star joint, it was very good. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Food came out cold. Not very spicy as advertised. The sprouts on my wife's dish  were old and not fresh."}
{"text":"Terrible service , terrible food. Dinner for 2 adults and a child was $120 and only one of us ordered a beverage. Our chef did no tricks, didn't season the food well, the food was bland and the New York steak tasted like a Denny's steak. The manager came over at the end to ask how everything was and when we answered honestly that it was a bit bland, in a nice way, he started getting upset with us. He said he wasn't sure why \"everyone was complaining \" and we should have told him sooner. Terrible customer service to boot. Avoid!!"}
{"text":"Food is good but way overpriced. Probably won't go back because it cost so much I would expect a lot more for that kind of money.  $160 for what we got was way too much."}
{"text":"Wife and I came in here after wandering around  downtown. We were looking for a restaurant we hadn't been to for our anniversary and decided to pick the first restaurant that looked good. So glad we chose this place. We told the host that it was our anniversary and he said that he will inform our waiter. We ordered crab rangoon, pad thai, and beef brisket with beef tendon noodle soup. Everything came out quickly but we didn't feel rushed at all. The portion sizes were huge and everything was flavorful. 

Toward the end of the meal our waiter presented us with a small cake dessert, compliments of the house, for our anniversary. The cake was equally as tasty and it was a nice gesture from them."}
{"text":"Don't bother.  The Chinese spinach was very good, the duck and peppered steak were not so good.  I had the peppered steak removed from my bill because it was so tough.  The plum sauce for the duck was weird and instead of a nice little duck breast, they just threw in whatever body parts that suited them.  Heed  the warnings if those who have posted negative reviews. Again, don't bother."}
{"text":"This is really amazing, best fried rice of my life and my partner loves the amazing noodles really good eating experience at night"}
{"text":"Had Pot sticker, egg tools and chicken satay. Very yummy. Going for Mongolian beef, and pork fried. It's sooo good"}
{"text":"OMG this place was bad.  The staff is friendly but un attentive and pushy.  The food is more expensive than other teppanyaki restaurants in town and the quality is awful!  I had the 45.00 3 item combo.  Plus the extra 4.00 for fried rice.  The new york steak was flavorless and very fatty.  The chef was almost comatose and barely going thru the motions.  The onions were still raw when served and the shrimp left a lot to be desired.  The Ginger sauce was pretty good as well as the chicken, and the manager came by often, but I still cannot recommend.
Stay away and try a local family owned restaurant like Osaka or Geisha instead."}
{"text":"My fiance and I ate dinner here last night. We saw a deal on Travelzoo for this place and decided to give it a try. The food was great and the service was really good also. We both had the Emperor's Feast and has Shrimp, Chicken, and Tenderloin. It all tasted really good but our favorite was the tenderloin. It was the most tender meat I've ever eaten. Along with the meat you also get soup, salad and veggies. Our meal was served to us at one of their teppanyaki  tables where they cook in front of you. The chef was very entertaining. Overall I'm glad we found this place and I wouldn't mind paying full price for this place. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Everything about this restaurant is great. From the classy ambiance, the attentive servers, friendly manager, the super entertaining chefs who cook your food right in front of you, to the delicious food they serve straight from the grill! The price of each meal is about $30 per person excluding drinks but the food servings are generous and the whole dining experience is wonderful! I highly recommend this restaurant whenever one is in Vegas. One can only stand a few buffets anyway."}
{"text":"Good if not a little pricey.  My son chose this place because they have Teppan Grill.  He is only 13 and an adventurous eater.  As Teppan goes, it is about what you expect.  As this is located inside the Golden Nugget, everyone is pretty happy and easy going.  Our table mates were delightful.  I will say we ate at the first sitting, 5pm. This review may not be applicable later in the evening and reservations were suggested for the teppan part as there is limited seating.  If you are going for the other foods, there is more space but this is still a restaurant on the small side for Vegas.  I would go again.  Cost $100 (tip included) for two teppan meals and a glass of wine."}
{"text":"Honestly, not the best Asian food you can get. Maybe because I'm from California??

We stopped here for dinner before getting our alcohol beverages. The restaurant looked nice and seemed busy so we figured we give it a try. We ordered the following to share;

 appetizer: crab ragoon / crab wonton. -- definitely did not taste the best nor did it taste like crab ragoon / crab wonton... Panda express has better cream cheese ragoon. We barely touched it, so the manager took it off our tab.

Entree #1: Chicken Pad Thai - flavorless. It had no taste, plain. Seemed like they cooked their noodles, threw it into the wok and added some sauce to it. The sauce did not stick to the noodles, the sauce sat at the bottom of the bowl.

Entree #2: Pork fried Rice - it was decent, but flavorless as well. We picked at it. How do you screw up pork fried rice??

Entree #3: Honey Glazed Shrimp - I think its supposed to taste like Honey Walnut Shrimp... It was OK. Not the best, just OK. 

Overall, we didn't finish our food. First and last time we will be eating here. Thanks for the experience. One star for the effort of trying to bring Asian Cuisine dishes to Vegas, and one star for our waiter, he was pleasant and continually checked on us."}
{"text":"The flavor and spices in the pad thai were good, but the dish overall was nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"We went here last night for dinner and it was wonderful. I highly recommend Kong for your teppan yaki experience. He is seriously the funniest guy I have ever met. He made our dinner so enjoyable last night and made us laugh the whole time. Food was also delicious."}
{"text":"So the food is good but it's not Benihana's. 
There are a few things that I feel you must have like chicken fried rice, garlic butter and a really good soup and salad. The salad was good, not great but good. It was kind of like a 1000 island - ginger dressing that we all ate. I notice that everyone at our table kind of passed on the soup. At first I thought I was the only one but literally everyone took a bite or two and pushed it away. I was disappointed with the fried rice. When you compare it to other restaurants it was very plain. Lots of white rice that did not get blended with the soy sauce and butter. Again, it wasn't very good. The service from the staff was great, the chef was very friendly but I think the menu needs an overhaul."}
{"text":"Food here is not good. We came here for the teppanyaki but was disappointed.. The fried rice was so bland and tasteless. The quality of the seafood and meat is mediocre at best. My hot and sour soup was more sour than anything. Our server was great but the food.. No. Sorry, needs a lot of improvement."}
{"text":"Average and nothing special...My party did the hibachi special and it was ok. The service was slow it took about 30 minutes to get my drink Apple Sake which was good but the dirty glass. I drank it because it alcohol right..lol. The food was plain and the cook could have been a little more entertaining. That is what hibachi is about being wowed and entertained. I should have tried the RED sushi place but at least they validated my parking."}
{"text":"We came here to celebrate my aunt and uncle's 60th wedding anniversary.  We decided to take them out to dinner and we were staying in downtown LV, we wanted to keep it close so everyone could walk to the restaurant.  Located in the Golden Nugget, the place is on the smaller side.  We made reservations so they could accommodate our party of 10 people.  We ordered several dishes to share family style.  The best dish we had was the Honey Chicken.  Very tasty and not real sweet as you'd expect.  I would definitely get that again.  The roasted duck was good as well.  The vegetables were very good.  Most of all it seemed our meal was MSG free.  

With all the great places to eat in Vegas, this was one of the better Chinese food places I have eaten at in a casino.  Most of the good places to eat Chinese food is in China town.  I would definitely try go back again."}
{"text":"I always get the same thing here because its consistently so good. I get the crispy honey shrimp and the broccoli beef with some pork fried rice. Shrimp is lightly coated and fried with a honey glaze. The broccoli is tender yet crisp, the beef has great flavor,  and the fried rice is just yummy. You can sit at a table or do the tepin grill. They have a different menu at the grill part i believe. Great casual dining."}
{"text":"With a late dinner reservation for our party of 15 to be seated around the grills, naturally everyone was quite hungry.  Service started off a little slow.  We got our soups right away, but none of the appetizers and only some drinks had come out by then.

Once food did arrive, it was actually better than I expected.  I enjoyed the variety of menu items and everything was flavorful.  It is always nice to have your food prepared hibachi style in front of you and our chef did a great job.  

I found prices to be reasonable and amount of food to be more than enough.  I really appreciate my food not being to salty which is my normal experience when I go eat this type of food."}
{"text":"Benihana wanna be

Soup was fishy 
Dressing was good on salad 
The veggies were over cooked and some were undercooked. Hard to fry broccoli
And sprouts at the same time.
Chicken was overcooked 
Scallops were good 

Service was good"}
{"text":"A beautiful kitchen with red.  Two chefs deal on food for customers against grills in such radiance where meat has gently been cooked until noise of steaming and perfection is heard throughout Lillie's Asian Cuisine.  Vegetables are combined from time to time when there's natural flavor between warm metal grills and echoes of the hissing mass either chef uses to impress witnesses of teppanyaki near counters under so much glow, presentation, and a healthy fusion of Chinese and Japanese influence at the little joint in the Golden Nugget where general exotic forms are pleasing to my favor on their cost and performance.  The door is shut after the stroke of twelve when it's important for the restaurant to leave its fortune on glowing red decorations and frames with an Asian style to defense and overall train of midnight across from the business desk close to Starbucks.  Meals are provided in style, complete detail, and good dishes which show true colors over beauty.  Spring and training are ahead for the creative kitchen with the promise of yearly fortune and privilege.  Human touch around the restaurant where drinkers of water and laughter gather by those glowing bars may serve as a reminder that the forms of things outside the joint and across from insiders get less static, less rigid because of the Asian kitchen's harmony or dramatic output of life.  I try to make sense of the environment before mileage leaves all casual mood in this soul of mine as high as LV's city lights (which are fantastic to the point of recognition).  Jellyfish noodles at Lillie's have been exaggerated on with my server in dinner talk yet make for an excellent, cold dessert before me and a couple of fellow tourists from our bus dig into a Cantonese noodle's foundation of egg, heat, and strings of texture.  Soy sauce drips if not pours in elegance over choice dishes through prominence we take near firm pictures hanging on the grey or black wall every one of us possess as eye candy although they're a great mythological influence for Fremont, 4th, and the Golden Nugget.  Wine shall be redeemed excellent under the lit and shadowy roof.  What's common for one patron in the restaurant might be a rare opportunity for some drifter around the corner ever after.  Chances are the perfect match among friends will remind such guys of ramen noodles with even more specialty involved while hotel guests sneak a peak through the hole in the wall to find marvelous food being enjoyed over wanderlust or actual spirits of demand.  On my radar, the restaurant's or kitchen's list is full of Asian wonders by all means through professional execution, busy crowds, lovely decorations, and dishes which take Lillie's risks of business to a whole new level of appetite- wine more costly than a noodle, brisk sips of water near teppanyaki at its cooking of a nice whiff."}
{"text":"This place wasn't to bad. I definitely wouldn't come back for the Sushi but the main dishes were pretty good. I had the sea bass and it went down pretty smooth. Pretty pricy place just for one person with drinks, I spent around $118.00 just for me with a desert.

The service isn't the best here, they make you feel rushed and the waitress seem like she wanted to be there at the same time.

I'd look else where if your looking to spend that kind of money"}
{"text":"Overpriced Chinese food that you could honestly get better quality stuff at your average takeout. I'm kind of confused why they think since its in Golden Nugget they can charge the prices. Whatever- never again!"}
{"text":"A group of 10 of us had a very mediocre meal here on a late Saturday night.  First of all, the waiter refused to acknowledge a simple modification on one of the orders.  We asked for the manager twice, and the waiter said \"I don't know his name\".  Huh?

The food was overpriced (this is downtown, not the Strip).  This would have been fine with us, but the quality was not good.  The Hot N Sour soup had a syrupy taste to it.  I asked for my Cashew Chicken dish to be very spicy, and it had no spice at all.  

On the plus side, it did have a nice atmosphere and decor."}
{"text":"soooo soooo yummy!!!! MUCH MUCH better quality than.....BENIHANA...yep that's right I said it BETTER THAN BENIHANA! a little cheaper too ;)

I always have the hibatchi shrimp and scallops which is always TDF!  My boyfriend gets the fillet,chicken and shrimp....always great!!!!! LOVE this place! Also lots of fun to load up on drinks at the slot machines and then go for dinner!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed Singaporean noodles and Dragon roll. The mint leaf chicken lettuce wrap was meh... Service was ok, nice dark atmosphere, teppanyaki tables on the side."}
{"text":"Food was extremely subpar. Ordered the Habachi Chicken and the vegetable had no flavor and the chicken was poorly seasoned and a low quality rubbery taste. The habachi dinners are a bit expensive as well, for the quality served. Chef was very social, but made a few mistakes. Might have been a recently hired chef."}
{"text":"Typical Chinese food restaurant that uses bottled sauces and over salts their food. Service was a bit impersonal. Got questioned whether I was allowed to eat pork by my waiter which I thought was offensive. If I order it I'm allowed to eat it!"}
{"text":"I have had both table service and teppan here and been happy both times.  Table service included noodle dishes, classic (Americanized) Chinese like Orange Chicken and Sushi/Sashimi.  Teppan was normal, but well priced.  My buddy had steak, scallop and lobster for $49.  

The only downside was the vast amount of food in the $20 pupu appetizer and the fact that they only had small sized beers."}
{"text":"This place was so good!  We didn't sit at the grill but sat at a table- we had a big group (10) on saturday night and we got seated right away. I had the hot and sour soup, coconut shrimp and the beef drunken noodles- I can't remember what it was called. I shared the meal with one other person and it was plenty of food!  Service was on point and the food came out hot and tasted and looked very fresh.  Everyone else in the group seemed to enjoy their food as well. 
I would definitely eat there again if I was in the area."}
{"text":"This place has the best Asian food and service! My water was never even half empty and I special ordered my food and it came out absolutely perfect! Our waiter was so attentive and genuinely nice! So awesome to have such fabulous service and great food on top of it! I would highly recommend! We were also seated immediately at a generally very busy time."}
{"text":"Overwhelming amount of food for the price! Service was spot on. The atmosphere was great! This place also has a great Hibachi grill and it's our next move! Awesome place for a dinner party! Five stars ate not enough"}
{"text":"Our server was so annoying my wife and I ordered the Kalbi Ribeye just to shut him up. Asked I I wanted another beer, I said no, brought another one anyway and tried to take my first one which was still half full. The ox tail soup and spring rolls were great. The Ribeye dinner was horrible. Both steaks were very tough. The fried rice had way too much soy sauce which made it very salty. The steamed vegetable were good though."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice. The food is very good! The service is a little off but my 5 stars is specifically based on the taste of my food. I had the Tuna steak and fried rice... For appetizer I had a philly roll which is by far the best one I've had because they use smoked salmon. Try the plum wine too! So flavorful!"}
{"text":"This review is for Lillie's . I had dinner here on 5/29/16 around 7pm. We were seated right away and had our orders taken quickly. Waiter brought our drinks out right away. I had the Honey Chicken and it was delicious. Our server was great and kept making sure we were enjoying dinner."}
{"text":"Yummy!  Potstickers were great and so was the fried rice. Found out I'm not a fan of Wonton soup, but pretty sure I wouldn't like it elsewhere either. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"I'll be honest -  it was just ok.  The service was great - very accommodating staff but when it came to the food, I could have been eating anywhere.  Certainly nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"We enjoyed Lillie's Teppanyaki (or as they call it \"Hibachi Grill\") on our last night in Las Vegas.  It was a wonderful way to say farewell to a wonderful 9-day stay! 

The service here is very good and the chefs are talented and have a great sense of humor!  If you've never tried teppanyaki, I recommend it highly and this place gets it right!  My husband and I have been to Benihana and other local teppanyaki restaurants but this was hands down the best either of us have had...so far. 

The meal price includes soup, salad, grilled vegetables and steamed rice.  Fried rice can be substituted for a nominal fee.  I highly recommend the Emperor's Feast which allows you to enjoy three entrée items for $44.  I enjoyed chicken, shrimp and tenderloin.  All of it was excellently prepared with their amazing sauces and spices!  They also provided three distinct dipping sauces: mustard sauce for beef & chicken, ginger sauce for seafood & vegetables and a hot chili sauce for anything.  I don't do hot sauces but my husband raved about the hot chili sauce! The other sauces were delicious!  

The restaurant is small so be sure to make a reservation.  You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Mmmm and so fun! Loved watching the chef prepare our meal on the hibachi grill. The food was quite a treat. The fish I ate was like butter, perfect in every way. Hoping to return sometime soon."}
{"text":"Yummy food!!!! Wish it was a little more reasonably priced but worth the full bellies and happy family. They were very accommodating to our kiddo- provided entertainment, gave us the chopsticks for kids (chopsticks with a rubber band and paper) & the kids meal was pretty reasonable. 2 adults and 1 kid (& 1 adult drink) for $117 ) w/ tip"}
{"text":"Located inside the Golden Nugget in Downtown came here last night for my Aunt's Birthday place is not that big but the staff is very attentive they don't leave you hanging and even the manager comes around and helps with any questions and even takes the order. They have two hibachi grills seats around maybe 16,  8 on one side 8 on the other since they have two chefs cooking on each one. We elected to sit at a table we had a group of 8 service was very fast for it being pretty busy. The one thing i found odd was that we only were able to get one tea kettle they ran out so our whole table had to share one with many refills. Food was good we ordered family style we got like 5 dishes of 2 each my fav was the honey glazed shrimp and the beef broccoli. The appetizers were also good which was the egg rolls and gyozas. Price was pretty expensive but what do you expect for Vegas and the Golden Nugget lol. I'd dine here again."}
{"text":"This review is for the staff! The food was good! However, the manager and server were completely terrible, unprofessional and rude. Never the less my 12 year old daughter for a dirty thong under our teppanyaki table. When brought to their attention the rudeness intensified. I was in utter Awwww at the way this was handle. Mind you not even a apology, yet an accusation that it was from us. We had all young children. I am so absolutely disgusted. I would NOT EVER RECOMMEND!!!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by the Noodle house while at the Golden Nugget. For the downtown Las Vegas Area, I was very impressed!

Waiters were very helpful and accommodating, answered many quested and also had some fine suggestions.  The food came out fairly quick, and the drinks were fast!

Had a decent selection of Sake and Beers, and I wouldn't say you should do there sushi tho.  Not much for choices!

All-around, a great spot to check out!"}
{"text":"Excellent service ... Excellent staff !!!  And even better the food is magnificent ... Highly recommended if you want yummy authentic Chinese food - took the leftovers back to the hotel and thought ... Shoot!!  I didn't grab a fork !!!  Lo and behold they put two sets in there ... We loved this place"}
{"text":"I HIGHLY recommend the Black Pepper tenderloin. Authentic, high-end Asian cuisine and great service."}
{"text":"We have done the hibachi grill twice now and both times have been pleasant. It is expensive but the food is pretty good. I got the filet. It was tender but lacking somewhat on flavor. They give you two sauces too dip your food in which are pretty good."}
{"text":"Now Lillie's Asian Cuisine...A fusion of traditional Cantonese, Szechwan and Pan-Asian flair, plus the excitement of Teppanyaki tables. Every time I am in Vegas I simply must eat here! My favorite dish is the Honey Chicken."}
{"text":"Who can resist a showboat tepanyaki chef with a sense of humour? From the smoking volcano onion to the egg juggling our chef made his customers clap, laugh and get to know one another. My scallop hibachi dinner had more large, sweet scallops than I could finish. A nicely grilled selection of veg and a mustard sauce that had kept the woman seated next to me coming back for years were also a good. The soup was so so. Service was attentive. Overall an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Fun, typical Japanese-grill moments scattered throughout quite boring, bland, usually high-priced food."}
{"text":"I came to the Golden Nugget to see a show and decided to have dinner at Lillie's.  I was seated promptly in a mostly empty restaurant.  I was brought my iced tea quickly and then I ordered.

For starters, I had their marinated jelly fish with sesame oil, chilis, and some thinly sliced pickled vegetables.  The sauce made with the oil and chilis gave the jelly fish a very good taste.  This was the first time I had jelly fish and I found it good.  Chewy and not too flavorful in itself.  It needs a good dressing, like pasta, to give it some flavor.

For the main course, I got the curry chicken clay pot.  The dish was listed as spicy and it was.  When brought to the table, my server cautioned me not to touch the bowl as it was very hot.  When he removed the lid of the pot, the dish was bubbling from the high temperature.  I let it cool for a minute or so.  The thing that caught my eye on the menu was the chicken was in a coconut curry sauce and it had pineapple as well as mushrooms and some normal vegetables in Chinese food.  The pieces of pineapple went well with the heat of the curry.  The portion was large enough it could be split by two.  I wasn't going home after dinner or I would have taken some home in a take out container.

My server suggested three items from the menu and I ended up with the lemon yuzu cake.  It was quite good and a nice finish to the meal.

Service was excellent.  Iced tea was refilled often and for each course the server and the manager came by to check and make sure everything was OK."}
{"text":"After spending a lot of time at the Golden Nugget's Mexican restaurant, we were in the mood for something a little bit different, so we soon found ourselves seated at the hotel's lone Asian eatery.

Lillie's offers a Hibachi Grill and that was probably what we should've done, but none of us were incredibly hungry, so we instead opted for the regular menu.

We started with an order of the Spring Rolls (\"Crisp Vegetable Spring Rolls, Plum Sauce\"). These were quite edible and the plum sauce was good, although there was nothing about the dish that screamed out deliciousness (ie they tasted pretty generic).

My appetite was especially minimal, so I decided to forego the mains and instead ordered an appetizer as my meal. I went with the Beef Lettuce Wraps (\"Romaine Lettuce Leaves, Minced Beef, Peanuts, Scallions, Crunchy Rice Noodles\").

I'll preface this by saying I misread the item and was expecting something closer to a salad roll, but that's on me. What I got was a decent yet completely unspectacular lettuce wrap. The filling was all perfectly fine although completely tasteless, with the Minced Beef seemingly cooked without any spices or even salt.

(To be fair, I did try one of my dining companion's dishes, the General Tso's Chicken, and that seemed a lot better and quite flavorful.)"}
{"text":"This restaurant located near the pool in the Nugget is actually much better than I expected it to be. I had my doubts because of my previous dinning experiences at the Nugget restaurants.

We opted for the teppan grill verses ordering off the menu. It wasn't something that I had done before, and when in Vegas, give everything a shot. It was a lot of fun and it was quite entertaining. It was more than what I thought it would be. The food was good and the services was top notch."}
{"text":"The food was typical habachi style. No yum yum sauce. A bit over priced, but what I expected for a casino restaurant."}
{"text":"Food was good! Yes I was surprised. Staff was helpful. Spicy was actually spicy!  Neat mix of foods on the menu."}
{"text":"Located near the Carson Tower in the Golden Nugget Hotel & Casino, Lillie's Asian Cuisine provides you with a choice of an entertaining Teppanyaki experience or a menu that includes a mixture of Cantonese, Szechwan and Pan Asian dishes.

Unfortunately while Lillie's menu spans different Asian cuisine, it barely provides a sufficient representation of each.  For menu selection, two stars. After being deprived of ramen/saimin for over a week on a cruise ship, I was craving hot Asian noodle soup. The only offering on their menu was the Cantonese Won Ton Noodle Soup for $15. They also had  a large cup of Won Ton Soup for $8 and a large bowl of Wor Won Ton for $11 but neither of these selections were offered with noodles with is standard at most Chinese restaurants; hence the below average rating.

The addition to my noodle soup I ordered Crab Rangoon which was the worse I have ever eaten. Although I didn't care for the taste of the pork won tons, I thought the soup was tasty and noodles were good. For food taste, three stars.

In terms of value, I would consider the food over priced. Maybe the intent of the pricing is to reflect Lillie's as an upscaled Asian restaurant, but clearly that could not be the case with the cheap chopsticks they offer. In addition, you can get much better value for your money at other nearby Las Vegas establishments. So for value, one star."}
{"text":"Um, to be honest I was pretty buzzed when I ate here.  I think the food was good.  I think it kinda took a long time to get the food though.  Cute atmosphere and they did have the option to sit at those beni-hana style group tables where they cook the food in front of you."}
{"text":"Red and Black are my favorite colors, so I was completely drawn to the decor of this place when I stayed at the Nugget last time. I made reservations with the front desk, but its never really crowded so Im not sure you HAVE to do that. The space is small, and the tables are pretty cozy but surprisingly private. The decor is beautiful and dark. The service was great, but the food was really kinda lame. I wasn't impressed. It was kind of pricey, as are most in-hotel up scale wanna be restaurants, I didn't think it was worth the effort or money. I could have put that 100 bucks into the lobster slot machine!!"}
{"text":"Meh. The food wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. The sushi was pretty derivative and uninteresting. Prices weren't bad, so go here if you want a straight forward meal with a good atmosphere without emptying your bank account."}
{"text":"Food is just ok. We were tired and needed food fast. Wait staff took ages to get our check. We got the pad thai and Kung Pao chicken."}
{"text":"OK, first thing you need to know is this place is owned by LANDRY's, yes Landry's.  The second thing you need to know is that they charge almost $4 for fried rice.  Not a huge dish of fried rice, a little bowl of fried rice.  Most other teppan yaki placed in town include it!  Well at least the good ones do.  The shrimp was not very good and the filet wasn't cooked well.  I ordered medium and it came out medium rare, and it wasn't really seared, more steamed.  You know how steamed steak tastes?  Well that was it.  The chicken was pretty good, but maybe on the dry side.  The ginger sauce was probably the best of all of the components.  Seriously, forego this place and try a local one instead.  For my money, Geisha on Sandhill and DI is far superior.  They give you fried rice as well as soup, salad, and an appetizer, I usually get the shrimp and vegetable tempura, and your choice of soda or small sake if you order the Geisha Special, and it's either $35.95 or 37.95.  The Geisha Special includes a shrimp appetizer, usually three pieces and then chicken, steak, and lobster.

At Lillie's, I got the special, can't remember the name, and it came with chicken, shrimp, and filet, it's a choose three situation, or you can get lobster and two others.  If you want really good teppan yaki and really want good value for your money, Geisha at DI and Sandhill is the way to go!

Come to think of it, the 2 stars here might be a bit generous.

The waitstaff was not that attentive, drinks ran empty a few times, they crowded us in at the table by maybe an extra person or two, they let people smoke e-digs, so for you, maybe that's a plus, but that shit stinks.

I can only lead you to water, I can't make you drink it."}
{"text":"Wow what a pleasant surprise! Authentic Chinese food in the heart of downtown Las Vegas! I was shocked because I saw the 3.5 star rating on Yelp and wasn't expecting much but wanted to eat some Chinese food while hanging out on Fremont St. So glad I took a chance on this one! 

First off the service was phenomenal. Adam was super friendly and had some great food selections. He recommended the sea bass and I'm sure glad he did. The sea bass was amazing! Perfectly steamed and dressed with soy sauce, green onions and ginger. Just the way I like it and how my grandma used to make it. Yum yum yum! 

We also ordered the beef brisket and tendon noodle soup. The noodles were cooked just right, the flavor of the broth was nothing short of spectacular and the tendon and brisket were tender. Just amazing. 

I will be back sooner than later. Just thinking about that meal makes me want to go back right now. Seriously the best authentic Chinese food I've had in Vegas thus far."}
{"text":"I very rarely give a solo star review.  I'll keep it brief.  The food was overpriced and the quality was so sub-par that we deeply regretted the fact that we were hungry and it was late.  If we had not been starving after a day of travel we would have vacated immediately.  Both entrees had so much msg dumped on them that they were GRITTY!  I've actually never had Chinese food so bad.  Desperation and hunger drove us to force down about half of each dish- with large quantities of water.   Truly terrible.  

In their defense, last year while attending the same conference I ate at the hibachi tables at Lillies and it was mediocre."}
{"text":"Food was good but waitress SUCKS (Christina). No personality what so ever, lazy and seems like she hates her job. Half the fun is the experience. AVOID her so you can enjoy the dining."}
{"text":"This review is only for the teppanyaki (hibachi grill) menu, since I haven't yet tried the regular menu yet. 

Went there on the Sunday of Memorial Day weekend. After walking around Fremont Street and the crowd at the Punk Rock Bowling festival, we decided to get a bite to eat at Lillies at the Nugget. Nothing special. My first job as a kid was at Benihana, and if you've seen one hibachi grill, you've seen them all. This one was no exception. A bit on the boring side. At least the food tasted fresh. We had the chicken and shrimp entree. Pretty standard - soup, salad, rice, grilled vegetables. At least the chef (King Kong), was entertaining enough, and had a bit of a personality. I felt sorry for the people who were sitting across from us. Their chef got in and out as fast as he could. I don't remember if he made an attempt to entertain the diners. Service was so-so. The waitress seemed a little tired. Perhaps, I'll give Lillies another shot sometime in the future, since their regular menu sounds somewhat interesting. 

Note to self: NO MORE HIBACHI!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to Lillie's 3 times, and each time had the teppanyaki.  Be advised there are only 2 tables, so it's wise to make reservations.

I found the servers to be appropriately enthusiastic, something that is a staple at most teppanyaki joints.  Each time, I get a mixed dinner which contains some combination of steak, chicken, lobster, shrimp.  I find at Lillie's the chefs are more skilled at cooking the steak to the requested temperature.  Also, my shrimp/lobster has never been tough or overcooked.  

The service is quick, I never went wanting for another beer, but the service does not take away from the action.  You get quite a meal for the price, if you are downtown I highly recommend it if you are looking for a different dining experience."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant while on a business trip, traveling on my own. So I dined at Lillies as a solo diner at a table, not at the hibachi. The service was mostly good, although I had to track down my waiter for a copy of my bill before I left. The food, however, was so-so. I had the chicken satay which was very boring. It was described as \"spicy.\" I am a wimp when it comes to spice, and this was NOT spicy. It was served over a slice of honeydew melon. Hmmm....odd. The dessert was the best part. I ordered the chocolate macadamia nut torte. It was a very rich dessert, so I didn't finish it. But this was not because I didn't like it; it was just a lot ot eat and very richly flavored.

Overall, I wouldn't recommend this restaurant unless you are looking for the ordinary and expected at an affordable price."}
{"text":"Didn't really hit the spot after a night out. And everything tasted overly salted. I love me some Asian food, and look to that for comfort food - this place didn't hit that mark."}
{"text":"Nope.

This is some pretty gross Asian cuisine and the cost is quite high for this type of quality. I'm not sure if people enjoy the hibachi - but this place was not tasty at all. I would compare it to most American Chinese fast food joints around town priced under $10 a plate.

We had -

Crab Special Roll - it was too sweet and I only ate one piece - so did the boyfriend. Pretty sure it was imitation crab.
Lillie's Special Stir Fry - Special my ass. It was so starchy, bland and just flat out disgusting. 
X.O. Prawns - the shrimp tasted like it was not fresh, tasted bagged and very very fishy tasting. Like it had been chillin in a tank of water after defrosting for a day or two. It was very chewy as well. 

I'm not sure what is going on in this place. It was $70+ without tip. The service was good and prompt. The restaurant itself was nice, but the main focus has got to be turned toward the food. We were so hungry, we ate it anyways. But no more. I'm gagging just thinking about how yucky it was."}
{"text":"This review is for the service and not for the food, because I did not get a chance to taste any. It's like 8:40pm and HALF the restaurant was empty. But the hostess said they were all reserved and the three of us would have to wait 40 mins. I am sorry but you are not even a three star restaurant so please don't be such a snob and turn your customers and hotel guests away, when half your restaurant is empty on a Sunday night. I'm sure half of those reservations won't even show up. And just by looking at your menu, I can tell it's not even decent chinese food. Better than Panda Express at best."}
{"text":"Ok ok so this restaurant is inside the Golden Nugget Casino and its a nice casino however the food is sooo gross!  I ordered the crab fried rice dinner and they gave me about 10lbs of fried rice with 2 really skinny and small crab strips that tasted like fake frozen crab.  We asked the waiter about this and he said that what the meal consisted of, yuck!  The decor is high class and looks like a very nice, fancy and expensive restaurant but the food does not step up to the plate.  To make matters worse they over charged us on our credit cards so we called back and they said they had taken money to tip themselves! As if!!! We actually did tip these guys since we figured the food preparation was not their fault!  In the end, the manager said he would refund us the tip that they had taken out in a few days!  I'd say skip this place and go to Panda Express!!!"}
{"text":"WHAT. A. JOKE!!!

Congratulations Lillie's, you are the proud receiver of my first-ever one-star review.

On our way up to the room after hanging out by the pool all day, we made reservations for dinner at 7:30pm on a Saturday night. The lady explained that the only reservations they took were for the hibachi/tepan grills and not the dining room, which was find because we wanted the grills anyway. My brother asked, \"So can we get a reservation?\" To which the lady replies, \"Dining room or hibachi?\" Hello!!! What did you just say?!?! Idiot.

We catch a quick nap and shower before heading back for dinner. W arrive at 7:34pm. I tell the lady (different lady this time) my name and our reservation time. She then proceeds to tell me that she'd given our reservation away because they only hold reservations for five minutes. I pull out my cell phone and it says 7:35pm. I tell her this and she goes through her spiel again. I ask why they would give away a reservation after waiting a mere five minutes and she claims it's policy (it's bullshit is what it is, you should be ashamed). I then ask if we can get a seat at one of the remaining tables since there was an open spot and no one waiting. She says no and mumbles something about the dining room. I ask, \"Excuse me?\" and she tells me that there's nothing she can do. I then ask her, \"Nothing you can do or will do?\" As she stands there, stunned and searching for a reply, my friend walks up and lays into her. The lady says, \"Well I called your room like five times and no one picked up.\" My friend replies, \"Either you called as we left the room to come down to dinner or you didn't call at all. Which room were you calling?\" She rattles off \"1011\", to which my friend replies, \"You were calling the wrong room. We're 10111, the hotel doesn't have a 1011.\" If you work in a hotel, shouldn't you have a vague knowledge of the room numbers? My friend is now fed up, \"Fine. We're going some place else. Thank for nothing.\" Not a reply from the lady.

This place is ridiculous! First you give away a reservation after five measly minutes of waiting for us and then you won't do a damn thing to remedy the situation? No apology at all? I've never been so appalled by customer service in my life. Never have I been treated so poorly. Never has a restaurant had such disregard for its customers or any form of customer service."}
{"text":"Overall a pretty good experience. We had teppanyaki and the food was very good. The appetizers were on the small side but our chef was funny and playful. We sat at a table with some other people who had no interest in talking to us so we just talked amongst ourselves and enjoyed our food.

The cocktail menu was limited but there is a nice selection of beer and wine. Next time we would like to try the sushi."}
{"text":"Delicious. Cool milieu. Super nice staff. Yes expensive but everything in Vegas is expensive."}
{"text":"This restaurant is always a good time. We had 17 people with us and they were able to put us at 2 tapenyaki tables. This is a great way to team build and have a dinner and a show at the same time. Ill definitely be back."}
{"text":"I always eat here when I go to Fremont Street on a Vegas vacation.  Really good food and quiet atmosphere, as well as friendly & attentive staff.  I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"On my last visit here, a Caterpillar Roll was smooth and very mild, while the taste of a bowl of Hot & Sour Soup was ultra-spicy and harsh.  Kung Pao Chicken with water chestnuts, Green Bell Peppers, celery, onion, and fresh white chicken meat was very good, as was the service.  Water refills gratefully arrived unbidden.

Meanwhile, Diane enjoyed her selections of Wonton Soup and Honey Glazed Shrimp.  

4 stars overall!"}
{"text":"?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????7?(??2?)??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????^_^?????????????????????5??????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Great dinner/good service! The reason for the 4 star instead of 5 is the BBQ ribs were a bit on the cold side and the pricing is  way more than it should be."}
{"text":"I have been to this place four times now. The first two times were great! The third time I thought it was a fluke that it wasn't good so decided to try it one more time. Still bad so I won't be returning. The food had no flavor and the two waiters we had acted like we were inconvenicencing them. There are plenty of other restaurants in Vegas that taste better and the people are happy to serve you. Don't waste your time or money on this place!!!"}
