{"text":"This old church was converted into a beautiful restaurant that provides a modern and comfortable atmosphere, while respecting the history and architecture of the original structure.  My girlfriend and I enjoyed great service from Noah and were also impressed with the menu.  As vegetarians, we sometimes find it challenging to pick items from the menu, however we felt there was an adequate selection of items for us. The meal itself was underwhelming.  Our pasta dish was bland.  This place does have great potential and is worth trying."}
{"text":"Went here Saturday night with a party of 6. Food was ok, seafood didn't taste like it was the freshest. Generally most of the dishes were a bit heavier than they should be. In a city like Toronto if you're gonna serve Italian cuisine then you better have some tight game, there's just soooo much competition. The presentation was great but doesn't make up for the mediocre quality. 

Ambience was your typical supper club, dj, crowds drinking at the bar, etc. Enjoyable if that's what you're looking for. Definitely not a romantic dinner kinda place. Imagine a nightclub that serves food, that's what you get here.

Service was good, fast and attentive.

I wouldn't go back, not because it was awful, it wasn't. But I'm just more into food quality and I know I can get better Italian at close a dozen other places."}
{"text":"I love this place, great vibe, cool concept, good food..."}
{"text":"4/5. Great ambiance! Terrific place to hold a birthday with a large group. I recommend he lamb chops, sea bass and any of the fresh pasta dishes!"}
{"text":"Had brunch this past Sunday. Do not come to this place. Cocaine snorters in the bathroom (twice that my husband saw. )
People smoking kush outside of the entrance. There was a teenager playing music. Awful. Waste of our money. Our party left (were disappointed. ) Managers were not in sight."}
{"text":"Arrived and the place looked quite nice inside. Had to order off the pre picked summer menu which only consists of 4 apps, 4 entrees and a cpl desserts. Apps were mediocre, choice of entrees was disappointing, 2 veg, 1 beef, 1 fish....why not offer a chicken instead of having 2 veg??? Dessert was laughable, lemon sorbet was putrid. The absolute worst part has yet to come tho. About half way through our meal, 2 friends of ours showed up and sat with us. Not once did the server ask if our friends wanted a drink, or food, or anything....it's like they never existed. They also automatically add an 18% gratuity on you bill lol. I assume this is because patrons weren't tipping due to their terrible service. With drinks you can find a lot better places to drop 100+bucks for two."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times now and like the place so far, although I haven't had a full meal. Their staff is friendly and accommodating and they have a good bar with big screen TVs - a rarity in the neighbourhood. There's nothing that totally stands out, but I've gotta say it's a solid place. I like the little appetizers that they do in the early evenings."}
{"text":"The place was empty, but so nice inside. It was just myself, two female friends, and a group of people, with a couple of kids.

Really clean design and set-up.

The bartender was also great and really helpful - he suggested drinks for us to try, and service (when I needed to soak up some of the alcohol with some food) was prompt.

I drank a Negroni (quite nice) and had crostini with a choice of four spreads. (My favourites: the ricotta and honey, closely followed by the cured salmon - yum!)

(Embarrassing aside: At the end of the bar, closest to the front door, there is an enclosure that looks like a mini-wine cellar. Two tips: (1) That is not the way to the restroom. (2) You can't walk down there - there's a pane of glass in front of it. I learned this the hard way.)

That said, I'd like to see what this place is like when it's hopping. But for a Thursday night, it sadly wasn't."}
{"text":"Ok restaurant. Food was quite good, but, having been converted from a church,  I was expecting more in terms of ambiance. 

We went there on a Friday night and the DJ was really awful. The tunes he was spinning totally ruined our dinner.

I would consider going there again, but would first make sure it's a different DJ."}
{"text":"you pay for the ambience. 

food = 3, venue = 5, prices = 3 

the venue is really cool and you definitely understand the church-inspired interior. unfortunately the food didn't really live up to the same standard. i'm surprised this venue is in queen west, because i feel like the crowd that it draws is more of the king west clientele. anyway...onto the food. 

the polenta fries are nothing special, but i did really enjoy the aioli that it came with to dip. 

the meatballs are DELICIOUS- some of the best i've had in the city. i would go back here and just order two orders of meatballs. 

gnocchi was a little overcooked - i don't recommend it. 

tagliatelle was better than the gnocchi. i would eat it again."}
{"text":"Alway a fun time at Church never thought I'd be saying that being catholic lol. Didn't have food this time but I always enjoyed dinners on my past visits."}
{"text":"This was a tough review to write as value for money is a huge component of the reviews I write and this place seriously lacks bang for your buck - so diner beware. However, the beauty of this venue, and the exuberance and friendliness of the staff made me love this place ever so much

First the bad. I was here for a friends birthday dinner on Saturday and for convenience we were doing a $45 prix fixe menu which came with (what appeared to be 4 courses). For that price 3 sharable courses (crustini + assorted spreads, aranccini and Polenta fries) were brought out in limited quantity and guests were made to ration the potion off amongst one another, AND a choice of 1 main course. The choices for the main were 2 pastas dishes (gnocchi or tagliatelle), a lamb option (3 pieces) and another which I can't recall.

All options seemed kinda meh, so I inquired with the server who advised me to avoid the lamb as it was 3 tiny pieces and go with one of the pastas. I appreciated the honesty and went with the gnocchi, mind you given that I'd had a couple of crustini, a rice ball (aranccini) and a couple of polenta fries at this point, I didn't see how the gnocci dish was going to account for $20-30 worth of value. To be fair, even at the best Italian restaurants if you're paying upwards of $25 for a plate of pasta you're paying too much.

While the gnocci was excellently cooked and the tomato basil sauce very tasty, the portion size was abysmal.

So let's recap, what you get for a $45 prix fixe:
- a scoop of mixed greens
- a small-medium sized plate of pasta
- 1-2poleta fries (if lucky)
- 1 arancinni ball
- A couple of crustini with spreads on them

Na-Uh - Sorry but I won't be getting down on my knees and praying about the value of food at this Church anytime soon. To be honest it feels like my money would have been better served going into the collection box during mass.

That being said, the venue (an actual converted church) is Ã¼ber swanky. The ceiling is open, revealing the exposed beams of the original church, long pendent LED lights hang from the ceiling, the lay out is excellent and the staff are quite friendly. 

HOWEVER, their music levels were far too high to be able to entertain the idea of normal conversation - it was like eating at a nightclub during a Drum and Bass event. Several of us had soar throats the next day from yelling at the person next to us - note to management (turn it down a little while people are still dining).

Verdict: I'll come back for drinks, But I'll head somewhere else for my Italian Eats!

Eatcrest OUT!"}
{"text":"Pour les fan de charcuterie italienne, On est dans une ambiance bar lounge avec des plats presentes en petite portion mais qui valent le detour.

For italian delicatessen. The atmosphere is kinda like a lounge bar with small sizes dishes but the quality definitely comes with it."}
{"text":"I was here for a CMYE so this review mainly applies for bar area.
The setup is nice and has an open feel. This is an unexpected place as the exterior of the place doesn't do it justice. 
 The bar area is consists of a long bar with and spreads almost the length of the room. They had a big drink menu with some promo prices for this event.
I was in the mood for a beer so went for pilsner initially. I was so engrossed in the conversation that I didn't even catch the name of the beer. It was a decent beer though.
Then I saw someone having maudite! (unibrue rocks!) I was intrigued on what else they had on draft. An lo and behold they had Blanche De Chambly as well (served complete with a slice of fresh cut orange)
Beautiful now I know where to come for a decent selection of beer if I am in this area.
4 star to come here for drinks."}
{"text":"Love the location , service and ambience. The food was ok but I may go there again because Summerlicious is sometimes a different experience then the normal restaurant."}
{"text":"Very good mains, apps weren't great.  Small but delicious wine list.  Great service nice place I'll go back"}
{"text":"Really beautiful inside.
Service was wonderful from the host to the server to the Italian gentlemen (owner, I'm guessing) who frequented our table often. Portions were huuuuuuuge! 

Mussels - my partner said it was good and was a big fan of the sauce (he had a continuous supply of bread for dipping!) 
Arancini - deep fried cheese and rice balls, gimme more! 
Tagliatelle - I normally don't like this kind of pasta but decided to give it a whirl on the server's recommendation - really good. Perfectly cooked and the sauce was delicate and balanced. 
Veal - I only tried a bit but liked it. My partner was satisfied (but I think he wanted my dish!) 
Lemon sorbet 
Raspberry pudding type dessert (can't remember the name) 
Both delicious! The sorbet was a little watery when they brought it out. 

The server also put up with my fussiness for recommendations (I hate mushrooms and can't do spicy) and also was very graceful about offering samples and recommending a wine for a non wine drinker! She was also a stunning girl. 

Will be returning!"}
{"text":"I've been here once before and the experience was great. This time around not so much.. I came for my birthday with a party of 7 which later turned into a party of 8, our waitress had attitude, it took her 20 minutes to take our drink order and another 20 minutes to find us menus to which she said \"she couldn't find any menus\". I looked around to see if other people were using menus and to my surprise everyone else had been or was already eating. Ok. When we ordered our drinks finally I asked for a bottle of white wine and she brought a bottle of red, not a big deal but I specified that I wanted white. My friend ordered another cosmopolitan and it never came. I think she came to our table a total of 3 times for the duration of the night. And during the time we would have to stop her and ask for more drinks, bread, olive oil and vinegar... not once did she ask if we wanted anything else or if we were good for drinks and such. The food and drinks were amazing though, besides the service I love everything about this place."}
{"text":"Rolled into town and took a 10 mile (yes, I'm American) walk and stumbled into Church. I'd go to church more often if they had such a great wine list. We grabbed a seat at the bar and had excellent service. Jordan, the bar tender is such a doll, very friendly and steered us towards a very nice Repaso. 

We order some apps to start, my bf had the beef carpaccio and I ordered the octopus. It took forever for my app to arrive so my partner had already wolfed his by the time mine arrived. To make up for it they gave my bf a complimentary order of meatballs. How nice is that? The octopus was fantstic, it was tender, grilled to perfection and served with white beans, olives and green beans. 

After two glasses of wine and apps we decided to split the special Puttanesca pasta, usually one of my favorites. The dish was kind of a let down, it wasn't spicy or briny enough. Also while the rotini type pasta was well cooked I prefer vermicelli with this sauce.

All in all this is a great place on West Queen, the interior of the old church has been preserved and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"honestly I think I met the nicest most helpful happiest funnest waitress in the world. She was just amazing! 

So we went there on a Thursday night for my sisters birthday party,  which I tried to find the best place for a month.  A smaller group of us wanted to do food first and then have the rest join us. So a combination of restaurant/ a big enough bar for 30-40 people wasn't that easy to find. I wasn't too sure about this place at first cuz it looked more like a restaurant than a bar. But it was just the best choice!  The waitress was super accommodating for the earlier dinner crowd to give us separate bills since some were eating and some weren't. Then the birthday crowd slowly showed up. and the place turned out to a bar as the music got louder too.

Food was good, tapas plates, good for sharing.

The place itself is beautiful. Very high ceiling and beautiful lightings. I definitely recommend this place for large groups!"}
{"text":"Simple delicious food. 
Received a free charcuterie upon being seated
even though happy hour was over. 
Nice touch. 
Returned on a busy Saturday night and was seated
at the bar. Dj was rocking if you're in the mood
for a louder atmosphere. 
Would return, especially with a group on the 
weekends."}
{"text":"A little off the beaten path, the restaurant is housed in an old Slavic church. Owners David Beddia and Sandra Cassaro have maintained some of the original architecture, namely the wooden ceilings with suspended lights which emulate organ pipes.  All along the restaurant you'll find dimly lit candles, but the focal point is definitely the altar (kitchen), which sits on an elevated platform where Fabio Sacca prepares his holy sacraments.  Behind the bar you'll find classic Italian movies such as Bicycle Thieves (Ladri di biciclette) playing on one of two flat screen televisions.

While the cuisine is undisputedly Italian, the dishes are untypically so.  Fabio's meatballs are something that mama used to make, but it's definitely not mama's average meatballs.

The holy water is definitely not used for sprinkling, though it definitely gets my blessing.  The list alludes to scriptures in Genesis with names like Adam and Eve and Cain and Abel.  I wasn't such an avid pupil in Sunday school, so I opted for the Ascension Lemonade ($10), a vodka-based drink with simple syrup, lemon juice and soda.  My dining companion opted for the Holy Caesar ($11), which was light on salt but big on flavour.  The cocktails at Church are almost double the size of your usual, and very fairly priced.

For those of you who enjoy dining communal-style, the menu lists two prices.  The left refer to single portions, while the right refers to communal portions for a minimum 4-person count.  With all the yummy dishes at Church, communal is definitely the way to go so that you can try a little bit of everything.

We feasted on a generous roster of menu items handpicked by the chef.  To start we sampled a selection of Italian Sashimi (market price).  Tonight's features included: Wild Salmon from the West Coast topped with a medley of roasted chopped nuts, King Fish from Boston drizzled in lemon olive oil, Yellowfin Tuna topped with olive oil and balsamic, Icelandic Arctic Char topped with diced celery and my favourite, Spigola (from Italy) topped with chives.  A great starter dish, and great pairings to highlight the various types of fish.

Next up, was the Gnoccho Fritto ($13), a new addition to the menu and a personal favourite.  It was a very nostalgic dish that reminded me of my childhood days when I played with food.  Slices of prosciutto di Parma are stuffed into the gnoccho fritto with a smear of Fontina for added flavour.  A very fun and unique dish!

I do love myself a good French fry, but I think Church has converted me as I couldn't get enough of the Polenta Fries ($9) which are baked and then fried for added crispiness.  For those of you who like to dip your fries, you may choose from a spicy tomato sauce or creamy Gorgonzola, Fontina and truffle sauce, which would be my pick of the two.

The Veal and Pork Meatballs ($9) melt in your mouth with a homemade traditional Sugo sauce.  I couldn't help but giggle at the thought that these resembled capezzoli di venere (chocolate truffles dubbed Venus' nipples).  I shall excuse myself from the table to receive confession now...

And how could an Italian meal be complete without pasta right?  The Spaghetti alla Chitarra ($14) blossomed on to my plate with shrimps adoring the borders. It is sprinkled with bottarga di Mugine (a cured fish roe) which really made the dish.  The zucchini was a tad bit soft, but overall a great dish.

And taking a detour from Italy, we ate Triple A Angus Ribeye Sliders ($14) which needed no condiments at all.  They were naturally flavourful, extremely juicy and utterly amazing.  The Fontina worked well to tone down the Gorgonzola and there was just enough cheese to complete the mouth-feel of the slider.  Given the choice, I'd opt for another slider in place of the fries.

Our evening finished off with a Mille Feuille dessert layered with pastry cream that is made fresh daily.  The layers were thin and the dessert was luscious.

I really enjoyed my evening at Church - from the ambiance, to the dÃ©cor, service and food.  I love Italian food, but sometimes you just get bored of the same old same old.  The creative spins that Fabio is taking on his menu are a real hit for me and refreshing for someone who dines out not infrequently.

If you still aren't convinced here's a little incentive for you.  From Tuesday to Saturday nights from 5-7PM, you can enjoy complimentary antipasti and stuzzichini with the purchase of a drink.  Wednesday nights also feature a 5-course tasting menu at a cost of $50.

The only question left is - when are we going to Church?"}
{"text":"What's upsetting to me is that this place has the potential to be awesome, but just seems to be failing so short. 

Reno-ing a church is a great idea, but it feels overdesigned in execution. Despite being in one of the coolest areas in Toronto, you don't see a lot of Parkdale natives but instead it seems to be a magnet for 905ers.

The wine was great and the service was good, but I don't see myself returning because it was not a venue I enjoyed being at."}
{"text":"We came here with a party of 4 on a Friday night during  Halloween weekend just after 9pm. The place wasn't packed but had a comfortable amount of patrons.

All the food was excellent in terms of taste/quality. I'm not a pasta fan by any means yet the pasta was superb (and actually al dente). However, the highlight of the night was the assorted meat platter that came with tender sliced steak, sausage, steak on a bone, etc. The meat was delicious. Appetizers were also really well prepared. Not sure why other yelpers were disappointed with portion size (yes some apps were a little small), however, generally speaking, all items were appropriately priced for their quality.

The interior aesthetics were really well done, including leaving the original church beams exposed. Very nice overall ambience inside the bar. Staff was very accommodating, especially the Manager, Enzo.

The only reason I'm giving the place 4 stars is because we were anticipating a DJ after 10pm but were told that it wasn't planned for (maybe only Saturday nights)? In any case, I will return to Church Aperitivo soon. On a side note, if you're a fan of Aperol Spritz, they were the best I tried in Toronto (taste and presentation) since trying last year in Italy."}
{"text":"I arrived here on a Friday night a few weeks back with a small group of girlfriends for dinner and drinks.  We had a reservation and were seated immediately (though the place wasn't crowded).  Our overall first impression was that this place is swanky, the esthetic is dark, rich, and sleek.  I understand that this building used to be a church.  It made me a bit sad to see that it was so swanky, I kind of liked the idea of an authentic Italian restaurant in an old church...I pictured soaring ceilings, exposed brick walls, rustic wood floors, and heavy wrought iron light fixtures hanging from the ceiling.  Oh well, can't have everything.

We sat down and ordered a bottle of wine, the wine list isn't terribly extensive, but they did have some good options.  We chose a Sauv blanc to go with our salumi platter and pasta dish.  We also ordered the beef carpaccio.  The wine was perfect.  The salumi platter ($18) was quite tasty, though a little small for the price.  The beef carpaccio ($13) was perfectly done.  We selected the Papardelle in a Wild Boar Ragu ($62/for 4ppl).  Now, I was expecting to be wowed by this dish, unfortunately, I was not.  The pasta was a little too overdone and the sauce was average.  I really, really wanted to like it, so it was a bit of a disappointment.  Their menu is simple, not too many dishes and clearly Italian. However, I do have one gripe and it's major...WHERE's THE FUCKING PIZZA?!  What kind of Italian restaurant doesn't offer pizza?!  Just sayin'.

Since it was a Friday night, they had a DJ on hand and the music was great.  They were also hosting something called \"Confession Fridays\", the entire premise behind this is that people can submit their confessions online, or via \"confession\" card, twitter, etc.  Confessions can range from \"I have a crush on so and so\", to \"I'm cheating on my husband with his best-friend\"...it's a little different, but I think given the right crowd, it could prove to be an interesting and entertaining evening.    

As an aside, my girlfriend and I stopped by last Friday night at around 9:30pm and the place was hopping...so clearly they're making some adjustments.  We stuck around and had a few drinks and to be honest the vibe was totally different and based on that experience, we will be returning.

Despite my criticism, I do like this place, the staff were friendly and service was quick...the food was good, the dÃ©cor modern and the music was a perfect accompaniment to the meal, with a few minor adjustments, this place could be awesome."}
{"text":"Cute little spot! Friendly staff, comfortable setting! Highly recommend their meatballs and gnocchi...unreal! Looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"I am a total fan! Came here with my mom one night.  Ambiance is really nice, it's dark and moody...just beautiful.  

We tried the arancini to start (one of my favorites) and these didn't disappoint! Nice and crispy on the outside, creamy on the inside. Delish.

I ordered the penne pasta, which was just okay, but the main star of the meal was my mom's sea bass. I think it was the special that day. They seared the skin side and it didn't even need any sauce, it tasted like it was the best fish and chips you've ever had.. but better? Hard to explain, but highly recommended.

Also the service was great, an older Italian gentleman who I believe was the owner came over and he was just a peach! I would go back just to hang out with him some more.

Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I've been a few times and the service and food are always excellent. Fabio, the chef, is always very welcoming and jovial. The last time we were there, Julia was our server. She was great. Not pushy, or too perky which can be so annoying. One of the owners was there as well. He stopped by our table to make sure that everything was ok. Great pipes lol

I enjoyed our crostini appetizer which consisted of house made, crispy herb-flecked crostini with whipped ricotta and honey, house-cured salmon, an amazing artichoke spread and and olive tempenade.  

Pastas are made in house. The mushroom pasta is particularly delicious. Not too heavy handed on the truffle. I've also had the wild boar parpadelle. Mmmm.

The meatballs are a must. So soft and tender. I could eat this everyday. You can't not order these when you're there. Best meatballs in town."}
{"text":"I wandered in here on a Tuesday evening, and much to my delight all their appies are $5.00 and their entrees $10.00 on Tuesday nights so go then and order up a storm! The food is pretty decent, but nothing to rave about. At those prices though you really can't complain :)"}
{"text":"The food was good but the service was a huge disappointment. My sister's meal never actually came and after waiting we found out that they had given it to the wrong table! After dinner we also ordered espresso that never showed up, when we inquired after 25 minutes they said they forgot and asked if we still wanted it. At this point, we asked for our bills and to speak with the manager. The manager was also unprofessional in not giving a genuine apology, he asked if a round of shots would remedy the situation. Ridiculous, we were here for a nice dinner amongst friends - not to get drunk..."}
{"text":"We arrived at 6pn and we're asked if we had a reservation we didn't however were offered seating quickly and our waitress arrived, Sophia who was great. We decided on a bottle of wine primitivo, which was delicious. We started with the crustini with rocotta and honey followed by the polenta fritta, these amazing polenta fries with spicy tomato & fontina sauce, crispy and sweet. We added our second bottle of wine and talked local bight cap locations with our lovely waitress. For entrees we shared Tagliatelle ai Funghi, amazing flat pasta with a wild mushrooms cream sauce, Pappardelle al Cinghiale and the ravioli. They were all great but the star of the show was the Agnello Scottadito. The lamb chops served were perfect and melted like butter and the herb sauce was amazing. We finished dinner with espresso and a selection of desserts. My favorite was Panna cotta with house made carmel. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"There used to be a Slavic Pentecostal Church in our 'hood at the corner of Dovercourt/Queen W.

It was for sale for a long time and we've been watching it transform itself into the Church Aperitivo Bar.  It recently opened so we stopped in tonight to check it out.

We sat at the bar.  It's a nice trendy spot ... so we ordered a bottle of bubbly (N.V. Prosecco Cuvee Beatrice).

Scott took good care of us.

It was packed. Large parties kept coming in ... no doubt they had reservations.

My one complaint is that they had techno music playing really really loud (I'm not a fan of techno music at the best of times).

They will have a patio in the warmer weather along Dovercourt (west) which I imagine will be a great spot for people watching.

Hard to believe it used to be a church!"}
{"text":"I had no idea this was a church and never noticed it before until it opened. Anyways, I think it will be a hot new spot! 

VIBE 
As stated, this used to be a slavic church. I love the high ceilings and wooden beams on top. There are beautiful murals of birds on the walls. 
Funny thing about the scene: three food bloggers consecutively sat down at the bar, each not knowing the other was going to be there. It turned into this random tweetup. Such is life in the social media world of Toronto. Otherwise, there were about two other couples here. 
Service is pretty attentive. 

WE ATE/DRANK 
The really cool thing about Church Aperitivo is that they offer FREE nibbles if you have a drink from 5 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. every Tuesday to Saturday

From their site: 
Beginning in Northern Italy and dating as far back as the 1700's, it is an authentic 
Italian tradition that combines small plate food with refreshing light alcoholic drinks 
during the hours of early evening as a relaxing prelude to dinner.

So basically, it's not your typical North American Happy Hour (not that we really have one here). Anyways, good idea! It's a lot of arancini, fried eggplant, bruschetta, and mini pizzas. I had three plates (starving!).

This isn't a typical dinner place. It's mainly tapas so we shared a few plates. 
We ate: 
sliced striploin with arugula, cherry tomatoes, parmigiano --this was my favourite dish. The flavours complemented each other and the striploin was cooked very nicely, medium rare. 

Calamari, mussels, clams, scallops, shrimps in a tomato sauce --this was a misleading dish. All of the seafood was wrapped in the calamari. It wasn't that great. Sorry. Not a fan. The calamari being grilled does not make up for it. 

Fresh spaghetti, cherry tomato, basil pesto, mascarpone cheese --it was a good dish and very fresh but very simple and not worth $12 for something I could make at home. 

Veal and pork meatballs, house made sugo  - hearty but lacked flavour for me. 

The bloggers had the crostini and it looked plentiful and delish! I'd probably go for that if I ever come back. 

We drank: Villa Pillo Borgoforte from 2008. A lovely, rich red. Went down smooth. Had a bit of a bite to it. I liked it. 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
Definitely a great aperitivio but definitely NOT cheapo! Per person, for two glasses of wine plus food we paid $60. I'd rather stuff my face at Grand Electric for the same price for a full blown dinner.  
It's a really nice date place though and the vibe is lovely.  I'd stick to one or two apps so you don't go over the budget."}
{"text":"Been there twice, never again. First time we ordered a $400 bottle of wine and the amateur waitress never topped it for us! We had to pour our own wine!?!?! Okay fine maybe she's new whatever, food was mediocre nice ambience with live DJ which was nice. So we go again maybe this time we will get a better waitress, we sat down for 15 mins and no one came to greet us or pour us water, waiters just walk by looking stuck and won't take a second look at us. The crowd is older so I guess they think younger people don't deserve as much attention? I also sense a little of racism because we are Asians. We go out to a lot of restaurants all over Toronto and this is one of the worst service! Just disrespectful... 

So we decide to walk out. And as soon as we get up to leave then they come up and acknowledged our existence and asked why we are leaving ? Are you kidding me ? Never again

The restaurant was not even packed FYI it is all star weekend !! On a Friday !!! That should tell you something about them"}
{"text":"Came here with a large party one night. A few of us arrived a little early so our table wasn't ready yet. It wasn't a long wait but we still decided to get a drink at the bar. Bartender was lovely and made cocktails that were both strong and delicious. 

The space was quite nice, clean lines with simple, modern decor. Once the rest of the party arrived we were seated and had nice attentive service throughout the night. 

The crostini platter was good, there was a decent selection and everything was fresh. The rice balls were weird in my opinion. A few people in our party liked them but I thought it was too rich and the texture was just too odd for me to enjoy. The meatballs were really good - I think that was the only thing everyone agreed was fantastic. We had a few other things that were only okay. 

Overall I enjoyed my time at the bar more than I enjoyed the food. I would swing by for a drink again though if I was in the area."}
{"text":"The service there is really friendly & quick. Multiple people checked in on us while we were dining. To make sure that we were happy with food and drinks.

My spouse David ordered Zuppa Di Pesce calamari, mussels, clams, scallops, & shrimps. He was satisfied. He raved about it for days to other people to try it. 

I ordered the saint for a drink. I loved it. I love vodka :). 
Appetizer: Salad with kale & green apples with roasted pistachios in an apple cider vinaigrette
Main course: BRANZINO- baked whole seabass with fresh herbs, extra virgin olive oil, lemon and mixed salad
Dessert: no room for dessert :)

If you haven't checked out this restaurant, do so. 

:)"}
{"text":"Meh. Food was decent. Service was decent. Bill for 4 was 300$. 15$ Caesars? They are the same as you get at any bar for 6$ anywhere in toronto."}
{"text":"We've been twice, once for cocktails and once for dinner. Next trip I'm hoping to sit in the alcove. The dÃ©cor is dark and beautifully lit with candles (as at church, yes?). Love the soundtrack. Live DJ some nights.

Interesting selection of wines by the glass and the prices are reasonable for Toronto. London, Ontario restaurateurs take note; your prices should be commensurate with your city, too. After a glass of the Canti Prosecco ($11) I wanted to try the Amaro before ordering it. The bartender kindly gave me a sip. My guest had the Lander Jenkins Cabernet Sauvignon ($15) and really enjoyed it.

On our second trip we had a wonderful meal, each dish better than the last. The kale salad with apples ($9) was crisp and distinctive. The caprese ($15) respected the classic recipe but added avocado. My guests loved the polpette ($12) with grand padano. The calamari with aioli is among the best that I've ever had ($16).

This might be a minor point to some, but both times we found parking immediately in front of the resto. That's huge advantage over other places that are closer to downtown.

Expect great service whether you are at the bar or at a table.

This would be the perfect place for a birthday party or other special event. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Food: Presentation was poor for pricing. Some portion sizes were small and should be listed as \"small dishes\" but they were priced the same as larger portions. Some of us were full, some of us not. Butter for the bread was FROZEN! The food itself was just okay. Nothing spectacular. 
Customer service: Needs a lot of improvement. Waiting staff do not know restaurant etiquette.   A lot of reaching over people while they eat, refusal to separate our bills. We also got charged a cake cutting fee of $25 which was not told to us when we gave our cake to them. We were a group of 10 so cake cutting fees are a little unheard of unless you're booking the entire venue or in large, large groups. Worse was, they did not cut our cake. We had to do it ourselves AND serve it to ourselves. They gave us soup spoons for the cake? They ended up waiving our cake cutting fee at least.
Would not come back for food. For a bar event maybe. If the staff learns to be a bit friendlier."}
