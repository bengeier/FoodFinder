{"text":"Well, I would like to say that it was impossible to get something positive out of my experience at Osteria.  Attention: Overall decent and the reason for the only star.  Price: Expensive in relation to the portions and the mediocre taste of the food.  Quallity: It cannot get worse than a cold pasta and bad bread.  Size: Ridiculously small.  Hope this information can help you make a wise decision steering clear of this place."}
{"text":"Warning out-of-towners...do not try to get to this place in the dark!  It is literally on train tracks!  Our car got stuck on the unmarked tracks - a bunch of well meaning but unhelpful folks came out to tell us \"it happens every week\" and then shout conflicting advice.  After it was all over, we had popped a brand new tire, kids were traumatized and my husband ate his cold scampi in the hotel.  A moment to forget - we will never return to this part of Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing food! I would highly suggest the pizza or pasta. I would recommend their salads as well. Their meatballs are HUGE. This place has true Italian and their presentation is perfect! Everyone needs to come eat here! PS: Sorry for the seemingly empty pictures, went late at night on a Thursday."}
{"text":"Osteria is my family's favorite restaurant.  They serve delicious, well-made Italian food, the atmosphere is casual and unassuming, the prices are incredibly reasonable, staff is nice and the service is good.  The restaurant has never been crowded for us when we dine early in the evening, so with all that, it's very family friendly.  My young daughters even enjoy dining here, and they are pretty picky eaters.  We've always enjoyed the riccolina, gnocchi and pizza."}
{"text":"Disturbing! My husband and I along with friends decided we would try Osteria 2350 on a Friday night.  It was open and airy, not too loud.  We were able to be seated right away with our table overlooking the staff preparing the food.  The waitress was friendly, serves was ok, and the food was fine, nothing special. What really stood out was one of the employees preparing the food behind the counter had a BIG SWASTIKA tattoo on his arm.  Hey, I believe you can have whatever tattoo you choose, but it's probably not good for business to have your employees parading their neo-Nazi believes in your customers face."}
{"text":"In sum, the food was ALMOST okay. Save  your dough, order take-out SOMEWHERE else in Pittsburgh. I consider the pasta dishes along the lines of Pizza Hut. Basically,  it is bland and an insulting misrepresentation of Italian food.  I struggled to rate this. I considered giving them a 3. Merely based on the fact, the pasta they do not prepare in-house, the Fede pasta is local. Fede pasta is a pasta company located right outside the city of PGH. However, giving them a rating ONLY based on something they happen to carry and do not actually \"make\" seemed too gracious.  Can I also say what a major pain it is to have to get up from my table to walk to the other side of the restaurant in order to read the wine list.  Someone cannot type one up or use an etch-a-sketch? ((Yawns. This place very much underwhelmed me))  Overall, the establishment did not put much effort into a pleasant dining experience therefore, I will not put much effort into writing a review. I would not recommend anyone to eat here and I will not be returning."}
{"text":"So I have been here before at lunch with clients and I really enjoyed it. It is very convenient and parking is a snap. All previous meals were good food but things must change for dinner time.   The music was way too loud and we could barely have a conversation. Service was just off the mark... Not to mention the server looked like they forgot to shower and rolled right out of bed.  They were out of multiple items!!! Their soup was unavailable as well as the clams. It's had to make the suggestion for a substitute which they did. But why does the customer have to come up with this idea.   It was sat night and there were very few people in the place. So not sure why it took an hour for salads. And then a long wait for food.   Bad service with under seasoned food. Server never asked for drink refills.   This place just missed the mark. With so many new places and great food... Service has to be top notch or you won't last long in the burgh."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza and ceasar salad. The lettuce was old and the Pizza was awful. Reminded me of middle school cafeteria pizza. Get it together Osteria...."}
{"text":"I guess the best way I can describe this place is underwhelming. My dad had the margherita pizza and he said it was good. I had the Chicken Parmesan and was disappointed in the portion. It was one hockey puck sized piece of chicken and a cup of spaghetti. The pasta though was fresh and delicious--the best part of my meal.   It's an industrial looking space--concrete floors and exposed duct work; it makes for a very noisy atmosphere. It was hard to have a conversation across the table."}
{"text":"A group of coworkers decided to venture over to Osteria on Monday for a quick easy lunch. Quick, nor easy was on the menu for today's special. Several of us ordered meatball subs, one a salad and soup and the other a prosciutto sandwich. The bread for the sandwiches were hard as rock. The meatballs were just ok. The meat to cheese veggies ratio on the prosciutto was way out of proportion. No balance at all. One diner had to send her soup back as it was off the charts too salty. She also requested no dressing on her salad, yet the salad came out drenched in dressing. Even too much for someone who enjoys dressing directly on the salad. On top of the sub par food, the service was even worse. The waitresses that work there seem entitled and elite. Not attentive to the customers needs at all. Had to ask for refills on soda and water also had to go to counter to discuss the salty soup. I am not one to swear off restaurants, cause I understand everyone has a bad day every once in awhile. But this is a common theme at Osteria. As a side note, the quality of food for the price is not equivalent. There are too many other better options in the Strip to waste time and money at Osteria."}
{"text":"A Saturday night at 7:30 and we easily made it in for a nice, relaxing meal.  I'm surprised this place isn't as packed as its sister Cioppino.  They share the same kitchen and sometimes have similar dishes.  But Osteria is always less expensive for the almost the same dish.  It has a classic bistro feel with the white subway tiles.  Their food has always been great here.  I have also taken a food and wine pairing class here that was very nice.  If you are going out in the Strip on a Saturday night and need a great meal without having to wait at Kaya, come to Osteria 2350."}
{"text":"We went to Osteria 2350 on a Restaurant Week Saturday evening. We chose the $20.18 Restaurant Week menu which had 2 parallel 3 course menu choices. We were delighted with the offered selections and surprised by the even kitchen execution. Beet, squash & goat cheese over arugula and butternut squash bisque were excellent openers. My pork tenderloin main was fork tender and tasty and my partner loved her Cod Franchaise! Nutella nut tart and vanilla creme brulee were delicious finales. The $15 wine trio was high level with nice pours and our server, Melissa, was delightful and attentive to our needs. We were impressed enough to go back to see if they have a consistent product."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I ate here for the first time last night and were both so happy with our experience that we agreed one of us had to write a review. We made reservations, though it wasn't crowded for a Saturday night. I'm assuming that's due to the the fact that the entrance is on a back street, not Smallman Street. Our waitress, Jen, was friendly and prompt. We ordered the antipasta plate as an appetizer, which was servered with bread and oil as well. My girlfriend ordered the gnocchi and I ordered the ricotto gnudi, both were delicious. We split a slice of baklava cheesecake and chocolate gelato for dessert.  We were both particularly pleased with the fact that our server held our next courses until we were finished with our current one. We've both eaten at upscale restaurants where they practically throw courses at you back-to-back in an effort to get you out in as little time as possible. It was a small touch, but it really made an impact. In total, we had two drinks, one appetizer, one salad, two meals, and two deserts for a reasonable $70.  Needless to say, this is my new favorite restaurant and we'll both be going back soon."}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoyed lunch here yesterday! Everything is very fresh and most items are homemade! My husband had the pasta and pork belly which was very tasty! Who can complain about fresh pasta?!?! I had the meatball sandwich! Delicious!!! The bread was amazing! Oh and the homemade mango sorbet... Soooo good! Great, low key environment! Really reminds me off a great, European sandwich and pizza shop! The staff is attentive and kind too! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I've been to Osteria twice now. Once to grab a sandwich for lunch, and then to get a takeout pizza for dinner. I've really hoped this place would be good as I live across the street. My experience has been mixed. Sandwich was a very good Italian deli sandwich. Pizza was mediocre though. While the pizza had the unintended positive effect of reminding me of free pizza consumed when I was in grad school in NYC that's not the best sign of quality. Not bad but could be better.   There's a lot of potential for Osteria and I hope they succeed. Maybe a weekend brunch would be a good addition? And make pizza less like basic takeout pizza and more \"fancy\" (tasty too)."}
{"text":"We were told to check out the Strip district and after driving around quite a few times and not being able to decide on a spot or find parking, we noticed the sign for Osteria near the market. And Thank Goodness we did!! We may have been hungry, but the food far exceeded our expectations! The soup - a white bean and prosciutto - was perfectly flavored; salty and peppery and delicious all over. I do wish it would have come out a tad warmer - that may have been an issue of the large shallow bowl it was served in. A very unique presentation of the prosciutto in the soup - very well executed. My friend enjoyed her spaghetti and meatballs, which I sampled and found very tasty myself.  I immensely enjoyed the cavatelli! There are few words that can describe how scrumptious this dish was! Velvety, rich pasta perfectly cooked with brussel sprouts and salty pork. Amazing!! The bread was nice and fresh. The service was nice and attentive. I would return if I am ever back in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"This restaurant is lovely, a true hidden gem of the strip district. I came here for a dinner meeting and was surprised by how empty it was, but this made it perfect for having a meeting over dinner at.  The service was great, very attentive.  I started with the lobster bisque, which was the soup of the day. It was not the typical lobster bisque, it had a much darker color and very deep flavor.  For dinner I had the carbonara and it was delicious and cooked perfectly.  I also tried a bite of the gnocchi and it was yummy as well. And oh so cheesy."}
{"text":"Wow...this is an amazing find! First, the location (near Strip District) and decor is top notch! On to the food...the beans and greens are hands down THE BEST I HAVE EVER HAD! The broth is delectable! Bread selection and olive oil for the table was so far above average it is hard to describe...nothing mundane about it. We also split the sausage stuffed pepper app and the flavors were just wonderful..with a nice kick too!  The table had the scallop entree special..fabulous! Carbonara...out of this world! Spinach and sausage over HOMEMADE wide pasta noodles...truly amazing..again with the magnificent broth! Our 4th had clams and mussels with linguine and he raved as well. The desserts are all home made as well. Great service and either the chef and/or owner visited our table. Great experience!"}
{"text":"Osteria is very casual with a laid back vibe and service style but the food is seriously delicious. Hand made pastas. Very Italian. My date says it's the best carbonara he's ever had. The prices for drinks and food are very reasonable. Desserts are carefully prepared and most excellent. I recommend Ossetia highly."}
{"text":"Still standing on the DO NOT ORDER PASTA HERE stance. But, I did try the Prosciutto Pizza and that was tasty so felt the need to bump up their review a star for that. Again, cannot emphasize that their pasta is not acceptable and if that's what you are looking for, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Shares the kitchen with Cippino, so Cippino quality for a fraction of the price. Food was delicious-pasta is freshly made and very good.   I got the baklava cheesecake for dessert and was disappointed, it tasted like a nut roll.   I came here with a big party so I expected to wait long for food and drinks to come out, but the server had our cards for well over 30 mins which was longer than I was expecting."}
{"text":"My wife and I shared the mussels and the calamari.  The mussels were out odd this world and the broth was exceptional.  She had the pappadell which was outstanding.  I had the ravioli,  which had a subtle heat that made it great! We will be back."}
{"text":"Ate here one night before going out while staying with friends that live nearby at The Cork Factory Lofts.  Exploring Pittsburgh was a blast, but Osteria 2350 was not one of the highlights.  The food was blah and nothing to write home about.  The low ratings from the 15 previous reviews are spot on.  Didn't know about the connection with Cioppino.  Might check that place out next time we are in town visiting.  We will not be going back to Osteria though."}
{"text":"A semi-large group of us, approx 12 people for lunch on Friday afternoon. A bunch of apps including a meat and olive plate, meat balls, stuffed banana peppers, and brushetta. All were good, although I didn't try the meatball. Brushetta was actually amazing. I got the chicken picatta, which I really liked. Coffee was good and strong and we had terrific service. Everyone enjoyed their lunch. Someone said the shrimp scampi was a bit spicy. That's about the only negative thing I heard and I like spicy food so 5*"}
{"text":"I am Italian and let me tell you something; this place blowed my mind! One of the few places where you can find good Italian food. I had the bruschette, the scampi shrimp and the meatballs to go! Omg! No kidding. Please come and try this delicious food :)"}
{"text":"Our Air B&B was next door to this place. We were greeted immediately when we entered. Our servers name was Imani. She was attentive, friendly and very helpful. We order wine ( the Pinot Noir and House Red) which were delicious. We ordered the chopped salad and the stuffed prosciutto, both were fantastic and good size for two to share. We split the Mac and Cheese and a Pizza. Both were so delicious! I am a mac and cheese lover and this one was one of the best i've had! For dessert, we shared the Baklava Cheesecake and vanilla bean ice cream. This dessert was out of this world. Who knew baklava and cheesecake combined would be so delicious! We will be back :)"}
{"text":"I dined here with my Bestie for the Chef's Tasting $28 on Valentine's Day 2017. The Menu was fresh and exciting!                     First Course White Bean Honey & Ricotta Crostini                   Second Course Citrus Poached Salmon & Strawberry                   Third  Course Elysian Fields Lamb Rahul                       Dessert  Hibiscus Mousse"}
{"text":"Decent food, great atmosphere, wish there is a train passing by the railroad outside the place ;) That would be more fun."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.  Cute place, quiet side street.  Service was attentive.  Previous reviews seemed pretty positive so we were excited to try it.  Caesar salad was blah, didn't taste like Caesar dressing.  No bread was served or even offered.  I ordered the chicken parm.  Chicken was good, but deep fried and nothing to write home about.  Hardly any sauce.  The spaghetti was extremely underdressed, stuck together with a heavy taste of flour.  What little sauce was there had absolutely no seasoning.  I had to ask for Parmesan for the chicken Parmesan!  My husband ordered the gnocchi, which qS so loaded with cheese it was almost inedible.  You had to peel the melted cheese away to find the gnocchi, which were very mushy.  Hardly any sauce just enough cheese to fill a dinner plate.  We left hungry and feeling slightly sick.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"The prices are great, $5 house wines, $12 large pizzas, and the food is good.  I had the lobster salad and my sister had the caesar.  The caesar was delicious and the lobster salad had a ton of lobster on it for $7, but tasted like straight white vinegar.  Overpowered the lobster and the greens it was over.  We also all shared the meatball side and it was okay, but was only ground beef and i like my meatballs mixed with other meats.  Our pizza took about 30 minutes to come out, we ordered a white pizza, which was delicious, but the chef came out and explained that the first one came out terrible so he was making us a new one, he took it off our bill, so that was nice.  The crust was amazing, I don't typically eat pizza crust, but I forewent the bread and dipped the crust in the delicious garlic oil that came out prior to the pizza with the bread basket.  All in all its a great atmosphere, great prices, and I will definitely go back to try the pastas and other dishes.  Our server was great too!"}
{"text":"Should've had the big-a** peanut butter cup in the dessert case. Coulda, shoulda, woulda...but didn't. Instead, I opted for the Warm Lobster Salad and Turkey Club. My bud Jesse ordered the Caesar Salad and Cavatelli.  Both salads were sad little guys.  The Lobster Salad has a LOT of potential though. The lobster itself was delicious, but the accompanying endive needed a lil' something else. His Caesar Salad was a little embarrassing to bear such a name.  It was romaine, period.  The good news is, the bread basket was fresh and complemented by a delightful olive oil, parmesan and herb-infused dipping combo.    Onto the main courses: My turkey sandwich was decent, but uneventful.  At $7 it wasn't grossly overpriced, but a little too much.  Jesse's Cavatelli was definitely the highlight of all things Osteria.  It was unique and delectable; nestled in a nice broth and shaved cheeses.  Yum.  All things considered, I'm not sure it's worth a trip back (save for that peanut butter cup).  The atmosphere is a really nice \"casual classy, \" but there are just too many other awesome options in the 'Burgh!"}
{"text":"On a pleasant evening, the outdoor seating is great, because the street next to it gets almost no traffic. The service was friendly, and the red wines were mostly blends, but were tasty and affordable. The gnocchi was pretty good, as was the ricciolina. A little on the al dente side, but tasty nonetheless. One thing I was pleased by--the portion size was actually reasonable! Not gigantic. A cute place we'll try again."}
{"text":"This is my second time visiting Osteria 2350. Both times that I've visited, I've gone with a larger group. We've chosen Osteria because it's never crowded and you're always able to get a table, which is both good and bad.   If I could give this place 3.5 stars I would. I want want to really, really love it but there is something that's missing. However, we've always had a really pleasant experience there so I decided to round up to 4.  First and foremost, the service has been great both times we visited. Both servers were attentive and friendly. Though they do serve alcohol, we choose to bring our own wine. You are allowed to do so with a $8 corkage fee per bottle.  The basil olive oil and bread were fantastic! We also ordered some olives to snack on while we waited for our main dishes. I can't remember all of the entrees at the table, but I do remember we had carbonara, gnocchi, chicken Piccata, and chicken Parmesan. This is not the best Italian food you are going to get in Pittsburgh. They were all good, but were missing something that made them great. There was a TON of cheese on my gnocchi. With traditional Italian, you won't find that... but American-Italian always seems to overload with cheese so I'm used to that!  The portions were right on. I think a lot of people are used to being served Olive Garden-sized portions of Italian food, and that sets them up for disappointment if/when they eat traditional Italian-sized portions. We had enough room for dessert, which was all absolutely wonderful! We had a choco-taco (hello blast from the past!), an ice cream sandwich, and two types of cake. One was \"7 Layers of Sin\" and that was the favorite among the table.   Would I go back? Yes, I think so if it's convenient! I'm not going to make a point to rush back soon, but if I were in the area and craving Italian, this would do the trick."}
{"text":"Interested to find out that Osteria is owned by Cioppino (right next door).  But the service and food are inconsistent.  I like the prices here, the food is rather inexpensive, so you get a lot for your money.  We had a large party and waited a long time for our food, but Osteria was aware of that and they brought out a tray of free desserts.  They also did not charge one person for their beer.  So they are trying real hard to improve. Let's hope they can do better!  I ordered the seafood pasta.  It was okay, just not the heavy creaminess and rich flavor I was hoping for."}
{"text":"I don't quite get the ambience here -- it's part dive, part nouveau chic, part \"authentic\" Italian.    No big deal there, but I have a concern about the menu, which has cheese weaved into nearly every dish.  This is not a practice you find in Italy.  It's an American, and especially a Pittsburgh thing.  Enough with the cheese avalanche.  Still, I was able to find one salad and one entrée without.  Both were really, really good.  The sign of an artistic chef.  I just wished I'd had some choice.  I read some reviews here complaining about the portions.  These are normal sized portions, and very typical of real Italian food.  This is about quality, not quantity, and the problem is with 95% of other establishments that seem to think it's the other way around."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great atmosphere. They have unique desserts and the server was wonderful! The mac and cheese my friend had was delicious and I had the delicious risotto. Another friend a delicious flatbread. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Osteria is one of those hit or miss places.  We've had awkward interactions with the staff there on more than one occasion.  Once, the server didn't seem to know the menu very well and then another time a different server made it appear that we should've made a reservation, but then told us to sit anywhere we want as long as there wasn't a \"reserved\" sign on the table.  Just a bit weird.  We wound up sitting at the bar.  The food is okay for the most part.  Sometimes the pasta can taste overcooked.  We know it's made in house, so I'm guessing they just have \"off nights\"?  My husband loves their mussels dish.  His favorite part is sopping up all the sauce with the bread.  However, I'd steer clear of the pizza.  It's like eating pizza sauce and cheese on a saltine cracker.  It burns very easy and it's just not good.  Their pastry chef makes all the desserts in house. I will say that their tiramisu is delicious.  One last thing is that there isn't really a comfy seat in the place.  You're choices are either wooden benches, wooden bar stools, or aluminum chairs that look and feel sort of flimsy.  We are Strip residents, so we usually head over to this place once every couple of months.  It's not horrible, it's an okay place to get a meal in the Strip and the prices are pretty reasonable.  But, as I said before, it's hit and miss."}
{"text":"Splitting the difference with my verdict.   Tl;dr: meh. Might be a bit before I'm back.   The atmosphere: causal dining. Good vibes.   The food: the lobster bisque and the salads my group had were really good, the strong suit of of the establishment and the meal. The prosciutto flatbread was good as well, but the wild mushroom one had too much garlic (it seemed to have a full clove per slice). The other pastas drew positive notes from my group, but it's hard to mess up a tomato sauce base. Avoid the carbonara; it's bland and lacks enough of a peppercorn kick, was too runny and unnecessarily supplemented with peas."}
{"text":"Yum!   We went to Osteria 2350 on a Monday for restaurant week.   Restaurant week is a mixed bag for me.  You'd think it would be a chance for restaurants to show their stuff, but I find that most just \"phone it in\" with watered down menus that they can turn over quickly - especially the ones with the $20.17 menus.  Therefore, I was pleasantly surprised when Osteria 2350 really shined.  The meal was delicious from start to finish and I enjoyed every bite.   We started with a glass of $5 happy hour wine and then did the restaurant week menu.   Here's what I had.     Stuffed Mission Figs with gorgonzola, prosciutto, and aged balsamic.  So this dish was a tiny little starter.  I was initially a little worried that I'd end up hungry based on its size, but it was delicious and well paired with the wine.  A nice start to the meal.         Wood-Roasted Hanger Steak with cauliflower mash and smoked apple and onion demi glace.  This steak was perfectly cooked and melted in my mouth - which is no small feat for a hanger steak.  The steak had a ton of flavor and really hit the spot.   The sauce and the cauliflower mash were perfect compliments and the red wine added a little something too.   The dish was not large, but not small either - just right.    Cannoli Panna Cotta - house made cannoli shell, Grand Marnier-sweetened mascarpone and ricotta cheese, chocolate shards, and pistachio paste   This dessert was pretty and so yummy.  It was just the right amount of sweet with varied textures and a smooth finish.   It was served with a sherry that tasted like cough syrup to me; but I don't really like sherry, so that might have just been me.      Overall, the meal was very well done for the $20.17 and the $15 wine pairings were worth it.   Even though I didn't like the sherry, the two reds were very good and the pours were reasonably sized.  Service was swift, but not rushed.  Parking is validated.   What's not to like?"}
{"text":"I so wanted this to be good.  My parents were in Pittsburgh and I suggested this as a spot to meet for lunch since it's close to my office.  A first time visit for all three of us.  I was going to order soup and a salad but the waitress informed us that they were out of the buffalo mozzarella, tomato salad.  Considering that's one of my top ten favorite dishes and sometimes I even make it for myself for dinner, I was a little disappointed I couldn't order it.  The three of us opted to order the soup de jour, broccoli cheddar and split a plain pizza.    The soup was fairly thick and cheesy and had big chunks of broccoli.  As veggie and cheese lovers, my Mom and I thought it was very good.  The pizza, on the other hand, was terrible.  It was a thin crust but it had been over cooked so the bottom was black.  It honestly never should have made it out of the kitchen because it put a terrible taste in our mouth (literally and figuratively).  Also, it felt like the wait for the pizza was very long and ended up not being worth it.  Having said that, the waitress did the right thing and ended up not charging us for the pizza.  While that seems like the obvious thing to do, I've been to plenty of places that have served an awful meal and not offered to do the right thing, so kudos to Osteria and I'll give you a second chance because of that.  I thought the atmosphere in here was great.  High ceilings, open space (very loft like) with an eclectic mix of tables and chairs and a counter if you want to opt for a quicker lunch.  I also thought the prices were very reasonable."}
{"text":"I got the warm mozzarella appetizer and the mushroom pasta dish... Not very good.  The mozzarella appetizer was good for the price but i would have to say that my pasta with mushroom and truffle oil was gagtastic. I seriously do not know why it tasted that way, but it got me nauseous and was extremely watery!  Probably never coming here again.... sorry!"}
{"text":"Went there last night for my wife's Birthday. Nice, quiet, off the beaten path of the Strip.  Meals were fresh and on point. App and salad were also perfect.  Nice selection on the menu, would almost think u were in Italy. Full course meal for 3 under 100.00. A first on this trip from Florida. They also validate parking in the attached garage. Totally satisfied. Will return often. Only downside was the Rock Music playing in the background."}
{"text":"It was Darren's turn to pick a place to eat so we came to Osteria, both of use with huge appetites. I looked over the rather limited menu and didn't really see much that appealed to me, but if something contains peppers, mushrooms, or raw tomato I will NOT eat it. So I finally narrowed it down.   The friendly server brought us a colored glass bottle containing water before taking our order. She then presented us with a metal basket containing 2 different varieties of Italian bread and a yummy oil and herb dipping sauce. If you don't know much about Italian (or French) bread, it has a rather hard crust and deliciously soft center. I think the bread, while flavorful, would have been better served warm, but that is personal preference. Oh, and the iced tea is fresh brewed and unsweetened, not that powder/syrup crap.   My chicken soup was the best item that I ordered on this occasion. The meat was just ok, but the vegetables were fresh tasting and cooked to perfection. Not mushy at all, and with just a very slight crunch. The chicken broth also had a nice flavor.   I settled on the rigatoni, and was rather disappointed. The sauce was very thin and the pork was, I don't know what, but it didn't taste very good. The noodles were not bad tasting, and the sausage absorbed the flavor from the pork, which again I didn't like. Salt and pepper didn't even fix the blandness. The best part of the dish was the huge scoop of ricotta cheese on top. It helped mask the lack of flavor.   My dessert consisted of an individual coconut cream pie. The pre-made crust nice and flaky, the coconut cream sweet, and topped with whipped cream. I couldn't finish the pie as the sweetness was just a bit too much for me, but again, preference.   Over all impression, I felt like I was visiting a friend's family for dinner and while the cooking wasn't appealing, I ate what I could to be polite. The family, however, is sweet as the pie they served."}
{"text":"Osteria isn't high end or innovative, nor does it pretend to be.  What you do get is reasonably good homemade pasta at a reasonably good price.  The atmosphere is kind of industrial cafeteria, so not the place you want to go for a romantic dinner.  If you want higher end Italian in a more intimate atmosphere with a better wine list there are other options in town (Dish, Jos Tambellini, Stagioni).  There are also a ton of run of the mill mom and pop pasta joints that have a loyal, older following and serve ridiculously large portions - Osteria is certainly a cut above these.  You just have to go in with the right expectations."}
{"text":"Popped in for a quick sandwich around lunchtime. I really dig the vibe of this place- casual but still chic. The ice cream options looked amazing- i would have tried the butter cashew and cherry merlot if there was more time. And they serve a nice variety of wines by the glass.   My turkey club, sans applewood bacon, was really nothing special at all. The bread was too dry and the turkey had nothing special to say. Pretty boring. I guess I was expecting more bells and whistles as some of the previous reviews were pretty rockin'. Perhaps this is more of a dinner place."}
{"text":"I've eaten here many times in the past during lunch. Typically the customer service is okay, food is good, but wait times are way tooo long. Today, I decided to order the Eggplant Parm sandwich. Because I don't do white bread I asked if I could it on wheat bread. We only have one type of bread here--white. So diverse. One of the specials was a fish sandwich with French fries so I asked if I could get fries instead of chips. After checking with someone behind the counter, the server said, \"No, we do not substitute.\" I should have left at that point, but my lunch time was ticking down. I ordered it anyway.   Surprisingly, the food was delivered pretty quickly. The sandwich was good, but the chips were only okay. I didn't finish them.   So a breakdown: food and service (4 stars), other nonsense with only having white bread and no substitutions (2 stars) = 3 stars."}
{"text":"Fantastic service, right price and great food. We had the pizza and salads and a nice glass of wine and that cost us less than $30. The waitress was also very pleasant. We were tired and hungry and they did the job."}
{"text":"Mixed review. The first time we came here, we ordered spaghetti and meatballs, and it was perfect: Perfectly cooked home-made pasta, good sauce, flavorful meatballs. We returned three weeks later with the same craving and we got overcooked pasta. I love their mussels in white wine though."}
{"text":"I can't get enough of Osteria! This casual Italian bistro has delicious made-to-order  meals in perfect portions. The menu changes seasonally and has amazing daily specials, so the meals are always fresh.  Osteria 2350 also has wine and beer on the menu to compliment your meal, and parking is validated for the on-site garage, so no need to worry about parking in the Strip!   This hidden gem located across the railroad tracks from the Cork Factory is a must try restaurant! Swing by for lunch or dinner and be greeted by a friendly and knowledgeable staff, and enjoy an affordable and authentic meal.   AND...Osteria 100 is coming in the Spring of 2012 to Point Park's Academic Village in Downtown, Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"To say that I am obsessed with their riccolina dish would not do how much I love it justice. I've ordered that pasta dish the last 7-8 times I've been there, no lie. It's so good! I don't know how they do it with the truffle oil, mushrooms, and arugula, but it is just oh so perfect.  I love the laid-back decor of Osteria; the simplicity of it all really draws me in. Outside of the riccolina, I would have to give a thumbs up to the warm tomato appetizer, the spaghetti and the rigatoni. They are all super delicious. Only one of the pasta dishes have we tried that I would recommend you pass on, though I can't recall it now (I think it was a special).  I also tend to like the bread they serve prior to your meal. Yummy.  The menu is not extensive (as every menu should not be), but the items they have are quite tasty as far as the pastas go. I've only ever sat at the bar and the bartenders at first came off as kind of cold, but then we realized they just weren't chatty. Which is weird when you're a bartender, but oh well. I like this place."}
{"text":"Continuing to visit the same good restaurants time and time again can get a little boring.  So I am trying to find different places to go, unfortunately I will not be going back to Osteria.  I should have known better when upon our arrival we were the first people other than the employees at 6pm.  A total of three tables had reservation signs, another two top and one four top.  All during dinner, no one, no one came in to eat dinner.  We ordered the mussels to start.  They were small and had a very fishy taste to them.  A couple of them were closed, meaning they are dead.  Overall they were some of the smallest mussels I ever ate.  My wife orders lobster ravioli and I ordered the house pappardelle.  The house made pasta was too thick, undercooked, and never married with the sauce like a good pasta dish should be.  Service was okay, though I did observe our server eating behind the counter.  The last dish my wife and I shared was shrimp and scallops which came in a small casserole dish.  The scallops and shrimp  dish was okay, beside being made with cheap small seafood.  Overall a very disappointing experience."}
{"text":"I wouldn't call myself a \"yelper\" as I don't normally feel the need to go out of my way to post a review about a place either good or bad. However, something about this place \"irked\" me enough to do so. I have been to this place now twice, and both times the service was not only unfriendly but I would say rude as well. The first time I was there, I was the only customer in the place after the lunch rush, and the server/cashier was annoyed and not helpful whatsoever about the menu. I had never been there before, so I asked a few simple questions and it was like I was bothering her. The second time I was there- same experience except this was a different server (male). When you walk in the place there is no direction as to whether you seat yourself, etc- being that there is a large order counter, one would assume you order there and sit down like a Panera, so that is very unclear. I intended to sit there and eat my meal there, however per the confusion my food was made to go, and i just took it and left rather than make a stink about it. Lastly, I would say the food is very lackluster and overpriced. I had the Chicken Salad Sandwich the first time, which was just OK. I order the gnocchi on my second visit and it basically had no flavor. It could be a good spot, the ambience is kind of cool, but between the service and mediocre food, I'll take a pass."}
{"text":"Great desserts but the wait staff leaves a lot to be desired. We want to like this place (live across the street in the Cork Factory), but after 3 tries, it may be time to just give up.  The last straw was simply trying to sit outside with my wife and have desserts. First, we stopped inside the door and told the waiter that came to seat us that we would just have dessert outside. We sat and waited without anyone coming outside to acknowledge us (not sure how long?). So I went back in the door and let the next person that came to seat me that we were sitting outside and just interested in dessert. A waiter came out 5 minutes later with water and dinner menus, so we again said we wanted dessert - to which he said he normally works next door at Cioppiono and would send someone else out with a dessert menu. After we had been sitting for 20 minutes, I went back inside and let the next person know it had been 20 minutes and all we needed was desert. So we got a second guy to come out with dessert menu, then they all disappeared again. After another 10-15 minutes without any sign of service, we just left.  Really, this is not that difficult! Why can't a simple service orientation be built here to create what can be huge customer loyalty with a huge active customer base living 1 minute away? It is an opportunity missed (more than once)."}
{"text":"This is an awesome place!  The food is wonderful!   We had the mussels for an appetizer.  They were great!  My husband had the ravioli & I had the papperdelle.  Both were outstanding!   We had a bottle of wine with dinner.  Then took back dessert.  I had the peanut butter cup with sea salt.   OMG  so good!  My husband had the baklava cheesecake.   Also so good!"}
{"text":"Headed down hill fast.  We used to love this place and gave it five stars.  Over the last few months something bad has happened.  While the selection is OK, the portions have dropped in size and quality substantially.  No longer a good value.  And - where have all the customers gone?  It is now mostly empty except a few tables here and there, even on nice evenings.  Last night we ordered a pizza.  They forgot to tell us they changed pizzas to single serving personal pizzas, but kept the same price.  (I'll post a pic)  20 minutes on the phone (mostly on hold) seeking an explanation was met with rude personnel and a request to email the manager and he'd send a gift certificate for a new pizza.  No thanks - It's been real, see ya."}
{"text":"What's great about this place? The atmosphere and the location.   What isn't great? We had very slow service, were told we were getting drink refills that never came. I've never seen so little soup for $4, I could see the bottom of the bowl when it came out. I thought the sausage in the soup would be flavorful but it was quite bland.   My coworker ordered a full salad and got a much smaller portion than should be expected for a main course. And the pizza is a complete embarrassment, looked like it came right out of a grocery store freezer and tasted like it, too. You should think that a place like this would have great Italian sandwiches, but another coworker remarked that it tasted no better than what's available at your generic pizza place.   I definitely won't be coming back, despite frequenting this area often for work lunches and to visit friends."}
{"text":"Ehhh....I'm gonna give them a 3, a high 3, since I felt the entrees Kay and I ordered were too flawed to warrant a stronger rating. We came here prior to the Dio Disciples show at Altar Bar the other night (Hey, Ronnie Dio was Italian after all), and being that it had truffle oil in it, I just had to sample the Riccolina, truffle oil being something I'd been dying to try for many years.   Fede pasta is a peculiar, long, fat macaroni that is solid instead of hollow inside. In this instance, it was al dente but had no flavor, the truffle oil failing to permeate the pasta. The arugala, however, absorbed it beautifully.   What does truffle oil taste like? I'd describe it as a really robust olive oil. It's wild like an aphrodisiac or something taken from the pheremonal gland of a fantastical creature. I.E. I enjoyed it but realize that it either attracts or repels. Back to the dish itself...  The broth that collected at the bottom, something which also carried the truffle oil flavor fairly well, made me wonder if this was supposed to be a pasta dish or a soup. The caramelized mushroom chunks merely loitered.   Not that the Riccolina was terrible, it's just that the truffle oil and arugala were the only things going for it. In fact, it was so lacking in flavor, I did something I rarely do at a restaurant since I feel it should be done before service; I used a salt shaker.   My salad and dessert, on the other hand, both saved the evening, sort of.   Wouldn't you know I ordered the Tomato and Mozzarella salad also? And wouldn't you know that it was a winner? The fresh mozzarella discs should be given out for Holy Communion as they were seraphic, delicate, \"lighter than air\" like the wizard in the Dio-era Rainbow song \"Stargazer\"...   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIdxjegXKSw  The cubed tomatoes were fresh from a garden tended by a careful farmer as they were ideally ripe, juicy, berry-sweet, and dressed with a supradelectable house vinaigrette.  Each of our desserts were quality homemade creations. Kay had an individual coconut cream pie that was a flaky basket of custardy, whipped-up delight. My post-meal treat was a rich Cookies And Cream cake that held an Oreo cream filling and was topped with a fab, fudgy ganache, making it the most luxurious lunchbox pastry ever created.  Kay wasn't crazy about her Rigatoni, and after tasting the dishwater sauce, it was easy to see (taste?) why. Although, the sausage that wallowed in that sauce had a tenderness and savoriness that was beyond belief.   The complimentary bread was also noteworthy as it came with a spice-infused olive oil for the bread to soak up famously.  Alyssa, our server, was attentive and polite. The decor was akin to a modern, swanky deli, and overall, the atmosphere was quiet, especially for the teeming Strip District.   P.S. I came very close to ordering a sandwich.  P.P.S. My dinner, aside from sampling the meat in Kay's dish, was unwittingly vegetarian. Good on me.  P.P.P.S. I finally got to review #666! This is cause for celebration!  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eML6X8VfAfY"}
{"text":"Opted to try the pizza take-out option at Osteria 2350 and loved it!  12\" hand tossed pizzas with the perfect ratio of cheese to sauce.  The dough is crisp but not overly done.  I added arugula, ricotta and prosciutto to my pie and each ingredient was fresh and delicious.  As strip district resident these pizzas are worth the walk (or drive) two blocks for the freshness of this pizza.  Can't wait to return and try out the full menu in the dining room!"}
{"text":"Wonderful find along the strip district! Great service and food! Can't wait to come again! Our group had pizza, asparagus salad, carbonara, gnocchi, risotto, and a variety of desserts. Everything was fantastic!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had an amazing late lunch here today! We both had the same items.  We started with the asparagus salad. It was so fresh and lightly dressed that the flavor and crunch of the greens came through;  we also had the eggplant parmesan sandwich.  It was served on a round homemade bun with homemade potato chips on the side. Perfectly prepared and more than filling! The service and staff were very friendly and accommodating.  Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Fairly busy place that is a little hidden.   Food was great but nothing really special.  TO be fair, I did order a turkey club which was a turkey club.   It is sort of neat how they reuse wine bottles as water pitchers.    Staff was friendly although there was a small mix up on the order at the table but it was quickly remedied."}
{"text":"Quite simply the most tender and well cooked Chicken Parm I have ever had. My wife had the Gnocchi and loved it as well.  Bread was delicious as well. Server said it was a garlic crusted and we couldn't stop eating it. No room for dessert even though it looked delicious. Server (Austin) was very attentive the entire time"}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place for awhile having walked past it and working in the Strip awhile back. Came here for Galentine's Day with 6 other friends and had a reservation. The service was friendly and the place itself has a nice ambiance. However, that's pretty much where it halted for me. The greens and beans we ordered came with arugula and asparagus and were very skimped on the beans. It also did not taste like regular greens and beans, which if you are familiar, you know has a ton of escarole, beans, and parmesan. I also tried \"Odin's Muse\" for a cocktail and was not a fan at all. A very very odd aftertaste. I got the chicken parm and was completely underwhelmed with the lack of flavor. It tasted like someone tossed the pasta with old laundry water. :(    I would not choose to come back here unless they made some improvements on flavor."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Wonderful food, reasonable price (10-15), quick service, great decor and pleasant staff!"}
{"text":"Osteria 2350, how have you been hidden from me for so long?!  Oh that's right, because you've sadly been hidden behind the empty store front of Right by Nature in the Strip.  But one title this place can hold is hidden gem...because it really is!    It's part restaurant part Italian deli with fresh meats, breads and desserts to pick up.  Me and a friend came in all business....which meant we were ready to eat!  And boy did we ever!  We enjoyed 3 full courses because everything sounded so incredible!  August is the month to take advantage of any sort of tomato salad, so I enjoyed a tomato and moz salad with just the right amount of balsamic dressing.  It was FRESH FRESH FRESH!    But let me tell you the key to being good friends.  The key is to pick two main courses and split them.  The best of both worlds!  We choose the gnocchi and the Riccolina.  The Riccolina had this Fede pasta in it that I had never tried before.  It was really awesome!  I'm an al dente type of girl and these were cooked just right!  It also came with caramelized mushrooms, truffle oil, arugula and parm    The gnocchi was the real winner for me...it had a medium texture between a light and heavy gnocchi.  I'm usually a fan of the light kind but I think it was the combo of sauce and cheese that won me over on the whole dish.  It was perfecto!    We also enjoyed the Tiramisu for dessert.  It wasn't the best I've ever had (that's at Piccolo Forno in Lola) but it was still pretty good.    The service was fantastic as well, with our server answering all questions we had (like the very important, how big are your dishes) and she answered the questions perfectly.    I'm now a complete fan of this place and can add it to the top of my Strip District list.  You all for sure need to go there...I'm excited to try a dinner there soon....remember...true friendship means splitting two main dishes!"}
{"text":"This is the third time I have eaten at Osteria 2350.  Located next to Cioppino in the Strip District.  A parking garage is handy since on street parking is rare to find.  The tables are not squeezed together which makes conversation less intrusive.  Our service is timely, pleasant and not overly hovering.  The menu is not large but offers appetizers, salads, sandwiches and entree.  I enjoyed greatly the asparagus, arugula salad.  The asparagus was cooked perfectly, and dressing just right lemony and parmesan.    Hands down the beans and greens are THE BEST, in town.  Abundant beans cooked to a nice al dente texture, generous greens in a delicious garlic sauce.  This place is a winner."}
{"text":"Out and about in the Strip District, and we decided to have a late lunch/early dinner at Osteria. Due to the non-peak time, we were the only ones in the restaurant and chose to sit at the bar.   The bartender was very nice, though not up to speed on the beer info. The samples, however, were very healthy.   We ordered the meatball and a pizza (1/2 pepperoni, 1/2 mushroom. The meatball had a kick to it, and we appreciated the real Parmesan! The pizza was overloaded with cheese, so I ordered a side of sauce to go with. The sauce was super bright, but it was needed to balance out the amount of cheese on the pie.   After our meal, I asked for a taste of their homemade chocolate brownie ice cream. Thanks to the bartender for the healthy sample of that, too :)  I don't think we'll be back to this place, as other locations for dining in Pittsburgh have wowed us a bit more."}
{"text":"After reading the bad reviews, I was really hoping they were wrong.  Unfortunately they weren't.  DH & I came here on a Saturday afternoon after we did some shopping in the strip.  The place has a nice interior, but was completely empty.  The service was good, prompt and friendly.  Although it would be hard to imagine it could be bad since we were one out of 3 other patrons there.  I started my meal off with the  Arugula salad - arugula, roasted peppers, balsamic vinaigrette, Gorgonzola.  It was good, and tasted fresh.  It wasn't huge though, although I expected that since the price tag was $3.  DH got Cavatelli  with house made pasta, roasted carrot, eggplant, squash puree.  The pasta was totally overcooked and lacked any good flavor, although it looked tasty.  I ordered the Riccolina - fede pasta, caramelized mushrooms, truffle oil, arugula, Parmigiano Reggiano.  The fede pasta was just weird.  It was thick and heavy, and didn't take up any of the flavorful broth.  The only thing I liked about this dish was the arugula, Parmigiano Reggiano and the truffle oil/broth.  The mushrooms were odd and definitely didn't taste like they were caramelized.    I don't think I'll be back here again, very disappointing."}
{"text":"This is quite possibly the worst food I have ever received from a place that delivers.  I read the other reviews and maybe the difference is that you actually have to go there.  I detailed everything we ordered so that you don't make the same mistakes that we did.  7 Items  1 Mac n' Cheese  $14.00 1 Shrimp Scampi  $17.00 1 Apple and Bleu Flatbread  $10.00 2 Meatball  $2.50 1 Bruschetta  $7.00 1 Baklava Cheesecake  $5.00 1 Mocha Pie  $6.00  Mac n' Cheese - This was surprisingly the best thing that we ordered disregarding the desserts.  It was greasy and not much cheese but we could stomach it.  Definitely NOT worth $14 for the portion or the quality.  3/5 stars  Shrimp Scampi - This was without a doubt the worst item we ordered.  The pasta appeared to be reheated and gooey.  It was stuck together in one large clump that we could not separate.  We had to use a knife and fork to \"slice\" it apart.  It was bland and disgusting.  I think there were (6) 16 count tail on shrimp with no seasoning.  They were cooked (Thank the baby Jesus that they got that right) but there was hardly any butter/garlic sauce to be found.  Also NOT worth $17.  1/5 stars  Apple and Bleu Flatbread - My fiancee wanted to try this and said it was OK.  The apples were raw and didn't go well with the rest but unlike the rest of our order it was fairly edible.  3/5 stars  Meatballs - We got two of these to split.  They were dried out balls of meat that seemed to be reheated.  I ate an entire one and regretted it immediately afterwards.  The fiancee threw hers out because it was also nasty.  1/5 stars  Bruschetta - This was tasty but the driver must have rolled his car down a hill on the way here.  The bruschetta was tossed in with the bread so everything was jumbled and mixed together.  I'm sure this would be better in person without Evil Knieval delivering it.  3/5 stars  Baklava Cheesecake - Fiancee said this was tasty.  Not the best she had but also nothing like the other menu items.  We are guessing the desserts are made somewhere else or come frozen. 4/5 stars  Mocha Pie - I had a few bites of this and it was OK.  3/5 stars  My total bill was $80 for this horrible food.  It is NOT worth the money and our meals ran straight through both of us.  The good news about this place is that it will clean you out if constipated.  I cannot recommend based on this experience."}
