{"text":"Let me start by saying the atmosphere here is amazing, to the upbeat music, to being able to eat outside and the people who work here.. I've been here a few times, and everytime I come in I get helped but a young lady named Andrea, really sweet girl she's always good about her costumer service and always greets me with a smile. With me coming there I've never waited any longer then 10 mins when she's working and that right there is a great thing..  The shakes and food overall are really good, I love the shakes and the food omg really good as well.. I will be coming back thanks"}
{"text":"Healthy eating, muscle building/replenishing and healthy energy formulas....this is the place to come."}
{"text":"Seriously the best health source in Vegas! I'm from oc California and wish they had this here... Puts all California places like this to shame! The most fresh food and everything is freshly cooked daily. Steak lovers bowl is to die for!! I'm coming here everyday for my stay. You won't regret coming here! Love this place!"}
{"text":"I seriously do love this place. After the first bad experience I had from this place, I wrote a review on here. The manager got back to me and was extremely helpful and kind. That was the kind of customer service that I was looking for. I gave it a bad rating initially due to customer service but, after the manager reached out to me, I felt much better about coming back to this place.   The place is delicious. Food and smoothies. I love the peanut butter smoothie. After the gym, the food here doesn't make you feel heavy. It is not greasy and although it is healthy food, it tastes amazing. I seriously recommend people come and try it."}
{"text":"I really like the location on Grand Canyon. They've always been consistent and I've always left pleased. Today I went to the location on Durango and didn't know if I wanted to laugh or complain the entire time. I walked in and wasn't greeted by anyone. I stood at the counter for 2 minutes and watched everyone. A young man even came out from behind the counter to get himself water. I said hi and he didn't even look my way. After a few minutes I was able to order. When they brought my food out.. My salmon was the size of a lemon wedge. Literally. I ordered a protein shake as well and didn't receive it until right before I left. The gentleman who made it for me apologized for my wait. So I can live with that. But not the best experience I've had to say the least."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place! I visit the protein source way too often for my own good, but don't feel guilty doing so. The staff is always so kind and willing to offer suggestions. I'm a creature of habit so every time I visit i get a salmon bowl with brown rice and avocado. There are few things I love more in this world than their salmon. It's always fresh and prepared perfectly. Today i went out on a whim and decided to try the vegan chilli as well. I love places that offer meat-less alternatives because its just not a luxury you come across everywhere you go. I have to say, the chilli definitely gives the salmon a run for its money. Also, if you stop by you have to try one of their vegan cookies!! They have a few flavors but the original chocolate chip is my favorite. One of the staff members recommended it to me and I can honestly say i prefer them to normal chocolate chip cookies because theyre not as sweet.  I love that they have an outdoor seating area, although i haven't exactly utilized it yet. And i like that everything is always neat and tidy. I personally think the prices are reasonable.  At the end of the day, you get what you pay for and I don't mind spending a little more money for great quality."}
{"text":"Heaven !!  There's no way you can find better healthy food on this planet..  Maybe i should try go on a trip to Mars..  Until then I'm going to enjoy every bite of my food ..  They have everything for everyone!!"}
{"text":"Love this place !!  Hands down, as a healthy food place they the best in business, food is amazing, staff very friendly and ambient welcoming  Deserves more then 5"}
{"text":"I love going to this place after kickboxing. Great menu choices that are super healthy yet filling and fulfilling. The perfect choice after a serious workout. The owners/managers are awesome too. I haven't had a \"bad\" choice yet off their menu. Love the Source Protein Pancake and the chili is bomb too."}
{"text":"Excellent!  I stumbled upon this gem while looking for a healthy dinner. Wow!  I am so happy j did!  The seared tuna was cooked to perfection, very fresh and the vegetables were delicious. No hormones, antibiotics, and non-GMO. everything b is cooked fresh to order!    Doesn't get any better than this!!!"}
{"text":"It's right next to the gym so you can get those good as a mofo post workout meal Gainz, it's the only place that serves Elk I believe, the owner Claudio is cool as a fan and all friendly and stuff and the food is never dry or sub-par. EAAAAAAT IIIIIIIITT!!!!"}
{"text":"The food is good, but the attention to customer service is lacking..they constantly do not read the notes on the order for changes to shakes, meals ect. Ive even called them about this, and they messed up the next day. When someone is continually paying for your product, make sure you get it right. Service is everything."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Healthy is the new way of life! Great customer service! Love it! Recommend this place for those who are eating that healthy lifestyle!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots, I could literally grab lunch here everyday. The Lean Mean Ahi Machine bowl is my shit. Fresh and healthy food, quick service."}
{"text":"I believe I went to a different location, but I really enjoyed my experience! The place was spotless, and my friend and I both enjoyed the protein shake that we split. We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not one to write bad reviews and I hate complaining but something has to be said. I love the food but the staff is a whole different story. I have been to the new Durango location 5 times now and 4 out of the 5 times they have messed up our orders. It's as if they were never trained on how to do their jobs. There's no process to how they do things there. They have messed up too many times now so I have to say something. I was in line to order and a second cashier came up and asked the girl behind me what she wanted and completely ignored me, that same day my order was wrong. Another time they gave 3 people that ordered after me their shakes and food and forgot to make mine so I had to wait even longer to get my order. My girlfriend and I ordered together, I waited like 10 minutes for my food, was half way done eating and they never brought hers out. I asked them where her food was and they looked at each other like, I don't know, do you know? Shrugged their shoulders and said sorry will have to make it. Waited another 10 minutes. Come to find out, they gave another girl her order to go, the other girl's order was sitting at the counter in a bag, the other girl left and came back cause she realized she had the wrong order, they gave her the old order. I asked for no peppers on my wrap and they put peppers on the wrap. The food also seems to be made a little different each time. They messed up and gave us the wrong shake one time so they had to make another one. The last time I was there, I finally said something and the girl told me to come back in and she'd give me half off. That nice and all but you're telling me to come back in and give you more of my hard earned money. You guys screwed up and I shouldn't have to pay for your mistakes. To the owner: You should be really concerned about the day to day operations that go on in your stores cause you are losing lots of money when they mess up orders like this. There's no way I'm the only one who orders gets messed up. A mistake here and there is understandable but 4 out of 5 times in less than 3 months is not good. Get your staff and your processes in order. The staff isn't very friendly or apologetic either. They also need to be taught customer service skills. Once again, the food is great but if they mess up again, I will no longer go there to eat. We both lose out."}
{"text":"Great food, and great customer service. No matter what you may be in the mood for, it seems like they have it for you. They know how to make healthy taste really good. Definetly the best fit/healthy restaurant in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"*YAY SOPHIE!* I ordered through Postmates and the wrong order came. I quickly called protein source and although they did not have an in-house delivery service to get the correct order to me, Sophie was VERY helpful with offering other ways to make it up to me even though it was not their fault.   Postmates corrected the issue quick but Sophie was already on it for me! Thanks!!"}
{"text":"This place has the healthiest food around. I just did a build a bowl with chicken, broccoli, and cauliflower mash it was very clean and delicious"}
{"text":"Stopped here for a quick healthy lunch after yelping. Wow I am so glad I did. Had the California Cobb whole wheat wrap with feta cheese instead of the cheddar. Probably the best sandwich I have ever had. Will definitely go back every time I visit Vegas. Dressing on the salad and the wrap were excellent. Anton did a great job. My daughter took the build your own option and my wife had the berry filet wrap that had a sweeter flavor. All of us were very happy!!! Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Decided to try The Protein Source for the something different than Green's and Protein's and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised at their originality and quality. I was recommended the Californian Griller, and it was fantastic. You can taste the quality and unlike some health foods which are unpleasant or bland, this was flavorful, delicious and packed with protein to fulfill my post workout intake. I would recommend this to my friends any day of the week. Staff was very friendly as well, definitely going to be one of my favorite spots to eat at.   Thank you The Protein Source for your quality and customer service!"}
{"text":"This place was delicious. Stopped by after a workout to check out the protein shakes; pretty good. So I grabbed a Togo menu and my hubby decided he wanted to try it, so a couple hours later I was back. We had the steak lovers bowl and the power salmon bowl. Both are very delicious, lots of flavor and yet so healthy. I liked that they put the sauces on the side. The presentation was beautiful. Over all pretty good. I will most likely return."}
{"text":"Unique menu. Great taste and healthy. Love this place"}
{"text":"This place has really gone down hill... It's sad I use to come here all the time and I think this will be my last visit. The last 3 times my meal tasted different, my husbands bison burger was way over cooked along with my chicken... really disappointing."}
{"text":"Was in the area wanted to check this place out. Bad choice, slowest service ever a AOL dial up connection is faster than this place!!!! Doesn't take 20 min to make a protein shake. Only one person working counter, so pissed that they made a protein shake for the guy that ordered after me, but failed to make mine. First impression is everything... FUCK this place will never Eva Eva Eva go back there again... PISSED!!!"}
{"text":"Went to the protein source tonight for the 1st time. One word to describe my experience. AMAZING!!!!!!!!! From a warm greeting, to seeing the cook put great effort into my meal. I was greatly impressed. 10 stars needed! Will mos def recommend to all! GREAT JOB!"}
{"text":"The Protein Source has so much variety and healthy choices for meals.  I know people like to eat here after going to the gym but honestly it's a place to go anytime. It was a great experience and the food tasted amazing. I could tell the quality of the ingredients was great, and knowing that also made it a definite plus! Gotta try it!"}
{"text":"Best shakes. Counter girl looks like Shakira. Internet is blazing. I come here to get a good healthy meal and work.... Highly recommend."}
{"text":"So far I really enjoy the food here, it's delicious, healthy, and they are pretty quick. It's a little pricey when it comes to building your own meal as compared to Greens & Proteins (their neighbor across the lot) but there are more options to choose from. The one thing I do like is that their sweet potato mash (huge portion) is like real sweet potato unlike at G&P it seems less condensed? If that makes sense. Their stevia bbq sauce is also delicious with the bison (Their bison portion is smaller than G&P) and elk. Haven't tried much YET, but this is definitely my new preference. One thing I would probably recommend - they probably have this option and I haven't asked yet - is to have some steamed veggies. They've only been open for a couple of months but it's definitely worth the try!!"}
{"text":"I love the protein source!!!! One of my favorite places to go. Always a great experience when I dine here. Exceptional customer service!!!!"}
{"text":"I waited until my second visit to leave a review - it was a delicious first experience, don't get me wrong. However I needed to see how they were going to respond to my feedback about my first experience before a review was in order.  The staff is very nice and knowledgable and the owner was kind as well. The atmosphere was casual and comfortable; I really like the outdoor seating area.  Now the important part... The first time I had the California Chicken Cob wrap (wrapped with cabbage to make it low/no carb). It came with a delicious side salad.   The second time I had the source burger served on an oat bun; the bison was cooked PERFECTLY!!!!!  The turkey bacon with the avocado and cheese was great and the asparagus was a great addition.  I went with the sweet potato hash as my side; it was delicious and I personally would have like it with smaller chunks of potato and a little more onion but over all a great meal.  All things considered I will surly be back!!!"}
{"text":"1/12 update - This is my 5th time now and I've brought some of the pickiest eaters on the planet ... All are coming back !  The bison, salmon, chicken and turkey all have received favorable feedback and I tried breakfast today .... Very satisfied"}
{"text":"Everything from the people who work here, to the food, deserve a 5 star rating. Favorites are the American Muscle bowl and Southwestern Turkey bowl. The foods are so tasty, it's hard to believe it's healthy and clean eating!"}
{"text":"Best food in town, eat in or take out.... I just did both. Lol. No other places deliver fresher and top shelf quality ingredients."}
{"text":"greatest burgers on the planet. .. really lean. .. an athlete's dream! if you're really hungry get the signature elk burger :)"}
{"text":"2 stars out of respect for anyone who opens up an eatery that influences everyone to eat healthier! the rest of the stars are missing because my food had a weird smell to it, and I've had an upset stomach all day. could have been a refrigeration issue. will try again, however."}
{"text":"Great tasting healthy food in a very clean, and nice restaurant. I met the owners and both were really nice and helpful. Good service!!!"}
{"text":"They seemed good at first but the pancakes tasted like tree bark dipped in vegetable oil"}
{"text":"Perfectly located in the LVAC parking lot. Healthy and delicious post-workout food. The restaurant was very clean and welcoming, the staff knowledgeable and friendly. If I could give the ahi salad more than 5 stars I would. Absolutely delicious"}
{"text":"The girl behind the counter was so helpful and nice. I ordered the salmon bowl with cauliflower mash and it was good. My hubby got a bison wrap and said that it was ok but he would not order it again."}
{"text":"Incredibly slow service. Great location but staff is incompetent. Their electrical plugs didnt work and I watched everybody who came after me get their food first. Need to hire new staff."}
{"text":"Convenient location, great customer service, and delicious food. Only bad thing I have to say about this place is it's very pricey (I got the Bison Bowl- which was amazing- but was about $16) You can definitely tell they use quality ingredients and it's super convenient after the gym when you don't have time to prepare your meals, but a little hard for me to spend almost $20 on a bowl for lunch."}
{"text":"Thank you Claude! Will be coming in again soon with my husband to enjoy the savory dishes and delicious juices!.. just waiting for some time off again.."}
{"text":"Love coming here when I don't feel like cooking, but don't want the awfulness of fast food.   I like the dance music they play, too!"}
{"text":"The Protein Source deserves an infinite amount of stars!! I'm so happy I stumbled into this place!! Best tasting, incredibly healthy, amazing service & just 15 minutes from the strip. It doesn't matter what you order, their entire menu is prepared the same way! You will taste the passion and the consistent quality in every bite! I'm so impressed with The Protein Source and I'm a client for life! My Vegas trips will always feature numerous visits here! Rare find!"}
{"text":"This prices are too high. I got the simple breakfast and it was sooo dry. I couldn't tell the difference between my toast and the sausage. The egg whites were awful and that sauce did not go with the food. Plus $3 coffee that was bad. Just leave and go to Starbucks"}
{"text":"Had a great experience here. Great customer service and food was awesome! The PB balls are dangerously good!"}
{"text":"Got the Skinny Salmon dish for $12.  Described as: \"Pan Seared Wild Caught Atlantic Salmon, Asparagus and Cherry Tomatoes Over Cauliflower Mash Topped w/Balsamic Reduction and Cilantro Pesto.\"  The pictures on the glossy menu look amazing. But that is where the number of good things I can say ends. The only barely edible part of the dish was the salmon, which was not the best quality, judging by taste. It should have read \"swimming\" in mashed cauliflower. Which would be okay if they had used ANY seasoning at all. It basically tasted like they boiled everything and dumped it in there. I didn't taste any cilantro or pesto. Just boiled paste and some balsamic. Sorry but yuck.   On service: Not \"unfriendly\" staff, but is that really what you aim for when you run a business?   I returned the dish minus the salmon after a minute and commented on how disappointing it was. \"Flavorless\" was the word I used. The girl I spoke to mentioned that they had a new cook and that she would talk to him. Not her fault obviously, but I don't think this dish was an \"oopsie.\" I feel like the owner/manager of this place is clearly not involved at all. I can't speak to the rest of the stuff they serve, but I really don't feel like giving them any more of my money to find out."}
{"text":"Wish I could review the food, but I waited 30min for a dine in order that I never received. I had to go up to the host and ask for my food a chicken sandwich with turkey bacon she gave me a sandwich in a to go box, and told me they were making the bacon. Which meant I would have to make my own sandwich. Got my money back and left, if the woman was honest and told me she messed up the order I would have waited but I watched her take apart someone's to go order (same order as mine with no bacon) and processed to try to convince me it was my order. No fair to me or the person who's order it belonged to."}
{"text":"Great food, clean facility, great atmosphere. And of course the food is packed with protein and made fresh. Have also had the bison wrap, delicious."}
{"text":"Manager reached out to me after having a horrible experience and welcomed me back to try this place again. The chef's do a really good job cooking all their meals here and the presentation is very appealing."}
{"text":"Our first time here; and we liked the huge variety of choices on the menu, but we disliked how expensive everything is. :( I ordered the light start breakfast w/ turkey sausage, in which the sausage was dry. My husband purchased the bison wrap, and it didn't have enough meat in it, instead, it was overfilled with chunks of sweet potatoes."}
{"text":"Deliciously fresh, great selection, I recently had a steak bowl with Broccoli and it was aaammaazzing!!"}
{"text":"This place is exactly what you would expect from the name, healthy options! When you arrive it's full of sunlight w/ a handful of tables inside and another handful outside. It's very clean which is a huge factor when going into any eatery, you never want to wonder. It sits in the same parking lot as the LVAC so you'll see tons of fitness people of all levels coming in for some sort of fuel. Protein Source offers a variety of healthy options. It is a fast food style ordering process where you go to the counter to order. They do however bring the food to you once it is ready. The day we came in to eat we were taken care of by Veronica. She was friendly and prompt.   We ordered: American Muscle (100% Pure American Bison Served Over Sweet Potato Hash, Source Veggie Mix (Broccoli Red and Green Bell Peppers, Yellow Squash and Zucchini) Then Topped Freshly Sliced Avocado and House Stevia BBQ Sauce)  Skinny Salmon Bowl (Pan Seared Salmon, Asparagus and Cherry Tomatoes Over Cauliflower Mash, Topped w/Balsamic Reduction and Cilantro Pesto)  Green House Juice (Kale, Spinach, Apple, Cucumber and Lemon) A,C,G Juice (Apple, Carrots and Ginger)  The juices came out quickly after we ordered. Veronica was running the register, making the juices and delivering the juices/food. She made it look flawless w/ ease as customers continued to float in and none waited to have their order taken. Once the food came out she brought us our food to which we scarfed down w/ delight. I'm not a huge health foodie, but I will admit when something health actually tastes good and man did this food taste good.  The whole experience from start to finish was a delight. If you're looking for something healthy AND tastes good, you're bound to find something at the Protein Source!"}
{"text":"Great food , it's hard to find a place that fits your macros and ur style of eating. Most restaurants if they are healthy, they taste like crap. But protein source is my favorite for pre and post workout meals"}
{"text":"I grab my protein shake here after hitting EOS Fitness. A bit pricey for a shake but worth splurging once in a while, especially if you're substituting your shake for a meal. Service is always great. The front line staff are always fast and friendly. Just wish they had some type of loyalty program."}
{"text":"The protein shakes here were pretty good but nothing special for what it's worth; $17 for two drinks?! That's more than how much gym membership at EOS Fitness next door costs per month! Crazy. Their protein brownies were very dry and lacked flavor, which is disappointing because they looked good. On a positive note, their actual food looks bomb plus the place has clean and contemporary decor that represents a natural, healthy lifestyle."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to come here for awhile to get my healthy eats on. Finally made that happen. I love their wide selection of food & drink options. Since I came w/ several people we decided to try a lot of food.  Protein waffle tower (One Whole Wheat Multi-Grain Protein Waffle Served w/Egg Whites or Whole Eggs, Turkey Sausage, Cheddar Cheese, Jalapeño Berry Jam, Sugar Free Syrup or Agave Nectar) - I love me some waffles, but sadly this wasn't up to par in my standards. The flavors didn't mesh well IMO. I ordered this, but only had a few bites.   Chocolate Chip Protein Pancakes (Whole Wheat Multigrain Chocolate Chip Protein Pancakes w/Topped w/Nutella Chocolate Chips, Protein Powdered Sugar and a Side of Sugar Free Syrup) - Probably the worst thing that is good for you on the menu. Everyone finished this shared plate.   American Muscle Bowl (100% Pure American Bison, Sweet Potato Hash, Source Veggie Mix (Broccoli Red and Green Bell Peppers, Yellow Squash and Zucchini), Topped w/Avocado and House Stevia BBQ Sauce) - This was another winner due to all the flavors that you get from this meal.  Ahi Protein Poke (Hawaiian Style Wild Caught Ahi Tuna Mixed w/Avocado, Green and Red Bell Peppers, Pineapple, Cilantro, Red Onion, Sesame Seed Oil and Sriracha Served Over House Made Agave Teriyaki Sauce) - these were def a hit w/ our group.  Salmon Salad Shooters (Fresh Cucumber Shots Topped w/Cooked Chilled Wild Caught Atlantic Salmon Tossed w/Yogurt, Tomatoes, Chopped Cucumbers, Red Onions and Lemon, Served w/a Side of Dijon Mustard and Cilantro Pesto) - yet another item that was a hit w/ our group.  Tropical Green (\"Blended\" Spinach, Kale, Mango, Pineapple & Banana) - SO GOOD! Beetphrodisac (Beet, Orange, Carrot, Lemon and Ginger) - Not my fav, but it wasn't what I ordered.  Green House (Kale, Spinach, Apple, Cucumber and Lemon) - Refreshing  W/ so many options to choose from you could come here every day for a month & still not have the same thing. It also caters to whatever type of diet you're on. Stop in to give them a try, you're gonna find something that's healthy, tasty and right up your alley."}
{"text":"First time at this location. I was in and out!  It was late so I didn't want anything heavy so I ordered the Mediterranean Quinoa Salad and Peanut Butter Protein Balls.  Both were amazing! They salad was huge! I didn't get to finish half of it. You can eat without the dressing and it still taste good.  The protein balls are bomb if you love PB like me.   Love this spot and will be back for sure to try their other salads!"}
{"text":"Amazing service! Donte helped me pick out things from the menu since it was my first time! Also tony made an amazing smoothie! Definitely will come back :)"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, clean and cool ambiance, with outdoor seating. Food is great: taste is good as far as the super health foods stuff goes (nothing extraordinary though) but you feel good after you eat so it's worth it, you know? Would recommend to a friend. I'm Paleo and felt comfortable and accommodated here. I got the Kale Bomb Salad with salmon and ahi tuna on it and the sweet potato hash on the side--worked out pretty good! Juices were great--the boyfriend liked the Antioxidant."}
{"text":"Not the best first experience. I was excited about the menu but disappointed with the execution. I ordered a steak salad and a juice. The salad was a handful of greens and four small chunks of beef that was nearly impossible to chew or cut (with the butter knife provied) also asked for olive oil instead of balsamic and i got an oil but not olive,  the antiox juice was heavy beet greens flavor and one quarter foam...all for $20+ . Not great food...not great service."}
{"text":"Came here after a workout and tried the ground turkey egg wrap and a peanut butter shake. It was very good and had a lot of flavor for such a nutritional/high protein meal. The employees were very friendly and helpful with deciding my meal. Very impressed and will probably return as it is right outside of my gym, so very convenient!"}
{"text":"I really like this place! I love how they give people the option of healthy food on the go without having to eat brown lettuce salads from a fast food spot! I took an unber all the way from my hotel on the strip just so I could have something healthy while i'm in town for business. It seems nearly impossible to eat healthy at my hotel! I tried the steak bowl with avocado, gargonzola cheesee and brown rice. I found it filling, cooked just right, and the dressing was tasty. My only concern was the bugs i'm assuming from the door being left open. I literally had to request a cover for my food! Other than that, I had a great experience and was glad to find a healthy place to eat!"}
{"text":"Tried this place with the roomie. I will be back for sure!  Great food!  I have to go back and try the protein shakes!"}
{"text":"This is a new find however it is very good. He quality of the food is great and it is certainly quite healthy. I have only had one drink I didn't like. Everything else is A+"}
{"text":"I love coming here after a good workout-- it's really close to LVAC. I don't come here often, as it can get kinda pricey. But when I do, I order the Steak bowl or a wrap-- great protein! It's definitely quality food and healthy for you.   I'd recommend this place for anyone looking for a quick bite that is healthy, packed with protein, especially after a workout at the gym. However, expect to pay $10 and up for the items on the menu."}
{"text":"Great food. Worth every penny. I have been eating here for about 3 weeks now, almost every day. The staff and the owner are fantastic too. Owner very hands on you can tell that he really cares about his restaurant and the quality of food served. Love it. Customer for life. This place dominates the competition."}
{"text":"So I have been here quite a few times, most times when I order through eat24 they have not even processed my order before I arrive and I Order before I leave work and it takes 15-20 mins to get there. Once when they didn't have it even started I asked to have to put in as eat in the guys says okay the girl finally after waiting about 10 mins brings out our food in a Togo bag, so I tell her it was suppose to be eat in. She says because it was a an eat 24 order it's put in as Togo so I told her when we got there we told the guy that we were eating in and he said okay and she said again because it's eat24 to get paid that's how they have to put it in. Makes no sense to me but I dropped it because I could see I was not getting anywhere. How does my order being through eat24 effect me getting it in a eat in dish when I requested it when they finally processed my order. I think if you are going to accept eat24 you should make sure you pay attention so people don't have to wait for their order as most order on their lunch break. Okay now on to the food it is absolutely amazing! I have tried too many things to mention but my favorite is the filet and eggs! The food is always cooked to perfection and I love their food does not give you that full miserable feeling. I will say besides the Togo vs eat in situation the staff is friendly and thanks you for commi"}
{"text":"This place is great for any time of the day, breakfast, lunch or dinner. They do it all, including fresh juices and protein shakes. I love their Protein Pancakes, Oatmeal, and Yaki Salmon Griller. I have a really hard time going a week with out having one of these or their delicious shakes. I usually get the Green Monster. I heard they were getting Acai bowls in very soon, I can't wait to try those as well.!! Stop in and check them out you will not be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Had one of best Cobb salad with grilled chicken today. Thanks to chef Scott. Too bad he doesn't work there more often"}
{"text":"The food was good but I didn't feel full for another 15-20 minutes after eating. It didn't seem like diet food to me, just cut the carbs out. Other people in the restaurant seemed happy with their meals. Just another trendy place to try. I liked the it."}
{"text":"So many protein this and protein that I thought i'd try this one out. I got the bison burger with sweet potatoes, coffee, and some peanut butter balls. Ate all that mess up. Good stuff. Lil expensive so can't be eating everyday. $3 for the coffee dang that's more than starbucks. Bison burger was great and i'll def be back. Well cooked and delicious. Pleasant atsmosphere, I guess. I see a lot of people talking about atmosphere i'm not too good at that I just want some food not really looking to comfort my feng shui but its always a plus. I didnt really want to eat here but i did and i'm glad and i'll be back!"}
{"text":"Can I give zero stars? Went about 6 months ago, new to Yelp. Extremely expensive food for what you get. Granted you know the healthy food diners will cost more but really? $9.99 for three multi-grain pancakes with only two strawberries sliced 10 ways to give appearance of more? Menu photo showed blueberries, strawberries, and bananas! After receiving my order that was obviously missing a great deal, I walked up to menu board on wall. In small print description I read only strawberries mentioned. After tax and tip we're talking $13 for three multi-grain hot cakes with two strawberries? And yes, I tip knowing it isn't employees fault the owners boards are misleading.  Felt scammed and never going back."}
{"text":"I have always love the protein source.  With their recent new upgrade on the paper to go box and utensils , I appreciate the environmental friendly move... thank you    Food is clean and always great.."}
{"text":"I love the protein shakes here! Mocha madness is my favorite! They have a great outdoor seating area for the warm days in Vegas! I bring my little dog and we sit outside :) the food looks great as well! On my next visit I will definitely try that burger everyone orders!"}
{"text":"Donte and Xavier are nice gentlemen who know the true definition of customer service. My Açaí Bowl was amazing! Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Great selection of healthy shakes, smoothies, and salads! But a little over priced for what it is. $9 for a protein shake? Come on!"}
{"text":"I thought the service was terrible and the quality of the food was good. My friend and I got salads and both seemed fresh with quality ingredients but the dressing completely butchered the entire salad. Also I felt like my salad was all ingredients and barely any lettuce. Everything just seemed really out of balance. I didn't really want a whole lot of beans and peppers. I paid extra for chicken which was super dried out and small. I didn't think the prices for the salads were bad at all and the portions were very big. It was cheaper than what I expected it to be after I read through some reviews."}
{"text":"I came here today to try with my co workers I have never been and so I ordered the big boy bison burger while half way through my burger I noticed on my side salad that there was a bug crawling around I took the plate to one of the servers and they asked me if I would like them to make another I told them no and asked if I would like to finish my burger since they where so separated on the plate not thinking i said sure whatever it took almost 20 mins to get the meal I don't want to wait again so the guy washed the plate or gave me a new plate with my burger on it apologized and said they would give me a refund as I finished I walked my plate over to the guy and as I did he began to tell me that they cannot refund me what ever don care just would like to put it out there that this place has bugs and don honk anyone else should have to experience this. WILL NEVER BE BACK AND WILL NEVER RECOMMEND TO ANYONE."}
{"text":"if you're looking for a delicious local place to eat this is it! great, fresh and HEALTHY food reasonably priced! i have been to both locations and have always received excellent service and exceptional food! will definitely keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Love coming to this place ... For is great .. staff is always  help.... i usually get the Veggie Chilli and have them Add some chicken breast to it ... Also their protein pancakes are always on Point... definitely check this place out..."}
{"text":"Love the options for healthy dining. Good variety for everyone whether you are a meat eater or vegan. Ingredients are fresh and always made to order. My favorites are the ALl the Wraps, Pro Waffle Towers, Açaí Bowls, and Cobb Salad."}
{"text":"I can definitely see the appeal to this restaurant, but it just misses the mark pretty badly.  My fiance and I came here this afternoon to try a bunch of things. I ended up with The Source burger and she got a salmon bowl.  The PB Lover protein shake I got was good, but it really just tasted like milk, peanut butter, and protein powder. This is fine, but not really worth of the $8 price tag, even after working out.  Her kale juice was decent, but again the price was a bit on the high side.  My burger was overcooked and just ok. The sweet potato hash was pretty good, but the taste was monotonous. Asparagus, avacado, and bacon on the burger were good, but it was overpriced for the mediocre taste.  She couldn't eat her salmon bowl. The salmon itself was fine, but the ingredients in the bowl weren't good and made her nauseous. They added some sort of liquid to the cauliflower mash in the bowl that shouldn't have been there and made it loose and pretty gross. She ended up eating most of the salmon and throwing the rest away.  For two meals and two drinks, the bill came out to nearly $50. It's a very nice and clean location, but we will be passing on a return visit."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service! My husband and I are on an AdvoCare 10 day cleanse and this was a great choice for a dinner date!"}
{"text":"I really like the array of healthier meal plans to choose from here.  Burgers, bowls, wraps, salads, protein shakes and even breakfast. They've got it covered!  Been wanting to try their Bison Burger, so that's what I ordered! The bison patty was a good size, right amount of thickness and pretty flavorful. It was just a tad tough... cooked past medium. I guess I should've requested how I wanted my bison burger cooked which is medium rare.  Usually, Im asked what doneness you want your burger. They did ask how I wanted my egg though. Fried egg was a nice touch but overall, it was just okay meal on this visit.  It could be that I just had one fantastic grass-fed bison burger the night before at place over at Town Square. So they had raised the bar.   It's fast casual set-up, so order and pay at the counter. Cashier was friendly and even brought my order to where I was sitting. The dining area is clean, bright and easily accommodates the gym goers from next door. Next visit Ill probably try something else though."}
{"text":"Stopped here as I was looking for a healthy alternative to Starbucks (across the parking lot), and I'm so glad I did! Healthy menu, fresh new decor, friendly staff.  Tried the Tropical Green juice (yum!) and ordered the Jacked Burrito for breakfast and the turkey wrap for lunch later.  Shout out to the friendly staff- didn't catch their names, but they were working on Thursday morning, August 4th, so I hope management sees this and gives the young man and woman some props. Very nice and professional.  I don't live in town but wish there was something similar where I lived! Try it out!"}
{"text":"Last I checked eggs weren't vegan lol..... Slow service , high prices, and menu labeled incorrectly."}
{"text":"I'm still a big fan of Protein Source.  I've tried a good chunk of things on their menu now and most of them are delicious!    Their portions are a good size and are filling but still healthy and in-line with meeting my macros.  I love coming here after an intense workout and feeding my muscles.  I knocked off one star from my original review because of two things:  1) The acai bowls.  The acai bowls here sadly to say are NOT good.  Texture and taste are both off compared to acai bowl/smoothie places. 2) The wait times.  There have been a few times where I've ordered and didn't get my food until 20-25 minutes later, even when the restaurant wasn't busy.  Other than these two points, if you have a little bit of time and want a filling meal, Protein Source is a solid choice."}
{"text":"Wow I was very impressed with my first visit.  I ordered the Bigboy Bison with bison burger on oatmeal Greek yogurt whole wheat buns, caramelized onion, 3 egg whites or 1 egg, cheddar, romaine, tomato, and house sugar free BBQ sauce for 12.99 with a side of sweet potato hash.   It was a real winner. I never had bison or elk and was hesitant but I would have never known the difference between bison and beef. I enjoyed the sweet potato hash and I have to say not everyone knows how to make a sweet potato taste good, but they did it just right simple but tasty. I am also happy to not see \"tofu fries\" which I am not sure how fried is healthy.   I am looking forward to them having the calories, protein, fat, etc on their menu, I was told that is on it's way to happening soon. This did not taste healthy at all and I believe that it is, but wow how was it so good? I want to see the calorie count for proof then I am sold for sure.   I can't wait to go back and try other items, I hope they are just as good as what I had."}
{"text":"Seriously an awesome place, especially after a workout! I just gave it a 4/5 cause they messed up my order the first time I was here haha"}
{"text":"Stevia BBQ sauce? Excellent! It's hard to find sugar free and gluten free food but it's easy at this place. Very innovative when it comes to nutritional content and recipes. If I ate here everyday I would be in my most optimal shape. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Nice thought out menu with lots of protein as their name suggests.  Nice patio with canopy which is what Las Vegas needs more of.  A bit pricy for fast food but then its not your typical fast food. Had the bison burger with an egg on it which was good not fantastic.  Wanted ice tea but they didn't carry any."}
{"text":"What happened to the blended juices?! I can get pressed juice anywhere! The only reason I would make the trip to The Protein Source was to get icy delicious juices. Now they have taken all but one off the menu and the one that is left is pretty much a smoothie. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Another great meal. Always a pleasure to dine here.... protein shake was delicious, salad was fresh and filling. \"Source\" Burger was excellent. Clean restaurant and friendly"}
{"text":"I have been to this location and the other on several occasions and the food is always FRESH. Tonight was great like always. The turkey burger and buffalo is on spot and tasty. Fresh patty and full of flavor. Staff was very courteous and friendly. The protein shakes are good too and great value compared to other places.  I highly recommend The Protein Source."}
{"text":"Yummy. I got the big boy bison bowl and tenderloin chili. Both of the dishes were pretty on point. Another bonus is how healthy and clean everything tasted. Will be here again."}
{"text":"Love this place, this is my lunch spot. The food is so good and healthy. I recommend it if you work or live nearby."}
{"text":"The service here sucks, I have given this place three tries because I live in the community and like healthy food options. The first visit they were rude at the counter, second visit I had to wait ten additional minutes after I called in my order and today is my third and last time giving them a try .. I call in my order and she didn't even put it in until I have arrived -_- nothing is offered to compensate for their mistakes and I'm sick of wasting my time. Also I'm the only one in here and they are not busy."}
{"text":"Loved my wrap - I wish there were more places like this around. Quick service, good prices, tasty food, couldn't ask for anything more!"}
{"text":"I honestly really like this place. My boyfriend and I used to go to Greens & Proteins but we saw this place from across the street and had to try it. I feel Greens & Proteins is overpriced and bland, no taste whatsoever. I feel healthy food can still be tasty and flavorful. Whenever we come here, there is a big buff guy there and he is really nice. Im assuming he is the owner? More motivation to work out and eat well lol! They have many options here and everything is so tasteful and delicious :D I usually get the salad with strawberries etcetera with grilled chicken added to it. SO GOOD - it comes with this citrusy sauce and I always get it on the side. I don't know why I do it because I always end up pouring it all over the salad anyways haha My boyfriend's go to meal is the lean machine? (it has ahi tuna with grilled pineapple on top). I would honestly recommend coming here because \"healthy food\" doesn't taste healthy haha!! SO GOOD!"}
{"text":"Food is great but forgot turkey bacon Robert said 3 1/2 there is no 1/2 start her note to Yelp create 1/2 will be back love and by the postmasters will deliver"}
{"text":"I love this place!  Come here after the gym all the time.  They have delicious healthy food options and protein shakes.  They can be a little pricey and take a few minutes to serve up your order but that's the price you pay for freshly cooked healthy food and it's definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"A Muscle Madness shake after a workout is definitely the way to go! The atmosphere of this place is so cool and amazing there are people of all walks here, bodybuilders, weightlifters, cross fit-ers, and people who just want to live a healthier lifestyle. This place isn't just for bodybuilders and athletes like other places its for everyone and the food quality is amazing at both locations, i would recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"My first time trying this place out. I ordered online cause it was so close to my house. I got acia bowl and peanut butter balls. They were so taste and I loved all of the stuff I ordered. Staff was super nice and sweet when I got there and asked them questions."}
{"text":"The food here is so good and the husband and wife duo that own this place are so friendly! This place makes food prep easy and the quality of food can't be matched!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place,  food is delicious. I love the tables in the patio,  it's a chill, fun place :)  The cashiers though always seem to have an attitude,  but oh well food is good!"}
{"text":"Horrible service! They ring up for my order, waited for over 20minutes - apparently the clerk from the register forgot to issue a ticket to my order! So when I ask them about my order they said we don't have a ticket for your order! So when I showed them my receipt for my order they finally started with my protein shake order after waiting for another 5 minutes! No apology! Horrible customer service! Girl with the purple hair that took my order did. It even acknowledges what she did wrong. She pretended that nothing happen!  Hopefully management would read and use this post to train their employees to better handle their customer better."}
{"text":"It's January.  This year you've decided to lose everything you put on the last 15 years (good luck).  So you show up here, your trainer recommended it, or you overheard some bros talking about it in the squat rack, or you just saw it leaving LVAC.  And its with good reason.  Its 1. in the same parking lot as LVAC, 2. they use minimal oil to reduce calories, and 3. protein is in the name so you know you'll be feeding those muscles for some sick gains bro.   Ok enough being silly.  This is a great healthy restaurant that puts greens and proteins (its healthy option, in the same shopping center competitor) to shame.  I got the turkey bowl, a delicious, surprisingly moist, turkey patty with black beans and and veggies over brown rice.  I think they must have made a deal with the devil because I can never get brown rice to rase good or turkey to be anything but a hockey puck (wait am I just a bad cook?....) It also came with avocado and a side of salsa.  Ahhh-maaaaa-zingggg! And huge too! I didn't get the calorie count but they guy said he could give me an idea of the macros on any of the items when i was trying to make my mind up (- a star because that info should totally be on the menu!)  Which reminds me, the menu is HUGE!! I didn't know so many healthy options existed!  My husband got the southwest chicken griller, A grilled chicken breast, lettuce, beans, avocado and cheese wrapped in a tortilla (whole wheat of course!) and grilled.  It was also delicious!  The restaurant was very clean, they had some mellow chill electronic music and a big screen with a muted metallica concert on (thanks for the mute haha)  All in all, this is a great place to grab a post workout bite, or just a normal I'm hungry kinda bite!"}
{"text":"Wow! I just moved into town and decided to go in before a workout. I got their pre workout shake and it was amazing! The service was amazing and super kind. I went back to get dinner and got the turkey wrap it was so good and filling I only finished half! I'll definitely be going here more often!"}
{"text":"It's my Third time eating here in the last four days.  Great food and the owner is always here greeting customers and making sure be service is operating at it's very best.  I've had the elk burgers, super lean, aloha and pancakes everything is fresh.  I'm going to start bringing my pro athletes down here to eat and get there meals prepared.  The meats are never frozen and all organic can't ask for anything better.  Spend a littler money on your health now to save a whole lot later."}
{"text":"Everything was very delish! My husband is not into \"protein/healthy meals\" but he liked it A LOT! I loved it! Quick and friendly service! Nice and clean! I wish there was one in Orange, Ca!"}
{"text":"Love this place, always get yummy food never disappointed. Always fresh quality and I honestly can't get enough. I like this place over greens and proteins due to their variety and quality of food is so much better. Not a boring healthy place prices are okay you definitely pay for what you get. Love the power salmon but my #1 fav has to be the lean mean ahi machine! So good my god. Service here otherwise is okay not the best you can tell the workers don't like their job."}
{"text":"Yummy, lots of healthy options.  Unfortunately, like most healthy restaurants, it's a bit pricey and the portions are on the smaller side compared to regular restaurants (which I'm sure in the long run is better for your health).  Anyway, if each item were a couple bucks cheaper, I'd come here a lot more."}
{"text":"I visited on break and experienced amazing food and the best service around! I ordered the Ahi Protein cucumbers and totally forgot to look if it had avocado (I'm allergic) and when I received, I was ready to accept defeat and go back to work without eating. The staff quickly noticed and offered to make me a new order! Thank you so much! I will definitely let people know how awesome this place is and return soon!!"}
{"text":"I'll admit, it was a little intimidating to come in here after scoping out their social media pages and seeing tons of bodybuilders and fitness fanatics giving them accolades. I love a good sweat fest, but I am not dedicated to it as a career. Luckily, the staff are friendly and the menu has options to satisfy just about anyone who walks in and simply wants something a bit healthier than the average meal out.  The Breakfast Smoothie is not on the menu any longer, but an awesome start to the day with your choice of base (whole, fat free, or almond milk), plus natural peanut butter, strawberry, banana, and coconut flakes- pretty similar to what I make on my own, but a safe option for your first trip over here.   Other favorites include the protein pancakes and their various bison dishes- looks to be best in their burgers. They also currently have a Yelp check-in discount offer for $1 off a protein shake or juice- stop by before or after your next LVAC workout!"}
{"text":"The establishment was clean and the staff was friendly. Food was just OK in my opinion. It was fresh and healthy, just seemed to lack flavor. I don't know, something seemed to be missing."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. Fresh, tasty, healthy, and great service. My favorite is the skinny salmon"}
{"text":"Had the california cobb wrap and my hubs had the berry filet wrap both were delicious. Get the peanut butter protein balls too! Good thing there were only 3 cause I could have eaten way more! But then again they are gealthy for you. We also like that they dont have a soda machine, shows that they really care about health."}
{"text":"Great food great service I love the staff the owner I met today  very respectful. If you go get the Elk burger it's epic.  Definitely my favorite healthy eatery. It's in a great spot to by the lvac so makes a great post Workout meal"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place since I am working to be healthier and fit. However, I tried the salmon bowl and ended up attached to the toilet all night. I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy...."}
{"text":"The food is great and healthy always hard to find a place like this. My husband is really picky and he even gives 2 thumbs up. The post workout shake is amazing also the chili"}
{"text":"Consistently good.  The food is good quality and seems to be prepared pretty fresh.  There usually pretty busy which I take as a good sign.  Also despite the traffic the food comes out relatively fast.   I get the loco moco with bison patty.  The meat is good quality and so was the rice.  Very good dish.  They have a robust menu with many vegetarian and vegan options.  Also a good breakfast menu served all day.  I will definitely make it back soon."}
{"text":"Before I tried this place I was excited because it seemed like a good place to eat when you're watching your diet or for a post/pre workout meal. The meals that are served here are average at best... things you can make easily at home. I usually get the American muscle, which uses ground bison. It's pretty good if you're watching your carb intake. Nowadays if I ever get anything here it's the protein shakes. Overall the food is okay it isn't bad. Service is your average you order at the counter and on your own after type. My main turn off about this place is how overpriced it is vs portion. You can easily go elsewhere for cheaper meals and just as \"healthy.\" If you are too lazy to cook at home after your workout and don't mind spending the money... then this place is an okay choice."}
{"text":"I've been to both locations and have nothing but the best things to say about the Protein Source! The staff is very professional and attentive and the interior makes it one of the coolest places to hang out after a workout. Food is fantastic and the portions are very generous!"}
{"text":"One thing I've noticed about these health food restaurants that are popping up near gyms in Vegas is how cut throat it is. I rejoiced when I first moved to Vegas and discovered Greens & Proteins off of Eastern. I loved the concept of healthy, good quality, fast casual, in the same center as my gym. Then shortly thereafter, another similar restaurant moved right down the street, instead of near a different gym and I was like, WOW that is hardcore! Reminds me of what Starbucks used to do to all the mom and pop shops to run them out of business. I wondered if both businesses would be able to survive. As of now, they are both still in business. Yesterday, I was in the area and had this place bookmarked for a long time so I finally checked it out. Low and behold, I noticed there was a Greens & Proteins in the same exact center. Not sure who was there first and who muscled their way in on the other but yeah... I think it's safe to say that the competition with this niche type of restaurant is pretty fierce. And Protein Source sure brings it! *insert arm flexing emoji here*  I am very impressed with the food they serve at The Protein Source. Dare I say I like it better than that other place because they have a more exciting menu. I like it so much, I'm going back again today to try something new. I ordered the Lean Mean Ahi Machine Bowl along with a Kale Berry Bomb salad. Both were delicious and they also got rave reviews from my health nut friend.  This location is not close to me but I do love their food. I probably will not be back again unless I happen to be in the area. I wish The Protein Source would take a chance and come out to the Henderson or Southern Highlands area so I can become a regular customer. There's plenty of other gyms/yoga studios to set up shop next to. We need good healthy food like this here! They could definitely count on my business about three times a week or more.  Update: During today's visit I learned that they have a little caveman icon on their menu to represent Paleo friendly meals. Lord help me. I'm officially in love and I'm on my knees begging now. Please open another store near me!"}
{"text":"I've  eaten at the Protein Source almost daily now over a year, it's food that is good for you without having to sacrifice flavor. Their menu is in line with anyone on a Paleo or Keto diet and it's prices are reasonable. Incredible food!"}
{"text":"Dontay and Andrej very helpful gave me the best customer service. Food was fresh very good thanks to these two for helping me"}
{"text":"First of all, we always love going to the protein source on S. Durango. Never had a problem there. This time we tried this one and what a disaster! I didn't like the turkey chili because it was so strong and salty. So my husband went in and told them we didn't like it because it tasted too salty. So, the owner comes out, a tall burly guy, and instead of offering another order of food or saying something to my husband like, \"oh I'm sorry you didn't like it, we will refund your money, we don't put regular salt into our chili but we do put this or that to be an alternate for the salt\". My husband is a quiet, non complainer but he said the owner came off very rude to my husband who's been a chef and worked in the restaurant industry for about 30 years now. If anything, my husband said the owner could have been better with his manners and customer service. So I was mad about it. I called and I tried to explain with some choice words (because I was pissed by then) to one of the workers while I waited to speak to the owner on the phone. The worker hung up on me... now if you're going to hang up on me (which I was going to go inside now because I was actually in the car), I'm assuming you don't want to deal with me, then don't come out busting through the door like you're about to go gangster on me, which is what he did, he came outside before I went in and he started running his mouth (again, they need classes on how to deescalate not escalate any situations), so I ran mine. We were going back and forth and then the owner comes out like gang buster and says, \"so what's the problem here!\" Like he's all tough! I told him and he kept interrupting me and kept saying, \"didn't I refund you?!\" (he clearly doesn't know how to deescalate a situation). I told him it was all about his attitude. If you're going to refund someone at least have a good customer service attitude, instead he kept saying that there's no salt and normally they don't refund like it was such a bother to refund $10 and he acted like he was doing US a favor LOL!!  So, when we were outside we kept asking why it was so salty, he couldn't answer and explain nicely to us if there was a substitute for the salt or whatever makes it taste salty. He kept saying maybe it's the meat, maybe the recipe is wrong blah blah blah. But we kept pushing why it was so salty, and to that he just skirted around and didn't want to deal with us anymore and said, \"I already refunded you, have a great day!\" and he walked away. Unbelievable! He couldn't and wouldn't answer a customer's question. He could have handled it waaaay better than he did. I think he was trying to intimidate us and it didn't work. They guy who came outside first also has the same attitude as his boss, absolutely no customer service and they don't know how to deescalate a situation, instead they throw more fire into it. This girl is NOT having none of that! I will make sure I spread this far and wide. I hear he is the owner of both Durango and Flamingo location, that's why he thinks he can have that kind of attitude. Bumbye you learn bruh! Here's a dictionary lesson for the owners, learn to deescalate and NOT escalate situations. Please, have a company seminar on this  deescalate[ dee-es-kuh-leyt ] Main Entry: lessen Parts of Speech: verb Definition: lower, reduce Synonyms: mitigate, dilute, erode, slacken, minimize, ease, shrink, impair, dwindle, decrease, abate, narrow, diminish, curtail, lighten, weaken, decline, cut, clip, taper, abridge, attenuate, degrade, crop, downsize, soft-pedal, drain, contract, amputate, truncate, close, moderate, thin, cut back, taper off, minify, de-escalate, become smaller, die down, grow less, roll back, slack up, slow down, take the bite out, take the edge off, take the sting out, wind down  de-escalate [dee-es-kuh-leyt] verb (used with or without object), de-es·ca·lat·ed, de-es·ca·lat·ing. to DECREASE in intensity, magnitude, etc.  Update*** So the owner wants to reply and says I used abusive and intimidating behavior. What a joke! I'm just about 5 feet tall, but they wanted to come out of their establishment and try to intimidate us. They came off that way to us, so of course they got an ear full of attitude and language. The owner is about 6 ft tall and looks like he's on steroids, probably accounts for his gangster mentality and behavior and his employees behave the same.  Update*** I noticed the owner changed the original comment to my review, doesn't matter to me. This review will probably stay right here. So, who was being racist? Certainly not us Lol! Is that the only card they can pull out? Stop the craziness already."}
{"text":"LOVE. LOVE. LOVE. LOVE. One of my favorite spots post workout. The quality of food, pricing and customer service gets 5 stars.   Ordered the West Chix Wrap in a Whole Wheat Tortilla with a side of Salad. I highly recommend this. I get it almost every time I go. Tip: For more flavor, ask for a side of their barbecue sauce. You won't regret it.   I've tried most of their wraps, bowls and burgers. Everything is delicious."}
{"text":"Food was good (with the help of some sriracha mayo,) but the portion size was not that great. The brown rice was over cooked, but it wasn't too bad in taste. I paid $21 for a bowl with double protein and a drink. Although it was tasty, the portions can be a bit bigger.  I think they should consider repricing or adding on more food."}
{"text":"The food is good, a bit pricey tho. The customer service is what ruins it. I stood in front of the register ready to order but the two employees in the front were dealing with something or organizing orders (totally understandable, things get out of hand and you gotta fix it up) but when you see someone waiting in line, acknowledge them. \"Hi, I'll be right with you\" \"hey, just one moment and I'll take your order\". Simple as that. I get customer service can be a pain at times but you signed up for it when you chose to work at this establishment. I won't rip them apart about how long it took to get the food and drink, it was a lunch rush but customer service is what makes or breaks your business. Very poor service. The food is good but there needs to be better customer service."}
{"text":"Whatever I ordered was terrible...   I ordered a turkey with spinach wrap. I took a bite and it was not was I was expecting. The turkey tasted and was grounded up like ground beef. The cheddar cheese tasted like the cheapest cheese you can use. The avocado was just thickly cut and stuffed in the wrap also.   While I was eat and holding the wrap, I started to feel grease dripping down my hand. Gross. I only was able to eat half of the wrap  The side salad was pretty pity. It was literally just the side of one of the sections on the container which was VERY VERY SMALL."}
{"text":"This place is definitely underrated, super yummy, friendly staff and quick service!! The food is not only healthy but has a lot of flavor! Will come again :)"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today and was very impressed. I had been once before and definitely don't remember being as satisfied with the experience.   Went with a turkey burger with a side of sweet potatoes. Granted, I can make the exact same thing at home for a lot less than $12 (after tax/15% gratuity) but sometimes, it's nice to have someone else cook for you.   The turkey burger was moist, the bun was soft and fresh. The sweet potatoes actually had a little char on them that would make a lot of people would say (they were burned) but I actually thought it added a nice touch to them.   It came with a little sauce blend that was tasty but I just used ketchup as that is what I prefer.   The guy behind me ordered this Protein waffle that had like egg and turkey in it. So it looked like a waffle burger. I didn't see it on the menu but I know what I'll be getting next time!   When looking for a really clean meal, this is a really good spot to go to.   I say give it a try!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a few weeks now to get the protein açaí bowl. The bowls have usually always been amazing. The service has not been good a single time that I've been here. The girls always seem to absolutely hate their jobs, and they definitely let it show in their service. They definitely need to be retrained in their customer service  Today I made an order online for pick up, again the protein açaí bowl, and I was extremely disappointed in the bowl. The container was only half full, it barely had any fruit, and only a tiny bit of granola in it. A major disappointment, I'm not sure what happened today. But I really hope it doesn't continue."}
{"text":"My new spot for food after the gym. The service is awesome Julie is so nice to us when we come in and she is always friendly. I'm so happy to have found this place and I will continue to come back and tell my friends and family."}
{"text":"Did not like this place at all, I went for my first and last time! I tried their veggie burger and it was so sloppily made I was horrified!! Eating healthy as we all know isn't cheap so I can't afford to waste my hard earned money on their products."}
{"text":"Today was my very first visit to protein source. Horrible experience to say the least. I will not be returning based on the fact that you can get a less expensive identical meal next door at greens and proteins with a smile and the assurance that you will not have to wait 15+ minutes for a Togo order to find out they gave your food away to someone else. Staff was very unfriendly and horrible customer service. They didn't not offer to return my money when I told them I was in a hurry and had already waited quite a bit of time for a simple chicken rice and broccoli I plate. They reluctantly gave me the salmon dish that belonged to the other customer upon persistent request even though I had ordered chicken. They are also way over priced."}
{"text":"Talk about great source for not only Protein but really some of the best recovery/healthy meals we all need after long workout. I have been to The Protein Source for just that exact reason twice now. Both times the service has been nothing but five star service. The cashier that takes your order greets you with smile, friendly, and the first time explained the menu very clearly and answered any questions had about the menu. Talk about diverse men it was really tough choose from the one time. Basically the menu broken into sections Wraps, Bowls, Acai Bowls, Breakfast, Smoothies, and Vegan dishes plus am sure missing couple more. So there really something for everyone. They are more then willing too adjust or substitutes not problem. My first time I went for the Upsidedown Loco Moco. It was ok. The Bison Patty was cooked spot on just like the egg ordered over easy. The rice for me just never worked. It more fried rice style and using jasmine rice instead of long grain rice was game changer. It had good flavor just never complimented the whole dish. But too be fair I associate Loco Moco \"808\" style so two scoops white rice, patty, egg, and gravy. One patty on top instead of two definitely feel like ordered more straight fried rice on plate. The presentations are really nice! It simple but yet elegant all on white plates and bowls that make the food stand out.   The second visit talk about a hitting home run or totally opposite experience with the food. I ordered from the Wrap section went with the Bulk up Bison. It was AMAZING. I got the spinach wrap instead of the regular. The filling was nice and hardy. Not only was the ground up bison in bbq sauce that was spot on tasty. Add carrots and couple other things. It was a hearty burrtio/wrap. It comes with nice side bowl of house salad with house vinaigrette. Perfect combination wrap and salad. Super refreshing, light, healthy, and hearty. It also comes with side of bbq sauce.  Fan of the decor. They have one huge widescreen hanging in the corner. Few counter spots and tables inside. Not that big of place but still would say decent amount of seats for small restaurant. I love the sign on one wall with Healthy Eating Healthy Living. Stays true to the concept of the restaurant. They have no soda fountain machine. Always odd in general. I kind of like the fact that not forced cause they do sell soda. It makes me want drink water with my meal or they have four different vitamin waters on tap that can choose. They bunch of nutrition bars, cookies, and couple fresh pastries.   If member of EOS am not. The Protein Source is great place stop right when down cause its literally the business next door. I plan on coming back for more healthy recovery meals!!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. The food is actually very creative and delicious. But the biggest problem is that your order takes too long to come out.  This place is located very close to an lvac so for me when i come here after a workout, I'm on a time limit to eat my protein within 45mins. If i factor in going to the sauna after my workout and then getting ready to leave, get here to order, and then wait, it takes too long. Nobody likes a hip, s l o w , restaurant.   Doesn't matter if you get for here or to go. It will take you a good long while; and on top of that if there are maybe 2 people ahead of you, good luck it adds even more time.  Oh and to make matters worse, this makes people hangrier. Just sayin  This one factor of slowness really hurts the business and for that reason, I'm out.  P.s. food is soo good but soooooo damn slow. People in there look busy but not sure with what?  Other than that the cashiers were awesome..."}
{"text":"We were given a copy of the the glossy take out menu and really looking forward to eating here. They serve breakfast, bowls, salads, chili, wraps, burgers and drinks, juice, protein shakes and also have a kids menu. Each item was pictured and described in great detail.   There was one customer eating when we came in and five employees at the counter. Music was playing that was exceptionally loud. Since we had seen the menu before hand, we knew what we wanted to order. The employee who took our order asked if we wanted water while we waited and gave us 2 cups. I thought that was nice. Our order was ready about 10 minutes later.   We ordered the BBQ chicken stacks which were $9.49 for four.  The menu description was fresh cucumber shots toppped with chilled and chopped chicken breast, black bean salsa and Stevia barbecue sauce. There was more cucumber than chicken and barely any black bean salsa. The Stevia barbecue sauce was great.  We also ordered the skinny salmon bowl which was described as pan seared Atlantic salmon, asparagus and cherry tomatoes served over cauliflower mash topped with balsamic reduction and cilantro pesto $11.99. The cauliflower mash was runny and flavorless. Two halved cherry tomatoes had sunk in the cauliflower mash. The salmon  was also flavorless and had hard pieces of something in it. I'm not sure if it was bones but it was not edible.     Meager portions and awful, overpriced food. We will definitely not be returning here."}
{"text":"I had a veggie burger with a sweet potato hash side and it was pretty good! My fiance ate the lean mean Ahi machine bowl and scarfed it down immediately. I wish they had more vegetarian options but the food was pretty good! Their overall concept is very similar to Greens and Proteins a few feet away, but I think it is ok to have some healthy competition. They also sell delicious, vegan cookies called \"The Complete Cookie\" made by Lenny and Larry. It is a bit high in calories and sodium, but not too bad, if shared."}
{"text":"This was our first visit and, overall, it was very good. My husband really enjoyed his turkey wrap and lemongrass green iced tea. I ordered the veggie cucumber shot. It was supposed to have mushrooms and eggplant sautéed with garlic layered over hummus. The problem was there was no eggplant in my dish. When I questioned someone about this he basically told me he didn't know where the eggplant was and this is the way they always make it. When I asked if the menu was wrong he said, 'I guess' and said he would talk to his boss (this was after trying to tell me the hummus was the eggplant). I'm not sure if the employees are uninformed or if the management didn't care, but no one else came out to talk to me about this issue. The food was good enough that we will probably give this place a second chance, but next time I will definitely question how my dish is prepared beforehand."}
{"text":"Love the acai bowl. It is surprisingly very filling for how small the bowl is that its served in. Looks can definitely be decieving.   Conveniently located by my gym its a great spot to stop in for a healthy meal after a great workout.  Acai berries, granola, strawberries and bananas.....delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"Yummmmmm!!!! Healthy and so good!!! Go all the time after working out. My girlfriends and I love going in and getting the bison burger with cheese! Honestly everything on the menu is good - I've had almost everything :)"}
{"text":"We were supposed to go to Greens and Proteins but decided to try this place for the first time. I was extremely disappointed in the decision. The \"juice\" I got taste like all of the fruit that was put in it was not ripe at all. The salmon was okay but the rest of the food that my friends and I had was extremely horrible! Even when trying to doctor it up a little it didn't work! When I told them that I wasn't pleased with the juice the man behind the counter just looked and me and repeated the ingredients....as if I couldn't read! Never Again!!!!"}
{"text":"Omg I finally had time to sign into my Yelp account and the first thing I had to do was write a review about this fantastic place.    I'm really into healthy clean eating and this is my number one spot to go for quality fresh food.  I swear I eat here almost 3X times a day after going to the gym next door and the menu selection is huge with reasonable prices.  In fact amazing prices for the quality and portion size you get!  If you eat out a lot instead of cooking at home and can't find a healthy place I'd choose this hands down over other spots like Greens and Protein or the salad bar at Whole Foods.     I go to both locations and met the owner tonight and just told him how impressed I was with this concept and the food overall.    Must visit!!  I hope they franchise this soon."}
{"text":"I went into The Protein Source on Durango, the young lady that served me called Susannah was very sweet and helpful. She explained the menu to me, it's good food , tasty and healthy. It's good to see that the staff really care too!"}
{"text":"I like the Protein Source and find the staff very nice, there seems to be a big turnover so if some staff don't seem up to par then maybe it's because of that. Some yelper named Edith was extremely critical , almost referring to staff members as psychologically damaged, possible jealousy on this woman's behalf  perhaps. I just hope the manager didn't dismiss people because of her  review, you're a cruel and sick woman you probably complain everywhere you go! Do you like getting young people fired, you basically suggested they do that, thats extremely vindictive ; what were you like when you were a teenager around 18 or 19. You gave backhanded complements and referred to staff as lost souls, to me you are the one with no soul. You made personal attacks on these young people and  some of the things you said  are disgusting. If the upper management fired people because of your reviews alone then I wont be back there especially if I  don't see the same people I won't  go back there anymore! As for the managers of this place, if you take what one person says as the overall opinion of everyone I think you should go back into training!"}
{"text":"Great source of healthy food after the gym or anytime of day. Food is fresh. Juices are made to order. The food is fantastic. Even if you don't like eating healthy, the flavorful dishes make it feel like your cheating."}
{"text":"I love love love this place.   The food is good, the service is great and it's close to my house (and next door to my gym).  I was looking for something \"lean\" and this got the spot.  I think mine was called the macho ahi or something. It was good!"}
{"text":"Love the food here. And the service is on point! Dropped my drink tonight and the replaced it :) woohoo!"}
{"text":"I needed protein and this seems to fit the bill. Yes, the bill is over the top however, the ingredients in their signature shake is something I could purchase separately and blend at home. But I needed convenience. So we pay for that. It would be nice to have flatware instead of plastic ware in a picnic style service especially for the price of the meal. Maybe that's why they spend the funds on the quality ingredients instead of flatware. I had the light start breakfast and it was perfect. Turkey sausage was juicy, eggs as I requested. I will return and bring others!"}
{"text":"I love the bowls!  Healthy eating with some good choices.  Juices & smoothies are good too.  There is outside seating.  Because it is prepared fresh there can be a short wait."}
{"text":"A great place to eat after workout  Awesome food  Thank you guys  for a great service  Love to be here"}
{"text":"Good spot Chile the guy at the desk George Took good care of me & made sure I got something I would like I would recommend u try this place out"}
{"text":"Not sure who did the demographics study and decided to open up right next to Greens and Proteins, but there should be enough health conscious affluent people to support them both if they execute properly.  Clearly they are passionate about fitness and making truly healthy creations.  I got the steak and eggs to go and loved it.  No upcharge for 6 egg whites is a crazy good value (I hope they have the appropriate food costs to stay afloat).  The steak was cooked properly and the BBQ sauce was delicious.  Finish it off with some superfood sweet potato hash and you have a great meal.  The dining area is quite comfortable looking and has some outdoor space too.    The staff was very attentive and friendly.  Of course I fire in a few dollars to the tip jar on carryout, but many do not without an option to tip on the bill.  Add in this feature online and you will be rewarded without alienating any customers.  I'm rooting for you guys and will be doing my personal best to help this take off by using you as my go-to take out location."}
{"text":"I don't usually write Yelp reviews but great googley moogley I took one bite of the American Muscle and instantly opened this app. Go. You owe it to yourself and your children, even if they are nonexistent.   This place is a health nuts dream. Not the cheapest but Idgaf right now. Ok, back to my bison and broccoli. Ask them to go easy on the oil."}
{"text":"I am in LOVE! For there to be a restaurant (not a meal prep place, but an actual restaurant) that appeals to the health & fitness folks, is awesome! What makes it even better, is that their menu has SO much AND it caters to: Vegetarians, Gluten Free folks, body builders, and those on the Paleo diet. And here is why I give it 5 stars: THEY SERVE BREAKFAST ALL DAY! OH, today is also Sunday. Most restaurants close around 6 or 7pm on Sundays. THEY CLOSE AT 10PM!!!!   This place is an actual restaurant, kind of like fast food. You don't get waited on but they do serve you your meal. I am used to establishments similar to this except the establishments are meal-prep shops. Where they have a weekly menu which changes every week. The Protein Source is not a meal-prepping establishment, though you could very well order everything and refrigerate for the week :) One other thing, because I'm used to Meal Prep places with body builders and perfectly shaped women who just got out of the gym there, I was a little nervous walking into The Protein Source. But it was quite welcoming!    MY ONLY WISH is that they carried pork bacon and not just turkey bacon, and that they include high fatty meals for those of us on a Ketogenic Diet (low-carb high-fat, moderate protein diet). Or, that they include more lower carb sides. Oh I have so many recipe ideas for the owners, they WILL be getting an email from me on a few Keto dishes to consider LOL. See, on a Keto diet too much protein = sugar spike in the blood. Therefore, those of us on a Keto (which is kinda similar to Paleo) eat 80% fat. So, having pork bacon (preferably nitrite/nitrate free & uncured) would up our fats without getting too much protein.  However, I really appreciate their counts on the menu. Sadly for me, most of their Starch sides have way too many carbs for one day for me. But there are at least 2 options that were low in Carbs. AND you can create your own dish too!   After reviewing the menu for something close to Ketogenic, I ordered the Skinny Salmon dish. It had salmon, asparagus, mashed cauliflower, and a cilantro pesto (I think). What I loved was their side of mashed cauliflower. The texture was soooooo smooth! I personally don't like Cauliflower & force myself to eat it (and I usually sautee it in grass fed butter/coconut oil with other veggies). Their mashed cauli did not taste like Cauliflower AT ALL! The salmon was perfectly cooked. And the Asparagus! Let me tell you....that was cooked PERFECTLY! It had a crunch to it but it was still tender! It was not overly cooked and it was not undercooked. It's as if they grilled the asparagus only I saw no grill marks. It was just perfect! The presentation of my meal was also beautiful! The ambience is casual but you feel like you're being served fancy gourmet food because of their unique pairings, recipes, and presentation. I also loved the fact that they had NO SODA! They had a Vitamin Water fountain, with some of those bevs being sugar-free. They also had 2 \"tubs\" of freshly brewed organic tea: Black Tea & Lemongrass Tea, both unsweetened.   I haven't even mentioned their juice drinks, protein shakes, and their protein/low-sugar desserts!!!   But honestly, do yourself a favor & take a look at the menu. They even have BISON!!! AAAAAND....their dishes are reasonably priced! The most expensive dish I think is $14. Their menu has food that my kids would absolutely love AND my not-so-healthy eating-husband would ACTUALLY like! Their menu has SO much to offer! I am a new transplant to Las Vegas from California and this place is literally down the street from where I live....1 minute by car, 9 mins on foot. I WILL be coming back!"}
{"text":"Super fresh ingredients, friendly and attentive service.  Healthy fine dining at a fraction of the cost.  Can you guys open more branches soon, pretty please."}
{"text":"Always so yummy & fresh. Definitely my favorite healthy spot to go to. The best salads I've had are from here. Food is always spot on"}
{"text":"Great food after a great workout! Stopped here last week and tried their Mocha Madness and it was absolutely delicious! Stopped here again today to try some breakfast and of course have my Mocha Madness and both were absolutely delicious! The pancakes were just sweet enough not over baring. Also I was concerned about the texture that it might be dry but I was proved wrong! They're so moist and filling as well! I love the variety on their menu and that it's not ridiculously priced. Their competition is just a few feet away (Greens and Proteins) but I'd say this place is WAY better!!!! Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Some of the greatest tasting and good quality healthy food I've tasted. Service is great. The staff really knows how to treat the customers"}
{"text":"If you're looking for high quality abd healthy food well Protein Source is the place to go eat. Bever boring or bland the food is full of flavors and is very good for you. With exceptional service and a remarkable cooking  staff. Go get your grub on at Protein Source..you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"!!!!!!!!!!!UPDATE!!!!!!!!!!!!! I never did get a call back on this place. So I cannot follow up on whether or not it's gotten any better. I hope it has. Good luck the protein source. I do hope you're vegetarian burger is much better than it was.      ****UPDATE**** One of the owners wrote me. So AWESOME of them. They are revamping their veggie burger and adding a Vegan Menu. Hopefully in a month I can revisit and give a GREAT Review! At least they care enough to respond and fix the issue. GOOD LUCK!!! My review of the old menu burger is below. Again it's changing soon.    First I would like to apologize to the owner of this establishment. I don't really like to give bad reviews I just couldn't give this one a good one. There might be other people that think this place is great I just want to remind you I only had one selection off of the menu. Now to the review.. this place has a great location right next to EOS so all the gym rats, temporary Gym Rats, seasonal Gym Rats can all get something healthy to eat right after they're done working out. Place looks nice and has great decor. The staff were friendly. So far so good. I I'm vegan so I ordered the veggie burger with sweet potato hash. Il also got a beverage I filled up with there Jasmine Blackberry tea. I've had a lot of veggie burgers so I'm always looking for that one that stands out. Food took about 5 minutes to get to me so timing was fine. When it was delivered it looked pretty good. Smelled all right.. but let's first talk about the consistency of the Patty. Veggie burgers by nature are more crumbly then meat burgers. This Burger was like mush on a bun. I took like three or four bites just to make sure but it was just bad. No flavor, horrible consistency. I mean it was just bad! But I thought hey sweet potato hash sounds awesome let's just dig into that and be happy about that. Wrong again. I don't even know how you can mess up sweet potatoes. But they did. It was raw / burnt/ weird taste I don't know cuz I even like when sweet potatoes have a little char to them, as it kind of caramelizes them. Their char was horrible. I tried a couple bites of that and just couldn't take it anymore. I said well lets wash it down with this beverage and it was bad too. I've never walked out before. I had already paid 14 bucks for this meal and all I could do was push away from that food and get up and leave. I didn't even want to complain to them about it. They might have other great dishes and again I didn't try those because I only had a few choices between salads, a bowl and the veggie burger. I can't say anything else other than it was bad really bad! Good luck protein source. Maybe try a different brand or even make it yourself type of burger patty. Toss the hash and just deal with the fries. And throw that tea away. I don't know if I'll go back and try them ever again. I don't want to waste another $14."}
{"text":"The staff is awesome! Great food! I would definitely recommend this place for a quick, healthy fill up."}
{"text":"Stopped by after visiting FlipNOut Extreme. Loved my pre-work out smoothie. Friendly staff and great service. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Updated my review to 1 star since I got a rude response for the owner months after I left my original review. It's funny, because if they really cared about their Yelp, 1) they would have responded sooner, 2) they would suck so much. The owners think I'm a Greens and Proteins supporter and therefore I gave them a bad review. I've given G&P bad reviews for bad service too. I'm not biased. Bad food is bad food.    Over priced, tasteless food. First and last time here. Ordered the scramble. They give you three ingredients to put in the scramble, but only give you four ingredients to choose from. I got the whole eggs and it's supposed to be three eggs and it looks like two eggs. They charge $3.50 extra for turkey bacon. It's was literally shreds of turkey bacon. The sweet potato hash is inedible. It's boiled sweet potatoes that are grilled after. They taste like nothing. Greens and Proteins is way better. The place smells like farts too. The only reason I'm giving them two stars instead of one is, because the girl who helped us was nice."}
{"text":"Staff seemed rude, and put out when we arrived approximately 30 minutes prior to close.  The food was healthy, but bland and flavorless.. Why go here when Greens and Proteins is literally 100 yards away?!"}
{"text":"First time coming to this place. Loved the protein shake and steak loves was amazing too! Would highly recommend this place!! Very clean. Thank you also for the great service!"}
{"text":"I liked the chill ambiance walking into this spot, relaxing house music and some colorful street art adorning the walls.   Breakfast is served all day so I rolled with the cashier's suggestion: Waffle Towers. Pretty good stuff, cleaned my whole plate! Its made with whole grain waffle batter and turkey sausage but I honestly wouldnt be able to tell. The Agave Jam is a nice touch.  The menu looks good, from juice and shakes to bowls and burgers its a colorful diversity of food options. Would definitley try again."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the food here it's healthy and delicious and there are so many options. What I do not like is none of the staff are very friendly. None of them ever smile! I was there today and ordered a berry wrap and a turkey burger we waited over 30 minutes to get our order so if you come hungry make sure you don't mind being patient. It's worth the wait.  Just don't expect warm friendly attitudes or smiles."}
{"text":"A great alternative when looking for a healthy meal. Good quality ingredients and everything I had was well prepared."}
{"text":"Wow! Every time I come here I am more and more impressed. They have great healthy options and smoothies/shakes. The employees can help you make the best decisions for your lifestyle and tastes as well. Great work... You have created a loyal customer here!"}
{"text":"First time at The Protein Source, it was wonderful.  The restaurant was well kept, clean, and very welcoming. I think the employee who helped me was named George, but I'm not sure, he was super friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu. I ordered a ground turkey wrap, and it was off the chain. It came with a side salad with the delicious lemon dressing, and the entire portion size was big enough for me to have leftovers for later. I've already been back two times since then, and will be visiting The Protein Source on Grand Canyon frequently."}
{"text":"This place charges too much for what they offer. Ordered food online expecting 10% off my order like they advertise but wasn't honored. I let the boy working there know. He had an attitude saying it is only for the app. When I showed him their own signs stating the opposite where you can receive it on the website as well I was rudely dismissed and told there's nothing he can do about it. Also I have a gluten allergy so I ordered protein style but was given a burger with a bun. Never again ..."}
{"text":"When I was leaving GQ Cleaners (see my review), out of the corner of my eye I spotted The Protein Source (about 3 storefronts down) and decided to check them out.    In that plaza, there were about 3 other establishments that offered similar healthy fare, yet all I wanted was a protein shake.  Their menu was impressive, and so I settled in on the Hawaii. (Banana, Strawberries, Pineapple, Vanilla Whey Protein and Coconut Water)  It was filling, and balanced, even though it had 360 calories in it.  It did have 23g of protein and a whopping 69g of carbs.  It would have been a great post-workout shake...but...uh...I hadn't worked out.  LOL.  Good thing it was gluten-free...uh...I guess.  Nothing much to see here, but there is likely something here that most people who are on a paleo or gluten free diet.  Not too bad."}
{"text":"Finally decided to try this place out and was blown away! How has it been open 5 years and I've never tried it? Lesson learned. The food is amazing and healthy- perfect for an after workout meal. Fresh ingredients, interesting combos and so many options. On top of the delicious food the service was great AND they're open late. A nice option late other than the normal burger or taco shop. Try them out!"}
{"text":"Amazing service and good food thank you to Cassandra and Dontay for their amazing customer service and positive outgoing attitudes. Can I get a discount next time or nah? lol also a DJ would be badass :)"}
{"text":"We visited this place several times while in Vegas and loved it; both for lunch and breakfast! Great healthy food that also had great flavor! We will make it a point to visit again when we return to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Great new place to eat after a workout or to go with family and friends for a healthy meal. Menu has breakfast, bowls, salads, wraps, burgers, build your own meal, fresh juice, acai bowls, healthy boost, protein shakes, desserts, and desserts. Be sure to stop in. Nice decor."}
{"text":"So today after the gym me and my boyfriend decided to go grab a bite at protein source and soon as we walking in I noticed the employees seemed mad nor facial expression, just were rude . And this isn't my first time there before it was amazing good customer service. But today , I felt rushed the employee kept asking \"are you ready about 4 times .. then it took them 30 min to make our food on top of the she brought us the wrong food . Very disappointed with them today . Hopefully next time it's better ."}
{"text":"I never feel \"guilty\" about eating here. The wait for food is a bit long, but that's only because everything is made fresh to order and a little bit more pricey than your average take out spot, but the ingredients are high quality. Im very picky about my food yet I love most of the things on the menu. Also I'm a very \"clean eater\" and I love the fact that everything here is made as clean as possible. I eat here almost everyday as its right across the parking lot from the gym (LVAC Flamingo & 215) so it's the perfect place to go before or after working out to load up on protein :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here over the weekend and I we were both blown away by the quality and taste of the food.  I had the Big Boy Bowl and it was delicious, my only comment would be that the amount of sweet potatoes seemed a little much but it was delicious none the less and the BBQ sauce was very complimentary."}
{"text":"Eaten here plenty of times and would always have issues. Got wrong food, received wrong smoothie, ordered item without items and received with but the last issue was the most distributing and I will never eat here again. They always seem to be all over the place there. Ordered to go. Started eating my burrito and then realized I was chewing on a piece of rubber. Notified the store and they told me Manager was out and would leave message, said all they could offer me right then was a free meal next time I came in. Not only was I so disgusted that I was chewing on rubber they had no idea what it even came from and didn't even offer to remake my food. Also.. still waiting for the manager to call me back.. over 6 weeks later. Do not recommend this place. No customer service at all!  Also, I paid $14 for a burrito that I ate one bite of before I chomped down on rubber."}
{"text":"I love this place, although my favorite thing about The Protein Source has to got to be, the delicious side salad, it's also so fresh, with a great assortment of veggies! The salad dressing is legit to die for, I told the staff today that the owners should bottle the dressing up, and sell it because it's that good!   Today I ordered steak teriyaki wrap on spinach, this was my first time having this specific wrap , but so delicious! Super fresh, well cooked veggies, just the right amount of steak, and the teriyaki sauce was great, being that it's not sweetened with sugar! I definitely will order this dish again! The service was great , very friendly staff, and of course very accommodating.    ***Tip: If you're looking for health food, with a versatile menu, yet still lots of flavor, The Protein Source is  a great place to eat! They have something for everyone!***"}
{"text":"Nice lunch option close to my new office. The small but clean space is inviting. Their expansive menu offers a wide selection of healthy options for a post workout or hearty breakfast-dinner meal. This was my second visit and I tried the skinny salmon bowl. Beautiful presentation and hot from the grill which I enjoyed except for the over-pureed cauliflower which was a generous bland portion in ratio to the nice filet and all dente asparagus. Upon my first visit for lunch I enjoyed the southwest turkey bowl which was delicious and robust in flavor. Next, I'll try a salad and add protein."}
{"text":"The food was good, but customer service not so much.  Woman at the counter had an attitude.  Seemed like she'd rather be anywhere but there.  There were several empty tables with cups and leftover food on them.  The last half of my order sat on the counter, but they never told me it was ready...I had to check on it.  Got to my car and discovered they had given me utensils that had already been opened up.  I'd hate to see what goes on in the kitchen!"}
{"text":"The Build Your Own Meal is awesome! What a simple way to customize your nutrition. This place has so many healthy options and the staff is incredibly friendly. The only drawback I have found is that they don't have butter. I'm a fat lover and like to smother my Ezekiel toast in it, otherwise it's too dry for my liking. Other than that, this place is great!"}
{"text":"Being a local of Las Vegas this is my go to for post workout meal. I think everyone there is doing a awesome job. Keep up the amazing work and your playlist in the restaurant are always amazing!! Will be back tomorrow !!"}
{"text":"Tried the one in southwest and the one on Henderson....good menu, well executed, and tasty. Much much much better then it's vastly overrated embarrassingly bad competitor (greens and proteins)"}
{"text":"Rude personal! Ordered a bowl, got an small plate all dry food! Grumpy girl at the register. Very little food for 11$  They totally redeemed themselves the second time I came around! Had a vegan burger with a side of sweet potatoes and a mocha madness shake vegan style! It was amazing ! Thanks guys"}
{"text":"Omg I am so glad we tried this place. It is healthy, fresh, reasonably priced and most importantly delicious! Finally a place I can take my junk food husband to without begging. We tried the garden fresh turkey burger, California Cobb wrap and the chickadilla for our son. Everyone at the table was happy with their choice. We will most definitely be back. And soon...  The place is clean and trendy looking with indoor and outdoor seating. Open til 10pm every night which is pretty convenient. Friendly staff. The works"}
{"text":"This place is the best if you're trying to achieve some massive gains AND don't want to compromise taste for macros.  The protein amount in these dishes are absolutely huge-you can fully expect most meals to contain anywhere from 30g to 50g of protein. Anyone that is trying to meet their macros knows this is a pretty good source of protein, hence their name, protein source.  But enough of the macro talk, let's talk about the flavor. This place is pretty damn good and any bro would agree. Anyone that has eaten prep meals knows it's tough to make a meal that's equally effective in macros and tasty. This place achieves it no problem. My favorite is their breakfast menu which is served all day.  They have everything from pancakes, burgers, bowls, waffles and more. Today I had the pleasure of eating the chicken BLTA which was equally as tasty as any of the breakfast dishes I had.  If you're looking for some grub that you don't have to feel guilty about, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Really disappointed in this place. The menu is not displayed well, so it's overwhelming to look at. The Hawaii Salad I got was bland, Unappealing looking, & was brought out on plate vs a bowl, so made it harder to eat. It took awhile too. Plus, the staff was rather lethargic and didn't have a welcoming personality to them. To be honest, it doesn't appear as if the owners consulted anyone with restaurant experience or knowledge when they decided to open this place. I was really looking forward to another healthy place to eat at, but was sadly underwhelmed and severely disappointed with this place. Unless they make some major changes to their menu (better display, more organized, less corn, have a calorie count) I doubt I'll try it again."}
{"text":"Everything that I have ordered her is amazing. People at work have stopped asking me where I'm going for lunch because they know I'm going to The Protein House. It's my new favorite. Try the Berry Turkey burger. It sounds strange, but it's THE BEST!!"}
{"text":"Great food. Need to fire the girl at the register. One of the most rude ones I've encountered. I asked her a basic question to make sure I ordered what I wanted and she responded \"does it say any differently on the screen\" in a condescending tone. The whole conversation was unreal. I will come back again cuz the food and variety is to die for."}
{"text":"The Steak Lovers bowl is the bomb. I get it without onions or vegetables.  The steak is top notch. For breakfast I suggest the protein waffle with agave.  The agave is pure and tastes amazing on it. It comes with sugar free syrup, but once you try the agave instead you will never try anything else on it. All meals are very filling. I tried the Acai bowl last week for the first time just to change things up for breakfast and it was delicious."}
{"text":"Go see my girl Natalie at the protein source. I order the source burger and the post workout recovery shake.  Don't forget to get a protein brownie too.  Everything is top notch all the way around."}
{"text":"AMAZING! For starters I had no clue what to order and the gentlemen there were very informative about the available selections. I chose the sweet salmon bowl which was full of flavor to the very last drop! The entire meal was fresh in taste. Definitely will be returning and I recommend anyone who cares about eating quality, healthy, great tasting food to stop in and treat yourself!   An added factor is that the place is very clean and well organized!   Thanks for making my night! Good food does that for me! :)"}
{"text":"My first time at Protein Source was a to-go order.  Upon arrival we were handed part of our order and part of another persons.   We got home and realized this, and then the phone rang. They had called us to ask us to come back, but they also asked that we bring the dish that wasn't ours. Which I thought was odd but we did as they asked.   Long story short they ended up giving the order we brought back to the customer who actually ordered it. GROSS.  Any ways- this was almost two months ago. So today we decided to give it another shot.   This time my husband called ahead to place our order and asked if the chili had beans. He dislikes them. The woman on the phone confirmed that there were no beans. She actually put him on hold to confirm with the chef.  We also ordered the signature smoothie and a breakfast sandwich.  So this is how our second time went: We paid $10 for chili WITH beans. We were going to bring it back but i have better things to do than run around town because you guys can't get your orders straight.  The sandwich could've been better. It just wasn't good. And the smoothie was really good.   I decided to check Yelp out to see if we were the only ones experiencing this... Turns out we aren't- but what's even more unfortunate it the managements response to their customers. So rude and condescending. Shame on you!  I will not be spending another dime here, and will not be recommending it to friends or family."}
{"text":"There was some type of stuff in my food here, omg I feel so gross that I was eating this food. It's like metal or tin or something. I got my food to go an something was weird chewing an there was stuff in the fuckkn food, ewwww"}
{"text":"I am in LOVE with this place. This has become me and my dads daily lunch spot. The food is wholesome, healthy, AND delicious. It's so hard to find a healthy place that is not too expensive and consistent. I get something different everyday because you can't go wrong with anything you order. You can make your own meal with a protein, veggie, and grain which I love because I'm super indecisive. The fresh juices are my favorite and i can't go without a juice when I order. The employees are fabulous and upbeat. We also sit outside on their cute little patio with our dog. I have nothing bad to say about this amazing joint and would recommend this to EVERYONE."}
{"text":"I came into the shopping center to go to greens and proteins and when I saw this place I said let me try it . I bought a paradise smoothie and lean turkey bo and I must say I made a mistake . The turkey is super bland , the veggies out of a microwaveable bag I'm sure and my smoothie had very little actual fruit - more ice so it tasted like whey and ice . I'm disappointed that I spent $20 for mediocre food . I won't be back nor would I recommend to anyone ."}
{"text":"Waited 30 minutes for my meal. Seems like an in an out kind of place. Not sure if I'll return considering you can sit at real restaurant and receive your meal in half the time."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing!! We are hardcore fitness people and this is our favorite \"fast\" restaurant... it really feels like an expensive restaurant and it is DELICIOUS!! Fresh flavors, so many different things to try, and all so healthy. We used to eat at Greens and Proteins until we found Protein Source and we're so happy we did!! It's a thousand times better!! We especially love this place after a good workout. We love you guys!!!!!!!!!! Open a million locations please :)"}
{"text":"I have eaten from the place numerous times and I am happy with their food and service whenever I have picked it up and ordered directly in the store. However tonight I decided to have a delivery because I was not feeling good and so the delivery comes. There is not the all the food I ordered in the bags. So I look over my emails and call the number in the email. It goes to the restaurant and then they tell me that the order is done through a third party and that I have to call the third party for the missing food. They are the ones that prepare the food and didn't put it in the bags that were picked up by the driver. Why do I need to call the third party?!?!?! Then I inform them that the only number in the email is their restaurant number. They tell me to google the number for the third party! Keep in mind the only thing I know about this third party is that it's a woman in a pink shirt who came to my flat to ring the doorbell. The rest I don't know. I don't have an email about this third party and the App I ordered from is called \"The Protein Source\"!!!! How is that NOT THEIR APP?!?!    Then the guy on the phone calls me \"hey Lady\" what kind of customer service when I am a paying customer who has not received what she has paid for in the first place. He then tries to give me the logistics of ins and out of their contract with the third party?!! How is that helpful! Just keep passing the buck and NEVER TAKE RESPONSIBILITY! What a ridiculous service! I am shocked at how I have been treated by this person! I really am saddened by this experience because I actually liked going there. You have now lost a customer."}
{"text":"The Protein Source is great! I love that they are located conveniently next door to my gym (EOS Fitness) which of course makes things that much easier when wanting some before or after a workout. My work out partner and I love coming here because of the level of service we get each time! We all know it can get rather expensive to eat healthy so I do actually try to limit the amount of visits in a week BUT I do recommend you checking this place out at least once!  The options are endless and what I like most is that you can customize the protein bowls and protein drinks to whatever your choice. Some are higher in calories than others but I've tasted pretty much all of them and have to say that the Hawaii and Paradise protein shakes are my top favorites!"}
{"text":"I've  been procrastinating for at least a month on coming to this place and I must say that I wasn't missing much! I thought I'd try it out and cheat on Greens & Proteins(another similar restaurant across the parking lot) today! I'll be fair and give a 3 star rating. The lacking of customer service most definitely cost them that additional star. When I arrived I wasn't acknowledged immediately and to me it seemed as though they may have been understaffed? Looked like a total of 4 people working. There was a nice young lady that was making from what it looked like the to go orders as well as the people who were dining there. I didn't wait extremely long but after about 7 mins there was another worker that came from outside and took my order. They have a pretty sketchy credit card machine it took him 3 swipes to finally get my card to go through ? Hmmm says they have been having issues with it but anyways. I received  my Green Monster protein shake and I must say that it was nothing to write home about! I then asked the employee for a menu and before handing it to me she had a bit of a disclosure to go with it.. \"most of the items on this menu we no longer offer and also some of these prices are not the same\" I chuckled and thought to myself then why in the hell even give me a menu that's not even valid? Yikes! I think with the money they may or may or be making its absolutely crucial to offer your customers the most up to date menus at all times! How am I suppose to want to recommend them to anybody by passing on an incorrect menu? O_o yeah umm I think I'll stick to Greens and Proteins!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Everything I have had on the menu is delicious and healthy. I have tried other healthy protein forward restaurants and this one tops all of them. It is a go to when I don't want to cook or meal prep. The source burger is my favorite item."}
{"text":"This is so hard for me to do because typically I love coming here but today was absolutely awful. I noticed last time that the service was a bit slow but today was even worse. The girl who took my order had a HORRIBLE attitude. The line was almost out the door. They had some man who barely knew what he was doing making drinks. It took him like 10 minutes to make 3 drinks and he kept reading the ingredients. I'm currently waiting 15 minutes now on a protein shake =\ I'm sorry but I'm not going to spend $8 on a smoothie somewhere when the workers are slow and have bad attitudes. I won't be coming back here! A bit of advice to management... Hire people who smile and clean up your kitchen floor because it's dirty as hell."}
{"text":"Really loving this place! I got the Southwest griller and all the ingredients, down to the orange and strawberry garnish, were really fresh. I was super impressed. I didn't try any of the juices or protein shakes but I definitely will next time.  The only complaint I have is they were literally blaring EDM music which was annoying, but it wasn't so loud on the patio."}
{"text":"I go here for lunch because it's close to my work. Great service! The girls here are friendly and helpful. Fresh delicious healthy choice options. I like the bison burger and griller here. They started listing the macros and protein in each item which is good for us \"flexible dieters\" excited for the 2nd location it's right by my house."}
{"text":"After massage we come here for lunch. This shop is beside massage shop. And here they're have all healthy foods and big menu for you."}
{"text":"Protein source is hands down the best healthy food spot in Vegas! The service is great , staff is friendly , and the food is consistenly great. I've tried many things on the menu but my current go to meal is the BBQ Chicken Bowl. I love how the owner makes you feel welcomed as well practices what he preaches. By that i mean , eating healthy and seeing him at the gym everyday! Do not hesitate to give Protein Source , either location, a try!"}

{"text":"Highly underwhelming in both food quality and customer service. The açai bowl's açai base was flavorless and super icy. I do appreciate, though, that the girl allowed me to hold the banana and instead added (without me even asking) extra strawberries.   As for service otherwise, taking more orders seemed to be prioritized over preparing the ones that were already placed (like my açai bowl, which she stopped in the middle of making at least three times--in one case just to wait for a guy to get off a cell phone call and place an order). I waited probably 10 minutes when all was said and done. There were no orders in ahead of mine (except a takeout pickup that the kitchen chef must've been preparing; that was the second of the three to four aforementioned interruptions), so I can't say I was expecting to wait that long.   I WISH this place were better, since my gym is right next door, and having a quality, well-run health food restaurant that close by would be SO great. :/"}
{"text":"I'm new to the area and this is my most favorite spot. Ive been here multiple of times and I haven't had a bad dish yet. One thing I love the most is not only is the food great but the service is outstanding. Workers are super friendly and always keeping the place in check. Dontay (an employee) was always super friendly providing me with different information and suggestions when I asked. You definitely don't want to pass up this place!"}
{"text":"The girl who took my order had a RBF (resting b* face), no smile, no hello even though I said hi. The shake I got was bland and way over priced. When she came to give me my shake, I said thank you and she didn't say a word, just walked away."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time this evening and got the Yaki Chicken Bowl with mashed cauliflower. It was delicious, the only thing I would have changed was to have the mashed cauliflower a little thicker. However, the food was fresh, sauce was great and the amount of food was well worth the cost. I will definitely be back and can't wait to try the other dishes here! Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"First time here and this place is good! Came right after the gym and order an acai bowl and a build your own bowl with ground turkey. The acai bowl was ehh okay, and the bowl was not in bowl but still good, I would have rather it come all in the bowl mixed but that's fine. The restaurant is pretty small and cozy. It took about 10 mins to come out so be prepared if your hungry. Overall cool place and awesome that's it's so close to the gym. I would come back and try more of the menu."}
{"text":"First timer. Staff was pretty friendly, & the place inside looked great. I got the Mocha madness. It lacked flavor and was overpriced, $8.64 for a protein shake... I might be back to try the food."}
{"text":"Food quality good enough to be called a gourmet restaurant ! Excellent service ! Great menu ! Very clean ! Will go back !"}
{"text":"Found my new place to eat healthy good food.   It was our first time here and we couldn't decide on what we wanted.  The service was great.  The man greeted and asked if we had any questions he could help us out.   I ordered the ahi tuna salad and it was delicious.  The fish was cooked just right and the vinaigrette was tasty.   I'm a big juice fan, so I had to try one out.  I got the hypertension and it was awesome.    I would highly recommend trying this place out.  It's great place if your trying to eat healthy."}
{"text":"I definitely was not expecting a restaurant like this with a name like Protein Source.  I was thinking it was going to all about body building and muscle milk.  This is just great restaurant that specializes in infusing protein into the meals.    The juices and smoothies are very good and brewed in store.  They give options to build your own or they have about 15 on the menu to choose from as well.  The food is excellent and tasty.  It's not the cheapest lunch in town (around $8-12 for a meal), but the quality makes it worth the extra few bucks.  The food is freshly prepared and the restaurant has a fast casual feel.  Their whole menu is customizable so come here and keep trying new things."}
{"text":"Very disorganized! Waited 30 mins for a salmon wrap. Was told couldn't give you a refund because manager isn't here. Because I was on my lunch break and had to go. Probably wouldn't come back or recommend this place for anyone who doesn't have a hour to waste.   Ok,came back. Don't know why. But,not much changed. Waited 25 mins for the salmon wrap. Won't come back. And now the portion of salmon has gotten smaller."}
{"text":"Awesome casual dining option for those who care about what they eat. I had the Aloha burger. The chicken was so juicy and tender. My friend had the elk burger and loved it. The service was fast and the employees are awesome. Will come back!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. Clean and healthy. Love it so much. The owner did a great job with this place. I'll come back."}
{"text":"The Protein Source has a very nice environment. The food there is great if you're looking for a healthier alternative compared to all those drive thru restaurants. I really enjoyed such a healthy meal that was freshly made. The only thing I didn't like was the cashier. It seemed like she was bothered with me because this was my first time checking out their menu. She didn't give me a receipt, she didn't give me a number tag to put on my table, and when I had finished my meal, I had to go ask for my green house drink. I almost thought she had forgotten I had ordered it. Anyway, aside from her, the food is made with love for health!"}
{"text":"Okay, hippies, I get it ... you have money to throw around and enjoy feeling superior because you eat blander, supposedly healthier foods. Although, this place is over the top. Everything is just so flavorless, and everyone in the joint appears to be trying very hard to like it, because it's what they think they should do. Not my vibe."}
{"text":"First time eating here. Got the bison wrap and it was good. The only reason it didnt get 5 stars cause the sides salad they gave me was undressed. Just plain lettuce and carrots, didnt understand."}
{"text":"Finally! A truly guilt free place to eat for me and my daughter after hitting the gym.  I had a delicious ground turkey bowl. The turkey was moist and flavorful with lots of veggies, rice, beans and it was topped with sliced avocado yum! Everything tasted so fresh and healthy :) My picky toddler had a protein pancake with Nutella and a scrambled egg. She actually ate! Not all of it because the portions are HUGE which I LOVE because mommy has breakfast for the morning.  There was no oil, butter or excessive salt used to make this food taste amazing! Thank you thank you thank you for opening this restaurant!  PS I don't usually Yelp I'm just this excited about this new restaurant!"}
{"text":"Nothing but great things to say about the place. The staff is very friendly and helpful. I was having a hard time deciding what to eat and the lady at the front counter was patient and helped me decide what to get. The place is super clean and there's plenty of seating, especially in the outdoor patio area. The food is a little on the pricey side but well worth it."}
{"text":"Best healthy restaurant in Las Vegas. Great options that caters to a variety of diets and lifestyles. Always great service here as well. I highly recommend everyone to go in and try this spot!  You will most definetly love it!"}
{"text":"Place is clean and sleek. I had the protein shake Hawaii and it was awesome and refreshing. You can taste the different fruits in the shake. My husband had the mocha madness and i can tell you that i am giving up starbucks and dunkin donuts. Its a healthier coffee, who knew you could do this!! I oredered the energy cakes and it was amazing! My husband ordered the waffle tower and it looked awesome as well. He inhaled it! They brought the food to us. Amazing place. Customer service is through the roof."}
{"text":"Received the WORST customer service I've had in a while, i always eat at the durango location and the service is good. Called an order in on sunday april 30th at 2:24 pm to assure i wouldn't wait long for my food, i arrived there at 2:38 paid and didn't receive my food until 3:30 the employees Apparently forgot to start my ticket and half an hour in when i finally though my food was ready i was asked \"sorry what was your order there has been miscommunication?\" And i had to wait half an hour longer for a simple turkey burger, when i finally received it, not a single im sorry for the wait or can i offer you something to drink? They just sort of brushed me off so i most definitely wont be going back to them anymore i will take my money to greens and protein instead, cant be waiting an hour for a burger"}
{"text":"So good! First time here with the hubby! Ordered the California griller and the lean turkey bowl. The sauce that came with the California griller was very tasty! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"We bought a few meals from there.  I tried one. The chicken had so much cartilage and fat in there it was chewy and threw it out. (Can you say salty!  Was absolutely unedible.   Tried turkey even nastier.    Cardboard. We threw out our money and all the food (5 meals). what a waste.  My husband hated it as well. Ps they give you 3 pieces of asparagus and the cauliflower mash was foul.  There are other places in the same shopping center that are much better....::   And customer service is rudely uncalled for."}
{"text":"My husband wasn't feeling well the Saturday morning I visited this The Protein Source location. The last time my husband wasn't feeling well, we visited the Grand Canyon location where we ordered the banana nut bread and the Tropical Green juice. Since I live near the Durango location, my husband and I thought we would order from this location. We actually submitted our order through Yelp 24.  My husband LOVES peanut butter. If I wasn't paying attention to what he was ordering, he would have ordered everything with peanut butter. So my poor sick husband narrowed his order down to the Muscle Madness Protein Shake and cobb salad while I got the cobb salad wrap.  Why the heck are the shakes and the juices over $7!!!?? However, for my sick husband, I guess its better than having to take him to the doctors and paying the $30 copay. The shakes and juices have helped to make him feel better.   My husband also enjoyed his cobb salad priced at $6.99 while my CA cobb wrap was $10.99?? Now that I've checked, the difference is that the CA cobb wrap has egg, chicken and tortilla wrap. I have to say, my CA cobb wrap didn't have that much taste. As for the egg, I didn't notice it until the last few bites when a chunk of it fell out.  So although the food is ok and the juice and shakes are great. It is expensive. But the trendy and young healthy life comes at a premium.  Two issues I encountered.   1. Not an issue with The Protein Source, but more with Yelp 24. It took me about 10-minutes from placing my order online to getting to the restaurant and my order hadn't come through yet until a minute or two after I got there and I was on a mad dash to find my order online because I had already paid $28 for brunch.  2. This next issue actually supports a review done by another elite yelper. There appears to be an employee or two at this very location that lacks personality. I'm not a psychologist but there might be something else going on with this/these employees. During the few minutes I was at the register while the very helpful manager was scurrying around, the employee at the register had zero emotions, didn't acknowledge me other than to look at me, but there was nothing there. She didn't look annoyed nor was she pleasant. Not one peep. When the manager acknowledged that my order finally came in, it was the manager that said, \"we're working on your order now, thank you for your patience.\" As I sat down, I purposely faced the kitchen to observe. As other patrons came in, it was one of the other workers in the kitchen that acknowledged all those that came in and not the girl working the register. To my surprise, it was this no-personality girl that dropped off my shake. No smile but sweetly said, here's your shake. So there is a pleasant personality somewhere in this lost sole. First impression is that this is poor customer service, which it is. But I mention this because it appears management is reading the reviews. Your employee needs help of some kind. I recommend to get her/them the help they need.   Oh, there's a third issue. I noticed that there was a female employee with long hair that did not have her pinned back. Hopefully, none of her stands of hair fell into anyone's food...eew.  My reviews are never intended to be mean but hopefully helpful. There's much improvement needed at this location. Change is never easy. I do plan to revisit this location in a couple of months. I'm hoping to see a huge change so I can change my review to at least 3-stars.   Wish you all the best."}
{"text":"I haven't had a meal in a long time that was as satisfying as the salmon bowl was here.  The combination/portion of salmon, quinoa, veggies made this the perfect meal. I wasn't too full nor was I craving for more.  Hit the spot dead on."}
{"text":"Healthy food nice little dining area kind of pricey though, and smaller portions. It's good for people who don't have time to meal prep or want a healthy meal after the gym!"}
{"text":"This place was shockingly great! They have really taken healthy modern food to a new level. I stumbled upon this place and left nearly dumbfounded. Great value for what you get. Real food, reasonable portion, for a fair price. Only wish they had an east side store in Vegas. Like minded concepts should stand up and take notice. Fantastic!! Highly recommended!! Left and texted 5 people all will be making the drive and well worth it!!"}
{"text":"First time here and Dante took care of me  needless the say the food was bomb and so was he ! Will be a regular"}
{"text":"Bison burger blew my mind. Sweet Potato Mash was so good. I will DEF be eating here all the time  Just moved to town and this is EXACTLY what I have been looking for. Pricey but you get what you pay for. Looking forward to trying out other items on the menu."}
{"text":"The host were great in  helping me select a dish. The Bison wrap was amazing. They were great. Friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"Just like Greens and Proteins and Protein House, this is another fast-casual healthy eats spot. Located a stone's throw from Greens and Proteins, I prefer the food and shakes here. The American Muscle bowl is a good option whether you intend to eat healthy or not. It's full of lean and tender ground bison, a veggie mix and a sweet potato hash that was unfortunately not cooked long enough. The Olympian is a great shake option with its tropical fruit flavors."}
{"text":"I love this place.   Food is great.  Never takes more than 10 Min for my order. I eat here at least 3 Times a week."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite. It's far from my place but worth the drive. I have been on a low fat diet due to health reasons and it has been extremely hard to find good food. Sadly the service wasn't the greatest but I can def overlook that, I mean they have bison!"}
{"text":"Feeling woozy after an intense workout session? Well if you're at EOS, you can wander on over for a quick spike for your sagging blood sugar levels. With mostly very healthy options and some more indulgent choices, The Protein Source offers quite a bit of variety ranging from your typical wraps to unique breakfast options that aren't simply eggs on a plate.  So when I'm really starving, this is my go-to place. This might be one of the best places to try bison - it's certainly something you can't grab just anywhere, unless you happen to be Ted Turner and have over 50,000 of them. Why do I know that? Anyway, the bison wrap is really dang good with a touch of BBQ sauce and sweet potatoes that really hit the spot when you're hungry.  The only reason I have to take one star away is because it just seems a bit pricey - 13 or so dollars for super casual workout food in a wrap adds up fast."}
{"text":"What a shame, this place really have potential, I liked it so much and actually went there about 5~6 times, but I start to see their \"true side\" and after my last visit, I will not be going back.  In one of my visit, I ordered sautee sweet potatoes, and they completely burnt it, when I kindly suggest them try not to burn it, the hispanic cashier woman told us \"because some customer likes it crispy\", but crispy doesn't equal to burnt and bitter ok lady? rather than arguing back to customer, why not kindly apologize? and in my last visit, I bring in my own glass container for take out, hoping to do the best I could to help reduce plastic waste, when we asked that same hispanic cashier can we use our own container, she just said \"No, you will have to put it in your own container yourself\" we were waiting for explanation, but she didn't even bother explaining why until I called her later on and ask them why, I suggested them maybe next time when they said \"No\" to customer, it's good idea to offer explanation, and the woman just said \"because you guys didn't ask me why that's why I didn't say it\", wow, someone need to give her a customer service lesson, one signs of bad customer service is they will always try to reply back with some lame excuse, this company need to rethink about the quality of their employee.  So apparently they refuse to use customer's container due to health violation code, so if they can use the same hand handling money, took the dirty cardboard box to the back of the kitchen, and use that same hand to serve food for customer, you tell me which one is more health code violated, what a joke, I will NOT GOING BACK! Skinnyfat has much better customer service even if it cost a little more."}
{"text":"After having bad experience at the Durango location due to their bad customer service, I decided to call up the manager at this location and talk to them about this issue, and that's when I realized my nightmare hasn't ended yet.  When we called, this nice woman picked it up, and handed over to manager, then this man answered the phone with foreign language over and over, even though we keep saying \"Hello?\", so they hung up, and we called them again, the woman handed over to manager again, and we hear the foreign language again, so we finally asked \"can you speak English?\", and finally he said \"Yes\", but when we were complaining about the bad customer service, he barely answers anything, as if he barely understood what we are trying to say, and he keeps saying \"you come to us we give you free food\", he even said \"Oh I will have to call other location and find out who is lying\", but we didn't want any free food, we want to get our point across about their bad customer service, and who in their right mind dare to question customer's complain that he needs to find out who is lying? wow, just wow, I finally ask him to put me back to the woman who answers the phone because I felt like she sounded more thoughtful and alert, but he just said \"sorry we busy you come to our location next time to complain\" and then click, hung up on us again, we didn't give up and call them back, thank God the nice woman picked up, and listened to all our complain, and said she will try to forward our word to the manager, I think maybe she should be the manager and fire the manager herself.  Goodbye protein source."}
{"text":"This is an easy fix post gym.   It's located right beside the EOS durango gym, which makes it ridiculously convenient for a good meal afterwards.  The place is nice and simple inside. You order at the cash register and sit type of place. I had ordered a wrap and it was good!! Other than that, the prices were a little intimidating for me. Around $9-12 dollars for a meal that isn't really served fancy.   I'd only really come here if I were desperate for a healthy meal."}
{"text":"Love this place! Of course food is healthy and taste great! Place is always clean, friendly and it's nice that it's near the EOS gym! Nothing like a great healthy meal after a good workout!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. Great food quality and service. The people here really know how to put a good menu together and still be healthy."}
{"text":"I was brought here by a friend. I was absolutely impressed by the food, a little less impressed by the customer service. I ordered a salad and it took a little wait before I had got it, they forgot to bring forks with our meals.   The food definitely made up for this! I ordered a berry salad with balsamic dressing and my friend ordered the veggie burger. We were both thoroughly impressed with the quality of the ingredients and the flavors! I will be back"}
{"text":"Cashier named Crystal was AMAZING gave me my food fast and correctly and always has GREAT customer service with a big smile. Tysm!"}
{"text":"My stomach says YES! My wallet says OUCH! My body also loves me for this.  I know I'm paying for quality - I would eat here all the time if it wasn't so pricey. They don't have too many carb free options, for those on the Keto diet, but what options they do have are AMAZING!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite healthy eating spot! My first experience was really good. Quality ingredients and good flavors. I would eat here over Greens & Proteins any day. The atmosphere is very nice also so I would recommend this to anyone in the area."}
{"text":"Needed a quick bite so I thought I would try a protein shake. I had  peanut butter shake. Tasted like a 10.00 peanut butter milkshake to me. I believe it had Greek yogurt in there as well. I'm not a big protein shake person. They have all kinds of food next time I will order regular food as that looked really good. I was watching people eating as they're making my shake and thinking to myself why did I order a protein shake.  It was so good I sucked it down so fast, I suffered a Brain Freeze! Hate those!"}
{"text":"I love eating at the place, and when I'm in Las Vegas I go here about every day. This is one of the best tasting low carb low fat options in town! I also like greens and proteins, but this place has such delicious bowls it is a must try! Also comfortable environment I often bring my laptop with me and read / work after eating!"}
{"text":"I try and get out here as much as I can, especially after a workout. The rice bowls are awesome. Feels like a cheat meal but extremely healthy at the same time, so you don't feel guilty. Awesome hangout spot. I'm always bringing in someone new to show off this hidden gem, keep it up guys need another location closer to the strip ."}
{"text":"This is my favorite healthy meal , everything here are  fresh and delicious , my favorite is turkey wrap (cabbage wrap ) . A little pricey but I don't mind paying for good quality food"}
{"text":"It's nice to have the option to grab a health conscious meal on the go. Catering to the expanding fitness and health conscious community, TPS is a place you visit when you want to eat clean and lean. Sandwiched in a strip mall next to EOS Fitness on S. Durango, this is great place to grab grub and hit the road. That's exactly what I did on my lunch visit.   My Lunch:   I ordered my juice and lettuce wrap at the counter. The staff who helped me on my visit were very friendly and prepared my lunch to go in a timely fashion. The place was spotless top to bottom with a modern look and feel.   I ordered their Green Monster Juice that consists of juiced: Kale, Spinach, Apple, Cucumber and Lemon. I liked it and thought they had fair prices for their juice.   I also ordered their California Cob Wrap (w/ cabbage wrap): Chopped Chicken Breast, Egg Whites or Whole Egg, Turkey Bacon, Cilantro Pesto, Cherry Tomato, Cheddar Cheese, Romaine Lettuce and Avocado Paired w/Dijon Balsamic. I personally didn't care for the wrap. I ate half and threw the other half away. It really didn't have much flavor and could've used more seasoning. It was really bland and I hate spending money one food that stinks. I took the wrap to go. Otherwise, I would've probably sent it back and asked for a replacement or more condiments/seasoning.  Overall, I was underwhelmed with my visit due to the wrap. The staff, however, was very friendly and prompt. I also like that they offer the option to order online.  will need to give it another try. I will aim to try some of their breakfast options or another wrap.  Yelp Review #25 2016"}
{"text":"The food is good and provides protein in many different ways, but the service is lacking. The employes would rather you not be there and it's obvious."}
{"text":"I've been here once and reluctant to return, had the veggie burger and they served a Morning Star Frozen Veggie Patty, just like the ones I buy at Costco, hope they realize this culinary blunder, I will give it another try one day, maybe it was pre opening nerves and serving below par food."}
{"text":"Very good fresh healthy food. Very expensive I thought.  $45 for two sandwiches, a protein shake and ice tea."}
{"text":"Place has terrible service. Not prompt at all. The food is decently good but you will be waiting 35-45 minutes even when there's only 3 customers dining there, personally recommend Protein House over the protein source any day, the protein source won't even accommodate to your dietary. What healthy food place doesn't work with its customer in means of portions lol. Mediocre restaurant."}
{"text":"Their Acai Bowl wasn't great. There are several other places I would go to first over them when it comes to acai bowls.   Why?  Well there was no real flavor or freshness to the fruit in the bowl. They didn't have that many fruits in the bowl anyway so I guess that doesn't matter.  The part that really confused me was the warm acai... why would they make and/or allow the acai to be lukewarm? That really took me by surprise.   As far as cleanliness and customer service goes, it was all great. Nice place, nice service, and very clean."}
{"text":"Clean healthy eating. Losing a star for 3 reasons..1. Was LOST trying to order off the menu. When your leaving the gym and your starving the last thing you want to do is struggle through all the little details of what's being put into your dish. 2. I'm on a low carb diet and the name is deceiving. I had to filter through buns, potatoes, wraps. Ended up with a salad. Ugh. 3. Overpriced BUT good quality. Doesnt have to be so spendy."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. Never come. We order skinny salmon bowl and protein waffle towers. It took 30 minutes to have our food. Everyone behind us to order got their food already and we still waiting."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant three or four different times now ordering different things off the menu each time and I love them every single one! Nice staff they are really helpful when choosing different things on the menu when you're new and you're not too sure about what to order .Everything tastes so good . Plus you're being healthy!"}
{"text":"Tried pro waffle and ACG smoothie, very delicious. Also the restaurant is located near LVAC so the best place to get some good carbs and proteins after good workout."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and I usually like going once every few months after a work out at LVAC. There's a variety on the menu such as breakfast items, wraps, burgers, salads, and bowls. My favorite is the The Steak Lovers Bowl and I usually get that. I've also tried the Turkey Bowl as well and it's pretty good. I would say the food here is healthy, fresh and great after a work out or if you're around the area. It definitely fills me up.  You can order and sit down or do to-go if you wanted to. I usually just dine in. They also have an outside area to dine at; it'll be nice in the spring time to eat out there. They also take time to cook your food though, so be prepared to wait about 15-20 minutes before your food comes out. The price here is more towards the pricey side ($12-15) depending on what you order, however I think it's worth it!   Overall, I love this place and will be back!"}
{"text":"First let me say, my ahi salad was awesome. Delish. To die for. My new fav, indeed. But, the food isn't the reason for the meh rating. It's that there's some weirdness about this place.   1. There's a sign on the door which leads out to their beautiful, shaded patio with ceiling fans that says \"Please do not sit on patio\". No explanation as to why. Why can't I enjoy the beautiful weather outside? Especially since you are running a ceiling fan out there. 2. The music they play is horrible house type music you would hear in a dance club. It is way too loud and gave me a horrible headache. 3. The cashier was completely uninterested in smiling, being welcoming or doing anything but the bare minimum the job requires. When I asked about nutrition info, she said when her partner came back he'd be able to estimate it for me. No one followed up, and I saw the someone return. 4. When I ordered my salad I asked if they had wi-fi. Ms. Apathetic said yes. I tried to connect when I sat down and of course I needed a password, which I had to ask her for. What the heck? Why wouldn't you just tell someone that asked about wifi what the password is? BTW it is healthy2eat in case you need it too.  I left feeling like because I am not ripped and \"in shape\" she felt like I had no business being here. I think the delish food alone won't help this place survive. Time will tell I guess."}
{"text":"Top notch food with even better customer service! Each and every time I've been in the owner and his entire staff has gone above and beyond to meet my expectations of a friendly and inviting environment. The food is absolutely incredible. Some menu items that stand out are the Power Salmon Bowl, Steak Lover's Bowl, and the quinoa salad! If you're lucky and they have any peanut butter protein balls left.. BUY THEM! You won't be disappointed and they sell out fast! I love both locations and will continue recommending them!"}
{"text":"You have got to be kidding me right now. And this place is called \"The Protein Source?\""}
{"text":"Was my first time very nice place Very friendly staff... I think the menu is great and I will defiantly go back to try more of it !!"}
{"text":"Food was awesome and the service is great. I love the bison burgers there, but my favorite is the steak lovers bowl. Definitely a great healthy choice for anyone who wants a good quick meal guilt free."}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous!  the most delicious health foods!  this place is designed for athletes, but anyone should try it.  I came with my athlete daughter last night for dinner and it was so good we came back for breakfast.  last night we has the Bison Bowl and elk bowl both were really lean and tasty patties over mounds of very fresh sautéed veggies over a big pile of very soft and tasty sweet potatoes.  Fabulous.   this morning after the gym we looked at each other and decided to come back.  we both got the ahi tuna bowls.  their fresh juices and protei. shkes are awsomw as well.  try thier protein peant butter protien balls, they were grest.  this place is very reasonable given the foods $8 to $13 per meal, but a great value."}
{"text":"I live right down the street so I've been here many times. I've dined in as well as ordered to go. They messed up both me and my boyfriend's to-go order last night but this is the first time it's ever happened so I wasn't upset. Also we both agreed that the food was too tasty to be mad.  I always order the Mediterranean Quinoa... so delicious! I've also had the Western Avocado Salad (minus the cheese) but this was meh at best. Last night I ordered the California Cobb wrap (also without cheese) and in a cabbage wrap. While I was bummed because the eggs were completely missing and it was hard to eat because it kept falling apart, it was still very good. I was actually very surprised at how much flavor it had with and without the dressing included on the side. I loved it and will be ordering it again (please don't forget my eggs next time!). My boyfriend had the Steak Lovers Bowl and although he asked for jasmine rice and got brown rice instead, he also said it was super delicious. Eh, we were still pretty hungry after but we did just finish a Pilates workout.  Additionally, I love the people that work there. They're really smiley and very helpful. I always appreciate them!  The downside for me is the price. The Mediterranean Quinoa always seems great to me because if I'm under $10 for lunch, I'm happy... and it's well under that. In fact, all their salads are reasonably priced unless you add a protein, which I never do. But between two of us last night, we nearly spent $30. And that's just entrees, we didn't order any drinks. That's a problem because that's the price you'd spend for 2 entrees at a nice sit down place. I know they use quality ingredients but The Protein Source is more of an after-gym-healthy-bite-to-eat spot and I think some things should be less expensive. If they were, I would eat here more often than I already do. I usually meal prep my own protein, carb, and green and if they lowered the prices a bit, I'd do build-your-owns here pretty often. Though that's my gripe, I will say that they have made positive changes to their menu recently. Being a healthy spot, I was shocked they didn't have nutritional information posted. Their menu now has this info which is great!  Tip: Check in on Yelp for $1 off a protein shake or juice :)"}
{"text":"Healthy food spot located on flamingo and 215! I stopped by after my workout at LVAC. What a menu they have! They have many different choices. I went with the steak lovers bowl and absolutely loved it! Packed with flavor, veggies, and I was full about halfway but kept going because it tasted so great. I took it to go and waited for about 10 mins, fast service for what I got. I understand these places use quality food which makes it more expensive, but it hurt a little to pay $15 for one meal  watch your wallet if you're trying to make this a habit! Other than that, I'll definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Loved this placed had it for the first time yesterday I had the vegan chill and protein brownie both amazing staff was super friendly and clean :) I have a feeling this might be my next obsession :) I highly recommend this spot plus outside seating is so pretty :)"}
{"text":"The Protein Source - Las Vegas (Southwest)  Got Protein?  Well, they do.  The Protein Source is conveniently located a couple of doors down from EoS.  The location is perfect if you're one of those gym goers that must have protein and/or carbs post-workout.  It's so obvious that the Protein Source was built by bodybuilders.  Everything is weighed and they never question you or give you a weird look if you're adding triple protein to you meal.  The Protein Source just gets it.  You'll find protein shakes, smoothies, protein bowls, wraps, protein bars, and supplements at The Protein Source. They even serve breakfast pancakes and waffles. The Protein Source is not just limited to healthy eaters, Bros, and IIFYMer's.  The Protein Source still has enough on their menu to satisfy anyone.  Yeah Buddy!!"}
{"text":"Love this spot. Great food & protein drinks that are perfectly priced. Conveniently located right off the 215/Durango."}
{"text":"Wanted to find a place to eat that was healthy. We usually go to greens and proteins but wanted to try something new and came across protein source which was literally down the street. The ambience is industrial modern inside and the staff was friendly. They have juices, salads, wraps, and build your on plate. Our dishes were delicious, simple and clean. A lot of the dishes you can make at home, but if you're going for a quick healthy meal this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots, I could literally grab lunch here everyday. The Lean Mean Ahi Machine bowl is my shit. Fresh and healthy food, quick service."}
{"text":"Very nice place to eat healthy food and very clean as well.  The food came in 10 min so no big deal... And it's fresh which is the most important part.  Next time problem going to try the protein shake."}
{"text":"While the wait sucked, the food was really yummy. Our cashier seemed to be new as she kept messing up our order, but the other cashier was able to take our order.   So that's the service, now the food! I built my own plate with salmon, mixed veggies, add avocado, and sweet potato hash. It was delicious! The salmon was the perfect amount, the veggies tasted a little oily but still good (not over cooked, still had the crunch) and the sweet potato hash was good as well, had good flavor. My boyfriend, who was upset at the wait time, said the wait was worth his bulk up buffalo wrap. And he finished his salad. My cousin got the protein waffles with strawberry banana and chocolate and it came with a side of turkey bacon for extra protein. She devoted the whole thing.   Now I wish I had one on my side of town :( very good alternative to greens and protein, and slightly cheaper :)"}
{"text":"We all know how hard it is to find something that is healthy, fast and not overly expensive. Protein Source checks off all of those needs and more! Their protein shakes are delicious and a life saver when in a time crunch. Definitely worth a try - you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!!! There is nothing like a great workout followed by a healthy dinner, and this place delivers just that. The West-Chix is by far the yummiest, healthy wrap I've ever eaten. All of the ingredients are super fresh! And the Peanut Butter protein balls are the perfect after workout snack. The staff is super friendly to boot. This restaurant is definitely going to be worked into my weekly schedule!"}
{"text":"The menu is great. My vegan protein shake was good. The service was kind but super slow and the wait was long at 1130 am on a Thursday. No sense of urgency here."}
{"text":"Food was great and my cashier was such a sweetheart wish I had gotten his name. I had the BBQ Chicken Bowl and a Clean Sweep. I'm not one whose into juicing it seems like every time I tried it the flavor I created was a total turn off and it kinda steered me away from pressed juices. Luckily, I gave a Clean Sweep a try and it was delicious! This place is a perfect example that clean eating can be tasty too. Makes me not dread dieting or eating right :)"}
{"text":"I love the decor of this place! I also loved that they did not have a SODA machine in there. About time a place realizes that stuff is bad for you. The menu options were great but they did take a long time for the food to come out. I got a juice here and it was probably only 12 oz vs the 16 oz I paid for due to there being ice in it and was still not filled to the top!"}
{"text":"The night shift! Results produced in a timely friendly fashion! Couldn't ask for anything more!"}
{"text":"I have been to the protein source twice the first time I absolutely loved it and had the highest of confidence in their quality and overall health and nutrition of the restaurant. This morning I went to get a recovery protein shake and I ordered a shake with peanut butter in it and as I watch them make it I see them pull out a big tub of Jiff peanut butter! I am sorry but if I am paying eight dollars for a protein shake I am sure as heck hope that they're using the most high quality natural products there are! This has made me question the overall quality and nutrition of the entire restaurant to be honest. Call me dramatic but that's how I feel about the matter."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!! Highly suggest their energy cakes for breakfast (protein pancakes with assorted fruit and sugar free syrup) and their American bowl for lunch (ground bison, agave BBQ sauce, sweet potato hash, veggies, avocado). Everything is SO fresh, delicious, and most importantly healthy! I am on a pretty strict diet consisting of few carbs and feel as though this place is very accommodating to that and I still feel like I'm treating myself!"}
{"text":"I love this place. When I'm not in the mood to eat my meal prepped food this is the first place I turn to. Healthy but flavorful and super filling. Most morning I get a regular açaí bowl and maybe the waffle protein stack. I can't finish it all, but I am sated until my workout at around 4-5ish pm. I do fasted cardio and intermittent fasting and when finally do break my fast, I'm always excited for my food lol. One bad thing that doesn't matter to most, but I did get a blueberry with mold growing once. But since then it's been all good from there."}
{"text":"What a great place! Cameron took great care of us. We told him it was our first time and he went over the menu with us. The place is very clean and the menu has loads of options. I got the berry salad and it was perfect and not dripping with dressing. My daughter got the acai bowl and loved it, too. I highly recommend this place :)"}
{"text":"Great place if you're looking for healthy alternatives! This is my second time eating at The Protein Source, but first time at this location. I don't mean to be bias, but the only thing I can really compare it to is Greens and Protiens, and I would choose Greens and Protiens over The Protein Source. Mainly because I feel G&P has a little bigger portions, sauces are more flavorful (esp. the cilantro pesto) and I like how G&P has a free green cucumber water drink.   Back to The Protein Source the location is easy to get to, and parking is abundant. It was open till 10 PM today, which is the reason why I came. Design and space is clean, trendy and seats are comfortable. Customer service is great, Danny greeted me right away and asked if needed help with anything. He gave me suggestions and even let me try 3 other sauces when I didn't like the cilantro pesto. The cilantro pesto was very watery, and I like it roughly chopped when I can see the separate pieces in pesto. My favorite sauce was the light white balsamic vinaigrette. BBQ sauce was good, tangy and rich. Salsa has a good taste and filled with flavor also.   I built my own meal with chicken, cauliflower mash and avocado. It was good, clean and what I'd expect from a healthy meal. Avocado looked only to be about an ounce and whole Danny said chicken. Was 6 ounces prior to cooking, afterwards it seemed more like 3.5-4 oz. I even ordered to go for lunch tomorrow- chicken, mixed veggies, steamed broccoli with teriyaki agave. The portion is good one one small meal. I do appreciate the calorie and macro count in the menu.  I would order here again and try other items from the menu. I wish they had gluten free and or dairy free desserts!"}
{"text":"I heard a lot of good things about this kitchen so I finally decided to try one of their locations. My first meal here was a Steak & Eggs plate which came with a big piece of premium tenderloin steak, your choice of eggs or egg whites, sweet potato hash and stevia BBQ sauce on the side . Let me tell people, the food was bomb. Clean ,flavorful and not to filing which means the quality of the product is really high.   I highly recommend this place. Awesome decor ,ambience and happy smiley staff. I loved it.   Next time is juice bar testing :))"}
{"text":"Went in for usual Fillet and Eggs today. Was there 3weeks ago and it was GREAT. For some reason today the order taker perhaps didn't listen or the cook didn't care. We ordered 2 Fillet& Eggs (order no 17) medium RARE-came out Medium WELL and Luke warm. Also this week they gave us both half the amount of scrambled eggs. Ordered more and duly paid the extra $3.24. We were hungry,did not wish to return food and wait as we had work to do. Guys a little more consistency would be magic. Overall it's turned around so much since our 1st visit(now 7th). Good to see the venue busy on our last two visits. Will be be back"}
{"text":"My office ordered this restaurant via Postmates. I ordered the steak bowl and it is a large hot delicious portion of brown rice, steamed veggies, big chunks of lean beef and a fresh half avocado sliced on top. Others ordered the steak chili and the  moco loco and both were delivered hot and delicious as well as large portions. Can't wait to go back here!"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service at both locations. The guys ( Dante and Xavier?) working here were very welcoming and knowledgeable. I had a good long discussion with Dante who seemed passionate about what he was doing. I would give this place a 10/10 on the service alone. The food just happened to be great as well. I will be a regular customer from now on. 5 stars!!!"}
{"text":"It's hard to know what's better - the food or the staff. This was the best find while on travel in Vegas. Many thanks to the helpful and upbeat team members who helped make every purchase a success. Even the payment process is easy, with emailed receipts. I wish we had a location in Santa Barbara!"}
{"text":"I love the food and the protein in the shakes doesn't make me feel funny it's clean, nice staff , fairly reasonably prices, alot to choose from , like the music  , very consistant , wish it was open 24hours or until 3am"}
{"text":"Awesome food & juices! The owners are very involved in operations which made my experience very personal. I will definitely be back. Thanks for the great lunch!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Healthy, good food portion, excellent presentation and friendly staffs. Good vibes!! Simple and Clean!!"}
{"text":"I've only had their breakfast and shakes but they are always consistent. I'm giving them 4 stars because the first time I ordered from here they completely forgot about me and I was sitting waiting 15 minutes for a protein shake before someone realized. Their breakfast burrito with egg whites is my favorite but if you're ordering it to go make sure you get salsa, pesto, and tomato on the side or you'll end up with a soggy burrito."}
{"text":"First off, my boyfriend and I LOVE the food here, much preferred over Greens and Proteins! Delicious with lots of options, especially if you want vegan or paleo. But, we've had some pretty bad customer service experiences here. The last time we went we ordered online, and went to pick it up. The boy up front (although nice) seemed clueless when we said we were there for our order. I also asked for extra sauce which I did too notate on the order in the comments. Well, we ended up waiting 20 extra minutes and our food had already been ready, just sitting there. The only reason we got our food then was because we were so impatient that we asked. Boy up front seemed confused and gave us the order per our command to check (the bag was right next to him). Also, my extra sauce was definitely not in there. The vibe was not great as customers seemed angry with the long wait times. This experience does not make us want to come back, but we also love the food. Possibly plan on waiting extra for your food if you are getting it to go.   Update: Tried to go back to the other location and my kale was forgotten in my build your own meal. My boyfriend had to sit and wait again for a to go order. Protein Source, get your staff going for real on the efficiency. Everyone is so nice but also we need our food."}
{"text":"The Protein Source is my \"go-to\" spot when ive had a long work day and cooking/cleaning is the last thing on my mind. I love that I can stay on my diet here with all the great options and even \"build your own menu\" ! The staff is great,  and now with the new perka app im even getting rewarded with discounts ! :-) whenever I have family or friends visiting I take them here! Everyone loves PS!!! THANK YOU"}
{"text":"Perfect for anyone looking for a great healthy meal around the Vegas area. If you're on a meal plan but you came to Vegas to party this is a good spot to not miss a step. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Always an enjoyable time. Place is spotless, atmosphere is lively, and last but not least the food is amazing! People always say nothing that's healthy tastes enjoyable but Protien source has found a way. Breakfast lunch and dinner items for everyone. Leaves you feeling good about yourself and your diet. I workout a lot and the hardest thing for me to keep up with is a healthy diet. Protien source makes it really easy. I'd go back again and again. I'm not really sure why there's any bad reviews on here. People really like to hate on this town. I hope y'all can see past the shadyness. Haters gonna hate. You keep doing you Protien source!!!"}

{"text":"I've come here a few times and I haven't been disappointed yet. I don't live near this place, but I seek it out when on this side of town. I've had their cucumber shots with salmon. Delicious and low carb. This morning I had \"light start\" which is 2 eggs, turkey sausage (this has a spicy kick!), and 2 pieces of 9 grain toast with a side of salsa. Pretty good. I would have preferred another option instead of toast, but I was too tired to figure it out. They use high quality protein - Dymatize Elite XT and MRM veggie protein options. It would be great if this place listed all the macros instead of just calories and protein or would sync up with MyFitness Pal. I'm deducting one star for not opening before 8am and blasting club music at 8am. I'm too tired for this sh!t. Need more coffee before club music. :)"}
{"text":"This place is clean, welcoming, and DELICIOUS. The menu is extensive and they have something for everyone. I got a paradise shake (vanilla whey, coconut water, strawberries, pineapple I think....one other fruit. Its really tasty) and it's the perfect blend of sweet and tangy, light and filling. I definitely recommend this place to anyone in the area. I'll definitely be back! I love it!"}
{"text":"Had the Big Kahuna Bison burger and sweet potato mash, awesome. Went back and had Ahi Tuna with asparagus and sweet potato hash, so good. I had to go back and get the Source bison burger, slightly over cooked, but still tasted great. My wife has had the Berry and nuts salad and also the Steak lover's bowl, of course I had to try them, and I loved them both. My wife has actually been happy with two meals in a row and that is rare. So far so good, I'm still making my way down the menu."}
{"text":"This place is great for healthier choices even if you're vegan. So far I've tried maybe 8 items on the menu and haven't been disappointed. The only thing that ruins this place is the music. It's definitely going for the Vegas theme by always pumping upbeat house/workout music. I wish they played music that was a little more chill so it'd have more of a cafe feel, and it'd be easier to have conversations or work on my computer. The music becomes obnoxious. But food is great!"}
{"text":"GREAT service, great menu! The food tasted amazing and the juices are freshly made. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Another good clean eating restaurant. The wife and I both got the \"big boy bison bowl\". Wife was skeptical about getting bison, but she was pleasantly surprised with its flavor. I'll be back if in the area, not sure if I would make it a destination. A bit pricey"}
{"text":"After a long hike at Red Rock decided to stop here as this place has been on my list of food places I want to try. I've lived in the Centennial area of Vegas for 10 years so it's not all the time I am on this side of town, but I'm strongly considering moving because all the dang good food spots are on the south side! Including this place. I ordered the ahi bowl and it was really good!! Very flavorful. And being from Hawaii nothing will compare to my hometown but I will say after my standard \"sniff test\", \"pick at it test\", and \"sniff it one more time test\" (c'mon we are dealing with seared fish in the desert people, better safe than sorry and ya know you all do the sniff test to don't even act like you don't!) I felt safe eating it haha! The sauce that comes with it is delicious, and I am anxious to try the bison burger next. Some people around me were having wraps and they looked really good as well. I had to knock of a star though because of the price...meh...a bit expensive. BUT hey so are cancer treatments so better to spend more on healthy foods than on medical bills right? There was a slight wait but staff was nice about it and a longer wait just shows that everything is being cooked fresh. I shall be back!"}
{"text":"Best in town.  Nice people great food healthy. Can't believe I waited all this time to get healthy"}
{"text":"Really love their food. They do such a great job bringing great healthy food and lots of options. Great staff and service. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Love this place!! I eat there for any meal! I love the protein pancakes anytime of the day! My solid back up is the southwest chicken chili! I think I stop in once a day for a muscle madness protein shake! If you want to look good naked eat here! A lot!"}
{"text":"Great updated menu!! Awesome little health food spot.  I love that they have sweet potato sides as that's my go to carb.  The food is fresh and just what I expected.   Cons: Could be a bit more informative about their menu.  They have such a great outdoor space and totally need to dress it up.  Candles on the tables at night,  some fresh flowers in table top vases and potted patio plants would really help.   Overall love this place but they need some style in the decor."}
{"text":"The food was just okay, not delicious. I order the chicken wrap with side salad. I liked the protein cookie they had for snacks. However I think for $14 it could've tasted a little better. The woman also said my order would take two minutes, it took about ten. There was a cute buff guy working which is a plus lol. He was nice said thank you and have a nice day. There a few things they need to improve though."}
{"text":"Came here when it first opened up and became a regular and liked the way it was and how the food tasted. As time went on the service took longer to get your food and the quality became crap. I'd thought I'd give it one more chance and ended up being disappointed with the results. I feel as though they make you food and the quality of service depending if you tip or not and the amount. I definitely have noticed the attitude from the employees that work the front when you don't tip or don't tip a lot. As I said I gave it another chance and even gave a big tip to see if they would change, but unfortunately it didn't. My salmon tasted like it had a huge amount of salt on it and was so over cooked that half of it was gray, the quinoa was all watery and it basically seemed liked my food was sitting in a bed of water. It was disgusting and am disappointed with the service and how much the quality is gone down. Definitely wouldn't recommend this location to anyone, you'll be completely disappointed with the food quality!"}
{"text":"Food takes a minute to get out to u but it's worth the wait.  Probably one of my favorite healthy/post workout places n they even have smoothies n juices.  Check it out u won't b disappointed"}
{"text":"Love this place everytime im here. Owner is super friendly and almost always there. I've had the salmonyaki wrap twice and it's great. The Big Boy Bison bowl was tasty as well and actually being a big boy it did fill me up well, the meats used here taste very high quality. Most recently had the elk hunter and was happy with that as well very similiar to the Big boy Bison bowl just a change in meat. The source protein pancakes were awesome all around. My favorite has to be the Acai bowl though. I never was the type to get anything like that but was just talking to the owner (big Brazilian guy super friendly but can't remember his name) and was feeling in the dumps after a workout and he suggested it and made it himself and it was amazing. Super light and fluffy almost whipped consistency but also still solid and not whipped at the same time, and the perfect blend of sweet and natural no processed or artificial blends and nicely matched with the shredded coconut. I got it again since but the way he makes it is literally one of a kind I'd highly recommend asking him to make you one if the chance presents itself. Being a unhappy regular at greens and proteins I was happy when TPS opened and even had a small discussion with the owner about how I felt about greens and proteins and we got into a pretty long discussion about the difference between someone's idea of healthy and healthy, a meal you see as healthy and really giving your body nutrition and he really nailed it on the head. And that to me is the big difference between the two (also the fact that I spend $50 and leave hungry at G&P and I could spend the same at TPS and feel full for a few hours-for two people) Prices are very similar to other health food places but the portions and the flavors are really the big difference here $14 will get you a big bowl of veggies sweet potatoe mash and high quality elk or bison that you probably won't be able to finish without a massive appetite and $9 will get you a tasty wrap or breakfast plate. Speaking of, breakfast all day!  Another thing I like is the music, it's a massive flashback of fun and good electronic music.  And a huge thing for me is that this place DOES NOT have a soda machine. Instead you can fill your drinks will vitamin water ONE choice of coke zero or diet coke can't remember or powerade. Now that to me is big, how can you be eating at a \"health\" food restaurant that servers soda?  Protein source is very well connected with their customers and feedback and you can tell just by the menu.  Side note the low calorie low sugar sides and sauces served here are AMAZING the stevia bbq sauce is by far my favorite.  All in all 5 stars and everytime I come in I see more and more people becoming regulars. Way better than G&P more passion and flavor go into every dish and more of the actual food too."}
{"text":"I order Lean Mean Ahi Machine and Beetphrodisiac it is very good this is my new place for some healthy drinks and meals."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and was deciding to do a review earlier but it just so happens that I had a very very horrible experience today. Came in around 9 or maybe a little before then on a Thursday night for a post-workout meal. There were 3 guys working. My past experiences here have been great with no complaints, but tonight is such a 180.   I ordered a garden harvest turkey burger (light on the mustard) or something like that with fries. My bf ordered the egg-Sparagus with chicken. The guy taking my order was cool, joked around a bit. He asked, \"for here or to go.\" As I was answering for here, he cut me off & said, \"ah, I got you.\" Food came out maybe 10-15 mins later in a plastic bag... In my head, I'm like, \"okay, this is alright. We can just head home and watch Netflix.\" I guess I made the mistake of not checking my order before I left and not asking for my receipt.   Anyways, so we get home. I open my plastic container, lo & behold, there was my burger with sweet potato hash. Not the fries that I ordered. My bf opens his container and there's NO chicken. The burger I had was dry (im not sure if they usually put the sauce on the side like that) & salty. The hash did not taste good. At all. I'm shocked at this point cos I've always had good service and good food from this place. I don't like being the rude customer & I certainly don't want to be an annoying one either, but seriously... I PAID extra money for chicken that I DIDNT get. Tonight's experience just ruined this place for me. & will really have to see if I we're returning because my meal was not satisfying."}
{"text":"Great consistent healthy food. If you're trying to eat clean or close to it, I would definitely go here."}
{"text":"The portions are so tiny even for a petite person like me and prices are expensive. Expect to pay $15-20 per meal with tax and tip included. The food is good quality though. The meat was tender and juicy and veggies were fresh but I left the place feeling hungry and unsatisfied :( I might come back and try their smoothies but I think I like greens and P better."}
{"text":"This is my favorite post workout meal. Everything I've had on the menu has been very tasty. Im obsessed with the egg-sparagus salad and I add tuna. Its thick and flavorful! I love the staff too, everyone is always so helpful!"}
{"text":"As a \"vegan\" restaurant that promotes itself as a place to get your \"protein\" source... but lacks a simple but main vegan protein staple... eg: where is the TOFU? The Veggie burger I ordered was more like veggie mush.  I was very disappointed. They also advertise their protein shakes as \"vegan\" friendly but they are using Dymatize's Elite XY Whey Isolate... which contains whey isolate and milk proteins... therefore it is not vegan. On a brighter note the smoothies and juices look really good and probably what keeps this place going. If you're vegan though, I would go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Sure looks like a nice clean place . Price is expensive but that's ok if it is good food . Well today me and a few co workers were eating lunch there and a tiny bug came crawling out of my buddy's burger ... no problem get him a re fund and a new plate right ? No they washed the plate and gave him the food back no refund or anything . What crappy service . I sure hope one day one of those pricks working there has a bug crawling out of their food while eating it .... DISGUSTING joint won't be around much longer ."}
{"text":"Lovin this place!  Been twice in the past week.  While it's a tad pricey, you're getting your money's worth in quality.   The two items I've had so far are the Energy Cakes and the American Muscle Bowl.    Energy Cakes:  Simply fluffy and delicious. Great portion size and they're topped with wonderful fresh fruit and shredded coconut.  The side of agave nectar adds just the right amount of sweetness, but to be honest you almost don't need it.    American Muscle Bowl: DELICIOUS AND FILLING! Ground Bison, Sweet Potatoes, Avocado, Zucchini, Broccoli with a side of Stevia BBQ sauce.  Honestly, it didn't need the sauce.  The meat was so full of flavor and juicy!  I love this dish because you have everything you need: Healthy Fats, Fiber, Cruciferous Greens and Protein.  Can't wait to go back and try one of those burgers.  My only little bugaboo(which I didn't factor into my rating) was that they don't have whole milk for the coffee.  I know they're trying to be healthy with skim milk, but whole milk is much healthier for you."}
{"text":"I highly recommend the Ahi Tuna Bowl. The ingredients are always fresh and the sauce they give you on the side is delicious. A little pricey for what you get but you are paying for quality."}
{"text":"I created a Yelp just to review one of my new favorite restaurants, The Protein Source.    The food and service at The Protein Source is absolutely phenomenal.  I spoke to Claud (I believe that's how his name is spelled) and Mason, who were both friendly and willing to chat with us about the menu.  The restaurant was very clean and welcoming.    I ordered the Protein Source Signature burger and it may be one of the best burgers I have ever had.  Also, the burger was very filling and had a side of sweet potato hash.  During my meal, the staff made sure to check up on me to see if I was enjoying the meal, which I was.    The Protein Source provided me one of the best meals I have ever had with great service.  I will definitely be visiting frequently.    Good luck to the competitors."}
{"text":"Do NOT by any means go here! I made the mistake of coming here, now it's the only place I eat at. My pans are collecting rust, the fridge has become a beer cooler like college again, and my dishwasher is unemployed. It's completely unacceptable!  But seriously - if you care about fitness and well balanced meals, this is the only place for you. Perfectly balanced meals, high quality meat, huge shake selection, and involved management. A lot of careful planning went into everything on the menu here.  Give it a shot and free up some space in your kitchen. I'm thinking of just turning mine into a second living room."}
{"text":"Nothing bad to say about this spot... I've tried several things but the salmon power bowl is my favorite... place is always clean, I've never had to wait long for my food, I don't get \"the itus\" after eating the food and the online ordering process is easy..."}
{"text":"We stumbled across this place while visiting another protein shop and we were intrigued by their menu. We returned after watching a movie and tried their BigBoy Bison burger with egg whites and a side of sweet potato mash. My husband and I throughly enjoyed it. We also polished off one of their 3-packs of peanut butter balls. My husband is not a fan of peanut butter but he enjoyed it.  They provide great healthy alternatives and serve breakfast all day! Will definitely be back to try one of their juices and/or shakes!"}
{"text":"Food just not what i was hoping for. Heard nothing but great things about this place so I finally gave it a try. Lettuce was brown and the wrap was torn so i had to eat it more like a salad. Juices are over priced but good. Staff didn't seem to care about the guest. I overheard people sitting next to me complaining. Will try again but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"Huge menu.  All proteins Super lean.   Great choices for my vegan weekends.  Staff is well trained and understands how to compound menu with workouts.     I have the Bison and Elk bowl there now.    Better than Greens and Proteins up the street."}
{"text":"Food is good & the atmosphere is nice. That's the only reason for any stars. The customer service is downright deplorable. Two girls behind the counter were too busy talking to acknowledge customers. I walked up ready to order and the girl behind the register was too busy playing with her phone to realize I was there. When she handed me my to-go order (after about a 30 minute wait). She tossed it on the counter and walked away. I said that you and she didn't acknowledge it at all."}
{"text":"This is hands down one of my favorite lunch spots for healthy, delicious, flavorful food and drinks. The smoothies before or after the gym are great as well. I've had some of the wraps, bowls, salad and fresh sashimi style choices as well. My friends that I have invited to try it with me loved it as well. The price point might be higher than some but it's so worth it by having high quality fresh food. You can also order in advance and they are also part of the Perka app that racks up points towards future purchases.   There is no reason to not try it! Something for everyone."}
{"text":"I love The Protein Source because the food is delicious, healthy, fresh and they have many gluten-free options. They also have the most amazing people working there like Dante, who help you pick the perfect meal."}
{"text":"Been here three or four times now.  Food has been really good every time.  I recommend it for people looking for healthier alternatives.  I usually order the Salmon Wrap."}
{"text":"Man this place is the bomb!!!  Perfect being that it's next to EOS!!!  I use to get the Light Start and oatmeal all the time when I use to come early for breakfast because it always hit the spot!!!  Now it's all about the after-workout Protein shakes for my guns  lol.  I also get the Western Salad and I add Salmon!!! OMG that is the bomb!!! And I just tried the ACAI bowl the other day too!!! Man instead of wasting an easy $7 to $15 dollars on Starbucks I'm all about that ACIA BOWL!!! Staff is always up beat and great plus what I really like is this place clean 24/7!!!! As a pro athlete and trainer, this is the spot"}
{"text":"Decent food, but not so great workers. No apologies for any mistakes, or any type of customer service whatsoever. Seriously made me feel as if it was my fault that they did not bring my other order, and the guy that took my order a few minutes ago looked confused. I understand that if it was busy, but there were only 3 people there."}
{"text":"I love this place and this time around decided to try something different. I got the tropical green juice which is always delicious. And decided to try the bulk up bison protein style. I got my son the Chick-A-Dilla. Let's just say my food wasn't that great. The meat was dry and lacked flavor. The cheese they used wasn't melted and looked like it was processed cheese you can buy at the store . I ended up taking it out of the wrap and just ate the sweet potatoes. The side salad was pretty good wish there was more. My sons food was a little better. The salsa the serve on the side was pretty good. Only downfall with his was the cheese again wasn't really melted but still was a little better than mine. If I could give 3.5 stars I would."}
{"text":"The Aloha burger was amazing as well as the Raw Green juice! The side of sweet potato hash is delicious as well. I definitely found my new spot for a yummy healthy meal. Oh and the peanut butter balls to die for!!"}
{"text":"This is a place you go for healthy options when you are too tight on time or lack the effort to cook at home. Could I cook chicken and veggies just as good at home for a fraction of the price? Yes 100%. But sometimes convenience comes at a cost. As far as the service goes, they seemed a bit short staffed for how busy it was. Service was a bit slow and they forgot part of my order. A bit of a let down but I may give it another chance if I'm in a pinch."}
{"text":"My first time here and the food is great !!  They have great choices with turkey. I  definitely will be back"}
{"text":"Ordered a turkey burger and fries.  But seriously, it looks like I ate some of it already."}
{"text":"If I could a zero star review I would. The food there is absolutely tasteless, my 2 week old meal prep taste better then this garbage. I had the burger, and it was dry and tasteless, the egg on top was floppy and burnt. The only thing they proceeded to get right was placing lettuce on top of the burger. If your trying to eat healthy I recommend making your own food."}
{"text":"The protein source is my local go-to for healthy food.  They are located next to EOS fitness on Durango.  I had the Mediterranean Quinoa salad and a Tropical Green juice.  I have to say that their food presentation is like instagram perfect.  My quinoa salad came out exactly like what the pictures showed.  Best of all, it was delicious and had a very good serving size.  My juice was also done really well - it had a good balance of fruits, so the Spanish and kale taste wasn't too bad.    Overall - I love their food and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for awhile and today was my opportunity. I really wanted a  yummy protein shake . I saw pictures on the door for the protein shakes so I was happy to give them a try. I walked in and was immediately pleased yet a bit overwhelmed by the menu on the wall. I read and looked and tried very hard to find the list of protein shakes , they were not on that menu on the wall.I had to yell out to the girl behind the counter. She seemed not at all pleased that I was there and didn't know what to do. She was just unfriendly and looked miserable at her job. I was at the S. Durango location at approximately 1:30 pm.  I asked her if they had protein shakes and she said yes they are on the menu then she turned away. I said hey I'm sorry , this is my first time. I read the large menu again and still could not find the shakes. A customer then showed me the printed laminate menu which did have the shakes listed. Ok, so I chose the Hawaiian. I then had to ask the girl , do you accept cash or do I have to swipe my card on the iPad . She said they accepted cash and then I ask, So do I just order here on the iPad , she again seemed like I was a terrible interruption to her day. I tried to press the screen on the iPad to order but could not seem to figure it out. Nothing came up , the screen did nt provide a menu. I tried and tried and the other people just stared at me . I was so uncomfortable and felt so awkward because I had no direction of how to even order a protein shake and I couldn't even get a human to help me. So ridiculous that employees are standing 2 feet in front of you and can't help. Honestly , I said it was my first time in , well I guess it's my last time too. It would be helpful to be kind to new customers and try to assist if they look like they might be struggling to figure out your system. Great way to alienate people. Great concept , would ave loved to try more of your foods and other items ."}
{"text":"Found the place by accident during a business trip. Food and juices are fantastic, can't stop from coming back whenever I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"I've come here a good amount of times and haven't had a bad food experience. The turkey burger is my favorite item so far. Food doesnt come out fast, but they have good music playing so at least your entertained a bit while waiting. All in all, I enjoy coming here when I don't feel like cooking."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here the other night and were very happy about our experience. They have a good size menu for those of us looking for healthy, fresh unprocessed foods. I had the Mahi Mahi, my husband had Ali Tuna, both were excellent, the vegetables were also fresh and the sweet potato hash was wonderful. The only comment I'd make would be for the staff to lighten up a little, I know it's the first couple weeks and all, but a smile would have been nice."}
{"text":"Walking out the front doors of the gym, out to my car, and my stomach growls. First thing I do is yelp to see what's nearby. About 3 businesses down is this place called the protein source. I decided to check it out because of the convince, and because I am trying to eat healthier( who isn't lol). When I walk in there wasn't many people there so I was able to quickly scan the restaurant and order. I got some ground bison mix with avocado and barbecue sauce. It was about $12 and the portion, although seeming small, kept me full until it was around dinner time. Go check this place out if you're looking for a convenient place to workout as well as for a nice bite afterwards"}
{"text":"So Far I have only been here 2 times and ordered the same food! But I really liked it and its closer to the EOS gym which is convenient for me.  Kinda pricey, but it is healthy food. You expect to pay a good price for good quality food! i'll be back!! :)"}
{"text":"This place is delicious! They have a very nice ambiance outside but the weather didn't let us take advantage of it. It's a bit small so I'm sure it fills up fast during their peak hours. I ate the BigBoy Bison Burger but ate it way to fast to take a picture :/ Luckily my girlfriend to a pic of her salad! Definitely a good place to visit if you're trying to eat healthy!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and amazing food. Dante made the experience fun and easy and we will definitely be eating here again."}
{"text":"Great small juice and protein bar with food. Smelled a bit odd and was very cold inside!!! Staff was friendly and it was close to home. I tried it out because LVAC would not let me to the juice bar without my member card, which is expired. Glad it was cause my PB lovers protein shake was the best. A bit pricy but was worth my cravings"}
{"text":"Food is AMAZING !!!!! I can't wait to go back and try out more items on the menu!! They are great priced and healthy items with a lot of flavor!!"}
{"text":"Bomb steak bowl the best \"protein place I have been to yet over greens and proteins for sure"}
{"text":"Awesome food. Better than Greens and Proteins right across the parking lot. The pineapple power is awesome and my better half built her own meal. They got plenty of choices and everything that I have tried is delicious. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Service was way too slow!!!! No one person apologized or explained why it took forever to get one bowl. Needs help with service in a major way."}
{"text":"The prices are high, but the food is worth it! My step father had a strawberry shake and loved it. I've had a few of their sandwiches and they were all great!"}
{"text":"Quick service, a little overpriced. I like the shakes. They're great and have the perfect texture. I feel an energy boost and not very bloated. Happy with my visit here"}
{"text":"Expect to wait a remarkably looooong time to get your order. I placed an order at 4:10pm in store and by 4:40pm it still wasn't ready. The food is good"}
{"text":"Most horrible, soupy, bland, unflavored  $10 protein shake, not once, not twice, but three times. My girlfriend had an acai bowl which was more reminiscent of a cold berry soup than anything. The Staff is quite nice however."}
{"text":"Awesome place for post work out meals! Great service and great food!"}
{"text":"I've come here several times. I'm a power lifter so I'm into healthy eating but I don't have to be as strict as a bodybuilder. I love burgers, so I decided to come here.  I have had the signature burger and the bison burger here. The burgers are good but they are hella greasy. My plate looks like it is full of soup after just 1 bite of the burgers here.  Hot girls at the counter. Good music, sports on the television, reasonably priced. I would recommend though the burgers are very very greasy."}
{"text":"3 employees in the back doing nothing. One employee in front getting his ass kicked by dinner crowd. Probably shift changeover but regardless, perception is reality..."}
{"text":"Was excited to come eat here/ love trying out new health restaurants. However, I'm sitting here waiting for my order after waiting for 25 min. No one has acknowledged us, mentioned anything about the wait. Nothing. I am a patient person and understand if it's busy, but there is only 1 other couple in there.  I will not be back and will be telling people not to come. At least acknowledge your guests when u make them wait so long for their food.  Edited: quick response from owner regarding our wait time and the food was tasty when it did finally come out."}
{"text":"I love coming here because the portion sizes and I always feel great after eating their food.   I have not ventured out on the menu much because the few things I've tried, I've loved.  I always get the- lean turkey bowl Southwest chicken wrap Protein pancakes  If your having a sweet tooth I love the chocolate protein muffins and peanut butter protein balls"}
{"text":"This place wasn't as great. The food looked good but once it comes to taste, it is VERY bland. I'm disappointed."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat a healthy meal in Las Vegas! The owner is very friendly and you can tell how much effort and thought was put into making every meal extremely balanced, healthy and tasting great."}
{"text":"Dontay was really cool very helpful welcoming personality, great service and overall excellent food."}
{"text":"Never got to try the food .Staff was rude won't get my business. Went in another time after the gym because my buddy wanted to try it . We ended up leaving because they did the same thing to him. They need to work ok customer service skills."}
{"text":"I tried out this restaurant randomly one day looking for healthy some healthy options for dinner one day. It was really good. Great staff, helpful on the first time ordering, and the menu has a very wide selection of options. I had the Bison wrap with sweet potato fries. I've had this type of wrap other \"protein places\" and it's always never anything to get excited about or just very bland. This one is by far the best one I've had I town. The sweet potato fries are legit as well.  I highly recommend to anyone looking for healthy options that also fast great. It's convenient and the food was top notch.   I look forward to trying their breakfast at some point."}
{"text":"Hands down the best healthy food in Las Vegas. I have never had a meal that wasnt delicious. the ahi bowl and all of the wraps are my favorite. if you are looking for quality look no further. kudos to the protein source. looking forward to trying some of your new menu items"}
{"text":"A friend told me about Protein Source.  I'm so glad she did, I'm hooked!  Love the food, they are quick with to go orders!  The customer service is stellar!  The ahi bowl and the bison are incredible.  This is currently one of my favorite places to pick up food. The prices are fair and the food is delicious!  The only reason for only four stars is because the ventilation is poor and when you dine in its a little smoky.  Give this place a try you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I actually really like this place, surprisingly because I don't eat a lot of protein. But, they have so many healthy options! Las Vegas definitely needs more of this. I ordered the build your own bowl and got salmon, asparagus and a salad. It was very reasonable and the quality of the food was delish.   Super casual place. Most people come here after working out."}
{"text":"Long story short: tasty, clean, healthy food. Nice portions for a balanced meal.   Some background:  I was here on business and staying at the Hampton Inn. I travel a lot for work and eating out every night gets old. I try to find healthy places to eat.   They make food the way I would make at home, simple ingredients, lighty seasoned. Portions were just right and prices were reasonable for the quality and ingredients.   Lunch: ahi tuna bowl, not just a few pieces, but the entire filet seared just right and sliced. I subed in quinoa instead of the veg mix. It comes with olive oil/soy dressing on the side. Next time I would like a cap so I can mix the dressing together before putting it on, it was separated and hard to mix. Tasted great and made me feel great afterwards! I was full but not sluggish. I would order again.  Dinner: Elk burger, it was pretty good. I had never eaten elk before, it is a little dry for my taste, idk if thats the meat or it's cooked to long? The mustard spread and bbq that comes with is nice. Sweet potato hash with shallots and kale, seasonings was also tasty. Again, clean, tasty meal. I think I would try something else before ordering this again. Bison burger next...   I also had the antioxidant juice: beets, carrots, ginger, apple, kale, spinach. Sweet, they keep the fibers in.  Since they're new and feedback is always nice, sitting under the red tent outside during lunch hurt my eyes.. it kind of makes you squint the whole time. Just sit inside if it bugs you too. Overall, I'll eat here again. They just opened a few weeks ago. So far so good. Hopefully they can keep the reasonable prices and friendly service. Owner is really nice, I overheard conversations and it sounds like he knows his stuff so he'd probably give you some great free workout/eating right advice.   Nice job protein source! Thanks for a good meal. I'll be back before I go home."}
{"text":"Awesome menu selection with very filling nutritious options. I got a double bison burger with an egg. Very good!"}
{"text":"I visited this place first time with my friends and that was awesome.They have the best employees,especially Anton ! He make the best shakes ever!"}
{"text":"What an awesome place for good clean eating. First time there with the wife and was blown away with how many options they had. All looked and sounded good so looking forward to trying everything on the menu. I had the Steak Bowl and man it was delicious and filling. If your looking to eat clean but still enjoy a tasty meal this is the place to be"}
{"text":"The Protein Source is a very good health cafe. The food I'd delicious and very healthy. For those of you looking to eat clean and or want to start eating clean then this is the place for you. They have so many things to choose from the menu anybody coming here to find something to eat whether it's breakfast, wraps, bowls, salads, burgers, acai bowl, fresh juices, protein shakes, or lastly you can even build your own meal. You can't go wrong here if you are trying to find a spot with good clean fresh ingredients in delicious food !"}
{"text":"In Las Vegas on business and Yelp said we should try it, so we did. Mark that down as a WIN for Yelp and Protein Source.   Unique concept with the quality and variety to back it up.   How do we get this in Dallas, TX?"}
{"text":"such delicious healthy options... plus it's family owned and operated and they are genuinely nice people. my only wish is that we lived closer... I would come for a smoothie and food everyday!"}
{"text":"Was not impressed at ALL!! The Fruit parfait for 7.99 hardly had any fruit nor did it have any agave, their was no sweetness nor flavor, might want to consider layering it with fruit next time and using the agave u listed in the contents! So over priced for that meal! Also their are no pictures of the food anywhere on the walls or on the store menu! The breakfast burrito was watery also and lacked flavor! It's great to be heathy but the quality is not worth their pricing!"}
{"text":"The sign advertises this place as Paleo friendly; however, when I asked which smoothies they could make Paleo friendly, the guy behind the counter said \"what's Paleo?\" From a customer service standpoint, the person at the cash register should be the most knowledgeable about your offerings, particularly if it's one of your selling points! I went ahead and placed an order for a protein shake, paid $12 (what?!), and waited. What I got was not great - I've made better shakes at home. They were very friendly; however, the lack of knowledge on the part of the staff and the pricing means I will not be back."}
{"text":"I love this place! Amazing food!!  Thank you Dontae and Cassandra for the great service!!"}
{"text":"Came in on Sunday sept 19th at 2:30. We are the only ones in the place. We ordered two acai bowls and ahi bowl. It took 45 minutes to make. They forgot to make one of the acai bowls and they made the ahi bowl wrong. It literally says the ingredients on the wall in front of them. How can they put 4 wrong ingredients in the bowl?!?  Seriously need new employees and needs new management. I feel bad for the people walking in as of this moment as there are 7 people in line and I know the average wait is gonna be over an hour for food."}
{"text":"I'm disappointed. I came in ordered an açaí bowl and the cashier and the other employee in the back making the food we're laughing and talking to each other. After I ordered the cashier said that it will take 5 minutes. They didn't make the açaí bowl once, they made it twice. The first time a guy in the back was making it and he blended the ingredients too long so it made the açaí really soupy. The second time the cashier made it, but she also made it soupy and had to put in the freezer. When the order came it was in the glass bowl, but in the beginning when I ordered I said my order is for take out. It clearly says it on the receipt. I asked her if she can put it in the to-go bowl and she said yes. When she came back, the strawberries, bananas, and granola are all mixed together and it does not look like the photo on the menu. It did not look appetizing. I PAID $9.72 FOR THIS?!? She didn't apologize or anything and during the whole time the two people I mentioned were talking and laughing to each other most of the time. The order took 20 minutes not 5 you can see it on the photo. I don't think I want to come back here again."}
{"text":"Really good food and really friendly service. I have been trying to eat better lately when I eat out, and The Protein Source seems to offer a lot of variety! I have a dairy allergy, so I appreciate the fact that they list out their allergies very clearly. I also like that they don't offer a soda machine, it makes it easier to drink water since it's right there. I only had a burger last time I was here, but I look forward to returning and trying something new!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome and the food is great. Light healthy and yummy. However the staff, well I shouldn't say staff, just the lady that was working the counter was definitely not friendly and needs some help in the customer service department!"}
{"text":"The bison bowl is amazing. I brought a co-worker here and she had the avocado salad. Her food was so good she went back the next day. Love this place. I wish they were on Door Dash or Uber Eats."}
{"text":"Perfect location, right next door EOS. When I'm done with my workout its the most convenient location for a healthy breakfast or a yummy smoothie. I think I've tried every smoothie on the menu and have not been disappointed by at of them.  Service is quick, and prices are normal. Plus this place is super cute and clean."}
{"text":"Great place - everything I've tried is awesome. Ask for Daunte he's the man! I recommend the muscle madness shake with chocolate protein"}
{"text":"I was first introduced to The Protein Source by my boss and instantly fell in love with it. I decided to take my boyfriend to try it out since it's a better/healthier alternative. We were greeted warmly by Dontay who delivered amazing customer service by helping my boyfriend and I around the menu. The food was delicious as always and the colors in restaurant gives it a fresh atmosphere feeling. I am very pick with certain ingredients in my meal, but the cooks, Rene and Ovidio never seem to disappoint! For they always remember to have my order just they way I like it!  -Thank You"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try a new healthy spot for lunch; unfortunately, that excitement did not last long. I ordered online. When I arrived to the counter, the gentleman was nice, the woman was EXTREMELY rude. She looked very confused, didn't say a word, looked at the tablet while I was standing there for a minute. She turned and walked away, again said nothing to me, the gentleman explained that the order just came up, wb one minute. I sat. Not 30 seconds later, she brought me my order. I asked if I had done my online order incorrectly, was there something wrong. Her: \"you said this is your order so I'm bringing you your food.\" No explanation for their confusion. No Sorry. Btw, the food was great, and my online order no is 21032516 from today, Feb 15, 2018. I will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"I did a Yelp review once; don't see it now. Horrible service; people were very rude. I see others seemed to have had the same experience as me - bad. Learn common courtesy. It will serve you well - to the rude woman working there."}
{"text":"Always drive by this place and wanted to check it out, happy i did!    This is an order first and sit down type of restaurant. The cashier was very helpful and told me which items were vegan and which items were not. Also on their menu it is listed, as well as the sauces. So helpful!   What we got: the vegan chili and the berry & nuts salad. Both vegan friendly. My boyfriend got the big kahuna burger with sweet potato fries.   Two words: VEGAN CHILI, soooo good!    Pros: atmosphere, clean, decor, comfortable half booth/half tables, vegan options clearly marked on the menu with a green \"V\", nice big patio area with lights above   Cons: can't think of any?   Tip*** check in first and receive $1 off raw juices/smoothies"}
{"text":"Price reasonable ,but had an issue with the customer service !  When placing a order I ordered a big boy bison burger in which I've never tried before . Now upon waiting for my order one of the employees signaled me that my order was ready, so I picked up my order another employee asked me did I order any drinks or anything else and I clearly said no just the bison burger , now I got all the way home and they had given me the wrong order . So I called since I live 25 mins away and let the employee know he said no problem sorry about that I thought your name was Carl that's why i signaled you for the order but no problem I got you on the next one. So I went in the next day after the gym and instead of owning up to his word like he said on the phone he said I have to ask \" the cook \" not manager if he could comp the meal keep in my mind I was placing another order for something else so I was still buying something regardless . Employee comes out and says the cook will make you something else if you can bring the food back in free of charge ! At that point I'm like so you want me to bring something back in which if you said that over the phone I would've gladly brought it back since I don't like seafood like that and he said yea if you can. Yea I don't see myself eating there at that one maybe a different one since it felt like the employee was trying to put it on me that he gave me the wrong order. It's not like it was super busy that night it was only 3 people in there that night but it still gets some type of stars for the for the price and menu at least smh ."}
{"text":"Well, this place certainly lives up to its name. Protein in all forms are available here:  breakfast, bowls, salads, chili, wraps, burgers, shakes, an acai bowl with protein, even the desserts have protein.  I've been to the first location a few times before so I know that this is the place to go when you are looking for healthy eats that taste good.  I'm a fan of the Steak Lovers Bowl with tenderloin steak, brown rice, avocado, veggies, feta cheese, and balsamic vinaigrette.  This bowl is a great mix of carbs and protein that doesn't make you feel guilty for eating it.  Every menu item has calorie content as well as protein gram count (if applicable), so this feature comes in handy if you're tracking your macros.  Even if you're not and you just want some healthy eats, give Protein Source a try because there should be something on their extensive menu that will appeal to you."}
{"text":"There are two restaurants with the word \"protein\" in their names in this same complex and you'd think there wouldn't be enough business to go around, but there is.  It certainly helps that they're both located next to LVAC, too:  plenty of people who want healthy eats before or after their workouts are usually circling the area.  I'm a fan of both places.  Definitely catering to those trying to eat clean and stay lean, Protein Source offers breakfast, salads, raw juices, protein shakes, bowls (chicken, ahi, elk, bison, salmon, steak, turkey), chili (vegan choice, too), burgers (the same protein choices as the bowls plus a veggie burger), wraps, as well as illy coffee.   I like the Build Your Own Meal, where you pick your protein, carb, and green, plus a house made dressing.  My go-to is the lean ground turkey with brown rice and broccoli since I usually don't make turkey for myself at home.    The staff is always friendly and the place is spotless.  This kind of cuisine may be boring for some people (okay, a lot of people), but I appreciate these type of places that offer up a healthy alternative when one needs to take a break from all that sugar, grease, and fat.  Donuts, I miss you."}
{"text":"I had the elk, sweetpotato mash and broccoli tonight...it was really, really good.  This might be the best restaurant I've been to that caters to people who take great care about eating healthy food.  I highly recommend The Protein Source....wouldn't be surprised if it grows very quickly."}
{"text":"One and done here. Not sure why I should pay $8 for a smoothie (the Paradise) that is not superior to any other at a better price. The loco moco also was not worth the $13 price tag. For some reason, the egg on top was served scrambled. Bison meat tends to be dry and this patty was no exception. Jasmine rice was bland. Ordering online through Yelp is great and I am all in for healthy food, but this place is simply overpriced."}
{"text":"Gr8 strip mall location for healthy options.   Clean and healthy food.  Delicious juice drinks, smoothies, bowels, salads and wraps.  B4 and after work out drinks.  Good service and pricing.  Casual dining where you order and pay first but the food is fresh, flavorful and filling.  Need more cafes like this."}
{"text":"Greatest place to go after a work out, before a work out, on date night; anytime! The quality of the food is out done only by one thing. The quality of service, specifically Dante and Xavier they made us feel like we've been here a million times even though it was our first time. Excellent service in all aspects; these two guys deserve to be rewarded for their outright superiority in the areas of customer service and friendliness, I suggest you come in and prove me right! Trust me you thank me for it!!"}
{"text":"These shit was dope, didn't think I would like it, but it was good, the stake was a bomb. Healthy shit it's actually really fucking good, you all should try it"}
{"text":"After coming back, I tried the steak bowl, and boy that was great! Also ordered another protein shake with acai. Much better! Didn't feel sick afterwards!"}
{"text":"Ahi tuna bowl...Recommended!  Wide open spacious restaurant.  Love the fresh and healthy concept!"}
{"text":"Great menu, continues to improve. Especially like the bison and sweet potato hash. Staff is always nice. Patio is one of the best in summerlin. Ambiance could be improved and sometimes it feels you're at a rave. But, I'll take the food and service all day long. Smoothies are great too."}
{"text":"We were looking for a healthy dinner and found The Protein Source. It was out of this world. We were hesitant to order salmon because we're from the east coast but ordered it anyway because it was wild caught (the only kind we will order). It was better than any salmon we've ever had. Our dinners were served piping hot, with every vegetable cooked to perfection. Our server was friendly and accommodating but never in our way. The owner was on site and took a lot of time out to talk with us afterward. He's clearly proud of his work and should be! We have friends and family who regularly travel to Las Vegas. You can be sure we'll be encouraging everyone we know to dine at The Protein Source. If you're looking for healthy and high end food at a price that seriously can't be beat, get out and try it! You'll be back. We will for sure."}
{"text":"Service was great. Ordered the Ahi Tuna salad and It was delicious! A little pricey, but overall definitely worth it! We Can't wait to try breakfast here!"}
{"text":"The Protein Source brings fabulous healthy food now on Durango just off the 215S.  Located in the EOS parking lot just a couple doors down.  Great menu with build your own options or preselected meals already to make as soon as you order. Salads, wraps, bowls, chili, breakfast, burgers, and health cheats as well as a kids menu. Even bison and veggie options. They also offer blended and raw juices, & protein shakes. If you can't find a meal here, your not hungry!   Im super excited they opened in my area. A definite place to dine.   Parking is shared with other retail businesses."}
{"text":"Ive been excited to try this place out since it opened if you weeks ago.   Great location just up from LVAC gym on the end cap of a strip center, walking in there are small tables and bench seating as well as an outside covered patio.  The menu has many great choices of Protein, hence, the name of the restaurant. I ordered the Lean Turkey Bowl but was certainly interested in the Bison and Elk meats, next time.  Everything was cooked very well and although the service took almost 20 mins with only 1 guy ahead of me who got his order with 5-10 mins made me wonder why it took so long, simply the cooks were standing around when me and the other guy walked in so not like there was a lunch rush. Anyway, the food was good and I will certainly go back to hopefully improved faster service and a move up to 5 stars, until then 4."}
{"text":"This place is great and a good price Protein Salmon was on point and the Protein Shake as well, wasn't sure what to order being the first time there but there is cute girl there I believe her name is Evelyn with a very fit body so I trusted her taste in food and she was correct must come back and eat there again"}
{"text":"Just happened to stop by after moving one night with my gf to grab a bite.  Dante was working and gave us the best customer service either of us had in a while.  It was so good, that if the food were bad we would have come back just because of him.  Luckily the food was amazing!  I had the Turkey Chili and she had the Vegetarian burger."}
{"text":"Got the bison bowl, good stuff! I like this location since it's right by my house and right next to the gym!"}
{"text":"Either they got a new cook or something..food is not tasting the same st this location. Example I always ordered the southwest turkey bowl (my fav). Order it twice this week on different days. Brown rice was overcooked n mushy & something is just off with the taste. Really bummed when something is really good and it's not the same"}
{"text":"Had the ahi tuna bowl. Its' got seared tuna on top of a bed of sautéed or boiled (unsure) spinach, bell peppers. IT was SOOOOOOOO GOOOOOOOOD.   A great place for low carb diets, and all the other type of diets and healthy streak people are on. Yeah yeah, it's a lifestyle change. I heard it a million times.   Price is a bit steep IMHO, but, what a great place to nourish your body. The service was amazing. I am leaving four stars for now, as I have only had 1 item from here.   I will be back for more."}
{"text":"I love having this healthy option just down the street from me!  The Steak Lovers bowl is my go-to lunch and sometimes dinner.  The decor is super clean (love the colors) and the pricing is no joke but I'm happy to pay for quality food."}
{"text":"Food is TOP-NOTCH quality and very balanced nutritionally. I rarely every stay in the place to eat my food --- It's my favorite TAKE-OUT place for sure! Portions are good and I'm always full when I'm done. The fresh salsa is awesome when dumped over a bowl of ANY PROTEIN, mixed veggies and some avocado. The best $12-$14 spent when I want healthy food!!  Elk (deer family) and Bison (slightly sweeter and richer than beef) meat?? I KNOW -- I wasn't so sure about these options at first, but after some research I learned that they both have less fat and more protein than beef - and both are grass-fed and hormone-free.  Be sure to get the PERKA app for their loyalty program!!  That's the end of my relevant review for this place - the following is something I feel I must put out there as a fellow small business owner.   YELP is truly great and I use it to find everything from Auto Services to Dentists. It's also some of the most important marketing for a small biz and the power is all within the hands of the people -- as it should be. Pretty win-win!! But when \"the people\" use their power for ego-driven purposes and put unfair and permanent marks (the star-rating) against a company, it slowly diminishes the value that is the Yelp system.  It amazes me when someone gives 2 or 3 stars and then goes on and on about how \"Delish\" the food was. It's misleading and skews the overall rating when you give a low rating because of some princess-like, emotional response to things like a sign and the music being played. Pay attention to the energy you bring -- I've been here at least 15 times and have had several different people wait on me and NONE of them have ever had attitude -- it's only 1-2 minutes of face-time with them (even if you dine-in) and you make it sound like they chose YOU specifically to be rude to, or that you're reviewing some fancy dine-in restaurant where you're also paying for the dining experience. That's NOT THIS PLACE. I assure you, most of the $'s you're paying here is going into the food and food prep.  And that's MY emotional response to that!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! The fresh food is amazing. The presentation is beautiful and the staff has great customer service! I've recently finished a whole 30 plan and now my stomach is sensitive to gluten and eggs. This is one of only places I can eat at that doesn't upset my stomach. This is a new favorite eatery for us!"}
{"text":"Good food.  Takes a little too long to get your food.  Also if you want to order ahead, you can do it less than 30 min.  Otherwise, a good place for a somewhat healthy meal ..."}
{"text":"Got the elk burger with a side salad and an antioxidant raw juice.  At least they said it was elk.  It tasted alot more like buffalo/bison to me.  But, it was a good burger and the juice was tasty and healthy.  Expensive, at $23 for the burger and drink.  The people were nice."}
{"text":"This place is definitely my \"go-to\" place for lunch or light dinners. Their portions are good enough even for me (I do like to eat :P) and everything they do is SUPER HEALTHY! My personal favorite is the \"Bottoms up brown chicken\" and their protein drinks are very delicious too. Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"SO disappointed! I thought this place was all about customization. I have been looking forward to trying this place for so long. Ordered the turkey cabbage wraps. Ordered to go. In the instructions I asked for NO cheese and NO rice. As soon as I picked it up all I saw was rice. Took the cabbage wraps off so I could just eat the meat and it was 80% rice and 20% meat. And that's a generous estimate. To top it off there were a few shreds of cheese (probably 6) which makes me think me they had the cheese on it and someone picked it off, and that alone kind of worries me. Really wanted this to be my go to place for healthy customizable eats, but I better keep looking."}
{"text":"I've been 3 times now, customer service is mediocre and untimely. the menu also states that some of the items are vegan friendly and they aren't (one of the items has an egg topping lol.) good product, fresh juices are tasty but take 20 minutes to make. wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"hell yeah im so happy!! there 2nd location is closer to me!!!! love the decor its refreshing and cool especially for the hot summers here in vegas!!   of course i got my fav bison burger so amazing cooked perfectly and devoured it as usual, got to meet the owner and his wife and there son is hilarious!! love the family atmosphere!!   thank you for enjoyable food !!!!"}
{"text":"amazing the dbl elk burger is awesome moist burger and gigantic... wish it was closer..."}
{"text":"I was starving and looking for a \"clean\" meal. Protein Source fit the bill so I went to check them out. I had the Skinny Salmon Bowl and my dining partner had the brown rice and turkey bowl (the name slips my mind). Honestly, the Salmon Bowl was bomb.com! I've been craving it ever since I ate it. It was a cauliflower mash, with asparagus, cherry tomatoes and a Salmon filet with Balsamic reduction and cilantro pesto. Honestly, I didn't taste the cilantro pesto, but I didn't miss it. The bowl was so good!! Definitely recommend it. The turkey and brown rice bowl was pretty standard but at nearly $10, it wasn't worth it. I'm happy to pay more for more expensive protein. My bowl was $12, so I think the $2 difference is worth splurging and getting the Salmon. Dude, just go get a turkey taco at Del Taco for $1. Don't eat the tortilla- BAM! Clean meal. When you're here, get something you wouldn't normally cook at home. FWIW- we cook ground turkey at home maybe 3 or 4 times a week so it wasn't a special meal for us. Check this place out for a clean meal!!"}
{"text":"It gets 3 stars for \"Fad worthy\". I got a green smoothie and while good hardly anything to write home about. I am kind of bored with this \"motif\" would prefer some true originality. In fairness I just got a smoothie but as stated there are too many chains doing the same thing, some better than others. The service was excellent I must say though just wish someone would put out something different."}
{"text":"This place is a breathe of fresh air. It was quick, reasonably priced and the whole menu was healthy. As a fitness competitor and living a clean lifestyle, I appreciate this restaurant and the variety of clean meals they had to offer. I ordered several items from the menu and everything was delicious."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great tasting food AND it's healthy! There are lots of choices on the menu and the calories are listed. Some of my favorites are the American muscle bowl, turkey wrap, and the southwest chili. If you have a sweet tooth (like me) then you have to try the low sugar brownies or the peanut butter balls. Customer service is important to me and the staff is always friendly:)"}
{"text":"If you're looking for healthy meals with great sources of protein, this is truly the best place to be! I come here pretty often and always leave happy. Everything is made fresh and I never feel guilty after a meal because I know it's good for me.   The Ahi bowl is my favorite and I usually get a sugar free protein brownie for dessert. The brownie really satisfies my sweet tooth!   Bottom line, you won't be disappointed here:)"}
{"text":"Good spot right next to LVAC for an after workout healthy meal. Staff is friendly and food out quickly. Outside seating as well with a cover so the sun doesn't bake you"}
{"text":"I was looking for healthy food options in this part of town since I'm over here a few times a week and decided to try this place. I had looked at the menu a bit before I came, but seeing the big menu with the pictures and the caloric values made my in-restaurant decision a little more difficult. I finally settled on the berry filet wrap with the spinach tortilla. I was surprised when they asked me how I wanted my steak cooked. I don't know, I guess I just didn't expect to have options! I chose medium, and it was cooked to perfection. The wrap included fresh (not canned!) pineapple, strawberries, blueberries, kale, feta cheese, some avocado, and balsamic. It really was so good and soooo filling! Service was reasonably paced (but if you're super short on time, you might ask them how long it will take...the food is all made to order). My only minor complaint is the music. It was loud kind of house/techno. I didn't hate the music...I just thought it was a little loud. I'll be back for sure..."}
{"text":"I stopped in tonight after my workout to check this place out. I normally go to Greens and Proteins but wanted something different. I ordered the berry filet wrap, and I was so excited to eat a delicious, healthy meal. I immediately noticed that the salad came with a cup of something. A quick fork dip confirmed that it was oil. I thought that was a little weird. One bite of the salad told me that it was supposed to be some sort of salad dressing but was really comprised of about 99% oil. Aaaaand...my salad was floating in it. Sigh...I begrudgingly ate the oily salad and then moved onto the wrap. When I picked it up, I noticed the bottom of the wrap was soaked in the same oil (see pic). The greens that were inside the wrap had also been drenched in the oil. Awesome...so much for a healthy meal. Come on, Protein Source, people come here expecting to get a healthy meal. All of that added (completely unnecessary and over the top) oil has just negated all the hard work I put in at the gym. If I hadn't just forked out over $12 for that dinner, I would have walked away."}
{"text":"Very good food! Our new favorite healthy stop. You guys need to bring the elk griller back though."}
{"text":"Went here one day with my friends since my friends a vegan. The ambience is casual and since it's next to the gym there's a lot of gym goers that stopped by.   I tried the chicken blta. From what I remember it was good. The service was not too bad either. Next time I'll try the breakfast or one of the raw juices."}
