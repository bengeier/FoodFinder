{"text":"This place is probably the only place I could consider myself a regular. It's very good, authentic Vietnamese. Excellent pho and we love the crispy pork rolls and pork chop. Many love them for the oxtail. What are you waiting for?!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best Pho that I've had in AZ. I am from WA state where they have many Vietnamese restaurants and I haven't been that impressed with any here in AZ, but Pho Viet Nam was awesome! Their broth is SO good. BIG bowls, not the large bowls you order and end up getting a small bowl. My wife got the Vermicelli Noodle Bowl with BBQ Pork and Egg Roll, and that was one of the best I've tasted! Quality ingredients; no skimping here. Super clean restaurant, great service, friendly, great environment/ambiance. Tommy stayed and chatted with us and made some recommendations. We will be back again, and again, and again.. We found our Vietnamese spot!! :)"}
{"text":"Fast friendly service. The BBQ spring rolls were fantastic! We both had Pho- the meat was flavorful and tender , even in my chicken pho. We will return!"}
{"text":"Great Vietnamese food at a great price. Friendly staff, big portions. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for a few months after switching from another Pho place down the street. Prices are great and food is even better. It's also pretty awesome when i walk n and they ask which dish I'm having that day because they actually remember me and what i usually order. I usually alternate between the Pho Dac Biet and the Bun Bo Hue. Both are phenominal and are dependant on mood which one i get for the day. The Com Dac Biet is another great stand bye for a heartier meal. Definitely recommend stopping in if you haven't already."}
{"text":"Such great food! We ordered the crispy eggrolls, fresh eggrolls, pho with steak, and vermicelli noodles with pork. The service was friendly too!"}
{"text":"Really friendly and helpful staff (suggested and made some vegetarian items that were off menu when asked for options).  Delicious pho.  Clean, friendly place with delicious food."}
{"text":"This is place has the best pho in the valley. Delicious, great customer service, very reasonable priced."}
{"text":"The pho was great #13 is my favorite  Tom the general manager was very nice.     Very clean place great prices. This is the closest place to Ho chi Minh that I can find  oh the cafe sua da. (Expresso and condensed milk).  Rocks."}
{"text":"Came in to grab some house pho on a lunch break.  I love pho and always get the standard with tendons, tripe, meatball, brisket, and pork/flank at every place I go.  I like to compare apples to apples when it comes to pho.  This was good, but they skimped on the tendons and tripe.  I had only one tiny piece of a tendon and only a few pieces of tripe.  Like I said, the broth was great, but I really enjoy the parts of the animal that we Americans don't eat regularly when I go out for this dish.  The Vietnamese iced coffee was good too, but only equated to half a glass so I felt a little robbed there as well.  For $15.00 on a lunch I was expecting more."}
{"text":"Great Vietnamese Food! Owner is really nice. Egg Rolls are very good as well."}
{"text":"Amazing!! Was such great service and great food. Never disappointed when I come here. Food is absolutely delicious and service is great. I would eat here everyday if I lived nearby."}
{"text":"My dad asked me to write a review for this place. He wanted to give it a 5 star rating until he found a toothpick in his pho. He said he wanted to throw up and was very disgusted. Never going back."}
{"text":"The Pho was amazing, but the staff made me feel very uncomfortable. They asked to take pictures with my 17 month old daughter and were staring at me through the kitchen. Even though the food is great I will never go there again!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and was skeptical walking in. Only one table had been seated, but the staff was so friendly I couldn't turn away. After I sat down, the server was really patient with me and went over some of their most popular items on their menu and I see why. Their eggrolls were PHENOMENAL!! I could eat those all day everyday. Unfortunaltely I can't remember which Pho item I got, but the broth was so flavorful. It came in a giant bowl I didn't think I was going to finish it all, however, I couldn't get enough of the pho that I scarfed it down. The price and wait time for the food was reasonable, will gladly come again."}
{"text":"Phomazing!  Seriously.  I have had lots of pho but never with filet mignon.  It was delicious.  This place has made the top of my list. The price point was perfect. And fountain drinks in a Vietnamese restaurant was a first but welcome change for me. I also had the fresh spring rolls which were good but the pho stood out.  Give this place a chance, I was happy I did."}
{"text":"Best Pho in the east valley. I get the number 10 with extra veggies and it is awesome. Everyone who comes to town should try this place."}
{"text":"My wife and I both are from Vietnam. I lived there only two years and I'm an American. When I  was living there ALWAYS eat Vietnamese food and never western food.  I've been disappointed with most Americans making Vietnamese food that is not very flavorful. This place really impressed both my wife and I! She had broken rice and I had Banh Cuon (rice noodles and ground pork). See my pics. We will be back. Best ive had in phx..no bs. we are major foodies and really have high expectations. this place did not disappoint me."}
{"text":"First time here so I didn't want to base my whole review on my only experience but that's all I can do for now.  First off, place is welcoming inside and clean. Always a plus.  I ordered the egg rolls (#1) which were great. No complaints there on the roll or the sweet n sour. When I come to pho joints I don't get anything else other than a large pho. I ordered outside the box today and got the shrimp and veggies pho. Everything was good taste wise.  Broth wasn't too heavy and oily.  Just right.  Once again no complaints on the pho itself.  However, I was slightly disappointed with the bowl size offerings.  I ordered a large but seemed pretty standard for me.  I will admit I am a fat boy so I do consume more than the usual.  So this may not bother you at all.  My bowl seemed to be a little low on noodles and even broth (had to ask waiter for extra broth).  He gave me some with no issues so that's always nice.  Like I said everything was fine with the pho.  I just am used to ordering large bowls and getting a heck load of pho. Yesterday (different place) I ate my entire pho and was full to the max.  Today I ate this and didn't feel much of a dent in the tummy.  Overall the food was fine. At $9 a pop for my large pho I expected a bit more food but you can't win them all.  4 stars for the food, -1 for portion control.  I'll be back to try the beef pho and update as well. -The Kung Pho Panda"}
{"text":"Just finished eating here and it was delicious! I had the chicken pho and my husband had the vegetable and tofu pho. Huge portions! We also had egg rolls and they were good. Inexpensive and very good!  We will be back again."}
{"text":"So went to have a late lunch today at this place saw great reviews. So I was all done about to pay the bill went to the bathroom before I left gentlemen using the urinal was there so I washed my hands first because I made a spicy soup so just about done the gentlemen I thought was about to wash his hands and didn't. So I thought ok he was a customer no it was a employee it totally turned me off of my food and will never go back if you are an employee you must wash your hands before returning to that means in the bathroom and in the kitchen again. Will never go back wish I could give no stars"}
{"text":"Very good customer service for a Vietnamese restaurant.  My husband had the pho, I had the #83 (rice noodles with bbq pork and egg roll).  The pork was very tasty.  The sauce that came with my noodles was a bit bland.  The pho was okay.  Portion was good, just enough to fill us.   We will be back to try other dishes"}
{"text":"I am so lucky this place opened within walking distance of my house. We started coming here several months back and are now regulars coming at least once a week. The guys who run the place are so friendly!  The best part, of course, is the food. Our orders are always taken promptly and we have never waited more than 10 minutes for food, even when it's really busy. Oftentimes we get our food in about 5 minutes   I typically get the rib eye pho #13 in the small bowl and my bf typically gets the #16. The food is consistently good every single time. It feels like comfort food to me.  I plan to continue to make this place my go to for years to come. The price of the food is quite reasonable. I feel like I get a great value for my money.  Which encourages me to come often.  My goal is to get to the point that they don't even ask what I would like, they just automatically put in the order. And we are half way there because they don't even bother bringing menus to the table anymore.  Keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"Great family style Vietnamese restaurant. Tip is to to order dishes off the menu with pictures. You will love the food there ! Nice quick service as we'll."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and what I love most about this place is the consistency. It is always consistently good and they don't constantly raise their prices like some other Vietnamese spots I used to go to. I think that by far in terms of Pho this is the best spot on the east side. The broth is full of rich flavor and always hits the spot whether I'm sick, hungover, or just really craving a hot bowl of pho. The staff here is also always super nice, they sort of just leave you alone which is what I like. I've actually never had anything bad from this spot which to me is a pretty good indication of a good ass Vietnamese joint. I'll always point someone in need of good pho in this direction."}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday afternoon and it was not busy at all. Pretty calm and quite atmosphere in the restaurant as there were only couple other groups eating at the time.   Ordered the number 23 and 2 over-easy eggs (broken rice plate with bbq pork). The food came out pretty quickly and was made perfectly--eggs were still runny (not something that every place can do). The food isn't anything fancy, and neither is the restaurant. But it does not disappoint! It tastes great, and it leaves you pretty full after you finish all of it. On top of all that, you can't beat the price. Less than $10 for rice, bbq pork, and 2 eggs.   Definitely coming back here for Vietnamese food. If my experience was any indication of what this place is like, it really is a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Pho Viet Nam is pretty solid. I haven't found \"the one\" yet when it comes to my holy grail pho joint but I have enjoyed the food here a bunch in the meantime!  One thing I really love here is the Bahn Xeo, crispy savory crepe. So yummy with lots of meat/shrimp. If you are new to the dish, youtube on how to eat it properly! You'll be glad you did.  Pho itself is decent- but I am still waiting for a place with broth that will give me a religious experience."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, fast efficient service, love their bbq pork.   Its around the corner from my house and is my go to for Viet."}
{"text":"Ordered the rare beef pho to go; didn't have to wait, it was ready for pick up upon my arrival. It was a rainy day and this soup hit the spot! Good, rich beef flavored broth. Great price too. However, I would have liked a bit more meat with my soup. Also, the restaurant seemed a bit dark and could use a freshening up/updating."}
{"text":"Bun cuon is made fresh in house. Best I've had. The pho is pretty decent too. Not really busy on weekday but pretty packed on weekend. I've tried most of the items on the menu and everything has been good and consistent so far! And they're prices are pretty fair for the portions they offer."}
{"text":"This place is by far one of my favorite Vietnamese restaurant. Beside they only have male waiter... Which its kind of weird to me. But If youre looking for an amazing viet restaurant this is the place for you. My aunt and I love their Banh xeo dish. I think they're the only restaurant that know how to make it crispy.... Other restaurant make it to soft..!! Oh and there \"bun bo hue\" is not bad. I usually don't like to order pho or bun bo hue at Vietnamese restaurant because no one can make it better than my mom or aunt .... but this place make it pretty good like them. When I have a craving for some soup this restaurant is the place I would stop by. Their rice dish is also pretty good too. My cousin order it every time  if you're in search of a Vietnamese restaurant give this place a try."}
{"text":"My pho came out warm and if you're a true Vietnamese you know we need that soup piping hot. I almost asked for them to microwave my bowl... Needless to say I was disappointed.   I don't know why there was miscommunication but when we where given our pho, we did not get any fresh veggies or sauce. I had to ask our server for it and he seemed annoyed ... Which made me confused because shouldn't a pho restaurant automatically have the sauces at the table? And why did I have to ask for my veggies? And why was he annoyed when he clearly fail to do his job?   I guess I would never find out the answers because definitely will never return"}
{"text":"I've been going to this place since 2014. I loved the food and service however today 06/30/18, I had dinner there and as I was eating I watched a roach crawl on the floor. Now it was at that moment when I contemplated getting up and paying for my food and leaving.... or turn the cheek .... when the roach crawled towards my feet. This was confirmation that my favorite Pho restaurant was no more... so with that being said, I can no longer eat at Pho Vietnam knowing this place is infected with roaches."}
{"text":"I ordered food to go and it was ready within 20 minutes. I was impressed with the speed and friendliness of the staff. I had ordered pho, fresh shrimp spring rolls, and pork broken rice. When I got home, the spring rolls smelled very rotten. I was a little concerned that the meat was old and was wondering if it was because I had ordered food to go instead of dining in.   Everything else was decent, but because there are so many other Vietnamese restaurants in the area, I probably will not return to this location."}
{"text":"Best Pho in town.  The service is great and the pho is sooo delicioso. All my friends that I bring here love it including my dad who is super picky.   My girlfriend likes that the pho is offered in a small size for those with small stomachs like her."}
{"text":"Solid. Sign of a good Pho place is that other Vietnamese eat there. Lots of variety and good size portions for a reasonable price. We've had take out and eaten in, both were excellent. My wife is gluten intolerant and had the Pho. Was delicious and didn't have any cross contamination issues. Just don't eat the plum sauce. Glad this place is close!"}
{"text":"FINALLY I found a new Pho place!  After years of searching hi and low for a new Pho place I have found it.  I used to be a regular at Saigon Pho but after several bad bad experiences in a row I began my search.  Chandler Pho, Pho Nat, Pho Van, unPhogettable, and several others just did not have the flavor I was used to.    Pho Viet Nam has very good broth in their Pho Ga and the chicken was all very good white meat.  The broth had just the right amount of flavors and spices and the noodles we cooked perfectly.  The team was nice and mellow and the spring rolls were excellent.  I had them with Shrimp and Pork.    Unlike many of the aforementioned restaurants, Pho Viet Nam was nice and clean and the table had all of the needed accoutrement.  Service was very good with food arriving very quickly.  Looking to go back soon!"}
{"text":"Delicious food for a great price! Broth is clean and clear! Egg rolls are fresh and delicious! Extremely friendly service. Definitely our new favorite Vietnamese restaurant...A must try!!!"}
{"text":"When I walked in there was nothing but non asian customers lol. I was the only Vietnamese customer in there- that was 1 red flag. You know an Asian restaurant is good if you see a lot of Asians in there and you know it's mediocre if there are other races in there instead. I got my food in a speedy manner. I ordered bun bo hue.   The soup came out- my pork blood was still cold in the center and the broth was like warm. But still they have a lot of toppings which I liked. The broth itself was decent enough- needed more spice. Problem wouldn't ever come back lol"}
{"text":"Updating my review: Still love this place! They are open on Mondays now. The menu has expanded and the prices have slightly increased since they opened, maybe an extra 50 cents. Not a big deal, prices are still very reasonable.   The pho broth here is my favorite. It has a great flavor and doesn't taste overwhelmingly salty."}
{"text":"Pretty glad this is next to a somewhat packed brunch place. Parking it harder, but that usually guarantees this steal has no wait!  Can't comment too much on the pho itself since I didn't get it. Had some of my bro's soup and it tasted pretty solid - would be very happy ordering some myself.  But the stuff I did order - I think definitely warrants a return visit. The nem nuong was very well composed with a great dipping sauce. The Mi Xao Don definitely ranks in my top ever in AZ - probably the best sauce for sure, on top of the excellent noodles and seafood stir fry.   I don't want to be too verbose on this review, but Pho Viet Nam definitely lives up to the rating and ranks up there for really solid Vietnamese food in the area."}
{"text":"Have been here at least a dozen times and food quality and service is still fabulous. I go here because their Bun bo hue is excellent and it is good to see consistent quality of food and service. Highly recommend them. They keep trying to get me to try different menu items and each one is  good."}
{"text":"The thing I miss most about LA is the ability to drive 20 minutes from my mama's house and hit a 4+ star asian joint and a decent vietnamese place definitely hits top 5 types of asian I miss.  Again, following fellow yelpers' reviews, I found this little joint.  I wasn't about to spend 10 bucks for a bowl of pho and I really wanted something that had all the basics... and then some.  Upon arrival, the plaza was very kitschy looking (as opposed to the usual nondescript plazas I venture to for asian food in the AZ) with some interesting neighboring shops.  But no matter, the others don't concern me as I'm down for pho and pho alone.  Walking in at 5PMish, there was nobody else there, and I was greeted immediately by an extremely friendly waiter.  He sat me down at a booth, brought a menu and told me to take my time.  Decent selection, decent prices, I felt like a winner.  Here's the breakdown of what I ordered:  Spring Rolls (2pc/order) - 2 Orders Beef Pho w/ Meatballs & Sliced Brisket  Spring Rolls - 5/5 These babies came out fast and at 2 pc for $3.50, that is Cali prices so it definitely rubbed me the right way.  I ordered 2 orders thinking I'd take an order home if I didn't get to it, but the spring rolls were so good and just right, I wolfed both orders down before my pho even hit the table.  I got the spring rolls with pork and shrimp.  Definitely freshly made, and everything in it had that just cooked taste as well.  The peanut sauce... god I could probably drink that whole thing down by itself.  With the generous dipping that I did though, I might as well have.  Delish, delish.  Definitely get.  Beef Pho w/ Meatballs & Sliced Brisket - 5/5 When this hit the table, I immediately brought the bowl closer to me in giddy anticipation.  It was like Christmas hit early, and I must've been a good girl, cuz Santa got me all I wanted on my list.  I took a whiff... Mmmm, the smell of beef pho broth hit me solidly.  I tore some fresh herbs off my herb platter and tossed it in, grabbed my spoon and dunked it to take my first sip.  Migod... can I live here please?  The broth was heady, rich, and enough to make me fall in love.  Noodles were cooked perfectly and the meatballs and meat didn't disappoint either.  Solid solid solid.  Needless to say, I finished my huge bowl of pho with not a drop left in the bowl.  That's what I call delicious.  For around $7, you really can't get a better deal in AZ.    Overall, I would definitely come again to try some of the other dishes like Bun Bo Hue and Fried Egg Rolls, maybe even venture out of my norm and get a broken rice plate or something.  With such solid classics, I can't imagine my dinner experience in the future to disappoint.    Rating: Service - 5/5 Price - 4/5 Food - 5/5"}
{"text":"Excellent pho, had the beef, meatballs soup. Waiter was very friendly, good sense of humor. Typical reasonable pho prices: 6-8 dollars. Tripe was slightly undercooked according to my tripe expert companion.  Would be five if the waiter had returned at all, but he never did, so our drinks were empty.  Also, I hate being nagged by the Yelp app, so I suffered y thru it just to bring this to you"}
{"text":"From Hawaii, expert in Pho, and this place is excellent!!! Awesome food and service... Definitely recommend #17. Aloha"}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving this place four and not five stars is because I've had the luxury of eating at some of the finest establishments. .  At least in this country.   Anyway I don't know the owner and I don't know anyone that works here.   The Pho is AMAZING!  I very much recommend putting this Pho if you like Pho on your bucket list.    Mmmmm yum!"}
{"text":"The staff are just fantastic. Very helpful when its your first time. His recommendations have always been spot on.  The pho broth has deep flavor and always seems so fresh   The add on veggies just top off the pho with great enhanced flavors.  The broken rice dishes are excellent.  Once you mix everything together it creates such different flavors and texture all in one bite.  Time and time again we have returned and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in Chandler to eat Pho. Friendly staff, they remember their regulars and always make the service to the table quick!"}
{"text":"I came here today with my family to try for the first time. The place surprised me. The food was really good! I got #37 which was the vermicelli with BBQ pork. The BBQpork tasted so good! They have chopsticks, napkins, hoisin sauce & siracha on every table for you to use.   There were two people working the floor, a man and woman. I would have to say the man helped us out and came to us when we needed him, but the lady was very rude. She would walk away when we were talking to her and she would make eye contact with us when we were trying to get her attention then she would look away and walk the other direction because she didn't want to come to us. I didn't like that. But besides her, I would still recommend this place to other people for the food."}
{"text":"It is very hard to find good Vietnamese food in Chandler. I have tried them all and they all pretty much suck!! However I tried this one and it was exceptional. The pho is better then any where else in the area however still nothing special. But the bun bo hue is awesome. Probobaly the best I have ever had in a restaurant. The banh cuon is very good also. The bun tung nuong is also very good. So I have given up on trying to find good pho in the valley and will stick with bun bo hue at pho viet nam"}
{"text":"Best BANH XEO in the Chandler, Gilbert, Tempe area, in my opinion, at the very least. When I order banh xeo at other Vietnamese restaurants, it either comes out soggy or gets soggy toward the end. This one, on the other hand, is light and crispy until the last bite! The portion and dipping sauce are great, too. One banh xeo is perfect to offer me a happy full tummy. It is just too good to pass and order something else whenever I visit this place. Although they also serve very decent Bun Bo Hue (spicy beef noodle soup).   So do yourself a favor and try their banh xeo. This is how a quality, authentic banh xeo suppose to be!"}
{"text":"Clean, great prices and FRESH. Staff friendly and had good ambiance. I love fresh spring rolls and #27"}
{"text":"Prices have gone up and quality of food has gone down. Pho broth is very sweet here. The last time I went, they admitted they forgot to season the bun bo hue broth, but they still served it to us anyway?? The thit nuong also tastes not as good as it used to be. I used to to make the drive here for good Viet food...but now probably only if it's convenient."}
{"text":"Super good pho. Nice little restaurant. The service was good, friendly. Quality service. It wasn't the best that I have ever had but it was still very good. Get the classic #16."}
{"text":"Better then most places in California the food is good and the service was great but ambiance is no good did I say food was great"}
{"text":"As a Viet, I love authentic viet cuisine (not really a fan of fusion). This place is one of the only places in the east valley that hits the authenticity. I grew up going to Da Vang in phx and this is similar. Get the spring rolls, viet salad (it's not really a salad, has noodles, fried egg rolls and beef), and maybe even get some pho tai to share. :)"}
{"text":"Clean and friendly staff. Had the Dac Biet soup and spring rolls. Overall, tasty, would recommend to an out of towner as a safe bet. Hits the pho craving you just have to add your own spices/sriracha."}
{"text":"First  time at the restaurant. Started  with egg rolls, a little  greasy, tried steam rolls with pork, really  liked  tried pho with oxtail  tender , the soup was good. Tried their pork chops , it was flavorful and tender , price was reasonable"}
{"text":"Delicious pho and Vietnamese rolls!! Iv always ordered Togo through doordash and never been disappointed! One day I'll actually dine in!"}
{"text":"Not super impressive or particularly flavorful. I'm all about supporting small, local businesses but I will not be back to this one. The staff was friendly, and the service was relatively fast. I was surprised that they were so busy, because their food was mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Ordered a number 15, was given a number 13, which was just about the same thing, thankfully. I'll give the guy the benefit of the doubt that he just heard me wrong (my grandpa always did say that we {women} speak one decibel higher than men can hear. sigh.). Either way, I'm pretty easy going so this little snaffoo was more like a snaffnot (yes? no? just made that up, lemme know what you think.) total non-issue.  Where was I? Ordered Beef Pho (#13) and spring rolls this past Saturday for a crazy night in with my dogs and a Downton Abbey marathon. In my next review I'll be giving pointers on how to be as cool as me...stay tuned... Synopsis: No comment on the spring rolls - pretty standard. Beef Pho - YES, YES YES! (Mind out of the gutter! we're still talking about the Pho here. Remember, I was home alone with Downton Abbey that night.) But it really was that good. My only complaint was that the broth was cool - not cold - by the time I made it home (2 miles down the street) but I just popped it in the microwave and we were hot and steamy in NO TIME (meeehhhh, I guess about 3 minutes to be more exact). The broth was insanely flavorful, and needless to say I ate with total abandon (i.e. no company to impress.) I may have even used my sleeves as napkins, I'll let you decide.  Overall, great Pho - reasonably priced - just make sure you confirm your order ;)"}
{"text":"We live this place. The first time we tried the place no complaints. Open 7 days a week and close to our home. We love to get the Pho Thai with extra meat on the side. The spring rolls are nice and fresh along with the sauce. Good price for food and we are weekly customers ^_^"}
{"text":"We concur, this is a must try if you are in the Chandler area of Phoenix, AZ we both ordered the PHO 16 and add shrimp amazing its the PHO taste you expect and want.  Also ordered the egg rolls very yummy and Thai Tea which is my favorite.  If your on a budget its less then $10 for a bowl of PHO."}
{"text":"Great customer service and great food! BBQ pork spring rolls are so good! We are a repeat customer and they never disappoint! Recommend to all my friends and family."}
{"text":"Update 1/3/2017  I have been here 13 times,  their food are good and friendly service. I keep coming back for Pho!  Come here,  you will not be disappointed.   We passed by this place several times and decided to try it after all the yelp reviews. This place did not disappoint!  I had the rice noodle with grilled pork and egg roll. Very tasty grilled pork and egg rolls. Hubby enjoyed his broken rice with pork as well. I will come back and try Pho next..."}
{"text":"Authentic fresh food, good value, price and service. Dodgy location. Spring rolls and Pho= good."}
{"text":"Typical Vietnamese restaurant you'll find in the valley.  They have a great selection of meat cuts for your pho, as well as a variety of rice plates.  I've gone here a couple of times during my lunch break and they always have fast service, so I never have to worry about taking too long on my lunch break, and sometimes I'll still even have time to run a quick errand to the bank or so before I have to head back into the office. I one time left my credit card in the black book and the employee ran after me in the parking lot to ensure I got it back.  Talk about excellent customer service!"}
{"text":"Tucked away in a small shopping mall area, this Vietnamese restaurant is a gem! I had a cold and wanted to get some pho, found this place on Yelp, and was so happy I decided to order from here! They have a great pho for a great price!  Although I didn't dine-in, the pho I ordered as take-out was delicious! I got pho with the rare beef slices. Unlike some other restaurants I have gotten pho, this place separated everything in separate containers for me, so that I could mix and match the right amount of ingredients when I got home. It also helped make everything not soggy or watered-down. The broth is very delicious by itself, but addition of the jalepeno and cilantro definitely elevates the dish.  They gave me a generous amount of noodles, beef slices, and bean sprouts. They don't skimp out on all the fixin's. I will definitely have to come back and try dining in, maybe even try some other dishes besides the pho."}
{"text":"This is one of the favorite spots of mine without a doubt. The food here is somewhat hit and miss, but there are some extra items on the menu that I can't ignore. The prices bumped up a lil bit since the last time they changed the menu, but the flavor still does not change; needless to say it's even better.   The food comes out quite quickly after we order. The spring rolls are fresh with a lot of veggies and mints (which I love), and the serving size of each plates/bowls is pretty decent. I usually order the fat noodle with shrimps and chicken and it comes with a galore of greens. Bun Bo Hue tastes OK, but please note that there are 2 different kinds of those: 1 is regular and 1 is VIP Bun Bo Hue. The broth is good as always, but don't fall for the trap of the word \"VIP\" because they throw an extra piece of pork leg in there and charge you up to $12 after tax.   Other than that, service is nice and friendly. Servers refill our water regularly and talk to us all the times, plus we always feel welcomed right at the minute we walk in. Kudos for you, servers!"}
{"text":"Each table has a napkin dispenser, straws and chop sticks, hot sauce. Those items are completely covered in filth. Mainly food spatterings that are seemingly never wiped off or sanitized. The menu was also filthy. The #15 was OK, but, 20 minutes later I had to run to the bathroom. The rest of the day was in and out of the bathroom. I have never had that reaction to Pho before. If the dining room is that filthy, one can only imagine what the kitchen looks like. Will not return"}
{"text":"This wonderful place has some of the best Pho in the valley. A friend of mine and I have visited no least than ten Vietnamese restaurants in the valley and this one really stands out. Turns out they make their broth using ox tail that is slow simmered for 24hrs. You can really taste the difference in the flavor!  They have generous portions chock full of what you want. We always start off with the grilled pork wraps. Again, generous portion, freshly made and delicious.   Very friendly staff in a modest surrounding. If you're looking for great Pho try these guys out."}
{"text":"From the outside it just looks like any other strip mall restaurant but inside is very friendly service and the best Vietnamese food in the east valley. I tried number 38 and my wife got 14 and both were great. Our son got a side of pork that is perfect for any kid trying to avoid vegetables. They also have a coffee drink with condensed milk that is fun to watch brew at your table and then delicious to drink."}
{"text":"Love their beef and pork stock. Tried their new menu item wonton pho. Very yummy and awesome flavor. A must try. Love this place"}
{"text":"Great Pho! The egg rolls were also excellent! I woke up sick with a cold one morning - all I wanted was pho and I was happy to see they were open at 10:00 am, so I didn't have to wait for this comforting lunch. Made me feel much better and the staff was incredibly sweet"}
{"text":"I love their spring rolls and #12 pho! The food is clean, delicious, and cheap! The reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I've been there 3 time now and none of the servers were friendly."}
{"text":"Our favorite Pho placed was closed so we decided to visit Pho Viet Nam and we were totally stoked to find his gem! Their food was amaze-balls!  I love Pho so I know a good broth when I taste it and they have it down. Their eggrolls were good and so were their spring rolls. When we came to dinner, the restaurant was a little dead but within 30-45 minutes into our dining experience at Pho Viet Nam, the restaurant was bustling!   The restaurant isn't anything fancy, true hole in the wall but so worth the stop especially if you're in the craving for a good bowl of Pho.  Staff was extremely friendly."}
{"text":"Inspired, authentic, amazing. Spotless restaurant and friendly attentive service are the icing on the cake at this authentic pho house. The ox tail broth is rich and layered in flavor, waiting for the always fresh jalapenos and sprouts. Don't forget to try the spring rolls as well."}
{"text":"I'll start with I'm no pho expert, but I've been to a few joints locally and I really enjoy Pho Viet Nam. I've only dined in once, it was no frills but clean and the service was good. I do get #3 spring rolls with pork and #13 beef pho, to-go about once a month. The spring rolls are fresh and come with a tasty peanut sauce. The Pho broth is always super hot and comes with plenty of toppings."}
{"text":"I work nearby and get a take-away. The pho is great and everything is nicely packaged and waiting for me when I get there. Spring rolls were OK. Egg rolls disappointed - dunno what's wrong, they just weren't tasty. I would echo one of the previous reviewers, I'd like to have cilantro in the herb mixture. I'll definitely frequent this place, it's very convenient for me and the prices are very humane. :)"}
{"text":"I am a fan.  I really liked this place. Good pho and affordable prices."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised. Excellent food spiced just right with friendly staff and clean well lit booth's and tables and nice soft music. Everything on the menu looked good. I had the #18 noodles with shrimp, squid and crab loaded with sprouts, cilantro, basil and green chili. Looking forward to trying everything eventually."}
{"text":"Love this Pho place. Close to my work, excellent pho, friendly people, and great environment."}
{"text":"Great dinner with friends, chicken with lemongrass and chili was good, not too spicy but just right!"}
{"text":"Yay, slowly but surely Vietnamese restaurants are making their way more east. Hopefully we get one in Gilbert soon!   Anyway, this morning I placed an order over the phone and went to pick it up. I ordered Pho Dac Biet (with everything), Banh Cuon (steamed rice rolls), and Cha Gio (eggrolls).   I didn't eat the Pho but I had a taste of the broth and it was pretty darn tasty. The Banh Cuon was good, also. I was pretty excited that they had this on the menu. It's one of my favorite Vietnamese dishes. I only know of one other place in the valley that offers this. It's not quite as good as the other place but its still pretty good that I would come here again for it because it's more convenient than the other place. The fish sauce vinaigrette that came with it was good also. Not overly potent. The eggroll were okay. Not awful, but wasn't amazing. I was a little disappointed that it did not come with lettuce and herbs to eat it as a wrap. This is how it's usually served at Vietnamese restaurants. I actually ended up slicing it up and mixing it in with my Banh Cuon. :)  I can see this as a place I would put in my dining rotation. Hopefully people pick up on it and it doesn't close down like previous occupants. There was only one table of diners when I went, while Hoosier Café next door had people waiting out the door!"}
{"text":"Nice clean restaurant with plenty of parking in a strip mall.  Menu has nice variety of Vietnamese cuisine.  Pho Dac Biet is good. Plenty of noodles and meat to fill you up.  Spring rolls were delicious as well.  Good came out really fast when they not busy."}
{"text":"Good Pho.  But $11.95??   Good lord.  I wish I had looked at the price before hand, but given that every other place I have eaten Pho (and that's a lot) comes in under 8 dollars, didn't think I needed to.  Lesson learned."}
{"text":"Great tasting vermicelli (#38 with BBQ pork and egg roll) and Bánh cun (#43 with pork). Very friendly, attentive, and efficient service."}
{"text":"Today I went back to order some food. It was again, so very delicious. I am addicted to their food..*SIGH*.."}
{"text":"I always love checking out new pho places, and this one did not disappoint.  Service was great and the pho was tasty. I didn't see an option on the menu to get extra broth and I didn't ask, but as we were leaving I noticed they had different sized bowls displayed on the counter, assuming it was the different sizes you could order. Wish I had known so I could order a larger size, but at least now I know for next time.  I will be back."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Pho Viet Nam 3 times. The first two times were okay -- not amazing, but in Chandler, I'll take what I can get. The 3rd time my pho was inedible. My husband and I both got the filet mignon pho (as I'd done the previous visit). The meat was stringy and fatty. The broth tasted like dish water. I told the waiter about the experience and he said \"it's the same as always\" and walked away. When I paid the bill he hovered over me until he saw that I left him a tip (regrettably), and then walked away. I will NEVER eat here again. Instead, I now drive into Phoenix if I need pho."}
{"text":"I love the fresh rolls and I will travel.out of my way to go get them. I have found that the Vietnamese fresh rolls closer to my house don't exactly taste quite right or they make them in advance so the rice paper is a little hard. They ate always friendly at this location and are always very helpful.Lol...Its gotten to the point that when I come in they already know my order, lol."}
{"text":"My family ate here over weekend. It was nice refreshing food. Everything tasted fresh. Really good."}
{"text":"The only slightly negative I have is that the restaurant was cold inside, had to move and find a warm spot. Anyway, the food was very good and the portions were more than enough. I had the chicken mien and it was very good, a bit, saucy for me, but that is how it is made. I suppose I could have requested less sauce but I forgot. Different ethnic areas make dishes differently so you have to account for that. My partner had the Pho with beef on the side and she liked it very much. All in all, a favorable review for sure."}
{"text":"Just moved to the area and have been looking for good Pho and I found it! Very flavorful and fresh. And my picky husband has never tried Vietnamese food and loved the #28. Broken rice and BBQ pork chop. Delicious and affordable! My new favor spot!!"}
{"text":"Rule with any Vietnamese place is you eat what's on the sign. If it's a pho place, you eat pho. If it's a com Tam bi place you eat com Tam bi.   I broke the rule and had com Tam bi here - it was excellent!   You can tell they can cook - pork was soft and had just the right amount of char on the fatty parts. The steamed egg was moist and delicious - I've had some gawd awful egg before.   You can tell they care - vegetables were fresh and crisp. Presentation was very nice.   The service was great. Waiter made a mistake but admitted it - this is all it takes to turn a negative into a positive. He was also very tentative.   The pho that my friends had look pretty good too.   It's a new restaurant so I hope they keep up the level of food and service.    Overall, the Vietnamese food I had in Arizona did not compare well to orange County but this place was the exception. I will definitely visit here my next visit to Arizona."}
{"text":"I found this new Vietnamese restaurant on Yelp.  My family ordered 3 dishes: - Beef Noodle Soup with Beef Meatballs -Special House Broken Rice (Shredded pork, Steamed Pork Cake, BBQ Pork, Grilled Pork Patties) -Rice Vermicelli with Grilled Pork and Egg Rolls.  All dishes tasted awesome.  I think this is one of the best Vietnamese restaurant in Chandler, AZ."}
{"text":"It was good. People were nice. My meatballs were a little icy in the broth. The spring rolls were really close to awesome but had some chewy corners.  Nice place all in all. Would like to try some of their other dishes. In Washington we are spoiled by many great Vietnamese places. This place is very good for Chandler so maybe I am a bit harsh in saying 3 stars?"}
{"text":"Very nice little restaurant.  Good food. Owner / manager is genuinely concerned about our dining experience.  Also he accommodates some special requests (example: my wife likes vegetarian spring rolls which are not on menu, yet he orders his chef to make them for us).  The Banh Xeo, a savory Vietnamese crepe, is light, crispy and delicious.  Bun Bo Hue, a spicy beef pork noodle soup, is also very good.  While the food is very good, the atmosphere and service from the wait staff is basic.  Rating: Recommended.  Opening hours Tue - Thu = 10:00 AM - 8:30 PM Fri - Sun = 10:00 AM - 9:00 PM  Mon = closed"}
{"text":"Best fried rice I've ever had. Beef noodle dish was very tasty as were their egg rolls. The chick pho and beef pho were good but not outstanding. Price is very very good. We'll be back"}
{"text":"We go here for Phó once a month. It is DELICIOUS. Food comes out quickly and it's hot and fresh. The service is a little impersonal but efficient. Their spring rolls with the peanut sauce are great too."}
{"text":"I'm from So. Cal. First Pho experience in Chandler. Soup was descent. But by no means is it worth the $12 you charged me for a large bowl. Large bowl anywhere is no more than $8.95. Several more places showed up on the list. Hope to find one not so high priced."}
{"text":"This was in my food last night. They comped at least my appetizers, but I feel my whole meal should have been comped, for having a caterpiller in my food."}
{"text":"So fresh and nice atmosphere ! Tastes like there wasn't as much MSG and beef meatballs were particularly tender; we ordered Vietnamese egg crepe (app) for the first time. It's a meal all on its own."}
{"text":"Thank you Pho Viet Nam for the delicious meals.  We ordered #6, #17, #20 & #28..and all I say is..WOW!!!  The flavors were so delish..it felt like we were back home in San Francisco..at our fave Pho spot in Westborough Rd, Daly City. The employee and service were warm and welcoming. Looking forward to next time we go.."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful! Great food! The best Pho in the area imo. You can judge good Pho by the quality of it's broth, and theirs was great! Definitely come here!"}
{"text":"Had the rice plates with grilled pork. Very tasty. The meat has obviously been marinated and wasn't dry at all. One of the best I've tasted. The shredded pork is something I usually don't care for but it was fantastic when I mixed it in the rice.   We also had banh cuon. Good portion... Great for sharing. I honestly expected skimpy pieces but this wasn't so. I've never seen this served anywhere else so that was nice.   We ended with a couple of iced coffees. It was perfect. Not too much condensed milk but not too bitter. I got the Che Bon Mau to go, which is the four color dessert/beverage that consist of coconut cream, beans, pudding and jelly over crushed ice. It was pretty good. I got it to go so it melted right away which made it bleh.   The server/owner? was very nice and considerate. This is a pretty typical Asian restaurant, meaning they will not check up on you every minute (good thing to me). He asked us about the meal at the end and seemed to take note of what the customers experienced.  The restaurant is pretty clean, with nice seating.  Anyhoo this is one of the tastier Viet restaurants I've been too. It's a great place to try out Vietnamese food if you're not that familiar bc the menu has colorful photos and it has the standard fare of Vietnamese food that you would see at any other Viet restaurant."}
{"text":"This place was Unphogettable. We ordered our food and with in minutes it was at our table ready to devour. The Pho was very flavorful and the portion was big."}
{"text":"Cold curing pho.   Thank you Yelp for helping us find this place."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Toni Braxton - Breathe Again)  If I never taste your Shrimp Spring Rolls again If I never taste your tender beef again If I never smell your broth and sauce now and then Will I never Yelp and review you once again  Please understand if Bo Bites rants Then I promise you, I promise you That, that I come by Pho Viet Nam again  Pho Viet Nam Pho Viet Nam That I shall come by Pho Viet Nam again Pho Viet Nam   Pho Viet Nam is a pretty solid Pho joint in the heart of the Chandler suburbs.  Pho Viet Nam is definitely your old school mom/pop owned Pho restaurant.  The place itself was quite typical of such a place.  Bad portrait paintings, poor replicas of traditional artwork and a couple of tv screens on the wall; you know the cheap Chinatown stuff you put up to signify you're an Asian establishment.  In my books, the place was not really utilized to maximize it's potential plus it didn't look well kept.  Needless to say, you can't beat the classic Vietnamese cuisine here.  I started with Shrimp spring rolls.  Generally I would go with something fried like eggrolls, but for some reason I shot for this and I was not disappointed.  Dipped with the sweet Hoisin sauce and spicy chili  gave this a classic appetizer a kick and aromatic refreshing bite.  Next up was of course my comfort food, Pho!  The broth really brings this dish home for me and here at Pho Viet Nam it definitely did so.  As I peered into the kitchen I see a family at work busting out dish after dish as if it was in their own home.    In the end, Pho Viet Nam is a new must go Pho place for me.  I think overall I totally appreciate my Pho made by mom and pops in the back room and find it comforting to say. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place has great pho broth and fish broth. Fast service, always a place to sit and friendly staff. Prices are very fair and location is great for those easy valley foodies. Been going here for 3 years now and the flavors are always consistent. I've tried 50% of their menu and so far so good."}
{"text":"Came here because its pho weather Lol. So, overall the pho was delicious. The broth had lots of flavor and they had generous amounts of meat. A few things why I didn't give 5 stars. The drinks, any kind from soda to Thai tea, tasted horrible. Soda drinks tasted old... Thai teas tasted like powder. I also thought the service could be worked on a bit. The guy clearly was paying attention more to the \"regulars\" than us. Also, the interior is standard but not bad. Overall if it wasn't for the good pho, it would have gotten a lesser rating. Will definitely be coming back for pho but may bring my own drinks Lol."}
{"text":"The food here was great! We always enjoy eating phó & hanging with friends! The service was not that great there however, the server was nice & recommended somethings for us there but it just took him a while to actually come to us, to take our order. Would definitely go again though!"}
{"text":"Love these places. I have no idea what anything is (however, they do a decent job explaining on the menu), and the servers all try real hard and come off as very blunt - but we know that's just their culture.   VERY good prices, (2 QUAILS for $10?!?!?)... I bet you any American restaurant serving quail charges $20. Fancy restaurant charge $40.   The environment is very nice, they spent some money!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I've been coming here for the last 3 years, was recommended by one of my Gfs and my dad.  I've had their Bahn Xiao, I think that's how you spell it, super yummy.  Cold rice noodle with the egg roll and pork chop, and their combinations pho. I love that the pho has three size options as well. Service is good, when the two gentlemen talk to you, they're pretty funny, but if they don't, they just kind of leave you alone, which is nice too. Price is very reasonable and food comes out fast, sometimes too fast. Lol"}
{"text":"Very good Ph? and spring rolls. Great service! Tommy is a great host. Will be back to try the BBQ Pork. It looked delightful."}
{"text":"Seriously, why would you go anywhere else for Bánh Xèo? This is the consistently the best place for it, hands down. It's big, filling, reasonably priced, and comes in veggie version"}
{"text":"Had a craving for some Pho and this  place delivers. I love the flavor of the broth and they give you enough noodles and other ingredients so I was definitely a satisfied customer:)"}
{"text":"Great service and very clean looking,  the staff is very courteous and helpful,  it has a feeling of family.  Very low prices and really big portions. So far I've had four different dishes and no disappointments. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Always a go to place when I'm working and I'm craving Vietnamese food.  One of the better restaurants in my opinion if you're in the east valley."}
{"text":"Finally settled on our favorite Pho place in the area and this is it! Everyone is so friendly and I feel like they are always open! Fresh ingredients and great broth. Never fail to leave full and happy."}
{"text":"I go there for the Mi Quang, but it sells out fast.  So, call ahead of time if you want it.  It is so amazing and authentic.  We like the spring rolls here, too."}
{"text":"I had been looking for a great Vietnamese restaurant for a while. This is by far my most favorite Asian restaurant. Everything on the menu is absolutely great. To many great dishes to list on here. If you are a regular the manager/owner will ask you if you want to try dishes not on the menu. Love it! Even my 5 year old loves eating here. Great friendly service with a smile, and food that keeps you coming back for more. Outstanding!"}
{"text":"Tried their pho tai bo vien and I'm quite disappointed. The rare steak was ok but their meat ball tasted sooooooo weird. They cut it up into slices and I'm pretty sure it's not a true beef meat ball that you usually get at pho restaurants.   The banh cuon was relatively small compare to other places with less variety.   Overall, you're not missing out if you decided to skip out on this place. Price is a little higher than other places I've been that have better pho dishes."}
{"text":"Ordered two types of Pho and some spring rolls. The first soup, #16 a pho special with tendon, tripe and the rest of the goodies came out in less than a minute. Great broth which is the yard stick to any pho but could have been hotter temperature wise. My wife got the spicy soup #34 which came out next. The broth was even better and tasted like it was made with shrimp possibly. Hers was temp hot and perfect. We had to ask for the fresh spring rolls again which came out last. They were shrimp and pork and they were ok, nothing amazing. I would definitely go back for the pho though."}
{"text":"Ordered the vegetarian crepe and it was nice and crispy. Lots of romaine and mint to make sure you can make a wrap! Sauce was average but the hot garlic chili fixed that quick.  The place was bright spacious and clean with efficient service !  Really couldn't try anything else but for sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"i love the banh cuon dac diet i grew up eating this and its so time consuming to make so this is as good as it gets!!! plus the bun bo hue, banh xeo were all very good too!"}
{"text":"Do I love this place? ummm..sure..kinda... Do I like it. definitely.  As you can see I'm a little indecisive at the moment about if I love this place.   What I love is their filet mignon pho for sure!  Please no tendons or any of that chewy stuff I cannot handle texture for the life of me!! Reminds me of octopus.  Cannot Handle That!  *cringing as I type*  I tried the noodle Banh Cuon and was extremely mad at myself for not being safe and ordering the amazing pho in which I don't even know if they carry the filet mignon anymore.  I will be bummed if they stopped carrying it.  The Banh Cuon taste wise was fine just nothing much going on really.  The reason I am giving them 4 stars is because I felt like the service was a bit lacking even when it was dead slow at night for us when we were the only ones in there at the next 30 minutes and the Banh Cuon felt like I was gonna chip a tooth and be cautious because of the stuff they put in the middle or inside who knows?!    The fact I had to be that cautious with my food over nerves is annoying.  I always want to try new stuff is that so much to ask for and not be nervous to eat! What the heck!  As long as they still have the filet I will be a continuous loyal customer."}
{"text":"Such great pho and service here. Me and my husband have been here a total of probably 8 or 9 times. We've taken our kids, my mother, my brother, and my best friend and each of them agree it's super good, too."}
{"text":"Excellent best tasting pho place in east valley.  Great service, clean restaurant, good portions, good prices.  I can see their volume ramping up quickly so hopefully they staff up to keep up."}
{"text":"This place has really great customer service and reasonably priced pho. It is authentic Vietnamese food!! I always order the deep fried egg rolls (2 for $3) and a bowl of pho tai bo vien (brisket and meatballs). Their broth is yummy and their veggies are always fresh.   Don't expect them to bring the check to you. When you are ready to pay just go to the counter. I also usually get a iced coffee with condensed milk to go. Really caffeinated !"}
{"text":"Hands down, my favorite Viet restaurant in town!  You MUST try their Pho! It's a just-right-mix between sweet and savory, mmm slurppp yum! I come here almost every weekend, even in the hot weather of Arizona, to have their pho, it's that good! Well, I also love their other dishes, their broken rice dishes are top notch and their bun bo hue is done right to the spice (you can also order the \"Americanized\" version without the \"mystery\" meat in it ;) )  All and all, great food and great service. Will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Best Pho in the East Valley! The staff is always friendly and remembers me and what I order when I walk in the door. The traditional Pho Tai is always delicious. The shrimp fried rice is better than any Chinese food restaurant, as well as the egg rolls. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great food, awesome service, and good people. Definitely recommend getting the number 13 and 10! Also, get their egg rolls! To die for."}
{"text":"Great Pho.  The Buon Cha Gio Thit Nuong was okay, not as good as we've had at other restaurants.  The Cha Gio by itself though was fair, needed more pepper though.  I think it was the Nuoc Mam that just didn't have enough flavor to it.  The Goi Cuon was also excellent, I would recommend the rolls with the shrimp and pork."}
{"text":"The customer service here is great. The staff is very friendly and welcoming. Always quick service with them and the food is phenomenal. Best Pho I have ever had well besides my friends home made Pho."}
{"text":"Never had pho before..very skeptical at first but absolutely loved it!! They're pho is so fresh, you can taste every ingredient! I got the pho with chicken so yummy. I can not wait to try everything else on their menu. Looked amazing and very authentic"}
{"text":"Delicious pho and spring rolls - I'm sure the rest of the food is equally good, but as those are my favorite, I get them every time. Speed on getting food is like nothing I've experienced, from ordering to food at table took less than 5 minutes. Always fast, always friendly, always good."}
{"text":"Love, Love,  Love!  My family loves Vietnamese food. We have tried many Vietnamese restaurants in Az. This place is the best. Friendly staff good food, great price. My boss is from Vietnam and I just found out this is his favorite place too. He doesn't even live near here but he travels to get to this place."}
{"text":"It was my first visit so I tried more items than I would usually when dining alone. I ordered the spring roll (goi cuon), bun thit nuong (BBQ pork rice noodle bowl), and cha gio (Vietnamese egg rolls). All really good. The pork was nicely grilled, not too fatty or too rubbery. The fish sauce was really good with the crispy rolls and noodle bowl. The peanut sauce served with the salad rolls was nothing special but fine. As with many tiny places, they serve single cans of soda which is ok but I generally don't like paying almost $2 for a can of soda. Service was good and quick, will definitely be back to try the pho tai."}
{"text":"To start off, I would like to share that I grew up in Vietnam and lived in SoCal before moving to the desert, so I'd like to think it's hard to please my viet food expectation.  pho VN is a solid 4.5 star in my book!  Parking: the small lot right in front of the restaurant gets crowded from time to time. You just have to walk a bit in the blazing sun. Ambience: no thrills, no cheesy decor, just simple table with clean floor and good ol' homey food. Food: I'm craving it so much now that I moved to Tucson and can't go here every weekend :(  -Pho: 3/5 it was average, solid portion with decent amount of meat, broth is not as flavorful as it could be, overall a-OK -Banh Cuon 4/5 this is a traditional South VN dish, I didn't think I could find it in AZ so I was super happy. It was tasty with all the right ingredients, super nomz -BUN BO HUE 5/5 THIS IS IT! Order this you can thank me later! Oh my gawd, it is the closest thing to my moms BBH that I could find. Yes it's a bit pricier, but so worth it. The broth is FULL of flavor, it has tons of meat. After a night of drinking, Bun bo hits all the right spots. Dang, I'm drooling as I'm writing this...  Support this cute family owned restaurant with solid and authentic Viet food! They even play old school cheesy French/ Viet music softly in the background to enhance your appetite ;)"}
{"text":"Pho was sooooo good, and cheaper than average compared to all the other vietnamese restaurants around.  The food was great, the staff was very friendly.  My girlfriend and I got 2 bowls of Pho Tai, an order of spring rolls, and drinks for 26 bucks, very reasonable.  Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Good pho place better than most of the places in east valley , could be better if the broth is a bit hotter !!!"}
{"text":"After a shopping expedition at Walmart,  I had an intense craving for pho.  Should have just gone home,  but I had to satisfy my urges.  I'm glad I did because pho vietnam was a great find. I yelp searched for the closest pho.  It was between saigon pho and pho viet nam. I have been to Saigon Pho so I thought I'd try something new.   It was a 6pm on a Tuesday evening and I was the only one in the entire place for my entire meal.  Hopefully they picked up after I left.  My beef pho #16 was delicious!   Broth had good flavor,  plenty of meat and noodles,  and the price was right.  My favorite pho place in the valley is unphogettable in Mekong Plaza, but their prices for everything is $2 higher than here at pho viet nam. So being cheaper is always a plus!!  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I ate here twice with the same friend.  She really liked the noodle and meat soups.  i had the same vegetarian veggies with noodles twice.  it was good.  I would return again.  I wasn't thrilled with all the assorted cutlery in a container on the table, where others could touch everything."}
{"text":"Come for the bun bo hue; the pho is decent as well.  I love that this place still serves cafe sua da the old fashioned way, with the little expresso gadget over the tall glass.   Can't say the veggie is always the freshest, unfortunately.     A solid 3.7 overall."}
{"text":"Has the thai iced tea which was a perfect combo of sweet, milky tea.  Had the crepe which was thin, crispy and normal with the veggie sides.  Only thing I was missing were the cucumber slices.  But the basil was fresh and clean.  Also tried the chicken lemongrass with chili which was delicious and came with a generous portion of white rice and a little side salad.  Really liked the dry garlic on top of the chicken which also had sliced, grilled onion.  Then we had the thin sliced beef pho and the broth was so delicately flavored, truly wonderful.  Really glad we came for it because now it's our very close second choice.  Last item we had was a vermicelli rice salad bowl with thin slices of bbq pork and this was flavored very well too.  Can't wait to come back and try more items.  3 dishes 1 appetizer and a drink and it came out to about $40 including a generous tip.  Wait staff didn't come out to fill our water but the food did come out quickly.  The restaurant is located in a little  mini vegas strip center, it's lighted up!  It was spacious and restrooms were clean.  Located on Warner east of Alma School."}
{"text":"Just like CA. Enough said. But yelp says my review is too short.  Clean place and wide variety to meet your cravings.  Large portions."}
{"text":"Best Pho in the valley, cheap prices, and great service. What more could you ask for! BBQ Beef rolls are delicious as well! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Took the folks out to sample this restaurant and we were happy. We order the Banh Cuon, Pho Bo Vien and Bun Bo Hue which was fresh and tasty. The fish sauce for the Banh Cuon had too much sugar yet the service was quick. The place isn't anything fancy but easy to find with the bright neon lights illuminated throughout the shopping strip. Don't expect too much enthusiasm on service nor fancy decor. $6.95-$7.50 price range."}
{"text":"Love their pho and everyone there is very nice. I live right across the street which is dangerous because it is so good! Would highly recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"The owners are amazing!! I'm pregnant and was having a pho craving and came in just at closing and they stayed open late to make sure we got what we wanted! Super nice and the food was delicious!"}
{"text":"Place is very clean and friendly service. I love the chicken Pho and the spring rolls are to die for. I highly recommend giving this place a try. Everything was fresh and made to order."}
{"text":"Ordered pho #14 broth was less than tasteful and the cut of meat was disappointing. I know this sounds weird but it had a 'cow' taste  also tried the #25, meat was ALL fat and the 'shredded' pork was literally cut up cold pork in slices.  The spring roll was ok. The fried rice was prob the best thing we ordered but still under satisfactory. The customer service was even more horrible. The restaurant was cluttered like someone lives here. Not worth the money, won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Decent pho, fo' sho'.  This is a no frills, Vietnamese restaurant that has all your requisite noodle soups and rice plates. We were deliberating between Hoosier Cafe or this place and decided to go on a more adventurous route since we had never eaten here before and it had good reviews on Yelp.  We browsed through the menu once we were seated and decided on sharing the shredded pork spring rolls. I ordered the #11, beef noodle soup with tofu and vegetables ($6.95) as my main meal and had a bite of the broken rice plate with BBQ pork (#23 I believe, $6.95). After telling our server that we wanted the pork spring rolls he gave us a sour look and asked, \"Have you had them before?\" as if this was an exotic Bizarre Foods delicacy with three heads and eight eyes we were unknowingly getting ourselves into. I replied \"No we haven't\" to which the server remained tight-lipped and didn't feel the need to provide any extra explanation. I'm not sure why there was such consternation? When we got the spring rolls they tasted fine, nothing out of the ordinary! The shredded pork was balanced with fresh crisp greens. There might have been some offal in the rolls but it didn't taste bad or anything. The fish sauce it was served with was a bit too bland for my tastes so I mixed it with some Sriracha and hoisin sauce.   The pho was a sizable portion of noodles broth, tofu, and vegetables. I liked the broth. It had a bit of an unctuous feel to it, but it didn't detract from the savory taste of the light yet flavorful beef broth. The bit of BBQ pork I tried was good and had a bit of a smoky flavor from grilling.  Service is about what you'd expect from a no frills type place. Our order was taken, water and food served, with no additional follow ups. We paid at the counter.  Overall it's not the fanciest place nor did it provide a resonating tone of friendly service to me but it gets the job done for providing hearty flavorful meals that are reasonably priced.   Overall 3.5/5."}
{"text":"Best Pho I've ever had in the Phoenix area and very affordable. My wife and I each got different soups and they were both phenomenal. Very friendly staff as well."}
{"text":"Pho is delicious! Must try the spring rolls with pork and shrimp. So good. Nice quiet atmosphere."}
{"text":"Exactly what I was looking for.  Pretty decent pho.  I didn't have a chance to try the spring rolls but looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"Discovering this awesome place. It doesn't have fancy decoration and looks just like I am visiting Vietnam. Friendly staff and clean. Obviously they do use filter for the drinking water. The water taste good. The price is slightly higher than other Vietnam restaurants in the valley, but the portion of the foods is big enough fit into a to-go box."}
{"text":"Four stars, but an easy five with another good experience.  This place is excellent. Really friendly service, damned good pho, some wonderful spring rolls, and salty plum soda. Honestly, this is a recipe for me to love a pho place. I just happened to notice this little gem on my drive home yesterday, so I decided to stop by today for some pho. My girlfriend and I both ordered the dac biet pho, and split an order of spring rolls with pork patties. I ordered the salty plum soda, and it was excellent. The entire meal was great, and as long as the quality maintains I'll give this place an extra star in no time! The fact that it's the closest pho place to my house doesn't hurt, and the fact that they have everything I want definitely helps. :)"}
{"text":"Simply put, Pho Viet Nam gives their customers what they want.  Great Pho!  As a frequent Pho consumer, I have come to expect that every Pho restaurant has their occasional off days.  I was reminded of this recently when I visited a restaurant whose broth pretty much tasted of noodles dunked in hot water.  When it comes to the avid Pho consumer, great customer service and affordable price aren't enough to overcome lackluster, flavorless Pho.  Pho Viet Nam, on the other hand, makes sure to get one thing right - flavorful broth!  That's not to say that their customer service isn't great.  It actually is.  It is to say that when it comes to what's the most important factor when it comes to Pho-craving consumers, Pho Viet Nam is the place to be (at least when it comes to the East Valley)!"}
{"text":"Always on a search the the best Pho. I picked up on the Yelp reviews and here we are trying Pho Viet Nam for the first time.  We went for lunch at 12, the place was not so busy, was greeted and seated right away. Service was excellent. Atmosphere was typical. Food was very good. We loved the #3 Goi Cuon Nem Nuong (spring rolls w/shrimp and slices of steam pork). We also ordered the #12 Pho Tain Nam and Bo Vien (fillet mignon slices, brisket, and meat balls). The pho was one of the best I've had in AZ. Broth was clean and vegetables and meats were all fresh. The meat balls were ok, but I think it's just a personal taste with all those pho meatballs.   We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Have declared Pho Viet Nam as my \"pho-vorite\" Pho place. Get it, \"pho-vorite\" / \"favorite\" Anyways, everyone is always so friendly and greets you with a warm smile as you walk in the door. It's locally owned by three brothers. One serves, one is cooking and the other is at cashier. Always flavorful soup broth and fresh ingredients. They have something for everyone. Worth visiting!"}
{"text":"Chicken pho. Very tasty and cheap ($6).   Super friendly service.   Very clean restaurant.   Authentic Vietnamese.    Hope this place makes it!"}
{"text":"I can't for the life of me understand why this place is reviewed so highly. Remarkably unremarkable food. I've eaten a ton of awesome Vietnamese food in the valley and elsewhere, and this was bottom of the list. It wasn't bad tasting, it just wasn't good tasting - it tasted like if I tried to make Vietnamese food. Both my vermicelli and my girlfriends pho were equally disappointing. Many other better Vietnamese options in the area. They are rated less then this place, too - makes no sense to me."}
{"text":"This place was delicious! Not from this side of town but my mother and I were in the area and decided to try it out! So glad we did!!"}
{"text":"Great authentic Vietnamese food. They really know how to make everything from the meats/salads to the soups. I always end up getting banh coun or banh xeo because there are not many other restaurants in AZ that even offer these dishes. Water cup is always full and they have the shrimp paste that you find in Vietnam. They have amazing eggrolls and spring rolls if you want something small. Prices are good and the place is always busy. Must try!"}
{"text":"so cheap in providing veggie dish... i ordered 2 Banh Xeo and they give me only 1 veggie dish... how i am going to eat that?!?! this place is not a good place to eat. moreover, the Banh Xeo is way too soft instead of being crunchy!!! i ordered 5lbs of Banh Cuon togo, and they give me a little bit of veggie, im going to be constipated. Bad customer service ever!!! Not sure if this is the way they serve customer but seriously, veggie is MUST in each Vietnamese dish... they are way to cheap to provide veggie. i dont recommend this place to my friends and family. It's a bad restaurany ever i've tried."}
{"text":"I had this for the first time. ..drove by it all the time but never stopped to try it.  Finally we tried it. .I have to say it was pretty good. I had the pho special and the Bahn con I ate it all.. the only thing was that they needed some more help. 1 guy running around like crazy with a full house.  I will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Their egg rolls are so good! Also their spring rolls are yummy too. I did forget to tell them no basil but even then the basil wasn't over powering at all. Definitely will be back to try other items!"}
{"text":"Really glad I tried this place. Waitress was sweet. Food was fast. My dish (#38) was fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"First walking in with an ignorance look from the waiter. They weren't friendly & look tired after a long day working. The bun Bo hue wasn't good. The crepe was ok. Bun Thit nuong was ok but I am not happy with the fish sauce tastes like sugar water."}
{"text":"Ate there today for the first time.  We had spring rolls.  Beef Pho, and a BBQ Pork plate.  Everything was delicious and fresh.  Our waiter was friendly and offered suggestions based on what we liked to eat.   The restaurant was clean and well lit.  The menu had some great looking items on it.  I wanted to try more.   The Pho was HUGE, hot and tasty!   My suggestion to the owner.  Get rid of the yellow \"country kitchen\", flowers decor.  Make it look like a Vietnamese restaurant.  Lose the Xmas decorations.  5 Gallons of paint, some inexpensive art work, some friends and a case of beer will get the place remodeled and looking proper.  I've seen way too many episodes of Kitchen Nightmares, and Restaurant Impossible to know that mismatched decor can kill a place.   Other than that, we'll be coming back!  Welcome to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Got #38 (Bun Thit nuong Cha gio) and some fresh spring rolls. Great service, the waiter is very quick. The food came out in less than 10 minutes. Excellent for lunch and dinner!"}
{"text":"We went to Lee Lees Asian Market and decided we wanted Pho. Yelped local Pho Restaurants and found Pho Viet Nam. Found in a small strip mall, easy parking and were seated right away. We started with egg rolls, spring rolls and pork spring rolls, (all highly recommended, especially the pork spring rolls.)  For dinner we ordered the pork and broken rice plate as well as the beef and broken rice plate. Because we wanted Pho we  also got the beef sliced Pho as well. Yes, we were hungry. Yes, the soup, though it's 115 degrees out was WELL worth it. Flavorful and delicious, one of the best broths we have had.    Don't forget the Vietnamese coffee, slow drip over sweet condensed milk.   If you're in the area are traveling from afar for some great food at great prices, stop here for sure! Come early, it gets busy."}
{"text":"Highly recommend the pho. The beef is very lean unlike many other places. The noodles are cooked perfectly and the broth is very flavorful. Great meal for winter or if you're nursing a cold!!"}
{"text":"Ordered egg rolls with our dinner and received spring rolls instead. No biggy we roll with the punches but after i took a bite out of the spring roll put it down on the plate and a small bug crawled out of it. It grossed me out and i advised waiter and he took spring rolls back and came back 5 minutes later looking for the bug. Which we did provide him since it was smashed on a plate at our table. We continued with our meal against my better judgment."}
{"text":"This place has gone way down on service and portions . We went in today and had spring rolls they look like 2 skinny rolls 1/2 the size they use to be very small and I know spring rolls. Brought our egg rolls and it look like one cut in half I was like ok , maybe there having a tough time trying to make ends meet and cutting portions in half.. then came the Pho the standard size where a little skimpy but as you can say passable, but we order the 10.95 bowl and it had the same or less portion of meat as the 7.95 bowl just more noodles and broth.. the tendons where a nasty yellow color just not appetizing at all like before.. Eaten here before and the portions where pretty good and so was the Pho things did change.. they weren't busy it was only us in there so there was no rush going on so no excuse on being busy. Told the waiter he went and told the cook . Cook came out he only speaks Spanish so I had to translate what we where saying between us and the waiter... he mentioned he was told only to put this much in the soups  and he also mention they had cut down the portions they put in and told to make all the rolls  smaller.  I was like come on the Pho not even being made by Vietnamese cook how authentic is that !  done with the cook came another waiter came by and he wanted to argue about it I told him simple fix make it right or I don't want. Then he mentioned he had never seen us before in there . I was like ok which we had been there a few times but what did that have to do with it.. Well all in all the skimpy portions the argumentive rude service and the UN authentic Pho being made was enough for me to say no more Pho from this place. We left the food there and we wont be back.   The good thing out of all this is we then went on to Pho Chandler on Arizona & Octillio cause I still wanted my Pho fix. It was as they say \" night and day\" . GREAT SERVICE, tasty spring rolls and eggrolls with some very refreshing ice tea. The service was Excellent from the waitress and they didn't miss a beat with a smile on there face . Not first time there but definitely on point... 5 star rating at Pho Chandler got my Pho fix.."}
{"text":"Best Pho in PHX.  Picked this place based on reviews and they did not disappoint.  First ordered take out, and the guy was super attentive to making sure we knew how to heat the pho for the best experience.  The pho was awesome, and we've eaten here numerous times since and have never been disappointed!  Super nice staff, huge portions, and delicious food."}
{"text":"Pretty good... will satisfy a craving in a pinch, but definitely not the best vietnamese food I've had. Last time we came i got the vermicelli bowl with pork and egg roll and everything was barely even lukewarm. It came out less than 5 minutes so I'm wondering if it was simply pulled from a fridge.  Overall this place is okay though!"}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  Crazy, but in considering this place, I think it's one of the best Vietnamese joints I've ever been to, and that includes places in Westminster and Garden Grove.  Part of what bumps up this place is their goi cuon tom & thit, spring rolls with shrimp and pork.  They are large and excellent here.  Great balance between noodles, vegetables, and meat.  I've only ever gotten their pho dac biet (pho with almost everything), and it really is one of the best.  I'm always impressed with how clean the broth is.  That, along with with the flavor of the broth, which has deep, meaty, textured flavor.  They don't skimp on the meat, which is a plus.  I never really judge the noodles unless they are very good or very bad - here they are average and prepared just fine.    The price is right, the service is pretty good for an Asian joint, and the food is much better than average.  Look, I know everyone loves to give pho places 4 stars because it's just pho, it's cheap, and the places are often holes-in-the-wall.  But some pho places have to be superior to the rest of them out there, and I'm taking a stand and saying that this is one of them."}
{"text":"My sister got the Pho, which was pretty good and flavorful. My mom had the Banh Xeo and Com Tam and she enjoyed it both. I had the Banh Cuon and it was great. The servings are big for the price, so it's worth it! The food was authentic and not spotty like other Vietnamese restaurants in Arizona. Service gets slow when they're under pressure though.."}
{"text":"Restaurant with bad tasting water to me is always a bad sign. It tastes so bad almost made me gag. It had very strong bleach smell. My hubby ordered a lemonade and even that had very weird taste. BBQ pork dish I ordered was cold and it came with steamed pork cake & shredded pork which  were cold as well. My hubby ordered pho tai and the soup had weird after taste. I'm pretty sure they use the same bad water with their cooking. Not to mention their slow service and flies in the restaurant. We were very disappointed and will never return again."}
{"text":"First time trying this place today, as I just recently have tried Vietnamese cuisine.   This place was FANTASTIC!   I ordered the Bun Thit Nuong Cha Gio (vermicelli w/ BBQ pork & egg roll) and Jim had the Pho Dac Biet (Pho with beef, meatballs, brisket, tendons & tripe) and we started with the shrimp spring rolls.  All the dishes had such great flavor!  We can't wait to go back!   I didn't think AZ could have a place that rivaled, and dare I say a tad better than my first and only Vietnamese restaurant that I frequent in So Cal.    Staff was very nice, service was great."}
{"text":"Now this is a pho place in the east valley I would recommend to everyone to try! The pho bowl ranges from small, med and large and trust me they don't skimp on the noodles/meat. We had the pho tai, pho dac biet and fried spring rolls which both were delicious. It's a very inexpensive place for lunch or dinner and the pho let say again is excellent. I agree with the previous post they nailed it on the broth!"}
{"text":"Always great food, always fast service. They also let me know there are more locations! I have been coming to this one for years and drive further to get there. In chatting with staff, discovered theres one closer to my home. When staff actually engage with their customers, good things happen!!"}
{"text":"The 4.5 star rating had me eagerly awaiting to eat here.  After the first spoonful of pho broth I was sadder than a crying baby jesus....  Have any of you that are responsible for the 4+ ratings ever eaten a proper bowl of pho before?  What is a proper bowl you ask?  Look at my reviews and you shall seek the truth.  The broth was really salty and bland.  There was zero aromatics.  No  star anise, no cinnamon or any other spice.  A majority of the soup was taking over with rice noodles which left you with a small portion of broth, meat and goodies.  My wife had the egg roll salad.  Again,  disappointing.  The egg rolls tasted freezer burnt and the beef was over gunked in a Chinese like sweet sauce.    Unfortunately we both were not very happy with our food.  I mean, I ate it and didn't choke, cry or throw up but I wasn't anywhere near my happy place I'm usually at eating pho.  No complaints about the service and the restaurant was clean.  I did like they have real chopsticks at the table.  I have an illogical hatred for the snap off wooden chopsticks and the way they feel in your mouth, much like the popsicle stick the doc jams down your throat.  When I went up to pay I was alarmed when I seen a pho bowl(not sure of contents) in the microwave...and the non Vietnamese chef in the kitchen(not that you have to be Vietnamese to cook Vietnamese food) but in this case....just saying.    If anyone is looking for a legit place to eat pho send me a message."}
{"text":"Yeah this is some really good pho, the bowl super hot noodles cooked perfectly beef stayed tender until the last bite viet coffee excellent my new go to spot on the east side hope they are consistent, been there like 10 times now I'm all in this is the best pho I have ever had #19!"}
{"text":"Worst food I have had in ages! I dumped most of it down the garbage disposal. It was greasy, salty, and tasteless!"}
{"text":"The pho was yummy!  The broth had good depth of flavor.  Satisfied my pho craving.  Tommy, I'm assuming he was the owner/manager,  was so friendly and suggested other customer favorites to me.  His customer service alone makes me want to come back."}
{"text":"Have been here about once a week give or take, and the food has been very consistent. The pho soup base improved a bit, but it was already better than everywhere else. I have been here when it was slow and very busy and even then, the service has been very good. Glad to have this place in Chandler..  Pho Viet Nam, staff n Crew... Keep up the great work.."}
{"text":"The initial atmosphere wasn't necessarily impressive but our order came out swift and promptly. The food was nice and hot. My pho was delicious and fresh, some of the best I've had, most certainly satisfied my sickness desires. I would most definitely come again and recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"I tried this place when they first opened and felt the prices were too high so I didn't go back. Well yesterday I decided to try them again. And I'm glad I did. I was happy to see they lowered the pricing. Service was pretty good. Need to work on refills of drinks a bit but overall good. They are the only place I've seen the pork rolls and rice rolls on the menu. Typically I would have to ask my mom to make them. So that was a plus.  I also got their grilled pork egg rolls. Again. Very good."}
{"text":"Pho Viet Nom Nom Nom  Pho - Nam - ENAL  1 Star for the BROTH. Broth quality comes first when rating Pho in my opinion. Pho Viet Nam nails it. A perfect balance of Sweet, Roasted, and Savory, meat + veggie flavors at the same time in my mouth. It's like an orgy going on in there. A lesbian Suicide Girl orgy.   1 Star for opening up at 10am. Pho for breakfast anyone?? I think so. Rough night drinkin? Well you are in luck. Hot soup at 10 am is the shit, and will turn your hangover into that ceremony in Atlantis a short ways into Little Mermaid.. Except Ariel is present for this shin dig.. clam shells and all.  2 Stars go out to the owner who has made it a point to chat it up with me each time I have visited. Shout out to the guy who runs this tight ship for being friendly, and for keeping the place clean.  1 Star for VALUE.. These guys do not skimp on anything. My soup comes packed with meat, and noodles.. Every.Time. Even the herbs, veggies, and sauces you get are fresh, and abundant. Put all that shit in some orgasmic (tattoos.. piercings.. purple hair) broth and BOOM! You've got a 5 star Pho joint-"}
{"text":"Not worth your time. Better options around town, but went here cause our favorite New Pho restaurant was closed today  I had the broken rice and bbq pork with shredded pork dish it was just whit rice and a disgusting combo of cold julienned pork pieces with onions and bread crumbs??? The bbq pork was just ok. My wife had the pho with chicken and it was good but not as good as I have had elsewhere."}
{"text":"Don't understand keeping silverware at the table. Not super clean. Soup was great but the beef steak was tough. Ok priced"}
{"text":"Best PHO in this part of town.  The place is nothing fancy, but the food is great.  You can customize your order to you're liking.  PHO with shrimp adding veggies.....so GOOD!! Oh and they also offer fresh coconut water out of a coconut.  Everything is fresh and delicious.  I've been here 4 times and they're always consistent."}
{"text":"Best Asian/Vietnam food and Pho Soup in East Valley. Clean facilities and friendly staff."}
{"text":"If you come during winter time they do not turn on their heat so it's freezing in here. Came one morning for pho and it was lackluster, I could tell they heat it up the broth real quick and threw a block of noodles in there that was still hard.   I'd only come here for their shaking beef dish."}
{"text":"Im eating rn, and the broth is one of the more flavorful ones ive had in AZ hands down. Over all Pho dac biet is bamb. good portion too, but i am a smaller person.  Cafe sua da is perfff.  service is great:) they asked me what i was studying. quick about service and didnt brush me off like most asian resteraunts do.   coming back."}
{"text":"This is a pretty typical Vietnamese restaurant.  Their menu has all the classics.  We stated with the fried egg rolls.  They were pretty tasty, crisp and the filling was well seasoned, but the sauce was kind of flavorless.  I know this is the more classic sauce, but I tend to like it when they make it sweeter and give some extra spice!  Also had the beef noodle soup.  That was pretty good too.  Nothing all that different or interesting, but if you're going for a classic, you won't be disappointed.  The beef was actually very tender too.  Lastly, had a broken rice plate with beef and onions.  Good flavor here too and the rice was more tender (how broken rice should be) than some other places we've tried.  The service is clean and easy, again, exactly what you'd expect!  They explained some of the dishes we didn't know, but we ended up sticking with favorites.  I'd say this is a solid choice for a quick lunch and will be keeping them on my list for rushed lunch in the future!"}
{"text":"The vermicelli was to die for! Thai coffee was amazing. Spring rolls were delicious. Can't say enough good things about this place."}
{"text":"$21.29 for pho & spring roll. When you make take out, do you get charged for the to go containers, to go bag & etc..?  I can't believe 1 pho with 1 spring roll would cost $21.29.  When I asked for break down, they said they charge for vegetables & to go containers.  $8.95 pho $4.95 spring roll $1.20 tax (roughly) you pay $5 to give business...?  There's 1st time for everything but I don't think I would eat here ever again eventhough I am a frequent here (at least once a week, at 3 times a week sometimes)."}
{"text":"Typical no frills Vietnamese restaurant, but at least the restaurant is clean. Pretty good bun bo hue and pho here...but the pho tastes pretty standard to me. Not special, but still good. I prefer the bun bo hue here over the pho. Their broken rice plate is good. I just feel like their portions are pretty small for the price. Other than that, overall pretty good Viet food."}
{"text":"When you're sick with a bad cold and you're phlem-infested, all you want is a giant bowl of pho!  Wanting to try somewhere new, I was whisked to Pho Viet Nam under the promise of a hearty bowl of noodles.  The decor is much like the same of the previous business of Hawaiian BBQ.  The only difference is the stereotypical music playing the background.  We ordered some appetizers and two bowls of pho.  The spring rolls were decent and the peanut sauce was flavorful.  The egg rolls ended up being on the smaller end with only one leaf of lettuce for two rolls.  The pho itself was okay. The servings were huge and the broth had a nice clean taste to it but it's nothing super spectacular.  My skirt certainly didn't flip but I wouldn't be opposed to coming back.  Pay your tab at the counter.  This place can get pretty busy in the blink of an eye so service can be spotty.  Come to Pho Viet Nam if you want some no-fuss eats!"}
{"text":"Yummmm. I'm surprised to find such good Vietnamese food in Chandler but what can I say? This place is great.  Lots of parking in the strip mall. Lots of seating in a big restaurant. Decor is simple and what you'd expect from an authentic place that focuses on flavor. I loved the 70s Beegees soundtrack playing in the back.  Vermicelli bowl with beef was so delish. The beef was tender and well seasoned. Loved the fresh mint mixed amongst the fresh greens. Portion was big and I was very  full after just half the bowl. I sampled dishes my friends ordered and each was wonderful and flavorful.  Prices are reasonable, and service is good. I will be back! If you like Vietnamese food, this is where you need to eat."}
{"text":"Perfect place to have pho. It was so good I ate almost all my bowl (I never do that). I had the beef pho and my friend had the tofu. Our bowls had the perfect amount of veggies, meat, and broth."}
{"text":"This place is not sanitary. I got food poisoning both times I was there. The pho has too much msg. The utensils are not properly cleaned."}
{"text":"My husband and I only go to get pho at one restaurant in the west valley because they're good and the bowls are big and super cheap and they give you tons of meat and it's quick, no customer service non-sense, eat and get out kinda place, and that place is called Pho Thanh. Since we live in the east valley and can't always make it out that way, we've found Pho Viet Nam to be a runner up that still satisfies our pho cravings in the east valley. I will probably say we find their pho more flavorful than some of the other Vietnamese restaurants in the east valley. We  normally get an order of spring rolls, egg rolls, and two number 16s which is the combination pho with all the meats. Can't really complain about anything at this restaurant. Their food is good, service is good, fast and friendly."}
{"text":"I saw this place as I was toting my daughter to and from the Summer school hosted at Chandler Prep. TOTALLY reminds me of being back in San Jose, CA where all my favorite Phø {and Bahn mi} places were... Alas,  I was/am seriously down with a summer cold right now and NOTHING makes a cold better or faster than Phø, just nothing! This place has hit the nail with its broth!  I had the #13 which was PHENOM! and the man had #38 (sOOper yummy!) and the little one had a smaller bowl of what I was eating.  We all lapped up the soup, macked on the those tasty veggies and gobbled up the noodles. Let us not forget the cafe sua da like an espresso flavored miracle! To coin a phrase from Noor B., Yummmmm!  When Po's dad excitedly asked if he got the \"noodle dream\"!!  This is the DREAM he was referring to!  :D  Eat here!"}
{"text":"Very Awesome family run business.  I was there by myself and I could tell they really loved their food and they wanted you to be happy.  They asked if it was my first visit and showed me what they think are their best offerings.  I love it when a business cares enough to talk to you about why you came in, where you came from, and that they sincerely hope to see you again soon. This place oozes authentic, good vibes.  Oh, and the food is great.  Fast service!"}
{"text":"Pho is a dish I can consume daily.  This place has delicious pho at the most reasonable price in the valley.  Try it, you'll definitely love it"}
