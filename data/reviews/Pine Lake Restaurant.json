{"text":"Pine Lake used to have pretty good dim sum. I've been there many times in the past and have been impressed by the quality (for Calgary-standards, anyways). Yesterday I went there for dim sum. There were about 10 of us. We ordered a bunch of dim sum dishes as well as some noodle dishes. 

Unfortunately I was really disappointed with my experience yesterday. The e-fu fried noodles yesterday were mushy and lacked taste. Also, there were supposed to be enoki mushrooms in the dish but I hardly found any.  The singapore noodles were totally bland. There were not hint of curry, nevermind that it's normally supposed to have a little spicy punch.

With the dim sum dishes, the rice roll crepes (with bbq pork and shrimp)  looked a little on the mushy side and was not very appetizing. The turnip cake was ok. The egg tart was disappointing. While the pastry was flaky, the pastry tasted like they used oil/butter that wasn't fresh. My favourite out of the whole meal was the deep fried custard buns.  The sticky rice wrapped in leaves were ok, not as great as I remember them to be in the past. 

All in all I would say the standards for this place has slipped. I'm not sure if it's due to a change in who's running the kitchen. But it's definitely a notch down from where it was before and not necessarily a place I'll return to any time soon. While the service was decent and they were friendly and the food came out quickly, there was nothing memorable about the meal."}
{"text":"Ok so I heard that the dim sum is cheap here so I had to give it a try.  I didn't expect much to begin with so how disappointed can I be, right?  Well, this place sucks.  I can't put it any other way.  There's no place to park.  The place feels cramped.  The service was slow.  The food was bland to the point where I seriously think that the chefs forgot the seasoning.  I should of bought frozen dim sum and do it myself. There's virtually no taste to any of the items!  It was a full blown disappointment.  First and last time I'll eat here.  Is there half a star?"}
{"text":"After the bad reviews, I was surprised to enjoy the great atmosphere, service, food and prices."}
