{"text":"Decent greasy spoon for breakfast. I wouldn't go there for any other meal. Waitress was nice - food arrived in minutes."}
{"text":"Great breakfast! Hash browns are the best. Prices are low. My order came with two eggs, 3 slices of bacon, hash browns, 4 pieces of toast all for $3.95 and its was all so yummy!  Will visit again soon."}
{"text":"This is the dirtiest restaurant I think I've ever been to in my life. I have doubt that this place has been invested in in a long time. I didn't want to eat here but we did because we were starving. I am not from the area per say but I am willing  to bet there are a lot better options for breakfast in the area."}
