{"text":"Went in first time last night. Good food, good quantity, good price, and great service. I ordered the caesar salad and went off menu to get it with salmon. No problem and not overcooked.  The perch dinner was also very good. Will return again. Shout out to our waitress Nicole. She was \"on\" it!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent!  The bar has a bunch of tv's great for any and all sports you want to see.  Owners are super fun and came to our table several times to make sure everything was good.  The staff was very friendly.  Highly recommend the wings!  Best wings I have every had!  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"The Best Wings I have ever had...try the Poochallita Sauce!!!   Awesome!  Met the owners and they thanked us for coming in and came over to ensure our experience and food was to our liking.   Will definitely be back for sports events, local bands and trivia!"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to splurging on good bar food. Sadly, I was unable to. The Pulled Pork Potato Skins were bland. The Spinach Artichoke dip was more like soup, and in fact was taken back, and off the bill. My sis and I shared a Chicken Quesadilla.  Meh. We were there to check out a favorite act, Rick and Sharona and we thoroughly enjoyed them. The beer was fine. Service was good. It's just the food really needs to step up. It's pretty average to below average. 
It was a lovely, large bar, and has great potential. Do something about the kitchen and then you might have a winner. Pare down the menu. Start simple and make is great. Otherwise you're going to go the way of every other place that's been there."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on 2nd day being open.  Ordered 2 burgers and a club sandwich.  Multiple patrons came in and ordered after our order was placed.  Everyone received their food prior to ours. A gentleman who we later were told was the owner was dropping off food to the table next to ours.  We asked where our food was - he seemed to be bothered by this and responded that it's cooking.  He then asked what we ordered.  10 minutes prior to this our waitress said they were plating our food.  Looks like there are some kinks to be worked out.

Our food came out in approx 45 minutes.  The burgers were both ordered as medium - 1 came out medium well and the other came out rare.  When ordering tots - be ware that only 3 come with it.  They were really good though.  Side of fries were ordered with the other 2 orders - they both came with chips only. The waitress apologized and brought out one order of fries and then approx 10 minutes later another order of fries.

The owner never came back to apologize or check in on the orders.  Given this is a new business it is expected that there will be some early glitches.  It's all about how the issues are handled."}
