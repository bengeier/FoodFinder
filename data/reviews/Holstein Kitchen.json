{"text":"Going off other reviews we tried this place. If the cook/owner would stay in the back rather than bothering customers asking for good reviews, what shouldn't be allowed. The only good food coming out of this kitchen would be deep fried. Other than that our meal was warm and tasteless. How can a restaurant that claims to be farm to table come from a big delivery truck supplying all the food.   As far as service how can it be decent with such a big turnover. He treats his servers like second rate citizens the way he demeans them in such a condescending way. Please feel for the servers having to endure this treatment. Have you ever been to a party when someone thinks they're so funny but no one else does, well that's this guy."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants you'll ever find.  Due to hard surfaces a little noisy especially if \"time-out\" parents are there with the little ones who have never experienced discipline, but the food is wonderful.  Nothing like it."}
{"text":"Tried it back in Brooklyn and thought it was lousy.  Not much better on the new location.  To bad as we go out for breakfast a couple of times a week.  Try hq instead or go to stoughton. Weekend hours are not for breakfast, but more like a lunch."}
{"text":"Good service, good food, I ate the WHOLE thing (pecan crusted chicken), Generous house salad.  Fried green tomatoes were a seasonal treat.  My companions also enjoyed their dinners. Only complaint;  how about whole grain bread or rolls?  We will be back."}
{"text":"To paraphrase Seinfeld: \"You know how to 'take' the reservation, but you don't know how to 'hold' the reservation and that's really the most important part\".   We were attending my mother- and father-in-laws' joint 90th birthday dinner with family coming from several distant locations. My wife made the reservation while we were there for dinner several weeks ago and they took our number and confirmed it. Our group showed up ready to eat, but were turned away due to a private party - the whole place was closed to the public at 5pm on a Thursday evening! The man who spoke with our party (he is the seated man in the white jacket in the employee photo posted on Yelp) was rude, appeared insincere in his apology and came off as downright annoyed with us for bothering him - he refused to answer ANY questions on why no one called us, what happened, how this happened or anything. He just kept reciting the same thing telling us he could not help us.  Last minute, we called Mulligans Bar & Grill in Oregon who were happy to accommodate our group, provided spectacular service and excellent food. (see https://www.yelp.com/biz/mulligans-bar-and-grill-oregon)  We live in Oregon and have been to HK many times in the past as the food is generally good though as others have noted service varies. Never again. What a disappointment!"}
{"text":"Good food but service was poor. They forgot our salads and then brought them with our meal. No refilling of water. Our server was nice but untrained and too young to know how to handle things when they go wrong - she was frazzled and left the tray holder and didn't take dishes away. Disappointing- won't go back or refer my friends. Too many great local restaurants in madison."}
{"text":"Holstein Kitchen is pretty great. My first visit was on a weekday for lunch, with my husband.   If this place served sweet tea and Dr. Pepper, I'd swear I was in Texas.  We started with fried green tomatoes; they were garnished with pickled vidalia onions, pimentos, and (what I think was) a remoulade, and served on a bed of mixed greens; they were just as good as any fried green tomatoes we've had in TX. Then we shared the macaroni and cheese and fried chicken sandwich w/ fries, both of which were great. I can't say it's THE BEST mac & cheese I've ever had, but I've definitely had worse. The chicken sandwich was outstanding; I don't think I've ever had such juicy, white-meat chicken. And then there's dessert -- they only had two to choose from, and they were half-price (not certain why; maybe just because it was lunch?), so we tried both. The key lime pie was lighter and fluffier than most, with a graham cracker crust. Loved it. The peach cobbler was served warm, but without ice cream; it was still quite good.  Can't wait to go back to try fish fry on a Friday and breakfast on a weekend."}
{"text":"Drove from Monona to Oregon to investigate shops in the area last week and stopped in here for dinner.  Very tasty food, friendly but not trying-too-hard service and pleasant atmosphere. Nice folk, acoustic music selection enhanced dinner experience, too.   I was pleased at the prices for a farm-to-table kind of place.    Chef came out and spoke to us about what we liked about our dinner, etc. -- and I told him how much I enjoyed liked their version of a chicken friend steak -- without the usual goopy gravy. (Their version has a veal glaze applied first...so that it's right next to the meat...before the whole thing is fried) and we also talked about other \"Southern\" food that we've enjoyed in other locales. He also commented, \"thanks for letting me cook for you tonight.\"  That was an impressive touch.   The General Tso's cheese curds, offered as an appetizer, were  yummy.  My husband, whose tastes are often limited to well-done beef (no chicken, fish, pork, etc.), was very pleased with his burger selection and that they switched out his side preference (to snap peas!) with no qualms at all.  I believe they also comped his side salad so that I wouldn't have to have my course of that alone - which was very considerate.   I liked the dressing a lot - unlike the Yelper below who lamented there was no vinaigrette option (there was when we visited,) The salad was flavorful...though I neglected to ask for the blue cheese or feta crumbles to be left off (totally my fault..I'm sure they would have complied happily - they were happy to please for whatever we asked for.)  We opted not to have dessert...instead, walked up the street to the nearby ice cream parlor. On our way back, our waitress was straightening up the front door and poked her head out to tease us for going to get ice cream...but not in an admonishing way. It was funny...and nice that she took the time to do so.  A bit on the pricey side for my budget to go to every week...but a nice place to visit. A very flavorful meal and relaxing, un-rushed service. Will be back whenever we'd like to treat ourselves again."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem in Oregon we've been missing out on!!  We stopped by on a whim and now I can't wait to get back.  Everything from the service to the appetizers to entrees to dessert was amazing.  The fresh bread was incredible, the honey pecan chicken was the best meal I've had in years.  The meatballs and Mac-and cheese were also amazing.  And the cream puffs - yum! Scott, the owner, and April were so warm and welcoming, which just topped off one of the best meals I've had in a long time.  This place isn't just good for a small town like Oregon, it's better than many restaurants I've eaten at in larger cities.  Can't wait to get back and try brunch!"}
{"text":"I am not a fan of this restaurant. I understand -- and love -- the concept of farm-to-plate but the menu is just so limited. How could there not be a steak or a pork chop or a grilled chicken breast on the menu? Maybe because it's Friday? But if you're going to forgo meat for a fish-only menu, how about something more than just tilapia? And why put mashed potatoes on the menu and then not have them? Especially when the menu touts how wonderful they are? Mashed potatoes are a staple of any \"farm based\" restaurant. And I was really excited about them.   I will say that I was met promptly, seated quickly, and attended to right away. My server was polite and quick, and the kitchen turned my order out quickly. The food that I got was cooked well enough, though perhaps with more paprika than necessary, but nothing about it had any real pizazz.   I was disappointed in salad dressing choices as well. Every restaurant should offer a nice balsamic vinaigrette for folks looking for a lighter dressing.   The price was higher than I expected for Oregon, even though I'm willing to pay more for local, farm direct food.   It's unlikely I'll go here again."}
{"text":"A great little restaurant in downtown Oregon.  Was there during brunch time and the waitress suggested the French Toast.  I got the \"Sweet & Savory\" which pairs scrambled eggs with Havarti Cheese seasoned with a little dill and a half order of the French Toast.    The eggs were light and fluffy, cheesy but not overwhelmingly so.  The French Toast is really something special.  A large wedge of bread battered and flash-fried to make a crunchy outer crust and soft warm center.  The bread is dusted with powdered sugar and I went with the traditional maple syrup to top it off.  It's a refreshingly different take on French Toast to say the least!  Some items on the menu are a bit more expensive that you'd see at a chain restaurant, but they use a lot of local ingredients with their food and this is certainly better than chain restaurant quality.  I'll pay a few more dollars for the quality and I'm anxious to go back to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"I've eaten here now four or five times, for both dinner and breakfast, and have been really impressed. My favorite entree for dinner is the U-Pick Farm Plate, where you get to pick three different sides for your entree, plus it comes with salad and warm bread. I love the mac n' cheese - it is some of the best restaurant mac 'n cheese you will find anywhere. Great addition to Oregon - love the atmosphere."}
{"text":"I'm leaving this place 5 stars not only because I can't leave 4.5, but also because I want so bad for this place to succeed and become even better. The place definitely has a great concept and great food. My complaints are small.  My wife and I decided to try the place despite mixed reviews. I've come to understand that sometimes reviews are just very wrong. We've visited \"wonderful, awesome\" places that turned out to be horrible. We've visited \"not worth your time\" places just to discover how wonderful those places actually are. I feel this place is closer to the later.  I ordered the pecan fried chicken and my wife had the meatloaf. I'm still thinking about the bone-out, crispy, sweet, maple-pecan topped chicken, and the mac and cheese is some of the best I've had (I stole a bite from my wife). I would visit the place just for a bowl of the creamy gooey cheesey awesomeness! For an appetizer we had fried green tomatoes, which were awesome and served on a bed and salad and cheese curds. I had peach cobbler for dessert, which was also very good, but I love peach cobbler so maybe I'm biased.  My only complaint is by ordering the tomatoes which were on a huge pile of greens while also ordering dinners that came with more salad, we had ridiculous piles of greens. I would have preferred to pick a side other than salad, even if it were just a good soup.   Overall, I would recommend the Holstein Kitchen. I love fish fries, so I will be sure to stop in some Friday night."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. The wait staff is the best we have had anywhere in Madison area. Our server from the time before remembered us and our son's allergy and told our current server before we did. At least 3 other servers stopped by to make sure we had what we needed and say nice things to our kids. I had a small complaint about my dish - though it was amazingly delicious (Mert's eggs) - and they made me a whole new dish even though my first dish was mostly gone. Extremely friendly service and delicious food - highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night for the fish. It was very good! The mixed greens salad and warm bread first was great too. Our server was polite and attentive. The atmosphere is nice.  The only small complaint is that though there were open tables we had to wait but it was only about 15 minutes. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"While this may seem quiet and country from the first glance, but the menu will give you more insight to the level of food you're about to eat. Burgers that don't mess around, creative spins on classic dishes like chicken cordon bleu, and the obligatory but not boring cheese curds. Madison folks - this is a hidden gem 15 minutes from downtown, hit it up before everyone else does!"}
{"text":"After two visits I am a big fan.  I loved their restaurant in Brooklyn and am glad quality has not suffered with a busier location.  Their current focus is local sourced ingredients served 'farm style'.   The food truly reminds me of meals my Grandma made for me."}
{"text":"Wow! After hearing mixed reviews and waiting a month for them to settle in and get any kinks out, we finally tried the new Holstein Kitchen in Oregon. Immediately noticed the smiles from the waiters as the friendly hostess led us to a nice windowed table. Our waiter arrived quickly and made us feel very much at ease. Huge star for service!! All dinners pretty much in that $11-$15 range! Are you kidding? Best value in Oregon. We ordered the meat loaf dinner (came with an amazing side of mac & cheese) and the honey pecan fried chicken with garlicky green beans. We ordered the cheese curds for an appetizer, which were topped with chive and Parmesan and accompanied with a nice aioli sauce. They were under seven bucks and were terrific and a nice amount. A wonderful fresh garden salad (not some cheap iceberg mind you) came next along with a warm bread board. The meatloaf was delish and very large. The chicken and green beans were outstanding as well.  We were too full for dessert (key lime pie or peach cobbler for a measly four bucks). Read the couple 2 star review previously. Complaining that the menu is on paper? Really? Then go to McD's and get the menu on a drive-thru plastic sign!!! Bravo Holstein Kitchen and a warm welcome to Oregon"}
{"text":"Last night was our second time at Holstein Kitchen and while it did not have the WOW factor i am always looking for in a restaurant, it did not disappoint either.  So we went in last night and were the first people in there for night.   The wait staff was very nice and remembered us from a few weeks back when we had brunch there.   That was very nice.  Anyway, we were seated and while I knew they only had wine and beer....i really wanted a cocktail.  Anyway, that is what it is and while the wine that had was good I wish the selection was a bit larger and wish they got a liquor license.  But whatever, I am not here to review drinks.  So, with like any new place when we see cheese curds on the menu we have t try them.  They were ok.  I liked the flaring done to them but the breading was thick and the Aioli that came with it pretty much tasted like Mayo.   Cheese Curd Grade:  C-  But, also with the cheese curds the chef/owner brought out a small plate of the pulled pork for us to sample and it was amazing.  What a great touch and also made my wife wish she ordered something else.  Now, when you look at the menu you will not see steak on the menu but they have it!   Oh yes they have it!    I got the delmonico rib-eye steak and it was a great cut of meat.   A little over buttered and under slated but cooked perfect and delicious.    My wife tried the Southern Fried Chicken and it was ok.   The chicken was good but the breading was very very heavy and also had a sweet taste to it.   Now I lived in the south for a long time and never had sweet way heavy breaded chicken.  But, the chicken inside the bread was very good. The kids....well thats easy.  Daughter had the broiled chicken and it was delicious and the son has butter noodles and they were even very good.  BEWARE:  The portions are large....so much that we all could have split two meals if we liked the same things.  Also, it is pricey but I understand why being a Farm to Table restaurant.   Speaking of....where do they get the local farm to table kale?  So...I was finished with my steak and the wife/kids still working on their meals.   The owner/chef came out again and wanted to make sure we liked our meals and specifically my steak (I assume this is something they want to add to the menu in the future.)   He than sat down a bowl of loaded garlic mashed potatoes with a side of meat loaf.   Asked if we cared to sample this new item he was working on.   WOW....very good.   The potatoes were great and loaded with these and bacon and while the meatloaf was a little overcooked for me it was still flavored very well.  In a city like Oregon that has such a lack of QUALITY places to eat, Holstein Kitchen is a great little hometown place.  My only complaints were the lack of mixed drinks, cheese curds, and the breading on my wife chicken.   It is just good old farm cooking and I love that.  Also seems to be run by a very good person.   Normally I end with some sarcastic joke or quip but nah....just happy to write a good review for a change."}
{"text":"HIT & MISS My wife and I drove the 25 minutes from Janesville to Oregon, WI this morning (DEC 19) to have brunch at Holstein's Kitchen. We arrived about 10am and the place was pretty much empty. Oddly though, they initially sat us right next to the only other people eating there. We moved one table away because, well, why not, there was plenty of room. The menu is fairly large and everything is unique so it took a bit of time to decide. We both ordered coffee in the meantime (coffee is quite good). My wife ordered the bacon spinach kale omelet. I ordered the Four Hour Pork Hash and Eggs. The eggs come scrambled but thinking I was getting hash, I asked for them over easy (but changed my mind as my wife wanted to taste the pimento cheese eggs). We had heard the french toast was excellent and ordered one piece. We had heard the same about their mac and cheese and ordered a side of it.  THE GOOD I am not a fan of kale and barely one of spinach. But my wife's omelet was outstanding. It has tons of flavor with just enough garlic. My wife said it did not need the bacon and would order that on the side next time (I liked it with the bacon). The spinach kale omelet was the highlight of the meal.  The mac and cheese was also very good. It was hot (temperature hot) and bubbling with several kinds of cheese. Very good.  The fresh strawberry jam was a hit. (Bread review in the MEH section below)  MIXED The french toast (pain perdue) was indeed tasty. But it was cold. The butter would not melt on it. That's cold. It tasted very good though. And the maple syrup is real. I would order it again but next time insist on a warm piece if it arrived cold.  MEH Perhaps calling an item 'hash\" made me think I was getting a dish that was more like a corned beef hash. The pork hash was just pulled pork cooked with bbq sauce on top of fried potatoes (they ladle more bbq sauce on top - I was lucky I asked for that on the side). Pork tasted OK. But it wasn't hash (at least what I believe breakfast hash to be) so I was disappointed.  The pimento cheese scrambled eggs tasted great. Holstein's uses farm fresh eggs. However the eggs must be small as it was a very tiny portion for two eggs. Again, flavor was very good. Portion not so much.  MORE MEH My wife got an english muffin with her omelet. It was probably toasted but arrived hardly so and cold.   Our fried potatoes were overcooked. My wife's came as a side. My pork sat atop mine. We barely ate them. Potatoes were not good.  The place looks great. Bathrooms were very clean. Wait staff was wonderful. The place is not huge but as more people arrived, they seated everyone next to each other (up against the wall). So 2/3 of the room was empty and all of the people eating were crammed up against the wall. Odd.   Food was hit and miss. Enough good to go back though. Hope this helps."}
{"text":"The food was good. However when it came to a side order of bacon for $3.95 it was only two pieces Yikes! The menu was very confusing. Hard to tell what was a meal, what  was a \"farm breakfast\" and what was an \"add-on.\" The service was rather spotty. In addition, our waitperson short changed us by $1.50. That was inexcusable. Not sure we'll be back."}
{"text":"The BEST Vegetable and beef soup my husband and I ever had!!! it had Cajun sausage in it and was UNBELIEVABLE!!! Also, we had a salad that what so fresh and delicious, it was all orgasmic!!!"}
{"text":"Service is much improved. Been here several times recently. Love the food. It was prepared perfectly. I especially loved the baked cod."}
{"text":"Okay,  so I really want to love this place, and but this out send visit, and so far it's always fallen just a little short.  Tonight was our first dinner experience-   The kid's chicken was good.  It was crispy on the outside, and while there we a few odd fatty bits, it was overall tasty.  But, despite the menu saying it was large enough for 2 children and being 7.95... it wasn't quite.  The chicken too, rather being in individual strips, was 1 breaded breast that had been fried then chopped... like peanut butter chicken.  Despite what the menu said,  with the fries, it wasn't quite enough for my 11mn old and my 4yr old together, but they seemed to like it. I'd love to see an option other than fries as a side.... but the fries were beer battered and exceptionally good.    I on the waitresses recommendation had the cheapest thing on the menu.... their cheeseburger, whose name excapes me.  It 11.95 with those same tasty fries, and the cheese, bread and butter pickles, and sautéed onions paired with a really nice bun and good medium rare burger was great.    My husband had the clams and tilapia which he similarly enjoyed for 15.95.  It too came with fries, plus he received a tasty, though somewhat conceptually muddled, little salad.  Desert was a chocolate torte with little cream puff ecliars.  It was all good- the service was good.  The good was good.  The atmosphere was nicr.  The hostess was friendly.  But there was simply nothing that I was crave to the point my dreams are invaded by its memory.  Their burger was tasty, but it I won't send a scavenger party forth for it next time I'm drinking like might the Tornado's legendary late night steak sandwich.  Their tilapia, chicken, and salad were tasty, but I won't salivate as I drive past like I do when I think of the Old Fashioned's crisp Walleye Sandwich and door county cherry and goat cheese salad.  Their ecliars and torte weren't bad, but like much of the meal, they weren't a quite memorable either... I won't replace my birthday cake with them like did with Grandpa's pizzeria's sticky ginger cake last year....  So long and short.  I'd come back.... despite the prices generally being a little higher than I'd like to see.... but will I crave it to the point that make a regular pilgrimage down the road from Madison.  Probably not.  Ps.  It's assine to print in your menu that you don't like split plates.  If we pay for the food we should be able to divy it up however we choose."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this, but I'm continually disappointed when I go.  The service is always slow and something is forgotten/not brought out when it should be.  I appreciate the farm to table concept and would love to know where the items are coming from.  I think the prices are high for what you get ($9.50 for french toast and $11.75 for an omelet). The poor service and high prices combined make it a 2 star."}
{"text":"What baffles me is that for years people have raved about the food and complained bitterly about the lousy service, AND NOTHING CHANGES!     My wife and I have had breakfast here twice--really enjoying the food and not receiving good service.   Tonight, we tried their Friday fish with much the same result--great food and lousy.... No, terrible... service.  The salad was excellent, the fish was very good (the cod was better than the tilapia, and the French fries were probably the best I've ever had.  The food would easily earn five stars, but our evening was ruined by our server.     She wasn't unfriendly, just uncaring, and definitely did everything to best suit HER schedule. We were seated and waited.... And waited...  After more than fifteen minutes, our server finally decided to swing by our table after having spent quite awhile chatting at the next table.  Then things happened quickly--way too quickly!  I ordered a beer which was delivered, then we got our salads a minute later, then our entrees were served a minute after that!  Annoyed, I remarked that we would have liked to have had more time with our salads and our wonderful server actually blamed it on the chef!   We had dinner and then time--or was it our server--slowed down again.  We got our bill and waited.... And waited....  for our server to pick up our payment.  She chatted at one table... was gone from view for quite awhile, then chatted at another table.....  Finally, my normally reserved wife yelled her name and STILL she found other things to do before coming to pick up our payment. Unreal!   Holstein, your food is top notch and your service is.....horses--t.  Obviously, you don't read these reviews or you don't care.  Either way, you've lost our business."}
{"text":"Holstein might be what Oregon has been missing, a restaurant with fresh, homemade food that is actually good!   The good:  Food was pretty solid. They have a menu and specials based on what is in season, local and good. This afternoon, we ordered a bowl of fresh cherries (which were awesome and a welcomed oddity on a menu), poppy seed salad, chicken soup, and mac-n-cheese. All were good! Service was very friendly and attentive.   What needs improvement: Menu is really overpriced. The prices are in Capital Square territory. Even when the ingredients are fresh, this is too expensive. Menu is sort of hard to read too. Needs to be simplified like a normal menu.  All in all, we will definitely be back!! Keep it up Holstein folks!"}
{"text":"Tried twice. First attempt -  brunch was a disappointment. Mid morning and already out of the sausage meal.  French toast is something you either love or hate. A single piece of deep fried bread doesn't do it for us.  On the positive side, the jam was good and you got your own personal sized jar of it.  Friday night fish fry.  Arrived at 5:30 and only two tables were already seated. There were 5 wait staff and a manager/owner (?) visible. Requested extra lemon for my fried cod only to learn that they were out of lemons. Seems like someone should have run the mile to the store to buy lemons on a Friday Fish Fry night.    Cod dinner consisted of two fish stick sized pieces. They were cooked well, but under seasoned and overpriced. Luckily, I kept the parmesan cheese dust from my cheese curd appetizer and used it to add flavor ... since they had no lemons and I detest tarter sauce - my only other seasoning alternative.   Coleslaw was tasty. Fries were good. Marbled rye bread might as well be Wonder Bread for all the flavor it had. The single slice came cut in half, pre-buttered and stuck buttered face together. What if you don't like butter? This butter was completely tasteless.   I wish the owner would focus less on marketing his farm to table concept and actually deliver on high-quality food. We'd love to support a local restaurant but won't be returning."}
{"text":"This was our second time visiting Holstein's Kitchen, the first time was at their previous location.  We specifically sought out Holstein in Oregon, because our first experience there was amazing! The food was great, the atmosphere was great, everything was as close to perfection as could be.  Now that does not mean that this occasion was by any means bad, but because it was so good previously I had to give them a four this time and I look forward to our next visit being a 5 star again after they get the kinks of a new place run smooth.  The French toast is still wonderful and leaves you wondering how they do it and the menu still offers enough choices that it is hard to choose, but not to many that it looses it's fresh feel.  The three pigs breakfast is also a really great plate and my boyfriend holds it as a meat lover's breakfast standard.  My final comment is this: go try Holstein's, this will not be a meal you regret."}
{"text":"Been here several times now. The portions are large and the food is clearly made with fresh ingredients. Brunch has been superb. Everything we have ordered has been tasty. Would be 4 or 5 stars if it were not for the consistently poor and slow waitress. We've had the same waitress all three times we have been here and always need to retell our order. Unfortunate, because the food is great."}
{"text":"Holstein Kitchen was my Dad's favorite place to eat in Oregon. So when my father died this April, I called them to see if they would be interested in hosting his wake.   As a person planning a funeral, most people - at minimum - when they talk to you will say \"I am so sorry for your loss.\"  Not only did the owner not seem to care at all about my loss - or my father's love of the Holstein Kitchen - he was extremely rude to me and treated me as if I had put some awful chore on his plate by even requesting the IDEA of hosting a wake at the Kitchen. He was rude, unprofessional, and unfeeling."}
{"text":"Went here as a large group (~20 people) for my mother's wedding reception. They opened early for us, and the chef even came out to tell us about the food while each course was served. I found that the waitstaff was knowledgeable about the ingredients and were great about answering any questions I had. Portions were large and about $20-25 bucks a head. The food itself is unique and really tasty; you definitely need to try the Tso cheese curds. My only complaint is that it isn't in Madison!"}
{"text":"They have the best Friday night fish fry. You have to go. I love the fact that you can choose from two different kinds of fish. The service is always friendly and the price is right you have to go"}
{"text":"We recently moved from San Diego to Oregon and it was a real pleasure dining at Holstein Kitchen.  First and foremost, service exceeded our expectations! Melissa was excellent!  She took very good care of us and made excellent recommendations.  The first time we went in for a late brunch on Sunday.  The french toast was to die for!  So worth the calories and carbs.  We went back in for dinner on Thursday and received equally wonderful service and a great meal!  The key lime pie was the best I'd ever tasted!   The prices are extremely reasonable...in my opinion a great value for what you get.  Don't forget to ask for Melissa!"}
{"text":"Housed in the former location of what was the DeBroux diner, the Holstein Kitchen is a big improvement to the corner for service and a hardy breakfast. I had had a really bad service experience at DeBroux, making my visit a one-and-done, never going back. The new owners of this restaurant are taking service seriously and the friendly, attentive staff deserve your generous tips.  I ordered the Americana scramble, soft and fluffy eggs with cheddar, bacon and well-spiced sausage links mixed in. I like my bacon more crispy than what's in the scramble, but it's smoky and delicious.  The scramble came with toast and potatoes. The bread was a dense, thick wheat and very lightly toasted. A ramekin of soft butter made the bread a treat, but it's not for the Wonder Bread fans. The thick-cut potatoes are deep-fried and crispy, but I'll ask for a different side next time - there are sautéed greens that look more interesting.    The highlight of the meal was the French Toast that came on the side. Two huge pieces of thick bread, soaked in a cinnamony, custard batter and fried to be soft and fluffy inside and crispy on the outside. It's a rich treat for your diet cheat day, but totally worth it.    Other notes: the coffee is good enough to drink black. The decor has a cute, farmhouse theme and everything is clean and simple. I appreciated the bluegrassy music with albums and songs I recognized (the Stoughton opera house crowd will love this place).  My suggestions for improvements: ditch the plastic ramekins and invest in stainless steel. Rethink the exit - only front door - routing traffic around back makes sense, but not welcoming guests through the picturesque front, corner door is a wasted opportunity and people will continue to be confused. People can wander back to the host's stand. Take a tip from Wendigo Tavern and add some local, oversized art to the walls. A few walls could use some theme - appropriate art. The prettiest tables are the ones without tablecloths. Is real maple syrup an option? Are there more local CSAs that could be providing meat, dairy and veggies? Even if standard specials aren't 100% local, your daily specials can be.    Good stuff, Holstein. Keep it up."}
{"text":"I really, REALLY wanted to like this place.  There's not much else in Oregon.  But I don't.  I tried them 3 times.  I'm done.  Breakfast in their original location, breakfast in Oregon, and a dinner in Oregon.  I have yet to experience a complete, quality service.  1st breakfast was cold, although the eggs were tasty.  Having to listen to the owner/chef BS at another table, extoling the whole farm-to-table concept, was a bit much when I'm staring at cold scrambled eggs.    I was hopeful when they opened in Oregon.  But the 2nd breakfast was no better.  Largely empty house, and they were out of 2 of my first choices.  OK, give them the benefit of the doubt that they're working out the supply kinks.  Cold french toast, deepfried, with no seasoning.  Thick enough that it should have been prepared correctly (custardy on the inside), but no better than any 2-bit diner.  Made worse by watching the owner/chef strut around the floor, eventually spreading himself out at vacant table and holding court with his wait staff.    Dinner was a mess.  I went with the meatloaf and was seriously disappointed.    Only a single slice, no seasoning, the smashed potatoes had no butter or cream to impart richness so they had a weird watery texture, and even the brown gravy was bland and not enough provided to wet the loaf.    The wait staff is generally friendly and chatty, but continually having to make excuses for being out of this or that.  The owner /chef certainly talks the talk regarding farm-to-table, but can't walk the walk.  Supply problems (no lemons on fish fry night?!?), cold, bland food, and prices more than it's worth?  I'll pass."}
{"text":"We were excited to try the new location in Oregon.  Few glitches here and there - but somewhat understandable because of its newness. Work on your supply - a Sunday Brunch place should NEVER be out of their top selling menu option. A true disappointment when the first thing announced as we were seated.  Wait staff seems to still be scrambling. No one refilling water, coffee. Had to wait 20 minutes for more coffee to brew. Server announced every time she went back to get the pot it was empty.  Huh? Where's the host - not that busy that he couldn't be making more coffee, filling waters and assisting the wait staff. Staff needs more direction - a lot of standing around. No team got your back attitude. Three out of the 4 plates came out of the kitchen incomplete or with errors.  Tighten it up - you've worked hard on a great concept - will give you more time to work out some kinks and then coming back with the same party to try dinner."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed a meal at this little gem.  Great food, great service, fair prices.  I'll be back.  Oregon is a cute town as well - nice quick trip from Madison."}
{"text":"Food is ok. Kind of strange in my opinion that toast with the meal is just one slice. Usually I see two and one was just a bit short for two eggs. Wondering why with 14 tables only seating 8. Says he only has 4 severs in so he doesn't want to overwhelmed them. I think he just was a 15 minute wait to feel busy. Everyone waiting does have seating available and severs are just waiting for food with nothing to do???"}
{"text":"This restaurant formerly operated in Brooklyn WI- we discovered it there and loved the food. They're close to home now in Oregon. This morning my party of two stopped for brunch and we were nothing short of thrilled. My date had cheese curds (breakfast of champions I guess) and they were awesome. Hand breaded and dusted with Parmesan goodness.   The stunner was my meal. If you haven't been here, or been in a while, you really need to drop what you're doing and zip in. The honey pecan fried chicken waffle dish is the finest version of chicken and waffles that money can buy. I've had it all over the US and the very best available is in Oregon WI. Go buy it. Now.   Service wasn't instant, but it was intensely pleasant. The staff are very well educated on menu and ingredients, which really adds to the experience.   Holstein Kitchen is the premier dining spot in this community, with no close second. Thanks for the extraordinary meal."}
{"text":"I've been craving a better brunch option than what's currently offered in Stoughton, so we ventured out to Oregon.  I had cheese curds (super yummy) and brunch nachos (eggs and bacon on tortilla chips). I'm not sure I'll order the nachos again, but we'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"Extremely over priced, unreliable and inconvenient hours. I honestly would not recommend it to friends and family.  Have actually opted to travel away from Oregon to get a more family friendly and more reasonable priced place for breakfast"}
{"text":"Like others said, service has a few kinks.  Roast beef, while plentiful, was cold and gravy lacked flavor I associate with farm style cooking.  Salads on two near by tables arrived either with entree or AFTER and both tables were not happy.  Brought the wrong burger which was fine as it was good and bill was adjusted but again points to disconnect between floor and kitchen or training?  Would give it another try but if experience is the same, will cross it off my Yelp list."}
{"text":"We enjoyed this restaurant.  The decor is fresh and clean. The service was adequate. Took awhile to get our waitress to process our bill. The food was very good and a bit different without being weird. My only complaint would be that if you are touting your french toast as amazing (it was very good!), you may want to consider serving REAL maple syrup!  Source it locally if possible, but serving crap syrup, kind of wrecked the amazingness of your highly touted farm to table experience!  The prices certainly justify real maple syrup.  People go to farm to table restaurants to avoid overly processed foods.  My only other concern was that the waitress asked us if we wanted fresh squeezed orange juice. We passed, wanting coffee instead. A minute later, we saw a server carrying a gallon of orange juice to the server station.  Freshly squeezed?  Huh. Maybe it's freshly squeezed in the back?  I hope?  Anyway, I hope they succeed. We need places like this."}
{"text":"Holsteins is my new favorite establishment, a true diamond in the rough.  8 of us took a friend here for a birthday celebration and all of us thoroughly enjoyed the meal and the atmosphere.  This is comfort food at its finest and not meant for those counting calories.  From the NY strip to the fried chicken and the delectable sides, you will not be disappointed. The chef even gave a complimentary meal to the birthday boy!  The service here was fast and extremely friendly, we were treated as if we were part of their family.  Beyond Ritz Carlton service.  We were so impressed with the food that we came back the next day for brunch which equally impressed.  The servers and chef remembered us and were sincerely happy to see us and grateful we returned.    I will be frequenting Holsteins for as long as I am able.  Thanks for the great food and experience!"}
{"text":"Amazing French toast!! Great service and nice atmosphere.  Try the bacon and sausage, very fresh and done just right."}
{"text":"Awesome food and fish fry.  Curds and onion rings were amazing.  Only complaint is that the severs, while pleasant, get overwhelmed by the number of customers.  Need more help!"}
{"text":"I was part of a party of 6 that had lunch at the Holstein Kitchen on a Friday.  I wish I could give it a 2.5 but went with a 3.  The good review:  all 6 of us thought our food was very good/excellent.  Two of us got the tilapia plate which comes with a small salad.  It was very good but both the salad and fish portions were pretty small; I think most diners would want to also order a cup of soup or something as an appetizer.  The roast beef sandwich, on the other hand, looked pretty substantial.  The basket of bread for the table was very good, I didn't even need to use butter on my slice.  The bad news:  while our waitress was very friendly, service was extremely slow.  She dropped off food menus and one drink menu and then left; she did not return for quite some time, at which point we ordered our meals and requested water & other beverages.  When she delivered our food, she had only 5 plates, not 6.  It was clear she had forgotten to enter one of the sandwich orders.  By the time it arrived, the rest of us had finished our meals.  She also did not bring another ice tea as requested.  Including our table, there were 5 tables (3 of which had only 2 people) being served by 2 waitresses so we expected better service.  Also, the temperature inside was freezing!!!  Some of us were wearing sweaters and we were still cold; I had to put my hands in my jacket pockets to warm up.  Not sure what that was all about."}
