{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant featuring an Indian cuisine. The service is wonderful and everyone treats you well. They're lunch buffet has a wide selection of foods and desserts and it is by far the best I've ever tasted. I recommend this place for anyone in the mood for Indian."}
{"text":"Very good Biryani. Tasty food. A must in Madison. Thoroughly enjoyed every morsel. The owner is pleasant and knows how to please his patrons.  Ambience can be interpreted as both fine and casual. The paintings are very beautiful. I'd suggest the owner to hire more staff or be attentive to every customers needs."}
{"text":"My new favorite restaurant in Madison - Indian or otherwise.  It's roomy with a pleasant atmosphere, has a private dining room and an extensive buffet.  The food is the best!    I'm vegan with extra restrictions- whole food, gluten-free, and nightshade-free (no tomatoes, potatoes, bell and hot peppers, eggplant).  It's a tall order and they do an amazing job. There are several options for me, and I haven't even tried them all, yet.  What I have had is excellent - spinach with chick peas, Gobi Manchurian, dosas, uttapham, hot and sour soup, and poppadan (thin crackers).  My 10 year old daughter adds to the list - mango ice cream.  My 12 year old son loves their fried rice and cheese naan.  My husband loves the vegetable biryani and many of the vegetarian items on their buffet.   They never rush us.  We are welcome to hang out.  At the end of the meal, they give us hot, moist towels."}
{"text":"Amber Indian Cuisine is the gold standard when it comes to Indian in Madison. Please, this is no slight to the handful of other fantastic Indian restaurants in the Madison area (Swagat, Swad, Haveli, etc.), but Amber has set themselves apart.   Please note, my experience with Amber is with the lunch buffet only. I have not been here for dinner (on a side note, if any owner of an Indian restaurant is reading this: please make a dinnertime buffet! My wife and I would gladly pay more for a nighttime buffet!).   It starts with who I believe is the owner (not 100% sure), but the person who greets you at the door really makes you feel welcome. He doesn't say much but he smiles at you and greets you, the customer, as if you were the day's guest of honor and you've finally arrived. I like that guy, kudos if he is the owner. If he's not, they selected their manager/host very well.   The food's plethora of options is only outdone by its quality. We've been to Amber at least 7 times and each time has been different than the last as far as buffet selection. The staples are there (Tikka masala, biriyani, chana masala, samosa, tandoori chicken, chicken 65, naan, etc.), but they are regularly changing it up and giving you the chance to sample exciting new Indian cuisine. The dishes are packed with flavor, and there are PLENTY of options that are regularly rotated in with freshly-cooked food.   I also need to add that no matter how full I feel, there's still always room for a hot, soothing bowl of the coconut soup. It is not too sweet and the coconut flavor is there but not overpowering you. It's so simple but the flavor is complex and is always my final 'course' at the buffet.   I would recommend going earlier in the lunch rush (11:30-12:45), as we've gotten there at or around 2 and have noticed less action on replenishing the food. This is understandable as it's the end of the rush, but other nearby Indian places keep it filled to the brim, it seems, until close to 3pm.   They have a decent bottled beer selection. I could see that the music and music videos always playing could be seen as annoying to some, but I think the volume is appropriate and I personally enjoy it.   They offer coupon once in a while (perhaps $2 off a buffet) that we've used.   I cannot complain about Amber. Please keep up the great work. This reminds me, I need to get back there soon."}
{"text":"My husband and I have eaten at Amber three times, each time with friends or family. Everyone loved it each time. As we walked in the door, the fragrance of fresh spices aroused our appetites and delighted our senses. The service was prompt and solicitous. The waiters explained the menu and allowed plenty of time to look over the extensive offerings and make a decision. Rather than the usual stars or peppers icons to indicate heat, the waiters use a zero-to-ten scale, which allows much more fine tuning, and the chef is very skilled at creating the dish with just the right amount of heat. The menu includes a greater variety of dishes than we have seen in other Indian restaurants, from various regions of India, Indonesia-China, and Goa. There is a long list of types of naan. Papadam, a crisp cracker-like, spiced bread, is brought to the table with the usual three chutneys- tamarind, tomato and onion, and cilantro-mint- all delicious. We usually do not order appetizers, but have had three at Amber. I could make a meal of the samosa chat- a thrill to taste! And the dosa 65 (?) was also delicious. The third was a tandoori paneer and came with grilled vegetables and a tikka masala- like sauce that was wonderful. So don't pass up the appetizers. The main dishes are superb also. The waiters are very attentive, but not intrusive, and are good about bringing take-home boxes when you request them. At the end of the meal, they each time have brought us a small helping of dessert, different each visit and all terrific. We did not order dessert and were not charged for it. The finale is steaming hot wet washcloths to wipe your fingers, very soothing. We did also try the chai, which was as excellent as everything else and not over sweetened, as it can be. If you like Indian food, you will love Amber. It's our favorite in Madison and maybe the best Indian food I have ever had anywhere."}
{"text":"This is the same team that used to run Minerva, so the food as usual is really good.  We were there for dinner, and they were busy, so it took a while to get seated and take our order.  Chilly Panner is excellent, the Mysore masala dosa was good.  Kids loved chicken 65 for appetizer and chicken tikka masala + naan for main course.  I had the Lamb Shahi Korma, the lamb was cooked well and the korma gravy was yummy.  For our dishes we had asked for Indian Hot for the heat level and we were not disappointed.  Overall they need to hire more folks/waiters to keep things moving. So food is good and service needs improvement."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, nice, comfortable atmosphere. Staff/service was very friendly and accommodating! Will definitely be my go to for Indian food in Madison!"}
{"text":"Service is poor. Food is average. We first ordered chicken hot and sour soup & chicken sweet corn soup but apparently there was no chicken in there. Chicken lollypop smelled like Shrimp. We ordered chicken hyderabadi curry with Naan and they served us chicken hyderabadi biryani with Naan instead. Not going back there again."}
{"text":"Also one of my favorites! Great atmosphere and friendly staffs. The food are nicely done with a Southern Indian tropical taste. I would strongly recommend this place to all Indian food lovers."}
{"text":"Good Indian restaurant in Madison, the variety of vegetarian options is exciting and different from other restaurants.. Lunch buffet has never disappointed me!"}
{"text":"This review is for dinner only.  The lunch buffet, is like all Indian buffets in Madison, bland and uninteresting.  Dinner, however, is a different matter.  The service is delightful, if a bit quirky at times.  The food is simply exquisite, full of flavor and spiced to order.    The samosas were crisp and flaky without a hint of grease, the chicken tikka masala was smoky with a creamy sauce tasting of wonderful spices and just the right amount of heat.  I cannot recommend Amber highly enough for a great dining experience."}
{"text":"My wife and had had lunch there other day. However, I have had a massive headache for the last 24 hours that started in the afternoon/evening after our lunch. I am very sensitive to additives(food color and MSG) in food/wine and get the same kind of allergic reaction and headache when I consume such. Nothing else changed in my diet or environment other than that lunch.  So, maybe management can address this issues for customers."}
{"text":"Service is a bit slow, but, food is good. I liked starters more than the main course."}
{"text":"At last a quality Indian restaurant in town ( no longer have to travel to Chicago for one) - Great curry - great service - great atmosphere - nice price. Try vindaloo xxxtra spicy!!!! Going back to try the buffet soon."}
{"text":"We were there last night with a large party, and we all loved it.  The host was gracious and the waitstaff attentive.  It's a very pleasant room, and the food was fabulous!  We'll go back again and again."}
{"text":"We have been regular customers of Amber since they opened, and prior to that at Minerva's. I gave a very good review here previously, but I have to amend my rating. Tonight was the second evening we've been in and had VERY POOR SERVICE, bordering on being totally ignored. Also the first time we've ever complained about any of the food.  After being seated, we waited 20 minutes to have our order taken.  We requested additional rice 3 times throughout the meal, and never got any until we were ready to leave. We had to wait for our check, we had to wait for the credit card to be returned. Several other tables of customers had been seated, served, and left before we got our check. The restaurant was nearly full while we were eating, and almost completely empty by the time we finally left - and not because we wanted to stay.  I often order the Egg Biryani, a dish I've enjoyed very much there in the past. The first time I had it there, it had 4 eggs in it, and was topped with whole cashews and raisins. Over time the number of eggs decreased, and tonight, the dish had less than one whole egg, no raisins and no cashews. Very disappointing. Basically rice with part of an egg.  In addition, 2 of us ordered the lentil soup, which we often have. And while it was tasty, it was about 1/2 a serving.  At several times throughout the meal one or more of us desperately needed water, but could not attract the attention of any waitstaff.   When I expressed to the man I think must be the owner my dissatisfaction with my entree, he made quite a show of promising to make me another, with all of the missing ingredients, to go. However, in spite of our extensive wait (it was probably 30-45 minutes from the time he said he would bring the replacement dish out until we left), it never appeared. Nor did we ever see him again.  I will probably give the restaurant one more try, but I've lost a good deal of my previous enthusiasm for going there."}
{"text":"Awesome food. We go every couple of weeks for take out as we have kids. Staff is super friendly. Food is best Indian in town."}
{"text":"This is by far the best and most authentic Indian restaurant in Madison.  They have a huge lunch buffet and the food tasted like it just came out of the kitchen and they have a very large dinner menu. We frequented their former restaurant Minerva, which was also very good.  But somehow the food seems to taste even better here.  The service is always wonderful and the people are incredibly welcoming.  Some of my favorite items: chicken madras, paneer manchurian, shahi paneer, dosas, mango lassi, and chai.  I'm excited to try all the different items on the menu that I have never had before!"}
{"text":"Tried Amber for the first time a few months ago, have come back a few times since then.  Always good food, friendly staff.  I wish they'd add shahi and palak paneer to their buffet though."}
{"text":"We heard about Amber through a coupon in the mail. We took our 1-year old with us for dinner. The staff were extremely friendly and accommodating. I had the chicken kashmir, which was phenomenal. The chicken tikka masala was good, although a bit spicy for this wimp! Generous portions, which is lacking in other Indian restaurants in the area. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Difference in quality of their food in buffet and a la carte is huge.   Dishes in buffet are bland, overcooked and they put huge quantity of soda in it. I went to buffet many times and its quality has deteriorated over time. Food stays there for hours and gets overcooked.   On other side if you order a la carte, food is amazing and the best in Madison. Their indo Chinese items are very good. All types of Biryanis are great.   Ambience is good."}
{"text":"Best Indian food!  I ordered the shrimp tikka masala which had amazing flavor with the Garlic naan. The mixed meat platter for appetizer was a great start and the mango ice cream was a delectable finish."}
{"text":"Indian buffett.....it's brilliant.  The food was tasty and fresh.  We went around 1pm on a Saturday and the place was packed.  Will definitely return.  Hope they keep up the good quality.....we need more variety/choices in Middleton."}
{"text":"Our order was to go, but still the portions were generous, and the dishes were delectable. When we visit Madison, we will definitely order again. My favorite was the Chicken Korma-just great."}
{"text":"Have visited several times for lunch buffet only--rating would be higher, but for terrible service. I waited to write feedback until after several experiences, in case I just came on a bad day.  No such luck.  Although previous visits were earlier in the day with more patrons, service issues were identical.     Workers and owner(?) checked out--going through the motions.  Host on cell phone for about 45 minutes and wordlessly seated us on most recent visit. At 1:30, there was a tablespoon of basmati rice left, and most of the entrees were gone or picked over.  No naan ever brought to table or refreshed at buffet, no dishes cleared, no water refills.  I finally made a point of picking up a water pitcher at a waiter station and helping myself. My companion placed our dirty dishes on another table so perhaps they would be cleared eventually.  The message was neither received nor acted upon.    We were not the last patrons to be seated, but the buffet food was never replenished,  including the sad, tiny soggy amount of mango ice cream left in the dessert tray.  Workers were having lively, at times loud and angry sounding, discussions. These discussions interfered with the competing decibel level of the Bollywood music videos on full blast on the huge flat screen TV--hard for diners to have table talk.  Pick one, please--Studio 54 or diner.   Amber has a lot of competition in terms of like restaurants in the area--but the other Indian buffets have a more welcoming staff and give wonderful service (and food).  By the way, I forgot to ask what the discount should be for 1/3 stocked buffet items."}
{"text":"Had a GREAT dinner at Amber tonight, as did my friend - plus very nice staff and decor.  We're eager to return!"}
{"text":"I came here with my wife on a friend's recommendation. We were starving when we entered so we directly ordered the Hyderabadi Chicken Dum Biryani for both of us. The food took unusually long time to arrive at the table, almost an hour. By this time we were famished. Thank god for the papad refills that the host served us. Ambience: Lighting was very dull. Host did not seem welcoming and interested at all. And whats with that tacky Music videos being streamed on that flat TV. Very distracting and my wife seemed to lose it whenever she saw the screen. Food: Rice well cooked, Chicken was well cooked but cannot say it was fresh. Did not taste all that good. Flavors were ok but I have had better biryanis in Madison. I am curious about the buffet though. So I am going for 3 stars with the hope that the next time I come for buffet, I won't be let down."}
{"text":"I've only been for the buffet, but seriously, it is a 5 star buffet. The offerings are numerous and offer plenty of different options for vegetarians and meat eaters alike. The garlic naan in particular takes the experience to a whole other level. If I'm ever craving Indian buffet, this is the first place I'm going."}
{"text":"Went to the lunch buffet after all the great reviews. Will not go back as there are many fine Indian Restaurants around, some close by. We were seated by a man who continued to  talk on his cellphone. No one asked if we wanted anything to drink. We were almost ready to go when my water glass was finally refilled.  The window sill needs cleaning, the place was looking rundown ( tears on the booth seats). The food was okay, just okay. A bit greasy. Something labeled chicken turned out to be fish. Large selection, but again, if I'm craving Indian I'll be elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great Indian food!   My whole family loves it.  Bala (one of the owners) is extremely friendly and helpful.    My wife is vegan and they have no trouble making a variety of dishes for her."}
{"text":"I've lived a lot of places and I'm not sure I've ever had Indian food that was this good! Their lunch Buffett is massive, and also offered on the weekends. It doesn't get much better than that! I think I've dreamt about their pander tikka masala. Really. And their garlic naan.  Just go try it!"}
{"text":"A friend highly recommended this restaurant for its fresh and authentic cuisine. So last night, we ordered a couple take-out dinners to try it. Unfortunately, our meals were just awful. Starting with the garlic naan and onion kulcha, both were greasy and off-tasting. The kulcha had grit in every bite, like the greens in it had not been thoroughly washed. The main courses were not much better. Tandoori chicken was over-cooked and dried out. It was tandoori spiced but we doubted that it was roasted in a tandoori oven as it lacked char. The chicken spinach tikka was overly salty and almost inedible. We threw out most of the food. This place has a great location and nice staff so I hope the food improves."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here tonight and it is our new favorite Indian place! I should mention that I am vegan and he is a vegetarian. We ordered the vegetable platter appetizer, and it had the BEST veggie pakoras I've ever had--such a good flavor and spice. The samosas were delicious too, and my husband really like the fried paneer. For dinner I ordered the Chana saag with Roti bread (without butter) and the waiter was very helpful in assuring me the curry didn't have dairy and suggesting I order the Roti w/o butter. My husband got the baingan bharta and rosemary naan, he said both were great. The chutneys were super tasty too. Overall a really really great option for Indian food on the west side!"}
{"text":"Amber Indian Cuisine was amazing! I was with a group of 3 adults and a newborn baby. We arrived around 1:30pm on a Sunday for their buffet. The place was busy but we were seated right away. We requested a booth and that's where we were seated. The food was fresh and very delicious. The selection was very broad and there were tons of great South Indian dishes to choose from. The chicken 65 was great and so were the desserts. We all tried a variety of dishes and none were bad. The naan was also fresh and the waiters kept our baskets full. When we paid our bill at the front, the owner was there and was very friendly. I would definitely recommend this restaurant. Finally a good, clean Indian spot in Madtown!"}
{"text":"We just had an excellent meal here.  The Chef's Special Naan was very good.  I had chicken Kashmiri which was outstanding--I can't say enough good things about it. My husband had beef voladoori (this is misspelled) and he thought it was very good too. The service was great and we will definitely return."}
{"text":"Ambience is very good for an Indian restaurant. The chicken biryani was good. Didn't like the goat biryani."}
{"text":"We started coming here on occasion about a year ago and absolutely love our food every time we come. I have some adventurous eaters in my family and some not so adventurous eaters and all are able to find something to enjoy.  Tonight I feel I can safely say that in general, the service is slow - friendly, but slow, and occasionally you are downright ignored for a while. There are little moments here and there that help to make up for it (hot towels at the end of the meal, occasional complementary mango smoothies, etc), and frankly, the food is worth it as long as you have the time.  I really like their vegetable samosas - perfect heat. I wish I could make basmati like these folks do. Every grain is buttery and perfectly cooked; how do they DO that? Masala sauce is consistently delicious; velvety and perfectly seasoned. I don't see a difference at all between mild and medium. Tonight my daughter tried the coconut soup and says \"oh my gosh, is this delicious.\" She's also a huge fan of the dosa and the various chutneys it is served with. Our family easily finishes three orders of garlic naan without batting an eye. We've tried tandoori shrimp and chicken biryani - I remember the biryani to be just a bit dry, perhaps like it had been pre-cooked, and haven't ordered it since, but wouldn't mind trying again some day.  In general the decor and comfort of the booth seating leaves a bit to be desired; they could use a big overhaul, including the restrooms. Nice beer and wine selection. Simply put, the food is why I keep coming back."}
{"text":"Just finished our lunch buffet at Amber Indian cuisine.The food is very similar to other Indian restaurants in town like swagath/maharani.But if you are a big  fan of hyderabadi chicken biryani , I bet you will be frequenting this place.Please note that this restaurant is started by same guy who started Minerva few years ago...  Taste :  What's good:  1)Hyderabadi dum biryani 2)Ghee pongal 3)Hakka noodles 4)Paneer butter masala 5)Naans 6)dosas 7)upma 8)veg cutlet  What's not so great (average) Chicken 65 Chilly chicken Fruit custard dessert  What's very bad: Tandoori chicken-disappointing  Chicken lollipops Gobi manchurian Fish fry-awful  Ambience and atmosphere :  Very good. Definitely better than most of the other Indian restaurants..  Management : Could  see 3 / 4 waiting staff .But they seem to be caught up in Sunday afternoon rush hour..Took around 15 -20 mins to get a high-chair for the guests in our next table.   Cleanliness: Well , it's better than Minerva but there is scope for improvement with silverware on the table  Final verdict: Definitely worth a visit if you are a hardcore dum biryani fan or a South Indian crazy about pongal dosas etc.."}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant in Madison, regardless of cuisine. From the food to the staff, this place is first-class top to bottom."}
{"text":"My favorite Indian place in Madison! The service is always so friendly, and the Gobi 65 and Paneer Tikka Masala are to DIE for! Plus, complimentary dessert and hot towels for their loyal customers. Definitely worth it."}
{"text":"This place is lovely. The staff are super friendly, the decor is nice, and the food is delicious. They even gave us hot towels to wash our hands with after we finished eating."}
{"text":"First time for dinner. Have enjoyed lunch here before. Their dinner food & service are excellent."}
{"text":"one of the better indian buffets in the madison area. larger selection of food and ample seating. The dishes are comparable in taste to the other indian buffets. Pretty much the typical indian buffet dishes... just a larger selection. ive never been here for dinner just the lunch bufffet..."}
{"text":"We are so excited to have such a great Indian restaurant nearby in Middleton. Way exceeded our expectations and the lunch buffet is highly recommended. Some of the best we have had both here and in Chicago....highly recommend."}
{"text":"1 star for the service. It took so long for the wait staff to take our order. It took equally long for anyone to pay attention to see what we want during our course of the meal. It took even more to get our check. Food wasn't bad but sure not going back for the service they provide. It wasn't worth it"}
{"text":"Very, very good, first time eating Indian food,  not a big fan of buffet style.  Service was great."}
{"text":"A big disappointed!  Tried schezwan chicken with gravy, schezwan rice, chapli kebab and bhuna ghosht...tasteless!! Chapli kebab are as thin a paper...and even close to real chapli kebab.  Bhuna ghosht with lot of fat.  And let's talk about service. So very slow. Got appetizer after 20 mins and meal after 1 hour. And they forgot to serve cold drinks."}
{"text":"I've been here four other times since the opening and have enjoyed the lunch buffet. At the most recent visit, the desserts were off as the gulab jamun was overly soaked in the syrup and too sweet for my tastebuds. I usually can eat two of these sweet dough balls but not that day. Also, the homemade mango ice cream had a lot of ice crystals in it. The fish fry had some cold pieces and the chicken vegetable soup,  we think,  was labeled wrong. It was a dark brown broth that tasted strangely like watered down soy sauce. Perhaps it was because we arrived right at the beginning of the work lunch crowd on a Monday?   What can I say,  I have a sweet tooth and sometimes that makes or breaks my experience. I'd definitely  go back but I won't be counting on the desserts."}
{"text":"I recently went there for dinner with my wife. I have also had lunch there. The quality of North Indian food is good but South Indian food's taste is really bad. The service they provide to Indians is very bad. During lunch, they delay bringing the Naans and prioritize white people first. During dinner, they don't ask Indians for any drinks and don't bring wet towel for them. I am not going to this restaurant again until they learn how to treat all customers equally."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. We had a party of 5 for dinner, ages ranging 11 to 54, no one familiar with Indian food. I talked them into trying Amber because of the great reviews, and all agreed it was wonderful. Sorry I forget the exact dishes, but we had goat, chicken, fish, beef, and garlic naan. We agreed that before we leave town we must hit the lunch buffet so that we can each try a  variety of dishes. The owner (I believe) was very cordial, and came over to chat a couple of times. Overall a terrific experience that I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Chicken byrani... no need to say more.... the servers and the food need no other praise except amazing!"}
{"text":"I eat a lot of homecooked desi food and have spoiled myself with Devon in Chicago so this was disappointing. Didn't finish because the amount of oils used were upsetting my stomach."}
{"text":"Worst service you can possibly find. Even after reminding to bring food 3 times, there is no sign of it. There are other Indian places with much better service and food. Never coming back"}
{"text":"I usually avoid Indian buffets because of their greasiness, low quality, and stale food.  However, my Indian colleagues convinced me to give Amber a try.   Let me start by saying that this is not your typical Indian buffet: the selection is huge, the dishes are unique, and the quality is above the bar. The waiters are there for you and bring you as much freshly baked naan as you want, and it's good naan. I really recommend trying their various curries.  I think this is not a great place for foodies, but it's probably the best indian food you can get in Madison and the price is nice."}
{"text":"I had to give Amber a try because my friend had been talking about how great their Hyderabadi chicken briyani is. Usually, when one has high expectations, it is easy to be disappointed. But, Amber's Hyderabadi chicken briyani definitely didn't let me down, so I'm giving Amber 5 stars just for this dish. It is a huge yummy serving, beautifully presented with onions and half a hard boiled egg. The chicken (with bone) was so tender and flavorful. I had the medium (spicy-level) and it was just right. It was served with the refreshing yogurt sauce (raita), which made the dish even more delicious. And, as a bonus- the leftovers were so good the next day and the day after (huge portions!!).  Another friend tried the lamb briyani and he like it too. We also asked for some spicy sauce, and our server brought out a mild, coconut based sauce and it was delicious!   One of the things I look forward to is the papadams, unfortunately there was a basket of papadams already on the table when we got there, and it was rather soggy :(  Service wise, we had a very pleasant, relaxing, and happy dining experience. I'll be very happy to dine at Amber again."}
{"text":"This place is awesome they have the best buffet spread hands down in Madison.  service is excellent!! Food is flavorful and they have many choices to choose from p. This place is definitely a come back to visit restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for the lunch buffet and was blown away. The ambiance is beautiful. The staff friendly. The food is visually pleasing and tastes amazing. Huge variety of choices. You can't beat the price, 10.99 for lunch Buffett. You can barely eat fast food for that price anymore. By far the best Indian food buffet I have ever had."}
{"text":"Went to the lunch buffet after the gym on a Saturday. The reviewers who are saying it's the best lunch buffet ever are completely right, the buffet is awesome! There is a ton of variety, my husband was impressed that their chili chicken was even good.   100% going back and I will probably be back every single weekend from now on.  My one complaint is that we had to work pretty hard to catch someone several times to get more water. Either be more attentive with the water or leave bigger parties with a pitcher or something! Other than that, service wasn't terrible or anything."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Knocking myself on the head for not visiting sooner. Amber takes the place of the China Wok restaurant which inhabited the space for many years out in Middleton on University Avenue.  I believe I have been to most of the Indian restaurant buffets in the area and this ties for my favorite.    First, to be sure, I do not consider myself an Indian food connoisseur.  Yet I have been to enough to know what I like and that which I do not believe has been thoughtfully prepared.   I apologize that I did not take any notes on what I enjoyed during my visit to share with you here. I did not recognize many of the dishes. But I do know they had three varieties of biryani, vegetarian included. They had a grilled shrimp and grilled fish dishes and a fantastic stewed beef dish. I promise that the next time I go I will take good notes so I can report back to you.  On this visit, I was so hungry and so entranced by the variety, clean and well laid out buffet stations that I simply could not pay attention. All I could do was eat.   At our Friday lunch, they had three main buffet lines with one devoted exclusively to desserts and chutneys.  Awesome sauce.  Perhaps it is a different style of Indian food or from a different region, but I did not notice any samosas or more then one variety of naan bread. Not that I was complaining since the wide selection of other items - - many mysterious yet delicious looking - - captivated me.  The staff was very kind and unassuming.  The space is well lit and warm.  The back seating area is somewhat cramped. Note--those with any mobility challenges may have a little difficulty maneuvering in that area.   Again, I apologize for the lack of detail here. But, at the least, I do highly recommend a visit, especially for the weekday lunch buffet. Definitely more to follow.  ----- Oops, I did it again.  I couldn't resist and had to return to Amber Indian Cuisine for their lunch buffet today. And just like the last time, I was overwhelmed by the sheer awesomeness of their buffet and was totally unable to take any notes of what they offered and what I had.  My apologies.  On this visit, they had a few new items. Today, their spinach and corn dish included green beans, too. They also had a delicious cheese puffed pastry dish. Return menu items included their grilled shrimp and fish dishes and chicken hyderabad biryani. Same awesomeness.  We had a few cups of chai and a round of mango lassis. All most excellent.  As before, well lit, clean, kind and professional waitstaff.  The restaurant was fairly crowded and it looked like the staff welcome and handle everyone very well. Happy faces abounded.  It also appears that they have a room in the back for private parties.   As an aside, we took our 20 and 15-year-olds along, who also love Indian food. They agree with their old man about Amber's awesomeness. Totally. (Or whatever it is that the young people say nowadays).   If the last few hours are any testament to my lunch experience, please consider them.  I was so satiated that when paying, I totally forgot to use a coupon we had found which is quite contrary to my frugal nature. Also, I had to return home suffering a 3.5 hour food coma from which I just awoke.   In short, Amber's caused me to lose my mind and my consciousness. A successful outing in my book.    Say, what's for dinner?  ----- Another update for this great restaurant.  They have moved the tables around a little to make access to and from them a little easier for their mobility challenged guests. I think that was very thoughtful and give them a lot of credit and thanks for that sensitivity.   Oh, and as it has been since my first visit, the food was awesome and fresh; service, polite and  genteel. Of particular note today, cabbage fritters! Crunchy and sublime.    See you there!  ------ Yet another update for one of our favorite spots in Madison.  Stopped in for dinner tonight around 6 PM and had the vegetarian dinner for two.  We really enjoyed it. The special includes samosas, naan bread, rice, your choice of one of their many vegetarian paneers, your choice of two of their many vegetarian curries, and desserts for two.   For our selections, we chose the tomato and butter paneer, the eggplant curry, and fried okra. For dessert, mango ice cream and kheer. We also ordered the chef's special naan bread which was filled with cheese, onions, garlic and other spices.  As with their buffet items, all of our dinner items were very good and served hot and nicely plated. We had enough for leftovers, partially because of the complementary lentil cracker/bread they serve along with a trio of chutneys.    Our vegetarian dinner for two provided such a nice variety in the right quantities and for a modest $35, exclusive of tax and tip.  It gets better though.  They bring hot towels to your table after your meal for your use. So nice, cleansing and comforting.   As always, service was great and genteel. Thank you, Amber!"}
{"text":"There's been a lot of new Indian places open in the area and this is the best of them all. The owner is a gracious and authentically nice person who seems to put his stamp on the feel of the place.  The food has all the typical dishes, but there are many things I do not recognize and will hope to expand my horizons there.  Everything I have had in my 5 visits has been fantastic. I tend to prefer curries and masala, and I like that I can amp up the heat level if I choose.  While I prefer the dinner menu, the lunch buffet may be biggest and best in Madison.  Again, they have the standards but there is usually a few surprises.  Give the place a chance, it may not look like much from the road, but it is wonderful on the inside."}
{"text":"My wife and I had a really wonderful time at Amber. The food (veggie samosas, lamb curry, chicken shahi korma and vegetable biryani) was delicious and served in generous portions. The service was genuine and friendly (though at times a bit distracted). We'll be going back for sure."}
{"text":"Great food, nice atmosphere, everyone is kind and like to make you feel important. Will definitely go there again"}
{"text":"From the lakes of Monona/ to the hills of Blue Mounds/ Across the plains of Stoughton/ From goat curry to shimmering garlic naan/  I'm proud to be an Madisonian, where at least I know the best Indian lunch buffet is AMBER.   Great selection: 10-15 curry/hot dishes, 3 pakora, salad, 3 soups, 3-4 chicken type things, and a bunch more. Things tasted good and fresh and it is only about $10."}
{"text":"Delicious food, interesting options (gongura!), excellent service.   We were part of a large group and they didn't have any trouble accommodating a huge order and a lot of different requests.   A hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Haven't reviewed  this place for a while and though it time. The food is still great but the service was terrible this noontime visit. It was a day off for four of us so we had some beer. Had to order it twice  for the two beers and the soft drink was completely forgotten. Our used plates were building up with no one around to remove them. There was waitstaff around and it wasn't busy so it was a mystery why this wasn't done. None of the help ever made eye contact with us and it was like we were invisible! Not a good experience. Very disappointed that they don't value their customers more."}
{"text":"Best Indian food I've tried in Madison. The taste is great. Starting with great delicious Mango Lassi. Lamb Kormer and Chicken Tandori were superb. Their garlic nan was so spot on, cannot stop eating them!  Highly recommend if you crave for some Indian Cuisine delights. It's good service, and very reasonably priced. Although I have to say, when I visited with a big group of 20+ people, the service become fairly messy. I would recommend small party visits (2-4). There's plenty of parking shared with other business with the parking lot. If you use apple maps, you might get lost ..... try to use google maps instead!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant.   The staff is kind and friendly.   The lunch buffet is fresh and delicious. The best selection in Madison for Indian buffet.   The dinner menu is extensive and the owner is not afraid to make it spicy for you if you ask. I typically ask for it xxx spicy, and the server brought out deep fried Serrano peppers as an appetizer on the house. How awesome is that!  Enjoy my friends, the dopest dope you've ever smoked."}
{"text":"This is a great Indian buffet for lunch.  Way too many delicious choices.  Lots of bread, chutneys,  soups,  vegetarian and meat dishes.  We drove all the way from Milwaukee just to try the lunch buffet and it did not disappoint.   I have also been hear for dinner and found it to really good food."}
{"text":"Remains the premier Indian restaurant in Madison. Try the Mango Chicken - tender pieces of chicken in a savory, sweet mango sauce. Outstanding. The Baingan Bharta - roasted (or grilled) mashed eggplant cooked with tomato, onion, green chiles, and spices - eatten with rice or Naan bread is Indian comfort food at its best. A definite \"must try\"."}
{"text":"A great new place in Middleton! More choices than a typical Indian buffet and very good quality food. Attentive, friendly service and reasonably priced. It doesn't look like much from the outside but don't let that fool you. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I've been to quite a few Indian Restaurants in Madison and I have to say that Amber is top on my list, if not the best. Heard about this place from a colleague and thought I'd try it, I was definitely not disappointed. They have quite a selection for their lunch buffet. The best dish is their shrimp dish. It is so flavorful and oh so delicious! All of their other items are very good, as well. I will definitely go again."}
{"text":"Compared to other Indian buffets in Madison, this one has the greatest selection, which is great whether your veggie, meat or seafood person. I especially liked the Goat, very tender. Quality is great, the meat doesn't taste dry or like it's been sitting there awhile which can be a problem for buffets. Service was friendly and there was always someone walking around refilling water.   Totally worth the value for the lunch buffet!"}
{"text":"Not a bad Indian buffet, all things considered. Compared to the several others in the area - Minerva's, Dhaba, Kangchen, Swagat - it's above average. I think they excel most in variety, with the second-largest selection of options within the list I provided, as well as having a good proportion of non-vegetarian options. They have some of my favorite desserts - kheer and gulab jamun - and their mango lassi doesn't taste too sweet or artificial.  However, I must confess that Swagat does out-do Amber in terms of flavor. With a similarly large selection of options, Swagat's dishes are a bit more potently spiced. When I have Indian food, I should be able to barely handle the intensity and complexity of the spice. At Amber, I don't think I particularly noted the spice. So I guess come here if you're particularly afraid of spice? But then why would you be at an Indian restaurant if you didn't want intense flavors..."}
{"text":"Oh, Amber, how I love you so.  Your lunch buffet stands alone on the mountaintop of lunch buffets, looking down on the inferior buffets with their lack of variety and mass-produced blandness.  Seriously, though, this place is great.  I've only ever eaten there for lunch buffet, but in half a dozen trips, I've sampled most of what they have to offer.  I might have a minor quibble here and there with a dish, but the quality is consistently excellent.  The staff is hilariously nice to my daughter, which I always appreciate.  The mango lassis are delightful.  If I had to pick one thing to complain about, the suspense about whether there will be gajar halwa on the buffet is nerve-wracking.  When there isn't, it's so disappointing.  This probably isn't very adventurous of me to say, but the consistent execution of a good chicken tikka masala is usually my barometer of buffet quality, even though it's not my favorite Indian dish.  The CTM at Amber always gets it right.    I haven't been to another Indian place since Amber opened, and I don't know that I would voluntarily go back to other places in town as long as this is an option.  It also doesn't hurt that it's right near I'm Board..."}
{"text":"Amber is undoubtedly one of the best Indian restaurants in Madison. What sets them apart is their high quality and well prepared proteins-choices of white or dark chicken, tender lamb, fresh paneer, and great tandoori chicken. The veggie dishes are stellar as well, always packing a punch of flavor and a different assortment of vegetables than most Indian places. The dinners for two are a great deal!"}
{"text":"I went for the buffet at lunch. The food was okay, I'd rather go to Swagat. I think it was the quality of the cooking that turned me off. The food wasn't very flavorful and kind of soggy. When the best thing you eat is the Nann...I guess when there are so many Indian restaurants around, you can choose what you like best. However, I do think that if you want the best Indian food, befriend an Indian family and have them cook for you; otherwise you will never eat the best Indian food out there."}
{"text":"I seriously never had Indian food this good except when I visited India! Although the place is simple it offers all what I love about Indian cuisine: their vegetable pakora are to die for, their garlic naan is delicious and their chicken tikka masala is cooked to perfection. I love that this close is open 7-days a week, and their well packed lunch buffet is also available during the weekend.  This is my go to place when I don't know what to cook and I am craving Indian food. The flavors are off the chart."}
{"text":"We sampled the mixed grill and the ubiquitous Chicken Tikki Marsala. We also had an order of garlic naan. Everything was really really good. The  service was fantastic. As we left the host who may have been the owner was incredibly gracious and kind to my father and I as we left - thanking us for visiting his restaurant and asking us how everything was... inviting us to come back soon.   I'm very happy to have Amber in the neighborhood. After many years this part of Middleton is beginning to feel like a real neighborhood again with proper local amenities.   Check out the ample menu and great service at Amber. I think you'll be happy with your experience."}
{"text":"Delicious food and happy prompt service.  The lunch buffet is reasonably priced and has quite the variety."}
{"text":"So so so SO good!! I ate so much when I came here that I couldn't eat anymore for the rest of the day, which is super rare for me! I went on a Sunday afternoon, about 1.30 and although the place was pretty full, I didn't have to wait for a table at all.   They have a great selection of meat and vegetarian - friendly dishes, their Naan bread is fantastic, and service was wonderful. Must make room for their Mango ice cream type dessert!!!   They also have a student discount, so be sure to ask about that if you're a student!"}
{"text":"Best place for indian food in madison /middleton!!Full points for ambience, variety of cuisine and taste! There is customer satisfaction and then there is customer delight and amber is definitely a delight! We came here for lunch buffet and we were delighted. A must try !"}
{"text":"We came searching for some Indian food since our parents were craving some after 2 days at the resort in Dells. We got here closer to 2pm just half hour before they close the buffet and most of the dishes looked wiped out. The management was polite to refill the food which was a nice gesture. ...the food was pretty decent with a lot of variety and at least 3 desserts for a standard weekday buffet. Overall a good experience, the bathrooms etc need a facelift."}
{"text":"PROS: Solid Indian food at very reasonable prices, impeccable service CONS: ?  One of the better Indian lunch buffets in Madison, for sure! They have a great variety of curries with both vegetarian, meat, and seafood options, and everything was pretty good. The restaurant was also very well-kept and the service was great. Overall, I'm not much of a buffet person, but I would return when the mood strikes."}
{"text":"\"Double visit\": first & last.... We order Rosemary naan. It's come \"plan\" We order lamb.....it was chicken  Guys - it doesn't work like that Sorry but we will not be back here.  There are better ( much better) Indian restaurants in Madison."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed visiting Amber. Their lunch buffet was flavorful, with a great mix of things I wanted (expected) to see, such as chicken tikka masala and lamb curry, with items new to me. The spice level was enough to provide a little heat and good taste, but nothing too powerful.   The three buffet bars are arranged with one containing salad, sauces, and desserts; a second for vegetarian dishes; and a third for the meat items, with an additional platter of grilled fish (tasty!). The meat variety was one beef dish, one lamb, and most everything else was chicken. Plus, there were two kinds of rice, regular and one with veggies, as well as a chicken biryani. Everything was helpfully labeled, a plus for someone like me who doesn't eat a lot of different Indian dishes. As well, they brought bread (plain naan) to our table while we were visiting the buffet.   My favorite item were the little samosas. By making them smaller than the fist-sized served most places, they were easy to fit into a buffet plate, and they were the tastiest I've ever had, with creamy potato and pea filling. I was also surprised at how much I enjoyed the paneer masala; normally, I prefer the chicken version, but the cheese and sauce were so yummy!   The service was friendly and welcoming without being intrusive. The decor is standard, nothing special, but the chairs were comfy. The biggest problem, which they were already addressing by the time we left, was that the rug in the entryway was blocking the door from fully closing, so the room got pretty cold. It's an easy fix.   I'm curious to come back and see how much the choices vary from visit to visit. Many of the items here I felt were standards, the kinds of things visitors expect to see from an Indian restaurant, so I'm wondering how many dishes are swapped out. Price was reasonable, under $12 (with drinking water) for a very filling lunch. You can also order ala carte at lunch; dinner is ala carte only. According to their menu, all meats are halal."}
{"text":"They're going to have to crank up the taste to crank up my rating.  Large selection at the lunch buffet, but nothing unique, and with Dhaba, Swagat, and Kangchen nearby they'll need to upgrade the quality of the food to compete.  On the plus side, we heard both Black Sabbath and Jane's Addiction on the playlist."}
{"text":"Super delicious! Garlic naan is not to be missed. My favorite dish is the lamb pasanda. Yum!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food and service. I have beeb to this restaurant twice. One for lunch buffet on a Sunday and next time for dinner. The food is amazing for the price and the people are extremely friendly. Best for Indian students around the campus. Go give it a try, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Best Indian restaurant I have ever had. The staff are very very good and the owner is awesome. Have been here a couple times and Amber consistently does a perfect job. I like my vindaloos very very very very very very spicy, and the owner made sure to produce a chicken vindaloo that was very very very very very very spicy.  I came here for my birthday because of how much I love this place.  If you like Indian and live in Madison, you have to come and try Amber because you will find yourself ditching all of the other Indians in the area and coming here."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE TO EAT! If I could give no stars I would. Went there for dinner on a Monday night, not too crowded. Took 10 min to get someone to order the food. After that waited 40 min and no food! I ordered Naan with the food and they brought it out as an appetizer!! Naan is not an appetizer! You would think an Indian brother would get better service, but in traditional fashion they treat their own worse! I ordered a beer, presumably to have with dinner to help wash my palate between bites. Finished it. Told them we had to go and they did not even apologize for the wait. Then they made me pay for the Beer!!! Do not go here for dinner. The buffet may be good, but the service stinks!!"}
{"text":"You MUST try the lunch buffet. For real. No joke. It'll be the best (and most rewarding) $11 you spend all day and goes until 3pm.   Awesome buttered and garlic naan, grilled shrimp, chicken tikka masala and delicious desserts and chutneys. Very fresh and flavorful--quite unlike most buffets.   The service may be underwhelming but honestly you won't notice because the food will be so enjoyable. Plus they have Bollywood music videos playing to make up for it."}
{"text":"I come out to Middleton to eat here. I live in Fitchburg, so this is saying something. It's important to note that I still love Haveli, and there's something comforting about people knowing your name.   Amber stands out because of the variety of foods that they offer on their lunch buffet. It changes throughout the week as well, so you're bound to have a different expierence each day of the week.   When they have them up, their cute little samosas are so tasty, and did I mention are adorable? They're practically bite size. Their spinach pakora is great. It's salty somehow without tasting like a salt lick. Paneer masala is out of this world, and I'm pretty sure they make the paneer in house. I also really like the chicken biryani. I hadn't had it before here and kind of fell in love. They're also constantly refreshing the naan.   The staff here are so friendly and are super prompt with water or whatever beverage you may order.   Weekday lunch buffet is totally worth it at $12.61 (with tax)"}
{"text":"Love the buffet, lots of vegetarian options! Also great for takeout. They also have a student discount!"}
{"text":"I stopped in at Amber for a Sunday lunch with my wife and our two children (aged 4 and 1). We frequently drop in at I'm Board next door and knew Amber was replacing the Chinese buffet that used to be in the location. They've done a nice job fixing up the space but few major changes were evident (not that they were necessarily needed...). Overall we had a nice meal, but very little stood out significantly from many of the other Indian buffet options in town. I will say that the variety of options was quite broad but in general all the dishes were light on distinctly Indian flavors and they were all lacking spice. Now, I get it, you're a buffet in Wisconsin and have to largely cater to local tastes but that doesn't mean sacrificing everything that makes your cuisine distinctive and delicious.   A few stand outs worth mentioning:   Fried tintura (ivy gourd). This was a totally new dish to me and it was DELICIOUS! This was probably the best seasoned and spiciest dish I had. The texture was slightly crunchy and had a great toothsome chew. Surprise win of the day!  Chana Masala. A slightly sweeter recipe than some others I've had but still a great depth of flavors and the garbanzo beans had an excellent texture.   Naan. Okay, pretty much all naan is delicious and here there were three different variations. Plain naan was served at the table and was charred nicely. Garlic naan was on the buffet and was perfect for soaking up sauces. The real surprise of the trio was a deep fried naan that I'd never run into before. I didn't catch the name of the dish but it was GREAT!  There were MANY other options and everything I tried was at least okay but nothing else was particularly noteworthy. For instance, the chicken tikka masala was fine but very much on the bland side. Similar story with the tandoori chicken, veggie pakora, samosas, biryanis, etc.   Amber has every opportunity to be the stand out winner for Indian buffets in Madison, but in order to do so they'd have to takes some risks, spice up their dishes, and risk scaring off a few folks. I honestly don't know which route is the better business, but I know which one is rather frequent."}
{"text":"I've been to the lunch buffet (11:30-3:00) at Amber a few times, and it's consistently delicious. It's under $12 for all-you-can-eat, and this would be a great way to taste different dishes if you're new to Indian food, or to sample a bunch of your favorites if you like many of the different plates here! You basically walk in, get your plate, go to town, and then pay at the end. Can't get easier than that!  One thing that I enjoy about Indian restaurants in general, and about this lunch buffet, is that it is very adaptable to different tastes and dietary options like vegetarianism. You can fill your plate up with mostly veggies, or load up on fried foods, or skip mains and go straight to dessert... It's up to you! The dishes offered in the buffet are mostly not spicy... With the exception of one of the soups (the non-lentil one), which I find super taste but I always end up coughing from the spice level! The lentil soup is a nice non-spicy option if that's more your cup of tea.  There is a great selection of meats offered, so you can decide to try all of them in one time, or convince yourself that you'll be back so you don't need to try all of them. I usually do the former! It wouldn't be a true buffet if you didn't feel like you needed your stretchy pants, right?! There are also a couple classic desserts (gulab jamun and the rice pudding) so you really get a full meal. Mmm.  Writing about this is seriously making me want to head over to Amber right now!"}
{"text":"Very family-friendly with plenty of food that our one year old loved. The staff also brought him special treats to enjoy. We were on our way to an event downtown and didn't have much time, so we really enjoyed the extensive buffet with fresh, hot food."}
{"text":"Best Indian restaurant in Madison. Ive been to different places but its incomparable. Their food is amazing and authentic."}
{"text":"An Indian restaurant that is not to spicy or too flavorful with too many spices. The price is reasonable, and they have A LOT of choices from their menu."}
{"text":"Stopped in while on a conference call. Had to eat. Saw they had a buffet and it was Indian (like me). The buffet was quite good. Spicy and great smells. They had curry lamb, chicken and tandoori as well. Good naan and basmati as well. Nice job."}
{"text":"For a few years now I've lived in Madison and thought Swagat was the best in town. Now I'm not so sure. I don't think I can actually decide. This place is excellent as well. I've decided I will alternate buffets, because both are great, and competition is a good thing, so I'd like to help keep both in business. The food is delicious, with a huge selection for the buffet, and (I assume who is) the owner is very welcoming and makes you feel as though he is honored to have you as a guest in his restaurant."}
{"text":"Huge selection on the buffet. Clean and nice atmosphere. Staff friendly but a wait on drink refills. Food was bland and mostly all tasted the same. No heat. Seemed very \"Americanized\". A lot of labels were handwritten with a thick marker and I couldn't read it. I would suggest Haldi off Mineral Point Rd. (see my review for details)."}
{"text":"Food tastes good but always leaves me and my husband with a bloated feel. Not sure if they add something like baking soda in their buffet food"}
{"text":"Amber's claim to fame is definitely their lunch buffet. For a weekday lunch they have a lot of choice and very good food. At around $12 it is very reasonable on the pocket too. I would recommend that your first trip to amber be for their lunch buffet to get a feel of what you like or don't like.   If you decide to go a la carte, it can be a hit or miss. I tried a bunch of items on various visit. As a rule of thumb, the South Indian food (dosa's, avial curry, etc.) is good and stay away from the info Chinese food. For example - Stay away from mushroom chilly Manchurian. They were some very big pieces with the batter kind of leaving a weird after taste.   That said, their a la carte quantities are quite generous. A usual rice and gravy can easily have left overs for another meal.   Another option to sample a variety of dishes is their combination dinner for two. Again there was enough left over for both of us for another meal.   Pay cash if you can. They don't tell you this, but they charge a 4% convenience fee on card transactions.   Someone commented about the songs on TV. Well, that is Indian entertainment for you. These are song and dance numbers from Indian movies and is the way we roll. If you don't like it, consider Dhaba a little further down the road."}
