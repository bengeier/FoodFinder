{"text":"Absolutely delicious Mexican tamales!!  All 4 flavors were incredible.  Living in LA and at times Mexico, I know a good authentic tamale and this is definitely it."}
{"text":"Tamales are good but ambience inside is nil. No options for toppings or salsa. TONS of people coming and going. Tamales are good and have good amount of meat. We brought home tamales and will pick up salsa from Ranch Market..."}
{"text":"They have terrible customer service, specially with their walk-ins. They will Not sell any single orders right now, so save your trip going over there. You have to pre order 2-3weeks in advance. I went there to taste them with my daughter so I could see how good they were before I ordered them. However, I practically had to beg them for 2-3 tamales to buy and eat right there since I had driven all the way from Chandler, but the greedy manager only gave us 1.  They took the menu down and wouldn't sell to anyone. I wouldn't have ordered from them anyway, they were very undercooked and lacked flavor (good thing I got to try them). They were all in such a rush to make them, I guess. I did order mine from a Phoenix place, but just a bit more expensive and lthey were more delicious. To the people who don't know, if you do preorder and don't pick up in time they will sell them to someone else.  They are rude over the phone if they answer, but when I was there they were just letting it ring and ring. How are the customers going to make changes to their orders or know that they're not accepting walk ins if they don't answer the phone!!!"}
{"text":"Visiting from Heyworth Ill. Delicious tamales and mexicano plates. Had tamale eggs rice and beans. Will be back."}
{"text":"These are the best tamales in Mesa.  Delicious food, friendly quick service, and great prices.  I pick up the tamales to go but you can eat them there just as well. Take some home and put them in the freezer.  You'll never be at a loss if you have unexpected company for dinner. Judith"}
{"text":"Tamales are my Kryptonite. If I find good tamales, I get weak and can't help myself.  I read the reviews and well, to be honest, IT WAS INCREDIBLE! I highly recommend this place. The owner told me that if Duncan Donuts only sells donuts, they only sell Tamales at Old El Paso and that is why they are so good. The masa is firm and smooth. The fillings are great. Besides beef, chicken, and pork, they also have a sweet corn and cheese and on request jalapeno and cheese and zucchini and cheese vegetarian. I want them all. When I told him that I read about this store on-line, let me try several of the tamales. EAT HERE! If you don't like tamales, eat here and you will!  GREAT! I can't say enough. Yelp should add another star so that I can give them 6!"}
{"text":"Very good tamales. They're usually pretty quick if you just showing up. You can also place an order over the phone for larger orders and they'll have it ready. Great during the holidays or events. One of the better tamale locations in the valley. Also probably one of the cheapest. It is in a questionable location, but if you look beyond that the food is worth it. So if you like tamales go check it out."}
{"text":"Disappointed!!!! This place used to be a great value for the price, I used to get a 3 tamale combo for 5.49, as of November 1st it is now 7.49 for a 2 tamale combo...the place is not in the nicest of neighborhoods, always some sort of questionable individual out front, but I didn't mind, good food, good value. However now with the 2 dollar increase with less food, I wont waste my time, I can find a better value without being subjected to meth heads."}
{"text":"Great tamales!  But if you really want to taste a true Mexican burrito try their chile verde burrito, It is AMAZING!  Our office and all our staff loves this place! Check it out when you get a chance, its worth it."}
{"text":"This place has the best tamales.  Always fresh, flavorful masa, tender meat.  They've also started making some interesting tamales, and the spinach one I had two weeks ago was delish!!! The menudo on the weekends is delicious as well,  and you can get white or red, depending on what you like.    This is definitely a \"locals\" place.  That means that there are certain quirks that I'm willing to accept as a trade-off for the quality tamales I drive out of my way to buy.  These trade-offs are:  1.  The place is closed on Mondays.  It's a mom and pop restaurant, not a chain, so I get that they need at least one day off, so I adjust accordingly.  2.  If you need a big order of tamales, you HAVE to call ahead.  Like, call the day before.  As I said, it's a mom and pop.  Small staff, small kitchen, and everything is handmade.  3.  Yeah, sometimes the people aren't very talkative.  I assume it's because most of them are ESL'ers.  I speak Spanish, so I've never had a problem.    I'm a foodie.  I mostly care about what my food tastes like, so on that point alone, Old El Paso can't be beat.  If you like tamales, you won't find a place that makes them better."}
{"text":"Ive been coming here for a while but I just had the worst experience never going back, the tamales were under cooked it was disgusting"}
{"text":"Based upon all the positive reviews (OBVIOUSLY RELATIVES!!) my son and I went in here... let me start by this is in a section of town that I would NEVER be caught in... absolutely NOT AFTER DARK!! One of the highest crime areas in Mesa!!   After we locked the car, we go into this place and it is a complete and utter RUN DOWN DUMP!!  We were the only ones there and this older hispanic man was running around with trays and bags and acting like a lunatic.  He NEVER ONCE even acknowledged us.  Finally after about 10 minutes I asked him if we could get some service and he RUDELY told me that he had orders of tamale dozens to get out and he didn't HAVE TIME!!  WHAT?? You have a restaurant establishment and you don't have time to wait on a customer that has driven to your place to buy your friggin' food??   I guess my look on my face startled him... and then he said if I wanted to wait he would be with me in a bit... then he immediately went into the back room and left us once again! I turned to my son is complete astonishment and I asked him if he wanted to wait and he replied that we had driven all the way over here... that we might as well.  So we had a seat and continued to watch this maniac run to the trays and trays of tamales out front and then go in the back... I watched this for another 20 minutes.  Then he disappeared for quite a while and by that time we had been there 45 minutes... CAN YOU IMAGINE WAITING 45 MINUTES FOR A FRIGGIN TAMALE??  He never did come back out and so we left TO NEVER COME BACK!!   Maybe your tamale's are good but to offer this kind of non-service with a DON'T CARE attitude.... is absolutely reprehensible.  YOU SHOULD BE PUT OUT OF BUSINESS!!  My first call is to the City of Mesa Health Department!! I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE!!"}
{"text":"Good taste very flavorful,  but the tamales are small for the fee at any cost I buy mine by the dozens."}
{"text":"Went there today. The tamales are great but the service is extremely extremely super slow. I mean the food is already made all the have to do is bag it and charge you. I used to go every Sunday will not ever go again. The worst thing is the owner knows and he just does not want to pay another employee so his business runs better."}
{"text":"This is the BEST place to get tamales!!  I definitely recommend this place to everyone if you are looking for excellent taste, service and price.  I had the pork and the chicken but next time I will get a dozen of all three to try the beef.  GREAT job Old El Paso Tamales."}
{"text":"I love Tamales, so when I saw a local Tamale shop i had to give it a shot.  When you drive up in the strip center you see nothing but ALL CAPS - TAMALES.  I assume that you can't have that be the biggest thing on the wall and it can't not be good right?  I'm no Tamale expert by any means, but I decide to go in and grabbed 3 chicken tamales, one for me and 1 for each of my dudes in the office.  As I drove back to the office in anticipation I was just getting anxious.  I quickly devoured mine and I was not disappointed!  No sauce was necessary, but it was moist and the chicken had good flavor.  I quickly asked one of my co-workers if they would let me commandeer theirs b/c I just needed to have another one and gladly enough he was willing to part ways with it.  Before he let me have at my 2nd Tamale, both my teammates gave their stamp of approvals on the Tamales!   I'd go back if/when I'm in the Mesa area!"}
{"text":"Great little restaurant. Family owned - I think? Probably the best tamales I've had. I always try to support small and local. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"These are the best tamales in mesa hands down! I often tell people that i know these are best because they are better than my Moms tamales who has years of experience making them. The owner and his family are always curtious and accomodating. You have try these tamales and see for yourself."}
{"text":"Just like my great grandma makes them. Masa is the perfect texture: they must hand grind. I appreciate that they wrap them properly too so you don't have to fight them out. The guy at the counter was super nice! I had the red chile beef. I'm not normally a beef fan because they tend to be dry, but these were not."}
{"text":"The first time I've ever recommended tamales I could buy at a restaurant or store! I'm from New Mexico where they've got to have some spice and some flavor and these definitely fit the bill. I'd compare these to a lot of the homemade I've had that were really good maybe not quite the best but these are way up there! plus if you want something really to burn the top of your mouth off, get a pint of their green salsa, it'll really bring the hair off your chest!"}
{"text":"Spent some time in El Paso, Texas for awhile, best Tamales that I've had. This place was pretty good, tried the chicken, beef, and pork. I couldn't tell which was which between the beef and pork but one of them was delicious! Chicken was so so."}
{"text":"The owner Hector was very nice and personable . The pork tamales were my favorite. Beef we're also very good. Must try if your in Mesa."}
{"text":"These are the best Tamales I have had in a very long time. They have several kinds.  I have only tried the Corn and the Green Chile ones.  I need to try the Spinach, and the sweet ones (for dessert).  I personally am not a huge fan of meat tamales, so I will just extrapolate, and say based on the ones that I have had, they would have to be delicious.  I have always got a bag of 6 to go, and I usually have 3 or 4 of these for lunch during the week. Green salsa on top from New Mexico and we are good to go. Yum!  http://www.oldelpasotamales.com/"}
{"text":"So there I was washing laundry at the coin less laundry and watching peeps coming and going with tamales in hand.  Curious, I went outside and spotted the source, Old El Paso Tamales.  With a rumble in my tummy, I went inside.  The decor was extremely simple and extremely clean-looking.  I ordered the chicken and beef tamale.    As soon as I gathered my laundry I made a beeline home to sample my new find.  The chicken tamale was covered by some of the most delicious masa, but to be truthful I was disappointed with only one husk...I guess I'm spoiled with two husks (tamale lovers know what I'm talking about).  I wish I could've tasted more of the chicken but the spiciness overwhelmed the chicken.  Sorry, but coming from a guy who grew up in AZ and in a household where El Pato and hot sauce are used like ketchup and jalapenos like pickles, the chicken was less than expected.    The beef tamale was delicious and meaty, with the juices from the beef marinating the masa.    To be honest I'll be back for the beef and trying out the pork and giving the chicken one more chance."}
{"text":"If anyone is looking for southern New Mexico style tamales (if you know, you know what I mean) look no further. They use Hatch green chile and are honestly some of the best tamales I have had. Great find!!"}
{"text":"Great pork and sweet corn tamales! Yum! I just ate and already want to go back for more!"}
{"text":"We've been here several times... every time it's delicious!  We've tried chicken, pork and beef tamales. My favorite are the pork tamales (they seem a little spicier than the beef) and my hubby's favorite are the chicken tamales. Plus, it's decently priced - as of August 2013, I can get a dozen for about $16.  I will keep coming back."}
{"text":"Omg I love tamles and in all mynlife I have never had such amazing tamales. Corn tamales where the best I have ever had. I will be taking dozens of them back to California. You know it is good food when there is a line out the door.  The best ever!!!"}
{"text":"Website advertises 14.99 but then they charge you 19.99 for a dozen. When we called the manager he could careless about what the website says since he stated he doesn't have access to it. This is false advertisement. Yes they are good tamales but with the price going up and with the website miss leading the public it's not worth the price anymore."}
{"text":"The tamales here are the best! I love the green chile chicken ones and usually have to get at least one every week. They are so good my boyfriend in Washington is having me send some up."}
{"text":"I love these tamales and they have made a customer for life. first off they are the perfect masa consistency and the flavor is spot on. Masa is fluffy and perfect. The meats are delicious and moist without being overly fatty. I will be comming back. These are hands down the best tamales I have ever eaten."}
{"text":"They definitely do Tamales the correct way with the proper texture of the Masa.  They get extremely busy during holiday season and the line can be out the door.  It's wise to place your large order in advance, otherwise you'll just get angry waiting in line.  They serve them fresh off the steam table versus pre packaging them which makes for more waiting...The Pork, green Chile and Chicken Tamales are stellar despite the chicken ones getting a tad dry, just moisten the meat before you reheat...Probably the best place in The Valley to get Tamales.  This is their business, their speciality..."}
{"text":"Best Tomales around! If you swing by mid morning they will just be pulling out a fresh batch of Tomales still steaming.  Chicken and Sweet corn are my favorites, chicken packs a punch and Corn is like a dessert. Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Love the tamales here! The corn tamales and beef are my fav! The corn tamales are sweet and delicious. :)  A dozen is 14 something including tax I believe. And the hours are only until 5 or 6 depending on the day I think, so make sure you get there in time to take a dozen home. And closed Mondays. I should post when I'm more awake so I could sound slightly more knowledgeable and prepared... :P"}
{"text":"I have been coming here sporadically for the last 4 or 5 years.   I know how to make tamales, but I only make them a few times a year and do not like them if they've been frozen too long.  So, in the past, this has been a \"go to\" place a couple times a year when no one in the family has any fresh tamales.  They used to be really good, but the last time and yesterday they were not great.  When I first bought the tamales you could see shredded chicken, strips of green Chile, and they used to put cheese which I really liked.  Now, the chicken looks like mush.  There's no green Chile that I can see and they no longer do the cheese.  The cheese is not a deal breaker, but the mushy meat instead of shredded meat is. The masa used to be flavorful, but now it tastes like lard only.  I actually took a friend there for lunch about 6 months ago, and they were not good.  I thought it was a fluke, so I went back yesterday and bought a dozen for a quick dinner at home with rice and beans.  The tamales were so bland I had to make an enchilada sauce to cover them to add flavor. We only ate half the dozen and will toss the rest."}
{"text":"Love them! I drive a hour to get them and it makes my dad EXTRA happy to receive them as a gift!  The staff is friendly especially the owner- If you haven't been here, you are missing out!"}
{"text":"Best tamales so far in Arizona. Their menudo is good too. Love this place glad they stay open to 6:00 pm during the week. If you want different kind of tamales you need to come here you won't be dispointed."}
{"text":"Not very organized or very English speaking, but the last point is expected. So, this place basically only serves tamales and at $18 per dozen it was the cheapest in the valley. I called in an order and three days later when I arrive, my order, my name and anything else got lost in translation and there was no order. What a waste, but luckily since all they make is tamales, you can just pick them up off the steam table and head off.     CORN - Very Yellow with real corn inside, but bland GREEN CHILE - this a hot version, so beware with a carrot and onion inside also. Too spicy. PORK - I don't like, so did not try BEEF/Chicken - they were out The point of calling ahead is get what I wanted, so they failed miserably in that respect and they also could use some better English speaking skills. This place will close if Trump gets elected. Sometimes the cheapest stuff is the place to avoid."}
{"text":"I LOVE their Tamalaes, but they have recently gone up on the price.  No longer worth the drive over there.  The last few times that I have visited, they have been limited on their selection as well.  Wish they were not so expensive....I would be their every week."}
{"text":"We got some pork, beef, green corn and a chicken to go.  Definitely some of the best tamales I've ever had.  If they weren't so small, I would give them 5 stars.  Front counter person could be a little nicer too.   Very limited hours, but pretty close to my house, so I'm happy about that.  We will DEFINITELY be back."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years.  I used to work at Banner up the street and it was a weekly lunch stop.  Good size, just the right heat, the tamales are soft and melt in your mouth quality.  The owner is awesome and always recognizes me.  The green japilino sauce is a must.  I am very sad I nolonger work close to here so ever time I am in the neighborhood I grab a few dozen and freeze them.  After the micro wave they taste like I am in the store. 5 star for all."}
{"text":"My first time visiting this place today, Total disappointment!  The price of $2.25 for a single tamal was outrageous to say the least considering the size or lack of size of the portion. There was 90% masa to literally a teaspoon of beef and the rest was husk. I just went there do to a craving and bc my friends mother has not made any and my mother out of town. I would give this place a 1/2 star on the taste, masa had no seasoning and the bite of meat wasn't enough. The worse tamales I have ever overpayed for and no taste in how to make a true tamal."}
{"text":"The tamales are like I remember  in Texas. It's funny, for Arizona being so hispanic heavy - the mexican food kinda falls short. But these tamales came through!!"}
{"text":"Based on all the positive reviews I had to try this place. Service was good but that was it!  7.95 for a half dozen tamales.  You get what you pay for!  They were dry and chicken was tooooo spicy.  A one time thing!!!  Tried beef, chicken and chili!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the tamales and can't wait to go back.  The process/service is a bit odd.  There is a buffet steam table filled with whatever flavor tamales they have available for walk ins at the moment.  You choose from there what you want and how many.  I first tried to order a combo meal but it seemed like a hassle.  We ended up with a dozen tamales to go.  We had beef and corn  and chicken (the only three available).  My husband enjoyed the chicken.  I shared the beef and corn with my daughter and a friend.  We all really enjoyed them.  I think I liked the corn a bit more than beef but would still order both again.  We also got a large side of Mexican Rice and a bag of sliced limes with our order.  My friend has been back since to pick up a dozen!  I am also thrilled that they are open on Sunday.  There are so many restaurants in the area that are not.  One tamale is now $2.25 and a dozen was just over $18. I understand the prices went up 11/1/15 but still very reasonable price for tamales."}
{"text":"I've visited this location quite a few times in the past because their tamales have always been good. Although the past few visits seem like they've gone down in service as well as quality. Today I stopped in for a half dozen of tamales, but only three choices were available-chicken, green chili and corn. This was understandable since in the past their tamales sold fast, but when I told the girl taking my order that I'd still take the half dozen, she seemed irritated that i still wanted my order.  I didn't exactly see the same joy and smile she had given to the lady and gentleman before me. Usually this type of service wouldn't bother me, but what made me write this review was that the tamales she served me seemed to not have cooperated with my stomach too well and I have been hugging the toilet for quite some time this evening. It is making me question now why she took my order to the back room before handing it over to me since anyone who's visited this location knows that once they bag your tamales they hand them right over. I'm not sure I want to return after this."}
{"text":"I do think this place has great tamales but the last couple times I went have been a little inconsistent. I just got some before Thanksgiving and some were very small and only had meat halfway through and some were fine. Also, the time prior to this they had a smokey or burnt flavor. While that may be fine if you are making them for just family- when you are selling them at kinda a high price (about $20 for a dozen) to the public they need to be almost perfect-- especially when one can get them pretty inexpensive and adequate from a place like Costco... I just think consistency is the key here-- especially when you specialize in one product (mostly). If this place is consistent the tamales are awesome but they need to find that flow and keep it going."}
{"text":"Excellent family run business. There's no place in Arizona where will you find tamales like these. Best masa that I've ever had in a restaurant. Truly handmade tamales. I've tried them all and none disappoint. If you need a quantity for a special event, order a day or two early."}
{"text":"After reading the good reviews, I figured I would give this place a try.  Stopped in around 1:30 pm during the middle of the week to pick up some tamales for dinner.   They only had chicken and said it would be about 20 minutes for different ones.  Didn't have the time to wait so I took 6 chicken tamales.  Man, these tamales are the bomb!  I cannot wait to try the others."}
{"text":"I came to this place thinking it was another restaurant but decided to stay and I'm glad I did. I ordered a pork tamale and a green chili burrito. The burrito was a good size especially for the price and tasted very good. It had a nice kick to it and didn't need any sauce. On to the tamale which was the main event. One of the 2 most important parts of a tamale is the masa and this masa was very good and held together very well, the other important piece is the protein and this pork was not only a good amount but also very juicy. Overall this place was a great \"mistake\" and I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"I cannot give this place a rating on their food....I didn't get that far....the service is terrible I stood in line for like 30 mins. or longer with only 2 people ahead of me.  This place is well spoken of but I never accept bad service from any establishment.  SORRY FELLOW YELPERS.  NOT WORTH THE AGGRAVATION!!!!!"}
{"text":"Best tameles I've had in AZ for my weekend trip out here. oh man I had chicken tameles with eggs, rice, and beans. what a killer breakfast that was. the bean didn't suck, but they were really amazing. the rice was very nice, and the eggs were cooked great even though they were unseasoned. which is pretty good because it lets you salt and pepper them to your liking."}
{"text":"Love this place!  The masa in these tamales are delicious!  You can't go wrong with any you choose. The beef however, is my favorite!  The only complaint is that they only have one type of salsa and it's nuclear!!  Definitely worth a trip if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Ugh! How I love this little hole in the wall place.. their tamales are all to die for in my opinion! I crave tamales the most around Christmas time but I always get those odd cravings throughout the year, and I love how this place makes their fresh daily! It's like heaven for me, tamales on demand so I don't have to wait til the end of the year to get my fix! But come early so they aren't out of what you want!!"}
{"text":"They're ok a little bit pricey and sometimes they seem undercooked but the green corn is excellent."}
{"text":"I found Old El Paso while washing my car.  I ordered Thanksgiving and Christmas tamales and the tamales were the best.  Then my daughter and her boyfriend were in town all the way from Denver.  I took them to Old El Paso and they were so happy with their food.  It's tasty, authentic and some of the best tamales that I've ever eaten.  I got my husband their breakfast burrito and that was awesome also.  I'm ordering out for my son's birthday meal at Old El Paso."}
{"text":"I was very dissatisfied. I bought 2dozen tomales and what I received 2 dozen masa tomales. There was very little filling, maybe a tablespoon."}
{"text":"OMG!  My husband brought these home after work today.  They are delicious and I dare say the best tamales I've ever had.  My favorite is the green chile.  You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Well, I am not a tamale person. I simply came here to get tamales for my tamale person. I have been referred to this tamale restaurant by several tamale people who say that this tamale location is to die for. Well, you won't find me eating tamales very often but I did enjoy the tamales from this place. Especially the sweet corn tamales. I would probably weigh 500 pounds if I continue read these delicious things. This place is dangerous so eat it at your own risk. Also, sidenote, I don't think everybody here speaks English so bring your Google translator or try to impress them with your super limited Spanish-speaking skills like I do. I definitely made them laugh with some of the words that I know I used wrong on purpose . Or just be cool and bring one of your homey's and let them do the talking, whatever works best for you"}
{"text":"Tamales are quite good, but their customer service needs some work.  I stopped by earlier this week to place an order and was told they weren't accepting any more pre-orders. I was advised to just walk-in today and pick them up.  I have purchased here in the past, so I knew I had to confirm whether they would have some available.  Their employee said yes, we will have plenty.  So my husband stops by this morning and was told he couldn't buy any unless he pre-ordered.  He said about 2/3 of the line walked out when they heard this.  I get that they're busy this time of year.  However, I wish they would have been upfront with us. Why tell me to come back when they knew there was a good possibility they wouldn't have any extra to sell? Or at least a warning would have been nice instead of assuring me they would have plenty.  So now we're scrambling at the last minute trying to find some. Not to mention 2 wasted trips to their restaurant. Which by the way, it would be helpful if they posted a sign to let customers know they're out of tamales so they wouldn't bother standing in line. Common courtesy does wonders."}
{"text":"This place makes you feel like your in Mexico.  We visited this place in December on a Sunday.  Arrived just before 9 am short wait to order from the steam table and we were able to find a table.  After 9 am line was out the door.  She suggested ordering 1/2 dozen as it was cheaper.  Ordered Beef, chicken with chilies, sweet corn, and green chili and cheese as this is all that was available today.  Order side of rice but it seemed bland.  Massa on all very moist and excellent.  The tamales are large and filling is plentiful. They have no enchilada sauces bummer because I like my tamales layer in sauce.  They do have a green HOT sauce.  Beef was dry and no flavor would not order again.  Pork is my favorite.  Chicken outstanding (I don't like chicken tamales) totally surprised me.  These are hot but a little lower than hot.  Nose running but yummy.  Husband LOVED them  Sweet corn I don't like sweet but my husband LOVED them.  Chili & cheese - yummy and medium to hot depending on your taste buds"}
{"text":"Last time I was in for Tamales, I was told there would soon be a full menu! If the rest of what is offered is as tasty as the Tamales, this may be my new Mexican restaurant of choice. More updates to come after the full menu appears."}
{"text":"These tamales are DELICIOUS!!!!!   Do yourself a favour and go here.  The website recommends calling first, which is a great idea.  Not only to find out if they have what you need available that day, but also to see if they're open.  They don't necessarily open right at 8 or 9, but the tamales are WELL worth it.  Best tamales I've ever eaten."}
{"text":"menudo was good. tamales were decnet has a el paso feel to it and overall pretty good"}
{"text":"Have been craving tamales so I did some good soul searching and came across this place, was  looking forward to a delicious authentic tamale, unfortunately this place did not do any justice! Wish I hadn't bought a dozen, I mean the tamales aren't awful but their also not worth a 4 or 5 start rating, They're \"okay\" better than frozen store tamales BUT that is not saying much. I order tamales de rojo, or pork, the masa was pretty bland, lacked even the color red, the pork wasn't very flavorful, it just lacked flavoring and just was mediocre in general. I'm not sure how these tamales are so praised? Maybe I bought from a bad batch? If you KNOW a good tamale, this place is not for you. If the tamales you've grew up knowing are from the Walmart frozen section, this place is for YOU."}
{"text":"Best tamales in Mesa!!  My first visit was a sample of a tamale. Hector the owner was so nice and the tamale was excellent. My friends and I stopped by for lunch today. The tamales again are legit! I had the 2 egg and 2 tamale with beans and soda combo. This combo I've never had and it was an explosion of flavors being triggered in my mouth. The meat in the corn tamales was fresh and texture was smooth. Everything was fresh and brought to us quickly.  Old El Paso Tamales is open for breakfast, lunch and dinner. It's awesome to drop in grab tamales that are authentic, hot and ready! Im going take them out to a party or dinner for the family. I will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"The masa is perfect. The sweet is perfectly sweet and the savory just right. The meat is well seasoned. Great Tamales."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for about 4 years but I think I need to find a new spot for my tamales. The customer service is TERRIBLE here. Like others mention, they can careless about their customers. This most recent occasion my wife called and placed a pick up order for the following day. When we arrived (at the time they said they'd be ready) I come to find they lost our order. No apologies or admittance, but it was clear when they asked me multiple times the name on the order and how many dozen. The man behind me in line was a frequent customer as they told him \"we had your order for the 24th\", he replied \"yeah l, I had one for the 24th and today.\"  He ended up getting his order done first although he was behind me in line. Then they proceeded to ask me again how many dozen of each.  When it came time to pay the man then admitted \"we have all but pork\", not apologizing or asking if I wanted more of a different kind.   Also, as other mention the price is not matching their website. Unless you want to be treated like your time doesn't matter, go somewhere else.  I give 3 stars because the tamales are excellent. But, as another mentioned, the chicken tamale does not have much meat anymore and is mushy."}
{"text":"Best menudo in town! They serve red and white. I can't wait to come back to try their tamales!!! :)"}
{"text":"Old El Paso Tamales took me back to my Mothers homemade tamales! Highly recommend stopping by and getting your tamale craving filled!"}
{"text":"Saw this place while I was picking up pizza for my kids.  I didn't want pizza thought I would go in and give the tamales a try.  I haven't regretted that decision at all.  The chicken tamales are the BEST!  They are super spicy, the way I like.  The beef with red sauce is great too, not very spicy at all.  The masa in all the tamales is flavored wonderfully.  I am hooked on these tamales."}
{"text":"Delicious tamales. Easily some of the best I've ever had. But, they lose a star for having a toddler, sitting on the counter by the register, playing games on the tablet used to take credit cards. It was kind of dirty."}
{"text":"Best tamales and burros! I make sure I stop by every time I am in the East Valley. We REALLY need one in Peoria! Can't beat the price or the quality and flavor. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Best tamales in town, they taste like home made. I had jalapeño and cheese and they were really good. A bit hot but extremly good."}
{"text":"The tamales here are awesome!  I would suggest calling to make sure they're open, even during their business hours.  I've come here twice during the posted hours and they were closed."}
{"text":"This place is the best!!!!  The green chili chicken are GREAT"}
{"text":"Great tamales. Wish they had a salsa bar. You can ask for green salsa, which they don't offer without inquiry and isn't on the  menu but is very good.   Breakfast burritos are mediocre. Chorizo pretty greasy."}
{"text":"These are definitely the best tamales I have ever eaten. LOVE this place! The green chili chicken and corn tamales are my favorites."}
{"text":"These tamales are DAMB GOOD. It seems that the operators of Old El Paso Tamales are fully aware of that... The Tamales are, again.. delicious, and perfect in consistency, flavor, texture, temperature, and freshness, BUT.. they're about 1/2 the size of a standard Tamale and a little bit more expensive.. The place doesn't have a menu board.. it's just.. tamales! (i guess they make other things but.. I'm not sure they want you to know that. :) The Chicken was my favorite, but also the pork and beef are FAB."}
{"text":"So being of Hispanic origin & a true AZ Native, I would like to think I am somewhat of an authority on Tamales. Not really, but I know what I like & I have tried them all over town. I do believe that these really are the \"Best Ever\". I love the old standby pork tamales but I thought I would give the chicken and  the corn tamale a try. They both knocked it out of the park, although the Chicken one was\" very\" spicy, the blend of green chili, chicken & monterey jack cheese was a beautiful palatable combination. Then to cool things down I feasted on the corn tamale which was savory yet sweet,  I love that they did not sweeten the masa for this delectable treat as I was not looking for a dessert tamale. Kudos to the chef now perhaps they could work on the dining room a little. Never mind... I will probably just get my dozen to go anyways."}
{"text":"Born and raised in El Paso, currently living in Phoenix... Old El Paso Tamales is the place to go to get a taste of home. The tamales, burros and menudo are excellent! The service is welcoming and like home."}
{"text":"Good place the tamales where good but the menudo was amazing that's pic i put up. Staff was friendly and on top of things very good small environment. Menu was short nice and easy to pick from. I will go back again but for the amazing menudo and might try a breakfast burrito. Thank you guys and i will see you soon!.."}
{"text":"Bombest tamales to date  Love this place owners super friendly My wife loves her eggs a certain way  And he went thru three tries to get em how she loves em  We come from Gilbert just for there tamales  Keep not they close at 3pm but well worth the drive"}
{"text":"Old El Paso Tamales is by far the best restaurant I have found in Mesa for menudo and tamales.   As far as the service, It is a family run business and can be a tad slow. Patience is the key. Defiantly worth the wait!"}
{"text":"The best tamales EVER.  Today I tried the Green Chili burrito and it was so tasty.  I will be back for this burrito"}
{"text":"Very good food! Fast! If you need more than 1 dozen call and place order. Delicious,  just make sure you count them! They do 3k a day . You know?"}
{"text":"I work at the nearby high school, and I am glad I was told about this place. Friendly service, and incredible food. These tamales are amazing. The negative reviews on here about this place puzzle me... Owner is nice as can be, the food is incredible."}
{"text":"Was on the east side for some training and this place was recommend , found the food to be good and reasonably priced. I did try the Tamales and green chili burro, not the style served in globe Arizona but it was good."}
{"text":"Whatever they're doing, it's exactly right.  The masa is delicious and so are the fillings and the proportion of masa to fillings is perfect.  There are a lot of places that give you tamales that have way too much masa and hardly any filling; this restaurant is not one of them.  Definitely worth the trip from mid-town Phoenix for these!"}
{"text":"This place is good but customer service is not optimal.  Probably a 4 star for the food.  Tamales are delicious and probably my #1 place to get when I'm in the mood for something fast and delicious.  However as of late the consistency has not been the same.  My favorite ones the chicken tamales, the difference between one tamal from the next is vast.  Some had lots of shredded chicken while others had very little, this from the same batch (1 dozen that I ordered)...I don't like surprises with my food, consistency is a must.  On the service level, the wait is excessive but that's impart to the inefficient process they have and telephone calls for pick up orders.  Most people the go there and order to go, shop there exclusively to buy tamales.  How about you speed up the process by adding a second register and a dedicated person for customers that are buying tamales only? You will get more of my business and others if I don't have to wait 15-25 minutes in a line of 5 people because the cashier is getting ready the order she just got in the phone while we are waiting in line...or they disappear in the back to prepare/pack food for orders...this is so inefficient and not customer service focus."}
{"text":"This is the place to get authentic tamales at a great price! The service staff is really friendly and the owner is very talkative and willing to help out with anything you need. Definitely ask for his green salsa, it is delicious with a great hot spice to it!!"}
{"text":"Last week I rated this place and now I wanted to add more to the review.  I have just finished my last two tamales of the dozen I bought.  These were so good, they tasted as if they were made in someones kitchen at home and not in a business.  I have never eaten store bought tamales of this quality.  The masa was perfect and the meat was tender and flavorful while still being very lean.  People have complained about the size of these tamales, but for not home made, these are a very good size.  I will be trying other styles next time I go (maybe tomorrow)."}
{"text":"AWESOME!!!!  The best tamales at a reasonable price! Great family run business.  You must go!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for a few years now and really like the tamales. I tell everyone I know about them and have taken them to work functions. My complaint is that over the last couple of years, the size of the tamale is getting smaller, the filling is less but the prices are going up. I understand economics, food prices are rising so the cost of your product goes up so you have to raise your price to continue to be profitable. But if you are going to do this do NOT lower the quality of your food. I still enjoy the flavor, just wish they didn't skimp on the filling."}
{"text":"This place is a toss up... Tamales are good the masa is very smooth and moist and different from a lot of places. It's a small place and not super clean but it's  no biggie since we usually get tamales to go. But I am only posting this in hopes that the owner does read their reviews. Their staff is in big need of evaluation. They are far from friendly, slow, unattentive and seriously need to learn to answer the phone."}
{"text":"My dad was in town and never has had a tamale.  My wife Google beat tamales in Mesa and this establishment came up.  I orders a dozen...typical price around $20.  They were good. We got a variety.  The green Chile is hot...I like hot so ended up being over stuffed cause the family were on fire.  I would go again."}
{"text":"Ate lunch here for the first time a few days ago.  Half dozen for $7.99 or $1.75 each, decent size.  No waiting at 1:30 p.m.  But within moments the place was packed and all tables full (approx. 8).  The two pork tamales were the best (pork is usually always better than beef).  The two chicken were ok and the two corn had been sweetened with sugar and not for me.  If you have a sweet tooth then this my work for you.  They gave me the six tamales in a basket.  Plastic forks and napkins located at counter.  No plates were seen or offered for the two of us.  Nor, did I ask.  The only sauce they have is green...and it is extremely hot.  You have to ask for sauce and the counter person will get it.  I will definitely be back for the pork tamales.  And, possibly try some of their others (beef, green chili, etc.)"}
{"text":"So close to my mom's. The green chilli ones were yummy abd just enough spice.   I will be back!"}
