{"text":"Tasty subs and they deliver too!  I haven't tried the pizza yet, but their subs are delicious. Their delivery is pretty fast. No complaints here!"}
{"text":"I have been here two times so far and I really enjoyed my meal both times. I had pasta both times, MAMA MIA was it good. I recently ordered a similar pasta at a fancy restaurant and I liked the pasta I had here better and it was half the price.  I can confidently recommend the pasta (I asked them to make me a seafood pasta, one with Alfredo sauce and one with spicey Marinara), garlic bread, and antipasto salad, what a delicious dinner; I will definitely be back.  Someone ordered a meatball sub and it looked very good as well.  This is a small family owned restaurant, so be patient and keep that in mind before ordering. The owners are awesome and I want to thank them for a great meal and a great experience."}
{"text":"LOST CUSTOMER

I live 8 blocks away and can't order a medium pizza for delivery because it doesn't meet their  minimum order. SMH A pizza joint that doesn't deliver a pizza. Plus the customer service skills of the lady at the front counter is somewhat harsh. 

Very unfortunate I cannot give patronage to this business. I think they're longevity may be in question."}
{"text":"Mouth-watering food! Despite the place being a small restaurant, the food was delicious. The pizza and wings here are amazing! The wings are a bit on the crispy side, not soggy at all like at other places. They have many different flavors: Honey BBQ, Mango Habanero, Mild, Spicy, and Extra Hot. I ordered the mild wings. They are spicy but not too much, I can still enjoy them. The pizza is thin crust and has lots of cheese. I ordered the Giant Manhattan, which feeds about 8-10 people. The chefs are really accommodating and can split the pizza into different toppings if you want. I got half Hawaiian, half pepperoni. I also got an order of fried zucchini! It was crispy on the outside yet still fresh inside. Delicious overall! Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"We ordered a pizza and some wings and were not disappointed! We love pizza and have never before fallen in love with a place on the first bite. This is our new go to pizza place."}
{"text":"Second time in a row that I have been there and not been able to get pizza.  First time we were told the pizza oven was broken.  Today we were told that it was full of pizza.  They had a large order and weren't making pizza for anyone else."}
{"text":"Under new ownership and even though the food was always amazing, it's even better! Chef Alberto has the touch. New menu items added like eggplant Parmesan, that I can't wait to try. Best pizza and subs around, by far! Fast and friendly service. Very lucky to have this place in our neighborhood. Pass up Pizza Hut and get your pizza here!"}
{"text":"Something is a bit off with this Greek salad...hmmm.... Makes me wonder if it got washed....now that I read the reviews...I really wonder - look at the pic and you'll understand...Pizza and hummus were good...I'll revisit salad tomorrow..."}
{"text":"Sand-wish was the Shiznitt... Great Manhattan customer service. Quick delivery time and friendly driver. Stuffed as a Thanksgiving turkey right now. Nap time Zzzz"}
{"text":"In some cases, size does not matter at all! As someone who was both born and raised less than 70 miles from actual Manhattan, I am truly offended that this huge piece of unsavory white-bread dough, smothered in unpalatable tomato sauce and covered in the cheapest version of real mozzarella cheese you can find in the valley of the sun, is in any way, ever confused with real NY Pizza! Although I'll admit, I must at least give them credit for getting one part of this weak imitation of the world's most delicious pizza correct, the size of the pie at this pizza joint is spot on, 100% accurate. Unfortunately, the overall appearance of their pie is the only part of New York's most intriguing recipe which they cared to mimick, well that and our most famous borough's name which (despite the fact it is misspelled) is part of company's title. There are several steps to a good tasting pizza, which in the age of search engines, isn't too much of a secret or that hard to find if one puts in the miniscule amount of effort it takes to type \"Authentic NY Pizzeria Recipes\" into one's search bar. Don't be fooled by it's size, there are much better versions of a true NY pizza in the valley of the sun for a third of the price of this imposter."}
{"text":"The pizza is delicious 
I also ordered mild wings but they are super drenched in Hot sauce - hotter than mild."}
{"text":"I have been here a number of times for a quick slice. Extremely consistent. I really love the flavor of the sauce on the pizza. If you need it to be really quick, call ahead to place your order. Everything is made fresh so if you have only 30 minutes to order and eat, it's going to be tight. But everything is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend decided to stop in for a quick lunch, but my slice and wings and her sub took almost an hr when they said it'd be 20 minutes. Mind you the place is dead and only other customer was a pick up. I won't be going back but I did give it 2 stars because the pizza and sub were huge."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza! Amazing salads! Amazing food in general. Can't beat a huge slice from a 28\" pie and a drink for $5! I come here for lunch weekly and wish I could come every day."}
{"text":"I've had this pizza at least 5 times ordered by the company I work for. I'll keep this short but the pizza itself is actually pretty good. Fairly overpriced but I'm writing this specifically for the customer service. They are constantly late for deliveries, wrong food delivered, pizzas have been destroyed upon delivery, and have promised to replace the food next time. Well, next time has come more than once and they fail to own up to their promises.  

Bottom line: don't rely on them for parties or events"}
{"text":"I don't understand some of the reviews on here, I took a chance on this place because I don't listen to someone's opinion until I find out on my own and I'm glad I did, lunch is cheap, you get a huge Slice of pizza and a drink for 5 bucks and the wings are decent, it's a quiet place I'll be back."}
{"text":"Food is always late- order was wrong most of the time when they delivered the food to our company- owner was nasty- don't rely on them for large orders. They don't honor promises they made to replace our order."}
{"text":"Pizza was cold (although I don't blame them completely for this considering I ordered through door dash and the guy was late). What the one star is for is The bbq wings were not fully cooked. Bloody and gross. Will not order from here again. The pizza itself was ok but was over priced."}
{"text":"Speaking for / someone from the east coast: 
This Pizza has no relations with a pie from Manhattan.
It's more closely related to papa Gino. - the frozen variety . 
And I'd rather eat that . 
. Maybe if you have never had Manhattan pizza this could be called edible .  However mine is in the rubbish.  
PLEASE RE NAME YOUR PLACE . 
.. the employees are very friendly ."}
{"text":"Ordered a Slice and some wings. I did not expect the slice to be huge. Their one slice is the size of small-medium pizzas at other places. I love the taste and it was done in NY style my favorite. 
Saw that they have a huge 28 inch pizza. And also many subs and salads, spaghetti and more than enough appetizers to fill you up. 
Not many people inside most orders were carry out. I always support local businesses and this place is run by husband and wife. 
Definitely give it a try. However expect a little wait. Everything is made from scratch!"}
{"text":"Best place in this area to grab a bite to eat. Lunch special is awesome which is a HUGE slice of pizza and a canned soda, only six bucks. Awesome subs! Meatball marinara, Philly cheese steak, and Italian subs are my favorite."}
{"text":"It was decent, however I think they're overpriced for mediocre pizza. $5 for a slice of pizza? Way too much, plus the cheese bread were soggy and greasy. The cheese has no color to them either! Practically just melted onto the bread."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the pizza here. My partner and I happened to be driving looking for something to eat and found this place hidden in the corner of an old strip mall. Food was made fresh and delicious. They have a gigantic pizza you can order for a party."}
