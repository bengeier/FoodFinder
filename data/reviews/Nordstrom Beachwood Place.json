{"text":"Ok, so I was visiting here from CA and much to my dismay, the shoe selection was TINY. The handbag selection was SAD and there was no fine jewelry department. I came in to look at a Bony Levy bracelet and was a bit surprised that they took out their fine jewelry department. The customer service as non-existent at this store. I am better off at my pleasanton, CA store where I am greeted with a smile and they actually want to help me with my shopping. Don't bother wasting your time or your $$$."}
{"text":"We had the most amazing customer service experience at this store. We flew to OH for a wedding, and the airline lost our bags; which carried my boyfriend's suit and all his clothes. This could have been a tragedy, since he is not able to fit on a regular off the rack suit.  We called before we arrived to the store and Joe at the Men's Department assured us that he could find just the right suit and have it altered in under 2 hours; we could not believe it. Once we arrived, he took us in right away and was extremely knowledgeable and helpful; he assisted us with everything from shoes to the perfect pocket square.   We were able to make it to the wedding and thanks to Joe, the weekend wasn't a total disaster.   Needless to say, if you are looking for a great experience where the employees actually listen and pay attention to your needs, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Great customer service!  I like shopping at this store and always find great products and good prices!"}
{"text":"Went looking for a white dress shirt here with my boyfriend.  He was annoyed at being unable to find a really plain white shirt in his size at multiple other stores at Beechwood.  We were browsing a table of shirts and a saleswoman approached us.  She grabbed a couple of shirts and brought him to the dressing room.  She helped him until he found the style he wanted and brought the tailor over to measure and shorten the shirt a bit.  We will see how it turns out when we pick it up, but she was an extremely helpful salesperson."}
{"text":"RE Wedding Dress shopping (Wedding Suite): I met with Katie and she was absolutely fabulous! She was understanding, not pushy, and definitely connected with my style.  Katie was very professional and kept the dresses in my budget. We were in and out in under an hour and I like to think that it was partly because she did not waste my time with dresses either out of my budget or not at all my style. She also proceeded to help my mom with the mother of the bride dress which I know my mom greatly appreciated.   Long distance/destination brides....Nordstroms (in addition to Katie) made it very easy to ship everything to Chicago (where I currently reside) and proceeded to hook me up with another stylist in Chicago for when I am ready to get shoes, jewelry, and if any alterations need to be made. They will also ship it from Chicago to San Francisco for me when its ready for the wedding! If you're a card holder there are some great benefits as well. If you're not one already - become one!"}
{"text":"This is one of the few stores carrying products and providing service that is worth every cent.  Tim in Women's shoes is fantastic, attentive, and fun.  I walked in looking homeless, but there was no pretty woman moment.  Tim marched right up to me and treated me like a queen.  He made it easy to drop $700 on a new shoe wardrobe. The return policy has a history of being customer friendly.  Every piece of clothing I've bought is high quality."}
{"text":"I shop at this Nordstrom often and having been to several other Nordstrom locations, I can definitely say that this my favorite one. I feel that the sales associates go above and beyond to help you (as one would expect shopping here).   The store itself is pretty well-lit, the restrooms are clean, and the store is  very comfortable to shop in.  Typical \"department store\" music is played throughout. :)   This is my go-to store for anything from makeup to buying clothes for my family and myself.   The Cafe Nordstrom is located on the third level. They always have great food and the service is incredible (ask for David - he is a great waiter).   Also a plus, the store is right next to the parking garage, so parking is very convenient when it is snowing or raining."}
{"text":"I love Nordstroms kids shoe section. I have been a customer for at least 15 years. Their customer service is exceptional and consistent. I have had a great experience with Rachael and other employees. They give my children balloons and they also color. I am greeted immediately and helped with in store and or online purchases. I recommend this store over Saks, any day and I worked for Saks years ago. What makes Nordstroms stand out, is their customer service is genuine, warm and consistent."}
{"text":"A true high-end shopping experience.  Merchandise is tastefully arranged and the whole store is open, clean and well thought out to facilitate a pleasurable retail experience.  The sales staff are attentive and respectful in serving customers.  The Grill on the 3rd Floor is a superb dining experience.  There is also an underground parking garage."}
{"text":"So normally I wouldn't get annoyed with Nordstroms, but the customer service at the MAC counter was less then acceptable.  There were several staff members working the counter.  So there shouln't have been any trouble getting assistance.  My daughter, who is a make-up addict walked up to the counter and asked if they could sanitize a lipstick so that she could try it out.   The responce:  \"We can't help you\"  What on earth does that mean?  Can you not help her at all?  Can you help her in a minute? Are you with someone?  Do we need to wait?    I was listening from the Jo Malone counter next to her.  Truly, I think they blew her off because she is a teenager.  Perhaps they thought she was too young to afford that lipstick?  They didn't see her with an adult.    All I can say is too bad you lost that sale and her future MAC sales.  I scooped her up and we left.   She will continue to buy her MAC at Saks.... they actually know her there, if that tells you anything!"}
{"text":"This is the most disappointing Nordstrom I have ever been to.  The selection isn't nearly as extensive or nice as other Nordstrom stores.  While we were in the shoe department today we noticed tons of shoes and boxes strewn all over the department, and many employees just walked past them and didn't bother to tidy up the department.  That isn't how a 'normal' Nordstrom operates.  This place operates more like a Dillard's than anything...very disappointing."}
{"text":"Bought a men's shirt today for 75.00. The very detached middle aged male employee placed it in the bag on a snowy day without even wrapping with paper.    I asked for a box that I am accustomed to when I buy shirts, \" I'll check but am not sure we have any.\" He  then took quite awhile with an unpleasant demeanor in the process, but the boxed shirt was great.   On my husbands birthday too... By the way, I picked out the shirt in less than a minute. No one approached to help. If I owned the company he would be suspended. Hope he's not the owner."}
{"text":"Went for lunch.  Loved the old menu.  Not so found of the new menu.  But I must be the only one as the place was packed.  Server not as attentive as I would have liked.  But the waitress situation is a variable we will take into account. In regards to the store, I do like the new selection of home good products.  Feel like the clothes selection doesn't talk to me like it used to. Is it time for some new clotes buyers, or is it just me?"}
{"text":"This Nordstrom will always hold a special place in my heart. This location is where I had my first Nordstrom experience and it was a great one.   Nordstrom has incredible customer service. If you are looking from something and they don't have it they will search for it and send it to you. I love how they mail you a little thank you letter for your purchase.  This store is set up just like my local store in Pittsburgh, small! Just about the whole store is geared towards women. And a small little section left for men.  One nice thing is that they offer free alterations on pants and jeans."}
{"text":"Skip the Wedding Suite if You're Plus-Sized (bridesmaid)  I went to The Wedding Suite at Nordstrom's expecting a full-service experience that I didn't think I'd get elsewhere. I got a nearly no-service experience. It was completely non-productive appointment, my bridesmaid only got to try on one thing (not even from the bridal department), and the consultant seemed to have no interest whatsoever in catering to a plus-sized bridesmaid.  I am in need of a plus-sized dress for one of my bridesmaids. I chose to make an appointment at Nordstrom's Wedding Suite rather than David's Bridal because they had just as much selection in their bridal department plus off-the-rack items available in plus sizes. I should have just gone with David's. Where to start? When I called to make the appointment, everyone seemed really nice and I asked if a plus-size could be accommodated. They seemed very helpful and said they had plenty of styles for plus sizes, and that they could pull from the floor for any off-the-rack stuff. Great! When I got there with my bridesmaid (plus my mom and sister in law) and let the woman there know who I was, she took me back to the fitting area and just looked at me and said, \"So what do you want to do?\" Um...I kinda thought you could facilitate the process since you're the one who works here, but okay.... I explained to her what we were looking for and showed her a few items that I found on their site that I'd like to have my bridesmaid try on. She pointed around the dressing room where she had pulled just a few bridesmaid dresses, none in plus sizes, and no variety in style whatsoever (I think every one was a short chiffon strapless dress) and then said we probably wouldn't find anything upstairs in ready-to-wear because they were pretty well out, but we could look. So as we went upstairs, she starts leaning into me and telling me \"We can try but she's a *WOMEN'S* size, we can't do much for her.\" We find one thing (they *were* pretty cleared out, perhaps because it was near Christmas) to try on, and I ask if she can try on some of the bridal stuff, even if they don't have any in the color I'm looking for in-store. She says \"Oh, those are size 10, you can look but she won't be able to try them on.\" Okay...what is the point of just looking at styles you can't try on? I get it, they don't come in every color in every size, but seriously? ESPECIALLY in special sizes you want to be able to try before you buy (I know, I'm shorter than short, certain things just look weird on me even if they look normal on the rack). She tells me the only way to try on is to buy the item. So...I should buy seven different styles to try them on, knowing I'm going to return at least six of them? When I ask about whether there are things like shrugs to wear with dresses so that they can be a little more modest (every dress she even had out was strapless and would show a ton of cleavage), she said no, and basically was not helpful with suggestions at all. No \"our plus-sized bridesmaids really like this style\" or \"these undergarments work miracles\" or even \"I think you'd look nice in this.\"  She was very talkative about all kinds of other things, but not helpful at all with trying on dresses. To the point where, after my bridesmaid had tried on one thing and we just wanted to be done with this non-productive outing, we couldn't get out of the store because she wanted to keep talking about random things (this was not we're-waiting-for-someone-to-try-on small talk). It was like she wasn't focused on the appointment at all! And even though she wasn't outright mean and may have been trying to be discreet by whispering things to me about my bridesmaid's size and how she wouldn't fit, couldn't try things on, etc., it may me feel like a co-conspirator talking about my bridesmaid (who is also my sister, by the way) behind my back. It left a very bad taste in my mouth.  We went around the corner to David's Bridal, got an appointment right away, and the woman who took care of us there was much nicer. And they had several items in the right size! Don't waste your time if you're anything but a size 10."}
{"text":"Terribly run and incredibly rude sales associates.  It took me 40 minutes to find someone who would help me return a watch yesterday and several people were blatantly rude."}
{"text":"Why is it that every time you walk into a department store everyone ignores you? Perhaps I'm just accustom to good friendly service, but isn't that something you really expect. . . especially at higher-end establishments.  Really, it's not hard,  if you see someone perusing your section you:  1. walk up 2. say \"hi, can I help you find anything?\" followed by \"ok\" or \"well let me know, Ill be right over there.\"  or perhaps if someone has clothing in their hand \"can I start a fitting room for you?\"  See, it's not that hard.  Alright, so admittedly I wasn't here to buy as I'm currently broke,  however I was pre-shopping for family members who have no idea what's going on and wanted some recommendations.    I went to the jeans department and perused the selection of diesel and g-star.  IGNORED  I went to the men's suit section.  IGNORED  I went to the women's shoe department.  IGNORED  I perused the men's fragrances, and happily was not ignored (in fact they were downright pleasant and helpful!), although I was sent to the Dior counter where I wish I had been ignored.    I was greeted by a rather rude employee when I was looking to try Dior por homme (hey, I'm broke, but free samples is free samples).  He didn't understand, and showed me the women's line, then when I asked if he had anything else he stormed off, came back a few minutes later with three more women's tester and said \"there\"   Oh, and did I mention he just handed them to me without blotters, and then when I went to smell the nozzle he got snippy and  told me to use kleenex.  KLEENEX???  You've gotta be kidding me.  That's when it hit me \"Wait, there's a Sephora in this mall.  BYEEEEEE\"  This kind of service normally makes me give one star,  but they have lots of stuff.  So if you don't care how you're treated and don't mind carrying your clothes around like you're shopping at Wal-mart,  Nordstrom is fine."}
{"text":"Got some great items for great prices.  Love this place"}
{"text":"I ordered my first suit ever today, exciting huh?! I went to menswear completely lost. There was an older gentleman working their named Bob Gould. He had a formal wear down to an art! He eyeballed me, and was able to pick a suit that fit like a glove just by doing that.   Being 6'4 finding clothes that fit is hard enough as it is, I would have been lost without him. He had an amazing dry sense of humor, and I felt like he truly cared about me. On top of all of this he found me a fantastic suit by Calvin Klein for far below the price tag of 800 dollars.  After we found a suit that worked for me he measured me, so he could do custom tailoring. He even game me advice on how to properly wear it.  Bob Gould not only sold me a suit, he gave me an education in formal wear. I felt genuinely cared for, and will immediately go back to him when I get that special job, and need more formal wear.  Thanks Bob, you are truly the suit sensei!"}
{"text":"I ig-nord the people who told me department stores were dead, and headed in here anyway.  We probably spend the most time in Nordstrom out of all of the different stories we went in on an hour Beachwood mall walking tour for 4 hours. Me and the cutie I know in Cleveland. She picked the destination and all the stores, which was basically every store.  This is a huge department store with all the fancy expensive labels. It's nice to walk through. The employees are also fancy. If you're intimidated, just go to Nordstrom Rack for a cheaper, low key alternative. But I have nothing against this Nordstrom."}
{"text":"As usual, Nordstrom customer service knocks it out of the park. After a disappointing trip to Saks 5th Ave where no one even acknowledged our existence, we went to Nordstrom looking for a dress that I needed for an event Saturday night.   I was visiting my mom from Virginia, so we needed to find something that fit perfectly. After trying on what seemed like endless dresses with the help of Lynda Lovell in the Special Occasion department, I finally found a beautiful dress that was just a little too long.   The ROCKSTAR team of Lynda and the seamstress worked with me to hem the dress in an HOUR on a rush order to get it done for me in time. Lynda was truly wanting to help me find the perfect dress and went out of her way to make sure I felt confident at my first gala event in DC.   This is why I am a loyal Nordstrom customer......   Thank you Lynda!"}
{"text":"Nordstrom used to be a place for personal service. Well, no longer. The men's department in particular has gone down tremendously. I believe all of this starts at the top and trickles down. Sales staff exhibit a manager's interactions and vision. The vision here is why bother with the customer as we will have a job even if customers don't come in the store. Every year the service gets worse and worse and the atmosphere has deteriorated even more. The Nordstrom family should have sold the business when they had the chance. Now it's too late.  Arrogance leaves the brain numb for interaction s."}
{"text":"If you are looking for David Yurman Jewelry, you must see Denise at Nordstrom. She goes above and beyond to find you what you want. It's been a long time since I've had this kind of service in a retail establishment. Thanks Nordstrom for having associates who care.  And, thanks Denise for being there!"}
{"text":"The handbag selection is really small- some MBMJ, MJ, Burberry, very few Coach. Plenty of juicy couture bags though.  Young men's section is also really small, hidden in the corner of first floor. I remember I asked a store clerk in the men's section if they had Rag & Bone and she said she never even heard of it (!!)  Still, it's Nordstrom in Cleveland and for that I am thankful. However, I'd rather walk a few extra steps to get to Saks."}
{"text":"I shopped in the TopShop section for the first time.  Kylie, the girl who was working there seemed a bit shy and stand-offish when she first approached me, but turned out to be really friendly and helpful.  She helped me find a sweater and was very patient with me when I was trying on clothes.  I ended up buying a blouse, an oversize comfy sweater and a Free People button up.  Overall it was a pleasant experience...I just wish I had more money to spend on cute stuff!"}
{"text":"Pros:  good cafe, fab styles.  Friendly staff anticipates your needs.  You feel like you're in a REAL upscale place in the Men's department.  Men's wear was professional; we bought a snazzy \"mad men\" hat.    EXCEPT: Cons:  DO NOT go to this place's ladies' shoe department when they are having a sale.  It's akin to vultures in some sort of mosh pit.  Caw!  Caaaaw!   Shoes, boots, paper bits strewn about like people don't know how to pick up their messes.  Women grabbing shoes as if they will never again have the opportunity; all the while yakking on their phones.  The poor staff: I felt sorry for them, having to fit the cougar feet into the $1500 leather stilettos with the zebra print, zippers and metal spikes on the heels.  The shoe department was a mess!    They recently remodeled the whole store; it isn't as impressive as it used to be.  It looks cheaper.  It was set up like a Macy's.  The piano is gone.  That was very pleasant, seeing a fine musician play some live music as you walked by the escalators.   I don't know what they're doing to this place, but I wish they'd stop already."}
{"text":"Some jerks in the shoe department don't want to help me because I don't look like I'm gonna spend $1,500 on some pumps.  But I will spend $100+ on some comfy shoes that will also donate a pair to a child in need.    Big Mistake.  Big.  Huge."}
{"text":"I once enjoyed shopping at this location because of the exceptional customer service I received. I attended a beauty event today which turned out to be a waste of time and money. I had offered suggestions for improvement on this same event in the past and no one does anything about.  Nordstrom was once a place where shopping was an experience. Guided by a personal shopper I had been given either a drink or snacks while a wardrobe was picked out for me. That isn't the case anymore. Instead my reward is when I spend a certain amount of money I am given a \"monetary note\" to use for a future purpose. It even has an expiration date on it so I need to remember to use it.  People here are friendly and willing to help however, like other department stores, they are after your purchase to make their quota.  I only remain loyal to this store for the few whom I've known in those good years and will continue to give them sales only.  The only thing I find worthwhile is their restaurant Sixth and Pine which is a lot nicer than other Nordstrom's I've dined in."}
{"text":"As a avid nordstrom shopper I am very particular with my shopping experience.. I have always had a wonderful experience with their sales people and always walk out with something I didn't mean to buy.. Today I had a very different experience.. I went in to get a watch repaired that I purchased at a different location (I was in Ohio visiting family) and the sales lady all but ran away from me when I went to ask a question.. I was shortly told I need to take it back to my own store.. Ummm I will and I will let people know how horrible your service is!  I choose to shop where people treat them customers nicely, if I wanted a snotty sales associate I would go to a boutique!!"}
{"text":"I love this store. Always great customer service which will keep me coming back time and time again. They help you find things in store, order things they don't have and are willing to help if you want help or leave you browse if that is what you want. Neat and orderly displays always and clean store and changing rooms. Good sized and lit changing rooms too."}
{"text":"Oh man, this is one of the greatest shopping experiences ever. For sure, one of the most appealing reasons to shop at Nordstrom is because of the exceptional customer service and phenomenal selections. I Have never been in store with a more comprehensive clothing, shoe, and make up selection - Nordstrom rocks. When I was there recently I ended up leaving with three new pairs of shoes and was helped by one of the kindest people on earth. Truly, the staff there are exceptional in every capacity. My next stop was at the MAC counter and I ended up Selecting some of the new spring lipsticks - lovely and also helped by a delightful salesperson. My only qualm with the MAC counter here is that it is essentially grand central station as everyone wants to have the experience of shipping here- a testament to how great Nordstrom is."}
{"text":"Horrible service! I walked around looking at merchandise for over 20 min. picking up items and not one sales associate spoke to me. People that worked there looked at me and never said a word it was almost as if I was a bother to them. I'll take my shopping to saks fifth avenue where the staff is kind and knowledgable, not only about products but also how to treat customers."}
{"text":"Lindsay the manager is always extremely accomadating! Assistant managers Rachel and Ashley are always providing great service!!!"}
