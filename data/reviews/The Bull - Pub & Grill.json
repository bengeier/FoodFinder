{"text":"Great food.  Good drinks.  Although they didn't know what a Dark and Stormy was.  The Penne Jampalaya was awesome!"}
{"text":"I like the atmosphere of The Bull, the staff are great and make me feel at home there. Lots of screens so it's easy to catch any number of games at the same time, and they have 2 projectors for bigger games. 

Food wise, their specials are what I look forward to, but otherwise like the beef curry, the burgers are always good, and ahem, the beer is really outstanding too :)"}
{"text":"Will not recommend.went there the other night just the two of us in the bar ordered 2 drinks, received our drinks but  never saw the bartender again,  never even came back to see if we wanted  another drink it was like pulling teeth to pay the bill I do not recommend this place. Sad thing was it was a Saturday night it was just us two and two other people in the bar"}
{"text":"Not sure if I'm at a chuckee cheese or a pub.....I feel bad for all the people that will be sitting in the empty booths and \"enjoying\" their meals...you have no idea the amount of germs and footprints you are eating on. Absolutely upset with the management for not making this a better environment for all people. Oh...and service is super slow!!!! You are better off going to wild goose across the street or shebeen down the street!!!"}
{"text":"After playing a couple hours golf at the centennial golf center. Hunger ensued and i looked for the closest place possible. So glad to have found this place.

The decor is nice- with lots of seating in various styles (bar tables, dinner tables, booths and couches). They pretty much had an arrangement for whatever crowd and whatever event. Lots and lots of TV's.

Their menu is not the most extensive but it did have variety's of the same items- which makes sense. I had the burger and it was decent. My bun was cold which i dont prefer but other than that the portion, presentation and taste was great.

This place is a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Has potential to be a great sports bar with TVs throughout the bar ..service is what makes it a 2 star rating..bartender spends her time with her friends
If you are not in the clique then forget it go elsewhere..we struggled to get her attention if we wanted anything then gave up..but then had to wait for the tab"}
{"text":"This is my favourite place to be on a game night. Staff is very welcoming and friendly, and excellent Lve Dj on Saturday night. Many TVs to choose from with all sports so you never miss out! Will by my regular spot on Saturdays. Food is always fresh and wait times are prettt goof for food. Usually 10mins depending on what you order. LOTS of drinks to choose from and larage variety of Beer."}
{"text":"Excellent beer selection and menu. Potstickers were very tasty. 

Rikki was perfect. Never too far away but not hovering. And she was very nice. 

Nice place to come relax and watch some sporting events on the wall-o-Tvs."}
{"text":"I vaguely recall saying to my boss that it's time for happy hour. He took what I had said to heart and suggested that we go out after work on a Friday for drinks. 

Normally, he is interested in cheap, good eats. I did a Yelp search and found this establishment. It is a five-minute drive away from my workplace. I also learned from a Google Map search that there is a roundabout to endure to get to this establishment.

The Bull is located in a plaza next to McDonald's. We went in at around 17:30 and it wasn't too busy.

We got a booth. I ordered a Stella Artois. My manager went with an IPA. However, he doesn't know what he actually ordered!

He wasn't hungry (miracles can happen), so I ordered a pound of wings. I got four BBQ Korean, four honey garlic, and one mystery flavour, with veggies. 

The wings were yummy. The mystery one had a hint of heat. It was good. I was pleased that could do two flavours with my pound of wings. I enjoyed everything!

It's a cozy place to sit back and relax. The music wasn't overly loud, so we carried a normal conversation without yelling at each other. We hung out there for nearly 2.5 hours.

There is plenty of parking in the lot. After we parted ways, I decided to do a couple of laps around the roundabout before heading home. Fun!

I would definitely come back here. The washroom signs are cute, too. Both signs have a squirrel. The male squirrel has nuts and the female squirrel does not!

{"text":"I have been going to karaoke nights for the past few years.  I must say the host is amazing.  The restaurant has a great atmosphere, but the compliments end here.  The staff run around with their heads in the air, but the running around is pointless.  I have made a complaint to management and it seems they do not care.  Tonight was the icing on the cake.  I ordered nachos with chicken and guacamole.  Halfway through it was eating a mountain of bread.  I requested for something to be done and th server informed me that they are busy but she will at least have more cheese added to the mix.  Coffee was ordered and my complete glass of soda water was removed from the table.  Coffee came to me where milk added turned it green.  Obviously not fresh coffee.  45 minutes for someone to take my order is unacceptable.  I love the karaoke scene, but I will not accept bad service and food.  So this evening ordered items were sent back twice."}
{"text":"Great Local Bar with good food many beers and excellent service.

I ate/drank the Bar and had a great time."}
{"text":"Went to this pub for lunch shortly after the place opened and since the weather the rather was beautiful, we sat out in the patio! Though you should note that during the summer time, since there are trees around the fence, a lot of petals and stuff kept falling near by so that may get annoying. The pub inside is really big, can seat quite a bit of people. I know some companies hold corporate meetings here! 

A friend recommended the fish and chips here so I got one piece ($12) and it comes with a bunch of fries as the side (you can prob upgrade for a fee but I didn't opt for that), a small container of coleslaw and 2 small container for Tatar sauce / ketchup. Wasn't a huge fan of the fish & chips, I've had better but it wasn't too bad. Portions were big here though! Service was great, not too much to complain about his place. I would def come back and try other things if I'm in the area again!"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time on last Saturday for a quick bite. I ordered the chipotle chicken quesadilla. It was actually very very good. It was probably one of the better quesadillas I've ever had. I will definitely have it again. I also like the many tv screens there for sports fans."}
