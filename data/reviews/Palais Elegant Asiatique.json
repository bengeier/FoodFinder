{"text":"This is the most disgusting restaurant I`ve ever been to.  The service is horrible, incredibly slow and extremely rude.  The soup tasted like dog food and nearly made me vomit.  My girlfriend found not one, but 2 dead flies in her rice.  This place should be shut down."}
{"text":"If you don't speak Chinese, the service is slow/barely existent. Si tu ne parle pas chinois, la service n'existe pas. We ordered take-out at 11:10am right after opening (for 2 people) we were told 10-15 minutes. Food was not ready after 20 minutes, I was told another 10 minutes. Meanwhile two tables were eating and when I looked into the kitchen they were just starting my order! It took over 40 minutes and I wished I could have cancelled because I wasted my time and the food was low quality and super oily. The beef (hardly any) and broccoli was over cooked, beef was cheap cut, not tender.  The portions are small and the service was terrible. I will not recommend this place to anyone. Instead you can go to Chez Ping on Monk or Newman."}
{"text":"Pictures of food shown in the menu is misleading as it is far from the actual meals. The quality is below average, i ordered chicken wings for $9.99 and received 2 wings... unacceptable."}
