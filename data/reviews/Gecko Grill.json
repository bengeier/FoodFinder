{"text":"uhh.. yea.   So, I used to order lunch from this place about every other week, sometimes once a week, sometimes a little longer.  Usually there's never been a real problem until I called in a to-go order on a Saturday evening.   I gave the girl (who never identified herself) my order, she repeated it all back to me and said it would be 20 minutes.  I arrived 20 minutes later and went to the counter--only to be told that my order wasn't entered, and the two kids at the counter looked at me like they were deer in headlights--frozen in time and completely had no idea what to do next.  No apologies, no \"hey, let me get my manager..\"  NOTHING!!   Uh.. what??  Seriously?  I didn't have time to wait so I left.  Looking around, it was no wonder my order got lost in the mix.  For such a small restaurant--this place has WAY too many servers on a weekend evening.  These poor kids are climbing over one another to get to their tables and in server areas.  Still--even if Miss Unidentified couldn't get to a terminal to enter my order, I'd hope that she was trained to give an order to a hostess or manager to take care of so that customer service isn't compromised.  Oh wait..  not this time.

So--I requested a manager's email via the restaurant's facebook page, and it was promptly answered.  The person managing the FB page requested my email to pass along to a manager or owner to contact me so I could voice my concerns.  A few days pass, nothing.  I reached out again, and declined to give my phone number for someone to contact me because one method is plenty and if this restaurant's management actually cares--they will use it!   I still have not heard back from these people and they've forever lost a customer and whole office that would order food for lunch since it's so close.

Bottom line--management apparently doesn't care if there's a problem, or if they do, they certainly don't value the customer as much as they should.  I did not ask for a manager in the store because there was nothing they could do for me, unless they could produce my order out of thin air right at that moment, because I couldn't wait another 20-30 minutes for my food to be made.  There's a reason people call in to-go orders.    Total fail this time, Gecko Grill.   It would be in your interest to train/retrain your service staff on carryout ordering so that more situations like these don't happen."}
{"text":"Good American Mexican food. Good salsas and service has always been good. Just all around solid place to go. Only go during lunch.."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. We had a shredded beef taco, fish taco, green chili pork burrito and mini-chimi appetizer. Nice outside patio."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite Mexican restaurants.  Love the variety in the menu, especially the green sauces.  Have been to this new location and have always had good service."}
{"text":"My love for Gecko Grill can be summed up in three words: Shrimp. Mango. Quesadilla. It's a huge folded flour tortilla stuffed with shrimp, fresh mango, cheese and seafood sauce, and grilled to perfection. I've been ordering this dish off and on for seven years and it has never let me down - testament to the consistently great quality at this unassuming Mexican joint located in a strip mall.  

The salmon tacos (grilled salmon topped with fresh mango salsa and cheese) are also divine. But since seafood can be polarizing, some other faves include the new-ish fiesta chicken taco salad (grilled chicken breast, fresh mango salsa, avocado, lettuce and cheese), the beef, chicken or pork burro grande (with beans, cheese, guacamole, sour cream and salsa fresca) and the chicken fajita burro (grilled chicken breast, fajita vegetables and beans served with guacamole and sour cream on the side).

Chips are homemade, light and crispy, and both the red and the green salsas are superb. The creamy bean dip is a nice bonus.

And oddly enough, the barbecue's really good, too. (Before my son discovered he liked Mexican food, the BBQ pork sandwich is all he would eat.)

As for atmosphere...well, if you like pink -- and plastic flowers -- you're in luck. For the rest of us, the food is SO good, who cares about the d√©cor? Dining area and restrooms are always clean and the staff is excellent. (We had the same server every time we went for nearly four years until he graduated from college.)

Of note - only Pepsi products are on tap, so if you're a Coke fan, be prepared to pay by the bottle. The mango water is excellent; my mom gets it every time she's in town. If you still have room (which we rarely do), both the flan and the dessert chimis are delicious."}
{"text":"One of the worst experiences- if I could give zero stars, I would. . Although their food is not bad, their service is some of the poorest I have EVER experienced. We saw people who came in after us get their food which speaks to a highly unorganized kitchen, manager,  and waitstaff. When we asked to speak to the manager, she peeked her head around a corner and said I am very busy right now, give me a minute. I guess our money and patronage is not appreciated or wanted. We walked out, but left money for our drinks. I will never set foot in this restaurant again."}
{"text":"best mexican food i've had in AZ! I have gotten the street tacos each time I go there and am never disappointed. they are fresh and delicious. the staff are really nice and accommodating."}
{"text":"Best shrimp tacos in Phoenix. My wife loves...LOVES the pollo fundido. Great service. Quick refills. Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"One of my favorite local Mexican food spots.  Delicious and affordable food!  We stumbled upon this by accident because we had some random coupon and decided to try it.  

Favorites are the enchiladas the chimis and of course the street tacos. They are a sister restaurant to another awesome place, Morenos Mexican grill. So ordering a Sonoran hot dog is a must. So delicious.  

Great service too. We once ordered take out and they gave us the wrong order. We called them and they replaced our order quickly with no charge!   

We have also used them to cater a baby shower and they were awesome. All the food was prepared and fresh and all the guests were happy. 

Always a recommendation to out of town friends!"}
{"text":"Our family loves this place. Some of our favorites are the chicken enchiladas with green sauce and the chicken fajita burrito. I'm not a seafood person but my husband will often order the shrimp tacos. He loves the mango salsa they put on it. We love that you get chips, red salsa, green salsa and bean dip when you are seated. They replenish the chips and salsa no charge but if you want more bean dip you have to pay. I wish they would give you a little more to start with - that is my daughter's favorite part so it goes quickly. Most of the time service is great! We love that the weather is getting nicer so we can sit outside and enjoy their outdoor patio area. This place always seems to hit the spot when we want Mexican food."}
{"text":"2nd time lunching at Gecko Grill, great food, great service, great lunch"}
{"text":"My daughter and I ate at this location and loved the food and service!! The chips, salsa and bean dip were so yummy! And I typically don't care for bean dip. The mango quesadilla was the best quesadilla I have ever had!!"}
{"text":"I chose this place for a few reasons. 
1. I was craving Mexican food. 
2. I had a coupon. 
3. The yelp reviews seemed decent. 

Honestly, I should have known I wouldn't have liked the food when the complimentary chips and salsa were brought to the table. The green salsa was overly sweet and the red salsa had little, if any flavor. Yeah...moving on. I ordered the spinach enchiladas and the BF ordered the Crab relleno. The \"crab\" was actually imitation crab, which is fine, but it should be listed as such. The spinach enchiladas left something to be desired. 

Bottom line. I would have been more than satisfied eating Taco Bell. Yeah. It was that bad."}
{"text":"How does the food taste? I wouldn't know.  We waited an hour and a half before walking out.  Everyone else on the patio was served but our party of eight. Eight! How did you miss us?"}
{"text":"Horrible food and management. My husband and I both ordered a chicken salad with extra chicken. What we got was a bowl of lettuce with 1 tsp of minced chicken for $12 each. I am not in the habit of spending $12 for a bowl of lettuce, so later I called management (Denise) and asked for some sort of compensation. Denise left me on hold for 30 minutes. Finally the owner (Martina) got on the phone. After another 20 minutes, she conceded to give me a credit for 1 of the salads ($12) and said she would do that immediately. That was back on 11/20/16. By 12/6/16 I still had no credit, so I called back. No one would help and said that Martina would call me back. Today is 12/8/16 and Martina has not called me back, I have not received the $12 credit she promised me and I am not going to follow up with them anymore. Instead I am using my time to write this review. Avoid this place because you will not get what you pay for and they will do nothing about it."}
{"text":"Meh. It's ok. We wanted Mexican food and this popped up in the search. It's highly mediocre, and filled a hole in my tummy. Not very creative with the recipes, though. I can make what they served me at home. There are too many other places to try. I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"I host a happy hour every month for about 12 to 15 women in my community.   Sometimes we go to a restaurant and sometimes we go to one of our homes.  This month we decided to go to Gecko Grill. I went in the day before to place the reservation - and I was treated pretty rudely. When I showed up the following day I was treated rudely again.  The hostess never welcomed me - the second she saw me she started talking sharply to me.  At any rate, after I got home, I called the manager to tell her that I was unhappy about the way I'd been treated.  I told her exactly what was said to me and how it was said to me. She said she tell the other managers.  That's it.  She didn't ask what she could do to make up for the way I was treated, or tell me that shocked that I'd been spoken to so rudely or even say that it was anything out of the ordinary.  When I said that I'd never bring the ladies back to the restaurant she responded with a very disinterested \"Okay\". Not the kind of customer service I am used to or expect."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Gecko for many years, however I will not be going back anymore.  There are some very good dishes here...or at least there was. Now it seems that either they are not taking proper care of their meat, or just buying poor quality beef, or perhaps just using meat that has expired.

On the last two occasions I visited the restaurant, the meat had a bad taste (meat that has expired or not handled/stored properly). First dish was the tampiquena, the next dish I had a week later was the fajitas with steak.  I had a few bites and tried to cover up the bad tasting meat with guacamole, sour cream, salsa, etc.  However after a few bites, the steak made me sick to my stomach.  This also happened the previous visit with a different cut of meat (tampiquena).  I let the server know about the bad meat, and all she did was \"I will tell the cook\". No offer to replace or discount or refund the meal. 

The good:
chips, salsa, beans, southwestern corn

The bad:
bad meat, slow service, inattentive wait staff"}
{"text":"carne asada very bland!  Margaritas weak, and service was so slow! Don't get the hype at all. Also they want to charge you if you want refill on dip? Really!? Prices are comparable to a 3 or 4 star restaurant but food is comparable to fast food."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food and generally a short wait. We have come here multiple times since this location opened. We have enjoyed the food and like to sit on the balcony when the weather isn't too bad. The wait staff is young but attentive. We will continue to come here frequently."}
{"text":"My family and I go to to gecko grill all the time. They have great food with unique flavors and excellent service!"}
{"text":"Overpriced, small portions. They need to increase the size to make it work or lower the price. The food is good, but not when you can get a nicer meal for a better price elsewhere."}
{"text":"Thanks for coming back to gilbert!!  I barely made it through those couple of years without my shrimp tacos!  My only suggestion-- change from pepsi to coke products!"}
{"text":"Genuinely the best authentic taste profile for Mexican food at an affordable price in the East Valley. Humble environment where the owner still comes out to greet its Patrons. Nice decor, clean and quality minded Staff.
Traditional tasting food that reminds me of my mom cooking dinner (that Good).
Nice portions and they will even cook a variation of there Menu for you. I have egg Sopes every Saturday with Enchilada Sauce on top!"}
{"text":"We used to go the location on Gilbert Rd a lot, but they closed down. So yesterday we found the new location on Baseline. Boy, things have changed. The service was was not so hot. We(my wife & I) waited about 12 minutes for a server while  seeing others come in after us then getting waited on immediately. Finally we were waited on with no apology for ignoring us. Then, if that wasn't enough I ordered a tamale(along with an enchilada) that wouldn't fill up a ten year old. It was so small with very little meat. Unbelievable!!! NEVER AGAIN!!!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came with our friend. The service was very nice. The order didn't come out right the first time but they fixed it rather quickly."}
{"text":"I've continued to message and leave comments, even providing my phone number, and Gecko Grill still has failed to contact me to refund the original incorrect order, as well as fixing the issue with their cleanliness. Giving a generic \"we're sorry\" is not what I've been asking for now for months. Terrible management skills."}
{"text":"I probably go to gecko grill more then any other Mexican food restaurant, and I pretty much get the special chimi with the sauce inside and out. They also have good shrimp tacos."}
{"text":"Delicious food, friendly and helpful staff. I've been going to Gecko for years and they are just as good today as they've ever been!"}
{"text":"Salsa and dips are runny, look and taste bad.  Not sure how a place with mex food this bad can stay in business.  Go somewhere better, why eat crappy food?"}
{"text":"Very addicting!  I go there every chance I can!  Clean, open space, great service!  Amazing food!"}
{"text":"Do not do it! Food poisoning from delivered meal!

Reached out to this resturant thru social media text, and was told 'she' would call me shortly. This message was repeated the next day. The call only came  after 3 days - as my husband lay in a hospital bed, having had a heart attack after suffering over 50 hours of explosive diarrhea, nausea  and vomiting!  My husband is a hale and hearty man- I can not imagine what this would have done to someone who was not as strong."}
{"text":"Service was very good and so was the Food. Loved the green chili burro. Their been dip tastes wonderful."}
{"text":"Every time I've eaten at this restaurant, and the times I've called in a to go order, it has been the absolute worst customer service EVER. The employees are rude, lazy, and seem annoyed and inconvenienced about everything from start to finish. The food is decent, but the employees and service are horrible. I would not recommend."}
{"text":"This place is great!  It is probably my favorite mexican food in the valley.  I highly suggest you try the Arroz Con Pollo (aka chicken with rice for us non-hispanic).  Also, they have the best green salsa served with the chips but also ask for a side of cheese sauce, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Went to eat here earlier tonight, the atmosphere is over all very drab and not very inviting. Our server was really kind, and the service was great. The food? Not so much. I ordered the pollo fundido, and it was all good until I received a surprise halfway through eating. A curly, short black hair in the lettuce/cabbage mixture in the middle of the plate. I was immediately disgusted. A few people at my table were grossed out as can be, my waiter asked me if i wanted a new one but I just couldn't savor that again. I ordered a fried icecream as a consolation treat, a safe bet. I was incredibly disappointed with the icecream. it was drowned in whip cream (not usually a bad thing;) but it did make the corn flakes very soggy and gummy, an unpleasing texture. Need less to say I will not be dining here again, save your money."}
{"text":"This was a great choice for me tonight! I had been to the Moreno's on Arizona Ave. and thought it was good so I checked out their website and found this place.

When I got there the place was very busy. I was eating alone so it didn't take all that long to get seated. I had a nice convo with a guy was there with his significant other. That passed the time very well.

I looked at the menu and asked my very friendly server his opinion. After consultations were finished I settled on the Arroz Con Pollo. It was so good! My only complaint was there wasn't enough of it. 

The only legitimate problem I had was I couldn't access the Wi-Fi. My guess is there had been too many users before me and it needed resetting. 

I'm definitely going back!!"}
{"text":"Food here is great! It's not real Mexican food but it's good. I enjoying having lunch here. I recommend the chicken tamales and the beef nachos."}
{"text":"I had heard so many good things about gecko I had to go. Maybe had high expectations but I think the only thing I liked more than other traditional mexican grills is that they had refried beans with chips (some places also do that). Thought that their salsa was average, thought the \"sweet salsa\" was clever although I didn't personally like it. I always get shrimp fajitas and their shrimp was about the size of baby shrimp on a salad. I like some zing to my food and the salsa wasn't cutting it, they didn't have any hot sauces but had a super nasty taco sauce. Service was fine and everything else, I just didn't see any reason to come back because none of the food was good. My wife loved her burrito so i guess I'll have to try them again in the future and maybe order something else."}
{"text":"The food is fabulous (I love the Gecko Burro and Pollo Fundido...and the strawberries and cream--one word-- AMAZING), the service and location are awesome and their involvement in the community is so great! I love supporting a great business like this!"}
{"text":"Best tasting Mexican food. I've never ordered anything less than delicious! Service is great too! I wish they had more locations."}
{"text":"My family and I have eaten at this restaurant before. The food was ok but there was always a better choice for food after church.
We went there today because my mother in law said she wanted to try it again. We decided to try again and it was worse then the first time we tried it.
The chips tasted stale, the bean dip (which is the only thing that was good) was watered down. I decided to just get a side of rice and it tasted like plastic. It had no taste but the plastic bag it was probably sitting in all day. 
Every person at the table said their food was not good. Except for my son who got the grilled cheese. I would not recommend this restaurant at all. You are better off eating at mcdonalds. My family and I will not be back. It just gets worse. There are better options for Mexican food then this place"}
{"text":"I love the gecko grill. We go there about once every couple of months and have always had a great time. We take the kids and it's great for them too. The location is a little small, but the food is great...especially the bean dip, which I always order more of. The servers have always been great, especially helping to accommodate our kids."}
{"text":"Really our new favorite last minute dinner out place.  The food is very good, not the best we have ever had but very good, always hot and fresh.  Love the green sauce!  Casual enough for after practice for our family, nice atmosphere.  Servers have always been attentive and quick.  Definitely will be regular customers here."}
{"text":"Chips and salsa are great. Too bad the bean dip serving is tiny with payment for refills. Overall yummy food, good service and very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I came to check this place out today not even realizing it was cinco de mayo. We had to wait to be seated which was no big deal given the day. The food was pretty good. I had a burrito and my wife had a quesadilla and we both liked it. Everything just seemed to take longer than expected. We had our baby with us and she became pretty fussy towards the end but we still had to sit and wait for about ten minutes after asking for a box. The wait wasn't bad enough to give a bad rating, I hope it was just a symptom of the day."}
{"text":"Food is wonderful. Bean dip is the best in town. My favorite Mexican food spot. Come on a Saturday around 7pm. Waited less than 10 mins to be seated for a party of 2. Food was great. Now where they lose 4 stars we had to take our drinks up to the front to get a refill. Never once asked how are food was or if we need anything. Talked to manager all they said is they will talk to them! Which never happened because they never come to our table even after that. Please address issues I want to come back to good not too."}
{"text":"Great food I loved it!! Chips good not greasy and the salsa was awesome! Sure it might be a family place but the delicious food just keeps you coming back and believe me you can't resist. For all those alcohol guzzlers out there come on and give this place a chance,there has to be at least one restaurant in the whole world with no alcohol..Keep your cool and ohhh , i made a point of staring at the hostess to see if she was touching her face or anything...looking to see if she maybe had her cellphone hidden somewhere around there and guess what nope, nada!"}
{"text":"Awesome food.  Get the green salsa, I don't like green salsa but I love their green salsa."}
{"text":"This is a review for two visits that took place the end of December 2017.  Trying to catch up on reviews.  

Visit 1:  (12/2/2017)

Will give this visit 2.5 stars.  Second Saturday in December. Service was OK but not focused.  Seemed to change people a couple of times. 

Chips and salsa were \"ok\".  Wife an I both ordered sour cream enchiladas.  Well they don;t call it sour cream they call it crab sauce.  Both of our orders were served without any sauce.  After flagging down yet another server, we got two cups of sauce with the excuse that they were out and had to make it fresh...I am calling BS on that...then why send the order out with two lonely naked enchiladas?  
On the plus side the crab (sour cream) sauce was really tasty.  Rice and charro beans were also \"ok\".

Visit 2: ( 12/15)
Ordered the same thing as visit number 1.  Chips tasted as if they were three days old.  Broken pieces...burned chips and tasted awful.  No I didn't complain.  You know, sometimes you just want to relax and eat a meal.  

This time the enchilada's came with the crab sauce.  However they charged us $1.20 each for this sauce.  I told her last time there was no sauce.

This is not stated on the menu.  The server (again one of many) said \"oh they must have changed it.\"  The menu says enchiladas with ANY sauce.  Again...didn't want to argue over three bucks. 

Server should have taken care of this with management.  Bottom line....

You lost a customer forever.  As you know, most people just leave don't complain and never return.

Check the other posts here about service and consistency.  You cant survive forever on past reputation.

Good luck.  1.5 stars for this visit average out to 2 stars for both trips."}
{"text":"I get hooked on their chips and bean dip! Having spent time living in Mexico, I might not describe the food as truly authentic but it has a fresh, unique flavor different from other Mexican joints. The Shrimp Mango Quesadilla, the Tampiqueno and the fiesta tacos (with side of corn) are all worth trying."}
{"text":"After Christmas shopping one night I decided to stop by this restaurant.  I pass by there on a daily basis and it is always crowded.  When I arrived I noticed it was an awfully busy place.  I even asked one of the customers about this restaurant she said they are regulars, so I felt pretty confident in her opinion not having been there before. The staff appeared friendly, and the customers were being seated promptly.  I did order my food to go.  When I arrived home my family and I sat down to eat our food.  I noticed their salsa was very sweet, the pico de gallo was dried out, the tomatoes were shriveled.  I ordered a green chili chimichanga with pork and beans, which I was charged extra for the beans, and the meat since it wasn't shredded.  As I was finishing my chimi something in it looked awfully weird.  As I picked this foreign object apart I realized that there was a paper of some sort, it resembled a half sheet of a paper towel.  I immediately phoned the restaurant.  I spoke with the manager who was really nice offered me a credit towards my next meal. I opted out and wanted my money back. I had to again go to the restaurant to receive my credit  for only the chimi.  I was discouraged that my whole order was not credited since my whole family was grossed out at that point.  Unfortunately with that kind of an experience I will not be returning.  I actually took a picture of this foreign object. I would post the picture if I knew how to attach it."}
{"text":"I'm salty because they got my order wrong . Here's why: I asked for enchiladas with red sauce and cheese on the top with no ?cheese on my FRIJOLES (beans) and they got it wrong . This has happened multiple times . Is this what AMERICA  stands for?????  Maybe they do just not like me???"}
{"text":"I'll be short and quick. This is our second time here the first time food was amazing customer service was ok we were please that we decided to go back with the thought of getting delicious meals, but nop. 
I order nachos I had the craving for them and my wife order a veggie burrito . I'm sorry to say but the nachos were super horrible greasy blunt nothing there , circle k has better nachos for half the price they were gross my wife veggie burrito was also bad just no flavor nothing to be amaze . Very disappointing. Our waiter said that food comes out differently sometimes because depends on the cook who's making the food . No consistency at all in meals. Our waiter could care less. We eat almost nothing of our food just plane gross !! I'm going to have think twice about giving them my business . That's what happens when you try to support local businesses."}
{"text":"My wife and I frequent Gecko about twice a month. Never anything but the best food and service. Keep up the good work guys."}
{"text":"We love this local Mexican food restaurant. We frequent it often. I struggled between 3 and 4 stars because the food is typically very good. However, on almost every occasion the service is slow and very poor. For my first time ever, on my last visit, I left no tip. Service was just poor. They seem to hire servers either with no experience or servers that no one else would hire. Management needs to step up and train or hire better servers. Or hire better managers. This last experience was also the first time the quality of the food was not up to standard. Keep your food standards high and train your servers."}
{"text":"Had wanted to try them again since they re-opened, but sadly disappointed! Walked in at 8:30pm and they said they were closed. Then they said they could do take out. Really?!! You have an open sign out that says you don't close until 9:00pm and instead of taking customers you turn them away?! We can't seat you, BUT we can still make the food and take your money if you take it and leave. No apology or explanation or come back and we'll give you a free dessert- anything? Again 8:30PM not 8:55pm- Needless to say we won't be back. There are too many other options with better service and the food is just a cheaper copy cat of Tia Rosa's around the corner. I'll pay more for some place that actually cares about customer service."}
{"text":"Staff was friendly but the food was dry and bland at best.  Enchilada didn't taste right and the cheese they used was almost like a mozzarella cheese.... never had it that way before.  Their Carne asada tasted off..."}
{"text":"Heidy was amazing. I've had a hard time finding good Mexican food here since I moved from San Diego. Heidy recommended Tejano Burrito, which was very tasty. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I usually fill up on chips and their awesome bean dip but all of the entrees have been too good that I eat all of that as well. I really like the street tacos. I have only been for lunch, I plan on trying breakfast soon."}
{"text":"Friend and I visited after hearing a lot of positive reviews. On a beautiful November afternoon we opted to eat on the patio...BIG MISTAKE! While the food and service was good, the patio itself was filthy; napkins, straw wrappers, and food all over the floor. We were there close to an hour and there was NO attempt to clean up. Sweeping  as part of bussing the tables would be a big help."}
{"text":"We love the quality of food as well as the nice ambience of Gecko Grill. However, their customer service is seriously lacking. We have been there during the day when it was not crowded at all and during the dinner rush and you get the same service.  I am really sad that they cannot get it together and appreciate there Customers."}
{"text":"I love Gecko Grill, my family and I don't go out to eat much, but when we do Gecko Grill is one of the top choices.  I've tried lots of things on the menu over the years and am convinced that anything I order would be good.
I recommend the Chicken Mango Quesadilla!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed our food, except for the fish tacos which were nothing to write home about. I also had the arroz con pollo and the chicken was cooked perfectly although someone who enjoys onions would have enjoyed it more. Eric was a fantastic server and had no problems keeping up with my busy family. I give it 4 stars because I felt that the price was a little high. We paid $45 for two adults and 2 kids. Not ridiculously high but I would have expected a better meal for the price."}
{"text":"My favorite place for chips and salsa! They are served with red and green salsa and a side of smooth refried beans. The green salsa is my favorite as it is more of a sweet salsa rather than spicy.

I usually get the taco salad with shredded chicken and my son usually gets the kids bean and cheese burro. The chicken is very tender and juicy. Just the right amount to fill you up without getting stuffed. 

If you live in Gilbert, it is definitely the place to go for great Mexican food :)"}
{"text":"We love it! Stopped in for lunch today after golf and were seated immediately.  Drinks arrived promptly, along with chips, red & green salsa and bean dip. All delicious and fresh. I had the fiesta burro & my bf ordered the pick two. Scrumptious! We were very impressed. We have no complaints, and it is clear they all take pride in this restaurant."}
{"text":"I come here once in a while with my in laws, as they love it and get the same burrito each time. If you are a creature of habit and order the same thing every time because you liked it the first time you got it, this place will work with you if you get lucky with what you order. But I like to order something different every time and get disappointed a lot. I ordered a salad the last time I went and it was made with the cheap iceberg lettuce and wasn't very fresh. I have ordered the lettuce wrap taco before and that had been my favorite dish yet. My husband ordered the spinach enchiladas with the spinach cheese sauce and could hardly finish one enchilada because the sauce was too overpowering. My mother in law got the same thing but with the green sauce and loved it. They do have nice bean dip and green salsa with the free appetizer chips though, so I can usually try to fill up on those."}
{"text":"I had been encouraged to try Gecko Grill by my sister. I went for a lunch date with my husband. The restaurant was very busy but our wait was not exceptionally long to be seated.

When we sat down, they brought our drinks and chips and salsa ( the bean dip and green salsa were my favorite). We had a very delicious lunch. I got the chicken and mango quesadilla....smothered it with more of that green salsa:). My only complaint would be that we waited a really long time for our food and our check and ended up being there a lot longer than we would have liked to.  But other than that, it was a good experience."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast on our way home from camping at The Lost Dutchman. We ordered off the breakfast and regular menu. Everything tasted great. We LOVE the mini bean chimis with jalepeno cream cheese. Their outdoor seating is absolutely gorgeous, like a tropical garden. We were very happy with the service as well. Will definitely be coming back next time we are in this part of town."}
{"text":"The food is always good... nice and hot, presented well and has great flavor! A lot of the food has a sweet lends to it (pineapple and mango salsas) 
I'm a fan of the salmon lettuce wrapped tacos and my husband really likes the shrimp burrito! 
The service is always a little off ...the waiters are a little awkward and we don't usually get checked on after the food comes. But we like the food so we always come back! 

The patio was gorgeous this time of year (November)"}
{"text":"Even if the food was good I'm giving one star.  Our water glasses smelled like bad breath.  You know, that smell of your floss when you haven't flossed in a week?  Yeah, I know, it's gross.  I'm guessing that the dish washer is kicking up rotting food on the dishes.   Never going back."}
{"text":"This is THE BEST MEXICAN FOOD IN AZ HANDS DOWN, I can eat the pollo fundido over and over and over again. Don't forget about their Tampique?a !!!! I could eat that for days too ! Definitely a must try !!!! I would give it a 10 out of 5 if I could !!!!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Gecko Grill since it's opened. Food is yummy and their Vallarta and Salmon enchiladas are amazing. Never had a bad meal here in 17 years."}
{"text":"I eat here monthly and have been even before they moved from their last location back in 2008. 

Pros: Absolutely love the food. Fantastic taste and great prices. The people working are kind and hospitable. I've never had a negative experience with a server. I recommend the chicken fajita burrito.

Negatives: Ordering out is a pain in the butt. Every time I call the line is busy and a few times I haven't ever been able to reach the restaurant. I've spoken to employees about this and they think they only have one phone line. There has got to be a change at Geko Grill. Either get a couple other phone lines or get really fancy and upgrade to online ordering. You'll defiantly get more of my business if you do! Also I often use coupons and have to wait for a manager to approve it each time. One time he manager was no where to be found and I was unable to pay for about 10 minutes until the manager emerged from the bathroom.  A cashier/server should be able to approve simple coupons to ensure fast service."}
{"text":"Not impressed with the food. I ordered the ceviche, and it was just ok. Honestly, Filiberto's ceviche has more flavor than the one I had here. Service was spotty, but the waiter was amicable and friendly."}
{"text":"Just experienced the worst bout of food poisoning of my life this weekend thanks to Gecko Grill. This restaurant used to be one of the best places to eat in Gilbert years ago, but since they moved to this new location, the food has been inconsistent, the service has been terrible and there's no way I'm going back. My family has been Gecko Grill fans since they were in that tiny hole-in-the-wall on Baseline/Lindsay. Each of the 4 times we've gone in this past year our orders have been messed up, the service has been beyond slow and someone in our party wound up with food poisoning.  I couldn't be more disappointed."}
{"text":"Average, was good, really wouldn't go out of my way to come back, but if a friend or family wanted to go I'd still go and eat here. If I could give a half star I would give it a 3.5 but not a 4. Quality was good, ordered the Durango Chile Relleno, probably gonna have to be within 25 feet of a toilet at all times....no Bueno"}
{"text":"Love this place! Gecko Grill is one of our favorite places to eat. Love the salsa and bean dip. The Crabby burrito covered with the southwest cheese sauce....is the best!! Must try! Also try the salmon enchiladas. Very good. Oh can't forget about the menudo. You better be hungry when you order the big bowl."}
{"text":"This is becoming more of a regular for us. The enchilada sauces are gluten free which makes ordering a little easier on my wife. The pollo fundido is okay, a little dry, but still tasty. The red salsa is lacking in my opinion but they do give you beans and green salsa as well. I'm not a huge fan of any of them but they're all okay. I do recommend the arroz con pollo, which is just a little different than most places and has a great flavor. The chips are very good. The restaurant is very clean and busy, but they keep tables turning over quickly. Bathrooms are small but adequate and well maintained. In all a great little place."}
{"text":"Gecko Grill is my all time favorite mexican restaurant. I love the bean dip and green salsa. My favorite thing to order would be the fiesta chicken tacos! So delicious!"}
{"text":"They get 3 stars due to lack of service.  The past 2 times at the restaurant, service has been extremely slow. Had it not been for the great company of friends, I may have had a talk with the manager.  Being that the service was bad, the tip was in alignment with the service. The food was really good though."}
{"text":"We came here on a very strong recommendation of a friend and loved it!  The chips came with two salsas and a bean dip, all were very good.  I ordered the fish taco plate, one battered, the other grilled, both fresh and flavorful.  My husband ordered the tamales, one corn and one beef and loved them both.  The rice and beans were no nonsense and very tasty too.  Friendly service and the prices were more than reasonable.  Will return for sure."}
{"text":"This is an outstanding restaurant! The quality of the food is exceptional. The Fish Tacos are my favorite on the menu. The Mexican rice is made in the traditional manner and I like drenching it with their home made salsa verde. The chips are light and are great with the complimentary bean dip and fresh salsas. The prices are very reasonable and the staff is friendly. A well run business. On warmer days, the patio is awesome."}
{"text":"The food here is definitely authentic, they have a variety from tacos to seafood! Great margaritas too! Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"The 4 of us went there one evening for dinner as we were told that it was good Mexican food. The wait was only about 10 minutes. The restaurant is loud with lots of people having fun. But the talking seems to bounce off the walls. Not bothersome too much but just be prepared that it won't be quiet atmosphere.
The server was super nice but I can't seem to remember her name. Felicia maybe? not sure that is right. Oh well, but she was super attentive and friendly. The margaritas are good but not heavy on the alcohol at all so for the price of them I would next time decline. The food was superb. I had the spinach enchiladas and they were really good. The burrito a friend had was super large and looked yummy."}
{"text":"When we asked for more salsa and bean dip with our chips, we were told we would be charged extra? I ordered a cheese enchilada and asked if it came with onions. 'No, I would have to charge you extra for onions....'  Food was just average... Too many other great Mexican restaurants in the area... Would recommend you go to one of them!!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to see that this restaurant re-opened... Unfortunately that was short lived :-(  Took our family of 5 there tonight for dinner. Service was very poor, I think we actually offended our waitress by asking for drink refills! Food was was too salty and we all left with stomach aches. The salsa's were good... But they charged 1.89 for about 2 tbsp of mango salsa :-O.  After they nickel and dimed us we left disappointed .. And will not return"}
{"text":"My husband and I went on a friday night ...busy wait was 15 minutes not bad. We both already knew what we wanted reviewed the menu while waiting. The waitress was nice. Very busy place ...long wait for food. Ordered chimichangas and street tacos plate. My tacos were so salty one taco was cold wierd !  Although the food wasnt perfect i probably wont return due to not feeling well after eating here!"}
{"text":"Used to come here years ago when it was run by the previous owners. Never ate mexican food here. Only came here for the ribs. When the new owners came in they bought the recipe and it was done really well. The ribs are the best I have ever had. I have not been here in the last year so I don't know if they have kept up the quality. Can't speak for the mexican. I think there ribs are the hidden gem here."}
{"text":"I'm having a tough time rating these guys. The service wasn't good at all. They bring out chips, salsa and bean dip. For 4 people they bring out small salsa and bean dip containers which you can barely fit some of the chip in. When we asked for additional bean dip he said because we had 4 people we are only allowed one and that it would cost $1 for another. 
My wife had the salmon enchiladas which she loved! I had the Burro Grande shredded beef burrito. The presentation was very bland. Inside the burrito it was stuffed with guacamole and not much else. There was a very small amount of actual shredded beef. 
The other 2 people we went with loved their food. So while I wasn't impressed with my food or the service the other 3 were. So I gave them 4 stars. If it had just been me...probably a 3!"}
{"text":"Crab enchiladas with sauce were excellent. Guacamole though seemed pre-packaged rather than fresh. Good fresh guacamole will always in my opinion make the restaurant a step above the competition. I will be back to try breakfast. Well worth a try for anyone looking to try something or somewhere new."}
{"text":"Some how we have become regulars to this place because it's so good. This place has the best Mexican breakfast. The Chorizo Omelet is delicious, as well as the French Toast.  Dinner is really good. I recommend the beef tacos.  The chips and salsa are perfection.  Always great service and food."}
{"text":"We went here with some friends.  Didn't ever hear of it.  We got there, nothing fancy.  Sat down and they served us up some salsa and chips.  The tomatillo (green) salsa was sent from heaven.  The red salsa and bean dip were \" 'ight\", nothing special.  Back to the green stuff...it comes in the smaller container, ask for a bigger one, the stuff is hella good.  Now, I get the Fajita Burro (chicken) everytime.  I got the popular shrimp dish once, it was good, but I'm sticking with the Fajita Burro.  I like this place more than a popular Mesa restaurant that rhymes with \"Ria Tosas\".  The food here doesn't taste too smokey.  I come back often."}
{"text":"I was sad and disappointed to see that Gecko Grill closed!  I was out with my friend and we were both craving fish tacos and Gecko Grill immediately came to mind.  We show up and all the signage is turned off and it looks emptied... sad.

Well, just so you know what you were missing.. I'll share.
The only thing I ever ordered from here was their salmon, fish, and shrimp tacos.  They were wildly inventive!  Besides being cooked well, they had this yummy fruit salsa (mangos, pineapple, cilantro, onions, etc) that varied on each seafood taco, but was always so complimentary.  I have not been able to find salmon, fish, or shrimp tacos with a fruit salsa THAT good... that is a huge bummer to me.

I went once with some other folks and, unfortunately, it seems their tacos were the only good thing.  My husband had some carne asada tacos and sides and found everything on his plate was sub-par and so did my cousin... so, that's where you get 3 stars.. plus the place inside was kinda creepy pink.... it was a very un-appetizing color."}
{"text":"It REALLY bums me out when a restaurants food is ruined my horrible customer service. Sadly, this restaurant isn't even on my \"I'll just get the food because I like it and expect the service to suck\" lists. Not even worth it. I called in an order to go and I was told 15 minutes or less. I arrive around 15 minutes later when it should be ready and the girl at the counter 1. Didn't acknowledge me, 2. Was in the way of everyone else who was busy doing their jobs 3. Was preoccupied with standing at the counter texting on her cell phone. I mean, really? I'm actually surprised none of the other employees told her to get off the phone and work because I could tell they were having to pick up some of her slack. I finally get her attention and say that I have an order for pick up and she says \"you'll need to wait.\" Just like that, with a bad attitude and an extremely unwelcoming facial expression at that. So I take a seat next to the counter to wait. Mind you the place isn't busy. There's one couple waiting for a booth to open but there were many places to be seated. After waiting for about 10 minutes I stand up next to the counter and again, not acknowledged. I ask her if she could check to see if my order was ready (she didn't even ask my name when I originally arrived) and STILL texting on her phone says to herself \"oh I didn't check you out.\" A woman who seemed to be the manager asks me what I ordered, told me it was ready and gave my bag of food to the cashier. As I was grabbing my money she got back on her phone texting AGAIN. Her being young and society's technology is no excuse. I can't believe she wasn't coached on proper customer service etiquette and extremely surprised that the management staff allows you to be on your phone while dealing with customers. Needless to say, this was extremely irritating. Didn't get an apology from anyone and the cashier didn't even thank me after I had paid. Sheesh, be warned. Can't stand the hassle of poor service even if the food is good!"}
{"text":"Service here is not good.....little tiny bowls of salsa!!!!  Really?????  My last trip....over this place....."}
{"text":"Wonderful bean dip that is complimentary! The horchata was also yummy!! Very nice service as well!"}
{"text":"I love Gecko Grill and have been numerous times love the shrimp dishes. Its a small gem of a place with good food and great service."}
{"text":"Like many others, I will also say the take out service is poor. We ordered a burrito and mini chimichangas (which come with 6 mini chimichangas) over the phone and they confirmed the order correctly back to us. When we went in to pick up the order and they said our total would be $83. My wife was at first shocked and asked them to repeat the amount, to which they replied the same amount. She asked how a burrito and mini chimichangas would cost $83 dollars, which they then explained the made us 6 regular chimichangas and a burrito! We told them that was an incorrect order, which made them upset and they were resistant to let us redo the order, while seeming surprised we didn't want to pay that amount. As they ended up redoing the order, there were many sighs, and whispers back and forth amongst the cashiers in Spanish as they redid it. 

We then waited another 15 minutes for the new order, got the bag, and left... only to realize when we got home that they processed the order incorrectly, again! They gave us an extra order of mini chimichangas (which wasn't made to how we ordered the originals, so not sure where it came from) and charged us an additional $10! 

I try to give people the benefit of the doubt, especially in a restaurant, but to get an already very incorrect order wrong again when you redo it, overcharge the customers, all while sighing and being visibly upset about customers not wanting to pay $80+ for a $20 dollar meal, was too much for us on this visit, which will be our last visit."}
{"text":"My daughter and I were heading to another place for lunch when I spotted this little gem in a mostly empty strip mall. The name sounded familiar, so we decided to stop here instead. There were a few other patrons waiting for tables inside so we opted to sit on the patio where we could be seated right away. The whole restaurant is really clean and the patio is no exception (although once a large party with multiple kids who were sitting on the patio left, it took them awhile to clean up). Once we were seated I quickly looked up what other yelpers had to say and it looks like this location is pretty new.

I ordered a simple bean and cheese burrito, enchilada style and and iced tea for myself, and my daughter got the kids chicken strips with fries and a chocolate milk. The food came out pretty quickly. As we were waiting, the server who was bringing out the food came to our table a couple times to ask if other orders were ours. I also noticed that a couple of the servers were unsure of who another table belonged to so it seems like there might not be a system for the patio yet. This didn't bother me, but the ladies at the table next to us were annoyed because they were in a rush.

My burrito was alright, great tortilla, filling was hot and stayed warm, but the enchilada sauce was a little too thin for my liking. The chicken strips were warm but not steaming lava hot like they always seem to be everywhere else (this is a good thing because they were for a starving five year old). My daughter said the chocolate milk wasn't chocolatey and asked for water instead. My iced tea was okay but tasted a little dirty.

The price was okay...our bill came to just over $14. I don't have much of an incentive to come back (Dos Gringos is across the street and kids eat free all the time there), but the place is cute and since they are new, I would give them another shot."}
{"text":"Gecko Grill has Gone down hill from the old location on Gilbert Rd. We visited the Gilbert Rd location weekly, the location on Greenfield has terrible and slow service and the food has taken a big hit also.  We rarely visit the restaurant any longer as the food isn't good enough to overlook the poor service.
On a recent visit my daughter had her 6 month old son and wanted avocados or guacamole for him.....She asked the waitress what ingredients the restaurant put into the guacamole as her son has terrible allergies.  The waitress said \"nothing but avocado and spices\", my daughter ordered a side of it.  As soon as it arrived she gave the baby a few bites of it and within minutes his face started blowing up and blisters started coming to the surface.  she called the waitress over and she then informed my daughter there is milk in it....... My grandson has a severe dairy allergy, she hurried up and grabbed up her stuff to get the baby home for a bath and medicine.  The waitress didn't apologize AND SHE CHARGED FOR THE GUACAMOLE.  
Later when everything settled down my daughter called and spoke to the manager, NOTHING was offered except a simple.....\"I will speak to her and let her know that she needs to be more careful\"    WOW thanks for the great service Miss Manager......NOT!!!!!
Go to Tia Rosa or Mattas or La Ristra or Serrano's..........basically everyone has better staff!!"}
{"text":"We recently ate at the Gecko Grill because we had a coupon in our Entertainment book. We were surprised at how popular this place was! And its no wonder, because the food is really good. They have a combination Mexican/BBQ menu. I had a chicken burrito that was delicious. 

The only drawback of this restaurant is the absence of alcohol on the menu. A nice, cold Corona to celebrate the end of the work week w/ my Mexican food was much needed and I was disappointed. Also, because it is so busy people are forced to wait outside, and in the Arizona heat that is no fun w/out at least the ability to order a soda to sip on. 

Overall though, the food is excellent, the service prompt, and the people friendly."}
{"text":"I love this place, I mean it rocks the taste.  My gripe is the bean sauce (which is extremely addictive) so no issues there either.  So this review is really about the bean dip.  OK, so they charge .99 cents for each additional refill in the small cup, what bothers me is that you can place an order (that would come with bean dip in the dining area) but will not give you ANY bean dip if your order is to go.  I find this a bit cheap on their part and was given no real explanation as to why.  So I spend the same amount of money but no bean dip.  Kind of feel like I am being penalized for taking an order to go.
I will go back, the food is awesome but I will not spend any money on orders to go as I do not like lack of accommodation with my full combination meal.  They know who I am and I love them all to death but this is a bit of a letdown.   I bordered on a 3 star review but opted for the four."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Just heard about it's re-opening on Facebook and had to check it out! When I arrived I noticed that I wasn't the only one who must have heard about them re-opening. The place was packed! It was well worth the wait. The service and staff were very friendly and prompt. Had the Crab Relleno and was loving every bite of it. Their bean dip and green salsa is also awesome! Was so impressed with the food that night I went back 2 days later to indulge again. Will definitely be coming here often."}
{"text":"We're craving some Mexican Food. Cantina Laredo was a lil far from where we were, so we opted for Gecko Grille.

We ordered Nachos Supreme Asada. We love that the chips were thin and flavourful, and crunchy. However, the meat were overcooked, rubbery, and salty. For the price, it was not worth it.

The place was a mess when we arrived. There were wet seats, tables were dirty, and music was a lil loud to carry a normal conversation.

Our server was pleasant, a lil slow, but pleasant.

Overall, It's just ok for us."}
{"text":"Love their chicken and shrimp tacos! I ordered mine with no cheese and doused it with their red salsa. Perfect amount of sweet and spicy since the shrimp tacos come w/ pineapple mango salsa on it. Their tortilla chips are not that impressive or I'd give 5 stars."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy. Had the mango chicken quesadilla. Pleasant staff and surroundings. Lovely courtyard"}
{"text":"I was pretty skeptical about the place before entering and I had every right to be. The service was alright. One woman was really nice but never really came to check up on us; no one did for that matter. The bean dip is good but the other 2 salsas were a little bland..I kinda forced myself to eat it. I ordered a veggie burrito and the person with me ordered something with crab. Her food was okay, the crab was so artificial though and definitely not worth $10. My burrito was literally a mush of beans and I couldn't even take another bite. Sadly wouldn't eat here again!"}
{"text":"Love the gecko grill! I've been here a few times and have loved everything I've tried. Their menu offers the mexican food basics but does them without the excess lard/oil. Their cheese bean dip is out of this world delicious! I have friends from out of town that wish they could bottle it up and take it home! The only missing feature is alcohol! That said, we always see lots of families bring their kids here... so its great for that!"}
{"text":"The meal last night at Gecko Grill was wonderful. The crab stuffed chili rellenno was amazing and the shrimp quesadilla was perfect.   I will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Great food & nice  staff !

Hollie has been my server the past two times . She's very friendly and has a good memory! She remembered me and it felt good ! 

I really like their bean dip served with chips and everything else I have tried has been quite yummy . Food is always fresh and hot ! My friend said they have the best hot dog; so that will be my next choice for next time. 

This is my place to go to before I get my hair done and I'm quite happy I found it !"}
{"text":"I have no idea how it took this place over half an hour to make my breakfast. I was in at an odd time, 10:30 in the morning. Due to the hour (between breakfast and lunch) I was actually the only customer. Yet it took a solid half hour for them to bring me the fairly simple eggs, beans and hashbrowns that constituted the menu selection that I ordered. I literally went through two bowls of salsa and one and a half bottles of Coke waiting. The food was okay (just okay), so it wasn't a total disappointment, but I surely wouldn't go back based on the experience."}
{"text":"Went in today with great expectations per prior reveiws. Eh mediocre food. Chicken in taco was dry and bland. Service was so so. Won't be returning. sorry."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for authentic Mexican food! They have endless chips & salsa but you have to pay extra for a re-fill of their awesome bean dip. They only have fountain Pepsi products but they do offer cans of Coke products. Their plates are huge and everything is under priced.  They usually have a long wait during dinner and only have a tiny area inside for you to wait.  They do have seating outside but no outside dinning."}
{"text":"This is an absolute wonderful place! The food is delicious, the service is speedy and efficient, it is quite a roomy restaurant, and the patio is beautiful."}
{"text":"Great place for dinner but also very good for breakfast. Most people wouldn't think Mexican for breakfast but this place is one of the best. They've got a great variety and their Hash Browns....Your Way is fantabulous. Their staff is continually pleasant and attentive and I have never had even a subpar meal. Any meal of the day is great at Gecko's!"}
{"text":"My family and I went there for breakfast today, and after asking our waitress why our meal is taking to long, she answered with \"well we are not really a breakfast place\" ok so why do you have a breakfast menu? And after our meal got there they forgot the pancakes and I had to actually go up to the counter and ask for it. The food is good, but servers need training."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst Mexican Restaurant I have ever been to.  Went there with the kids for Father's Day.  Service was slow and they hardly ever came around to fill our drinks.  We ran out of chips and salsa and had to ask for more.  Salsa had no taste and all and we had very few chips for four of us and had to wait for the bean dip.  We were told that they were making more salsa.  Come on folks, what's with that???  You are a Mexican Restaurant and don't have your salsa made prior to opening?  I had the Quesadilla and it was lousy.  No cheese, or very little and lacking meat and flavor.  Have had better at Taco Bell!  My husband had the Fiesta Burro and it lacked taste and chicken was dry.  Not served with any rice or beans like most Mexican Restaurants.  One word to you, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY TO EAT HERE!!!  Will never come back there as there are many better Mexican Restaurants than this one.  If you want real Mexican, try Nando's, it beats this place hands down."}
{"text":"They are so friendly!
Immediately when I walked in, everyone said hi and hello to me. There was no wait and we were immediately sat at a table.  They brought over a basket of chip with 2 salsas (red and green) and a bean dip. I really liked the salsa verde. It was slightly sweet, maybe with a hint of garlic?
The menu was pretty big. I did not see any lunch specials. I ordered the mini chimichangas with chicken and beef. My husband ordered a carne asada chimichanga with a side of rice and beans. My boys order a cheese quesadilla with fries. 
My chimichangas came 6 on a plate with guacamole in a tortilla cup on a bed and of shredded lettuce. I was pleasantly surprised that these only had shredded meat in them, no sauce or rice or other fillers. I thought these were very delicious and filling. I ate 3 and was stuffed. 
I will come back here again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Lunch was wonderful. The Chicken fajita was full of flavor and the onions and peppers were still sizzling when it came to the table. The bean dip was served warm next to a red and green salsa. The chips are light and crisp, perfect for the salsa. We will definitely stop there again the next time we are in the east valley."}
{"text":"New location and still great food, but the wait and service is still working out the kinks. Hopefully it can only get better. To there defense I was there the week they opened. Plenty of helpful happy staff it just took forever and they were out of items. Shrimp Burrito is awesome."}
{"text":"HOLY YUM! What a beautiful place and what FANTASTIC food. My co-workers and I met for breakfast and WOW....impressed with the look, taste and price of it ALL. The Egg-chiladas were AH-mazing and the French toast was perfectly spiced and cooked. 

Waitress is friendly and the owner came over to say hello. It's apparent they're proud and it shows. 

Can't wait to come back for dinner on their awesome patio! So happy they opened here in Gilbert, just a few blocks from my house."}
{"text":"This place serves great chips and salsa as a complementary starter. The disappointing news is that - that was the only good thing out of everything that we ordered for dinner. The chimichangas were bland - no flavor at all! Even the burrito did not have any spice or sauce in it which could make it more edible. I would recommend the manager to seriously revise the recipes to make the food more exciting and flavorful!"}
{"text":"yelp suggested it and it's out of business!! there was a note on the door saying the landlord was taking back the property."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOOOOOOVE gecko!! I would drive there from Scottsdale at least once a month! Sadly, I don't have anyone willing to take a 45-50 minute (one way) drive for Mexican anymore. If you do go, I highly recommended bowls and bowls of the green salsa! I would order two tacos (usually a steak and fish/shrimp) and only eat one because I'd fill up on chips and salsa ...that was always the plan!"}
{"text":"Delicious!  You will not be disappointed here. We frequent this place and I haven't had anything I didn't like. I often get take out as well. Order is always quick and spot on."}
{"text":"I ate here religiously, unfortunately a week ago my husband had some old cheese or meat in his enchilada. I ate already finished my meal which was the same as his, he was halfway done with his, and he nearly threw up from the soured taste. It had such a foul smell!!! I called Gecko informing them of the situation, the manager immediately said, \"I've been here all day and not one person has complained! We have used the same batch all day!\"  We were not looking for a hand out of any sort! Like I said we are there every single week, we felt it was our obligation to inform them of this potential health risk of spoiled food. So i began to get very upset with her comment and told her I would bring her the food to smell for herself. She admitted to the smell but repeated herself about no one complained all day!  I was very upset with the way she handled the situation. As a customer who are there often, I would have appreciated a sincere apology not compare my experience to others! After that incident I will not eat there for a while, if ever. Poor customer service on that particular managers end."}
{"text":"I love Gecko! They are always friendly and consistent. I have so many favorites on the menu that can be made just how I like them. I love the patio seating too. Try the veggie burrito with sour cream on the side or the Tejano Burrito, and I love the corn tamales !"}
{"text":"This time we went for lunch to sample their lunch/dinner entrees.  We are looking for a \"go to\" Mexican restaurant close to our home that we can frequent whenever the desire for Mexican food hits us.  Today we tried their carne asada and cheese enchilada plate, that comes with rice and beans, and two muffin sized tortilla cups of pico de gallo and guacamole.  It was very good so now we have a new \"go to\" place!"}
{"text":"I have been eating at Gecko Grill since 2000. My favorite thing to get there is the Southwest Shrimp Burrito.  I always ask for an extra cup of green sauce to pour on top of it to make it even better.  Doing that will make it a little sweeter but it is real good. The chips and bean dip are really good to. 

The service has been really good for me there too. No complaints that I can think of."}
{"text":"I absolutely love gecko grill. Their chips with bean dip and choice of salsas are amazing. I had the enchiladas (one chicken, one pork) with the green sauce and was very impressed. Our server was charming and funny and kept the chips coming. Every employee who walked by checked on us (Not always talking to us, but clearly checking to see if we were in need). I will be a regular here."}
{"text":"We waited 35 minutes on a Friday night to be seated out on the patio. The furniture on the patio could be a little bit more comfortable ..but it was okay. This is our second time that we have visited and my husband and I feel that the food is okay..not the best or amazingly good, but the servers are attentive and we did not mind the food that we ate."}
{"text":"Wish we weren't hungry enough to take that side table by the front, but unfortunately, we did! I repeat, do not make our mistake and sit at the little table by the front!!

Other than that, the food was delicious. My husband got mini chimichangas with guacamole and loved them. I got the taco salad with fajita steak. The fajita steak was seriously so juicy and delicious! Probably the best steak and Mexican salad that I've had in a very long time. 

I would definitely recommend checking this place out if you haven't and try to sit on the patio since it's cooled down here! The patio's ambiance looked amazing - sigh."}
{"text":"Came here because of a bad experience at florindinos... ( I should have known better) the food here is always amazing.  The staff is very attentive and the place was packed! (it's almost 2pm on a Wednesday!) my server was busy with larger parties but my drink was never empty! (Araceli) I've never had a bad experience here!"}
{"text":"The best! Excellent food, great service. Chips and salsa are the best! Staff is super friendly, and the back patio is so nice. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I got the shredded beef burrito and taco meal. It was good but was not traditional tasting. It had its own interesting flavors. Not bad just different. I would go again."}
{"text":"Solid menu options, food is priced reasonably for the quality, portion, and authenticity. They do serve menudo on the weekends, not sure about during the week. 
They have a sweeter green salsa and also offer a bean dip for chips which are great options for kids while waiting for food. 
The patio is awesome when the weather permits, it is covered outside but on a hot day there are also fans & misters up to cool the patio down."}
{"text":"Love Gecko Grill:)  Love their salsas and really fresh tastes.  The veggie quesadilla is great.  Their wait staff is great and since they have all been there for a while I assume they are treated well."}
{"text":"Loved the street style tacos.  Everyone liked the chips and bean dip, but if you want more dip..... you have to pay for more.  Overall a good experience"}
{"text":"I must be the only Gilbertan who doesn't have a love affair with Gecko Grill. I just caught wind via Facebook that this place is closing (although probably temporarily, while they seek a new location). It really wouldn't surprise me if the place closed for good, judging solely by the quality of food and service. But I suppose it has a large enough fanbase of Gilbertans to keep it floating.

Anyway, my numerous experiences here have all had a similar flavor. Just ho-hum. A measely 5/10 on the food, and 4/10 for service. The place is small, and there's usually a wait for that mediocre food and sub-par service. I always go with an open mind, and always leave disappointed, until I just stopped going altogether."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food ever! I have been going to this restaurant for years and i love the new location. The food tastes just the same and I wish I could go every day.

I always get the chicken mango quesadilla. It is very popular for a reason ;)"}
{"text":"Horrible Sunday brunch. After a 20 min wait they serve 2 out of 3 of us. They tell my son they have no Menudo. The menudo they gave me had no actual menudo. They brought us a Sonoran Hot Dog without an actual HOT DOG in the middle..who does that? They forgot spoons, tortillas and condiments. I finally got up to look for a manager. Walked her outside to show her the food and discuss the terrible service! She literally said, i have no explanation, walked away and never returned! WTf! We have spent tons of money at geckos and nothing to this extent has ever happened. I was waiting for Ashton Kutcher to jump out and yell \"You been punkd'\". Unfortunately, it was just a horrible experience made worse by a terrible female manager with no service skills what so ever. Epic fail. Yelp, you need negative stars!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  So glad it came back.  Cannot beat their Vegetarian Burrito, Chimichanga and Enchilada style!  Cannot go wrong with anything on the menu.  Portions are more than enough.  I always leave with leftovers or an (over)stuffed belly.  Plus, they give you bean dip with the chips.  Yum!"}
{"text":"What a nice place, good ambience, helpful staff, great chips with dips and the food was awesome. We had the chicken and shrimp plate, my god it was a lot, shrimp and a chicken breast in a chipotle sauce, with rice, salad and steamed veggies. I admit I was stuffed, my wife took the remains of her home for later. Really good food."}
{"text":"Love their food, the only reason I gave 4 stars was because when they moved to the new location they stopped serving their wings which were my favorite dish."}
{"text":"Went here today and I thought that the chicken tacos were pretty good. They were great on bringing out chips and salsa as well. Not the best salsa but decent.  Didn't even have to wait long for a party of 9 which I'd rare. The wait staff were very friendly as well! Most of my favorite mexican restaurants are closed on Sundays so I'm glad there's a decent one I can go to lol."}
{"text":"Last chance. This place is so disorganized. 1. They are very busy. Good for them, but get staff that can handle it. I give this place 2 stars because the food is actually good, but the staff is lacking. We went in tonight.  First off we were over looked by the hostess who was hardly paying attention to what was going on or who was coming or going and reached over us to help someone waiting for takeout! Table for two, outside is fine. Easy enough right? Wrong! Two large groups 6&12 came in after us as well as a family of 4. After roughly ten minute (which was the wait time we were given) The family of 4 and the party of 6 were sat before we were!"}
{"text":"Posted hours are until 9:00pm. Walked in at 8:31 and was told we couldn't be seated because they were closing at 9:00 and were only accepting \"to go\" orders. Have never had this happen before. Will never set foot in this place again."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times before and quickly became obsessed with the bean dip and the green salsa. Then I ordered the salmon taco which has mango salsa and oh my gosh SO good! I don't live in the area so I only get the opportunity to eat here a couple times a year. I most recently went for lunch and ordered my usual. Later to be told they were out of salmon! What the?! Day ruined! I opted for the shrimp taco instead but asked for mango salsa instead of the usual pineapple. It came out with pineapple. Decided to keep it. And after I got done eating the super sweet server comes out with a shrimp taco with mango salsa. But too little too late. And bummer I live too far to bring it home. But he felt bad about the whole thing and took care of our entire bill. Super disappointed about missing out on my favorite taco but pretty pleased with the service. I will definitely call ahead to make sure they they aren't out of salmon next time."}
{"text":"WARNING:  If using a buy one, get one 1/2 off entree coupon:  Don't expect to get your margaritas for the happy hour price.  Order water instead.  You cannot use a coupon and get your happy hour drink prices.  Not sure what one has to do with the other but there's a loophole you need to be aware of.  We won't be back.  Food is good so too bad."}
{"text":"I come to this place all the time and I do love the food. The service however, could use some work. My friend and I walked in and stood there for a little while before being told to wait. There was no greeting at all. They have a lot of employees, but I feel as though some are not well trained. I always have a very different experience every time I go. I will continue to come here, but I hope they do a better job next time."}
{"text":"I have been going to here since the cook from Tia Rosa's stole the recipes and opened gecko...   cause I thought their service was better and it used to be... NOT any more... two times ago the waitress tried to extort a 50% tip by asking me 3 times if I \"really needed change, really\" and this last time I went for pick up and they failed to add the Salsa to my bag (the only reason I like their food in the first place and I'm to lazy to make the salsa myself - recipe to follow)... I called and let them know and my wife drove all the way back to get it and they accused her of lying... Seriously??? like I would go there (5 miles) and then go all the way back to steal 6 oz of green salsa???  
So here is the Green salsa Recipe-  3 cans of La Costena Tomatillos drain one and dump all three into a blender,  2-3 de-seeded Jalapenos, 1-1.5 bunch of cilantro,  4-5 fresh garlic cloves and about 2 tble spoons of sugar (to taste) . Blend for about a minute and enjoy not having to be accused of lying..."}
{"text":"Good food. Fresh. Some items seem a little pricey  shrimp mango quesadilla is really good"}
{"text":"Chips and salsa and bean dip are served; green salsa has a sweet flavor and the red salsa is spicy - quite tasty.  
Food was very good, hot, nicely presented, and reasonably priced.  Service was quick, the wait service was attentive and friendly.  Restaurant was clean and comfortable.  
Definitely worth a try.   I will be going back!"}
{"text":"The grill reminds me of the simple formula that pervades too many places today.  This formula states that cheese, cream, grease, or heavy sauces are required to make any dish serviceable. I'm not saying that this isn't a bad formula, but it does show some laziness for hiding behind those things.

Everything that I've had there is decent...it just follows that formula.  The Shrimp Quesadilla, for example, is good but completely saturated in their heavy seafood sauce.  Really too rich and overdone.  The same can be said for the 2-3 other things I've tried there.

Good service, bad ambiance, incredibly awkward place mens room, and a decent place if you live in Gilbert and need an alternative to mom's casserole."}
{"text":"Was pleasantly surprised by this place.  Got the Sonora hot dog and the carne asada caramello.  The dog was very good. Comparable to some of the better sonoran dog carts out in West phoenix. The caramello was good sized and tasty.  They have a nice patio as well."}
{"text":"Thank you Denice and Tara and all the amazing staff for a wonderful night! The food and service was amazing!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best mexican restaurants in the valley. Although it isn't exactly authentic flavors, the food is delicious and cheap. I especially like their mango salsa tacos (I can't remember what they're called).

The chips and salsa come free here and are excellent. The green salsa and beans are especially good although they charge for extra beans.

This is a great place for smaller groups but large groups will want to stay away because it is a small restaurant and you'll end up waiting forever to be seated."}
{"text":"Food was yummy, service was excellent. I got the \"camarones al mojo ajo\" it was very buttery, but I liked it. My hubs got \"southwestern shrimp burrito\" it was super creamy and heavy, but also very good. Our server was amazing! He was attentive, polite, but also gave us our space. I look forwArd to going back. Their mango shrimp quesadilla is legendary. It's my favorite things on the menu so far."}
{"text":"Better than I thought it would be.  The decor is underwhelming.   It was good food well made.  Not greasy like a lot of other places.  I noticed another review talking about bad service, It was fine when we were there, but it wasn't overly busy.  It is telling that we live close and have not been there often.  Not sure what they need to do to take this restaurant to the next level."}
{"text":"I love their food. The green salsa is ssoooo yummy.
I always order their chicken chimi, I love how the chicken is all white meat, however everytime I get one the chicken is not steaming hot! Not sure why this is but I feel this is something that can be fixed. Not the only location I have had the problem with."}
{"text":"New to this area and tried Gecko Grill out because I always see a line outside!  We've gone for breakfast and dinner; both were delicious.  The place is very small and very busy so get there early and expect a wait.  The wait is worth it though!"}
{"text":"Had my first experience with this popular spot today.  Unfortunately, our waitress was on her third day on the job so service was poor.  She and the manager even apologized for that.  But, everyone is new to a job at least once and, as a former restaurant worker, I tend to be quite forgiving.  Whenever I go to a new \"ethnic\" restaurant I usually order one of the \"baseline dishes,\" because if these dishes are good the rest of the menu items are also usually good.   Here I did a taco and a cheese enchilada combo.  First, I couldn't get ground beef even though the waitress told me ground beef was an option, instead I got big chucks of shredded beef in the taco.  The pieces were dry and tough, so as I bit into the taco shell I ended up with a huge hunk of beef hanging out of my mouth with a little piece of shell.  Not at all good.  Most disappointing, though, was the complete lack of \"zing\" in any of the food I had.  Everything was bland, bland, bland, even the salsas served at the beginning of the meal were lackluster!  I could not taste any cilantro or jalapeno in anything!  Mexican food is supposed to have a little kick in it, but not here.  Even Taco Bell has more spice and flavor than Gecko Grill.  My wife ordered a Seafood Grande with the sauce on the side as she is extremely sensitive to any level of spicy food.  Turned out there was no sauce in this dish but the burro was covered with melted pepperjack cheese because that's too hot for her.  She sent it back and ordered a shredded beef chimi.  The staff did get that out fairly rapidly.  While my wife liked this dish, she did admit that the chucks of shredded beef were very dry and not until she poured some of the liquidy bean dip on the meat was she satisfied with it.  I tasted some of the beef and it was very dry, just as in my taco.  Also, she got a little cup of salsa fresca with her chimi but thought it was more like pico de gallo.  I tasted it and it was so oniony that I actually spit it out into my napkin.  YUK!  The onions tasted as if they had been soaking in the pico de gallo for several days.  I'm not able to recommend this place to anyone unless you want to pretend you are eating Mexican food and are satisfied with the \"gringo\" blandness that permeates their menu."}
{"text":"Very nice and friendly staff.  Food is excellent and authentic, their street tacos are exactly like the ones I've had anywhere in Mexico.  Their red menudo is always a cooking and it's always great!  The large bowl is muy mas, stick with the regular bowl, it's plenty.  Excellent menu, bottled cervesas, and a couple of great margaritas.

Good times and friendly atmosphere.  Family will be regulars at this place!"}
{"text":"I moved to Arizona 3 years ago after living in California near the Mexico border my entire life. It's been very difficult to find a good Mexican place similar to what I'm used to. This is the closest I've found. The breakfast is great, as is the menudo. I really enjoy the \"flautas\", although they are more like taquitos. The staff is always great and you can't beat the prices. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Had takeout from here the other day. Camerones rancheros were awesome and flavorful. Everyone else loved their food. Would recommend."}
{"text":"This is absolutely, hands down my favorite Mexican place in Phoenix.  It is awesome, high quality Mexican food, but isn't greasy and doesn't make me feel sick or hate myself after eating it.  I always recommend the Fiesta Burro - SO GOOD!!!  You will not regret it!!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing. I had The Geko Burro and it was delish. The staff is friendly and helpful. The food is perfect. Super fast service. The place is always clean. Pervious trip I had the Pollo Fundido. The best I have ever had."}
{"text":"Tried Gecko for the first time today. Yelp info informed us it was not waiter service, but really was. The outside area was nice,roomy & shady. We were a little confused as to why a party of 10 or 12 was being seated for us ( a party of two ). The server seemed a little in la la land. We asked for a beer list... And he responded with... \"Uhh what's that?\".. You know a list of beers that you guys carry. We kind of laughed it off tho. They seemed to be a bit new as they didn't know which tables had been care of already or not. We had 3 people at our table at one pt. ..Frank ( who wasn't our server ) refilled our drinks & checked on us, was a great help & was very friendly. The food was so so but prices were very inexpensive. Free chips / salsa & bean dip & good horchata!"}
{"text":"Love all the beans and veggies.  The food type in general is healthy. It is delicious.  But it's not the highest quality.  The service is a little lower than average.  We ordered a meal and it came out to be significantly less than we expected.  When we asked them why it was so sub par they just said that was the price.  We were just surprised they weren't accommodating or at least embarrassed to serve something with only 2 ingredients.  So we sent it back.  The saving grace is the dips.  Best bean dip,  best salsa.  So definitely start the meal with the free chips and dip."}
{"text":"This was the first restaurant we ate at seven years ago when looking at houses in Arizona. We've been back several times and have never been disappointed.  First of all, they have a shrimp quesadilla with mango.  And tacos with mango.  How many times do you find that? Both are yummy. 

All meals start out with a good pile of chips and three dipping sauces: mild red salsa, sweet green salsa, and bean dip.  Today my friend and I ordered the same thing, a chili relleno stuffed with crab meat.  But what made it so delicious was the creamy sauce on top.  We knew we couldn't lick the plates, so attempted to scoop up leftover drops with broken pieces of chips.  Pretty sad.  We should have just run our fingers over the plate to get the rest of the sauce. 

This was ordered a la carte, although you can order the meal, which comes with tasty rice and beans. But we're both tamale lovers, so split a side order of two sweet corn tamales with green sauce.  Note: The restaurant charges extra for the sauce, which seems odd since who eats a tamale without any sauce?  But the tamales were soft with a nice corn taste.  The mild green sauce added an extra depth of flavor. 

The restaurant lost a few points due to service.  We interacted with young two servers, one of whom couldn't answer our questions, and the other spoke zippity fast and then gave us about 34 seconds to make up our minds on our order.  

Decor is average. In milder weather, there is a very nice covered patio."}
{"text":"Great place with a very unique but excellent product they have their own twist  and style of Mexican food. My family's been coming here for few years now. I love the new location because of their breakfast menu. Lunch and dinner are always great times with their classic bean dip check it out if you haven't already"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Mexican food places here in Gilbert. I was introduced to this place a few years back after they had reopened by a close friend of mine, and I've been coming here ever since! There staff isn't always on point but for the decently priced menu items and the monthly coupons they actually send out, it's a great place to eat. I love there bean dip and salsa they give you and their chips are delicious as well! One thing I always get here is their seafood burrito,  oh my it's delicious! I highly recommend it, and if you don't finish it, it's tasty the next day too! If you haven't tried this place and want to,  check out the monthly coupon book that gets sent out in the Gilbert area!"}
{"text":"I am sorry to report that my mom and I had the worst Mexican meals we've ever had last night at Gecko Grill. I had already been a guest once with my husband and that meal, over a year ago, was not impressive (I had ordered a chimichanga and it tasted very plain and he didn't even finish his meal because it was so poor), however, I wanted to give the place one more chance as maybe they were having an off day. 

My mom ordered two chargrilled fish tacos ($4.69/each) and I ordered the Gecko Quesadilla Grande ($10.99). Our server was pleasant if not super quite but no biggie there. Our food came out fairly quickly and I immediately knew why. My mom's tacos looked like soggy, plain fish tacos and my \"grande\" quesadilla was....you guys, I'm seriously APPALLED at what was on my plate for $10.99. This was two store bought tortillas crisped so much that it didn't even look like a tortilla was the actual ingredient. If you've have canned chicken before, you KNOW the taste and that was indeed canned chicken in my \"quesadilla\". There was barely any guacamole (not that I was wanting a lot but I think I maybe got one or two tastes out of the 2 triangles I ate), and if their jalape√±o cream cheese exists, it didn't make it for my particular quesadilla. I cannot believe that someone has the ability to run a restaurant using prepackaged, microwaveable food. 

I see all of these positive reviews and I'm sure there have been great visits but, guys, when we are talking Mexican food-the quality-you can not all be so thrilled with this restaurant. If you are, then I believe you need to go try real Mexican food. I can name, on both hands, other restaurants in the vicinity that server FAR better meals for the same amount of money. That is the real kicker here. I wouldn't even pay $6.99 for that quesadilla item. I can go to Nando's, Tia Rosa's, Serrano's, and even Mi Amigo's and Someburro and get a plate for a similar price and have to take home the extras as the portions are generous. The plate presentation of this quesadilla at GG was amateur at best. I could make that quesadilla AND those fish tacos in my kitchen with FLAVOR and then I bet it would be worth $10.99. I will not be returning and I WILL be spreading the word. Terrible food, terrible prices."}
{"text":"Make sure you don't order a la carte   I ordered 2 cheese and onion enchiladas  and they charge me $11.36   can you believe it !!!!  that is highway robbery !!!   No where on their menu is the price per enchilada al la carte.  Lesson learned  always ask before placing the order!"}
{"text":"Barbeque AND Mexican? You read it right. 

And Gecko Grill pulls it off. 

The BBQ ribs are outstanding. My husband's favorites are the shrimp and fish tacos. I prefer the fiesta chicken, spinach enchiladas, or the pork soft tacos. And anything with the mango salsa is good. 

Gecko Grill is worth the trip if simply for the chips and salsa. They serve both red and green, and both are good. I only wish they served them in larger bowls! 

The chips are very thin and usually come out warm. 

Oh, and did I mention they serve free bean dip along with the chips & salsa? It's very good, and so popular that many folks who come to Gecko order a pint to go.

The inside of the restaurant is painted light pink with teal accents. The carved wooden chairs and rough stone floor add an authentic flavor."}
{"text":"There was a 30 minute wait, but it was well worth it.  

The complimentary chips were thin and crispy and not greasy and served with a red and a green salsa and an addictive warm white bean dip.

Our party had asada tacos, pork quesadilla, shrimp tacos and the spicy asada burro.  Everyone liked the food, the burro (burrito) I had was a normal size,  not some monster giant burrito it would take a family of 5 to eat.   The spicy salsa/marinade on the steak was very tasty and there was no fat on the meat.

I'm adding this to the rotation when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Gecko Grill is some of the best southwestern style barbecue and food in the valley of the sun. Tucked into a strip mall.
Like Garcias and Serranos, this place serves several salsas and a bean and cheese dip with a basket of chips to every diner. One could easily make a meal of this, but be warned: it is very filling, and yes, the entrees are belly-busting good!
Originally, I am told that this place just did barbeque. Myself? I am thankful for the neo-mexican stuff as well, but the chicken that this place cranks out as either straight forward smoked-barbecued chicken with a sauce on the side, or stuffed into a colossal burro (and I am a burrito HATER, I usually don't like them.) is AMAZING!
Once I met my friend Juliet and her family here and all of her kids aparently adore the place. The kids were all about the bean dip and the french fries. It was tre' cute!
Great service too!

The shrimp mango quesadillas are the best! They are adorned with just a little green pepper snap. an order is too much for me to finish my myself.

The smoked chicken wings are good.

Really, you can't go wrong with this menu. If you go on the wrong day, and they are closed, there may be disappointed sighing. They close early, so go in the evening."}
{"text":"Thoroughly unimpressed.  Very weak salsa selection. The red salsa reminded me of Taco Bell. The strawberry margarita was AWFUL!!!  Definitely won't be back. 
Want some good Mexican food?  Come up to Pinetop and go to Los Corrales."}
{"text":"Great food...forgetful waitress...ice tea runs dry and chip basket empty. Needs better and more professional service."}
{"text":"I wa so ready to justify why you may have received 3 stars because a year ago I gave 4-5 stars easily to you. Shame on you! I will NEVER go back!!!! What a shit show when i walked in! About 6 waiters standing around register; my fault to asume they knew how to do their jobs.The entire order was incorrect AND BONUS I paid for many extras BUT of course got none included. Tyvm for reaffirming why I hate Arizona Mexican food...you just charge 2x as much!!"}
{"text":"Gecko Grill is one of my all time favorite restaurants. I grew up in Arizona, but moved away for college and haven't moved back yet, but each time I come home, I HAVE to get a shrimp mango quesadilla. They have the best chips, salsa, and bean dip. Everything on the menu is so good! You really can't go wrong no natter what you choose. You won't regret coming here!"}
{"text":"This place is outstanding. I have never had anything that wasn't great. The 3 salsas and chips , the mini chinos with the jalape√±o cream cheese, the beans, enchiladas. The place is super clean, great atmosphere, a large secluded patio. My new favorite Mexican food restaurant !!"}
{"text":"Great food. The patio area is so nice when it's cooler outside. I get something different every time and it's always so good."}
{"text":"Noticed a new Mexican food restaurant close to my house so I figured I'd try it.... Called in my order and was told 10 minutes. Wasn't ready when I came to pick it up and the staff seemed kind of  discombobulated (possibly due to being a new restaurant??) Food was okay, but my glass mexican coke had this awful metallic aftertaste -  throw up in my mouth status... Honestly couldn't even take more than one sip bc it was that disgusting!"}
{"text":"Gecko grill has a unique and sweet taste on to their meals. Mango Sweet Shrimp Quesadilla is what I had...... MANGO.....Who thought of that? Put mango in a Quesadilla or anything else!! Very Very tasty.

My experience here was great, our waitress Alexis did a wonderful job. Made sure our cups were always full and brought us chips and salsa  prior to our main course arriving to our table. Very clean place and environment. All the workers are all friendly and acknowledges you once you walk in.

I highly recommend one of their chimichangas or burritos. Definitely will be seeing me here."}
{"text":"Tag line: Abandon all hope ye who Take Out here.

Prepare for the absolute nadir of customer service.

Update: the owner reached out to me. Here's the deal, if you made my next house payment, I would not eat in your establishment. And I truly do not understand the pathology of people willing to spend money for such consistently atrocious service. 

I looked through a couple pages of your other reviews. It ain't just me. Poor service is a common theme. The whole reason I'm writting this update is that I'm angry with the general theme of your reactive responses. It's on you to create a culture of customer service. Two sentences to each raw customer doesn't fix the problem. Be proactive and fix your service culture. Now I feel stupid for telling you what you should already know. 

Anyway. DONE. Read me? Good.

Original review - 

Abandon all hope ye who Take Out here.

Prepare for the absolute nadir of customer service.

The food is serviceable, and truly, only that... serviceable. The take-out service, however is flippant, vacuous, and frustrating beyond my ability to convey sans 4-letter words. 

Your mileage may vary, but I'm done. I've given too much patience to this establishment over the years. 

I've been tolerant of the general take-it-or-leave-it attitude from this establishment for years. I'm done... rear-view mirror baby! I fear if I subject myself to the horrible customer service of Gecko one much time, I will rededicate my life to its downfall. So, I'm out."}
{"text":"It was packed but they were able to our party of 6 seated within 15 minutes, which is good especially for a Saturday night.  Their chicken mango quesadilla is simply the best.  Service is really good!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places! I've been going there for a couple years and I order the special chimi (chicken) pretty much every time and the sauce they pour over it is sooooooo good I want a whole barrel of it in my kitchen! Everything there is good I've never had a bad meal there and the staff is always friendly. It's one of those places I am sure to take my family to when they visit!"}
{"text":"On our way home from golfing and needing a good Mexican meal with a ice cold beer or better yet a Margarita. We stopped here not know there's NO alcohol! WAH - Huh?  We stayed anyway. I ordered the lettuce wrap and yummy it was, but there was only ONE - one lettuce wrap for $6.95 I would expect at least 2 wraps. It's wrapped in LETTUCE for goodness sake? I did lick the plate, it was good.  As I looked around I noticed there were no Hispanics eating there, why is that?   I won't be back - me needs alcohol."}
{"text":"New Location---- so glad it has finally opened and is now closer to us again! Starting with chips that are not greasy or over-filling, crisp and thin, served with their Gecko bean dip, green and red salsa on the side! Try and eat just one...We adore the chicken enchilada - never had them so delishly simple and tasty; I don't know how they prepare their chicken but it is consistently moist, tender, flavorful. The green sauce served over is just yummy and the cherry on top! Such amazing value...

The service has always been great, and tonight was not any different. Attentive, eye contact, sense of service and sense of humor. So appreciated on a Sunday evening with my family. Looking forward to the liquor license coming next month! 

Cheers and congrats!

p.s.- this is what food from scratch tastes like when someone cares!"}
{"text":"I love this place for breakfast . I'm sorry to post this that I will shoot myself in the foot by this place is going be packed for MY BREAKFAST Time. The food is american with a Mexican twist. Plan on putting in some sit down time to talk to your people, the service is a little slow but it is worth the time. On a big party, good luck and have patience.
The food is Great, Don't  play around with the cooks.
Plus to and to this, Great job to the COOKS"}
{"text":"I loved going to eat here but have been here for the last time. My nephew worked here, his grandpa passed away this morning and he called out. They fired him. A business with no compassion for it's employees does not have my business."}
{"text":"We've been to this location which offers similar menu items as Morenos in STV. I prefer Morenos, however Gecko Grill is still great and I love many things on the menu. I usually eat the mexican seafood items."}
{"text":"Where can I begin ?... my family and I moved to Arizona about 3 years ago . We have tried many Mexican restaurants such as Serrano's, rosita's , Garcia's (etc..) 
A close friend told us about this amazing restaurant called gecko grill so we thought we'd give it a try ! I have to say we fell in love with this place ! You get free chips and salsa to eat while your food is being made, they give a mild chunky sauce , a sweet tomatillo sauce , and my favorite BEAN DIP !! I have never tried better bean dip than here ! The customer service is just so wonderful and the servers are always happy to help ! Apart from the servers they have hardworking bussers who are also happy to help in anything you need ! The patio is AMAZING !! The patio is covered which is very convenient on sunny days .. they also have fans and misters to keep it nice and fresh when you're sitting outside ! Their garden looks TERRIFIC! So many plants to look at and they're very well taken care of and they even have a fountain that you'll enjoy watching while you're having your meal ! The food is like none other than we have tried ! The authenticity of it is just perfect . Their menu is full of items to choose from so it's very hard choosing what to eat because everything is just so goood.... my favorite would have to be the tampiquena which is a charbroiled steak with rice beans guacamole and Fresca .. you must try everything once because you'll never get tired of it ! My family and I now come here every weekend and 3 times per week if we weren't busy we'd be here everyday ! Don't forget to try their breakfast meals . Oh Man they have EVERYTHING !! If you want to try something different they will cook something up for you and they will satisfy each time . I heavily recommend doing the hash your way , meaning you make your own plate . I am very grateful to have come across this restaurant ! We love everything about it and the owners are just wonderful people . I have seen them walking around the restaurant making sure everyone is enjoying their meal or helping out the employees in front ! They are very humble and kind people ! My family and I will keep coming here for as long as we can ! We  highly recommend this place to anyone new in the area or anybody in general ! You will not be disappointed and you surely will fall in love with it as much as we did ! Thank you gecko grill for your amazing food , employees, ambience, and for all the fun memories for there are more to come ."}
{"text":"Gecko Grill is good, but not great. The service was okay, because the bussers were more helpful than our waiter. The food is, what I call, \"Gringo Mexican.\" Everything was under seasoned/marinated and loaded with cheese. Everyone loves cheese, so I think that's where all the great reviews came from. I don't want to bash this place, because there was nothing necessarily wrong, it just wasn't real Mexican food. I probably wont go back."}
{"text":"I love Gecko Grill.  I have been coming here since they were in their other location.  The special Chimi (beef) is the best.    I miss their beef tri tips, but maybe we will see them again.  The staff is nice.  Food has always been awesome.  

Love this place.  Here is what you need to remember:  Beef special chimi, all you can eat chips and GREEN salsa.  Yum!"}
{"text":"This is the first restaurant I tried once I arrived to the Phoenix area.  I had just spent 2 days crossing Texas, New Mexico and finally arriving into sunny AZ.   There was a short wait but nothing unusual for a weekend.  The chips and salsas were very addictive.  I have tried the chicken burro and the shrimp quesadilla.  I can't seem to get away from the shrimp quesadilla. The mango sauce is amazing; not too heavy yet not too light.  The only draw back to the menu was that they did not serve alcohol (at least when I was frequenting this place).    The staff is always very friendly and prompt but I can't say that for the customers.  Like most places in Gilbert there are children running around like wild monkeys.  One time I was eating dinner with my date and a small child ran up to our table and proceeded to fondle our tortilla chips.  We looked around but found no parent in sight.   To me it's a little too relaxed with the \"family friendly\" atmosphere and that has kept me from returning but if you are in the area do stop by and check it out for yourself.  I'm sure the meal will please you."}
{"text":"This place is, average. It used to be my favorite Mexican food place, but their prices have increased for no apparent reason. My last visit was a bit disappointing which has earned it the 3 stars. The food was mediocre and the service did not exceed my expectations. If I have to find you for more chips and salsa, there's a problem."}
{"text":"Gecko is a long time favorite of ours. We love the bean dip and green salsa. They do a good job at keeping the inside clean and clearing tables fast. Friday and Saturday night is always packed but if you go early enough the wait isnt very long.

My all time favorite is: (keep in mind that i LOVE the bean dip)

Bean and cheese burrito, sub bean dip, add white spinach cheese sauce on top. Then when i comes to the table i pour a small size thing of green salsa on top. This dish goes well with eating it with chips too!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here for years. I love their bean dip and green chili salsa that comes out with the free chips. I always get the chicken chimichanga with spinach white cheese sauce (see \"Special Chimi\" on menu). So delicious and the only Mexican food place I know with that kind of sauce. I recommend this place to anyone in the East Valley area."}
{"text":"Great breakfast....pleasant servers, fast seating!!!  Every other place has a 30 minute wait for Sunday breakfast here but you can get seated right away and the breakfast is just as good."}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant.  It is pretty good Mexican food, although I am more of a fan of New Mexican.

The bean dip is a little spicy, but good.  The chips are plenty and the salsa right on the money for heat and taste.

We both had the same dish, Pollo Fundido, which was quite tasty and favorable.

They were a little busy and had to wait for water.  But the overall service was great.  While we live a little far away, we will go back!"}
{"text":"Our new favorite breakfast and lunch spot. We had almost given up on finding a great authentic Mexican restaurant and we finally found one in our own neighborhood. Breakfast are excellent! We get the chorizo plate( best Chorizo we've ever had), Menudo, and the breakfast quesadilla. All are fresh, homemade and delicious! Staff is always friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"A friend took me here for lunch one day and this restaurant has become my favorite Mexican restaurant.  Great chicken taco's and love the bean dip!"}
{"text":"My favorite item is the shrimp ceviche tostada! Tons of shrimp and priced well if I remember correctly. The chips are a little overlooked usually but that's just me brig picky, I don't think most people would notice. I love that the give you bean dip, green and red sauce with your chips. I think I'm going to try the seafood chimi one of these times. It looks great!"}
{"text":"My wife and I are very picky eaters. This place has been our favorite Mexican restaurant since they were off Gilbert Road. The food is amazing. Breakfast is great too if you've never had it here."}
{"text":"PATHETIC SERVICE!!! Not really sure what restaurant owners don't understand about providing good quality service. But this is yet another fine example of pathetic service. Initial impression start with the hostess and she was pretty much devoid of any personality or friendliness. Also the place was an icebox inside, with some customers showing signs of frostbite!     Not sure what restaurant owners don't understand about the comfort of their patrons. So we got up from the indoor seating area and made our way to the outdoor patio area hoping it would be a little bit warmer.  We passed by that same friendly little hostess and let her know what we were doing but regardless she acted like she could care less.   Regardless she again devoid of any personality pointed us out to some table that we could go sit at if we wanted. At least the chips and salsa came quickly although they were about as pathetic as the service. Sat there for over 10 minutes without anyone acknowledging us or even taking our order. Saw several people walk by that appeared to be to be table service, but they didn't even give us the time of day. Then noticed another table that had sat down after us did have a server taking their order and that's when we said enough and got up to leave. But I did notice that almost every table on the patio had no food at it all and I could see plenty of other people were getting agitated as well. Again its 2016 and I have no clue how these restaurant owners are still in business when they do not provide better service than this.  So basically I can't even write about  their food as I never had a chance to taste it, less the chips and salsa, which I rated. But I can tell you this when I was voicing my complaint at the front desk I saw a few plates coming out and the portions looked pretty pathetic considering the price.   I fail to believe that we were the only ones that felt like we were getting bad service out of this place. Again like I said I looked around and others were getting pretty agitated as well. Come on Arizona wake up and start demanding better service and yes tip accordingly for good quality service. We do all the time.  But when there is no service and you don't even get any food how can you even leave a tip. Except for this tip ----  try another place."}
{"text":"It's clean and the waitress was good and pleasant, the food  not so much. Fish tacos were just awful. I just don't like sweet fish or soggy corn tortillas. The fish was dark not nice and white. For the price they should use a better fish. Chips were good and so was the bean dip. I may go back and try something simpler. But only if I'm in the area     Won't go out of my way."}
{"text":"Mexican food was very very good. The atmosphere is really nice. They have a wonderful place to sit outside with misters Great place for happy hour and meeting up with friends. We have a burrito it was covered in cheese. Ask them what's the favorite item on the menu and it was it. It was made with chicken and was wonderful! So glad to finally found a good Mexican restaurant. I am from Texas and we have many."}
{"text":"First time visiting and enjoyed it.   The server was very attentive.   The chips were fresh and thin,  salsas yummy.   We loved the fact that they had several healthy options for the calorie conscious.   We had lettuce wrapped shrimp tacos with mango salsa.  Mango was definitely fresh!  Tacos were just a touch bland but consistency of shrimp was cooked well.  Also shared the crab relleno which was delish.   My daughters both enjoyed their taco salads.   Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Shrimp tacos are the best! The salsas and bean dip that come out with the chips before your meal is delicious too. Hands down my favorite sit down Mexican restaurant. 
I came here with my family today and the service was excellent too."}
{"text":"This place is sooooo frustrating!!!! If the food wasn't so good I wouldn't even waste my time with Gecko Grill. The service is 0 star!! Today I walked in to no less than 3 people standing at the front. Nobody greater me as I stood there for 1,2,3,5, 7 minutes. Finally people came in after me, walked passed me and were seated immediately."}
{"text":"Just visited the Gecko Grill in Gilbert for the first time.  It was amazing!  They have done a great job with the space they are in, nice ambiance.  They have one of the best patio dining in Arizona. Absolutely beautiful with all the green vegetation, trees and shade. I  love that they serve the beans with the complimentary salsa and chips.  Not many Mexican restaurants do that anymore, and I love it...YUMMY. The food was amazing. I ordered the combo of cheese enchilada with shredded beef crispy taco.  The rice was perfect, loved the refried beans, the taco was fried to perfection (they fry each one, not the crappy already prepared store bought shell) and they didn't skimp on anything, including the shredded beef. The cheese enchilada was fantastic...my daughter ordered the chicken enchiladas with green sauce, which of course I had to try, and they were amazing too. What I really appreciated was the care in which they plated the food. It wasn't sloppy and didn't look rushed as if the cook was busy and just threw everything on the plate. It was beautiful and looked as if it was prepared with love - like I would do for my family. That really impressed me. Also found out this is part of the Moreno Brothers restaurants. Great job guys. Can't say enough good things.  I will definitely be back, and I'm bringing a herd with me."}
{"text":"So sad to discover that this place closed.  They didn't serve alcohol, so that's a bummer, but major points for the shrimp and mango quesadillas.  Maybe they will reopen elsewhere and serve those....they were so good. :("}
{"text":"Hooray! It re-opened. Shrimp/mango quesadillas are as good as ever, and most impressively, they use real tortillas. The old place didn't serve alcohol, and the new one does, which is a tremendous improvement.

Service was on the slow side, especially given that the place was mostly empty, but the food was worth the wait. I love the fact that you get bean dip, green salsa, AND red salsa with the chips!"}
{"text":"Wow SCORE!!!!!!!
i stopped in here last night while heading to fat  cats
and tell you what im glad i got in when i did .. no waiting was seated right away
by the time i left there was a huge crowd waiting to be seated..... i tried the caramello quesadilla and it was awesome the steak was tender and very flavorful
my date had a soft taco and bean and cheese burro and raved about them
very attentive and friendly wait staff and very affordable with a great atmosphere
i will be returning regularly"}
{"text":"Very good food, great green chillies in the burrito, the shrimp mango quasiddia is very good."}
{"text":"Love this place! It has the best food and such a great location. Love the outdoor seating! 
Pollo fundido is my go to dish!!"}
{"text":"Way overrated! I had been to the previous location years ago and didn't care for it then. Decided to give it another go at it's new spot, and it's still ranks the same for me. The salsas are very runny, almost too runny, the bean dip was nearly tasteless. I ordered asada street tacos and wasn't impressed with them. The meat had no flavor. Overall I think this place is lacking that authentic Mexican flavor. I will not be going back. There are too many other Mexican food places on AZ that deliver much more."}
{"text":"Great little family restaurant. Food and atmosphere were amazing along with the service. Would recommend anybody to try it out."}
{"text":"I was recommended to the Gecko Grill from a friend who lives near there when I told her I wanted to try a new Mexican place. I was a little disappointed in it!

We got sat fairly quickly which was nice considering it was about 6:30 on a Friday. After we got sat though it was a while before anyone came over. Someone who wasn't our waitress finally came over and took our drink order after about 10 minutes. Drinks were good, but took about 10 more minutes to actually get the drinks. Our waitress when she finally came over seemed to have an attitude or like she was annoyed about something.

I ordered a burrito that was supposed to have guacamole in it but I opened it once I started eating it and saw there was barely any in it. I was pretty disappointed since I love guac, and the burrito overall was very dry. My fianc√© was brought the wrong dish although it was similar to what he got, so he started eating it without noticing. After a couple of minutes the waitress came back over and said she gave him the wrong dish, he said it was fine and he's already eaten a couple of bites and enjoyed it so he was fine keeping it. She insisted that they remake it and took his plate so he didn't have anything for a while while the rest of us were eating. I thought it was really strange that she didn't just let him keep it since he said he enjoyed it and was fine with it?

I'm giving it two stars because the food wasn't awful, I tried my fianc√©'s new plate of food and his was pretty good, haha. The atmosphere was lovely and I enjoyed the patio and the live performer they had while we were there. But overall disappointing, probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Excellent food! We have finally found a place in our neighborhood for awesome Mexican food.  We are quickly becoming regulars for breakfast and lunch.  Give them a try :)"}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for a late breakfast. They let us choose between either the breakfast menu or the regular menu. Even though it was breakfast, they started us off with chips and salsa. They all tasted fresh and home made. The chips were just right and, although not spicy, the two slasas were also good. They brought a red salsa and a sweet green salsa.

We starte with horchata to drink. My wife ordered a breakfast burrito with chorizo, which was bigger than she expected. She said it was really good. I got the machaca plate (shredded beef with peppers and eggs mixed in.) It came with a side of hash browns and a side of refried beans and fresh tortillas. It was all very good.

There was a minor issue with one of the tortillas, but they handled it well and the owner/manager came to our table and apologized and gave us a discount, which was unnecessary, but very appreciated.

We both appreciated how clean and new everything felt and the service was excellent.

We will definitely be back here. I am looking forward to trying the lunch or dinner menu next time."}
{"text":"I thought they had closed for good! I didn't realize that they moved! What a relief! This is one of my favorite Mexican Restaurants in the Valley and was really disappointed when they disappeared from the Gilbert and Guadalupe location they had been in for over 10 years! I usually skip the refried beans at most Mexican food restaurants because they bore me, but Gecko Grill's beans have a special smokey flavor and are lighter, almost fluffy. Their Fiesta Chicken is the best marinated and grilled chicken anywhere and I absolutely LOVE their Crab Relleno with their crabby sauce which is the most amazing sauce I've had on Mexican food. My wife loves their Pollo Grande (Pollo Fundido) and I love their seafood version, it's slightly sweet because all their seafood is cooked with fruity salsas which go perfectly with shrimp and fish.

I am utterly ecstatic that they are back in business and will be making a trip there soon!

UPDATE: I just ate lunch at this new location and am happy to report that my favorite menu items are still on the menu, along with some new things to try. The recipes seem to be the same, but you can tell they are being made by different cooks. Everything was still good though. They are still getting their feet wet with this new restaurant, but they were extremely busy and there was a wait for lunch at 12:30 on a Thursday! I'm glad they are getting the business. However, they ran out of high-chairs when we got there and so the nephew we were baby-sitting had to sit on our laps until one became available. Also, the food seemed to take awhile to come out, but it was worth the wait. I'm sure they'll get into their groove soon, but until then I had to reduce my review to 4 stars."}
{"text":"We had been sitting here on this beautiful patio for at least 20 minutes when my boyfriend, who has a booming radio DJ voice, yelled across other diners to someone else's waitperson like a Wall Street trader doing a long shot purchase \"EXCUSE ME, WE ARE READY TO ORDER!\" 

The salsa could use some heat and waaaaay less salt. They didn't bring little plates for the chips and salsa and they have those wrought iron mesh tables that you can see through, so of course the salsa is falling through the table onto our legs! All they had were these tiny cheap napkins! 

We overheard the family next to us as they were eating their shrimp cocktails say \"we don't have time to wait for our meals could you please cancel our order?\" They had obviously been waiting to place their order as long or longer than we had.

Our order finally came and while the food was good it was extremely bland.  I asked if they had a spicier hot sauce or salsa and she said yes and brought me something equally as bland as the first two. So if you're looking for a nice atmosphere bland food and the worst service ever this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"Always a great time at Gecko. Shrimp tacos are my fave, but still haven't come across anything I didn't like."}
{"text":"The food is good and not too expensive but I was really upset with our service. We ordered and just sat there forever and the food didn't come until I had to ask if we were getting to have our food this evening and the waitress then ran and got it and it was basically cold and had been sitting up there forever. Really frustrating because it caused us to be late for our movie and not get a seat. My night was ruined and I'm just really upset now I won't go back because of how this made me feel."}
{"text":"The food was good but the service was not that great. I cannot decide whether I like it or not. I will give it another try eventually but if the service sucks again I would give it two stars instead of three. It took a while for someone to bring our drinks and take our order. We were served chips with two types of salsa and a bean dip. When they refilled our chips and salsa they did not give us bean dip. When I asked for more bean dip I was told it would be an additional 99 cents. WTF over! Unbelievable."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. The bean dip that is served with the complimentary chips was delicious. I had a meat tostada and it was good. I would order it again. There were a lot of servers, but the service was only adequate. My iced tea was only asked and refilled once. My friend and I sat and talked about 20 minutes after paying the bill and no one ever asked to refill my empty iced tea glass. My guest had to flag down and ask for a to go cup, (a good time to ask if I wanted one as well, but that did not happen.) The  empty to go cup came after about 5-10 minutes. Beverages should not be this difficult."}
{"text":"Ordered Taco Salad. Was unimpressed, the lettuce was the ice berg used for plate garnishment, not much chicken, less than tablespoon of guac., just flat and tasteless.  Also, I advise to not sit in smaller room to the east, was very noisy, today quite a few small children. Service was slow."}
{"text":"This place is like the IHOP of Mexican food. Interesting variety.  Kind of a standardized feel to the food/menu. Get a lot of food for what you pay. Pretty good above average. Got the Egg chiladas and chilaquiles. A plus that I got chips and salsa when ordering breakfast. Love me some chips and salsa! Liked the bean dip"}
{"text":"My husband and I were at sportsman warehouse and decided to grab lunch before heading back to tempe. I had been wanting Mexican food we decided to try it. We stopped in on a Saturday morning around 10:30 it took a couple of minutes to acknowledge us before someone greeted us and offered to seat us. The outdoor patio looked really cute but there was not an open table so we choose inside. We looked over the lunch menus and sat for several minutes before being greeted. We order water and my husband asked about breakfast. He was brought a breakfast menu to look at. A few more minutes passed and we ordered our food and was brought a basket of chips and two salsas. The chips were slightly warm and had good flavor. The salsa was ok at best. After 10 or so minutes we were checked on and we asked for more water. Our food took about 20 minutes to get. We were seated outside the kitchen and it sounded a bit unorganized. We were brought our food and then left. Husband had pancakes and strawberries which he said was pretty good. Ordered a crab relleno  with rice and beans. The releno  was small but not greasy like most. Inside was just lots of imitation crab. The rice and beans were okay but nothing special. No one checked on us until we were finished with our meals. And then we were just given the check no offer for desert or anything. We were in a hurry at this point as we had an appt. to make. The tab was almost 17.00. Not wanting to wait any longer I left a 20.00 and we left. 
Would I go back again? Probably not. Perhaps if I was in the area and not in a hurry? The food was pretty decent the service lackluster and overall atmosphere just ok."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty decent Mexican food for the area. I've definitely had better. The bean dip for the chips is quite enjoyable however the salsas leave some to be desired. The meat was above average but not the best. All around nothing special but not a place to overlook if you're just craving a quick sit down bite of Mexican food; and for the price there are definitely better places in the valley."}
{"text":"I've only tried a very few items here at the Gecko Grill.  But I usually personally rate a authentic Mexican Restaurant on trying these few items.  Depending if they turn out great determines whether I try something new next time.  So here it goes!

I usually first always get the Chimichanga at any new Mexican restaurant that I try.  And theirs is pretty amazing!  I always get shredded beef Chimichanga's usually on the first order of any restaurant and theirs top the list.  It's just what it should be deep fried, large amount, and delicious.  It's nice if you can get a side of their Jalapeno Cream Cheese to go with it!  It is too die for!

Next their refried beans are crap!  They taste like they came out of a can.  Bland!  Don't waste your time and so that means their refried bean burritos are not going to be any better.

Their Burro Grand and Gecko Burro are ok.  And the only thing that makes the Bean Mini Chimis ok is the jalapeno cream cheese.

I've never been one to mix Seafood with Mexican Food.  Disgusting!  Yuk!  It never seems authentic Mexican Food when I see fish tacos and the such on a Mexican Food Menu.

So I believe your best bet would be to get the Chimichanga any way you want it with a side Jalapeno Cream Cheese.  And this would be a very safe bet and delicious!"}
{"text":"The place is small but seemed like they'd serve some bomb authentic food. It was good but nothing that blew us away.

The bean dip they serve with chips is really really good. The other 2 salsas lacked in flavor. They have a large menu with lots to choose from which is nice but it was hard to choose. I ended up getting the mini chimis which were good. My husband got a carne asada burrito smothered in their crab sauce. The burrito ended up being shredded beef instead of carne asada and the sauce over the burrito starts to harden as it cools down. The taste of it wasn't bad.

I might eat here again if we are in the area but it's nothing to go out of our way for."}
{"text":"I gave their old location a 1 star due to customer service.

The new location is like night and day compared to the old. Much better layout and customer service was great.

The food is fantastic!

My favorite is the crispy beef and chicken tacos,

Ariba used to be our favorite now it's the new Gecko Grill!!!

We usually call our order in so as to avoid the wait many others have complained about."}
{"text":"We went here after reading the reviews on Yelp with high expectations, we ended up being pretty disappointed. We got there and were seated promptly and seen by a waitress right away. The chips and salsa were pretty good, although the bean dip could have been a little warmer. When the waitress came to take out orders I asked her what Gecko grill was known for and she advised us that most people come for the seafood dishes. With the advice from the waitress my wife ordered the Crab Relleno Burro and I ordered the Seafood Grande. My wife thought the Burro was OK but nothing she would come back for. My order, the Seafood Grande, was pretty disappointing. My biggest problem with my meal was the the \"Pepper Jack\" cheese that was melted on top of my meal was actually processed Pepper Jack slices, the taste of the cheese really took away from the meal. The beans and rice served with my meal were also pretty blah. 

As a side note to the food, we were seated in viewing distance of the hostess at the door. She could barely be removed from texting on her cell phone to do her job. Apparently the hostess is responsible for making the utensil set with the napkins, which I watched her set the clean utensils on the dirty podium where the rag she used to wipe down menus was also sitting. She texted and wiped her face/hair while making the utensil sets, not once stopping to wash her hands.  This was a pretty big turn off.

I try really hard to support local businesses, I hope my experience was an anomaly, but I will not be back."}
{"text":"First visit to Gecko Grill was quite pleasing to the tummy. I saw this place en route to another highly Yelp rated business (Two Wheel Jones).

My wife had the Chicken Sopes combination platter with rice and refried beans. She enjoyed the flavors of the Sopes and the refried beans. I had the Taco and Burrito combination with Carne Asada. The thing that struck me was that the Carne Asada was cut quite small but I could taste the flavors.  

The other thing is how attentive the staff is. There was one waitress (Heidi) who went to each customer to ensure they were satisfied. For us, that spoke volumes. Our server, Halee, was also attentive and professional.  No doubt that we will return."}
{"text":"Gecko is my favorite restaurant close to home. Chicken Tortilla soup is my favorite soup and theirs is by far the best I've ever had! The amount you get for the price is amazing. My husband always gets the fajitas and he loves them. Also they have a dessert that is strawberries in a sweet cream that is so good. I get it every time we go to take home because I am so full by the time we leave I can't eat it. Service is always good and quick. Be prepared for a little wait to be seated though because they are always so busy. If I could give them more stars I would!!!"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp! I love them. Every time we come the food , service and experience is amazing. 

The fiesta tacos are my favorite! If your in the east valley is the place to go ! Give it a try you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Only been here once, Our waitress was bubbly to say the least.  I had the classic taco/enchilada/beans& rice combo & it was fair at best, the taco being the most eatable.  My wife had the Camarones Rancheros and she claims it was the best she ever had.  The salsa was way mild so we asked for hot salsa, when she came back she said to be careful, its like fire, well closer to ice than fire & it didnt have any taste on top of it.  If I was in the neighborhood I'd give it another try, but wouldn't go out of my way."}
{"text":"Very clean , good + service, very good menu.  So far all the food has been very good to excellent.  Two salsas , one is a sweet mango the other is a classic mild red.  I wish they had a real hot sauce to offer . Carna Asada is one of the better ones around. We will be back"}
{"text":"My wife & I just dined here and I still don't know quite what to make of the place.  But I'll be back, rest assured.

We had Tampiquena & Special Chimi.  The Tampiquena (sp?) had nice Carne Asada, fresh guac, rice & beans.  The Special Chimi was filled with tender, flavorful all white meat chicken.  The sauce on the Chimi was very different but I liked it more as I worked through my meal.  It was a cheesy white sauce with flavors of chili verde.

Speaking of chili verde, one of the 3 items that came with the tortilla chips was green chili (as well as frijoles and a nice red salsa) that was surprisingly complex.  It was slightly sweet, had a mild bite and a faint smoky flavor.  It worked very well mixed into the frijoles.

How they pull off BBQ I don't know, but I'll update when I return."}
{"text":"We frequent this location, and have never been let down. Today was no exception; good service good food.  The gecko burro deep fried is my order of choice, try it!"}
{"text":"Talk about a good meal for the price, this place is outstanding. It is clean and the service has always been good. Dollar for dollar, this place rocks."}
{"text":"First time here. It was pretty busy, but the wait was short. Staff was very courteous and friendly. Food was good. Split the combo fajitas w/my BF and found the chicken, steak & shrimp to be delicious! Kids had a veggie burrito & an enchilada combo.. Both enjoyed. Only one, teeny, tiny suggestion.. Ordered 2 Pacificos (bottles) that could have been much colder. Asked for cold glasses that weren't that much colder. An ICE cold Mexican beer is always a plus with some yummy Mexican food :)"}
{"text":"Best bean dip ever! I love the great easy going setting and delicious food! They also moved closer to my house. Which is awesome!"}
{"text":"The food here is great! I always get the mini chimis and love them. The salsas and bean dip are always really good. The only thing that kinda turns me off is how everytime I walk in I'm not greeted. I always end up standing there while the employees are either walking by or looking over at us. Kinda awkward. But besides that the staff is friendly!"}
{"text":"They offer chips and salsa with different salsas.  Ordered a quesadilla  and it was bomb.com.  Food is good and priced reasonable."}
{"text":"Food was below par and service was below par. Had a chimichanga for my main course. Wasn't outright bad but not great. Chips and salsa were slow to refill and salsa containers were small and difficult to dip into unless it was right in front of you. Had a margarita which again was not bad but great.The outdoor courtyard was nice but in itself not enough to bring me back when there are much better options in the area."}
{"text":"So amazing, I am scared if I write a good review because I will let the secret out! :) Being a pescatarian, this place is literally like heaven on earth for me! Their chips and dip/green salsa are sooooo amazing too, I could probably drink the salsa by itself (don't judge me)! ;)   But yeah, once you try it, you'll be hooked!"}
{"text":"For a small awkwardly located restaurant, this place is awesome! We've eaten here several times in the past and the experience is always been great. This time around I ordered the salmon and mango salsa enchiladas, which were fantastic. Highly recommend trying these,m."}
{"text":"Came here a few weeks ago. GREAT food, loved the patio with the fountain! Will 100% return"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this restaurant. Been going since back when they were located on Gilbert Rd. 

We love the green salsa and the bean dip. And the shrimp mango quesadilla is awesome. I would absolutely recommend Gecko Grill to anyone. 

Do yourself a favor and go try the bean dip. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Awesome food, best shrimp ceviche in town!  Awesome prices and I've never had a bad experience there - all the employees are always extremely nice.  Only down side is they no longer have their location in Queen Creek!"}
{"text":"Went here with a really good friend to eat and catch up on our lives. This is a new location, but have never been here to try their food...always wanted to. It is definitely an \"American style\" Mexican place...so don't read too much into this place.

Anyway, my friend and I liked the food we ordered and this could be our \"hey, let's catch up\" place. It's hot at this time in AZ (July) and usually we would sit inside with the a/c, but it was really cold and we opted to go out to the patio area under the shades and misters. It's funny how it reminded us being on the jungle ride at Disneyland, lol!

My friend ordered the spinach enchilada (had a bite and it was really tasty, especially with the spinach cream sauce). I ordered the seafood enchilada and that was good too. The next time I order that, I will ask them to put the pineapple \"cream cheese\" sauce on the side because it was a little too much, but tasty otherwise. I took home half of it because it was filling, so it was 1st dibs whoever wanted the leftovers when I got home (hubby won!). We both totally loved the chips and the warm bean dip, what a plus to serve with alongside their salsa. I want to go back for the breakfasts the next time. Thanks, Gecko!"}
{"text":"Service is consistently inconsistent. Food is slow to come out. Sunday morning and i am one of 10 people in here and for a green chili skillet and B&G i have already waited 45 min. Silly. Food is pretty good.. Chips and salsa are really good and the bean dip they serve with it rocks. Wish they could get the service and speed down...i would come here more often. Life is too short to waste waiting for \"pretty good\" food."}
{"text":"Oh, boy, we walked out furious. We have been to the Moreno's at Main and Power numerous times and always raved about their wonderful service and lovely people and atmosphere. Decided to try this one. We sat at a window table; the window  was covered with flies which were obviously coming in constantly from outside. We asked for napkins and killed about 20 of them as more kept coming in. We asked our waitress if they knew there was a problem with flies. She smiled sweetly  and said yes, they do know and something about the landscaping company leaves the door open. Well, the door was far from our problem and it was clear that the flies were coming in through the window edges as we watched them.  In addition, we asked for several items several times which no one showed up with and there was a definite atmosphere of we were bothering them. My husband explained the fly deal (politely) when we paid at the counter and the person just looked at him and never said a word. There was a gang of workers just clustered around the counter doing nothing. 
I made my living as a server for years and I never really have seen anything like this. My husband probably going to call the Health Dept. He wanted to stiff the lazy uncaring inept server although I talked him into leaving a couple of bucks.  What a joke."}
{"text":"Poor service from a completely un motivated waitress who insisted substitutions were not allowed though they menu states they are. Tried to build the requested combo a la cart but she misses parts of the order. Food was okay but below expectations based on other locations. I highly suggest you skip this restaurant and visit their Gilbert road sister location."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed dinner here the other night. I got the Pollo Fundido which is a fried chimi stuffed with chicken and covered in cream cheese and cheedar. Seriously....how could that not be good?

My only complaint is the salsa is a little thin. I  like a chunkier salsa, but that is hardly anything that would stop me from going back.

We had no waiting and a quiet dining experience. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"The food was okay, prices are friendly, and the service needs a little work. I had the Ceviche tostado and Crab stuffed Relleno, both had a nice flavor with a little spice. I wasn't a fan of the rice.. it lacks flavor. My husband ordered a side of Mango salsa, which was basically a condiment size of chopped up mangoes? I don't think we will return, but overall, for the price it was ok."}
{"text":"I really didn't like the food here. I came here as people told me this was really good Mexican. Honestly, it's more like tex-mex. I thought food was bland, dry, boring. I've had way better elsewhere with bigger portions for the same price. If I wanted tex-mex I would rather go to Nando's."}
{"text":"My son C was disappointed with last nights visit to Chipotle, I told him we could try another place tonight. I Yelped Mexican and found Gecko Grill. 
I was suprised by how large the place was. Dining on both sides of the door as you walk in plus a good sized patio.
The hostess sat us at a 4 top & we almost immediately asked her if we could move to a duece next to the stone wall. She oblidged. It took awhile for our server Francisco to show up so after he took our drink order & started to leave I told him we were ready to order. I wasn't sure when we would see him again.
A busser eventually brought us the chips, salsa duo & bean dip. Both salsas were very good as was the bean dip.
C wasn't overly impressed with the burrito he had last night so we tried again. C ordered the Carne Burrito, $5.99, with Carne Asada, cheese instead of beans, salsa fresca on the side. He loved it. It was just what he was looking for. The steak is grilled & chopped really small. Not overly seasoned so don't expect much spice. C loved it though.
I ordered the Tejano Burro with adobada pork. $7.19. It was fine, nothing special. Of all the ingredients inside the burro; pork, anaheim green chile, cheese, beans, guacamole and salsa fresca, the guacamole had the strongest flavor.
Francisco was m.i.a. most of the meal but eventually he brought our bill. M.i.a.again, it took another 5 min or so for him to run the c.c. and bring it back to our table.
Really good chips & salsa, good food, slow server. 3 Stars."}
{"text":"The food is good,  it's the service that is the problem. When you sit in an empty restaurant for over an hour waiting for your food to come out only to be told there's a \"ticket problem\" in the kitchen so your order didn't go in (with no apology), it's time to rethink your breakfast choices. This is the 3rd time I've tried this place and the 2nd time I've waited over an hour for my food. Won't be back. On a side note,  2 stars because the food is good. .maybe try take out."}
{"text":"We were in the area as my husband likes to play WH 40K at a local game store there and hunger struck.  So, I got out my trusty Yelp and found this gem which was less than a block away.  

Upon entering we were greeted by really friendly faces.  Seated immediately we smelled good things in the air that whetted our appetite. The waitress was adorable and clearly loved the food there as after hearing we were first timers there was joyfully telling us her favorites on the menu and why.  I love it when waiters do that cuz sometimes I don't have any pre-set food decisions.  She brought us our drinks with some chips and red and green salsa with an additional bean dip (Yum!) while we looked over the menu.  I decided on their street Tacos with their Mixta (grilled pork and beef mix) plate which gave 3 perfect sized street tacos and a side of both Spanish rice and refrained beans.  The meat was really delicious and had plenty browned crusty bits of fat and meat and though it wasn't fall apart tender it was quite delicious.  Pared with the onion, cilantro, and cabbage.  Yum!  Their smokey salsa they serve with it added just enough heat that it made me happy.  The rice was also quite flavorful - i liked it a lot.  My husband had their Chicken Tacos and he ate them up, yum!  He said the chicken was moist and packed great flavor, the lettuce was crisp and the flavors blended perfectly.  I know he will definitely make this a regular spot to grab a bit when he is at the game store.  We live in Scottsdale so I will only get to enjoy it when I tag along - but now I have a great reason to do it - so I can eat the street tacos here!  

All this combined with the reasonable prices makes this a fantastic spot.

Thank you for a great lunch and a fantastic first impression."}
{"text":"The outdoor seating area is beautiful, although, you have to watch out for the birds. 

The seafood tacos were quite good; although, not my favorite in the area. 

The margaritas are large and a great bargain. 

Service was friendly and timely."}
{"text":"Although the food quality has improved over the years, the service continuously gets worse. We went again last night, and the service remains the same. No friendly smiles and the food takes such a long time. There have been times when other tables have been delivered their food before us--and there was a \"mess up in the kitchen\"--we found this out AFTER we asked our waitress where the food was. Last night, we had to ask another server for our server because he was nowhere to be seen, didn't come check on us. The food is pretty tasty, but after another bad visit last night, I'm not sure I will be returning. My advice: hire servers who actually care about customer service and not texting on their phones in the back."}
{"text":"This some of the best fish Mexican food, I love the tacos - salmon is my favorite- Awesome!"}
{"text":"We had them cater a family lunch. All of the meat was extremely salty.  The Carne asada tasted like it had been refrigerated and then reheated. Honestly, the worst Carne asada I've ever had. The shredded beef was juicy and pretty good, besides being so salty.  The pork was super salty,  but had no flavor otherwise, and was overcooked.  Prices are great, service was great,  but food is bad to mediocre."}
{"text":"I came in on a busy Friday night with my friend and was pleasantly surprised to be seated within 15 minutes. We sat outside on the patio and had our chips and salsa served promptly. I really liked their tomatillo salsa which was a little on the sweet side but spicy. I had the fiesta burrito for dinner and my friend tried their Gecko burro which came with spinach cheese sauce. Overall so good and great quality food! Will be back soon! Also want to steal the bean dip because It was so delicious. Try that with your meal instead of refried beans you won't regret It."}
{"text":"First time there and it did not disappoint. The service was exceptional. Carlos was attentive, quick and ahead of the game. The food was even better than the service. Dips that come with the chips were so good. Crab Relleno was AWESOME. Hubby had the Carne Asada and it was delish. Love the place and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this restaurant. We came here after a friends' recommendation. The restaurant itself is in a strip mall which that in itself takes away a bit of the ambiance. The outdoor seating is much nicer though. Our waiter was very awkward and second guessed every word he spoke. He seemed really shy....kinda felt bad for him. I ordered a blended Margarita....and it was terrible. It tasted like a very cheap mix, and the blender didn't even blend all of it. As for the chips and salsa....the bean dip they give us was salty, and the salsa had no spice. The green salsa is actually sweet. Onto the food, I ordered the special chimichanga with Carne Asada. It was covered in a gross (cheese sauce?) That was supposed to be spinach cream sauce. The meat was so salty I could barely stomach it, and the meat was all I could find in the chimi. So plain but they just salted the crap out of it to make up for it. All in all I will never return here.....taco bell is better....and cheaper."}
{"text":"Terrible service!!! This is not a place to take more than 4 people. Our food came out in shifts 30 min from 1st dish on table to last. No chip refills no sofa refills with out flagging someone down."}
{"text":"Great breakfast! lots of traditional Mex items to choose from but got the chiliqueas (can't spell:) w/green sauce. Was Not disappointed. Had lunch a while back but can't remember what it was:) But it was good enough to warrant coming back for."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast, good food, friendly staff.  Enjoy Moreno's omelette and sitting outside in the covered patio.  Quick lunch, great servers...  We ordered a \"holiday\" appetizer platter for our friends, great reviews by all."}
{"text":"Love this place! They have a great menu and delicious food. I love the Chicken Mango Quesadilla and Lettuce Wrap Tacos"}
{"text":"The carne asada burrito is delicious! I love the green salsa & chips! Sweet but tasty!"}
{"text":"Gecko grill has been a staple for our family. It's almost kept us together. Especially the location on Gilbert and Guadalupe before they moved. All these years later we are still coming. 

The last hour sitting here together as a family we have been having to constantly send our food back, get more silverware, and everyone's food came out 25 minutes apart. The food wasn't bad, after they corrected it. The waitress and other help that came seemed wildly apathetic to helping us. And it made you almost felt guilty for ordering or asking for more soda. 

Our waitress was shy, but was willing to help us. I blame the overall vibe of the restaurant. MAybe the staff was yelled at earlier or something crushed every employees dreams and that left them feeling lethargic and down. Anyway, food was still good but never experienced careless service like this."}
{"text":"We have been here 2 times now. Really great trio of homemade salsas you get with your chips. Our meals have been very fresh and excellent service. Was even impressed a girl was washing the windows of the front door, which indicates they care about cleanliness and appearance. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Suprisingly good. Went here with my pops the other day for breakfast. I had the breakfast quesadilla and it was actually really good. They did make me pay for some sour cream but thats okay. Our server was nice but nothing to cry home about. I would go here again!"}
{"text":"First off the place has a home style vibe. Outside has a little patio with heaters for when it's cold. The prices are super cheap and worth it. Bean dip is awesome with the chips. Service was good and fast. I got the #11 which was cheese enchiladas with a tamale and my gf got the #1 which was these cheese enchilada a hard taco. Both were good. I would def come back"}
{"text":"I will admit Gecko grill has good food, but they have the worst customer service on the planet. three of us ordered but because only one of paid they would only give us one little thing of salsa to share, I tried to make three separate orders but they would still only give us one salsa to share, unless we paid for each order individually ourselves. We could care less about the stupid chips we just wanted salsa for our tacos! Signed very disappointed"}
