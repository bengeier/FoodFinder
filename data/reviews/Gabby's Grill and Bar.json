{"text":"I walked in here to try it and had a Greenhouse Juicery bottle in my hand and I was asked to put it away.  Please.  I was immediately irritated.  In no way was my juice going to take away from the business I gave to you - until you said that.  Then I ordered less simply because of the rudeness.  Your food is nowhere in the same league so you should take whatever business you can get and be glad anyone stops in."}
{"text":"Usually this bar is fun and friendly.. however not on sunday nights apparently!!!! Liam our waiter was condescending and aloof to our group. The late night menu is terrible and the nachos were soggy with very little toppings. No one cared about our satisfaction, in fact no staff seemed interested in any patrons that night!!! Never going back."}
{"text":"On a rainy day after an afternoon at the theatre we ran from Italian place to Italian place.... Finally Gabby's jumped out  as something different and affordable..  We were greeted and seated quickly.  Our server was fast and friendly and seemed to know the menu quite well. Our wings and sweet potato fries came quickly and were warm and tasty. Overall a great spot to stop downtown....."}
{"text":"First time eating here ordered the poutine burger and I was a but skeptial at first but I'm glad I went with my gut feeling because it was amazing a bit sloppy so wouldn't recommend for a first date lol but other then that it was fantastic I'll definetly be returning!"}
{"text":"I've never been a fan of Gabby's due to the crap food and it always is a bit sad inside. This Gabby's is all about the patio and the location. The patio is huge and it was pretty hopping when we went for a drink after our film across at TIFF.   **summer drinks on the patio before or after a film or play - beware that this is loud with a touch of douche**"}
{"text":"Came here 2 days in a row on a Sunday and Monday. I was staying down the street at the Hyatt. Bathrooms have a pissy smell. Food is good, though. Not many patrons. I'm curious when there busy time is."}
{"text":"Went there on a thursday night on the outside terrace... Very poor service Had to ask twice to have my table cleaned  The waitress was smitten but she only came once to offer us a drink We ordered our apetizers and dinner and...waited, waited and waited till the waitress (who never came back since our arrival; 45 minutes) arrived with all our food : apetizers and dinner in the same service!!! Never seen that... She said she didn't know we didn't want all this together..dah!! There is good music outside The food is just okay Can't believe they have such a nice outside terrace and they don't have better service.."}
{"text":"Awesome patio for summer complete with Muskoka chairs. Wings have to be the best bar wings downtown. Fish and chips a winner too"}
{"text":"This place is in a very convenient location.  The service was alright,  it wasn't terrible but it wasn't fantastic either.    I'd highly recommend their patio.  They have an awesome patio.  However, I wish I could say the same thing about their food.  It's fairly priced,  but the quality is somewhat subpar depending on what you get.  I'd recommend eating somewhere else first and just come here for drinks on the patio.   The beer selection is also fairly limited.  I think they have about 10 beers on tap with only a few being from some local breweries.  But,  hey the patio is very nice"}
{"text":"Let me take you on our journey on a Thursday afternoon. Been here before and thought it was decent. Walked by today and thought \"why not\". On our way in the waitress forces her way out the front door to the patio hitting my leg. Didn't let us pass or hold the door for us. Strike 1. Waited at the front area to be seated... 3 servers walk right by us... 4 if you include the one who hit me with the door. So we seat ourselves after asking a server if it was ok. Strike 2. Finally we sit there waiting and no one acknowledges us... Even the server I asked if we could sit..... 5mins, 10mins... Strike 3. The kicker...They weren't even busy! All of this for \" OK\" food... No thanks. Goodbye I don't ever want to see this place again. You shouldn't either."}
{"text":"Horrible service, restaurant was not busy, grabbed a seat at the bar with my boyfriend and we weren't even acknowledged. Waited 5 minutes and walked out"}
{"text":"Mostly, this place is convenient.  If you're going to a show at the Lightbox or one of the theaters east of John, you're probably looking for someplace close by that doesn't have a line out the door--and hey, if it's got a patio, all the better.  Gabby's has a patio.  And a no-surprises menu: mushy veggie burger? Extra charge for sweet potato fries instead of regular fries?  Check and check.  It's fine if you're in a hurry, but if not, seriously, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"My family and I travelled to Toronto, Canada and decided to eat at Gabby's. We were starving! We ordered different meals. Each meal was delicious so we sampled each other's food. The condiments were just as good too.  Pleasantly surprised!"}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday for lunch. We ordered nachos as appetizer with chicken (~$15). It was ok... There wasn't enough cheese to hold the nachos and chicken together. Plate also lacked nacho chips which was a little bit disappointing. I ordered fish tacos for main (~$12), comes with 2 tacos and side of fries. They weren't really tacos as they were wrapped in tortilla bread instead of taco shells. The fries were also a bit soggy.   Was here last time for soup and salad (~$9) for lunch as well, that tasted a bit better. I would only give it two stars if it wasn't for their outdoor patio, it's a nice and spacious area on the side of the restaurant. It's always packed so get here early to get a seat."}
{"text":"Decent-ish food but bad service. We asked for fish and chips and upon inquiring after 50 min turns out the kitchen never received the order. In turn, they were hardly apologetic. Not going there again, despite the fact their patio is nice. They can really make good business out of it, but they are not interested."}
{"text":"I was walking around downtown with a friend for what seemed like an eternity, searching for a place to have a pint... or pitcher--it was a particularly HOT day and we needed the draughts stat! Walked past a bunch of restaurants, with prices just a smidgen above what we wanted. Came to Gabby's and it seemed inviting, not too crowded (it was approximately 6 p.m.) The service was nice; the food was... decent (on par with your average bar food). I had the Veggie burger, side of fries, and my friend got wings (he rated them as o.k.) For a little over $15, we got a pitcher of Rickard's Red. It equaled to about 6 glasses. The ambiance was nice. The weather being fair allowed us to sit on the patio. 4/5."}
{"text":"I would probably come back to this place to drink rather than eat. Food is average, seasoned well but not extraordinary. I had boneless chicken wings with Korean BBQ sauce that came with french fries. Portions could be larger and the food served warmer, however staff is quick and atttentive."}
{"text":"my friend's girl friend took someone else's beer by mistake. the waitress let us know about the mistake, and we apologized and paid 10$ to cover the mistake. I thought that was fair and everything is settled.  But the waitress told the person who the beer belonged to that we took his beer. next thing we know, this 50 year old drunk couple came at us yelling and threatening to beat us up. the guy pushed my friend and he almost fell down. he even reached in his pocket to take out a gun or a knife or something, but turned out he was bluffing. All this over a bottle of beer. The manager then immediately asked us to leave the bar and not come back. He (the manager) used the F word way too many times at us. He was rude and had no class whatsoever. I tried to calmly tell him we understand our mistake, and that we have already paid for it but he kept swearing at me (I wasn't even the one who was at fault) I understand we made a mistake and agree that the girl who was with us was out of the line, but we did pay for our mistake.   The real problem is how the management dealt with this problem. they shouldn't have told the costumer and just replaced their drinks without them knowing. that's the professional way of handling situations such as this.  I will never ever set my foot in that place with its rude and unreasonable staff."}
{"text":"This place has a nice pub atmosphere and is conveniently located. The service is ok, not the best and not the greatest. I ordered the fish and chips...they were good, like other places. However, it was served with Kraft tarter sauce (EWWWW) even though the menu said it would be served with house made tarter sauce. My sister ordered a steak which was just ok. She asked for medium rare and it was well done!! She didn't finish it.  The menu is well priced and the place was relatively clean. Though this is a good location, it is a busy street and the side walk is really small and all the restaurants have seating on the patio (which is the sidewalk). A panhandler was sitting right in front of the entrance and a few walked by disturbing diners. Also, people tied their dogs to the patio railings!! Which I personally did not like!!"}
{"text":"My sister and I went to Gabby's on a weekday night after a long day of work. Overall, the experience left MUCH to be desired. We sat right by the window and was served by Erin. There were two other tables that had couples and another table with a decent sized group of people (approximately 8? persons). Erin's attention was strictly focused towards the large table the entire time we were there. She nearly ignored the rest of the tables while she constantly checked in on the group (it didn't appear that they called her over most of the time.. she just kept checking on them). I understand she wants to get a big tip but at the cost of 3 other tables? I think she needs to get her priority straight.   The food we received weren't as 'full' as the tables beside us which was depressing in itself. My sister's piece of battered fish was a couple inches long... literally.  Erin failed to tell me chipotle mayo was NOT included with my order of sweet potato fries when I initially ordered. When I asked her for it later on after receiving my dinner, she told me it cost a $1 extra...lame. If I knew this beforehand, I would have been content with normal fries. I would have probably gotten a lot more too.    I'm giving one star based on this experience and the service that was provided.   To be fair, I went to a Gabby's at a different location and my overall experience was much, MUCH more desirable."}
{"text":"Middle of the road PUB FOOD style menu ... The best thing about this place is the patio in Summer ...."}
{"text":"Great outdoor patio and friendly waiting staff. Only reason it doesn't get top marks is because we had to wait to be give a table while the hostess fixed someones hair, whilst we were stood right in front of them. Shame but didn't spoil the visit!"}
{"text":"I've been to Gabby's a few times where the food was really good and then I have been where the food was meh. I feel like the food and service you get all depends on who is working that night. It's still a fun place to go and hang out, have a couple of drinks and still be able to hear what your friends are saying."}
{"text":"I once came in here alone and ordered 5 double tequilas in about 45 minutes (alone). They didn't pass judgement on me. I liked that.   PS if we're talking about a place to hang out with people / eat food....  don't. it's tacky shit."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch on Friday and sat on the patio. We sat and waited for some menus.....for 30 minutes. Servers were walking around, didn't seem that busy (the patio wasn't packed but it was fairly full) but nobody came to out table. We finally flagged aomeone down, who came and apologized, took our orders, and then told us our food would be 20-30 minutes. When we explained that we'd already been there for 30 minutes and, while we weren't asking for the world,  asked of a small rush could be put on out table, we were told that the kitchen we to busy.  Certainly they cooked lunch the day before and had a good sense of a lunch rush in downtown Toronto entailed, but alas, their 20-30 minute warning was spot on (31 minutes to be exact).   The food was fine (2 burgers, 1 salad).   Our bills came and upon requesting debit, was told that they don't offer debit. In 2015. In downtown Toronto.   I have no reason to return."}
{"text":"Worst service ever anywhere. Started as soon as we walked in. No one greeted is for a about 10 min. Fries were underdone. Drinks took for ever, and then they got one of the beers wrong. Replacement took a long time again, and tasted off. One of the meals was completely cold. The other meal got here 20 minutes after everyone else's. I was tempted I ask for gong we could ring every time something went wrong, that would have at least been entertaining!  We spoke with the manager and at least they recognized that this wasn't right and comped us a bunch of things. I'll likely go back to other Gabby's but not likely this one."}
{"text":"This is more of a family bar. You know the kind where it's ok to bring the kids. I ordered a small kale salad & poutine. The salad was amazing. Highly recommend getting that if you like kale. Poutine was ok. I like my fries a bit crunchier with poutine. The service was ok. The waitress forgot my beer and the used the excuse that it was the bartenders fault when she was delivering beer to other tables. She was also more concerned about clearing the patio that we had to wait a bit to get a refill on drinks.   Overall if I had the option id probably put this as a last resort on my list."}
{"text":"Walking for a while after the friday night jazz fest , my friend and I decided to try this place out.  We weren't starving - but really just wanted a snack and mainly some drinks.   I got the chicken strips with fries - the chicken strips were good - the first bite.. the middle part was questionable. Oddly, the fries looked like they were still raw, but were pretty delicious.  friend got the wings  - dry, barely any meat...  how is it so packed here? - it must be the patio.   Asking for a side sauce was almost impossible.  Drinks never came. Server never came back, HA! This was a weird dinner.   Asked another server for our bill. - Guess what, they don't take interac? WHAT? - ughh.  Total- $40.18   - jury says? - BOOOOURNS!  xoxo M."}
{"text":"We walked through the city looking to sit outside to have dinner as it was such a nice day, and came across this booming spot, full of people and decided we would try there! To be honest the atmosphere was great but it was a little cramped and noisy for my liking, ( this was outside in the side garden) and there was barely any room to get up from your seat because there was another table and chairs behind you! We did enjoy it regardless though and the service was top notch!  The food looked amazing, but I'm afraid it was only ok.. My fiancé got ribs to start and they were amazing! But my vegetarian burger was just ok (it was supposed to be portabello mushrooms and cheese etc and it came in a thin patty instead.. Tbh I couldn't taste it when I was eating, which was disappointing.. and my fiancé said his steak sandwich was only alright too.. So all in all not great food considering it looked so nice! I mean maybe the rest of the menu was epic but I mean, otherwise if you come for a drink the musics in the background and it's good crack! Would be back for a drink and snack maybe but not for a full meal"}
{"text":"Great patio, especially for the crowded stretch of King street it's on. The food is just ok, relatively underwhelming pub food. We had the wing special and were surprised how mild their spicy wings were. Good selection of beers on draft and the service is relatively good. I would recommend for patio drinks but do dinner somewhere else."}
{"text":"One of the few places walking distance from the Hyatt Regency that serves food late on a Monday night, Gabby's is exactly what you would hope for from a divey bar. The food is cheap and good, the beer is cheap and mediocre and the bartender is long-suffering.  This seems to be a place where locals go to hang out... especially those in the construction trade. Then again, with the Toronto boom.. every bar is a construction hangout.  Highlights include a kitchen open late, great chicken wings (Mondays and Wednesdays, the wings are less than your glass of beer), and Margot the bartender is awesome."}
{"text":"Stepped in for a meal with wife and two kids aged 10 and 9.  Atmoshere and waiter were  pleasant.  Food not so good.  Prime burger was a store bought patty on a Wonder bread bun, wings were half price but still not worth it, 10 year old like the boneless wings, 9 year old ate the fish but not the batter as it was too hard.  Everyone enjoyed the fries and pops, but lemonade was not available even though we were offered one.  If we were not in a hurry to cross the street for The Lion King production starting soon, I would have refused the overpriced burger and exchanged it for a sandwich, hoping it may taste better.  May have enjoyed Gabby's if I was with the boys  and we were really, really drunk.  Maybe."}
{"text":"Went for the half priced wings (with purchase of a beverage) on a Monday after work. The patio is nice and the restaurant's location is very central. The wings were just ok. I prefer St. Louis Wings anyday. I ordered the Hot and Honey which was several times hotter than the Ghost Chili flavour which technically is the hottest chili in the world. Good place to chill with friends, but don't expect spectacular bar food."}
{"text":"It was a Friday, around lunch time, the sun was shining, the city was bustling and my tummy was rumbling. My co-workers and I had decided to go for a liquid lunch in the heart of the entertainment district so we could sit on a patio and \"soak up some sun\".  Gabby's, located on King St West, between John st and Blue Jays way has one of the best street level patios on King West so we decided to head on over for a pint (or two) and a quick bite.   Upon arrival we were informed that the pub was too busy and that there would be a 15 minute wait before we could be seated. I found that odd seeing as the patio had several tables available, and when I enquired the hostess informed me that the kitchen was backed up. \"What about drinks?\" I asked. To which she responded \"The kitchen is backed up and my manager says we can't seat anyone?\" (Yes she asked it as a question, so she wasn't even sure). I've never met an establishment who was against making money LOL.  At any rate I digress, while the wait was unsavoury, we were seated within the 15 minutes we were told and had a great spot on the patio with couches overlooking King West. Very Comfy and Posh.  We ordered a round of beers to keep us cool in the dense Toronto heat and everything turned around from there (as it usually does). We decided to place a food order after a short time and here is what we had:  #1 - Buffalo Chicken Sandwich with side of fries (colleague 1) #2 - Buffalo Chicken Strips with side of fries (colleague 2) #3 - Great Amazing Burger w/ Fries (the days special) (Colleague 3) #4 - Great Amazing Burger w/ Fries (the days special) (ME)  While my colleagues all enjoyed their meals and wolfed them down with vigour, I felt it important to tell you about this Great Amazing Burger, and why it should be a regular menu item instead of a special.  The GAB, was one of the tastiest burgers I've had in awhile (and I've eaten them all over our city). It literally was everything I could want in a burger: Two toasted buns with all the fixings (pickle, tomato, lettuce, onion), a thick cut beef burger, topped with bacon and cheese ... pretty GREAT so far, however here is where the AMAZING part kicks in ... then Gabby's layered on some pulled pork and sauce and 2 deep friend onions rings. OOOOOO EMMMMMM GEEEEEEE!  I might as well enjoy this 2500Calorie beast while I still can, and I fully intend to. It was perfectly cooked, juicy and hit me with 4-5 flavour combinations all at once. Something that combined with their stellar patio will keep me coming back to Gabby's time and time again."}
{"text":"Sub par all around (even for me, a lover of all pub food).  Don't order the steak frites, tasteless and horrible.  The service was also poor.  The patio is nice, and the location is convenient, but surrounding restaurants are much better.  (You know when you 'post' a review, and Yelp asks Good for: dessert, dinner, etc.? I was looking for a 'nothing' box that I could check)"}
{"text":"Good spot but service was just ok.  Will visit again but expectations will be better managed."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went to watch the Book of Mormon at the Princess of Wales theatre and were a little hungry afterwards. I wanted to treat her to a nice day in Toronto and she saw the Gabby's sign and said it looked fun and delicious so we went in!   Boy, were we wrong...   We were sat beside two girls in their young 20s loudly complaining about how unfair one of their fathers was being to her for not giving her a car or something. That was fine, it wasn't the restaurant's fault.   But we happened to have gone when the Blue Jays had an 18 inning game. There were loud drunken men screaming and chanting the entire time, my girlfriend and I couldn't hear what the other was saying. But, we decided to give the restaurant a chance anyways because we had already sat down and it would have been rude to just leave.  The waitress although attentive at times, completely disappeared after she gave us our food which took about 50 minutes to get to our table.   I had ordered the Wings and she had ordered the BBQ burger. She had taken one bite and almost threw up due to the bread. She said the meat was like any other home made burger meat we could have made at home but the bun was disgusting.  The wings I can tell you are the worst wings I've ever had in my life. I never knew it was possible to ruin chicken wings but this place definitely did it. It was disgusting.   Food - 1/10 Atmosphere - 4/10 Service - 2.5/10  This place completely ruined date night for us. I would recommend that you STAY away!   Book of Mormon by the way was great! :)"}
{"text":"Two very different experiences in the same weekend.  Me and my husBAND ventured in for lunch on Saturday looking for a cool (physically cool) spot to regroup in.  We were the only ones sitting inside, but were treated to friendly and efficient service none the less.  The food was just very average and they didn't have a giant range of liquors to choose from.  We had our 1 drink and our lunch and then moved on.  Probably would have given them 3 stars based on that experience.  We returned as a large group on Sunday night late night (about midnight) after a nearby wedding.  No one else on that strip of King Street was open so, by default, we all ended up here.  We were treated to the absolute unfriendliest service that we experienced in all of Toronto (including the nasty cab driver that apparently hates King Street).  None of the wait staff smiled nor did they act like they wanted us there.  A couple of people were so turned off that they left before ordering their first drink.  Some others ordered 1 and then left soon after.  The vast majority of the group stayed and were treated with this attitude until they closed.  I mean, I get 1 server in a restaurant possibly having an attitude, but the entire wait staff?  COME ON!!!    We were talking to the bartender at our hotel about this experience the next day and she was shocked at this.  She explained that Gabby's gets all of the late night crowd typically as the other bars close earlier.  So, they are used to the random late overflows.  So, in summary, an OK spot to pop in for lunch for a quick bite, but definitely do not suggest hitting this place up late night.  Unless you like being made feel like a hindrance."}
{"text":"I was visiting from Los Angeles. I had a great time in Toronto this day and wanted something to eat late night. I left my hotel and walked over to Gabby's. I walked in, no one was there to greet. So I asked the first person I saw who happened to be this waiter. He was slim, black, kind of effeminate. I asked him where can I order take out. He looked at me, rolled his eyes, ignored me and walked away. I walked up to him and asked him again...\"WHERE DO I ORDER TAKEOUT?\" He snapped his little head and pointed.   If I was my old self, I would have taken him outside and drilled him into the ground.   I can't say I'll be back to this place. Sometimes these things just wears on you and shows if this little fart can behave like this, there's issues with management. Which I told and nothing was done. Only excused as he must of had a bad day."}
{"text":"Divine chicken fingers, best in the city! Really great customer service, very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Hello, my name is Kelly, and  I think I might love Gabby's. I can't exactly put my finger on it, but there's something about this place that is just, so... awesome. Despite being in the douchy-esque/tourist trap area of King St., Gabby's has an old school, small town feel.  From the Golden Tee in the corner, to the dark and woodsy bar, Gabby's makes me feel like I'm back home in Chatham, Ontario.  Tall Boy Tuesdays and frequent wing nites just make me feel so right.  There's no pretensions here, just great service and perfectly acceptable bar food.  It's not gourmet, but if you're looking for a Coors Light and some onion rings in a place where everybody knows your name - this is it."}
{"text":"I'm officially done with this place.   After putting the King W Gabby's on a hard ban for two years because of terrible service and the tiniest wings imaginable, I decided to pop in for a quick pint after work today because:   a) It was 24C, sunny and the patio has a ton of potential  b) I was thirsty  c) There was work to do at home that was getting in the way of having a cold pint.   Once again, I was disappointed. I sat on a 1/5th-filled patio for many minutes without attention with a fellow beer drinker and was completely ignored. Being the kind of guy that I am, I decided to take matters into my own hands, so I went inside to order a pair of pints.   When I approached the bar with my order, the bartender was about to pour my pints when he asked, \"Are you sitting on the patio?\" I answered, \"Yeah. I've been there a while, so I decided to grab them myself\" to which he responded, \"Oh. You'll have to go out and wait for your server.\"   Whaaaaaaa??!? I immediately packed up my gear and hit another patio up the road that was all over getting pints on the table.   Congrats, idiots. You're on the hard ban list."}
{"text":"After walking down the row of restaurants for literately 30 minutes, my bf and I decided to grab a quick dinner at Gabby's since it was one of the only non-Italian restaurants offered. We were in the mood for some good bar food and this was just the place. We had the cheesy garlic bread, chili thai wings, sweet potato fries, fries with cheese and gravy, and burgers. Yes, I know what you are thinking, how can two people eat soooo much food. Don't worry, we didn't disappoint you, we ate everything and everything was delicious! I especially liked the chili thai wings. But don't be fooled, we rolled out of there once we were done, but it was worth it :-)"}
{"text":"***** 3.5 stars *****  Gabby's was ok, but certainly not something I would recommend anyone stopping in for considering all the other options in this area. The service here was really good, and our waiter even split the ticket 12 ways, which was something we found rare in Toronto.  We ordered a large plate of their fries with their version of \"poutine\" on top to share amongst ourselves. This was my first attempt to find this Quebecian craze in Toronto, and should have led me to stop my search, but my diligence continued to bring me disappointments. Here, they just sprinkle some crated cheese on top and cover it with a boring brown gravy. Sure it tastes ok, because gravy makes just about anything taste like gravy, which is usually a moderately good thing. The problem is I wanted to see what the real thing was like, most specifically the cheese curd portion, but I suppose I'll have to wait to visit Montreal to find that out.  As far as dinner goes the fajitas I ordered turned out pretty good, with the one flaw being what i considered a lack of meat, accompanied my mountains of onions and peppers. The flavors were all pretty generic fajita flavors, with the usual assortment of condiments on the side. They definitely looked like the best thing on the table, so I would have to recommend it if you must eat here.  The beer selection here is kind of mediocre, but the prices are pretty fair compared to most everywhere else on King. Come here if you have a large group and the other restaurants on the strip won't sit you."}
{"text":"Fun and busy. Great outdoor patio with a few TVs to keep up to date with your team. Full mixed menu and cold beer. Jerk chicken fajita special very tasty, as were the nachos. Busy right up to closing time."}
{"text":"Slow service and cold food. A perfect combination.  Outside seating and chicken wings were the only positives. I would not recommend."}
{"text":"Went here for a few after movies drinks. It took some time for a waiter to come up to us and service was relatively slow (in fairness, it was a Sunday long weekend and he seemed to be the only guy running the patio).  We were then told that they were out of several liquors and the blender was broken. These things happen though paired with relatively slow service we were slightly chuffed.  This was a series of unfortunate incidents. The review was saved by an awesome patio. More importantly, when we were told they were out of several liquors we just asked for \"whatever you have, and lot's of it\". I can confirm Kent's review, they don't judge!"}
{"text":"Great patio spot on King after a film at the TIFF Bell lightbox to have a beer.  Service was attentive, but the food a real let down. You're best to skip the menu entirely.  We had mediocre wings ('ghost chilli' promise but mild delivery) with packaged blue cheese and 'musty' nachos with semi-melted processed cheese.  Fries were a disappointment too. Half price Wednesday... Less than Half the expectation."}
{"text":"Needed to kill some time before meeting a friend at tiff.  Nothing better than a quick pint and watching my local sports team on tv.  Unfortunately they didn't have the volume on, so I was stuck listening in on the guys either side of me trying to pick up the bartender.  I felt sad..for everyone involved..  both groups of guys were cringe worthy.  She played them both, they enjoyed being played so who am I to judge.  Anyways.. I got beer."}
{"text":"I used to frequent Gabby's all the time when I was student.  They have a good selection of beer pitchers which is great if you're in a group.  It's also a decent place if you're interested in watching a game.  The food is your standard fare for a chain pub.  It's nothing spectacular, just 'ok'.  I can't say I'm a fan of the poutine as the cheese was oozy as opposed to squeaky like it should be in a poutine.  Maybe I've outgrown the chain restaurants/pubs but I don't like Gabby's as much as I used to.  I would probably only visit again if it was to enjoy the patio in summer."}
{"text":"Awful. Rude. 0/5 Stars for this place. Went in here on my friend's birthday for some drinks and they told me my friend was not wearing shoes (she was wearing shoes) and that she was crying which she was not. They then told me that my wife was drunk (which she was not at all). I thought it must have been a mistake, and upon discussing this with the server, and later the manager, I was stunned by the sheer rudeness and inconsiderate behaviour they showed to us. I just could not belive the untrue things they were saying to about us. Why? Why make up things that were just not true and send us out? Was it because it was near last call and they wanted to go home? Just bizarre staff in there.  I can understand if we were very drunk, but we were not. It was an awful power trip they were on. I just cannot believe anyone would treat customers that way. Subsequently, we made our way to John St. and went into another bar where we served with consideration. Way to treat a girl on her birthday!  Worst bar I have ever been in in my life! No exageration.  I was in there once before on the patio which is nice, but the food was awful and service very poor."}
{"text":"We came here during a sunny afternoon for lunch and were seated in their outdoor area. We both ordered the crispy chicken salad and thoroughly enjoyed it. My only complaint is that towards the end of our meal, birds started popping up everywhere and trying to come for our finished plates which was kinda gross. Wish they could put wiring or another barrier system up to deter the pesky animals."}
{"text":"Extremely low quality food and service, and relatively expensive.   There's really not much else to say."}
{"text":"We were visiting Toronto and found ourselves hungry and on a street with tons of restaurants.  It was a beautiful day out, so we knew we wanted a patio and a beer.  We had no reviews to go by, so we simply judged by menus, patio and beer selection.  That led us to Gabby's.  Usually I love reading reviews, but in this case I am glad I didn't because we may have passed over it and we would have missed out on a delicious lunch!  We did wait a while for service but our waiter was very apologetic and once he greeted us he was very attentive.  My boyfriend went with the ribs and I went with the wings.  We both did the maple bbq sauce.  The sauce was RIDICULOUS!  So good!  I wanted to buy it by the jar!  My boyfriend said they were the best wings he ever had- I have to say, they were very good.  He only let me have a small bite, but it was so tender and ALL the meat fell right off the bone.  The bones were 100% clean, without having to pull off the meat at all.  The wings were equally as tender and delicious.    We also felt it was fairly priced.  Both our meals came with a huge serving of fries and a side of coleslaw and we each had a beer for around $50 total.  Pretty standard pricing for a tourist area.   If we find ourselves back in Toronto, we would definitely stop in again."}
{"text":"Came here with friends for dinner. The food was disappointing. I ordered a west coast burger that is supposed to have avocado. It came with one small slice of avocado that tasted sour and has gone bad. The rest of the burger and the garden salad side were mediocre. Our main complaint is the small serving size. So we decided to order a nachos plate to share. Worst nachos I've ever had. Hardly any cheese, too much olives, even the chips were subpar. Overall the restaurant is clean and has good atmosphere and service was reasonable. Won't return again for their unsatisfying and meagre portions of low quality food."}
{"text":"Not happy with the food, combo platte and only 3 strings of chicken on it, the shrimps been deepfried to death, over pricesd for the quality of the food"}
{"text":"Came here for beers and a meal after a Jays game. The food was just okay - typical bar food. The beers were alright. Service was iffy, but it was busy."}
{"text":"Service was good, friendly.  Great location, nice patio.  Late night food menu...ordered veggie nachos...blah."}
{"text":"This place was great! Went here for lunch and i would definitely return.  Food: 4/5, for the crafty something burger. It was a nicely toasted kaiser bun with good meat and kettle chips.  It held together well unlike some burgers these days where it's just a mess.  The kettle chips as a side was also super delicious; nice and crisp.  Service: 4/5, bang on; she attended us multiple times throughout lunch and super nice over all.  It was however quite empty for lunch.  Ambience: 3/5, nice decor but the chairs were broken.  Price: 3/5, $15-20 per person, around average for the area and pub-like food."}
{"text":"our dinner reservation on friday night cant take us till 730 so this is where we had a few drinks first.   loved the patio with couches and heat lamps and awesome locations."}
{"text":"The bartender was awful. I tried to order a cocktail and she told me no, she was not going to make it. I asked her why not and she said \"cause it tastes AWFULLL. You won't like it.\" Then she didn't even make a suggestion of something else she'd recommend, she just left it at that. Of course I could have told her to make it anyway but I had a feeling she'd make the drink bad on purpose to try and prove me wrong. So we walked down the street and had drinks elsewhere."}
{"text":"Fresh off the plane and needing sustenance, we ambled by a place that served beer and burgers, and gave it a shot.  The beer was cold and delicious, according to my wife. I had iced tea, which was sweet with lemon flavor added. Not what I expected, but I did not specify. I just asked for iced tea, and I guess most Americans like it that way.  No matter. I had the Craft Burger and my wife had the Bison Burger. We were not asked how we wanted them cooked - maybe that's a local ordinance or something. The result was two semi-tasty hockey pucks.  The fries were okay and the server was a really nice guy. If you asked me point blank, I'd have to say I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review months after my check in, and the only thing I remember is fighting a shitload of bees in the outside section of the restaurant. The food was not memorable, but the beers were tall.  Run of the mill bar food, good in a pinch. I wouldn't make the trip just for Gabby's, but it's definitely good enough for a meal and a brew."}
{"text":"We came here after the Jays game on Victoria Day. There was no wait, and we were sat right away on the patio. There were a number of both drink & food specials. We had a few Corona @ $4.99/each, and we spot an order of 1/2 price wings.   Service was good considering the volume of folks, the food was mediocre. The wings seems dried out (not a big wing fan) & you could get better at St.Louis. My kid's fried were cold and there was this Mexican themed nacho appetizer (picture attached) which was quite pricing for three small nacho bite thingies. Overall, great patio and good for a quick fix. Rated a three for service & atmosphere."}
{"text":"Grabbed a bite here after a long, long drive from the States. While our patio waiter was excruciatingly slow, the food was decent. Bison burger with guac and sweet potato fries are the way to go! Loved the backyard feeling sitting beneath the strings of silvery lights."}
{"text":"Decent food, nothing special, Had just a burger and fries. No complaints but wouldn't go out of my way to eat here"}
{"text":"Horrible service, I'm sitting here while I write this. And not once have I been check up on to see if I want to order more, nor have I been given more than one glass of water."}
{"text":"Heard good things about Gabby's and decided to try it out! Getting there I was told that they only take U.S. and Canadian IDs. Wtf? A very random (even bizarre) policy, and something that I've never seen anywhere else. I was devastated literally (might sue for emotional damage). The food and service were below average anyway, so luckily there is no shortage of other places on King to choose from! Sorry Gabby, don't think I'll be returning."}
{"text":"Growing up in the suburbs of southern Ontario and then moving to a city known for its eclectic cuisine and accompanying foodie culture (which I do appreciate from time to time), I had yet to discover a place that has good dirty and extremely consistent (assembly-line) food....that is, apart from say, McDonalds. For me, Gabby's is that place. It's the Eastside Marios or Boston Pizza of Toronto. The chain provides a number of (smallish) neighbourhood locations (Roncesvalles, etc.), thereby preventing you from being surrounded by touristy types or a yuppie atmosphere. And from my experience, the wait staff have always been extremely friendly, courteous and alert. The kicker is that they have a beer of the day: a tall boy for $4.50. Mind you, they are not offering up to their customers any foreign or exotic brands - Bud and Canadian tend to be the regular choices. But hey, if you're going there in the first place, I'm sure you're the type of person who will be satisfied. Finally, a great place to meet old friends and bring (low-maintenance) dates."}
{"text":"I came here to have brunch today Saturday oh gosh, from all the places around My friend chose this one, i should have check the reviews before.  The server was really nice, we asked for coffee and ughhhhhhh what disgusting toilet water they brought wow, the waitress mention to another table that was instant coffee yuck. Seriously if you are serving brunch you better have decent coffee come on guys.  The food took forever and we were starving. The food came, i got a hamburger with fries and my friend got fajitas. The portion of meat was super little as well as in my hamburger oh my. This place is only to go watch a game at night and eat wings. Never going there for brunch or dinner"}
{"text":"The first time I came here my family probably spent around 45 minutes walking around downtown Toronto before we agreed on Gabby's. Since then we have come back twice.  For a pub scene, the food is good, & not overly expensive (like you would generally expect in downtown Toronto). The service is great, the servers are really friendly & your order doesn't take too long to arrive. The general design of the restaurant is nice & up to date.   Overall Gabby's is a good place to come for a meal if you're looking for good food at a reasonable price in downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"I always surprised at what Canadians will accept as edible. Food is below sub par they must be surviving in their bar tabs and location.  We waited 45 mins for food and salad was wilted having sat under the lamps.  Service not good slow.  Had to ask for refills .  The food had no flavour how can blue cheese dressing be bland? Don't go there if your looking for more than something to date your hunger."}
{"text":"It's rare that I'll leave a restaurant without at least giving them a fair chance, but that was my experience with Gabby's.  If you want to have a drink and watch the game I'm sure it's fine, but I wouldn't come here for a dining experience of any kind.    Their website is out of date and quite misleading with regards to their options.  Combine that with a seating arrangement for two that could barely fit a menu, let alone two plates, sitting adjacent to the ladies bathroom, and a row of serving trays sitting on a ledge mere inches from my head and I was out of there before even taking a sip of water.   Your mileage may vary, but I found that inattentiveness enough for me to leave the establishment.  I will say that the waitress was quite helpful, though visibly upset when we departed."}
{"text":"Nice patio...gets quite hot during the noon hot days... but otherwise... i liked the food... bar style but better than expected... service was friendly... great time had on the patio with colleagues..."}
{"text":"This is a nice place!  Clean and respectable, I went with a friend and my teen son.  The food was good very tasty.  I was disappointed at the rib.  They were good but too small and they looked prepackaged.   The waitress was really friendly and attentive. Lots of T.V's was a good thing as we went for super bowl."}
{"text":"After reading more reviews how the manager treats his customers - I would never have stepped into this sub par establishment.  This experience was downright appalling. Not only did we have to cancel our order but the manager was completely nonchalant about the issue. Really??? Our opinion all round was this manager behaved like a 'd$&@$e.'  He frankly didn't care. And if he says otherwise, then he definitely doesn't realize how he comes off to a lot of people listening to him speak.  We were at a work party. We had made reservation. So even if the kitchen is slow - they should have prepped for the table before hand. (Made easier with a set menu.) The manager knew his kitchen was slow so he should have worked with them to get it done. After reading reviews, he frankly doesn't care what your experience is.   One of his explanations was people from the Blue Jays game were coming. Again, that does not negate the fact we were there before the game.    The server, Claire, was great and apologetic. She honestly was the best part of it. She tried.   Yet, how can any of this be a positive reflection of  the \"Gabby's\"  restaurant? In addition, the parent company must be aware of this concern and are obviously okay with it.   However, if they are not, it does convey a low level of care of customer service.  Perhaps,only when it effects the bottom dollar will they care to investigate. For the Gabby's brand, they are as responsible for this behaviour to continue whether they didn't know or it was wilful irresponsibility.  There's no reason I would go to this place when there are so many other places to choose from on that strip of king street west."}
{"text":"Gabby's is a phenom to Toronto only it seems.  I've not seen a Gabby's anywhere other than in Toronto, but maybe it's me not looking hard enough.  The franchise is a fairly homey Canadian pub line with TVs for sports, and nightly specials that are franchise-wide.  This location is probably the closest to my place so you'd think that I'd get here a lot.  I don't, but when I do, it's not for work purposes like the other locales, it's strictly for fun.  Usually I find myself here after doing comedy somewhere, and the comics I'm with are usually up for some place cheap that has beer.  Gabby's meets the brief more oft than not.  Dark wood inside, friendly staff, and a good tap run, for franchises, this place isn't bad at all.  The patio is what makes this place stand out from the other locales and even other restaurants on the strip.  Spacious and shaded, this is a great place to hang for a pint in the summer.  The restaurant is also smack dab in the middle of theatre row, a clutch of restaurants that serve the ticket holders for the Royal Alex (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/royal-alexandra-theatre-toronto) and Princess of Wales (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/the-princess-of-wales-theatre-toronto) theatres, offering theatre-goers a cheaper dinner option."}
{"text":"Mediocre food with shitty drink selection. Service was poor as we had to flag the waiter several times before ordering."}
{"text":"Not sure why Gabby's is getting such bad reviews! I really like the place. It's not crazy fancy but we always have a good time here.  They haven't reinvented the wheel but they deserve a solid 4 stars."}
{"text":"Would love it if they acknowledged my existence as a human being within 10 minutes (max) of being seated. Sigh.   The Pickled Caesar was delicious, could be a bit spicier though."}
{"text":"Food was okay. Poor service, downright rude waitresses even though the restaurant wasn't full. Wasn't even given forks/knives with the food, and took up to 15 minutes to flag the waitress down who seemed to ignore it at first. Won't be returning to this place. Save your money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Stopped in to catch some of the ballgame and have a couple beers.  Had been strolling around the city, did a bit of star watching at TIFF, wanted one of my usual pub orders: I start with a Guinness and while it's settling I have a bottle of Henieken. Been doing this for years. Especially at non-craft beer bars.  \"Who are you with?\" I was asked by the bartender. I was alone. \"I can't serve you two at the same time because of the liquor laws.\" I called BS on that. \"Oh you know all about the laws do you\" she said followed with a \"I'm not comfortable with you 'two-fisting' at my bar.\" I left. Back in the day when living in the 'burbs I stopped by here often.  Thankfully with the amazing Bar Hop down the road I never need return."}
{"text":"Anyways stop in here while I'm in Toronto, stopped in the first time just cause it was close to the hotel on a really cold and rainy day. So glad I did, staff really nice and the burgers are great get it with horseradish cheese you can't loose. Will be back next time in town"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good and reasonably priced, and you get a good value on beer. The servers tend to forget your table if things get busy though, and anything fried (except the wings which were very good) sometimes get a little burnt. But it's a good selection and the patio offers a nice, relaxing atmosphere."}
{"text":"I thought this place was perfect for a sunny day on the patio at lunch time. We got two beers and I got the poutine burger and as this was the first I have ever tried of this type I thought it should be done in this style. It was very good and the waitress was excellent. Very calm and friendly and that is exactly how I like it. The food was great pub food but not the best thing I ever had but it tasted great. I love the patio set up and wish we could have had one of the couches. Look forward to going back."}
{"text":"Ordered and waited over an hour for our food. Our waitress, Christina, never came to check on us once. My salad was warm, fish was burnt, fries were cold. Absolutely terrible experience. We told her we were going to miss our flights and her response was \"Oh.\" Ridiculously bad."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a cold winter evening.  SERVER I had to go to the bathroom to change and asked the wait staff said they would save my table of 4 in the back corner. When I got out, there were people there. She first said \"oh they must have misunderstood\" and then she said \"oh i thought they were with you\". I would have been pissed but there was another table available in a booth which was much better.  My actual server was pretty good. He didn't bother us and came when we needed him.  FOOD nothing special to rave about. The fries were disappointing. They were luke warm and by the time I had one they were cold. No crunch or anything to them. The sweet potato fries were bad too.  The jalapeño dippers were really tasty though and so were the chicken wings. The wings were a fair size.  But for some reason, my food was only a bit warm and turned cold very vast.  PRICES the prices are great especially if you're looking for a cheap place relative to all the other restaurant on this king strip."}
{"text":"Way for a buzz kill and destroy everyone's night! had 3 drinks and was cut off by this rude waitress that I am not allowed any more drinks. The birthday boy had 10 drinks and he didn't get cut off.   Not sure how this place is still open for business!!!!  Don't ever go here!"}
{"text":"A group of us sat outside and enjoyed a quick brunch prior to heading out for the day. The service was prompt as we were seated quickly. Three of us ordered the greek omelet paired with potatoes along side a struggle of sliced lettuce and tomatoes. The omelet wasn't bad but the portion was really small and I noticed that all of our omelets looked different. A friend of mine had a more soggy omelet whereas another friend had a more hearty omelet with more veggies. My only complaint would be the portion and the consistency of the dish."}
{"text":"Great low key place to hang out!  Super friendly staff.   Very good menu, great burgers and salads.  Golden Tee in the corner.  Definitely a great place!"}
{"text":"One of the many choices to choose from along King West. I was happy that my group was able to make a reservation just two hours before lunchtime. A nice atmosphere with great music. It was top 40 I believe. We got one of the nicer seats in house i.e a booth. Our waiter was a mixture of you hate him you like him. He couldn't give a straight answer to any of the questions. I asked him what the best seller was and he kept going on and on about how people have different tastes and likes. Essentially he never answered the question. I was surprised that at lunch time with empty seats at this place our order took almost an hour before it came out. I had to inquire about it and then we got an explanation.   What I did like was the fish tacos compared to my fish and chips dish. It's a small piece of fish to be exact: they call it lunch size. The fries were ok and I didn't particularly like the coleslaw. It was not very flavourful. What drew my attention was the four fish tacos that were nicely presented infront my friend. I ended up trading fries for tacos. It was a great big mouthful of crispy tender fish mixed with all the trimmings for a delicious taco. Also, I liked that two of my friends got delicious cake and happy birthday sung to them...cake was on the house. Thanks for that!!"}
{"text":"Terrible food. Even worse service. Do yourself a favor and cross John street and goto shoeless joes."}
{"text":"Shortest review possible: Gabby's is a place to get a beer.  This is it.  Just don't expect a huge beer menu with lots of choices, or some good food to accompany your default Moosehead. Oh, and the service will be just about 2-3 stars - those girls are not hostile, they just don't care too much, which is consistent with the overall experience."}
{"text":"I dropped by on a whim on my lunch break because I was really hungry. Decided to do take outs and order their burger. The place was practically empty with a small business group that already had their food. So I was surprised that I waited for 20+ minutes for q burger and fries.   Upon receiving my bill, I asked to pay debit and was told \"we don't accept debit. There's an ATM just over there...\"   REALLY?!? No debit option at a restaurant in 2015 downtown Toronto?!  Hmm, budget cuts? Could explain the reason for lack of customers."}
{"text":"In search of a King West Patio we stumbled upon Gabby's. This particular stretch of King West is known for a variety of tourist friendly mostly upscale restaurants, which is why I was surprised that Gabby's was relatively affordable.   We came on a somewhat chilly summer eve and managed to find great spots on the patio. Only downside is that the terrible top 40 music was at full blast, negating most of our ability to have a conversation. Our true mission was however to grab some dinner, and seeing as it's hard to talk with a mouth full of food, I quickly tuned the music out and poured over the menu.  I already mentioned that the food is relatively affordable, it's the standard pub fare with some surprises thrown in.   I had a desperate craving for something on par with the BQM Ossington Burger. SoI ordered the mushroom burger, I asked for a substitute of goat cheese instead of the cheddar which cost an extra dollar. I think that's a bit nuts for a simple switch of the cheese.  Cue flavour explosion in my mouth. Give me mushrooms and goat cheese any day and I'm a happy camper, these two secret ingredients made the very average but well cooked hamburger patty do a flavour dance in my mouth.  Craving satisfied in a huge way.   I see Gabby's becoming a summer staple in my constant search for the best patios in the city."}
{"text":"This place is a bar that serves some reasonable food.  I tried the sweet chili quesadillas and they were okay.  Nothing I would order again but I don't regret ordering them.  Because it's a bar it's really loud with TVs everywhere and it's dark.  So if you're into bars then this place might be better for you.  I just wanted something simple to eat and comfortable environment to relax and what I got was some edible food and a not so comfortable environment.  But not bad either.  I might go back since this is one of the least foo foo restaurants in the area and I live in the area, but it's certainly not a destination point for me."}
{"text":"I love the patio and the only reason I would go back is because of the patio. They have wing nights on Monday and other daily specials. The food is very mediocre. Nothing to be WOW about."}
{"text":"Took a long time to get initial service to the table but our waitress Megan was very sweet and all of the items we ordered came fast fresh and delicious! We shared the \"social platter\" for an appetizer and it was both generous and filling. Our drinks were cold and we had a great time on the patio overall!"}
{"text":"Gabby's = great chain restaurant. They're consistent without sacrificing too much character, and they have plenty of beers. So I'm on board. If you enjoy large and festive outdoor patios, extremely friendly and attentive service, boatloads of television, and decent food in a cool neighborhood, then this location is right up your alley."}
{"text":"Great for an out-of-normal-hours meal. I just avoid during game days because I'm not a fan, but if that suits you, go at any time."}
{"text":"OUT OF TOWN GUEST SHLULD AVOID  After being IDed at the door I was again carded at the bar and was not served because I did not have a passport. I do not even have a passport because I crossed the boarder with an enhanced license. Who asks for a passport at a bar, anyway? The server was rude--there are so many better places downtown."}
{"text":"Worst service, slow and rude, terrible food. They have the audacity to charge you extra when you want more condiments to try to salvage your meal. Do yourself a favour and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Had the chicken wings. I could have made better at home.   Other than the crappy food, the waiter was giving us some attitude and they put us right next to smokers on the patio.   Shame because it is a nice patio."}
{"text":"Stopped in here last week with a friend and experienced long wait times and very poor service. It's one of those places where you get the impression that the wait staff is busier than they are even though the restaurant is only half full.  Food and drink menu is nothing special (we ordered fish tacos, which are supposed to be crunchy, but were too soft) The fries that came with it were pretty bland (I have had had frozen fries from the freezer section at Sobeys that were much better) and the service here was TERRIBLE. I don't know how this place can stay in business. There are so many better dining options in this hood, avoid it!"}
{"text":"This was the only place that wasn't packed before the Jays game and they could accommodate 10 of us.   We were out on their patio to start and they were able to fit us inside once it started to rain.   The food was pretty good. My poutine was excellent and my fiancé's Buffalo chicken wrap was delicious. Someone else in our group ordered the beer cheese dip and it looked AMAZING. And you could eat the bowl.   The waitress was lovely and was very attentive.   FYI they don't take debit. Just credit and cash."}
{"text":"Great outdoor area, strangely crowded for a Monday afternoon....  Food was fine. Pulled pork sliders with onion rings. My companion had roast beef sandwich which she said was good. Wish it was warmer and that we weren't working so we couldve joined in on the pitchers of beer!  Food was fine and the vibe was cool.  I'd go back."}
{"text":"Excellent service although a tad slow! We had a super nice waitress named Emily, from Ireland. We started with drinks, a Chardonnay for me, which was a super small portion, and a jack and coke for daniel which he said could have been a little stronger. We then got an order of medium wings. The wings had a great flavor, almost a sweet tang, but they were so tiny! For dinner, daniel got the Tuscan chicken, sans bruschetta, which he really enjoyed but thought there was too much feta cheese on it. I ordered the bruschetta from the appetizer menu for my main course. I didn't know there were red onions in it because it wasn't listed on the menu but they were so small I could barely taste them and overall the dish was delicious. The ladies room was cute and decorated nicely but definitely could be kept cleaner, however, I did love the ambiance on the patio."}
{"text":"Only spent 15 minutes there.  I was seated on the front patio by the greeter at about 4:30 PM on a week day. I had about 25 minutes before meeting family for a dinner down the street. 15 minutes or slightly longer I left having ordered a beer that never arrived..."}
{"text":"Two very different experiences in the same weekend. I was in Toronto with one of my girlfriends and we stumbled into Gabby's on Friday night. Our IDs were checked at the front and then we were escorted to the patio. Pretty normal experience overall, and our server was very friendly!   On Sunday evening we had tickets to the Second City Comedy show. We wanted to grab a quick beer before the show and ran into Gabby's because we knew they were nearby. We sat down at the bar and gave the bartender our Michigan licenses, the same forms of ID we showed on Friday night. The bartender said she is not allowed to accept out licenses and that we would need to show our passports. We didn't have them on us because we never thought this would be an issue. We told her that we were in just Friday night and were served no problem. She called the manager down to have him talk to us.   \"You guys the Michigan's?\" he said...as if it were a crime! As we were explaining our Friday night experience, he barely made eye contact with us. He was just staring at our licenses, trying to examine if they were authentic. We said, \"You know what, this isn't worth it....we're 22 and the drinking age is 19 here. We have been here for 10 minutes and I think we're just going to leave.\"   \"Alright then, see ya\", said the manager. He was disrespectful and frankly, quite the asshole! He was the only Canadian that we met over the weekend that was unkind to us.   One star for being average in the first place, and for the manager/owner/who gives a crap not giving a f*** about our experience."}
{"text":"Mediocre bar food priced way too high.  There is so much competition in the area (all better choices) so I'm surprised they haven't improved their food quality or lowered their prices.  Came here for dinner before a Mirvish show. We were on a time constraint and the server was pretty good about it. Made sure we got our bill in time to leave. It was also pretty dead inside so a better option if you are rushed before a show as the other restos in the area tend to usually be quite busy.  The nachos were horrendous. The wings were good but way over priced (2 pounds, no fries, no drink, came to $27 after tax and tip), and the fish and chips was alright, but fish was slightly burnt and chips a bit limp and cold.  Overall ok if you are in a rush or just want a beer. But don't come here expecting a good meal."}
{"text":"Great patio in the summer, food is just okay.  The waitresses are a little dumb and hardly ever come by to check your table.  Typical pub, but the main selling point is this place's patio.  I wouldn't come here for any other reason."}
{"text":"Over priced, and weird staff.  A tourist trap for us, but looked like locals in there too.  Service is lame.  We had a 12 month old baby and ordered a kids slider just the burger well the lady said we had to order the whole hamburger we said fine, so they bring out a whole hamburger and fries for him, charge us the $10.50, not the $6.00 kids price, when we questioned it the waitress and manager had an attitude.    Lose the tude dude.  You messed it up.  The burgers are nothing special.  Beers are $6-8.  Yeah, they are.  Our meal for four plus baby came to $120.  For 4 burgers and that baby burger.  Yes I just said all that.  I could have gotten this burger at TGI Fridays and it would have been $5 cheaper.  Yeah, not a fan."}
{"text":"Excellent bar service. Was able to catch the Yankees games both nights we stayed in Toronto. The wings and fries were great. Staff was nice"}
{"text":"Food 4/5 - ordinary food. Nothing specials. As everywhere  Service 4/5 - friendly and good trained.   Price 3/5 - $110 for 4 ppl with drinks.   Will NOT be back."}
{"text":"Michelle was excellent at the bar she's also the new manager got an issue talk to her. I know the reviews are mediocre but this is your busy king west bar that serves food till 1am everyday. They screen all the major games and ufc fights. My drink was never empty my server was on the ball. Been here before would go again. Ask for pretty boy Shane he's cool."}
{"text":"This place is perfect if you are looking to watch a sports game and drink a beer. They have a patio as well as a bar and lots of booths. I have come here a few times, twice to eat, a few times just to drink and once for take-out. When I have come just for drinks, it is great. The bartenders are attentive, polite, and quick.   When I have come here for food however, I am less than pleased. I guess I shouldn't expect much from a chain bar. I ordered a salad the first time I came. It was a greek salad and was actually pretty good. That time I was perfectly fine with the food. The next time that I came, I ordered some poutine. We ordered the bbq one. It was pretty gross honestly. The gravy was very thin and watery. The bbq was good, but the cheese curds were just squishy and not very appetizing.   When I got take out, I again ordered the salad that I got the first time. It was disgusting this time. I assume it had some sort of preservative on it but it tasted strongly of lemon. It was not good at all and made me sick after I ate it. I have no idea what they put on it, but I have never had a salad that tasted like that and hope to never have one like that again.  The only reason that this place got the two stars it did is because it is a good spot to watch a game and drink a beer."}
{"text":"Awesome spot on Kings st. First time I came was for a late night drink and bite. They don't close till late so it made it convenient that it was so close to the hotel. My Bonecrusher IPA was delicious as expected. My only qualm was with the wings. I got them Cajun style but they seemed over cooked and lifeless. Maybe my expectation was different from what it actually was. Not really a big deal for me, I will just order something else next time. I'd recommend it."}
{"text":"Well let me start. Such an amazing time!! They give the biggest beers on king street. 20 ounces versus 16!  They have a great staff. Everyone was so nice and they really made our night...  The food was so good. Agh can't say enough!"}
