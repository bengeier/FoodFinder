{"text":"Havana ohnana, half of my heart is in El Pequeño oh nana..  Like my jingle? Maybe not I will stick to reviewing.  Within it's first two weeks of opening I was so happy to wander off and discover El Pequeño on a Friday afterwork deal. When Eater mentioned this was a small Havana styled bar that seats 9 ppl - the Polly pocket loving child in me had to check this place out.   I patiently waited as they opened up at 7 pm. The best surprise was that Coldroom and Bevo are neighbours to this cute little bar. (Contain excitement). El Pequeño is actually a sister site of Coldroom! (Insert mind explosion sound effect).  Walking in-the decor is a very classic, large windows, green plants and literally 2 seats at the bar. There are side and center tables for standing which is where I mozied my way through. It reminded me of an adult lemonade stand setup -added bourbon and hard liquors. Fear not! There is a 30 seater terrace being setup in two weeks -Yay!!!  Peter was great at explaining the menu- a simple one. Currently they have 4 drinks: Daquiri, rum & Coke, mojito, and El presidente (12-15$ range). I went with the daquiri (4/5) it was great & strong-made with white and cane sugar, lime juice and and Bacardi Superior. Peter mentioned that they will soon introduce rum flights!! Can't wait.  The fact there was only one food item only supports my analogy of a lemonade stand (not 10 cents but worth every cent of the 11$): enter Cubano sandwich. (5/5) if Schwartz were to have a sandwich baby -this would be it. I could hear the butter sizzle on the grill turning brown and spreading beautiful aromas in the small bar. The Cubano was served in an old deli styled wrapping. The sandwich is a combination of meat, mustard, thinly sliced pickles, mozzarella cheese on warmly served paninified bread. So good  on an empty stomach! Good to share for 2.  I am so happy to have tried this place! I kept this date short and sweet so the rich scent of brown butter can bring me back here to this exotic little find."}
{"text":"Walking around Old Montreal I saw this cute little bar that I had to try.  Apparently it's the smallest bar in North America, according to the bartender.  There are 3 seats at the bar, and one small round stand up table.  And that's it!  The decor is kinda classy and laid back cool at the same time.  They do offer food - but only a Cuban sandwich:)  The drinks menu is limited but hits the spot - daiquiris, mojitos, rum/coke and 1-2 other drinks.  I tried the mojito and it was lovely - the muddled fresh mint really stood out.    The bartender is really friendly and definitely a people person.  He can regale you with tales of how he started in the business.   He even gave us a great tip about a secret bar close by!  Definitely a great spot to grab a drink!"}
