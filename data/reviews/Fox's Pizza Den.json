{"text":"Wow we are visiting relatives in town. What a delicious tasting pizza. Sauce has a slight kick to us it was the best pizza we've had.  Thanks will be back when we are visiting again. Damn can you open a store in Anchorage?"}
{"text":"***update*** I just recieved a call at 8:00 saying that my order has been sitting on the top of their pizza oven. NEVER AGAIN. 


while I understand that its a Friday night and it's a busy time for delivery... please dont tell me that it will be 40 min for delivery when it won't be.  I ordered at 615 and it is now 7:50 and nothing has been delivered.  I called at 7:28 to find out if it is out for delivery and still nothing.  If I was told it would have been a long delivery time,  I wouldn't have placed the order and just ordered from the place down the street that I can walk to and pick up. I will continue to order from here because their food is decent and there's not many options up here,  but opt out of delivery service"}
{"text":"Fox's pizza in McKees Rocks I would rate it a zero food is nasty and disgusting and my pizza was delivered to me cold and it does not taste authentic and over priced"}
{"text":"I like their sauce.  The pizza is not greasy. Everyday they have a special offer, so prices are reasonable.  The place is always clean. The staff is always professional and friendly. They messed up my order, but they were polite and fixed it right away."}
{"text":"Sauce is a little sweet, but overall the service is great! Can you guys please stay open for until 10PM during the week?"}
{"text":"Since moving to Ambridge, this is our go-to pizza place. Great pizza, great prices. Love their appetizers, too!"}
{"text":"We've had Fox's several times and it is, usually, the best pizza I've ever had.

However, our recent experience on Friday, April 21st, was disappointing.

We ordered two pizzas, 1) pepperoni and mushroom; 2) plain cheese. The pepperoni was underdone leaving the crust a little doughy, despite the request for well baked. Also, we found chocolate in our pepperoni pizza. I'm not sure how/why chocolate would be near or around a pepperoni pizza but a little disgusting.

Fox's has the best sauce and best pepperoni I've ever tasted and I know they can do better than our experience Friday. I would still highly recommend Fox's to anyone, knowing this experience was not the norm, but still disappointed."}
{"text":"We decided to try Fox's tonight for dinner.  What a disappointment.  My wife and I took our three kids there for dinner because the kids wanted pizza.  For appetizers we ordered mozarella sticks and their mac & cheese bites.  The moz sticks were over-cooked and about half of them had no cheese in them because it had oozed out while cooking.  The mac & cheese bites were very greasy and tasted like they had been cooked in old oil.  I ordered three chocolate milks for my kids (aged 9 through 11), and the waitress came back and said the chocolate milk was frozen (as was the white milk), and told us what other options they had.

We ordered two pizzas:  a cheese pizza for the kids and their gourmet veggie pizza for my wife and I.  About the time I would have expected the pizzas to come out the waitress came to the table and said the order had somehow gotten lost and they were making them right now and would have them out ASAP.  While we were disappointed and the kids were getting antsy, we said ok and waited a bit more.  About 10 minutes later the cheese pizza came out, and the waitress said the veggie would be just a minute.   About the time the kids had each finished their first slice of pizza we could hear the waitress talking with the kitchen and she was saying something about a veggie pizza.  Since there weren't very many folks in the place, we suspected our pizza had not been made (we were correct).  

Almost 10 minutes passed and our kids were now done with their second piece (which meant they were done with their dinner).  Still no veggie pizza.  My wife called the waitress over and asked what was up with our pizza.  She apologized profusely and said she wasn't sure why they didn't come up at the same time, and said it was coming right out.  We pointed out that our kids were now done with their dinner and likely wouldn't want to sit around watching us eat.  At that point we said if it's done box it up and we'll take it to go, otherwise bring the check.  A couple minutes later the waitress arrived with the boxed veggie pizza and the check.  They had taken off the charge for the kid's pizza and only charged us half price for ours.  While this was a nice gesture, this place definitely has some service issues they need to work out. 

The pizza itself was ok, but there wasn't really anything that made it stand out from any other pizza.  The crust was just a tad undercooked in a few spots, likely because of them taking it out too soon after forgetting to make it twice in a row.  We'll be taking this place off of our list of options."}
{"text":"Been getting pizzas and subs from these guys for over 10 years!! Great your deal with!! From superfast deliveries to fresh,hot good pizza,I highly recommend !!"}
{"text":"We are huge Fox's Pizza fans and were happy to see there was finally a location in Cleveland. Without hesitation we decided to go there for dinner tonight, Monday, July 27. We called ahead to make sure they were open before making the trip from the East side, and although we got an answering machine, decided it was must be because they were extremely busy during the dinner hour, as their website said OPEN NOW. So we drove through rush hour, sat in traffic due to an accident, and were delayed further at the exit due to road construction. When we arrived, parked and got to the door the sign said WE ARE CLOSED. WHAT the WHAT??? Just checked their website again and it clearly states open Sun-Thu 11:00-9:00 - NOT. 
I had to click one star to save my review, but in actuality I rate it NO STARS for NO CHANCE to judge the food and INCORRECT INFO on their website. Not even sure they are still open for business since the message on the answering machine is generic. Bummer."}
{"text":"Great wedgies,never dissatisfied.  Yhey have a clean place,no where to really eat for friends and bar next yo it a dive. But Fox's pizza good as well. Turle Creek has alit of pizza joints but this place has the best wedgies and subs 4.5 only rated a bit higher as they havent burned my food. They could put a bit more meatvon subs,all and all delicious,always love their sslads they are well worth it and not scrimpy on toppings. I just made myself hungry again!"}
{"text":"Ordered a chicken salad, Stromboli deluxe, & steak hoagie all of which were excellent & seemed to arrive in no more then 20 mins of ordering. Thank you"}
{"text":"I stopped by this place looking for something quick to eat. I see this place everyday on my to work. I had a Taco Wedgie and in a word: yuuuum!!!  

Give this place a try. You will not regret it!"}
{"text":"This is a great local pizza shop in Waxhaw that my wife and I love. The owners are very friendly and the pizza is amazing! Fox's has also catered some businesses events as well and everyone was highly satisfied with the food."}
{"text":"Nice family owned restaurant great service but ok pizza. It was very thin when you picked up the pizza it would fall down and be at my wrist. The pizza was not cut well and hard to tear. Their cinnamon sticks were warm and a little chewy."}
{"text":"Holy slow pizza. If you have an hour to spare waiting for pizza then come here. If you're hungry go elsewhere. It's ridiculously slow. The people ordering in front of me got their food, ate... and had been gone for 10 mins before I even got my pizza"}
{"text":"I have probably had everything on the menu at this point and have not been disappointed in any way whatsoever. I'm usually the kind of person to get delivery but I often find myself changing it up for this Fox's in particular and going down and hanging out for awhile. The TV screens to watch many sporting events along with the atmosphere provided by the management team and staff is top notch. They are the best people on the boulevard.

Now for the goods about the food. My top choices are the wings whether boneless or bone in. Lots of meat and sauced with just the right amount. All varieties are incredible, trust me.
But let's be honest you go to a pizza shop for what? PIZZA! The pizza is not heavy on the sauce always cooked with the famous cheese blend just melted the right amount, they can't seem to make a bad pizza. I love how they venture out and have even made \"The Big One\" which is bigger than their Big Daddy, never knew a pizza could be so big and still great quality but somehow they do it great every time. 

If I could rate them on a scale of 1-5, they would be rated a 10! The food, the atmosphere, and the people are what makes me LOVE this pizza more than any. Great Job Fox's Brookline!!!!"}
{"text":"Employees rude and disrespectful, employees park in handicap parking spots and block access ramp to sidewalk for wheelchairs. Skimp on toppings. Monroeville location great."}
{"text":"My kids absolutely LOVE their cheese breadsticks. The pizza is really good. Wish they could find a better location though. In the meantime, delivery service is fast in Waxhaw."}
{"text":"We just moved to Mesa and received one of those door hanger thingy's advertising this place.. 

We ordered the philly cheese steak pizza and it was amaaaaaazing!
It was delivered to us on time, and was really reasonably priced.
We can't wait to order from them again (and try a different pizza each time)"}
{"text":"This place has always been one of my go-tos for a good cheese steak sandwich, the biggest and best in waxhaw in my opinion! Worked here briefly in high school so I can tell you, the family that owns it work hard to provide quality food with good service. Great people, great service, great food, check it out"}
{"text":"Best white pizza around .......we get bigdaddy all the time for the hockey games never any problems. .....lots of pizza places in penn township .......but the service in them is horrible one around the corner were dad screams at his own kid in front of customers....."}
{"text":"Pizza was just ok.  Sauce is too tangy for my liking.   Mozzarella sticks and mac bites were good.  Service was great!"}
{"text":"Nothing to write home about. Last time we ordered our food was terrible. Seems like the quality is going down hill. I love to support waxhaw businesses but I don't think I'll be ordering again. Only good thing they have going is it's one of the only delivery places in the area."}
{"text":"Wow, this food is TERRIBLE. I got delivery on a Tuesday night, and it came in less than a half hour and the drive is 15 minutes- so I know they're not swamped or busy.
 Everything I got is burnt and inedible.
 But even if it weren't, the portions are SO SKIMPY that I can't even salvage a meal out of it. An order of friend zucchini has 2 1/2 pieces.  
 A paper thin  tiny portion of meat, 2 HALF slices of tomato- really cheap crap.
 And they have the nerve to charge a dollar for delivery- of course i have to give the driver a decent tip- it's not his fault.
 When I asked for my sauce on the side instead of on the gyro, he charged 50 cents because, you know- tiny plastic containers cost money.
  What a ripoff. For 12 1/2 bucks I should at least be able to be sort of full."}
{"text":"Best subs in town! I love their subs! Maybe its the bread but its better than any other place around here. 
But if I could make a slight suggestion? Be a little more generous with the lettuce, tomato and onion toppings. This way you can make a perfect sub even better!"}
{"text":"Great little pizza shop in Mt. Washington. They have good carry out deals and the pizza is better than most. They do a traditional crust"}
{"text":"Fox's has the best wings in town, delicious pizza, and literally the best ham and cheese sub I've had in ages.

The wings are breaded and baked.  The pizza is very tasty and the cheese is mouthwatering.  The ham and cheese sub is baked as well with an almost sweet mayonnaise and great veggies on top.

Did I eat there two days in a row?  Yes, yes I did."}
{"text":"Time online says open until 10:00 pm.
I show up at 9:25 to the Kittanning store and I'm told they are closed. They could have told me that on the phone if they didn't take it off the hook so thar customers couldbt order food and interrupt their closing down early 

Other people who work late count on a place to be open during the hours posted 
This is ridiculous high school unprofessional garbage. A waste of my time, effort and fuel to visit a location who wont serve customers 35 min before closing. 

I did order here 4-5 times a month AT LEAST.

NO MORE.
THEY LOST A CUSTOMER.

THANKS"}
{"text":"My family orders takeout weekly. Fox's is the only place in Monroeville that delivers that gets our order right every single time, and is always delivered timely. You can't ask for much more from a pizza place."}

{"text":"Ordered lunch for business meeting! Great service!  On time and quick. Ranch was awesome!"}
{"text":"My husband and I both liked the food. very reasonably priced. We each got two pieces and a drink fir $9 total. I liked the fact the toppings were actually baked into the pizza instead of just being thrown on top of a cheese pizza that's been sitting out for a while like some pizza places do. We'll be coming here again."}
{"text":"In 2013 comedy music duo Ylvis asked the question \"what does the fox say\".  I'm still not sure, but if it's the same fox from Fox's Pizza Den I'd imagine he says \"eat my food cause it's good as f*ck\"!  

This is a fairly new location and I'm glad I can leave a review (the first review at that), hopefully driving more business and keeping them around for awhile.  This location was my first adventure into Fox's pizza and they are a great representation of the company.  

I've had the standard round pizza and it's awesome but my favorite is the Big Daddy.  21 square cuts but not sicilian style, still standard crust!  It's amazing and at $18.99 standard price it's a hell of a deal.  You can also get the carry out/ Sunday special and it's $13.99, I don't know anywhere around me other than them giving that much quality pizza for that price including 1 topping!  Also they aren't stingy with the toppings.  Nothing is soggy or half assed and I think that's due to the nice staff who in the 5 times I've ordered, always made it a point to make things right.  This location is also impressively clean, you could eat right off the floor.

I also had the hoagie and wedgies from here and they are made with the same love and care that the pizza is made with.  I've had a lot of pizza from a lot of places from mom and pops to corporate and Fox's is an impressive balance of both of those concepts.  The love and care of small company with the consistency and unique branding of chains.  

What does the Fox say?  I'll tell you what I say, \"give me another slice\"."}
{"text":"Employees are extremely rude.  We live in the Blackridge neighborhood, an upscale area along Graham Blvd  where homes range from $120k to $760k we were told that our neighborhood is not nice enough to go to at 7:30 in the evening for delivery.  I was told this while trying to order pizza for our neighborhood garden club that was meeting at our home.   I have never been so insulted in my life!!!

Our neighborhood was nice enough to host a home and garden tour each year and it is also nice enough for young families to raise their children here!!!

We live on a beautiful tree lines street in a very nice area, far nicer than the area that the Fox Pizza shop in located in and they told us that our neighborhood was not ice enough or safe enough to deliver to???  I was completely floored!!! 

Blackridge is by far the nicest neighborhood in the city of Penn Hills! This kid has no idea what the heck he is talking about!!! 

I'm also posting this on our community Facebook page and also Nextdoor community page!!!!"}
{"text":"Omg...the stromboli is amazing, you're defenitly taking some home. 
Service is great. This is a must try"}
{"text":"We love this family owned pizza place! The staff is very polite and friendly and the food is fresh. They even make their own ice cream! Pizza AND ice cream? Heaven. 
 It's a casual, everyday-looking family owned place with not the greatest of parking but, still so well worth it once you have a taste! 
I recently tried their garlic/parm wings, which were unusually great, so if you like variety, give these folks a try! Can't go wrong with anything. Next time I'm trying the Stromboli. 
 They are all about the food and service, which is exactly what I love about them. The dining area is kinda small but they do deliver!
 Don't get me started on that homemade, delicious ice cream, with flavors like banana pudding, chocolate almond coconut and key lime!"}
{"text":"I have tried a lot of Pizza places in my life. and other then the pizza that I get from where I grew up. This pizza is by far the best I have had since then.

If you haven't had them yet, I strongly suggest you do.

You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Don't bother calling these jokers, they'll just tell you to call a different location even if you are only 2 miles away from them. Very frustrating experience as all the different locations seem to have completely different coupons. Do yourself a favor and avoid them."}
{"text":"Stopped in while waiting for my oil to be changed. I was greeted immediately with a friendly smile. My husband order a buffalo chicken hoagie, I ordered a steak hoagie with lettuce and mayo only, and we ordered macaroni and cheese bites to share. 

They said it would be ready in 5-10 minutes. It was closer to 15 but that was no big deal at all.

My husband enjoyed his hoagie with the only complaint being that it was a little messy to handle. Mine was great with the only complaint being that I couldn't eat it all- it was delicious and I wanted to but I was full. The mac n cheese bites were probably frozen but we still enjoyed them as they were perfectly cheesy!

On a downside, there was nowhere to sit and eat. We had a makeshift picnic in the side of the building. A picnic table or even a bench would have been perfect."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite pizza thats available during the day! Also, I love their steak wedgies!"}
{"text":"Was excited to learn that Fox's Pizza was behind GetGo having gotten their pizza many years ago before GetGo was built.  Ordered 1 Sicilian w/ pepperoni and was sooooooooo disappointed -- very thin, almost like a frozen pizza, and much too expensive for what it is. ($17.00)  Pizza was very light -- not at all like a Sicilian should be.   Counter girls were very nice and the wait wasn't at all bad.  Too bad -- we're looking for an exceptional pizza and this wasn't it!"}
{"text":"Mediocre food. Employees aren't very sanitary. Plenty of better pizza shops in the area."}
{"text":"We decided to order pizza from the Fox's Den last night. We ordered a plain cheese Big Daddy size since at $16.99 it was only $3 more than the 16\" extra large. We also ordered a garden salad & a ceaser salad. I think the total came to around $24.

I have to say the pizza wasn't as good as I remembered (it's been a few years since I had their pizza.)

The tomato sauce was pretty bland & there wasn't a lot of cheese. I think it really needs some flavorful toppings.  Also, we got the hand tossed and the crust was a little doughy.

I didn't care for the large rectangle that is the Big Daddy size. It reminded me of Little Ceasers or something frozen. Next time we will stick with the 16\" to see if that is a better choice. ( And we'll get toppings to give it more flavor.)

One positive I can say about this pizza - it was not at all greasy like some of the other nearby options. So, for that reason we would eat their pizza again, but it would not be our first choice."}
{"text":"Love this little local pizza spot. The staff is super friendly and the food is good! I would totally recommend Fox's Pizza Den if you are going to be in the Waxhaw area."}
{"text":"The pizza here is horrible.  The service is very good though.  The employees are very nice. But please put some money into your ingredients.  This isn't even made with real cheese.  Come on!!! I spent $20 getting a large pizza delivered and it wasn't even fully cooked and the cheese and crust tasted synthetic.  It was like eating elementary school cafeteria pizza.  Wait.  That was better tasting.  Save yourself the drama , just order from mama lenas down the street , they taste good."}
{"text":"Below average pizza at best...The Hawaiian pizza had so much cheese I thought I was doing the melt challenge. Most likely won't return and would be surprised if this place lasts..."}
{"text":"When a business consistently offers good food and good service, it's a win-win for me!  They are one of the few (non-bar) places on the Mount that are open late at night too.

This place is also very convenient since it's close to home.  The guys that work here are thee greatest.  They actually smile when I walk in and really make me feel as though they truly appreciate by business.  Tonight, someone made the mistake of erasing my pick up order from their screen.  When I arrived they looked shocked but the person at the counter remembered me calling in and checked to see what happened.  He apologized profusely and offered 50% off.  Honestly, it wasn't a big deal because they are so nice and I really didn't mind waiting the extra few minutes to get my food.  I will admit, if they weren't courteous and were nonchalant about the whole thing, I probably would've been upset. 

Now to the food...

I've had their pizza and if you've ever tasted Fox's, then you know it's good.  For me, the sauce makes the pie and they have a very tasty sauce.  The wedgies and hoagies are all pretty tasty as well.  I prefer the Italian with no green peppers...you gotta try it!  If you live nearby, they also deliver orders a minimum of $10.  I also forget about this and just end up calling on my way home and picking up the order.  

Honestly, if you want some really good pizza, subs, etc., and fast...please give them a try.  They've been around for a while and if you try them, you'll soon understand why."}
{"text":"Cheap low quality pizza. Much better options at Boondas or Bellisarios. One step above Tombstone frozen pizza"}
{"text":"I love this pizza joint.  When I used to live in the area, my wife & I ordered from there a good 2 times if not 3 times a week.  No joke.  I love Taco pizza and they make a good taco pizza that you can get from a personal size up to an extra large.  I love their Wedgies.  It's basically a sandwich made out of a folded pizza crust.  My favorite Wedgie was the Steak with green peppers, onions, mushrooms and provolone cheese.  the sandwiches were good too.  Nice and toasted with cheese baked and oozing.  Awesome stuff.  I used to order the meatball and the turkey subs.  The rest of  their menu is good too and they have ice cold Hawaiian Punch in a 2 liter.  Score!  Once in a while we will go back just to eat dinner or lunch for old time's sake.  Please Fox's open up more restaurants (Tempe is a good start).  Then I wouldn't be ordering the national chain pizza joints as much and exclusively go back to Fox's."}

{"text":"I enjoy their pizza, hut I really enjoy their Ruben hoagies."}
{"text":"I have tried this place many times when I lived in McKee's rock. Not friendly people, food could be good one day and horrible the next. Pricey. So many other local places that beat here. Also, take forever to get an order to your house, not during rush hour."}
{"text":"The crust is great!!!! It seemed like it needed a little more salt. I usually get pepperoni, but got black olives and green peppers. I was a little offended when the guy who waited on me was getting all kissey touchy with his girlfriend behind the counter. There's a time, and a place for that. It made me feel very out of place. I was the only customer in there at the time. That is why I gave it 3  stars. I would come back again it is very clean place."}
{"text":"The cheese is as tasty as any I've had. Pretty damn impressive to start! The crust is thin and toasted properly to bring out the flavor. The toppings covered all but the last edge of the crust, love that they didn't go cheapo on it. All of the toppings were tasty and fresh, and after the awesome cheese comes a sauce that had the rich ripe tomato taste I get almost nowhere. 
We got garlic sticks, excellent with strong garlic and not too much salt. 
Service was friendly and the store was clean. 
I've eaten at many pizza places, and on the food alone this tops my list. The dining accommodations are strip-mall basic, so not a place to go for a night out dining. Take out or lunch in, fantastic!"}
{"text":"Best pizza I have had in a long time.  Michael one of the delivery boys is very polite. Great guy. Please open a store in Mint Hill please."}
{"text":"Stopped on a whim and we've been back for more only a few days later. Great pizza and very friendly staff. Went out of their way to make sure our visit was enjoyable and even ran out after us because they forgot to give us a menu and a handwritten thank you note with a coupon for free breadsticks. Plus they opened their doors to us 45 minutes early without batting an eye. Said they deliver much later than posted as well."}
{"text":"Being new to the area, I was super excited to see we had a fox's... it's our go to for quick and easy dinners"}
{"text":"If you like a shop n save pre-made crust with some cheap sauce and generic cheese then this is your place. I've had this several times due to location only but can't believe they are still in business. A actual pizza place could make a killing in West Deer, there's just nothing out here."}
{"text":"Fox's Pizza in Turtle Creek is a pick up or delivery pizza shop. The original crust pizza was nothing special, we did however really like the Italian Hoagies and will reorder them. I would try the hand tossed pizza the next time I order an Italian Hoagie. 

The person on the phone who took my order didn't seem interested in taking it at all. No personality or friendliness. The order was picked up by us and it was everything we asked for. They do not offer the online ordering, with the unfriendly staff,  I think it would be a good idea."}
{"text":"This is the BEST Fox's pizza around! The Fox's pizza in Monroeville is God AWFUL, but this one is AWESOME!  Quality food, and I've always received great service."}
{"text":"Definitely not a fan. I used to like this place when Tom owned it, but it's just not for me anymore. They've messed my order up repeatedly, and food has been cold when delivered. I personally recommend the Fox's pizza in Pitcairn. Their food is always on point.  I don't exactly want to deter people from ordering here, because everyone's experiences differ. It's just not my type of pizza joint."}
{"text":"I've been ordering from this store for a while.  Today I figured I'd give em another shot.  Their customer service was good.  The order took a while, but was within their estimated time so I don't mind so much.

However I will say that for the first time I felt let down by the food.  The Calzone was bigger than I expected (I wonder if they gave me a large rather than a medium, which would explain the cost being higher than anticipated) but it seemed all crust and salami.  I hardly noticed any other meats, the veggies were lighter than usual and the cheese was hardly noticeable.

I called them up to let them know and, regretfully, there was no member of management available which was disappointing.  I was promised a callback and we'll see what they have to say.  Not sure I want to order something different all things considered (to be honest, I'd be pleased with a partial refund or something).

Days later they never called me back.  I was disappointed.  The calzone was really bad, which is new to them, and despite the promise of a callback, it never happened.  I'd have forgiven them if a supervisor called me back like promised but alas....

Bad experience, missed chance to make it up...Will I go back?  Maybe but it may not be for a while."}
{"text":"I don't give a Fox what you think about this place. I like it. And it's named after me, so.

I've had my own pizza a couple of times from different locations but it always bothers me that when I fancy a slice of it I cannot get it because they don't serve slices. This one is my regular location because it's right next to Las Palmas (with the best Ribeye tacos) so I'm down here in Dormont a lot.

Nevertheless it's a pretty good standard of Pittsburgh pizza. But not as good as Fiore's and Aiello's."}
{"text":"Food is always consistently delicious. Friendly staff and fast delivery! Love how they always have great specials and coupons too."}
{"text":"I am a regular.  Their crust is crispy and chewy.  The sauce is just a tiny bit spicy.  Family of six, the Big Daddy Party Pack is a great deal!  The lunch specials are the most filling, tasty, cheap lunch around!  
Service is great! Very clean!  Never change!!!"}
{"text":"This has become my go-to pizza in Mt. Washington. I've only ever ordered the Sicilian but it's delicious! You always get a good amount of toppings, and the quality is very consistent.

They are also really good about delivering - they've always been on time, and the pizza is always fresh."}
{"text":"It was okay.  A large pepperoni pizza with two canned sodas cost me $10.  Not bad.  The sauce is cheap tasting but the other ingredients mostly covered that up.  Super greasy pizza.  Service was quick.  Place was dead.  Not sure if I would return only because I can get the same quality and price a little closer to home."}
{"text":"I stopped in at this restaurant for a quick lunch. I have never been here before, but knew it had been here for some time. I asked the male and female counter attendants about their slice pizza and was told $4.99 including drink. They told me the slice was 1/4 of an extra large pizza. I ordered a slice and drink. After about 10 minutes the slice was delivered to me. I instantly asked the server if this was the 1/4 of an extra large pizza. I was told yes. WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT. The slice was mostly outer edge crust that barely done. The rest was a very small triangle. The sauce was sweet tomato-e. The cheese topping was a mix of mozzarella and provolone. The cheese was of poor quality and sparse. There was paper thin pepperoni on top.  It was not worth $1.00 much less $3.99 (without drink). Employees did not seem to care. I will not return!"}
{"text":"Eh. We ordered a small taco pizza with taco sauce and sour cream on the side. They forgot the taco sauce and sour cream completely. We also got a medium pepperoni. Both pizzas taststed fine but they were nothing special. And for a small order like that, I'm disappointed that they'd forget something obvious like the sour cream and taco sauce that I specifically asked for. :-/"}
{"text":"Meh. Basic pizza. Nothing special in the sauce and our crust was undercooked. Hoped for so much more."}
{"text":"The homemade ice cream is exceptional!  And the smell of fresh waffle cones is tantalizing.   Pizza great too !  The have a huge pizza like 4 ft by 4 ft which will feed a crowd too."}
{"text":"This month I am changing up the diet a bit and not eating meat.  I recently got a call from this newly opened place offering some BOGO discounts.  Just one me, I don't tend to buy 2 of anything cooked.  However I had to drive by one day this week on my way back to the shop and decided to see what their veggie pizza was like.  It was pretty good, plenty of toppings.  Their pizzas are thin crust, which I prefer.  This is a turn key franchise.  Everything inside is bright and shiny new.  You can see the pizza oven and it is open on both ends and the pizza travels on a conveyor.  The folks waiting on me were pleasant.  My pizza was ready in about 12 minutes."}
{"text":"I went there tonight for dinner for my family and they ripped me off my change and the pizza was just okay and cost me 40$ . The girl at the counter shorted me 10$ in change and when I called them and told them they said I had to wait till they did there draw . Well they never called and I know for a fact I gave her 40$ because I left everything at home  except the 2  20  dollar bills  brought in my hand .  We will never ever go back again !!!"}
{"text":"longest delivery every

Tonight I ordered over the phone at 7:50pm, we we're told it would arrive by delivery within 40 minutes; we received a phone call at 8:55 the delivery kid could not find my apartment and continued to drive around for another 10-15 minutes. He handed me my food and began to walk away, I had to stop and remind him I had also ordered a 2L Pepsi, he replied with an, \"OH did you order that too?\" So he told me he had to come back this way and that he would return in a few minutes with my soda. I live no more than 2 minutes away.....he came back 20 minutes later with my Pepsi. It is now 9:30...about  1 1/2 hours later, my order is complete. The food had potential of being good, but it wasn't fresh enough to tell..."}
{"text":"I love their pizza here, maybe not my favorite but its the closest to decent out here in lovely Arizona for the price. It reminds my bf and I of round table pizza in California."}
{"text":"I ate at this pizza place almost two years ago after a Fourth of July parade in Waxhaw. I had cheese pizza and mint chocolate chip ice cream and fell in love. Unfortunately I don't like close by, but on the way back from a road trip today we stopped in on our way through town. I had the same meal, cheese pizza and mint chocolate chip ice cream. Same as I remember it! So so yummy, and still my favorite. Maybe one day I'll live a little closer and can make this a regular treat. Would recommend to anyone driving through. The employees are very nice too and they told us what the best price deals where."}
{"text":"We've been in our new home for almost seven months and on Fridays my family and I like to eat pizza, so we usually order from Fox's. Well, two weeks ago they delivered us the wrong pizza, and I was furious...there's nothing worse than having your tastebuds set for something specific and not getting what you want. I called Fox's to complain, and the guy who I spoke with was very apologetic and offered me a free pizza for my next order, which I was able to use the following weekend! I was pleased with their customer service, so my family and I will continue to order their pizza on Friday!"}
{"text":"Unlike Victoria A. I'm very happy about what I get from here.  Never had portion issues,quality issues. A late delivery once.     Victoria must have been looking in her man's pants to only find a little meat. 2 thin zucchini really. Your whole write up is BSC. Your mad,I get that. Food burnt...ok. one real fact into everything was garbage that's ridiculous. You probably didn't need to eat that stuff anyway"}
{"text":"Wow..how do these people get customers ..whoever started this construction around them did now want them to survive. But -- They do. We ordered Sandwiches last night before Bingo and we had some pretty good ones. We ordered the Wedgies ( which are made on Pizza Dough) and the regular Hoagies on Buns. They use good ingredients and the sandwiches were fresh. I feel bad for the customers trying to pull in and out of there. What a pain!! and Very dangerous too!"}
{"text":"K.. I don't get it.  I go there every now and then.  I have only had the pizza.  It is a step up from supermarket frozen pie.  I like it because I like frozen pizzas... but I think the ratings given are a bit misleading.  

It is \"cost effective\" and if I think this place might be amazing for stoners..  But if you are looking for high quality pizza this is not it.  I would however get it over the chain stuff."}
{"text":"I called in an order after a long day expecting it to be ready so I could go home with dinner. I ordered a bbq chicken pizza and cheesy breadsticks, when I arrived, I found a buffalo chicken pizza. I explained to the girl I ordered a bbq chicken not buffalo chicken pizza, I understand mistakes happen I would have taken the wrong pizza at a discounted price so I wouldn't have to wait, but that was not offered. When the manager or owner came out from the back there was no apology or explanation. I was given the correct order, with cold breadsticks in the end. The pizza is decent, however the service is not worth the trip."}
{"text":"Let's face it, Fox's is not the best pizza I've ever had. However, their prices on larger pizzas are the cheapest around. Big Daddys are great for company, when watching a game, or trying to feed the niece and nephews. They usually have decent specials, as well. The Harrison City area is not full of great restaurants, but they do have an abundance of pizza and delivery places. Since moving to the area last summer, we have tried out a few other places and Fox's is the quickest when it comes to delivery, by far."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza and staff I'd always find to be very friendly!!! They definitely don't go cheap on the cheese! Too bad they had to close down so quickly."}
{"text":"This is a good place for takeout pizza.  We have many crazy evenings with soccer practice for our 3 boys on 4 different teams so occasionally we order the \"Big Daddy\" from Fox's Pizza in Pitcairn.  This large square pizza is enough to feed 5 with a few pieces left over.  The quality of the pizza is pretty good.  Sometimes you can find a Fox Pizza coupon for a $9.99 Big Daddy with 1 topping which is an incredible value.  Pizza is always hot, good sauce and decent ingredients and a price that can't be beat.  I cannot comment on other menu items."}
{"text":"If you want something missing from your order this is the place. My fiancé and I regularly order from here, and the last two times they have forgot the garlic sauce we requested. Not to mention this time the pizza was cold and chewy. Usually, never an issue with this place, but lately it has been nothing but a disappointment."}
{"text":"My family used to order from Fox's when I was younger so I have a soft spot for their pizza. It reminds me of being living at home and not having responsibility. The taste brings back a certain nostalgia. Yes, it's only a pizza place but it's funny how certain things can take you back to certain times of your life. 

Now, moving on from the sap, Fox's in Mt. Washington is awesome! Everything from the pizza to hoagies is exceptional. What I love about their pizza is the dough. It's not overdone like some pizzerias insist on doing. It's doughy, soft and delicious! Pepperoni is my topping of choice as it's somewhat spicy and almost (but not quite) crunchy. Hoagies are good as well as I prefer the Italian. Another favorite of mine is their breadsticks. About twenty of them come attached in a \"loaf\" (see my photos for a visual) and are seasoned with a light but zesty sprinkle. 

Service is always great as well. Delivery time is always in their window and will take no longer than 45 minutes. 

I do suggest everyone take a look at some of their coupons that are available in newspapers, online and on the pizza boxes. They have great deals including the Big Meal Deal. For only $21, you'll get a large pizza, order of breadsticks, full hoagie and 2-liter of pop. Definitely a great deal. Even if you're not going to eat it all it's good to save for tomorrow's lunch!"}
{"text":"Called on Friday night at 10:15 PM- got an answering machine (?)"}
{"text":"I love this place and the people who own it and work here. They are kind, courteous and the food comes out hot and tasty! I highly recommend the steak hoagie - juice and flavorful!"}
{"text":"My son had a personal pan pizza, made there fresh on the spot. Not bad, not great. Ordered \"homemade\" toasted coconut chocolate ice cream to go. The coconut was not toasted, it was raw, gross. This joint is always empty, not much ambiance, always advertising that you should get a wedgie from them...perhaps that's a turn off to a great number of people."}
{"text":"Seriously average, middle of the road pizza. Don't go out of your way."}
{"text":"The food is not very good but there prices are very reasonable.  The pizza is just OK.  I also asked the gentleman at the counter if the wings were good and he advised me not to order them.  Which is why I added a second star, there staff is very friendly and I appreciated the honesty.  

I do enjoy the $3.50 for 2 slices and a soda if I am in a hurry during the lunch hour.  In general though the pizza isn't anything to write home about.  A quick search will find you much better pies right in the Mt. Washington area.  I wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"Update (10-19-2016)
The owner is now verbally harassing an autistic cashier because he felt he needed to personally attack someone for what they have heard by word of mouth, which obviously travels.

Let me ask you guys these:

Is it safe to work in a food place and not wash your hands after you handled money, using phones, smoke, folded boxes, clean ovens/prep areas, or did dishes?

Is it safe to pull pizza sauce from a cold temperature and leave it on a table to be room temperature until replaced?

Is it safe to not date food with an open/use by date?

Is it safe to pull meat from a freezer and leave it on a counter overnight in room temperature, not placing it in a fridge/cold storage?

Is it proper to disrespect coworkers by calling them names or cursing and complaining about customers in front of other customers that come in for their pick up orders?

Cause this happens on a nearly daily basis"}
{"text":"We ordered Fox's Pizza Den tonight and were blown away by the customer service and quality of the pizza. We ordered the Deluxe and BBQ chicken pizzas and had to stop ourselves from finishing them off to save room for ice cream. I tasted a little spoonful of the banana pudding ice cream and it was fabulous. 


We are kicking ourselves for waiting so long to try this place!! If anyone is looking for a good pizza joint that delivers, give them a try! Very impressed."}
{"text":"This was my FAVORITE place to eat in Louisiana!! I am very disappointed that this location closed. Hopefully it will come back someday, and if it does.... I will be there for sure!"}
{"text":"Food is good, prices are reasonable! Customer service is fairly good too, but I just called to order takeout at 930 on a Saturday night and the girl said they close at 9pm!! What pizza place closes at 9 on a Saturday?!"}
{"text":"To be honest the reviews made me hesitant to try this place, but I actually liked their pizza much better than the other local option down the road. The sauce is good, the crust is just ok.  It's not the best pizza I've ever had, but they delivered fairly fast and the flavor was good so it will probably become our go-to for delivery. The service was extremely friendly and they have coupons on their website which made it  reasonable in terms of price."}
{"text":"We have ordered from Fox's a few times. Service is good and orders have always right. The cheesy breadsticks are delicious. The pizza on our last order was cut uneven but that's not a big deal. Nice clean waiting/dining area."}
{"text":"This is a pretty decent pizza place. It's not my favorite in the area, but if you are close and want pizza it's a good place to go. The crust is particularly good here and the toppings always seem fresh. I have only had it delivered, but the delivery has always been prompt and the food hot."}
{"text":"Food is excellent, reasonably priced and delivery employees are very friendly!    I especially love the grilled chicken salad, boneless wings and taco pizza.  Italian hoagie is shy on meat as other reviewer mentioned."}
{"text":"I took my family of 3 to Fox's Pizza Den, and we loved the place!  Very nice, classy, laid back interior with both highback booths and tables, and a bar in the corner.  Good backround music too.  The staff is terrific, and the pizza and cheese breadsticks were very good!  Lots of fresh flavor and nice texture and crust.  Good prices too.  My only constructive criticism would be to throttle back a bit on the cheese breadstick garlic flavor, and to make the pizza and breadsticks just a little less greasy.  Nonetheless,  I give the cheese breadsticks a 9 out of 10, and the pizza an 8 out of 10.  The stromboli, however, needs a lot of work.  The cheese bits inside were not fully melted and the crust and overall taste was way off.  Their stromboli gets a 4 out of 10.  Also, it would be nice if you could get a cup of coffee here.  Come on guys... no coffee?!  Are you kidding?!  In any case, we will most definitely return here soon, since the kiddos love it here, and most of the food is good!

We also did a takeout order here, and they forgot to include the salad dressing, and they gave us breadsticks when we specifically ordered cheesy breadsticks (they charged us for the more expensive cheesy breadsticks as well).  But, i'll give them the benefit of the doubt since they are new.  Next time, i'll just have to check the order myself before leaving the restaurant."}
{"text":"Ordered from here this week and one of the pizza's was made wrong. Called them up and a new pizza was made for us and delivered immediately. Awesome customer service!! Very fresh toppings and tasting pizza!"}
{"text":"Save your time and money...the pizza and service used to be good and I keep trying to give chance after chance. They NEVER give the amount of toppings you pay for and the service is slow. I have complained, been promised it will get better, and then....nothing. I paid for extra mushrooms (again) and this time to be safe because we all wanted extra mushrooms and had guests we paid for TRIPLE MUSHROOM ($4.00 extra on a $16 pizza) 

I have 6 slices that have 1 mushroom on the slice

I've included the picture after the 45 minute wait for the pizza"}
{"text":"Here's the Fox business model:

1-Cease distribution of coupons for several months
2-Post flyer inside offering something closer to a reasonable price than a special deal
3-Deny customers the price on the window, saying \"Oh, that's only if you have a coupon\"

So I can confirm it's definitely not worth the prices they normally charge. Specialties cost as much as what you can get at a place like Barro's or Old Chicago...but not half as good. All that aside, I'll go to a place that actually charges the prices they advertise."}
{"text":"Fox's Pizza Den kept my friends and I alive when we were going to school in DuBois, PA...  100 or so years ago.

Then when I moved to Monroeville, I was glad to know that I was very near the original Fox's in Pitcairn.

And now our local Monroeville Fox's is UNDER NEW MANAGEMENT!  I stopped in last evening to see the little hub for myself and was happy to find a spotless establishment, now family owned with all hands on deck.

I picked up my previously ordered pie (sausage, bacon, pepperoni) and headed home where I enjoyed almost half of a perfectly assembled, crispy crusted, exactly as it should be...  Fox's Pizza!  

You know, there are a gazillion pizza's to choose from, so when your mood calls for a moderately sweet sauced, low grease version (seriously, you can put the box on the back seat of your car - no need to chuck it in the trunk) with a great crust and wall-to-wall toppings that is NOT a sloppy meal - this is the pie for THAT meal moment.

Coupons for the next visit - which I expect will be soon!  There is definitely something to be said for years of product quality and consistency and this new management team gets it right.

Why not 5 stars?  because I couldn't figure out how to get back into traffic.  They are in an odd traffic location.  Maybe with some practice, I'll get the hang of it... I'm sure that the delivery guy has a system!"}
{"text":"Came here just for the wedgie. Haven't had a whole lot of wedgies in the past, so I'm not sure I know what a \"great\" wedgie taste like, but it totally scatched my itch."}
{"text":"We eat here frequently and drive about 20 minutes to do so.  My husband loves the bacon cheeseburger pizza and the cheese sticks are my favorite!"}
{"text":"Not bad for a chain at all, this joint used to be stuck in a gas station down the road if you can believe it. 

We got the typical pizza, wings, hoagie combo.

The Italian hoagie was decent. Some would say they skimped on the meat, but I didn't mind too much. It was a fine hoagie. 

The wings had lots of meat on them and were flavorful. I got the Garlic Parm. 

Now for the pizza itself. It was a thin crust, but was thin without being floppy. It was very soft too, the cheese being creamy and melt-in-the-mouth good. 

No complaints here."}
{"text":"Not too long ago on a lazy weeknight, Kay and I ordered from this Fox's Pizza Den franchise simply 'cause...I hadn't reviewed them yet! 

You're all shaking your heads out there on the web. 

So was Kay. 

A local chain and fixture in the Pittsburgh area, I remember trying the pizza at their Brookline location a few years ago and coming away moderately impressed with it. This time, however, the pie -- A BBQ Chicken Pizza being the specimen in question -- had a sodden, puffy, overly salted Pizza Hut quality that somewhat rubbed my palate wrongly. Not that I can state that it was...

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THkGcjNKdoE

...but it was a floppy, nearly flavorless dud for the most part.  I barely tasted the chicken cubes, the ketchup-ish BBQ sauce, or the gaudy cheddar cheese. It came off as something one could expect to have at a Superbowl party thrown by Rachel Ray. 

However, the rest of the meal was errr...foxy...

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL-6HqtjG-I 

The Italian Wedgie, a sandwich I've been fascinated with since having one from Ardolino's way back in my youth. Utilizing a pizza crust in lieu of a roll, the wedgie was a marvel of taste and crisp texture, ham, hard salami, provolone, mozzarella,
 green peppers, onions, lettuce, tomato, and a slam of an Italian dressing all communing together under a shell of chewy dough. If only the base of that pizza tasted like the house that built this pseudo-submarine. It coulda been a 5 star affair...

Further exemplifying our promptly delivered dinner was the Meatball Hoagie, which was a soft, squishy, gooey, robust, ruby-red rib-sticker of a grinder. Making that clucker pie all the more tragic were the Apple Strudel dessert sticks wit their warm, sticky mouthfeel and glazed, sugary disposition. 

A pizza parlor does everything right but the pizza. Imagine that. Make a Fox's run in the near future or have 'em run to you...

{"text":"Came here on a whim. Turn out they have a Monday pick-up special. A large pizza for 6.99. For the price, I wasn't expecting anything great. I was completely surprised! The sauce was so tasty and they put just enough sauce and cheese. Everything was really balanced. Great pizza and a great deal!"}
{"text":"Always fast and courteous service. Great food at great prices. Delivery is always received hot and faster than expected."}
{"text":"I am a little finicky with pizza. I don't think Venezia's can be beat (for Arizona pizza).. Since bitches are crazy, and make you move out of the house you practically built for them... I no longer have a Venezia's near me. I moved to Chandler with eyes scouting for what could be my new pizza joint. Fox's Den caught them quickly. I ordered a large 2 topping pizza with 10 hot wings for pick up on a Wednesday. My order was 10 bucks! Now.. this is not the best pizza ever, but it kills your major pizza chain any day. I highly recommend trying these guys."}
{"text":"The Gyro hoagie was FANTASTIC!!!!!! Quick delivery, and people were very nice to deal with. Definitely going to order from here again."}
{"text":"I don't understand how this can even be categorized as pizza.  It's overpriced garbage... I really don't understand how any one can call this pizza and look themselves in the mirror and not feel like an absolute garbage person.  I've given it way too many attempts and it disappoints every time... even after a 14 mile hike where I ran out of snacks...if I was starving to death and was presented with either being exiled into the desert to search for food or free Fox's pizza for life, I would ask if I could take sunblock on my search."}
{"text":"The pizza was no better than Pizza Hut. The onion rings were good. The service on the other hand... We were seated, after waiting 10 minutes I got up to ask if we could have something to drink. Then we ordered and it took close to 40 minutes to get our food.  The server was apologetic, but it doesn't change how long we had to wait with a hungry toddler. I have no plans of coming back or recommending it to anyone!"}

{"text":"An ode to my neighborhood pizza place....

Dear Fox's Pizza Den:

You are two blocks away from my house, yet sometimes I am too lazy to come get your delectable food offerings.  You don't judge me.  You just bring your delicious treats right to my door.  

I love you for your regular pizza with my favorite doughy crust, real mushrooms and enough tomato sauce for all my saucy needs.  I also love you for your specialty white pizza.  I enjoy your white pizza for its mozzarella, tomato and spinach winning combination.  Sometimes I'll even throw in our friend chicken to add in some much needed protein.  But most of all (and surprisingly) I love you for your \"healthy\" option, the Taco Salad.  Fresh lettuce, tomato, onion, tortilla pieces, SOUR CREAM, taco flavored beef and salsa.  Who am I kidding, you're not healthy at all....but I love you anyway!  

You make me feel good inside and that's what's most important!  

Love Always,

Rachel"}
{"text":"I am from back east and consider myself quite a \"pizza snob\".  I am real picky about the types of crust, sauce, and cheese used in a pizza.

That being said... Fox's Pizza Den is one of the best pizza places that I have eaten at here in Phoenix!  What really separates them is their cheese, I'm not exactly sure what it is, but it's not just plain mozzarella or provolone... they use some sort of blend that makes a much better tasting piece of pizza (my guess is Romano).  Their crust is very soft, and from the few times that I have had it, very consistent.

Don't be thrown by their cheesy name, their pizza is pretty darn good."}
{"text":"I'm not a pizza purist or anything, but I have to say that this is probably the worst pizza I've ever had.

The crust was very soft and \"doughy\" and looked like it had been baked for just a minute or two. I wasn't gooey, but wasn't much better than that.  There simply weren't many toppings on it either for a $25 pizza.

Unfortunately  once was enough for me, we are crossing them off the list."}
{"text":"Easy ordering for delivery. Hot and on time. Pizza is tasty. Pepperoni roll is good too. They sell pepsi products. ;). We have also tried their spicy waffle fries. I like recommend them. The garlic and seasoned wings are a must."}
{"text":"We accidentally chose pickup on Grubhub instead of delivery and the guy called us being so rude. I understand I chose the wrong delivery method but I already paid for the pizza it shouldn't have been that big of a deal. After that I asked if they could just deliver it (it was their party box among other things so it wasn't just one regular pizza) and they said they had a 2 mile delivery radius and couldn't come all the way out to us. I looked it up on google maps it was 2.2 miles. Really??? So we met him at the 2 mile mark which was a restaurant off Cochran road. I asked the delivery driver if I could talk to the manager and he said he was the manager. It was just so ridiculous they couldn't drive the extra .2 miles after I offered to compensate them for gas. He said they had no other deliveries at the time and no pending orders so it shouldn't have been an issue but he accused me of jeopardizing his job and paying his rent ect. If it meant that much to them I would understand and accept the outcome but he was so incredibly rude and on a power trip. The box was awful. Clearly we will never order from them again."}
{"text":"After ordering almost every weekend, we had multiple bad experiences.  The pizza almost always arrived cold.  One time. The delivery guy, dropped our pizza which was half meat and half veggie.  We do this because my wife is vegetarian.  He failed to tell us he dropped it and left all the meat all over the pizza, with all ingredients and cheese on one side of the box.  We haven't ordered in probably six months."}
{"text":"We had delivery, not takeout. The food was delivered hot, which surprisingly isn't as common as it could be for delivered foods these days..
Gyro sub - too much sauce, not enough meat. Literally could NOT taste the meat.
Beef, bacon, cheddar hoagie - had an odd taste to it. 
Chicken tenders+fries - wanted to order cheese sauce for fries, honey mustard for tenders, could only order one add-on. went with cheese sauce, but didn't get it. The tenders themselves were very good, even without dipping. Fries were pretty good too.
Jalapeno poppers - not bad. generic tasting, but I've definitely had worse.
Italian sub - tasted good, like it was made with fresh ingredients. 
Wings - went with mild. Heavy breading (not a fan of that). Wings were nice size, not too small. Sauce was pretty good.
Chef salad - one of the best items in the whole lot. Fresh ingredients, decent size for the price. 
Chicken wrap - very good. Good size for the price. 
Meat Supreme pizza - tasted pretty good. Not the best pizza we've ever had, but definitely nothing wrong with it."}
