{"text":"We got two plates of the \"chef's choice\" and they were all terrible! Most of them sweet and had nothing to do with sushi. They dropped the ball. Worst sushi I have ever had!"}
{"text":"This place is really good! We got the chef's maki selection and the three rolls were amazing and only $22! The waitress was super friendly and the terrace outside was very nice. Not a 'trendy' noisy place, a nice small sushi place to go on a date on a Saturday night. Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"The sushis arent bad, flavour profile for the makis are nice but the rice isnt well cooked all the time. We went there three time. The first time was ok but the manager / owner went on about hernpersonal life and why shes was in a bad mood( first time we met her). The second time we did takeout and the wait was quite long, the manager/ owner passed a couple bad remarks about clients. Then today we went because it said that they were open 11-10 on yelp. We got there ate 15:30 the door was unlocked. We walked in and we abruptly got told that they were opening at 16. We said we wanted taked out  and got a rougher answer that they were opening at 4pm. Then the lady that told us off wich is the same than in the previous time told us she would take oiur order.  We saud no thank you and walked away to never go back there again.   Bad client service.... Not worth your money go spend it somewhere else since the sushis are on the expensive side too..."}
{"text":"Les sushis sont excellents! Ils sont différents des autres restaurants, et les serveurs savent ce quils servent! je ne suis jamais restée dîner sur place, mais leur service a emporter est très bon. Bonne continuation!"}
{"text":"The sushi offered here is a ok, but not worth going out of your way for. I would say that is somewhere slightly below average when compared to other sushi options in Montreal. However if you live nearby and are in need of a sushi fix and don't feel like traipsing across town Sushi Taxi is a good option. 

They offer a number of sushi selections that offer a nice variety if you are just one or two people and of course have an extensive à la carte menu. 

They also have an online ordering system that is pretty convenient. However, they recently did an upgrade and the functionality that told you when your order would be ready disappeared which was a bit annoying. The lady at the restaurant told me that they were working on fixing this."}
{"text":"YUMMY!!!!! That's all I seriously need to say.

I think this place has totally ruined every other sushi restaurant in the world for me, no word of a lie. I popped in here with a friend this past week for a quick lunch, and at first glance was a little frustrated with their limited menu. However, our waitress brought out the sushi plate of the month and explained that this month's theme was blueberry (meaning that blueberries were somehow tied into each roll). Every piece looked delicious, and so I decided to go for the special wondering how sushi could be transformed in that way.

Yum yum yum yum yum....every single piece was super delicious. Some were melt in your mouth amazing, and some had a super crazy fusion of flavors that made me rethink sushi all together. I love the creativity, love the concept, the high energy service, and the cool decor. I can't really speak for the other plates, but I am 100% going to be back and will bring everyone I know over because it's really a restaurant you should visit if you appreciate good sushi and are open to a little creativity!"}
{"text":"This place is starting to grow on me. I've ordered from this place quite a few times and eaten there as well on their terasse in the summer. When you order, the sushi arrives in these fancy black boxes. The chef likes to take chances and mix different fruits and sometimes nuts in with your sushi rolls. It takes some getting use to. They do a pretty nice imperial spring roll that really hits the spot. 

Lately I've been ordering the Vegelicious combo for myself. It's $18.50 but plenty for one person. Often at other restaurants when you order vegetarian sushi, it feels like an afterthought. Basically you're relying on avocado and cucumber rolls and if they do have a vegetarian futomakis... it's usually lacking inspiration.  However, at Sushi Taxi I feel they put a lot of effort and creativity into the vegetarian sushi. They use asparagus, mint, strawberries, avocado and all kinds of interesting sauces. It was actually hard to believe there was no fish. I eat fish but given the depletion of seafood in the oceans, sometimes I like to eat guilt free sushi. I've finally found a place that can make that happen. 

Still, if you like tuna... their Yamada is pretty great."}
{"text":"I was not a huge fan, we went around 8:30pm on Monday, and that's considered late so were not able to order of the regular menu. Their approach to sushi was creative but overall I was not that impressed quality for the price, there's definitely better. So this place deserves an OK review."}
{"text":"Les meilleures Sushis que j'ai manger de ma vie! Belle place mais asser petit pas beaucoup de place!"}
{"text":"Don't know where to start.  Service was very slow considering there was only 1 other table at the time.  Waitress was un-attentive and was preoccupied with the telephone at the cash.  Ordered multiple dishes and were not impressed.  Very bland Ramen soup that came warm instead of HOT.  Came with soggy general tao chicken which was mostly breading.  We ordered 3 different rolls that were probably some of the worst sushi I've had.  The rice was too sticky and strong in vinegar taste which overpowered the other ingredients (sushi shop is probably better.) Miso Soup was too salty and lacked any excitement.  I took 2 spoonful and left it alone.  We canceled the rest of our order and asked for the Bill.  The waitress was polite about it and asked if there was a reason we were cancelling our order?  We told her EXACTLY how we felt about the food and she simply said \"no problem\" Gave us our bill and walked away.  You are better off saving up more money and eating at Shinji next door.  Much more expensive, but worth every penny.  I ate there the following week and LOVED it.  As for Sushi Taxi, I would NOT recommend it.  You're better off eating at other fine sushi restaurants in Montreal.  Sho-Dan, RYU, Jun-i, Imadake & Park are some of my Favorites.  Hope this review helps."}
{"text":"Je crois que cet endroit est en train de devenir mon resto de sushis préféré! Déjà ma 3ème visite en deux mois. C'est comme une \"expérience\" sushis. Laissez-vous gâter par les choix du chef, ou les saveurs du mois. Chaque sushis a sa sauce ou son condiment spécial, par oignons frits... et ne pas oublier d'essayer les meilleures calmar frit en ville. 

Le service est en plus agréable. Seul remarque négative: c'est petit donc risque d'être complet assez vite, par contre on peut commander pour apporter et manger dans le taxi !!"}
{"text":"We stopped in quickly for lunch, 
They have a really nice patio, a little squished but really nice none the less. 
There's a lot of construction in the area so the tables needed a good wipe down and a lot of big trucks driving down the street made for pretty bad noise pollution, however that's outta their control. 

We order one of their lunch specials, we chose a 9 pieces with an entree choice of soup or egg roll or for one dollar more a spicy shrimp Thai soup. 
Everything is the chefs choice, you can give likes and dislikes however they chose what they give you. 

Both plates came out with doubles but we each got a different three piece, so we were able to swap and let me tell you, they were delicious. Not your average sushi! They have fruit in them, crab, shrimp and a bunch of other ingredients. Really good. 

The service was fine, nothing extraordinary but our waitress was sweet and attentive enough. 


Definitely recommend this place based off my one visit!"}
{"text":"The staff is fairly pleasant and the location is tidy, clean, and quiet. The quiet may not be by design though. The food is below average for Montreal sushi. Given that Montreal sushi is usually bad quality sushi to begin with - that's pretty awful. The only reason I'd come back is to furnish my daughter's occasional avocado roll cravings. Even then, ordering in might be the better option.

Side comment: my partner didn't rate the sushi is bad as I did. She said it was average for Montreal."}
