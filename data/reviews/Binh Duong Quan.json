{"text":"Waiting for very very long time, they have no patient for the customer. Will never come here again. Be awareness"}
{"text":"The foods here are good.  It's a small food stand in MeKung plaza.  It a good place to eat after a work day because food come out quick.  I hear their bun thit nuong is good but I couldn't try it because I was come late and they about to close.  The bun thit nuong is kinda long to make so they couldn't do.  They are nice because they still take you in around 8 o'clock.  They don't have a lot of choices on their menu but the quality is good.  Over all the food are good just don't be late when you want to try bun thit nuong and I will try to get there earlier to try it."}
{"text":"Vietnamese eatery housed in Mekong Plaza. Try the Hainanese Chicken Rice. It is not comparable to Singapore versions, but \"where there is no fish, shrimp will do (Teochew idiom).\" Other items purchased included a sugary sweet sugar cane drink, and spring rolls with shrimp and pork.   The food is okay, but it was hard to commit to it when there were so many tempting foods wafting our way."}
{"text":"Had the #7 dry noodles.  The place was busy and the noodles were clean for this tiny food court.  Would def return to quickly grab some noodles.   Most of the customers were Vietnamese which says  a lot."}
{"text":"If you are craving for authentic Vietnamese food, this will be a perfect place for you.  My recommendations: mi nam vang kho (dried egg noodles Cambudian style) Chao long (pork intestine and stomach congee). My friend would like it if the congee wasn't too thick. But i am fine with it Hu tieu xao ( stirred fry noodle with seafood) can be considered like hu tieu ap chao Banh canh ga ( chicken udon w blood cake) I am happy and satisfied with my orders today!!!"}
{"text":"My beau and I ate here this morning for breakfast. He ordered #18, rice porridge with chicken, #2 spring rolls and I ordered #8 chicken noodle soup. He said the spring rolls were very good, they looked pretty substantial ingredient-wise, filled with all the customary veg, shrimp and pork. The quality of the shredded chicken in both our soups was very good, his porridge was very tasty and the perfect consistency. I must admit I am a pho-snob, I have my favorite places and recommendations; Binh Duong Quan did not have pho but a delicious chicken soup which looked like pho and came with the standard side veg of mung beans, a leafy green and lemon. It was delicious! The broth was amazingly simple with hints of garlic and onion. The quantity of chicken to noodle was perfect. It was probably some of the best chicken soup I've ever had. And I never pass up a good soup. We also each ordered a drink, total bill $26.   They give you a tray of various sauces and spices of all degrees of spiciness. They also give you nice, thick paper napkins, not like the ones we normally get which resemble paper thin napkins you'd find in a doughnut store.   Normally we hit up the large dim sum restaurant next door but we decided to give this place a whirl since the food always looks so good on the plates of the people eating there. The owner came by to check on us and he was very nice, he explained the menu was a mix of Chinese and Vietnamese and the place is named from the city in Vietnam he is from. We will definitely be back with friends!   I did not give this place 5 stars as I try to reserve 5 starts for the ultra-ultimate fine dining experiences."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and I had the vermicelli noodles with shrimps on it, it was OK.  The noodles was very hard and wasn't easy to chew. Flavor, I would say not so much. You don't miss anything here, sorry."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I are most definitely fans of Vietnamese cuisine and have had a considerable amount of experience dining at several different restaurants in the Phoenix and Tucson areas. There are at least five Vietnamese restaurants at the Mekong Plaza and this is the second one we've tried. The experience we've had with the other eateries in the food court has been good thus far so we were optimistic.  We started by sharing an order of Goi Cuon (Summer Rolls, a.k.a. Fresh Springs Rolls) which was followed by an order of Mi Vit Tiem (egg noodle soup with braised duck).  As with many of you who enjoy dining out for Vietnamese cuisine, our initial guage for quality was the first order of fresh spring rolls, which, in this case were delightful. The consistency of the rice wrappers was perfect - not too sticky or chewy, which means they were freshly reconstituted and rolled. The slice of boiled pork was moist, tender, and flavorful, as was the shrimp and the veggies. All of the ingredients were neatly arranged and skillfully rolled in the wrapper, which made for a nice presentation. The dipping sauce was a little on the sweet side but still very yummy and satisfying.   Were we to base our review solely on the spring rolls we would easily award four stars for this meal. However, the egg noodle soup, although good, was noticeably less impressive. The consistency and flavor of the noodles and broth reminded us too much of instant noodle soup. My girlfriend thought the duck was a little dry and the dish consisted of relatively few ingredients.  I spoke with the owner who told me he took over this restaurant and changed the name just two months ago. Taking that into consideration, we'll likely give this restaurant another try after they've been in business a while longer.  Photo design by Billie Z."}
