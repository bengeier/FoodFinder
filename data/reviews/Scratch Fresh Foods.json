{"text":"Great place!  Food took a little while to arrive but the quantity and taste is well worth the wait. It is comparable to BOOM but healthier selection and cheaper prices. Only downside was the wait time. (It could be because we were a large group) but staff was very friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"I live in the area. This place has GREAT food! I wish I could have ordered the banana bread french toast, but we went early and the banana bread wasn't ready yet.
This is a great restaurant in the wrong location. I feel bad bc I think they would do really well in a different location."}
{"text":"The service was a tad slow..But the servings were massive! Fresh breakfast - pretty good. I didn't get too adventerous with mine stuck to the toast eggs and potatoes."}
{"text":"Maybe I don't need to get up too early in the morning to enjoy a good breakfast! 

Scratch Fresh Foods serves Eggs, Omelets, Pancakes all these good breakfast choices the whole day. All prepared with care and love from scratch, which definitely better than anything I can make at home.

Cinnamon Roll Pancake ($9.49)
- So light! So fluffy! So bouncy!
- Sprinkled with sugar on top and love the intense cinnamon flavour
- Lightly whipped butter cream so smooth giving the pancake a silky finish!

Chicken and The Egg - House made biscuit, fried buttermilk chicken, two slices of bacon, sausage gravy, fried egg and more gravy! Served with home fries and baked beans ($9.99)
- Fried Chicken was well seasoned with just a light kick of spiciness 
- The poached egg done perfectly and bacon just fried to the right crispness
- The only complaint might be is I need more fried chicken!

If you are not into breakfast dishes, there are also sandwiches, wraps and burgers to choose from.

Scratch Fresh Foods though a little out of the way, but well worth the trip just to enjoy well prepared home made food made from fresh ingredients. 

Service is friendly and laid back. Even the deco feels like home...

I just wish there is something like Scratch in my neighbourhood! I will be back!"}
