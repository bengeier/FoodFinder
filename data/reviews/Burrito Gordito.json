{"text":"I went here today and initially I wanted to order a halibut burrito and pork burrito, but the lady behind the counter said that there was no halibut available. So I ended up ordering a chicken burrito and pork burrito.  While we were waiting for the two burritos to crisp up on the stove top I asked her if they ran outta halibut or are they removing it from the menu. She said that they ran out of batter...I believe it was the owner that heard this and he said 'oh you want fish? I have the batter in the car! I will get it. Even though you already have the two burritos made up, the fish burrito is on the house!' How awesome?! Great customer service! I just ate the fish burrito and it was so amazingly tasty, melt in your mouth deliciousness! My hubby ate the pork burrito and he said it has a nice kick to it. No charge for the guacamole in the burritos..lots of other places will charge ya $2 for it. Much better than burrito bandidos. I agree with the other post, the ingredients are very fresh. Best burrito joint in the city hands down!!!! I will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Used to LOVE this place when it was Burrito Bandidios, though it recently changed management and re-branded to Pappasito's.  I ordered a chicken burrito and they gave me steak.   Went back to fix the error and they gave me steak AGAIN!   I returned to the store again and was told that their chicken is free-range which means \"it would be darker and taste differently than regular chicken\" (???).   If that's the case, then remind me to never buy free range chicken from the grocery store again. It was dry and chewy and DEFINITELY  tasted like beef!! Manager offered no recourse or refund. Tossed the terrible lump and went to Burro Burrito up the street.   Will not be eating here again."}
{"text":"Today, I used the last of 3 Groupons (I had to buy 3 for this offer) at Burrito Gordito. The burritos are quite good and large and thus filling. But during 2 of my 3 visits, the cashier (perhaps likely the owner) tried to short change me by giving me less change than I should have received, and today telling me my Groupon was worth less than the offer and that it was expired. Both were wrong and lies. Unfortunately, I find that many times when you use a Groupon, shop owners try to make back the discount they've given by shortchanging you or ripping you off somehow. I will no longer eat at Burrito Gordito!"}
{"text":"I had a small steak burrito from here. It is unfortunate that they  burned the refried beans today because everything else about the burrito was great.  There was a generous portion of really flavourful beef and all the toppings worked together well (minus the beans)."}
{"text":"This is my first time in here since they're rebranded everything seems really good the place its clean  the food is devilishly good not much of a decor but who cares i just picked up my order and left not sure whats going on in here tho cause the old staff still is in place so they just had a name change i guess  but its bussier than before and better food quality like the AAA BEEF and so on and its right on Richmond & Peter street so can't go wong ...."}
{"text":"this is an amazing place its just a take out but they do mean burritos and quesadilla they have the highest rating among the burritos in Toronto they are clean fresh and they really care  and by the way they are  not cheap they dont  nickle and dime ..."}
{"text":"I bought a groupon and was skeptical as I entered the below street entrance. I was pleasantly surprised. I got the beef burrito bowl and it was delicious, filling, fresh, spicy and a great price. I would definitely go back. New fav spot downtown for a quickbite."}
{"text":"I'm ambivalent about this place. Every time I've entered, I've been greeted with a smile, eye contact and a friendly \"hello\". It's always a nice touch. But I went for a burrito today and was thoroughly disappointed. The steak was dry and pretty flavourless - it was definitely a sub-par burrito. Won't be back for a while, but I'm trying not to give up on this place."}
{"text":"Compared to mexican/texmex in many other cities, Burrito Gordito is not good. They don't even make their own salsa - and are using a bad store bought one. Food is bland, boring, and I would not recommend. The only two positives are that their staff was nice and they are open late."}
{"text":"This is my 3rd time in here and I only have had great experience honestly really cool great food and very fast you know the place gets packed so waiting few minutes not a big thing however the downside not much Spanish spoken in here  but the good food quality and the place that's just waking distance from my office it's really cool but the same people work in there just like before other than the name change I don't know the difference but I'll be back for more lounges  .."}
{"text":"*DJ Khaled voice* Shrimp and chicken burrito here is a major key"}
{"text":"Awesome food, awesome and friendly staff. Good portions. Quick service too! Open late, even on weekdays. Our go-to late night burrito joint in Toronto."}
{"text":"We came here with a Groupon and overall our experience was great. We got the half steak half chicken quesadillas which tasted great (although I don't think their steak is actual steak) and the tacos with pulled pork which were awesome! The total came to 19.39 and was enough food for 2."}
{"text":"This is the old Burrito Bandidos. Was concerned that the quality changed with the ownership but it was still delicious, well-priced, and weighed a ton. You walk down some short steps, watch your head, and head inside. Not much seating or standing room but if you order ahead you won't have to wait. Open late too!"}
{"text":"It's huge and full of fresh ingredients! This Is the go to place for a reward after a good workout at the GoodLife around the corner. Always large and yummy. Normally deserving of 5 stars but last time I had it there was very small portion of meat so it didn't taste that good.   Highly recommend and would be coming back often."}
{"text":"This is still the original Burrito Boyz to me, but even though it has changed over the years it is still good. The hot sauce they make can be wicked hot but it is soooo good.  I totally recommend the halibut burrito if you want to go all out, there is something about it which is just perfect. if you are being cost conscious then Steak is the way to go for something more traditional."}
{"text":"I ate here.  I like it better than Chipotle, z-teca and Burrito Boys.  They don't charge extra for guacamole and they toast ur burrito."}
{"text":"Burrito Gordito Legendary Tex-Mex is a small Mexican restaurant on Peter. It easy to miss this place as it's tucked away below street level, but please do not make the mistake of walking by.  I kept it simple and grabbed a small burrito with spicy pulled pork for about $8. They call it small, but as is often the case with a burrito, they'll fit a lot of love into those pita walls. Like any self respecting man, I said yes to all of the toppings, which includes: rice, tomatoes, lettuce, green onion, refried beans, cilantro cheese, green pepper, and guacamole jalape√±os. It's generally hard to find a \"bad\" burrito so my expectations were rather neutral, but God damn did I like this burrito. Sure the ingredients appeared relatively fresh and the burrito was filling, but the superb refried beans, the spicy pulled pork, and the extra bit of hot sauce took me to a special place. Fair warning: they do not mess around with spicy here. If you ask for hot sauce, they'll give you Mexican attitude hot sauce, not North American tingle-your-tongue hot sauce. Fight through it though and appreciate a dynamite burrito.  Lastly, you should know that this a small place and that though there is some seating, you can maybe only fit five seated people in there. Again, it's small. Take your food and go."}
{"text":"Had a small steak bowl the other day. They give you a generous portion of salad, guacamole and steak. I asked for extra spicy and it was indeed spicy. Will definitely come back if i am shopping around Queen west."}
{"text":"Small Shop, Big Tastes! The staff is very friendly and helpful with any questions you have. The food was wonderful with a very Tex-Mex feel which was comforting. It's a quaint wonderful shop with very good food and friendly staff! Will return!!"}
{"text":"I was heartbroken when Burrito Banditos closed down and was super excited to see a new spot open up in the same location. The menu and quality are extremely similar to Banditos so if you're a fan, don't hesitate to check it out."}
{"text":"It doesn't look like much on the outside but it's a very good burrito. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"More like a 3.5. Ingredients were really fresh and portion was pretty big for a \"small\". I was hoping the meat would be more flavourful, but it was just okay. I'm gonna give this place another shot and order something else next time."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place during my adventures in Toronto this past weekend. I was in town for NBA All Star Weekend and heading to a party a few doors down from this little gem. There was a delay in getting into the club and it was BEYOND freezing outside so we decided to walk down the street to find someplace to duck out of the cold. To my surprise we found this great little burrito place it's a very small venue, but great for a quick bite. Everything was made fresh as you waited. I had a shrimp quesadilla which was HUGE! Big juicy shrimp which I watched him sear and packed with any other ingredients you choose. It was super cheesy and flavorful. Best part is they are open until 4am! If you're clubbing in the area definitely check them out!"}
{"text":"I got quasadilla steak+ chicken.  +1 Big portion, very filling +1 Taste good, hot, generous amount of meat and cheese -0.5 Mexican food must be eaten the second it is out! Awkward sitting place, the cashiers get a good view of you as you eat.  +1 open late (11:00 PM) WOW! -0.5 Price: I could get 2 burritos and a pop at a place near there which taste very good as well."}
{"text":"Really a hidden treasure. Its got that locals only, hole in the wall, open late charm :)  Fantastic food, service and the portions are very generous. We got tacos and they were absolutely loaded with toppings. The steak was super flavorful and tender.  Much better than the usual mexican chains, this is what Toronto's about."}
{"text":"Burritos the size of a small child. Probably the best burrito I've ever had! Nice location too, kind of a hole in the wall kinda vibe."}
{"text":"I got a Groupon deal and I went out of my way to visit this place. No biggie, I wanted to go for a walk lol. If it's your first time to look for this place, it's in the basement.   The staff was nice to me, so service, I'd say is good.  Food wise, it's nothing special. I prefer burrito boys, but I'd take them over chipotle. Their rice was incredibly dry though, when it actually hurts to eat it already. I mean, not the entire rice on my burrito, but enough for me to notice. I'm talking about when you refrigerate the rice and did not cover it... It'll get crazy hard... Ya... That. I'm sure it was just a bad day for the rice as I didn't read any comment about it.   I'd give them a four if it wasn't for that rice.   It's good. It's filling. It's worth it for the price, but it's not something I'd go out of my way for again.   I recommend it if you are in the area, craving for a burrito and are mad hungry, this place will hit that spot.  Update:  Alright, so I went back for my second groupon, got the Chicken burrito.  I got it before 2pm, so they haven't been open for that long.  The same problem, super dry rice.  There were no more shards of glass...I mean rice...but it was still really dry.  I'm starting to wonder if that's a thing for burritos."}
{"text":"I have never had a positive experience at this burrito joint  I have visited many times as it is right beside my work and home  Burritos are always square and cold  Wait times are always excessive  Today I stood inside of an empty establishment and waited about five minutes for someone to acknowledge me.   I walked out without ordering, having had enough."}
{"text":"These burritos taste 'cleaner' and more wholesome than the previous version with Burrito Bandidos.  The ingredients seem more fresh.  Menu seems very similar to previous owners.  Some new options would be nice....  Management appears to be making an effort to be more friendly to customer too, which never hurts.  +1 For apparently *not* using Halal meats (at least not according to signs on the door) which Burrito Bandidos used :P"}
{"text":"This place is called Pappasito's now, so I'm not sure why it's still listed as Burrito Gordito here.  Anyway, I'll always have a soft spot for this location since it was here that Burrito Boyz was born all those years ago. It's changed hands quite a few times since then and Pappasito's is its latest iteration.  I had purchased a Groupon, so I arrived at lunch to take advantage. The woman taking my order seemed utterly baffled by my voucher and spent almost five minutes trying to figure out how to redeem it. The line behind me kept growing and I was getting angrier (and more embarrassed) by the minute. If you don't have a system in place to seamlessly accept a Groupon, maybe you shouldn't be *offering* Groupons.  I digress. I ordered the pulled pork burrito and was asked if I wanted everything on it. (Of course I do!) I received the finished burrito a few minutes later and took it outside to eat.  My first observation was that the burrito had been made using a whole wheat tortilla, even though I wasn't asked if I wanted white or whole wheat. Why would you *default* to the whole wheat? Nobody likes whole wheat! And making things worse, this particular tortilla was stale, so it really stood out like a sore thumb with each bite.  The filling contained in this thoroughly disappointing 'rito was fine, I guess, although I have to say the pulled pork was extremely underwhelming. It had no real flavor and the texture was akin to a wet paper towel.  With this kind of lackluster service and subpar food, I can't imagine Pappasito's will survive too much longer in this neighborhood, given its close proximity to Burrito Boyz, Fat Bastard, and even Smoke's."}
{"text":"Good burrito.  Will go back. Just happend to find this place by luck.  Small quaint little place.  Burrito tasted great and was well stuffed with ingredients."}
{"text":"I was walking around downtown Toronto on my way to Fat Bastard Burrito when I luckily ran into this place. For the longest time, I have been looking for a new family run type of Tex-Mex place to get my fix and this place doesn't disappoint.   I ordered the Chicken Burrito (large) and was pleasantly surprised by how good it was. It tasted quite fresh and flavourful; something you don't always get at the other places. The chicken itself was cooked quite nicely and wasn't over or undercooked. The marinade on the chicken was quite good too and different from any other burrito/Tex-Mex place I have been too before. One other thing that I did like was the fact that they make their own hot sauce, I typically can handle to eat the hottest available spice level at any restaurant I go to, but here wasn't the case! The hot sauce had me running for water! So if you can't handle spice make sure to get a very minimal amount of hot sauce put.  The location is quite hidden and you have to really have your eyes open otherwise it is easy to miss this place. Once inside you will notice they are rather small and lack any sort of traditional seating asides from a bench like table with some stools. Having said that, even at its busiest times I would still say it is best to take your food out regardless if there is space to sit.   Service was quite good and I couldn't really say anything was wrong per-say as I already knew what I was having to eat. However, many of the other reviewers do say that service is always quite good!   I would definitely give this place a check if you are ever in downtown as it definitely a nice change from the other burrito places that are popular in Toronto."}
{"text":"How are they legendary when they only have one location and it seems they're copying burrito Bandidos.  I wouldn't recommend this place.  The staff seems unfriendly and lack professionalism.  I tried the steak and it was soo dry.  Wish Bandidos was still here not this cheap imitation.  I've heard they've let go of the staff from Bandidos and used them to get recipes from burrito Bandidos.  Not going back"}
{"text":"First of all, don't call ground beef 'Steak AAA'. That's outright false advertisement. Everything was so mushy I couldn't tell what was in the burrito. For the money you pay for small burrito, you can get a large laffa wrap at mevame few blocks away."}
{"text":"Burritos are about as good as most burrito joints, but what sets it apart is the warm and friendly service from the staff. Even at near midnight on a Saturday, in what surely can't be an easy shift, the girl behind the counter manages to smile and hold a friendly conversation without sacrificing efficiency. I will tell all my friends about this hidden gem and will definitely be making my way back for another surf and turf burrito very soon."}
