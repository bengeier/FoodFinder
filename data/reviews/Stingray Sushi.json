{"text":"Good Service, great Sushi, Horrible clientele. Its unfortunate the crowd that is drawn here because it's a beautiful room and the service was fantastic, I ordered the Chefs choice (served in a boat for about $25 or so) and was treated to some great Sushi. The room was full of douchbags and assholes that crowded my table in a \"standing room only\" approach to mindlessly pounding Sake bombers. Shame, if it could only move away from the heart of the douchbag kingdom of Scottsdale and get a chance to serve up that great Sushi with a crowd looking to truly enjoy it."}
{"text":"I could have gotten over the fact that this place is SO Scottsdale and always majorly packed.  After waiting an hour and a half outside for a table we decided to venture into the crowded bar.  The waitress was extraordinarily rude.  My friend had what looked like dandruff on the bottom of his glass and kindly asked for a new one.  The waitress replied in a rude manner and almost didn't give him a new glass.  We waited ANOTHER hour and still never got seated.  So, finally, we left because our group was so starving.  I've eaten at Stingray before and I'll admit the sushi isn't bad.  But, it is definitely not worth it because the place is always too crowded and it should never take more than 2.5 hours to be sat.  Also, add on top of it that the waitstaff is completely rude.  I probably won't ever go back."}
{"text":"I went there for drinks with friends who were visiting from out of town.  Being new to Arizona myself wanted to explore what old town had to offer.  If you are not a regular they ignore you completely.  Bar staff was not friendly, manager was not very professional.  We left before finishing drinks and had an excellent time some of,the other places nearby."}
{"text":"Okay :)... several months after I posted my review on Stingray Biltmore I recieved an email from one of their partners!  He offered me a $50.00 gift card and said he felt the problems I had experienced there had been rectified.  I, being a believer in 2nd chances, took a few friends to Stingray in hopes of a better experience.  I must say that the service wasn't AS bad (and it was REALLY bad the first time) but it was not great, and our bartender/server (as we sat at a booth in the bar) was definitely absent minded.  HOWEVER, the fact that one of their partners cared enough to take the time to read and respond to my email says a lot!!  If for nothing else, I can respect that and had to up the stars a bit.  I do think one of the partners or owners should find a way to eat there unnoticed, so they would recieve the same service as everyone else is actually getting there."}
{"text":"The fish and selection is decent, but the service at the sushi bar is practically non-existant.  I've been there several times and I'm constantly waiting for either a server to greet me, ask for a drink refill, get my check, or really anything.  The past 3 times I went there was just during lunch (when it isn't busy at all), and each time I've had to ask the chefs to flag down my server because I needed something.  Not sure if I'll go back after several mediocre experiences."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is 4 stars, but sushi gets 5 stars. I live nearby and I'm officially addicted to the \"Godzilla\" roll !! I've also been to the Scottsdale Quarter location, and although the atmosphere is much more hip at this location, the sushi was not as fresh as the Old Town location. Go asap and order the Godzilla roll !! It's monstrous and delicious and you will be stuffed full when you leave !!!"}
{"text":"If there was a an option to give zero stars I would've picked it and left it at that but I have never been so tempted to walk out in my entire life. The quality was horrible. The manager/bartender was on her phone texting the whole time and decided to sit down and leave us waiting on our drinks for forever without even an apology or acknowledgement. Don't come here. Ever. Please save yourself from spending money on bad sushi and drinks you won't feel even if you chug and order more."}
{"text":"I will start with the good! Sushi was good!

SERVICE SUCKS! We sat for 15 mins before going up to the bar and had to ask for a drink. It was not even crowded. Service was so bad when we wanted anything we would have to go to the bar to get drinks which were weak. The bartender was so rude she acted as if we were putting her out. After being here for over 2 hrs and this going on we asked for a Manager who never came over. We asked again for the manager who walked past us 3 different times before coming over and was so taken back by our comments about her staff. She was RUDE and basically said it looks like the food was good since you eat it. REALLY THATS NOT CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!

I think the staff all young girls in their low 20's were more interested in the guys at the bar then servicing the customers they have.  We still tipped the staff but really should not have since the service was so bad.
I would NOT suggest going here unless you want MAD SERVICE!"}
{"text":"Very good food, terrible service. Maybe they don't feel the need to get good people in there.... I have been in the hospitality industry for 13 years and was quite disappointed. They need some people with personality and professionalism and everyone would make better money. We weren't even sure who our actual server was, who we were tipping  (we tipped based on service ). Rich area, good money to be had. Get better help."}
{"text":"I really like this place. Yes, there are times when the place is overflowing and you may feel like you're eating with the table next to you, but the food is delicious!
I've been coming here for a couple of years and the sushi is always fresh and interesting. 
My favorite has to be their signature Stingray roll. The flavors come together in a tangy, sushi-licious (yes, I made up a word) kind of way!
Happy Hour is worth your while price-wise."}
{"text":"I don't know about you all but I think it is so hard to find great sushi and sake at a reasonable price. Especially in Scottsdale! That was until I went to Stingray for Happy Hour. I could not believe the prices. Every roll was only $3 to $5, the food was all under $5, and there was sake for a dollar and a glass of exceptional wine for like $4. You have to try the Gyoza (they are like dumplings). Delicious! This Happy Hour has all the favorites too. The spicy tuna roll, dragon roll (my personal favorite), the shrimp tempura roll, calamari and much much more!

I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I go to college in the Phoenix area, and my roommate suggested to come here. I am glad she made the suggestion because this place is pretty impressive! I will probably come again when I start school.

Setting: It was a nice setting. Nice atmosphere inside the restaurant, and their indoor aquarium is really attractive.

Food: I got the yakiniku stir fry just because I am a bit hesitant when it comes to seafood here. I am from Hawaii, and I am very picky about fresh seafood. The yakiniku stir fry was awesome! Fair portion for its price. My roommate's family offered me to try their food. My roommate had a poke bowl. The quality is actually pretty impressive! Her dad got a rib eye steak, and her mom got seared ahi. Both food items were great as well!

Service: This impressed me the most. I was able to ask my waitress if I could have rice with my entree. I had a good idea of what kinds of portions me and my roommate's family would expect. Our waitress would check up on us, and it was awesome.

Prices: Yes, prices may be a bit more expensive because it is seafood. However, the correlation between the food quality, food portion, and price is fair."}
{"text":"Have eaten here many of times while in town for business.  Each time was at the bar so I really can't speak to the restaurant section experience.  The food is great, that bartenders are a lot of fun and the atmosphere is perfect for date, catching up with the guys, or pre-gaming before heading out.  I hear the Happy Hour is a treat.  Half-off apps and drinks!"}
{"text":"If I could I would give it zero stars.  It took so long to get our sushi I finally threw my arms up and said that's it I'm out of here.  I took forever for the smart mouthed bartender to get our check.  I talked with the manager and she acted like she could care less that a regular was never coming back.  
Don't eat here.  I'm going back to RA.  By the way I got my sushi right away at RA.  Stingray sucks."}
{"text":"We had reservations at Geisha across the street this past Saturday, but since the wait was about 1.5 hours, we ended up at Stingray.

The three of us shared a few dishes, as follows:
* house salad ($5) - had a couple of bites, nothing special
* beef yakitori (2 skewers / $9) - cooked medium and very tender, but would have been bland without the three sauces on the side 
* scallop dynamite ($9) - tried a bite and found the scallops to be overcooked and the sauce too tart
* mango tango ($13) - liked the combination of the red eye tuna, chunks of mango, greens, and light sauce (would have been better had the tuna been fresher and chopped into smaller pieces)
* sea urchin sashimi ($17) - the serving here is more generous than I've had at other sushi restaurants, and although not the freshest I've tasted, was more than adequate to satisfy my craving
* Nabeyaki udon ($19) - good flavor
* California roll ($5.50) - I never bother to try this 

I tried the Japanese Tease ($9), a drink made with citrus vodka, green tea extract, colpico, and lime juice. This was too sweet, and I barely tasted any vodka (or green tea). Although pretty to look at, definitely not worth the price. 

We also shared the green tea tempura ice cream ($7), which came with three pieces - perfect for our group. The others raved about this dessert, but I found it to be nothing special. The batter tasted too pasty, for lack of a better word. I'm also not a fan of green tea, so this may have something to do with my less than enthusiastic reaction.

Our server was Sarah, and although a sweet gal, we didn't see much of her during our time there. Stingray is a nice looking restaurant, but I've had better sushi at Kabuki (Tempe) and at my fave place, Roka Akor (Scottsdale)."}
{"text":"Food was fine but service was beyond horrible!!  Blamed the 45 minute delay on receiving my appetizers on a system error in the kitchen - whatever!!  If the wait staff had even bothered to check on me during that time it would have been obvious there was a problem before I had to call the manager on the phone from my table!!  Oh and to top it off I had to stop a random server after 15 minutes of being ignored to ask for water and the water glass they brought me was chipped!!"}
{"text":"One star for the decor.  That's it.

The food was terrible!!  Everything from the sashimi, to the nigiri, the maki rolls, the udon, and the bento boxes were boring.  I come from the San Francisco bay area where we have some serious foodies and expect mouth-watering, mind-blowing sushi.  This place is MISERABLE!

Only TWO sushi chefs during lunch hour???  What is management thinking??  By the time all our food was served, we sat there for 2 1/2 hours.  Are you kidding me?  That's just ridiculous!

Go somewhere else, any where - just don't go to Stingray for good sushi."}
{"text":"Firstly everything that was an appetizer or smaller plate was fried - lobster, rock shrimp, chicken.. then to top it off they cover the fried pieces in mayo.. I looked fro something that was not battered and fried and could not find anything other than actual dinner items. THEN I absolutely hate seaweed - yet if you try to sub for soy paper it removed the happy hour price from the sushi roll and they upcharge you .. this has been the case both times I have visited this place and for that reason alone I for sure won't be going back to this place. There are half a dozen local sushi spots that have better pricing, food, and rules."}
{"text":"The location is pretty great as it is tucked back into an outdoor shopping area, so there was plenty to do before and after dinner if you're so inclined.  The room is spacious and well designed and the bar, which is mostly outside, was buzzing.  I didn't care for the miso soup (I think there was cilantro in it..not great) but the sushi was great.  I had the salmon sushi, spicy tuna roll, and the tuna on crispy rice.  The salmon was pretty amazing; the tuna on crispy rice was good, but I could have done with less crispy rice (the rice was a fairly large rectangle pattie versus the miniature tator-tot size you get at other places).  The prices were reasonable as well, not like LA where a sushi dinner can set you back $100 a person or more."}
{"text":"After a few bad experiences here, I will not be returning.  The most recent experience I ordered takeout, I get home to find that there is no dipping sauce for the tempura, which is spongy (mind you I live very close, so the food was not sitting around for an extended amount of time before I consumed it), in addition to the fact that 2 more items in my to go order aren't even present. Upon calling to ask why they don't check their orders before sending them away with their patrons, I only received an apology with no explanation, after speaking with the manager I was still dissatisfied as they could not tell me why, when there were only two tables sitting in the restaurant they couldn't take a moment to check my order for accuracy, and once again the manager as well as the hostess were very nonchalant about my concerns. Besides the fact that the service was so poor and unprofessional, the food was mediocre at best. 

This leads me to a previous time that I ate at the Biltmore location, for lunch, and found a large piece of plastic in my mouth after taking a bite of my salad. After alerting the waitress she only said \"Oh, Sorry\". That was it, they proceeded to leave the remaining food for my consumption and didn't take anything off of the bill until I asked for a manager. 

From unacceptable service to mediocre (overpriced) food, Stingray is not a place I'll be going again."}
{"text":"The ONLY reason I am giving this location 2 stars (which I am reluctant to do) is because of the food.  I was SO put off by the HORRIBLE service we received I couldn't even believe it......

We went in on a Friday night, between 8 and 9, with my boyfriend and a friend.  We expected it to be packed, it was dead as a doornail.  Was greeted by a server.  She couldn't answer any questions about the drinks.  Fine, whatever.  Maybe she's new.  We decided to each order a signature cocktail and my boyfriend ordered a vodka martini.  We sat there for literally 20 mins with no drinks.  FINALLY the server comes back, still with no drinks, to tell us the drink I ordered, that the bar was out of one of the ingredients.  Fine, I order something else.

When we FINALLY got our drinks 30 mins into being there, we ordered our food.  That was brought out piecemeal, fine we weren't fussy. The food was good.

We cringed though everytime we needed to order a drink and actually ordered two at a time because of how long it was taking.  Our server disappeared to God knows where during the service, we had to ask a manager to get her, he didn't seem the least bit concerned about our service.  The bartender sucked too.  Believe me I am not blaming the server solely.  The bar obviously was slow too.

I love Stingray, but will NEVER EVER EVER go back to that location."}
{"text":"this place is just AWEFUL!!  If you find yourself walking by and are tempted...JUST KEEP WALKING...IT IS SIMPLY NOT WORTH THE TROUBLE.  
The manager could care less...and was busy flirting with the cute girls.  
The bartender was clueless, dare I say....stupid.....slow, unorganized.
Our food arrive 45 minutes after we ordered..AND WE WERE NOT THE ONLY ONES!
I hope they re-open SAM's Cafe in its place in a few months...I am sure Stingray will not be there long!!!"}
{"text":"This place is disgusting!!!!! First off its not an authentic japanese place, the waiteress was nice , she did very well on knowing the menu but the food sucks. I didnt get to try the sushi becuz there were no more and seriously if your a restaurant always have extra food instead of running out. My drink was disgusting also I order a pineapple cocktail and it tasted like ginger( i dont like ginger), then I ordered a different drink kiwi and pineapple cocktail but it tasted like dishwashing soap ewww the waitress said it was how the recipe is. The shrimp tempura was good which I had as an appetizer but my fuji apple salmon entree was disturbing because the salmon tasted like it wasnt clean and the mash potatoes tasted like it was spoiled. I didnt even borther with dessert I just wanted to leave. My friend on the other hand enjoyed her ginger cocktail which was suppose to b pineapple and she enjoyed her filet (beef filet with mashed potatoes) she gets a side eye from me becuz who eats beef at a japanese restaurant.  After spending $67 buck each I was quiet disappointed in this fake Japanese spot. The next day my stomach was still upset from eating there. Thats a whole night n day n half with upset stomach.:-X"}
{"text":"Very creative menu, modern vibrant ambience and terrific service.  As a nationwide traveler in pursuit of great sushi this is a high ranking stop.  Tuna sashimi was particularly good.  A roll with pico offered a unique, spring-like taste in a roll I haven't seen elsewhere.   Shumai is some of the best.  Desserts are lacking so order another nigiri or sashimi choice instead."}
{"text":"So this is my first review...never intended to write a review but after reading previous experiences, there seems to be a trend at Stingray.

Service: So after driving 6 hours, went to go eat some quick sushi for lunch with my friends.  Walked in and there was nobody to greet us or sit us.  There were only 2 tables so it wasn't like they were overwhelmed.  When somebody finally noticed us, she told us to sit down and she will bring the menus and never did until we asked again.  At this point, probably should have gone somewhere else.  The server was alright. Not the best, not the worst.

Food: The food was a hit or miss.  The fish seemed pretty standard but the salmon seemed a little off.  Had a roll with spicy tuna on top of it, but the tuna was brown and did not look appetizing at all.  For a sushi restaurant, the shrimps tacos were good.  Probably the highlight of the meal.

Not the worst sushi I have had, but I would try Sakana or something else nearby that has better service."}
{"text":"We've been regulars here for years but no longer will we spend our time and money at this establishment. We went in on a Friday night and were told to wait about 15 min. They were not overly crowded and we did not mind waiting. After being sat it took 20 min for the waitress to greet us and that was only after my husband informed the hostess that no one has come by our table. The waitress then came by after 5 more min and apologized and blamed the hostess for not telling her. She then proceeded to have an attitude about us wanting her to honor the happy hour pricing since we were sat at 6:15, and it was already past happy hour by the time she was at our table. She indicated that she would need to discuss this with her manager. After giving her out entire order from drinks to food, we were still waiting another 20 min after placing our order just for beers. How hard is it to get beers from a bartender that was just standing around. My husband had enough so we just left. The manager was at the table next to us being chewed out by a woman that was unhappy with her food and service. The manager was a 20 something woman dressed in jeans with a frumpy sweater, hair in a ponytail and completely unprofessional from mannerisms to eye rolling at the unhappy customer. I agree with other reviewer that said its a bunch of unmonitored 20 something's doing what they want without any supervision. The hostesses at the front were friendly but the sushi chefs were also dressed in t-shirts. This place has gone downhill and I'm sorry to say we will no longer be dining here. Btw two of the dishes on our table were dirty and not just a little bit. I worked in the restaurant business for years and I know how things should run. Shame on you stingray!"}
{"text":"Completely average in every way. Average ingredients, no chefs and small selection of deserts available from your grocer's frozen section."}
{"text":"I went to Stingray with my girlfriend and her exact words were \"the sushi is shit and so is the service\"
Her words sum it up perfectly.  The service was just bad.  Our waitress didn't get it at all.  It took 15 minutes to get our drinks (we were one of 5 tables) and we waited another 30 to get the sushi.  No apology, no mention about the wait.  
The sushi wasn't even good.  No better or fresher than the kind you get at Trader Joes."}
{"text":"First let me say the service was awful!!!!!  Young girls working the front as your walking in, like 3 of them and all without a clue.

My husband and I waited at least 10 mins just to be seated.

After we were seated it took another 15 mins to get a drink order in.  The drinks were good.  The bartender seem to have her job totally together.

Now this was not a Friday or Saturday Night and they were maybe 50 percent full.

The Sushi by far was the worst Sushi I have eaten.   We thought we would give this place a try.  We usually go to Pure Sushi or Sushi Brokers of which we will be going back to.

We stopped here after a Movie at the IPIC.

Back to the Sushi.....  Not Fresh at all......    The couple sitting next to us complained about the service for at least 10 mins.

Needless to say I would not recommend this place at all!!!!"}
{"text":"I may be biased because my friend is one of the managers here, but it is one of my favorite places to start out a night out. Great rolls, amazing calamari, and good prices. I love their decor and have about 50 million pictures of me and my girls with the orange wall as the backdrop. It's also great for a lazy weekday dinner, too. You can dress down and still feel comfortable....in fact, i'm heading over tonight after monday night football for a quick sushi fix!"}
{"text":"The bar staff very polite and professional however sushi chefs swearing in Spanish nasty words..wife was upset we both speak spanish..such a classy place except for that."}
{"text":"Good sushi and environment.  I prefer Pearl, but I don't mind stopping by here every once in a while."}
{"text":"Very disappointing service. We put in our order at 6:40, received 1/2 of it 30 minutes later, and the rest came 1 1/2hrs after we first placed our order! 

We were a group of 3, we went straight to the bar and stood behind 1 empty chair. We asked for menus, the bar tender took our drink order, brought menus then ignored us until she brought our drinks. I gave her our sushi order and she snapped back that she couldn't serve us food unless 2 seats were open.  The people to each side of our group all expressed their sympathies for her bad attitude, this was the first I ever heard of this protocol. 
We were there for a total of 2 hrs just for drinks and appetizers. As it turned out she forgot to ring in part of our order which is  why it took so long to come out, she never acknowledged her mistake nor apologized for the long wait. She lacked the customer service and didn't think to at least offer us water."}
{"text":"It was a Sunday night visit to Stingray. With a variety of sushi, drinks, blasting music and hipster decor, the place is designed to cater to the 21-35 set. And so it seems to be doing a great job of that -- the place was packed to the gills (no pun intended) with the typical Scottsdale club trash -- the finest sets of plastic tits and bleached teeth that daddy's money can buy.

Despite sitting squarely in their age demographic, the place was so not my speed. Although the sushi was good, and the sashimi very fresh, the place had all the ambiance of a high-school cafeteria. Imagine the cheerleader table after 5 appletinis, now multiply that by 10.

Perhaps a Tuesday night visit would be a bit more low key. Our dinner companion and I are willing to give it another go (I can overlook ambiance for good food). My boy, Epistoman, however would rather ram a chopstick into his eye than eat there again."}
{"text":"I like THIS location of the chains!  The sushi was good and the prices were more reasonable than other similar places in Old Town Scottsdale.  I had the small sushi boat- it came with a good amount of stuff for the price."}
{"text":"Been to this restaurant plenty of times on vacation. The last time however (4/17/15) I got severe food poisoning. I had the crunchy  roll, spicy tuna, and shrimp tempura. It made for the worst flight back home possible."}
{"text":"Ambiance was great, waitress was cute and helpful, the food was YUMMY..."}
{"text":"Decided to grab something quick while on my 45min lunch break. I was greeted by the hostess, nice blond recommend the bar. That's when shit went down hill fast! A brunette bartender/waitress took her sweet time making her way over to me after about 10min I was able to place a drink order in, she dashed away before I could let her know I'd like to place my order to go. 5 minutes after receiving my water I was handed a menu, just for her to dash off again to gossip with with another brunette male employee. 30 min of just sitting there with water and no order placed I decided to head back to work! The atmosphere seemed nice enough I'd HIGHLY recommend sitting anywhere but the bar!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour prices and drinks! The sushi was okay. I had higher expectations. It was not as fresh as I thought it would be but it was alright. The tacos are okay. Can't beat their prices though"}
{"text":"The quest for enlightenment has taken Westerners to many Eastern locales...including but not limited to Tibet, Polonnaruwa, the Wat Phra Kaew, and now Scottsdale's own Stingray Sushi. For here, not just food is on the menu, but a spiritual awakening itself as proven by the restaurant's liberal use of \"wise sayings\". Ironically, Zen, which is often associated with Japan, focuses most on knowledge gained through personal experience not theory. But in hindsight, this is all for the better.

Immediately upon opening Stingray's door you are almost always greeted by cacophony. Hardly the place one might think to enjoy deep meditation, but as I would learn, the restaurant embodies the Four Noble Truths of restaurants in Scottsdale perfectly.

First, space is the ultimate luxury. Agoraphobics beware, Stingray's design may hint at Asian sensibilities...but it's really more about the high rent. To your right is the sushi bar and several dining tables. To your left is the other kind of bar with the other kind of tables. Outside are yet more tables on a patio. If you are in a group, you undoubtedly risk a wait. But despite this, I've often been seated within minutes of showing up...especially at the sushi bar.

The next maxim? It's not a restaurant, it's a destination. When evaluating a sushi joint, the most important distinction is one that is invisible...literally. It's how well the rice is treated with the vinegar. In that regard, Stingray does fine. Some of the fish come out stronger and fresher than others...but I have not yet uncovered a pattern. 

Which brings us to the next truth: sex sells. Take the dim, dark surroundings and add raw meat and you already have the makings of a potboiler. But Stingray, like many sushi establishments of its kind goes to great lengths to milk the exotic allure of Asian culture. How far you ask...far enough to hire a small coterie of young, comely women to serve you regardless of their service skills. Some are excellent, some are clueless, and some ignore me because I am...alas....a table for one. 

And then there's the last axiom: you get what you pay for. For if Stingray's is not the most remarkable cuisine, or service, or decor...what then causes the Ed Hardy army to drop unspeakable amounts of money within its walls? Yes, to call the crowd here \"scenster\" may be an understatement. But the people-watching, as already stated, will not disappoint.

Yet Stingray does have another allure: it's kitchen is open until midnight. So I have found myself stopping in after going to a movie, only to see it packed and vibrant. Yet no one disturbs me, leaving oneself to attend to one's bliss....and the spicy tuna."}
{"text":"Stingray for Happy Hour makes me happy! The lounge was completely full and by the time we left the restaurant was also jammed. Guess Stingray makes everyone happy!

The atmosphere had me feelin' all tingly...nothing better than a beautiful interior designed with attention to detail. Well, the food was pretty yummy too and the happy hour menu was pretty decent. Special prices on cocktails, beer and few rolls. Lets talk about cocktails - the Asian Blond; lychee puree, lychee liqueur and champagne, is a little too tasty and goes down way too easily.

Of course our eyes were much bigger than our stomachs once again. My friends weren't too keen on the crispy spicy tuna roll but that just meant more for me!. It's not like anything you've had at other sushi restaurants in the valley. The rice has been lightly crisped on the outside and the tuna is hot hot hot topped with a jalapeno. Crisped? is that a word?  The presentation and flavor is sure to delight even the pickiest of people. We also tried a new roll - cucumber on the outside with salmon on the inside - very refreshing!

Service was also great. Rachel was our server and even with a full restaurant she gave great service.

This might be a regular happy hour place for me. God I love sushi!"}
{"text":"We walked in around four thirty pm.  Maybe it was just a bad evening for them, but no-one greeted us at the door.  When a waitress did show up, she just waved her hand and said, \" you can sit anywhere\"  So we seated ourselves

We were taken care of promptly, no problems there.  However when our sushi arrived, we had to ask for soy sauce, wasabi and ginger to be served with it.  The waitress seemed surprised that we wanted it

Overall, the sushi was average.  The service was less than stellar.  The servers really need to step it up.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"The service was poor and disappointing. Our server was disinterested in providing attention to our table and was rude. The sushi quality was probably 2 1/2 to 3 stars. I haven't been to this place in over a year and it has definitely gone downhill. I would not recommend it unless you keep your expectations low, go at happy hour or sit at the bar."}
{"text":"I rarely write reviews, good or bad, but I was so shocked by my experience that I had to share it with fellow Yelppers! I am a Vegan, wether it is by choice or because of food allergies is besides the point in my opinion. Firstly, my mom went in to grab a table and no one had come by the table for drinks even after I had already parked the car, came in and was seated for over 5 minuets. It was not busy so I was not empathetic when it takes over 10 minuets and my moms fiancé to get up and ask where our waitress was. 

This is where the drama begins:
Finally she comes over and at this point we are ready to order, my mom and fiance place theirs and I ask the waitress if there is any way to get the spring rolls without shrimp (the menu says shrimp with vegetables) and she responds \"they don't come with shrimp.\" So, I point it out on the menu, tell her I am a vegan and she replies \"it doesn't come with shrimp, I don't know why the menu would said that, its just vegetables and stuff.\" I ask her to double check for me. She grabs our menus and walks away. later comes back with the drinks and a menu and says, \"I can't guarantee they don't come with shrimp so here is a menu.\" I really wanted spring rolls so I ask her to ask the manager or chef if they can make them without shrimp. She comes back and tells me they are pre-made and I cant make any special requests. I say I am surprised they pre-make their spring rolls but that I will take a cucumber salad and a cucumber roll no mayo please. (mayo is commonly put on sushi)

Then the manager comes over. (I did not ask to see a manager) and he tells me the mix is pre-made and it would take to long to make the spring rolls fresh and that they can't make me spring rolls without shrimp. (Are you kidding me, TOO LONG. they are making rainbow rolls back there and deep frying tempura) I tell him that I am simply vegan and ask what would he recommend. he says the vegetable roll. I order that with no mayo and he doesn't even apologize that he can't accommodate me and just walks away.  

She brings out my cucumber salad, I take a bite and notice it has imitation crab in it, which is cod fish normally. Now, I don't even complain or tell them to take it back I just offer it to my mother, But I am surprised because right before I ordered it, I said I was vegan so here is STRICK TWO this waitress doesn't know the menu items and what is in them. I am not high maintenance at all, I didn't complain, send it back, or ask for it to be taken off my bill.  

Later they bring out my rolls and there appears to be mayo on the vegetable roll. Now forgive me for being worried and not trusting of the competence of the people working here, I ask the waitress if this looks like mayo (I point it out) and she looks at it and says to me, thats kinda green, it is avocado. so I look again and I am still not sure but I just say ok and she walks away. I could not believe she didn't take it to the chef to be sure, and was completely rude and short about it. For all she knows I am allergic to eggs and shell fish, and if I took what she said at face value and didn't challenge her, (the shrimp or mayo) I would have taken a bite of a spring roll that would put me in shock and Id have to be rushed to the hospital (If you know about shell fish allergies, its as bad as peanut allergies) and a rash from the allergy to eggs. (mayo is made of egg whites) lucky for them I have no allergy to cod fish and I didn't complain about it in my cucumber salad either. 

Now what makes this worse is I went to Loco Patron earlier that afternoon for lunch and to me that is just a super casual sports bar that serves mexican food (they also have mac n cheese and fries) They were way more accommodating, far less rude and made me the most amazing mexican vegan plate I've had since becoming a vegan, $8 too so cheap!! They even accidently brought me a side of beans with cheese, took it back and took it off my bill. I didn't ask for that, I was just polite and they were sorry about the mistake.)

I have family in Scottsdale, grew up in Scottsdale and worked at local restaurants, Zipps, Oregano's, NYPD Pizza, to name a few. I am not some stuck up bitch whos daddy pays for everything and complain when nothing is wrong. I worked in the restaurant business and know that this was ridiculous and I could not believe this waitress knew nothing about the menu and the manager was such a chump. I have lived in Los Angeles for the last 5 years, and I know veganism is more common over there but this was just ridiculous.

I will never go there again, my family will never go there again and none of us will recommend going there. They were just plain rude. and who wants to eat pre made food at a sit down restaurant. at least Jack in the Box doesn't make it till you order it. WTF."}
{"text":"Terrible rolls. The Dragon was so so. The California was bland and the Spicy Tuna was cat food. Seriously, it  looked like canned cat food and tasted horrible."}
{"text":"My least favorite sushi experience in a long time . . .I've had better from the grocery store in those plastic boxes.  Took an employee on their recommendation.  I guess it's quite different at happy hour and the evening.  Very nice surroundings down to the fish swimming in the floor. That day it must have been a \"two-fer\"  Sushi and attitude all for the price of the sushi.

Rachel T. sums it up well!"}
{"text":"I actually was surprised people gave this place more than 2 stars. Actually, I'm glad, though. Because if I see you actually gave this place more than 2 stars, I know  NOT to read your reviews anywhere else as you have lost all credibility. I was actually trying to figure out how to put no stars. Luckily for Stingray, I'm giving you ONE star. I thnk the owner atleast owes me a side of edamame for being generous. 

This place is one of the most overrated restaurants in Scottsdale. I've, unfortunately, been here a couple times. I've never had good sushi. The rice is hard, the rolls are bland, and the sashimi isn't even fresh. I made the mistake of bringing my out of town friends to this place, and they were all disappointed with the food.  Kyoto, which is up the road, is a lot better and cheaper. 

The waitresses are one can short of a six pack. The bar scene is Scottsdale at its worst. I always wonder why this place has 3 hostesses? I guess it takes 3 of them to do one person's job. This place is garbage."}
{"text":"Aaaallllll right.... I will come to the defense of Stingray.  It's not the best sushi i've ever had.  But it's certainly pretty good, especially for Phoenix.  

The Cabo Blanco roll is very good for a fusion type roll.  Mexican flair on your sushi roll?!  Ole!  

It's not the cheapest, but who the hell is looking for cheap sushi?  Honestly people... Do you really want the cheapest possible RAW fish? Think that through for a second...  Right, i thought not. 

The Biltmore location is convenient.  The decor is pretty cool.  The crowd is far better than the Scottsdale location.  I've never had a problem with the service and i've been there at least a half dozen times & i'm sure i'll end up there again for lunch sometime soon.   Give it a shot!"}
{"text":"Wait Time: We were seated right away on a Sunday afternoon. They weren't really busy. 

Service: Our server was OK. Nothing above average, but after she gave us our check, she was nowhere to be found when we needed another pen. We saw her later at the front desk with about 6 other girl workers just talking and not really do anything. I understand it was a slow day, but at least do something productive. 

Food: The only thing I loved here was the crispy sushi rice. Probably the best I've tried since moving to Phoenix. All the other sushi were mediocre. 

Price: It's only worth going if you go during their happy hour. 

Ambience: I really liked the layout and design. A little dark on one side and bright on the other side with the glass wall. 

Overall: I would just come back for the crispy sushi rice."}
{"text":"Probably the worst service ever! The bartender/manager was never behind the bar. Then sat down to do an interview which took way too long so our drinks took about 30 minutes! It had to be the poor kids first day serving cause he seemed so confused and lost the whole time! He also would disappear at times when he was needed! There was 2 tables in here and 2 servers on, and they still couldn't figure it out!!! 
The food was also terrible! Which I guess we should've known! Sushi in AZ...what a bad idea! 
Don't ever come here!!!!"}
{"text":"In general, the sushi here is great.  The atmosphere and dining experience is excellent.  The raw sashimi needs improvement sometimes it's stringy and chewy and sometimes it's good.  Believe it or not, Hillstone across the street has better sashimi and the quality is always consistent."}
{"text":"Stingray sushi in the Scottsdale quarter has the worst management imaginable and I would deter anyone from EVER going there! I was a long time repeat customer, so much as going there daily even, and was there again one evening recently. I paid my bill but the girl that I was with did not. She tried to give them a gift card that she had won for playing some poker at El Santo which is owned by the same group and they would not let her use it, only when it was given to her, it was specified that it COULD be used at Stingray. She did not have the extra money and she was unable to pay without the use of this gift card. When I went back alone the next day they said that I couldn't dine there again even though I paid MY bill the day before! How fair is that? I was at their grand opening and practically every day thereafter! Stingray Sushi in the Scottsdale Quarter is the absolute worst sushi place ever just because of the incredibly horrible management. The Chinese guy is immensely a piss poor managerial figure! If anyone is at all thinking of going there for sushi I would beg you to reconsider! Stingray Sushi is a horrible place mainly because of the staff there, but also because their sushi has only gone up in price and the quality of it has gone down. If anyone is thinking of going there I would plead and beg you to go somewhere else. RA in Kierland is across the street and the people there are super nice and the sushi is big and really good! Just say no...to Stingray Sushi in Scottsdale Quarter!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great time at stingray sushi! We had a large group and the service was excellent; didn't feel like we were waiting on anything. Owner also treated us to some comp happy hour cocktails, so take some friends and go try your luck!"}
{"text":"I've been here once before and thought it only average.  My boyfriend and I tried to go to Shin Bay with a friend a couple of weeks ago but since we didn't have reservations we couldn't get in so we ended up here instead even though I wasn't very enthused about it. It was our lucky night because most of what we ordered was good.  

We ordered two rolls, a sashimi plate that came with rice, lobster ceviche and squid salad.  I don't recall which rolls we had but I'm sure at least one involved spicy tuna. The squid salads were much larger than we get at most places and pretty average.  The lobster ceviche was fresh and had the right amount of acid for me.  The waitress asked if there were any fish we disliked but we couldn't think of anything so we ended up with five different fish including mackerel.  Neither my boyfriend or our friend liked that so I ended up eating it all.  It was OK though I wouldn't go out of my way to order it again.  The fish was all fresh that evening so no complaints there.

We also ordered some Nigori sake but unfortunately didn't specify which one so we ended up with a lot more than we needed. The quality wasn't as good as what we typically order.  I also had a stock exchange which was refreshing. 

My boyfriend and I each ordered some ice cream of different flavors.  I had asked the waitress if it was just a small amount as I only wanted a scoop.  Turned out to be about three scoops each so it mostly went to waste.  It wasn't very good either and I would advise not ordering it."}
{"text":"Went to Stingray on Sunday looking forward to a great meal. Was greeted by the hostess and she informed me that there would be a 15 minute wait. Please keep in mind that there were 22 people in the entire restaurant. At least 12 tables I saw that were empty. I asked what was the problem and she said they only had 2 servers and the kitchen was backed up. I asked if we could wait in the bar and perhaps just had a drink. She said no we don't have staff for that. I then asked her what she thought we should do... she replied \"well you can eat someplace else\". We did and certainly will not return. Sad."}
{"text":"We went for drinks and sushi during Happy Hour.
We sat in the bar and were ignored for a while by the bartender as she was too busy cutting limes for the crowd she was expecting.
Finally she came over to our table and took our order.
I had the Hotty Hamachi which was very good. My friend ordered the Lobster Ceviche which  did not arrive with our other dishes. We asked our server to check and minutes later it arrived. 
As we ate  our server went back to cutting limes when a customer walked in at sat at the bar. She was ignored for about 5 minutes and finally walked out.
Bad service. Okay food. Good sake selection for happy hour prices."}
{"text":"Mixed feelings about this place.

First of all, the two female hostesses were incredibly rude.  They seemed way to busy walking around in their mini- dresses to actually acknowledge or seat us.  

We finally got seated at the sushi bar, because those were the \"only open seats,\" despite about half the restaurant being empty at 8:30 on a Saturday night.  

After being seated the night got much better.  We were promptly greeted by one of the sushi chefs as well as our server.  Apparently if you sit at the sushi bar you get free soup and edamame, which is a really nice touch.  

Our sushi came out fast, our server was always nearby, and everything was tasty.

Overall a good experience, but it was tainted by the rudeness/ vanity of the two hostesses."}
{"text":"The ambience reminded me of Las Vegas but that's where the similarities ended. 

The sushi was 'meh' - forgettable and less than fresh. The wait staff was slow and inattentive.  We had a gift card so the experience wasn't quite as disappointing as it would have been. 

What really tanked this review was the fact that they served a beer that plainly said \"Best By\" and the date on it was 6 MONTHS AGO.

When we flagged down the manager he didn't apologize but said \"Are you sure it's not the Born On date (which you can see in the pic that it says \"Best By\"). When this was pointed out to him he blamed the vendor and asked if we wanted another one - even though we were actively on our way out and why would we want more expired beer?

Bad management, mediocre food. Save your money and go to Sushi Catcher instead."}
{"text":"Visited the one in Scottsdale Quarter for dinner . . The door to enter is quite interesting and the ambience inside is very hip and classy. Outdoor seating is also inviting as Scottsdale quarter Is generally a nice place to hang out in. 
We had a good variety of rolls to choose from and all that we sampled tasted great and fresh - salmon, tuna, California, rainbow , shrimp tempura. The seaweed salad was very refreshing. Would certainly go back."}
{"text":"Went in at about 3pm so it was pretty quite.  The waitress was friendly and we chose to sit at the sushi bar.  The sushi chefs were polite and attentive.  The menu was pretty simple but could have explained the sushi ingredients a little better.  The miso soup was great as were the beans.  The food came quickly after we ordered and it was very good.  Defiantly up to par with other premium sushi spots around Scottsdale."}
{"text":"The sushi here is outstanding and the sushi chefs know what they are doing. They prepare everything fresh, and the happy hour menu is a big plus.

Outside of the chefs, service is lousy. The host staff spends its time flirting with customers, and ignoring the common man, and they go out of their way to butter up to the more glitzy customers who dress for success, and if you dont fit their image of the Biltmore, you are out of luck.

Stick with sitting at the sushi bar and directly relating to the chefs, and you should have no problems"}

The medical physicist at the site I worked came from L.A., so when I wanted to find a sushi place, I went up to him and he introduced me stingray.

I have been to other Sushi lounges in this area, and most of the places provides fish that had been sitting in the fridge forever (at least they smell like it) The quality of food in Stingray was not bad, as they were fresh enough. Chef's skill was alright.

Atmosphere was fine. Depending on what time and what occasion you went to that place (for dinner or for drinks), I think it is a good place to hang out.

You may need to wait for a bit in line before getting seated, but hey, I do not know how good a place can be if they are always empty seated.

I lived in Japan and California before, and I think Stingray deserves a good review in PHX area."}
{"text":"The sushi wasn't anything spectacular for the amount of money that I spent. there are a ton of more delicious sushi elsewhere for the fraction of the cost that I spent on my group of friends for dinner here. I guess you pay for location not food !"}
{"text":"These two stars are for the location and the decor inside. Clean and modern.

Service SUCKED. Our first server left us halfway through to go home, her shift had ended apparently. Shayna took over and was not attentive. I was drinking water from my husbands glass because she had never came back to fill mine.  Prices are ridiculous for the size. Go to RA on Sunday for their 2/$25 deal, better food and more options.  


FIRST AND LAST VISIT. THANKS FOR NOTHING"}
{"text":"I am so disappointed in Stingray. I have eaten and enjoyed Stingray sushi since I moved to the area 2 years ago. It has become a bit of a staple for sushi nights and happy hour gatherings. So when a special occasion arose, I ordered take out. When I got home I realized that they forgot the biggest roll I ordered, the Godzilla roll, and only gave me two sets of utensils for four people. When I called to let them know what happened, the server could not find the manager and took my number so the manager could call me back. The manager has yet to return my call! What happened to the great service at Stingray?!"}
{"text":"Service, menu and the worst spicy tuna we've ever had. Also they were out of their lobster entree. An unpleasant experience."}
{"text":"Popped in Saturday night around 6:00 & caught tail end of happy hour.  The place more than half empty, ordered drinks & sushi with a little trepidation as we've been here before & knew management supervision of staff is slack to nonexistent.  I ordered a Soporo & hot saki.  The distant bartender totally forgot the saki.  Her radar is so turned off yelling wouldn't get her attention we had to physically grab her arm when she came around the bar to talk to the hostess who was busy texting and obviously bored by the front door.   Same deal when sushi came with no Soy sauce, had to snag same off one of the tables as she was totally checked out &  again when needing more ginger and wasabe received it after much yelling and hand gestures.  The owners are probably wondering why profits aren't greater.  We went back because the food is so good but am sure many decide not to return or frequent as often when it's so obvious the staff would rather be somewhere else and this attitude can so easily be managed."}
{"text":"Love the sushi - happy hours are good - staff are generally friendly.
The only problem I have found is when ordering take out from the Scottsdale Quarter location (which I do regularly) I have experienced wrong orders/ forgetting to put sauces in the bag/ regularly forgetting to put my order of edamame in the bag... nothing major but fairly consistent !! I still keep going back tho lol ...! ;)"}
{"text":"It's lovely, comfortable and, like sushi in the Biltmore has always been, ever so slow. Our waitress was so obviously not interested in the tasks at hand that our mood was eventually affected by it too."}
{"text":"If the place is more than half empty and reeks of rotten fish and there is no host waiting to seat you shouldn't tell people who are sitting down next to the bar to go back and talk to the host to get a waitress assigned, you should just go and assign yourself. They do not deserve your money. Mediocre sushi is not worth a bitchy attitude from the waitress."}
{"text":"The WORST sushi in my life. Too undercooked sushi rice (like long-stored bad grain), not fresh,smelly and dry fish (low quality). 
What should I say more? In my dinner menu, wine was only thing I could eat."}
{"text":"I hadnt been to a stingray in a while after being continuously put off by the old town location, but tried the one in the Quarter over the weekend. Pleasantly surprised! Food was good and  the atmosphere was laid back and fun. I still feel the prices are too high for the quality, but all in all a really good experience. Staff was friendly and the manager (couldn't quite place the accent) was super helpful and very nice. And it doesnt smell like fish all the time like the OT one. Nothing worse when youre a sushi bar!  Ill be back for sure"}
{"text":"They have a great happy hour with awesome prices on food and drinks! I always sit at the sushi bar because they give you free miso soup and edamame! It's also fun to talk to the sushi chefs and ask what their favorite rolls are. Happy hour at the sushi bar is one of the best that I found and the sushi is always fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"Food was just ok. The quality of the rice was not great and the tuna was just average."}
{"text":"Well I don't have time to read all the comments, I can understand how this place can be hit or miss though.  For me it was a hit.  I recommend the Hotty Haimachi...and the fatty tuna nigri (market price for us was $19 for the 2 pieces) Cevichi Haimachi was excellent as well.  We sat outside, super nice.  Be prepared to wait for a table and once you sit the service is slow but if you know that going in it's fine....really nice wait staff.  Def try it! Enjoy."}
{"text":"love the vibes here. glad stingray came to chandler. the sushi selection around this area is subpar, stingray is going to change that! great happy hour and Sun day specials. I'm enjoying a whiskey right now. Noah and alyssa are awesome. great service! this will now be my local spot"}
{"text":"LIVE FLIES HAVE NOW BEEN ADDED TO THE BEST SUSHI IN PHOENIX! AND THEY ARE NO EXTRA CHARGE! Plus: the best dessert I've ever had in a sushi restaurant!

I went to Stingray for an early dinner on Saturday. We were seated in the main dining room. I ordered my usual plum wine and a Sapphoro Beer plus some edamame. The waitress brought everything and we noticed 2 or 3 flies trying to get to our food. We kept swatting at them in hopes that the flies would leave. I finally called the waitress over. She was wonderful as I've found all the waitresses at stringray to be. I aske for the manager. 

The table next to us and 2 other tables all heard me and they complained about having flies all over their food. The manager came out. I should have gotten his name but I was so flabbergasted by his terrible attitude tha I forgot to ask him his name. 

He disnt say he was sorry. He proceeds to tell me how stingray follows all of the legal requirements for spraying etc. Then he said: \"is summertime. This is the time of the year with lots of flies.\" I then told him that I've never been in a high class restaurant like stingray that was infested with flies all over the 5 tables with people sitting around us and our table. 

He tried to tell us that it was normal in Phoenix restaurants and that he followed all the rules and that there was nothing else he needed to do! THEN HE WALKED AWAY!!

KEEP IN MIND THAT IM NOT TALKING ABOUT ONE OR 2 FLIES!! IM TALKING ABOUT 5 TABLES WITH AT LEAST 2 OR 3+ FLIES ON EACH TABLE!!

The waitress asked us if we wanted to move...but then she sorta laughed and said there wasn't any tables without flies. I left her a 30% tip because she handled everything wonderfully with a smile under terrible circumstances! PLUS...SHE TOLD US ABOUT HER FAVORITE DESSERT. It sounded disgusting when she described it: 5 round dumplings covered with dough over ice cream. Sorta like a bon bon! THEY WERE AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS! although the person I was with only let me have one! She at the other 4!"}
{"text":"First and last time probably ever going to Stingray Serena was very unprofessional felt very neglected had to ask bartender for a simple glass of water . Messy table full of empty plates and the restaurant was empty on a Friday night (I wonder why)"}
{"text":"I had lunch with a friend at stingray this past sunday, after we figured out that most sushi places are not open until 4pm on sunday. Stingray has a trendy decor to go with a variety of trendy cocktails. One thing i have noticed about several sushi places is that they always have a plethora of specialty cocktails! At any rate, my friend and I ordered the wild salmon roll, the las vegas roll and the moto rolla. The moto rolla was absolutely my favorite! Its a cucumber wrapped roll with yellowtail, salmon and avocado. SO SO good! The las vegas roll and the wild salmon did not disappoint either. The fish itself seemed to be fresh, and the price point wasnt outrageous either. Ill definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"Stingray Sushi is at it again--being tacky, that is. Their current ad-campaign is through tasteless Romney-supporting political signs. I can't tell if I'm disgusted more by their mixing politics with food or pretending to support politics for free advertising all over the streets."}
{"text":"I really like this place, as the atmosphere is trendy and hip and the sushi is high quality. Service is almost perfect everytime, to include the very attractive wait staff, that is more than friendly... The menu offers a vast variety; however, the prices are a bit steep. Overall, I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"So I'm traveling for  business again and whenever I'm not busy with a client dinner I head for the nearest sushi bar.  This way I can eat healthfully, read my book and quietly enjoy what is always the end of a long day.  I stear clear of those huge sushi rolls, so I can't comment on any of them at Stingray - which is what they seem to be known for.  I find all of the crazy concoctions that sushi restaurants conjure up to be a waste of good fish.  I mean, what is UP with pairing fresh salmon with cream cheese (it's not lox  (smoked or cured) and a bagel for god's sake).   And to me, when you start combining too many types of fish in one roll you loose the yumminess of each one.  So when I eat sushi it's nigiri or sashimi only.  Call me a purist or unadventurous or whatever, but I like my raw fish either alone or with nothing more than good rice. and maybe shiso leaves.   At stingray everything I had was fresh and tasty:  uni, ikura, hamachi, hotate and eel.  The service was friendly and attentive in an unobrustive way so I got through two chapters of my book, two glasses of wine (wasn't in the mood for sake!) and just the right amount of sushi to put me in my happy place."}
{"text":"The sushi was disgusting. Our waitress was very rude and paid no attention to is. The raw shrimp was cleaned at all and was a gray color. Never going back again, I would never recommend anyone else to either."}
{"text":"Met a girlfriend for drinks and dinner at the bar on a Monday night recently and was surprised by the crowd at the bar. We were lucky to find a place to sit and prepared to wait when we saw the bartender was working solo. We were pleasantly surprised when Kaleb greeted us immediately, he was super friendly and took our order right away. His drinks were great and his food recommendations were spot on! We will definitely return soon for another fun night of great atmosphere, food, drinks, fun and excellent service!"}
{"text":"The most horrifyingly, disturbingly disgusting food I have eaten in my life. These good reviews are from a bunch of crazy people. We ordered the calamari (soggy, not crunchy, terrible tasting), teriyaki bento (marinated with throw-up), and the shrimp tempura bento (slivered pieces of a poor excuse of any crustacean or prawn in battered diarrhea). For anyone who expects fake, old, leftover ten years tasting Japanese food, for a stupidly, ridiculous high price, but want to go somewhere trendy; this is the place. I have a high tolerance for bad-tasting food, but this right here is............ is just nasty. Just writing this review made me gag a little. Ok, i'm done. Gonna throw up in the to-go bag and bring it back to this place. Excuse me."}
{"text":"Stingray has beautiful wooden tables, lighting, and artwork. I walked in and was met by an attentive, gracious hostess. I sat at the sushi bar and found it a bit \"cold\" in terms of set-up and ability to relate to the sushi chefs and see fish in the cases and under preparation. Music blasted so loud, it was hard to communicate to the sushi chef (who was nice). 

I tried a spicy tuna roll and asked for radish sprouts in it. I got two lonely sprouts. The roll was boring. Why is it so hard to get an interesting spicy tuna roll in Arizona? (I have lived in Los Angeles and San Francisco, which sets some of my expectations.) I also tried cucumber wrapped salmon (Fresca Roll). The rolls were cut overly large and were awkward to bite and bland in taste. I also had miso soup that was supposed to have cilantro and scallions, but did not. Too bad (for me). Edamame was complimentary.

Servers kept my water filled without my asking. Early on they, unobtrusively took away a plate. At meal end, the rest of my dishes remained even when I accepted the bill. (I didn't mind this as much as I appreciated the attentiveness to the water.)

Stingray should pay better attention to the details...cut size, sauces, herbs, toasted sesame seeds, quality wasabi...  

I was in around 9 p.m. I don't know if the kitchen had run out of herbs or what...or if folks were just tired... I was told they were open until 11 p.m.

The bathroom was nice with Toto toilets and nice fixtures. Toilet paper was too far from the toilet (should swap its position with the seat covers).

I will not likely return...I was too disappointed with the food... It's a shame as Stingray has nice ambience and good service. 

Without drinks, expect to pay at least $25-$30 per person. With drinks, expect to pay at least $35-$45."}
{"text":"Sunday Happy Hour is awesome! Sit at the sushi bar so that you can get free edamame and miso soup!"}
{"text":"Could be the worst service I've ever experienced. Ghost bartenders who disappear for 15 minutes at a time. Food also takes way too long."}
{"text":"We used to eat here all the time so we decided to have my daughter's 12th birthday here. Her and 4 of her friends came for lunch. My daughter is a vegetarian so we always get the kid's bento box with steamed tofu instead of chicken or steak. Well today they said they couldn't do it! When I asked why, they said that there is no button in their computer to ring it in! Are you kidding me?! Chicken bento sub tofu! It's as easy as that! Being in Scottsdale with all the competition, you'd think they'd be much more accommodating. I spoke to a manager and she called the owner, the owner said he would do it this one time but I quote, \"never ever again\" so I guess we will not be eating here ever again! He would rather lose a good customer than swap chicken for tofu!!! So ridiculous and very bad business...I am so disgusted! Furthermore because of this debacle, the kids' food took forever and kinda ruined the mood of the party. Thanks a lot Stingray! Very disappointed!!! I have been in the restaurant industry for years and worked for several different establishments and NEVER would any of the places I worked for be so unaccommodating and rude!"}
{"text":"Yay for happy hour and half off on cocktails! Have been back to this Stingray for a few times now, mostly for happy hours and one time for lunch, experiences were pretty consistent. Happy hour value for half off on their specialty cocktails and some sushi rolls were very nice, other tapas like crispy calamaris were just a-ok, nothing very special. Really liked the lunch bento boxes!

For some reasons, this place is always very loud, ignore the bar area, even by the inner side of the dinning room, it's still very noisy, so if you are looking for quiet place, this isn't your choice..."}
{"text":"It's not bad. But I would recommend getting there for happy hour where  prices are better and menu is ample. Can't beat $4 for a 20 oz. Sapporo Premium. People watching is very lively."}
{"text":"The worst service that you can imagine! It took them 50 minutes to get the first sushi plate. They were running behind when there were only people on 4 tables (middle of he afternoon). The least our server could have done was let us know that they were running behind - not even once!"}
{"text":"I visit Scottsdale about twice a year and always come here, it is the best sushi around! Excellent tasting Nigiri and rolls."}
{"text":"The Sunday happy hour is fantastic!! 1/2 off drinks, appetizers, and rolls. We have been to this location several times and the service is usually okay. Today, we sat on the patio and our server was the bartender and he was awesome! Good food and great service. I am so happy this is just up the street as this is the best deal around on a Sunday!!"}
{"text":"Hostess  was rude, didn't make eye contact and spoke to my party of two without making eye contact.  Servers were rushed and didn't take the time to see if we had everything we needed.  When they brought food to our table, it was dropped off without any acknowledgement.  Sushi was good, the service is poor."}
{"text":"I LOVE Stingray Sushi, so I was really thrilled to see that it had moved far closer to my father's house! It was so easy to make a reservation through Yelp and I was very pleased with our table. Their Cucumber Wrap Maki selections are so fabulous, and I really enjoyed sharing a sashimi plate with the people I came with. Also our waitress was very attentive and knowledgeable; we never found the service lacking, (she even kept returning to pour our sake in an effort to help us avoid the bad luck of pouring our own)! With such great food and service, this might become my go-to sushi place in Phoenix; now I just have to come back for their happy hour!!"}
{"text":"Awesome place!!! Everything was super fresh and very good.  We were there for happy hour so ate much more than should have. Great prices! 
Will be back for more tomorrow :)"}
{"text":"Bad service. Okay food. Good atmosphere. More show than quality. The family and I only came here since True Food Kitchen was too busy."}

In my opinion, one of the best in Old Town Scottsdale is STINGRAY.  I have been watching my weight lately - and the fact that I can get good protein and a delicious meal makes STINGRAY a standout for me.  The variety of very good, and the only reason they didn't get five stars is because the service is never quite up to par."}
{"text":"This place would have gotten more stars for ambiance and the ladies at the front desk but the food was just ok and the waitress, Bianca, seemed like she just wanted to go home. Though not new to sushi, my family and I were new to Stingray and we had questions on the menu that Bianca didn't seem eager to answer. Each question was answered with one or two words while she quickly walked away. Was it very busy?  Slightly....but that's no excuse for mediocre customer service."}
{"text":"Awful, awful, awful. By far the worst sushi and service I have ever experienced. VERY sub-par. I don't know if I went on an off night, but I don't understand what some of the other reviewers are raving about. Safeway sushi is better than this place. 

I ordered a $13 roll that had eel and crab on the inside and spicy tuna on the outside. The menu said it was CRAB, not krab or imitation crab, but the roll arrived with fake crab. For a $13 roll it better be real crab. I sent back the roll and our waiter brought the roll back with real crab. Thank goodness.

The kicker was when we received our bill and there was an extra charge for real crab. errrr....

Besides that, the tuna sashimi was not fresh tasting in the slightest and the service was slow. My boyfriend who is not picky hated everything we ordered and we ended up wasting half the things we ordered.

Lots of fake boobs and cheesy guys though if thats what you are looking for. Kill me if I ever go back there."}
{"text":"What a cool little sushi joint, right in the heart of Old Town. Went here w/ co-workers for lunch, and had an enjoyable time. I love sushi but wasn't feelin it for lunch, so I tried out their salmon bento box. I was very happy w/ my choice! Nothing like a nice, filling, healthy meal in the middle of the day. Our server was on top of everything (we had a good size group). Prices seemed decent. Glad I found a good bento box place close to the office. No complaints here."}
{"text":"When I first sat at the table, it was sticky. Sushi was just okay; not bad but nothing that I tried left me wanting to return. The service was okay."}
{"text":"I would definitely give this place more like a 4 to 5 star review for the overall ambiance... love the Biltmore area.  But if i had to rate the quality of the fish... yes I am very picky when it comes to my sushi... yeah hence  my rate of 3 stars for this place.  I love the bar and trendy cool decor.... but more for a fun bar loungy get-together than a place for authentic sushi.... regardless... I had a phenomenal time catching up with my friend:)"}
{"text":"Attractive restaurant and bar.  Bar area is great, Michael the Bar Keep was amazing! Sushi is fantastic and service is great."}
{"text":"Stopped after seeing they were open, quite good sushi, had Bento box for lunch, Cali Roll had ready crab, very tasty, I'll be back"}
{"text":"This is by far the worst service I have ever experienced at a restaurant!!! You could not pay me to ever go there again!! Do not go to this restaurant!! Especially this location!! (Horrible service/mediocre food) Read below if you would like more of an explanation..

*They make you wait 15-30 minutes for a table when there are 25 tables available. They claim it is to let the sushi chefs catch up.. But it seems very logical to seat the customer and just explain the sushi chefs are backed up and let them order drinks.. Instead of making everyone stand by the hostess table clogging up the entrance.

*Then we get to our table and our waitress is nothing but rude! She made me very uncomfortable. She was nasty to us every time we asked a question, she threw our plates down at us (which were dirty), couldn't remember which sushi rolls were which (and acted like she didn't care), wouldn't refill our drinks, and just all around talked to us like we weren't worth her time of day. (There were many other things but this is getting lengthy!)

The worst part is I knew we should have walked out when we were waiting for our table and a very upset customer came up to the front trying to find a manager and the hostess tried to ignore him! When the manager finally came over he treated the customer like he didn't care what was going on and we just trying to get him to go back to his table.

To sum it up.. I will never be returning to this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"My food gets delivered to the table next door. My bill contains charges for both sets of sushi and a \"fake\" \"wrong table\" comp that just deducts the mischarge for the double sushi. Horrible way to do business! If I could give ZERO stars, I would."}
{"text":"During our trip to Scottsdale we decided to try Stingray for lunch. The Decor was alluring. The restaurant has an interesting atmosphere. The service was just o.k. We ordered several rolls and a salmon bento lunch. Food was just o.k., the ginger dressing was not tasty the rolls did not have much flavor.  Worst of all was the stomach pain I developed. I could not have dinner that evening and the discomfort carried over to the next day. It was several days before my stomach felt normal.  Too bad, it's a cute place, I hope they can get it together and improve."}
{"text":"Downhill considerably since here a year ago. Don't waste your time. Go elsewhere. Sushi is 1/5. Drinks were so so."}
{"text":"Stingray? Try STINKRAY! The food is not fresh, at least it doesn't taste like it. The taste is more like processed cafeteria food. Anyone remember Picadilly? The flies buzzing around the restaurant and landing/vomiting on our happy hour rolls was a perfect addition to our already nasty \"treats\". If you want real sushi that's fresh and fly-free, stay away from Stinkray! Lastly, if you're thirsty, you better pack your own water because all you're offerred is one glass!

Disappointment all the way around."}
{"text":"Intimate place, dim lights and attentive  waiters.  Kiwi drink was delicious if you like fruity drinks..ordered 2 sushi rolls, they were great..place is very clean and comfortable..nice for a date.."}
{"text":"The food and drinks are always excellent and the service is consistently good. The happy hour is a great value; you can mow on a ton of food and drinks for very little money."}
{"text":"Exellent Sushi.. extensive menu.  The only reason for just four stars is the lackluster servants who look not quite professional.  If they worked on that one aspect it would be truly great sushi place."}
{"text":"Wonderful sushi, top notch. The octopus came with a sweet sauce that complimented the octopus very well. Service was prompt, the server pleasant. Didn't have any alcoholic drinks, so can't attest to the bartender's skills. Would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Been going here for a few years because of the central location, amazingly private and comfy outside seating, and fresh--if pricier--sushi and fusion options. The Cabo Blanco is by far our favorite, and even their house salad is well-crafted. But Stingray is far from our favorite sushi establishment for a few major reasons: the ambience is pretentious and menu occasionally overpriced, not atypical of the Biltmore Plaza,  but the loud music makes indoor dining impossible. Also frustrating are the wait staff--though oddly enough through no fault of their own. Management has chosen to consistently staff barely legal women, clearly meant to enhance the \"atmosphere\" and entice customers, a chauvinistic choice I can't respect and frankly find condescending. Consequently, service is hit or miss; over the years we've had a few A-list servers and some that couldn't be more apathetic, most falling somewhere around the friendly-but-aloof portion of the scale. 

Enjoy the outside couches and trendy rolls with friends while the weather is nice, but keep to your regular sushi house for everything but those few posh outings."}
{"text":"Crowded during the peak times with really slow service. Recommend off peak times, especially if you have kids like we do. Scallop Dynamite is really good and so is the King Crab tempura."}
{"text":"This is the place to be on Sunday as they have Awesome Happy hour All Day!! This means that half of their menu is half off. DRINKS here are great my personal Favorite is the KIWI COLLINS it's refreshingly delicious! I'm thirsty just thinking about it. You can also never go wrong with the bar being half off everything except wine bottles. 

Their LAS VEGAS ROLL is tasty and their Crab and Shrimp tacos are exceptional.At first I was kinda iffy but after a bite I was convinced this is what greatness tastes like. :)  IF YOUR IN THE AREA STOP BY ON A SUNDAY FOR HAPPY HOUR. 

The only reason I didn't give them a 5 star review is because during non happy hour times it can get pretty pricey. But stop by at the right time and this is the place to be!!!"}
{"text":"I was Very excited to try this place. I LOVE seafood. Me and my mother went to check it out. We are not difficult people were very layed back and open minded. But this place is A disgrace . ABSOLUTELY SHAMEFUL . Their bathroom smelled So so disgusting I didn't even want to stand in there. I went out and waited for our food. I was excited because I ordered a seafood and noodle bowl . It was described to have all kinds of delicious variations of seafood in there,  But BOY WAS I WRONG. The bowl consisted of plain broth, an Ass load of onion carrots and beansprouts ( all wich I hate) it didn't say on the menu that it was included. So I had to pick around for about 20 minutes only to find ONE tiny scallop and a third of a muscle . Never found any fish or crab or Anything else . The meal I ordered was $20 for one soup. You think it'd have alot or maybe any seafood if your gona pay $20 for a bowl of soup. Luckily our waitress was attentive and kind enough to take it off the bill. She was Great and sweet. Shes the only reason ill give it 1 star. Cus she was awesome. Other than that the hostess was wearing an extremely small mini skirt wich I find very inappropriate for a high class area. Not very classy . DO NOT reccomend."}
{"text":"Made a reservation for a party of 8 and on our way to the restaurant, I received a call from the location on scottsdale road confirming our reservation.  I explained that i was certain that i called the Biltmore location.  Once i arrived the Biltmore, they did not have a reservation and did nothing to accomodate our frustrated party of 8.  Won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"This restaurant chain is amazing. The other locations are light years better than this one. The wait staff made us wait 1hr and 30min for a appetizer and 2 kids meals.

Now, the staff is extremely uneducated. They were not educated on the contents of the menu as one of my friends ordered the tacos they had, and the tacos are appropriate as a appetizer, but not as a entree.

The kids meals are average. They were somehow out of steak and when I ordered teriyaki chicken, but it had no flavor and there were only BBQ and Honey Mustard sauces at a Asian restaurant. 

Overall, the food was bad, the service was bad, but watching people trying to  figure out where the door was is hilarious. 1 star. Bleh."}
{"text":"I'm not a sushi expert, and I rarely eat actual sushi (mostly California rolls), but my rolls were fresh and flavorful. The more adventurous at my table gave the sushi good reviews. 

However, the stars of the show are the Stingray specialty drinks. These are some of the best drinks I've had in Phoenix.  The Summer Sumo and Japanese Tease were excellent. I recommend going at happy hour as the prices are great, but get there early because only patio seating was available when we got there at 5pm on Friday. 

I would definitely recommend Stingray and will be checking out the Scottsdale location next."}
{"text":"Just came in for happy hour. Love the moto Rolla. Great way to enjoy the flavors of the yellow tail, salmon and tuna without it being overwhelmed by Rice. It's wrapped in thin cucumber. Fresh and light but plenty of flavor. Yummmmm. It beautiful in here, so much attention to detail. Especially the lighting, lovely."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere in a nice area of town - prices are pretty even with nicer sushi restaurants I've visited in any major city (in other words, a little higher than you'd typically see in a smaller town, or in a place with less attention to decor).

My friend and I shared several items, the hotty hamachi was the standout for me.  Great flavor, but not too much to overpower the fish. Seaweed salad was also good.  Can't remember the roll we had, but it was just okay.  Tuna nigiri was great, and the two orders of yellowtail nigiri we had were split - first one was great, second order wasn't as tasty (different fish I guess)."}
{"text":"NOM, NOM, NOM is all I can say! Whenever I get my sushi craving here is the spot. 

My only complaint is the way they have the tables set up here. I hate being seating next to another party and you are so close to each other that you can hear there whole conversation and yours for that matter. So, I would request a table along the wall to avoid that if you want some space."}
{"text":"When I think of Arizona, Sushi isn't necessarily the first thing that comes to mind. Was given a tip by my dad who had just happened to pass by one evening and suggest to check it out. Upon asking some locals about \"the really good sushi place downtown\" (to which no one knew the name) we were eventually led to Stingray.


 You can tell the place is super hip for Scottsdale, and coming from Chicago I can give a hats off to this place for making me forget I was actually in the middle of a town comprised almost completely of strip malls. Even though it was jam packed, happy to see that the staff went with the flow and left the 'tude at the door. Our server jokingly squeezed her way though the tight tables to take our order (which came out pretty quick!)


 Had one of the best cocktails in a while (some sort of Ginger concoction that was fizzy and buzzy, mmmm) Started out with the Calamari....holy heck...best I've ever had and could have sat and ate it for my whole meal. The seasoning wasn't necessarily asian, but you could tell that it hadn't been frozen beforehand. The sushi rolls were all excellent and we ordered way too much that neither my friend nor I could muster the bravery to finish the last one!


 Only downside was the place was kind of cramped and a bit loud...but I'm kind of a picky person when it comes to noise and won't come down on them for that."}
{"text":"I have to say when it comes to Stingrays sushi and service, they are the best. Some reviews on here talk about the price of the rolls but why on earth would you want to be eating cheap raw food? Their menu is affordable especially during happy hour and the food is awesome. My server, Bri was suggesting items to my blind date who was a sushi virgin and he loved her recommendations. Overall great atmosphere and sushi at Stingray!"}
{"text":"Typically we love it here, although this time was a little different. We decided to come on Mother's Day. We ordered our usual, my husband decided he wanted the sweet shrimp with the deep fried shrimp heads. 

Everything took forever to come out first of all. 
Our serve was ok, he never filled our waters and only checked on us one time the entire time we were there.

FINALLY the shrimp heads come out and my husband takes a bite. I'm staring at him cause he's making an uncomfortable face and looks like he is in pain. I ask him what's wrong and he asks me to remove part of a shrimp leg about half an inch long that was jammed in his gums... 

I pull it out and he's bleeding. 

The shrimp heads were very under cooked, had he swallowed that it could have been lodged in his esophagus for gods sake. 

We tell a random person since our waiter is no where to be found. He tells our waiter, our waiter comes over like 10 minutes later to ask if there was a problem. My husband repeats himself. 

Our waiter goes to grab the manager. 5 minutes later... comes back to tell us that 

The \"manager\" KATIE, is TOO busy. 

Hmm.. 

The best they could do was comp the shrimp heads.. 

That was nice and all but the manager didn't even come over to talk to us because Katie the \"manager\" was too busy. 

We would have waited. 

The plates and bowls we were given during there duration of our meal we're chipped and poorly cleaned. There was hair on our menus. 


We're frequent here because we live 3 minutes away. 

After this experience I am not too sure if that will be the case. 


Katie, the \"manager\" should never be TOO busy for a customer. 

Ridiculous. 

We could potentially sue them for this so I would assume a visit from management would be in order.

I am shocked at the lack of customer service we received today, as for the sushi and the ambience, it is always sub par but I disregard it because of happy hour prices. This is the kind of thing to make it our least favorite place to eat."}
{"text":"Middle of the road sushi place. Although, in all fairness, I'm probably not the best judge of sushi. I eat one type of roll: Spicy Tuna on Soy Paper and that's it. That being said, they have a good happy hour that last till 7pm and includes a decent amount of food too! Never had any bad service. Oh & if anyone is actually reading this: the doors are wooden & look like part of a wall. If you look closely there is a handle."}
{"text":"Horrible Customer Service,
My husband and I went with the intentions of having dinner this last Sunday, they told us it would take about 15 min. to get an outside sitting. I went to the restroom and when I returned to the front my husband was nowhere to be found... Turns out they got a table sooner than they thought and I was just standing there for about 3-4 minutes until I spotted my husband sitting outside. The front desk were too busy cheat-chatting and playing around, mind you they are all young and not very well dressed people. so nobody could tell me where he was.
I wouldn't recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"Stingray has quality sushi, and they have an awesome happy hour. If you sit at the sushi bar, you get free edamame and miso soup too! The outdoor area is nice, especially at this time of year. It is consistently busy, but not overcrowded unless it's a Friday. I've had a mix of good service and not so good, but overall it's an enjoyable experience. I always say you can judge a sushi place by its spicy tuna, and Stingray gets an A in my book."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I used to LOVE Stingray. This was a restaurant I had frequented for many years and was typically my top 3 choices to have sushi in the valley. Unfortunately over time the service started lacking, and soon the food followed. Today I went in for a late lunch/early dinner because I had my monthly Stingray craving. To my excitement they had Toro nigiri in, it is very rare they have it. Words cannot describe the foul nature that this fish presented and I almost spit it promptly out....luckily I was taught manners and did not. I told the bartender immediately that the fish was inedible and I could not have the other piece. I also told the second bartender as he cleared the plates that the fish was horrible and would not attempt the second piece. The bill comes and the Toro is still on it. When I asked the bartender why I was being charged for something I could not possibly eat he told me \"well you did eat one, which is basically like eating half a steak\" then got the manager. She said there was no way this fish was bad because their fish is flown in daily, but they would take care of part of the bill. So I was charged for my food poisoning, but only partially. Thanks guys!!! I will, fully, no longer be a patron of your establishment"}
{"text":"Just ok. Tempura batter was heavier than it should have been and we paid $9 for two prices of asparagus one small mushroom and of all things green peppers. Who tempuras green peppers! Service was lack luster for not being very busy at all. It took over 5 minutes for our server to arrive and then slow from there on out. Not much attention to detail. The bright spot was the sashimi. Nice quality and reasonable cuts for the price."}
{"text":"The Olde Towne location is flawlessly managed.  Even when busy, the staff seems to be completely on their game so much a customer is still made to feel special.  WHAT is wrong with the Scottsdale Quarter space?  It certainly has the usual Sam Fox stunning style.  The food, ONCE IT ARRIVES (!), is great too.  Why is the North Scottsdale space so lacking in good service?  I have been here three times.  Twice it wasn't busy, and I was made to feel as if my server was doing me a favor by condescending to wait on me without smiling.  The third time was at a peak weekend rush, and not only did the three different waitresses I had seem utterly confused, one actually got angry at me when I quietly asked why my appetizers hadn't  arrived after half an hour.  True Food Kitchen is also a Fox Concepts restaurant in the same shopping center, and it's perfect.  Please, Mr. Fox, fix this mess soon!"}
{"text":"I went to Stingray for a co-workers birthday and was both delighted and disappointed.

When we arrived, we told the hostess we had reservations which she confirmed. Not two minutes later did Fabio (yes, as in \"I can't believe it's not butter...SPREAD\") walked in with his homies (about the same number of people we were with), talked to the hostess, and jacked our table. Yea, I know, I'm no celebrity but it was a bad start to the celebration. We were seated about 20 min later.

Of course, our server happened to be Fabio's as well and his table took up most of her time. We waited about 10 minutes for waters and about another 15 minutes for our drinks. Now, I used to wait tables so I know this wasn't all her fault but I was surprised at the lag times. She was a super nice girl so we just brushed it off and relaxed with our drinks (which were delish!). We ordered, no problems.

Everything came out together (always a plus!) and, with the amount of sushi we got (there were 8 of us), everything was correct! Big kudos to her...I got confused just ordering it! The sushi we ordered was fresh but wasn't stellar. I wasn't expecting the most amazing sushi ever but for what we were paying, I was hoping for something a little better.

It took about 20 minutes to get the bill after we asked. And, of course, like the rest of the chicks in the place, we asked Fabio for a picture before we left. 

All in all, it was a pleasant experience. I think next time I go it will be for happy hour to get better prices. My only hiccup was the lag time on drinks...one thing I learned waiting tables was keep the drinks coming. Our server was very nice and the food was decent not earth-shattering.

of course, looking at Fabs didn't hurt either."}
{"text":"Horrible food quality four times in a row. Had been ordering from there every Sunday for the last month and every time the food has had issues. The first time the fish had bones in it... Talk about dangerous. I casually mentioned it the next time I ordered and again bones in the salmon. Again I mentioned it so that third time so they can have a manager quality control my order. This time I got not only bones in the salmon but the salmon was bad. Nothing worse than rancid fish when trying to eat sushi. On top of that they forgot to give me part of my order. Octopus sonomono with no octopus. So between the poor food quality and lack of follow through from management, I can't say is eat here again."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, once for the grand opening and once more recently.

The first time everything went pretty well and the restaurant would have received a 4 to 5 star rating.

The last time I was there was with a party of 8.  We waited 45 minutes for a table after being told the wait would be 15.  The only reason we got the table so quickly was because we asked if something had come available - our buzzers hadn't gone off and no one had come to let us know something was available.

We were put in a corner where we were quickly forgotten.  It took over an hour to get edamame and two medium sushi boats.  Once it came out we quickly ordered 3 rolls hoping they would be ready by the time the boats had finished.  An hour later they arrived.  An hour for three rolls.  In all we spent 3 hours at Stingray and probably 30 minutes eating.  The other 2.5 hours were spent waiting.  

The restaurant is nice and the sushi is good but the service was so poor that I would not go back.

Oh, and when the waitress finally showed up with the check she told us, out loud, that since we were a part of more than 6 (I think) that an 18% gratuity was included automatically.  That was a bit audacious.  Maybe she was just clarifying the bill but after her terrible service she is lucky that stop-loss policy is in place or her tip would have been tiny."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the food here. Seaweed salad was awful. The shrimp tempura roll was lacking shrimp and i couldn't
Quite tell what else was in the roll. I left the whole bowl of seaweed salad as it was not edible. Waitress never asked how my lunch was."}
{"text":"I've been here several times in the past and always had a good time. Sat at the bar once or twice, but mostly sat on the patio, which has a nice relaxing atmosphere, and is a great place to people watch (especially on a nice fall day). 

The sushi itself wasn't half bad (although I've had better), and the service could be a bit more attentive out on the patio, but all in all, a nice little joint, right on Scottsdale Road that i've always had a good time at."}
{"text":"This is a great place.  Good atmosphere, good food, decent prices, and friendly people. It's not the best sushi in Ahwatukee (Ginban is still number 1) but if you're in the area, this is a great place with chefs who know what they're doing and offer some creative options."}
{"text":"First time going to stingray.... When i walked in I was nicely greeted and sat right away. I came in for lunch at 2 on a Monday. I snared doe thing quick so I just ordered the buckwheat soba noodles which are pretty hard to mess up so my expectations were met.

The soba came very fast and my waitress was so nice. That being said I didn't try any of the sushi or anything, but since i am vegan and I don't eat fish or meats I can't speak for those people. But for anyone who is vegan there is actually a lot of options: noodles, soups, edamame, salads, and they have a veggie roll which you also probably specialize a roll of you asked. Overall great!"}
{"text":"The food is all right but it's not that impressive.  The restaurant is more like a bar with a fairly cozy ambiance.  The menu is good and the price is reasonable.  They have the usual specialty rolls like Dragon and Godzilla rolls.  The a la cart ones are what you normally expect from other nice Japanese restaurants."}
{"text":"First off, I came in expecting quite a bit from this place since I've been to the Scottsdale Quarter location as not only very impressed with the menu, but also with the service. This location definitely has the same name and menu but much different service.

I was seated quickly and had my drink order taken. Then after about 10-15 minutes, I realize that we haven't seen our waitress forever. We flag down another waitress only to find out that she is our server now. We would easily go 10 minutes in between seeing her. Not like there was a shortage of workers considering there were almost as many waitresses as there were customers. After 15 minutes of waiting for my dessert, I flag the waitress down again and ask about my dessert only to find out she forgot. She just went and got it and went on with business like nothing happened. I was definitely getting the vibe that she wasn't interested in earning much in tips that night so I was happy to oblige her. We didn't even get acknowledged by her as we walked right past her when leaving. 

Only reason this place doesn't get one star is because their happy hour menu is amazing. With that said....go to a different location!!! This place won't see any of my business ever again."}
{"text":"I've am a regular.  The food is always delicious, fresh, and the presentations are cool. Love the atmosphere.  Always great service and the specialty drinks rock!!! I love this place and my friends love it. Also love the happy hour specials. Also I've noticed the most uppity customers are the main ones who complain on these reviews.  You guys are awesome. Loved my server ashley!"}
{"text":"Sakana Sushi on Elliot and Priest,  Mello Mushroom (pizza experience) are also other great places to go where you can hear yourself think while enjoying good food!"}
{"text":"Went on a bright and sunny Saturday, all the patio windows were closed & only one guy at the bar. Asked if they could open the windows, \"no, can't, it might rain.\" Ok. Asked to make sure they were showing the Kentucky Derby race, \"no, management won't let me change the channel.\" Really? Sad customer service, unfriendly staff, didn't stick around to meet the \"management\" Good location but unfortunately not an inviting feel."}
{"text":"We've eaten here a few times over the years and never received a decent service, but the most recent was the straw that broke the camel's back.

We initially wanted to eat a Sushi A Go Go across the street but they were jammed without an open table at 4:00pm on a Sunday.  So we decided to settle for Stingray.  We walked in and the place was nearly empty.  The hostess was busy seating a family which was taking minutes for some reason so we decided to walk into the bar area.  We walked past the bartender and asked if we could take a seat at one of the tables.  He said sure no problem let me grab a server for you.  So we waited for five minutes with out any service while the bartender and 4 servers casually chatted behind the bar.  So we decided to take our money and our appetites elsewhere.  When we were walking out they didn't even care they just said \"Have a goodnight.\"  If I was management I would have fired someone on the spot."}
{"text":"We went here on NYE as our beloved Hana Sushi was closed. Figured we'd give a new place a try. We had some pros and cons at stingray. Pros: they have good sushi chefs, I LOVED my octopus salad and would go back just for that, and the happy hour prices are unbeatable! The Cons I would say is that I feel like this restaurant wants to be a club. It's a little bit of a weird vibe in that way. The service is a little spotty but they did make up for it by being really friendly. We would probably HH here agan."}
{"text":"Sushi places are a dime a dozen in this town, and in my mission to try them all, I met a friend at Stingray for happy hour.  The food was decent.  I've certainly had better.  The las vegas roll was a little heavy on the rice and tempura.  The drinks were exceptionally good.  I had the asian blonde, which is lychee and champagne, can't go wrong there.  My friend's drink was something with raspberries and rose water.  It was amazing.  All that being said, the service was awful.  Once our food was delivered our waitress disappeared.  I got one refill on my water, and considering that I drink water like its going out of style, this is completely unacceptable.  My empty glass sat on the edge of the table for the remainder of dinner.  Once we were done eating, we couldn't get the bill, as our waitress was still missing.  Some 20+ minutes after we were completely done eating she appeared again, and we requested the bill.  Once the bill arrived, it took the waitress an additional 15 to 20 minutes to come pick it up.  It was taking so long that I actually held the bill and credit cards up and out past the edge of the table, hoping someone passing by would offer to take it, or atleast offer to send our waitress over. Busboys went by, the hostess went by several times, other waitresses went by,  the manager even went by, and they all pretended like they didn't see me holding the bill.  I've never had such a difficult time trying to get someone to take my money; it was truly infuriating.  Stingray is definitely getting crossed off my list.  I don't have time for bad service."}
{"text":"I love their sushi! We are always able to be seated right away when we walk in. The fish is so fresh and I love that they give you complementary edamame and miso when you sit at the sushi bar. They also have cooked food options for those who don't/can't eat raw fish. They do take reservations, unfortunately it's only for parties of 6 or more."}
{"text":"I've been to their Scottsdale location many times in the past. Last night was my first trip to the Biltmore location. The atmosphere is nice but the service from the bar and their servers was beyond sub par. 
Upon entering and after being greeted by the hostesses we hit the bar while waiting for our table. Ordered drinks and waited nearly fifteen minutes to get our beers. Yes, fifteen minutes for two bottles of beer. This was the beginning of a very unfulfilled eve. We were seated at our table and sat for near twenty minutes before being greeted by our waiter. We ordered appetizers and when they came out to the table half of our parties food had been forgotten about. This would be semi acceptable if we were a large party or if the restaurant was flooded with people. This was not the case however. We were a party of four and our server had only four other tables on the patio. We finally got our apps and ordered entrées and another round of drinks. Our drinks reached the table after our meal was delivered and we had to remind our server about them. For the third round we merely had to wait 18 minutes. Nothing ever got pre-bussed either. When our bill came we literally had 6 empty bottles, and 2 empty martini glasses pushed to the edge of the table along with all our empty dishes stacked on top of each other. Usually we would order dessert or more drinks but due to the lack of attention and feeling ignored by the waiter we called it a night. 

I've been serving tables here in the valley for about six years now. If I were to treat any of my customers the way that we were treated last night I would have been canned instantly. Also I know that if it were my place, I would want to know if my guests were being treated correctly. I will not be going back to this Biltmore spot anytime in the future."}
{"text":"I never review anything, but I have to after my experience last night. I use to enjoy going for sushi at the Biltmore Stingray Sushi, but something has happened. The portions were small, very overpriced, and of bad quality. I ordered two rolls, but after the first, I cancelled the other order. Thankfully, the waiter was able to comp the roll I ate (if you could even call it that, 5 pieces), and I left. I don't know if they got new management, owners, or what. Usually the place is pretty busy, but not now. I think the word is out. Stingray Sushi is not good. I'm never going back. I would suggest no one eat there."}
{"text":"Stingray is definitely the go to place for sushi for a weekend night out. The prices are just right with an atmosphere that makes up for the occasional highly priced entrées (which are delicious.) But, they could give there almost all girl waitress and hostess staff a facelift (pun intended, scottsdale joke) to help address that they should leave there negative emotions at home and not at work. Plenty of issues regarding the service and timely manner of the servers.

Overall, always a regular choice by myself and the guys to grab a quick bite at the sushi bar to enjoy some well made sushi."}
{"text":"I have visited twice here during happy hour a will absolutely return. We had two spicy rolls (yellowtail and tuna), salmon and yellowtail nigiri, and a dragon roll with a sake bomb and mixed drink and our tab was only $35!! What a steal. The sushi was great only complaint was the spicy rolls did look a bit sloppy. My wife loved her Tokyo Stock Exchange (mixed drink with vodka  ginger basil and lime). Service was attentive but defiantly did not seem thrilled in any sense to be at work. Will definitely return for happy hour when I'm in the mood for some good cheap sushi and drinks!!"}
{"text":"Food was alright, atmosphere was amazing. The decor was great, but im here to eat good food and great service not look pay premium price for decor.

We were put in front of a sushi chef and he didnt even talk to us unless it was to take our order. All the girls would be hanging out with him and not servicing other people. I've been at  sushi bar in california many of times and had such a ball with the sushi chef. They would talk to us, provide outstanding service and food for us but this place sucked at that. 

My boyfriend wanted to order something from the kitchen and I was almost done eating until I got fed up and told the chef what I wanted to order from the kitchen. (From my understanding, the kitchen order will be made through the servers, thats what she said anyways). We finished our food  and waited a long while and I AGAIN had to ask our sushi chef to get someone to help us. (I KNOW HES GOOD LOOKING BUT YOU GUYS NEED TO DO YOUR JOB INSTEAD OF FLIRTING WITH HIM!)

ALL IN ALL:

PROS: Great decor

Cons: OKAY sushi for premium price
Servers like to flirt with the sushi chef instead of helping customers
Sushi chef doesnt like talking to the customers, instead he likes to flirt with the good looking girls there (we running a sushi hooters now?)
Salty ass miso soup

Would I come here again? No."}
{"text":"If you want pretty average sushi with pretty average service, this is your place."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for awhile since I always drive by it on Scottsdale. Finally made it there with a girlfriend on Saturday night.  

The service and ambiance were great, however the sushi was only mediocre.  First we had edamame, which was fine, it's pretty hard to mess that up! We then split the ungi roll and and the Stingray roll (which I think is  their signature roll because it was one of the most expensive).  The eel roll was good but the Stingray roll was way too spicy and nothing to write home about.  I have never gone out to sushi and had pieces left over, but we definitely did not finish the Stingray roll.   


Anyways, Stingray seems like it would be a good place for  Happy Hour (it always looks happening when I drive by it during that time) but I wouldn't go here again for a sit down dinner. Stingray does have location on it's side though...... After dinner, the bars were just a few blocks away!"}
{"text":"I like Stingray.  The fish is always fresh and yummy when I go.  Then again I have been told I am a purist - no cream cheese and deep fried rolls for me."}
{"text":"This is my second time at this location.  I must say I really like the one on Scottsdale road better.  The sushi was okay.  It was fresh but there was something missing.  I get the same rolls at the other location and the fish just melts in your mouth.  I think it has something to do with the way its cut and not necessarily due to the freshness.  My usual rolls:  motto rolla, summertime roll, hamachi with scallions, and the eel avocado roll.  Sometimes, I get the lollipop roll or the hotty hamachi too.  Yum"}
{"text":"The food is good, the service is hit and miss. They have a good happy hour and its nice to hangout on the patio and listen to music. I love the drink with the watermelon balls, it was no longer on the menu, but I asked for it and they made it. The huge crab legs were delicious! Located at the Biltmore. Parking hasn't been a problem when we've gone."}
{"text":"5 star for it's prices for happy hour and 4 stars for sashimi (not discounted on happy hour). 1 star for servers. I've gone there twice with other folks and we got tables really quickly but out server was MIA. I ended up giving their tips to the sushi chefs, which are more deserving since they're really doing all the work. From the servers, I get a glass of water if I'm lucky. 3.5 star quality for AZ. Prob avg for SoCal but we ain't in Kansas anymore, Dorothy. Management, please hire more servers or just have it like those places you go to the counter to order and you grab your own drinks at a fountain."}
{"text":"Had the Tuna and salmon sashimi, Dragon roll, Vegas roll all were very fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Sunday night and there are only a few options in the middle of the desert for sushi after 8 pm, so it is off to stingray biltmore we go. I give these guys 3 stars because the sushi is good, it is just entirely overpriced...2 rolls for just shy of 30 bucks is ri-donk! The morning dew roll is actually quite delicious...I won't harp on the fact that it is overpriced because I already said that, but if me and my girl can't get out of a sushi joint (with no drinks) for under a Benjamin Franklin then I'm gonna be a little sad about it. Anyway not great, not bad, not cheap. Next time I want a bag of those jellies they give you with the check and maybe I won't cry so much."}
{"text":"I never write negative reviews, but it's finally time. I have visited this Stingray at least a dozen times and something has always gone wrong. The food is spectacular but the service is as bad as it gets. Today was my last straw and I will not be going back. I called to make a reservation for 8 people for tomorrow, New Years Day. This is a guaranteed minimum of $400 bill. They told me they take reservations for parties over 6. Great. After being on hold for at least 5 minutes, someone else came back on the phone and said they were not taking reservations on this day. I asked if there was a reason they would turn away 8 people. If it was a matter of giving them a credit card to insure we showed up, I was happy to do so. The girl on the phone was less than educated or polite. No worries. I called Sushi Brokers down the street and they were happy to take my reservation. Looks like I found my new spot."}
{"text":"I'm so tired of their awful service!

We went there on a Sunday afternoon at 2:30pm, so not at a prime time at all.  The restaurant was empty  yet it takes them over a half an hour to bring us our food.  We were a party of 2, ordered a caterpillar roll and a sushi plate.  A party of 3 came to the restaurant about 10 minutes after we arrived and and they received their food before we did.  This seems to be my experience every time we go there and I'm just tired of it.  It's no wonder the restaurant is empty every time we go there.  Your service is awful!!  I'm tired of it!  I will never go back there again."}
{"text":"I had good luck here service-wise. Atmosphere is very modern. My favorite is the thinly sliced bluefin tuna with equally thinly sliced raw jalopenos."}
{"text":"Two years ago it was ok. A year ago it was declining. Had a table for eight last night and it became a comedy of poor service and barely average sushi. We sat near the door and watched four groups give up and leave because of the wait while there were many open tables. Add that it took 20 minutes to get the first drink and it was wrong and the hits just kept coming. 

Sad because the qtr is great place to go but I'll go to Sushi Brokers for sushi from now on."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi places around. There isn't a bad roll on the menu. Great atmosphere, great service. Doesn't send off the typical Scottsdale \"douchey vibe.\" A bit pricey, but you get what you pay for it."}
{"text":"The first time I went was not good.  They seem to have found their stride, however, and that is water under the bridge.

One of the best happy hour menus around, for real for real.  The prices are great and the selection is good.  It is ALWAYS very busy during happy hour, but don't even bother on Fridays.  It's jam-packed with tarted up Scottsdale flotsam and the servers are frazzled beyond belief and prone to forgetting your drinks.  

Everything here is good, except for the crunchy spicy tuna roll, which seems to be a Stingray original.  And it is original...but strange, and a big fail in my opinion.  The moto-rolla (or something like that) roll is BEYOND. JUST BEYOND. I think about it wistfully at least once a week.  

Service depends...I almost always have the same girl, and she is the best waitress in the world.  Wish I could remember her name.  Badass Asian chick.  All of the other servers I have had have forgotten items and generally kind of sucked.

Oh and the interior is pretty cool.  I am mesmerized by the huge silver fish behind the bar."}
{"text":"I loved their happy hour deals. The Vegas and Dragon rolls were pretty good!"}
{"text":"I don't think I've ever eaten at a worse sushi restaurant than this. 

We decided to sit outside as it was a nice day, but all of the plates were dirty on the table. We thought maybe it had something to do with sitting outside and the wind and asked for new plates and were brought a second set of dirty dishes. 

Then we ordered a selection of the cucumber rolls (the ones that use cucumber on the outside instead of seaweed). What a mistake! I mean, you can really taste the fish when their is no rice. The tuna was so awful and I am not sure how to describe it. It wasn't super fishy it just had this taste like it had gone bad. I am getting upset just thinking about it.

Finally, the very worst part was the service. In a 2+ hour period we were maybe able to get a drink refill once and never able to order or get the check in a timely manner. 

I have no idea how this place is still open. Don't eat here."}
{"text":"Ate 2 Philly rolls and a Vegas roll, both of these items made my wife and I sick.

Called and complained, to the manager of the restaurant who was very uncaring in her demeanor and claims that no one else called in a complaint today. We will never eat here again. 

AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went there on Sunday for the first time. The place was nice and clean everyone was friendly. We at in the patio by the way every Sunday they have Happy hour all day on food and beverages, I love the food and our server Sariah was really nice. My new sushi place"}
{"text":"TERRIBLE SERVICE!! 
As a frequent customer I was very disappointed with the service tonight March 8th 2013 at the Biltmore Stingray. When we arrived we were told a 45 minutes wait. After 45 minutes we were told that were first on the waiting list and that there was 15 more mins of waiting. As we waited another 15 minutes, they failed to seat us and told us another time that we were actually second on the waiting list. The hostesses not only lied to us but told us we were to wait another 20 minutes. I was in disbelief that I was told one thing  and then another 15 minutes later."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi places in Arizona.  The food and drinks are always amazing, and the decor is really pleasant in addition to comfortable seating.  It is a bit pricey but for being in the Biltmore area it's to be expected.  This location is 100% better than the Scottsdale Rd location in every way.  Both locations are open pretty late which is always great for late night dinner and drinks.

The Las Vegas Roll here is the best I've had at any sushi restaurant ever.

The only reason I'm deducting 1 star is because the price is a little expensive (in my opinion)."}
{"text":"Overall was just too pricey for the experience. Little thing added up to upset me. No reservations, cramped dinner experience, no split checks. Service is good but not great. The happy hour is decent, but again there are other places I would go to first. I like to sit outside when the weather permits but if you sit outside here you will be sitting next to one of the busiest roads in Arizona and it smells like car exhaust. Not highly recommended."}
{"text":"Thursday evening went in for dinner. Waited ten minutes, no waitress, no water. Some people were being served but other tables like ours got no service. This was my second time going to this place, I don't recommend it and I probably won't go again"}
{"text":"Sticky tables, loud, mediocre food for the price, decent saki selection bumped it to 2 stars.  Look for better."}
{"text":"I went here on a wednesday night and it was packed. I was surprised yet our service was pretty decent considering the crowd. sushi was not bad, a little over priced but what can you expect--sushi in scottsdale."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the atmosphere.  The crispy, spicy, tuna roll was unusual and yummy."}
{"text":"First timers in our group and at least 2 or the 3 of us will not be back.  We (two of us) arrived to the table our friend had already been seated at to hear the manager, I presume, say to her \"You're having a great time, just by yourself, aren't you?\" as he placed the appetizer she had ordered on the table.  After announcing ourselves, we sat and soon after the server, Beth, came to the table.  Honestly, I had to check my receipt for her name because she never told it to us.  Since we didn't know our drink order right away, we agreed she would return for it.  At least 10 minutes later, she returns for what turned out to be our simple beer order.  After we had selected our sushi choices for our meal, Beth verbally ran through the choices.  After explaining that the rolls will all come out as they are prepared so we are not waiting, our friend asks if the Mango Tango selection can be put on a separate plate as she is allergic to mangoes.  After clear confusion on the face of Beth, she stutters out \"I think we can do that.\"  We were thrown by her confusion.  As our first plate of rolls arrived, delivered by someone other than our server, we had no wasabi and no small dishes for our sauce on the table.  The soy sauce pitcher on our table was almost empty as was the one on the table next to us.  After about 10 minutes, Beth arrives to check on how our rolls \"taste\" and we inform her that we hadn't had any due to lack of wasabi and dishes.  Beth leaves to get those items for us and tell us to \"get started\" with the small amount of soy sauce we had left in our pitcher.  The Mango Tango dish arrives and Beth's confusion was answered: the mango was on the side.  She had apparently thought we were requesting for the mango to be in the side instead of the meal on a separate plate from the rolls.  After our meal was finished and we were chatting and enjoying our company, drinking our beverages, Beth arrives and places the bill on the table, telling us she will pick it up whenever we are ready.  No mention of coffee or dessert.  When we hadn't touched the check for 10 minutes, Beth checks in to see if it's \"ready.\"  When we told her we hadn't even looked at it yet, she says \"If you would like to hang out and order anything else, I can have another server assist you.  I have been here since 10 and would like to close out your check.\"  It was 9pm.  After the looks on our faces expressed our disappointment with her attitude, she attempted to back peddle and essentially ended up repeating herself and thus, sticking her foot back in her mouth.  Not to be insensitive at all, I, myself have been a server and a bartender in the past and I am all too familiar with \"pulling a double.\"  And I have been stuck at work because of that last table that consisted of people not going anywhere.  It wasn't that she wanted to leave, it was the way she told us.  I had just worked a full day myself and was about to do it again the next day, in the midst of a 3 week straight work schedule with 0 days off.  Once we paid our bill, cash and card combo that again confused Beth, we added our gratuity and our meal was complete.  But not before Beth checked her tip while still very much in our range of vision.  Oh, and the sushi?  Mediocre at best and not worth going back!"}
{"text":"This place is going downhill, the sushi here is not fresh even though the manager said so.  I ordered the Sashimi dinner and my tuna doesn't look fresh and it doesn't taste fresh either, wifey didn't even finish her Sushi...what a waste!

We paid 60 dollars for lunch...NOT WORTH IT!!!

Not coming back here anymore!"}
{"text":"Good spot for lunch or happy hour...but if you can't make it when they are having a special, the menu sushi is overpriced.  It's a step between grocery store sushi and great restaurant sushi, but it cost way more.  On a good note, the service is great and they validate parking for up to 2hrs. The lunch bento boxes are the best bang for your buck."}
{"text":"This is a review of Happy Hour (runs from 3-7) at Stingray in Old Town.
A really good experience with and easy on the wallet to boot!
A number of great choices and some really good drink specials.  We had the Gyoza (pot stickers), shrimp shumai, dragon roll and the Las Vegas roll.
We were seated on the patio, which was a nice high top overlooking Scottsdale road.
Service was very good.  The gyoza and shumai were a good appetizer size.  The sushi rolls were good, but I would say great.  The happy hour pricing still puts the whole experience at a solid value.
I would go back for Happy Hour again!"}
{"text":"The sushi is tasty and they make a nice miso soup.  Happy hour has some good deals and a fun comfortable atmosphere."}
{"text":"My wife and I love stingray sushi. We usually go to the Scottsdale quarter location. The food is also good here, but the bathrooms are designed quite oddly. Service was prompt and pleasant."}
{"text":"While staying in AZ we came upon this restaurant and very glad we did!  The food was amazing!  The place was quiet so we decided to sit at the bar.  The bartender was an amazing young guy (Kyle ?) very funny and made the most amazing drinks!  We had the best time that night.  Next time I will make a point of going there again for dinner. Wouldn't change a thing and loved the fact the bartender was so attentive!  I give this place 5 stars and can't wait to visit again. Thanks for the great meal, amazing drinks and a place that I felt comfortable and completely pampered!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to Stingray before, never super impressed, but was decent.. Not going back after my recent experience. The roll I ordered had to be sent back, and I didn't get a new roll until my friend was done eating. The new roll was all rice and hardly any fish. Then, we were given the bill of the people next to us - who had already left and paid our bill. We were told management would take money off the bill to make it more like what our bill would have been. I then asked for change for a larger bill to pay my friend for my share of the bill, and when I got outside I discovered I was given less money back for the larger bill. My over priced white rice dinner got even more expensive! I could have spent less at Whole Foods for a sushi roll with seven times as much fish."}
{"text":"Great location and ambiance but that is where the good ends. Sushi is just plain bad. Let's starts with the rice, not up to par for the price point. The quality of the fish is very bad, frankly I was surprised how poor considering a rather premium price point. Drinks are ok but nothing unique or special. We are in the desert but there are much better options."}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour! 1/2 price: Drafts, Specialty Drinks, glasses of wine, \"house\" sushi rolls, and apps.  7 days a week (2:30-6:30pm) & all day Sunday.  Great service and good food - if paying the happy hour prices...Not sure it's worth it if paying full price."}
{"text":"Stingray has good sushi and a good happy hour but their ambiance, policies and customer service are terrible. 

I want to eat dinner and chat with my friends. It is a restaurant. NOT a dance club! I can't stress this enough, if you don't want to have to shout over the annoying and VERY loud music being played by a DJ, then you better eat elsewhere. A DJ?? Again it's a restaurant, not a club on Mill Ave. When I asked the manager to please turn down the music a bit I was basically told to leave if I didn't like it. Apparently the owners want to appeal only to a young hipster crowd. That's fine, I have plenty more disposable income to spend than those kids. And I am going to spend it elsewhere. 

Get this, they refuse to split a bill if you are sitting at a table. How difficult is it to split the bill? Any other restaurant I have ever eaten at has never had a problem splitting a bill. So if you go with a a group of coworkers for happy hour, one of you better be ready to pay the whole bill. Btw, if you sit at the bar they can split the bill. So why not at a table. Makes no sense and ridiculous.

Finally, some of their waitstaff including a young female bartender are condescending and rude. I was actually told by the bartender that \"I don't know, I just work here\". Wow that is some customer service training they had. 

If you want great sushi, service and want to hear yourself think then go to Sakana or Sushi Eye."}
{"text":"If you are expecting a small traditional Japanese sushi house ... this is not that.  Which is fine.  It's a large bar-oriented place that is Asian themed.  I started with Hamachi sashimi and Tuna Tataki.  It started fine ... usually a good sign when the ginger is not dyed pink.  The Hamachi delivered! Nicely cut and presented, very tasty and nice texture.  However, the tuna tataki was the worst I've ever had. While I realize that there is room for creative interpretation .... my general expectation is some type of raw diced or thinly sliced tuna ... sometimes with a creative garnish like radish or jalepeno, and then served in some type of ponzu sauce.  This was not that.  It was cold seared ahi tuna (cooked) served in a very bland sauce ... and it cost $16 and was featured as one of their \"specialties\".

The rolls that followed were ok.  Rice did not stand out in any way ... cool and moist, no great texture or ambiance.  

Service was good.

Bottom line is a 2.5."}
{"text":"While in Arizona I was told by a vast amount of people to eat at Stingray sushi and to my surprise sushi exceeded my expectations! I eat sushi twice a week and out of all the places I have enjoyed eating sushi I will definitely say Stingray sushi is one of the best!"}
{"text":"I got take out; two avocado rolls, and a veggie roll. All three rolls were falling apart, and were small portions. So much so that we had to make a second dinner (my boyfriend and I are both small, so this is quite odd). The avocado rolls didn't taste right. How do you mess up avocado and rice? I mean really, especially a place that's hyped up like Stingray Sushi at the *Biltmore*. No thanks, I definitely won't be going back. The quality was disgusting for the prices and location."}
{"text":"On the recommendation of a friend we decided to try Stingray Sushi. I was told the food was excellent and the atmosphere was great. Well.. I now know not to take sushi advise from her anymore... LOL.... The place was built up so good I was expecting to have a great experience and was sorely let down. My wife and I went for lunch after the gym on a Sunday (approx 12:30pm). The restaurant was not crowded, however it was either understaffed, or the people were new; either way service was substandard by any gauge. We were sat down in our booth, given menus, then we didn't see a waiter for 15 minutes. Once he got to our table, he only took our drink order (2 waters), and then we did not see him again for 15 minutes. This is not an exaggeration... 30 minutes and our order was not even taken yet. 

We were going to leave, but we were told that the food was to die for. Well.. I can tell you that its not... Our order came out in the appropriate amount of time and we dug in... California roll, a little small, but standard. Rainbow roll was ok... nothing to write home about.. The two specialty roles we ordered, the Las Vegas roll, and Scallop dynamite were barely edible. The scallops in the scallop dynamite were rubbery. Definitely overcooked, and it had a fondu on top of it with mushrooms. The scallops pulled right out of the mixture and had minimal flavor. Better to be over cooked than under right? On the opposite end, the Las Vegas role was under cooked. Unlike other places they deep fry the role, however the batter was barely tan. After a few bites we decided to leave that one alone. 

The good part of the experience was the atmosphere was nice, the patio looked like a great place to have an adult beverage. The Asian fusion decor fit the restaurant. The happy hour pricing was good, however items not on happy hour got OUTRAGEOUS. They had many specialty roles over $20.00 each. The bathroom was clean and modern, however there were no towel in the mens room. 

To top off the afternoon, the edamame we ordered never came, and our glasses were empty after the first refill. With all the good sushi places within 5 miles (RA, KOBE, Sakana, just to name a few), I am surprised this place is able to compete. Needless to say this is my last visit to Stingray and I need to show my friends what a great sushi experience is supposed to be."}
{"text":"I usually go to Sting Ray Sushi once or twice a month for their happy hour. The sushi is always fresh and the servers have always been really friendly. Sometimes the wait for food can be long and the rolls don't always come out at the same time. Their cabo blanco roll is one of my favorites!"}
{"text":"Ate at this place last night...Miso soup was good....Vegi Noodle dish in beef broth was horrible....this place is way over priced...I will not go back again."}
{"text":"went there for happy hour. the sushi was ok, but nothing to write home about and that's basically my position on everything else. the other thing, parking is a nightmare there."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend she got sick with spoiled salmon. Never coming back place looks dirty.."}
{"text":"I give Stingray two stars purely for the fact there food is cheap and edible during happy hour.  Service was bad (which seems to be the trend in their reviews) nothing special about their menu and very little to chose from. We were craving toro but they were out. I'd have to say their sushi was worse than RA. I'll most likely never go back unless with a group. Limited selection, poor service, long wait time and over priced drinks.  The end."}
{"text":"I would never bring my mother here.  I might bring my grandmother.  My mother loves Japanese food.  So do I.  My grandmother is 92 years old.  Chocolate cake is just okay."}
{"text":"Place was clean and hostess was nice.

Food is low end quality. 
No Draft Beer (very strange)
Bottle Beer was pretty expensive considering the low quality food
Service was slow (drinks took about 10+ minutes)

Server was nice but she wouldn't split our checks even though we let her know prior to ordering. 

We won't coming back."}
{"text":"The sushi here was great! The yellowtail sashimi was excellent - morning dew roll was exceptional. Service was a little slow and prices a little steep but overall an amazing place to eat when shopping at biltmore"}
{"text":"Food is not authentic. Seems like they put more thought into the atmosphere then the actual food. The staff seemed inexperienced."}
{"text":"The food is fresh and well made, the atmosphere is okay, but reminiscent of a Scottsdale nightclub, and the prices are quite high. 3 rolls and 4 orders of nigiri was $96 with tax and tip. No drinks, just water. 

Same food with better prices can be found elsewhere.

Side note - 10 minute wait with half the tables empty. WTH."}
{"text":"WORST SUSHI I'VE EVER HAD!

Yellowtail Sashimi was served like Nigiri without the rice- pieces of fish waaaayyy too thick-
Wasabi was dry and flavorless- completely NOT fresh-
Dragon Roll was nothing more than crab mix w/ Unagi and avocado on top- LAME!- and overpriced

Lost our name on the seating list and was sooooo not worth the wait-
When complained to the manager he made it seem like our fault that the sushi was so terrible!  I thought the customer was always right...

The only thing this place has going for it is location and stupid local Scottsdale yuppies that can't tell the different between fresh, quality fish and garbage!!!!!

EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING"}
{"text":"I've eaten sushi in a bunch of different locations and this place is not all it is worked up to be, yep you're right it is located in the Biltmore Fashion Square where I expect higher quality cuisine.

The prices are the only things that agree with the location (they are on the high side). The sushi does not taste as fresh as I am accustomed too. Our tables were not clean and the restroom was filthy i.e used paper on the floor, water everywhere and it stunk like a fresh pile. 

The were two silver linings are the green tea \"it was business\", I will give that to them. And the customer service was good as well."}
{"text":"We used to like this place but we won't be back :( 
This was the second time they were out of lobster tacos. Tonight they were out of three different items we attempted to order! 
The server was new but good. But the kitchen kept messing up- we didn't get our apps til after we got our sushi! The last thing we got was the edamame! That's the easiest and last!?!? How do you mess up edamame? 
Next time we will just go try a new place or go to a different favorite place :("}
{"text":"Yummy yum yum. Excellent sashimi done right with no frills. Speaks for itself.  Ask for Melissa."}
{"text":"It's just ok for Sushi. Many of my dishes seemed to be made with imitation  crab... Service was just ok. Nothing special or over the top about the place."}
{"text":"First of all, I'm tired of restaurants that play thumping music in the background and put a pair of cleavage cuties at the host stand to mask the weak food and marginal service.  And then have servers that appear to have never left Arizona but are experts in sushi and Japanese cuisine.  I realize that they're not a real \"Japanese\" restaurant, but nevertheless...

Bar staff was mediocre.  I sat there with little attention.  Food is nothing to write home about; nothing I had really stands out and it didn't seem the staff had any convincing recommendations.  It's not outrageously expensive, but it could get a bit pricey depending on how you order.  I suppose if you're here for a trendy snack before heading out dancing, it might fit, but if you actually want a meal, I wouldn't recommend it.

To top my meal off, I had a dry, flaky, not-so-tasty dessert that looked like an afterthought.  I realize desserts are the big margin item at a restaurant, but for $7, I would have liked it to look better put together.

Skip this one.  Especially at this location.  If you want the scene, go to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I am addicted to Stingray. The sushi here never fails and the happy hour is incredible. Maybe I'm a bit biased because all of my favorite rolls are on the HH menu, but shoot 2 people getting stuffed for under $20 is legit! Reading through other reviews I see that Stingray has lost a couple stars due to the service. I would say don't let that discourage you from coming in! I've experienced it myself... the only time I get amazing service is when my old roomie is working or when I go in to eat with her. But when she's not around I always find the hostess to be awkward and the servers to be very inattentive! One time our server never came to our table so we had to refill our water glasses with our son's baby water.... yeah pretty annoying, but i'll risk having a bad server for amazing sushi."}
{"text":"I felt very compelled to write an update and give stingray an extra star! So I went against my own advice... I came here on a friday, after five, during happy hour, with a stroller. But, I couldn't help myself! We were in the area and I was so hungry. 

Anyways, we walk in and it's packed inside and we feel like a nuisance coming in with our 8 month old! The hostess tries to figure out how to fit us inside since it was so hot outside and the manager comes and decides that they can get us a highchair, sit us at the sushi bar,  and have us park our stroller by the door. This was the first time we've ever been offered a highchair! And I was happy that they didn't think the stroller by the door was an eye sore. I REALLY appreciated the manager trying to accommodate us quickly. We've definitely been in situations where even the management  gives us dirty looks for bringing a baby to the establishment. But hey! We are young parents who like bringing our little dude out with us :)

We get seated and our server and the manager we're super nice the whole time. He often came over to check on us and refill our water glasses. This was the best service we've ever experienced at this location. So I just wanted to say.. I know Stingray is a trendy place catering to good looking singles during happy hour, but thank you for being so accommodating to this family :)"}
{"text":"No matter which location whether it be Scottsdale Quarter or Biltmore, there has been one thing that has been unfortunately consistent and that is the terrible service here. 

I typically always sit at the sushi bar due to the free miso soup and edamame. The food is decent,  the house maki rolls like an unagi roll or a spicy tuna roll are half off during happy hour which is quite the deal. But when it comes to the restaurant experience don't expect anyone to refill your water, ask how your meal is going, or even bring you your check. I've worked near a Sting Ray for the past four years, going there time to time for an hour lunch break at work and unfortunately the behaviors/mannerisms of the employees at this establishment is something I expect now. I can honestly say I have never had one positive experience in terms of service pretty much ever. So if you're looking to leave a restaurant on a positive note after your meal I would definitely recommend you go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Staying at the nearby Westin Kierland.  Shuttle service provided to Stingray.  The shuttle driver recommended Stingray sushi over the other nearby sushi restaurants.  We concur.  The sushi was excellent.  Went during happy hour.  The prices were great.  The atmosphere is upscale chic, and the service attentive and polite."}
{"text":"I'm here for Mother's Day and the service is terrible. I ordered the Shrimp and Scallop entree for $23 and got one shrimp, one scallop and 4 small sticks of fried rice. It was tasty but too small. My husband ordered 4 sushi rolls but they took 40 minutes to come out. So, I ate my entree while he watched me eat it, then, he ate his rolls while I watched him eat. Don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"So this place is like Geisha's less talented sibling... that happens to live across the street.  The food is worse and the servers arent quite as attractive.   If youre looking for an uninspired menu, this is your spot.  As for me, I think id rather save the $25 and buy some fireball."}
{"text":"They have reallllllly hot miso soup!

I know that because the last time I was here, our waitress poured half of my miso in my lap. With no apology. And no offers to comp the soup that probably has left my ovaries unable to function. 

But hey, she and the other staff are pretty so that's all that matters, right? Nobody cares about service or basic manners anymore, right?"}
{"text":"Wow this place is great!!!! The atmosphere is very upscale being in the Biltmore and all and the sushi is on the pricier side but it's worth it in my opinion. 
Our waiter, John, was so attentive. When we needed water he was right there with the pitcher. He also made a great recommendation for an appetizer. He was the main reason for the 5-star rating!!!
The chicken yakitori was my favorite. I'm coming back and ordering all the other yakitori options. 
We had the California rolls and salmon nigiri. The California roll was pretty standard but the salmon nigiri was very good quality. 
This place is perfect for a date night or girls night out! I need to try happy hour!!!
Free parking in the back of the biltmore too! But I'm pretty sure they validate as well."}
{"text":"The food here is good and authentic. I like the bento combination choices. We had lunch here on a quiet Saturday. Not busy at all. A couple of us ordered bento boxes with sushi  and others ordered rolls. We were nearly done with the bento by the time the first roll came out 25+ minutes after the bento arrived. The sushi that came with the bento showed up nearly 15 minutes after the first roll and 40 minutes after the bento. We asked what was taking so long and the waitress explained that it was served \"family style.\" I don't speak Japanese but Family Style must translate to really slow with no explanation or apology from the server. The sushi appeared as if it had been sitting."}
{"text":"I've recently had an experience that really made me have a change of heart about this place, but after speaking with the Manager at Stingray I can confidently say he was genuinely sincere about making my experiencing a great one. He followed thru with his word to ensure it was corrected."}
{"text":"Well, it has happened. THE rudest waitress EVER in the entire history of customer service... yes my friends, we had her. I still kept the smile on my face, because of the people I was with. One of which was my manager, so I did not want her to see me get down right street ghetto on the manager of the restaurant. 

This was my coworkers birthday celebration, (it was on June 1) which was ruined by the lack of service this waitress provided. I have one friend, who does not eat fish, order a few things off of the menu. The waitresses response to her, \"oh, um, your table has already ordered a lot of sushi.\" EXCUSE ME RUDE LADY! She basically just called my friend a fatty, in the middle of the Biltmore, and with a restaurant FULL of customers. I mean, who in the world does this waitress think she is?? If WE, a paying customer, want to order the entire menu, YOUR job is go take the order, and get said food. 

Easy enough?!? NOPE. She then continues on with her rudeness with, \"did you want ALL of your food brought at once, or as it's made?\" Being that we came in as a group, we figured we can all eat at the same time, so we asked her to bring it all out at once. We simply answered her question. Well... not so simple. Her response, \"it will just take longer if we bring it all out together.\" OMG!!!! THEN WHY DID YOU ASK????? RUDE! RUDE! RUDE! That just lowered your tip by $5.00, keep your rude comments coming! On top of it all, SHE WAS TRAINING A NEW WAITRESS!!! WHAT????? Yes. True story. 

I kept my cool, and did not say anything to her. As bad as it was hurting me. I wanted to just get right back into her face. I mean, what the hell lady! 

Before I get all ghetto on this review, I'm going to stop myself. With all of this being said, we are never returning back to this location. I do not want to experience what he did, again. Bad move on hiring this lady!"}
{"text":"The sushi here is SO DELICIOUS!  People gave it fewer stars because they don't take reservations and the service is sometimes slow - but that's because people love this place and it is always buzzin with people.  

The best rolls are: the Morning Dew (takes long to cook, but SO worth it), the Summertime Roll, and the Las Vegas Roll

The fish here is always fresh and the sushi is always on point.  If you're looking for the best fish and the most innovative rolls, Stingray is the place."}
{"text":"Way off tonight ....
Twilight Zone bad .... 
I feel like I am on Candid Camera ...
I hate bashing the place I love so much but they are f'd up tonight!"}
{"text":"Has a nice modern atmosphere with warm lighting and a little sushi bar hidden in the back. We had the large sushi boat and a bottle of wine with two bowls of miso soup and the bill was under a 100 dollars. So Pricing is descent and to top it all off service was excellent."}
{"text":"I was a customer of this restaurant several times, today I was with my wife and her friend, it started they do not serve dishes usual  only from happy hour even though I was a couple of times and they are also present to me even in that time, then my wife was a bug in the soup so i call to the manager here  name is Victoria she no experience at all I do not know how a restaurant like that holds people who have no experience in the service and I speak because I have a restaurant and I know what it service, though she said she would compensate us then I find out the compensation it was in the bill , I was really surprised, Here is measured service and director did not know to do it at all except to say she was sorry all the time.  I'm not coming again even though the food is really good but the service and attitude very low."}
{"text":"We've come here a few times now and I have to say.. Sunday's the day to come. The sushi and sashimi is good. I love the Vegas roll, squid salad, philly roll. Service can be slower but you have to factor in the fact that it's not busy all the time, so it's a hit or miss. I can understand that if you're managing a restaurant, you don't want to over staff. We loved it when it was down in old town Scottsdale, was surprised that they closed that location down... But this place is still pretty good! I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Took forever to get our food and the restaurant wasn't even that busy. Food was alright. Tried the quail eggs and it wasn't what I expected; they were raw and didn't taste very good. Edamame is always a safe choice for an app and the sushi was pretty fresh. The lobster roll came wrapped in a lettuce sheet and was delicious!"}
{"text":".The waitress was a little ditsy but the sushi was good! The overall atmosphere on Saturday night was a little loud (oMg, how OLD am I?) It was hard to talk to our table of 8 but it would have been OK if it were just 2-4 people. 

We tried a LOT of different rolls and all of them were really good- some we ordered 2x! 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Quite possibly some of the BEST sushi in town.  The Spider roll is especially delicious when coupled with the Tokyo Mule.  Rock shrimp tacos are second to none and no where else in town.  The happy hour from 2:30 - 6:30 is my favorite happy hour!  You can't beat the deals and the environment is awesome."}
{"text":"I have been here for girlfriends birthday party, been here on date night, and out with group of couples - fun EVERY time!!!!  Food and atmosphere are amazing.  Only thing we noticed is that service was really poor - they actually took my water glass away mid meal and I wasn't drinking anything else!  We didn't care because we had so much fun with our friends but still.....  Also, happy hour half price drinks were ALL ice.  My husband had a Moscow Mule and very different drink during vs after happy hour.   I still LOVE the lollipop rolls and variety and will continue to go back."}
{"text":"Sushi here is decent. It wasn't bad, but I've had better. The service was friendly and the decor was cool..the type of place you could hang out at for a drink since it is also a bar, as well. We tried the lobster tempura which was quite good and some other lobster tail dish. We also tried a variety of their specialty rolls. They were a good size and tasted fresh. Price is kind of high but you are probably paying a bit for the ambiance. Service was friendly and prompt. Might be a good place for a fun night out with friends but if I'm really craving some super good sushi, I'd probably try elsewhere."}
{"text":"I prefer the sushi here above most other sushi places in town like Ra, or Kona. Tastes fresh, creative rolls, tasty drinks, great environment for happy hour with coworkers, or a fun date. Good deals for happy hour, though the rolls I like the best never seem to be in special- boo!
Tip- duh- sake bombs!
Tip- the lollipop shaped sushi"}
{"text":"We came in for a quick happy hour bite and cocktail. 
The fish tank in the floor looked dirty and disgusting. The floor over it was so scratched you could barely tell what it was. The guy (manager/owner??) Told me that it was the world famous tank. Get over yourself dude. 
We were seated in the dining room and the tables are presented nicely. They give you damp warm towels to clean your hands before eating. I liked that touch. I had the Asian Blond drink. It was good, but i could only have one (too sweet). We ordered the Dragon Roll that was $5 on happy hour. It was good. They have a female sushi chef, don't see that too often. The server was very nice. Nothing stood out for me. There are better places within walking distance."}
{"text":"Went here a few times....food is good, price is good.  My complaint is this:  Ordered the Calamari for happy hour special along with a lot of other items.  Before we ate the Calamari we noticed some long hairs in it which the waitress agreed was gross.  We sent it back and they brought another out.  With the happy hour price of $3.70, that's what they offered for having hair in our food.  I like the place but probably wont go back to a place that I don't think make it right for our party of 5.  $3.70, why bother?"}
{"text":"No longer a killer happy hour deal! Too bad it was fun while it lasted! Service was good still:)"}
{"text":"My review is NOT about the sushi, happy hour, or drinks. Those three things were GREAT. 

My low review is about the service -- from the hostesses to the waitstaff (excluding the bartenders). I came in with a 10 person group to eat in the dining room. There were a myriad of ways that the hostess could have figured out a way to seat us despite one table they continued to complain about that had been there for \"over 2 hours\". While they waited for one specific table to leave, they seated at least 5 other parties at tables that could have been put together to seat my party. We ended up waiting for an hour rather than 20-30 minutes. 

Once we were seated, at two separate tables, the waitstaff continued the bad service of the hostesses. The waitress rarely came to our table. We were there for close to 2 hours partially because of the poor service. One person in our party never received the rice she ordered and the waitress often had to be reminded of what had been ordered and what was missing.

After the two hours (three including the ridiculous wait) of poor service, one of the employees came over and asked us to \"quiet down\" in a very rude and disrespectful way. Luckily for the staff, our party was big enough to include gratuity because they deserved none of it. The only ones who deserved to get paid that day were the cooks and the bartenders. 

Oh, and I also watched two other small family tables wait 15-20 minutes for a waitress to return to take their paid check. 

At least the food was good..."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this location at least once a week for the last year, since I started working in the area.  The food is great, but the wait staff is among the best I've ever experienced.  It doesn't matter if they are busy or not, they are always very nice and very efficient.  The hostess is EXTREMELY nice.  No matter what is happening, she always has been very friendly.  I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I went back and I still absolutely and utterly think the sushi is great, but the service was absolute crap!  I don't mean because the sushi takes awhile, which is understandable.  The lady never checked on our drinks or if we needed anything else...we just had to wait for her to FEEL like she wanted to do her job and then bombard her with request.

I'm still a fan, but perhaps the management should hire attractive ladies who ALSO know how to do what they are hired to do.  Just a thought...

On the upside, they sell my absolute favorite drink, what I believe is the nectar of the gods, Aizu Homare Strawberry Nigori:-)"}
{"text":"Wow, people were not kidding about the horrendous service here, or the incredibly high noise level.  The teriyaki chicken was pretty awful, though the happy hour shumai and tempura were okay.  The easiest requests are not entertained (choosing flavors of mochi ice cream - thank goodness for Haagen-Dazs).  Way overpriced too, and I won't be back."}
{"text":"Great quality sushi, very fresh.  Comfy outside seating and awesome drinks.  Loved the green one, envious romance.  We sat at the sushi bar and got comp edamame and miso soup.  Kevin the sushi man behind the counter did a great job!"}
{"text":"This is an ho-hum average Sushi place. This place is popular with the people that I know, although I can't figure out why. The atmosphere here is casual and elegant at the same time. Their cocktails are good and very unique and a great deal during happy hour. The sushi is good, but nothing special. I've had way better sushi, but I've also had worse. But for the price point, I expect it to be better. On the food and drinks alone, this place certainly deserves no less than 4 starts, but the service is lacking. The service tends to be a little on the slow side. Seems like the average time from the time we're seated at the table and get our initial drinks is about 10 minutes. I'm not an impatient person, but that seems to be a pretty long time. I know people who are servers, and even they agree that 10 minutes is not acceptable, especially if everyone is just ordering a soft drink. I could understand if when I'm there, this place is super busy and everyone orders a cocktail, that it could take 10 minutes, assuming the bartender is backed up with orders, but in this last visit, that was not the case. I ordered a cocktail and the other 3 ordered sodas and tea. Once we got our food order in, we only saw the waitress one other time. The first to refill our drinks and the second time was when the check was ready. We were there for about 45 minutes, and to only have been checked on twice after our food came in is not exactly stellar service. Every time it's suggested that we come here, I cringe a little, not because of the food, or atmosphere, but because the service is subpar at best. It could be that with better service, I could rate this at least 4 starts, maybe even 5. If you happen to be at the Biltmore and are yearning for some sushi, this place is not a \"bad\" place to eat, but I wouldn't expect lightning fast service. I really do hope that the service there does get a better. Maybe next time."}
{"text":"Came during Happy Hour - can't beat 1/2 price. I've been here several time - the Sushi is always solid! The key is to replace the Krab with Spicy Tuna - like on the Red Dragon (the extra cost is worth it). They had some new fish tacos on the menu, I tried the  Shrimp Taco and also the Tuna Taco - both were excellent!!"}
{"text":"A sextet of friends entered the restaurant to have only a quartet served. My wife and I were the duet  unserved. All orders taken at the same time, and they even commented upon my choice,  but alas, we went away hungry. I don't recall an apology let alone being comped on a $190 tab. 
Great place for dieters.

[On a positive note, mein frau called the owner/manager of Stingray and was pleasantly surprised at his concern regarding an employee dropping the ball so severely. We appreciate his concern and applaud how he has dealt with the unfortunate occurance.]"}
{"text":"We had lunch on Mother's Day, we chose the bar since the wait was 20min though the restaurant was only 1/2 full. I had some questions about the menu because the price difference on the same entree (chef special vs regular dinner entree) and the bar tender shrugged her shoulders and said \"well I don't know and needlessly to say she was not going out of her way to ask.) We arrived at 1:20 pm and ordered in 5 minutes. We became a little anxious, after 35 minutes as  we still did not get our appetizer and salad and the folks who arrived after us were getting their sushi orders. While waiting for our food I noticed the chairs were were worn and dirty, the plates were chipped and the water glasses were not in great condition either very worn with scratches. We identified a person as a manager since he was not on service attire serving food  and questioned when was our salad and appetizer coming out, we received it immediately and the hot appetizer dish was cold, obviously sitting in the kitchen. We questioned the bar tender about 10 minutes later about our entree and she said, well it is going to be awhile;  we let her know it has been 45 minutes, but she said she will check on it and we got our meals soon after. My wife ordered the sea bass and I got the salmon with vegetables, unfortunately the barcode wrapping on the vegetables were still attached and I brought it to the attention of the server, she took it back and said the manager will be be out to see you.  The manager asked me what the problem was, I said the barcode wrapping on the vegetables were still attached and this is how it was served; he was unaware of the problem and I asked him to bring the dish back out and he stated it was already been discarded. This made me question the cleanliness in the kitchen. He offered to redo the order, by this time I was \"done.\" And declined and said we will not be returning. He became very confrontational and I said, I don't want to be combative as there were other guests in the bar listening and it is rude to conduct business like this after all this is Mother's Day. He apologized and said they are very busy. I politely said that's not our problem and he agreed but came out and said, he has dealt with difficult customers like us before, I was taken back by this response as he turned the problem on us. This is totally unacceptable attitude coming from a manager, but my wife's sea bass was excellent.  We were comped both meals but will not be returning to this restaurant. When we got home, I went into Yelp and read our experience at this location is not unusual, poor marks on the same issues."}
{"text":"The food here is always amazing. The servers are polite and attentive.  Management needs a lot of work. When 2 extremely large groups are served all of their sushi before anyone else is served any sushi, there is a problem. We had appetizers and then waited over an hour before any of our sushi came."}
{"text":"Had a late lunch at Stingray on 7/23/16. Restaurant ambiance is a \"10\" with a cool aquarium in the bar area. Outdoor seating is available for when it's not 110 in Phoenix. Our server, Samuel, did a great job and was attentive.  We had two bento boxes and a variety of sushi. Our kids love it here! Our food was good, service was solid, and our overall experience was enjoyable. Recommend."}
{"text":"Good sushi and a great location for people watching since it's in Old Town Scottsdale. It can get super busy though and a little crowded but that's okay when you know you're going to OT Scottsdale. Service was great and really pleasant. Food came out fast and was good sushi overall. It's on the pricier side but you're getting trendy sushi in trendy OT Scottsdale so what are you gonna do, right? Have been here several times in the last year and always walked away satisfied so I can't complain. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Have I had better sushi?  Sure, but there are very few (sushi) happy hours that can compete in the valley.  3 rolls, 2 salads and a bill totaling $18, not bad.  Another added bonus - Fast Service!  That is a rarity among happy hours alike.  

The location is lacking thanks to the big construction zone outside but the inside of the restaurant is nice, clean and modern.

Happy hour runs 3 p.m.-7 p.m Monday through Friday."}
{"text":"Stingray's decor tries hard to be sheik with exotic looking wood veneers and a trendy  retromod kind of feel. It reminds me of something one might see in \"The Incredibles\" movie. It does work quite well at night, but falls apart a bit in the daylight (been there twice). This fact actually says alot about the place in general.

On our first visit, we had a server who I named \"like-megan\". Possibly she refers to herself this way- hence the name.
Anyway- \"like-megan\" proceeded to tell the table in a wholly unsolicited manner how she was \"like soooo into food\". This made me want to ask her exactly what brand of wholesale imitation crab meat that Stingray uses. But alas my more gentlemanly instincts won.
 
As for the food- I've had my fair share of maki, but am no expert on the subject. It seemed, \"like-pretty good\". Not amazing, but  fresh tasting and nicely prepared. How else can one remark about Scottsdale sushi rolls except that they are safe to consume?

Overall, if you are into seeing and being seen in S Scottsdale, I would say that Stingray is probably a pretty good choice- particularly the patio. I would, however,  stay completely away from superficially fussing about how \"like soooo yummy\" the food is. You might end up \"like megan\"."}
{"text":"They do have a great happy hour...if not for that I probably wouldn't bother.  We sat at the bar, ordered drinks and rolls and felt like we were just SO privileged for being allowed to dine there...wait, who's waiting on whom here???  If you think you're too good to be a server or bartender then get a different job...and it wasn't just one, it was ALL of them."}
{"text":"Ok I work at a restaurant. I get you want larger tables but if I dine alone it doesn't give you the right to treat me badly. I was basically ignored by my server and another when asked for soy sauce. I tip, I'm easy and fast when eating alone. I love your food but after today I won't be back, alone or with friends."}
{"text":"\"Good for Groups\"...NO!  We went there for a bachelorette party, with a reservation for 20 girls.  If a restaurant with a capacity of 98 people can't handle that type of party, they need to say it, not leave girls standing in a tight entrance for over 45 minutes!  They had called earlier in the day to confirm.  When it came time to seat us, they said they couldn't get the party sitting at our table to pay their bill.  You would think with a party of our size, they would make sure the table was ready and available.  When I asked the hostess and manager to get us some cocktails or appetizers while we waited-they brought out one glass of champagne total for 20 girls!!!  After being seated, it took another 30 minutes just to get water and after an hour we finally had some food coming out-how do you not have water and edamame waiting for the people when they have been so patient.  They were bringing the water glasses out 4 at a time!  Unreal.  At the end, on a thousand dollar bill, they tried comping $12 worth of edamame and calling it a day.  After we said something, they comped us one round of lemon drop shots to compensate.  The food was okay, but not worth the service.   Customer service is a huge part of the found industry-they are selling a service as well as a product and it just seemed as though the management could care less. The best was at the end, they explained we waited so long because \"they don't take reservations.\"  That is funny because THEY called US earlier in the day to confirm the time!!!"}
{"text":"This is just for calling to ask a question. Your host doesn't know when lunch ends? Put me on hold for 5 minutes. Those cute girls need to do more than be cute. Wow"}
{"text":"I love love LOVE Stingray's!!! From the $5 sake and Sapporo all the way to the delicious little gummy candies at the end! I went during happy hour which is the best time to go! Again I will say $5 sake and Sapporo!!!!!!! You cant beat it. I also tried the fried calamari, which was fried tempura style, and had a yummy sauce with it. We had several sushi dishes, but the Las Vegas roll and the sashimi yellow fin take the cake! The waitress was amazing... our glasses were never less than half full, and I even had to tell her to stop bringing me more soda! Now that's service!"}
{"text":"Trendy, good ambiance, but overpriced. Prices reflect the trendiness, not the quality of food. I am a vegetarian and ordered one of two veggie options, and taste-wise, it was \"fair\". Expected better taste for the price ($18 for stir fry).  They were able to seat our large party of 8, though."}
{"text":"Stingray is actually one of the more tastefully decorated Asian places I've seen, that incorporates Oriental elements like bamboo and dark teak without looking like a caricature of itself. Two of us shared a medium sushi boat, which included two types of rolls, 6 different kinds of nigiri sushi, and 5 different types of sashimi, three slices each. It also came with two bowls of miso soup and a bowl of rice. Honestly, quite a nice amount of food, unless you're starvingly hungry. I enjoyed the rolls, but the rice was a little disappointing because it didn't have the characteristic tang, glossiness and sweetness of rice vinegar and mirin that I was expecting."}
{"text":"Now I have never actually eaten at Stingray sushi for full price. I always go there for their incredible happy hour. Their happy hour goes from 3-7 with all of their specialty drinks on special as well as a bevvy of apps and sushi. My go to cocktail always seems to be a Skyy ginger vodka and soda. I have tried all of the specialty drink and I always go back to the Geisha a Go Go, Asian Blonde, and Kiwi Collins.

As far as food goes, I keep coming back again and again for the awesome spring rolls, and spicy tuna rolls.

I love the atmosphere of Stingray, I always get excellent service. Perfect place for an upscale happy hour!"}
{"text":"When first walking in to Stingray Sushi, a low-lit bamboo themed restaurant greets you. At the entrance there is a fish tank under the floor... and that was the best thing about this place... We ordered the Yakiniku and the Hew Do Bow. 

The Yakiniku's stir-fried Asian vegetables were ok, I couldn't really tell with the whole meal being drowned in Korean Soy Sauce.

The Hew Do Bo should be renamed to the Edgar Allan Poe*, because this meal was worthy of being buried under the floorboards and it left me with feelings of regret. 

If I were invited into Stingray Sushi again, I would not venture too far from just eating Sushi...

* Edgar Allan Poe's \"The Tell-Tale Heart\""}
{"text":"This place is good.  Me andd my wife have went 3 times and now and very fresh. a little pricey but it is in the middle of downtown scottsdale.  I would go back over and over."}
{"text":"After being a regular here several times a week for two years, I'm sorry to say I believe I just had my last visit. 

Several months ago they got rid of the real sushi chefs and replaced them with guys in T-shirts who don't greet you or even smile while you're there. Several times I've been seated at dirty tables and today was no exception (something that looked like snot I swear) and my dish was dirty as well with a huge chip missing. The front door mat is always filthy, one of the toilets or sinks is always broken in the ladies room, the staff is mostly apathetic and ever-changing, and the place seems to have no \"adult\" supervision. 

But in the past I've overlooked these matters because the sushi was actually quite good. Not anymore. Once or twice before today, I received some salmon that just did not seem on par with previous visits. But today, I got some that was definitely not good. I discreetly spit it in my napkin and went up to sushi bar and quietly told them what was wrong. With no apology they said they would cut me a different piece. The new piece tasted great, so I think they were trying to move some older fish. I'm seriously concerned about food safety at this place now.

Half of the staff there today knew this happened, and they know I'm a regular, and I was very nice about it, yet no one offered to really make this right or at least take something small off my bill or offer me a drink etc. Something!!

This place does not have a lot going for it anymore except its location. It's really sad that they just don't seem to care and don't offer the service that people expect these days. I don't need five star service, or even five star food. I'm at the Quarter a lot and I'm just looking for somewhere consistent with good food and good service, and my business is worth thousands of dollars a year. There's too much competition for them to be downgrading their fish, letting things get dirty, and ignoring some of their best customers. Every time I go here the place seems more and more empty. But they don't seem to be learning their lesson.

I don't think they'll be around much longer."}
{"text":"Sooo fresh and yummy sushi!!

Cute tiny place with super fast and friendly service. Now the sushi is incredible! We had a variety of rolls and loved them all! The tempura lobster was good, but way over shadowed by the sushi and the lychee martinis! The martini's were so delicious...drank 3 and we were still sober I guess that was the only disappointment."}
{"text":"Very impressed. Waitress was a little bland. Very nice happy hour. Fresh sushi. A place I would come back too and I don't say that often."}
{"text":"Stingray's happy hour's really good.  Good sushi, nice beer, nice people.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"When you enter a sushi place there is a certain level of service that you expect, provided you are not eating gas station sashimi. Sting Ray sushi exceeds expectations in that aspect. My tip, sit at the bar. This is a little known secret and allows you to customize and configure your sushi to your liking. It helps to ask the chefs and cooks for their respective recommendations and discuss what you may or may not like. I was apprehensive about trying some of the dishes at first but I came out with a more refined palate. The Nigiri was well prepared and the rolls were adequate for Arizona. The one surprising thing about this place is that they sell tacos. They are arguably the most underrated item on the Menu. The Ceviche and Crispy fish tacos are my favorite. I will continue to stop by anytime I'm at the Biltmore."}
{"text":"I went here for a special occasion on a Wednesday and brought in a homemade ice cream cake, specifically told them to put it in the freezer and when it was brought out, I had a pan of melted ice cream.

On a more general level, Stingray has always been one of my favorite places to go because of the ambiance and design.  The floor has a little fishy pond at the entrance and even their restrooms have beautiful sliding doors.  The service here can be spotty, but their happy hour  makes up for it.  Happy Hour is Monday through Friday: 3-7, honestly the only time I go because the prices are cut almost in half."}
{"text":"POOR SERVICES!

My friend and I went there for dinner. There is only ONE menu on the table for us. We ordered 2 appetizers and 2 main courses from  the menu. Very simple.  The waitress messed up with our orders. She kept bringing our food to other tables Next to us. Sushi plate came first before other food. She said it is \"family style.\"  If so, do not put \"main course\" on the menu. What a lousy service restaurant!!! 
Do not want to spend any penny there. Not worth it!!"}
{"text":"i loved this place...atmosphere, sushi, drinks.  HOWEVER, we went there sunday and on their website and on the printed menu it says ALL, repeat ALL drinks 1/2 off.  we got the appetizers and drinks 1/2 off EXCEPT the sushi champagne (which was marvelous btw).  they had a couple of different prices and we went with the lowest ($11.00 a bottle).  however, everything was correct except they charged us $22 for 2 sushi champagnes.  when i asked the waitress why we didn't get it at half price, they said it doesn't apply to that.  really?  very, very disappointed.  i also sent email thru their website and have received NO response.  i regret already recommending this place for those 2 reasons.  only reason i didn't give it 4 stars was because of these issues."}
{"text":"Been to this location many times and have had consistent slightly-above-average sushi and same with the service.  Most recently went in on a Friday night and we were seated immediately.  Our very young blonde server blatantly ignored us while finishing up with her other two tables in the section.  She literally stood at the table next to us and looked at us and didn't say a word.  We sat there for a good 10-15 minutes, marked off the sushi we wanted and waited....and waited some more, without so much as a glass of water.  It was clear that Goldilocks was about to get cut from her shift, probably headed out to some Scottsdale club, and didn't want to get stuck with another table.  We walked out and the hostess said, \"Hope you enjoyed everything!\"  Right."}
{"text":"I'm pleasantly surprised! My daughter said check out the new sushi place and we didn't even know this existed so we're really happy we came. I recommend the happy hour. Even with the happy hour it can get pricey but that's sushi for you! Much better than Ra across the freeway and competitive with local sushi spots. I'll return!"}
{"text":"Are my friends cheap?  I am beginning to think so for during my recent trip to Scottsdale, I was invited to more happy hours with REALLY cheap prices and pretty great food.  And Stingray was no exception.

Located in a mall (what isn't in this part of Scottsdale?) the happy hour here features half off rolls, specialty drinks and cheap wine all served in a contemporary environment. And here's the kicker . . .it is EVERYDAY from 2:30 - 6:30!  I don't know how they do it but I am glad they do for you can get out of here with a full tummy for about $20!

Good thing the alcohol is on the inside of this place for if you drank first and then had to figure out where the door was, more people would be standing around.  Check out the picture I posted . . .I think we seriously looked at this wood wall for several seconds before realizing how to open the door!  

We took a seat at the sushi bar and had great service from not only the sushi chefs but from a server as well.  Know that only the basic rolls are discounted but those are easy enough to fill up on.  We also ordered a couple of their specialty rolls which were also really tasty!

If you are clever, you can park in the parking garage and if you come out the right door- you are very close to the entrance.  

There is also a nice patio area here as well.

Check it out.  You wallet and your stomach will thank you!"}
{"text":"Always great service and ambiance.  The sushi is always fresh and the selection is always solid and diverse.  Go for lunch and take advantage of their bento box specials."}
{"text":"REVIEW PURELY BASED ON HAPPY HOUR:
WOW.  where do I begin??

1. amazing happy hour prices (drinks too!) DRAGON ROLL! $6
2. fast service
3. friendly staff
4. great music
5. overall perfect night.....

except for the random girl bringing us a round of sushi and just standing next to our table, without saying ONE WORD. Just looking at us.  Not saying what she has or anything normal.  It was weird."}
{"text":"Went for Happy Hour and sat outside under the big screen TV.  Waitress was polite, knowledgeable and prompt.  Ordered sushi and sake and was pleasantly surprised when I got the check.  I will definitely return again and bring some friends.  The Happy Hour specials are worth checking out and there's a wide variety to choose from."}
{"text":"This place is sweet, I highly recommend it.  When you walk in the door be sure to look down at the floor because you're standing on a fish tank - pretty cool.  The decor is very trendy and the atmosphere is chill.  We had a drink at the bar on a Weds. night before heading out to the patio for dinner - not overly crowded which was nice.  The sushi was delicious - quality pieces and very fresh.  My only complaint was the bathroom sink - while very cool looking, the faucets don't work unless you slam the handle in and then the water just sprays out sporadically.  This was a little messy but the rest of the experience was great."}
{"text":"Great place. One of my favorites. Happy hour is great. And the sushi is not bad. Like the outside patio. This is a great Resturant. I'd suggest the staples. All the sushi is good. The bento boxes are also great."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, Stingray Sushi was a major letdown. It all started when the server brought us plateware that was still covered in some kind of sauce (probably soy sauce). It was not just a little bit, and it was on both my dish and my friend's.

Thankfully, they also serve hot wash clothes at the start of your meal, so we were able to clean the plates off before using them for our own food. Really grossed me out, and I'm very surprised that the server never saw (or felt the stickiness of?) the sauce on those dishes.

**Reading through other reviews reveals that we may not have been the only ones who have ever experienced this. Which is TRULY upsetting, because dirty dishes served to guests should not be ANY restaurant's chronic issue. So disgusting...

We ordered up and the food came pretty quickly, but after being served the wrong dish (twice over) and recognizing that the crab in our tempura sushi was pretty obviously artificial, we were both done eating.

I'll admit: we've become sushi snobs over time, but it's not like I had high expectations of this place. It's just that even my low expectations were never met. The server was kind enough, but apart from that, the experience was a total flop.

I suppose that, if you're into sushi as a gimmick, Stingray might suit your needs. But if you're out for some real sushi with actual (fresh) non-artificial seafood, you'll have to look elsewhere. In fact, I'll tell you exactly where to go:

Hop in your car and drive to Shimogamo instead. It may cost you a couple extra bucks in gas, but it will save you the headache of a mediocre experience and you'll be eating real food prepared as an art. (Shimogamo is the best sushi I've found in the area bar none.)

Sorry Stingray - I really hate to leave bad reviews, but you kinda sucked last night.  :-/"}
{"text":"Best lunch spots at the Biltmore if you are looking for a fairly well priced sushi selection.  I am a big fan of their bento's, they pack them with two salads, lettuce and cucumber and finish them off with your favorite fish, chicken or meats.  Did I say these bentos include miso soup and rice? BOOM!  If you are looking for top quality sushi, I would say they have okay selections but really not too many places in town have this.  I have not been here for dinner so I will just give them a respectable 4 stars for the consistent lunch experience."}
{"text":"Supreme quality, but extreme pricing. A great place for lunch, happy hour, or to make a good impression. 

Love the ambiance, ideal for a date, business meeting, or any sort of good impression, and the staff is top notch too.

The sushi, especially sashimi, is high grade. Amazingly fresh stuff, and the selection is varied with different types. For a truly special occasion try the lobster dynamite-- it might have been one of the best seafood dishes I have ever tasted. 

The cocktail menu is impressive, but the martinis can be a bit strong. 

Dinner pricing is high, but nothing unusual for the marketplace, and portions are small, but like I said before you're paying for the quality and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Hick up as we had to wait for our table.  The hostess didn't feel comfortable seating 5 and had to wait for the manager to seat us. 
Back up on sushi too. Over 20 minute wait for rolls."}
{"text":"Just horrible. Service was slow and the sushi cheap and not very fresh. The Crispy Spicy Tuna had been sitting and was too deep fried. Gross."}
{"text":"Best sushi ever! (Sorry JJ) You can't beat half price rolls and appetizers until 7 pm either. Totally going back."}
{"text":"My fiance and I decided to go out for sushi last minute and decided on Stingray's Happy Hour. We sit at the sushi bar every other time we have been here and have always had decent service. This time was a completely different story. 

We asked to sit out back on the patio and take advantage of the 70 degree weather. Worst decision we made all day. Our waitress, whom we hadn't had the \"pleasure\" of meeting yet, was busy letting the customers behind us know she forgot to put one of their rolls in and it wouldn't be out for another ten minutes. After she left you could hear the disappointment as they talked about how good the food was, but the service was terrible. I knew this was gonna be a completely different experience than we were used to after hearing that.

15, literally, 15 minutes later my waitress hasn't even acknowledged our presence and I'm getting rather parched. At one point I asked my fiance if this was a sushi buffet and we were just unaware. After the jokes about their service I took the menu up with our rolls marked off and kindly found the girl who seated us. I asked her if I was supposed to walk the menu up to the sushi bar myself and put my order in. Then I asked here where the glasses were for water so I could proceed to go pour us some water behind the bar. Needless to say it still took another five minutes to finally meet our server after the confrontation. 

From here on out it was smooth sailing and we had our little sushi rolls that we thoroughly enjoy. We discussed over dinner if I should say something to the \"manager\" or not and finally at the end decided a 15 minute wait in this type of industry is just unexplainable. So when the bill came I asked for the manager and he promptly came out and acknowledged that she only had 3 tables in her corner and there should have never been that long of a wait. I agreed, thanked him for understanding, and proceeded to pay my bill. He never offered to adjust it in any way and I decided since he wasn't adjusting my bill for his establishment's terrible service, I wouldn't adjust my tip to show the server any compensation for his lack of judgement. 

From now on, we will always sit at the sushi bar because it has never been a bad experience, I can see my rolls being made, and the sushi chefs are way more funny and sadly more competent than the rest of the staff."}
{"text":"I haven't been there for happy hour, however, I was not impressed with their dinner menu. My friends and I left."}
{"text":"OK - about 2 weeks after I wrote this review, I got an e-mail from a dude who introduced himself as one of the partners of Stingray.

He apologized for the way I was treated and asked me for more details of the incident so he can look into it and rectify the situation moving forward.

He also asked for my address so he can send me a gift card.

Which he did! $50 worth!

Once again, kudos to Yelp for bringing business owners and their customers together!!!!

Stingray's sting didn't last long...and they lived happily ever after!"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi great service and a great location.  I have been here several times and have enjoyed each one.  Try sitting at the sushi bar during  Happy  Hour."}
{"text":"I have only been to this particular location. I will say that I like this place over RA, but once again I come for the atmosphere and drinks. Nothing fancy about the sushi... it's not bad but it's not the best. Great for a after work get together, or a casual date."}
{"text":"Have dined here a lot and I've found the food to be consistantly \"pretty good.\"  The service varies (I think with the time of day)  Happy offers a decent selection of discounted items.  United Air dinning miles are accepted if you're in that program.  Wait staff looks good."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite stingray. It has a great atmosphere, good drinks, and good food. We went there on a Friday night and it was pretty slow. We sat at the bar and had excellent service. Our bartender was superior and did a great job not only making us drinks but also making conversation. 

The sushi was pretty good. The flavors were different and worked well together. The salmon sashimi was fresh and delicious.

I have to say I would go back here any day of the week. The experience is really what sold me and I felt like we were the only ones there. Great service really made this a superior experience. This is my favorite of any of the Stingray locations, love it!"}
{"text":"Stingray's happy hour rocks awesome deals, great service and a fun atmosphere. Conveniently placed in Old Town and the Biltmore, each spot is ideal for post work meet ups with friends and coworkers. Both locations also have really enjoyable outdoor patios for those days when the weather isn't too scorching hot.

You can stuff yourself with some pretty tasty appetizers and sushi rolls or sake bomb the work day away for some wallet welcoming prices. They offer half off specialty drinks and sake carafes, as well as sushi rolls and food items from $2-5.

I rarely ever make it to post work happy hours that end at 6pm, so I love that Stingray starts theirs at 3pm but keeps it going until 7pm. That extra hour gives me enough time to relax and enjoy the specials. 

Also just as a note, this delightful happy hour isn't offered on the weekends. Their dinner is alright, and some rolls aren't really worth the full price tag. That's why I highly recommend Stingray mainly for just their happy hour because it's a work week wonder that works well with my work week schedule!"}
{"text":"The food was surprisingly good, but expensive, as compared with Kyoto a block north.  Not the best sushi I have had, but solidly good.  I like the decor in the small restaurant where the sushi bar is, but not the bar area.  However, this restaurant is VERY, VERY LOUD!!  Seriously, you can't even have a conversation!  I much prefer to sit outside on the patio, or go elsewhere.  Sad, but true."}
{"text":"It's okay. I ordered the spicy crab roll. My coworkers ordered the bento teriyaki salmon and the chicken salad. We all thought it was good but pricey. The decor was very nice and fancy, maybe too fancy."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere here and the food is great. The prices are reasonable and they have happy hour between 230 and 530 with half off rolls and drinks. I definitely recommend stopping by here for sushi when you're in the area. Everything we had was delicious."}
{"text":"What a bad experience!!!!! The food was good but it took 45 minutes for our server to come out so that we can order our drinks. Our waitress was Hannah but it gets better the manager was not al all accommodating she showed no sympathy that was a very bad experience to a great day that we were having until we decided to have lunch at sting ray we will never be back!"}
{"text":"The sushi was so horrible that it was the first time I had to return sushi in my entire 15 15 year sushi history. It is truly not a sushi place they are in a awesome location and I believe it gets a great deal of business because of location not taste."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi places. The waitresses are always on point and are engaged with what they do. The happy hour is superb and leaves little to be desired. Perfect corner location to soak in the sights of north Scottsdale, definitely a must visit place."}
{"text":"Spicy tuna roll $3.50!  I love Stingray! They have great food and an amazing happy hour.  I would highly recommend this place.  My favorite is the tuna , they also have a few chicken items for the non fish eater.  GO HERE!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour. Salmon yakitori and lobster tacos are a favorite."}
{"text":"Good sushi, nothing mind blowing, good Saki (what's really important?) and screaming hot waitresses!!

We had a rather large party, but would like to hang out on the patio for drinks and sushi next time."}
{"text":"Their happy hour is great! I recommend the crispy spicy tuna, red bean ice cream, spicy salmon roll and pork gyoza"}
{"text":"Spent a day of shopping at the Scottsdale Quarter and thought I would pop in for some sushi.  Place was dead but the service was good.  The food is always high quality and fresh.  I sat at the Sushi bar and chatted with the Sushi chef, which was fun considering there was no one else in the joint.  I wish I would have waited a bit longer for the HH prices but over, its good food and good price."}
{"text":"First time here,  I love Japanese food,  extremely disappointed,  server wasn't paying attention , we said no for the silverware, another server brought us my husband's food and gave us more silverware.  Regretting coming here, should've just waited at Sakana or went to Kabuki. We were just looking for other Japanese restaurants. Definitely not coming back."}
{"text":"Stingray Sushi! Where should I start? I came to dinner with my cousins last night and we were seated right away.

I heard of this place from facebook advertisement and googled new restaurants especially Yelp. And I like the ratings so wanted to try it out.

Once we arrived through the coolest double doors, we walked to our seats up the two step left in the middle, sat down and we were handed a menu with many selections without pictures of sushi to know \"oh that's what it looks like\". There was a white paper and a pencil, to mark down how many sushi you want nigiri/sashimi and the price.

Geisha A Go Go was $10.50. Watermelon yum! It was sweet!

For the appetizers we had 2 orders of the Calamari with Japanese Aioli. Just loved it so much! It was the same size of the plate where you will see it right in front of you once you get seated. Small serving. Didn't realized that.
Yes it was quite a bit pricey. I ordered the eel without knowing that there would only be 2 servings in each plate and I ordered 2 so that just made it 4 all together. And for that was $16. But it was really good!
Then came the Tuna Tataki. It was delish but didn't quite finish because it was raw. (And my memories of raw food was not so good).

Anyway, wanted to know if they had the Beef Yakitori and so they did. Our waitress said it was just 2 beef sticks for a small order. Ordered one. And omg, I just thought it was tender but biting it off, the beef on the stick, was like trying to yank it out because it was tough. Never to order that again. But the three sauces were good!

My sister shared a meal with one of my cousins and they had the Salmon. It was delish! Finished the plate.


Had two more orders of sushi, one was the Las Vegas Roll and the other I don't remember.

One had the dessert of the chocolate cake and Mochi. The choco cake was good but get the Mochi, it's better!

I'll come back for the Happy Hour which is everyday on a certain time because we didn't catch it in time. Best day to go is Sunday all day Happy Hour.

One last thing. What's with the pebble/rock? Just a decor? Wanted to take it home lol"}
{"text":"We had the special roll for an appetizer, not bad but not great. Wife got the tempura bento box, it was ok but the batter was very thick. I had the Nabeyaki soup bowl, it contained two overcooked scallops, one mussel, one tiny crab leg (about the size of a crayon) and two mushy shrimp tempura. Soup was ok but a little too salty. Got the tempura ice cream and it was horrible, there was more batter than ice cream, just 3 gooey scoops. We told the waitress and she said they all come like that. Overall they are not quite on par with Tokyo Express. Not worth $55 for lunch without alcohol. Service was very slow even though there were not too many people there."}
{"text":"Not the best sushi and food on the planet. With that being said their happy hour on Sunday is pretty amazing. We got a drink, four appetizers, and two rolls for $22. That is a great deal.  Our favorite was the crispy spicy tuna. We will definitely keep this place in mind when we are craving sushi on Sunday."}
{"text":"Four of us went there for happy hour and ordered 6 different dishes.  The setting is nice in Scottsdale Quarter and the outside dining area is relaxed and shady.  The waitress was clueless.  The choices ranged from mediocre to awful.  The kicker was when one of the party ordered a rum and coke and they gave her a coke with gin.  Do not go to this place."}
{"text":"First visit was during Happy Hour on a Friday at the Scottsdale Quarter.  

Let me just say, best damn happy hour around and not just cause of the drink specials.  The sushi specials cannot be beat, dragon roll or las vegas roll for $6...that's just insanely good. 

The service is top notch, we did not go without anything.  I took a sip of my ice tea, she was there to replenish.  The whole experience was amazing.

The sushi cannot be beat.  Fresh and top quality and I know my Sushi."}
{"text":"Great date spot or GNO for sushi! Staff was friendly and very helpful. Drinks were so good and sushi was fresh and delicious! I will definitely be eating there again when I return to Phoenix!!!!"}
{"text":"OK, so hubby and I are quasi-sushi geeks and we're from LA which is a great sushi town...but, really, while the service was friendly and prompt, the quality of the fish here is just terrible.

It's easy to cover up poor quality fish when you douse it in mayo (that's what Dynamite is) or bury it in a spicy roll (typically where yesterday's fish goes), so we always open with yellowtail and tuna sushi -- simple, reliable benchmarks for fish quality and chef skill. Both were dull, flavorless and cut like a kindergartner. We gave them one more opportunity on the salmon skin roll -- again, it was amateur hour, so we pulled the plug and went for gelato.

Um, no, we won't be back."}
{"text":"The 105 degree heat was oppressive during my recent visit to Arizona, so when a friend suggested a light sushi lunch at Stingray, I was immediately sold on the idea. 

Light however, it wasn't, as I stuffed my belly full of tasty fresh cuisine. We started with the seaweed salad (yum!), and ordered 4 rolls to split. It ended up being a little too much food for us, as the portions were pretty large. The Vegas Roll was (unexpectedly) the favorite (and least healthy) of the bunch, containing cream cheese and salmon, and then deep fried. Certainly not a traditional dish, but tasty nonetheless. 

There didn't seem to be a whole lot of crazy dishes to try (which I'm always attracted to), but overall the place was quite good."}
{"text":"Very neat place to go! Very trendy and classy. The food was good and there were a lot of options. My favorite thing is the hidden door in the wall. I had the spicy shrimp and another roll that was good too. We ate here today for a group lunch and had a blast. I would come back for sure. Our waitress was very nice and so was the hostess. *note* they only do group checks so we had to figure out how to split everything."}
{"text":"Ohh Stingray.  How I mourn for what you used to be.

This place was a solid happy hour spot.  The food is mediocre, the music is generic faux-laptop-DJ shit and the drinks are overpriced.  But on happy hour, hot damn.  It was all fantastic because the prices justified it.

But here we are today, and the sake bombers have gone from lower end of the spectrum $5 on happy hour to all of a sudden $8 each without warning.  Really?  Did you think your food and vibe was justifying raising the price that much?  Now you're the most expensive sake bombers around!  

I'm disappointed.  This place isn't good enough to justify that kind of price for a bottle of Kirin and some trash sake.  It isn't enough to justify 8 for two shitty small skewers of chicken when Dozo does it better for cheaper.

Guess this is the last time I or my friends come to this heap, too bad because there's a lot of us and we're always looking for a decent happy hour."}
{"text":"My wife and tried this place after seeing some billboards around town for it. We walked away happy and full!

We went during lunch hour on a Saturday, and found seats immediately. The server was professional and checked on us numerous times during the meal.

We both had the shrimp and vegetable tempura bento box. It came with miso soup, rice, tempura, salad, and cucumber salad. We both also had a California roll, and I added nigri sushi to my bento box.

Everything was very good. The miso soup was excellent, and the bento box was a great deal. The tempura batter was light, and all of the fish was good. Nothing was old or smelled bad. 

We also had dessert and coffee. The tempura ice cream and cheesecake were delicious, and the coffee was strong and good.

At 56 dollars total for everything including tip, we were very happy and will be back."}
{"text":"Both Stingray locations are great, but this is by far my favorite. The view from the patio isn't as nice as the Old Town Scottsdale location, but the food seems to be prepared slightly better and you can't beat the happy hour drinks, roll, and food specials. 

I always spend more than I intend to, but it is always worth it! Great after work spot for happy hour or early dinner."}
{"text":"Michael was bar tending and did a great job keeping up to speed with my wants.  Had a glass of wine and a slice of cake.  Wine was good, but the cake was only soso."}
{"text":"I rode along with a friend to Scottsdale for the day and she treated me to lunch. We ended up going to Stingray Sushi near the Fashion Square Mall. They have a great patio to sit out on and enjoy a nice day in AZ. The sushi was good we got a Vegas roll a Philli roll and a California roll pretty standard and then a order of chicken yakitori. Between three of us it was plenty and our friend had plenty left over to take home which was good. The Vegas roll was mildly soggy from all the eel sauce when it got to us and the chicken was dry but it still tasted alright. The service was pretty good both times i have been. I would go if i was in the neighborhood and wanted sushi."}
{"text":"My friend's and I had been craving sushi all week so we ended up here for happy hour (2:30pm-6:30pm) on Friday night. Let me tell you, their happy hour pricing is the best! I frequent RA a lot and as much as I love going there, I have to say that after this one visit to Stingray, I enjoy Stingray's happy hour more and feel like it is a better deal. 

During happy hour at Stingray, all their appetizers, tacos, house maki, and cocktails are half off! (literally whole sections of the menu and not just select items like RA). 

My friends and I went a little crazy on the sushi. I personally ordered the shrimp tempura, roll, spicy salmon, spicy scallop and miso soup. The real standout was the spicy scallop roll! So be sure to get it when you stop by!"}
{"text":"This was our 4th time at this place. 

The only reason we gave it another shoot past Sunday is because it is so close by our house and we were craving sushi. 

We waited almost 30 minutes for patio table while seating at the bar and looking at 3 empty tables and no people in line. When we set at the bar to order drinks while we wait for table, it took waitress good 15 minutes to fix our drinks. 

When she brought our drinks, she placed so far away from us and while she was putting them down she was talking to customers that were behind her. Awful. 

Finally we go to hostess and ask her when will we get our table? Magic happens and she seats us right away at tables that were empty entire time. Reason behind it - they were understaffed. How is this my problem?

Finally at our table, greeted by our server who never even brings us a water and she never did until we asked for it. We ordered so much sushi and we had to ask her on several occasions which sushi is which. 

Never did anybody check on us to ask how was the food?  

I understand that you can be understaffed; however, acknowledgement of that or explanation would of been really helpful. 

This restaurant has a great location but it lacks a good service. Perhaps better management."}
{"text":"We ordered ours to go and they missed one order of sashimi plate and there was no wasabi in any of the other entrees/rolls we ordered :( Now who forgets wasabi??? 

Fish was fresh though and sushi rolls were delicious. We got spicy tuna, spicy crab, and some California rolls in addition to entrees."}
{"text":"I just love the sushi here. The all day happy hour on Sunday is such a great deal. Definitely try the lobster tacos too. We had a great server by the name of Dylan. He was super helpful going over the menu and provided friendly service!"}
{"text":"Disappointing.  Service & food have gone downhill.  About our fourth time here.  Looking forward to a great meal but instead got apathetic service from the bartender. Lousy food.  $100 spent for two on entrees that were inedible. We've always ordered the same entrees. Me vegetarian tofu. My husband Chilwean Sea Bass, $28 bucks BTW.  Fish was dry and chewy drowning in wilted onions. Never had that before.  Onions???   My tofu, usually crispy seasoned instead was soggy with no taste.  The server shrugged sorry we have a new cook. Great.  100 bucks blown    Never again.   
Update:   No response from management after contacting them about our disappointment.  That says it all."}
{"text":"I came here for my best friend's birthday dinner. She made a reservation for 8pm and we didn't get seated until 9:30pm! We had a fairly large group, about 8 people, and we were just awkwardly standing outside while someone would come outside every 15 minutes to tell us our table was ALMOST ready. After an hour of this nonsense our group was ready to go somewhere else because we were so hungry. However, we decided to wait it out. Apparently we were waiting for people to pay their check and finish their meal. What was the point of making a reservation? 

Once we were seated our food came pretty quickly but our waitress seemed less than enthused. I ordered the salmon roll and spicy crab roll which I would say were pretty decent. I don't eat sushi much but my friend who also attended the dinner and eats sushi said that it was just average. Needless to say I will not be coming back here again."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi spot! i have been to lots of sushi places but this place beats them all! Their happy hour is amazing. It is all day on Sunday and from 2:30-6:30 during the week. I have been here with a large group, a couple girlfriends and my husband and every time has been a great experience. The staff is always extremely friendly and the food is really good quality for the price."}
{"text":"Went to the new Stingray for lunch.  It was not bad and EXTREMELY filling.  Its located where that sports bar used to be at the Biltmore near the SE corner.  It was about 30% full or so when I went.  

They have an open patio outside that was full of patrons.  On one side of the inside there was a bar and larger booths.  On the other side there is a sushi bar and smaller tables and chairs.  It was filled with your typical BMore crowd.  I sat at the sushi bar.

The waitress was very polite and helpful and not pushy.  Just the way I like them.  They give you a complimentary miso soup to start.  I scrolled thru the menu and decided on the sushi bento box with nigiri for 14 bucks.  She quickly brought me out some edamame that comes with it.  Both the soup and edamame were solid.  Nothing to brag about but good enough.  After that the sushi chef worked on the nigiri and handed me the bento box after about 5 minutes or so.  It came with a cucumber salad, regular salad, 4 good size pieces of nigiri (yellow tail, salmon, shrimp, and tuna), and a California roll.

The fish was mediocre.  Not as fresh as I would have liked.  The roll is typical California roll.  I'm not a big fan of California rolls in general.  This one was good for not being a fan.  The cucumber salad was tasty.  All and all the food was a 3 and the service was a 4.  If the fish was fresher I'd definitely give it a 4.  I may be back to try some more.  

FYI - I'm not sure what Fred M. ordered.  There is no bento box that comes with sashimi and nigiri.  My bill came out to just over 18 bucks with a 20% tip and no drink."}
{"text":"Food was okay, just very small portions. Service was pretty slow, all around not that impressed."}
{"text":"The soy paper rolls are creative and wonderful.  Each time I have been here I have loved the meal.  It is a little pricey for each soy roll but definitely worth it!  The atmosphere is friendly, hip and fun."}
{"text":"Good food but not much flair or creativity. The people watching is the big plus. All in all if you want the best sushi experience, this is not it. I know this is short, but that's all this place deserves. It's not bad, but it's not good either."}
{"text":"Our server had a hard time believing that our party was older than 21 (we are all 24 and 25, mind you) and gave us quite the run-around with checking IDs.

After that throwback to my freshman year of college, we put in an order for a few rolls. None of them really wowed us, sadly - Lava (a \"special\" roll that could have been a lot more special), Dragon (best of the batch), veggie (for the lone ranger who didn't eat meat, yet surprisingly good), and tempura shrimp (tasteless!).

The edamame was good, but how can you really mess that up?

The best part of the meal was the cheesecake for dessert which came with two sauces, raspberry and dark chocolate.

Probably a good date place, if you beat the crowds. And their servers are attractive, probably should mention that :-)

All in all there are much better sushi joints, I just know it."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of those places that you would stop by for dinner before you go clubbing for the night, NOT a family sushi place. Very loud, trendy, and full of younger gals and guys. 

Points they got for was:

Good atmosphere and ambience, loved the lighting fish in the floor.

Probably be back to grab a bite before partying, but not with hubby and baby for family dinner!

Complimentary miso soup and edamame when you sit at the bar to eat.

Very friendly and attentive waitress. Explained the menu to me cos it was my first time there.

Sushi was very very fresh. The sushi chef made it in front of me and the timing of it was perfect, they slowly came over the bar and was not rushed.

Points they lost for was:

Pricing. Not the most expensive sushi I've ever had, but definitely not cheap.

Proportions could have been bigger, but what do you expect from a clubby sushi place?

Probably be back to grab a bite before going out clubbing, but not back with hubby and baby for a family dinner!"}
{"text":"I ordered the sushi bento for lunch and was only happy with the salmon nigiri.  Everything else was meh.  It's definitely not worth the money or the smooth rock you get to look at on your napkin.  We won't be coming back."}
{"text":"5 stars mostly for service by KELTON. Great guy busting his ass on a sunday afternoon. He was polite, informative, attentive, and genuine. We grabbed a light snack and some drinks on the patio. The weather was perfect! The chairs are AMAZING at the low tables, so super comfy. When we came in the hostess said there'd be a ten minute wait for a patio seat so we grabbed a seat at the bar to wait. From what we saw the interior was awesome! That place must be hopping on a friday night. Our table was ready in two minutes so we headed outside and were greeted by Kelton. We got the Moonstone Lemongrass Coconut sake to start. It's thick, unfiltered, coconutty goodness. Wow! So good. For the nomz, we grabbed salmon sashimi(my favorite and hint: its good pretty much everywhere), something with halibut and sriracha, and a roll I don't remember. I just know the roll had jalapeno, crab, tuna, and garlic sauce. The salmon was delicious but could have been skinned better, I hated the halibut (but my partner loved it!). It was very light, a little dry, with no flavor. The roll was delicious and extra spicy! The menu is huge, we were trying not to order much as we were planning on a big dinner. Our server was excellent and gave a great dinner recommendation. Ask for Kelton!"}
{"text":"The Summer Time Roll is a deliciously refreshing roll and the highlight of the evening. The Godzilla Roll is super chunky so bring a big mouthed companion with you and it is big in price, too. I would pass on the Crab Roll. Salmon nigiri tasted fresh and the portions were reasonable.  The Karatumba sake was good, as well. 

So why the two stars? Mostly it was based on service and the fact that Uni was not present (just like many other sushi restaurants in town). It took well over 5 minutes after being seated for the server to come around and introduce herself and take our drink order.  It was not a busy night.  

Throughout the whole evening our server only took one empty dish back to the kitchen.  I am fully aware that in some restaurants there are \"servers\" and there are \"bussers\" but I think servers should communicate with their bussers if the servers are less inclined to bus their own tables.  I understand that some servers want their bussers to work for their tips if the servers are \"tipping them out.\"  We were left with empty plates at our dinner table for the whole evening.  Our server constantly asked us if we needed more to drink and we might have been more inclined to stay and order more drinks if our table had been bussed.   

Earlier at throughout the dinner, when we asked for soy sauce she grabbed the soy sauce container from an unbussed table that was dripping sloppily with sauce on the outside of the container. Later, because she chose an easy solution, we quickly ran out of soy sauce and she actually had to go inside the kitchen and bring us a filled, clean container. Overall, the impression we received is that of a lazy server.

We most likely will not go to Stingray again unless it is for a quick bite of a Summertime Roll."}
{"text":"Clearly worth 4 stars! One of the best sushi restaurants in the valley! It's better than Ra but not better than Sushi Roku. The service was also excellent. The waitresses are beautiful but friendly and didn't give off that trite Scottsdale \"I'm too good to work here\" vibe. 

The prices were not cheap. If anyone pretends this is affordable sushi, they are lying or stupid. We had a party of 4 and spent $130 including drinks. We only ordered maki rolls too. That same meal at Ra would have been less than a $100. It's not the most expensive sushi restaurant in the valley but it's not \"affordable or inexpensive\"

The only real knock on the place was it's claustrophobic atmosphere. This place is terrible for big groups. It's an ideal couples restaurant. We had 4 people and felt like our group was too big. There isn't much seating but they did their best to accomodate us. The restaurant is really narrow. 

I would recommend this restaurant but only for couples and for those willing to spend over $80 if you are going to eat and drink alcohol."}
{"text":"great menu, fresh, and excellent quality.
The happy hour is the best value, so go between 4-630pm I believe as thats the best time.

The dumplings were also really great. So the Happy Hour menu is more than plenty satisfying and I would recommend it."}
{"text":"Happy hour till 7.  $6 specialty drinks (recommend raspberry and roses) and $3 to $5 Sushi rolls special featured item: Recovery roll $12 (probably one of the best rolls I have ever had anywhere) with proceeds to support Japanese people  recover from the catastrophe and the thousands of people that remain homeless.  Great service, food, and drink. Dont forget 2 hour free parking just have your token validated by your server."}
{"text":"Overpriced. Terrible service.  Poorly designed/portioned rolls.  The only pluses I can think of are the location and the decor.  Lovely patio.  

We stopped by for a quick lunch and ordered three rolls.  We requested all rolls to be made with soy paper instead of seaweed - a common request that has never been an issue at any other place.  Two rolls came out just fine... the third?  Under the soy paper was a whole second layer of seaweed.  What?  Okay, whatever... mistakes happen.  Unfortunately, our server was just dumb about it - \"Oh... I didn't know you didn't want seaweed...\"  Really?  You didn't know that is why we made sure we ordered all three rolls without it?  And then, even after having to wait another 15+ minutes for a newly prepared roll to come out... they didn't give any kind of discount for our trouble... oh no... they actually just re-rang the bill to make sure that they UPcharged us for that soy paper.  Fail.  

We won't be back."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill fast ... I've been eating here regularly for 6 years and most of that time, the food has been decent but nothing spectacular - it's the closest sushi restaurant to my home, so I deal ... but my most recent visit may have been my last. Sashimi and fish used in rolls was not fresh, not even close to fresh. The fish tasted and smelled old. Servers are nice but slow even when not crowded. (Although in the past, we've had super-servers, friendly, attentive and great with kids, so have to give them props!)

Kids meals are \"recycled\", I'm sure of it - generally my kids have love eating here and have loved the kids' meals - and I'll admit, I've nibbled on their leftovers and the meat (beef) has been tasty in the past but on this last visit, I swear the food was re-heated for like the 3rd or 4th time, from days-ago cooked meat. It was nasty, super tough, burnt. Give the adults bad food, fine, we can drink alcohol to kill the nastiness .... but do not give my children old as f*** food just because they're kids - not cool."}
{"text":"I enjoy the sushi at Sting Ray. But my last visit the service was awful. We were missing sushi orders, no drink refills, missing itemized receipts,  we were taking soy sauce from other place settings, the service was awful. There were maybe 5 people in the whole restaurant. I wish I was able to be more positive about my experience.  When you are spending $100 on lunch you expect good service."}
{"text":"Stayed at the Hotel next door. The food and drink was great.  Happy hour prices are assume."}
{"text":"This a phenomenal spot for a date, or for family, and friend time! Now that its cool the patio is ripe for a chill evening, comfortable furnishings. The service was great, and the food was spectacular. Lobster tacos,  and gyoza were impeccable. Order the Japanese Stock Exchange!"}
{"text":"My 16 year old son and I visited for the first time for happy hour due to Yelp reviews. Our server Jason was phenomenal with his introduction to the menu and suggestions. We will be back for the $2 taxis wrapped in butter lettuce and California rolls. Great deal on the drinks as well. The decor and music is also more appealing than nearby sushi establishments. Happy hour is 2:30 to 6:30 everyday."}
{"text":"I really didn't want to give Stingray 1 Star but quite frankly after 5 failed visits in a row they deserved it.
Service is ALWAYS slow, beyond slow! You'll wait 20 minutes for your drink and even when you tell them you want all of your food at once nothing comes out together and 30 minutes (if you are lucky) after you order. Are they catching fresh fish here?!? 
If you want to spend 3 hours at a sushi joint that serves subpar food then this is your place! If you are ready for a drink and starving you'll have better luck waiting at IHOP on a Sunday morning."}
{"text":"I was disappointed at the selection of regular sized beer.  All they offered was the large size of several brands.  Food was good, but over priced.  Server Jane was wonderful."}
{"text":"I have to start this post off by saying that the four stars is in relation to Phoenix sushi restaurants.  It does not include some of my favorites in San Francisco, Hawaii or Vegas.

Stingray has become my favorite sushi joint in the Phoenix area.  I can't wait for them to open at the Biltmore, so I don't have to make the trek to Scottsdale for decent sushi.  The environment, with the only negative aspect being that it is too small inside.  The food is very good as well.  My personal favorite is the Spicy Special roll which comes out with a spicy mix of seafood on top (it changes and hence the special).  Make sure to talk to your waitress about whatever they have fresh, but if you are a sushigoer then you should know this.

I'm a big fan of the bar area, and can be often found at the bar for some sushi and a few cocktails before a night out in Old Town.  The atmosphere is great, the music is loud enough to hold a conversation, but not so soft that all you hear is the conversations around you.  Their selection of Saki is good (not great), and the bartenders seem to be knowledgeable about the different brands.  This is not a super high end Sushi restaurant like Sushi Roku, but they pack the punch of a good mid level sushi bar.

I am a big fan, and will definitely continue to frequent this restaurant."}
{"text":"I frequent Stingray Sushi at the Biltmore and the service is always hit or miss, as well as the sushi. But I like the location, the atmosphere and the later dining hours so I keep going back. But last night I had the worse service not only here, but anywhere. Our server was Beth, and she originally took forever to greet us and bring waters. She took our order and that was pretty much the last time I saw her, except for a few occasions. I had to ask for a side of lemons and sriracha three times before I finally got it. The first time I asked her when she took our food order, the second time I asked gentleman who was walking by and the third time I had to ask Beth from a distance as she would never come check in on the table. The only other  time I saw her we asked for the menu as the sushi pieces were on the smaller side and we were still hungry. Beth brought us our menus, and never came back. To the point where I had to bring my bowl of left over soup to the bar to get a to go container and pay the tab. I noticed that Beth thought we had left without paying after we got up, but then when she saw us at the bar she did not acknowledge us, or even come over to apologize."}
{"text":"Was better don't know what happened in the past 5 months. Service was on point at the bar, tonight it was horrible for how slow it was. In the whole restaurant. I had to get the bartenders attention to order more food then it took forever! I left to the Apple Store bought a watch came back and the food still was not there! Idk what the bartender was doing but it was obvious she remembered when she saw me that she had not put in the order for us. Also I never got the beer & saki I ordered from either bartender.... so I left them a 7% tip, I was being nice leaving something but honestly they did not deserve that since I had to go to someone else just to get what I needed like napkins, soy sauce...etc"}
{"text":"Service was excellent- hence the 4 stars. Food was good. Ordered salmon skewers and hamachi sashimi. Hamachi tasted very fresh but I prefer it cut thinner. Just my preference- everything was good and I would go back. I sat in the bar area during happy hour and the bartender made me a lychee margarita that was absolutely delicious"}
{"text":"This place has its location going for it, because that's the main reason my date and I wandered in for some late night sushi.  Had we not been so exhausted and hungry, we probably would have left after taking a look at the menu.  Everything is very overpriced (but I guess that's Scottsdale for you)...not to mention the sushi chefs couldn't make a special roll for me, even though the ingredients are available.  If you're making the rolls fresh, this shouldn't be a big deal, and I rarely have issues when asking places to make a vegetable tempura roll...throw the already made tempura you have into a roll, and done.

There was only one vegetarian roll available, which shows a little lack of creativity, in my opinion.  And said roll was bland.  Service was so-so.  Will likely never be back."}
{"text":"After the yelp diy event at make we went here to grad a drink/bite! it was okay but a little pricy! but the bar tender was super hot/nice so that's a plus!! Oh yea and did I mention her was a nursing student?!? hard worker with goals, i like, i like! Prices are okay moderate, but my fellow elite got sashimi and was charged $21 for like four pieces ekkk! the bar area was pretty, I'll go back maybe if im at the quarter!"}
{"text":"Great location and a seriously good happy hour.  

Friendly attentative staff and clean sushi bar. 

Their happy hour has some great classics for affordable prices."}
{"text":"Hair in our sushi. All servers with their long hair down? Not fresh. Not good. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Ventured here for HH last night; service in the bar/lounge area was efficient and courteous. HH menu pricing was very good: $3-5 for rolls and $3-7 for various appys and entrees. Drinks were really reasonable as well-I got a bottle of Sapporo with hot sake for $5, and the house red or white was $4/glass.

I really wanted to like the food more than I did. The calamari and chicken tempura were each served with a surprisingly flavorless remoulade, and the breading was equally unremarkable. Veggie tempura from the menu was served with the traditional tentsuyu sauce, but the vegetables were a tad too raw and cold for tempura.

California and spicy tuna rolls were tiny and not particularly well-formed, but serviceable; the oblong-shaped crunchy spicy tuna roll (a deep-fried or carmelized piece of rice, topped with the spicy tuna spread, a pepper slice, and sweet eel sauce) had not-so-fresh tuna spread and was not particularly appetizing in appearance. Spring rolls were cut into four or five pieces and drizzled with eel sauce--nonoffensive, I suppose, would be the best term.

On the positive side, the seaweed salad was delish-but what doesn't sesame oil make tasty?"}
{"text":"I just giggled reading a recent review below. Who calls a sushi restaurant \"user friendly\"? Not sure what that means? User friendly must not be related to the staff, It just can't be.

Sushi: sometimes it's poorly rolled and not the freshest tasting sushi to be had in Phoenix by a long shot. 

One thing, well kinda the main thing, I do love here sushi-wise is the crispy spicy tuna roll. 

I do like cocktails, they have those here! 

Lunchtime bento boxes are  pretty nice, I must admit. 

Come here, (but don't expect your water glass to be refilled. Or the black napkin you requested to come to fruition) for somewhat amusing people watching. 

Service is never great. Pretty subpar/ mediocre. 

Other places you can enjoy sushi: Moira, Cherry blossom, Hana, Kabuki (Tempe), Yasu (North phx)"}
{"text":"While the happy hour prices are friendly, this place is simply not for me. The \"scene\" was very \"wannabe hipster,\" to a laughable extent. I was here with some coworkers, but would never visit this place on my own time. The wait for a table was absolutely ridiculous and he cocktail waitresses were complete snobs. The bartenders, however, were very friendly."}
{"text":"We arrived a few minutes early for our reservation on a Saturday only to be told we would have to wait about 20 minutes for a table.  While this does happen occasionally at other places that over-book, they informed me that they don't accept reservations for parties less than 6.  Interesting, as the reservation was booked through Open Table where they have the ability to set what reservations they take.  The receptionist was either mis-informed, didn't care, or the owner just simply doesn't know what they are doing. 

An additional point is that the music inside was exceptionally loud.  I will say, though, that I did see the reviews about the loud music and didn't think it would be an issue. When we walked into the restaurant, it was overwhelming.  

We did not stay and this restaurant lost our business, not only for the evening (we went to Dozo and had a great meal), but forever.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Was suggest this place by a previous local.
They don't take reservations - so keep that in mind.
They have a very cool aquarium in the floor when you walk in. Kinda creepy, but neat!
They have a number of very hot and very tall waitresses.
Ours was Erica. She rocked for the first half of the meal until we decided we wanted round 2 of sushi, then her attention waned and our wait time extended.

We started with miso soup and a las vegas roll on special - i didn't like the smolked salmon taste.

What i really loved was the Godzilla roll, and the lava roll!
The crunch roll was ok, not great, the egg was a little watery, the stingray roll was covered in dried cilantro and was simply weird.
A fun place over all. Not super crowded and not as loud as some people thought it would be.

The mochi for desert was weird, you didn't get to pick your flavors... hmmm.
And our waitress took enough time to bring us a knife and spoons that our mochi melted.... sigh.

I'd suggest knowing to only have 1 round of sushi so you get the good service!!"}
{"text":"Everything was amazing! It was my birthday and our waitress was fantastic! She was so friendly and great w my little boys. She brought them little fish figures to play with and its those little details that add up to a great night! I can't remeber her name, but we were in a corner booth and I hope she gets recognized as every great server should. Thank you for a special birthday and cheers to the wait staff!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour, great location and good service. The sushi is average but does its job and goes down great with some sake!"}
{"text":"Sushi at Stingray is amazing! They have THE BEST happy hour menu.  Highly suggest trying their japaengo roll or the godzilla roll"}
{"text":"Watch your credit card statement.  On November 6th, my colleague and I went to Stingray for the great happy hour we'd heard about.  And, it is a great happy hour, price-wise.  For $10.64 I had a beer and more than enough sushi, being sure to order the happy hour items our server told us about.  I tipped her$4.00 so the total on my receipt was $14.64.

Several days later, I was reviewing my credit card statement and saw $26.26 had been charged by Stingray.  I asked my colleague to check his statement, and low and behold, he'd also been overcharged.  He contacted the restaurant and ended up speaking with the owner, who apologized and corrected the problem.  I believe he ended up crediting the entire amount back to my friend's card.

I've called Stingray twice and explained the situation.  As of today, November 19th, nobody has called me back and there are no credits on my statement.  Now, $11.52 isn't a lot of money, but it's the principal.  How were they able to overcharge me when my signed credit card slip has a lower amount?"}
{"text":"The sushi was not good enough, to me, to make up for the table next to me. There was a large table of about 10 people, probably in their early to mid 20s, and they had been enjoying quite a few alcoholic beverages. Now I'll NEVER hate on anyone for that, but they were being stupid and annoying. One guy at the table threw his water glass into the aisle - twice. Broke two glasses. I kept waiting for the staff to kick him out. They cleaned up the glass and didn't say a word to this a$$. I was in shock that they didn't even speak to him about his behavior. Acting like a destructive child. 

Ya know, I realize they're running a business, and they had a large table, but it's offensive to me that they didn't speak to him to protect their OTHER PAYING PATRONS. And this is why I'm not going back to stingray.

Plus - they have fishies in the floor. I'm concerned for the fishies' welfare. Remember when you a kid and your mom told you not to tap on the fish aquarium because the fish don't like it? I wonder how they like the tap dance that the foyer floor gets nightly :-("}
{"text":"I've been here 6 times from when they opened.  The first time; was a couple weeks after they opened.  Fell in love with the Crispy Spicy Tuna; only drawback was that the soy sauce (had a lovely floral note to it; come to find out it the soap had not been rinsed out); oh well it happens.  Every since then had a great experience there...From Crispy Spicy Tuna (have to order it every time) to the drinks (love the Geisha a-go-go); the sushi is good, the happy hour is great; have had everything to eat on the happy hour menu...Will be back..."}
{"text":"Definitely has be come my go to sushi place.  It is not amazing but it is consistently very good. The service is always way above average.  This 5 a solid choice for your sushi fix."}
{"text":"Best happy hour around! So many choices of rolls as well as appetizers and  tacos! Always great friendly service!"}
{"text":"Service was great, Waitress was Brittainey. Price for happy hours was crazy good. Much prefer a non-imitation crab option but the atmosphere was fun and overall the meal was very enjoyable."}
{"text":"I've been going to Stingray for several years now and it's one of the best sushi restaurants in the Valley. The Morning Dew roll is my absolute favorite and they're always adding new, unique rolls to the menu. I'm writing because I was especially happy with our service last week! Our server, I think her name was Megan, was adorable and absolutely on top of everything. There are some dining experiences that make you leave the restaurant feeling good about your day because you're treated so well. Last week was definitely one of those experiences. With customer service lacking now-a-days, I thought I should write in and reward such a great dining experience. Thanks Stingray! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Was looking for a place with a fun atmosphere and good food to take friends who were in town for just the evening. They wanted sushi and after reviewing several sushi restaurants in the area I made the executive decision on Stingray. We came in around 9:30 pm on a Saturday night and the place was DEAD! 
Decor was beautiful and had a high-end feel, but it definitely came with a price tag. 
We started with Edamame and Spring Rolls, which by the way are $7 for only TWO. We had to place two orders to feed four people. So $14 for four spring rolls. Thankfully they were delicious and the mustard sauce they were served with was good with a little kick.
My husband ordered the Yakiniku- cooked steak and veggies. He asked for noodles instead of rice and we were charged an addition $5 for the substitution. He was slightly disappointed with the dish, especially for the price. 
All of the sushi we ordered was good - spicy tuna and lollipop ($14!) for me. Our guests wanted a salmon and avocado roll and as this was not on the menu, there was again an up charge to add avocado. They ordered a few other rolls, of which I cannot recall at this time... however, they were pleased with their orders. 
For four guests our total bill came to $160 (before tip) which I thought was a little steep for what we got.
Service- our waitress was great, she was very attentive--perhaps because we were practically the only people in the place?--either way, service was good and food came out quickly. She even brought us a free dessert of our choice (cheesecake) after she heard we were celebrating good news. 
All in all, four stars - service and ambiance exceeded my expectations and although a little expensive, the food was good as well."}
{"text":"This is where I fell in love with sushi.!!! (first time to try sushi)

The morning dew is my favorite by far the sauce is amazing"}
{"text":"The space is pretty small so it gets crowded. And while I don't order any crazy fancy sushi, for some reason the Philadelphia roll I usually get did not taste as good at this location compared to the biltmore location.  But their Las Vegas roll was good."}
{"text":"Came here because they have been great accommodating my gluten allergy in the past. Server was great but whoever was in the kitchen tonight said I only had three options. Seriously? I've been here before! Oh well, we were hungry so I simply got the salmon roll, which is just salmon and rice, thinking it'd be very difficult to mess up. Then they brought out my GF roll on the SAME PLATE as the GLUTEN roll!!! We even wrote GF on the ticket next to the roll - just one extra step to inform the kitchen about my allergy. On top of that they were out of GF soy sauce, which I was informed of after ordering."}
{"text":"Okay so here is the deal with Stingray..Is it the best sushi, no, but the location (old town) is great and pretty convenient. I love to be adventurous with food, especially sushi, but the times where I want something I know I'm going to like, this is the spot. The service is always good, and so is the food. You have to try their Shrimp Shumai. You're welcome ;)"}
{"text":"Awesome place to unwind after a long day! Business professionals hangout around the \"indoor/outdoor\" bar. Great place to meet new friends (old & young). The happy hour prices are on point! ...and the food is always good (for the area). I settled for the California Roll, Hamachi ceviche (not that great), and later a Rainbow roll.  Wanted a Riesling, but they were out of stock! :-(  I settle for a plum wine considering I like sweet, white wines. It was awesome!  The waitstaff can be a little more knowledgeable in the menu selections."}
{"text":"The lobster tempura is not worth the $20 - the tempura taste overwhelms the lobster and can't taste it. The Tuna Tataki and the Gyoza were pretty good. Everything else nothing you can't get at other sushi restaurants. Portions could be bigger for the amount they charge. Bonus for people watching when you sit at their patio."}
{"text":"The sushi here is decent. It's not a \"fantastic sushi find,\" but it scratches that sushi itch. I've dined here 5-6 times, and the thing that is truly remarkable is the aloofness of the staff. The bartenders, although cute, think this is their roost. I suppose they believe their role supersedes that of their customers'. The hostesses and servers are cute too, but if I want to bask in cuteness, I'd go to a puppy farm. I dine for food, service, and ambiance. The service here is so abysmal, I avoid it. When a bartender can't even make eye contact because she is so cool, (this has happened several times) I've got other places to go. I'm not a difficult guy to look at, but maybe if I had a fraternity jacket on, they'd be interested. Until then, let the employees' poor training continue to push customers away."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday for a fun lunch with a group of people I work with.  We tried SO many things on the menu it was unreal.  I was full for like 8 hours after.  Anyways, I HIGHLY recommend Stingray Sushi.  

When you try it for yourself, I personally recommend the Shrimp Shumai and potsticker appetizers, the Lava Roll, the Stingray Special Roll (both have a little spicy kick to them), the caterpillar roll (can't go wrong with avocado), and we also sampled the cheesecake, this delicious chocolate cake and the ice cream wrapped in tapioca.

Wow, re-reading what we all ate makes me feel full again!!  One of my friends insisted that we try EVERYTHING we wanted... so there you have it!  I love Stingray Sushi... Not a fan of Tyger L's review... Just sayin'"}
{"text":"For starters I would have to say the atmosphere here is absolutely wonderful! Music, decor is beautiful. The fish tank is definitely something to see, BUT I think it was all show to get you in the door.

My boyfriend and I LOVE sushi, we are always willing to try out a new place, and always trying to find the best. This fell short in a lot of ways. Options were limited, and way over priced. Loving sushi we decided to get \"The Boat\"  it includes sushi, sashimi, and nigiri. The sashimi was amazingly fresh and delicious. Everything else was mediocre if that.

We paid 60$ for our sushi, and both left extremely hungry, and totally unsatisfied. I don't think I'll be returning any time soon!"}
{"text":"A nice, small restaurant.  Good service, not exceptional, but good.  Nicely presented sushi rolls but could use a little more fish.  I would go back but not rush back.  Great location in old town."}
{"text":"Good happy hour specials. Sometimes the service is spotty. But overall we love to go (kids too)."}
{"text":"I went here for date night with the wife. I thought the sushi was really good. Nothing special, but if you like sushi, then you'll like this place."}
{"text":"My mom was in town and she has taken a liken to sushi. We stopped in here while we were in the area. The staff were all kind. Our waitress was filled with joy and offered many fun rolls. We order calamari as an app. I'm not a fan of the way they prepare theirs, but on this day, it wasn't about me. So I settled. We ordered four different rolls which came to the table sporadically. Mom loved then all! 

I'm always pleased when I visit Stingray!"}
{"text":"I cannot really speak to the sushi (I don't eat sushi), but everyone in our party loved their meal.  I just wanted to write a quick review to speak about the service!  We had the best waitress!  A party of ten women and this girl did a fabulous job, was attentive, quick, patient and even helped us with a birthday cake we brought in!!  A great experience!"}
{"text":"I really didn't get into Sushi until a few years ago.  I've tried a few places around Phoenix and Stingray has been consistently the best! Their fish appears and tastes fresher than other sushi bars.  The Staff at the Biltmore location has always been courteous and genuinely nice.  Great for happy hour!!!!"}
{"text":"We tend to try different spots while out of town on the work dime.

This shopping mall charges for parking?!  Such a pain to park.

Now lets focus on the food and service.
The ambiance is nice and the only thing going for this place.

Service was terrible, seemed impossible to get a refill, our server seemed to forget anything we asked, I mean.. write it down if you cant remember.

Food, I have gotten better sushi at the pre-made kiosk at Safeway.  Blown away at the pricing and the quality of the sushi.  Our waitress delivered the Sushi Platter which was 26.00 and had 4 small compartments (one dish) of terrible sushi.  Bland, almost freezer burn tasting fish.  

We ordered some of the more expensive items.  The steak as well as the teriyaki chicken.  No attention to detail, plate seemed sloppy, tasted poor and the teriyaki chicken had a nice long hair coiled up on the side of the plate.  Just very little effort seemed to be put into everything they tried to accomplish here.

Would never go back.
Would never recommend.

We tried Sushiholic down the road and was very impressed!"}
{"text":"Excellent meal this evening!!  First time at this location (been to Biltmore) since it changed from Ghengis Grill.  All I can say is YUM-O!!!  Loved my Maki and my partner, who doesn't eat fish PERIOD, Had the vegetarian udon.  That broth was killer!!!  Awesome night and worth the 30 mile drive from Casa Grande!!"}
{"text":"The best sushi in Phoenix.  My favorite this side of town. Very clean. Lots of space. User friendly. Clean restrooms."}
{"text":"Since our favorite Stingray Scottsdale location closed, we decided to try their new Chandler location. We arrived around 5PM on a Monday as it was before any possible crowd. 

Upon entry, the music was really loud. There was an attempt to seat us at the first table near the entry. Again, the darn music was too loud. I requested that the sound level of the music be reduced----\"No, we can't do that but you can sit outside\". Outside is where the smokers can dine but we didn't want their cloud of smoke to ruin our dinner.  Since our family wanted to talk and not have to shout over the music, we went way outside----which meant we departed this location.  

We headed right to RA Sushi where the music is lower. Stingray lost the $200 that we spent that evening. I wish Stingray good luck in its reborn format and hope the \"hip\" crowd loves it. Crossing off Stingray from our dining list! :("}
{"text":"Two visits to this restaurant in the last two months.  I am by no means an avid sushi connoisseur, but we do seem to make it out to a sushi bar about once a month.

The first visit was a no-holds-barred, someone-else-got-the-tab lunch with a group of friends.  We ate, and we ate well.  Rolls, salads, appetizers, all the way from a lowly California Roll to a few of those stuffed and baked lobster tails...it was QUITE amazing.  Other reviews of the restaurant are accurate as well in terms of pricing - this place is definitely a little on the higher side.  The drinks are pricey, unless you go to happy hour.  Which brings me to tonight...

We decided to stop in and hit up the happy hour pricing, but when we arrived (Saturday at 5PM).  The nice hostess politely informed us that there is no happy hour on Saturday.  I observed the other SIX customers, and thought: Stingray is missing out here.  My wife smiled and said no thanks.  

Then we got in the car and drive to Sushi Brokers a mile away, as they have 7-day happy hour specials and great food.  The parking lot was jam-packed, the bar was nearly full, and we got the last table in the restaurant...at 5:05 PM.

Stingray: your food is great, BUT YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG!!"}
{"text":"I went to the new Biltmore Stingray for a birthday lunch for a co-worker.  I will never eat there again.  The service was an absolute joke.  Two of the people in my group did not get their food until well after everyone else had finished their meals.  To top that off, they charged one of my co-workers far more than the cost of her meal.  It took us 30 minutes to get anyone to even review her bill.  The food was not bad (although the udon noodles at Cherry Blossom cafe just west on Camelback are FAR better for about 1/2 the price), but our simple lunch took well over 2 hours because of the poor service.  We complained to the manager, but he had a bad attitude and really could not have cared less about our bad dining experience.  There are much better sushi/Japanese restaurants in Central Phoenix (Hana, Cherry Blossom, etc.) that are cheaper and provide much better service."}
{"text":"My wife and I dropped in for Happy Hour a few days ago.

I was sort of on a sushi kick. I was excited to come try this place out because the happy hour menu looked really good with reasonably prices. (I checked it out online). 

We walked in and the place is really cool. 

It's got a nice layout and a good feel to it. 

The hostess sat us down and the table was really dirty. It was sticky too. We had to ask a waitress to clean it for us. 

Then came the flies. Man! There were flies all over! That was weird. 

So we look at the menu and we order. 

Las Vegas roll, 2 California rolls, that dumpling thing and edamame. Seriously. The prices were so cheap! Very good reason to go. 

I liked it! I've had better Las Vegas rolls at RA and Kabuki, but for the price? I mean we got all that aformentioned stuff for like 20 bucks. Not bad! 

My wife thought it was, \"eh\". I think I'd only come for the happy hour though."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere,music and location. BUT the rolls were overpriced and although the waiter was attentive, we were unable to enjoy our meal once the rolls arrived ,every 5 minutes the waiter would be at our table asking \"is there anything else I could get you\" as if we were being rushed out. Come to find out the restaurant didn't close for another hour!"}
{"text":"I don't know why we come back here -- I will say it's close to us and that's the only reason. My boyfriend and I have sat at the bar, the patio tables near the bar and the booths in the bar area and have waited for at least 15 minutes waiting for a server to greet us. Mind you, several of them walked by and we were staring at the bartenders who certainly noticed us with nothing in front of us and did nothing. The hostesses always look at us like we're crazy for asking for a server to come by, particularly the girl with the red hair. My boyfriend returned his soda very politely letting our server know it's flat, yet they continued to give him flat sodas. I specifically asked for regular salmon in my philly roll, as opposed to smoked salmon and accepted the $2 up charge to do that (no idea why it costs $2 to do that). They give me the rolls with smoked salmon anyway. Then it takes ridiculously long to get the correct order and my boyfriend is already done eating. Nothing bugs me more!! Returned my order altogether. Will never be back."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! Just moved to the area, this week was the first time I visited Stingray wish it was more pet friendly. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place but in the last 6 months, service and quality of food is going down the drain. Here now and still no server (15 min )"}
{"text":"Was in scottsdale for vacation and chose this place for dinner. It was amazing sushi. Probably the best sushi we have ever had. The stingray roll, crunch roll and cabo roll were fantastic. If your looking for a place to have sushi this is your place"}
{"text":"Had an amazing time here saturday with a group of friends! Our server Jovana was great and the manager was constantly interacting with tables and helping out the servers. We even got a surprise dessert at the end for a birthday! Can't wait to come back :)"}
{"text":"Great decor, fresh tasty sushi. I ordered the spicy crab, mango tango, and stingray all delicious. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"I have to give this establishment a major FAIL tonight. Didn't wanna do it, but their completely amateurish, mindless faux pas tonight behind the bar forced me to do it.

Okay, so...what bartender would toss out an almost-full champagne flute of high-end sparkling sake - wait for it - with a receipt covering the top of it (universal barspeak for \"do not touch\"!)??? Apparently \"Doug\" would. So, I return from a quick trip to the restroom and find my receipts, water glass and champagne flute mostly full of my Zipang disposed of by the man who was just seconds earlier being so kind and accommodating.

Well, something's very wrong with this picture, folks. And, did they apologize, when I expressed my dismay, saying \"That's why I put the receipt on top of the glass...it was an almost-full flute...\"? No. Just a \"get him another one\" directive from the manager to good ol' Dougie...nothing from the barkeep in question like \"Oh, sorry, man. Thought you'd split and left most your drink, covered by your receipt\" (Apparently a quite common occurrence in \"Doug World\")...Nah, just an uncomfortable vibe due to their (his) glaringly poor bartending decision. I sipped my replacement drink and was treated as if I should have cleared out already - or was it the painful embarrassment of a ridiculous bartending mistake hovering over us at that point? I should think the latter. Both are uncomfortable and should be avoided at all costs.

Uh, bottom line (and covered in Bartending Basics 101), Stingray staff: Any object covering a mostly-full drink is probably an indicator from the patron that they are coming back, and wish to consume the rest of said drink."}
{"text":"Good food.  Good prices.  Great atmosphere.  Their outside seating is fantastic.

Mitch is a first class server.

My only criticism would be ... three times I've been there, three times I stood at an empty podium waiting to be seated in a nearly empty restaurant at 8 PM.  The one time I said something, I got a snappy answer back from the host."}
{"text":"I'll chalk this one up to growing pains... service was not on par.  The bar tenders were a bit too busy to get us drinks quickly as we waited for our table.  Once seated, it once again took a long time to get drinks.  I feel like they missed out on the revenue of two rounds for our table of six.  The decor is great, and the sushi is on par with their other locations.  I still feel the \"hotty hamachi\" is their best dish.  Uni was sub-par, and no fresh wasabi as of yet.  I was a bit bothered that they never brought the toro we ordered, and when I brought this up, our waitress pointed to the sea bass on the table and said \"there's the toro\".  I let her take the dish to the chef and learn for herself that it was not toro.  Again, maybe growing pains... but I would educate the staff ASAP on what they're serving.  All that being said, hands down, the quality of fish here is notches above RA (which is supermarket sushi at best)."}
{"text":"Ok , I here good stuff about this place and the floor is cool. 

I went to eat there and ordered something with cilantro, it tasted like I was eating the entire bush of cilantro .

Everything else was gross too. 

Not to mention the violent diareah ( not sure of spelling, too lazy. Well I guees in the time I took righting all of this I could have spell checked?)

At least I lost weight :)

Unless you want to become violently ill for dietary purose dont eat here."}
{"text":"The sushi at Stingray is good, you get great quality food with a good quantity.  For my boyfriend and I we walked out STUFFED with a bill less than $35.  The service was just ok, they forgot one of the items that we ordered but it wasn't much of a big deal, but the mini \"tude\" from the waitress was more annoying than anything.  Other than that, I'm sure we'll be going back."}
{"text":"Could have better bathrooms. But the food was by far the best sushi/food I've had in awhile!!! Thank u and cheers!!!"}
{"text":"Someone from our hotel told us to go there. So we tried it, we had the worst service!! The food and drinks took for ever to come out. I felt bad for waitress cuz I had to tell her to cancel last food order.  If your hungry and want drinks don't go here. Cuz bar and kitchen are very slow getting food and drinks out. Plus roll are small and price doesn't justify."}
{"text":"The overall rating is \"good\".  The sushi, which is what I mostly stuck with wasn't outstanding.  The restaurant itself was very modern and chic.  The waitstaff did a great job as well.  Happy hour prices were great.  You can't go wrong with a large Kirin and saki for 6 bucks.  The food was just so so though.  But the rest of the visit makes it a good place to go to."}
{"text":"I had lunch here with a large group of friends on their patio on a weekday around noon.  I am pretty sure we just beat the rush since it started to fill up quickly.  We were lucky we got a good spot.  Their patio dining is very comfortable with cuushioned wicker couches if you enjoy that type of seating.  They have a very modern look.  The inside of the restaurant is very beautiful also with vaulted ceilings and a feeling of openess to their modern look.

The sushi was delicious and fresh tasting.  I recommend trying one of their rolls wrapped in cucumber with raw fish-very refreshing.

I will definitely be going back here and I would like to try their other locations in the east valley as well."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my our favorite places to go for sushi. I had sushi for the first time at this location two years ago. We have been to this location about four times after and visited the Scottsdale location numerous times. 

Based on my past dining experiences, I spoke highly of this place and brought my friends here last night. WORST service ever! Our waitress was Amber. She forgot everything!! Didn't bring us a high chair, side of rice for my friends young son, one of the kids bento boxes, two rolls of sushi, and the spicy mayo. We didn't get any soy sauce had to ask for it. The food came out all in a weird order. One whole side of our table was served while the other side literally waited an additional 15 mins. The kids were served last. There were bees and one landed in the kids food. We had 3 dirty plates, one dirty cup and a chipped sauce bowl. Our fav Las Vegas roll was way smaller than usual and not as tasty as we have had in the past. She had to reprint our check like 3 times because they kept messing it up. She charged us for a reg priced item (sake bombers) because she failed to put it in before HH ended. We thought she forgot about those too then brought them at the end with our check so we had to literally down them. We had to cancel the food she forgot because it was taking too long and we were needing to be somewhere by 7 pm. My nephew never got his meal and was starving the whole time. I had to stop and get him a burger. Just overall horrible experience. I was embarrassed! Oh and we made reservations. There were only outdoor tables avail for our time when we called and when we got there waited 20 mins to be seated! I really wanted to talk to the manager. But I hate being looked at like I am trying to get a comp meal and being that everything took sooooo long we ran out of time anyway.  I plan to call them to make this all known tomorrow. So disappointed. It just takes one absolutely horrible experience to ruin it for me. We had a $100 check during Happy hour. I expected way better service."}
{"text":"Great happy hour menu! So many options, and very reasonably priced. I  personally enjoyed the spicy tuna items. The regular sushi menu did seem a little pricey, so I'll prob stick to coming here only during happy hour. The hostesses seemed a little confused, and told us there was a 15 min wait when there were empty tables everywhere, but our server was fantastic. All in all, I will make an effort to come here again for happy hour with friends."}
{"text":"Stingray redeemed itself. After my last not so good review of Stingray, Bryan the manager reached out to me and apologized ,saying that they were understaffed and assured me that this was not typical service. He asked that I give them another try. 

Today we did just that and the food and service were fantastic. Sunday's are industry day and happy hour is all day. Great deals!  Thanks Stingray for taking the time to respond."}
{"text":"Went to Stingray Sushi for a lunch on March 7th and it was a disappointment: miso soup was very salty, edamame overcooked, shrimp tempura roll was dry and tuna nigiri were OK. I set at the bar and waited for a while before they served my order.  Will not go again."}
{"text":"I needed a good place for a lunch meeting. Every place around this restaurant had a 45 min wait. Stingray was empty. That should hav been my warning!! After 10 mins we were asked for for our order. Looking around, I decided against sushi because I didn't expect it to be fresh in a place where no one was eating. Ordered the salad. Dressing on the side. 15 mins later salad arrived drenched in dressing. 15 mins later new salad with cold rubbery chicken. I asked when was this chicken grilled. Got a snarly reply. There is no way any of that food was fresh. I'm pretty sure thekitchen is equipped with a microwave and nothing else. Seriously gross. Please shut down an allow for a better restaurant to take over this prime location. Yelp please allow for zero stars!"}
{"text":"I've had Stingray sushi years ago and remember it being mediocre. I decided to try it again and kind of wish I didn't. Right when I got there, I was warned that they were really backed up and that sushi might take a little longer which I was okay with. I came in during happy hour and expected the prices to be cheap, but they were definitely still on the pricey side.

 I started off my meal with a seaweed salad which I honestly thought was horrible. It tasted like seaweed soaked in vinegar. They weren't kidding about sushi taking long. I waited 35 minutes for my sushi to come. However, the server was really sweet and kept apologizing for the delay which I appreciated. When my spicy salmon roll and salmon hand roll finally came, I was disappointed because it tasted the way I remember it - mediocre."}
{"text":"Such mixed reviews of this place. I've been for HH a few times. It was always so busy and crowded that I honestly don't remember the food. Was just there last week and got a table. The food was good. Not anything to glow about, but it was about what I'd expect. The place itself is really nice and in a great location. I still miss Zen 32 though,"}
{"text":"I went with a larger party, which was planned more than week in advance and was incredibly disappointed in the service provided. The server knew prior to us ordering drinks and sushi that we would want separate checks at the end. We informed him of this to ease the process for him. Not only did he completely disregard this gesture, he took everyone's sushi order randomly, causing chaos for himself and us. Multiple people had to reorder their drinks because our server \"forgot.\" Plates of sushi we didn't order came out, and we sent them back. One person's wine glass had a red lipstick stain on it when it was brought to the table. When we asked for a new glass because it was visibly dirty, the server looked at us like we were crazy. When the checks came, our server got it all wrong. Multiple people were being charged for items they did not order, and the checks were given to the wrong people. When we called to slightly alter the reservation, the hostess gave us a hard time for doing so. One of the hostesses was so rude to me in person for asking her to hold a gift bag behind the host stand that had plenty of room, I did this to keep the walk ways clear for servers. They didn't even have a manager's business card for me when I asked. When I called the following day to speak with the manager he was very insincere. I'm extremely disappointed because I've had positive experiences at this location over a year ago, guess they've gone downhill."}
{"text":"Great customer service!
I was seated at the bar (after speaking to the delightful hostess' even though it's self seating at the bar), but I was greeted immediately and given a menu within minutes. It's a great friendly atmosphere and of course in the beautiful Biltmore area. 

The shrimp tempura wasn't bad (not the best I've ever had, but good for the Happy hour) & the spring rolls were pretty good-the mustard sauce that comes on the side definitely has some wasabi in it! Ha so it was spicy, but not overbearing. 

They have great Happy hour specials- half price on many things! 

& they have Wifi!

I'd recommend this place & definitely come again :)"}
{"text":"Very cool atmosphere, good food and drinks, but the service was just ok.  They seemed to be bothered that customers were there."}
{"text":"The sashimi bowls are beautiful and the green tea soba noodles were delicious. The noodles were just a bit overcooked liked they had been sitting in water for a few minutes too long."}
{"text":"Love the food, the attitude and atmosphere, but the service is pretty mediocre. Everytime I order my food to go, they never bring it out. I always have to ask for it which is pretty unfortunate considering the unknown amount of time it will take to get the food without looking like an anxious annoying customer. I also sat in a couple of times and its nice if you already know what u want and order everything up front because to get your waiter to order something else, takes a lot. I am not too thrilled about this place, but it's near my house, in a good area, and the food is great and prices are decent. Of course, ill keep coming back."}
{"text":"I am so behind on writing reviews... I really need to catch up!  I came here for Gabi's bachelorette party.  Stingray has great energy for a party right next to us was another bachelorette party... see??
Anyway the drinks and sushi were great!  I cannot forget to mention the service... our waitress was great she handled our party of 8 like pro.  I will definitely be back here again.  Thanks Stingray for making the start to evening wonderful!!"}
{"text":"This place is terrible. They messed up our orders multiple times and then overcharged everyone at the end of the meal. The waitresses were also rude and unprofessional. We didn't have silverware even after we received our food and it took forever for it to come. They didn't even offer to comp us at the end of the meal after everything. I will never come back here. It's hands down the worst place I've ever been to."}
{"text":"So happy Stingray is here in Ahwatukee.  The place looks great and the service is excellent.  Everything is great from the Miso Soup to the Godzilla roll.  Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I give them 2 stars because of service. I sat at the bar and there was no bartender. To be honest, this was irritating. Then I saw a guy sitting at the bar. He looked like a customer because he was sitting there buried in his phone. It took him forever to serve me and give me a menu so I had to deduct the tip. How do you let customers sit there without even acknowledging them? I think that's unacceptable. Also, they need to learn to fill their soy sauce containers. Maybe if they actually worked instead of sitting around texting it would be better. Who knows if I'll give them a second chance. It wasn't even busy at 4:30 on a Tuesday so there was no need to ignore your customers like that."}
{"text":"The sushi was mediocre at best. My wife and I were not impressed. My fresh water eel was burnt to a charcoal crisp! It was black and scraped the insides of my cheeks when I tried to eat it! I spoke to the manager Tom who said that he was new and would have to wait for him to find out what to do as far as a refund for just the eel or if he could only give me a $7 gift card to come back and have some more mediocre sushi. I have spoken to him 5 times in a week and he keeps telling me that he will call me back. TERRIBLE!!! We will NEVER go there again!"}
{"text":"I have been here quite a few times and have always loved it. But this last experience has me rethinking this place entirely. First of all, why would you only have one waiter on staff on a Sunday? We waited for a solid 20 minutes before even placing our drink order. We were finally able to flag someone down to get our drink/appetizer. Honestly, we should have just left at that point. We then waited another 20 minutes for our appetizers just for them to bring out the wrong thing. Absolutely ridiculous. 40 minutes to get edamame and vegetable tempura is crazy. The sushi was fine. Nothing special but no real problems there. After eating, we waited another 25 minutes just for the check. This was after he told us it wasn't possible to split it. Even though we placed the sushi order on two separate papers, making it extremely easy to split. It's sitting right in front of you and you're telling me you can't split the check? Ridiculous. Horrible experience."}
{"text":"The new Stingray location at Scottsdale Quarter makes a nice addition to the growing restaurant scene in North Scottsdale. Entire walls slide open in the bar area to bring the outdoors in. The decor is very sophisticated and the whole place is extremely clean (one of the benefits of being 2 weeks old). I had a nice lunch here today.  As usual, I had the lunch sashimi combination. At $15 the sashimi combo at Stingray is $2 more than the same dish at RA (across the street in Kierland), however the Stingray combo had a side cucumber salad and the miso soup here was more rich and flavorful than the miso at RA. Although they are very close, RA seems to provide more fish but I like how Stingray's slices are a bit shorter and thicker than the slices at RA making the fish more manageable with chopsticks. 

I also like how the bar at Stingray is very deep front to back. I felt like I had more room for my elbows, iPhone, book, sunglases, etc... and didn't feel like I was right on top of the bartender as she sliced lemons. The service was adequate and friendly. I would come here again."}
{"text":"Sushi and birthdays go hand-in-hand. I returned to Phoenix just in time to hang out with my friends for my birthday and they took me here. This place gets packed during happy hour for their half-priced sushi rolls and great drink specials. 

Stingray is a beautiful restaurant in a high-class location. The patios are spacious and there is a lot of seating indoors too. 

The sushi is well made and I will return...however, during happy hour. The prices jump up and the place gets empty once happy hour is over."}
{"text":"Happy hour at Stingray blows me away. It's normally a very expensive sushi place, so it's great that they offer such a great mix of things on their list. They have some of the best yellowtail sashimi in town and I love me some quail eggs. To get Happy Hour prices, go between 3-7. If you can't make it, it's still worth it. Sushi is great, but be prepared to spend some mulah."}
{"text":"I found sushi in a hopeless place :') I admit, the only sushi I really eat here is the sashimi in conjunction with their creative appetizers that keep me coming back. My absolute favorite is \"Japanese-inspired\" and most definitely Americanized - the Spiny Cheek Grouper. The fish is moist, tender, breaks away easily and sits on a bed of garlic mashed potatoes, which is then drizzled with a gravy that has hints of soy sauce, mushrooms, ginger, and sugar. The first bite is like an explosion, but it is an extremely savory dish; in fact, borderline salty, so make sure you balance it with a side of refreshing sashimi.

Appetizers and drink items alike (though, not the sushi) are interesting and intriguing, so this is definitely a great spot for the adventurous samplers who also enjoy a nice ambiance. The decor is trendy and chic, as is the drink menu with orchids and fresh fruits that adorn the admittedly strong refreshments.  Lounge chairs outside also make it a great spot to relax and hang out over a good meal.

This is a great location to grab a bite to eat, chat, and go shopping afterwards at the Biltmore shopping area."}
{"text":"5 stars for food quality. Their specialty Sushis are on the expensive side but worth every penny. 
5 starts for service, waiting, and decor. 
We have been coming to this establishment quite some times now and have enjoyed the food every single time. Everything on the menu is half off on Sunday's."}
{"text":"This is the perfect example of a time I wish there was a 'half star' policy. That doesn't happen to me very often as I'm rather opinionated and deliberate and honestly, in the interest of maintaining those qualities, I just can't give Stingray 3+ stars...so 2 it is. 

Where to begin.
The food was fine...  Choosing to dine at a place like Stingray, I'm well aware of what I've signed up for. Meaning pedestrian, cookie cutter, 'safe' sushi, with lots of rolls covered in some form of mayo or sweet eel sauce. Nothing you can't douse in loads of wasabi soy sauce and call 'okay'.  Very RA-esque or Kona style stuff we're talking about here. I actually like that kind of easypeasy 'sushi' sometimes. Just bring me more wine so I can google eye at my fiance across the table and we're fine. That said, the experience was still severely lacking in many areas. 

Someone needs to tell the staff at Stingray that it's no longer 2004. Everything from the decor to the servers uniforms to their air of pretension screamed mortgage boom. A time when everyone thought they were millionaires in training, had $850 a month car payments, raging strip club habits and not a lick of common sense. Guess what guys, those days are long gone. 

The service was just plain not good. Think pretty and vapid. All style (though, honestly, there was no real 'style' going on) and no substance. What I can only assume was the manager dropped our check off and didn't  look in our direction or say a word. It was rude and weird, almost as if we should feel special to be ALLOWED to dine in their establishment. Our server appeared to be pretty young and I try to give a little leeway to the young and dumb but it was pretty evident that the young part was coincidental. She was a dolt, complete with eyes rolling around in her head like creepy little black marbles....ugh. How this girl has survived on the planet this long is beyond me, what with busy streets to cross and rohypnol availability and all. I dunno, the whole thing was just uncomfortable and strange. Luckily as soon as we walked out the door all was restored with the universe. It was 2011 again, we were all poor, people were still being foreclosed on and I was still 35...meh. Whatever, I was glad to be living in the present and I doubt I'll time travel via Stingray Sushi again anytime soon."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with a co-worker.  Great place for a fast Bento Box.  The food was fresh and the server was very pleasant.

I had the Teryaki chicken Bento Box with Vegetable Tempura which comes with Miso Soup, Salad, Cucumber Salad and rice.  The chicken has a mixture of veggies cooked into the sauce.  All in all I am leaving very full.

The lunch cost me just shy of $20 which included a drink with tax and tip.  I consider this to be on the higher end of a quick lunch during the week, but will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Friday night Happy Hour is by far one of the best happy hours in Phoenix.  It's 3-7pm and the prices for suhi, tempura and cocktails are AWESOME.  It's definitely a people-watching place....as the crowd seems to change from week to week.  The deographics varies WIDELY which makes it totally fun.....there's people in suits, 20, 30 40 somethings, gay/straight, cougars, shoppers, out of towners...the list goes on and on.  Always a great vibe and friendly service.  Not to mention some of the best looking bartenders in Phoenix.  By 5pm the place starts to get crowded....and by 5:30pm its packed.  I would highly recommend this place for happy hour."}
{"text":"People either love this place - or hate it. Personally, I love it. I think it is the best happy hour in town which goes later that most. Friends have complained about the lack of service but I have personally never experienced bad service."}
{"text":"I love visiting Stingray Sushi. I have to admit this is probably the best fresh fish I have ever had! I love sushi and I have been to many places but the variety of different rolls are exceptional. 

We usually sit at the are and are served with complementary miso and edamame. The miso soup is a little on the salty side but it is quite delicious if you don't mind that. The specialty rolls are a must try. The Cabo Blanco roll has salmon, spicy tuna, cucumbers, avocado, crab mix topped and halibut on top with ponzu sauce! This combination is delicious. I also tried the cucumber wrapped Maki. I thought that was unique and very fresh tasting. The sushi taste even better with a cold Sapporo on the side, I definitely recommend adding that.

The service was also great and a reason I keep coming back to Stingray. The waitresses check up on you and are knowledgable of the menu. No problems here with that!

Every time I visit somewhere I want to feel comfortable and Stingray has great decor to make this happen. The ambiance is good for dates special occasions or a casual dining out. The dark walls and textured bar wall is a great addition to the space. The lighting is dim and sets the tone of the restaurant. I love the long lanterns hanging and the chandelier in the front entrance!"}
{"text":"I'm putting this place on BLAST! Me and my wife came in because we got the email about some great happy hour specials they have. But they are sneaky, they don't give you a sushi sheet with happy hour deals only they give you one with everything so if you make a mistake you get to pay full price :). SNEAKY, SNEAKY. The waitress goes over our order and everything we got was on special accept I accidentally marked 1 yellow tail instead of Spicy yellow tail, so it was $6 instead of $3. Common sense would tell the waitress that we only wanted happy hour specials but I guess common sense is not that common for this one. Also the Sushi was prepared ahead of time and my wife ended up getting SICK! This is just another little hipster Sushi joint that blasts Trendy music and only hires Hot trendy waitresses.I'd rather go to Hiro and skip all the Flash!"}
{"text":"I liked the restaurant creativity, the entrance door , the seating and the vibe the place gives. The chef from detroit is very engaging, and the staff is very friendly. 
Salmon, yellow tail and octopus were good , tuna, sea urchin and salmon roe were average, I hoped to get more sophisticated selection of sashimi and sushi."}
{"text":"Another business trip, another restaurant at Scottsdale Quarter, the mall that is just down the street from the hotel I stay at near the Scottsdale airport when I'm visiting my crews in AZ. 

I liked this place, but it was really loud, especially compared to the other restaurants in the area. Food was good - nothing I would kill for, but I'll come back again. 

I did have a couple of issues: the food delivery waiter accidentally dropped my food off at the next table. Luckily, they were nice and pointed it out to me right away. Second, on the day I was there, the place was only about 1/3 full, and they seated people right next to me, instead of one table away. I'm not talking about they had a section closed and so everyone was in one section, I mean that in the section we were in, there were 5 tables, and they used 1,2, & 3 instead of 1, 3, & 5, and, as a result, the staff kept bumping in to the tables and messing up orders, and we all were in each others business since we were right next to each other. 

The place is usually pretty crowded at that time, so they may have been expecting more people, but really?"}
{"text":"is nice for a relax date or get together with ur friends... is laud so u must scream a lil bit to be heard HA... sushi is very nice, drinks r so good, the service is also good. good looking place
in the week days, from 4-6 sushi/alcohol happy hr... damn is nice... but be prepare it gets packed and is a long way waiting, so get there early to be sit at 4...."}
{"text":"Again, we've been on an epic sushi expedition since moving here, trying to find GOOD sushi in Phoenix.  So far, the best has been Sushi on Shea in Scottsdale. However, friends recommended Stingray, so off we went.

Now, we are definitely not this trendy. No Sir.  We felt quite a bit out of place, and while I did like most of the decor (walking over fish looking up my skirt was a bit awkward), some of it was too much. Also, the hostesses wore nothing to differentiate them; it was like being in the emo-ville section of ASU.

Stepping in, we waited a good 5 minutes before we were sat. Once sat, our server took her time coming over too. Between the initial service and the prices, we were pretty unimpressed. Also, the lack of vegetarian sushi options was kind of disappointing.

However, the food, once ordered, was delicious. The iced tea was super tasty, and my partner got a crunchy roll and a spicy salmon roll.  She said both were the freshest she's tasted since we moved here.  Due to the lack of veggie-friendly sushi options, I opted for the Udon soup with a soy broth. Granted, it came out about 10 minutes after my partner's sushi did, but it was worth it. Veggies, noodles and a DELICIOUS broth made it well worth the $12, and I was definitely full.

Will we come back? Yes, but not too frequently. The pricing is a bit high, and we're way too un-trendy for such a place, so Sushi on Shea will be our go to, affordable place. However, for a once in a while date night sushi place, Stingray will top the list."}
{"text":"Service was mediocre and it wasn't too busy for a Saturday night. We ordered tuna nigiri, spicy tuna rolls and the king crab. Crab was good but the spicy tuna rolls were small and nothing special. The tuna nigiria was also pretty standard run of the mill. If I'm going to spend that kind of money would rather go elsewhere though like Sakana."}
{"text":"Stingray was pretty good, but lacking in a couple areas... but what was good was good enough to give them another try.

Starting with the food we had:  the grouper cheek appetizer with Asian mushrooms was absolutely scrumptious.  Never had food served over mashed potatoes in a sushi place but this dish worked.  The fish melted in our mouths, the mushrooms had that nice bite you get from dried shrooms, and the sauce was savory and satisfying.  Next:  Recovery Roll, something they say the proceeds go to the Japan quake relief effort.  I'm not big on rolls but this one was very nice, spicy tuna is the star and the supporting cast makes this a good roll for the money.  and YES!  Toro was available, pricey at $19 but the fatty tuna was sensational.  What surprised us was that they were out of Ama-Ebi (shrimp w/ heads) and Uni (urchin), two staples of any sushi feast.  really disappointed. 

Server was personable and friendly, but occasionally inattentive.  Request for water was forgotten, and request for water refill was forgotten.  probably the weakest part of our experience.

Decor is beautiful and comfortable, and I disagree with the poster who said the inside tables are too close together... that encourages interaction with other diners which I love when dining out for sushi.

So I will go back, but if the \"sorry we're out of that\" theme persists, it will be the last time... please keep the water topped off..."}
{"text":"The food was very good.   Our waiter was slow though.   A big hit for travelers is that they don't want to split checks.   However the manager was very helpful in getting it resolved.   She turned what was an unfortunate owner policy ( of course the computers can split the checks) into a good ending.  I would visit again if I knew separate checks would not be a problem"}
{"text":"Really really great food with great service! The inside is beautiful the music is nice and let's not forget the amazingggggggg food! We got a few tacos on special.. Amazing cheescake.. Amazing sushi was fresh just overall amazing!!!"}
{"text":"This review is for the Bento box lunch, $10, even on weekends. Miso Soup, and your box comes with whatever entree you choose, a pickled veg salad, rice and a mixed green salad topped with some sort of Caesar esq dressing. Not too Scottsdale snobbery, cool decor, still get a kick over their floor aquarium."}
{"text":"OMG! sushi left on the counter for 30 minutes, then served to us as though it was just made freshly? i think not! the sea eel didn't even look suitable for a photograph, but not wanting to be fussy, i tried it, and quickly spit it out! this place is more of a 1 time visit. i've been several times, and still am not impressed. that was the last try, i hope to never be starved for sushi and stuck by that place again. the service sucks at the bar, it was the bartender who served up the sour sushi too! steer clear from here, you've neen yelped! oh and the big fish tank in the floor? its not all that. although the decor keeps bringing me back-it makes me forget all the previous visits-then i quickly remember when i'm waiting for the sushi.

one things fer sure, if ur looking for all those candy pushers, with the burned out Ed Hardy clothes, plastic booby flashing bleached blondes or euro-transplants looking to do anyone that will get them somewhere, well there you go....because its all there."}
{"text":"AWESOME HAPPY HOUR!!!! My family and I make a trip to Stingrays about once every 2 months, and we always go during happy hour.  Good sushi, rolls, drinks, and even stuff for my 2 little ones that don't enjoy seafood. They have great seating indoors and outdoors, a nice bar, and we enjoy ourselves weather its a family trip or time for just me and the hubby. I would definitely recommend this location."}
{"text":"Wow. The only word that I can use to describe the sushi here is terrible. It was totally tasteless, and that after I waited 30 min (10 extra) to get takeout. I was almost suckered into getting a drink at the bar waiting the extra 10 minutes... $25 was enough for the two tasteless roles and cold edemame.

It is a very chic space and I would imagine the ambiance would be nice for a happy hour or date. However, I just can't get over the sushi."}
{"text":"Best Sushi!! a little expensive... but awesome... We moved to chicago and I even took some of their roll recipes for people to make me, because theirs really are the best!"}
{"text":"I love the vibe at Stingray...but know when you go what your getting into... its Scottsdale! People watching good... crowds YES! Stood in the bar over an hour waiting for a table...getting bumped and hit on as if the nite had started early... And it was hot ... as in , turn up the ac! 
Ive never liked the table set up in Stingray... they crowd them together..but okay if your going with friends and you know that going in! Sushi is okay..but again... Ive had better... They give an option of low carb rolls... love that.."}
{"text":"Just like some others have said, the word that comes to mind is Sexy... i actually like this place a lot. Very nice and fancy and not as expensive as you would think. I believe in quality and price going together but this place is surprisingly reasonable. Valet and validation available, curteous staff, great sushi, great bar... it is very good."}
{"text":"This is the most inconsistent restaurant I've ever been to. Sometimes it's very good and others, it's average -- and at this price point average quality and service isn't acceptable.

If you have an issue with anything here, be prepared to explain yourself. #customerservicefail"}
{"text":"Was not expecting much from a sushi spot in AZ and if one of our friends wasn't about to take the 9 month no sushi ban to have a kid we probably would have kept driving.  This place is really nice inside and has plenty of patio seating also.  The service was great and the food was not phenomenal but decent.  The lollipop sushi was refreshing and fresh but most of the menu was a little on the steep side price wise.  Good location, which is what brought us in being front row at some open air shops.  If you have to eat sushi in AZ then Stingray is a viable option, being open later than most other spots helped also!"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place before our flight back home and we just so happened to visit during happy hour! We ordered simple items like the crunchy tuna, crunch roll, and the spicy crab roll, saki bomb specials (all from happy hour list)..and for the most part, everything was good, especially considering the prices. The sriracha edamame was definitely my favorite! They have an extensive happy hour list which is always nice and our server was great. I like the ambiance and it seems like one of the places that gets really busy on Friday/Saturday evenings. It's a place I would consider revisiting if I'm ever in the area again."}
{"text":"This place has a great atmosphere and an excellent happy hour.  Awesome drink and sushi prices.  The dragon roll is my favorite, but there are plenty of specials to choose from, and their sushi is pretty good. 

The location is great too, close to all the shopping in Scottsdale Quarter.  Definitely a good place to stop in for a sushi happy hour!"}
{"text":"My experience so far; Daniel at the bar was swamped but he was very polite and apologized for our wait.  However,  I was disappointed to see a multitude of tables outside and about 7 inside that were not occupied  and yet we were told it was a wait for both areas.  The food was ok, but I will not return because of the lack of staff, no low sodium soy, no water offered and it took too lobg to try and ask for some.  Also they said they could not substitute the pink soy in place of the seaweed to make it easy for my boy to eat.  I've always been offered all of the above at other places."}
{"text":"This place rocks! The food was delicious, but what really made it great was our server Tara. She gave us great recommendations for new foods to try and she answered all the questions we had about the menu. We will definitely be back for the food and Tara!"}
{"text":"Decided to have dinner here on Friday, Received the best customer service I've received in a while!  Jane was our waitress, she was soooo awesome, made sure we liked our food and drinks, was willing to let us exchange if we didn't like it.  We were also able to get complimentary samples of drinks!  Great time, when I go back I defintely hope Jane is there!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in old town. Freshest fish and the rolls wrapped in cucumber are a dieters' dream! I highly recommend the lollipop, morning dew, lava roll, godzilla. Sea urchin looks weird but it's delicious. Sashimi is fresh and perfectly sliced. Shrimp sumai dumplings are a great starter. I also love the calamari. The service has definitely gone down over the years. The servers are less attentive and the hostess's are passively rude. Happy hour is a great time to go if you want to try a bunch of different items. I also love their unique cocktails but the are pricey."}
{"text":"i still miss Zen 32!  i really like the vibe insides but everytime i go for sushi at stingray my pocket book is much lighter and i leave wanting more and better.  

the deck that they put in is freaking amazing and they have a pretty good HH."}
{"text":"Stingray is my absolute favorite sushi restaurant. Their fish is so much more fresh, and have more creative rolls than RA. I rate this place a 5 for everything on their menu. I have seriously tried a ton. But service, on the other hand, is more like a 2. They are nice WHEN they chose to come around. Just be aware that you're going in and getting great food but you won't see much of your server. It's worth it, though. 

My favorite rolls on the menu that you must try are the cabo blanco roll (served with halibut and pico de gallo on top), the morning dew (wrapped in soy paper with soy mustard sauce), lobster ceviche and the new lobster soy paper roll. If you are going in there and don't know what to order, those are the best pieces on the menu, I promise."}
{"text":"Stingray is like almost every other sushi place in the Valley, which is to say it is high-priced for what you get and not especially impressive. It's become our default because it's close by and they have raw fish, but the fact that the Chipotle-esque How Do You Roll? is giving Stingray a run for its money on our sushi budget should say something. And not anything good.

At the very least, go at happy hour. You'll feel better about your spending, and you'll leave sated."}
{"text":"I like the ambiance, this is our first time visiting and decided to come here to celebrate our 6 years anniversary but they destroyed the celebration, awful customer service, I asked waiter for suggestions since we haven't been here and he sounded frustrated and rolled his eyes and even dropped the line \" have you even ever had Sushi? After that I just ordered what yelp reviews recommended. Ordered Vegas roll and was good but not amazing, my husband ordered spicy crispy tuna and it was literally 4 smalls 1\" pieces and not great. Got the Check as soon as we finished our meal and made reservations for another restaurant to get in a better mood"}
{"text":"I have been to Stingray a trillion times (actually only about 12 but a trillion sounds cooler). Not once in those past 11 times has it been more awesome then this last time. I made reservations for a big party but wasnt positive on the exact number. I felt bad, but the hostess assured me there wont be a problem sitting 6 or 20 people. Even when I arrived and still didnt have a definate number. As people started to show up we could gauge the finalized number was going to be 15. Now the place wasnt crazy busy but it was dead. The staff arranged a few tables and we started the fun. The second the server came to our table, you could see the joy/anxiety in his eyes. He knew he was going to get a fat tip but he knew he's have to work for it with 15 of us.  We are all heavy drinkers and the first drink order might have been a record breaker. Sake shots, beers, mixed, and fruity girly drinks covered every inch of the table. The server offered waters but didnt get any responces. We were here to drink and eat. Drink and gorge we definently did! Everyone passed around the sushi sheet and maked what they wanted. Nobody questioned the amount that was being marked until the 12th plate of rolls was placed on the table. Now I'm not a huge fish lover, but I will dominate any sushi thats in front of me. The only thing I didnt eat this night was some aweful looking lobster tail stuffed with onions and other shit. I about vomitted. After hundreds of rolls (probably really like 20), I was completely stuffed, as everyone else were too. This was the moment of truth. We all knew we did some damage but how much? The server skipped with glee to our table and gently placed the check. Without even opening the thing, we knew it was alot. The length of the check stuck out of the book about 3 foot (actually about an inch). I took charge and opened this bad boy up...$765 + the autograd of $153 (20%).  No wonder our server was skipping with joy. I bet he had a stiffy he was so excited. Nobody was shocked or angry we had spent this much. All-in-all this was one of the better sundays meals we have had. But definently not our last. The food was SO good. Service was excellent. And the prices were extremely reasonable. Stingray will always be on my list of favorite sushi places"}
{"text":"Great service amazing atmosphere! Portions could have been a tad larger with a little better presentation but other than that great tasting!"}
{"text":"The night I came here, the fish just seemed old.
And stinky.
And it tasted bad.

I will not return to eat.  Maybe to drink, but definitely not to eat."}
{"text":"Very upset about this place. My group of 8 coworkers came for lunch to celebrate my bosses birthday and all of us were excited to eat sushi. Well, we were excited but it did not feel like anyone from Stingray wanted us there. It almost seemed like we were a nuisance to them. Our server was rude and not friendly. No one went out of their way to make sure our table was doing okay. Not to mention we spent close to $800 by the end of lunch. The bartender was also inconsiderate. Our whole group was extremely disappointed with this experience.

I hardly ever give 1 star to a restaurant but when the experience is this bad, it must be known."}
{"text":"One of the better sushi restaurants. The sushi could be fresher. I like the entrance and the excessive outdoor seating. The wait isn't normally too bad and the happy hour rocks."}
{"text":"Not bad.

I wasn't necessarily impressed with Stingray, but I didn't hate it either. Not horrible; not phenomenal. I'd say it's by and large very average -- right in that meaty part of the curve, not showing off, but not falling behind either.

The Godzilla Roll was pretty delicious, I must admit. If you're reading this review from inside the restaurant, then order it immediately. The rest of the sushi I had that night didn't stand out. Even the spicy rolls seemed a bit bland.

We were a really big party, so it's tough to accurately gauge the staff; but from what I can tell it was also very average -- not overly attentive and helpful, but not rude or invisible either.

Overall, I'm in no hurry to return, but I wouldn't protest vehemently against it either, should someone suggest going to Stingray again. It is exactly what 3 Yelp Stars says: A-OK."}
{"text":"Came for lunch and the service wasn't great.  The food was OK.  I had the sashimi Benito box. The miso dressing on my salad was watery and bland. I guess they forgot the seaweed salad I ordered.  I told the waitress and she didn't even apologize or ask if I wanted it.  When she brought the bill, she said \"I took it off the bill for you\" with a big smile, like she did me a favor.  Of course she took it off the bill, I never got it."}
{"text":"best in the area, but pricey.. nice decor, if it weren't so pricey we would go much more often .. due to how pricey for what it is, hard to justify going more than once in a while"}
{"text":"Stingray was understaffed the day we showed up with a party of 6, and we all wanted separate checks. Pretty sure they weren't too happy with that, but they were so accommodating and professional. The food was great, but I really wanted to give a shout out to Nick, our server, who dealt with the understaffing and our larger group like a pro. Thanks!!"}
{"text":"Took my wife to Stingray for lunch on Thursday.  I ordered the king crab nigiri.  Both my wife and I took a bite and noticed the crab was extremely fishy and tasted sour. I smelled the other piece and it was spoiled. It was too late since we already downed one piece, that we shared and sent the other piece back. The waiter said it was not good. Well, it's Friday night and we are both sicker than dogs.  Needless to say, my wife and I will not go back."}
{"text":"I'm not a sushi fan but I've been here a few times & always order miso soup, shrimp tempura & chicken teriyaki. This time was no different. Service was okay, nothing spectacular. A few hours after I got home I started feeling a little sick. The next day I was throwing up & had diarrhea. I didn't think it was stingray bc I had ate there with no problem. I had chicken teriyaki leftovers in the fridge & my mom ended up eating it. She ended up with the same symptoms so that's how I knew it was the chicken. I wrote stingray an email & never received a reply. Not even an apology. Maybe their sushi is worthwhile but I for sure won't be able to stomach the chicken again."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. Great for all sushi and non-sushi lovers.  

Service was great, atmosphere is relaxing and modern, and the food is delicious. My group and I ordered the spring rolls, gyozas, shrimp tempura rolls, chicken teriyaki, and lobster tempura. All absolutely mouth-watering. The lobster tempura actually feels like it's melting in your mouth it's so good. 

Our server was so nice and very attentive. 

This place is now on my regular circulation of restaurants. I can't wait to come back for happy hour."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi restaraunt in AZ. I'm not actually into sushi and this place always has the best sushi for people who do sushi for the social aspect. Always busy at peak times so plan ahead if you don't want to wait. Crispy Spicy Tuna and Cabo Blanco Roll are my favs! Pico de gallo on sushi? Weird but amazing...."}
{"text":"I will start by the one positive: the service was great. Friendly, very knowledgable and attentive waitstaff. Positive ends there. 

The sushi is mediocre. I have had much better sushi for considerably less money (see Kona Grill happy hour). My all-time favorite roll is the Unagi roll. I was very disappointed with Stingray's Unagi roll. Also, I asked if they could make a Skinny Mojito since I didn't see one on the menu (again, Kona makes the BEST Skinny Cucumber Mojitos I have ever had for $6 each). The waitress checked and finally returned with a cloudy, unappetizing looking mojito. It was decent, so I ended up ordering a second. This one came out tasting like pineapple juice and was horrible. I sent it back and received what tasted suspiciously like a regular (aka not sugar free) mojito. Plus they ended up being $10 each---NOT worth it. Tip included, the bill came to $86. I hate leaving restaurants feeling like the experience was a total waste of money. I will never go back to Stingray."}
{"text":"This is a favorite place of mine when visiting Scottsdale. Really. I've been there for a late lunch when it's quite empty/sparse and in the evenings when it's packed & crowded. Either scenario, I've had a great experience. The wait staff/bartenders have always been attentive & friendly to me & my friends. Perhaps it helps that when we're there during off-peak times, there is certainly more interaction with the staff and a rapport is established. Obviously that is a perk when it's crowded & busy in the evenings. 

It is what it is - Stingray is about the scene. The location, the decor, the ambiance. Some reviewers have mentioned that the sushi/entrees have been horrible; not \"authentic\", etc. Did they honestly expect \"authentic\"? I'm half Japanese/half Scottish, so I've been exposed to Japanese/Sushi all my life. Most sushi in the U.S. are made & geared toward American tastes. Some have said the food is comparable to RA. Generally it is, but I think it's better than RA. The RA menu in my opinion is \"watered down\" for the masses. I'm not critical when it comes to Sushi because \"authentic\" to me is what my grandmother makes. I do love the rock shrimp appetizer though. Various versions of this can be found at any Sushi restaurant, but Stingray's does it for me. 

Stingray for me means I'm visiting Scottsdale, hanging out with my friends and we are here to enjoy ourselves. Maybe my experience & view point would be different if I lived in the area and had the opportunity to dine there more frequently."}
{"text":"I am a regular at stingray sushi. my friends and I go there ALL the time. tonight we were there and we had the worst customer service I've ever experienced. her name was rachel and she didn't once check on our table. she also was irritated when we wanted to wait to order our sushi after the appetizers. never once did she ask how we were or make any sort of conversation with us. we will be back at stingray because of the quality of food but will be requesting anyone but rachel as a server."}
{"text":"My substantive consumer experience (http://www.yelp.com/guidelines) left me leaving this business thinking of better things to do with $50 than leave this place with an empty stomach and OK sushi."}
{"text":"I have been to Stingray in Biltmore several times. First of all the interior design of this place is wonderful. Food always good, though the bento boxes I wouldn't recommend- lack of flavor. yesterday I was disappointed. My plate was dirty, I grabbed another plate from a table next to me - it was dirty too... a big turn off. I don't know if the person responsible for that  was late to work but I decided not to come back. At least for some time..."}
{"text":"Boo! Sadly my update this time around was not a BIG hit! I have to give this restaurant kudos for good food but the time to get the food is not the best. A friend of mine and I dined here two days ago for dinner right before happy hour ended. So the two minute rule for a server to greet you was not the case this time. Luckily we made it in time to place our order to get the super happy hour pricing but once we sat down we had plenty of time to identify what we wanted, review other food from surrounding tables and do some small talk by the time we were waited on. When our server finally reached us we placed our food order when we ordered our drinks. We had hot green tea along with some hot appetizers and sushi. Our tea came out quick along with our appetizers which was the Chicken Yakatori. After eating the chicken and finishing up our second helping of green tea the waitress apologized for the wait. I understand Sushi takes longer and the restaurant was pretty busy inside and out though no waiting. It was immediate seating. But there were four people making sushi and we waited over 20 minutes after we were done with our appetizer. What is strange is my sushi was only a cucumber roll. With no complaints the server mentioned the manager had taken off our sushi since it took so long. As I mentioned the food is always good. They have a wonderful happy hour menu from food and drinks but this is defiantly a place that you need to plan on dining for a while. At least this is my experience from all of my visits."}
{"text":"This particular location is bigger than most and a hell of a lot busier! Get in there early because finding seating could be a challenge. Happy hour prices are good and the drinks were ok, but I swear the drinks were a smidge stronger at the other locations Oh well... did I mention GET HERE EARLY? Lol"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite happy hour in Scottsdale.  The setting is hip and modern, and happy hour is actually at a decent time from 3-7 pm.  I love the spicy tuna rolls, octopus nigiri, salmon nigiri, Hamachi Kama, and my wife's favorite their calamari tempura.    One indulgence that we go for pretty much every time were here is their chirashi as well.  At only $19, it is the perfect plate to share as you munch contently on all of the other great stuff.  Another great dish they serve here is the Ama Ebi.  Just a quick dip in boiling water, and then off with the shell and served on a pillow of sushi rice along with the deep fried crunchy head!  Excellent.  For around $9 its pricy for 2 bites of food, but it shows that this place isn't just about the decor.  There is some real talent being displayed here in this dish, and it's one that not a lot of sushi places in the valley do. The salmon skin roll here is also one of my favorites, to the horror of my server who tried to talk me out of it.  Either way, this place made me leave Ra across the way because I like the food better here.  The environment is also a lot better if you're wanting to have a an upscale experience for under $50 per person."}
{"text":"Great service, delicious food, awesome environment. I especially love the crab mozzarella, and the lobster tacos! 

Being a poor student and this place being pricey, I probably won't be around a whole lot, but it's definitely near the top of my sushi location list. Not to mention it's connected to Biltmore Park, which is absolutely beautiful."}
{"text":"This is a very average to above average sushi restaurant.  The bar is nice, seating is limited (like most sushi places).  The sushi is good, but completely unremarkable.  On par with Ra, but not in the same league as Sakana.  I agonized over a fourth star, but it was just so average."}
{"text":"I'm here right now, and the food is fantastic (best sushi in the valley), and the ambience is great, but the music is a little too loud.  The owner has a background in nightclubs so that's understandable, but it's not great for 12:30 on a Sunday mid-morning.
Update: they turned the music down and it's bearable.  Thanks a bunch, Stingray!
Update: the DJ turned it back up when he switched the song five minutes later."}
{"text":"We decided to do some sushi for dinner and this was the place recommended.  We happend to stop in while it was happy hour so we got half off sushi and appitizers.  We were very happy about that so we decided to try all types of stuff.  Lobster tempura street tacos were absolutely wonderful.  Ask for a side of thier spicy sauce for a little zip.  Otherwise we did the pork gyoza (potsticker), edamame (salted beans), and shrimp shumia..  
For sushi we tried the Las Vegas roll and Shrimp Tempura.  Everything was great and fresh.  We truly enjoyed our visit.  The place has a cool vibe to it.  They offer seating outside as well if you want to relax outdoors.  Thier staff was friendly and smiling, which is always nice to see.  Our waitress was very good.  We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant. Food was good especially the crispy rice with the spicy tuna. Love their Happy hour. We met the owner Brian he came over to our table to talk to us. The service is good too. Really fun place."}
{"text":"They have a great happy hour with 1/2 price drinks, appetizers and maki rolls. Loved the spicy tuna,  not so much with the spider roll"}
{"text":"I went here with a group of 8 last weekend.  I have been here before and had a pretty good experience overall, however this time was not good, particularly because of the service.  The waitress, in our opinion, knew she was getting the 20% (yeah, 20% is their standard which isn't cool), and didn't care to take care of us.  I'm a good tipper and will always tip 20% if justified, but this experience was not good.   She could have cared less about us and clearly made us feel that.  

Def not a good place for groups. And the food was just about average."}
{"text":"great for happy hour, not so sure about the dinner menu though.

the sushi is so tasty and you can get a lot of it for an even better price! plus the premium drinks are also half priced which means you can also get loaded without paying too much. hmm. can you tell why i came here?"}
{"text":"The hubby and I love to have date night here! Best spicy tuna rolled tacos!!"}
{"text":"Sitting at the bar. Took 5 to wave her down. So far waiting 23 minutes for edamame...asked her to check on it. Got cold edamame. No apology for the wait. Rolls and Nigeria came a few after, it was good.

It used to be such a cool place."}
{"text":"So, I have had sushi here quite a bit and have always been very pleased.  This is in comparison to having sushi all over the US and 4 years living in Japan-- I have some say in what good sushi is.  I am sad to say that this place has gone down, nose first.  I would say that they use to have the best Caterpillar roll I have ever had.  Now it is the worst.  Last night we ordered a Caterpillar, Philadelphia, and a Yellow Tail roll.  This had to be the worst sushi I have ever had, hands down.  The fish had no flavor and the fillings were just plain pathetic.  In the Caterpillar roll, which is supposed to have eel, there was almost no eel at all--we could not even see the eel, just a bunch of imitation crab.  This was brought to the attention of our waitress, who by the way is the only reason they are getting 2 stars and not 1 (she was polite, attentive and apologetic), who went to the manager about getting us a new roll.  When she came back we were told that they could make us a new one but it would have the exact same amount of eel in it, unless we wanted to pay for extra eel.  We chose not to have them make us more crap and they were \"kind\" enough to take it off the bill.  Not once did a manager come over to ask about what was wrong or to apologize.  I felt like they just really did not care about me enjoying their food or service.  As I said before, the waitress that we had was great and really took care of us.  If their sushi was as good as the staff, it would be great.  Sad to say I will be taking my money elsewhere!!!"}
{"text":"Always fabulous! The bento boxes are great! The Happy Hour Sushi and cocktails are all half price. We go here a lot."}
{"text":"ANOTHER 10+
Cynthia, is awesome, food and service are worth a return visit...  Great job to all."}
{"text":"Travel a lot for business and sushi restaurants are generally a good bet-you can sit at the counter, watch the chefs work (so you're not just staring off-trying not to \"look\" at anyone).  The sushi here was very good, not the best I've ever had but worth the trip.  The service was ok as well-not super but ok.  I would go back."}
{"text":"Great kiwi drink.  Great sushi had the dragon and las Vegas roll.  Nice patio but ask for new plates because plates on table ahead get a layer of dust."}
{"text":"Cute spot with a great happy hour! All appetizers, drinks, and house maki (sushi rolls) are half off and $2 tacos. I went in on Industry Sundays so it was all day long. They have hot sake in carafe at $2 so I think during HH they should only be $1 each. I didn't really check the prices but I know I walked out of there stuffed with leftovers and a little flushed for $40 between two people. The yellowtail maki was okay. It's not the freshest sashimi I've tried and it had more fillers than I would like but for half off, it was amazing. Same goes for the unagi maki. I really enjoyed the cucumber salad and the seaweed salad. Both dressings were light enough to not be overwhelming or take away the crisp of the salad ingredients. The soft shell crab was pretty small and there wasn't any sauce for it. The cabbage salad that it was on had a dressing but I didn't feel that it was the right type of salad to pair with soft shell crab; it should be some sort of vinaigrette.

It was a great vibe at the bar area with plenty of self seating. I took a look at the dining area and it was pretty breathtaking. The entire place just feels relaxing. There's an outdoor patio that's way too hot to sit out in during the day even with the mist but it felt really tropical in the evening. I believe the bar windows can open up to the patio and I can only imagine how much it would feel like being at a pool side bar. Definitely a great hangout spot!"}
{"text":"I admit that I am a sushi novice, but Stingray is so good that I have been expanding my sushi tastes. Try you will love it. I haven't found a better place yet!"}
{"text":"Sushi was ok, Crazyfish was WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY better. Service was great, placed an order as its one of the only sushi places that has sea eel, and the waitress came back to tell us that they ran out of sea eel... Not that its very famous or something a lot of ppl eat, which was weird and it was also one of the reasons we went there. 

Not sure if we'll come again, maybe next time we'll call ahead to make sure they have sea eel"}
{"text":"The service is slow and not good at all! It makes the experience not good. My family have been a few times for happy hour and finally decided we won't be returning. The food is alright too.. My brother in found a hair in his sushi one time."}
{"text":"Overpriced happy hour. Rolls tasted like the rice was cooked a while ago. Many rolls lacked any flavor, and the gyoza appetizer was mediocre at best. Just not that good."}
{"text":"Ok... my friends asked me to go, and I was a little too hungover for sushi. However their Bento Box was great and their Bloody Mary's were even better. Our waitress Bethany was attentive, flirtatious and real sweet. Sometime when I'm not so tipsy I'll be sure to try their sushi. Nice place, nice patio and nice service."}
{"text":"Bad.. 
Came here Tuesday night and initially I was very impressed. The decor was beautiful and me and my friend were seated immediately. It was kinda slow, so we expected our food to come out quickly. Food almost took around 20 minutes to arrive, and when it did we were unimpressed. I ordered the 2 piece mackerel nigiri, and my friend ordered a $15.00 roll, (forgot the name). 

We ended up getting 6 pieces of mackerel sashimi, with a bowl of rice (no complaints.. here.. more food for less money right? and the roll was really really small... like thinly rolled small and not worth the $$$ price tg. 

Ok whatever, so I'm eating the mackerel sashimi.. and I literally started choking on what I thought was ONE fish bone.. turns out there were 3 fish bones stuck in my throat and I had to HACK them out. My pretty plate setting after this looked pretty disgusting with hacked up fish pieces and bone. I told the server and showed her the bones she seemed pretty shocked, but didn't really offer any real solutions other than that she would tell the chef. 10 whole minutes later she returns with MORE mackerel.. and she said that the chef checked it super carefully this time around.

I told her I didn't want any more but she insisted it was safe... I took one careful bite, and what do you know? MORE FISH BONES. 

When she came back I told her AGAIN, and at that point she offered to get me something else (but did not tell me it would be on the house). I did not want to PAY more money to risk more fish bones in my mouth but I might have taken some cali rolls for free at this point cause I was STARVING, but I was honestly just irritated and wanted to get out of there. 

She ended up offering free mochi because there would be no fish bones in there.. and took the mackerel off the bill. We ended up paying $15.00 for a bad roll, and me almost ending up at the emergency room because of the TWO times I had to pull fish bones out of my mouth. 

Not worth it at all, but I guess it makes for a terribly cool, but still terrible story."}
{"text":"Good service and sake but sushi all came cooked to some extent and warm. Disappointing!  But will work for a late night dinner."}
{"text":"Definitely come for Happy hour! Prices are amazing, sake bombers for $3...Great atmosphere and wait staff was incredibly nice and right on to all of our needs, didn't have to ask for a thing They were always spot on...Place gets crowded in the evening especially if you plan on sitting outside. I only wish there were one in Apollo Beach or Brandon!"}
{"text":"Popped in on a Saturday late afternoon. We weren't worried about HH pricing, we were in the area shopping and needed nourishment. No one was at the host stand, no one was at the bar, and I mean no employees. There were customers scattered around but no employees. One gentleman finally came up after at least 5-7 minutes of us sitting at the bar. And he was not the bar tender. He was very nice and got right on getting us drinks and taking our order. We never eat at Stingray and after reading all the reviews talking about the service I don't think we will return because we agree with the reviews. We appreciate our server Howard and how good he took care of us, but whomever is managing this place needs a wake up call."}
{"text":"This is my family's favorite place for sushi in Scottsdale. Located in Scottsdale Quarters, Stingray offers and nice variety of rolls and solid appetizers for a dining experience that seems to make everyone happy.

My personal favorite is the Japengo (sp?) Roll, which features spicy krab, asparagus, and avocado, topped with tuna and a jalapeno slice. The bite of the jalapeno does seem to overwhelm the rest of the flavors a bit, but it's still a fantastic roll.

I also like the fact that they serve their calamari as strips instead of rings. They are always perfectly cooked (not overcooked!) and have a great meaty texture with light deep fried shell. Served with a spicy aioli, I have to order them every time I'm there.

My son loves the chicken skewers - nice tender chunks of breast meat cooked to perfection.

Stingray can be on the pricey side, given the portion sizes, but they do have a solid happy hour with half-priced appetizers and drink specials seven days a week.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"When you are out of town and in Scottsdale Stingray Sushi is one of my go to places to eat. It is a great place to meet friends and have an awesome lunch or dinner. Stingray Sushi has this very hip vibe going on when you first walk in and it can be a bit overwhelming but once you are seated the service is great. They bring you warm wash cloths to prepare for your meal. We ordered a few rolls but the Mango Tango and Lava Rolls were my favorite.

The service was good but when all the hostesses and waiters are very young they tend to socialize with each other and get caught up in drama that is going on between them so for this reason I gave them 4 stars.  I will say that I plan on eating at Stingray Sushi again once I am back in Scottsdale, it's good eats."}
{"text":"Awesome presentation on the food, beautiful place with a dj, awesome decorations, great happy hour until 6:30 every day and the food is delicious. Only my second time here trying to explore the menu. So far I highly recommend the shrimp tempura roll, spider roll, Las Vegas roll and the lobster tacos..."}
{"text":"Stingray Sushi has opened its brand new location in the ever-popular Scottsdale Quarter area.   Finding the door at Stingray Sushi is quite interesting, as it does not stand out quite at first, but once found is extremely unique!  Upon entering Stingray, you are promptly greeted by their hostess.  There is ample seating in their main dining area, bar area, sushi bar, or one of their outdoor dining areas.

Opting for the indoor main dining room experience was delightful.  Surrounded by modern contemporary décor, it lends itself quite spacious and open.   For dining at 5 p.m. in the evening, the music was light pop and easy to hold a conversation in the main dining room, which filled up fast during our time there.

Their menu comes complete with specialty drinks (including a drink aptly named \"Godzilla's Revenge\" for up to 15 people) as well as standard beer and wine libations.
Warm appetizers, as well as tempura, noodle and soup fare can be found at the start of their menu. 

For lunchtime, bento boxes can be ordered which always give a nice combination of rice, sushi, sashimi and meat.  Their Uno Sano Salad is a petite spring mix, with soy vinaigrette dressing, which is very, light and never tart.

For the main course, one can order one of their selection dishes or simply dive right into their fresh made sushi.  Their tuna tataki is cut into mouth watering thick slides, seared just lightly.  Their basic California roll, for those who remain on the lighter side for sushi, is generous within the roll's ingredients.  Cold, fresh and cut in easy to eat pieces. 

It is wonderful to see Stingray Sushi come to North Scottsdale.  Visit today for fresh sushi and hip yet comfortable surroundings."}
{"text":"Trendy trendy trendy.  

In other words:  a freakishly long wait to sit down, MUCH too loud music, shitty parking (I had my car towed out of a lot there once so beware, they show no mercy), stiff but pricey drinks, and PACKED with everyone you saw last Friday at Six.  I dont mind this kind of nonsense so I dont mind Stingray.

Their rolls, to me, are compareable to RA's.  A little weak, skinny and a bit overrated, but again, it seems to work for them. Outdoor seating in the winter is a great place to be since it overlooks Scottsdale road--instant entertainment. 

Go to Stingray more for the overall \"Scottsdale\" experience than for the food, or mediocre service."}
{"text":"I went here on my 2 year anniversary. The food looks really good, a very extensive menu and full bar. My only issue - I got food poisoning that night and threw up. Missed work the next day. I ate crab soup, seaweed ice cream and we split a mixed drink of tropical ingredients so it's hard to identify the culprit. The prices are outrageous and the servings small. The puking makes me want to run back to Kyoto Bowl for good cucumber rolls and better prices."}
{"text":"Stopped off at Biltmore Mall to get a bite to eat after my big iphone ordeal.  I have a new phone now so all is good, but it is surprisingly stressful to be without a cellphone even for a few HOURS. Yes, I'm that addicted to being on the grid.  Anyway.....

This is one of those fancy looking places sushi places where their location at the Biltmore mall is more of a plus than a detraction.  It's billed as a sushi place and indeed the sushi chefs I encountered all seemed to know their stuff. I sat at the sushi bar so I could hear then talking to the other customers about sushi selections and recommendations. 

Tip: if you eat at the bar you get complimentary miso soup and edamame. The cilantro in my miso soup was a nice surprise. I usually like more traditional Japanese tastes, but I can appreciate a little kick now and then. 
I was there early afternoon/evening and had a server who was in training. I had to have her re-do the check twice. The first mistake had and extra roll that I had not ordered.  And the second mistake was completely wrong, but at a 50% discount. I just want to pay what I'm supposed to pay so I called her attention to the bill a second time.   Aside from the those snafus, she was attentive  but she must have been really, really green as her nervousness was apparent. That's ok, everyone needs to start somewhere and she, at least, was trying smile a lot even though I'm sure she must have been stressed out.  

The sushi chefs though rocked and I had a good time. I find that if I need to dine alone if I'm out on business, sushi bar is the perfect place. If I'm back in Scottsdale anytime soon, I'm sure I'll go back to Stingray again."}
{"text":"Well...let begin with I Love Sushi and Stingray Used to be one of My Favorite places to go in the area. I moved here from the Pacific Northwest 10 years ago and I Know the taste of Fresh Seafood having been raised near the Oregon Coast! This evening my complaint isn't with the quality, taste or presentation of the sushi at Stingray that is still On Point there....
Here's the Derailment with the establishment....Service or the lack of it! 
On every occasion that I have dined there recently (not during Happy Hours) the service has been poor to down right hostile!!
Last evening (and Last Visit there I might add) here's how the evening played out....
We enter (both of us dressed professionally from work/I work at the Biltmore) and stand at the hostess area. There a young man is on the phone obviously taking an order....I was amazed that we stood there a good 5 minutes waiting for him to at least lookup and make eye contact, maybe mouth I will be right with you....Something!!! Nope! In the meantime several staff members strolled by not bothering to assist us or make eye contact. 
When our host finally finished his call, we asked if we seat ourselves or would he be assisting? I stated we would like a table outside...he proceeded to seat us inside (listening skills are terrible). I again stated if possible we would like to be seated outside. He seated us and immediately stated that there would be a wait on the orders placed due to a large group in the restaurant....
I stated that I was concerned because I noticed on Yelp that that's been a problem there and that if it was going to be a long wait like mentioned in some reviews we may want to reconsider. 
His response Blew Me Away!!!
****Yelp is a site for Sad Angry people who want to feel important and bash restaurants for their amusement or to retaliate when there meals are to expensive!!!!
Wow!!!! 
Not the smartest thing to say to an Elite member of Yelp!!
The service once seated was the usual issue that holds Stingray back and has probably lead to the closing of the Scottsdale Quarter location which I frequently went to due to it being by my other workplace (service was Always an issue there too)!! 
We waited for our server (pleasant enough) another 10 minutes...
We ordered our drinks and sushi together because I know the service takes a while and we were already told it would be a wait for the sushi to be prepared...
Drinks came quick but no offer of water....
Then rolls came at a timely manner (not the long wait I anticipated) but no wasabi or ginger to be seen....then we wait....nibbling edamame while we wait not wanting to eat our rolls without the condiments....another 5 minutes or more she comes back to check on us....
Basically, you have to drive the staff, wait for everything and ask for everything....
Wait staff should be On Point with anticipating the needs of the diner, pleasant and helpful. Here I feel like it's role reversal...
It's disappointing to see an established restaurant lose its passion for providing an experience that makes the client want to return. Perhaps the owner has moved on or has no interest anymore....but the lack of enthusiasm is apparent in the staff for sure!! 
***I am not a sad or angry person with nothing better to do than gripe. I work two jobs at very customer service oriented companies and I LOVE nothing more than writing Raving reviews directing folks to Great Places to Go here in Town!! Check out my reviews- they are most Always positive but I will write the Truth!! If the place lacks Heart & Soul and offers Poor Service...I'm commenting on it honestly to assist a company striving to learn from mistakes to improve. That's my hope anyway."}
{"text":"My best friend and I went for happy hour, the prices were great, and the food was excellent.  Our waitress was attentive and we always had full drinks.  Most places have scaled back their happy hour menus and we love that Stingray has so many choices.  We each had wine, plus 3 hot appetizers and 4 sushi rolls for less than $40."}
{"text":"So i thought with all the controversy surrounding this place, I would support the first amendment with my wallet. Unfortunately our experience here was subpar to say the least. We came in on a 3pm on Saturday and there was only one other couple inside. We were literally outnumbered by the people working there. I say this because somehow, despite this fact, the service was HORRENDOUS. I mean we got our order out fine, but our waitress dissappeared after that. At one point I had to almost get refills for us myself. The sushi itself was so overpriced for what it was. The Philadelphia roll was decent, but the California roll was really bad. When it came to paying, I put my credit card in the sleeve and waited for awhile. Despite there being no one else in the restaurant at this point except one other table, the waitress didn't return. If it wasn't for the cash I had on me I'd be waisting away there at this moment because she had no intention of returning and I have no intention of ingesting there food ever again!"}
{"text":"We came here on a fairly quiet night and had a nice expereince.  

Great sushi, cute atmosphere, and good service.  We rarely come here because there's a really excellent sushi place closer to home, but these folks served up great stuff.  We tried a cucmber-wrapped roll (love when that's on the menu!) and sashimi, as well as a fun roll, and it was all really well-prepared and tasty.  

The decor is really funky and trendy, plus they have a really nice patio.  It's a bit dark and trendy for my taste, inside - however, lots of people love that in an old town sushi joint, plus that's what they're going for and they're succeeding :-)"}
{"text":"Love the ambiance of the restaurant but had horrible service. My coworker and I came to eat for our hour lunch. Our server greeted us and got our drink order, water. We had gone through the menu and were ready  to order. I ordered the katsu pork bento with sashimi which was supposed to come with soup & salad. My coworker ordered the las Vegas roll and the salmon sashimi and were to share a squid salad as an appetizer. We arrived at 12:30pm, wouldn't have gotten our water if I didn't waive down the server at 12:45pm. A family had arrived around that time and was seated to our left. 1:10pm came around no soup, salad or the squid salad. Again I had to waive the waiter down to ask if we were getting the squid salad. He apologized and said he'd bring it right away. The waiter brought out the order of the family to the left's drink & one of their rolls, went to the kitchen & then brought the squid salad. 1:15pm, no soup or salad or my coworkers food. I didn't need to keep waiving the waiter down to keep asking to bring out meals that are to be served prior to the main lunch entree so I left it alone and waited to have our food served. 1:20pm still no food and we needed to leave soon. Mind you the place was not busy at all. I checked the bar side when we had left & it was empty. The tables behind us had a different server. We were so close to walking out and just paying for the squid salad. Not once did the server come to check on us or even notify us  of the status of our food. We got tired of waiting . I got up had to ask the sushi chef for a box for the squid salad, packed it and went up to the hostess to pay and leave since it was almost 1:30pm and no food yet. The waiter stopped us to tell us that the food was ready and he would box it. Long story, sorry ...but it was just irritating how horrible the service was.  Regardless we ended up paying for the to go and the nerve of the waiter saying you don't need to leave a tip when he handed our check!!! The pork katsu wasn't even that great. It was extremely dry."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a fantastic experience here.  We're from Chicago and were visiting AZ last month when we came across this sushi restaurant in Scottsdale.

The food was excellent!  Probably the best sushi and miso soup we've ever tasted.  

The service was friendly, prompt and efficient.

The prices were higher than what we're used to seeing for sushi, but since the food was so delicious the higher prices are worth it.

The ambiance was really nice and quiet.   I really liked the fish tank they had underneath the floor.  It was a cool effect.  

I will definitely be coming back next time we're in AZ."}
{"text":"Love the Happy Hour. Great selection! Lots to choices and very tasty. The ahi lettuce taco is  really good. Also love the crispy spicy tuna and Las Vegas roll. Great service and very trendy atmosphere.  Two patios and very nice bar space."}
{"text":"Worse service ever, hardly anyone in the restaurant and actually saw two separate tables get up and leave because they waited for over 20 minutes to have anyone even greet them.  Overheard a server say she didn't want to serve us because we were upset we waited 20 minutes to be even acknowledge that we were sitting at the table. Took 40 mins to get water and our salad. Won't be back anytime soon, too bad but poor service to make a restaurant go under awfully fast."}
{"text":"This place is an amazing place for timid to see what all the buzz is about sushi! I have been around the block w/ sushi. The fun thing about sushi is that its all about the rice and seaweed(nori). You don't have to eat raw fish, in fact my last visit i had a california roll sans the fake crab meat and enjoyed miso soup w/ a bowl of white rice. If you do eat fish, you can indulge in the different varieties (although no different than the usual sushi bar) of fish.  yellow tail is great, better spicy. The drinks are amazing too, but pricy. I'd suggest going at happy hour time and trying some of everything since it's half off."}
{"text":"After we worked up an appetite doing some holiday shopping, my family and I headed to Stingray Sushi in Scottsdale. We went during Happy Hour (2:30pm to 6:00pm, daily). All house Maki rolls, appetizers and tacos were half off. 

We ordered a massive amount of food. Given the pace that we were inhaling it, I wasn't able to snap pictures of everything. We got the standard assortment of rolls (spicy tuna, spicy salmon and yellowtail) and some fancy schmancy ones (spider roll and two (!!) Las Vegas rolls). I had some of the sushi and ordered some fun appetizers. We got the Rock Shrimp Tempura (fried shrimp covered in spicy mayo, amazing!), several tacos (lobster, tuna and rock shrimp) and Miso soup

The service was top-notch (constant refills of beverages) and there are three locations in Arizona (Old Town, Biltmore and Scottsdale). If you find yourself in Phoenix and want to enjoy some sushi, I highly recommend it. The Happy Hour is the way to go!"}
{"text":"Horrible service waited 10+ minutes to even see a server then we were given our menus to wait longer! Then we ordered our sushi which was gross! Never going back and would like a refund asked to speak to management but they were unavailable! Go figure! Save your $ and go to Sapporo!"}
{"text":"I have avoided trying Stingray only because of their Biltmore location.  I get lost in the poor excuse for the crazy parking lot that is part valet, part pay, part I don't know what, but I guess I get confused easily and just not a fan of the parking.  

I saw one of my Yelp friends check in at Stingray and thought I would be brave and try it.  I am basically cheap and was thrilled when I learned that they have happy hour  from 3 until 7pm.  Happy Hour Bombers are $5 and that makes me very happy as most places have raised the happy hour price to at least $6.  The fish tastes fresh as it should be and I could honestly eat my weight in $3 Salmon Nigiri.  

Sit at the sushi bar and you will also get at no charge an order of edamame, normally $4 and a bowl of Miso Soup.  

Prices off happy hour are expensive but who cares as long as you order before 7PM"}
{"text":"I went here recently for my girlfriends birthday.  I loved the sushi, my girlfriend and her friend didn't like the drinks, they each went through two before they ordered one they liked.

Also, maybe I am just old at heart or something, but why is the music so loud?  I hate having to talk really loud just to speak to the person next to me.

Ugh"}
{"text":"I thought I was going to be devastated when my old local sushi spot closed! Rest assured my Happy hour search has been remedied after coming to Stingray Biltmore. Monday thru Friday happy hour specials are just the ticket to make this girl UBBER happy. The staff is always professional and courteous and food comes out to perfection. I dined one Saturday night and the mere 15 minutes wait was worth the food coma!! Came hungry and left happy...will be back very soon for sure"}
{"text":"You know what I love most about dining out at restaurants? The combo of great food paired up with outstanding service! Stingray Sushi opened up their third Stingray at the Scottsdale Quarter and this new location is just as hip as the the others! Frequenting the Biltmore as much as I did, I found a nice refreshing atmosphere where the people watching is as good as the new drinks featured on the menu. The Tokyo Stock Exchange is MONEY and paired up with the Yuzu Sea Bass special, I swear I could eat and drink this everyday!

The menu - still serves up some of my favorite items (ie. the Cabo Blanco Roll sans the Avocado because of my allergy, and the Hamachi Ceviche) and the Happy Hour rocks 5 days a week!

I like the fact that Stingray changed up the interior to give the retro chic vibe into what has been a successful concept! Thanks for bringing a new hot spot in North Scottsdale and I can't wait to keep on dining here...in fact...thinking of stopping in this week.

Keep up the good work Stingray!!! *thumbs up*"}
{"text":"Favorite place for hh. Never had a bad roll, drinks are great and reasonably priced. They do get pretty slammed so be sure to go early. Great crowd too and good stop on your way ou in old town. Never been there but for hh, prices seem a little high"}
{"text":"Stingray has turned into my go-to spot for sushi in Scottsdale. Old Town is sushi-row but Stingray is trendy and equipped with a selection of tasty sushi, sweet cocktails and a fun atmosphere. Located in the heart of Old Town, it's a great spot to start the night off or visit for lunch if you're in the area. My eyes are bigger than my appetite but the sushi is so good, I always seem to finish whatever we order. Their cocktails are fresh and refreshing. They also have a great patio when the weather is nice enough to venture outside. 

Sushi Suggestions: Dragon Roll, Caterpillar Roll, Spicy Tuna Roll, Las Vegas Roll... I know sushi is supposed to be healthy but apparently my taste buds don't listen and I always order the fatty ones. 

Appetizer Alert: Start the meal with the seaweed salad. It's has just enough of a kick to it, but leaves you hungry for the main meal. 

Happy Hour: My favorite part about Stingray is their top notch happy hour pricing. You can eat a roll that's normally priced at $10+ for $4. Drinks are happily priced half off. Ok, you sold me Stingray."}
{"text":"I can see why this sushi bar constantly makes the top 3 places to get amazing sushi. They have a great happy hour with options that you can't find anywhere else. The spicy tuna crunch is so good. The drinks/martinis are delicious too. 
I've been there three times and once on a date. All of the sushi was incredible and the filet my boyfriend got was perfectly cooked and melted in your mouth. I always love a server who doesn't make a face at all the questions I ask and each time the ladies were awesome. Perfect for any occasion, happy hour or not, I love this place."}
{"text":"Ok, Stingray has it's high points. It's trendy, hip, and might just explode with young, beautiful people. The atmosphere and decor are nice, but that doesn't completely make up for the fact that the sushi simply falls around the mean. It's average. The menu has a nice selection of rolls and other dishes, and they're good, just not...great. We had a couple different specialty rolls, a tofu dish, soft shell crab, and tempura. Overall it was fresh and well-presented and halfway between actually authentic Japanese and some American Asian fusion food. The bar is crowded if you grab drinks while waiting and the bartenders weren't really fabulous in any way. Same goes for the servers who lack attentiveness and decorum in general. For a place with such a wait, huge crowds, and pretentious hostesses, I'd expect a little more. The curved booths along the sides are nice, though. Oh and, beware, in regards to the well-earned and deserved \"scene\": you might just see/run into every person you want (and don't want) to on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"The rolls were ok.  Nothing to write home about.  Kinda small and over priced.  Service was very slow.  This was a disappointment.  What's even worse is my daughter-in-law paid and I feel she got the short end of the stick."}
{"text":"Another day, another new sushi restaurant.  I was in the neighborhood around here with my co-worker who suggested going to this place.  It was empty when we arrived ~ 2 pm so we had our choice of seats.  I had a good first impression of this place with the cool orange color motif and the clear glass under your feet when you first walk in giving you a view of cute fish swimming underneath.  They started out playing some cool techno music.  After we sat down, we noticed that the table was a bit sticky, which was a turn-off

We started out with the octopus salad which had nice flavor.  It was predominantly acidic with a touch of sweetness and the cucumbers gave it a nice crunch.  The octopus, unfortunately, was a bit too tough for my tastes. 

Next came the sushi rolls.  The morning dew was really good - in general, I am not a huge fan of tempura-infused sushi, but the amount added was relatively subtle and added a nice textural element.  The Hotty Hamachi sashimi was topped with a jalapeno and was fresh and packed a nice punch.  The spicy scallop roll was a little disappointing.  The spiciness of the roll overwhelmed the star of the dish, the scallops, which I was unable to taste in all of the pieces except one.  

We also had the spicy tuna and spicy yellowtail rolls that were tasty as well.  

While our server was extremely attractive, they forgot to give us the ginger and wasabi when our sushi arrived.  She was very friendly, however.

We paid ~$36 per person for the meal and had a good experience here overall."}
{"text":"This place sucks!!!!! We've been here for an hour waiting for sake bomb and then got told that the sake machine doesn't work. And we are forced to drink the beer without sake at all. The food is alright but the whole experience sucks!!! And the wait I said he won't charge us beer, but he did!!!$12 for two beers in happy hour??? I'd rather get a cocktail!!!! And yes, you still need to pay the parking after all!!!! Everything stinks here!!!! It's sooo bad!!!! Don't even want to tip at all!!!! And when you leave the restaurant they didn't even say a \"bye\" the worst experience ever!"}
{"text":"As it turns out, the server should've charged us for a double, but instead charged for rocks - I.E, 'rocks pour' = 'double' in bartending language.  That was not how it was explained to me at our visit...we were told they charge for the rocks.  Puzzled and amused, I had to follow up w/the GM... it just didn't make sense.  LOL.  SO, a double vodka rocks = $17...?"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with my co-workers and was left disappointed, so my review is really 2.5 stars.

When we walked in I was taken aback by the decor, it's really modern and trendy and I was loving the vibe. We sat outside and ordered some rolls and drinks to start. This is where it began to go downhill...

We waited almost 1/2 an hour and a food runner came by and showed us a plate of sushi and asked my group \"is this yous?\" 

I don't know, food runner, is it our'ses?

We had ordered a specialty roll and honestly it had so many ingredients we couldn't tell if it was for us, so it got a little awkward, but then our waitress came by and confirmed. Okay fine no problem. But then!

I was the only one who ordered from the sushi bar for my entree, and my team ordered from the grill, and they got their food first. The waitress explained- \"there's a long wait for the sushi so it'll be a while for your entree.\" It was pretty frustrating that they fired up the other two meals and left me waiting, bad timing of the dinner in my opinion. Also, what does a while mean? (It was about 20 minutes btw).

The saving grace here is that the food was tasty, but it was obvious the restaurant was severely understaffed and not adequately trained for the caliber of dining we were trying to experience."}
{"text":"Food is great, a little too loud for me, gorgeous inside, service is good, price is on the expensive side, but well worth it.... love it will definitely go there again, favorite sushi roll is capo blanco roll!!!!"}
{"text":"Sundays are a great time to head over to Stingray! Half priced appetizers and most of their rolls. Great place to enjoy sushi with friends!"}
{"text":"I was craving sushi and had some time to kill between work and a concert at the performing arts center, so I popped in. Despite it being a Friday evening in Scottsdale, and me being dressed in my nurse scrubs, I didn't feel any snooty vibes, which is what I stereotypically expected. 

The dining room is calming and zen. And like I said, being in scrubs (and alone!), I was treated kindly and seated in the middle of the dining room (after being asked if I wanted to sit at the sushi bar). 

Happy hour is from 3-7pm, with half price cocktail and an assortment of half price apps, sushi etc. I had the seaweed salad (a little vinegar-y for my taste, but a good-sized portion), a \"special roll\" whose name I forgot, it had salmon, tuna, yellowtail and avocado wrapped in cucumber, served with ponzu sauce (only five pieces tho, for $13), a spicy salmon roll (good), and since I was still hungry (nurses don't have time for lunch!), I had two pcs of tuna nigiri and two of tamago, for something sweet. 

I washed it all down with a \"Kiwi Collins\" from the cocktail menu, and it was great. However, when the server came by to ask if I wanted a second one, and I declined, she took my glass away before I noticed!

Overall, a nice, not too pricy ($37 at happy hour) dinner. I wasn't rushed, the food was good. I'd go back."}
{"text":"Some of the best sushi I ever had great music with a DJ and fashionably great atmosphere. Very very fresh sashimi and staff was on top of their service."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite sushi place when I first moved to Phoenix about 5 years ago but I feel as if it has been going downhill ever since. Quality isn't really there anymore and service has always been a little poor. I will say that they have a great deal on happy hour but other than that I would never come here if they weren't on happy hour. There's better places in Phoenix for sushi so this will be a place that I visit pretty rarely from now on."}
{"text":"Lots of bad reviews but I like this place as I frequent it once every couple weeks. I eat sushi out about 3 days a week so I run out of places to go.
 I went last night. They changed their menu! At least the looks of it. Its now plastic-e (just like Scottsdale!) complete with pictures of the drinks!  I am not exactly sure what in the menu has changed...maybe they have Benito boxes now?? The menu reminded me of RA. 
I think their sushi is pretty fresh. I love their spicy stingray roll, but I also LOVE cilantro and could eat a bush of it! ;) Their cucumber salad is also a favorite of mine. 
I do have to say the reason I keep coming back is for the \"juicy gummies\" they give to you with the check! But maybe I should just head to the Japanese market instead......"}
{"text":"I heard some good things about Stingray sushi in Old Town Scottsdale, so we decided to try the one in Chandler.  We should've known by the lack of patrons on a Friday evening that the place would not be good.  We sat at the bar, and even thought the place was 1/4 full, it took a while for the bartender to make our drinks.  We ordered some appetizers, and the food delivered was wrong.  The sushi was okay, but nothing special.  Our biggest gripe was the customer service.  Who gets appetizers wrong??  And why does it take so long to get drinks when the restaurant is less than 1/4 full?  Would not recommend going to his place.  Maybe the Stingray in Old Town is better, but we will not be going back to this one."}
{"text":"I really like Stingray, especially the Spicy Edamame, and the atmosphere. I've never had poor service, in fact it's usually very good. The happy hour menu has good choices, too. One star off for forcing people to use low sodium soy sauce - not cool!"}
{"text":"Oh, Stingray... I have such a love/hate relationship with this place.

I *LOVE* their happy hour: Monday through Friday from 3pm - 7pm. Everything is dirt cheap. You could get a couple rolls and sake bombers and edamame for under $15. I love the decor/style of the place - very LA.NY.SanFran'ish. 

However, what good is a happy hour and restaurant fashion if the sushi is sub-par and the service is slow? This is where they lost me. The waitresses are pleasant, but it takes forever to get your food, check, water, etc.... and the restaurant won't even be slammed with customers. You can get over that, though. What you won't be able to get over is the taste/flavor of the sushi. It arrives extremely fresh, but it tastes like cardboard. I've tried almost all of them and the only one that is worth ordering is the Philly roll - what does that tell you about the place? The miso soup... I LOVE miso soup. I've never had a bad serving of it until I came here, and asked for them to take it back. 

Speaking of miso soup - if you sit by the bar, you'll get a complimentary bowl of it and a plate of edamame. 

So, all in all - going to Stingray definitely depends on your sushi standards. If you don't mind lackluster sushi and love cheap happy hour, go here. If you're a sushi snob (like myself) then spare yourself and go anywhere else."}
{"text":"Went to Stingray Sushi recently for dinner.  I've been here one other time, but I had 18 too many cocktails and couldn't taste the sushi, story of my life.  

However, I was able to taste the sushi last night and was very disappointed.  I know they also own Geisha A Go Go (or Geisha owns them, whatever) and that's one of my fav Scottsdale places, so I had some big hopes for Stingray.  Here is why I gave 2 stars:

1) Choice of rolls and creativity of rolls was subpar.  I had cooler rolls where I lived in Lansing, Michigan...c'mon, this is The Biltmore, gimme something more exciting than the \"Spicy Crab Roll\".
2) Appetizer we had wasn't good.  We ordered the scallop and mushroom (which the waitress said was 'AMAZING, like OMG\") so don't order that.
3) Wine was good...$7-10/glass...bright spot of the night.

Overall - it was just an \"ok\" experience...spent $72 (pre-tip) on 3 rolls, appetizer and 2 glasses of wine.  Not worth it in my opinion, much better sushi places like Blue Wasabi in Phx/Gilbert and even Hana I like better in Central Phoenix."}
{"text":"This is a great fun spot to meet up with some friends!

Right when I walked in I was blown away by the atmosphere here! The lighting, architecture, and theme are awesome!

When you get seated you'll be handed a couple moist towels to wash your hands. I thought this was pretty fancy for a sushi joint. They have a regular menu and a sushi menu.

Staff here are very up beat and casual. The music here seem to be mainstream pop, pretty cool I guess. The area where we got seated was a little to dim in lighting for my taste. Guess I would like to see what I am actually tasting. 

I ordered several things from the sushi menus. Spicy-Tuna Roll, Godzilla Roll, and Philadelphia Roll. All the food was good. Rolls seemed to be cut pretty small though. 

My overall experience here was entertaining and the food was not bad at all. I will more than likely be back here again in the future."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in years but went yesterday for happy hour. Now I know exactly why I haven't been here in so long. The sushi is OK but the service was terrible. We never received our edamame or our soy sauce for the sushi. It also took forever to get change back from our bill. I will never step foot into this place ever again."}
{"text":"What a tasty meal!  I highly recommend the tuna steak with mushroom risotto. I got a cocktail, which I ended up not liking and they took it off my bill no questions asked. My server, Bianca did an excellent job helping me with my entree selection and I felt like I was in good hands.  I will try them out again next time I am in the area."}
{"text":"I had heard all sorts of good things about this place. They were mostly wrong. I would say this place is overrated and overpriced. The $10 crunchy spicy tuna roll came with four - yes 4 pieces and the spider roll was extremely plain. The happy hour is supposedly good, but the normal prices are not worth the fare. Our server probably couldn't get into ASU if she cheated. With the sheer amount of sushi options in the east valley, I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Love this place, 

Atmosphere- My favorite part about it is its never packed so solid that you are struggling to get a table, so I love going here whenever I want something a little more private. Its very open and relaxing, I love sitting outside most of the time cause its much more comfortable and private.

Prices are super reasonable. For being in the Biltmore you always think its going to be super expensive and over the top. But its totally not. Its very comparable to every other sushi joint I been to.

The sushi is always really fresh, never had a bad roll here.

The service is always on point too, a few times I feel like the waitress would take forever to bring a check, but I still give it 5 stars because that's a rare occurrence and I come here too often for that to matter.

Whenever Im thinking sushi I always consider this place as my first option."}
{"text":"I like to go here with friends and sit on the patio when it isn't too hot. Sometimes the traffic on Scottsdale road can be noisy, but it is a great place to people watch.

All of the sushi I have ever tried at Stingray is great. However, my FAVORITE roll is the Las Vegas roll! I have ordered it at other restaurants, but it is never the same as here. This one is the best! I always get the Las Vegas roll when I go here or there would be no reason to go!

I don't like to sit inside because the music is so loud that you can't talk to anyone. Service can be a little slow at times, but they are always friendly. Bathrooms are weird in the respect that you have to close the outer door to the bathroom as well as the door to your stall - if you see it you will understand."}
{"text":"Great place for happy hour ! Super cheap and still tasty ! The spring rolls are really good and our wine was 3 dollars a glass - deal ! My friend and I were very pleased :)"}
{"text":"Very good sushi.  This establishment is trendy inside and is a great place to start an evening out on the town."}
{"text":"Good sashimi a bit high priced how ever all the fish I had was fresh and well served.  I have been three times and each time had a good experience."}
{"text":"Had way to much to fun at Stingray recently and couldn't be happier. The happy hour prices are unbeatable ! A boatload of great Sushi, a couple of beers, a couple of mixed drinks and friendly service all for less than $80.00 before gratuity. Will be back !"}
{"text":"A run of the mill upscale Sushi restaurant. Salmon nigiri had a fishy taste and the rolls even during happy hour were fairly expensive."}
{"text":"This was a spontaneous visit to stingray. First time dining at this location and happy to say it was a memorable one. Angelica was extraordinarily attentive from beginning to end. I happened to visit on an industrial Sunday, half price house maki, appetizers, Latin flare tacos as well as specialty drinks!!(what a deal!) comfortable vibe with other servers approaching table asking how everything was tasting. Will be back soon again for the food and outstanding service!"}
{"text":"Great sushi and excellent service. This is in a mall so it is kid friendly. They have some really good custom rolls. The crispy rice with spicy tuna is a must-try."}
{"text":"I went here for their happy hour - insanely well priced sushi and drinks. Love that they have happy hour EVERY day. I may become a regular here."}
{"text":"I will say the sushi was amazing! It was made perfectly and the presentation was really good. The food came at a reasonable time, but they did forget or miss to put part of our order in. The reason I'm rating them two stars is because the service was awful. We sat by the bar area and the waiter/bartender would barely acknowledge us. I noticed it wasn't just us I saw a table that had to yell out for him a few times (I heard them and I was further away). I couldn't tell if he really couldn't hear that couple or he was ignoring them. Next my girlfriends glass for her sake still had soap from where they attempted to wash the glass. Also, a bug flew into my glass of beer. I wouldn't have had an issue with it, because the restaurant was open to get the fresh air. But since the waiter never tended to us I never got the chance to ask for a new cup. One more thing he did ask me if I wanted a refill on my water I said yes he took my cup and never returned.... Well only to bring my bill, and I did tell the waiter the issues and they did nothing. Not that I expect free stuff, but a nice apology would have been nice. Next time my food will be to go. This was on Sunday night 2/28/16"}
{"text":"the sushi is nothing special and they're VERY proud of it.  that's why i only go here for happy hour.  Saporo bomber and saki for something like $5.  the happy hour menu is enough to set you right, but i come for the drinks and the scenery."}
{"text":"This is my FAVORITE sushi place in town...I LOVE the decore and the food is so so so good.  

I will recommend:  The shrimp Shumai, Scallop Dynamite, Rock Shrimp as food-for Sushi:  It's ALL good.  I believe my favorite though is the Morning Dew (a soy paper one) and the Cabo Blanco.

I really don't feel as though i have anything more to say except GO HERE!

Simple and to the Point.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"You forgot to put in my food order, or you forgot to apologize for the mistake, either way I haven't forgotten to write you a negative review.

If I could give 2.5 stars I would because the person next to me got their sushi on a boat which looked really cool, and deserves .5 stars."}
{"text":"Depending on what you're looking for; if it's food mmm okay it's alright.  Service was not excellent but not bad either.  I think Sting Ray's in general is more for it's atmosphere.  Go for happy hour and drinks, aside from that don't complain.  Sting Ray's in Scottsdale is just a smaller version of the Biltmore one."}
{"text":"We hit Stingray for a sushi lunch during a gorgeous weather streak and obviously weren't alone as the restaurant was practically empty inside with a ten minute wait for a patio table. Being midday, we elected to sit at the bar on the patio that allowed us to enjoy the weather and view the televisions.

Yes, the pricing here is a little on the high side but the sushi (today and on all my visits) is consistently good and the atmosphere is nice. Also -- and I noticed most reviews didn't touch on this -- they have a nice little sake list that is always fun for sampling (we did the pear one today and it was great). It was slow and bartender took care of us but I will say that the service was good and all of the staff was friendly and polite.

Agree with what one reviewer said about the \"trying to be a club\" feel. I have been there in the evening and it is a place to be. Guess there isn't a lot that can be done about that though -- just be aware if you are going for a late Friday dinner or something."}
{"text":"I've got to say, even after all the day drinking we did before stopping it, this place STILL was a disappointment. 

I'll be honest, we only came here because Geisha had an hour and fifteen minute wait. Crazy.

There were four of us. Sitting on the patio. In the dark. Bring a flashlight, seriously it's dark. And something to stabilize the table... they wobble. Good thing there's no cutting involved.

My buddy and I ordered edamame to start, and then  the Crispy Spicy Tuna and the Spicy Shrimp and Scallops. The Scallops is $21!! We were a little hesitant at the price of just one item but to use his words \"Oh man, we're in for a real treat!\".

Out comes the food. The Crispy Spicy Tuna is FOUR pieces. Womp Womp. All it is... is crunch. No real flavor or spiciness. Just super hard and crunchy.

THEN the real joke comes. Our Spicy Shrimp and Scallops is literally ONE overcooked Jumbo Shrimp, TWO smallish scallops and four rice cakes sitting in a bowl of broth. I'll give them this, the broth was delicious. Super spicy and awesome. But the portion size is a joke considering the price. We were laughing hysterically at our gross overstatement of a \"real treat\". 

Oh and the edamame was never brought out. Our server... Jennifer? Jessica? She was sweet and apologized and graciously removed it from the bill. 

The bathrooms are super weird also. The sliding door is like wide open for the restaurant to see in to and I wasn't sure if i was supposed to shut it... strange. Each stall is closed, but you can see the urinals in the men's room as you walk in to the women's. Very awkward and not too clean.

I won't return."}
{"text":"Dined in over Father's Day weekend and loved it! The sashimi plate was so fresh and was one of the best sushi places we have eaten since Hawaii. All the sushi we had has delicious we ordered 8 different kinds. Great service, we had two little ones and the waitresses were great with them, even had them feed the fish! So nice we will be coming back for sure. Left a great impression"}
{"text":"I am giving this restaurant four stars only because we ate the nigiri.   We did not eat any of the rolled sushi since I don't especially care for them, and my friend left it up to me as to what to order.  

We came for dinner.   He wanted the cucumber salad, which he enjoyed but thought the dressing was too \"spicy.\"   He probably meant it was tangy because of the vinegar.   Myself, I thought the dressing was more on the bland side.   Didn't quite have the right combination of ingredients.   I did like the nice touch and addition of the seaweed.  I thought that was tasty, and when I make cucumber salad, I think I shall add it.

We had the salmon roe, yellowtail, salmon, tuna, and one other order that I can't remember.   The fish was perfect as was the salmon roe.

Our server was attentive albeit a bit uninformed.   I had to explain to him that I wasn't saying \"salmon roll\" but \"salmon roe.\"   We had a bit of a dialogue about that.   He asked the sushi chef before finally catching on.

I would go back for the nigiri, that is for sure."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that both my brother and I are in the restaurant business and are VERY understanding.

It took our server about 10 minutes to come greet us.
Then she spilled our drinks over our table. Hey it happens we were very forgiving. And even helped clean up. 

Then she did not know much about any of the food on the menu. And was not helpful with suggestions what so ever. Couldn't even tell me about the wine.

The sushi came out first then my brothers food. I ordered something that she said was ordered often, and when it arrived she said she had no idea that's what it was and took it back. I ended up not eating because I didn't want to get my food by the time my siblings were done.

The worst part was she very obviously didn't care about anything. We went without refills for long periods of time. Didn't ask how the food was or apologized about everything that had happened.

I definitely understand how it is to serve, but this was just unacceptable."}
{"text":"I have a name for post-work happy hour bliss, and it is Stingray Sushi. I can't believe all of the great food they have on special, and until 7:00pm!!!!

I started with a Japanese Tease which, although delicious and refreshing with citrus vodka, green tea and lime juice, paled in comparison to TJ's Tokyo Stock Exchange (fresh basil with ginger vodka and lime juice) which was light and refreshing...could have downed these all night.

We also imbibed on some fantastic food:
-Seaweed Salad which was fresh and tasty
-Calamari with Japanese aioli (I could have downed a large plate of this goodness 
  too)
-Spicy Tuna rolls (on true fried rice...crunchy and delicious
-Dragon rools (eel, crab and avocado)

Top this deliciousness off with octopus nigiri, and las vegas rolls washed down with some $5 sake bombers and you've just had yourself a HELL of a happy hour. I managed to get out while I was still THIS SIDE of a drunken hot mess (which is usually what happens when I have sake bombers)

I'm so glad we decided to come here, it was great food at really exceptional value in a very cool, hip atmosphere. I will be back soon. Happy hour at its unrelenting best!!!!"}
{"text":"overall food and service is decent. However, I wish they overhaul the table or use table cloth, the table surface is so sticky and unpleasant to touch"}
{"text":"Great food and ambience.  This is a great place for girl's luncheon, date night, bday parties and more!  The food is consistent and the service is just right - not annoying but attentive at the right time."}
{"text":"Came here for the first date me and my husband had when we started dating! Food was delicious i had the Shrimp Tempura Roll and my husband had The Philadelphia Roll and we had a great time and enjoyed the place hopefully to be back for a wedding anniversary dinner!"}
{"text":"Just got back from the grand opening.  This place is going to be a hit. It's great to see a sushi place at the Biltmore again since Ayako closed.

They have the same menu as the Scottsdale location.   At the Biltmore there is a great inside/outside bar and a separate dining area in the back.

All the rolls were very good.  Spicy and flavorful.

I usually stick with beer or sake at Japanese restaurants but the Tokyo Wall Street specialty cocktail was great with vodka and ginger."}
{"text":"Met a friend here for happy hour yesterday.  Even though it was 90 degrees outside the patio bar was very comfortable.  Service was great and the happy hour prices are very reasonable.

My favorite sushi was the dragon roll with eel and avocado. The salmon and yellowtail nigiri was very good as well.

When the weather is nice, this is the place to be for happy hour."}
{"text":"After reading all the other yelp reviews I feel almost embarrassed to say that I thought the fish here was extremely fresh and delicious and that I enjoyed all the dishes we ordered. We had the godzilla roll, the \"motorola\" roll, and a cucumber roll. 

The atmosphere was very hip (i.e. fish tank in the floor you can walk on top of) and they had lots of traditional as well as Americanized rolls to choose from. THe only poorly executed part of the night was bringing us cold hand towels instead of freshly heated ones ."}
{"text":"* WOW! How can I possibly be the first one to write a review for the new Stingray Sushi in Scottsdale Quarter? YAY ME. 

Well I was there last Friday for Happy Hour. As always get there early because by the time we left, that place was PACKED! The bar area is nice. Small inside and very nice outside, but alas, until it cools down, inside is the way to go for me. 

Drinks - They have great drink specials on happy hour. Their Geisha A-Go-Go martini is fresh watermelon with grey goose! Double score as that sucker is delicious!! 

Sushi- all their rolls are good. We had every roll on their happy hour menu except the california roll and let's just say the sushi was fresh, and melt in your mouth good. 

I think our entire bill came to maybe $40 which is pretty cheap for the three of us that were there. I will most definitely be back to visit this location, especially since it is right around the corner from my job :)"}
{"text":"If you're a fan of sushi (who isn't) don't even waste your time here; awful!  The calamari was like seasoned tire, and the sushi chef must have practiced his rolling skills at at a sandwich shop because the rolls did not stay together; they were peeling apart.  It's an upscale atmosphere (with rude patrons to match) and downscale food."}
{"text":"Sushi is ok, service was alright.  

The staff at Geisha's a Go Go (which is literally across the street) is MUCH MUCH more friendly."}
{"text":"When I was there, my friends and I actually watched a break up in action.  It was pretty sad.  

Aside from that, it was a great experience.  I love their drink menu.  Lot's of fresh great options.  I had spice tuna rolls, and they were also very yummy.  This is a definite go to place with the ladies for saturday afternoon happy hours!"}
{"text":"The only good thing about this place was the excellent tasting and unique cocktails.  The buck stops there.

I came here last night with a group of ten and although they don't take reservations they ended up reserving a large table for us, which was pretty nice of them.  All the cocktails I tried were unique and tasty but overpriced.  The sushi was really bland and nothing better then RA.  I was hesitant to try the lobster ceviche because of the whopping $21 price tag, but I figured it would be awesome and a generous portion.  When the ceviche arrived it had  three measly lettuce cups and virtually no lobster at all; the few TINY pieces of lobster I did find were tasteless.  I was so disappointed, and actually pretty pissed.  What a scam and ripoff.  I'm not a cheap person but that was just plain robbery.  I didn't even eat a full cup and didn't touch the rest; when the waitress was within earshot I commented how I didn't like the dish, but she never said a word.  I work in the food industry and you should be able to tell when a dish isn't being eaten because the customer doesn't enjoy it.  

Our waitress was pretty attentive and friendly but she wasn't present very often.  The whole \"no split checks\" thing is BS!  It is not hard to split checks and unless they hand write all orders, the P.O.S system is clearly able to do it.  Forcing groups to share one tab isn't convenient for anyone, including the server, and it just pisses people off.  Also the booths are too low for the tables are feel really awkward; good thing we were the first to arrive and got to nab the chairs!  

Total bill was $659.00 for ten people.  This place is not worth that type of money at all.  Such an utter disappointment."}
{"text":"I got a teriyaki bento box to go from here today, and they forgot to include rice. Seriously? They sent the to go order with soy sauce packets, but no rice. It came with soup but they didn't put a spoon in the bag, only chop sticks. I would expect a nice place like this to be a little more attentive, especially since it was after 2pm on a weekday."}
{"text":"Worst experience EVER!!!!! They messed up our order we didn't get food that we ordered. It took the server 40 minutes before we got more water and to even come check on us. And she only came after we went to her manager and let her know of the situations!! Horrible horrible experience at stingray sushi. I won't be coming back and I was a very loyal customer came sometimes 2 or 3 times a week."}
{"text":"Stingray's grand opening was definitely a scene... it was packed but isn't that what grand openings are all about?  That night I sampled a few of their specialty cocktails, and I was not disappointed.  

And when I was planning a girls night out tonight for my mom-in-law and I to go have dinner and see Sex And The City 2, I thought of Stingray... it was perfect.  We sat outside and while the view could've been better (they are doing renovations to the building nextdoor), the table was comfortable and the service was extremely attentive.  

We started out with a seaweed salad and how could we not order drinks before the show?  Joanie had the Geisha A Go Go (watermelon infused vodka cocktail) and I went with a dirty martini... it was perfect!  We shared a few rolls - a futomaki, and eel, and a lollipop roll.  All were delicious.

Stingray in Old Town is my go-to sushi spot, but it's so nice to now have an alternative for nights like tonight on the other side of town.  And a note about the parking - the first two hours are free... just validate your little coin and you'll be all set.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We chose Stingray for dinner the night of my bachelorette party and they delivered!  We had a group of eight girls, and had a really fun time - the food and drinks were awesome as was the service...

We started with some edamame which was devoured quickly... I was given a bachelorette shot and we had a few of the specialty drinks at the table too.  I went with the \"Geisha-a-Go-Go\" (fresh watermelon muddled with Grey Goose vodka) - it was a tad on the too sweet side for me... I tasted the \"Japanese Tease\" (Grey Goose le citron, lime juice, calpico, zen green tea liqueur, finished with a lime twist) and that was for sure the favorite.  The \"Lychee Blonde\" (lychee puree, lychee liqueur, and champagne) was also a hit.

We're having fun with the group and the next thing I know, I'm given a BJ shot from an anonymous guest (or was it from someone in my group?) Either way, I was a good sport... did that shot too!

Seaweed salads, lollipop rolls, hand rolls, hamachi ceviche, etc, etc... came out after that to fill all of our bellies and nourish us (or balance out the alcohol) for the remainder of the evening... It was all great going down - and guess what?  It all stayed down too!  (None of us got sick that night as is usually the case at bachelorette parties).  Good thing, because I am still a huge fan of Stingray and look forward to returning again and again...

Thanks Stingray for being a party of my bachelorette night out - see you again soon!"}
{"text":"My favorite place for sushi in Old Town. The earliest happy hour (3PM) I can think of."}
{"text":"Was in from out of town  and stopped  at the mall. Decided to try this for dinner  since we were there. It was about 5:30pm and we asked for outside seating because the weather was nice.  We were seated immediately by the  bar.  We discovered we were in time for happy hour and proceeded to order off the happy hour menu.  The cucumber sunomono was scrumptious  and I really  enjoyed the crispy spicy tuna roll. We also had three more rolls, all good and the Hamachi kama which my friend loved.  The  server was overwhelmed  (had a sick out and another gone for the holidays ) and our  food  came out sporadically and in no order but  the manager brought it out and very nicely  apologized and offered  to take a couple items off the  bill. They  ended up only charging us about half the price of the meal, which for  sushi made the meal downright cheap. That kind  of thoughtfulness made  the  slow  service a non issue and the manager 's friendly apology went a long way.
Overall very good food,  happy  hour  prices extremely reasonable.  I'll try to come back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Sushi?  In Phoenix?  Even though Arizona is a landlocked state, they can and do ship in some decent fish.  The decor of the place is unique (in the entry of the restaurant has a fish tank in the floor).  Inventive rolls.  Decent sushi.  Patio seating (with requisite misters) which offers a view of cruising on Scottsdale Blvd.

If I'm in Phoenix again with a hankering for sushi, I'll come back.  But I still can't wait to get back to the good stuff, aka SF sushi."}
{"text":"Stingray sushi just moved into the area and being that my family loves sushi, we thought we'd give it a try.  Upon first impressions, the  decor was pleasant, albeit a bit dark. The menu was a bit large for my taste and seemed to be a bit much.However, it is perfect for a group of people that may or may not like sushi. When the food arrived, the presentation was stunning.  I would also like to add that the service was flawless.   

The negative review comes from the flavor and the lack of freshness of the sushi we ordered.  There were four in my group and none of were impressed. There are at least 6 sushi restaurants in that area, so if all of this stands to be true for too many people, it will not last long.  I sincerely hope that this is a one time fluke."}
{"text":"Went to Stingray last night and Have to say Im a fan of both Stingray's (Scottsdale/Biltmore)... However, the New location is great ...chill location, so far not totally packed and always seem to be able to get a spot right away. Great Happy Hour. $5 sushi rolls,apps, and drinks. Can get a ton of food for cheap.

The bad thing was service is still lacking ...coin flip if you get a great server or one you have to wait on them verse them waiting on you...overall experience is good."}
{"text":"Never. Again. *hork* 

I have been to this location a couple of times. My friends LOVE this place, and I really wanted to at least like it. But here I sit typing out my review and fighting the urge to double over the trash can at my desk. I can't remember the last time I felt so sick! 

A few things about last night's dinner stand out...as negative. But I'll start with the positive, which bumped the review up from 1 star to 2. 

POSITIVE: 

Our waitress was very friendly and chipper. 

NEGATIVE: 

But alas, it was not enough. We ordered edamame, 4 rolls and a couple of sake bombers...um...but the \"shot glass\" was too big to fit in the glass...so that no worky. 

The waitress asked if we wanted everything to come at once or if she should bring them out as they were prepared...we chose the latter... 

1) we never got our edamame, 

2) it took 30 minutes before the first roll came out (with no wasabi or ginger??), the next 2 rolls took an additional 30 minutes, and the 4th roll was about 5-10 minutes after that... 

3) the spicy yellowtail (roll #3) had obviously turned, it smelled like bad fish, which I unfortunately didn't realize until it had already made it's way into my mouth...I felt instantly sick and haven't been right since then, which means I didn't even get to enjoy a taste of the 4th roll because I didn't trust it anymore. 

POSITIVE: 

She took the yellowtail off our bill...which seems like it would be a no-brainer, but you never know these days. 

NEGATIVE: 

No apology for serving us bad fish, and no acknowledgment from the mgr on duty, which should be standard operating procedure at a restaurant. 

Also, the acoustics are not conducive to having any sort of conversation. The music was at a decent level, but for some reason, the place is just REALLY loud. 

And finally, and this is just a matter of personal preference, I'm not a fan of the seating arrangement. It's set up in a way so that you are rubbing elbows with other parties and unable to avoid being all up in their kool-aid... 

POSITIVE: 

For the moment, I'm still alive (which feels like a negative right now, but I'm hoping that this current wave of nausea will be the last)."}
{"text":"Stingray is located right across from the Embassy Suites in Biltmore, so we hopped on over for Happy Hour. 

We decided to sit at the end of the bar, near the outside window. The weather was perfect, so the location of our table set the mood for the night. 

We ordered a couple drinks, the Summer Sumo cocktail for me, made with a lemongrass infused vodka. My guy ordered a japanese beer that was very crisp and light. 

With our drinks we ordered the Hamachi Kama dish for $9 and a Spicy Tuna Roll for $3.50. Both were very good. I always try to order Hamachi Shoulder/Cheeks when offered, it's always been great. 

I really enjoyed our little Happy Hour date at Stingray, it's a fun place to start off your night or have dinner."}
{"text":"Best of the best sushi. The yakitori on happy hour is insanely delish and a great price. Sit inside the bar during summer although misters help outside"}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant with my boyfriend on a Sunday afternoon. We had been craving sushi all weekend & this was definitely the place to go! on Sunday's, happy hour runs all day on appetizers, drinks, and specific rolls. However, our bill was still quite pricey for two. I enjoyed my salmon sashimi & vegetable tempura. I would recommend the soft shell crab appetizer! Our service was average. All in all, I would recommend this restaurant for any date night or evening out."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've been to Stingray.  Today I came with my friend who is a vegetarian, which at most restaurants isn't an issue.  We ordered our drinks and then asked the waitress what on the menu was vegetarian.. SHE DIDN'T KNOW.. seriously? Did you just start working here today?  She then went to the kitchen and came back saying the chef said NOTHING on the menu is vegetarian.  I find that completely ridiculous, for any restaurant, let alone a Japanese restaurant in Scottsdale.  It's not like we went to a steakhouse in East Texas.  So we basically cancelled our drink order and left.  Thanks but no thanks."}
{"text":"The happy hour is why I started coming here. Half price sushi and drinks? Great! Well, things have changed. The happy hour prices remain, but the food simply isn't as good as it used to be. I question if new management has taken over or something. I'm concerned about the freshness of the fish, so I have not returned. After eating here I got sick, but can't link it directly to the fish because my husband ate with me didn't get sick. The service is really hit and miss. Our last experience involved a hostess lacking common sense and a waitstaff who didn't seem to know we existed. I'm looking at other places"}
{"text":"Food tasted pretty good, but my boyfriend and I both felt sick to our stomachs afterwards. The service was poor as well. We will not be returning!!"}
{"text":"This rating is for happy hour only (3-7 M-F). Stingray has a good happy hour, featured rolls and drinks are half off. The Las Vegas and Dragon Rolls are tasty, also like the Yellowtail and Spicy Tuna rolls. A small carafe of the house sake is 4.50, Bombers are 5 bucks. Nice patio out by the bar. GF and I ate here Tuesday night, 2 drinks each, 4 rolls and an order of edamae for 37 bucks. Hard to beat that. The regular prices are higher than I would consider reasonable, but happy hour is solid."}
{"text":"When I think of Arizona, Sushi isn't necessarily the first thing that comes to mind. Was given a tip by my dad who had just happened to pass by one evening and suggest to check it out. Upon asking some locals about \"the really good sushi place downtown\" (to which no one knew the name) we were eventually led to Stingray. 

You can tell the place is super hip for Scottsdale, and coming from Chicago I can give a hats off to this place for making me forget I was actually in the middle of a town comprised almost completely of strip malls. Even though it was jam packed, happy to see that the staff went with the flow and left the 'tude at the door. Our server jokingly squeezed her way though the tight tables to take our order (which came out pretty quick!)

Had one of the best cocktails in a while (some sort of Ginger concoction that was fizzy and buzzy, mmmm) Started out with the Calamari....holy heck...best I've ever had and could have sat and ate it for my whole meal. The seasoning wasn't necessarily asian, but you could tell that it hadn't been frozen beforehand. The sushi rolls were all excellent and we ordered way too much that neither my friend nor I could muster the bravery to finish the last one!

Only downside was the place was kind of cramped and a bit loud...but I'm kind of a picky person when it comes to noise and won't come down on them for that."}
{"text":"This is our favorite place for sushi happy hour in old town. Rolls are good and good prices during happy hour."}
{"text":"Came here late night for cocktails and a bite. Loved the dumplings.  Beef skewers were good but kinda marbled. Watermelon flavored martini was bomb but could use a little more alcohol. Overall a great experience!"}
{"text":"I have to say, I have not been impressed with most of the food I have had at the Biltmore Fashion Park and Stingray Sushi did not disappoint.  One of the worst meals and dining experiences I have had, at least in regard to sushi.  Where do I start?  Do I start with the server who helped us at the sushi bar?  She took our drink order but unfortunately it never came so we just had water which in the end was a good thing since the food did not have much flavor.  I did not think it was that tough to serve up a Coke and a beer but it proved to be a request beyond their ability.  From there it went down hill.  My two hand rolls were loosely rolled and almost fell apart as I ate them.  In addition, there was little to no flavor.  Then came the 9-11 roll and that was pretty good, though for the money it was not a lot of food.  Next my Chilean Sea Bass came and it was definitely overcooked.  I could have sent it back but at this point I just wanted to get the meal over with and leave.  What followed was the clincher that sealed the deal and allowed me to call this the absolute worst sushi I have ever had.  The last roll I had was the spider roll.  Anyone who has had a spider roll knows that it is made with soft shell crab.  Well my spider roll had plenty of shell but it certainly lacked the crab.  I have had lots of soft shell crab made many ways and hands down this was the worst.  I could never recommend Stingray Sushi at the Biltmore to anyone unless you have no clue what sushi should be.  Eat at your own peril.  If you want better sushi than what is served at Stingray, just go to your local market.  Yes, the sushi is that bad there."}
{"text":"I get from prior reviewers that the Happy Hour specials are what the 4th star, essentially, is for - otherwise it'd be a solid 3. 

I basically agree but ... I'm a sushi [ngiri] fan, and I find those prices to be very reasonable and the quality to be good. On the other hand, I've had much better salmon skin hand rolls in over half the sushi bars around the country I've ordered them -- I won't try them again here - they weren't crisped well enough for me and didn't have that lovely dressing so many good bars include inside. 

I'm very happy with the dragon roll, shrimp tempura roll and spicy tuna roll - but only at the happy hour price. I wouldn't be caught dead paying suggested retail for them. 

I quite liked the unfiltered sake. 

The decor was interesting. I loved entering by walking on a fish pond! Service was prompt, knowledgeable and friendly."}
{"text":"So I went to Stingray for a quick lunch the other day while my son was in play practice.  I walked in, the place was not crowded.  I got seated and the waitress gave me the menu.  
Looking through the menu, I ordered their sushi lunch which on the menu read- 3 pieces each of tuna, salmon, yellowtail, 8 pieces of California roll, 4 pieces of sushi, rice, soup, and salad for $14.  Since I was hungry, that was what I ordered.
The food came in a bento box- there was the 3 pieces each of tuna, salmon, yellowtail, rice and salad and I had gotten the soup beforehand.  Okay, I figured I was getting the rest of the order on the waitress's next round.
My 4 pieces of sushi and 8 pieces of Californai roll never came.  When I asked the waitress about them, she came back with 4 pieces of California roll and told me that I was not getting the rest of my order because they made a mistake in printing out their \"new\" menu, in a rush for their new Biltmore location.  And she said it in not a very nice way as in \"well, wouldn't that be a great deal to get all that food for $14!\"
I did not make a fuss as I was full with what was brought to me . . . when I went to pay my check, they billed me for $15 instead of $14.  When I started to get annoyed, they took a whopping $1 off my check.  Really?  One dollar?  I got half of the food that I ordered!
Needless to say, I am not impressed with a place that does not honor what is PRINTED clearly in their menu- if it was a mistake, as a business owner, they should have honored the order and pulled the menu from being used.  
Stingray is a cool place to go have sushi but because of their business practice of not treating their customers right, I will not likely be going back there again."}
{"text":"I must admit I love the decor of the Stingrays.  Both at the Biltmore and at the Scottsdale Quarter location.
While the one at the Biltmore was a bit too modern to be a comfortable place to dine for me, the one at Scottsdale Quarter has the right mix of modern and comfort and I really enjoyed dining there for lunch today.
Plus, I was there at 11am when they first opened and when I told the waitress I had 30mins to eat for lunch, they got me in and out within that time and the food was good.
But again, the waitress did not know her menu and did not bring me everything that was included with my lunch order.
Thumbs down and unfortunate for a place with such beautiful decor and quality of food."}
{"text":"I'll preface this by saying that coming from Seattle where we are spoiled with great sushi, this may not be a fair review. 
Although a friend from LA did agree--  their sushi was just okay and was overpriced, especially for lunch. I also thought the menu was overwhelming and a bit of a pain in the ass.

The fish tank floor is a nice touch and the service wasn't horrible, but we had to ask for things multiple times and it seemed like servers were stumbling over each other. 

I'd go back, if I were at the Scottsdale Mall area and craving sushi. Though I admit I'd have to flip a coin to decide which mediocre sushi restaurant (RA or Stingray) was more deserving of my patronage."}
{"text":"Not only did services and the quality of fish go down but they raised their prices up."}
{"text":"Terrible service for large groups.  A reservation was set up for a large group of about 10 people.  The table was reserved and set aside ok.  The staff appeared helpful, courteous and friendly.  The atomospher was cosmopolitan and very urban.  I ordered the Chilean Sea bass as I am not a sushi person.  My cocktail was wonderful and refreshing.  Once we were finished, the nightmare began.  Our waitress put all of our orders on the same ticket, so she could get the large group standard 18%  gratuity.  The orders were all together so my boyfriend and I had to find what we had, total it and calculate gratuity tax, etc.  We had to do this for each person/couple in our group.  It took over an hour to do so.  Then the expected confrontation began.  The waitress, stated that we were short $55.  This is after number of people paid much more than what they owed.  Because of the all the people it also took some time to run cards.  We were told that this is how they do this, but for large groups its a nightmare and always sets up ugly situations.  If they had seperated our orders, It would have meant a little more work for the waitress up front, but no terrible experience at the end.  Our entire group stated that they never wanted to come here again.  Large groups beware!"}
{"text":"The bartender was friendly, but the sushi was bad.  The rice was so sticky it was mushy, kinda like paste. And the Godzilla roll had something non edible in it, with a hit of cleaning product to taste.  Needless to say, but we won't go back."}
{"text":"We Were on our way to seasons 52 (which is amazing btw), and decided to try stingray sushi instead. Big mistake. Waited for ten minutes after being seated with no greeting. Folks came to sit behind us and they were greeted almost immediately. Needless to say we decided to just leave and head back to seasons. The hostess blamed it on the waitress being new. I asked to speak to manager but he was busy and we didn't want to wait. Sad and pathetic first experience at this place for customer service. Not sure I'll be back to actually taste their food. Good luck stingray and hope you enjoy bad reviews from people who eat out a lot. (update- manager called me and apologized so i increase to 2 stars)"}
{"text":"Apparently I have to add lots of words in order for this to be considered a real review, but I want people to see right away that Stingray Sushi has closed! There's a sign on the door that clearly states that employees can pick up checks and tips at another location but if you'll see my photograph you'll see that the restaurant is no longer open. That's a real shame, because we used to love to come here and it's really too bad that they've gone out of business."}
{"text":"when august worked here as the sushi chef we came here 3 times a week 
when he left we stopped 
i went back 2 weeks ago still good staff but the quality in the sushi had gone down 
he really put love into his profession 
i will return tho

the beer could be colder
just saying..."}
{"text":"Happy hour rating and update: Went back for HH on a Friday, much more their wheelhouse. Cool casual vibe with DJ, fast service, and good variety of Maki/app specials. Specialty drinks were undrinkable in our opinion (Tokyo Mule and Tokyo Stock Exchange), had to order Sake & a non happy-hour martini to get the taste out, but still got charged for all. Food was surprisingly good, faves were spicy tuna roll and spicy scallop roll."}
{"text":"\"Meh\" is the perfect word for Stingray.  

Always good quality sushi, but every time I go I can't help to think that I over payed.  The restaurant itself is beautiful and service is decent.  I guess I need to stick to only going during Happy Hour so that I can up my rating."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch and its a cool place, totally like the decor. The service was good. My girlfriend got the lunch special with salad, soup, rice, and chicken. She loved it, I tried the chicken thought it was plain with no seasoning but cooked perfect and was moist and crunchy. I had them make me a sushi roll. It was very good but I thought it was small in size. If it was bigger I would have given 4 stars. The roll I had them make was shrimp tempura, cream cheese, jalapeno, topped with yellow tail. Overall I do like this place, sushi wise I have had better but I did like it. I will be back, glad to have a sushi place in this area!"}
{"text":"I just read the other posts am I am wondering, is this the same place I had lunch in yesterday? The restaurant I ate in sent out cold tempura once then warm with a too thick coating the second time. They sent out sushi with no wasabi and a soy sauce bottle with no soy sauce. I was greeted with a washed out hello, then informed 'we are severely short staffed today'!  Zero confidence from a server that knew she could never meet the needs of her guests.  Why seat people when you know you are short staffed? It was a little like torture. The manager picked up the check which I don't like. I prefer to pay and have a good meal. It will be hard to return knowing that these small problems may not be fixed without strong management , proper staffing and good cooks."}
{"text":"It's not Hana Sushi in Phoenix, which I prefer.
My wife and I sat at the bar and ate a bunch of fish and went home happy though.
So the food was good.
But the whole scene--the vibe--the people who rock into this joint with their bedazzled jeans and their foreign SUVs.
I don't know. Not fun to be around."}
{"text":"The extra star was for atmosphere. Food caused stomach ache and unpleasant feelings. Mochi reminds me of trader joes brand. Enjoyable time with friends until the started to close down and almost locked us on the patio."}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of sushi bars and nothing specifically stands out in a good/bad way.  
The fish seemed fresh and their happy hour is good.  I would go again but I wouldn't call it my favorite place."}
{"text":"The only reason that I am giving this 3 stars, is because although the sushi was just good, I don't think it was anything special, and it's kind of expensive!  It was definitely good, but I've eaten at places that were better and less expensive.  My husband did order some noodle dish and said it was the best he ever had.  Our server was very nice and attentive though!  Would I ever come back here?  Probably not...again, it's just nothing special!"}
{"text":"We have had food delivered from here a number of times through a currier service and it's normally pretty good.  I was frankly disappointed as I was expecting better.  The shrimp tempura roll was just off.  Likewise with the seaweed salad that was fishy...I would have sent both back but our server was nowhere to be found.  We were provided two 22 oz beers with no glasses.  We were provided no setups...no plates, soy sauce dishes etc.   our sushi was served and had to sit there for 5 minutes before a busser finally brought us utensils.  The soy sauce was also off...probably just not being stored properly.  Overall I was just hoping for better.  Yakitori was excellent and well priced but not enough to save the overall bad experience."}
{"text":"Stingray is everything that is wrong with sushi in America. This place is just for young, dumb pretty things, and the douchebags that hunt them, to go for a quick bite before hitting 7 different clubs. It is a bastardization and dumbing down of the sushi experience that leaves 1000s of people walking away saying: \"Yeah, I've had sushi. Sake bombers. Raw fish, big deal. It's fun.\"

Sushi isn't raw fish, it's a vinegared rice prepared in a specific manner to achieve perfect texture and flavor. That rice is then accompanied by various toppings, often raw fish. But you could eat an entire meal of real sushi and never touch raw fish. 

Both times that I've fucked up and gone here, the sushi rice has been pathetic. Once so undercooked it was cracking in my teeth. The next, so mushy and over-sweetened it tasted like dessert.

Once, sat at the bar to try to get a little interaction with a \"chef\". I ask him what sashimi he recommends. His answer: \"it all comes in fresh daily.... whatever.\" WRONG ANSWER, tall white doofus \"chef\"!

SR gets an extra star for being semi-cool looking for a rock n' roll sushi bar, and appearing to be clean, in the front anyway. And if you order the right stuff, it gives you something colorful to throw up later in the bathroom at Myst.

If you want real sushi: Hiro in Scottsdale, Shiro in PV, + multiple other venues, some I've yet to try but are getting good reports. Hell, even in a setting like the Metreon in SF, Sanraku is good Japanese. There seems to be a boom again, thankfully. But Ayako at the Biltmore will be missed for a very long time.

(I could copy/paste this same review for Zen32 and RA. Why retype almost exactly the same complaint?)"}
{"text":"I love this place!! Really good sushi. Great drinks. Awesome happy hour deals! Every Sunday is happy hour all day! Half off some of their rolls and appetizers. Great deals and every time that I've come here service has been good too! If you're looking for good quality sushi at a decent price I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Why only 3 stars? Other than the fact that I was there to meet someone off one of the internet dating websites for the first time (nothing to brag or write about here), I had no complaints about Singray. After our very brief \"meeting\" (the turkey had to leave after 20 minutes to go to dinner- probably another date), I ordered an edamame and Las Vegas roll. The roll was okay (I've had better). It was happy hour so the edamame was $2 roll $6. Not bad. I've tipped this place as \"a good place to meet a blind date\" if you can find a seat in the crowd."}
{"text":"I stopped in here with the owner's girlfriend after she cut my hair. She kindly treated me to anything I wanted to eat and drink. wooo hoo! I ordered a Grey Goose and cranberry and a Las Vegas roll (my all time favorite sushi- even if it is fried). Both were delicious. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"We decided to dine here on default. We wanted to try the original chopshop, but it was busy on a late Sunday afternoon.  I mean, the line was insane and I am not a patient person so we decided to go to the not-so busy Stingray.  Now, let me just tell you that I am very picky when it comes to sushi and any types of \"asian\" food since, well, i'm asian myself.  

I decided to get the teriyaki beef bento box with tempura vegetables. I asked for the teriyaki to be put on the side and so without the teriyaki sauce, the beef itself was tough and bland.  But of course, if you drenched your beef and vegetables with the sauce, it would be amazing, right?

The salad and cucumber salad was pretty good, but again, it was drenched with different sauces so of course, it wasn't bad.  On to the tempura vegetables - it was good.  I like the batter that they use, but the tempura was not even warm.  What the?  It seemed like it was sitting in the kitchen for quite some time.  

Our waitress was sweet, but I think that she should've been more attentive considering the fact that there was 2-4 customers in the restaurant other than our group.  We were waiting for quite some time to order, get our food, and get our bill.  I just didn't understand why the slow service with a few customers.

The bill came and it averaged about $15/person.  Honestly, I would've been happier eating at Panda for $7/person."}
{"text":"I'm always a Malibu girl, but tease me with an Asian Blonde and I'm in!  Unfortunately, it wasn't that great, just a tease... Of course I didn't realize they had Zipang sparkling sake so that ended up being my drink of choice here and a win :)

The bar was packed so we opted for table service. Our server was spot on with her recommends: Hamachi Ceviche was fresh and light and the Cabo Blanco Roll was so good I ordered it twice. Lava Roll was good, my friend erupted with praise for it. Also tried Yellowtail and Salmon Nigri and the NY Strip Tataki. Ended with the Tempura Ice Cream (not a fan).

Our bill was pricey but the service was great considering it was packed. Never had an empty glass or plate waiting to be picked up. 

P.S. I dig the staff's colored Converse. Adds to the hipster feel they've created."}
{"text":"So very disappointing!  From the Edamame to the Spicy Tuna Roll! We went for Happy Hour and ordered 5 different orders of sushi, edamame, gyoza, calamari tempura & seaweed salad, every single item tasted the same with the exception of the seaweek salad, that was so overpowering with dressing that it was inedible. Can you believe no pomegrante martini? Seriously? Place was empty which should have told us something. Couldn't find the entrance, front door blends right into the building, seriously! Had to cut through an opening in the gate to try and get into the restaurant, which was pretty much what was happening with everyone else that tried to get in...Just ridiculous.  Bye bye Stingray, will be heading back across the street to Ra where sushi is superb!"}
{"text":"We went there when we were on vacation. We were horrified that Stingray would have the audacity to charge $16+ for a grilled salmon entree in which the fish sat atop of a bed of rehydrated mashed potato flakes. For that high a price, they should serve real, fresh potatoes. That's just about the easiest thing in the world to make?! The fish was also dyed to be a brighter red and cooked to practically saw dust. I'm also pretty convinced the rest of their food which we tried (meh) was full of MSG and/or prepackaged. The ambiance was pleasant, although the overly-trendy music was much too loud and the multiple TV screens were annoying in an otherwise upscale environment. If we wanted to be distracted by sports while we ate, we'd go to Hooters. Way over priced for the sub-par food they serve. The waitress was pleasant and prompt though, and their house-brewed iced tea was refreshing."}
{"text":"Just walked out of this place after being seated and ignored for 15 minutes in a mostly empty restaurant.  3 servers walked past us and even after alerting the empty headed hostess of our plight another 5 minutes passed.  We gave up and have forever given up on this place.  Can't wait for Sushi Brokers to open their new location.  At least the service is
always good there.  Done with Stingray!"}
{"text":"Not bad but definitely not great for the price and wait. The waitresses are nice but very inattentive. The dragon roll at happy hour had burnt eel and the sea bass took over 25 minutes to come out. Not worth my time nor my money."}
{"text":"Well hot dog..we missed happy hour! But i heard it was awesome!!

Came here for dinner with my work folks, but I was the only one who ordered sushi!

We had gyoza and spring rolls for the table and I ordered:

1. Spicy Tuna Roll - Not bad, the spicy tuna roll is like a benchmark for me. The sushi rice was a pretty good texture, but the spicy tuna was not very spicy.

2. Blanco Cabo (or something like that..) - This was a fancy roll. The fish was cut too small and rubbery..It was decent enough to make it through half the roll, but I just wasn't feeling it.

3. Sake Nigiri - Not too bad on the Sake Nigiri...they didn't skimp too much on the fish..and tasted pretty fresh. 

There is something to be said about sushi restaurants that have more drinks on their menu than food... -____-;;"}
{"text":"Hands down our fav happy hour place!!
$5 sake bombers, $3-5 great sushi selection - what's not to love about it?
If you sit at the sushi bar you get miso soup and edamame complimentary.

Try the DRAGON roll!"}
{"text":"Hands down our fav happy hour place!!
$5 sake bombers, $3-5 great sushi selection - what's not to love about it?

My husband and I go there a couple times a month and the only thing that sucks about this location - we never ever get the same server - seems like the staff turnout there is crazy. Different girls every time. It's not really what we want from our fav neighborhood spot. 
Anyways, the food is really-really good. Try the DRAGON roll!"}
{"text":"Ok......now this has been the best sushi spot so far since I've moved here!! The setup inside is good for a late night hang out in the bar section and the dinning area is open inside and outside. The sushi bar is decent as well. The service is solid. The hostesses at the front are really polite and accommodating. On Friday and Saturday nights it can get a little busy but the wait has never been to long. I've never waited for more than 20mins. 
The menu is pretty robust. They have a large selection of rolls and seafood dishes that are amazing.... I recommend the shrimp & scallop entree. You won't regret it. I have tried many rolls and non have ever been a disappointment. 
All in all I would have to say that this is the best sushi in town. If anyone can top this spot please let me know!! GO SUSHI!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great place for Sushi!!! Everything was very fresh. Love the atmosphere and front door!! Took me a minute to find it and figure it out! Total Duh moment! LOL .. I love Scottsdale Quarter to begin with but this just puts the icing on the cake for me. Nothing like a great sushi lunch after shopping with the girls!"}
{"text":"I'll most likely be the only 1 star review on here but I don't care.  This place looks pretty on the outside, but don't be fooled by the glitz and glam of this Biltmore Sushi place...  

Let me first start with my experience last night... I wasn't terribly hungry but I thought I would meet up with some friends and I just ordered a simple Philly Roll.  I'm not a big fan of smoked salmon (which comes standard in that roll) so I ask if I could have fresh salmon instead.  Placed my order and the server comes back out and lets me know that there would be a $3 up-charge for fresh salmon.  No thank you, please cancel my order.  1 minute later the food runner comes out and says, \"Here's your roll with fresh salmon\" and I told her that I cancelled this order because of the up-charge, which she responds back by saying they will send it back.  Send it back, you mean throw it away?  Really?  You're really not going to give it to me now, you're going to send it back?  So the food runner responds that she will ask her manager for permission...Needless to say I recovered the roll at regular price, but I couldn't believe there would be $3 up-charge for fresh salmon!  Holy crap, way to over charge for the most simple roll. 

Second...Don't go in for lunch...this place has so many flies that you are constantly battling swatting flies away while trying to enjoy your overpriced-mediocre sushi roll.  Hopefully with the weather getting cooler the problem has become better BUT never-the-less I just thought you should know....

From the outside this place looks awesome-on the inside its modern decor will catch your attention-the sushi is not great but its ok-your bill, overcharged"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a classic, no frills, sushi bar experience, this is the place for you.  Sit at the sushi bar and chum it up with your chef.  Great food, great prices!  If Kyoto is closed, go here!  It's just a couple blocks south!  You won't regret it.  Don't let the negative reviews fool you... Some people go to a restaurant to be seen socially.  Some want to eat good food! If you are the former, go to roka akor.  If you're the latter, give stingray sushi a go!"}
{"text":"Food was good, drinks were good, service was ok, not great.
Took them a long time figure out we were there and to serve us.
Once they took our order things started going better."}
{"text":"Met a friend for happy hour last night at Stingray Sushi Biltmore...we had a nice night! The place was busy for happy hour so we sat at the bar outside under the misters. The bartenders (3) were very attentive. Our food (3 rolls) was good but I wish they were able to do brown rice (oh well - still good though). Pricing on HH was pretty inexpensive too. - I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Stingray has some of the most creative sushi I have had here in the Valley. I went to this location on Friday during happy hour. It was PACKED in the bar area, and there was really no where to stand. We got drinks at the bar, but because it was so packed, a patron of the bar spilled one of our drinks all over herself, while she was trying to hand it to me. I felt awful! We found a stand around table. Once we got to the table, our experience improved. Our waitress, I think her name was Kelly, was knowledgeable and friendly. The service was outstanding, even though it was super busy. We paid $100 for 8 saki bombers and 9 rolls! Amazing food and service!!"}
{"text":"I'm not a giant fan of Stingray. I like the setup and the location and the food even, but all in all it doesn't stack up too well against its competitors.  

First off, the last time I went there I had to sit outside to carry on a conversation, and even out there it was a struggle because the music was still too loud. We ordered a few of the standard fare rolls and tried some of the specialty rolls, which were good but not outstanding.

I'm not a huge fan of Ra but I admit that I really like the food there. Stingray mixes the snobbery of Ra with food that just isn't quite as good. 

I will say, though, they have a pretty mean happy hour and provide a good setting to go sake bombing on a budget. Just take it easy, the cheap sake will hurt in the morning."}
{"text":"The food quality here is not as same as the interior design. The Japanese food isn't authentic nor as normal standard as the price should match. Overpriced and doesn't worth to try if you are a true Japanese food lover."}
{"text":"I've had mixed experiences dining at Stingray; both times were during happy hour.  I called to make a reservation but they do not allow them for parties under 6 people, so we took our chances.  

Stingray's happy hour menu is smaller than most but there are great deals on entrees and classic rolls like spicy tuna, the Vegas roll, dragon roll, shrimp tempura roll, and the crispy spicy tuna (my favorite--it's not so much a roll but it's delicious:  panko-crusted rice topped with tuna and a jalepeno slice).  The happy hour menu also has good drink specials:  $1 sake, half price sake carafes and specialty drinks, and $4 wine.  Decent sushi at great prices.  

I haven't tried their specialty rolls but they appear to be standard $12-$16 creations.  It was an impersonal dining experience and the servers seemed distracted.  Also, a table for two is VERY narrow and small; there is only room under one's chair to put a purse or umbrella.  

All in all, it's decent sushi at reasonable prices (at least during happy hour)."}
{"text":"Stingray used to be my favorite place to go for sushi but after numerous poor experiences during the past year or so, I don't intend to go back, at least to this location.  It is difficult to believe that the restaurant is owned by the same people that own Geisha.  The sushi at Geisha is equally as good, but the service is much much better.  At Geisha they are super friendly and welcoming, and check on you to make sure you don't need anything, and like the food.  At Stingray they are rude,  very unwelcoming, and not helpful at all.  I personally don't enjoy going to eat where the waitresses are completely bitchy, which has frequently been the case at Stingray.  There is no excuse for this. Cute atmosphere and good sushi do not make up for the mistreatment of their patrons.  I was very loyal to Stingray for years, always recommending it to others, but everyone I've taken there lately has had negative experiences with the service from rude waitresses to empty glasses to messing up the orders.  If you want good sushi just go to Geisha which is across the street from Stingray.  It is open til midnight just like Stingray and the staff has been properly trained there, a very nice touch:)"}
{"text":"While the giant fish tank in the middle of the bar might blow you away, the sushi will NOT. 

The HH menu is pretty limited compared to other places I've been. There is a bigger selection of drinks than their is food. There isn't even any veggie rolls on the HH menu! 

I decided to try the Kimodo Dragon Cocktail. It was Bacardi Dragon Berry, muddled with strawberries grapes and basil, sounds good No? 
NO is right, it was sickening sweet with artificial strawberry flavor( think Strawberry Lip-smacker) and NO and I mean NO hint of the Basil whatsoever. 

Our waiter was a total Tool. He didn't bring us any water, He didn't bring us any Wasabi or Ginger, We had to flag him down for all of these things. 
He Never even asked us how we were doing. 

The Sushi was Cheap, price and quality. The rolls were loose and fell apart as soon as you picked them up. I mean it wasn't the worst sushi I've ever had but it was very generic and underwhelming.

One of the rolls we ordered that was not on the HH menu was the Stingray roll, it was spicy crab with cucumber topped with cilantro and jalapeno and some sauce on the side. 
We were expecting something spicy. It was NOT. The sweet and sour sauce on the side did not help things, what was supposed to be cilantro and jalapeno looked and tasted like nothing more than chopped parsley and the \"Crab\" was actually \"Krab\" and they had the nerve to charge $11 for this. FAIL!"}
{"text":"I love the modern yet cultural Decor of the restaurant. I ordered to hand roll California style as well as a miso soup and my father ordered the beef teriyaki lunch special. Their menu as well as their Sushi special menu has a great variety of options. The food was fantastic. The music is a little loud making it hard to have conversation but other than that I give this an A plus."}
{"text":"so after getting a facebook notice from cenpho about stingray opening up last night, i couldn't pass up the opportunity to check out a new local sushi spot and sample what they have to offer. the promotion was a $10 donation to a charity and in return you get to sample their sushi and their drinks.

my girl and i get there at 8, an hour after the gala started, and the place is packed. it's quite big inside, with the restaurant being divided half into a bar/lounge and half into a sit down restaurant. the bright obnoxious orange paint on the walls kind of threw me off but the rest of the restaurant was pretty sleek. they had a huge fish tank in the bar area....with NO FISH in it..ummm..it's your grand opening...are the fish swimming their way here? the bathroom, while trying to be cool and urban in concept, failed miserably with a sink that splashed water all over the floor just begging for someone to slip, fall and sue the company.

onto the food, and the drinks. while i was told my $10 donation would provide me with samplings of sushi, the only sample i  got was 1 piece of a roll that a waitress brought out. after that 1 waitress with sushi, the food magically disappeared. the roll itself was decent, i don't remember what it was, but it had a delicious sauce on top and a piece of halibut. the rice on the sushi was not as sticky as i prefer, it almost crumbled in my mouth. there were plenty of drinks samplings going around though, as if liquoring me up would make me forget that you're not passing out any food. we got a complimentary specialty cocktail, i went for the raspberry rose drink since they ran out of their kiwi drink and my lady went with the dragonfruit drink. i liked the raspberry one better, although they were both a little too on the sweet side for my taste. good news though, they carry newcastle.

bottom line - on your opening night, be prepared. seriously you guys. you promised me sushi and samplings of appetizers and you didn't deliver. after this debacle, chances are i won't even come back. there are a handful of other sushi places that managed to impress me way more than you did stingray. lame."}
{"text":"This place is my go-to happy hour as tacos become $2 each, appetizers and drinks are half off, and maki rolls are half off too. I rated this place a 3 instead of a 4 because I would probably not done here without the happy hour deals. It is a bit pricey without the deals and the best food are the small dishes and appetizers which are fun to eat.

I've had 2 cocktails so far, the lychee margarita and the geisha a go go. I really liked the geisha cocktail since it is not too alcoholic but was very refreshing due to the watermelon juice. Their mandarin iced tea is great too.

As for food, I would say stick to the happy hour deals. I normally get the ahi tuna tacos as well as the rock shrimp tacos. You can ask them to substitute the tortilla for a lettuce wrap if you are feeling healthy! The skewers are generally a bit dry but they are decent if you just want a chunk of meat to refuel on. The takoyaki is great but is over sauced, so I would ask for the sauce on the side. As for the maki rolls, the quality is average but it is slightly better than buffet-quality sushi. I would go for the classic rolls of you are craving sushi as they end up being around $2-3 per roll which is actually a great deal for fresh rolled sushi.

I have tried their Nagasaki seafood udon and it was quite good. It's not authentic but it does taste pretty good - they include a plethora of seafood variety from crab to scallops to mussels. However it is not an appetizer so it is indeed pricey for a bowl of udon.

Overall this place is a great place to munch on small dishes and to drink with them whenever you find yourself having a late lunch."}
{"text":"Excellent service, but the bartender didn't know what infusion meant on the HH vodka prices. :/"}
{"text":"Seriously, what happened to this place?!? I'm shocked that they can survive at the Biltmore with their poor food and service! I've been here several times and it's always been decent and a cool place. It had been several months since I had been here and decided to stop by the other day. The sushi was not fresh and the portions were so small. There was barely any fish in the rolls. I ordered a sashimi portion of uni and it wasn't even enough for a sushi portion and it was $18.50! I told the server and she just said \"sorry, I'll be sure to let the manager know your concern, but there's nothing we can do about it\". Really?!? I very rarely give negative reviews, but this place needs to step it up several notches to even compete with the wonderful sushi places in the valley to choose from. Try Hana Japanese Eatery, Hiro, Akaihana....they are consistently great and have kept a great reputation. I see from the reviews that Stingray has left many customers very unhapy. Hopefully they read their customers feedback and make some major changes!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Stingray Sushi for dinner 3 nights in a row while visiting Scottsdale. Delicious sushi, nice ambiance, good service. There's a full bar with music, but if you're sitting in the next room at the sushi bar it's not noisy at all. There was an interesting looking sushi club across the street, but we were looking for something a little more low key. The price was perfect, since they have some sushi entrees at half price during happy hour. We would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I went here a few years ago with a group of friends.  It was a fun experience to sit outside and be served suhi and rose petal mohitos. 

The service was exceptional and the food was great.  I learned that I definitely don't like sea urchin.  YUCK!!!!  

I definitely would like to return and have some more sushi!"}
{"text":"Coming to a restaurant located in the Scottsdale quarter, is surprisingly off for the night. Although the atmosphere is relaxing and entertaining, the service was not up to my expectations. The server lacked knowledge of the menu, we asked multiple times for water refills, which knowing Arizonans is a must. The only positive critique I can say is that the food and drinks are delicious. If the staff would be willing to invest a little time getting familiar with their menu, and being more attentive with service, I would gladly recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"i knew i shouldn't have gotten sushi in the dessert. how fresh could the fish possibly be? good news, i didn't get sick. bad news...fake crab. boooooooo! i must be spoiled being from the bay area. 

anyway, the atmosphere is pretentious. the music is annoying like a club. the menu had the roll names but no descriptions. the service was wack. the food was just okay. i wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"Sorry to be Debbie downer... but this place closed:-(. I was so pumped for sushi and to our dismay we found a note on the door stating Stingray was closed for business. Sad for employees to have found out that way."}
{"text":"Scottsdale, AZ-This place was good the crispy rice with spicy tuna and shrimp dumplings were a great appetizer. We got two rounds of these for four people. Then split the fire dragon and Godzilla roll. The Godzilla roll was massive and hard to eat. We also ordered California roll and a spicy tuna roll which were both good. Overall, a good experience."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, mediocre food, and terrible service. Teriyaki chicken took an hour while the rest of the food came out on time. One person in our party does not eat fish and sadly was not even able to eat dinner. Management gave us 1 beer for the trouble....they could have done more. The quality of the sushi is not great and over priced. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"I went here on Valentine's day with my boyfriend. The appearance of the restaurant is nice on the outside and inside. 

It took quite some time for our order to be taken. We had water while we were waiting, but it took around 40 minutes to finally get our food. 

We had 7 different types of sushi, and the only one that really stuck out to me was the \"cabo blanco roll\" which was delicious. All of the other sushi were okay and reasonably priced since Sunday is happy hour. 

Not the best sushi place I've been to, but I'd come back."}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend to celebrate his birthday. The restaurant decor is awesome! The door is cool, the chandelier is cool, the and the inside seating looks very modern. We chose to sit outside because we can't enjoy this nice beautiful weather much longer. Loved our spot, perfect for a date. 

We made it just before happy hour ended, and ordered a spice yellowtail roll and gyoza. They came one at a time, which gave us time to enjoy each plate. We then ordered a small sushi boat! We never had sushi on a boat and was super excited to try it on his special day. It came along with miso, which was good too! 

Everything was good until we got our 'sushi boat'. It wasn't a boat!!!!!!! It was just sushi on a long plate.. We asked the girl that brought us the 'sushi boat' why it's not on a boat.. And she just said ha and continued to try and explain to us what fish was what. (she didn't know her fishes, and even asked us if it's salmon) well anyways, we were very very frustrated and disappointed. Our waitress came along and we asked her about the boat. She then explains that apparently the sushi boats broke often so they got rid of it. 

Advice to Stingray management : change the name on the menu from sushi boat to sushi plate, or bring those sushi boats back!!! 

But we decided to brush it off since it's his birthday, and we will not let anything ruin the night. Our waitress was super nice, and when I told her it was his birthday, she gave him a slice of cheesecake. 

Oh btw, the sushi was really good! Would of been better on a boat. 

Our check came and it came along with two pineapple gummy candies!! Yes, loved it. 

This is a great restaurant for a date night, and would totally recommend it! But don't expect a sushi boat."}
{"text":"Went there today for all day happy hour which my family has enjoyed for the past few months since moving back to Phoenix. We thought it was weird that it was closed at 630pm on Sunday so we went to TKs. They told us they are closed down. Sad to see it go. Need to find a new happy hour."}
{"text":"For a trendy place, Stingray serves some good sushi."}
{"text":"Ordered one of the boats with some coworkers and the fish was not very good. It wasn't fresh and the rice wasn't good either. If you're a person who eats a lot of rice, you can tell the rice wasn't cooked right because it was hard, cold, and just not right. I wouldn't recommend this place for sushi and I don't think I would come back here again for sushi. Sorry :/"}
{"text":"We went to celebrate a friend's birthday. Our waitress brought out a piece of chocolate cake for him at the end of dinner. It was completely unprompted so we thought it was complimentary, until we realized she charged us for it on our bill... Who does that?"}
{"text":"Good food, but horrible service. I've been here once a year ago, and they completely forgot about our order, so we had to ask for a few times since we waited for 50 min for our food. The manager took off one of the rolls on our bill. 

we went back yesterday, giving this place a second chance and it was still a disappointment. We got there at 7:30, on a Sunday, and it was mostly empty. Our waitress took 25min to come back to us after bringing water, and we had to motion for her to come to our table. Our food also took awhile, and they forgot our appetizer. Either this waitress is an airhead or this restaurant is very poorly run. The food was decent, but I will not be returning due to the horrible service."}
{"text":"When I get a craving for sushi and want to stuff my face, I go to Stingray!  Why?  It's a great deal for good food.  Note: this is ONLY the Happy Hour.  At all other times I would be a irked by the prices for standard sushi-fare.  But, at Happy Hour I can get full-sized special rolls and their delicious crispy spicy tuna sushi for $5 or less each.  The only roll I wasn't happy with was the Shrimp Tempura.  The shrimp tempura wasn't very crunchy, giving the impression it had been surrounded by the moist roll for a while, and the other filling was that fake krab stuff which was also a little dry.  Other than that their sushi is fine.  The Happy Hour menu is also very broad, with a variety of appetizers.  I love love love the seaweed salad.  

They have good drink deals, too.  I usually get the beer (huge Japanese bottle) +sake for $5.  But, stay away from the cocktails.  They look delicious.  They sound delicious.  But, stay away!  I've tried maybe half of them, and to be honest none of them were good.  Some were even bad.  The rose one looks like it'll be amazing, but it basically tastes like soda water with cheap, cloying rose flavoring.  It was a struggle to finish it.  At least they make them pretty strong.  Or stick with beer and sake and you'll be a-ok.  

Parking is surprisingly convenient.  You can park right in front of the restaurant and get a yellow token that they'll validate for you.  The staff is friendly, but it does get really crowded during happy hour (you'll probably have to wait for a table if you get there any time after 4:45).  So, ordering water and more food may be a bit of a struggle, but as long as you keep an eye out and don't hesitate with the \"excuse me!\"s then you should be fine.  

It's a really nice location and the decor is relaxed and stylish, and very new-looking.  If you can sit outside it's lovely to lean back in their cushy chairs and revel in the sushi-delicious just consumed.  Even if you can't get an outside seat they open the floor-to-ceiling windows so the whole restaurant feels open.  It's a great date spot as it doesn't get as crazy and loud as Sapporo, and it looks more stylish than the other tastier sushi restaurants.  Plus, you can walk around the Biltmore Fashion Park afterwards.  

Stingray isn't the best sushi in town and their dreadful cocktails definitely pull their food down to 3 star quality, but they've got a great Happy Hour and a great ambiance with that delicious seaweed salad and spicy crispy tuna so I'll give them 4."}
{"text":"My wife really wanted to come here. I used to think this was the best in town, but things have changed. It seems like every time I walk away from here my thoughts are on \"I just paid $.... for that!\" It seems like prices went up and quality went down when they opened at the Biltmore. I guess they have to cover that rent with higher prices."}
{"text":"Horrible! The water smelled like fish and they didnt offer to bring more so we had to order drinks which they charged us for. We ordered 3 rolls and they brought us one wrong roll and then said they would take it off the bill but I had to wait an additional 10 mins for the correct roll and then they charge me for it. When I asked to speak to the manager, she was even more rude. She ended up not charging me for the roll bc she couldnt prove I was lying (after she went to look for the sheet of paper we filled out) and told me to make sure next time I ordered the right roll! The waitress never read back what we had written down in the first place which they almost always do at every well done sushi place I've been to so how would I even know if I wrote down on the wrong line. Yes people make mistakes on both ends but I know I didn't because I double checked but for them to be so incredibly rude was shocking! When the waitress brought back the corrected bill she didn't stop as she walked by she dropped it on the table. Never once apologized and to top it off the roll I had ordered was not good once I got mine when everyone else had already finished eating. I will never return and will for sure recommend going anywhere else!"}
{"text":"I'm a regular here at Sting Rays and absolutely love the rolls. The Cabo is to die for!  The atmosphere is open and friendly, though the tables are close together and you are very close to other couples, it makes for easy conversing.
Tonight we were graced with the presence of the manager, Tom. He was an absolute delight! Very friendly, personable and made us feel very welcome!"}
{"text":"Firstly, I would like to say that I **WAS** a pretty regular customer here. 

Normally don't take to Yelp to talk about a poor dining experience, but as the manager of the restaurant refuses to do one of his basic job functions and talk to his customers, I guess this will do. 

I think the fact that every single time I dine in, there is a whole new team of servers speaks volumes about this place and the people who run it. I don't think I'd want to work for someone like the person I spoke to on the phone today either. 

Great food, sometimes you'll get good service (really just depends on the server.) I ate here pretty regularly, but will not give this place anymore of my business! Time to find a new sushi place.

I was charged twice for my dinner, called the manager and was hung up on. I guess there was an error and I was charged for another table's table that was around $50. I guess that there was an error of some sort and that the money will not be taken out of my account. Odd that it has? Anyways, most people would like to know when there's been an error with something as serious as your bank account. Was I told before leaving? No. I was left to find this error out on my own and to call on my own time to be hung up on. 

And lets be real, the sushi rolls taste the same here as they do anywhere else. There is absolutely no difference between Stingray and any other sushi place in Phoenix. The upscale ambiance is nice - but the food is not anything special. This was my go to sushi restaurant, because I liked the location and menu. NOT because of quality or service.  

The manager stated \"well, I'm the owner it is not my job to impress you.\" H I L A R I O U S words to hear out of someone's mouth, that own's a business that is only as successful as it's customers are happy. LMAO!!!

My advice? Find a better sushi place, one that respects it's customers. There's a million other sushi places that I look forward to."}
{"text":"Pretty pricey unless you go for happy hour, which we did. Lots of sushi roles at half price. Can't beat it. Goes until 6:30 PM on week nights."}
{"text":"The bartenders are super friendly, And the quality of the fish is great! I've been eating sushi since I was 6, and I will recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"This is the best Stingray location IMO.

The sushi is always fresh and the drinks are always delicious."}
{"text":"Dont get me wrong, I love Stingray's menu but this location has the absolute worst service.

I went here for my bachelorette dinner. They sat us on the patio and completely forgot about us for about 20 mins. We asked several different servers that came to see if we were ok for water, full dining sets, etc. and none of them ever came back. It wasnt until I was seen by one of the waitresses eating my sushi w/ my fingers that they actual brought me a plate and chopsticks ( we asked 4 different girls for it over the hour ). 

I'll be sticking to the Biltmore location."}
{"text":"Havent been here in a while but service is not a priority on Sundays(seemed very under staffed, like 3 servers for 20 active tables). 15 minute wait to get someone to take drink order for the table, by then we just ordered everything. Edamame under cooked, fish was not fresh and looked dry and old (i didnt touch it). Anyhow I wonder if this is why the one in old town scottsdale closed, not surprised if this one is next. Went to Zinburger next door and saw the people that were a table away from me at stingray. Never coming back. 
If you think i got paid by Zinburger for this review, zinburger also has large areas of opportunity when it comes to service, but at least the food is better. Go to Hillstone if in that area, no complaints there."}
{"text":"I really recommend this place, but unless the food is great, I don't hand out four stars and above. Go for the atmosphere, the atmosphere is probably the best I've experienced in all of Phoenix so far.

The great thing about this place is the atmosphere. It's hip, and modern with an Asian influence.

The best thing about this haunt is the staff. We sat at the bar, and the manager, the bartenders and most of the rest of the staff circling about were friendly and very helpful. I drink shoot loads of water, I can get through more than 5 glasses in one meal. Not once was my water glass empty. She just kept filling it up. Also we wanted to watch the game (Sunday Football) and turn on the closed captioning, they spent a good 15 minutes figuring it out, just for us. Awesome people, plus they were chatty but not intrusive.

The second best thing is the bartender. Her cocktails, we had a Geisha a Go Go and Kimono Dragon. The Kimono Dragon was great (being sweet) while the Geisha a Go Go was not as sweet, more alcoholic and tasted like watermelons as it should.

Unfortunately, the food wasn't the best. I had the Vegetable Udon. The flavor was good, but it was so salty. I have to agree with another yelper that they use way too much Soy Sauce.
We also had a variety of sushi's. We had sashimi and some other raw fishes and no one got sick, a big plus in the Valley. The flavor was ok, but it didn't leave my mouth watering. We had some spicy tuna, some sashimi, some fish eggs, and this and that.

I wouldn't go hunt this place down and make it a place to go to when I'm wanting some good food, but if I'm totally down on the atmosphere. It's really somewhere I'd go and just sit around for two hours or so. The food isn't great, but the great atmosphere and the staff is well worth the bill easily racked up. Lastly, we had the chocolate cake, it was definitely chocolatey and relatively moist.

... I lo"}
{"text":"The food here was pretty good as was the location. Wow! I did not have any expectations of Scottsdale before my recent trip and all the locations amazed me. This was probably one of my favorites. It is located in such a hip and fun shopping/dining area. The service was not good. We had 1 waitress for 20 people. The manager did comp us for the trouble but it took us 4 hours to eat. The happy hour specials are great!"}
{"text":"We went here because we'd heard it was good and although we don't do sushi they had plenty of  other choices that looked good. 
I ordered the Yakiniku which is \"shaved NY  strip\" with stir fried vegetables.  
The flavor was OK but the beef was almost undetectable. With no exaggeration at most there were 2 ounces, probably less. My wife wanted to try it and I didn't have the heart to tell her that she took almost all of the meat so I pretty much had a vegetarian meal. The service was about the same as a fast food restaurant which is to say just barely adequate. I would only recommend this place to someone I truely dislike."}
{"text":"Just meah!  Honestly, not impressed with the overall experience.  Great looking restaurant with a beautiful layout and friendly staff, but the sushi just isn't that good.  Just average or below average sushi that quite frankly tastes fishy, so didn't appear to be very fresh."}
{"text":"Great sushi selection & atmosphere. A good date night spot or fun place to go with the girls. The food is fresh & the service is good, one of our go to spots!"}
{"text":"Service is very, very slow. Skip it if you are on any type of a schedule or have anywhere to be in the next two hours. You will wait for ages for food to appear. Today, I walked out after 50 minutes of waiting for the sushi to arrive. That wasn't a fluke, I've seen other customer walk out. Tried to send them an email about their slow kitchen service, the email got bounced. So here I am on Yelp!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  Every time my husband and I come to Scottsdale we have to eat here!  They have some of the best sushi in Scottsdale and the service and atmosphere rocks as well!
They also have a great happy hour where you get great deals on sushi rolls and drinks!
I'm giving this place a thumbs up and will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"We came here because Geisha a Go Go across the street was absolutely packed. We sat at the bar and right off the bat, the bartender did not seem like she wanted to be there although she was catering big time to the male only clientele. My boyfriend ordered an Asahi beer and even specified \"beer\" not sake, because that's a common mistake, and after waiting 10 minutes for her to deliver it, she still came out with sake and not beer. Then I ordered the Crispy Tuna, and after waiting another 15 minutes for it, she came out with the spicy tuna roll and realized her mistake after setting it down and said she'd get me the right order. While we are waiting for about 20 minutes for our order, everyone around us who came in AFTER us is getting roll after roll, finally we told her if it hasn't been started, just cancel it. She said \"I think they started it - let me check...\" then came back out and said yes, they started making it. 15 minutes later, she checks again and came back out and said \"I'm sorry, for some reason a big table got their order in before you so it's not ready yet\". We cancelled the order all together. StingRay gets 2 stars because the bartender comped us our beer and soda. P.S. WAY, WAY overpriced for what it is!"}
{"text":"This place has great decor and some smokin servers from time to time, but the food and prices have been a disappointment on every occasion.

I can't tell you how many times I have given this place a chance over the past 4 or more years. On some occasions we were there for a birthday, and on other occasions just to grab a quick bite.

The dishes which contain chicken breast have always been overcooked and very dry. As for the Sushi rolls, they are far from the best, and certainly nothing special. On occasion they have a rendition of ceviche or a squid salad which both sound promising. Once again on each occasion, the presentation was there, but the portions were very small, certainly didn't taste like anything that was satisfying, and the price tag was insulting for what we had.

The only reason that I go to this place at all now, is to grab a quick drink if I'm walking around the area.

This is one of those places that creates the stereotypical Scottsdale image, just as RA does just up the street. It's a place to say that you ate at if you want to be a stereotypical, brain dead, Scottsdale doucher. The fact that you consider it to be the best means one of the following:

1.) You were extremely fortunate and your food was prepared and presented to perfection.

2.) You have no idea what good sushi consists of, and are probably a huge fan of California, Las Vegas, or Godzilla rolls.

or

3.) You are a young blonde bombshell with no brain who thinks that it's cool to eat Sushi because you are a sheep and think that everything that you see on 'Keeping up with the Kardashian's' is what real life is all about. (or because you watch some other BS show on MTV and are influenced by the complete ass hats with no brains).

Either way, this place is typically a terrible place to go and eat if you want to enjoy good Sushi, Sashimi, etc.

They do have a nicely decorated interior and sit at a nice location in old town.

If you're dating a younger girl with her head in the clouds she will love this place! =)

Sorry for the rant and ill painted picture, you can see that I'm over the Scottsdale illusion and have no tolerance for it...

If you are in the area, I would hit Kyoto or Pearl before this place, but a quick drive to Missouri and 7th ave will get you the best Sushi experience with a decent price tag.

Cheers and much luv! =)

FYI...I'm certainly not hating on blonde females, I love them to death as long as they don't fit into that superficial stereotype."}
{"text":"It's simply amazing how you can take a restaurant that has pretty good food, decent ambiance, and have the service people knock the rating from a four star to a two, but indeed, it happened tonight, and it happened at Stingray.

My work buddy and I went to Stingray for the first time tonight.  The drinks?  Good.  The tuna rolls?  Very good.  The sashimi?  Excellent (though the portions were small and the saba portions ridiculously small.  I don't get that.)  So the food was decent.  Nothing to write home about.  Now, about the waitress and the busboy?  Obnoxious--as in \"over the top.\"  If you read my other reviews you know I try to keep it positive and upbeat and I \"try\" for humorous, but when there's a problem, I say so.  So, onto Ms. Obnoxious.  My waitress, Jane (or so it says on my receipt) felt it was completely appropriate to interrupt our conversation six distinct and separate times, to ask us how we were doing and to see if we would order something else.  No \"excuse me,\" no politely waiting for a sentence to finish.  Just bam, in your face.  Rude.  Just the fact that I got to the point where I was preoccupied enough by it to start counting ... well peeps, speechless over here.  Take a hike, Jane.  Jane had absolutely no consideration for the fact we were the customer and the she was intruding, and let me make this clear if you are reading this, Jane.  You were extremely invasive.  Tone it down.  Simply obnoxious.  

Next, (again mid-conversation) someone else comes over to lower the parasol over our head.  This, as I came to find out, is anything but a trivial process.  It takes five+ minutes.  As I repeatedly ducked he narrowly missed my head head with the metal support to the parasol two or three times. I couldn't help wondering two things:  a) does this really have to happen now?  and b) what special gifts from above have landed on that parasol throughout the day that are now in my sushi?  Are you kidding me?  We're eating here, dude!.   

And then there's the busboy, which as well-intentioned as I assume he was, was hell-bent on reaching between us to grab dishes, some of which had not been used yet. Wow.  All in all MAXIMUS inturruptus.  

Now--to sum up ... no need to send sympathy cards.  My friend and I managed to have a wonderful time because it's what we do, and despite what were well in excess of a dozen individual and significant interruptions we had fun.   It's about the people you chose to hang with.  But back to Jane et al, I mean seriously, people, you gotta chill.  If for no other reason, think of your dwindling tip potential!  Next time I will take my order to go.  Just proved to me how over the years I have mellowed out, because a few years ago I have had the manager at my table.  

To the people who visited our table tonight:  I hope you are never in a restaurant and receive the service we received while visiting yours."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Stingray with high hopes based on a previous visit to another location. This experience was a large disappointment. 

We arrived at 6:15 on a Thursday evening, and we were able to get a seat right away. We found out we were there during happy hour, so we ordered drinks and appetizers. The drinks were good, and unique, and the crunchy spicy tuna appetizer was also good, but that was where it ended. 

The other appetizer was a shrimp tempura roll, which was average at best, then came the main course. My wife ordered the spicy shrimp roll which was also average, with more rice than fish, and the lava roll, which was awful, with the fish glob on top being all mushy as if it had been pre-chewed and spit on top of the roll. 

I ordered the seared big eye tuna. The risotto it came with was outstanding, the tuna was, in a word, awful. The flavor was good, but this was the first piece of fish I have ever had that couldn't be eaten because of sinews running through it. I had to cut away over 1/3 of the meat because it couldn't be cut or chewed. 

To top it off, the service was poor at best. The staff was friendly, but our water ran out numerous times, our server was hard to find, and the coup de gras was that they completely forgot my order. My wife had completely finished both plates of her sushi (well, she didn't eat the lava rolls because they were awful) and my tuna still hadn't arrived. When our server finally walked by after 25-minutes (not exaggerating, we watched the time) and asked she went to the kitchen and came back explaining the kitchen was \"backed up.\" Considering I ordered a dish that required all of 2 minutes to cook, I wasn't buying it. The manager walked by and I said something to him, he went in the kitchen and came back about 2-minutes later with my dinner. Both the manager and server apologized - but THAT WAS IT! Not so much as a coupon for discount next time, or my entre being comped, nothing. I understand restaurants make mistakes, but own up to it, and do something about it. 

Not that I spend a lot of time in Scottsdale, but I can assure you we will NOT be going back."}
{"text":"i had a pleasant experience with stingray the service was outstanding, the food was phenomenal and the dining atmosphere was everything anyone can ask for in fine dining.

ill definitely be going back"}
{"text":"Happy happy happy hour.  

How's the sushi?  It's ok.  Don't care, happy hour.
How's the service?  Mostly very good.  Don't care though, happy hour.
How's the happy hour?  Glad you asked.  It's outstanding.  2:30p-6:30p every day and best of all, all day Sunday.  With a drink menu that is fun, a good selection of beers, a long list of apps, and a nice patio when the weather cooperates I see some commercial space next to Pita Jungle and the AMC coming available for you enterprising restauranters there."}
{"text":"We usually dine out a lot and been to Stingray couple times and wasn't too happy with the service. Recently we've decided to give it another try and get Sunday happy hour. This time around we had wonderful service and food came out accordingly. I think management was much better and fish was fresh."}
{"text":"The happy hour, M-F, 5-7pm is the best sushi value in the city.  All of the sushi was great for the price.  I would not recommend the tempura unless you are a fan.  Overall happy hour, A+."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  I think because its in such a touristy area, they can get away with being less than average. Server was very pleasant but the disappointment was with our food and drink. Flat coke, it actually tasted like the lines were dirty. My friend's coffee was murky luke warm and just bad. I hoped the sushi
Would be better. We decided to just order one roll to see if it would be decent. Sadly, it was the worst spicy scallop roll I've ever had. Prices were high (but I guess expected due to location).  Sorry stingray but this was a real miss!"}
{"text":"Second time for me at the Stingray at Scottsdale Quarter.  Amazingly good food.  The sushi is fresh and flavorful and the bento boxes are excellent with large portions.  A terrific restaurant."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for 5 years now, The food is yummy, service always friendly and I love their unique cocktails! The place is really clean but the ladies bathroom does needs some repair work done on their doors. 
I hope they open a location in North Phoenix soon because when a Sushi Craving hits a 25 min drive can be torture!"}
{"text":"Stingray used to be my go to sushi joint... I don't know what's happened to make them go down hill so fast! The last two times I have been there the food has been mediocre at best, service totally so-so and felt beyond rushed. And on my last visit I had to send our Yellowtail roll back because it was so fishy that I had a serious concern for my health. The waitress seemed annoyed that we wanted to send it back and didn't want to replace it with a new roll. 
On the upside, if there really is one is that they have one of the best happy hours around. Which honestly is the only reason I have been back. Oh and they have amazing cocktails, my fav is the Kiwi Collins. 

I just wish that they would improve the quality of their food and their the attitudes of their servers."}
{"text":"Great food and service. I love the yellowtail collar called Hamachi Kama it's a must try. The green mussels are amazing when they have them in. Best sushi in Scottsdale in my opinion better that RA Sushi. 
Gotta try this place."}
{"text":"I'm not impressed with their medium to high priced menu. Sushi is never cheap, but the quality of the sushi rolls and presentation is a bit messy and not impressive for the high-end decorated type of restaurant. I've had way better quality, presentation, and taste at other sushi restaurants that are not high-end. I guess we were paying for the ambiance and decorations more than anything."}
{"text":"Continuing in the week of lunch, I ventured out the other day to Stingray. A coworker and I were craving some sushi, and they love Stingray, so I decided to give it a whirl. I was well warned of the teasing that could easily be done to all the fantasy perfect waitresses, so this I was expecting (and somewhat looking forward to).

I have to admit I wasn't all that impressed with the inside, but I did really enjoy the patio area. It was the perfect place to relax and people watch, which was most excellent that day in particular. The place settings were appreciated, as a lot of places do not offer a stone or cradle to rest your sticks on.. and hell, even my home set has cradles. I made sure of that. 

Also, while the service was good... I think everyone set my expectations pretty high for the waitresses... I was unable to do any harassing. Sad face.

One suggestion if you go... try the green tea. Two reasons. First,  the cups are incredible. I love them. I am considering it a collect them all game and will try to make damn sure I do. Second, the tea is delicious. I had two amazing cups.

The sushi isn't all that bad either. It could've been just me, but I found the selection of sushi a little limited and the specialty ones pretty overpriced, but the sushi I had was out of this world. I had the spicy scallop and the summertime soy paper roll. I seriously gobbled down that summertime roll fast and impressed many. 

I'll probably be back if I crave sushi at lunchtime again. However, I really get disappointed at the prices of the ones I would like to try (especially for lunch) and think I may run out of new dishes to try soon."}
{"text":"Not super impressed. Would take Geisha over Stingray any day, but Stingray isn't awful. Seems Stingray has a more extensive list of sashimi-type dishes though, which is cool for a change."}
{"text":"I have eaten sushi all over the world and I have to say this place has the sushi business figured out!! The service is always good and the food cant be beaten !! You can take anyone here from a professional business partner to your buddies at happy hour..."}
{"text":"joined a group of friends for happy hour, service was slow and wait staff seemed flustered and unorganized. a friend's sushi order was wrong and they seemed upset we weren't willing to take on the check of someone who had left earlier we really didn't know. They also added gratuity and the waitress didn't bother to mention it to a friend that was obviously leaving an additional 20+%. We did enjoy an outstanding noodle dish w scallops."}
{"text":"Eat at sushi bar, staff is friend and fun!"}
{"text":"I go to this sushi place on an insanely regular basis - not only for dining in but also to-go. It's a super easy place to get to in the Biltmore area with ample parking not only in the free lot, but the lot that provides 2 free hours with a token. 

Their sushi is pretty legit - I know that there's a few places around town that are better, but this place is pretty easy to get to, great atmosphere, and decent prices. Their spicy tuna is one of my favorites in the universe. Or just the state - but still. I always thought the quality of the rolls were pretty awesome. 

Great date restaurant - an upscale atmosphere, but try to sit outside or in the booths - as the tables are sat way too close together for a private conversations in the dining room. However, if you sit at the bar you get complimentary edamame and miso soup.

For the most part, you get served in a reasonable amount of time. I've only had to wait for a long time a few different times, and the server was very apologetic. Overall the serves are very well-versed in sushi and saki and can be a really helpful resource. 

Also, awesome bathrooms. Which, of course, I always have to comment on. 

Last tip; Try the sparkling sake that comes in a pink bottle. Perhaps my favorite sake ever made."}
{"text":"Best sushi place in town! I love the crunchy roll with eel sauce and an awesome martini. If you love sushi you'll love it here!"}
{"text":"The original plan wasn't actually to go to Stingray tonight but I'm soooo happy we ended up here!  Bestie and I decided to do dinner once she got off work at Dry Bar and we were going to go to True Foods but there was a 35 minute wait and we were too hungry to sit around seeing and smelling everything to be able to handle that.  It was beautiful out so we were trying to find somewhere that had patio seating available and saw that Stingray had a couple free tables.

We were seated right away and giving some time to peruse the menus.  A couple minutes later our waitress, Elle, came over to get our drink order.  Now, Bestie is pregnant but has been craving beer forever and didn't see it on the menu so she asked if they had non-alcoholic beer.  Elle said that they did but she wasn't sure which brand it was so she told her she'd check and let her know.  When she came back it was a brand neither of us recognized so my friend was a little hesitant to order it but Elle made sure to let her know that if she didn't like it she could send it back.

Another issue with being pregnant is obviously certain foods you can and can't eat but Elle made that a lot easier for my friend too.  She told her that the foods with stars next to them on the menu were the raw ones so she should avoid those but she also told her that if she wanted one of the rolls that had raw foods in it she could have them not put them in so that she could still eat it.  We were both blown away at how helpful this girl was and she was super friendly the whole time too.

Food itself was awesome too!  I ordered a Dragon Roll and a Spicy Tuna.  BFF got a Dragon roll as well and a Las Vegas roll.  The quality of everything was excellent, very fresh and the flavors were wonderful.  The rolls were good sized too, I think there were about 8 pieces for each one so I was stuffed at the end of the meal.  I'm very happy that my friend is gonna be working 50 feet from this place so that I have an excuse to come in more often!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere would be considered upscale. It was a little stuffy on the inside, in my opinion, so we decided to sit on the patio. 
I ordered sushi, and it tasted very fresh and was well-prepared. 
The service could have used some improvement though, based on our experience. Our waitress seemed like she was new, and wasn't too knowledgeable when it came to the menu. She also somehow missed getting us soy sauce when she delivered our sushi, and didn't stop in to our table frequently enough to check on us.
I would go back, but with slightly lower expectations for the service."}
{"text":"That's what I needed.  Great sushi, kids loved it.  Tatum is a sushi lover too!  Apps where awesome.   Great spot to watch some World Cup and enjoy some yummy lunch."}
{"text":"I LOVE Stingray Sushi! I used to work at the Courtyard right behind this place, and a lot of guests came in raving about this place. I decided to go give it a try myself, & it was one of the best decisions I made!  Each of the times I went the server was phenomenal and extremely helpful! They knew everything good and not the greatest on the menu, even weren't serving items that the cook knew was not perfect.  Every time I ordered sake, the service was never lacking so much so that the server kept coming back to refill our glasses to avoid giving us bad luck.  Definitely my go to sushi place when I come to visit Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I went to Stingray today with a girl friend for a second time. The first time we went there it was for happy hour and the service was terrible but the food was good so we figured we would try it again. 

Once again, the food was great, service HORRIBLE. We were sat in front of the kitchen door and not only did we see our server in the kitchen combing her hair with her fingers, she then picked up our food and brought it to us. VERY unsanitary. We waited 15 minutes while our dirty plates were piled on our table and no water left in out glasses because our server was standing in the kitchen, talking, texting, and playing with her hair. 
AND WHY DO THEY HAVE THEIR HAIR DOWN ANYWAYS? It is a restaurant! Disgusting."}
{"text":"Holy happy hour. $3 house wines, rolls, wow.  Is this the best sushi in Phoenix? No, but their happy hour rocks. $3 wines and cheap as hell rolls.  Um, okay!!  Yeah, this is in the mall (rolling my eyes), but they do have a great patio (facing the mall parking lot), misters, you name it.  The deals you get here for HH are fantastic. If you want a cheap drink, and fresh basic rolls... this is a great spot."}
{"text":"I like this place. They have a great patio overlooking Old Town, bonus. They have a fantastic Happy Hour menu where you can get specials on rolls and drinks.  Ranging from $5 and up, you can't beat that.  Now, their main menu is average as far as price and you do have to pay an extra $2 for real crab, rather than \"krab\".  So I find that a bit shady.    

They have a wide variety of speciality rolls and your basic hand rolls as well. I have had their yellowtail sashimi a few times and I find it always to be fresh."}
{"text":"Great sushi! Try the cabo roll! Good service and good atmosphere. The nigiri was extremely fresh and best miso soup I've ever had."}
{"text":"Waiter forgot to come back and take our order for main course . Stinky Sea Bass was revolting .
Spicy roll was similar to the roll you buy in grocery store for 8 bucks . Tuna had the borderline fishy going off taste .Would not come back"}
{"text":"Went a couple weeks ago with some co workers- amazing food!! Will definitely go back !"}
{"text":"I'm a little biased because I used to work at a sushi restaurant in Saint Louis during college, and to be honest this place teetered between a 3 and 4 star ranking. The sushi was good, but not the best. There's a lot of deep fried rolls.. This place was definitely redeemed by their all day happy hour on Sunday (decent selection of rolls that are half off!) and the servers were super friendly. I'll come back to Stingray, but I think I'll try a few other sushi bars in the area first."}
{"text":"I could hardly hear the waitress, have a conversation with my wife, or even think. Food was good, but not worth putting up with the noise.  Stick to the Stingray in Old Town."}
{"text":"Great environment and fun place to go out on a date. Las vegas and caterpillar rolls are my favorite from here. Sake bombers are also tasty. Guys don't get caught looking at the ultra fine greeters when you enter the restaurant. Specially when you are with your girl like I was lol."}
{"text":"Had some killer sushi for lunch at Stingray today!

The Crunchy Spicy Tuna Sushi is totally different than any where I have experienced it.  A well seasoned really combined tuna mixture sits atop a crispy rice rectangular tasty amazing thing!  You must order this...very special.

The Spyder Roll was super fresh and a nice big portion.

Shrimp Tempera Roll was delicious as well.

The atmosphere was fun and the service was speedy and friendly.  There were so many choices that sounded fabulous on the menu and we look forward to going there and experiencing many more items!"}
{"text":"You know those really lazy Sunday afternoons when you're doing nothing but channel surfing and there's absolutely NOTHING good on TV except Waterworld & Die Hard II both of which you've seen a million times but you settle for watching again anyway because the thought of getting up and actually doing something productive doesn't even enter your mind?  That's how Stingray is: convenient, easy, you know the mediocrity you're about to receive and you're ok with that.  
Went there for lunch last week with colleagues because we can walk through the underpass from our office at the Esplanade.   We ordered the basics, which were... basic.  Edamame was only slightly over-cooked.  Tuna roll was so-so tuna, shrimp tempura roll was standard and not bad, yellowtail was actually pretty darn good.  Shrimp/Veggie tempura yet again your basic side.  One co-worker ordered the vegetable udon soup, and she really liked it.   
The decor is sleek and modern, and I have an inkling this place gets  scene-y at night.  I will definitely come back to try their happy hour, because the specials and prices sound 3-star worthy.
Our server was adequate and friendly, but why do I need to see so much boob during my meal?  I got 'em too, honey, if I want to see some perkies I'll hang out in front of a mirror.   Or I'll head over to  one of Phoenix's classy gems like Alaskan Bush or Highlighter.  I don't want to have such close-calls with your nipple during my meal at Stingray on a Tuesday at lunchtime with co-workers!  Higher cut t-shirts please!"}
{"text":"Here's a tip for the staff: if you are going to pretend that the sushi is made fresh and you seat a party at the booth next to the sushi chef, maybe the sushi chef should leave the prep area or someone should come in contact with him in between the time someone orders and the sushi is served. That, and have the sushi not taste like it was made a week ago nor smells like a contaminated beach at low tide. 

I've had better and less rubbery sushi at a gas station. 

The waitresses pay more attention to Macedonian congressional tax reform debates than to the patrons, the chef looks bored, and the patrons appear more interested in being seen than any semblance of dining. And the food? I'd rather lick the floor of the AMC movie theater across the street. 

That being said, the iced tea was pretty nice. Not that we got more than one refill..."}
{"text":"By far my favorite sushi spot. The guys working behind the sushi bar are friendly and really take the time to explain anything and really make you feel welcome! We tried the tuna steak-rare and it was absolutely amazing. We also ordered a few sushi rolls and I would say they were lovely as well. Sitting at the bar is the best deal because they bring you edamame and soup with your meal. Happy hour is the best here and for that reason Im a regular and every experience here has made me want to come back!"}
{"text":"I'll give you several good reasons to eat here, particularly men. 
First, it's in the new Scottsdale Quarter, which if you haven't been to yet is worth the trip. 
Lots of upper end shops that attract lots of highbrow folks, but my main reason for going to Stingray...to people watch.

On a typical weekend night, the place is littered with orange tanned women, botched plastic surgeries, cougars of every persuasion, and women of a certain age who simply can't let go of their youth, evidenced by their twenty something fashion and styling. 
The food?
I'm not a Sushi aficionado, so I can't distinguish good yellowtail from whale blubber. Its all rubbery and flavorless to me. But thank God for pickled ginger, wasabi, soy sauce and beer. I can make a meal out those four things alone as I so often do.
But the real reason to eat here is to impress your woman, or any neighboring table of single women should you be dining out with the guys.

I've long held that eating sushi, more particularly sashimi, is an erotic metaphor of sorts. The connotation being that if you eat something really flubbery and disgusting, and, with the faint bouquet of fish, your date, or that gaggle of neighboring cougar divorcees will reason how it shouldn't be a problem for you to munch whatever flubbery mess they're bagging down south. 
You don't even need to like sushi, and it just bought you game! A huge win-win in my book.

So being in a place where the women are mostly Scottsdale forty or fifty something divorcees sporting orange accented cleavage and skinny jeans, and, where the food serves as an erotic bellwether, signaling your prowess at eating anything even remotely disgusting, you should consider this place one of Scottsdale's finest!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was great, this whole area in the Scottsdale Quarter is pretty cool.  The front door to this place is deceiving and we almost walked right by it.  I was not impressed by the sushi, wouldn't say it was bad but I nothing stood out.  Our waitress was training and she was super nice but her trainer looked like she just found out someone died (not kidding).  I think she maybe smiled twice the whole time.  I like taking the wife out for dinner and she loves sushi but it has to make an impression to go back."}
{"text":"Food is good, but the service is terrible! The lobster tacos where very good and tasty! Music was way too loud!"}
{"text":"I had heard from a few people that this was a pretty decent, especially if you are in the area, since Zen 32 is long gone. 

I went here for a quick takeout, a rainbow roll and two avacado rolls. I was told 15 minutes. I waited in my car out front and read a little. I went in 20 minutes later, still not ready. This was the middle of the afternoon and the place was dead. I ended up waiting 45 mins for my takeout, I could have just gone home and made dinner at that point. A manager was even standing there during all of this and didn't say a thing.

The rolls themselves were ok, nothing spectacular. Whitefish can be difficult, I understand that, but this was a sad grey, about room temp, and not very good. The rest was ok. 

I won't be bothering with this place again. In all honesty, RA has better sushi, and thats sad."}
{"text":"Alright , now This is a BAR! whoo hoo.

We decided to stop here as we waited until our reservations at another restaurant and walked up to the bar. 

Scene- Walking in your overwhelmed with bright reds, loud music and the hustle and bustle, in a good way. Very active social bar scene.

We didn't eat on this visit, but having been here before I can tell you the eats are on point and always fresh.

Staff- The bartenders were very interactive and talkative . I asked about some interesting bottle that drape the back walls that I was unfamiliar with and they were more than happy to spend some time to talk and explain what they were and what drinks they are in, even though it was busy.

Overall, a great drink spot."}
{"text":"We always have a great time here and they have an awesome happy hour! This time around, it was 4 of us and we all had multiple drinks, tons of sushi and a bunch of other apps for under $100 not including tip."}
{"text":"We had dinner here last night and was only going to rate them 4 stars because of the delicious sushi, but weird backward service. It was strange that no hostess seated us, and no server took our order! So we just went in and sat at the Sushi bar. We just handed our order to the Sushi Chef at the counter, and he made our sushi in a jiff. Excellent! That scored him a $10 tip from my friend Nicole. Then our server finally came after we finished our food. We told her we just want our bill and then she asked us if we still wanted the complimentary soup and edename appetizer. It was bizarre! She was very nice and we assumed she was new, so we forgave her. The quick thinking and very cute manager Nick, however, managed to resolved the issue. He was very apologetic and comped our dinner for the inconvenience. Nice! That bumped up their score. I'll be sure to come back again. lol"}
{"text":"We went there for dinner Friday night.  The service was so-so.  Not sure if the place is a Sushi hotspot?  The big Sushi Bar 20 seats were all open at 8:30 Friday?  Hamachi was very good. Scallop rolls were very good too, But our party ordered a Lobster roll.  It took forever to come out, after three inquiries on status.  50 minutes later, it comes out.  Not like any roll I've ever tried?  My guess is it's a take on a Lobster Roll sandwich New England, Lobster, lettuce  in rice with something on the outside.  \"Nasty\" was the quote from my niece that ordered it.  California Roll not too good either.  They did take the two Lobster Rolls off the bill when brought them out.  So maybe Union next door is a better choice?"}
{"text":"Had a lovely Sunday lunch.   All of the staff were super friendly and attentive.  We shared two different sushi rolls.  Both were delicious.  A firework display of tastes.   Super miso soup and tea as well.  Great architecture and ambiance....including the driving music."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed because the sushi was a bit fishy tasting for it being fresh sushi. Especially considering that the price was not at all cheap, I was expecting better quality. The location is nice and the feel is swanky however the quality of product does not match the location. Never mind the fact that the restaurant was not busy and it took over 30 minutes for my table to receive three sushi rolls. It was definitely a bad idea to order the kid Bento box for my daughter because we were sitting on the patio and by the time the rest of the food came her plate was ice cold."}
{"text":"Stingray is great! Really, coming from me about a Scottsdale establishment of any kind is rather bizarre, I know, but I always have a great time, not entirely too much douchebaggery happening, and they keep their patio appropriately misted. The bar booths are way comfy, the bar stools are nice, and the appointments are great. The service has always been efficient, and the staff seems like they like working with eachother (rare, and awesome). The sushi chefs are skilled, the bartenders pour a sexy drink, and the price point isn't too high.

And, and, and... I like it."}
{"text":"Went there for a late dinner.  Advertised as closing at 11:30 and closed at 10:30.  Really?  Took a 40 dollar Uber to eat here.  Sloppy"}
{"text":"Stingray has THE BEST sushi happy hour. Delicious Vegas and Dragon rolls for $5 each. Sit at the sushi bar, the sushi chefs are super nice and you get complimentary miso soup and edemame."}
{"text":"3 stars we ordered the spicy tuna roll and it was wayyyyy to spicy.  The ambiance of the restaurant is amazing and the drinks were great."}
{"text":"I always expect to pay more money for sushi but I also expect the taste and quality to be worth the money and Stingrays sushi didn't even come close!!! I would have rather given Stingray a 1.5.  Their food is very mediocre and WAY overpriced.  I felt robbed when I left.  I don't normally post reviews about restaurants but I wanted to warn other since felt so cheated out of a good sushi experience.   If you want to hear more ranting read blow:

The service was sub-par, both in serving and in feeling welcome.  The decor is awesome and it looks fancy, a great look for a date, yet only take a date who is afraid to even trying sushi, there isn't much taste in the rolls, so a sushi novice would handle the situation alright.  However the menus are poorly made, so if I hadn't already known some of the rolls I would have never known what they were made of. Only the special rolls have a description. Plus, the heaters outside are too close to the tops of your head, I felt like my forehead was being cooked.

To be fair, I have been to lots of sushi restaurants, expensive and inexpensive, even a bunch in Japan, so I am familiar with good sushi...... and I may be more critical than some.  Thank goodness this was not my first sushi experience. BEWARE!"}
{"text":"Does Stingray have the best sushi in Chandler? No, not by a long shot. But is it a pretty cool place and a great option for happy hour, particularly on your birthday? Yes, definitely.

I came here once with my hubby and he didn't really dig the modern décor and upbeat music. But I thought it was fabulous. Hey, come on, they have a DJ! How awesome is that? So, I decided to come here with a bunch of girlfriends for my birthday. Unfortunately I waited too long to write the review so I can't remember everything we ordered. But we got a ton of food. All the appetizers and rolls were half off. You really can't beat that deal. Some of the items (like their shrimp shumai and Hotty Hamachi maki) were outstanding, most were just ok, and some were downright bad (calamari was way overcooked to the point of being burnt). We also enjoyed the half price cocktails as well. None of these were worth the $9-$11 regular price but for only five bucks during happy hour we were all satisfied. I particularly enjoyed the Tokyo Stock Exchange. I love a drink that has fresh ginger in it. Yum! Our server was a sweet girl and she was very attentive. And as I mentioned, I really do love the atmosphere here. So, I am sure I will be back."}
{"text":"3.5 but way too loud for a bump up! 

Delicious sushi and a cool atmosphere. The wine prices were great -- $22 for some good bottles! 

Very loud for a restaurant and the wait was pretty long."}
{"text":"Great food, good atomphere, good service. Steaks are tender and tasty. Not a fan of Sushi but they have so much more they need to advertise that. My husband saw sushi and didn't want to go. Forget unity I had been there and convince him  that there was lots of things he would like and he did. A little hard to find but worth going can't wait to return. One of my favorite resturants top 10"}
{"text":"Decent Sushi for the Phoenix area. Atmosphere is pretty chill and eating lunch at the Biltmore is always fun.

Service was pretty quick but the ever changing menu is annoying and the waitress on our last trip did not even know it.

They also routinely run out of the fatty tuna which is lame."}
{"text":"Happy hour is great! The bar at the biltmore location is our fave when the weather is nice! Always friendly staff."}
{"text":"I am still a sushi novice and remain in the calm waters of the California roll and salmon rolls - occasionally Philadelphia and Las Vegas....meeting up with Ebony K. she attempted to move me a little more off the wall. I went as far as the rainbow roll and looked at her Unagi Roll...not going that far yet. She is a sushi fan and far more adventurous than I am - she might try a Kraken if they could catch it and put it in a nice hand cut roll - and if it's happy hour, then it's on!

We sat in the back and it was nice and quiet at first, but soon on a Saturday night the place was packed. I will recommend the drinks - she had a pomegranate martini, which was good - but my watermelon martini was phenomenal! 

The service was good, the sushi was fresh, and the atmosphere was excellent. Getting a table wasn't bad - 5pm on Saturday night and we walked right in - later in the evening there was a wait. Parking in that part of Scottsdale is always a challenge. It might be best to just pay the $5 valet and let them worry about finding the spot."}
{"text":"I've been to both Stingrays a few times.
The ambiance is nice, but that's about it.
On a good night, the sushi is average at best.  
If you want quality sushi, look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere with good quality selections at a reasonable price. Waitress attentive. Everything tastes fresh. My complements to the chef!!"}
{"text":"WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!!  

I honestly wish I could give this place no stars.  I was appalled at the restaurants complete lack of regard for their customers.  I arrived with 20 women (two of which were pregnant) for a bachelorette party dinner.  We had an 8pm reservation that we had made weeks in advance. The restaurant even called us that afternoon to confirm the reservation.  Our table was not ready when we arrived and we were all forced to cram into the entryway to wait.  There was no place at the bar or anywhere else for us to sit or even grab a glass of water while we waited.  At 830 we asked if we could get some appetizers and drinks while we waited.  They refused to do so.  They finally sat us at 9pm, an HOUR after our reservation.  What did they do to make up for it?  NOTHING!  We repeatedly asked the manager, waitress and hostess to bring appetizers to the table immediately on the house. They brought 3 small bowls of edamame and one glass of champagne for the bachelorette whose night they had ruined.  

I am astounded that a restaurant would leave 20 guests waiting over an hour without offering them a beverage, appetizer or even an apology.  In fact, rather than trying to apologize or make it up to us with a free round of drinks, they claimed it was our fault because they did not take reservations.  Um, why did you call to confirm it then?  

Our experience was so awful that when we finally got to our second stop, the W, we toasted to \"no longer being at stingray sushi.\"  It was that bad.  The food was decent but they were so rude and put such a damper on our bachelorette's night that I will never go back.  They do not deserve a cent of people's money that they clearly don't respect or appreciate."}
{"text":"Great service and great sushi. Toro is by far the best in the valley. Happy hour is one of the best I have ever encountered in the Valley. Service in wonderful as well. All of the waitresses that I have had have been more than helpful and friendly. After traveling throughout Asia and living in Southern California, I know good sushi, and the sushi at Stingray Biltmore is WONDERFUL. 

Tip: Don't forget to top off your meal with a chocolate cake! and the Patio is INCREDIBLE"}
{"text":"Its been a few weeks since I've eaten here..but its only now that I have time to write this long, overdue review.

Hm...its upscale...kind of comparable to Mikuni's in Sac...but their menu is to some extent, smaller and less tasty.  I don't recall exactly what i ordered but...I wouldn't recommend this place to friends.  It was okay, nothing that stood out...and trust me, food, when its good...it sticks with me.  :) 

 Without further a due, edible but i would never crave for it again."}
{"text":"I want to start this review by saying I love great sushi, I can also learn to love mediocre sushi I'm such a fan. However when I come to a new sushi restaurant I love to test the unique rolls and dishes of the place and thats where Stingray fell short. 

You can come here and get something ordinary done well but when you look to something new or different, they fall flat. I am someone that orders almost everything on the menu when trying out a new place and the majority of unique dishes were dissapointing, specifically lacking in flavor, execution, texture and occassional messy plating, 

I could be swayed if the prices were a little better but for what they charge I wouldn't be afraid to send something back, or shy away from this place all together."}
{"text":"This past week I went to Stingrays for lunch.  It was a late lunch (around 1pm) so the place wasn't overwhelmed with the typical Biltmore lunch suits.   The first thing I noticed was the wonderful patio set up.   The rest of the restaurant was open air so even if you sit inside, its like dining outside.   There is a main dinning room and then a bar area as well.  The decor is inviting, and very modern with a retro 70's feel.  The tables were bamboo so maybe even a \"green\" restaurant?   The seeing was very comfortable too.  

We had sushi but they have a menu with many more things to offer. 

Have the Blueberry Iced tea, it's really good. 

Ambiance / Decor: A+
Drinks: A ( Blueberry Iced Tea)
Food: A
Service: B
Affordability: B (I mean it's probably typical for a sushi joint)

I'm glad there is a new sushi place in the central phoenix area since a nearby establishment (which will remain nameless) lost my business 3 years ago after having I had the last straw with their poor service. 

Stingray is so good we are going back this weekend. YUM!!!!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today- it was good - decent, but nothing off the charts. The tempura app was good - although I prefer a different selection of vegis.  The phildelphia roll was good, but a little heavy on the cream cheese.  I would go there again, but it isn't somewhere I will reorganize my day for or drive across the valley for."}
{"text":"Staff is friendly, sushi is decent, location is pretty cool with both indoor and outdoor areas.  I prefer it to the other nearby sushi places when in this part of Scottsdale."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for a while because the sushi is awesome. The service has been good as well. The ambiance is nice with the DJ spinning on the weekends. 
We will come back here again."}
{"text":"super awesome sushi. get the cucumber rolls, they're the bomb! also the rice wrap sushi is amazing. great service & fabulous food. the only reason they're not getting 5 stars is their bathroom was nasty, no toilet paper, just a kleenex box."}
{"text":"The sushi and food isn't all that, but the cocktails and waitresses are!

Recommendations: Kiwi Collins"}
{"text":"Came here after work one evening for drinks and sushi and had a pretty good time. We grabbed two seats at the bar and the bartender was great and had good recommendations for us. We had sake and shared a few rolls and sashimi, all of which were good. I'd probably return"}
{"text":"Good food not great but good
Nice place 
Very very nice people working in there 
Great for a date :)"}
{"text":"We were seated immediately on a Friday night - great! Then we waited and waited and waited... No one even came to take our drinks, even though the table next to us (who was seated after us) was served. Finally my husband asked someone who our server was - still nada. We were about to leave -- which I have NEVER done! Right as we were getting up, a very nice waitress came to our table and told us that our server was busy (uh... Okay), but that she would help us out.  

We ordered drinks and food, which came out fast after that. I ordered the chirashi and the fan ordered a variety of sushi, tempura, and miso soup. It all tastes very fresh and the chirashi was great. My only complaint of the food is the price. I hate paying $5 for miso soup, but that's what my kids wanted (and ate all of), so I pay it. 

Overall, after the service snafu, it was good. Our stand-in server was great. Will I go back? Probably will try somewhere else before I affirmatively end up here."}
{"text":"I can't believe their half price Kirin Bombers are $6 on HH!! Also, surly bartenders and short drink pours. 

Maybe that's why it's dead on Happy Hour on Friday!

It's also too bad they don't list \"half price\" drink prices on their HH menu. I had to ask for the prices."}
{"text":"The food and sushi is fantastic, but the service is lack luster, and the noise can be overwhelming.  Get there early for happy hour and a more pleasant ambiance."}
{"text":"Stingray has an awesome happy hour and it is not limited to just the bar area. You can enjoy half priced drinks and rolls in the entire restaurant until 7pm. 

I went there yesterday and tried the lemongrass infused vodka (yum) and had a bunch of different rolls and the calamari tempura. While it may not be the best sushi in town it is more than decent and cheap, cheap, cheap.

Great place to meet up with friends after work, but expect it to be crowded as more people learn about the smoking deal on happy hour."}
{"text":"I don't think there were any ugly people in this joint.  The bartenders and waitresses are very sexy.  Sorry ladies, the only male staff were the sushi chefs.  The place on a Friday night was filled to capacity.  I was by myself and decided to sit at the sushi bar.  The chefs were friendly and did a good job.  My Shrimp Tempura roll was good.  Have I had better?  Yes.  I also had Shrimp Shumai, which was very doughy.  I feel bloated as I type this.  Shumai is a dumpling which did not have that consistency it should have.  My waitress was not only beautiful but very attentive and making sure if I needed anything.  Within two minutes of me sitting down, she had my water, miso soup (which was hot and not luke warm), and steamed edamame.  The food was ok,  but what makes me want to come back was the friendly staff and the house music they were playing.  It was a good scene.  It wasn't pretentious.  If you like Sake, get the Hakutsuru Superior.  Sweet Sake!  Do NOT use this for Sake Bombs!  Drink it straight.  I'm giving this 4 stars because the talent in here is phenomenal!  I think there's a prerequisite that you can't be ugly to work here.  Don't expect the food to be stellar and at the same time it's not bad...just average run of the mill."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what happened to this place.  A year ago, it was a very cool, and very busy spot to be!  Any day of the week, happy hour and beyond, Scottsdale's finest glitterati swarmed the place.  EVEN IN AUGUST.

The last two times I've been in, anywhere from 5PM - 8PM, once on a Tuesday, and once on a Saturday, it was dead.  Like, one or two other (small) parties in the whole place.

The service is the same as it's always been - decent, from pretty girls who are personable and polite.  Who can complain?  

The apparent problem?  The sushi kinda sucks.  The cooked food also ain't what it used to be. The quality has overall slid quite a bit since last year. :(

I really hope this place catches itself before the final fateful slide.  It's a super piece of real estate, but Stingray, you can't survive on crap food, even in a great location."}
{"text":"I've been going to the Stingray Sushi in Scottsdale for the past 6 years and their food and service is great.  I was very excited for the new location in our neighborhood to open.  We went during HH and it was busy, but not that busy.  We were quoted a 20-30 minute wait, and after an hour, we were still not sitting.  I discussed with the hostess and asked if they would extend HH pricing due to their error in quoting a wait time, and the manager did not handle the situation properly and was rude.  I expect more from a seasoned restaurant who I know can provide good service and food.  I'm one who is very sensitive to new restaurants and understand there are always kinks to be worked out, but customer service is one thing that can always be good and consistent."}
{"text":"BEST SUSHI EVER!! I love this place. Its my go to place for dates and happy hours. The crunchy spicy tuna and las vegas roll are my favorite rolls!  All the food here is awesome though. I have tried almost everything on the menu and haven't been disappointed. The service is pretty good and the prices are decent! You can't beat happy hour here :)"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant just not this particular location. I went here on wednesday for happy hour and it was super busy! We were seated faster than expected but the food took 50 minutes to get to the table! Overall I'm not the fan of this location but the sushi never disappoints!"}
{"text":"just another mediocre concept restaurant that the greater Phoenix area is famous for. was not worth the 3 mile drive. Scottsdale old town lacation had good food and a great vibe, too bad it's gone"}
{"text":"Great Sunday place for Sushi!! Apps, Making Rolls, and beers 50% off! Sushi is so fresh, staff is very friendly! A must place if your in North Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"My wife and I visited Sunday evening and immediately liked the atmosphere.  The decor is modern without being austere, the music is interesting and conducive to conversation, and the staff is efficient and friendly.  While the happy hour special is nice, it is really too bad the kitchen is sub-par.  

The surf clam was excellent, the salmon sashimi and tuna roll were good too, so too were the lobster and tuna tataki tacos; but the calamari tasted like it came out of a box, and the tuna tataki sashimi tasted like microwaved albacore tuna.  We sent the tuna tataki back (everybody has a bad night) but it was not taken off our bill.  

There are much better sushi experiences available in the neighborhood and I do not see us returning for this sub-marginal cuisine."}
{"text":"Just so you know this place is closed permanently as of 5/26...note on the door suggests it was ugly"}
{"text":"Favorite place for Sushi Happy Hour!  The Crispy Spicy tuna is my go to!  Shrimp Tempura is 5 star!   Spider roll and Shrimp Shumai are always cooked right.  Happy hour is the deal you can fill up without break the bank.  The waitress' are really friendly and give nice service."}
{"text":"This place served up one of the worst customer experiences I've ever seen a restaurant provide.  We went in and although the place had plenty of seating it took them almost 20 minutes to seat 8 people.  We told our waitress (who was really trying her hardest to keep up while her managers stood up at the bar and laughed) that we were in a hurry and put in our drink order.  After close to 15 minutes we finally got our drinks and ordered up 5 rolls.  Nothing special.  We finally got the first one almost 40 minutes after that.  Three of our party had to leave without eating.  

The food was very average.  After that we asked for our check and again a long delay before we got our bill.

We asked to speak to the manager about this and he finally came over another 15 minutes later.  When we spoke to him about our experience he became extremely agitated and offered to pay for one of our rolls.  I told him thanks but no thanks and I would just pay the bill.  Then I informed him that this situation was obviously not our waitresses fault because the management was as bad as you'll find in this part of Scottsdale.  

As we were leaving he told us that he never wanted us to come back again.  

Absolutely AWFUL experience."}
{"text":"Slow as hell service, everything is expensive without the quality to back it, cramped tables tightly packed together, dirty glasses, dirty tables, and a manager that was constantly walking around just looking at your table. No refills, check took forever, $80 check for 2 for what? Didn't even have Sapporo in, just Asahi and Kirin. If you've lived in Japan like I did fire 2 years, you learn those two beers are the bud light of beers. Gross and cheap. 

We're not rich or snobby, but we take one day a week for \"date night\" to go to a new restaurant and not worry about the check. This place, however, was a watts of money. 

Had better sushi at a less fancy place for half the cost! 

Also, just a note...hate their damn door. Took us a second to figure out how to open it, and when we eat across the street at Grimaldis we watch everyone look confused on how to get in. Funny when it's not you.."}
{"text":"O-my-gosh!  The Shrimp Shumai is so freakin' good!  Came for happy hour with a big group of people and we seriously ordered 10 of these, they were that good!  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Venue is nice, food is decent, BUT the service was lacking. Main meal came out before the appetizer (edamame) and the sushi. Very disorganized. Had one of our plates comp'd and the table behind us had two of their plates comp'd. This place could really be good but they need to get there stuff together. I wouldn't recommend. Find a better place."}
{"text":"Service was okay, and the food was good. Where my problem started was the bill. There were two others at my table and the waiter brings us one check. I ask him if we could get separate checks and he tells us that he their machine won't let him do separate checks. Okay so we figure out the math ourselves and tell him to charge this much on this card and this much on that card etc. I also gave him a visa gift card that was activated and everything. He comes back multiple times it got declined and there's no way to accept gift cards! The waiter also charged my debit card to the ring bill! I mean c'mon! So ridiculous! Not going back!"}
{"text":"We went there and when we ordered our drink I got a plastic cup for no reason and when we ordered we had to wait forever and when we got them they where the wrong order so we had to wait longer and the ginger had a hair in it to we had to wait even longer so it was pretty crappy. Not recommended!"}
{"text":"Expensive and nothing that wows you.  Service was great though.  If I ever find myself in the area again, I'll drop by for a drink.  They have cool drinks on their menu.  Otherwise, pass on the sushi."}
{"text":"Very good Suishi. Came here at approximately 1pm for lunch. Service was good and food was on par with prices.

I would recommend 4/5."}
{"text":"This place was amazing!  Right in the heart of Scottsdale Quarters. The people watching was really good.  The food was incredible!!  The spicy tuna crunch role was intense.  The service was fantastic. Oh and let's not forget the chocolate cake.  So good!!!"}
{"text":"I love this spot, and is by far my preferred sushi spot in scottsdale.   A chill atmosphere with great music, and great food.   They make excellent drinks, especially Taylor the bartender.  Rock shrimp is delicious.  I've been to many sushi places in scottsdale, and when you want enjoy your food with friends, this is the place to go.   Their service is also spot on.  I cannot recall a time where I was waiting for service."}
{"text":"This is the best veggie sushi in Phoenix!  They'll make anything, so use your imagination.  The personal favorite being avocado roll inside-out with jalapeno and cream cheese."}
{"text":"Sushi is great - service is good and each time I have dined there with my toddler, they have been great.  They have a pretty good kid's dish that my kid enjoys as well.  The wine list leaves much to be desired (wine lovers have to \"settle\" but it isn't horrible) but the sushi is WAY better than Ra for sure!"}
{"text":"I've been here numerous times thinking the next time it will be better.... It's not! Sushi is plain at best. You can sit down when it's not busy and wait so long for your drink order, you can have your drink, appetizer & sushi selected before the waiter is even there to greet. My wife was seated under a heater that midway thru dinner started dripping on her. Your saki bomb glass is a thin glass you would expect for a vodka soda & did I mention the sushi is nothing to brag about. Biltmore is in dire need of a new sushi restaurant. Stingray is a disgrace."}
{"text":"In comparison to Sushi I can get here in the Bay Area, this was ok. The sashimi was fresh but the cuts were small for the price. The miso, served with a soup spoon?!?, is way to salty and powdery... they need to lighten up on the mix. We had maguro sashimi(small, $$$), unagi, hamachi, spicy scallop (very good, special order), tempura(batter was too thick and a little soggy), nigori sake (nice touch served in a bamboo thing.
The place is loud; the staff are gorgeous; the atmosphere is fun. I would go back for drinks and an app but for real sushi i would wait until i got home."}
{"text":"How can one not like sushi... I mean seriously!?! Yum!!! 

I'm excited there is a new sushi spot next to my place, you can never have too many :-) 

A group of us went to in the other night for a going away party/dinner. We tried to make reservations, which we found out they don't take, but they were able to put us on a list, as being a party of 8 they were helpful and got us a great table on the patio fast. 

Everything we had was great! Starting with their specialty drinks, I had some strawberry champagne concoction that was super yummy! Then a few rounds of Saki, duh! 

We had lots and lots of edemame and gyoza to start. Edemame is a must when eating sushi. Then we all kinda split a bunch of rolls, well except for Alex, Whitney E. bf, we haven't broken him into the sushi thing yet. He had a steak and said it was very good. 

I can't for the life of me remember the names of the special rolls we had, and they don't have them listed on their web site. One of them had light cilantro lime sauce and pico on top, refreshing and tasted like we were on the beach. Their fish quality is very good as well. The tuna on the nagiri was perfect. 

They have a fairly large bar out front as well, perfect for some summer time happy hour. (Saki carafes and specialty drinks are half off and some great food on special as well)

Long story short..... I'm a fan for sure, you should be too!"}
{"text":"If only I where rating this place based on their sushi I would give it 5 stars.  But, I'm not  rating it based on the food.  It is purely based on the customer service in this establishment.  Be warned; if you have a large party this is NOT the place to go.  I've been in the restaurant industry for over 20 years and I have NEVER heard of a restaurant not splitting checks for large parties.  So for an over 500.00 bill they will take 15+ different forms of payment but won't split up the check by individuals or couples.  How does this make any sense.  To make matters worse; they bring out the sushi and I quote \"family style\".  Since when did sushi get served family style?  Here is the problem.  Sushi is expensive, not everyone at the table ate it and when served \"family style\" someone else may get what you ordered and you won't have a clue it even made it to the table.  We spent over 40 minutes trying to figure out this bill, SERIOUSLY!  When I asked the manager her generic and obviously well rehearsed response was \"this is our company policy, we do not split checks for large parties\".  This is absurd.  So not only did we have a heck of a time figuring out the bill, I'm pretty sure no one really knew who had what and if they had added random things to the bill.  How could you know with that many people ordering????  I never received part of what I ordered yet it made it on that bill.  So here we have to pay it regardless of what we may or may not have received?  I understand that adding gratuity to a party this size is also common practice which I don't normally have a problem with but how about some EXCELLENT customer service in return.  If policy is no separate checks, at least tell everyone as they order or as a group that this will occur.  They said someone was told when the reservation was made.  The reservation was made for 25 people!  It would've taken 2 seconds to again relay this important piece of information.  Worst experience ever!"}
{"text":"Not impressed with there food and drinks.  Las Vegas rolls  we're  greasy and soggy, yuck, ,drinks were not shaken write 
Just poor experience all around. Victoria  the manager is a pretentious type to say the least.All in all should give 1 star but feeling generous today"}
{"text":"We'd noticed all the slams on this place and had crossed it off our list, but some friends called us at 11:30 the other night and asked us to meet them there, so we did.

We were pleasantly surprised.  Even though we got there at 11:50, they still served us and the service was - contrary to many of the reviews here - extremely friendly and gracious.  Our food arrived rapidly and the waiter came back one more time after midnight to see if we wanted anything else before they shut down the kitchen.

We didn't eat much because of the hour but what we had was just fine.  We'll try it again some time when we're in the mood for a full meal."}
{"text":"I wish there was a way to give zero stars.  Went here with a group of friends and the staff refused to give us an additional chair despite the fact that there were several open chairs throughout the restaurant.  When I finally went to grab an open chair the host literally pulled the chair out from under me.  I have never been treated so bad in my life. 

Rude staff. Will never go here ever again."}
{"text":"A bit pricey for what you get. I think the draw here is the atmosphere and the interior deco. The food is decent though, and I've always had decent service here... busy or not. I'd say the food is on par with Ra, but is a tad more expensive. 

To be honest, I'd rather eat at Ra - but sometimes it's overrun with teenage high school girls wearing too much makeup pretending to be socialites or else you can't get service at all. If I'm going to a special Sushi place, I'll go somewhere else... but in a pinch, I'll hit this place up.

Nice staff, cool atmosphere, decent food."}
{"text":"Service was insanely slow without anyone in the restaurant.  The sushi wasn't fresh and overall experience with the food and staff was stale.  It was was clean and professional, but that's the extent of it"}
{"text":"We came here after the ASU football game. Tired and hungry, we were looking for a place to eat but all the restaurants in the Scottsdale Quarter had a waiting line except Stingray. I dropped my family off and parked. Walking around Stingray, I couldn't find the entrance. My son had to do a search and rescue and open the front door for me. The front door looks like a wooden wall. Very deceptive. 

The inside was very modern looking and spacious. I had a really hard time with the menu cause I couldn't really decide. We always get sushi but nothing else seemed intriguing. So we started off with the rainbow roll and the dragon roll. I would have to say outstanding sushi. Very fresh just like it should be. Really good. 

For dinner, I just ordered the Vegetable Udon   It had yellow opinions, green onions, carrots, and mushrooms with of course udon noodles in a really dark soup. It was okay but salty. Nothing special about it. 

My wife, daughter, and mom all ordered the seafood udon. It was basically the same as my vegetable udon except it had seafood and tempura shrimp. Seafood was okay. Not great. So my wife wasn't too impressed. My son had the teriyaki chicken on a bed of vegetables. He liked the chicken and was satisfied. So overall, the food was okay. The sushi was very good. 

Another issue was their service. Our waitress came right away and brought us our drinks. We told her we weren't ready to order. The problem was trying to get her back. It took forever to track her down again. Poor service. Then after we ordered, the food took forever to get to our table. They had three sushi chefs and would assume our sushi would come out fast but it didn't.  Poor service. 

So I would have to say that their dinner menu (besides the sushi) is lacking. They should open up the menu and allow the bento boxes to be ordered during dinner. 

So great sushi, okay dinner, weak dinner menu, and down right poor service. No wonder this place is the only place not as busy in the Scottsdale Quarter in a Saturday night. Will we be back? I can say hands down probably not."}
{"text":"Three stars for the food, minus one star for the less than stellar service by Lindsay.  She was too busy yakking with the couple sitting at the bar, while we sat there waiting (and waiting) for her to bring us our beers.  We started with edamame and gyoza, which were both good.  The gyoza weren't too doughy, and had a nice taste.  For the main, I had the sashimi plate, which was very nicely presented.  My girl had a couple of different rolls, which were also nicely presented and tasted fine.  We were just put off by our server, who seemed to not really care about whether we were there or not."}
{"text":"The epitome of chain mall sushi really. While over-breaded tempura, dried out flavorless sushi, and other questionable examples of Japanese/Korean cuisine may appeal to some it didn't do it for me. The service and location is nice but can't really mask the quality of the food. The J-Pop cocktail I had was erring on the watery side as well.

Half price happy hour softened the blow but at the end of the day your getting ok, pricey nosh in a nice setting."}
{"text":"After reading several reviews I cautiously visited for an important evening. I called ahead and spoke to the manager to ensure we had a great visit. We had fantastic service, and the food was incredible. I absolutely love the decor and environment. The only potential knock would be I don't know if my good service was due to my calling ahead (it seemed not however). I saw the same attention to detail and good service for all guests that night. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"if you read some of my reviews, i kill places when they deserve it.
and i give praise when the experience exceeds the expectation:

judging from the outside, i always thought this place would be all razzle, all dazzle, art deco, beautiful people and very average food.. I was wrong.

Being a bit of a restaurant, food & wine industry snob, I usually go into a place like this with low expectations, try to be friendly, gracious & hope for the best.

They exceeded my expectation, well done.

On a recent Sat night around 8:pm, we had 4 people with no reservation, there was a 30 min wait, but the friendly hostess offered us 4 seats at the sushi bar, we accepted.

we ordered a few various rolls and many assorted pieces of sushi, and one of our friends got some sort of stir fry (which was great).

Now I know sushi, having lived in Miami, LA & SF. It shouldn't be that difficult for a restaurant to buy quality food, prepare it, and serve it simply with a smile.
That's all I ask.

The sushi here is very good. The rice was just right and still a little warm (I love that). The wasabi & ginger were fresh (you'd be amazed how many places get that wrong).

The servers & sushi chefs were all friendly. That's all i ask, Friendly Service & Good Food. I'll be back soon, with the hot summer weather, I'm already thinking about Stingray Sushi again this week. Bravo!"}
{"text":"The sushi was horrible! Salmon Skin Roll was burnt! Spicy Salmon tasted like normal salmon not spicy, Rainbow Roll really had no taste and the squid salad was very bit! Sushi Chef has horrible attitude towards other staff Members! Waitress was cute and energetic! The only good aspect!"}
{"text":"Clearly Arizona does not know what good sushi is all about. I guess that shouldn't surprise me, considering it's nowhere near an ocean, but still I expected much better, especially for the prices.

The Upside: super hot waitstaff, surprisingly good calamari, cool modern feel.

The downside: overpriced, slow service, crowded and uncomfortable patio area, barely edible sushi rolls (seriously, I've had better from the grocery store deli).

Come here for some sake and appetizers, but eat dinner someplace else.  And don't go to the place across the street! It's the same owners."}
{"text":"First visit to Stingray and was impressed.  Service was good, we felt taken care of. We went for lunch so I could see how this place could get super busy in the evening. Especially when they have benches outside for waiting. The sushi was great, everything was fresh and tasted delicious. Started with Miso soup, and an octopus salad, which was interesting but had great flavor. The crunchy roll was delicious and the spicy crab rolls fantastic. We will definitely visit here again."}
{"text":"Anyone out there have unused gift cards? I contacted the owner via email earlier today as he is also the owner of Geisha A Go Go and Morning Squeeze in Old Town Scottsdale to see how my $200 gift card can be honored.  I received it on 5/17 and went to use it on 5/29 to find closed doors.  All other Valley locations are closed.  I hope the owner comes through for me by honoring it at his other restaurants as this was a gift pooled together by parents of Cub Scouts that my husband and I led this school year.  It would be a shame and unethical for this owner to leave those of us with gift cards hanging."}
{"text":"Love that they serve 300 or 500 mL carafes here! I loved sitting at the bar.

Came here for happy hour and got a carafe of Hakatsuru Superior \"Junmai Ginjo\", which is a cold sake, it was amazing! Sweet, wet with fruity notes to it.

Coming from another bar previously, I shared the shu mai with a friend which was good. Steamed well and tasted yummy with the dipping sauce- even as it was the non traditional soy sauce.

Great atmosphere, the bar area has indoor and outdoor seating, decor was dark, modern and had a club-like feel. The service was good we were waited on quickly and the servers at the bar were friendly.

Prices can be a bit steep from what I've seen on the menu, but would definitely love to come back for happy hour."}
{"text":"Its sad to see that this place is only 3 stars now. I LOVE stingray its one of the better sushi places in Scottsdale. Why do I love it, cuz it has the Morning Dew roll. No other sushi place has this type of roll. The sauce is killer too! Im a big sauce fan I've told ya'll this in many of my reviews. Way to go Sting Ray.I could see how the service may be a little bad, but food it good."}
{"text":"What's not to like?  Stingray does stylish sushi and happy hours just fine.  This is the only \"chainy\" sushi place that I will eat at.  I can't stand sushi at Kona or, god forbid Ra.  I have always found the sushi to be fresh tasting, especially the salmon skin roll, which for some reason, is absent in a lot of establishments.  One of my other favorites is the summertime roll, it's tuna and avocado delicately wrapped in soy paper which I love.  They also do a very adequate and lively happy hour where house drinks are half priced, and there is a nice variety of sushi rolls and apps that are between $3-$8, oh and sake bombers too! We went specifically for the fact that their happy hour lasts until 7pm, and they have a great patio.  We have always received attentive service, and when sitting at the sushi bar, you receive complimentary edamame and miso soup (although their version is kind of salty and not my favorite).  Friday the BF and I had 4 drinks, fried calamari, gyoza, 2 sushi rolls and salmon nigiri for $40.  Not bad, not bad at all.  The Biltmore location is where you will find me."}
{"text":"I called about 10 different sushi restaurants asking about wild caught fish selection, stingray was the only place with options. Walon took great care of us at the bar!"}
{"text":"Stingray is a beautiful restaurant with a beautiful staff, but for some reason, the food just doesn't drive me crazy.

I have been here several times, most recently for happy hour, and each time I have had a very attentive server or bartender. As far as the staff goes, they definitely get 5 stars. 

There isn't a bad seat in the house, and the outside bar is AMAZING. Such a great place to sit in Arizona's beautiful spring weather. The happy hour is pretty awesome, I will definitely be back for happy hour with my girlfriends soon.

However, I am not blown away by the food. Maybe it is because I am just starting to really dive into seafood, but the sea bass that I had there was pretty yuck. The sushi is okay- I have to get it with soy paper, because seaweed freaks me out, so I know it is difficult for sushi to stay together when soy paper is substituted. But I don't know, something about the food is just missing for me."}
{"text":"Sat. Night, we called ahead to see if reservations were required.  The girl on the phone said no, that the wait was only 5  minutes.  We were 5 minutes away, and on our way.  5 minutes later, we arrived. (4 adults, & 1 child). We are now told by that same girl there's a 45-50 minute wait.  We looked around and it didn't seem busy at all.  What changed in the last 5 minutes??No tourists bus just pulled up.  There were only 2 couples at the sushi counter, and just several tables.  The bar was busy, but that's not where we wanted to sit anyway.  And only 1 couple standing in the lobby, who said they didn't understand the wait times either.  They had been standing there for 30 minutes, watching group after group turn around and walk out after being told there wait was going to be long too.  That other couple that was waiting, walked out too.  We ended up having a great meal at another nearby restaurant with no wait at all, Stingray lost out on a lot of business. Horrible guest communications."}
{"text":"Really disappointed with the service. I was out celebrating my birthday with my friends and the service was awful and very slow."}
{"text":"Overall service experience was terrible. The hostesses seemed to have a hard time getting people seated in a timely manner during a steady, but not \"busy\" time. There were also signs of poor communications between them and a couple of visibly grumpy wait staff. After my date and I were literally forgotten by this group, we settled for bar seating, which seemed wide-open. Unfortunately the attention paid by the pair of bar tenders, was also disappointing. They seemed to be more preoccupied doing side work and chatting amongst themselves then seeing to our needs. 
     Eventually, we did receive service, ordered a couple cocktails and 3 different sushi rolls. The drinks were decent, save the wilting garnishments and muddled pulp clumps that made drinking through the straw impossible. The sushi itself was delivered promptly and did not disappoint, as everything else to this point seemed to. Nothing extraordinary, but well assembled and tasty. For this reason I couldn't justify only one star. Regardless of that however, this place will certainly not be around long unless certain areas are improved on."}
{"text":"The first time I went to Stingray, I really liked it. I thought the sushi was great and the atmosphere was a lot of fun. It's right in the middle of Old Town, which makes it a really great place to have happy hour or go for a meal before hitting the clubs. 
The second time I went, I wasn't as impressed.  I started to notice just how packed Stingray always was and while that can be fun sometimes, it can also get a little annoying. There's always a wait Thursday-Saturday nights and the music is sooo loud that conversations are almost impossible. The sushi didn't stand out on this visit either, making me wonder if the high prices were worth it.
I've been back a few times, but only on off hours...I would go again, but probably only for a few drinks before heading out to one of the bars in Old Town. 
P.S. I ordered one of their signature drinks and of course, it was also the only one that comes in a freaking pink Chihuahua shaped glass. It was embarrassing. 
People stared.
Don't order it."}
{"text":"When we arrived here, we were told that the wait was 45 minutes. That was fine by us, but as we waited around the bar area, we kept seeing empty tables that were prepped for new customers but no new customers. In fact, we'd see the table sit empty for at least 5 minutes. The food came out slow, which I don't blame our waitress for since I'm sure the sushi chefs were dragging on this.

When I asked for the check at the end, I flagged down the hostess and her response was \"I'm not your server\". Ok, I get that, I know that, but it's then your job to find our server and tell her. Ridiculous.

As we were walking out, the hostess was staring glassy eyed at the tv and didn't even acknowledge we were around.

They gain stars back since the sushi rolls themselves were pretty good. If I could get their sushi without dealing with the service, I'd love this place."}
{"text":"I like the girls....um I mean the food, haha, the place is a very zen sushi bar, the girls are as attentive as they are good looking, and the sushi is very good..."}
{"text":"Happy Hour here is killer! Delicious sushi and cheap drinks. Try a rice paper role so light and tasty. The sinful orchid is amazing! Great patio. Great location at the Biltmore! **Don't forget to get your parking validated."}
{"text":"This is my fave place for Sushi!  The vegetable tempura is to die for!  The batter is perfect and the vegetables they use are spot on perfection.  The dipping sauce for the tempura is SOOOO yummy, that I dip my sushi in it too.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.  The atmoshphere is nice - I've eaten both inside and outside on the patio during good weather days.  The service is great and has been every time I've gone.  I took off one star because every single time I've gone there, the tables are sticky.  It's not because someone didn't wash them down... I think it has to do with the weird coating on the tables themselves.  It's like a clear coat of something that doesn't wash well.  This place totally needs to redo the surfaces of the tables or something because it's kind of gross to sit down at a table that's sticky. :/"}
{"text":"The godzilla roll is massive, the stingray roll was also good"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was great, very pleasant and courteous service. I enjoyed the sushi, especially their signature rolls. Those were from outerspace."}

{"text":"What is worse Silicon filled waitresses, or cream cheese filled sushi rolls? I let you make the call.  I feel like the Commish from those Miller Lite Comercials, the More Taste League. The commish is wise!\" This place is over priced, but better than RA. Your sushi mantra should be the following:

ABRA = anything but Ra. 

They have good miso soup, which leaves meso hungry...for lack luster rolls, and small cuts of fish, oh and if you're up to it, get the attitude roll from the patrons....you know the dudes with the wide open club shirts,  bootfit jeans and black dress shoes.  

This place blows like a Whale in Puget Sound...save yourself....."}
{"text":"This USED TO BE one of my favorite sushi bars, but we will probably never eat here again.
We recently met our Los Angeles guests at Stingray. I made a reservation for 5 since our time allowed for dinner was short and we didnt want to have to wait for a table.
Every waitress in the restaurant, looked like they were cloned from the same model. They were all beautiful brunettes. (Not complaining about their beauty AT ALL!). However, their service skills were poor.
After being seated, we started off by ordering 2 bowls of Edemame, while we looked at the sushi menu. 
When the waitress came back empty handed, we ordered our sushi rolls.
About 20-30 minutes later, we received ONE bowl of Edamame and reminded our server of the 2nd bowl ordered. Another 20-30 minutes later, we received the sushi all on one plate. I realize that many sushi bars do this (My pet peeve), however, when you are sitting at a long table, it makes it near impossible to reach across with chopsticks to eat and have to pass or share the plate. Since we did not receive any soy sauce, ginger or wasabi with our sushi,  we had to ask for it....and wait for it!!
10 minutes later, we had to ask for the condiments again.
Another 10 minutes later and still no condiments, someone at our table went in and got it themselves.
After several more minutes, one of the cloned brunettes came over and slapped some soy sauce in front of one of our guests who was NOT eating  sushi at all. He asked,
  \"Whats this?\", but she just turned and left the table.
  Again we had to ask about our 2nd bowl of Edamame and were continually promised they would bring it to our table.
  Toward the end of the meal, the server brought us our bill along with the 2nd order of edamame, as if it were our dessert!! 
  To top it off, the server included a 20% gratuity. I have no problem tipping for good service or a good meal and understand when gratuity is included with large parties, but a table of 5? We were told it was because we made a reservation! wow.
  One of the guests suggesting putting a -$20.00 (negative) in the blank tip area on the credit card slip, but we didnt do that.
  Instead we tipped appropriately and left.
  The sad part is, that Stingray Sushi just showed some of the biggest entertainment moguls from Los Angeles the worst service of their life and now I have to find another sushi bar to entertain my guests in!"}
{"text":"Disappointing all around. More expensive sushi than Kabuki or other mainstream places AND you don't get that true Biltmore dining experience.  Customer service was sub-par and they were out of lobster and scallops.  How are they going to be out of their big ticket items???   It wasn't even a busy day to be out of items or expect rushed service."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner at Stingray last weekend, 3 great rolls!  This was our first visit, as we have been wanting to try it for awhile now.  Had a Japanga roll, a summertime roll in soy paper and can not remember the name of the other.  Fun, contemporary environment that you can actually have a conversation with your lovely date and hear them.

Will definitely visit again, and try the Oldtown Scottsdale location!"}
{"text":"Not a good experience once again. This place should just be a bar. Stingray focuses more on the bar area and \"The bar scene\" groups. Sushi was gross, we had  3 Rolls....and two out of the three were fishy and tasted like bad tuna and salmon. I actually had to get up and go to the bathroom because I thought I was going to throw up on the table. We just let that roll sit there I didn't say anything. Next roll was the Godzilla and that was okay. Next roll was fishy and gross again......we had enough and sent it back got the check and left. Funny thing is when I looked at the sushi menu it was so boring and basic, then it brought back our last visit when they just opened at the Quarter. Should have stuck with my gut feelings and left when I remembered our last visit was a bad experience there. It was to late and we already ordered, Instead I left with a bad gut and a bad taste in my mouth. I couldn't eat enough of the melon gummies they give you to take the rotten fish taste out of my mouth. Of course my stomach was upset all night. If you want some good sushi seriously go up the road to Pure or Sushi Brokers...they got fresh fish all day everyday! I'll kick myself all week for going to Stingray dumb dumb move."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Overpriced, loud environment.

I went here for a birthday party for around 15 people. It was so loud that I could only talk to the people next to me. It took forever to get the food. I went here about 4 months ago. From what I remember, the sushi was not bad, but not memorable either."}
{"text":"Been here 2x.  Both at different times and days of the week.  Horrible service  I would not recommend this place for Sushi 

There are better options in Phoenix"}
{"text":"Amazingly fresh sashimi. Service good. Fun Scottsdale atmosphere. Loud music (in a
good Saturday night kind of way). Great location in Scottsdale Quarter."}
{"text":"a friend and i met here for happy hour after work.  we are always trying to find some decent, cheap sushi... their happy hour sushi menu had a decent selection... we were able to order a bunch of different things that satisfied our sushi cravings... however, i would not recommend the vegas roll.. it had quite a lot of breading on it!  

all in all, if you arent too picky about your sushi, and you dont want to break the bank, happy hour is ok here!"}
{"text":"Picked up lunch to go here w/ a coworker & we each had the bento box special.  I wonder why they call it a \"special?\"  I promise you nothing special about it.  Consisted of a krab roll (yup, I'm talking krab w/ a k), 4 pcs nigiri, mixed green salad, miso soup.  All in all, it sucked.  The fish just tasted blah & the miso too concentrated.

I'll give it 2 stars for atmosphere-with-potential for nighttime, and for not making me violently ill.  Come for a cocktail, go elsewhere for food."}
{"text":"Went here last Saturday and had a good time. We had to wait about 40 minutes for a party of four which was fine but we realized the bar is very small and cramped. There is almost no where to stand without completely being in the way or practically on top of people trying to eat. The food was decent, nothing overly exciting. Our waitress was really really sweet and very attentive. It seems like the patio would be fun on a warmer night!"}
{"text":"good happy hour it use to be 2 bucks for most everything on the menu but now its 3 bucks its still a good get happy for an hour menu. food is always good I like the cali rolls & tempura chicken! try it"}
{"text":"Love to go there for the happy hour specials, great selections on drinks and appetizers for half off. The atmosphere is really nice and upbeat. Music isn't too loud. The decor is really nice and well done. My favorite drink is their kiwi Collins!"}
{"text":"Oh wow. We've been here on numerous occasions and haven't had any issues before. Based on today's experience we won't be back. 

We were taken to a table outside that clearly wasn't wiped down- soy sauce drippings and food particles hardened on the surface. The menu had saucey fingerprint smudges all over it (really? Throw it out!) and there was a large pile of cocktail napkins scattered on the floor in front of the bar with food scattered on top. To top it off, my fiancée was given a dirty beer glass TWICE with visible food particles caked on it! 

Needless to say we left and did not feel comfortable eating here as I can only imagine what the kitchen looks like or how the food is treated back of the house. 

No thank you!"}
{"text":"A horrific hangover and possibly still drunk on a monday afternoon, one might be turned off at the thought of a burger or a burrito. I know I was. Just thinking about the available fast food options close to home made me want to barf. Sushi sounded enticing.

Stingray offers several lunch bento boxes, each with cucumber salad, miso soup, a main, and a side that changes with each item. I ordered the sushi bento and it was phenomonal. Four very large slices of sashimi, three pieces of nigiri, and cucumber salad was more than enough for me. The quality was excellent and the prices were fair to somewhat high. I think my luch with tax, tip, and iced tea was under $15... not too bad for a sushi lunch at a high rent place like this. 

The service was spectacular. I ate at the bar outside and I think the bartender must have been the most outgoing, friendliest girl I've ever had the pleasure of being waited on by. She was spectacular. I really felt like I was someones houseguest by my treatment. It was a very different feel from the old town location, where most staff feels very cold."}
{"text":"I was in Scottsdale for 2 weeks a couple months ago for training and came here for happy hour about 5 times over those 2 weeks. The sushi here is super fresh and there is plenty to choose from on the happy hour menu. The girls that work here are beautiful and the service was great. I love the atmosphere here as well, you walk in looking down at an aquarium!!! I wish there was a place like this close to home."}
{"text":"In summary, the Biltmore Stingray is a posh bar that serves OK Japanese food.  If you're going to get anything here, I'd stick with the rolls as that's what they do best.  The sashimi/chirashi is not the freshest and was even a tad slimy.  That having been said, I'm a huge critic of sashimi and use its quality in judging Japanese restaurants, so I may be bringing down the hammer a lot more heavily than others would.  But, I give credit where credit's due: they make great drinks, the service is always prompt and pleasant, and the atmosphere of the restaurant is extremely comfortable."}
{"text":"The friendliest of staff around. The Spicy crunchy tuna and Las Vegas roll Were exceptional. The green tea was very refreshing-Is very light for a green tea and Was great. The atmosphere and quality of food was second to none. 
Back to the staff... Cute little waitress who played right into my sense of humor. She didn't go overboard to try and earn any extra tips. She was a genuinely nice person who entertained our group, it was nice to see.  Stingray went above my expectations for a sushi joint. All those negative reviews are likely from misfits without taste buds."}
{"text":"Nice place... horrible sushi.

You can sit outside and have a great time in the balmy weather, people watching and relaxing to what would be considered C-minus grade sushi.  I live in San Francisco, so I am a bit spoiled.  Maybe all sushi places in Phoenix are bad. What also got on my nerves was that, unilke most places that give vegan sushi eaters an option (yes, there are many of us out there), this place has almost no selection.  And when I asked if they could make something for me (the vegan), the hostess simply scanned up and down the menu for something accomodating instead of asking the sushi chef."}
{"text":"So... hostess was nice waitress was nice and even the cook was nice. But when it comes to food and service all I can think of is below average, the glasses and plates where dirty and the service was too long since that had only one girl working there and some of the food actually tasted different( in a bad way ) then any other sushi place."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere, especially now that it's cool enough for them to leave the tall windows open. The whole restaurant area feels open to the world. Very pleasant colors as well.

We came for happy hour and the menu didn't disappoint. Good selection of rolls and sushi and various non-sushi dishes for $3-$5. All we tried were good and tasted fresh. When ordering sushi on some special at other places, I sometimes wonder if they don't have a few baker's trays full of the stuff somewhere, leftover from a morning prep session. That wasn't the case here.

Drinks on special included Dos Equis for $4 and the house red or white for $3, as well as various cocktails. I wouldn't recommend the wine, actually: Bears distinct hints of \"3 Buck Chuck\". My companion had the Summer Sumo which was reported to be pretty satisfying. 

No complaints on the service. We were very well-attended over the course of over a 90 minute stay.

This is a good place to start the evening if you're doing a datenight at the Biltmore or Esplanade."}
{"text":"Best Sushi I have ever had. That says a lot, as I am particularly timid about Sushi in general.

I love how small and unique this place is. Good luck getting in on the weekends :) -- fair prices and good drinks make this a winner!"}
{"text":"We have been to this location multiple times and normally have had great service. Tonight we got here and were told there would be a 45 min wait when over half of the restaurant was empty. Once we got a table we ended up waiting 15 mins with no waiter. I had to go up to the hostess stand to ask for a waiter. Once one came she was extremely rude the entire night. If this was my only experience here I would never return."}
{"text":"Had not had sushi in a very long time, so this was a treat. Sat at the sushi bar, Kirin and great sushi. The variety was great, service was awesome. Very well prepared, and all was fresh..like it needs to be. Love the big door to get in, don't really notice it until you look up close."}
{"text":"Wow.. why all the mixed reviews, my fellow Yelpers?

I ate here last year and had a good meal.  It was indeed a little pretentious, but what is the harm in a little pomp and circumstance on a Friday night?

I really enjoyed the cocktails.  And the sushi was good.  I really liked the atmosphere, it was a very cool spot.  The service, I remember to be just so so.  

All in all, I've eaten at many places in Phoenix and this was one of my better experiences."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Don't try parking on the street. Nearly impossible.  Park in the garage. The food was amazingly great. The service was stellar and the atmosphere so comfortable. I will be returning."}
{"text":"I had a lot of fun at this place.  You know you aren't getting \"authentic\" sushi so you put those expectations aside.  This is a great place for groups like bday parties.  The restaurant isn't that big and they don't take reservations so you end up waiting a while, especially on weekends.  We went on a Sunday night around 7:45pm and had to wait almost an hour.  I recommend getting the sushi boats which is basically an assortment of sushi.  It's a pretty good value for the price.  The miso marinated cod is fantastic, but the shrimp, scallops and garlic spinach dish is just ok.  The scallops dynamite is really rich.  The restaurant is noisy inside so it's not a place for a quiet or romantic date."}
{"text":"Food was really good! Got a specialty roll, seaweed salad, and a hand roll. My service was also really good!!!! Definitely stood out to me. On our way out the server even got the door for us. I love the door btw! So unique and cool looking ! Definitely a good place to go to sushi if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"I can't believe how well they turned everything around! The bartenders are amazing and I recommend eating outside or in the bar area. Again I'm just updating my review from last time and this place makes amazing sushi but it's the service that takes the cake!"}
{"text":"Good place for Sushi.  However they don't split checks up so I wouldn't recommend going there with a big party."}
{"text":"Great happy hour. 3-7pm Otherwise pry wouldn't go!"}
{"text":"The good:

Great happy hour.  Sushi rolls for $3 and $5, and until 7 pm.  Most sushi places put the basic rolls on happy hour, but Stingray added a couple extras - the Las Vegas Roll was good, with avocado, smoked salmon, and cream cheese, and wrapped in tempura.  Next time I'll ask for it without the tempura.
--My wife ordered the chicken salad and loved it.  Its got some sort of asian horseradish dressing that was really good.
--Great location (for me), nice decor (not great, but nice).

The Bad:

--Service.  There are two BIG clues a bartender/waiter needs to learn:  1) If wine glasses are empty (or getting close), ask if the customer would like a refill rather than waiting for them to flag you down; and 
2) if my fork is turned over, I am done eating.  Ask if you can clear the plates and bring anything else.  I shouldn't have to sit for 20 minutes next to my empty wine glass trying to get your attention so I can pay my bill.  The manager kept walking right in front of us, also oblivious to the two BIG clues.

Maybe I bring this on myself by sitting at the bar instead of a table, so your experience may be better."}
{"text":"Bento boxes and sushi rolls are a must. Won-ton soup is a bit on the salty side. Be sure to ask for extra fruit snacks for your after-dinner pleasure!"}
{"text":"Visually this place is stunning. Very modern and full of color.... This is about all the positive I have for this place. 

The rice seemed dry and the fish really didn't taste very fresh. Overall tasted very meh. 

If you're like me, a sushi snob, there are much better places through out the valley, better quality and taste. If you don't know anything about sushi then sure check it out..."}
{"text":"One of my girl friends and I went here for a early birthday dinner on a Sunday. 

I definitely would recommend coming on a Sunday because they have all day half off appetizers and drinks! So it worked out great. 

The food was good! We ordered the salmon skin roll, the scallop roll, spicy tuna and I forgot the last one. But it was all tasty! Love hour hour."}
{"text":"The ambiance is as delectable as the sushi...but for someone who doesn't care much about \"seeing or being seen\", I did not enjoy the 45-minute wait for a spot at the sushi bar. I agree with the other reviewer, if all you're after is good sushi, go at odd hours"}
{"text":"Until recently, my husband and I came here on a weekly basis. Stingray offers a great happy hour and very decent sushi and drinks in a stylish restaurant within a mile of our apartment. But, we get mediocre to poor service about 70 percent of the time we go there. After an exceptionally bad and slow experience, my husband and I decided to look elsewhere to give regular business. I get the feeling we won't be missed. So long, Stingray."}
{"text":"Grand entrance doors!  Upon entering we were asked where we would like to be seated and I said let me take a look!  I walked to the right into the main dining area - I literally got a little claustrophobic - it seemed like a little prison - maybe it was the lighting that evening?  So I checked out what was to the left - a very empty looking back bar with a lame little TV and a fish tank that just didn't fit the space - lame.  This is a BILTMORE restaurant?  We settled for outside on the patio - decent.  We happened to hit the end of the happy hour.  She liked what she got, I didn't like what I got (how do you mess up California rolls at a sushi restaurant?).  Was it a dream?  Sorry - love the anime advertisements - not much love for  this location.   Service... it was like a couple high school girls were running the place."}
{"text":"Went here for valentines day and it was such a let down :(. I had high hopes with the interesting decor and expensive menu prices but overall I was disappointed. We came late so they were no longer busy but the service was sooo slow. We had to ask for water 10 minutes after she brought us cocktails. Then we had to ask for soy sauce when she brought the sushi. As a server myself, I could tell she was not overly busy just not really on the ball. The kiwi Collins was great but for 10.50 it had little to no alcohol in it?? Same situation for my boyfriends drink. When the food came out 20 minutes later it was really tasty! Unfortunately not worth the high price for the dishes though. I wanted to get dessert but the service was so slow I didn't have time by the end of dinner because they were closing soon and I didn't want to have to stay past that time to eat some sweets. I don't think I'll be back. Such a waste of 60 dollars and a valentines date."}
{"text":"Love the place, the vibe...and the lovely and heavy wood entry doors...
Why do I love Stingray...??? because it's consistently great and they know how to wow people by doing simple things...For instance, I had lunch there today after not being there for a long time...and the waitress said..: Complimentary miso soup and edaname..Wow! I thought that was such a nice touch and what a way to earn my loyalty and return business...you betcha I'll come back!...Only if all restaurants did that...I really think it's a nice way to make customers feel appreciated...and special.

 I didn't break the bank or anything as all I had was a sashimi bento box...and that too came with salad and sunomono and rice...oh my all that for $ 21.00 or so...unbelievable...the sushi joint near my place coudn't do that for at least $ 45..

The service is downright impeccable...everytime..and I'm not easy to please..well I can be a real bitch at times after working ten years in the hospitality industry..Well Stingray always makes me feel like a VIP no matter if I go there once in a blue moon or just haven't been there for a while..so yes when I think of sushi and Japanese food  in general, Stingray is worth driving the extra distance and time...and they've also got a great happy hour....yes, FIVE stars all the way...!...and that's a rarity for me..."}
{"text":"Unfortunately one of our family favorites proved to be a disaster!!! 
On our last visit, I specifically told our waitress that my daughter (10) was deathly allergic to shellfish, and needed only noodles and broth.  She brought us something covered in seaweed and onions.  I let her know this wasn't what we expected and would like just broth and noodles.  She was happy to change it but needed to talk to manager.  
Unbelievably, the manager Christa would not switch the noodles( $9) which could send my daughter to the hospital!!, but would charge me for them and  and whatever I wanted to replace them with.
The manager, Christa charged me the $9 for the noodles we did not even eat!  We will never return.  Christa, I hope the $9.00 was worth it!!!  
#manageroftheyear"}
{"text":"OK if Scottsdale was a high school cafeteria, Stingray is the jock/cheerleader table. Hunk o burnin' love bartenders. Svelt, big boobied, waitresses. And a super trendy scene. I've never had bad sushi here. And some was fantastic. Everytime I order yellowtail, for some reason, it's always just like a big stick of buttah! And that's a good thing. Tuna has been hit or miss and some of the specials, well, just not that special. I find service to better when they're busier than slow. When it's slow you get the hair twirlers hangin. And twirling their hair. Or the bartender texting someone. His trainer. Or plastic surgeon. I've never had any alcohol here, so I can't review the bar. But the Sprite was sure fizzy and sweet. Probably won't leave my CenPho comfort zone to dine here, but if I found myself in Oldtown, wandering aimlessly and needed to pee somewhere. I'd go here."}
{"text":"Miso happy.
Miso love Biltmore Stingray.
Miso love our lovely server.
Miso LOVE the open decor, the soothing colors and the comfortable furniture. 

Miso happy.

Miso love the Miso, the yellowtail nigiri, the dragon roll, the spicy tuna roll...miso can't even remember all the yummy sushi goodness I engulfed.

Miso ready to go back.

Miso happy!"}
{"text":"My family and I went to Stingray today. We were greeted by a hostess wearing shorts so short that her butt was exposed. She walked us over to a table near the back, which was ok. She gave us our menus and said someone would be right over. The server working that section walked by us several times without acknowledging us. Meanwhile, she seemed very attentive to everyone around us. Hmmm..I started to wonder if we were being ignored. After 25 minutes, we walked out. The hostess didn't question why we were leaving. My advice to management: When hiring, I would focus a little more on a person's intelligence and customer service skills and a little less on looks. Clearly, there's nothing going on upstairs with some of these girls."}
{"text":"If you are in the Arcadia/Camelback area this seems to be the only place now that Zen 32 closed.  I went there last night, my 2nd time since they opened.  I have been to the one in Old Town many times but will not go back since the last time we got food poisoning.  

I do think this location is better, but still Stingray.  The sushi is good, not great, last night we had

Cucumber salad
Dumplings
Tempura Veggies
Salmon
Mackerel
Yellowtail
Stripped Bass
Couple hand rolls
Motorola Roll

Were the juxtaposition happens is the server was so dam nice, but the food was a mess.  First we added avocado to the hand rolls and they came out with no avocado, we were brought a side of it - but still charged.  Just not the same when it is not made with it.

I did order 1 more order of salmon and it took 30 mins to get, we had already paid the bill cut our losses and were getting ready to leave when the order appeared.  Overall the place is not bad by any means.  Just it lacks what many other places have.

Decor is nice - very modern and still has the orange color theme, there is an awesome fish tank in the bar and the bar area is way bigger and much more accommodating.  The outside area is one of the best in the valley, lots of outdoor space to sit and drink.  I think it is a great place to hang out and enjoy happy hour, the food is consistent - Just don't expect the best."}
{"text":"I'm surprised Stingray only has 3 stars. Its some of the best sushi in town for the price. The best part about Stingray is their happy hour -- its UNBEATABLE. Unlike most places who end happy hour at 5 or 6pm, Stingray's Happy Hour is until 7pm and the speciality rolls are only $3-$5 (Dragon, etc.) with half priced drinks. You can eat a $100+  meal for $40. 

Not on the happy hour menu, but a must have is the Morning Dew roll. Its like dessert. 

The vibe is pretty good - can get a little too crowded. If the weather is nice, they have a great patio for people watching on Scottsdale Road.

Oh! And, Stingray is part of the Southwest Airlines Dining Rewards program - huge plus."}
{"text":"I met a friend here for lunch last Sunday.  We ordered several types of rolls, all predominately tuna and salmon, and we enjoyed every single one of them.  I ate way more than I needed to but it was so good, I couldn't stop!"}

{"text":"Went to Stingrays this past Sunday for Happy Hour during the day. I'm used to Stingrays taking longer than most places, but this past Sunday was just too much not write a review. My party of 4 waited a total of 30 minutes for a server to come to the table after being seated. After 15 minutes it became a waiting game of I wonder if they know we are here still. They did apologize and said there was mix-up in servers and eventually brought some waters out. From there it went from bad to worse. 2 Saki bombers were ordered they came out promptly and then were spilled by the waitress on myself, cell phone, wallet, keys. Yes, it makes everything very sticky and smell like alcohol. Thanks. From there were ordered several appetizers and orders of sushi. About 20 minutes later the sushi did come out and we were told the appetizers should be out shortly. 15 minutes later no appetizers, but we were assured there coming out. 30 minutes later and guess what, still no appetizers. At this point the waitress comes back and says that she forgot to put in the appetizers. Would have expected at this point maybe the manager to come and apologize for the service or maybe discount but nothing. To sum this up if you have 2-3 hours to hang and wait around you may eventually get some level of service. The Sunday happy hour was not worth it in my opinion, I might have been a little less forgiving if they were busy or swapped but we were the only table in that section. Save your 2 bucks for another sushi spot."}
{"text":"Great happy hour. The fish tank behind the bar is super cool, and the bartender was so nice. He even gave me extra green tea in a to go cup because I loved it so much."}
{"text":"Gross. There is nothing fresh about this place. I guess if you are looking for a place for drinks its ok, but when it comes to sushi, so not worth it. The service was pretty shoddy also. This has to have the worst sushi I've had in the area."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch. We got a few basic rolls and everything was fresh, affordable and the service was wonderful. Out for about $35 for two of us."}
{"text":"Sushi dinner with my employer means one thing and one thing only... sushi gluttony. 

Consequently, this means that we've sampled every corner of their menu and then some. Here are the dishes that really stood out to me. In fact, they didn't just stand out, but smacked me in the face with all their fishy goodness:

1) Crispy Spicy Tuna: on fried sushi rice, unagi sauce & serrano chile ($10)

2) Fresh Seared Hamachi: seared yellowtail, onion, tomato, petite greens, yuzu & white truffle oil drizzle ($17)

3) Big Eye Tuna: seared big eye tuna with teriyaki vinaigrette over japanese mushroom risotto ($24)

4) Sashimi Plate: chef's choice of 5 different, 3 piece sashimi selections ($21)

Also, make sure you try the Kiwi Collins which is a mixed drink of Pineapple Vodka, fresh kiwi, lemon juice & soda ($10)

The service was efficient and friendly (and yes, the waitresses were exceptionally hot as some other reviewers mentioned) and we all found this sushi joint to be a solid experience.

-----

Distinguishing factor: Fantastic specialties that are sure to please, coupled with a pleasant  Old Town vibe."}
{"text":"Stopped by here on a Friday night to catch the tail end of their HH and had a great time!  Their happy hour lasts until 7 PM which is nice for us folks who don't get off work until 6 PM and included some great rolls and appetizers like a crispy spicy tuna and Las Vegas Roll as well as a Sapporo Tall Boy Saki Bomber for $5.  The regular priced specialty rolls were a nice change from the same old same old rolls you see at other sushi joints, I ordered the original tootsie pop which came on sticks and were rolled in thin sliced cucumber.  I would like to see their specialty roll prices be a little more affordable as most of their specialty rolls range from $13-25 but the quality of the food is definitely A+.

Bobby, the manager stopped by our table to introduce himself and check on our evening.  He was very friendly and joked with us for a while which was a nice touch instead of just a generic table flyby of \"hey I'm the manager how are we doing.\"  He even remembered all of our names when he said goodbye to us when we were walking out the door.

My only gripe was our waitress got a little salty when we asked to have separate checks but after explaining they don't offer that service, she would make an exception this time.  

My plea to all sushi restaurants, please Please PLEASE put Escolar (Shiro Maguro) on your menu.  For some reason Valley sushi restaurants over look this fish which makes my heart sad :("}
{"text":"Good tasty food, nice atmosphere!!!! Plum House wine  is deliciuos!!!! I like this place inside and patio as well!!!!"}
{"text":"They're sushi is good, but it's not the best I've ever had. One of my favorite things to do here is sit yand watch people try to figure out where the door is.

One thing I will say is worth checking out is their lunch specials. You can get shrimp and vegetable tempura with soup, salad and rice for really cheap. The dinner menu is a bit overpriced for the lack of variety I think I've found at other sushi restaurants in Scottsdale. 

The parking here can be a drag, so be prepared to deal without of control people in the parking garage. You would think they were rushing to get a spot like they had to disarm a bomb or something. 

The service here is just unfortunate. When you ask questions about the menu they rarely know what they're serving and multiple times we've been delivered our food before our drink orders. 

Bleh. It's okay."}
{"text":"Gonna have to do 3 stars on this one.  I've had in my opinion 5 star sushi and this is not it, but it is still good.  

I am reading all about this hotty hotterton service staff but I must have gone on the day they all at the gym and tanning b/c I did not see anyone looking so hot.  But I did see the cutest pregnant server who I was very impressed with her running around serving food-- she must be tired after work.  I guess she was kinda hot.

Anyhow, I'm not here to play the hot or not game but to review Stingray. So here it goes.  We got a nice variety of sushi and it was all tasty.  I was at a client lunch so we were able to sit and chat as well which was nice.  It wasn't overly busy and the ambiance is very pleasant.  

The fish in the ground when you walk in was kinda creepy and made me nervous to walk over it--- what if the glass broke and I got eaten alive by piranhas?  Not likely that they have piranhas but possible that I fall through the glass with my luck. 

Service was slow, but looks like that has been covered. Ehh, whatever, I wasn't in a hurry so I honestly didn't really care.  When I am in a hurry and the restaurants are busy, I like to place my order and ask for the bill all in the same sentence.  Works like a charm most of the time.

Will I return to Stingray?  If I am in Scottsdale and want sushi, I might, unless someone tells me a better place to try out in Scottsdale-- I am always open to suggestions."}
{"text":"Given the choice, I would give Stingray 3.5 stars for this dining experience.

Sushi is good... but not great.  I always rate my sushi experiences based on the complexity of the rolls, freshness of ingredients, and taste of some of the more complicated rolls on the menu... and they were just ok here.  Maybe I just dined at the wrong times... but I wasn't overly impressed by the sushi at Stingray. 

On the positive side of things, the appearance is very hip and cool... and the cucumber martini was excellent!  Also, the location is a great spot to hangout and be seen (or to do the seeing).  And the patio is heated on those chillier nights."}
{"text":"I have been going to Stingray Sushi for years, although just recently went to this location for the first time.  That first time was for an event where the staff was incredibly attentive and we had an opportunity to sample a handful of items.  It was a wonderful experience, so I found my way back fairly quickly for another visit!

On this visit, the chefs, bartenders, and staff again did a phenomenal job!  For years, I have tried a variety of foods, desserts, teas and other drinks with lychee in them and yet, I am still unable to describe the taste of lychee.  Kinda sweet, kinda not... and well, I don't know.  I ordered Stingray's lychee margarita, so now you can change all that.  The lychee adds a subtle sweetness and freshness that perfectly highlights the traditional margarita flavors and makes one of my all-time favorite go-to drinks even better!  So so good!

The food...

Their edamame is glazed with sriracha, miso, and butter!  Whoa, now that's how you prepare edamame!

I have found that Gyoza can be so simple, yet difficult to pan sear perfectly.  I can attest that Stingray does it right.  

And the tacos... Wait, what?!  Tacos?  At a sushi restaurant?  Yes sir (and ma'am, if applicable)... and these fusion dishes rock!  I tried the lobster tempura taco.  Just stop.  Go back and read that again... Lobster.  Tempura. Taco.  Just sounds so good... And the taste does not disappoint... the taste was just lights out delicious!

Stingray, I was a fan, but now I'm a superfan!  

FIVE stars!"}
{"text":"I am not a very adventurous Sushi eater, however I know when the basics are good.  I was craving Sushi and it was close and convenient to my house.  I got a  California roll and Crunchy roll as take-out.   

It was average, nothing special.  The rolls are small but easy to eat.  I was expecting the Crunchy roll to be have a little more fried flavor, but it was bland and just lightly dusted in plain ole Panko crumbs.  I would compare it to supermarket sushi honestly. I probably wouldn't dine in here.  Just ok."}
{"text":"Great service, very prompt and to the point. Snagged happy hour with 3 minutes left and our waitress gave us a courtesy just so we could order a few more drinks half priced. Fairly decent sushi, it was good. I've had better, but the crispy fish soy maki roll was fabulous! Definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"I went here for drinks since it was across from my hotel. The bartender was great! He made up a drink based on what I told him I liked which I was very impressed by. I tried one of the specialty drinks off the menu but his was way better! Did not have a chance to try the food but I would definitely go back. The fish tank was relaxing to watch as well."}
{"text":"Great drink specials & variety on Happy Hour menu Mon-Fri, 3-6

Got outta there for just under $45 w/tip for two having had: 

2 mixed specialty drinks (try theToyko Stock Exchange and/or Red Light)
& 4 rolls (one of them wasn't even on happy hour menu) & we were plenty full

Service was slightly slow, but relax! it's happy hour"}
{"text":"I love this location.  The atmosphere is very chill and happy hour is fantastic!  I really love the The Vegas Roll and miso soup are great."}
{"text":"Excellent  waitress in the bar area.  Gina has impeccable knowledge of the menu and recommendations.  Service and food fantastic. Prices for happy hour impressive!"}
{"text":"I typically don't write reviews but this experience was truly awful. First off I made a reservation for 6 people, when we were seated at the table there is only five place settings. We had asked for extra silverware and plates but did not receive them. We also had to ask for water multiple times before we finally received our glasses. Our meals came out one at a time,my meal was the last  to come out. everybody had finished by that time,the sushi was very expensive and not very good our waitress was very slow and we frequently had to ask for refills on our water, extra silverware, even wasabi which was not on the plate for us when our meal came out. My husband ordered the fatty tuna and it was $19 for two pieces of nigiri. The total cost of our meal was $95 with tip and we got one plate of sashimi, 6 pieces of nigiri a specialty roll and 2 drinks. Needless to say we will not be going back to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place.  We had very good service- from the hostess to the waitress.  The food came quickly which was nice because we were headed to a show afterwards.  The sushi was not the best I've had, but it was decent.  Of course it's expensive because it's in Scottsdale though.  The decor in here was nice, I really liked the fish tanks in the floor as you walk in.  It's a smaller place, but cozy.  Overall a decent dining experience if you're in the neighborhood and need some quick sushi."}
{"text":"I went to Stingray for happy hour and, let me say, their happy hour is pretty legit. Stingray has discounted rolls, apps, and drinks on hh, which is great! The cocktails here were very tasty and reasonable during happy hour. The rolls were decently priced, but they weren't fabulously tasty. The best items I had were the crispy spicy tuna and the corn korokke...both were fabulous! I would definitely return for happy hour."}
{"text":"Skip it.  The sushi was average and was served too warm for my liking.  We tried the Vegas roll and the tempura was thick and greasy.  Another post said it best by calling it \"blah\".  Nothing overly exciting about the rolls.  Atmosphere and service was great.  Happy Hour prices were fantastic, but I guess you get what you pay for.  There are several better options around."}
{"text":"When I think of Stingray Sushi I have mixed feelings. The reason that I loved it,  was that I went on a Saturday night with eight friends and we did not have to wait forever to be seated like most places in Old Town that usually take over an hour to get a table. The architecture of the place is also very beautifully designed they definitely try to set themselves apart from other sushi restaurants. The energy and environment is very upbeat and the sushi and sake was delicious, I have to admit that my favorite item was the peach flavored sake that they offered. A reason that I'm not too fond of the restaurant was because it was first off very expensive but that may due to the fact that I did not go during happy hour. Another thing I disliked was the fact that our waitress did not seem be very talkative or friendly, she barely came to our table to check up on us. Although other than that this place has great food as long as you're willing to spend the extra bucks."}
{"text":"Hm I am not sure what's good here but it's definitely busy on a Friday night!

We came too late for Happy hour :(. Happy hour is Mon-Fri 4-7pm and we came a little after 7pm.  Boohoo. Happy hour menu looks decent but it doesn't look as fun as RA Sushi (RA sushi has more raw fish maybe that's why it's called \"Ra\" Sushi but anywho!)

So I ordered the mango tango which has mango chucks and tuna and I like the texture of everything. It's soft and yummy. 

My friend got the zen soba and a kid's bento box. Those were just okay. The zen soba just taste like soba and the broth was a little saltier than my liking. I think bento boxes are just okay, it came with a little plastic whale in one of the compartments. The sushi that was in the bento box was decent. The tempura was decent but it could be crispier. Can someone explain to me why the bento box comes with mustard, ketchup and mayo? I am confused, I was expecting ponzu sauce. I thought tempura usually comes with a soy-based sauce... 

So overall, it was just an okay experience. I would be interested in coming here for happy hour to see how it is. 

Also I think it's weird that there's a stone on the plate. I think it's neat they have the wet warm wash cloth in the center of the table."}
{"text":"SUPER CUTE!!!  Sushi was fresh, service was great and atmosphere was stimulating!  Perfect place to people watch and enjoy some good sushi!  Hip, Fun and Yum!!!!"}
{"text":"This really just about the Happy Hour deals. Great Happy Hour until 7, which I think is later than it used to be or their Scottsdale Quarter location. Half price drinks and $1 hot sake. Same for appetizers, including some shrimp. Great bargain and they have no problem with lingering and checking back right before HH ends."}
{"text":"Best Happy Hour in Ahwatukee. Keep the DJ,  great ambiance. Very simple and delicious rolls. The hibachi crudo is delightful and I suspect that all crudo options are the same. 

Stop putting random rocks from the rock decor around the driftwood on the plates. That's just weird."}
{"text":"The happy hour menu is nice. Its in the BIltmore so its a little more pricey than other places i've tried, but the sushi itself is always good. Since its close to home for me i usually make this my frequent spot with friends. Service is always good, everyone is pretty chill. The outdoor seating is my favorite its very comfortable especially when the misters are going.

Nice place to be :)"}
{"text":"We came here for lunch today and what a gorgeous day it was! Perfect weather to sit outside in their comfy chairs. We started with the fried calamari which is always a must when we go out to eat. I am cuckoo for fried calamari but I gotta say I wasn't diggin this one. Neither was my husband. It was the calamari steak strips amd was chewy. The sauce it came with was good, almost spicy aioli. I ordered a Philly roll ($6) w/ avocado which was okay. I don't know why but it tasted bland to me today...maybe just my tastebuds. 

My husband ordered a roll with halibut, spicy crab and pico de gallo on top ($12). I thought it was okay and tasted like ceviche. My husband liked that aspect but I am pretty traditional with my ceviche and do not want it in a sushi roll. We also split their spicy tuna on crunchy fried rice ($10) that I really liked. I think that was because the Puerto-Rican in me liked crunchy rice. Weird, I know. 

Overall, I liked this place but can't say it has differentiated itself that I HAD to come back. I am truly ambivalent but could easily stop in if I was shopping in the Biltmore. It has a very convenient location so you can get your sushi fix after some retail therapy."}
{"text":"Las Vegas rolls are pretty spectacular.  I went sake bombing here too, but the glasses are a little too small to do it right.  It's a fun place to go if you have a great group of friends outside for a happy hour."}
{"text":"Sushi ok. Not a lot of flavor or variety.  Long wait for food.  And to loud for waitress to hear our order. She got it wrong and didn't evey hear I ordered a beer. Our main rolls came before our appetizer.  Not coming back."}
{"text":"I'm from the northwest, and I'm used to pretty high-caliber sushi. I don't know why I thought it was a good idea to eat sushi in the dessert, but this place was actually shockingly bad. I couldn't believe all the surrounding customers had dressed up to eat this trash. I paid an arm and a leg for sushi I couldn't swallow and then had to make up for it by buying dinner somewhere else.
Stingray sushi? Try the stinging ray of disappointment."}
{"text":"We really enjoy the happy hour at this place because all the wines are $5 and they have a pretty decent wine list but overall I think the service is lacking...I would give 4.5 stars to the food and happy hour prices but only 3 stars for the service, it can be slow even when there aren't that many people in the bar area."}
{"text":"My favorite spot for consistently good sushi and interesting mixed drinks (and $2 warm house sake). A little too expensive during regular hours, but the happy hour menus are really good. They just changed the menus and times for happy hour and it's partly an improvement and partly not. Here's the breakdown:
Happy hour times: M-F 2:30-6:30pm (earlier than before) and now ALL DAY Sunday (food discounts are the same and half off ALL drinks)

Food: Half off food including all appetizers and all house maki rolls (i.e., the \"normal\" rolls most sushi places offer). New fish tacos (multiple options) are $2.50 each. 

Drinks: half off specialty drinks, wine by the glass, Kirin and Kirin bombers, and vodka drinks. 

It's definitely more than worth the price even if you order a lot. Went here with a friend for dinner and we shared three rolls, edamame, and she had 1 specialty drink. Grand total with tax was just under $20."}
{"text":"All I can say is the rolls are not made by any Japanese person which give me a good feel when j go eat sushi second the rolls were something I could have bought at Walmart and probably had better im not full at all and service and food really is just meh! If u eat sushi don't come here u will be very disappointed in the quality of the sushi. Honestly I would recommend kabuki or takamatsu or any were else because here is not were a sushi lover should come!"}
{"text":"Finally Biltmore gets a sushi place after the departure of Ayako! Well if you have been to Stingray in Old Town Scottsdale, this is same menu, etc. But I happened to like the atmosphere at this location better!
Came here for a happy hour, had a drink called the Tokyo Tease(delish!) and since I love sashimi sushi (which isn`t on the happy hour menu, no big deal), ordered my sashimi combo, which didn`t disappoint!! Included tuna, salmon and yellowtail. Did enjoy the bevy of assorted rolls that went by. I like the outside/inside seating bar- great on beautiful weather days! I will be back for more!!"}
{"text":"I would give Stingray five stars for their happy hour! They have a lot of sushi and apps, and $5 sake bombers. 

I like the design of this place. It has that retro 70's feel. 

The last time we were here I had a really sweet server. I wish I could remember her name! The other few times I've been the service has been lacking a little.

The fish here has always been fresh, just a little expensive and the portions are a wee bit skimpy. Thats why I love the happy hour!

I will continue to come here for happy hour! (which I believe goes until 7 or 7:30 wish is bad ass!)"}
{"text":"Eegads! I have eaten here twice and think I have a pretty good feel for the level of saladry at this place. I can only describe my experience here as slimy. And NOT in the good way. I ordered a chinese chicken salad here and it tasted like eating a wet onion. I returned hours later with my bowling team and ordered a steak salad and that was an overwrought mess. The steak was grey and the salad dressing was a disconcerting clearish white. The lettuce was soaked and limp. I will never return. And don't even get me started about the Chili's on Farmer and University. Follow me over there for more great review."}
{"text":"This is a good sushi place.  It's in Old Town Scottsdale and does draw a trendy crowd.  My wife and I had an enjoyable time (the large sushi boat is very nice).  The service was very good.  It only gets four, not five, stars because it's \"Spendy.\""}
{"text":"Overall I was really impressed. We just ordered off of the Sushi menu. It was super fresh and hit the spot. Our waitress was attentive and seemed like a cool person that cared about our table. Saki bomb with Sapporo, always a good choice. The only think that was a little \"meh\" was the decor. Looks out dated and too orange. I would go back for sure, though."}
{"text":"We love this place. We base our review on the fresh fish and this place has the best fresh fish hands down.  We recommend sitting at the sushi bar for extra attention. You get free Miso soup and edamame. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"another spot I went to that had a ton of flies and very little interest from staff to fix the situation..."}
{"text":"This is a great place to come with a date. The sushi is very fresh and the staff is very knowledgeable and over all a great place to dine. They have some specials that are pretty good."}
{"text":"Did not order the sushi - made the mistake of ordering the Spring Roll and Lobster Tempura.  Both were basically inedible - oily and flavorless.  The sauce with the spring roll was sugary.  The sauce with the lobster tempura (which was supposed to be lemon aioli) was basically just gloppy mayonnaise.  My cocktail (one of the \"specials\" with lychee) was horribly sweet and I don't think had a bit of alcohol. Service was indifferent.  A very bad experience all around."}
{"text":"Food is decent, atmosphere is ok, prices are little schizo. Some rolls are reasonably priced (your standard spicy this, spicy that and other typical fare) but I've never seen a roll that costs $25 in Arizona. This is Scottsdale, I get it, but that's just kind of egotisitcal, no? The sushi and tempura were delicious, but just knowing that the $20+ rolls were lurking on the menu made me feel strange. Should I not be wearing tennis shoes here? Are the host the hostess snickering about my attire or sassy loud mouth? I don't know, maybe not. But that's kinda the vibe I got. Oh well, I left with a good aftertaste and a full belly.

Extra points for allowing dogs on the patio AND bringing my dear bloodhound some agua when it was so hot out. I'll always return to a canine-friendly joint."}
{"text":"I remember when this place first opened -- I was so excited to have a sushi restaurant so close to my office.  I never wrote a review back then, but I always found the food at Stingray to be mediocre -- definitely 3 stars.  I went there yesterday to meet a friend after work, after having not been there in a couple of years, at least, and the place (or the bar) is pretty gross.  First, the whole bar area has a sour smell like it hasn't been thoroughly cleaned in a good while.  Second, the bar stools are all covered with this faux suede fabric and many of them are stained.  Gross.  Third, when I sat down, they had not yet cleared an area of the bar next to me where someone had been eating.  After they cleared away the dishes, they didn't bother actually cleaning that area of the bar, as there were still chunks of rice and patches of sauce remaining on the bar.  Fourth, although the drink I ordered was good (I figured the alcohol would kill any bacteria present), the glass it was in was sticky, so I had to try to find a non-sticky spot every time I picked up the glass.  Fifth, even the happy hour menu was dirty.  It had some hardened food stuck up on the top, right hand corner.  Gross.  

Needless to say, I didn't end up ordering any food and we left after we had our first drinks.  That place needs a good, thorough cleaning, and the staff needs to be trained on how to maintain an appropriate level of cleanliness -- especially as a sushi joint."}
{"text":"For what you're going to find in Phoenix or Scottsdale or Tempe, this place gets top billing in my book. I've been twice. Once when I first moved here. My first experience was good, yet I found the prices to be a tad too steep for regular visits. Plus, it was a weekend night and the crowd/music was too loud for me. 

So, imagine my surprise when my friend and I stopped in here on a regular weekday for happy hour! We were seated in the sushi bar area at a table with comfy chairs. I absolutely love the interior decor. Very relaxing. 

The service was some of the best I've had anywhere, hands down. Jenni, who waited on us, was spectacular. I recommend you ask for her section, when you go. 

I love how they serve you warm towels for your hands. Now that's classy. Plus, it just feels so good, even during the summer. 

So, let's break down Happy Hour:
$1.50 for sake. Yum.
$2 for salmon nigiri.
$2 for quail egg shooters.
$4 for futomaki roll. 

There are many great options on the happy hour menu, including $2 edamama and $3 draft kirin. My friend and I opted to split the Sashimi Sampler Boat (for $20). It came with 3 pieces of different fish: octopus, albacore, salmon, yellowtail and tuna. DELICIOUS! And the pieces of fish were bigger than most sushi joints.

When I asked for low sodium soy, I was told that's what's always on the table. I shoulda known; it's Scottsdale, right? I was also told the fish comes in fresh daily. It sure tasted fresh. Even my sushi-smart friend commented on the quality of fish. Plus, we each got two yummy gummy treats with our receipt. Very nice! (Those little things are so addicting!)

What a great happy hour! With the service being excellent and the atmosphere being super chill and relaxed, I will definitely be back for another 'round of happy hour fun. You just may not see me here on the weekends - too loud and too crowded."}
{"text":"Quality of the roles and nigiri, subtle flavors and textures, extremely pleased with all of it."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere and excellent sushi but didn't really like the service. One of the hostesses was putting on makeup at the front desk and then we had to wait forever our waitress! I know we went on a Saturday night and they were busy but still everything took forever! I will definitely go again but maybe to a different location or go on a not so busy night!!!"}
{"text":"Great for lunch! I had never been here for lunch but walked over after there was a huge line at Chop Shop. I ordered some edamame to start, a chicken teriyaki bento box and some assorted sashimi. Food was hot, tasty, fresh, and came quickly. The lunch portions were great and the pricing was very reasonable. Definitely high quality for the price. The service has always been great here & that was consistent again this time as well.

I come here for dinner often and now I'll be coming here for lunch more frequently too."}
{"text":"Going with 3 stars as the average of my experiences at Stingray. If we are talking about the sushi bar, it would be 4 stars, if we were talking about any other seat in the house it would be 2 stars.

Happy hour prices allow for lots of food at pretty great sushi prices, so I totally recommend going then, but be warned expect to wait...a long while.

Hostesses, generally unfriendly and regularly flirty with servers and other members of staff...at the host stand...in front of guests. The sushi bar is almost always empty, even during happy hour, which I never understand because that is where I have always had great service and my entire order has come out as described. Plus who doesn't want to miso soup you get there as soon as you get started! Both times I have opted to sit elsewhere, there were pretty serious issues with service standards, speed and accuracy. 

Either way, when I am in the area I will still be stopping by, especially during happy hour, and most definitely sitting at the sushi bar."}
{"text":"I am pretty disappointed with my recent experience at Stingray Sushi. I was excited to come and rushed from work to make it before happy hour ended according to their website. Online it says their happy hour is from 3pk - 7pm.  I got there at 6:40pm.

When I arrived and wanted to order, the waitress said happy hour was over. I said give me some time to look and then I went on my phone and pulled up the website and it said 3pm - 7pm clearly on their website. I showed the waitress and she said these exact words \" I'm not sure where that's from. That is not our website. I've had multiple people show me that site and yeah our happy hour ended.\" I was just so shocked I didn't know what to say. I didn't want to be a jerk but I was kinda annoyed at this point and didn't want to order food, so I politely asked for Sapporo light and 10 min she says Sapporo lite and Sapporo are both sold out. Mind you this is Wednesday evening at 7pm. 

Either way, I would have loved to try the sushi but didn't get a chance to. I will consider coming back next time if some friends want to go but this was a pretty bad experience that definitely deters me from wanting to try stingray.

You can search \" stingray sushi happy hour\" on Google and the first link will bring you to their website showing the happy hour times."}
{"text":"Not bad. We hit up the patio for happy hour with a large group of friends. I think the deals you can get with the happy hour menu make it worth while. The patio is nice, large, and comfortable, and it's a nice view of the area.

Had some tacos which were great. Would definitely get those again. Had shrimp tempura which was nice and tasty. I tried some rolls that my friends got and they were pretty good. Very reasonable price for happy hour. The yakitori was good, too.

The service wasn't great. It took awhile to order stuff, especially drinks, and someone was drinking soda but never got a refill, even after a request and seeing other people get their beers, cocktails, etc.

That being said, I would be happy to stop in for happy hour again. I plan to make a trip to try the full menu sometime, too."}
{"text":"Nice place with good food, but it's a little pricey. We recommend RA or Sakana if you're looking for good sushi in the Ahwatukee area."}
{"text":"If you are looking for really tasty sushi I wouldnt recommend this sushi. The food is OK, but the drinks were really good! I really enjoyed the atmosphere and martinis, but not my favorite sushi! It is a good place to socialize so I would consider coming again."}
{"text":"Stopped by today by suggestion of a friend and was not disappointed. Great happy hour specials that are good all day on Sunday. Went early in the afternoon and it wasn't busy at all. Ended up sitting outside and the weather was perfect. Our waitress was excellent and very accommodating. Ordered the Godzilla roll (excellent), spicy tuna and salmon (really good) and the Las Vegas roll (excellent and interesting take.)  Received our rolls promptly and the presentation was nice. The only thing wrong with this visit was an obnoxious loud family that sat next to us and wouldn't shut-up. Restaurant is highly-recommended and will be going again."}
{"text":"I enjoyed a nice spring day in Scottsdale at the patio of Stingray Sushi.  I have to say the ambiance of the restaurant fit well with the feeling I had that day.  The unagi and tuna sashimis were excellent.  The one problem I had is that the entire time our waitress didn't realize that we didn't have the little dipping square for our soy sauce and wasabi.  I was waiting the entire time to see if they would notice, but I let it go and compensated by using my plate for my soy sauce.  I didn't really care, but I was curious to see if they would even notice or offer it.  It wasn't even a busy service, so I give a star less than I would normally give for lack of attention."}
{"text":"Beyond disappointed in today's experience at Stingray on Ray and I10. As a frequent visitor of the establishment I am typically satisfied with the service and food. However, today was a different story. After being seated by the hostess it took 10 minutes for anyone to even acknowledge us, which was our waitress saying she would be right over. The hostess ended up getting us water 5 minutes later. We sat and watched as 2 tables seated after us had their orders taken. Eventually, the bartender walked by and I asked her if we could order, and she took our order. Our edamame came out cold and not completely cooked, but, we were all starving and suffered through it. Our sushi came out and was fine. We waited another 20 minutes for the rest of our order to come out, yet, it never arrived. At that point I notified a gentlemen, who I think was a manager, about how we had been neglected. He apologized for the experience we had, willingly comped our entire bill and sent us home with the food we originally ordered boxed up. I really hope that this was a one time experience and not a sign of this establishment going downhill. Thank you to Brendan for taking care of us towards the end of our meal as well as the hostess who was beyond helpful although most of this experience was out of her control."}
{"text":"Granted it was late when we got there, but no excuse for bleh food. I guess the prices are the offset, it's not too expensive.

The beef skewers were too tough for me to choke down. The sushi was okay."}
{"text":"This place is a mystery- wrapped in a bad sushi roll. It has such a great location and a pleasant feel, but they just don't seem to care about their customers. We have tried it before with mediocre results but tonight was the final time. Although we were seated quickly on this Thursday night, they were out of a few drinks we ordered, which is always weird when the restaurant was not busy at all (a clear sign that word has gotten out about this place.) Anyway, we ordered what they did have to drink, and then we talked and waited, and waited, and talked. So a great place for a visit, but if you want food and service this may not be for you. After 20 minutes we still did not have our drinks and the waitress had not been back to check on us so we left. Again this was not our first experience of bad service here so three strikes and we were out- not to return again!"}
{"text":"GET THE MORNING DEW ROLL.

I recommend it to everybody, it is such a delicious sushi roll. I love this place, you can sit outside next to the busy street, or inside. It is a little cramped inside, and the dim lighting and loud music make it hard to have a conversation. This is a place for a night out on the town.

The waiters always have a fine, friendly attitude, and the service is generally quick. They don't take reservations."}
{"text":"Post-annual-review day, I wanted to treat myself to a baller lunch, so Stingray at the Biltmore (BFP) came to mind! And it was a superb first impression!

If you are not accustom to the map of BFP, its located walking distance from the epicenter of everything, but its worth the little cardio!

After stepping through some remodeling projects around BFP, I finally arrived to an artistic, grand entrance.  And what I mean is you are fronted by a very tall, Japanese inspired wooden door with modern trimming.  So far so good! =)

I open up and was greeted immediately by the Host and was offered to sit either at the swanky bar/lounge section or the contemporary, bamboo decor dining area.  I chose bamboo for the lounge seating.

After being seated, I noticed a nice feng shui touch they had was placing a bamboo plant centerpiece next to a little pouring jar of soy sauce and a warm cloth they brought out to cleanse your hands with!  What a great lunch so far and I haven't even talked about the food yet! =)

As always, beverage comes first and I decided on a cool refreshing mango ice tea! C'est bon! It had the right balance, not too much tea and not too much mango! Some places is really awful in trying to get the right balance!

So after spending a good 5 minutes and another 5 minutes and asking the waiter what is popular and not too filling, I opted for the Yakinuku, which is thinly sliced, NY strip steak with sauteed veggies drizzled with seasoned soy sauce.  I was content with my selection--now the waiting.  At this point I thought I gaze around and started to take mental notes on the high-end wall decorations and I mean HIGH-END! Time elapsed and my food arrived.  The presentation was just as good as everything else around me. This place was on a roll! 

Before I dipped my chopsticks in to my glorious protein dish, I had to take a quick snap for my Facebook upload. And finally, I went in for the kill! Très délicieux! It tasted great as much as it smelt great!  BTW, it came with a side of white rice (not sure if brown is an option--didn't ask).  I thought the meat was cooked to a tender perfection with the right amount of vegetables topped with very flavorful sauce.  It filled me up just right.  

I typically do not order dessert, but because I actually had room to spare and this place was on roll like a hot craps game, I decided to order their green tea ice cream! All I can is, perfect, as expected.  I've had this before at other places and its either just as good or a little better.

What can I say? Stingray hit a home run for a great lunch escape from the office.  I plan on doing it again!"}
{"text":"Stingray has mediocre sushi compared to a few places I've been around town. I'm not sure what it is exactly, but I think the location has a great deal to do with it.  lol It's like they don't try hard enough to differentiate, but since it's on Scottsdale road they know business is almost guaranteed. 

I went with a girlfriend of mine at the time and I remember her trying to get me to eat the fish eggs. Ugghhh I'll never do this again in my life. lol j/k When I added them to the top of my sushi rolls it was delicious though. Definitely not for the weak hearted! On the flip side I like the way this place is laid out. Stingray is kinda small but has a cool vibe flowing through out. The service is up to par and always on point, while food is served in a decent timeframe as well."}
{"text":"Stingray's happy hour menu rocks. They have sushi rolls and appetizers for $4-$5, plus half-priced sake (all sake, which they don't explicitly state on the menu), beer, and wine. I recommend the shrimp shumai dumplings for an appetizer... fantastic. 

The sushi was not the best I've ever had, but it's definitely more than acceptable. The Stingray Roll was my favorite. Service was great, and so was the ambiance. I'm excited to go back when the temperatures cool off and we can sit outside and enjoy happy hour for three hours."}
{"text":"I ate here before during the off hours which was probably why I had thought this might be a nice place to take my wife for dinner. 

First of all the blue fin tuna was 19.00 a pc. That's ridiculous, I thought for that price I could have had a piece of Cecil the Lion. The prime filet my wife ordered was literally raw on the inside when she got it. I think she got Cecil! The waitress was nothing more than absent for most of our time there, which would explain to her why I had to stack my plates in order to have room for the dish I was eating. The manager was less than sympathetic about the steak which made me realize what I was in store for. When the it finally showed up, I was finished and had to watch my wife eat. She said it tasted very good but if you can't get it right the first time, try, try again. 

The bill was completely hosed up as I told them twice that they charged me twice for an item and they screwed that up trying to fix it.

Here is my opinion. If you are looking to get a great drink and nice happy hour prices and meet fake people trying to impress other fake people, this is the spot. I must admit the sushi was good but not good enough to put up with the shit I had to put up with on a Friday night date with my wife. For the money I spent, I could have eaten a hell of a lot better, had decent service and had no attitude as a side dish. I should have gone to \"Steak 44\"

I will not be back."}
{"text":"In the current foodie state of things in the Valley, there's a lot of really exceptional sushi to be found and at very reasonable prices. Sadly, Stingray doesn't rate super high in my book. The sashimi was by far the best thing we had at Stingray and I totally recommend it. Super fresh, melted in your mouth! The sushi was perfectly adequate. Fresh but nothing really noteworthy or thrilling to the tastebuds. Very small rolls compared to other Valley sushi establishments, particularly given the price point. Yummy cocktails, although at Scottsdale prices (and being a downtown Phoenix kinda gal, I'm not given to overpaying for equivalent cocktails, so \"that don't impress me much\"). Honestly, I was grateful someone else picked up the tab or I'd have been even less impressed."}
{"text":"Had lunch with a colleague on a Thursday. Look over the Bento selections and against my better judgement went with the Salmon Teriyaki. Not good, not bad just very average. 
I like the happy hour, it is always a lively time and drink and food specials are great and deserve 4 stars. Just was not impressed with lunch there."}
{"text":"Can't beat the happy hour deals! Lots of interesting appetizers to fit everyone's cravings. Go hungry so you can stuff your face :)"}
{"text":"Yummy sushi for it's location!!!! We walk to this place from our condo and it's super convenient...."}
{"text":"Good sushi, great happy hour pricing and selection. The service could've been a little faster for the restaurant being empty but nothing to phone home about."}
{"text":"My husband and I are Sushi Pro's we have and try a lot of Sushi Restaurants all over the country.  I would say Stingray Sushi in Chandler AZ is one of our favorite places.  The Sushi is amazing.  Very fresh, great specialty rolls, Price is very good they really could charge more but they don't.  Our Waitress Kayleigh   (not sure if that is right spelling ) was so much fun and very good-!! Her recommendations and super nice personality -  were spot on to what were hoping for!!!   We will be back !!  thank you Stingray!!"}
{"text":"Great looking restaurant.  It was very clean and provides a great atmosphere in line with the Scottsdale culture.  We were greeted promptly and sat according to our preference.  Our waitress came by in a reasonable amount of time to take our drink order.  After she took our drink order it took and excessive amount of time for her to come back for our food order.  My wife and I gave her our food order specifically requesting soy paper instead of seaweed stating the fact that I don't like seaweed.  Our food arrived in an appropriate amount of time.  One of the rolls, the dragon roll, came out with seaweed, and we had to send it back.  We had to ask were the tempura shrimp was in the tempura shrimp roll.  The ratio of shrimp to crab and cucumber was way way off.  As far as the food itself the size of each piece of sushi is 3 to 4 times the size of any normal sushi roll.  This made it impossible to eat with chopsticks in one bite.  I enjoy sushi for the combination of flavors in each piece of sushi and to have to eat a piece on multiple bites makes it so you only get part of the ingredients per bite.  The bill, yikes!  They uncharged $1 for the soy paper which is normal.  Almost $70 for 3 rolls at lunch time!  Overall, the food was mediocre, the size of the rolls was abnormal, the ratio of ingredients was way way off, the price was high, and the service was terrible."}
{"text":"This tiny sushi joint is in a prime location.  That's the real draw.
The sushi is just okay (and you can get the same sushi at Geisha-a-go-go which is more fun).  The hamachi kama is just okay.  The steak is just okay.  Overall, this place is average.

I wish I had better things to say about it, but the service was not great (it was not bad, just average) and the bill was high considering the quality of everything we ordered.

Would I come here again?  Nah."}
{"text":"Came here for drinks and sushi after a Yelp event.

The positives:

The bartender was nice (and cute).
The bar opens up to the patio, so we had a nice view of passersby.  
The spicy tuna roll was pretty good.  For $7, it was not a bad deal.

The negatives:
The bartender forgot my champagne (oh well... I didn't REALLY need to drink).
Bugs kept flying into my friend's drink (hey - it is outside).
The tuna sashimi I ordered, which was not very good, was $21!  I asked if they had fatty tuna (Toro) sashimi and told the bartender I just wanted a couple pieces; I think I got six or seven pieces of Big Eye Tuna... but sheesh!

Would I come here again if I was in the area?  Eh, maybe.  Would I come up here specifically for this place?  No way."}
{"text":"Seriously bad sushi.  After a few terrible rolls accompanied by even worse service we dediced to cut our losses.  We paid our bill and went down the street to Cowboy Ciao for dinner.  You should do the same."}
{"text":"I was in the general area and spotted Stingray Sushi at the corner of my eyes. Since I haven't had any sushi since I got back from Japan a month ago, I figured I would give it a try. 

The restaurant was absolutely empty. We were the only table there in the afternoon until we were getting ready to leave. General dining area is very well decorated. Hostess and waitress were friendly. They let us picked anywhere we wanted to seat. I picked the sashimi lunch box that came with 9 pieces of fish, cucumber salad, small portion of rice and a miso soup. The miso soup was quite delicious. However, I was very disappointed in the sashimi. It was greasy, not fresh at all with lots of tendons on it. Towards the end of the meal, I simply couldn't finish the last 3 pieces. Rice is a bit dry for my taste. I couldn't quite eat that neither. Overall, it wasn't quite what I expected.

On the other hand, the lobster taco and Lobster Ceviche taco were quite delicious. They were generous in portion but a bit overprice. At least we walked out saying we had good tacos at this place LOL. I might come back here again to try other dishes, but probably will not order sushi here again."}
{"text":"We've had a great experience in the past so my wife and I decided to come here for a quick lunch date today and it was quite disappointing.  The booth where we sat to eat was filthy. I'm not kidding you, there were crumbs all over the place and I'm pretty sure it was left over from the night before. The fabric also had a moldy scent to it. Will not be coming back here again even though the sushi were pretty good."}
{"text":"Nice! Great Uchi No salad and Casa Blanco maki. Service A plus. I would recommend this restaurant any day!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THE SUSHI HERE!  I've eaten here MANY times and I've never had a bad roll!  Their rolls are large compared to local restaurants- always a plus!  Drink menu is so-so.  Decor is fun... orange can be a tad too much sometimes.  I LOVE sitting outside and people watching.  A definite stop if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Exceptional personalized service by the server/manager . The spicy edamame was delicious & they have good low-carb options. Great location in he centre of the Biltmore shops. Nice outdoor patio with misters"}
