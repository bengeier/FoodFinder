{"text":"After moving to Pittsburgh almost a year ago, I decided it was finally time to check out a Pittsburgh institution and go to brunch at Pamela's. At the server's recommendation, I got the strawberry hotcakes (with fresh strawberries) and Lyonnaise potatoes. Yum. I was a little confused about why they call these \"hotcakes\" when they seemed more crepe-y to me - but very tasty nonetheless. The potatoes were crispy and superb. This is not a breakfast to have daily (or even weekly, probably) if you're watching your sodium or fat intake but it was certainly a great diner meal. At $7.50 for the strawberry hotcakes and $3.00 for the potatoes, I thought it was just a tad pricey for a place that doesn't have real maple syrup. That being said, the next time my dad visits, I'm bringing him there. I know he'll love it."}
{"text":"The food is good but the service is bad, they think they are doing us a favor by serving us. It's your job a$$hole!!!"}
{"text":"Apparently Pamela's is a most try for their pancakes, but I wasn't impressed.  It tasted like a thin, greasy, fried crepe.  I prefer my pancakes light, fluffy, and melting in my mouth.

Seeing as how the pancakes are the main attraction, I'm not in a hurry to go back.  The service was average to slow, due to the large crowds, and the decor & atmosphere is just ok."}
{"text":"AMAZING!! We almost licked our plates. We were visiting Pittsburgh and this was the highlight of our trip. I had the famous pancakes, with strawberry and sour cream filling, and they definitely earned their reputation. I read that Obama had these flown to the White House for him and I would believe it."}
{"text":"CASH ONLY!?! Ridiculous. Pretty sure the over priced food could off set the cost of accepting debit/credit."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Savory and sweet breakfast items are great here.  Their ingredients taste fresh, and they make a great veggie omelet."}
{"text":"Went for break fast  had french toast and omlette. Food is good and nice.Nice and wonderful coffee. The issue is you have to wait for long time to get in. It's famous though ."}
{"text":"Wonderful!   Clean place, wonderful and cheerful staff, and the food was delicious!   Don't mess around - get the pancakes they are famous for - you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Pamela's in it's various locations for over 20 years, mainly for the pancakes, which are indeed wonderful.  However, in my visit today, I desired a second cup of hot tea. The server attempted to charge me again, a second $1.90. When I objected, I was told it was the policy.

I spoke with the manager. He would not change the policy, and said only that he would talk to the general manager. I asked if the restaurant charged for a second cup of coffee. Of course not. Refills on iced tea? Free, of course. I pointed out the cost to the restaurant of that second cup of tea. (Approximately seven cents, including the generic tea bag, a few ounces of hot water.) He only reiterated that he couldn't change the policy.

It's a shame, I've enjoyed Pamela's. But until they change this obnoxious policy, I won't be returning."}
{"text":"If your dish does not come with the potatoes, get a side of them! A staple of this restraunt. 

Lidia's is characteristic for its interesting takes on typical breakfast dishes- like pancake crepes!"}
{"text":"Pamela's is just the best. The staff is really what makes this place great and keeps me coming back (far too many) weekends. They are always attentive and once when they messed up my order they offered it to me on the house. Gale's favorite eggs is my favorite next to their waffles. The crepes are fine but much too sweet for me. Also their bacon is thin, but whatever."}
{"text":"Pamela's may not be the worst breakfast place I've ever been to but it is certainly  the most overrated. Ordered a mushroom omelette with the lyonnaise potatoes. The omelette was extremely under-cooked and the mushrooms were bland, soggy and metallic tasting as if the cook had just scooped a spoonful out of a can and plopped ithem into the eggs. The potatoes were also soggy and tasteless. Other members of our party had the pancakes which were slightly better but far from worthwhile. Figuring that it might have been an off day we tried Pamela's a second time when we returned to Pittsburgh a few months later. Exact same result.

I just don't get why this place has any sort of good reputation. I've had some good breakfasts in Pittsburgh. Just never at Pamela's."}
{"text":"Love to explore and compare diners in and around Pittsburgh.  Pamela's in Squirrel Hill gets a \"10\" from me.  The egg whites veggie omelette was a home run, the Lyonnaise potatoes are killer, and even the black coffee was perfect.  I always enjoy some hot sauce on my breakfast food, but I couldn't bring myself to potentially mask the flavors, which were outstanding.  

Liz was the attentive server, while I understood that Luis was the cook.  A tip of the cap to the team at Pamela's. It couldn't have been a better!"}
{"text":"I do like this Pamela's better than the one in Oakland. While I think the one in Oakland is fun to go with friends, this one is quieter and nicer for a breakfast with hubby."}
{"text":"I don't know why Pamela's is popular.

Hangover food? Yes. Filling? Yes. Cheap? Yes. Impressive/good quality? Noooo.

Orange juice is from concentrate. Maple syrup is corn syrup. Whipped cream is not homemade. Basically, you're getting cheap food made with cheap ingredients. That's FINE if you're in the mood for a quick grease fix. Pamela's will satisfy you. It's tasty enough for what it is, but I would never rave about it or say it was anything special. I feel very much let down because I expected something better based on their reputation as a Pittsburgh favorite. I'm actually kind of mad about it. I need to calm down! Also, the servers have been unfriendly on several occasions.

Still looking for a Pittsburgh breakfast gem..."}
{"text":"Excellent quality and quantity and great bang for your (cash only) buck!  I order Gail's Eggs every single time I come here but have sampled husband's pancakes, omelettes and hashes- all incredible.  The staff is warm and welcoming and there seems to be very little turnover as I continually see the same faces, year after year.  My only complaint is the cash-only aspect, but since they're so good they can get away with it."}
{"text":"How could you be closed on Dec 26th! How!!?? Why would you do this to us! We had to settle for eat n park.... You're Still the best though! Best breakfast in the burgh."}
{"text":"Although bigger than its previous location (now including outdoor seating) this new location seems to be lacking the pizzazz and charm that it had before. However, the food is still great greasy spoon breakfast grub; can't go wrong with their hotcakes and be sure to give their corned beef hash a try. Also don't forget cash as it's still cash only!"}
{"text":"I love their Lyonnaise potatoes. Best I have ever had. My favorite hotcake is the banana walnut one. What I don't like about their omelette is that the fillings and the egg part are always separated and as you cut through the omelette they fall apart completely. So it feels like you have ordered scrambled eggs and a side of veggies/meat rather than an omelette. Although this might be a style, I am just not a fan of this type of omelette."}
{"text":"It doesn't look like much, but Pamela's is a great breakfast place and almost a Pittsburgh institution at this point.  My wife got the chocolate banana pancake and I just got english muffins and eggs and both were perfect!

We went at about 8 AM and were seated immediately."}
{"text":"Delicious!  My husband and I ate here for brunch on a Saturday morning.  We were able to walk right in around 9am and were served immediately.  We shared the chorizo hash with fried eggs, strawberry hotcakes, and a side of lyonnaise potatoes.  Everything was absolutely delicious.  The strawberry hotcakes are stuffed with fresh strawberries and sour cream which was a surprisingly amazing combination.  I would go back everyday just for the lyonnaise potatoes.  Do not forget to order these when you go!  Quaint, diner environment with an open front-room if the weather is nice.  The perfect brunch place whenever you visit Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Always worth the wait!  The hot cakes might kill you if you're already on the verge of blocking an artery, but they're worth it!  The potatoes are also some of the best I've ever ordered anywhere.  To top it all off, the wait staff is always on its game. 

If you're not willing to wait, you can usually walk right in after 1:00 or so."}
{"text":"What makes a fabulous all-day breakfast joint even better? When they move to a larger space that's lighter and brighter and even has a small outdoor patio, that's what! You can't miss with anything on the menu at Pamela's. A must is the Lyonnaise potatoes with any meal . . . so scrumptious! 

I love the fact that they give you a nice-sized carafe of coffee so you don't have to wait for refills, and it's pretty good coffee to boot!

If I lived in the Burgh, there is no doubt this would be on my regular rotation for weekend breakfast . . . maybe even a couple of days during the week, too!"}
{"text":"A long time ago, I went to a Pamela's with some friends, and walked away upset because I didn't like the ala carte system; the best deals are with the set breakfasts, and you pay more getting exactly what you want.

I still don't like that, but it doesn't hold me back from giving this place five stars, mainly because it's that good.  If this is your first time to a Pamela's, by all means get the pancakes.  They don't make 'em like this anywhere else.  The lyonnaise potatoes are also really amazing.  Recently, all I ever order is the blueberry stuffed pancakes - again, I could nitpick, and say I wish the blueberries weren't as cold as they are, but again - those pancakes.

As far as this particular location goes, it's the newest, and much larger than the old location.  They give you carafes of coffee at your table, and the mugs themselves are no longer those chintzy little plastic things, but solid ceramic.  Things like that matter."}
{"text":"Creative egg options; Crepe-style pancakes; great diner coffee; friendly and efficient staff!"}
{"text":"Good place for brunch and value for money. Their potatoes are very delicious, with lots of flavor. Food portions are HUGE.

I like their omelets with veggies. The fruit cup was a bit too sweet as they added syrup. Their strawberry pancakes are good. A great balance of sweetness and buttery.

Services is good for diners. Make sure to arrive early to avoid long wait duringvl weekends."}
{"text":"I went here after a Saturday morning of hauling debris to clear space for an outdoor classroom wanting one thing - something to satisfy a serious hunger.  Fortunately, that's what Pamela's is good at.  We also got there at a pretty good time, around 1:30, so our group didn't even have to wait for a table.

I got the stuffed banana and chocolate chip hotcakes.  They were on point.  This was also the only time that I actually was able to eat the entire things.  The portions are typically very large, so unless you spent your morning doing physical labor you probably won't be able to finish everything (without regretting it).

This is a solid brunch place. I've taken visitors from out of town to Pamela's a couple times and it's a staple PIttsburgh experience that I'd be glad to repeat more often."}
{"text":"PANCAKES!  YUM!  I only have three issues with Pamela's.  The wait times, the small tables, and the fact that they don't take credit cards.  Otherwise, YUM!  They have the best pancakes in Pittsburgh and, quite possibly, the country."}
{"text":"Always very busy but our meal has always been great.   Their hotcakes are fabulous and I also really like Gail's famous eggs (scrambled eggs with cream cheese and green onions)."}
{"text":"Was here for breakfast - epitome of diner food breakfast for sure.

Protip: Hotcakes are not pancakes.  This place serves hotcakes, meaning they are greasily cooked platters of batter and will taste as much.  It might not be everyone's favorite, or even good, but it does serve a purpose.  I probably could only eat them once a year - or every two years - but they have an appeal.  (To be fair, I can only really eat one pancake or hotcake, they just automatically fill me up).

Coffee is served in carafes here - excellent.

This place gets 3 stars because it's a cool hang and place to eat with friends, but there's nothing extraordinary about it or that draws you back when there's so much more around that's shiny and attractive."}
{"text":"I'd heard lots about this place. Went on a date here. As someone who loves breakfast food, I was not disappointed. Got myself cheesy scrambled eggs and their crepe style pancakes. Portions are hardy, delicious, and I couldn't finish it all, even though I tried my darndest. The prices are great given the portion sizes.

If you are a lover of all things breakfast, you must come here."}
{"text":"Weekend in Pittsburgh and we had at least three friends tell us we need to go here and we confirmed that after breakfast.  This is a basic diner with great breakfast food.  Our group had the spinach & feta omelet, the pancakes, the Banana chocolate chip pancakes, and the raisin French toast.  Our favorite was the Banana Chocolate Chip pancakes....sliced bananas rolled in a light chocolate chip pancake topped with whipped cream, SO GOOD!  The portions are large, breakfast potatoes are great, crispy on the outside and soft inside.  About $10 per person.  We arrived at 8:30 on a sunday morning and were seated right away.  By the time we were done there was a line for a table, but turnover is fairly quick and worth the wait."}
{"text":"Surprisingly, I am not a big Pamela's fan.  It is OK,  not too expensive and a pretty big menu except that they do not have waffles!  How can they not have waffles?  I will get them a waffle machine!  I am not a big fan of their pancakes as I think they are too greasy and I prefer the light fluffy kind....Eggs and toast items are OK.... Good place to take kids."}
{"text":"Nah. I just don't get it... I just don't get it. Pamela serves  really basic breakfast food - sorry. I'm always amazed by the lines waiting to be seated. I've tried Pamela's numerous times and  consistently disappointed. The establishment never seems really clean and  feel the same about the food - greasy omelets/potatoes drench in sauce. etc. The service is usually decent which is why I'm giving it two stars.  If your in a crunch -hey it can work. Brunch and breakfast can sometimes be challenging in the Burgh...and Pamela's it's a no go..."}
{"text":"They are most known for their strawberry pancakes, that the Obama's love.  But i tried the croissant french toast with caramel pecan.   WOW.   best breakfast ever.   I want to go back SO bad.   :(     There was ALOT that sounded amazing on the menu.   A must.   Yummy.  
My hubby on the other hand had an omelette, and the famous potatoes.  He said the omelette tasted like a stick of butter.   :(      I would def go back.  they only accept cash, which also sucked."}
{"text":"Pros: Food was very tasty

Cons: Service was awful.

This was my first time visiting some friends in Pittsburgh.  They told my girlfriend and I Pamela's was the best breakfast in town.

We walked in and were told to sit anywhere. There were some open tables that were cleared, but none of them were wiped down, so we sat down at the cleanest booth.  Our table had crumbs on it and was stick, but what ever, we didn't mind. 

Our server greeted us fairly quickly. She was very nice.  We ordered our food and got it very quickly.  Another server gave us our check with our food and walked away before we had a chance to ask for silverware.  We figured she'd be back shortly to check on us... After about 10 minutes my girlfriend went to ask another server for silverware.

I cut into my omelette to find it was broccoli and cheese, not bacon and cheese as I had ordered.  The writing on the check was chicken scratch, so no surprise there. Again, I waited and waited and at my potatoes (delicious!) and toast, had another few cups of coffee.  Our server never checked on us again, but we cut see her across the room just standing. 

I asked the cashier to ask the kitchen to remake my omelette when I went up to pay.  I had to wait a while for the recook, but I got it to go, and it was good the next day.

My girlfriend is a server, so I'm very sympathetic to my servers and usually tip at least 25%.  This is one of two times I didn't leave any tip."}
{"text":"Our all time favorite breakfast destination. Grandchildren come from NY for the pancakes that are out of this world!"}
{"text":"Loveee this place so much! Pancakes are nice and thin with the crispy edges and very buttery:)"}
{"text":"I had maneuvered the hungry crowds waiting on Murray for admission into Pamela's over multiple weekends and decided it was finally time, as a resident of Pittsburgh, to be one of the masses waiting street side.  Fortunately I went with just one other breakfast lover and our wait was less than the quoted 10-15 minutes.  We were ushered in after about a 5 minute wait.  The service here is fast and efficient.  After binging on leftover Halloween candy, I opted out of the famed California french toast or crepe items and instead got the more savory corned beef and Swiss omelet.  It was really delicious, and I agree that the potatoes are excellent. With quick service, good coffee, and wonderful breakfast fare, I imagine that I will be a regular sidewalk obstacle for Murray weekend pedestrians."}
{"text":"I've been coming every Wednesday afternoon for about a month now and only have about 30 minutes to eat and the girls here are always so good about coming to the table as soon as I sit down and bringing the food fast without me even asking. Makes my life a lot easier and obviously the food is amazing. Wonderful service."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here to look for some good breakfast. Their food is tasty at first, but it takes just for one or two bites later until you realize that it's way too greasy and extremely salty! We had ordered multiple items since we were very hungry and we were completely disappointed when all of their food tasted exactly the same! A salty heart attack!"}
{"text":"My experience was 2 stars but I give 3 out of praise for what they do so right (pancakes and potatoes)
So my mistake was to skip the pancakes and order the omelet. What kind of cheese project liquefies and runs like that? I got omelet because I don't like wet eggs. ew.
Potatoes were great. It's nice to know they are they same at each location. 
Sadly the service is the same at each location.  One person takes order, one delivers it. That's it. You practically have to set up flares again to get someone's attention if you need anything. No followup.

Only taking cash is still annoying but not tallying the check so it is hard to figure out what you need, calculating a tip etc is more math than I like to do in the morning."}
{"text":"Get the hot cakes and the hash. 

They are the perfect combo for a guilty brunch. The hot cakes have crispy sides but a soft and buttery inside. If you want them stuffed, the strawberry was my favorite - the acidity cuts the oily fatty feeling (vs. the banana walnut one). The hash was a wonderful savory complement - it was a combo of cheese, meat and potatoes in harmony."}
{"text":"I still don't get the local attraction of Pamela's.  It's the place to be seen on weekend mornings, but the food is mediocre at best.  Combine it with bad service, and you get two stars.  I've been 3-4 times now, and the waitresses have, on all visits, forgotten something, brought food out at weird intervals, or otherwise demonstrated a lack of any sort of focus on good, consistent service from the owners and/or managers.  

Do yourself a favor and hit a better brunch place for better food or just hit the Eat'n Park down the street for solid brunch food with better service.  

I really want to follow my standard rule and take another star off for not taking credit cards, too, but I'll be nice and keep them at two.  Pamela's is by no means a tiny mom and pop place, so it's time for them to realize that it's not 1985 anymore.  (Of course, that would make it harder to hide revenue, too.)"}
{"text":"Overrated. The food is not worth the dining experience and the staff is less than friendly or accommodating. I'll never attempt to eat here again."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Was my first time having corned beef hash and now I'm scared to get it anywhere else because I don't want it to be ruined for me. I also got the California French Toast topped with bananas and walnuts. My girlfriend got the California French Toast topped with chocolate chips and walnuts. We both give this place 10 out of 5 stars. Was only in town for the weekend competing in a fitness competition but anytime I'm in Pittsburgh, there's no doubt I'll be visiting this place again!"}
{"text":"It was empty but service was still lousy. I asked the waitress for cheese to go with my fries and she brought back 2 slices of American cheese. What am I supposed to do with that?"}
{"text":"I feel like this is the best one comparatively to all of the Pamela's locations. It is cash only which is the only drawback. The food is excellent and is always quick."}
{"text":"Best pancakes/hot cakes I've ever had.  I'm not in the pancake fan club but these were amazing. Thin and the perfect mixture of crispy/chewy. The stuffed cakes are actually rolled up with whatever you choose.

We will definitely be back next time we're in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Wonderful crepe pancakes and great service!!my waiter was very attentive ...food was out in less than ten minutes I was amazed 
Everything was perfect...I will go back and take my family next time!"}
{"text":"Today I was in a Pamela's Pancake Coma. After ingesting two of these famous little devils, I proceeded to race to the airport (Because we left the restaurant too late) and missed my flight back to Boston. I am writing this waiting for 5 hours, and I still am not hungry for lunch. At least I ended my trip home well. 

This story, only validates the fact that when growing up in Pittsburgh,  Pamela's is the best staple breakfast joint. The previous location in Squirrel Hill was a tiny little hut, but now, the new Pamela's Upstreet takes over the old Panera space on Murray Avenue and includes garage door-style front patio.

My staple at Pamela's has to be the crispy crepe-like chocolate chip, banana stuffed pancakes! They are thin and decadent. Buttery and rich. After eating two of these, you will be stuffed, happy and ready for a mid-morning nap (or a missed flight) I also love that they also have a special called \"The Morning After,\" Which, I feel like describes the quality of Pamela's \"Hangover Cure.\" Also, don't forget to try the semi-famous potatoes alongside a carafe of hot coffee for 1.95 pp! 

My only riff is that I find it problematic that our server was busy and couldn't be that attentive. I'm sure the weekends are a circus show, but I still give them 5 stars. It's a diner people! 

Maybe next time I'll eat at Pamela's before the day of my flight. So I can stuff my face, and go home to take a nap."}
{"text":"I go to Pamela's every other Saturday. I can't say how good it is overall because I always get the same thing and it's delicious. the chirizo hash and eggs is one of the best breakfasts I've ever had. it keeps bringing me back. One day I'm sure I'll get something else but that day is not in the near future."}
{"text":"Pamela's is a Pittsburgh staple. I feel like you have to go to Pamela's if you live here, or if you're visiting, or if you're just driving through. The hotcakes are famous, and are something between a crepe and a traditional pancake with a little magic thrown in. The banana chocolate chip hotcakes are definitely the best ones and I order them every time, but I've also seen people order: the croissant french toast, different hotcakes, hash, and omelets and no one has ever been disappointed. The potatoes are also awesome. Probably the best breakfast potatoes I've ever had. 
The main problem with Pamela's is that everyone and their mom visits on the weekend, so plan on standing around a bit to wait for a table. They also only accept cash."}
{"text":"Delicious, filling breakfast place. Quite crowded in the weekend mornings. Service is okay but sometimes plates and glasses are a little dirty."}
{"text":"Believe the hype. Great food and service. Had a wait on Sunday AM but line moved briskly. 

Crispy edged hot cakes were worth the trip. Lyonnaise potatoes were off the charts. Best of all was the Pittsburgh Hash. Unique and loaded with flavor"}
{"text":"Some friends and I took a day trip to Pittsburgh from Cleveland, and our first stop was to get some brunch at Pamela's. It was crowded and there was a long line, but that's how you know you're in the right place.

Now it has been a while, so I can't quite recall the food anymore, but I do know that it was delicious, filling, and very reasonably priced. I do remember that the hotcakes are recommended though!

The reason that this experience really stood out to me, was the attention they placed on their service. Now we had a decent group of people, and one person got her order before everyone else did. There really wasn't that significant of a wait in-between though, so imagine our surprise when the server actually apologized for the wait, and gave our entire table 50% off our meal.

The experience here was enough to make our entire trip worth it!"}
{"text":"Good for brunch. Dishes are pretty heavy on carbs,  fat and cheese. But they are delicious. once in few months it's ok to have that kind of food. Service is pretty quick on weekday mornings. Cash only."}
{"text":"Pamela's has the best pancakes. period. The Lyonnaise potatoes are amazing as well. I wish I knew how to make these at home kinda good. The eggs are always prepared right and the corn beef and swiss omelete is a must try. Just go. eat. enjoy. It's that simple."}
{"text":"Wow the pancakes. So good that I went back for more the next day. 

I've been to the Shadyside location many times, but this was my first time at this location. I think the breakfast is priced really well for what it is. The staff is very adept at managing the crowds. 

Cash only. Kind of annoying."}
{"text":"This location has a long line (that moves surprisingly fast ) for a reason.  Excellent pancakes and corned beef hash as well as kind and efficient service.   Really a perfect breakfast!!"}
{"text":"I had a cheese omelette here and it was super delicious. The complimentary  fries and the garlic bread were also good. Would surely visit this place when I go back to Pittsburg again."}
{"text":"Would you serve a table food that was sitting out for 20 mins at a different table because you got the order wrong? Yeah. Gross. 
My friend ordered pancakes and I ordered corned beef hash. They were delivered to the wrong table. I see the waitress take the pancakes from the table (which was within earshot since i heard the convo about the mistake) go behind the counter then serve the same plate to our table. obviously the pancakes were cold and unappetizing but the waitress didn't seem to care. We let the front counter know and they made a new order, but the fact that they would do that in the first place is just wrong. My food on the other hand was feshly made but arrived later. 

I was so grossed out by the pancakes that I cannot even comment on the food. My appetite was ruined."}
{"text":"The food is awesome! Best pancake (or shall I say hot cake)!? Crispy and delicious. 

But the service was not great. Waitresses were rude and service was very slow. 

However the food is worth it. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"The Obama's love their pancakes so you know they're a big deal to the locals. Love their corned beef hash and eggs but my favorite is the banana walnut pancakes with bacon. Delicious doesn't begin to describe it. Cash only and they get busy so go during the week or be patient."}
{"text":"Grease + Huge Portions + Low Prices = Solid Breakfast"}
{"text":"Best brunch in the city. The hotcakes (plain, blueberry, or strawberry) are amazing. So are the breakfast potatoes and hash.  Anytime someone from out of town visits, we take them here and they love it."}
{"text":"Come hungry because you're going to leave stuffed!! Wait time on a Saturday morning was around 20 minutes for a party of 2, so it wasn't too bad. There are other small shops in the area to browse if you're waiting for your name to be called.

We ordered corned beef hash, hotcakes, Lyonnaise potatoes, eggs, and a sausage patty. Definitely overestimated how much we could eat since we had a ton of leftovers afterwards and we skipped lunch. The corned beef hash and hotcakes were definitely the highlight of the meal!! 

Great diner with some delicious food! :)"}
{"text":"There are a few Pamela's in the Pittsburgh area. This one happens to be in the heart of squirrel hill. If you didn't know Pamela's is Barack Obama's favorite restaurant in the city of Pittsburgh (however, he typically frequents the one in the strip). Pamela's is open for breakfast, brunch, and lunch. They are famous for their crepe style hotcakes and Lyonnaise potatoes. Their hotcakes are very thin and usually packed with goodies inside. My personal favorite is the banana chocolate chip ones. The Lyonnaise potatoes are the most scrumptious potatoes in the world. They are in between a home fry and hash style of potato with onions and lots of butter. I simply cannot go to Pamela's without ordering a side of them. The squirrel hill location has bottomless coffee for $2, which I also always enjoy. They can range between in expensive to moderate in price, depending on what you order. I would say that most people can find something delicious and filling within their budget here. 

The only downside to this place is they are very popular, which means you are likely to wait for a seat. That being said, they are so worth the wait!"}
{"text":"The pancakes are apparently the big thing here. Literally and figuratively. They are pretty tasty, but honestly it's pretty hard to have bad pancakes. Otherwise, the other foods are okay -- just typical breakfast/brunch foods. Maybe I'm just not a breakfast person."}
{"text":"Eaten here twice and had to return food twice.  First there was a piece of metal from a cleaning utensil in my eggs then there was a piece of plastic in my omelette.  Customer service was poor - I had to pay for both meals!   The only thing worth eating here are the crepe-style pancakes, otherwise it's typical poor quality diner food at a premium price."}
{"text":"On our way out of town, we stopped by Pamela's to fuel up for the road.  The food here is extra greasy, but also extra delicious.  They can get a little crowded later in the morning, but when we visited around 9 on a Saturday morning there was plenty of seating available.

I think most of Pamela's dishes are fairly good, but there are two in particular that I would recommend.  On this particular visit I got to eat some of both - the Blueberry Hotcakes and the Corned Beef Hash.  Actually, any kind of specialty hotcakes are great.  Pamela's hotcakes are kind of crepe-like - thin and buttery, and extra delicious with any (and all) kinds of toppings.  The corned beef hash is tasty, and my favorite out of the savory dishes.

Overall, good food, low prices, and decent portions.  Great for breakfast or brunch!"}
{"text":"Horrible coffee!  So bad the Shadyside Pamela's used to allow customers to bring their own from the coffee across the street. Has been wretched forever so I have lost hope. 
The food is great, especially pancakes. But if u want real maple syrup you'll have to bring your own."}
{"text":"Out of the Pamela's locations I have been to (Strip, Shadyside, Squirrel Hill), this is the winner. Everything was quite excellent and the food was the best as I have ordered the same item from all three diners.

Visited on a Monday morning. It was average, not completely busy but also not empty. This might have meant that I had better quality of food because the cook was not rushed. Also, other reviewers have stated that it is \"dirty\" when they are visiting on a weekend, the turnover for customers is crazy I doubt they have the chance to clean up the floor when they have such a breakfast/brunch rush!

Service: \"Please Seat Yourself\" the sign states. So we did! Soon after a gentleman came over with water and asked if we were ready to order. Yes we are! Very polite. Food was made quickly and brought out to us all at the same time.

Atmosphere: A lot of older customers were in here compared to any of the other locations I've been too. It was very clean and has a little more character with some of the seating being church pews. 

Food: I ordered the cheese omelette which was perfect, alongside some lyonnaise potatoes and toast.  The potatoes were perfect! I don't know what they did but they were so good I could have just eaten a bowl of those. Bread was slightly under-toasted, but with the speed that the food came out I'm not surprised so I cannot complain about that. 

Drinks: I just had water, my father ordered coffee and he got a whole pot of it which was nice. I find it's hit and miss at Pamela's, sometimes the server leaves you a pot of coffee and other times not. It might possibly be due to how busy it is but I thought that was nice. 

Price: No cheaper or more expensive than the other locations. You can have a meal for sub $7 if you do not order a drink (and just have water) which I think is an excellent deal!

Restrooms:  Clean. Nothing special.

Overall: I would like to come back here in the future. Just like many of the other locations, parking is an issue (as it is on street) but this is nothing to do with the business itself. 5 stars, I like it."}
{"text":"Two breakfasts in two days - I do love me some Pamela's.  This location is especially awesome because both days, I was able to walk right in and sit down (no standing out on the sidewalk for an hour like at the Strip location).  I'm not saying you can do that all the time - there was a line when we left - but we did an early-ish weekend breakfast and didn't have to wait.  

As always, the food is consistently good, the service is fast, and the portions are huge.  CASH only, which gets me sometimes, but it's a small thing for an otherwise excellent breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Wow. This place is everything everyone always said it was. Honestly, I was skeptical, and I thought it was all hype, but I'm a concert! I ordered the strawberry hotcakes, and they were mind blowing! Instead. Of regular pancakes, they tasted more like high quality crepes! For the price you pay, I'm impressed they were as good as they were! They were nice and crunchy on the outside, and soft and fluffy in the center. The whipped cream was fluffy and melted nicely onto the hotcakes, and the strawberries were as fresh as they get! They didn't use those weird preserves or anything like that. The portions are huge too! When ordering you get 2 hotcakes per order, and 1 was already enough to fill me to the brim. As for service, They kept our cups filled and service was great! I thought it was a bit funny that they had so many pictures of Obama everywhere, haha. Oh! Remember, this place is CASH ONLY!"}
{"text":"Good Breakfast spot. However not outstanding. Try strawberry hotcakes."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great to go to when you need some quick delicious breakfast. Only downside is the line you'll have to wait in to get in on weekends."}
{"text":"What a disappointment.  Pittsburgh, explain your obsession with Pamela's to me now.  It makes no sense.  Pamela's is decent, though slightly pricey, for just diner food.

You know how you can tell a place isn't worth your time?  When you and your friend are eating at Pamela's and can only discuss how good Murray Ave Grille's breakfast is.  Finally, you both admit you would rather be at the Grille.

Lets start with the big issue:  The service SUCKS.  Apparently, the servers split their tips at the end of the shift.  So no one bothers to serve you.  One guy took our orders and brought drinks, and another girl dropped the food on the table.  No one asked if we needed anything, and no one bothered to check that the food was OK.  So...servers working a buffet do more work than the servers at Pamela's.

I got the ham and cheese omelette, with the potatoes, and rye toast.  The actual breakfast was good diner breakfast.  There was a nice amount of cheese, this potato hater thought the potatoes were good, and the rye toast was fantastic.

There is outdoor and indoor seating, which is nice.  The place is rather packed, though.

Cash only."}
{"text":"Best Breakfast in Pittsburgh. There is a reason why this place is always so crowded. If you don't like Pamela's breakfast, you might not be able to feel happiness."}
{"text":"There are diners and then there's Pamela's.  There are no diners like it.  If you only want to eat once day - this is it.  You won't be hungry for 24 hours.  Everything you order is so freakin' good.  Fuck the diet.  Fuck your exercise.  This is carbs overload.  Just order those omelettes and split, yes, split them with your friends.  Portions are humongous.  Forget about cappuccino, they'll bring you hot chocolate and it will mmmm-good. And yes, the lines are EPIC on weekends.

Seriously, this place hits me every time I visit Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"This place is cool.  I dig the crepe pancakes.  The malted waffle was good too.  Tried a ham and egg club sando with onion rings and the pile of rings was real respectable.  Good eats and they kept the drink refills coming.

They are cash only which was a slight inconvenience.   Being from out of town, the closest ATM hit me for $3 service and I am sure my bank will do the same on the other end."}
{"text":"A 15-20 wait for Sunday brunch--not bad for a Pamela's location.  Service was quick once we were seated and the food even quicker.  We were eating 5 minutes after ordering.

I was super thankful for an EGG WHITE VEGGIE OMELET that actually wasn't greasy, YAY.  This is sadly never a given anywhere.  The omelet comes unseasoned, but with salt, pepper, and hot sauce available at the table, I'm not one to complain.  Filled with plenty of mushrooms, my favorite.  My SO loved his STRAWBERRY HOTCAKES, a go-to order for him, but the thin crepe-like pancakes they serve here are a nice touch.  The filling could have used more cream, but this certainly wasn't a dealbreaker.  Coffee and hot tea were super basic but satisfying.  We were out the door for 24 bucks before tip.  A simple, family-friendly ordeal."}
{"text":"Love Pamela's! Obviously, not the place to go if you're trying to eat healthy, but their salty lyonnaise potatoes and buttery hotcakes are amazing for a Saturday brunch."}
{"text":"Not a bad place for brunch once in a while, especially if you're looking for some comfort/hangover food. They have pretty standard brunch selections--hotcakes, French toast, omelettes, eggs, bacon and sausage combinations, etc. They also offer burgers and salads. Nothing to rave about though. Hotcakes are apparently their specialty, but get them plain and they will get too buttery and sickening after a few bites. 

Which is why most people go for their various hotcakes with toppings; an especially recommended one is the banana walnut. The strawberry cream is also quite good. But do keep in mind that the main thing that turned the hotcake into such a sweet concoction is a couple days' worth of sugar and syrup. At the very least, their breakfast combinations are huge (so as to keep in proportion with the sugar maybe).

Their service is also mediocre; they try to have it like a diner atmosphere, but in reality what happens is that your server (or any server at all) rarely comes by once you order and the food comes. It was a challenge to ask for a refill of water. At the end you bring your receipt up and pay at the counter (which only accepts cash, beware), and then as common courtesy you have to go BACK to your table and leave your meager tip for their meager service."}
{"text":"Very cute, it took awhile to serve us though (and it wasn't busy). Reasonable prices. The food was amazing and the vibe was very chill but not as warm as the typical diner."}
{"text":"Stopped by this morning for breakfast before heading for home after CMU's Ceilidh weekend.  Found the line for a table was rather long but moved fairly fast - it is always worth the wait for the great fare!

Today, I enjoyed the Chorizo Hash - spicy and very flavorful with a good size portion.

Service moved at a good pace from placing our order, to getting our food right through paying...

It looks like we will be making this a regular breakfast spot while visiting CMU!

Thanks for yet another GREAT meal."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Pamela's several times over the course of my life and I think I just made excuses for it the entire time. Because it had lines down the block and was basically the only breakfast spot in squirrel hill, I felt like I had to deal with the awful stomach aches I'd get after. The truth is, there is simply TOO MUCH butter on this food. If you see the pancakes in my picture, you will see the edges are brown and fried and completely greasy. This will give a lot of people a stomach ache folks! Can Pamela's be tasty? Sure, because butter can of course be a tasty thing. But I cannot keep pretending this is good breakfast when it's not.

This time around I had a egg sandwich as well, and it was small but decent tasting. I cut off the pancake \"crusts\" and ate the inside. Maybe the omelettes are safer and less buttery, but I don't really like omelettes, so I can't comment. The potatoes are very delicious but rich and will add to your existing stomach ache."}
{"text":"Delicious, cheap, great service. I prefer the Pamela's on Walnut better (atmosphere is more quaint, and I love the decor), but I'd totally go back!"}
{"text":"We arrived on a Sunday morning and it was pretty busy. We gave our name and waited. It didn't take too long to be seated. Our waitress came quickly and was nice. The place it's self has an old 50's to 60'd diner feel. Even though they were cleaning tables it didn't feel clean even though it looked ok.  Your crammed in pretty tight and they have no concern about smashing a highchair against your table for the table sitting next you. The food came quickly and at 1st tasted delicious... about half way through the grease/butter/oil from the potatoes caches up to you and since it tates good you continue untill all the greese/butter/oil soaked food is gone and you realize as your stomach begins to remind you, eating it wasn't a good idea. 
 
It also seems a bit pricy compared to other similar places. 

They also share the space with another restaurant called NU Jewish cafe (something like that) when they really should occupy the entire space. And as I found out don't dare stand any place around the other restaurant unless that is  where you plan on going or you will receive a tongue lashing."}
{"text":"Banana chocolate chip hotcakes.  That's all you need to know."}
{"text":"Mom & pop's place with large portions and great (inexpensive) prices. You can taste the freshness in the food: no boxed or prepackaged main ingredients from what we could taste and the food was deliciously seasoned. So so good. Like... I know my reheated left overs are gonna taste good! 

On another note: Bathroom was clean, and we had the pleasure to see the staff thoroughly clean the tables and containers. Service was quick and genuinely friendly. 

CASH ONLY!!"}
{"text":"If you live in Pittsburgh, you have to come here for  breakfast/brunch. Amazing hotcakes. They're more like a cross between a crepe and a pancake, but so buttery and delicious. They do get sickening after a while though. I also recommend their Lyonnaise potatoes. Crispy, oniony, salty, and delicious. I've also tried their cinnamon raisin bread. Very sweet and full of fat raisins.

For lunch I've tried their fish sandwich. The fish is huge and they give you a lot of fries, but it is an average fish sandwich. 

Come really early in the morning, otherwise line is always long, especially at the Shadyside location. Overall, large portions, cheap price, not good for diet."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! Came in Friday after thanksgiving and it was super packed. There was a wait for most tables, but because we only had 2 we were seated right away. I had the chorizo omelet. It was great! The chorizo wasn't greasy, the eggs were moist and it had the right amount of cheese. The potatoes are the best diner potatoes I've ever had! Coffee was ok, but bottomless and they give you a carafe on the table so you can refill yourself. My partner got fluffy scrambled eggs with cream cheese. He loved them too. 

Note this place is cash only. The food is worth the wait if you have to. And it's reasonably priced. I highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"The food and service were outstanding! I absolutely love the banana and chocolate chip pancakes!!! Yummy!"}
{"text":"Looking for a greasy home style breakfast? Pamela's doesn't skip a beat. Even though they are famous for their hot cakes I personally am more of a fan of their omelettes. The potatoes shouldn't be ever skipped and the coffee is perfection. Make sure you bring cash because they don't accept major credit cards. But don't let that stop you!"}
{"text":"I was visiting friends. In Pittsburgh and they said I had to try this place.  It was quite good and the pancakes were bigger than my head.  But being that I'm a Jersey native, I'm a bit biased on diners.  It's certainly good.  And most certainly worth giving your business to.  But if you want diner food, get on 80 and head east."}
{"text":"Wow!  The banana and chocolate chip pancakes are incredible.  Great little diner.  Will definitely be back next time I'm in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"The food here is worth the wait on a weekend brunch and the service is great. I came here for the first time today with a good friend of mine, she got an omelet I got a crepe. Both dishes were delicious. 
That being said, management really should update to accept credit and debit cards."}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast spots in the entire city!  If you go on a Saturday or Sunday morning you better be ready to wait in line!  The place fills out really fast.  People don't really stay here for too long so it's not too bad of a wait.  Food is delicious and the service is always on point."}
{"text":"Food: usually good, but pretty sub-par this morning.

Atmosphere: diner. 

Service: TERRIBLE! We were forgotten apparently. We waited 15 mins for drinks, then 15 until WE FLAGGED SOMEONE DOWN who was not our waitress, to place the order. The food was fine, but we obviously got dropped and it wasn't even busy!!! 
I would have complained in person but I was with company and that's inappropriate. We both remarked about how strange the service was. So disappointed!"}
{"text":"Well I was fortunate enough to have the presidential pancakes. No there actuly called Pamela's famous crepe-style hotcakes.  President Obama was right. They are worth the trip. I would say this is a place for regular visits."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast! The waffle and the corn beef hash were of the best I've had in the area. Coffee was good and the waitress was attentive. The diner was busy even on a Tuesday morning, but it's easy to see why."}
{"text":"I am a man who cares about pancakes. Pamela's makes the best pancakes. Period. The home fries are also excellent. Everything else is fine (eggs, bacon, omelettes, etc.) but not amazing. They don't have pure maple syrup... and usually that's a deal-breaker for me when it comes to pancakes, but the pancakes are so freaking good that you don't even have to put anything on them at all.
6 stars for the pancakes, 4 for everything else, call it 5."}
{"text":"Yummy breakfast, huge portions, great price point.

I had an omelet (I like mine a bit underdone) and it was perfection. My BFF had the corned beef hash.

The service is exceptional, even when they are slammed. I can see why locals love this chain/place."}
{"text":"This is a place we always take out of town guests, and I wish more people would visit us, because I can't get enough of the crispy, salty-sweet hotcakes at Pamela's.  

My partner is partial to the Corned Beef Hash, which even as a side can be two meals (for some people). My mom likes the crepe pancakes.  For me it's hotcakes all the way, or if I'm feeling indulgent, the specialty hotcakes, with bananas and chocolate chips. The lyonnaise potatoes are also tasty if you need some additional starch.

The coffee generally leaves something to be desired, and it's a bit annoying that they're a cash only joint, but the food comes out fast, and as long as I've got hotcakes in front of me, I'm happy.

Expect a wait if you go on the weekend."}
{"text":"Took a couple out of town friends to the new Pamela's location on a Monday morning. Our server was cheerful and friendly, and refilled drinks as if he were reading your mind. Our food came out SUPER fast. I mean like LIGHTNING. Our friends were really impressed, which makes us look good. The new interior is adorable, still retaining the retro kitsch everyone loves. Probably the best experience I've had at any Pamela's so far!

My only peeve with Pamela's is their bacon. It's not that good. It's too thin and skimpy and tastes like that microwaveable, pre-cooked bacon you get at the grocery store. I wish they would upgrade to some nice thick pepper bacon or something.

STILL cash only."}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast spread with locations throughout pittsburgh. Expect a wait but its well worth it!"}
{"text":"As a breakfast food person, enjoyed the casual dining with homemade feel of all the food. Got to try their crepe like pancakes with syrup or go for the specialties with fruit. Love the Monday After Breakfast Special - no nonsense eggs your way, meat and pancakes. The hash dishes are yummy. The servers are easy going and let's you be."}
{"text":"I am a fan but not sure I would return. Bacon was wafer thin, near paper thickness. Zero flavor too. Eggs real good with good color yellow yokes. I had a plain waffle. Was best I've had anywhere by far. Pancakes same. I really liked the thin and near crispy edges. I rated less than 5 stars only because of lesser bacon. Very good service.
Yes, I would return just because I really like the waffle and pancakes."}
{"text":"This is a mixed review. 

We were pleased to see that the OG Pamela's had spread it's wings and moved to a bigger location. Since our fair President had visited Pamela's (and made her pancake recipe a White House staple- holla!) this modest chain has gained much more popularity it seems- even though there were always lines around the block to get in.

Pat and I elected to sit outside, even though it was rainy and humid. On the far wall there is a bunch of old Pamela's memorabilia, but the patio are was super cramped, and felt kind of generic. My rear end brushed against the table next to me and my eyes met the glare of a not so pleased diner (not that u can blame her- I was in workout gear and this was a post-workout brunch). 

The service was prompt and friendly. I ordered the Spinich and Feta omelette, with a side of pancakes (oh course!) and it seemed that somewhere between the trek \"upstreet\" the size of the omelette had shrunk. The pancakes were as delish a ever though.

I don't know- I would come again but would elect to sit inside next time. The vibe seemed a lot more authentic in there, with much more elbow room.

Ps. Glaring girl, if you are reading this, sorry 'bout that.

Pss. Cute blonde waitress who thought I was a dude and kept calling me a \"him\", it's all good. I've been called worse. ;)"}
{"text":"I'm not the only one who thinks Pittsburgh's obsession with Pamela's is strange. 

It's an extremely limited diner plus crepes. Please stop calling them \"hotcakes\".  They are not hotcakes, they are large delicious crepes. It harkens back to a time when people wouldn't eat that fancy shit. So, \"hotcakes\". Embaressing. 

Other than that it's a decent diner.  Cash only and it's basically exclusively breakfast. I think they close at one or two. The menu, after the crepes, is an extremely limited selection of breakfast norms and some salads and some wraps for some reason. 

There is a wait most weekends. The service is service. Apperently servers don't have sections and split tips? It's crowded and noisy even on weekdays. I'll call the ambiance \"Pittsburgh Excited\". Which is fine. But it's not nearly as good as \"I Could Read A Paper\". 

I don't have anything against Pamela's, really. Its the mystic I have a problem with, it's a three star (or maybe four star becuase delicious crepes) diner with a five star reputation.  

I don't think Pittsburghers really know what a diner should be like. Eat and Park, Pamela's and Ritters have ruined your concept of a diner. Eat and Park is a place for crazy people with overweight children and Ritter's, much like AA, is a an event for drunks except without the alcohol (thumbs down), so Pamela's with their hotcrepes gets all the praise. 

Crepecakes are delicious, but please, stop treating it like the prize of pittsburgh, it's embarrassing."}
{"text":"I've had my share of complaints about the chain of Pamela's restaurants--most saliently, very few menu items are good and you shouldn't call yourself a diner if I can't walk in and get breakfast for dinner--but the one in Squirrel Hill really hit a new low the way they kept us waiting.

Yes, I know Pamela's is very popular and one should expect a line.  I would have had no problem with a line.  There was no line.  There were tons of empty tables.  But my brunch companion and I were left standing around.  A simple miscommunication or oversight by the staff?  I thought so too, but after talking with two staff members three times, it was obvious that was not the case.

Eventually I figured out the problem: there were two of us, and they didn't want to waste a table that could seat four people on a mere couple.  This seems like a bad business practice on a number of levels.  First, it annoys your customers to keep them waiting.  It annoys them even more when they're standing next to multiple empty tables and aren't allowed to use any of them.  Second, with no line and many empty slots, it's hardly profit maximizing.  I could have been halfway through my meal by the time another customer walked in, and given the relatively late hour and the way the crowd was dwindling, the restaurant might not have been completely full at any point for the rest of the day.

I always thought waiting in line at Pamela's happened because it was just that popular.  But maybe it's not.  Maybe waits at Pamela's happen because they don't know how to properly manage a queuing system."}
{"text":"When I'm in Pittsburgh, I'm eating breakfast at Pamela's. The burnt ends of the crepe-style hotcakes are one of my favorite tastes of any food, ever. It is much easier to snag a table here during their busy weekend brunch hours if you're a party of two. If you come in a larger group, be prepared for a longer wait. The wait is worth it though. When it comes to breakfast, this is as good as it gets."}
{"text":"I don't often give out five stars, but when I do, it's for Pamela's crape pancakes. Cash only is annoying."}
{"text":"I had a pancake there..... NEVER CAME SO MUCH IN MY YOUNG LIFE!!!! sorry the waiter had to clean up my huge load."}
{"text":"I live half a block from this new Pamela's location....which means I lived about 1 block from the old location.  I never went to the old location - just too far away I guess - but now that they're a cozy 1/2 block down the street, I summoned the energy to pay them a visit.

Ha, no, I'm not that lazy.  Honestly it was the outdoor tables that sold me about this location - and the fact that it's summer.  I figured we'd be waiting for a table, and who wants to wait in the snow?  Actually, at 11 on a Sunday, four of us got a table within about 15 minutes, so that's not bad at all.  We got a patio table too, which was great for people watching.

I know this is blasphemous, but none of us wanted pancakes.  I know!  Everything I read in the reviews beforehand was a rave about the glorious hotcakes.  I'm sure they are delicious, I just truly cannot eat a whole plateful of sweet dessert-esque breakfast.  Maybe if I come again with my boyfriend, he will get the pancakes and I can try them.   Instead, I got the corned beef hash.

The savory dishes were all pretty heavy and a little greasy, but honestly pretty good.  I enjoyed the salty meat, the abundant potatoes, and the well-cooked eggs.  The wheat toast was hilariously DROWNED in butter...which was kind of delicious.  But it was funny in its excess.  This food is all about excess, mainly in calorie form.  I couldn't finish it, but I usually can't finish my food, so that's not unusual.  The price was right - about $6.95 for a very big breakfast.  Service is quick and inattentive - don't bother waiting for your server to refill your water glass, you will need to flag someone down.  But we lingered a bit over coffee and nobody hassled us or tried to make us leave, so that was nice.

I'd come back - it's right across the street - but I honestly find the menu limiting.  Basically, go if you want pancakes or omelets.  The breakfast options besides those are limited.  I'd enjoy a wider variety of savory breakfast options, but frankly the food is so cheap, I'm happy to have whatever they're offering.  It's filling and satisfying, and decadent in its high-cal glory."}
{"text":"Just because they moved to a bigger location (and replaced Panera) doesn't mean that the wait gets that much shorter, especially if you have a group of more than 4 hungry people.

Their hotcakes and corn beef hash are very yummy as usual. The service is fast and feisty like before. Also, CASH ONLY. Even with their attitude and the wait...I haven't been able to get breakfast as good as this so I'm willing to tolerate anything.

My must-get is strawberry hotcakes with a side of corn beef hash. You can't go wrong with that!"}
{"text":"You really can't spend more than a few days in this city without hearing about Pamela's.  I was told it had decent food at a good price, but was really over hyped.

The new location has apparently also improved the food.  Now don't get me wrong; this place is a through and through American as apple pie type breakfast joint.  I feel like calling it a greasy spoon is really doing it a disservice. 

The pancakes are great, the eggs perfectly fluffy and the meat is neither too salty nor overcooked.  On multiple occasions  the food has been consistent, quick and plentiful.  The portions are in no way small.  They aren't huge but they are more than any normal human should eat in one sitting.  

Do you want a great all-American breakfast at a great price that is in no way greasy?  Pamela's is your best bet.

Cash only!"}
{"text":"Pamela's is the GO TO breakfast spot in Pittsburgh. Whenever I have friends from out of town come visit, I always take them here, and they ALWAYS rave over how good the food was. Their famous strawberry hotcakes are to die for! The portion size is great, I normally never finish my meal! Super fast service, and friendly staff! As this place is ALWAYS packed, the only con is the wait time! They also DO NOT accept cards, CASH ONLY, that can be a little inconvenient at times"}
{"text":"Pamela's has moved from its old Squirrel Hill location on Forbes next to the library, and is right around the corner on Murray, in the former Panera Bread space. 

Even though they have put in a lot of tables in this new location, the dining area feels a lot less cramped than the old space. If you're lucky, you might even be able to snag one of the patio tables overlooking Murray. 

The food and service is more or less the same as the old location. Get the strawberry hotcakes. Even though I feel sleepy after polishing them off, those thin crispy pancakes rolled up with strawberries and brown sugar are totally worth it. The servers aren't the friendliest, but they're very efficient and will have your order out in very little time--which means you can be savoring strawberry hotcakes all the sooner.

Oh, and keep an eye out on the storefront next door--Pamela's owners are turning it into a Latin American eatery. I wish I weren't moving from this neighborhood and from Pittsburgh so soon!"}
{"text":"Never again. First I tried to get an employee to wipe a table so I could sit down but she rudely walked past me and screamed \"seat yourself\". Yes, I'm aware, but I would prefer to sit at a clean table. 

After my order my taken my bill that was given to me and I never saw my server again. I sat with an empty drink for 20 minuets before eventually going to the register to ask for a refill.  By this point my sandwich was cold and stale and not every enjoyable. I was going to make a complaint to a manager constructively so that the problem could be fixed, but I do not believe any management was present. 

I generally do like Pamela's and the food is always good but the poor service and complete lack of management has pushed me to my breaking point. I will no longer spend my money in Pamela's Squirrel Hill location."}
{"text":"Good Lord, so much good food. 
Lately I have been eating everything, devouring every morsel and leaving nothing for the other patrons.
I am on a winning streak here. 
Most portions @ this always crowded diner can be split 2 or 3 ways. 
Prices are relatively low.
This is diner food ... so expect DINER food, not 5-star gourmet fairtrade stuff. They call it a diner and run it like one. Cash only folks. Remember cash?
Expect a wait. A wait means lots of people are waiting for GOOD food ... eh?
This is a great place to kill a hangover with a pot of coffee. 
Stop by, you'll be pleased."}
{"text":"Yeah, there's a reason the hotcakes are so popular. 

They're really, really good. They're not as thick as traditional pancakes and the edges are thin and crisp, like lacy crepes. I ordered mine with a breakfast (as I failed to eat dinner the night before - I was on a plane, and then I was too tired), with strawberry topping, and it was SO DELICIOUS. If I had spent a few more days, I'd probably go again, but I'm sure this would be on my list for a return trip. 

The rest of the breakfast was normal diner fare. I have no complaints, but it wasn't particularly memorable. The sausage was greasy but good. The coffee was subpar, though."}
{"text":"When you're in Pittsburgh you have to go to Pamela's at least once. This is probably the least busy of the several locations so I recommend this one over any of the others. It's street parking but luckily on a Sunday it's easier to find.

The crepes are fantastic (banana walnut yup) and I always go for the corned beef hash. Their other egg dishes (especially the one with chorizo) is very tasty. 

Just remember - Cash only."}
{"text":"What do strawberries, brown sugar and sour cream have in common...? (see the answer below.)
Don't let the long line, that winds out of the restaurant, discourage you. These folks are serious foodies and will not let you languish, light-headed from hunger, out on the street. I walked in the door thinking that it would be a month long weight. The perky hostess, with the really cool wind-surfing shoes chirped, \"15 minutes.\" And 15 minutes it was down to the last second. 
Pamelas is one of those small, cozy (and by \"cozy\" I mean a tight fit) neighborhood places that you wish were just around the corner from where you live. 
I went with the suggestions by my fellow Yelpers and ordered the strawberry hotcakes. The hotcakes are really not the kind you'd get in most diners - these are thin, chewy, delicately browned, buttery crepes filled with....drum roll, please...fresh strawberries, brown sugar and sour cream.  Somehow all these ingredients work together in one melodious symphony in your mouth. It is just the right combination of sweet and tart. My only complaint is portion sizes. They give you two of these delights that cover the plate from end-to-end.
Service was lightening fast (5 minutes on a busy Saturday morning) and pleasant. Coffee was strong but rich - the kind you love to doctor to get it just right. The hub order corned beef hash - delish - this stuff ain't outta the can! 
If I lived in Pittsburgh, this would be my go-to breaky stop!!"}
{"text":"Had a hankering for breakfast this morning while out with the Little Man...cause, why cook at home? Decided to try Pamela's in Squirrel Hill. 1st time here, and the reputation preceeding this joint is well deserved. Not a flaw, from the service, to the food, and the atmosphere...why haven't I been here before?
The kiddo loved his eggs, bacon and hash browns. The pancakes that came with my food rivals the quality at Massarts...quite the standard to meet. The waitress was friendly and prompt...checked on us and refilled when needed. Very reasonably priced! 
Terrific place! I''m definately gonna Schwarzenegger this place...I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Wife and I were in Pittsburgh looking for a house.
We stopped at Pamela's for breakfast as it had so many really good reviews on Yelp.
I had 2 eggs over easy with bacon home fries and toast and a hot chocolate.
The eggs were cooked just right but that was were it ended for me.
The bacon was not that good and the home fries were not good and had a weird taste to them.
The hot chocolate was ok but tasted like swiss miss.
The service was excellent and was fast and friendly.
I have to say i ws disappointed after seeing so many 5 star reviews and the food being a 2-3 star.
Service was excellent and definitely worth 5 stars.
I would have to say I would not go back again at least not for eggs and bacon.
Too me it looked as though most people were eating pancakes."}
{"text":"Awesome, yet crowded, and slightly overrated. I grew up in Pittsburgh and I could pretty much walk to their previous location (not too far down the street, on Forbes) and I oftentimes did, with my mom. Their strawberry hotcakes are more like crispy crepes with a slight dose of brown sugar, sour cream, and awesomely warm strawberry topping + whipped cream. Unffff. So good. Crispity yet soft. Salty, yet sweet. I am starting to drool just typing this. I want to go back, but alas, I am in St. Louis. Overrated because the place is always freaking packed so you expect a 5 star experience, when in reality, it's only a 4. (In my book at least.) The staff can be pushy sometimes. They were telling people to \"go wait outside\" in the freeze-ass cold. Yes, I get that they need room to move around, but it seems a little harsh to say that. Why not just turn on (MORE) heaters outside and/or enclose the area somehow? I dunno. Seemed a little cruel. Thankfully there's pretty rapid turnover and we only had to wait about 15 min for our party of 3. Ran into old friends there. Man, I miss home!!"}
{"text":"Great service and even better food! 

Pamela's has been a staple throughout my college career in Pittsburgh and this location in particular is my favorite. I typically order the Morning After special, which comes with hot cakes, eggs, and meat, but I typically substitute the meat for Pamela's famous eggs. As a vegetarian, I'm very grateful that they always allow for this substitution without any hassle. Food usually arrives very quickly after your order is placed. I'm always stuffed after a visit to Pamela's - be prepared to enter a food coma after any meal here!

Other things to note: cash only, be prepared to wait 30+ mins on Saturday and Sunday mornings."}
{"text":"The hot cakes are very good. In the winter, they use frozen strawberry but they use fresh ones in summer. My favorite one is walnut banana hot cake. The service is very  fast because they always have a long line. The waiter service is ok. For 7 to 8 dollar per person breakfast, the price is good."}

{"text":"Dee-licious! Friend and I enjoyed the breakfast of Champions with eggs, hash browns, and a pancake to share. Everything was delicious! Very friendly service also on a weekday morning. The place is definitely highlighting the visit by President Obama."}
{"text":"Pamela's is amazing, I've been going here for years and never fails to disappoint. Strawberry hotcakes and omelette... Home fries are my favorite!! Always leave feeling full and pleased. When my friends from out of town are visiting I always take them here and they always rave about how delicious it was. Pamela's is definitely Pittsburgh's diner!!"}
{"text":"Love the food and the atmosphere, however some of the wait staff are very rude!!!!! My sister and I were seated, and we were asked for drink orders. Right after we were asked for our food order, and didn't even get a chance to browse the menu. We advised we needed a couple minutes to decide, and then she went to get our drinks. Observing... The same waitress automatically brought water to other tables before taking their drink orders, and throughout the meat she came to check on everyone but US... this particular waitress barely got a tip for this kind of behavior.... They also forgot the cheese for mine and my sisters eggs..."}
{"text":"Not really any good healthy items on their breakfast menu. Just crepes (no regular or buckwheat pancakes). Somewhat rough service (not horrible, just not great). The windowed area is cold in the colder months. Toast was not toasted."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Came here after reading the reviews and hearing that it is a Pittsburgh staple. The service was nothing memorable but wasn't bad. The  atmosphere is a over crowded typical diner. I do give them props for there eggs and bacon light fixture. Sadly I don't go to restaurants for decor. The food was  bad. I got a omelette with toast, my friend got their pancakes. The omelette was blend and among the worst diner omelettes I have tried. There was no freshness to the eggs nor meats. My toast was swimming in butter, I actually scraped two layers off. The pancakes that they are famous for....tasted like thinly fried butter. More like state fair food than a restaurant. I will be sticking to traditional pancakes. There are way to many diners around here to give them a second chance."}
{"text":"This was our first time at this Pamela's location and my first time ordering \"lunch\" as opposed to breakfast food. All around high marks. My husband devoured his chorizo hash, I opted for a BLT w/ fries. Very satisfied with my sandwhich, the bacon was crispy, lettuce fresh, and the fires crunchy. Service was friendly and very on-the-ball, which I've found at the Oakland location as well so no surprise there. We are looking at houses in Sq. Hill and discussed how great it would to make this Pamela's location part of our weekend routine. We'll see you after closing!"}
{"text":"Excellent I had an omelette mixed omelette was outstanding probably one of the best I've ever had doesn't sound like much but it was. everybody else's food looked excellent and the place is really cute I give it 5 stars"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE Pamela's. It's my favorite breakfast/brunch place in Pittsburgh. 
Eggs, bread and egg have never tasted better than at Pamela's. I wish they weren't cash only, but that's a really minor issue.
The wait can be quite a bit since it's crowded almost all the time (unless you go late, say around 2pm), but it's definitely worth it. The Hot Chocolate is amazing!
I just graduated from CMU and left Pittsburgh, and I miss eating at Pamela's already!"}
{"text":"Great place for brunch, but it can get busy fast! They have really good hash and speciality pancakes, which is like a crepe like pancake. My favorite hash dishes are the pittsburgh hash which has kielbasa sausage and sauerkraut and the corned beef hash. You get a good sized portion and comes with toast. I was a bit sad one of my eggs came already popped and spilling yolk but it wasn't a big deal. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First, dont let the line/crowd out front deter you! We got there and there was a bunch of people outside but we were seated within 15 mins which isnt bad for a Sunday at all. Second, the food is marvelous. I got the banana walnut hot cakes which were more crepe like than pancake, but were delicious. There was a good banana, walnut, hot cake ratio going so you could really taste all aspects. The coffee was good too. Hot and refillable. I tried my friends layonnaise potatos and they were also good. I wasnt diappointed at all. And its really not expensive but it is CASH ONLY. It has a diner vibe but the servers are pretty hipster. It caters to all types. I would definatley go back, we drove from delmont. Yummy!"}
{"text":"The pancakes hit the spot!  One order can feed two.   The potatoes are a must.  We waited until it was nearly noon and had no problem finding a table, but I can see how the weekends can get crazy.  Cash-only."}
{"text":"Ahhh, that was a tasty meal. My blood pressure's up a little bit from the corned beef hash, but it was exactly as hash should be: hot, crumbly, salty, and crispy. Admittedly, I did request it extra crusty, because most places don't take the time to let the crust develop in their frenzied rush to serve the crowd of folks waiting impatiently outside. How would it have been cooked if I hadn't requested it that way? Who knows. But props for entertaining my request and cooking it right. The eggs were over easy as ordered, the orange juice was ice cold, and the price was right.

A few constructive comments: Cash only sucks in this day and age, especially when I can't keep track of what I spend my money on unless it's captured on my credit card statement. To the hostess, if you choose to sit me down at a table that still has dirty dishes on it, make sure to have it wiped down. Sure it was mostly clean, but there was a tiny puddle of coffee from the previous diner--kinda gross. Also, it took a smidge longer than one might expect for the waitress to come around, but when I flagged her down she was more than happy to take my order.

Lastly, the overall wait for a table wasn't too bad: I would say maybe 15 minutes mid-morning on a beautiful Sunday in September. Isn't that primo brunching time? Although, with the Steelers playing at home, I'm guessing a large chunk of their usual crowd was probably tailgating..."}
{"text":"Here's my regular order:
Two eggs scrambled.
Home fries
Sausage
White toast
Juice
Sometimes I will had the ginormous pancakes.
It's a lot of food and I mean a lot. My daughter and I will share this feast and still end up going home with extras.
After this meal is consumed it takes a lot of energy to get up from the booth and walk."}
{"text":"What a fantastic breakfast. Service is good and the food is outstanding. Parking can be tricky but with a fun neighborhood like this, who cares? I'll go back here again ASAP!"}
{"text":"Went with a large group on a Saturday morning. Was seated and served quickly. Everyone thought the food was delicious. Especially liked the blueberry pancakes and Gail's eggs. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I don't know what it is, but Pamela's (both here and on Walnut St.) have really seriously gone downhill.  On multiple occasions, at both locations, I've gotten the same utterly mediocre, greasy, uncooked food, so it's not a single day's quirk.  Bacon with grease literally pooled in its nooks and just pouring off it, French toast dripping in bright yellow wet egg that had to be sent back at least once, and upon occasion twice, to get it even lightly cooked, etc.  Totally and completely disgusting.

And then the topper - the other day when I was at this location, I opted for various reasons to leave my power wheelchair at my table when I went to the restroom (in large part because it was too crowded to move it safely through the dining room and jockey it out of the dining room and into and out of the ladies' room) - and one of the waitresses took it upon herself to decide I needed it badly enough to push it back to me entirely without my permission. 

And after my telling her *straight out* to *leave it alone* at my table when she said she wanted to get it and bring it to me.

So, she got it anyways, obviously, and managed to get it back to the restroom, where it ended up blocking *everyone* from getting into and out of the room - including me - and I was tripping all over it just to get my hands washed and get back into it. 

I had put the footrest up to eat so I could get close enough to the table, and now I couldn't get it down because the restroom door was blocking it, which made it hard for me to get into it and operate it because I had to hold my legs up, etc., and more.  It was a total and utterly unnecessary problem.

While I was still in the stall, I could hear her crashing it into the door and walls repeatedly until I was *finally* able to get her to just stop and leave it the hell alone.

Before I was able to leave my own stall, I heard other women leaving the room without washing at all - and that means they also had their disgusting, unwashed hands all over my chair right after using the bathroom, because it wasn't physically possible to get past it without literally climbing on top of it, requiring hands on.  

Now pushing a power wheelchair when you are not familiar with how to operate it is no mean feat.  It's dangerous as fuck to everyone around, and hazardous to the chair itself. How she managed to not slam into and run over other customers I have no idea, because it definitely takes practice to learn how to operate one and not crash it into other people or things - but she did screw up the chair itself by crashing it into doors and walls.  

Pamela's did comp me my breakfast because of the hassle.

=============

While I'm at it, because accessibility is an important issue both to me and many other diners and shoppers, I usually say something in my reviews about what one will find in a place.  

Here, their \"accessible\" restroom stall isn't actually fully accessible at all - because they have a baby changing table in there, which blocks the ability to get a wheelchair into the stall at all, let alone turned around to get back out.  It's freestanding, fortunately, so I suppose they would be willing to remove it temporarily upon request.  I have not tried that.

Knowing about that changing table is part of why I left the chair at my table in the first place, because I already *knew* it was going to be too difficult to cope with the damn inaccessible restroom.

It's a *dirty*-looking baby changing table, to boot - with the huge toilet paper lying right on the dirty bed surface.  

++++++++++++++++

That said, when I first came in, they were *super* helpful getting me settled at a table I was going to be comfortable at, back in a corner, even thought it meant them moving some tables and chairs around for me.  I can't fault them at all in that department, or with their food service."}
{"text":"Pamela's is a unique breakfast place. First it should be noted that you can expect wait time to vary from no time at all to 30-40 minutes if they are really busy. And they often are very busy especially between 8-11 on the weekend. Also, the Squirrel Hill location and I believe most of the others are cash only. To get the full Pamela's experience I suggest you order the pancakes (the strawberry stuffed are my personal favorite) and an order of lyonnaise potatoes. The pancakes are almost as thin as a crêpe, so if you're looking for a traditional thick buttermilk flapjack you won't find it here. The service is usually very quick and pretty friendly even at the busiest times. Overall this is a great breakfast spot if you won't something unique to Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"It's a breakfast institution in the 4-1-2 for a reason, folks. Of course their famous crepe hot cakes are the sweet order, but show the savory side of your soul some love, too. The omelettes are generous and the Lyonnaise potatoes are THE best...they don't get any better than this. The pot o' joe on the table will remind you to look up from your food every now and again. Inhale. Exhale. Dive back in!"}
{"text":"I have been to the Pamela's in Shadyside, and enjoyed my meal there. My visit to the Pamela's in Squirrel Hill was very disappointing, to say the least. I went with 2 friends, and everyone's meal was dripping in grease - now I expect this place to be a greasy spoon, but this was way too much. We all left feeling gross, and I will never go back to this one again. If it weren't for the extremely limited breakfast options in Squirrel Hill on the weekends, I would not have gone there in the first place."}
{"text":"A late Sunday morning went well here.  The portions were generous, especially considering the prices.  The wait was a bit long, and the place was packed, but the wait wasn't unreasonable.  The food did take a bit longer than expected to arrive, but was fresh and hot when it did come.  The cofee wasn't bad, a tad on the weak side, as most diner coffee is.  We left the table fully satisfied."}
{"text":"Excelllent!! They serve a big portion so be prepared!!"}
{"text":"We came for Sunday brunch and my first impression was that the place is very dirty. There was random debris all over the floor and our table was sticky. Also- they only serve breakfast food on Sunday, yet they allow regulars to get lunch if they want if. They also rushed us in and out. I thought the pancakes were a little greasy. 

I really wasn't into this place and I don't get the hype. I won't be back."}
{"text":"If you are here on weekends, there is definitely going to be a wait time. I tried almost all varieties of breakfast here. My favorites are strawberry hotcake, lyonnaise potatoes and french toast. If I have friends visiting Pittsburgh, this is a to go place on the list for breakfast or brunch. There is no instance when they didnot like the place."}
