{"text":"I only have positive things to say about this place. Food was great, and I was very happy with the serving as well. And the menu was detailed, which I find really useful, when ordering with friends. And I love how welcoming the place is! Made me feel like I was eating back home for a while. And the people are so nice and accomodating."}
{"text":"A pretty tasty place overall despite my limited experience eating Filipino food. We ordered the grilled chicken, milkfish, crispy pork belly, vegetable spring rolls, with a side of garlic rice. Nearly every dish was served with what seems to be pickled radishes and carrots that had a slightly sweet flavour.   The grilled chicken was really flavourful and succulent, glazed with just enough sauce to coat bites of rice when eaten together. The sauce had a slightly spicy aromstic taste with hints of citrus highlights.   The milkfish was lightly crispy on the outside although a bit dry on the inside, but was flavourful on it's own with no complex sauces needed.   The pork belly skin was the most crispy and hard thing I've ever eaten in my life, a little too much for me even. My teeth felt uneasy as I bit down on the crispy skin side, however the lean and fatty layers below were fine. Near the other end of the slice towards the end of the lean layers, it is as also a little too dry as the entire pork belly piece seemed to be fried in oil.   The spring rolls we're crispy, light, and flavourful, it wasn't too oily for something that's entirely deep fried. It came with its own sweet and sour dipping sauce which I used to pair with the pork belly as well given it's dryness.   Although the place is partially self serve, where you go to a side table for your own utensils, plates, and other fixins, the staff at the counter in the front where you go to order your food seemed very friendly and enthusiastic.   Would go back someday to try other dishes!"}
{"text":"Ate here on Saturday night. Threw up 2 hours later. I've traveled all over South-East Asia and Latin America. When traveling I've gotten sick about twice."}
{"text":"I've tried fried chicken all over this great city, but this one is my new favourite.  It's got the crunch of Korean Fried Chicken and the juiciness of Popeyes, but the tangy flavour is all their own. It's enough to make me think about it even two weeks later.   You need this in your life. It's Lamesa quality while being reasonably priced enough for the local Pinoys not to feel out of place. I hope this doesn't change!  Pro Tip 1: Split the generously-sized silog combo (garlic fried rice, salad, egg, and your choice of meat/tofu) with someone and you'll have room for dessert.   Pro Tip 2: Get the fried chicken silog. Seriously."}
{"text":"Fresh new restaurant on St.Clair adds even more choice. Not a huge place but nice mi like the local art on the walls as you walk in. The restaurant is very casual - order your meal, take a seat and wait till they call you. Had the tofu Silog - duck eggs over garlic rice and deep fried tofu - good at anytime of day!! Really enjoyed it minus the nutmeg on the tofu, not a fan."}
{"text":"Perfect place to introduce my friend to Filipino food. She loved it. We ordered pork BBQ, bangus, lechon kawali, and kare-kare. The taste is spot on and more. I like how the place is - basic, clean, bright. Usually casual Filipino food joints have the items all cooked and displayed at the counter where the customer just chooses what he wants. For someone who is not used to the \"turo turo\" concept, it would be a bit overwhelming. That's why I do welcome how Lasa did it, no display and food is prepared as you order. I would definitely go back and bring my other friends here."}
{"text":"I went yesterday with friends to Lasa with high hopes after being impressed by the food, service, and ambiance of Lamesa on Queen Street.  We opted for take out rather than to sit down.  Pros  - Quantity of food was plenty - For ~$20 (incl. tax) per person it is enough to fill you up  Cons - The wait time. This is unfortunately the main reason I am writing this review. We ordered at 7:04pm (according to my receipt), and by 7:45pm we had not received our food.   Overall, the food was good (garlic rice at Lamesa is much better but the tofu and BBQ skewers are delicious), but in Toronto there are plenty of delicious restos for cheap authentic eats with where you don't have to wait 40 mins..."}
{"text":"It's a cute little place, nicely decorated and clean. It has a few tables inside. My sister and I went for dinner tonight. Overall it was solidly yummy.  The breakdown:  Fresh lumpia: kinda hard to eat on a small plate because it came in one big piece. It seemed to be missing the advertised tofu and potato. 3 stars.  Crispy Tofu: super crispy, super tasty! With a nice texture in the tofu. So good, 5 stars!  Bangus: again, super crispy and tasty. I don't know if I'm supposed to eat the crispy head piece or fins, so I left those (first time eatin Filipino). 4 stars  Daily special chicken mami: chicken was cooked perfect but I thought the pork belly coulda been less chewy. 4 stars  Ube flan: the best and only ube flan we have ever tasted! Amazingly yummy! I shoulda just eaten 3 of that for dinner! 5 stars  So yes! Will be back to try the fried chicken.. and eat more ube flan! Thanks!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious! Prices were very good. Portion sizes were large enough for two people."}
{"text":"I came here with a Filipino friend to get my first taste of Filipino food and walked away satisfied at trying this unique cuisine! The place is an offshoot of Lamesa on queen street west, making it a little cozier and more home-style. We ordered the Sizzling Bansung sisig, which is the national fish of the Philippines. It was so cool to watch the egg cook on the sizzler plate, and the aioli and peppers really spiced up this otherwise light fish. I also tried the vegetarian spring roll appetizer, served with vinegar instead of plum sauce, and my friend had the pork belly appetizer. Appetizers are around $6, making them great for sharing! I'm not sure if I'd go for the spring rolls again (I don't like vinegar), the minced tofu in the spring rolls was kind of off putting.   To end our meal, we got the ube (purple sweet potato) flan, which was soft and well-flavored. However a few bites in and I was done with this dish. The artificial honey or syrup that they french the dish in is just way too sweet and overpowers the ube flavor. The next day I went to No Frills and got myself a tub of ube ice cream to quench my ube cravings. No regrets there.   A few things to note: they no longer serve cafeteria style, which a couple Yelpers were confused by. They now take your order at your table and bring it to you when it's ready. Also, I think they might rotate their menu a bit because I was quite disappointed when they didn't have the ube lumpia, which I was dying to try.   Overall, I'd recommend Lasa if you're looking for a more western dining environment to enjoy Filipino food in. If you want actual authentic Filipino food, I'd recommend saving your time and money and going to Sherbourne area or up north."}
{"text":"I don't normally go out for Filipino food because I find that most places are a miss, especially with the different ways we all can sometimes cook our staple dishes, however Lasa really blew me away with the quality in how they prepared our food.  I ordered the Silog with the bbq skewers, while my partner ordered the crispy chicken. We added a side of lumpia shanghai, which came at a decent size with a great amount of flavour. The bbq skewers were VERY tasty! They were saucy, and marinated well. The over-easy egg that came with the silog was cooked to filipino-style perfection, as in, the edges were nice and crisp with some browning along the rim - serious skills back there! And it came with a little helping of achara and some salad.  The helping was HUGE might I add - so for $12, it was definitely worth it! You feel full after this meal, I will say that.  The space in itself is pretty cute and decorative with vibrant colours and eye-catching placements of picture frames, lights and a station for utensils, take out cups, etc. It didn't feel very Filipino-y to me though, as I didn't find much of that heritage reference within the restaurant. Service was friendly, and helpful and I like that you can help yourself to sit wherever you like - not sure if they do reservations, but my guest and I came early in the day for lunch, so maybe that's why we were so lucky to be able to do that freely."}
{"text":"I came by here for a mini-birthday celebration. It is a nice small restaurant with limited seating (maybe no more than 30 seats in total). You walk-in and order your food off their menu. They have shareable dishes or set meal dishes.  I ordered the Siglog Plate - with BBQ Skewers, Garlic Fried Rice topped with two sunny side eggs and a side salad and papaya salad ($12). I also ordered the fresh lumpia ($6) (it is a ube crepe wrapped with vegetables topped with plum sauce).  I love Filipino food and this place is on my 'love' list. The garlic rice was nice and crunchy but not too overpowering, the skewers were juicy and marinated to perfection. Sometimes I find the BBQ skewers at other places over burnt or too sweet but this version had a nice balance of sweetness. The salad had a citrus dressing and the papaya salad was sweet and sour at the same time.   The fresh lumpia was good but not my favourite. I think I prefer the tradition fried lumpia better. But if you want a nice appetizer on the side that isn't deep fried, the fresh lumpia is the way to go. Think of it as a crepe with ube taste filled with fresh vegetables inside.  The atmosphere is super cute in here, clean and simple. You have to get your own utensils and also remember to clean your table off when you are finished. You can also pour yourself some water available at the side of the restaurant.   I will def. be back!"}
{"text":"We had been wanting to sample Lasa by Lamesa for some time ever since reading a food feature and we finally made good on it.  Stopped in for a late dinner and was immediately encouraged to see still a healthy crowd munching away.  We order lechon kawali, fried chicken, lumpia Shanghai, garlic rice and halo halo...quite a feast for a couple but we love leftovers and how do you even choose on a first visit?!  Service is cafeteria style - order and pay at the counter, seat yourself and await your name to be called for your order.  Wait time was pretty good and our entrees came out all at once (we had asked for our halo halo to follow).  Food was hot and fresh, crispy and savoury.  Portions are pretty standard size for Filipino restaurants (what we've been observing over time); not overly generous but sufficient.  Fried chicken was delicious; it took up most of my dinner 'space' so I may be biased in saying it hit the spot.  I found the halo halo not as sweet as I like it to be/am used to.  Although a non-Filipino, I've had my fair share of halo halo and I found the shaved ice and evaporated milk a bit overwhelming.  Nonetheless, beautiful presentation and it was refreshing.  Overall, I'd say only downside is that it's a self-service styled experience - you grab your own water, cutlery, napkins and food and clear your own tables.  I'm all for that...but perhaps when you pay by card, the prompt for a tip should be removed...a bit misleading for first-timers...  We would return and would recommend checking it out!"}
{"text":"Great taste, good value.  I had takeout here and also came for dinner with my mother-in-law. For takeout, I had the fried chicken silog to go. I didn't feel like cooking and wanted something comfy to eat. This was perfect. Plus, I could barely finish it (but I did, because I'm a champion).   Dining in, my MIL and I shared the fried chicken, the Shanghai lumpia and the pork skewers, plus an order of garlic fried rice. This was enough for both of us. The fried chicken was even better fresh: crunchy on the outside, juicy on the inside, with a lot of great flavour. Note: the mayo sauce that comes with it has dairy in it. The lumpia were amazing: meaty, crunchy and quite large. The pork skewers were kind of chewy, they were the most disappointing part, but by no means bad. The greatest thing about this place is the tapas-style ordering. I generally can't commit to one dish, so I really like that you can try a bit of everything. Unlike some tapas places, I found the value to be really good for the price.  Service was super friendly and attentive. There is a self-serve table with sauces, which is nice. The atmosphere is bright and comfortable. I would definitely visit again to try more items on the menu."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a new venture of the hip Filipino restaurant Lamesa. Different from the Lamesa, at this spot you would seat yourself and order at the counter. Water and utensils are both self-served. Kind of like Wvrst and Wilbur Mexicana on King Street.   The decor inside was  modern with traditional Filipino elements, accented with bold colours. We ordered a Filipino Fried Chicken, a Oxtail Stew and an Eggplant side dish. The food came out pretty quickly. The Fried Chicken was definitely the highlight. The skin was crispy and flavourful, and meat is tender and juicy. One of the best I've ever had! The Oxtail Stew was intended for 2 people. You can tell they removed extra fat on the tail, which was good. It was flavourful but the dish seemed a bit under seasoned. The vegetables in the stew could also be cooked for a bit longer to my taste. Also for $18, the stew doesn't come with any side dishes or even rice, that's kind of surprising. We had to order a side of rice. The grilled eggplant was tasty, but for $7 it's a bit pricy. It's tiny.   Overall, I think the flavour was good but the price we pay (especially considering it's self-served and it's not in the downtown core but on St Clair) is a bit too high. We ended up spending $45 after tax for two people. We would be happier if it's around $30 for we got.   P.S. we went in on a cold winter day (0 degree), the restaurant was a bit freezing. We had to wear our winter jackets during the whole meal, and the dish turned cold quickly..."}
{"text":"Lasa by Lamesa serves authentic Filipino food. The restaurant has a minimalist design. It seems more like a cafeteria than a restaurant. There's a takeout counter where you order your food. Service is minimal as well. The restaurant is designed for you to serve yourself.   The food was quite good. The shrimp curry and spring rolls were my favourite.  The shrimp curry is prepared in a delicate coconut-miso broth which creates the rich flavours. I also enjoyed the bbq pork skewers which I understand is a top-selling menu item.   The prices were reasonable. I would recommend this place if you are craving Filipino food in a casual setting."}
{"text":"Modern rustic feel, cafeteria style, 3 godlike dishes are how I would describe Lasa in short bursts. Filipino food used to be new to me in the past when it was super unknown to me and now it seems to be all the rage these days in foodie scenes (new Filipino restos popping up and all) I really do believe there is a lot to discover with this type of cuisine and I highly recommend Lasa as a starting point.  Lasa is casual but the food really shines. They divide the food in separate categories: fried/vegetables/main etc. We ordered the kare kare with oxtail stew, fresh lumpia, and fried chicken. The kare kare was a first for me, but I've heard many things about it and to me it was  so tasty. It's definitely not for the faint-hearted. It's got this very bold and pungent taste (it has peanut butter in it...I know!), but personally I loved it. The oxtail was super tender, probably braised/cooked for long hours, and everything about it was just powerful. I think it definitely could be one of those you either hate it or love it dishes.   Next! Fresh lumpia, almost like a Filipino version of a spring roll minus the protein. The outside was made of ube crepe, which I didn't think would work, but it did! It was sweet but filled with fresh vegetables that somehow had a nice crunch and fantastic flavor to it. Fried chicken was also a winner for me. I have no idea what they flavored the batter with, but this is not like any other fried chicken you will taste. It had its own unique seasoning to it.  Honestly, there were so many other dishes I really wanted to try, so I will have to come back! Definitely recommend anybody wanting to try Filipino food to check this place out. Also very affordable!"}
{"text":"traditional filipino food done well.simple,palatable and not pretentious.we ordered the sinigang,pork bbq,lechon kawali and fried chicken and every dish was spot on,brought memories back from my childhood.decor is minimalistic and quaint.service was also very solid."}
{"text":"Went here today for lunch and loved it! I ordered the Bangus sisig and it was BURSTING with flavor. It came with a raw egg on top that quickly cooked once I mixed it up with everything else on the sizzling skillet. I couldn't finish it all because I wanted to save room for dessert and now, I am looking forward to leftovers! I ordered the Halo Halo for dessert. It said it came with ube flan but I didn't see it in there... However, I loved it, minus the plantain, but that's a matter of taste. I like fried plantain but the texture of the plantain didn't do it for me in the dessert. I will definitely be back to try more dishes!"}
{"text":"[23/100]  Frankly, when I travel, I am more compelled by natural wonders & architecture. Los Angeles has a diverse food culture that satisfies my curiosity at all times, which results in a low drive to become a traveling foodie. I normally visit a local Trader Joe's and purchase trail mix, fresh fruits, protein bars & water. Food is fuel not indulgence when I travel.   Lasa by Lamesa was a rare exception! As soon as I discovered it's existence, I bookmarked it on Yelp, typed it onto my itinerary and followed them on Instagram.   Super easy to find, it's located at a building sectioned off into 3 or 4 other businesses. Parking was plenty! There were both residential, street and lot parking. All are metered aside from residential; however, it might be permit only. Watch out for signs, you are not immune to a parking ticket!   Aesthetic: Minimal, clean, wooden floors, bright, modern, & patterns. One of the plus is the place is spacious, but limited in seating. There are tables good for groups and bar tables great for one or two people. They have plants on the table which is a great touch. They have a bar table facing the window that leads to the street, great for people watching! Their utensils, condiments, & drinks are self serve.   Service/staff: There was a large group on my visit that had the Chef and staff a little flustered but I understand given that they were understaffed. There were two older gentlemen that were very focused on their tasks and may not be use to multitasking. I stood at the registered for a good 3 minutes before the Chef took my order. I placed my order and it didn't take too long and the Chef was very professional. I could tell he was stressed but he did great!   Food: I ordered the Lumpiang Sariwa (Fresh Lumpia) with the ube wrapper. It was delicious! I should have order 2 more, to go! The veggies were fresh and cooked well. The sauce wasn't too sweet and there was some on the side, just in case I wanted to drizzle on some more. The wrapper was thick and stood against the veggies! I really like that! And the ube was subtle which I appreciated because ube is mostly used for desserts and not savory. It was filling and that's probably why I didn't order another one.   Overall, the only improvement I would advise is staffing. The Chef and staff want to do well and get everything out in a timely matter which is appreciate but the stress is definitely apparent. Other than that, this place is great and they are bringing forth delicious Filipino food!"}
{"text":"I had bookmarked Lasa by Lamesa for a while now but finally tried it out with my hubby. Based on some previous reviews, I was expecting food to be ordered cafeteria style, where you point to prepared foods, but was pleasantly surprised to order at the counter from a menu. The food was ready very quickly so it likely was ready prepared and plated to order.   We ordered the fresh lumpia with the anticipation of the fresh ube-flavoured wrapper. This was plated nicely but for me the ube flavour was lost under the peanuts, sweet sauce, fresh vegetables and very cold temperature of the lumpia. I guess I was also looking for the garlicky kick in the sauce that I've come to expect from my family's fresh lumpia sauce but alas this was not my family's fresh lumpia.   We ordered the bangus (milkfish) as our protein with the silog (fried garlic rice) combo. The bangus , pork BBQ skewers, and garlic rice were delicious. Eager to try more menu items, we subsequently ordered the lechon kawali, which was at least served warm. The lechon was pretty good, served mostly crispy but some pieces were on the chewy side. Again good, but not the best I've ever had.  I like the look and feel of Lasa. Non pretentious, clean, seat yourself kind of place where you grab your own cutlery and wooden plates and plastic glasses. I hope they do well. I would return as I want to try their kare kare, fried chicken, and chicken inasal. 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"I didn't know it's a fast food restaurant before I came in. We gotta grab the menu, the water and cutlery ourselves. We ordered Kare kare and fried chicken. The food looks good. They don't taste so great. The kare kare is $18 and it doesn't come with rice. It tastes really bland. Except the peanut sauce, I can't taste anything else. The stew tastes like the sauce comes from the one you can get from the super market. The fried chicken is very bland too. And it doesn't taste fresh at all. I'd say I'd enjoy Popeyes more. The environment in the restaurant is nice and it has pretty decorations. But it is definitely not a place I'd go back for the food."}
{"text":"The first place I ate at in Toronto while visiting from the U.S! I got the vegetable lumpia and the fried chicken. Coming from the south I had no idea what to expect, but the chicken was incredible. I'm not sure what the flavoring on it was, kind of like a tangy sauce, but it was so good! Definitely recommend! The lumpia was also really good! The people were very friendly and accommodating :)"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery of pancit and pork rib singing ... omg the portions were so small .. no utensils .. not even a choice to order rice with our food .. sinigang was tasty and fresh"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed The food here. Nice clean place very bright and friendly staff. I had the Lumpia and chicken adobo as well as pork BBQ. We also had the pancit with chicken. It was good but we really didn't need the chicken  I'll for sure go back Yum. Yum"}
{"text":"We ubered to this place and my companion (aka my boyfriend) was taken aback by the \"cafeteria style\". Only because his expectation was to be seated, given a menu and order, restaurant style. We waited about 8 minutes in line to order which we didn't mind at all because we were trying to decide what to order. We then sat ourselves and waited for them to call our name.  We ordered: Lumpiang Shanghai Bangus Inihaw na pusit Adobo Kare kare With Garlic rice Halo halo for desert  The Food: Their portions are very generous and they come with fresh greens. The food is absolutely delicious and authentic Filipino. The prices are very reasonable. We loved everything and want to come back to try more dishes.  The Place: The place has nice tropical decorations with wooden lanterns and wooden benches. It has an airy and chill vibe, white and clean.  They close pretty early, 8pm so come as early as you could! We will definitely go back and we cannot wait."}
{"text":"Walking into Lasa was refreshing. Most dinnertime restaurants have their light set so low, but Lasa was bright, modern and had character in its decor. I thought their menu represented that vibe as well.  We shared a couple dishes: - Vegetable Lumpia - What you would expect is a typical spring roll, fried, a tad greasy and its fillings to be indiscernible in taste and texture from all the frying. Well, its time to have higher standards for spring rolls because Lasa has set the bar. The chili vinegar that's available on the side counter is a good compliment to the lumpia, adds some great spice. - Special of the Day - Noodle soup with bok choy, pork belly and chicken - The broth was warming and subtle in flavor, debatably, bland... But its subtlenss actually complimented the strong flavors of the pork belly and chicken in the soup. The chicken was a little charred such that its slight smokey flavor and crispy edges provided good contrast to the subtle broth. Likewise, the pork belly was well fried, but not greasy and was a good contrast ingredient to the rest of the bowl. The longer you left it in there uneaten, the longer it would soak in the broth goodness. The bok choy brought the noodle soup back down as a good cleansing ingredient to the jam-packed-in-flavor chicken and pork belly. - Lasa salad - Surprisingly fresh, filling and bursting with lots of flavor.   Overall, such a warming experience for the belly. Try it, your belly with thank you later."}
{"text":"Lasa is one or those places where you order at the counter, eat at a table, and clean up your dishes before you leave. It's a small-ish, cozy place with wooden bowls and self-serving utensils. We ordered garlic rice, fried pork belly, vegetable lumpia, milkfish, and grilled chicken thighs.  The garlic rice was basically garlic + rice. It was not something a restaurant commonly offers and so we ordered it. Nothing too special, and if you're a fan of steamed white rice, you're not missing out if you don't get it. Otherwise, give it a try.  The skin part of the fried pork belly was way too hard. I'm not sure if it was meant to be like that or if we just had a batch with very tough and crunchy skin. Personally, I found it to be too much. The meat part, however, was very good. Juicy. And the fat that is supposed to be oily in the pork belly was not overly oily.  The vegetable lumpia was essentially a vegetable spring rolls. It was ok. Loved the sauce that came with it so much that I ate the fried pork belly with the sauce.  The milkfish was alright. It would have been so much better if we were given some sauce with it and if it were more juicy.  The grilled chicken was seasoned very well. Loved the tenderness of the meat and the sauce, which had a citric taste to it. Would recommend ordering this.  Tl;dr: Overall, it was a nice experience. My criticisms were the overly hard skin of the fried pork belly, and the lack of sauce for the pork belly and milkfish. The grilled chicken was great, and the garlic rice was nothing special."}
{"text":"I found out about this place because I liked Lamesa on Queen St.  This place is a bit more traditional Filipino than Lamesa, and the prices are a better deal!  The interior is very clean and homey, it has a more casual feel. Food is consistently great - I love the Bangus with their delicious vinegar sauce, the Chicken Adobo is also great!"}
{"text":"The food was very delish. The restaurant itself was colourful and very welcoming. The server was friendly and explained the dishes to us. The meal was super tasty and just felt homey. We got the $12 dinners which was a good portion of food. Will go back again!"}
{"text":"Loved it! The fresh lumpia and ube flan was delicious! The bbq pork skewers were flavourful, but some parts were very fatty. The fried pork belly was flavourful, but a bit dry.   Definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Good Filipino food with a home-cooked feel. Much more traditional than Lamesa (which is really more re-imagined upscale fusion Filipino food), Lasa offers the typical dishes you'd find if you stopped by and had a family meal in any Filipino home. Our favourites were the silogs (we had the chicken, pork barbeque, fish and tofu versions, all paired with egg, rice and some veggies) which were well cooked, had generous servings and good value for money ($12 for each silog!). The desserts were also interesting - ube flan with pinipig had a nice crunch, while the ice cream scoops were from a local brand (we got the mango flavour - and if you've ever been to the Philippines, you know it has the best mangoes in the world!). Overall, would recommend going to Lasa if you want at taste of the simple and traditional Filipino meal."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and really enjoyed it! I eat a lot of different Asian cuisines but had yet to try Filipino food until I came here. We ordered fresh lumpia (1), two bbq pork skewers, the chicken adobo and the roast bistek for a group of four - we asked the cashier for recommendations on portion size and her suggestions were perfect! The chicken adobo was the real standout dish for all of us - perfectly fried and juicy chicken thighs with a crisp exterior and a savory sauce with a light touch of sweetness. The roast bistek was tender and lightly crisped as well. The lumpia was fresh and a great compliment to the heavier dishes. The bbq pork skewers were okay - tasty, but not outstanding or unique. Good portion size though! While I can't speak for how authentic it is, I think this is a delicious and affordable lunch if you're in the neighborhood and well worth trying."}
{"text":"I thought it was a cool concept where you would seat yourself and then order at the counter or vice-versa. Food was delicious! Their adobo chicken rice platter was bomb and as always, I got the lumpia which was so crispy and delicious."}
{"text":"Ordered  pork bbq skewers at $2.50 each. Take-out. Meat was hard to chew. Flavour was not well entrenched into the meat.  Just another restaurant trying to make a living; it is not gourmet/chef-material. Nothing wrong with that.  Rent is expensive around its vicinity hence  the steep prices of their offerings and NOT at all representative of either the quality or taste of the food being served."}
{"text":"I grew up with plenty of Filipino friends in Scarborough and toronto and I've always wondered why I've never seen or tried Filipino cuisine outside of friends' places when I'd go over and hang out.   Now years later, with the proliferation of restaurants of all stripes and colours, a quaint little Filipino restaurant blossomed out in my hood of Hillcrest.   I've been meaning to try it for a while and now, a couple of months after I stumbled across it, on a crisp fall afternoon I finally decided to pay a visit.  And I was NOT disappointed! I ordered their fried chicken platter which included 3 pieces of scrumptious lightly battered chicken thighs that had a nice tangy zest, sprinkled with scallions.  The combo came with a garden salad and garlic infused fried rice and a fried egg on top.  This was my first visit - but I will definitely be coming back to try more dishes!"}
{"text":"Everything was sooo tasty. Lumpia tasted sooo good. We also had the Bangus (if you like fried fish), Fried Chicken and the Oxtail stew (super tender). I want to eat the whole menu like everyday."}
{"text":"Their food is out-of-this-world good, full stop, and plentiful too. I can't think of anywhere else in Toronto I've eaten this fabulously at this price point, other than the doubles at Caribbean Roti Palace. We feasted on the chicken adobo, which was four pieces of pure heaven. I could have eaten fourteen. The Shanghai lumpia (6) were delicious, came with a great vinegary dipping sauce, and were very generously portioned for a $6 appetizer. The pancit came with a precious little yellow-green calamansi lime sliced in half to squeeze on top. We got more chicken on top, which melted in my mouth a lot like the adobo had. The noodles and toppings were a bit fancier than what I've made at home, tossed with artful sprigs of greens and long strips of lightly charred cabbage. It had all the crunch, rich oiliness, and tang that you hope for in great pancit. With tax and tip we paid $20 each for a lot of food.   Even the little things were great - a bowl of garlic rice we tacked on as a side dish was so, so garlicky in the best way, and quite large.   I am already strategizing excuses to come up to St. Clair to eat here repeatedly. Oh, and their space is super cute, spacious, airy, bright and soothing. They do orders at a counter and deliver to the table. Seating for 16 at four tables and for 8 more at counters."}
{"text":"The place is well decorated. The food is even more pleasing to the eyes. We ordered couple of dishes to try things out as we are visiting the area. I got excited because they have chicken inasal. Here's my opinion on the food. As the food is presented so well. They look so amazing! Pictures are attached to this review. The Veggie Lumpia is really good and so is the crispy tofu. Fried bangus is hard to mess up since that is fried. And this place fried that bangus right. pork bbq is alright. Now the chicken inasal was disappointing. We all didn't like it. Most of oue kids didn't finish it. It was not the inasal taste I was expecting the marinade doesn't really go well.  I would have given the inasal 2 stars. But other food was fine and would not pull down the rating for one dish."}
{"text":"Great Filipino food done here in the city of Toronto. I haven't had the chance to eat at the sister restaurant, but I'm glad I got to get my eat on here at least. This is definitely up there in terms of Filipino restaurants in North America, and I'm happy to support my generation of chefs and restauranteurs.  You must eat these... The kare-kare. Slammin'. The sinigang. Delicious, and packed with the goods. Lumpia. Plump and perfect.  On the fence about... The fried chicken. The skin is karate kick to your face good, but I thought the meat was a bit underseasoned.  Pass on the... Ginataan. Not really what I expected when it comes to squash/pumpkin done Filipino style. And talong inihaw. Didn't really think the sweet black bean meshed well with barbecued eggplant.  Definitely a must-go spot for me and wifey."}
{"text":"I called last March 27, 2018 at 7:06pm to very if they're open on Good Friday, March 30th which is a statutory holiday. A girl answered and confirmed they're open.   I called again on March 28, 2018 at 7:17pm to confirm if they're open that Good Friday and staff confirmed they are open during regular hours.   On March 30th as me and my friends reached their restaurant, there's a sign that says they're closed. I am so disappointed that despite two phone calls confirming they are open, they are actually not! How can they be so disorganized with hours of operation? I am not recommending this restaurant at all."}
{"text":"I originally requested a group reservation at Lamesa's but they couldn't accommodate us. They did offer a private seating at Lasa. They sent over different prix fixed menu options. Price pp was $35-50 pp depending on the menu. I booked a private Kamayan dinner for 18 of us on a Friday. It's a cute place, small, so seating was split but we had the whole place for ourselves so it was super cozy and fun. Confirming our booking was a slight challenge but  Les was very accommodating and a great host. We had a couple vegetarians and various allergies they were able to accommodate. The servers and chefs were awesome. Most of us are not Filipino and this was the first taste of Filipino food. Each item plated was explained. The presentation was nice and  the kamayan experience was cool, you eat with your hands off banana leaves. Overall super fun evening!"}
{"text":"Lasa by Lamesa is a casual cafeteria-like restaurant. You order at the counter, grab a seat, then wait for your name to be called to pick up your food.  Despite being such a casual place, the food here is excellent, and prices are quite reasonable.  I highly recommend the ox tail kare kare if you are sharing it with a friend (big portion). The skewer with rice dishes are perfect for solo diners.  Recommended!"}
{"text":"Decided to go here because I was craving Filipino food plus I wanted to let my friend try this cuisine since she hsd never had it before. The decor was really simple yet romantic and cozy. Everything here is self-serve which is a nice touch from the usual wait staff. We were not disappointed in the price and taste and the portions were big enough to share. It honestly tasted home cooked. Here's a list of what we got:  Lumpia shanghai (pork springrolls) - came with 6 rolls and they were fresh and the dipping sauce really pulled together the savoury flavour of the dish  Combo meal with pork skewers - amazing flavours! There were 2 skewers and the pork was well done - cooked but not dry, it was still tender and juicy. And everything went to well together. This dish csme with salad, 2 eggs, and garlic rice. I thought the rice was a bit dry for my liking  Adobo chicken - came with 4 pieces of chicken. The sauce was a bit salty but it went well with the rice that we had already. The chicken was tender and there was flavour in every bite. I liked the fact that they had pieces of red chilli which gave it a nice kick.  Ube flan - thicker than flan consistency but the ube flavour really pulled through. The purple colour really stood out on its own but when it was served with crunchy granola it was really eye popping! The granola gave it a nice crunch which was fun to eat"}
{"text":"My first official taste of a Filipino restaurant in Toronto and I will say that Lasa is a great one.  Highly flavourful, well cooked, and very affordable ... what's not to love?  This small fast casual place has a cute but sparse dining room.  The flavours here are the opposite ... it delivers bold flavours that makes you want to try more dishes.  It is a counter cafeteria style ordering where they call your name when everything is ready.  The dining area is small... maybe 4 tables of 4 seating and two sets of bar seating.  So I cannot imagine this place during the busy dining hours.  We came early at 5 pm Saturday and all the tables were taken but the bar seating is available.  When we first arrived, a friendly and helpful woman greeted us quickly.  We knew we had to get the Lumpia Shanghai and Fresh Lumpia.  Sadly they were all out of the Fresh ones already! With her help, we also ordered the fried chicken, Lasa salad, garlic rice, and a juice.  She mentioned it's enough for the two of us ... let's just say we ended up taking two take out boxes back with us!  A great amount of food for $40!  We sat down at a table and noticed it had a tad bit of food left from the previous patrons.  A quick wipe and grabbing a few extra plates and we were ready for our meal.  The great thing was that our order did not take long ... definitely under 10 minutes.  They called our name and the tray was bursting with plates.  We definitely ordered too much.  Lumpia Shanghai - fried pipping hot and filled with flavourful pork.  The vinegary fish sauce dipping sauce was a nice contrast to the Lumpia.  The edges were crispy and we got 6 rolls for $6.  Great value ... one slight comment, the central part of the roll wasn't crispy.  Not sure if they didn't fry long enough or lower temperature.  4/5  Lasa Salad - lots of good veggies ... avocado, squash, tomato, cashews, daikon, carrot, tofu, and leaves.  I'm a salad eater so I liked this.  The tofu had a very interesting pungent flavour which I didn't  mind.  My dining partner was a little one and she wrinkled her nose ... it's a bit strong and different plus the skin was soggy so it just threw her off.  It is a bit higher priced ($13) but still good. 4/5  Fried Chicken - Wow ... loved this.  I have no idea what they put into this but the crackly crispy skin is full on flavour and the chicken was so tender and moist.  I loved adding pieces of this to my salads and made for a great meal.  You get 4 large piping hot thigh pieces.  It is a tiny tad greasy but it's a minor comment to how incredible it tasted and crunched.  4.5/5  Garlic rice - for $2 you get a big bowl of it that can feed 2 people easily.  Grab your breath mint cause they were joking on the garlic ... I loved it. The flavour was potently garlicky in a good way and was great to mix in with the fried chicken.  I really liked this place ... incredible value for a very filling and flavourful meal.  If they just had the fresh Lumpia available, maybe a touch cleaner, tweaked their fried Lumpia to be crispier... this would be a perfect 5.  That shouldn't take away from the fact it was a great meal and a wonderful introduction to Filipino food for me.  Definitely recommend this place to try and order the chicken for sure!"}
{"text":"Super cute aesthetic. Clean environment and helpful friendly staff. Food  could be a little more flavorful, nothing thy quite blew me away. However super clean and presentable"}
{"text":"Heard about Lasa by Lamesa from some friends of mine and decided to check it out tonight. The food was delicious, the restaurant well designed, and the staff was friendly and knowledgeable. Had a chance to chat with Chef Aaron and you can just feel the passion he has for his culinary creations!   Highly recommend this restaurant for anyone who wants to try a taste of the Philippines!"}
{"text":"Kamusta Filipino food!!! I haven't had it in years and my wife has never tried it before. One episode of street food in Philippines on YouTube later found  this little gem.  Side note: we REALLY wanted the halo halo but they don't make it in the winter *sad face* Order: adobo chicken, fresh lumpia and garlic rice.  Verdict: adobo chicken came with 4 pieces of delicious and well seasoned chicken in a sweet, garlicy and tangy sauce. The fresh lumpia was loaded with crispy veggies and covered in some sort of purple crepe. I am to understand that this was made with purple yam. Whatever it's was, we loved it. Lastly, that garlic rice had so much flavor to it. Garlic is sexy.  There are a few sauces on the side counter like hot sauce, vinegar, fish sauce and soy which you get to help yourself to and you should.  Go here.... it's goood"}
{"text":"I went with my partner after hearing so many positive reviews about this place. I even read about how they decorated the restaurant with unique stained wood pieces of the Filipino flag and the hats that served as lights. I've also tried Lamesa, the more upscale sister of Lasa by the same owner, for Winterlicious and I am so impressed with the fusion style of bringing Filipino food to the mainstream.   We ordered the Kare-Kare ($18), the Mami ($10), Fried Garlic Rice ($2), and two skewers of the BBQ pork ($2.50 each). There was more than enough for two people and I even had left overs for the next day.   The food servings were very generous and the food was very tasty. The kare-kare was cooked perfectly and the Mami came with generous helpings of chicken and pork belly (Lechon). The Mami was an awesome deal with slurpy helpings of noodles. The BBQ port skewers were marinated succulently and the grill flavour was such a treat in the cold weather. The best part of the meal were the beautiful clay pots and the wooden bowls and plates that added to the ambience and the feel of eating authentic Filipino food. Although it was a self-serve style, I really felt the food was made with such creativity and care. Delicious, tasty, totally filling and just made with so much attention to detail.   I will totally come back and try more of the other dishes, particularly the Fried Chicken and when they have more of the desserts such as the Ube leche flan. There were a lot of passer-by's peering in and were curious but maybe pictures of the food would help them actually go in and try them! Just some marketing might help with the familiarity of the food :)"}
