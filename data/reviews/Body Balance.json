{"text":"I had a pre-wedding day the Saturday before the wedding & the day of. All of the ladies were amazing & I loved the ambiance! They did an amazing job on my hair, makeup & nails. I got so many compliments at the wedding & all guests asked where I had my hair done. I would recommend a pre-wedding consult & services in general. Great facility & service!!!"}
{"text":"Everyone was so kind and the place is so peaceful as soon as you walk in you notice a good environment. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Very happy with my experience. The ambiance is awesome!  Very relaxing, well decorated and clean! Lisa did my hair, we did heavy highlights and a cut (9-10 inches off!), and she did a great job! I've recieved many compliments on my hair. She is very knowledgable and listens to what you want, and takes her time to make sure its done right. I had been looking for a new hair stylist (recently moved to Kings Mountain) and this place was perfect! The prices are good too, which is one of the main reasons I picked this place. I will be going back (for hair & mani/pedi's), she definitely gained me as a long term customer! I may even try one of their massages sometime! this place has it ALL!"}
{"text":"I love Body Balance Day Spa and Salon!  It is THE place I trust to have pedicures and other services done.  I have no worries that everything will be clean and sanitized.  The atmosphere is always relaxing and everyone on staff is an expert at their craft(s). I also love that they have health, beauty and gift (jewelry/candles/accessories) items for sale Wouldn't go anywhere else!"}
{"text":"I called at 12:04 today to see if I could get in for a massage before 1pm because I had the WORST knot in my neck.  They got me in right away.  Literally, right away.  I never even knew they were hidden over there off Franklin, but it is such a cute and clean place. (which means a lot to this clean freak)  Totally comfortable atmosphere.  I am so happy I found them!  I can't remember the name of the one who gave me the massage (sorry, it was hard to hear anything over the screaming PAIN IN MY NECK... :-D) but she was AMAZING.  She spent time focusing on the problem but didn't leave out the rest of my neck and back either.  She helped relieve it and loosen it up.  It was a great experience.  I will definitely be back and will definitely tell everyone else about this great little place I found! :-D  THANK YOU!"}
{"text":"Had the half day package for anniversary present.  Hour massage, facial, manicure and pedicur.  Excellent.  I have not complaints.  Very nice.  Caters to their clients.  Will be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved the massage with Becky. This was a much needed relaxing afternoon and I will be returning. Body Balance is a hidden gem of Gastonia! If you are in need of some relaxation, make this your one-stop shop!"}
{"text":"I was long overdue and in considerable pain when I arrived. I had a very deep tissue massage and expected to be in pain afterwards however because of the coconut water drops that were sold in her gift shop area, I experienced no pain whatsoever only considerable relief. The best part was how easy it was to get an appointment."}
{"text":"I wouldn't never guessed this place was as nice as it was. Tucked away in the back of a building is a hidden gem. I had the aromatherapy facial which was wonderful!  If I loved closer I'd come here more often!"}
{"text":"I work in a salon and spa but I like to go try other places to get a spa experience outside of where I work.  I have to admit it is very nice.  I've been three times now for massages and no complaints! As long as the service and experience stays the same I will keep returning!"}
{"text":"Once inside, you quickly forget you are in Gastonia.  Once  you spend a day, an hour, a drive by for a smoothie, you will be a fan.  The ambiance is soothing.  Earth tones, running water, flutes. good product.   Cheerful, competent, happy people there to make you happy.  I have walked in growling and led out purring,  The owner, Monica, is an amazing masseuse and if you can get on her schedule, consider it Christmas.  My only complaint is that she can't be cloned!  Prices are reasonable and Get on their mailing list.  Great specials pop up all the time.  If in Gastonia and you need some TLC, go."}
{"text":"I was referred to Body Balance by my mother, who had been a long time client. I began using the spa after moving to the area and also took my family there. I've also referred other friends and extended family there. We've used most of their services, massages, pedicures, waxing, hair styling, and facials. All of the ladies who actually perform the services have been wonderful. The spa is very nice and relaxing. However, recently scheduling became a major issue for us. Appointments that were booked at specific times, were suddenly not available at the times scheduled or were no longer with the people requested. Scheduling appointments over the phone became next to impossible as the receptionists weren't able to either understand or complete what was requested. When speaking with the manager at one point, she was very helpful and apologetic, even suggesting that from then on I speak only to her to schedule appointments. However, upon leaving a later message for her, it was never returned (I strongly doubt she received it). My mother also expressed concern in person at an appointment and was blown off. I was sad to learn that we really weren't valued as clients after all, as we did enjoy going there."}
