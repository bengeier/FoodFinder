{"text":"A friend assured me this was \"life-changing pasta\" - well, I don't know if my life has CHANGED so much, but it is certainly richer for knowing about this hidden gem.  We split two different pasta dishes (the tortellini and the baked ziti) and two salads and a cannoli, and the experience was top-notch at every level.  The food is simple in terms of recipes, flavor profiles, etc., but simply exquisitely executed.  Service is a tad slow compared to other places but this is clearly not a \"turn the tables\" sort of operation - enjoy the time and atmosphere.  We didn't have a reservation so we were in the bar area near a very talented musician who delicately played well-known songs just below the level of conversation (as well as a couple of \"Happy birthdays\" for two people having their special day).  The owners checked in with our table several different times.  This is a place that is well-run with tremendous love and care.  It's a tad on the pricey compared to some other places - just a tad - but still a bargain, as I'd expect to pay twice as much in LA or NY and be just as satisfied.  Go!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Ambiance - cannot ask for a more wonderful environment.
Service - top-notch!  We were all seated a bit before the restaurant even opened up.  We were attended to as if we were \"special\" guests.  Having grown up working at my family's resort in the borscht belt (Think \"Dirty Dancing\"), we all know what it means to have great service and that's what we got.
Food - We tried the mussels, which were some of the best we have ever had. Plump, perfectly cooked, large, and a garlic wine sauce you will want to soak up with the bread. Salmon was cooked slightly too much for this med-rare salmon-lover, but was scrumptious just the same. 
If one of these categories is lacking, it doesn't quite matter how good the other categories are: it takes all 3 to offer a great experience and you will get it here.  It is my new go-to restaurant"}
{"text":"Great service, great veal saltimbuca as recommended by our waiter, Larry was exceptional. Our first experience but definitely not our last. Ownership was visible and mingled with the clientele and were very welcoming. The restaurant was warm and comfortable."}
{"text":"L' Amore is always 5 star! An old school mom and pop Italian restaurant. Greg the owner seems to be there every shift and takes active roll in your dining experience. They use the  freshest ingredients and make everything from scratch!"}
{"text":"We decided to try this place based on the Yelp reviews and were thrilled we did so. We started with the grilled vegetable platter which had asparagus, broccoli, cauliflower, red peppers, artichoke, mushrooms, caprese, kalamata olives, and tomato bruschetta. Amazing flavors. My husband had the halibut special which melted in his mouth. I had the cioppini spicy style which was top notch. We ended by sharing the tiramisu which a perfect ending to the meal. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"We gathered for a ladies holidays lunch. We were warmly greeted by the owner and waiter. I choose the tomato and artichoke soup. Incredibly smooth and flavorful and the artichokes are an amazing addition. 
One of the ladies asked for something special for her diet and they cooked it to perfection. I will definitely go back to try other items. And the atmosphere has a local hangout feeling that is comforting."}
{"text":"This was our anniversary, a special night.  We choose L'Amore partially for \"the Love\" we were celebrating.    Before we went my husband said he didn't want to use the coupon because he told me that coupons are never what they seem to be and owners don't give people with coupons the same courtesy.  He was right. 
  The food was wonderful!  Here is the problem.  We w ere the first guests in the dining room and with our reservations made the day before. We were seated at a table in an opening next to an area reserved for a company party that began with an hour of cocktails. Not very private or romantic. It was kind of like sitting next to the kitchen door in a restaurant.   As the private party progressed we could barely hear ourselves talk.  We mentioned this to our waitress, asked for a different table but was told the other tables were reserved \"for regulars.\" 
She was nice, polite and apologetic.  
Before ordering, when we gave the waitress our coupon, she explained that the coupon was not valid for the specials and neither did the drinks count towards the $50.00 we must spend to use the coupon.  That made sense.  But we were ordering during happy hour and assumed we would be getting happy hour drink prices even though they would not count against the $50.00 minimum.  This was not the case. 

The owner  was less than kind.   He was close to rude.  His attitude towards us using the coupon was insulting.  He never made any attempt throughout the evening to come to our table and see how we were doing, nor to apologize/offer to comp our drinks for the horrible noisy table experience.  We know the waitress mentioned it to him early in the evening.  His response was \"normally the party doesn't stand and talk so long.\"  So I guess by the owner it was the party patrons fault that we had a bad experience.  To illustrate our point on the noise,  after our appetizers, while we were having our main course, a table was seated near us, by the party as well.  After 10 minutes they got up and went into the bar to sit where there was live music that was quieter than the party.   I guess the owner is content with his regulars coming in and doesn't value new business potential.  We are disappointed in his attitude and recommend that he stop offering coupons because it doe not fit into his business plan and method of operation.  
In the end I guess you get what you pay for.  If we had paid full price my husband would have been more insistent on being treated like a patron dining in a fine restaurant, with his lovely wife, on what was supposed to be a romantic quiet evening."}
{"text":"Awesome owners. Incredible, attentive service my glass never got empty and the food was ridiculous this place does it right!"}
{"text":"Last night L'amore severed 12 of us and dinning experience was great!
The food ...the service ...and the ambiance ...all worked without and snags. Greg, the owner is a warm, service oriented host that makes sure all went well. This is not a high priced restaurant ...the wine list offers some very good, reasonably priced vino that works well with the very good Italian cuisine. I know...a first generation Sicilian, who's family owned Italian Restaurants in over a 30 period. Sam Nocifera"}
{"text":"We have been looking for the \"right\" Italian Restaurant for some time, you know, the kind of place you feel comfortable in. The place where you can bring friends and feel like you know someone, kinda like Cheers. I believe this is it!
Our waiter looked familiar...he worked at a place 20 years ago that was the type of place I have been trying to find since they closed. What a great reunion.
The food was EXCELLENT, service GREAT, The people who work there are Friendly and nice.
     What more could you want?"}
{"text":"On a Wednesday night with a reservation and about 1/2 - 2/3 of the tables occupied, we waited about 5 minutes at the hostess station before being noticed and seated.  We then waited another 10 minutes before being given menus. (The busboy did bring us bread and water while we waited and our water glasses were never more the 1/2 empty the whole night.)  After sitting for 5 minutes or so with the menus the waiter stopped by, asked if we wanted wine, and when we told him no we were just drinking water, he turned and left.  He finally came back a few minutes later and took our order.  

The food came out within a normal time period and was outstanding, the highlight and saving grace of the evening.  Caprese salad was delicious served with a pile of cold crisp spinach and the eggplant parm was easily the best I have ever had.  

We ordered a desert to share and I ordered a cup of coffee.  It wasn't until I was 1/2 way through the cup that I noticed a long string of, I think some kind of dried pieced of lettuce or other kind of produce, stuck to the inside of the cup.  (In the dimmed lights I had noticed it and thought it was a highlight design in the china.)  When asked if I wanted a refill, I pointed it out and politely declined, asking for the check instead.  (the waiter did deduct the coffee from the bill.). 

Lastly, entrees were listed as including soup or salad.  When we were not asked our preference upon ordering our meal, we assumed it was because we had ordered a caprese salad to share.  When the bill arrived, we were charged for the caprese salad so realized we should have asked  what kind of soup was being offered with the meal.  

Manager or owner, not sure which, was working the room and made us feel welcome even apologizing for the initial wait at the door.  Busboy was definitely on top of keeping our water filled and clearing our dishes in a timely manner.  Food was absolutely amazing.  If only the over all service had been better and had they caught the 2 inch piece of dried food in my coffee cup, we would have given 5 stars."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favs! The fish is always fresh, and the warm crusty bread just can't be turned down.
If you are lucky enough to catch a crab cake special, you will not be disappointed! Sea Bass Picatta is the best ever and the chix parm and asian chix salad are delicious menu staples.
One of my favorite happy hr places too!
If I am not super hungry, I often just grab a meatball, bread and a glass of wine. How can u go wrong with fresh basil and garlic?'"}
{"text":"Service would normally be better here, but our server was either a bit confused or couldn't hear us? We had some problems communicating with him sometimes.

The mussels were good, and the desserts we had were good as well.

The seafood salad was very bland, and the cioppino was just okay.

All in all, we wouldn't jump to return."}
{"text":"Service was fantastic and food was wonderful! Our waiter, Sal, was attentive and more than helpful. The owners came by our table and checked on us twice. If we did not live out of town, we would make it a weekly spot for dinner."}
{"text":"It's rare to go to a restaurant where you are not only remembered, but treated like family.  Whether it's for a date night or a client lunch, L' Amore is my go to spot for meals that matter.  Delicious food, good prices and UNBELIEVABLE service."}
{"text":"Came in for a few drinks with friends and stayed for appetizers and entrees!  Laura's menu recommendations at the bar were perfectly on point. Come with an appetite! The antipasto for two is a great start. Narrowing down an entree choice may prove difficult, so you will have to return. The 1/2 meatball with spaghetti is a delicious traditional start, while the blackened garlic shrimp and sausage is ready to delight a willing palate. Owner Kim is sure to stop by to add a kind, personal touch to the experience. Bring your friends and family, to be spoiled by theirs!"}
{"text":"Was in Phoenix on business and found this restaurant to be highly recommended. Went over with some business associates and the food was tremendous. Being from NYC I felt I knew good Italian food, but everything here was perfect. Our waiter \"Little Vic\" was a good time and the wine he recommended was delicious. Don't forget to try their linguini specialty of the house!"}
{"text":"Today was my husband's birthday and another friend's birthday, so we wives, along with another girlfriend, took our husbands to dinner tonight.  Greg, the owner, seated us and Charles, our waiter took care of us throughout the meal.  It was an AWESOME meal and a wonderful birthday celebration, with two birthday desserts for the 'birthday boys' that were added as 'compliments of the owner/chef'.  It was a superb touch to the evening.  The place was buzzing, yet the owner, Greg, took the time to check on us and visit a bit from time to time, and Charles was an incredible waiter.  This has become our new 'home away from home'.  We can't wait to go back and try the happy hour experience now.  Thank you, Greg, and thank you, Charles.  You are very much appreciated by Pam, Stepan, and guests."}
{"text":"This was amazing.  Friendly staff, great service and the food was unbelievable.  Truly felt welcomed.  Owners take great pride in providing you with a great experience.  Go Packers!"}
{"text":"Delicious! And best of all the most friendly staff I've ever encountered in a restaurant. The sea food was very fresh and  the man walking around checking on guests(Im assuming an owner or management) was very personable. From start to finish this experience was wonderful. Definitely recommend you stopping here."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for dinner last Friday and was really disappointed in the service! We are new in town from San Francisco, and I wanted to try a restaurant that was on Restaurant.com since I had some credit with them that I wanted to use up. 

First off, it states on the certificate that we needed to present the coupon before being seated...I mean, what does it matter since they were willing to participate in restaurant.com program, and people have already paid for these certs...why would it matter? In any event, we did and ordered. We had the bruschetta, I had linguine with clams, and my BF had the fillet mignon. My linguine came out with some clams on the shell, but it looked like they also dumped a can of clams in there as well to add clam quantity. I haven't seen that before. As for the fillet, it was overcooked.

When the bill came out, I wanted to pay for it using a $20 Open Table check that I had along with our credit card payment (you know how you can get cash for dining so many times using the open table reservations system). The owner guy comes back out and told us we can't use the open table check plus the restaurant.com offer to pay for dinner, even though they are part of both programs. I said okay, that's fine, but then he started telling us he can only honor the open table check and not the restaurant.com cert! That made no sense to me whatsoever. I could only use the restaurant.com cert at his restaurant, and could use the open table check anywhere so why would I want him to do that? We argued and he said he can't reverse the transaction, and I was so mad I said we weren't going to use the open table check regardless, whether he honors the restaurant cert or not. He then brought out the entire bill undiscounted with either! We just thought it was the worst dining experience ever, so just paid for the full amount, tipped the waitress her 20 percent since it wasn't her fault, and walked out leaving the paid for but unused cert behind since it's obvious we were never coming back there to dine again! Seriously, I've lived in SF for 20 years, and have never had such a bad dining experience. 

Sorry for the lengthy review, but just wanted to share the very disappointing experience we had at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Ate here many years ago and always had a good meal. Tonight we decided to go back and had high hopes. Started off with the calimarie and when it came out, there was almost no sauce with it. The salad was fine but too much dressing. I had the chicken piccatta and it was very oily and the sides were penne pasta with tomato sauce and some steamed carrots and broccoli. My wife had the halibut piccatta special that was very salty. Not really worth the money and the atmosphere was a senior citizen crowd."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about the food!  A-maz-ing.  Highly recommend if you are looking for some delicious Italian food.  The atmosphere is great too, not too loud which is a plus in the age of too many loud restaurants.  Definitely check this place out!!"}
{"text":"Our first Italian restaurant in Phoenix! We celebrated my husband's birthday eating out with a toddler and an infant during their happy hour. They have the crisp on the outer layer, warm in the inside kinda bread which is the best I've had in Phoenix! The calamari and carpaccio were delicious. Husband loved the mussels. The pizzas weren't my favorite, but the kiddo ate some. The owner was very sweet! He and the waitress were very accommodating to our toddler although the rest of the crowd was much older. It was a quick dinner out with the kids that turned out to be delicious!"}
{"text":"Authentic, delicious Italian home style food! Huge portions, incredible service and warm atmosphere. Owners and staff were warm, friendly and accommodating for our large group."}
{"text":"Thank you for a memorable evening of great people, delicious food, wonderful wine and being made to feel like we were old friends. Will definitely be back on our next trip."}
{"text":"Probably one of the cleanest restaurants I have been in. A great happy hour if you are there in time. The best fresh anchovies not even fishy . The bread is great , i had the veal which was wonderful. The owner and is wife were so sweet , great service. A must to try!!"}
{"text":"Looked at reviews and thought this was a good place to try. It was fabulous! The salad was tasty and the entrees were authentic and delicious!! Lasagna was A+."}
{"text":"Great food, wonderful restaurant.  Need to go! Must try!  Had the Black Garlic Shrimp and Sausage."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Great wine list and mouth watering desert. We are here two night in a row because it was so good the first night. The second night was even better. I think this might be the best restaurant I have been to in a long time. Good service and very friendly owners. Don't hesitate!"}
{"text":"Good food, nice atmosphere with live music. We went on a Saturday night. We made a reservation for 2 but when we got there, they couldn't seat us for another half hour. The owners graciously offered complimentary cocktails and profusely apologized.  It was not their fault that others showed up late for their reservations and messed the times for everyone else. After patiently waiting, our meal was worth the wait. The spaghetti bolognese and the lasagna were delicious! Then our dessert was sent over compliments of the owners. The customer service is superb and old fashioned. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The decor was outdated along with the menu and food.

A friend recommended it.  It's an average Italian restaurant with classic Italian food that you would expect at any average Italian restaurant.  They did not break out with new flavors. The quality was also average.  I will not be going back on my own free will."}
{"text":"We love L'Amore and dine here whenever we are in town! We had friends visiting and celebrated her birthday at L'Amore. As always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious! So glad to have been introduced to this beautiful and friendly restaurant a few years ago by our local Phoenix friends."}
{"text":"WOW!

This trip to Arizona has been spectacular for dining out. Last night was a great dinner at Sierra Bonita and tonight was L'amore.

I find these places to eat from my Alaska Airlines web site. They partner with several restaurants and when I travel I sometimes search out new places to eat.

I entertained a business client tonight and had a great meal.

The service was excellent, the owner Greg has a great personality. Ask him about his barnyard wine list that's not published. He recommended an off the wall wine called \"If you see kay\" (read it again slowly and you will get the double speak) It was very good and reasonably priced.

The food - Spectacular. I had the Cippino. It was loaded with seafood and I had them make it a little spicy. One of the best dishes I have ever had. The scallops were huge and tasty. I would order this time and time again. Everyone had a good meal. No complaints on anything.

We were there about 2 hours, no pressure to leave. They let you be and set your own pace. I loved it!"}
{"text":"I have been going to L'Amore for a few years now and each time I return I am reminded of how good it is. The food truly is good and I've never been disappointed with a dish. They usually have a halibut dish on the nightly specials and it's always cooked to perfection and has some to-die-for sauce on it. The baked ziti with sausage and ricotta is also a fave. And in this restaurant the service is just as good as the food. Greg the owner is always there and really takes pride in his restaurant. They also have a great happy hour that goes until 7:00 on weekdays with great food and drink specials. Live music most nights in the bar area and a lovely patio. Pure Italian bliss."}
{"text":"I'm only giving them the 2 stars because the food is actually pretty decent.  Not 5 star good, but maybe 4.

If you're planning to use a restaurant.com certificate, please read this first.  If you're planning to try to combine anything from happy hour with regular dinner prices, read this first.

Having said that . . .

I've been here a couple of times.  The service is hit or miss.  I will note that it seemed to impress the waiter when we were able to order without looking at the menu.  He became a little more attentive after that.

The big issue?  Well, it shouldn't have been an issue at all.

How many of you have ever used restaurant.com to try out a new place?  If you haven't, you may be missing out.  Or so I thought, until tonight.

I love restaurant.com because it gets me to try new places that I might never happen upon.  Let me say, here, that we eat out way too much and spend an embarrassing amount on restaurant food and drink.

But occasionally, I pull the \"coupon card\" and get my husband to try some place out of his comfort zone.  This was one of those occasions.

My general rule is that when I find a place on restaurant.com that I think has potential, I try it out twice with a certificate.  If I really like it, I'll become a regular customer -- sans the coupon.  As much as we eat out, there are not enough coupons in the world to handle that.

Such was the case.

Now, here's the kicker.

We went during happy hour time.  Yes, I know restaurant.com excludes happy hour prices for most restaurants.  I'm good with that.  I get it -- no one wants to offer a discounted discount.  And that's fair.

The problem stems here, though, when you try to combine your check for happy hour and regular dinner prices.  For two people, our check was over $100.  No, this was not a special occasion.  This is just dinner for two in the Phoenix metro.

Let me clarify by saying, I've done this before.  You order a few happy hour appetizers to see how they are, then you order dinner at regular price with the benefit of the gift certificate.

That seems simple enough, right?

Wrong.

When the check came, we looked it over and made sure we had reached the minimum $50 purchase (regular prices, that is) for the $25 dollar cert.  My risotto was $30, his shrimp parm was about $27.  That's plenty, right?  Wrong, according to the owner.

In the owner's view, if you order ANYTHING off the happy hour menu that's the same check as regular dinner, your coupon is not valid.  Huh?

We \"discussed\" this, the owner and I, for a good 15 minutes.  He kept telling me that the cert is not good for happy hour.  Yes, I get that!  We ordered 4 happy hour apps and 4 glasses of happy hour wine.  $5 each.  That's fine.  We also spent $60 on regular dinner.  I still don't see the foundation for his argument.  

He kept saying that people would \"nickel and dime him\" if he let the happy hour thing go.  Yes, I understand . . . if I'd come in and ordered 10 apps at the $5 happy hour price, then absolutely the coupon is not valid on that.  But we had more than enough in regular dinner cost to meet the certificate requirements.  Well, wow.  He didn't get that.

Apparently, if we'd closed out our bar tab and THEN ordered dinner on a separate check, we'd have been fine.  Again, huh?  Because we ordered everything on one check, it was a huge fiasco!  If we'd known in advance, we'd have just moved tables from the bar into the dining room, with separate checks.

Because, it was WAY too much trouble to just close out our bar tab after the fact, then ring up the dinner tab separately to make sure we met the minimum $50 purchase.

If you've read this far, you're probably smacking your own head.

Here's another kicker:

We got the original check, and we put the check card and the restaurant.com certificate in there.  When the check went away, the price of the wine per glass was $5.  When the check came back, it was $6 per glass.  They somehow just couldn't do the correct price with the certificate.  And, no, I didn't get my price per glass back.  The owner actually told me that we were lucky they didn't bill us for their regular app prices rather than the happy hour prices.  He was a piece of work, and I do NOT mean that as a compliment.

If you've made it this far, then here you go . . . the decency of the food is WAY overtaken by the quality of the service and the sudden price fluctuations dictated by the ownership.

There are much better places to have a good dinner out."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful dinner on the patio. Sea bass is always excellent as are the salads. Good service, generous pours and locally owned."}
{"text":"We have been to the Phoenix area several times, and this is, by far, the best restaurant we have had the pleasure to dine.  Amazing food!  Some of the best Italian food we have had, and that includes the number of places we ate in Italy.  Growing up in San Francisco, and a regular in the North Beach area where great Italian food is the norm, this came as a complete surprise. My husband had the short ribs and cannelloni, and I had linguini with clams.  The short ribs were melt in your mouth, and the cannelloni was light and delicious.  My linguini had more clams than I have ever experienced with this dish elsewhere, and the linguini itself was exquisite.  The owner seated us and made a wine recommendation, which we took, and were glad that we did.  Live music!  A good bar!  Good wines!  What more could you want!"}
{"text":"We love to visit L'Amore for a nice quiet dinner experience. Greg and his staff always provide the best service. Special requests? No problem. Service with a smile!  Highly recommend L'Amore."}
{"text":"This is the most disappointing dining experience I've had in years. The reviews made this restaurant look fantastic. The menu touts handmade pasta. But what we received was neither. 

We ordered the chicken picatta and the eggplant parmigiana. I worked for a time at Macaroni Grill, and let me just say that the eggplant parmesan at Macaroni Grill is FAR superior. The eggplant was greasy and limp, as if fried at too low a temperature or several hours ago. I requested the pasta marinara, which was, as it turns out, penne pasta with bland marinara sauce dumped on top. The sauce was glassy and watery, not well-salted, and not well flavored. The penne was NOT handmade. I've had better pasta from a grocery store. 

The chicken picatta was truly awful. The picatta sauce was clearly made with cornstarch (not a typical ingredient in picatta sauce, for the record) and had very little flavor, other than the bountiful capers. It looked like glue, and tasted very similar. It was served with pasta marinara (six tubes!) and about 6 pieces of steamed vegetable, which was not cooked through. 

For a total of $68 (tip not included, but we did have wine), this was a huge waste of money. I would not return."}
{"text":"First time there. Was happy we went. Food was outstanding and the service was great too. Prices were reasonable for the quality of food and wine was reasonably priced as well. Service was attentive without being intrusive."}
{"text":"This place was surprising as we were staying at the Camelback and just looking for some quick Italian food. We were not dressed up at all, just shorts and flipflops. The owners greeted us warmly at the door and checked in throughout the evening on our meals. Restaurant has a nice family feel and after we devoured our food, the owner even asked if we wanted more pasta. I believe they would have given us more! Pleasant surprise, I give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"Two weeks ago we took our family to this restaurant on the recommendation of a friend.  We were greeted warmly by the owners and sat at a wonderful table.  After ordering cocktails and wine, we had the calamari appetizer which was delicious. Our daughters had the pasta alfredo with chicken and they both remarked it was the BEST they had ever eaten. My husband had the Cioppino special which was excellent.  I had the lasagna and was very impressed with the quality and flavor.  We were very happy with the quality of the food and service and can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"L'Amore is a great hidden gem.  The restaurant has a cozy feel and the service is outstanding.  The dishes served offer a great variety and are not just the usual italian fare  (though they do have many of the classics).  The often have some live music that adds to the ambience."}
{"text":"Every experience at L'Amore is better than the last.  Owner Greg hand picks his food, prepares the specials, and always ensures his guests are having the perfect dinner. The Halibut is the freshest I've ever had.  It's the best Italian restaurant in the Valley by far!"}
{"text":"If I could give it no stars, I would.  Last night, my wife and I visited this restaurant to grab a drink at the bar before an event in Paradise Valley. There were stools but they were singles on the opposite sides of the bar. As we were standing there, the host approached us and asked if we were here for dinner.  We said no, just drinks and would only be there for about 15 or 20 minutes. As he surveyed the bar, he said why don't you take this table which was in the bar area.  We sat down and the server came over to take our order.  We explained to him that we were only going to be here for a very short time and we were just going to order drinks. As we discussed which wine to order, a man (who we later learned is the owner Greg) approached us from behind and was screaming, NO NO NO! You may not sit here. This is RESERVED.  At this point the host came back over and explained that he and seated us there and that we were only going to be there for a very short time, clearly indicating that we would be gone before the reservation. The man proceeded to say, ABSOLUTELY NOT! and gestured for us to leave this table immediately.  He made no attempt to offer us another location to have drinks and was less than professional.  We got up and left the restaurant.

We did not ask for this table!  We followed the lead of the host who offered it to us. Obviously they did not want our business last night. We spent our money elsewhere. We will never return, and we will tell as many people about this experience as possible."}
{"text":"We are new neighbors just up the hill in Paradise Valley, and we SO wanted this to be our \"go to\" dinner place for nights when we were too busy to cook and to take visiting families and friends.   Full disclosure:  we tried four times, each time it was around 8:00 pm. Two of the four we were treated pretty poorly by a female hostess. There were still patrons eating in the restaurant, but she told us they were getting the main dining room set up for a big event the next day (both times) and sat us in the bar. Last night, there was a basketball game on in the bar...I would not mind eating in a pub atmosphere if we were paying pub prices. So, when we told her that the noise was too much and asked to be reseated in the restaurant she refused. I don't think was too much to ask, for just the two of us. And it's interesting the other two times we went, the male hosts gave us the choice, and sat us in the restaurant.  Food has been inconsistent, but not all that bad.  Pasta on two visits was all small pieces (spaghetti one night and fettuccine another) like we were getting the dregs. I'd be more tolerant of that, but for the price of the food, we expect a more pleasant dining experience.   Too bad.  They need to make some changes."}
{"text":"Everything here was amazing!  I can't think of anything that I was unhappy with, which is why I'm giving this place 5 stars.  I made a reservation for my boyfriend as a surprise birthday dinner last week.  I was a little hesitant planning a birthday dinner at a new restaurant.  What if we didn't like the food or the service was poor?  When we walked in we were immediately greeted by a guy who I'm pretty sure is the owner.  After checking out the menu and FINALLY deciding on a dish (everything sounded great), my boyfriend ordered the seafood risotto and I ordered the rigatoni primavera, a vegetarian dish.  Each dish was served with a salad or soup and they also served fresh bread at every table.  While we were waiting for our food we noticed that the crowd there was much older.  I think we brought the median age down by about 30 years!  I also noticed that the guy who seated us was visiting every table, and chatting with everyone.  It seems like most of the people who were eating there were regulars, and knew all the details about this guys family.  Our salads arrived, and although the portion was small the Italian dressing was delish!  Next came our main dishes.  My boyfriend's plate was packed full of seafood including shrimp, scallops, mussels, and clams.  A bit too fishy for me, but he loved it.  My dish was amazing as well, with lots of flavor and tons of vegetables, including mushrooms, zucchini, and cauliflower.  In past reviews I always mention how it can be difficult to find vegetarian dishes with lots of flavor unless you are at a vegetarian restaurant.  That was not the case here at all, this place delivered.  The portions were big, so my boyfriend and I both ended up with some to take home.  We were both disappointed in knowing we had dinner plans the following night, as we were looking forward to eating our leftovers!  This restaurant was a nice change of pace from our usual loud and crowded old town restaurants.  The place was nice and quiet, with some light music playing in the background.  Overall, it was a great experience, and   I will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Found this place next door to the Phoenix At One Yoga studio after a 3 hour class, so probably could have eaten shoe leather and been okay.  However, it was great.  I had the potato wrapped salmon and hubby had cioppino.  Service was attentive and courteous, especially for arriving there after 9PM.  

The bar scene had a Neil Diamond/Country/John Denver type singer who was keeping that area entertained.  I loved the unique, non-chain ambiance and would definitely return."}
{"text":"Had the sea bass special which was great.  Meat was firm but flakey. Price was higher than warranted but the pasta with clams and white sauce was well priced. Service is outstanding. It's the closest to a neighborhood Italian restaurant in this upscale area as you can get. Will be back."}
{"text":"Slow service small portions and mediocre food"}
{"text":"FANTASTIC! 5 Stars all the way! Greg the owner took care of us. Introduced his self, his wife, extremely nice and friendly. The food was outstanding! I highly recommend this authentic Italian restaurant. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"It was a Friday afternoon, my boyfriend at the time said, \"Hey let's go out later for a nice dinner.  Some place we've never been.  Check Yelp and let me know'.  That's exactly what I did.  I searched, \"Date night restaurants near me\".  I'm located in Central Phoenix, walking distance to the Biltmore area.  L'Amore was the first restaurant to pop up!  I noticed they accept reservations online via Open Table ... Points People!  I booked it with ease.  Our reservation was for 7pm.  The minute we arrived the kind hostess called me by my name (score) and led us menus in hand to our very intimate table.  It was a Friday night, there was a large birthday party of about 12 people and a pretty crowded restaurant, yet, at no time did we feel neglected or uncomfortable.  The server was amazing.  The manager (owner maybe) came out to inquire about our meals and overall evening and invited us back again.  It was such a nice evening.  I do plan to return again with my new boyfriend.  *Smile* 

We ordered the Baby Greens Salad to start.  It's simple but delicious with only spinach, roasted red peppers, herb feta and balsamic vinaigrette.  The herb feta was a really nice addition to the salad.  Next time I visit I'm going to try the Seafood Wedge.  We also shared an order of Calamari to start.  L'Amore serves both fried and sautéed calamari.  I've never had sautéed calamari so I stuck with the usual, fried Calamari with black garlic, red pepper and a pepperoni puree.  Again ... Delicious!  Usually my mate and I would share an entrée if we get an appetizer but because the appetizers were so good and it was date night I convinced him to get his own meal. 

I ordered Chicken Marsala with vegetables.  He ordered the grilled salmon with vegetables.  I thoroughly enjoyed both dishes but the Chicken Marsala ... I thought about that dish days later so maybe that was my favorite.  It was cooked perfectly.  It was moist, seasoned so well, and needed nothing at all.  After sharing a bottle of wine, a salad and an appetizer, and our own entrees, we were happy and full so we didn't get dessert."}
{"text":"I'm so in love with this place ! Everything you order on the menu is amazing ! I'm especially impressed because every time we eat here the owners are working ! No wonder this place is so popular ! It's the effort that counts and this pace feels like home !"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place! Honestly the best Italian food I've ever had. We ordered the short rib and cannelloni special (melted in our mouths), tortellini with pancetta and peas (alfredo sauce is out of this world), and lasagna (omg). We were there on a Friday night and the owners were walking around making people feel welcome all night. This place is so warm and inviting and the food is to die for. It will be a new regular spot for us. We're planning to bring many people with us next time!"}
{"text":"Found this place through Yelp and the reviews convinced me that it was worth a visit.  Decided to go for lunch when it would be less crowded and the prices would be lower (in case we hated it and didn't want to cry over a huge bill).  
About 1ish and there were a few tables with a number of people.  Good sign, I thought.  The place is LOVELY. It is nicely decorated with an \"old school\" italian feel and wonderful piped in music (I thought I heard some Sinatra) .   
We ordered chicken parmigiana and chicken marsala---italian standards so that we could compare these dishes to other places where we have eaten.  We were brought some warm, crusty bread and softened butter in a ramekin.  I like butter that doesn't come in those tiny disposable mini containers other places serve up.   The bread, while attractive and crusty, was not a bread one would call delicious. It was just bread.  Do you get what I mean?  I give them credit for giving free bread which many italian restaurant now charge for. 

The Chicken Parmigiana was an adequate portion for lunch as was the chicken marsala.  Both came with rigatoni (or ziti not sure) and the marsala dish came with veggies.  The marsala sauce had mushrooms in it and was not overly sweet.  That is my preference, but the person who ordered it, thought it to be a tad salty and not as sweet as it usually is.  After all, he said, \"Marsala wine does have a sweetness to it.\"  The chicken in both dishes was prepared well--not overcooked.   The rigatoni were cooked perfectly \"al dente\"  the way pasta is supposed to be cooked.  The disappointment was the red sauce--the marinara sauce--And to us, the sauce is EVERYTHING!  It was too thick perhaps from using too much tomato paste and very oregano-y.  Too much oregano in fact.  Spices have to be used subtly so that no one herb or spice dominates to the point where the diner can call out what it is.  It is to be a melange of flavors married to each other and complementing one another.  So the sauce was not a winner for us.  Being originally from NY, we have had the best of the best  and have eaten sauces that blow your mind with deliciousness.   The dishes were $14 each, but if this had been dinner, they would have been $23.  So I'm glad we conducted this experiment at lunchtime.  
I really liked the decor and the hospitality as one of the owners came by the table to greet us when we first sat down.  However, there was no goodbye.  Perhaps our assessment of the food was written in our faces."}
{"text":"Wow!!!! This place! My boyfriend took me here for our anniversary dinner and it was one of the best and most romantic meals I've had in quite some time. He picked this place based on other Yelp reviews and I must admit at first I was skeptical. I have dined at a lot of restaurants in the Arcadia/Biltmore area which are usually very flashy & trendy and almost make you forget how great these hidden gems can be. It is unsuspecting on the outside but offers such high quality food and an overall very genuine, authentic experience. We were personally seated by the owner of the restaurant and felt so welcomed right away. The atmosphere is very classic and reminds me of Italian restaurants in New York. Our server Francesca was the absolute sweetest and made our occasion feel very special. I was suffering from really bad heartburn and she brought me soda water with bitters which totally cured me and allowed me to enjoy my evening. We started with the Mussels and holy cow. Probably the best mussels I've ever eaten in Arizona. They were so plump and fresh tasting and the sauce was to DIE for. It was hard to stop eating it with the amazing bread. For entrees we had one of the daily specials- grouper picatta and then baked ziti with sausage from the regular menu. The grouper was so immaculately prepared and the sauce was incredible. We were treated to some flourless chocolate cake at the end which did not disappoint either. I seriously cannot say enough good things about this place and urge you to give it chance. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Very good old school Italian slightly upscale. Good wine selection and very good service. Mussels marinara outstanding as well as their seafood salad loaded with fresh goodness. The waiter was a transplant from Jersey little rough but excellent server!
Buon appetito ciao."}
{"text":"This place never lets us down!! A neighborhood gem!!!! The staff is always welcoming and  the customer service above average. 
Food and wine wonderful."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a great sit down Italian restaurant, then go here!  The staff was friendly and competent (never a given these days).  They don't try to follow whatever trend is coming from some \"expert\" on food network, just a solid, well prepared meal."}
{"text":"Wow! We moved to the area about a year ago and were getting tired of going to hillstone every weekend so wanted to try a new local spot and chose L'Amore! It was absolutely delicious and the service was perfect. We were the youngest in the lounge by about thirty years and it was even more fun that way - in fact I think we are going to be the newest & youngest regulars! Can't wait to come back for both the fantastic happy hour and stay for dinner again. Thanks for a great evening."}
{"text":"If you want a genuine Italian restaurant experience, L'Amore is as good as it gets! It reminds me of places I've been in New York or San Francisco. We had a large party with my wife's parents. my brother-in-law, his husband, and our kids, but that wasn't a problem for them at all.  In fact, the service was excellent and extremely friendly from our waiter and even the owner coming by to check on us. The selection of food was excellent and everybody enjoyed their food. I had the cioppino, my kids split a chicken piccatta, and my wife had the chicken marsala. Others had various options. I highly recommend this place for an evening out, and you don't even need to wait for a special occasion, just go if you want a good meal and an enjoyable night."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful dinner at L'Amore.  Food was great and the service was friendly and made us feel very special. Just the type of dinner date night we were looking for.  No hesitation to head back."}
{"text":"This restaurant is always perfect, the owners are so friendly and kind. They take great care of us and always remember us. It has become my grandchildren's new favorite restaurants"}
{"text":"One of if not the best meals in the city: cioppino.  Owners treat us like family.  This is where my family celebrates and always leave happy."}
{"text":"Pretty decent neighborhood Italian restaurant.  Owner and staff are always friendly and accommodating.  The food's good and, so far, nothing I've tried has disappointed.  If you live in the neighborhood and don't feel like traveling far, this place is perfect."}
{"text":"We joined a group of six for a Saturday night dinner and had a wonderful time.  Everything from the charming decor to the wonderful service (Brenda was our very professional server ) was perfect.  We each had a different entree and all were delighted.  The cioppino and cannelloni were particularly outstanding.  We be returning very soon."}
{"text":"This restaurant is not the very best in Phoenix, but the service are superior at everything, and that is what is important to me, the service was excellent by Christie."}
{"text":"Good meal and service.  However, details count.  On my bill there was a $2 charge for\"up\".  I inquired and was told this was for the extra alcohol in my Martini because it was served up.  That is a new one on me.

A charge like this is pure lack of concern for guests.  The waiter did not reverse the charge so the adjustment came out of his tip.  The adjustment should have come from the owner.  A behavioral gaff like this shows the underlying essence of service.  Take the patron for what they are worth.  I will not return."}
{"text":"I was in Phoenix this weekend for my cousin's graduation.  We ended up going to L'Amour for dinner and our experience there was amazing!!!  I knew it was going to be amazing from the point I made reservations for 20 people through open table.  Five minutes after making the reservations I got a call from Greg, one of the owners, and he made me feel so important!  When we got to the restaurant everyone greeted us and made us feel so welcomed and excited about our celebration! The food was amazing, the staff was attentive and the owners were great!!! I love their spirt and great attitude!! I will definitely be back when I visit Phoenix!"}
{"text":"It was Saturday February 17th 2018 and I made a reservation for two at approximately 8pm & told them it was a VERY special occasion and requested a table for two.  I had planned to propose to my girlfriend. We arrived to the most beautiful ambiance, the restaurant was completely full, greeted at the entrance with a very warm welcome by the older female hostess.  My girlfriend was so excited about the ambiance & music, it was quite stimulating. She seated us within minutes and we requested to sample their very best Chardonnay. After tasting two,  I then ordered a bottle of my girlfriend's choosing.  After reviewing the menu, we decided on the Caprese Salad to start & to be followed by a Veal Piccata and Veal Marsala.  Unfortunately when the Caprese Salad arrived, there was NO BASIL but rather plenty of spinach!?!  As we pushed our plates away with disappointment the server noticed and reported to the kitchen, then suddenly returned to confirm that they were out of Basil. Shortly after that awful experience, our entrees arrived while still maintaining hope, but yet again disappointed after a few bites, realizing the veal for both dishes was tough and must have been frozen for quite some time. My girlfriend thought it was chicken! Personally I wasn't sure what kind of meat I had just tasted. Once again we pushed our plates away and immediately requested the check.  At that point the owner came over, introduced himself and sat down at our table; uninvited. We expressed our initial disappointment with the Basil-less Caprese salad (if any Italian could call it that).  He apologized and informed us that due to so many clients, the kitchen had ran out of ingredients and it had been removed off our bill. To which we wondered why it had been knowingly served in the first place with a key ingredient missing.  We quickly made our escape back to our regular Italian joint just down the road. Never to return to this so called Italian restaurant. 

P.S. My girlfriend said 'yes' after she ate REAL Italian food at Veneto."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant based on Yelp reviews. What an absolutely incredible restaurant. Food that is fresh, delicious, fabulous presentation and delightful owners. I recommend this pace and if I could give it a 10 I would . So nice to be personally greeted by the owners who took time to chat with us make recommendations and make sure everything was to our liking. Our dishes were halibut, salmon and short ribs which were  cooked to perfection and came out hot. Bread was plentiful and wine was excellent. Such a great experience. Just go there and enjoy!!! You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"This was my third time eating here and by far the best. Everything was perfectly prepared but the best of all was our waiter Sal. He was perfectly attentive without being invasive and made the evening the best ever! Thanks Sal"}
{"text":"L'Amore....is the most amazing restaurant ever!!! I eat here at least 3 times a week! Not only is the food off the charts but the attention from Kim and Gregg (the owners) is special!!!"}
{"text":"We loved this place! We got a coupon off of restaurant.com and it wAs well worth the wait. I had the tortellini with the Alfredo sauce which is the best Alfredo sauce I have had to date! It's my favorite sauce. My hubby had the gnocci with the marinara sauce which was to die for! We will definitely go back. We had to wait 30min past our reservation but it was well worth it. Two dinner plates and a glass of wine hit the $50 coupon just perfectly."}
{"text":"Love this amazing Restaurant! Just had the Eggplant Parm, so Yummy! Everything here is so good and atmosphere so romantic.. One of my favorites! I always come back!"}
{"text":"Hadn't been in a couple years and after such a fantastic meal, I had to slap myself!  

Starting with the something as simple as the Italian bread which was warm, perfectly crusty on the outside and tender on the inside! Perfection.

Menu Special: off-the-bone  beef short ribs with a side of sauteed spinach and stuffed cannelloni. The short ribs were fork-tender, moist and perfectly seasoned. The cannelloni was simply amazing too.

Off the menu: Lasagna. Classic. Perfection!! I got full toward the end of it, but kept pushing like the little engine who could. 

New York style cheesecake and Cappuccino for dessert. Perfect finish to a ferfect meal! 

Sat at the bar for dinner and the service from Laura was awesome. 

Some folks on Yelp have described the interior as outdated. True. Its not a hipster spot but I think that sort of adds to the charm  of the place."}
{"text":"Great, just great!  We were traveling in the Phoenix area and were looking for a special family owned style Italian restaurant and found L'Amore on Yelp.  It hit on all cylinders; great food, great service, solid ambiance on the patio (you don't even know you're near the parking lot).  We had the tortellini and baked ziti; you could taste the homemade love. No Italian restaurant worth its salt fails on the bread, and L'Amore delivered, crunchy crust, warm and soft inside.  Do yourself a favor, stop here when in the Phoenix area!"}
{"text":"We went to L'Amore on April 6 about 7PM.  We had not been there for years. The place was packed.  It took a very long time for anyone to seat us as they do not have a host at the front.  After being seated the service was great.  We ordered the special which was short ribs and cannelloni.  Unfortunately there is only one choice of salad dressing which is oil and way, way too much vinegar.  Even my partner who likes vinaigrette could not eat it.  The bread served was warm and scrumptious.  The main course was served with a sautéed spinach and tomato which also had way, way too much vinegar. The short ribs were cooked to death, as they should be, and the sauce was great.  The cannelloni was excellent.  If L'Amore could only figure out their salad dressing and maybe offer another option like feta cheese it would really improve  the dining experience.  Especially considering we spent almost $100 on dinner with no desert and only 2 glasses of wine and 1 beer.   But it has been this way for years and so I guess it will always stay this way.   If they would improve the salad and the sautéed vegetables I could improve my rating."}
{"text":"Quick review: Nice staff, EXPENSIVE FOOD, HORRIBLE QUALITY OF THE FOOD, definitely wouldn't recommend this place to anyone a meal for two and an appetizer cost me $83 in total plus tip. 

I have never actually given a review of a restaurant before this one, but I genuinely felt like I had to warn people about eating here. For starters the ambiance was very nice! They had live music and I love when restaurants do that. The staff was also amazing! I felt as if the owner or manager was a little too involved with his customers and was in need of some professional restraint, but to each their own on that one. I am leaving this review because of the HORRIBLE food to price ratio. What exactly do I mean by that? Well the food quality WAS NOT AT ALL WHAT I PAID FOR. It genuinely was sub-par food and ingredients that I could have ran to frys and gotten. I knew it was bad when I got a side of \"steamed\" vegetables and it was nothing more than a few carrots and a very large piece of cauliflower. The chicken was not butterflied or tenderized properly. The only thing that struck me as genuinely good was the red bell pepper sauce under the strait from the freezer calamari. My pasta was WAY undercooked and my girlfriends gnocchi was WAY overdone tasting more like mush than anything else. For god sakes they didn't even grate fresh Parmesan over your food it was already ready to go(Cardinal sin in any Italian restaurant), and they cut THICK LONG slices of Parmesan over your food that didn't melt and took away all of the experience from the box made under cooked pasta. All of this wouldn't be enough for me to leave a review if my meal in total for two people was $73?!?! Plus a tip of $10 (probably should have tipped more like I usually do but I was already pissed I had to leave $73 to this awful meal). In total came out to $73??! How can food of this horrid quality be considered worth ANYWHERE NEAR THAT?? This place caters the old rich people of Scottsdale who don't really seem to mind the dates decor, or the seemingly endless pictures of horses on the walls, or the chandelier that looked like it was ready to pop off at any moment. I really wanted to like this place because of the staff but I can't justify ever coming here again due to the horrible quality of the food and how ungodly expensive it is. I didn't take pictures of the food but I'll leave my bill as evidence that I did ACTUALLY eat here.

UPDATE: I found Kim's response pretty unprofessional to say the least! (Photo included)"}
{"text":"Great culinary experience. Greg, the owner, is very personable. Enjoyed the live music and the whole warm feeling of the restaurant...great food and great wine."}
{"text":"We went here last night as first time guests and it was amazing! From the time we entered the restaurant up until the time we left, our service and experience was nothing but amazing! Kim & Greg, the owners, are fantastic! They really made sure we were having the best experience. Our server, Sal, was wonderful! 

We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a hidden gem. From the moment we entered we felt welcome. Even though we were early for our reservation, we were seated immediately. Debbie, our server, was warm and friendly and very knowledgeable. We travel extensively and dine out frequently and the food was among the best Italian in the States. I had the cioppino and my husband had the linguine with clams. Both dishes we're outstanding. This is a must visit if you are in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I kept hearing about this restaurant, So we decided to give it a try.  We weren't disappointed. The food was spot on. The service was impeccable. The atmosphere was perfect, with great live music. The  owners give a superb personal touch to everyone. You know how good a restaurant is, when you are wiping your face from your delicious dinner, and you are thinking what you are going to have next time."}
{"text":"Um, so I finally found a place to rival Avanti. Finally!!!

The owners know what they are doing. If you're not greeted at the door, they'll come around to your table to say hello. They are on top of it. It's the kind of place where you feel like a regular after one visit. We weren't even dressed for it, but decided it's Arizona ... no one really has a dress code. 

I don't remember what wine we drank, but we killed a bottle pretty quickly. Want to make dinner enjoyable? Drink some damn wine and loosen up. I was so surprised to read that a few people felt out of place here. I have only been once and I was treated like I was their longtime valued customer. It was awesome! I seriously haven't been treated this well at a restaurant since my grandfather was alive. The owner even insisted on refilling our wine after we paid the bill. Come on, you know you'll be back after that. 

On to the food. This is the ONLY time I have ever liked gnocchi at a restaurant beside's Avanti. This is a huge compliment coming from me. This has never happened. I would never forsake my beloved Avanti ... not until now. Now I have a total of two places in the whole of Arizona acceptable for ordering gnocchi. Thank, god. (Can you say, first world problems?)"}
{"text":"This is a lovely place; warm and welcoming.  There is the choice between eating at the bar, sitting outside, or the patio or dining-in.  We typically head to the bar area and ask for the Happy Hour menu.  The wine pours are generous & the people who work the bar area are very attentive and friendly.  There is an array of Happy Hour choices--I enjoy their caprese salad where the chef chops everything into smaller bites.  There are economically priced small pizza's that look delicious and I've also noticed that a lot of folks order the very healthy portion of calamari.  I ordered off the regular menu a plentiful seafood salad that was loaded with calamari, crab etc. on a grilled romaine bed.  There are very moderate pricing options and, also, some pricier dishes.  I would recommend L'Amore as a welcoming neighborhood restaurant with attentive staff and an array of good food choices. There is sometimes musical entertainment in the evenings as well."}
{"text":"we LOVE this restaurant, the owner Greg is sooo nice and friendly, the food is amazing we've been several times for special occasions and family dinners, going tomorrow night for my daughter Heidi's Birthday, We're D'Angelo's so believe me its amazing fresh food, you won't be disappointed. Beautiful atmosphere, ask for the table under the chandelier if there's more than five!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here this past weekend with high hopes considering the great response on yelp.  However, it was one disappointment after another.

We were seated right away - by a woman wearing jeans and flip-flops.  Classy.  And we sat there for 40 minutes before we were noticed.  We would have left, but we were thinking it was one of those places that doesn't give you a menu right away on purpose, and we were going to leave at 45 minutes, so they barely saved us in time. 
I'm not sure if it was the owner or the manager who came over to greet us, but he didn't even apologize for the crap service when we told him we hadn't been helped yet.
The waiter came over next, who did apologize, saying he thought we had already been helped.  Though we appreciate the apology and that at least someone in this establishment cares about our happiness, we couldn't help but wonder why he \"thought someone else had helped\" us in the first place - don't they have designated serving areas?   Even after 15 or 20 minutes, wouldn't the server start to think it's odd we still didn't have drinks, let alone menus?

Shortly thereafter, this woman (owner? co-owner? manager?) came by to apologize to us, which is more than the first owner/manager did for us.  However, her apology was very empty, and you could tell she felt awkward apologizing and didn't know quite what to say.  What she did say was \"this never happens to us\".  Well that's nice, but it just did happen so how about you make up for it somehow.  Furthermore, she placed her hand on the back of my chair as she stood there, her other hand directly on my boyfriend's back.  Please, lady, you don't know us from a hole in the wall, please no touching!

Moving on.  My boyfriend ordered the chicken parmigiana, and I ordered the beef tenderloin gorgonzola.  The starter salad was uneventful; they came it had a house Italian dressing, but it tasted mostly like oil, very bland.  Our main entrees were decent at best.  The beef came with far too much mashed potatoes, and about 5 pieces of crumbled gorgonzola.  There was way more meat than there was cheese, and though gorgonzola can be an overpowering cheese, I expected a bit more.  The chicken tasted good and my boyfriend didn't complain much, other than the fact that his grandmother could make better Italian food than this.  He was looking forward to some authentic Italian food, and this place did not deliver.

In the end, we declined dessert.  And to top it all off, we didn't get comped anything!  Considering the poor service we were given in the beginning, we thought that would be the least they could do for us.  An 8 o'clock reservation turned into a 2-hour meal because we had to wait for the first 40 minutes to be noticed.  Maybe some people like to relax and enjoy dinner for 2 hours, I most certainly do not though.

I would advise others to stay away from this poor establishment and spend your money on more exciting food elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Went twice during our short vacation. Both times awesome! Owner is great, as is the food. Will be back next time!"}
{"text":"Our party of five had an interesting experience at this restaurant tonight.  We had a7:30 reservation and we're seated shortly after we arrived.  We all ordered a glass of  wine but we were never presented with menus.  After about 45 minutes we finally asked for them.  For some reason they were short on menus but sharing was no big deal.  Several of us wanted the fish special but that was all gone.  Seemed strange for a 7:30 reservation but we adjusted our orders to our second choice.  Each meal comes with soup or salad and 3 of us ordered salads.  Turns out they were out of lettuce so two of us refused the chicken noodle soup.  No substition was offered.  The main dishes arrived and the food was good but it was already 9:30.  Nothing was offered to make this right.  Surprisingly poor customer service."}
{"text":"This restaurant is not the very best at anything, but they are superior at everything, and that is what is important to me.  I know I can get better Italian food in Italy, better seafood in San Francisco and better pastry at a bakery, but it is the overall experience that I judge.  
Based I my system I will be a regular customer.
This is my first restaurant review, seriously."}
{"text":"Great groceries, and fantastic service and the owner is out standing, great atmosphere.
Thanks Greg"}
{"text":"This place is the BEST. Greg and his staff were incredibly accommodating for our party of 43. I will definitely recommend this place to all my friends in Las Vegas. We when come back to Phoenix we are eating are eating here again."}
{"text":"Very expensive, mediocre food, small portions.  l ordered the gnocchi with Alfredo sauce.   l received a bowl of approximately 20 small undercooked gnocchi with a meager amount of sauce.  Not bad if you are on a starvation diet and like raw pasta at highly inflated prices.

I will not go there again.  You can get better food and  service via Olive  Garden -  and that's not saying much."}
{"text":"My friend Jody introduced me to this place last week and it was so good I thought about it daily until I got to go back Friday.  I am not a leftover kinda girl but the blackened salmon with the avocado tomato salad was awesome fresh and as a leftover the next day! I would prefer the tomato avocado salad to be more whole instead of a diced salad w dressing .. I just prefer to see and taste the food more as it is super good and you don't need to be fussy w it.. some slices of tomato and avocado w a drizzle would have been beautiful and less fussy and I know it's a personal preference but well it was still good... and the salmon was ah-mazing!!"}
{"text":"It was not worth the drive or the prices.  You are basically paying for the ambiance.  The food was nothing outstanding.  My husband had a plate that seem big enough for a small child.  My veal was a bit larger, or at least it seemed that way on my plate, but nothing to brag about.  The food was nothing I expected from an Italian upscale rest. Not worth it at all."}
{"text":"I come here once a week and the food and service is always amazing! I have yet to have anything less than wonderful from a Sole Salad to the Eggplant. Bonus: supporting a locally owned business!"}
{"text":"See Kim this is very nice and professional. I do not live in your area and visited a couple months back on a work trip with other business men. Therefore you will not find my name anywhere on your books. Keep up your great work. My problem had nothing to do with your food or establishment, simply a review on your husbands response to not only one review but two. Enjoy your day. P.s. you should keep charge of YELP because as you can see many people do use this as a resource"}
{"text":"The best Italian restaurant in town! Super fresh seafood salad is to die for!  Grilled veggies are perfect. Their homemade pastas are sooo delish. Service is always good and when you get to go it's always hot and quick."}
{"text":"The owners are make you feel so welcome as do all of the staff. Great food and wine. I recommend the ziti with sausage and the shrimp with black garlic shrimp and sausage."}
{"text":"I do not know who is cooking here, but what is coming out of that kitchen, is pure magic! I am a foodie. I've been everywhere and every place so I am not easy to impress but I got to admit... I am impressed. I cannot wait to come back, and if i talk too much it may be difficult to get a table next time. So I will just say, it was the most delicious food ever! The mushroom soup was.exquisite. The lemon butter caper grouper was out of this world, and I didnt order the cioppino but i have never seen something so amazing. Chuck full of seefood. My friend LOVED IT! I am really impressed. The service was great by the way. It felt like they were expecting me and i was a vip. Warmly greeted by the owner himself, and what it felt like the wholeteam of waiters, i could not complain."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I found this restaurant online. We are visiting Phoenix from New York and were looking for an Italian restaurant. We are so so happy we came here. The service was incredible. The owners were beyond welcoming and friendly. The food was also unbelievably tasty and the prices were affordable. Super upset we won't be able to come back as we are leaving in a couple days but we will recommend to anyone that comes to visit the area!!"}
{"text":"They really treat you like family here. The owners and waiters seem to recognize you after only  a few visits in and really try to make your visit special.  The food is great, especially the soup! Most meals come with soup, which normally I'm not a big fan of, but theirs is amazing!"}
{"text":"Last night we celebrated my bride's 77th birthday and i want to give a shout out to owner Greg and waiter Tim for making this a very memorable  night.  Each one in our party of 6 commented on how delicious their meal was and most impressively, 5 of the meals were different choices.  The attention to detail by the support staff, Tim's handling of when to let the conversations dictate the timing of things, and lastly while there many other tables occupied, Greg took the time to stop by numerous times and highlighted the evening with a dessert for the birthday girl....A perfect night....Thank You...."}
{"text":"Great management, great servers, great food. - so much so that although I'm not a salad guy, I tell people that the best salad I ever had was here.    Now today, I just had a salad for lunch that included Steak and Shrimp!  Mmmmm"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was relaxing for our Friday date night.  The food was excellent, fresh, had wonderful flavor and was comforting.  We will definitely dine here again."}
{"text":"With 32 reviews and 4.5 stars I had high hopes. We were sorely disappointed. 

The Restaurant:  Dated decor, Christmas lights everywhere (in Feb). Poor layout. 
The Drinks:  bad wine and poorly made vodka cocktail made this a waste of time. 

The Food:  Mediocre would be a compliment. The ziti and tortellini were terribly underseasoned. The salad was lettuce carrots and oil. Even the bread was subpar. 

The Service:  Our server started off well but went downhill fast. No recommendations, MIA for 20 minutes and taking \"the food wasn't too bad\" as a compliment made this experience unenjoyable. 

The Price:  There's not much worse than over paying for lackluster food.  I can cook better at home. 

The Verdict:  Any other Italian restaurant is a better choice. Pick the next one."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this restaurant!  We had a party of 5 on a busy Saturday night.  We had reservations and were seated right away.  The owners are on the floor helping the staff!  The food, customer service, and atmosphere cannot be beat!~"}
{"text":"I came in from out of town and met a friend there. It was busy but still it was easy for us to hear each other. The calamari is not to be missed. It is cooked just perfectly and is served over a delicious red pepper sauce. I also had a Pinot Grigio and a Caprese salad. Yum, everything was perfect! Don't miss this gem!"}
{"text":"We had a need for good Italian.  Whipped out the handy dandy 'Yelp' application and did some intel on the area and came up with L'Amore Ristorante.

Great find!!  Owned by a lovely couple who are customer service focused and run a very nice establishment that warrants a visit from you.

We were seated quickly for lunch and we had a terrific server, Lena.  She was spot on for everything we needed and anticipated our every need.  Great start!  I wish I had the dinner menu as it looked really good as well.

We had the Eggplant Parm with their soup of the day.  The Eggplant Parm was very nice.  I had them add extra sauteed onions and bell peppers to the dish. It elevated the dish to the point where I wanted more.
It is served with sauteed spinach and the dish was really good.  The only thing I wish they did was to add a small portion of pasta to the dish with their sauce.  It would be a bit more fulfilling.

The cheese Totellini was was also nice and had good flavor.  Next time, I would add a sausage and veggies to this as well.

To finish off a nice lunch, we had a slice of Lemonchello Cake.  Flavor-wise, terrific!!!  It just needed to be brought up closer to room temp as it was served straight out of the fridge and the cake lost some of its moistness.  If another way was looked at, on how to store this cake, so it is not so hard, when you eat it, it would be 100% perfection.

I highly reccomend anyone to come and try out the tasty food at L'Amore."}
{"text":"Food was great, and even though they don't have a children's menu, they made my daughter a half-order of the chicken parmigiana. This was our first time there, and we really enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is nice and relaxed.  The food was terrific.  I truly wish I could give bonus stars cause this place deserves it!  You need to come here if in the area"}
{"text":"The best Italian food I have ever had- the large group we came with all agreed. The owners were there and were amazingly accommodating. Thank you so much we wish we lived in AZ so we could return!"}
{"text":"This place is the Hope Diamond of hidden gems! I grew up in an Italian household, so Italian food is as personal as it gets for me. And this place does Italian well enough to please my grandmother. My husband and I went for a romantic dinner, and we were not disappointed at the amibance of the place. The owner himself was seating everyone and while it was an air of elegance, we also felt really welcomed. Our waiter Julio brought us our menus and ice water right away, which was great because it was super hot out, even for Arizona. We selected a Chardonnay from Fess Parker vineyards, and because we had a gift certificate from restaurants.com, we opted to split a bottle of it. It was the first of many great decisions. For our appetizer we split the antipasto for 2. Incredible. Fresh veggies that were perfectly roasted, cold, salty meats, sweet rich cheeses, awesome! Their fresh sourdough bread was a pleasure to eat, with that just right crispy crust and light, fluffy middle. We both had the ceasar salad, which really prepped us well for our meal, as it was well sized and not overly dressed.  I ended up with the seafood risotto and my husband had the baked ziti with sausage. We were stunned. First of all, they came out HOT! Not the luke warm-ness that's becoming too common now, but truly hot! My husband loved his ziti. He went so far as to say it's better the first baked ziti he ever had, which was on New York's Mulberry Street with his parents when he was a teen. My risotto had so many layers of deep intense flavor I was beside myself. Not overly full of seafood, but enough to satisfy the craving, the clams, mussles, scallops and shrimp were to perfection. There was small peices of shredded lobster throughout. The peas, red peppers and asparagus were done well, but not mushy and the rice was just al dente. The saffron lobster bisque broth was intense in flavor but let each aspect of the dish shine through! As much as we were enjoying dinner, we decided to take half of each portion (very large portions, so bring friends or a large appetite or be prepared to take some home) home with us so we could have dessert. I'm so glad we did. We had the vanilla creme brulee. You could actually see the vanilla beans in the custard. And it wasn't overly sweet. Too many are cloyingly so, but not this one! And it had a rather thick ring of the burnt sugar, which I liked, cause to me that's the best thing about creme brulee. The owner, as mentioned by others, was all over the place, but always making time to sit and chat with his patrons to make sure they were happy. Julio was fabulously attentive, not being in our faces, but our glasses were never empty and the pace was perfect. We agreed this is a place we'll be going to at least once a month, if not more!"}
{"text":"Hands down, my favorite in Arizona for Italian.  Service, quality, atmosphere, and prices are reasonable!  Owners are sweet and very friendly.  This is my go to place whenever I'm asked where I want to go!!!  Love it!"}
{"text":"This place is to Italian what Macayos is to Mexican, more domestic then authentic.  That isn't to say it isn't very tasty.  Very comfortable atmosphere and menu."}
{"text":"Craving Italian and wanted to try some place we have never been.  I was sold when I read this was a family owned Italian place.  The owners meet you at the door and take you to your seats.  The staff was wonderful and very pleasant.  I had the veal parm and my wife had the cioppino.  Mine was great, but I highly recommend trying the cioppino....sooooo good!  

What I loved about this place was the family feel.  We were not rushed at all and you could tell they genuinely cared about us having a great dining experience and not just getting us in and out and on to the next table.  In a world dominated by the chains and the big corporate restaurant groups, I will choose this place any day.  They also had live music, at a low volume, which was a great added touch."}
{"text":"This is the best seafood restaurant I love the food and the service variety of options everything is great"}
{"text":"The delicious smell of yumminess walking in the door is excellent.    Best steamed clams ever!  Best Cioppino ever!  Best meatball ever.."}
{"text":"Greg and his staff are always accommodating, friendly and fun.  Great food every time!  For lunch the atmosphere is accommodating for meetings and discussions.  Thank you Greg and keep up the great service, food and fun."}
{"text":"I went there for the first time on Tuesday.  I had the lunch special of Salmon and side salad.  My friend had pasta and meatball.  Both items were wonderful.  The service was excellent.  The owner kept checking on us.  The restaurant is beautiful, and the restoom was clean and nice.  I will go back."}
{"text":"L'amore was So good!  But like every place, there are pros and cons:

Cons:  The prices on the online menu are NOT the prices in the store.  I only had pasta, so I can't speak for the entrees, but a dish of pasta was closer to $20 a plate than $12.  The crowd was older.  We were the youngest people by at least 20 years.  However, if you ask me, it's a sign of how GOOD the food was (older people tend to have more $$ to spend on their meals, and thus choose better ones!!!)  Finally, it's a little far out of the way, but that's only because I live in downtown Phoenix; this may not be an issue for you!

That's all I got for cons!  :)

Pros:  The food was AMAZING!!!!  The portions are definitely large, and in all, are totally worth what they cost.  We tried the potato gnocchi with red sauce, the chicken fettucini alfredo, and the tortellini with prosciutto and peas and cream sauce.  I would HIGHLY recommend the tortellini, it's CRAZY how amazing it was!!!  The staff was nice, there was even some live music!  The setting is very romantic, but not too over the top (we went as a girls night, and even then it was still fun!) 

Overall, it's totally worth the drive, and worth the prices if you are up for sharing (or it's a special occasion!)  Loved it!"}
{"text":"After reading other reviews on Yelp, my wife and I decided to give L'Amore a try. We arrived at an odd time for lunch, around 2PM and found the restaurant uncrowded and were seated immediately. Our waiter brought us the most fantastic soda bread I believe, it was scrumptious! I wanted a veal dish with a Marinara sauce but only saw it on the menu served with a Marsala sauce. I asked my waiter if it was possible to have it made with the Marinara, and to my liking, it was! My wife also had the Veal Piccata, which was very tasty. We saved room for a slice of Limoncello for dessert which came served in a beautiful presentation with a raspberry drizzle and fresh strawberries, and well-chilled to boot. The atmosphere of the restaurant is pleasing and tastefully decorated as well; the background music was very soothing, and the prices were very reasonable. I will definitely be paying L'Amore Italian Restaurant another visit in the near future and highly recommend you do as well."}
{"text":"We tried this last week on the recommendation of a friend and so glad we did.  From the second we walked in and the owner Greg greeted us as if we were old friends to when we left it was nothing short of wonderful.  The waiter was knowledgeable about all the dishes and specials and recommended some very good wines.  Our party ordered clams, mussels, caprese salad, halibut and eggplant parm and everyone enjoyed the authentic flavor and I personally liked the marina.  I know Lori K. Reviewed the bread was hard which to me means she's never heard of sourdough so I wouldn't value her cuisine opinions at all and I can't believe all her negative comments and wonder if she went to the same restaurant as our experience was awesome.  A gentleman we were with couldn't believe it wasn't shipped in from San francisco it was so good and fresh.  Nice relaxing live music and this is now our must go to restaurant in Phoenix.  We went back again that same week... Highly recommend.  It reminds me of a back home neighborhood restaurant with its intimate and unique ambience.  Thank you Greg and we will be back soon.  The people from Branson, Missouri."}
{"text":"We found this place a few years ago and haven't stopped coming back!  Greg and Kim are the owners and we've never been there when they are not. Staff is great, food and ambience is AMAZING!  We have introduced many friends to L'Amore and everyone loves it. We were happy to have New Year's Eve dinner there last night with friends and it was lovely. Reservations recommended as it is usually busy."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! Not only was the food fabulous, but the service was great. Both owners chatted with us and the wait staff were very friendly. Would definitely come back here!"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service and phenomenal cuisine. This was our first visit here and we will definitely be coming back. The food is authentic and fresh. The mushroom ravioli was delicious! I would recommend this restaurant for a romantic date night or a family dinner."}
{"text":"Very good food at a reasonable price. Great service too! Really nice people. I would recommend this restaurant to anybody looking for good Italian food."}
{"text":"Very solid little Northern Italian restaurant on the outskirts of PV. Friendly, efficient servers, great entrees. My only problem was the appetizer mussels were tiny, but the other app (a grilled veggie platter) and all the entrees were great. A solid 4 stars....."}
{"text":"Great place. Very cozy, comfortable spot to bring someone special. 
Stopped in for a beer and decided to have the bruschetta for an appetizer and was so good had to stay for dinner. 
With the lovely bartenders (Laura's) advice I chose the blackened garlic, shrimp & sausage. It was amazing."}
{"text":"Very Average and nothing really stood out. Everything is very salty, which I never take as a good sign.  There are much better options in the area."}
{"text":"This place is honestly one of the most amazing places I have ever eaten at. When I first Came here I was with my girlfriend (now wife) but I can honestly say we can not get enough of this place. The thing I love about this place is that I feel like I'm coming to see family every time. Also what I love about this place is that the owners are picture perfect. They have the most amazing memory I swear, when my wife was pregnant the owners always said you better bring back that baby we want to meet her. Just last Saturday I brought my 8 month old baby girl and I swear the owner was with us talking for a while on how happy he was for me. all I can say is this place is home away from home. the food will forever bring me back but the people that work and own that place you guys are doing a great job and this is easily 5 star restaurant."}
{"text":"We had dinner here for my husband's birthday and it was fantastic. It is a step above. The service, atmosphere and especially the food were all amazing. It was an experience, they don't rush you and you are able to enjoy each course. We all had different entrees and they were all delicious. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"The ambiance is really nice. We stopped in on a whim Saturday night. We didn't have a reservation and they got us right in. The owner was so nice, he got our son a plate of peas to help tide him over. The salad was delisious, I ordered the fettuccini alfredo, my husband ordered the lasagna. Everything was so tasty, did I mention the bread? It's so warm and chewy. I am so glad that we stumbled upon this gem."}
{"text":"Authentic and delicious!!!  Owners were amazing and made us \"part of the family\"!!  Sal our waiter was spectacular!  We will be back soon!!"}
{"text":"Cozy neighborhood gem!  The place you go when you want to relax, feel welcomed and enjoy great food.  The owners, Greg and Kim never forget a face and you feel like family by your second visit.  No rushing, no menus at 1st...they encourage you to relax and take your time.  Not sure I have ever actually read the menu as we always default to the Specials.  I end up with either the Bouillabaisse (to die for) Sea Bass or Halibut Piccata. Seafood Salad is a great way to start things off.  Seafood is always amazing here, incredibly fresh and perfectly cooked.  My husband loves the pasta dishes and always orders a meatball (on the side) as they are the best in town.  Save room for the mini cannolis, best I have ever had.  A nice bonus is Rombauer  Chardonnay by the bottle at a great price!
Comfort at it's best!"}
{"text":"Awesome Italian restaurant! Went here with my family and they loved it. Will go back time and time again. Also has specials daily!"}
{"text":"Eat here at least two--three times a month and its always awesome. Food, Bar, Customer service are great. 

Its a pleasure dining here. Lots of locals from Paradise Valley. 

Bar is as good a place as any to sit. 

KISS
Keep it Simple Stupid"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try a new Italian restaurant this past weekend and based on yelp reviews, I decided to go here.  We walk in and it has the \"family\" feel to it - real cozy and quaint.  It took some time for someone to even acknowledge us as it seemed like the people that came before us knew the employees/owner.  So we sat down and right away, I felt unwelcomed.

Service was slow and it seemed like no one wanted to service us.  While we wait patiently for some acknowledgement, water, someone to take our order, etc.  We started noticing that we were definitely out of place.  My friend and I are in our young early thirties, dressed nice, and ready to take on the night.  We look up and everyone (I kid you not) are a lot older, old couples, or friends that are all within the same age group.  The employees started coming up to most of them and they were all laughing as if they've known each other for years.  Then I realized that I truly do not belong here...  

We ordered calamari and the Black Garlic Shrimp & Sausage.  The calamari was good.  The shrimp and sausage was not.  No one even asked us how our food was.  It took forever to get our check.  No one said farewell to us.  
 
Ambiance is nothing like Federal Pizza, The Parlor, or any other restaurants on Camelback corridor.  Moral of the story - if you're older, then maybe you will have a better experience."}
{"text":"Went to dinner last night and had an amazing time. The service was perfect and the food was perfecto. I had eggplant park and oy it was Delish and my BF had the special and I couldn't spell it if my life depended on it but he loved it. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Friendly, great food and great attitude.

My boss and a client went to L'Ampore and didn't know what to expect.  What we received was excellent, friendly service and a great meal.  This quaint find was delightful and as we walked away, the words came out of our mouths, \"that is the way to run a restaurant\"!

The food: Each of us had a something different;  Gnocchi made with pesto (they don't have it on the menu but the owner asked the staff if they could make it fresh.)   Ravioli with sweet Italian sausage and steak.  All were cooked to flavor and perfectly.  

Even the wine was unique... \"If you see Kate\"... 

What a wonderful place with a great, take care of the customer attitude.  I will be back and I don't live in Phoenix."}
{"text":"spaghetti marinara with meatball - pretty good
cheese tortellini - pretty good
spinach and cheese ravioli - pretty good
classic caeser with chicken salad - pretty good
bread - very good
service - pretty good"}
{"text":"Been going here since Greg and Luigi opened the place years ago.  Greg now continues the tradition of offering one of the tastiest Italian classics with impeccable service in a very comfortable and slightly classy atmosphere (but you don't have to dress, especially for lunch).  I most always get the clam linguini which is to die for and if I limit my bread intake, but have ventured into the specials, notably the ciopini (sp?) and eggplant dishes.  Will return again and again, especially with my grandmother who loves Greg's \"attention\"!"}
{"text":"Have been back to L'Amore since my first review and things still as wonderful as ever.   This time I tried the seafood special, which was the Sole.   It was prepared just right with a great lemon caper sauce.   The salad and sides included with the dish were fantastic as usual.   Can't wait to go back here again and again.    Just so you know they sometimes have specials on \"Local Dines\" where you can get $40.00 voucher for $20.00."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Italian restaurant in the Phoenix area.  We dine here once a week.  Locally owned and operated, amazing entrees and impeccable service.  We take all of our friends to this restaurant and they become regulars, just like us."}
{"text":"On the last day of our week stay in Arizona, my wife and I had a date night at L'Amore. I used opentable to book a reservation earlier that morning. Within an hour, I got a call from the owner asking to confirm the reservation and to ask if it was for a special occasion. We got to the restaurant and were greeted by the owner and his wife. He remembered me from our phone call earlier in the day. We sat on the patio and were greeted by our waiter Tim. We were treated like guests in someone's home. We weren't rushed to order, they brought delicious bread out and gave us the specials right away. I ordered the cioppino  and my wife ordered the sausage backed Zitti. The food was amazing. The owners stopped by on several occasions to check on us. The owner even boxed up our leftovers. Very passionate about their patrons. From the sound of the other people at the restaurant, they get a lot of repeat business. Highly recommend this Italian restaurant. Very relaxing and never had to find our waiter. Great experience."}
{"text":"This was my first visit. We were seated on the patio at the table for 2 in an alcove. The food was spectacular and our waiter was attentive without hovering. Can't wait for my next visit."}
{"text":"This restaurant was an amazing surprise! In a strip mall ( which isn't that strange for the Phoenix/Scottsdale area) amazing food! Excellent wine selection! Full bar, great service, yummy bread, coffee, desert! We were there for lunch, dined outside on the patio! We will visit again when in the area! Thank you!"}
{"text":"It was our first time visiting this little gem of an Italian restaurant tucked in a strip mall on 32nd and Lincoln.  Christmas decorations were up giving a nice ambiance to the interior.  Our waiter was excellent...very attentive but not overly so.  My husband had the short ribs which came with a cannelloni.  Both were excellent.  I had the Gnocchi with Bolognese and it was the best i've ever had.  We will definitely dine here again!"}
{"text":"best place in town. Incredible service and to die for food! Perfection"}
{"text":"Just had a really nice dinner here with Cousin Jean. We each had the seafood pasta special thing and was really excellent. Service was just right also. Nice setting and seating inside or out in a shaded patio. Was a bit warm so we opted inside. Just right here and I would return."}
{"text":"This is great place to eat whether it's just to get out for a while or to celebrate something.  They always have several specials on the wall so you do not need to consider just the menu. Also as other people have said the owner is always making sure everyone is enjoying themselves.  The wait staff is also there to make sure you understand the menu and have a good time."}
{"text":"What a great dinner! We wanted to try a new restaurant to celebrate our anniversary and decided on L'amore. What a treat! Owners Kim and Greg met us at the door and treated us like special family. We found we had Ohio in common. The service was great and the food was amazing! The drinks were generous and the tiramisu was the very best we ever had. All in all we will definitely recommend this gem of a restaurant to friends and will go back often. Thanks for making our evening memorable."}
{"text":"The place is wonderful. The owner Greg is very involved and makes you feel welcome. Great Happy Hour and wonderful deals on the Happy Hour menu. The cappellini pomodoro is the best in town. Also the sea bass is to die for."}
{"text":"I like to hit this place up for happy hour. The small plates are amazing. Love the sausage and peppers, the calamari, the mussels, and pizzas. 

The staff is great attentive and friendly. Check it out"}
{"text":"We came here for our anniversary had an amazing experience. The food amazing! I would recommend the lasagna and tiramisu both delicious. Perfect romantic ambience for a date night. We will definitely be back soon. Thank you!"}
{"text":"First time dining there last night.  Eggplant Parm was great although prepared differently than most.  It came looking like a piece of lasagne which the waiter did describe.  It was very tasty and had a little crispness on top which I like.  Linguine accompanied the dish and it was cooked perfectly.  Marinara was excellent.  Add some cauliflower and brocolli and it was a perfect dish.  A small field green salad was included although the salad was nothing special.

My wife had a special which was sole with a lemon caper sauce.  She raved about it.  Hers also came with linguine and some sauteed spinach which looked great and tasted great, too.

Atmospher was terrific.  Dark, warm and friendly.  Service was terrific.  Greg the wwner circulates and greets all his guests.  Many knew him so he must get lots of regulars.

Singer/keyboard in the lounge at 6:45pm so we only heard a little bit since we had to rush off to the Symphony.  But the performer was very good and NOT LOUD which was wonderful.  Just some night background music that seemed to match the older age of the customers.

We've driven past this place many times wondering what the food was like.  Glad we bought a Local Dines deal which was our incentive to try it out.  We'll definitely return with or without a coupon.

Two entrees, two glasses of wine, 1 cup of coffee = $90 (inl. tax and tip) before coupon."}
{"text":"I'd give 4-1/2 stars for food and 5 stars for service and $$$-$$$$.  Our seafood specials were outstanding.  Seafood cioppino with fresh baby octopus, scallops, shrimps &mussels fantastic but they don't tell you it's almost $40.  I had fresh grouper picatta also fantastic served with sautéed fresh spinach and linguine nearly $30.  Cesar (a la carte) delicious but did not have anchovies. We don't drink but the bill was up there.  The service there is outstanding.  Waitress extremely attentive.  We sat outside and you had a peek of the mountain.  Inside appeared upscale (bordering on stuffy) to me.  Bottom line highly recommended for the superior food but be prepared for moderately high prices."}
{"text":"Wow!  This place is incredible!  One of my coworkers has recommended this place often and wow, she was so right!!  We sat at the bar and had the happy hour small plate calamari (which was the perfect size to share to start) which had the PERFECT texture; it was chewy but not too hard with just the right amount of crisp.  And the red pepper sauce it was served on was divine!  
For dinner the man got the Linguini with Fresh Clams and I got the Chicken Parmigiana upon the recommendation of the bartender.   Both came with a choice of soup or salad.  I got the house salad, which was a simple mix of iceberg and field greens with shaved carrots and a roma tomato slice with italian dressing on top (that had just the right amount of acidity) but upon tasting his soup (it was lentil tonight) I was a bit jealous.  The soup appeared to be a broth base with chopped vegetables and lentils, not a thick too-much-lentil type of soup.  It had great flavor without being overpowering.
Now for the entrees.  Wow.  When they came out, my eyes popped.  When I smelled, my nose sang.  When I tasted, my mouth weeped.  We had asked the bartender if the clams were just in the sauce or if they were in the shell.  When he said \"both,\" we expected two or three whole clams with a smattering of clam in the sauce.  Boy, were we wrong!  There were 10-12 WHOLE CLAMS atop a garlic and white wine sauce FILLED with chopped manila clams.  
The Chicken Parmigiana would have made Sophia Petrillo of Golden Girls relocate to Phoenix!  The sauce was THE FRESHEST, most flavorful, not too wet tomato sauce I've ever had.  In. My. Life.  And I've had my share of tomato sauce, let me tell you!!  The chicken was moist and I'm not sure how the breading didn't get soggy by the last bite, but it didn't!!  The mozzarella cheese on top was melted to perfection.  The plates were served piping hot and we didn't let that slow us down!  
The beers were ice cold to the last drop as well, which is a necessity in my book.  The only critique the man had was that they could have a better selection of beers (he likes heavy craft beers).  
We will d.e.f.i.n.i.t.e.l.y. be back.  It is a bit pricy, but it's worth every cent!  And happy hour is a great value.  Draft beers are $3, glasses of wine and well cocktails are $5 and they have a selection of \"small plates,\" which are smaller portions of their appetizers, but with the entrees being so incredible AND coming with soup or salad (and don't forget the bread with some balsamic vinegar and olive oil!), you definitely won't leave hungry!  A+++!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. Wine prices are reasonable and they have some very good wine available. Owners are always onsite and available to say hello and just check that all is well. Music a few nights a week but same guy all the time."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for lunch and sat on the patio. Service was quick and friendly and the food was delicious (ordered the soup of the day and the pasta pomodoro; my date ordered the Tortellini). This would be a nice place to come in the evening for a date. No complaints whatsoever."}
{"text":"Happy hour at LA Amore is the best.  Outside dining and a scaled down menu lends itself to a reasonable yet delicious meal.  We ordered calamari, bruschetta, and a caprese salad for starters which was ideal for sharing. ..to finalize we ordered the margarita and sausage flatbread....yummo. Intimate for conversation and surely a lovely experience..."}
{"text":"Cool place.   Food was great and service was some of the best I've received in Phoenix.   The only drawback was it was warm in n the restaurant.  But I'm from CA and most places are a bit warm for me.  
I highly suggest giving this place a shot!"}
{"text":"Great family owned Italian restaurant! When you first get there, don't worry if no one is there to greet you and seat you. The owner personally seats everyone so it may take a bit.

The night we went, there was live music which wasn't too loud, which allowed us to have a nice dinner conversation. 

At the recommendation of numerous Yelpers, we got the veal Parm and the cioppino. Wow, I sure was glad to have gotten these dishes. Both were delightful and were wonderful! I couldn't even finish the cioppino because it was massive! Let me tell you, it's even better the next day  for leftovers!

Oh almost forgot.... the bread.... oh goodness the bread. It was warm, chewy and fluffy. If I could just have eaten a loaf by myself. 

Service was attentive and very knowledgeable. Overall a five star experience. Can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant! Great owners, great staff, great food!!! We took our family of 5 including 3 kids along with friends of ours who have an infant. Felt like family! I'll come here every time we're in Phx."}
{"text":"Food = 5 stars! 

Service = 1 star. :( 

To be fair, the owner and hostess were extremely friendly, accommodating and humble. 

Just our waiter had some issues..."}
{"text":"Best Italian restaurant by far! The owners Kim and Greg are there and friendly the staff's service is great really loved the food. By far the best cappuccino ever!! Go try this family owed place you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and well worth the wait when they're crowded. Probably the 'hidden jewel' of Italian in all metro Phoenix and offers a wonderful atmosphere of fine dining with a very friendly, down-home staff. I'm 100% Italian from the East Coast and still have a hard time finding good Italian food in Phoenix....but this restaurant certainly can challenge!"}
{"text":"Excellent Italian food made from scratch. After each serving the manager came by to see if it was properly made and tasted as described in the menu. It was a truly unique experience in dining."}
{"text":"Great Hidden little Gem! Great food can be pricey $$$ small great romantic atmosphere. I loved that I could change anything in the menu. They really cater to you! Definitely a older crowed but its the Biltmore area (what do you expect) ."}
{"text":"Like Natalie's review below, it has been years since I have been here. It kind of fell off the radar and I have no idea why! 

The service was great. I love the family atmosphere here. The food was incredible - and then the prices were 30% less than I would expect for that quality of food. Seriously - this place will never fall off the radar again.

We had two specials that night: Short Ribs with Canneloni (maybe the best canneloni I have ever had) and the Red Snapper in a lemon piccata with a side of linguine.  Perfection!  And not to mention the part about rarely finding good, fresh red snapper in the desert...  That is one of my favorite fish.  So glad it was on special!"}
{"text":"Extremely good service! I went here for my birthday and they were very nice and accommodating. The owners were very lovely and sweet. The food was very good too!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is truly a gem to have here in Phoenix.  Everything they serve here is fresh, beautiful, and well constructed.  The owner, Greg, is the nicest guy you will meet and he goes out of his way to treat his customers in such a humble and hospitable way.  He also has a standard set for quality at the restaurant that cannot be beat.   The white anchovies they serve are special ordered by the owner from somewhere in Europe I presume, and are unlike any others I have tasted, fresh, delicate and not very salty at all.  The meat dishes and seafood are amazing.   The fish is fresh and wild caught.  In particular, the shrimp and scallops are the jumbo kind, not the cheap stuff,  which the owner also special orders.
         When eating here you feel as if you should not be able to get such quality fresh food in Phoenix, particularly the seafood dishes.  The sauces are the best I have had, the red sauce is orgasmic.  Plates are artfully constructed and beautiful as they are yummy.  Prices are not cheap, but you get what you pay for, and on that note the value is quite apparent here as they do not skimp on anything here to save money.  Portions here are big.  You really feel you are getting great value with the amazing food they serve here.  Raviolis are so thin and delicate. Yum. 
        Great wine, great atmosphere, great service.  If you are looking for VERY authentic Italian food in a charming and romantic setting, this place truly can not be beat.  Check them out, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Right when we walked in, we were greeted by the owner, Kim. She was very friendly and attentive- made us feel right at home! Our server was excellent and service throughout our meal was consistent and great. We had three different meals and all were delicious! We will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here today, and what a beautiful little restaurant it is.

Fettuccine Alfredo was perfection, the salad and bread were top notch, the service was impeccable, and the atmosphere cozy. My friend had the Halibut (I think it was a special) and it looked amazing.

I will definitely be back for dinner soon.

L'amore is located at 32nd and Lincoln, on the South West corner."}
{"text":"Food and service are always phenomenal. We go out of our way to eat here more than once every time we're in town and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Responding to the lies someone just left: First, we had a pleasant attitude. We didn't smell the menu, that's a lie. We asked to be moved because I had asthma in the one room. I doubt the hard as a rock bread is raved about.  The caesar was mostly vinegar, maybe someone messed it up that day? The portions we got were very small, not large.  Maybe their dinner portions are big? I opened the take home box only ONE time and the tab broke. I had to cover my ears and said to several people (it was several because the first people that came over wouldn't help)  when they came over in a normal tone of voice to please lower the loud pounding music. When we left we misplaced the keys, my mom went back in to find them and found them.  The car wasn't running with no key in it!  We had no problem leaving the parking lot, no sharp turns, driving slowly, no door flew open that is a lie. We had the worse service here, especially the owner screaming at us."}
{"text":"First let me preface this review with the fact that it was late when we dined there, about an hour before closing. 

The service was fabulous. Best service I've had in some time and very professional. 

I ordered the Linguini with Clams and my husband ordered Spaghetti Bolognese. Both came with either soup or salad. The soup was good, the salad was very over dressed - the dressing was great, just way too much of it on the salad.

The Spaghetti was good, and the Bolognese sauce was nice and flavorful & a bit spicy. The pasta was more than al dente, but still good.

Unfortunately my dish was not good. There was a very small pile of way over cooked linguini under a very healthy serving of clams. I don't mean the pasta was just a bit over cooked, it was totally mushy & broken into little pieces. I wouldn't serve
Linguini in that condition at home even on a week night in a rush!

The clams were swimming in sauce - which I was kind of excited about - I love lots of sauce. But the sauce was bitter. Perhaps from cooking too long, I'm not sure. It was just very sharp and bitter. 

My husband wanted to send it back, but the kitchen staff had apparently already left per our waiter. 

I ate about half of it - only be aide I was so hungry. And there wasn't really any other option if the cooks were gone.

We were still charged for the dish, which I didn't think was appropriate. 

Not a good experience."}
{"text":"A nice find in Phoenix. Good menu, something for everyone. I had Gnoochi which was terrific, others at my table had chicken, veal and salmon and all enjoyed their meal.  The wait staff is nice and attentive and they don't rush you out.  You can linger as long as you want. I imagine it would be very nice to have your meal outside on the patio but it was a little chilly the night we were there. Yes I would return for sure."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our first visit.  We were greeted by Victor, who is very friendly.  Later the owner Greg came around to make sure everything was good.  The food was great. We will be back with our friends."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal.  Dinner was delicious.  It really is a family owned business - the husband and wife team greeted us at the door.  They clearly love why they do because they walk around the restaurant and talk to their customers.  It was so good that my picky eleven year old daughter finished everything on her plate.  Mellow ambiance and not noisy at all even with live music.  They even allow partial servings because their portions are enormous."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place forever. It look so nice outside and super fancy. I'm thinking to myself yessss a reason to dress up for dinner. So. Guys. Ready? Boyfriend surprise me here for dinner. I was soooo excited. As we walked in. We waited five minutes to be seated. We sat all the way in the corner, and there were probably four tables that night. So empty *hmmmm* 
I ordered the spaghetti with no meat sauce. And I could of swear to you that it was Prego brand sauce. No joke!
I asked for napkin. He came out with brown paper napkins for me. Like really? This is a wine, white cloth fancy place and you come out with brown paper napkins? Okay. 
The waiter was so slow. I was annoying and kept asking the bust boy for water. He was more helpful than our actually waiter. So sad."}
{"text":"Had reservations for 2 at 6 pm on a Friday evening.  We were greeted by both owners and seated immediately. We were one of maybe 8-10 tables. Within 15 minutes the restaurant was full and bustling. Atmosphere is white table cloth classy but not pretentious. Took Yelp advice and ordered the Cioppino from the specials offered.  For about $35 I enjoyed a huge oval dish of rich tomato broth chock full of exquisitely cooked mussels, clams, scallops, shrimp and fish - all over linguine and with plenty of bread to soak up the broth. The calamari was too tough to eat , the linguine was over cooked, and the dish was tomato paste heavy. I did not care because on balance, the dish was deliciously phenomenal. Took home enough for two other meals. 

Companion had the special of beef short rib and cannelloni. My goodness. It was heaven on a plate. The short rib was not fatty but was melt in your mouth tender with a slight sweet and smoky flavor - about $25. The cannelloni was a bit salty but delicious. Again, we had food to take home.  Soup/salad course was unremarkable which in hindsight is curious given the attention to the rest of the dining experience. 

Service was very attentive even if not especially friendly.   We found it noteworthy that at least a dozen parties were greeted like old friends by the owners (who never stop moving and attending to guests during service).  Music was mostly standards, pleasant, and at a volume that comfortably allowed conversation. This is clearly a neighborhood favorite.  Will be our new go-to Italian restaurant. 

Don't be fooled by the outside while driving past on 32nd or Lincoln. The curb appeal is apparent only while up close in the parking lot.  Total bill including tip but without wine/cocktails was less than $80.  A very fair price for the quality and service provided."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Makes me feel like an Italian mama is cooking me dinner. The food was flavorful, well presented, and tasted truly authentic. The owners were amazing and knew everyone's name, she even hugged us on the way out saying thank you and she hopes to get to chat and spend more time with us soon. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"We haven't seen better in Phoenix...Drink prices,wine list are reasonable for a white table cloth restaurant.  Food is excellent, comes out quickly.Service was very good on a busy Saturday eve .Meals are priced 11 to 30 bucks..Seafood is fresh..Better call for reservations"}
{"text":"L'amore is a wonderful Italian restaurant on the corner of Lincoln & N 32nd St. I was treated to a mind boggling amount of food for a holiday event hosted by Kiss Me Kate. The service by Sal reminded me of a quintessential New Yorker. Quick with a funny line, excellent timing and dressed in black. (Black pants, but still. In New York we wear black.)

If you read no further, remember this: Cioppino.

Chee-oh-PEE-noh

The dish is not on the menu for some reason. If you gaze upwards to a chalkboard you might notice it. Come hungry, or come with a date, but everyone should order this.

Chee-oh-PEE-noh.

A seafood stew, complete with scallops, calamari, shrimp, clams, mussels and a white fish. (The white fish varies on a nightly basis.) My palate was delighted to order it Fra Diavalo. (I heard Fra Diablo, but that was close enough. Hot. Spicy hot.) This entire medley is served on a bed of linguine.

L'Amore has been owned and operated for 13 years by Kim and Greg. Greg was beyond attentive to our table. If you look around the restaurant their passion for riding horses is evident.

The lighting is subdued but yet the mood is festive. This is where you bring friends and family. Any guest will be impressed. Live music is played on the bar side which filters over softly to the dining area. Sal, our friend, was able to balance a large party with infinite ease. When the Cinderella hour rang we left begrudgingly.

Chee-oh-PEE-noh."}
{"text":"The best Italian restaurant I've been to since I lived in Italy. Greg and Kim are the owners and took great care of us and made sure we had a good time. Highly recommend to anyone willing to pay a little extra for the service and amazing food."}
{"text":"The husband and I went to L'Amore for our last anniversary. I made the reservation mentioning it was our anniversary. When we arrived, the restaurant was mostly empty and we opted to sit in the bar area because it was still happy hour. Their hh selection of drinks is....Let's say, limited. Obviously this place is not a bar, so I wasn't expecting a large specialty cocktail list or anything, but this place did not have a cocktail list at all, making ordering a drink that was included in hh difficult. For example, I asked about an amaretto sour, and the waiter checked only to find out they don't have a well amaretto....We kinda went back and forth like this (you know, basic ish drinks like a sidecar...) Until I finally settled for sangria (which was clearly poured straight from a bottle and not mixed with fruit or juice or anything to make it much more than crappy red wine). 

To start, the husband and I shared the mussels. This was the weirdest thing....The mussels were fine, a little on the fishy side (unlike at say little Cleo's or other 'nice' restaurants), but they came with no bread..... They were literally in a bowl full of tasty garlic, white wine, and butter sauce and you have to pay extra for bread! I was very surprised. For dinner, I had lasagna and the husband had gnocchi. They came with soup or salad. For the price, none of it was all that great. I've had equally good or better lasagna for less than half the price at other local establishments. The portions were not huge, but certainly large enough. We ended up taking some food home (and they even packed up my leftover mussel sauce which I did appreciate). 


Here's where the really annoying part comes in. This restaurant never acknowledged our anniversary despite my having special noted it on the reservation. They didn't even say 'happy anniversary' let alone offer a dessert or anything to make the night special, and we spent about 100$ on dinner (which is insane given the quality we received). Although the food wasn't bad, I don't think I would return here and definitely not for a special occasion."}
{"text":"We have visited L'Amore only twice now, but both experiences were absolutely amazing! The owner greeted us both times. The customer service was excellent and the servers make you feel welcomed. We both had the Fettuccine Alfredo, which was also excellent. 5 stars all around for L' Amore!"}
{"text":"Really great food and the service never fails. They pour great drinks and for what you get the pricing is fair. Be prepared for it to be a zoo on special occasions, however it's worth the crowd to have their pasta."}
{"text":"I love my food here. It's a beautifully appointed place with a lot of wood door jam appointments. The bread was one of the best I've had in a restaurant. My food was great. My waiter was pretty good. When I'm in town, I look forward to going back."}
{"text":"That food is great!! I have had several dishes and they were all amazing, especially when comparing to other premium restaurants of the same type. 

Service is very good. 

Location is a little out of the way but in a very quaint spot. I love the interior and they have a great patio. 

The only negative is that it is so far from my home... I'd like to visit it more often, but the distance will not stop me."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and very kind people. We had to leave early for feeling under the weather but they were very attentive and supportive."}
{"text":"An incredible gem! Thank you Yelp for directing us their way. Kim and Greg were the perfect hosts. Reminded us strongly of our New York roots. Cioppino was undeniably the best I've had since leaving New York. The Calamari was perfectly crispy and my husband absolutely enjoyed his linguini in red clam sauce. The evening was made
Even more memorable to us by the live band on the premises serenading patrons with classics. Great evening! Thank you Kim and Greg! It would be a sin to be a resident of Phoenix and not have visited this beautiful restaurant! Will definitely be back when in town."}
{"text":"i really like this place, very relaxed and friendly, i love their tomato and avacado salad and their gnoochi,"}
{"text":"Holy Cow! This place is such a hidden gem, and I'm just glad we found it!
To start things off the service and general level of Care that is present in this place is enough to earn them 5 stars, then when you add in the quality and level of excellence that their food offers... Well done deal this place rocks. 
The sea bass is out of this world and just about everything else is as well. 
5 STARS YELPER's. Check this place out. The owners who actually run the business will probably go over and introduce themselves. And they're just as great as this place is."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for our anniversary and absolutely LOVED it. Everything about it was great. We made a reservation online a few hours ahead and when we arrived to the restaurant we were seated immediately. Promptly after sitting down, we were greeted by the owner who was so welcoming and kind. The service from both the owners and the waiters were top notch. Our waiter was Sal and he was super helpful, especially since we are from out of town. He filled us in on the best places to visit in the area and also gave great suggestions from the menu and wine selection. The food was great- I had the gnocchi with chicken while my boyfriend got the baked ziti with sausage. On top of the great service and great food, the ambiance was awesome with live music and all. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone in the area looking for great Italian food!"}
{"text":"Pleasant experience! First time here, I found the atmosphere welcoming and the staff very friendly. They have a nice patio facing the parking lot, it reminded me of my hometown Milan. Food was amazing!! Had a glass of Benvolio Pinot Grigio, nice and sour, the special of the day Chicken provolone, and I ended my meal with a tiramisu. I have to say the tiramisu really won my heart!! So fresh and creamy. The service was also exceptional, Octavio took great care of me. I definitely have to come back to try the pasta!!"}
{"text":"I adore the owners of this restaurant, Kim and Greg, and L'Amore is home to some of my favorite Italian food in the valley. 

This is a lovely little place. Both the decor and ambiance are classy and invitingly warm. I also have to say I am impressed at the level of service every time I come here. What a gracious, attentive wait staff!

I particularly love patio dining (when weather permits) with all of the beautiful trees that line the outside of the restaurant. There's a very sweet, romantic vibe here that I really love. This is a perfect spot for date night.

The food is excellent as well- love the bruschetta and pizza. Also I'm a notorious calamari hater but somehow, I can enthusastically grub on the calamari they make at L'Amore? It's just that good I guess!"}
{"text":"We have been to L'Amore several times now and it is one of our very favorites.   The food is wonderful, the ambiance is perfect, and the owners and servers are such a delight.   We found this little gem by looking on Yelp and we are so glad we did, because it is now one of our very favorites.  We look forward to many more evenings with family and friends at L'Amore.  Thank you for great food and delightful service.  We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Valentine's Day lunch.  We were seated by a delightful gentleman that everyone in the place knows.  Salad Royale for me, Ceaser for her.  Scallops on mine were off the chart.  She ended up stealing mine!

She had linguine and clams.  We are searching for adjectives to describe how fantastic...and that's probably it.

If we lived here, I would have the Gnocchi Bolognese every time I ate here--which would be often.  Indescribably delicious.  Soft, velvety...and the best Bolognese other than hers!

Cannoli out of this world.  We will return!"}
{"text":"Simply the best Italian food I have had in Arizona. Greg and his staff are super attentive and the food is without equal. Highly recommend this establishment. One visit is all it takes."}
{"text":"Greg and Kim are the owners and are so warm and inviting from the minute you walk in the door. My husband made reservations to celebrate my birthday while we were visiting Scottsdale. I felt like we were celebrating at a friend's house. The musician sang Happy Birthday to me when they brought out dessert and everyone in the bar sang to me :-) 

Even better than the hospitality is the food. I had the cheese ravioli which is homemade and unbelievable, super light and delicious. My husband had the chicken piccata which had a great lemony flavor with sides of pasta, broccoli and carrots. The service was impeccable , attentive but not overbearing. Wish we lived in Phoenix so we could stop in every week for dinner!"}
{"text":"Just passing through town. Found this place on yelp
 Ordered the best chicken marsala i ever had
."}
{"text":"Had the clams as an appetizer large portion and was delicious. The tortellini was creamy sand delicious. Would eat here again"}
