{"text":"Not a fan of this location, since they do not honour promotions that all other Quiznos honours. I recommend the location at Adelaide and Yonge."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Quiznos for a long time, but have repeatedly been disappointed by this Etobicoke location. One of the best things about Quiznos is the buffet-style condiment bar full of pickles, peppers and various sub sauces. I've been to this location several times, and have never once seen the condiments out... you have to ask for a container of sauce or pickles, and the staff never seem pleased to accommodate.    I've also been over charged at this location: My last visit, I ordered a sub and opted for the drink/chips combo. The clerk charged for the drink and chips separately, and not the combo price until I asked her to correct it. OK - I know it's only a $1 difference, but really... if you're not going to honour the menu, don't offer the combo as an option. I've also been charged for a 12inch when I ordered a 9inch sub.  The lack-lustre service, under maintained bathrooms, lack of condiment bar (pretty sure they need to have this component as a franchisee) make this location a no go. Save your money and go to Subway down the street."}
{"text":"I was treated so incredibly ignorantly by the 2 women who were working here today that I will NEVER set foot in this location, or any other Quiznos location for that matter. Walked into the location for a late lunch, after seeing a posted outside for a steakhouse sandwich. The poster said \"roast beef, peppercorn sauce, mozza cheese and au jus sauce\" Sounded good to me. I went up to the counter and ordered the sandwich, and was asked by the lady making it if I wanted gravy, to which I replied no I just wanted the au jus sauce as listed on the poster. She sent my sub through the oven, and another lady took over making it. This lady asked me if I wanted any gravy or sauce with my sandwich, and I repeated no, just the au jus sauce thats advertised with the sub.  When I go to pay, the lady asked if I wanted a combo, I replied yes. She rings me through takes my money, and walked away. I asked for my au jus sauce, and my drink cup, only to be told that the sauce was an added charge, and that I never asked for a combo. When I mentioned that the posted made it seem like the sauce was included, both women got very beligerent, and made a huge fuss out of something that wasn't my fault. Upon asking for my sauce and the combo, the woman charged me almost 4 dollars extra for everything. I was not impressed to say the least. To make matters worse, I asked for a number to contact their store manager, and was told bluntly that I was just going to complain, so I wasn;t going to get that info...... not cool."}
{"text":"In the tradition of full disclosure, I never really liked Quiznos that much anyway....I'm more of a Firehouse or Harris Teeter Hoagie guy, but the other day I was hungry on lunch and decided to give them a try.  The Roast Beef and cheddar looked pretty good.  But it wasn't.  It had a weird sort of taste, and with every other bite or so I would notice these odd little mushroom bits...you know like the canned mushrooms, and the seasoning and added flavors were not to my liking.  Not to mention the after effects....uggggh...never again Quiznos....never again."}
{"text":"The problem i have with Quiznos is that it always feels like the owner/operators just had a meeting with their staff about how to keep food costs down.   It could be a good sandwich, but the ingredients are so sparse it just doesn't feel like I'm getting my money's worth. The sandwich maker weighed my chicken on a kitchen scale so delicately that it felt like i was buying raw gold. Like really, is that extra ounce of chicken going to break your profit margins?  It's cheap, but not in the sense that benefits the consumer."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and decent selection. There's something so nice about a toasted sub that adds a level of texture to a meal.   Staff are very helpful. I was looking for something and staff noticed me and offered a solution. (Other places, staff might have returned to their private conversations and ignored me.) This place really took care of me!   Update: I just had to add how FRIENDLY staff are! I will go out of my way to come here, if not for the great food, then for feeling so welcome!"}
{"text":"Excellent service! Sandwich brimming with freshness! Happy to frequent!"}
{"text":"A review for Quiznos!? Why not.  We came here with a group of 7 in the middle of the lunch hour madness which might have seemed a little too overwhelming for the staff because they kind of messed up on some of the orders, only slightly.  One order asked for no mushrooms but they included them, luckily it wasn't an allergy reason and just by choice but could have been a disaster. Another order was mistakenly taken by someone else and Quiznos temporary ran out of the ingredients to make the sub.  No problem they were awesome and started giving us free stuff to make up for it.  Seeing that all I saw on TV about Quiznos was their commercials for their lobster and seafood salad subs I had to try it. I really liked it might even order it again.  The lobster and seafood salad was literally spilling out of my sub because it was so overfilled. They hooked it up by giving a few of us free drinks or snacks.  They also hooked it up by giving one of us an extra FREE large sub with triple orders of all meats.  The sub was ridiculously HUGE and tasty looking.  They were fast, friendly, and clean. They treated us way better than what you'd expected from a typical chain and did everything to make sure we would come back.  Next time I'm here I really want to try this chicken sub, the picture was on all of the tables and it looked good."}
{"text":"Two words....Chicken Milano!  I'm not a big fan of Quiznos they're just too expensive for a toasted sub, but I have no problems opening the wallet for this toasty treat!   A great sub with chicken, sun dried tomato and basil pesto, plus the trimmings are definitely something to smile about......give it a try, I'm sure you'll agree:-)"}
{"text":"Often imitated but seldom duplicated, Quizno's is the originator of (fast food) toasted subs.   The Honey Bourbon Chicken is one of their \"Classic Subs\" and practically the only one offered without cheese or a mayo-based sauce (for those looking to go a little healthier). The good news is it's pretty tasty and has a more flavor than the chicken breast sandwich that Subway offers as part of their low-fat menu.   This shop gets an extra star because of its awesome pickle and pepper bar. I always grab a few jalapenos on the side. Yum!"}
{"text":"Huh? What happened?  I use to love quizno's because it was warm and toasty but its not so crispy anymore.  Is it just this location or did they change the recipe?    Order: Large three cheese and beef on rosemary parmesan.  Nothing really terrible,  but not as good as i remember. Cheese didn't melt enough and bun wasn't crispy.    Verdict: good for quick lunch as long as you have a coupon, but not a lot better than Mr. Sub or Subway."}
{"text":"Sub was pretty tasty but lacked the garlic butter that a beef Swiss melt usually has. This location not only lacks the condiment bar, but they also lack the lemonade!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible service, and what kind of salad is that? $3.49 for a half cup of shredded lettuce and a tablespoon of dressing mmmmm"}
{"text":"The subs here are good and much cheaper than they used to be. I choose this as an option every once in a while over Subway. They'll toast your sub unless you ask them not to. They used to hand out a little packet of yummy hot peppers on request but I haven't seen those lately. Decent but not remarkable."}
{"text":"it is fine, nothing special. service was ok not great, had to ask twice for mushrooms on grilled flat bread sandwich."}
{"text":"A rather disappointing day in the history of fast food. Usually I am not one to complain about fast food...if you choose to eat something cooked in less then 30 seconds with absolutely no tender loving care you should naturally expect it to taste like muddy cardboard.  However, the monstrosity that I experienced a few days ago was absolutely unacceptable. I would probably hold it up in the same category as the weird milky, jello, orange peel concoction my 94 year old great grandmother used to force feed my siblings and I whenever we visited.  After trekking through the rough, bitter cold,  snow ridden terrain of Yorkville, I found myself ordering my usual Mesquite Chicken sandwich from Quiznos...Extra jalape√±os and banana peppers on the side (One of gods many great gifts to man). Normally I would finish eating and then go back to my daily routine; babe watching out my window, eating gold fish crackers and playing hang man. However, this time I found myself laying on the cold stone office floor, wincing in pain with cold clammy hands, imaging I was feeling similar to someone dying of a horrible disease  like scurvy. After spending the latter part of my day running back and forth between my garbage can and bathroom, I decided to call Quiznos in hopes of possibly saving the next poor unfortunate soul who stumbled upon them, the same fate as me.  After spending a good ten minutes speaking to the employee (no apology, no assurance the rest of the chicken would be checked, & no compensation) I frustratedly hung up the phone. Quiznos, you have lost a great customer. I would not recommend this place to anyone unless, you are looking for a quick and easy way of offing your annoying significant other without having to worry about evidence being linked back to you."}
{"text":"Always so friendly and welcoming! We come here probably twice a week between my husband and I. Food is always great!"}
{"text":"good sandwich's good prices...i dont understand why they keep going out of business"}
{"text":"I always come to this branch after work around 8:30 pm, they close at 9:00 pm but they are always welcoming and nice. Very lovely staff."}
{"text":"I have been to this location multiple times. It is average in terms of Quiznos as quality is not always there with the sub being undercooked multiple times."}
{"text":"Came with the fam on Sunday and there were 2 guys working who didn't know what they were doing! I used to work near here and came here pretty often for lunch, so either this shift was just messed up or this location is going down hill. The guy didn't know how to ring us up - the order taker we couldn't understand. Overall...FAIL!"}
{"text":"I am a fan of quiznos.  Adding this place to my lunch routine because A) it tastes good and B) its cheap!"}
{"text":"A very regular Quizno's. The service was pretty standard. I'm not typically a big fan of Quizno's food, but I had a coupon, so that was a determining factor in coming here for lunch. I tried the Buffalo Chicken sandwich and it was pretty tasty. Overall, a vey regular experience for Quizno's."}
{"text":"Meh is right on for this Quizno's.  Mmmm... Toasty just doesn't cut it when the quality of meats and veg served on the bread is below par on most visits.  Prime rib sub that was a mass of gristle and fat.  A Lobster and Seafood sub that tasted like a Salt and Seafood sub.  Cucumbers that had seen much better days before they wound up on my sandwich.  The saving grace.  When they have Clam Chowder as a soup choice, it's actually pretty good!"}
