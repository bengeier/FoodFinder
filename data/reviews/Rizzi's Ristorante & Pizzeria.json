{"text":"Somewhat overpriced and average. Pizza is decent. Their fried chicken is pretty good (salty) and \"those potatoes\" are your typical Jo Jo's. The pasta dishes are sub average and way overpriced. Ice cream is typical from what you'd get out of a machine."}
{"text":"Overpriced. Lousy attention to detail. I ordered delivery at 11 PM. 1145 the driver called me and asked me why I wasn't at the Hilton. I had told the person who took my order that I was at the Holiday Inn and she read back the correct address for the holiday Inn. $26 for veal parm a styrofoam cup of side salad, and a coke. The food quality was a little better than Sbarro at the rest area the mall. At that time of night I was happy to have it. By the time it got to the right hotel it was still warm but not hot. The veal was tough and covered with a gooey glob of cheese. I know how tough it was because the cheap fork couldn't handle it. No knife was provided. I had to use my hands to tear it apart and it was not an easy task, far from tender. The sauce was not sweet, which I appreciated, too many places think sweet sauce is a thing. Any kind of Italian flavor was pretty muted. More robust garlic could be had at Olive Garden. Italian dressing was better than Kraft but not as zesty as Newman's. After eating this meal with a flimsy fork and my fingers, I was also pleased to discover that no napkins had been provided. No prices were viewable on Yelp's display of their website. 

2 stars for being ok at 11pm when most better options were closed."}
{"text":"The only decent pizza that delivers to our house. Good sauce, lots of cheese and not skimpy on toppings. Kids love the Italian fried chicken and Jojos ."}
{"text":"Before I ordered I looked up recent reviews of the establishment and all of them recommended the fried chicken..so I ordered that and of course the pizza because it's Italian!! When I received the delivery I was disappointed! The hype that the website reviews gave were way beyond what I had gotten. Fried chicken had no flavor and was over priced! Speaking of prices, the smallest pizza I ordered was about $11 and it was super small! I may try to get pasta next time just because they are Italian and can't possibly jack up pasta of all things! So we will see how that goes! Also, I did try the ice cream and that was beyond delicious!"}
{"text":"We ordered lunch today, we always order lunch and the gnocci was raw. We called the young man that answered  was rude, said there was nothing he could do. I then called back and was put on hold and no ever picked up. We are in their system and not 1 person called us back.  Will never order there again."}
{"text":"This place is just as good as 20 yrs ago! Nothing beats this anywhere. They even have custard. Please eat here as you will never be the same as the chicken melts in your mouth and \"those potatos\" are addictive! Try it out."}
{"text":"The pizza is so delicious!  You can have it delivered,  dine in,  or pick up. They even have a pickup window!  During the summer,  top it off by stopping by their ice cream window for some inexpensive ice cream."}
{"text":"Great place! My favorites are the huge Meatball subs, Jo Jos and Chicken Parm Dinner! Every time I'm back in Copley we order from here"}
{"text":"Best pizza around with a convenient drive thru pick up window. Always great quality and great service time in and time out. Have been loving this place since I was in high school in the 80's. With all the other Italian/pizza choices around Rizzi's stands well above the rest."}
{"text":"Pizza good, service absolutely awful. 10 minutes to get menus, 15 minutes after that to get beverages. I suggest getting your food to go"}
{"text":"very good pizza. service, not so much. 

had lunch with coworkers earlier last week. we ordered the special - pay for one large, get a small cheese free. Ken is a 4 year old when it comes to his tastes so he had the cheese and Sean and I split a large w/ pepperoni and sausage.

as i said, the pizza was actually really good. but, our server was either overwhelmed(?) or out of her element.i ordered soup. i heard they might have been out of soup, but not from our server. if they were, she never said anything until after we ate then only apologized with no explanation. 

not a big deal. i would go back despite this small issue."}
{"text":"Another great pizza that was promptly delivered even on a busy evening! Very consistent service and food! Hope it continues!!"}
{"text":"My only complaint is that this place is too close to where I live so I order too often and it's showing in my waste line. Rizzis has the best pizza in the area and I actually hardly ever find anything to compare to it anywhere we go. Their Italian fried chicken is also absolutely delicious that is seasoned just right. \"Those potatoes\" are simply Jo-jos or potato wedges. While they are great, they aren't really anything different from what you would get elsewhere. My absolute favorite thing to get here is the chicken Parmesan sandwich. I always get takeout but have eaten there once. Restaurant is small family place that is very clean. Love rizzis!"}
{"text":"Best fried chicken around. Jojo's are also excellent. Really can't go wrong with anything here."}
{"text":"The pizza here is very good, with a tasty garlicky crust. The Italian fried chicken is excellent. I order delivery from here 1-2 times per month, and I have to say the people on the phone suck. If you do order by phone DON'T give them your credit card. They do not key in your CC number while they talk to you, they write it down. So any Identity thieves reading this, be sure to go through their trash, it will be a bonanza."}
{"text":"Best place in Akron for custard. Perfection. Absolutely love this place. Food is great too! Well priced too."}
{"text":"Just love the pizza and chicken... And Jo Jo's....... Always delivered hot!!! The best!!! Been eating it for 45 years. Always excellent!! I recently added this pic to my family fame wall... because it is a part of my family!!"}
{"text":"The pizza was alright, the chicken was great. I did not care for the primavera pizza. It looked like they just put some of those mixed bag frozen veggies on there. It was expensive as far as take out pizza goes. They did deliver it quickly. I would get again for the chicken the pizza not so much."}
{"text":"This is our go to delivery place. The fried chicken is the best in town the jo-jo's are on point as well.  When ordering the pizza we found the small cooks up better then the larger sizes and if ordering pasta the plain sauce is better then the meat sauce. The garlic bread is pretty good and the meatball sub is just alright."}
{"text":"Favorite pizza in Summit County!  And love that they still serve it the same blue pizza boxes.  Love their crispy pepperoni."}
{"text":"Get. The. Ice. Cream. 

They have the traditional soft serve flavors of vanilla and chocolate, but they are huge!!! Definitely worth the price (and the price is cheap!)

As for food, the oversized sub is always a great choice and the jo-jos are awesome... But try the provolone sticks. We love them! The sauce that comes with is delicious as well."}
{"text":"I'm from Copley and have been eating Rizzi's food since I was very little, there chicken is nice and and juicy. Plus the pizza is delicious its nice and fluffy, baked nice and crispy. They sell ice cream from a window, it's cheap and good. Rizzi's have delicious cheap Italian food, you can sit down out side in the summer, sit inside, or go home and eat. I recommend it to anyone in the Copley area to come try it."}
{"text":"Rizzi's delivers to the Courtyard in Akron.

I'd skipped lunch, so I was starving for dinner.  The hotel recommended this pizza place, but said the chicken was dynamite.  I was leery of ordering fried chicken to be delivered to me, imagining it steaming in the delivery hot box for 45 minutes, but I must admit that I was very pleased with my dinner!

'Italian Fried' chicken was still crispy outside and juicy inside.  The Super Snack is two chicken breasts, 'those potatoes' and a roll, for $7.  Chicken pieces were large, with plentiful meat.  Not sure why people'd go crazy for their potatoes - they're just wedges.

I've also tried their Mini Pizza for One, $4.50 for one topping.  Good enough pizza that I'd be willing to get it again... but it'll be hard to top their chicken.

Other menu items include full Italian meals, like Linguine with Clams and Eggplant Parmigiana, various pasta dishes, salads and sandwiches."}
{"text":"Pizza was pretty good, albeit a little over priced, but good nonetheless. My order was ready in 15mins and the girl at the counter was nice. Overall it was a good experience and I'll probably be back again soon to try the chicken."}
{"text":"I was visiting our Fairlawn office and they had Rizzi's delivered for lunch. I can't speak to the pricing since it wasn't my dime but the pizza was great. We had a meat lovers, a veggie and a pepperoni mushroom pie with a couple salads on the side. The pie was fantastic. I loved the cook on them...pretty much perfection and the crust had a little chew with a crisp outer....definitely worth trying again."}
{"text":"I can't speak for the fried chicken, it's not really my thing. However, I tried the pizza for the first time today. There just wasn't anything exciting about it. The toppings were generous but probably from a can. I would skip the side salad next time, it was just lettuce in a soup container with one tomato and one onion ringlet. The Italian dressing seemed homemade and was the highlight of the meal. If you are looking for a place to feed your family that's family owned, this place is great. But, if you're looking for a pizza to rave about that your friends and family just have to try, this probably isn't the place."}
{"text":"Mmmm yes there sausage pizza is super good and I love there sauce!! also give there caramel malt a try because it so delicious. Service was not that fast but there were a lot of people there and the waitress I had was very nice"}
{"text":"Rizzis has been a family favorite of ours for years for both their ice cream and pizza.  However tonight the treatment received but what I can only assume is there manager was pathetic.  Anyone who has ever been to Rizzis knows that the  the service at the custard window is hit or miss.  It can be very quick or VERY slow.  However the young women who work the window are always very polite and we have come to just except the slow service.  This evening after my daughters band concert there was a line inside and outside.  It was a bit chilly so we decided to go inside for our ice cream and jojos, which we have done several times before.  After standing at the counter for about 15mins with zero service....not even a \"We will be with you in a minute\" A man came out of the kitchen with a bag of peanut to give to the young ladies at the custard window.  These young ladies were working very hard and were quite busy.  The man however was doing a lot of wondering around and was quite agitated for what ever reason.  One of the young ladies asked my 9yr old what he wanted and he responded that he wanted a small twist. As the young lady was taking his order the agitated little man walked past her and pointed to the sign on the freezer and said if we were ordering ice cream we had to go outside to do it.  The \"MAN\" then walked away leaving this young lady to deal with our family who now has waited in the restaurant for 15min for service and has been told to tell us to go outside and wait in the lengthily line that has formed in the 15 min we have been waiting.  To that \"man\" I say you are a tiny little man and obviously a coward.   I tried to speak to you to ask you a question and you turned and walked away.  If you hate your job take what I can only assume are you plentiful knowledge of pizza and find a new one.  There is no need to be rude to me or my children.  There is no reason to try and enforce a rule by telling the busy young lady to do it and they run away like a little boy.  I was a paying customer and you were a disrespectful angry little man.  You have lost us as customers.  We will take our business to Welches or to Stricklands."}
{"text":"fried chicken was pretty good, although a bit over-seasoned (salty).  no complaints about anything else, delivery was quick and food was hot."}
{"text":"Best pizza fried chicken and spaghetti in the Akron area. Interior needed updating 15 years ago so now it looks like a retro classic 80's pizza shop. But it's still worth it. They also have an ice cream window.  Low prices and friendly staff."}
{"text":"The little guy loves his chicken & jojos so that's what we went with for his bday party. 
Not a fan of the chicken nor the jojos. Wonder when the last time was that they changed the oil in their fryers.
And it wasn't cheap. $30 for 20 pieces of jojos and 20 pieces of chicken, I'm better off just making it at home."}
{"text":"Love coming to the ice cream window after baseball practice! The cones and shakes are perfectly priced. Take the whole family without breaking the bank!"}
{"text":"The rating is based on their food only .. Their pizza and Italian chicken dinner meal were pretty delicious!! But not impressed with their service... it took our waitress forever to get us refills and take our orders when they weren't really busy ... if we come back here I wouldn't mind trying the other stuff they offer I'm sure it will be great based on how their pizza and chicken were.."}
{"text":"I have been going to Rizzis (Fairlawn Towne Centre) and other locations since 1972 and their Italian fried chicken is to die for.  We have recently moved back to the Copley area and started going here every Sunday for dinner - and still get the chicken dinner!  We substiture the jo jo's for french fries.  The french fries are really really good!  They taste like how Swensons fries USED to taste before they changed them.  The salad was excellent and loved the garlic bread.  The service was great - our waitress is really friendly."}
{"text":"As does the previous reviewer, I like their chicken as well.  It actually has excellent seasoning in the breading.  It seems all too common that places that fry chicken think dropping a thigh in breadcrumbs then a deep-fryer is enough, and it just ain't!  They also serve a reasonably good lasagna and spaghetti.  My gripe is they appear to be under a depression era mind-set about  what they advertise as  \"their\" potatoes.  
The last time I checked restaurants have historically tried to fill up their clientele on cheap carbs, namely bread and potatoes.  
The people at Rizzi's think that three of \"their\" wedges of potatoes, locally called jojos is just right to accompany an eight and a half dollar two-piece chicken meal.  Jojos are simply potato wedges that are roughly the  equivalent of three french fries in size  that are often dipped in a batter and deep fried.  They are quite good and as Rizzi's uses the same seasoning on the potatoes as on the chicken also quite flavorful.  My question is, if you got nine french fries in your order of french fries would you feel a bit cheated?  Well that's how I felt, when I got my three jojos and as that is their standard serving, it's how anyone eating them feels! 

 I actually mentioned this to my significant other who had wisely ordered the lasagna, (they apparently don't count out the noodles for it in a like fashion) and she relayed how she had once before ordered a chicken meal with the potatoes and was ticked enough she actually called to complain and was told in a very dismissive manner that was their standard portion and goodbye.  That might in part be the reason why at Sunday during the luncheon hour when I picked up our carryout order, the parking lot was devoid of customers.  

Yes Rizzi's they are \"your potatoes\"  and when your doors close as a result of your stinginess they still will be yours.  Too bad the food's pretty good."}
{"text":"Best Pizza in Copley/Fairlawn area. Their prices are reasonable. Also they are good with delivery times. They don't keep you waiting too long! We order here all the time. They also have other menu options. their burgers are delicious"}
{"text":"There is no way that is frozen custard; I am pretty sure it was ice milk.
I strongly suggest you try the frozen custard in Northfield on Rt 82 - NOW that is real custard!"}
{"text":"We were in the area and wanted to grab some dinner. We absolutely could not believe $2.95 for a pepsi and the same for iced tea. $6.00 for 2 beverage! Salads do not come with the meal and still ordered. Simple lettuce and some onions with their homemade italian dressing. The garlic bread does not come out before the meal.. yet it was prob worth the wait as it was really good. Hubby ordered pasta with plain tomato sauce. He had to order 2 meatballs on the side.. I had ordered gnochi with plain tomato sauce. The sauce was really good. there was way too much sauce to ea dinner.  Overall very average and the bathroom is on the outside of the building.I really wanted to love this place. We will try and come back to try the pizza."}
