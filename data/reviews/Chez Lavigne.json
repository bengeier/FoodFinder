{"text":"Phenomenal place, waiter had great suggestions for wine pairings. Went here relatively long ago, close to when it first opened, so menu has changed.

The rack of lamb, carrot leaves, and foie gras dessert were highlights. Essentially ordered everything off the menu with a large group and nothing was amiss.

One of the nicest atmospheres I've eaten at. Amazing in warm weather with the large windows open. Intimate setting in the evening. Wonderful service, great dining experience. One of Montreal's highlights."}
{"text":"The presentation is good. Dishes are freshly made. Appertizers and desserts are ok but main dishes are salty! The resto is a little bit empty for a friday night maybe because the menu has only 4 choices of main dishes. Prices is reasonable..."}
{"text":"We had the poisson du jour, and it was fantastic. Even a bok choy was included. Very flavourful and a fantastic presentation. 

Terrific service as well. Good wines. Looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Our waiter Jessie was wonderful and helped us taste the entire menu for our group of 5. 

Really liked the Chicon wine as or pairing (tastes similar to a Chianti). 

All his suggestions were spot on -- highlights were the blood pudding sandwiches, the capelatti and the lamb. The dessert with Foie Gras was very unique and made it a great way to top off our meal.

All the items are organic, and almost all the food  here is locally sourced from Quebec where possible.

The place itself is beautiful and has windows that open up when it's nice outside. Make sure to visit this place now before it gets super busy in the summer -- this place will definitely be a hit."}
{"text":"Went here for New Year's Eve dinner which was 6 courses with wine pairings. It was incredible the food was amazing the most tender lamb shank I have ever had in my entire life. Everything had amazing flavor and opened my eyes to trying many new foods. The wine was amazing and went really well with all of the dishes. The owner was incredibly nice and remembered me from our phone conversation when I made the reservation. His girlfriend was our waitress and was equally as great. She paired all the wines with the food and was super excited about it all. This made for such a personable experience. Both of them checked on us multiple times throughout dinner and made a great experience ringing in the new year. Beautiful decor and lighting etc etc. Great location and easy parking. We promised them we would be back to watch a Bruins Habs game with them and we definately will! We will be back everytime we come to Montreal and I really wish the owners the best of success!!"}
{"text":"Très belle sélection de vin, et des plats qui accompagnent bien le tout. Excellente qualité pour le prix, dans une atmosphère conviviale et décontractée. Je vais y retourner!"}
{"text":"I have walked by this restaurant in our neighbourhood a dozen times, and finally some friends suggested we go eat there. I can't say enough good things about this restaurant, I don't understand how it's not overcrowded with patrons. We were a table of 7 and we received great service, amazing food, great variety, great atmosphere, great wine list....

This place deserves to be known and to have their creations tasted by people who love and appreciate a creative fun menu. I truly hope they get their name known. We practically tried everything on the menu and every dish was well prepared and tasted great. 

Give this place a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Last night's trip to Chez Lavigne was a total success.
The music was fun and unpretentious, our server was super attentive and friendly and the space is absolutely lovely. Oh and the bottle of Spanish Cava was fantastic.

The only shortcoming I found was that the food was just OK- because they have a restaurant license we ordered edamame and oysters; both were pretty standard fare. I'd reckon that maybe investigating in some of their dinner fare could be more eventful.

I wasn't aware, but the entirety of Chez Lavigne's wine list are natural wines. All of which are super reasonably priced. They also seem to have daily specials making the wine bar experience a bit more accessible. Seriously a great and chill wine bar, especially for natural wine enthusiasts.
(Also a great date spot!)"}
