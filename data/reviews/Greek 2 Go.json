{"text":"Food was delicious! We had the chicken souvlaki for two and the portions were generous. We ordered online for delivery. We waited about an hour from ordering to delivery, but it was worth it. The only downside was the delivery driver. He didn't say anything, just handed the bag. No hi, thank you...nothing. Other than that, it was a good experience."}
{"text":"I ordered the Halifax donair fries and the chicken souvlaki. The donair fries did not have the tomato and onion as described - it was just potato WEDGES and dry donair meat (no sauce even!) the rice was bland, meat dry. When we picked it up, the man said \"no English\" when I started speaking to him - not even trying to communicate! Very weird experience and I wouldn't return!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I come here very often since it's on my walk home and I have never been disappointed. I usually get the chicken shawarma combo that comes with a shawarma, fries and a pop for around $9 including taxes. 
I have also tried the gyros and the gyros dinner, both delicious and worth the price ($9-$12)"}
{"text":"Just okay. 
Ordered take out from here on justeat. It was rated 4/5 stars in just eat. 
We ordered the chicken souvlaki dinner and a chicken souvlaki wrap with side potatoes. 
It was just okay in taste. The chicken souvlaki dinner came with one stick of chicken for 11.99, a small salad, two little pieces of potatoes and rice. The portion was quite small for what I had expected in comparison to other Greek places we've had. I wasn't a huge fan of the rice. It was very soft with nuts or something in it. Not too much flavour either. 4 little pieces of chicken which was actually best in taste. It was tender and juicy. The potatoes were okay but extra small portion. And the salad was Day old, somewhat soft and overpowered with onion flavour for being in a container all day. Wasn't the Best But it didn't have bugs in it like someone in another review wrote. 
Souvlaki wrap was okay. Mediocre. Super onion tasting. 


Overall cost was $34 and change. Wasn't really worth the cost. It was mediocre. Wouldn't order here again but it's not terrible."}
