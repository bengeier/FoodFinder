{"text":"Food is always good and have been there multiple times. Its a family run business so they treat you well.  Thali curries are different everyday. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"It's a new place in the same plaza as Fredericks and La Jawab. The menu is mostly Indian food but also serve some Mediterranean food (souvlaki) for some reason.  Started with the pani puri which was decent but a bit pricey. $4.99 for 7 pieces. Also had the small chicken tikka which was obviously not cooked in a tandoor and seemed a bit under cooked.  The masala chai was just drip tea, which was really disappointing.  This is mostly a take out place but it's no reason to serve food for eat-in customers in paper plates and styrofoam boxes.  It had a cafeteria feel to it."}
