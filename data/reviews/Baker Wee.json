{"text":"Before I start, I have never used yelp but this deserves every bit of my attention. First,  I am embarrassed  to admit what took place and that we though they screwed up and lost our order. We had a baby shower last weekend for our daughter and ordered cookies that were to be done and available to be picked up by 10:00. We sent our other daughter to pick them up. Long story short they were not ready, & in fact they couldn't find the order. They were extremely apologetic, they offered to rush the order no charge and even delivery them. The girls were upset but OK. They delivered these wonderful cookies on time and at no charge. Not only did they apologize again but they also gave us a free chocolate covered strawberries. A little while later my wife received a call from the bakery and wanted to know what time we were planning to pick up the cookies we had ordered. Yup that's right we sent our daughter to the wrong location, wrong BAKERY. We screwed up. Full circle - these were the most expensive cookies I've ever eaten but that's what you get when you order from one place, pay for the cookies and donate them, replacing cookies from another bakery. Having to pay double and only get half of what you ordered. For the record I called Tuesday morning to Baker Wee Bakery when they opened and explained the situation and mix up. Most importantly for fear that someone could get fired. They were very appreciative and thankful for my call and we ended up paying for these additional cookies. Two things, 1) they were delicious cookies, 2) even when the customer is always right they may not be. But what a great experience, they went out of their way to deliver an Exceptional Excellent Customer Service Experience. They jumped through Hoops, didn't argue or dispute our claim and went ABOVE & BEYOND what they needed to do. What a First Class Bakery and group of good people. We will be back and tell others what a great experience we had, that is -  now that we can Laugh about it. Thank you again Baker Wee Bakery for the great service."}
{"text":"Bought a cake for our outdoor Sept. Wedding!  Staff was super friendly and helpful.  The cake was beautiful and so so delicious.  Thank you Baker Wee!"}
{"text":"Incredible. Best cake I've ever eaten. Incredible attention to my unique patterns and design. Extremely moist that you couldn't get enough.  I was married in October 2011. The venue gave me 2 choices of bakeries I could use that are included in the package deal I paid for. One was a fancy schmancy bakery with a french name, many impressive flavors (at least that was on their on-line menu), and just all around looked like a fancy bakery. The other was Baker Wee. First, I don't care for cake. I went to both bakeries and was SO impressed with Baker Wee and very disappointed in the fancy bakery. The fancy bakery lied about all the flavors they carried and REFUSED to let us taste the flavors we were interested in. They brought out the 4 most popular flavors of cake recommended by other people that we had 0 interest in. Really? They would also only do 2 lines of filling in each tier. They also had an upcharge for design, # of guests, and size. They refused to make a small 3rd tier for the top of the cake based on my # of guests and wanted to charge me a fortune for it. This fancy bakery nickeled and dimed us, were late with our appointment, and we couldn't even taste the flavors we wanted. We then went to Baker Wee. Awesome! We made 2 tasting appointments with the owner, Laura. We got to taste all flavors. The cake was very very good. They had numerous fillings to choose from and they also did 3 lines of filling in each tier, not 2 like the other bakery. Laura agreed to make the top 3rd tier for FREE, and even though we were just under the guest count we gave her, she didn't charge me at all for extra cake. We chose an incredible red velvet cake with 3 lines of filling for the two big tiers. 2 lines were raspberry cream mousse and the other line was a white chocolate cream mousse. Outstanding. The smaller top tier was a chocolate cake with fudge filling and 2 lines of white chocolate cream mousse. Great! My design was very unique and difficult. Each tier was different. The overall theme was black, burgundy, and silver. This was not a standard wedding cake by any means.  I had unique, detailed patterns on each tier. She even added extra touches for free like sparkle dust and a fondant ribbon with our initials. When I saw this cake done at my venue, it was amazing. It looked exactly like my picture. It had incredible detail. It was butter cream on the outside, but was so well done, it looked like fondant. When we ate the cake, it was by far the best cake I have ever had. It was super moist and exceeded the taste testing. This cake was so good, you just couldn't stop eating it. Baker Wee exceeded all of our expectations. They didn't charge for the extra tier like all other bakeries would. It was the most moist, delicious cake I've ever had."}
{"text":"Stopped in here this morning to check it out and try some baked goods - after reading other reviews, I thought it was a good choice.  I really wanted to try a couple of cupcakes to get a feel for cake quality and frosting before possibly ordering a birthday cake for an upcoming event.  There were no cupcakes on display, but they were quick to offer to frost a couple that were ready in the back.  This how they earned the one star I am giving  - nice to offer to go in back and make me a couple of cupcakes.  All they had ready were the 2 basics - chocolate and vanilla - so I opted for one of each frosted with their buttercream (I was offered buttercream or whipped icing).  They came out decorated with a very basic swirl, but that was fine with me - I care more about the taste anyway!  Tried both when I got home - the chocolate cake was so dry it just completely crumbled all over the plate, and it had no chocolate flavor - just a dry, brown cupcake.  The white was a little better texture-wise, at least it held together when I cut into it!  The flavor of the white one was fine, but nothing to dream about.  The thing that really made me sad, though, was the frosting!  It was called \"buttercream\" but I am pretty positive it should have been called \"Crisco cream\" because it tasted like crisco and sugar - no vanilla, no butter.  It was terrible!  I am sad to say I will not be returning to Baker Wee.  I know others have had better luck here, and maybe I just went on the wrong day, but I will just have to continue my search for a good local baker."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Baker Wee!  BW is local, easy to access, and open extended hours compared to most independent bakers.  Their bar desserts (lemon bars & brownies) are the best in Phoenix.  Their Lemon bars have a fantastic tart and sweet contrast while their brownies are rich enough for a chocolate snob.  BW produces individual sized treats in less common but still  favorites, like pineapple upside down cake and carrot cake, or sometimes Key Lime Bars.  The baker recently introduced a new treat she calls Dream Cake, which is amazing. The Dream Cake is similar to a Hostess Ding Dong, only much better!  My favorite \"cake\" is made by Baker Wee, the Turtle Chocolate Muffin.  It manages to pack an incredible chocolate fudge punch without being gooey or becoming chocolate glue-paste in the roof of my mouth.  When I have overnight guests, I always try to get t BW to purchase some pecan rolls or cinnamon rolls.  Their breakfast rolls are oversized for an individual portion, but when shared by 2-3 people they make a wonderful addition.  Unfortunately, I don't recommend their donuts.   I'm not a fan of their \"fancy\" cakes, I find that they just don't taste as good as the individual portions.  My husband order my birthday cake this past year, and it was a tiny bit disappointing.   However, in 2009, my friend ordered a gluten free and sugar free cake from Baker Wee which turned out better than I expected.  The kids that work for the Baker (Lori?) are nice, but if you place a special order, double check on it.  They want you to be happy, but they aren't perfect, and they definitely don't care as much as you do about your special event/order."}
{"text":"Baker Wee ruined my wife's birthday!  Did you know that their cakes are three days old when you pick them up according to owner, Sienna?  My wife and I have limited time together for her birthday which I took off of work for and Baker Wee has now ruined it.  I called them because I just picked up a cake for my wife's birthday today to enjoy quickly before she goes out of town for five days.  I brought it home, put candles on it quickly and we tried to cut it... TRIED!  It's frozen!  It came out in frozen chunks when we got a knife through it.  Sienna's fix was for us to drive the pieces of the cake all the way back and they'll make a new one after explaining it takes three days to make it, first day to bake the cake, then cool, then set the frosting and a third day to decorate it.  Had no idea we were buying a three day old cake or we wouldn't have paid $50 for it knowing it will be trashed before she gets home from her trip.  Sienna said the cakes had to be moved Sunday and she thinks someone accidentally put it in the walk in freezer instead of walk in cooler.  She admits the mistake but doesn't seem to care she ruined my wife's birthday so we will never be returning!!!!  No refund for ruining the birthday cake - nothing!    Don't use Baker Wee unless you have a back up cake!!!"}
{"text":"I can't buy cakes anywhere else since first dining on the cakes at Baker Wee. Nor can I eat any other doughnuts. Everything's too delicious. I'm actually picking up a cake tomorrow and am dreading trying to avoid buying brownies or eclaires. True statement."}
{"text":"Sweet little local place with extremely friendly staff.  No frills. Some stuff is good, other things not so much. I recommend the coconut macaroon & the cranberry orange breakfast muffin."}
{"text":"Thank you Baker Wee! I have a VERY happy 7 year old! Fabulous!!!! Well worth the drive from the East Valley. GO!!  Update: 12/11/2016-As wonderful as always!! Thanks Baker-Wee."}
{"text":"Had time before work the other day and happened to be in area so I stopped in.  Got a sandwich for lunch and it was very tasty.  Came with pickle spear and cookie.    The smell of the baked goods called my name so I had to check out the display cases.  Yum, yum!  The black and white cookie is the best I've tasted so far and the eclair was to die for.  I bought a couple of iced butterfly cookies and gave to a co-worker who thanked me several times.  Will definitely go back when in the area.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The cake had amazing flavor and looked exactly like we asked for! Delivery was on time as well!!"}
{"text":"This is a cozy little place for meeting.  My sister and I had a quick cup of coffee and split one of their generous apple turnovers.  It was the perfect pick me up treat to get through the late morning.  The service was excellent and the food and coffee were perfect.  In addition to the sweets and cakes on display, they have a table with an entire portfolio of notebooks that demonstrate their artistic competence in cake-making for any occasion.  We were not disappointed at all - go support this wonderful bakery!!"}
{"text":"I love the Baker Wee! We moved to this area and decided to try it out for a couple cupcakes. We walked in and could not believe the amazing selection. We were a little overwhelmed, but one of their employees stepped in and explained EVERYTHING to us and even let us try a couple cookies. She was incredibly nice and helpful. We didn't even get any cupcakes. We got a few thumbprint cookies, chocolate covered strawberries, a cream horn (oh my god!) and a dream cake. We had desserts for a few days and had people over just to share with us. Everything was incredible. We have gone back at least 4 times just for the thumbprint cookies. Those things are dangerous! My only complaint is they have very strange hours."}
{"text":"This place is GREAT!! I got a couple of cakes here for BIG event and Laura (the owner) never lets us down!! I always have people from my parties asking where i get my cake from..and they LOVE it!! Her flavors are amazing!! Whatever you want on a cake Laura will do anything to make the cakes just what you want. She really takes pride in her work and it shows!! My bf recently threw me a surprise party and he went and got me a zebra designed cake with yummy amaretto filling and whipped cream topping!! it was mmmm GOOOOOOD!!! =P Highly recommend this place!!! : )"}
{"text":"Yes the Baker wee! I do love their breakfast sandwiches and coffee! If you are in the area go get a croissant sandwich with ham and cheese. Man o boy is it good! Plus Their name is funny!   Great B-day cakes and stuff like that too!"}
{"text":"We had Baker Wee make sugar free cupcakes for a job fair for our business and they used our business logo on the top of the cupcakes. Not only did they look amazing but they tasted amazing. Would definitely recommend them and will use them again."}
{"text":"Best tasting cake I have ever had from a bakery! My mom went here for my law school graduation cake and it turned out amazing. The staff made sure it was what we ordered! I highly recommend this bakery!"}
{"text":"Very unhappy ! I had a cake for pick up on Saturday 27th for 60+ people. I place the order with the girl there and Laura because they needed to make sure it was possible. I got there and it was not done ! I asked the girl about payment when I was there the first time and she did not say anything.  I also have a cake set for July 11th ! I was told they called me several times NO one called me at all ! I had 60+ people at our home and I was there to get the cake at 1:15 and the party started at 2 ! I was told it would be done in a couple hours ! WRONG , my son was a intern there and we have always got out cakes there and they even did my wedding. No happy at ALL ! Rattray/McNulty"}
{"text":"very disappointed with this bakery I have been buying both of my daughters birthday cakes here for 5 years and we would pop in every now and then after school or on the weekends to buy cookies, they were the best and always so friendly but now there are new owners and they have been nothing but rude! I have no plans to return to buy anything from them! I understand change comes with new management but having yelling matches with an unsatisfied customer in the store when there are other customers in there is just down right unprofessional. I use to be able to go in and just buy a handful of cookies for my girls and the last time I went in I was informed very rudely that the new rule was you had to buy half a pound minimum.. I don't care that you changed the rule but don't make me feel like an idiot because I didn't know about the change.. bad customer service all around and i will take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"I had got my graduation cake from here. I had wanted them to put gold glitter on the graduation fondant cap and they only put regular glitter that you can barley see.... also the base that holds the cake I wanted that to be gold and it was white with glitter..Lastly I had showed them a picture I wanted a fondant diploma and it was just a regular small paper one. They had missed these details and details are important :( other than that the cake looks good."}
{"text":"Highly exceeded my expectations for my daughters birthday cake! They put such incredible details into the cake. We loved it! Thank you Baker Wee!"}
{"text":"Look this place great bakery great cupcakes awesome birthday cakes they do a fantastic job!!! I want to eat them every day!!"}
{"text":"Every visit to Baker Wee is exceptional! The staff is incredibly helpful and friendly. The custom order process is straightforward - very easy. We ordered custom cupcakes for my daughter's birthday and they turned out wonderful. They require you put custom orders in at least a week before your event, so there is enough time to prepare your product. We always see beautiful cakes on display in their refrigerator. Prices for custom cakes are very reasonable for a beautiful finished product. My husband loves their dream cakes and tea cookies. They also offer some breakfast pastries and beverages that look delicious."}
{"text":"The most delicious and beautiful cake! I wish I had taken a picture before everyone devoured it! I got a chocolate covered strawberries order. Don't miss out on these! Prices are reasonable and the staff is awesome!"}
{"text":"A-OK bakery.  Not overly impressed but not disappointed either.  Service was pleasant and the selection decent, just not stellar.  I'd go when in the area again but won't go out of my way or anything."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp and went in to buy a birthday cake last minute. Woman at front was very helpful and we left with a chocolate cake with Oreo mousse. Looked amazing but tasted even better! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is such a great bakery! I purchased a King's Cake for a Mardi Gras party and it was awesome. They were also able to make the cake for me with less than a 48 hr notice. How amazing is that!?! Take a look at the pic I took of it and posted it to the business site on yelp. It was super cute. And not to mention so tasty.   They also have a great selection of muffins, donuts, and cookies. And don't leave without trying one of their macaroons! They are orgasmic!!! What's not to love about the Baker Wee? I agree, nothing!"}
{"text":"L E G I T .  Legit is my own personal designation for a business that does thing the right, most perfect way. Baker Wee is completely and totally one of these places.  My sister-in-law first introduced me to their delicious wares... The cake I first tasted had to be a few days old by the time it got to me, and it was still fantastic. Then my nephew requested his birthday came be from Baker Wee, but we were gonna be outta town... Finally, my wife requested something tasty from Baker Wee for her birthday, and I was in charge of ordering it so I got to experience the FULL EFFECT.  Baker Wee is an old-school bakery, but they utilize new school techniques as well. For example, for my wife's Friday Night Lights birthday cake could have had goal posts made of fondant, but instead they used the tried and true pipe cleaner route, which made it that much better, and nostalgic. They have these binders that serve as their portfolio that are chock full of all the awesome stuff they've made through the years. The staff is beyond courteous and super helpful, and they know which of their employees to assign to your project with their respective, particular expertise.  When we walked up to the refrigerator case my wife's eyes teared up; she was so happy! The cake (double chocolate with whipped frosting, made up to look like a football field, with \"Clear Eyes, Full Hearts, Can't Lose\" on the base) was PHENOMENAL. it was so fresh and moist, sweet but not overpowering. Definitely some of the best cake I've ever had the pleasure of tasting. Plus, it was HUGE, like a 3 layer block of cake that would serve 35 people, and it was under $50! It's 5 days since the party and we are still chiseling away at the leftovers... it's gonna be real sad to have to throw it out.  If you need a cake made for a special occasion, or just want some delicious brownies, or cookies, or even donuts then you simply MUST check this place out."}
{"text":"Cardiac Solutions ordered 2 cakes for 2 different dates for one of our physician's that was retiring. One cake I had a pictures and knew just what we wanted. The other I knew we wanted our company logo on it... they had great suggestions and ideas and let me tell you they both turned out absolutely beautiful. Everyone was impressed visually and taste wise as well. Delicious and moist. Great job! we will be a returning customer!!! Thank you so much."}
{"text":"I don't know why I keep going to this place. This is probably the eighth time they got my order wrong. This time I requested a cake iced in whipped topping. Instead I got buttercream. And their buttercream doesn't even taste that good anymore. I need to find another bakery or do my own baking. Baker Wee just doesn't care about quality the way they used to. It's a shame."}
{"text":"This place is always busy so be prepared to wait a long time before being attended to. Also, they have NO sense of customer service...they are not rude, they just don't speak the language of customer service. But that doesn't matter because you will be satisfied with their fresh baked bagels, donuts, and other pastries.   What I hate about this place though is their outrageously overpriced sandwiches. They charged me over 7 dollars for some veggies and a piece of cheese on a piece of bread...no discount for vegetarian! Next door Blimpies is a better lunch option, by far.   The environment is not very inviting."}
{"text":"They made my son's first bday cake and it looked just as good as it taste. I was surprised that the 1st Bday came with a smash cake."}
{"text":"Love Baker Wee!  They did a fantastic job on our wedding cake.  The delivery was on time and the cake was delicious.  They even offer an anniversary cake for the one year anniversary.  We were not able to take them up on the offer because we moved.  I miss their yummy desserts!"}
{"text":"Baker Wee made my wedding cake and my wife's 30th birthday cake. Both were absolutely beautiful and way better looking than I would have imagined. I've been consistently floored by how great their cakes look and taste, and I can't recommend them enough. Thank you Baker Wee!"}
{"text":"I live out of town and ordered a special birthday cake for delivery to my Uncle in Phx.  One of the owners took my order and since I was out if town offered to send me a pic of the cake before they delivered.  They did,  the cake was beautiful and all reviews of the cake were excellent!  Great service and great job!  Highly recommended...."}
{"text":"Was in a mood for cupcakes and through Yelp I received a free one with a purchase so I got a brownie and milk I ate the brownie right away very good and rich loves the chocolate on top. Than when I got home I had the cupcake it was nice and soft and good. I do wish they had more selection of cupcakes but I do love that they have all kinds of bakery goods."}
{"text":"On our way home, hubby noticed baker Wee and suggest we pop in. After searching for the perfect desert, we decided on the pineapple upside down cake. It was 9.99 worth of gooey deliciousness. Although it was very deep for a pineapple upside down cake, the cake was moist and fluffy. The topping oozed down the sides and soaked into the cake for a sinfully sweet bite. Amazing!!!  I know I am basing 5 stars on one cake but it was to die for and the girl behind the counter was super helpful and friendly. I should just confess now....we bough the cake yesterday and it is already gone. Yep. Two people, one cake....it was that good."}
{"text":"Where have you been all my life? For the pastry snob that is used to delicacy type pastries, French and european, this place doesn't disappoint. From Eclairs and French horns, macaroons to cupcakes, I will never eat pastries from anywhere else again. And need a custom cake? They do that too; and better than any others I've ever seen. I will never have a dessert from anywhere else but Baker Wee now for the rest of my life. Quality, but affordable. Thank you for reviving my dessert taste buds!"}
{"text":"Not very many varieties of cupcakes available but the red velvet was very moist"}
{"text":"Bakery Wee created our baby shower cake, which was amazing!!!!  The taste was just as great as the looks!!!  Hoping to get our sons birthday cake done as well!!"}
{"text":"Hosted a baby shower this past weekend, and a friend offered to bring the cake.  She asked for suggestions on the cake and bakeries, and I've ordered a few cakes from them, and my daughter wedding cake was done by them, so I thought the baby shower cake would be good as well.  It was better than good, it was awesome!!!  They matched the picture that my friend brought in exactly, and the cake and frosting were the best I've ever had!  Will definitely be ordering more cakes from them!"}
{"text":"Ordered a smash cake for my son a week prior to the date needed. Went to pick it up and they never made it. They said the would quickly make it and it would be ready in 30 minutes. Over an hour later we were able to pick up a cake. Got home about 10 minutes before the party started. The taste was okay. Definitely not the same as this bakery used to be. I'll be on the lookout for a new bakery."}
{"text":"We wanted to have a tres leches cake for our Baptism party and considered ordering from the local mexican bakeries, but after hearing some good reviews on Baker Wee and knowing they were close to our home, we decided to give them a try! When I called to order the cake, the guy answering the phone was nice and helpful, though he wasn't sure if they could make a tres leches cake, so he had to put the phone down a few times to ask the baker in the back some questions for me. I asked for a simple design and greeting for the cake and asked that we could pick it up at a certain time. The day the cake was to be ready, we called an hour prior to the time I designated it to be picked up to see if we could get it a little early. They said it wasn't ready yet. No biggie. We thought we would try. When my husband picked up the cake, he texted me and said \"It looks great!\" When we served it at the party, the cake was incredibly moist, but not drippy wet like some tres leches cakes I have seen. I wish I had asked to have some strawberries in it (Or was asked if we wanted that). But, it was great and everyone at the party loved it. With the experience we had, I'll definitely consider ordering from Baker Wee again."}
{"text":"Holly Yummiest!!!  Just brought back Cake Bombs to my office.  Amazing!  everyone here is so happy.   Baker Wee has done my daughter's Birthday party cakes and cupcakes for years always a work of delicious Art!   I have to go now and fight off my team for a Cake Bomb!!  Thank you Baker Wee see you soon."}
{"text":"Good pastries, Good cakes, Good Coffee, Good Bagels, Good Cookies. On this occasion we had A cheese danish and an elephant ear pastry (flattened dough with cinnamon and sugar). What else could anyone ask for from a bakery?"}
{"text":"Got my wedding cake here... I've had their cake before, at other friends events, and thought it was pretty good. So we ordered a pretty small wedding cake. Enough to feed about 70 people. It was 2 round tiers, pretty easy cake right? That's the only part that wasn't wrong! All we wanted was Spackled on frosting, a few coral flowers on 2 different corners, and we wanted the frosting to be Ombré. Go from coral to gold. It was like a mustard brown that turned in to white... I'm really not sure what I'd call the colors of the flowers. So ugly... The reason I think this happened is because the day we went to pick up out wedding cake (my husband went to pick it up ON the day of our wedding....) he said they hadn't even started the frosting... He had to sit and wait for over an hour and wasn't able to take a shower before getting to our wedding.... I had talked to them the day before, and they confirmed that it would be ready at 12pm the next day. My husband left after 1pm with a very ugly wedding cake. I give them 2 stars because I know they can do better and I've seen it, and I think the people there are very nice, and their prices are pretty good! But our wedding cake... I'm just very disappointed... They are doing my friends wedding cake this weekend... I'll be interested to see if they get what they ordered...."}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered our wedding cake here. We saw this beautiful white 3 tiered pyramid shaped cake in a then really big Julia Robert's movie and really wanted that one. We went in to Baker Wee to see if they could make it. The owners were not there and we were told by the manager lady we spoke to that she will be the one making the cake anyway. She saw the movie too and knew exactly what cake we were asking for. We even made a 2D drawing of it, she wrote down her notes and took the order. She said she will rent the movie so she can take one more look at it before she makes it. Fast forward to our wedding day....we arrived at the restaurant where our dinner reception was and for the first time we got to see our cake. WOW! We almost fainted. I should include pictures because there's just no way to describe how ugly it was. The original agreement in size was a 12\" x 12\" square and 10-12\" tall, like I said pyramid. We got an 8\" square base, next layer 6\" base and the top layer 4\" base and the whole cake was 2 feet tall! It looked like a Chinese pagoda. The layers were on 4\" tall sticks. And the best part: it was airbrushed with brown color like marble and had brown 1/2\" diameter ball on the top.. -   Turned out, the owner (who has never seen the movie - or apparently a pyramid before ) ended up making the cake, never called us or the manager lady with questions, just tried to figure it out from the her notes. This was her understanding of it.  We were so embarrassed all night, everyone kept asking what the cake was supposed to be? We just kept saying: a snow white pyramid. Next morning we drove down to the bakery, furious. She said she will not refund the $300 we spent on it because she worked on it all day and she did her best. She said she was sorry and we can have a basic cake ($30 value) for free. We did get that cake a few week later for a birthday and never ever returned to Baker Wee again. It's very sad how greatly it impacted our special day. We should have demanded a refund but we gave up on the arguing back and fourth - it didn't change anything. After all we didn't want the money, we wanted the cake. So anyway, I would not recommend them if they were the last bakery, I  would rather make a homemade cake. I also wish there was a way to choose 0 stars on this on."}
{"text":"This is a mixed review. I'll start with the positive: We had a great experience w/ our cake tasting. The staff, especially Emily, were very nice and helpful. The pricing was reasonable and we did get a military discount. I had a discount coupon from the Bridal expo also but they could only apply one. All the cakes/cupcakes tasted great. They did a great job on the camo/flag cake. Negative: I had 2 separate orders that were being delivered together to the same place. I explained extensively that one cake was for the dinner on the day of delivery; the wedding cake and cupcakes were for the NEXT day that would be transported and set up by us. I was very disappointed that the ladies showed up expecting to set up our wedding cake and cupcakes all at the same time on the day of delivery. My wedding cake didn't have a box or anything to cover it over night. It was only a 6\" cake, so not that difficult to do. My MIL had to hold the wedding cake in her lap with nothing to protect it or her clothes all the way to the wedding venue the next day. They both made it w/o incident but the trip was much more tense than it should've been. As an added disappointment, it wasn't decorated the way I specified."}
{"text":"My thoughts and comments: Agreed with all the 1 start comments with our experience with Baker Wee.  We have purchased many items from here, special ordered cakes and cookies.  Recommended to other people and saw great results.  But this last time, and I mean last time my sons cake was the saddest cake I ever saw.  (Please see photo)  This place can make beautiful cakes we see them every time we go in, we have had beautiful desserts made for us.  It is simply baffling how you can go from Great to terrible in weeks.  Must be dependent on the baker you get.  Also agreed about no cake book just the one ipad.  All I can say is get it together Baker Wee you have wonderful potential just poor execution.    Adding my wife's thoughts, be glade this is not 2, 1 Star reviews  I have been a customer since 2014 and have always loved Baker Wee and recommended them to others. My previous cake orders have been great, so I was very disappointed to see my son's $70 birthday cake. No border on top, awful lettering, and obviously what I communicated about the photoscan placement did not translate properly. I asked that the photoscan not take the whole cake because it'd be nice to have room to place toys and write Happy Birthday... the order form said \"make photoscan kinda small,\" geeze I wish I noticed that she wrote that. Even so, if the lettering and bordering was done nicely- it would have looked so much nicer. I feel like I got the trainees working on my cake. I'm sorry, but trainees should start in the grocery stores (which I have bought cakes from many times and am much less critical cause I know what I'm paying for), when I order from a baker, I am expecting a professional.  The sad part is, we expressed our disappointment when we picked it up- they did add a border (which was sloppy) on top, but that was it, no attempt to fix the lettering, no apology, nothing. Maybe a manager was not around, but employees should be trained to express \"I am so sorry, we will have a manager contact you\" to an unhappy customer. I'm so disappointed.   To say the least we had a terrible experience no one apologized.  ***Bakery Wee it is up to YOU to contact US to make this right, not for us to contact you.  We were in the store and expressed our dissatisfaction and YOU did NOTHING."}
{"text":"Me and a coworker were traveling in the area and decided to drop in for lunch. We wanted a sandwich and debated whether or not to go here or Blimpies. We both has sandwiches which were decent, nothing outstanding. What makes this four stars in the bakery!!! We decided to share a carrot cake large cupcake, sooo AMAZING!! There were so many desserts to choose from! I will definitely be back if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I wanted a non-fondant cake for my sons birthday so I went to Baker Wee for the convenience of it. I have to say this cake was nothing better than Costco's and for double the price. The frosting was way too sweet and the raspberry filling was not impressive. Most likely will not be buying cakes from here again. Should have gone to Costco."}
{"text":"I went to Baker Wee for my sons 1st Birthday cake.  The staff was very nice both when I ordered my cake and when I picked it up.  I have given this place five stars not because of how beautiful the cake was even though it was very cute and fun, this place it's five stars because it was by far the best cake I ever tasted.  We ordered a marble cake with Oreo filling.  I mean it doesn't get any better.  Even the icing was great, not too sweet just right.  The only critique I have was the smash cake they gave that was free.  Can't complain too much because it was free.  But it was just so small that I couldn't see my son enjoying the whole point of a smash cake.  So although we were thankful for the free gesture we did end up buying a separate smash cake from a regular grocery store.  Regardless my family has found our new bakery!"}
{"text":"I ordered my wedding cake through Baker Wee. The cake was delicious, it looked gorgeous. It was a perfect cake but when it was delivered, our florist said there was a hole on the side of the cake so they had to take the flowers and move them to over the hole. I didn't notice anything looking at it from the front but once I saw the back I was able to see where the hole was. That's why I gave a 4 star eating BUT overall, I was pleased with the taste and the way it came out. Exactly how I wanted(other than the hole) I will definitely recommend them. My husband is very picky on cakes, and he loved the way it tasted also"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever.  I was clear, gave them picture references, color samples, 6 weeks notice, and followed up 4 times. I wanted something simple with very clean details, because it was basically a striped black and white cake with a heart on top. Stressed lines being the most important because there wasn't much detail. They were so confident and excited every time I spoke with them. We showed up and they clearly forgot about our order. They decorated it in the back while lying to us and keeping us waiting. Two and a half hours after pick up time they brought it to us and it was horrible. The baker was so rude and stressed it was perfect and had no idea what we didn't like about it. Almost ruined the party because we were there so long we didn't have time to set up the rest of the party. They insisted on full price and had no remorse. I only took one picture to send my husband and it didn't even show the horrible close up errors. Lines were stretched out and broken all over. The top was poking out and lop sided. It was sloppy overall. The heart was even totally wrong. It was SO bad and expensive, and I was SO upset. Never again. I have gone in the past and had great experiences but even the cake tasted dry. The overall quality has gone down. BIG TIME."}
{"text":"Best. Bakery. Ever. I have to drive over 40 minutes to get here, but it's 100% worth it. I hired Baker Wee to bake my wedding cake last year (it turned out beautiful AND delicious), and I just received my free anniversary cake from them this year. Even though the cake was free, they didn't skimp - they asked me what flavors I wanted, how we wanted it decorated, etc....and the cake was a decent size (enough to feed a small family)! Everything they make is so delicious, moist, flavorful, and fresh. I highly recommend Baker Wee for all your dessert needs!"}
{"text":"My daughter's cake came out amazing and tasted really good too!! I was kind of hesitant of some bad reviews on here but the ladies in the front were super nice and treated us well. They asked a lot of questions on the details/colors of the cake. My daughter loved the cake so it made me even more happier! Will be coming back"}
{"text":"This was my first time ordering a cake from here and it will be my last. I ordered a cake for a very special occasion, I asked for a beige cake with white flowers, pink and mauve flowers. The cake had RED flowers!!! Not to mention, the cake was not done well, there were air bubbles all over! When I picked it it, the employee said there were no managers. I've been trying to reach a manager and have had no luck. It is now 3 weeks and no call back. WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER! Save your money and go elsewhere. Please."}
{"text":"I am embarrassed to admit I have never eaten or ordered from Baker Wee, but I was referred to them after scouring Peoria and Glendale shops for American Flags to put on my cupcakes.  The gal had them, gave me 8-9 and didn't want a penny for them.  I'll never forget the gesture, the kindness and every time I pass by I tell my passengers how nice Baker Wee has been.  Thanks for the help and I look forward to coming in to try the baked goodness, sandwiches, et al."}
{"text":"From the ordering process, the pick, and the taste, we couldn't have been happier with the result of my mom's 90th birthday cake. She was mortified that we had to cut into it and destroy its beauty. Thank you Baker Wee for making it perfect!!"}
{"text":"Awesome, friendly, diverse, family feeling serve! Love all the staff! The food is the bonus!! Recommend the chocolate fudge thumbprint cookies or mini pineapple upside down cake!"}
{"text":"I cant seem to go any where else for special occassion cakes . The owner's name is also Laura, no its not me but they are a great family owned little place. Lunches are pretty good I have found for best selection of pastries and cookies is early in the a.m. go figure! There service is excellent I heart them. I will add my cake pics, they do an awesome job."}
{"text":"Normally they do an excellent job on their cakes but this time they obviously did not care. I ordered a specialty cake and was very disappointed. The lettering was very messy, there were thumb marks, the decorations were very poorly done...it was clearly slapped together. The cake was 1 hour late, and no one cared to apologized as I waited. To top it off they put it in the wrong color board. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good.  The cakes and cookies are pretty scrumptious.  I don't know if I've ever had anything else but a few different cakes from here, but it's a great place to go.  They even have sugar free stuff.  I've never had any, but from the stuff they make with sugar, I think it would be pretty decent."}
{"text":"This was my first visit and I already plan on coming back! Such friendly staff and amazing tasty treats and coffee! I had praline pecan coffee and a snowman Christmas cookie--the cookie could not have been more perfect! Baked to perfection and beautifully detailed. Thank you! I recommend :) I'll be purchasing cookies for my Christmas parties!"}
{"text":"Heres the long and short of it. Bakery Wee makes fantastic cakes! We've been shopping here for 10 years and every cake we get is fantastic! The cookies are always fresh! I showed them a picture of this cake and they made it! The cake was over $800.00 from the cakerie (?) That I originally stole the photo from. I paid under $300 with their reproduction."}
{"text":"My daughter has been raving about this bakery for over a year, but, well, I am the kind of person who would normally just order the cakes from Costco or Wal-Mart... you know, cheap, but edible.  Well, my son's birthday was coming up, and I wanted a special cake for a special kid.  He love Jake (and the Neverland Pirates), and I've looked at other places but couldn't find anyone who could do this particular cake.  My daughter once again said \"Baker Wee!\"  So, we decided to try it... and all I can say is WOW! The cake was SO far beyond my expectations I can't even tell you! We ordered a 1/4 sheet cake, which is even more than we needed, but I never even considered a smaller cake.  I did bring in my own plastic figurines, but they did way more than just 'plop' them on the cake.  It was done to perfection... and was a fantastic surprise for my son!  Everything on this gorgeous piece of work was edible except the figures I brought in and some little landscape plastic they added... there was an edible 'map', there was crushed graham cracker crust for sand (brilliant!) and even white chocolate molded seashells, as well as marshmallows for rocks... I will try to figure out how to post a picture of this masterpiece, because it really does need to be seen to be believed! But I will say, the cake was wonderful, beautifully decorated, done exactly as I wanted (with whipped topping instead of buttercream) and not nearly as expensive as I would have thought.  Yes, other places would have been cheaper, but they would not have had nearly the attention to detail that Baker Wee had done.  Thank you, Baker Wee... you truly made my son's birthday cake a HIT with all of us!"}
{"text":"Baker Wee saved the day! Very last minute they were able to make a beautiful cake to match my four-year-old's birthday theme after my cake fell to pieces. They were very cordial and willing to help. They did everything they could to make it match our theme and make it special for her. I would use them again in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"5 cakes and a year later... this is still, hands down, the most amazing bakery in Phoenix. They have surprised me every single time - each cake has been absolutely flawless. I always receive compliments on how beautiful they look and how delicious they are. I'm pretty sure my entire family and group of friends all order their cakes from Baker Wee now. Check out the pictures! :D"}
{"text":"The cookies and coffee were good; the service, however, was subpar. No welcome (there was only one other customer there at the time), no eye contact by the clerk, and no \"thank you.\" Just a dismissive \"Okay, I guess that's it.\" Really?  Customer service seems to be a rapidly dying commodity at more and more places. It's sad! Words of advice: the best products going can be quickly nullified by disinterested owners and employees who lack a sincere smile, a warm greeting and a simple \"thank you!\""}
{"text":"Horrible. We walked in looking for a place to possibly do repetitive business for some marketing that I need to do in the area. Received a lukewarm hello from an employee who then stood there and picked his teeth with his fingers. Disgusting! Not only did I walked out and will never go back, but this Bakery lost what could have been a lucrative client."}
{"text":"Very very impressed!!!  I had my first taste of Baker Wee deliciousness last night!  My friend was hosting another friends birthday at a restaurant and wanted to bring a cake.  We had talked about my yelp findings and I had suggested Baker Wee since we live pretty close.  My girlfriend gave them a call and discussed her friends interest in pool and the bakers came up with an amazing cake that was the shape of one huge 8 ball!  The best part about the whole thing was that the 8 ball was actually a bunch of cupcakes put together in a circle with a gigantic layer of frosting!  Mmmm!!  The creation was almost too delicious to eat.  I was very impressed with how innovative and flexible they were to my friends request for a unique birthday creation.    Taste: I split my cupcake with a friend and really enjoyed the frosting but the actual cake portion seemed a bit dry.   Why 5 stars then?  The cupcake/cake design was unreal and the birthday boy absolutely loved it!  If I need a cake in the future, I will for sure talk to the bakers at Baker Wee"}
{"text":"The people who works in there were so friendly. The applepie squares is a must to buy when you guys go to this place."}
{"text":"Great brownies.....awesome muffins.....good coffee.....friendly service. The muffins are 2.25 and everything else is under 2 bucks for a single serving.....including the coffee which has free refills. It is definitely worth the drive even if it is out of your way.....because even the cakes they make there are affordable. The day we visited someone ordered a sponge bob cake.....and 50th birthday cake shaped like a castle....and someone even ordered a lavish wedding cake....and none were over 60 bucks....that is an awesome price.   Now I know you can get cake cheaper at a local grocery store....costco....and sam's club...but they won't make these types of cakes and they won't be as good. So if you looking for something sweet to satisfy that sweet tooth head down to Baker Weeeeeee.....Eat, Drink and be Merrrrryyyyyy....my Friends!!!!"}
{"text":"Last year on this very day we had Baker Wee deliver a cake for our wedding.  The price was the best we found for wedding cake, and the taste was the most amazing we have EVER had!  Today, a year after our wedding, we thawed out our cake topper and enjoyed the most moist, flavorful, perfect cake.  It didn't fall apart, it wasn't dry; it was impeccable.  Thank you, Baker Wee, for a fun cake-tasting experience and amazing wedding cake.  You deliver excellence."}
{"text":"Under new ownership! New owner is sooooo very rude! I've been doing business with this company for years! She hung up the phone on me! I'm seriously shocked at the the way she handled my concern! I was trying to speak she would over talk me. I really wish I would have gotten her name! Breaks my heart because I've sent so many people this way and will NEVER send anyone here! In fact, will tell anyone who I know that does business with them because of my referral to stop doing business with them and anyone THEY have referred! I've never been treated so badly!"}
{"text":"Lora at Baker Wee made my dream wedding cake; I provided her with a picture and she created an exact replica. Words cannot express how excited I STILL feel about my incredible cake, and how grateful I am for Lora's dedication to perfection in appearance and taste (my gluten-free Aunt ate TWO pieces of it, not because it was gluten-free but because it was that delicious!).    While it's hard for me to stop raving about the cake that took my breath away, I must say the personalized service and attention I received from Lora and her staff at Baker Wee was just as amazing. I am so grateful that this small, locally owned and operated bakery was available to provide my wedding cake. They even went the extra mile and delivered the cake to my caterer the early morning of my wedding.  And if all this perfection were not enough, it was *incredibly* affordable too.   I'm so glad I wasn't drawn in my the supposedly fancy and overpriced wedding cake bakeries because Baker Wee exceeded my wildest expectations for a fraction of the cost! A million thanks Lora!"}
{"text":"My birthday cake came from here and it was a huge hit!!! Pink champagne cake was AMAZING!!! Thank for making a delicious and great looking cake!"}
{"text":"I've used Baker Wee twice for cakes... I used them for my birthday cake last year, and this year for my wedding cake.  I asked them to make me a cake based on one I saw online.  I provided the base plate and flowers/topper were added later by my mother-in-law.  The top tier was red velvet, and the bottom was white cake with butter cream frosting.  They were very good about their communication. Unfortunately, they kept wanting to know what I wanted as far as freezing b/c we had a two-hour commute to Sedona... I know nothing about what freezing cakes does for its taste, etc.  We did a Saturday pick-up, and I don't think they ended up freezing the cake.  It traveled just fine.  My only complaint about the cake was that the red velvet had a bitter after-taste, but the white cake and frosting were absolutely delicious!  They put support dowels in the cake, but nothing on top to actually support the toppers, so they sank in the middle a little bit.  I am not deterred, and will continue to use Baker-Wee for my cake needs.  Also, when splitting the cake cost (making payments), be aware that you will pay tax on it every time.  I attempted to pay off the cake so that I had a flat fee of $50 due, and ended up paying an additional $4 in taxes, which was unexpected.  Their cookies are delicious by the way!"}
{"text":"Great customer service and beautiful cake. Will definitely be a regular for all cake and cookie orders!"}
{"text":"I've been to this shop twice.  Today, I brought home an apple turnover to my husband, who is very difficult to please as far as pastries go.  He says the turnover was one of the best he'd ever had - tasted like it was made within the hour.  The muffins got his approval too and not overly greasy.  My turnover was also great and I've had a few other items from here.  I love pastries and these do not disappoint.  I also really like the atmosphere and the feel that you are visiting a family owned bakery.    As another reviewer pointed out you aren't going to get anything other than drip coffee here, but I don't go for fancy coffee.  Regular coffee goes just fine with their treats."}
{"text":"First time ordering a cake from \"Baker Wee\" and we loved it. Delicious moist cake. I wanted a personalized cake for my hubby's birthday, he was totally surprised and overwhelmed with joy. The costumer service is great. The staff is very helpful and friendly. I got a quote online by email and I was able to upload a photo which I thought that was very convenient. ;)"}
{"text":"I have not had lunch here nor have I had the cake here but what I did have was the eclairs. Eclairs are my favorite. These are the best and they are so big its unreal. The chocolate is really thick on top and they are overloaded with filling. These don't have you typical custard filling its more whip cream like actually. Normally I would have a problem with that cause I love the custard filling but this filling is really good. These eclair's are crisp just on the outside and nice and soft in the middle. They don't fall apart like other eclairs in fact mine stayed together till the very last bite. The eclairs are abut $3.50 each. I also have tried some of the cookies they have and all were good. They also make sandwiches, fresh bread, cakes, and other pastries."}
{"text":"I ran over here in need of a birthday cake for my dad. I don't think I will ever look anywhere else and will always recommend this place. The people are as great as the cakes are delicious!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite place... this bakery has been around for 18yrs... A lot has changed with this bakery... I miss their doughnuts and warm bread and lunch time boarshead lunch meat sandwhiches... Buttt the cakes, cookies, eclaires, dream cakes, macaroons, black and white cookies, the slices of cake the mini carrot cakes and brownies... yummmm. My favorite are the thumb prints and the cannoli are amazing... Go in check this place out I will forever love The Wee Bakery..."}
{"text":"Great cupcakes, beautifully decorated and tasted great. A bit dense but soft throughout. Will definitely go again"}
{"text":"This bakery is one of the nicest I've come across. The customer service is very pleasant, and it's like there's nothing they can't do for you. Definitely will come here for all of my pastry needs."}
{"text":"I tried out this bakery for the first time last week. I was in a bind because I wanted a custom cake for my daughter's birthday party and the woman who has done our cakes for us in the past was out of town. I needed a Super Mario Bros. cake with a Princess Daisy crown on the top. I ordered chocolate cake with a chocolate fudge between the layers. After discussing what I wanted with the employee,  she put the owner on the phone and I explained it to her. I found a photo of a cake I liked and asked if she could do that and to also create a Princess Daisy crown on the top. I emailed them photos of the cake and of Princess Daisy so they could copy the crown. Let me tell you... the cake turned out beautifully! AND it was delicious, fresh and moist. My daughter and her friends loved it Also, the price of this custom cake was considerably less than what I have paid in the past using someone else. I will definitely be using Baker Wee again."}
{"text":"I was referred to this bakery for my wedding cake by a friend who gets all her bakery needs here.  I have to admit I was a lil put off by the looks of the shop since it's not in a brand new building and all fancy and decorated with wedding cakes, etc.  We did a tasting and I remember thinking the cake itself seemed a lil dry, but I went ahead and decided to go with them.  They didn't ask for a deposit or any money for that matter until about a week before the actual wedding day.  This gave me plenty of time to look around for other options.  I went to one other tasting in a bakery that caters specifically to wedding cakes....my mistake!  I decided to go ahead and stop stressing and trust that Baker Wee could handle the job.  My cake was to have 3 layers all with an intricate lace looking design, I even provided a picture.  Compared to the quote given to me by the other bakery they were a steal!  I was able to add the 3rd layer and still be under the other quote!  I was mainly worried they wouldn't be able to pull it off artistically.  Boy was I wrong!  It looked exactly how I wanted and tasted great!  The cake was moist & the butter cream icing was to die for!  All the employees were very friendly and helpful and when I went days prior to the wedding to pay in full for the cake they gave my daughters two very large cookies on the house!  I appreciate all their hard work and creativity ( the other baker wanted to use fake edible lace!? WTH? )  I will most definitely be back in the future to see what kind of cakes and other yummy edibles they can create for me!"}
{"text":"They are truly a great Bakery...I have ordered 10+ cakes from them and they never disappoint! I have gotten to the point that I just give them a theme...headcount and let them decorate as they are the Pro's... Never disappointed and they are always so helpful.  Thank you Tee and Emilee for always helping us out! While I know its crazy to schedule two baby showers in one month..you have always made me confident that I never need to worry about the cakes!"}
{"text":"Love this bakery! Great cakes , have ordered three cakes , my birthday cake was Bollywood themed and absolutely amazing !!!"}
{"text":"Stopped here last week as I was in the mood for an eclair and other Yelp reviews stated this place had good eclairs.    I, however, did not care for the eclair here.  Mine was dry and hard.   The filling is more of a whip cream rather than a custard.   The other items we had were oatmeal cookie, cannoli and carrot cupcake.   All were average at best.  Nothing memorable.  If you like eclairs I recommend trying the Safeway at 39th Ave and Happy Valley Rd.   The eclairs at this location are FANTASTIC.   They are filled with custard and the chocolate topping and eclair pastry are heavenly.  You get two good sized eclairs for $2.79.   I'm addicted to them."}
{"text":"There selection of baked goods has waned a bit, but I come for the muffins. However, rarely am I greeted friendly. I leave feeling like I annoyed workers who had to come out from the back to ring me up. Not what it once was 10 years ago."}
{"text":"After a hair cut, we decided to get some non-Starbucks coffee. The sign says \"bakery and coffee\" but they do not sell espresso drinks, just plain coffee with a selection of creamers and sugars. The coffee wasn't bad though so no complaints. We also tried the mint brownie, mini canoli, and pumpkin donut. I didn't have any of the brownie but the canoli and donut were both a little dry. Not bad in taste though. It's a cute little family owned shop but I wouldn't go out of my way to get here."}
{"text":"AMAZING! We ordered our wedding cake from Baker Wee and it was the cake of my dreams. First, the price was amazing and helped us stay in budget. Second, the TASTE was fantastic! Finally, they delivered the cake to the venue for only a small extra fee and were on time and the cake looked amazing. Thanks so much Baker Wee :-D"}
{"text":"Baker Wee ha made 5 cakes for us and this experience has definitely been the worst.  The lettering was very very messy.  The Dead-pool picture was crooked.  Now to their credit they did offer to fix it however I did not have the time to wait for them to redo the cake so being my son is 9 today I did not think he would really notice.  The party went great and it was time for cake and ice cream.  No only was it supposed to be a yellow cake with strawberry cream filling it was a white cake with raspberry filling, it did have cream cheese frosting.  Tasted great just not what we ordered.  I know the bakery is under new management, but they need to get back to their roots and start caring again.  This year our cake just seemed like an after thought."}
{"text":"I ordered a birthday cake with vanilla butter cream icing and white cake. When I picked it up it was decorated nicely, however after trying the cake the icing had no vanilla flavor at all it tasted like Crisco and sugar and the cake was dry. I will not be going back here."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. They did my graduation cake in my birthday cake for the past few years. This year was my 30th birthday in they perfected my cake. The prices are amazing as well."}
{"text":"I cannot tell you how unbelievable Sad it makes me to only give this bakery one star. I have been a customer of this business for over 17 years and they have done every birthday cake I've ordered during that time. Unfortunately, the service was so bad when I ordered my son's first birthday cake on July 1 I can no longer patronize Baker Wee.   I was completely stunned by this.  I asked a friend of mine who was also a customer is she had had any issues and she told me the business Had recently been sold to a new owner and the new owner let go of all the existing staff. Guess that explains why the service was so bad and the quality was not as good. I spoke with someone three times over the phone and even came into the store to discuss the design etc. The final cake was nowhere near what I asked for. We had to wait an additional hour for them to fix the design and it still wasn't right. Made our whole party late. Then they didn't even give us the smash cake which just ruined the whole first birthday experience.   Then to add insult to injury they charged me $15 more for the cake than I usually pay AND I had to buy the deco pack.  So disappointed.  Now I'm in the lurch trying to find a new bakery for my son and daughter's party."}
{"text":"We've ordered 3 cakes from here, and each time they come out amazing. They did our wedding cake, anniversary cake (a fresh one instead of freezing the top - genius!), and most recently, our gender reveal cake. Would highly recommend Baker Wee if you're looking for a custom cake that's definitely affordable."}
{"text":"AMAZING!  Great baked goods made from such a great staff that goes above expectations. I needed a sugar free cake for a surprise birthday party that we were having while camping. They were willing to come in early so we could pick up our cake slightly early."}
{"text":"I am going to join the not impressed minority on this one. Nice people, good selection, but their cake isn't much more than what you get at Basha's and it is a whole lot more. I priced them for wedding cake and they are some of the more expensive places on the west side. If you want a really special cake with a million details and cost is not a thing, go here. If you are looking for a good cake that won't burn a whole in your pocket- look someplace else.  And just to clarify- I have had their cake at several functions and as I mentioned- not much better than Bashas."}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood, and have gone here for birthday cakes, donuts for the office, breakfast sandwiches and the black and white cookies. Everything has been pretty decent, and the people that work here are super nice.   My boyfriend absolutely adored the cake I got him from here. It was a little pricey, but it made him really happy (he's a chocolate freak) - so it was worth it.  Overall it's a place I'll keep going when I have that \"I need a baked good\" fix. :)"}
{"text":"I have ordered tons of cakes from here and have never been disappointed. They are great at making your idea come to life. They have great customer service and there cakes taste as great and they look you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Came in with a Groupon, otherwise, I'd never have found this place--and what a find it is!  Prices are excellent, quality is excellent, service is excellent. I'd suggest you use Baker Wee for alot of your cookie buying.  I know I am.  I love this place!!!!  By the way, I have been in there two times near holidays, and they do some really cute cookies each holiday..cool!"}
{"text":"I decided to visit Baker Wee today as they seemed to be willing to work our issue out. I was prepared for a hard time, though.  I took my laptop with me to show them the pictures I had taken up close of the cake.  I first met with Cody (Candace) and she totally saw the cake my husband brought home was clearly not similar to the example cake that had been emailed.  Cody was extremely nice.  She went and got Laura and when she saw my pictures she, too, agreed that the cake didn't turn out per directions on my receipt.   My cake issue was totally resolved with no conflict.  Quite the opposite, both gals were as nice as they could be.  I've been dealing with Laura for years and have never had an unpleasant moment with her.  It's true, there are new owners but the same staff.  I'm not sure what exactly went wrong with my cake but both Cody and Laura assured me there would never be a problem again.  I'm extremely happy we resolved everything.  I believe strongly in supporting \"mom & pop\" small businesses and I will continue giving my business to Baker Wee.  I'm doubting the bad reviews about rudeness and refusal to refund!  I'm also having a hard time believing the bad pics that have been posted. I had just the opposite experience! Would I recommend Baker Wee to my friends?  You bet!!  Thank you Cody and Laura and I look forward to many more years of bringing my celebration cake needs to you to bake and decorate!!"}
{"text":"Baker Wee is awesome. A couple years ago, my husband's one birthday wish was for a birthday cake. Simple enough, you'd think, but he was diabetic and it was a task to locate and choose a bakery that makes custom sugar-free cakes. I'm sure glad I found Baker Wee! The cake was good, but had that sugar-free taste (which was fine and kind of expected). I've returned a couple times and each cake has been just as good. The last time I picked up a cake, they asked me how much I was quoted when I placed the order. I wasn't quoted a price and told him so. He only charged me $25 for a cake that should have cost more according to their price list!"}
{"text":"I have gone to this bakery a few times. I always seem to forget about it because it's tucked in the corner on 43rd ave and Thunderbird Rd.  Pricing can be a little high on certain things but the quality justifies it. $3 a muffin and $10.99 a pound for assorted cookies. We should have bought 2 pounds because the cookies went quick once we got home.We also received a free cupcake for checking in with Yelp. Our cupcake choices were between orange chocolate or sundae. We went with orange choclate and then decided to pick up a chocolate brownie for $4.  The bf accidentally dropped the orange cupcake before we could try it...... We contemplated a scenario very similar to a Friend's episode where they eat the cheesecake off the floor with no shame. We decide against eating floor cupcake and we will just have to head back for more cupcakes another day.  We decided to eat the brownie on the car ride home. Super thick, defitinely need a drink, a glass of milk would have been amazing!  They had a quite a few cakes in cold cases ranging from birthday cakes to wedding cakes. Beautiful speciality cakes.  Staff is friendly and you can get in and out with your baked goodies pretty quick."}
{"text":"I can't believe this place!!! I went to pick up a cake on Sunday for my daughters 3rd Birthday. We asked for a Batman symbol to cover the whole cake and to put \"happy 3rd Birthday Kailea\". They were suppose to put sparkles into the butter cream.   1- the sparkles looked like an after thought and they just threw some on after the fact.   2- the Batman symbol was so amateur and small it looked like my three year old made it.   3- THEY SPELT MY DAUGHTERS NAME WRONG!!!!!!   When we told them how disappointed we were in the cake they told us that NO ONE could help because there was no baker on site!!!!! Not even one of the two people behind the counter can fix the name???? We had the take the cake to her party \"as-is\"    Do you know how embarrassing it is to take a cake that's misspelled to your own daughters birthday and have everyone say to you \"did you know her name is wrong\"??  We have been trying to get a hold of a manager since Sunday. Today is Wednesday and they finally called saying they will refund us $25 or the $100 cake! Are you kidding me? I'm a great baker and the only reason I did a professional bakery was to get the perfect design and they RUINED it! This cake wasn't worth $100 nor was I even worth the $75!!!    Have a 5 year old make a cake for you. It will look better than this!!!"}
{"text":"Great experience- loved my baby shower cake. Executed perfectly with all my requests and tasted great."}
{"text":"It was just ok but im not too big on sweets. I had no issues with the cashier or owner being rude as other yelpers mentioned. This was my 1st time here. I dropped in thinking it was a donut shop but it's a bakery. It's a bit pricey."}
{"text":"Discovered this bakery through Groupon.  I purchased a dozen brownies...excuse me, a dozen DELICIOUS, YUMMY, SCRUMPTIOUS brownies!  I also tried a chocolate dipped strawberry and my husband bought a lemon pound cake.  This place is a bit out my way but I will take the time to go back again.  Special thanks to Tyler who gave us great service!"}
{"text":"You know what? I wasn't crazy about the coffee, but I wanted a latte and they don't have latte's (I don't think they had an espresso machine).  They did make me a blended iced mocha drink and honestly, it was pretty good.    Here's the scoop:  I had their black and white cookie. One word D-E-L-I-S-H.   It was thinnner than I'm used to but the cake was SO fresh and the frosting! NOM NOM NOM. I SAyYGOD DAMN! AMEN!  I'll be back. (for the black... and white! booyah!)"}
{"text":"I have purchased so many things from baker wee over the years. They used to be my go to for all major events. I got my wedding cake, baby shower cake, birthday cakes, cupcakes etc from them.  Recently, I ordered a dozen cupcakes for my friends baby shower. I went to pick up the cupcakes and grabbed a few additional pastry's. I SPECIFICALLY asked the woman at the front if the chocolate chip cookies had any peanut products in them or if they had any cross contamination. She told me no and then reassured me by having the owner come over and tell me the same thing. I gave the cookie to my daughter and an hour later we were in an ambulance on the way to the hospital. She is extremely allergic to peanuts and has serious allergic reactions to them. I called them back after to find out what was in the cookies and the girl I spoke with said \"the cookies had nothing other than normal ingredients you would find in a cookie, however, there is cross contamination and they sit on the same pan as the peanut butter cookies\". My head almost exploded, SHAME ON YOU BAKER WEE. I asked them before I bought the cookie and asked for reassurance over and over and was told by no means was there a chance of peanuts or peanut products in or on the cookie. We will never ever come here again and I will share my story with everyone I know. They put my daughter at risk and didn't even apologize when I called back. This place is a joke."}
{"text":"I've never been here, but my coworkers keep bringing this stuff into the office. It's great stuff! The cookies aren't too soft or too hard, and packed with flavor. The brownies...oh my, they're the best brownies I've ever had! They're so dense and full of cocoa, and the frosting on top augments the flavor without adding too much sugar.  And that's what I like about this place the most...I love baked goods, but a lot of them are too sweet for my taste. Baker Wee seems to focus on a quality product that tastes just as delicious as it looks."}
{"text":"A bit on the ghetto side of coffee shops, this bakery is a local treasure. Nice employees, good prices, and enjoyable breakfast items."}
{"text":"I LOVE Baker Wee.  They did my wedding cake 10 years ago, and I have never used another bakery since.  Our church uses them for all baby and bridal showers, all birthday celebrations, mothers day....anything that requires a cake or snack stuff, we use Baker Wee.  Last year they catered a mothers day luncheon for us, wonderful!!! Can't say enough about this bakery!!!"}
{"text":"Beautiful family run bakery. I stopped in for a cup of coffee and a pastry. The apple filling was delicious and not too sweet. The pastry was light and airy. My coffee was bold and flavorful. The shop's environment is very comfortable and their products are noticeably superior to many items I have had at the grocery store. I can relate to the locals smiling and see it is a favorite destination in this area of the community."}
{"text":"I recently had a sugar free cherry pie delivered as a surprise for a diabetic friend of mine. Placing the order was a breeze and the service friendly. The delivery fee was high at $25 and cost more than the pie itself but I needed a last minute birthday gift. It turned out I gave them the wrong address and the delivery guy couldn't find the place. They called the recipient, got directions and re-delivered the pie.   The pie was a big hit. It was so fresh it cracked open when cutting into it. She said it was so delicious and filling she had it for lunch.  I simply love that they offer a variety of sugar free cakes and pastries. More places should."}
{"text":"Best cakes anywhere!  Baker wee has done two of my kids weddings, 3 of my beiges weddings and does all of our birthday cakes.  Not only do they have the best tasting cakes anywhere they always amaze us with how beautiful there cakes are.  They always go above and beyond our expectations!"}
{"text":"I forgot to add to my review once we picked up and ate the cake. It was PERFECT! They did an awesome job! and it was one of the best cakes I had ever eaten. We had about 50 guests come from California and they could not stop talking about the cake! I would/will definitely use them again! Great service, Awesome decorators, and delicious cake! Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"We just had the worst cake I've ever seen in my life for my niece's first birthday! It looked like a a cake from a kids cooking class. It looked like the bakers first cake. The piping was different shapes, sizes, and COLORS! We even gave them a picture of what we wanted. We specified fairy dust, no fairy dust. We specified pumpkins, we had??? Tutus?? We specified a gold board, we got white. The writing was atrocious! The letters were different sizes and thicknesses. We wanted cursive, we got kindergarten scribbles. I mean this cake looked awful!!! For spending $80+, I wouldn't have wanted this cake FOR FREE!!! We've had the most beautiful wedding cakes, anniversary cakes, shower cakes, and birthday cakes from this bakery over the last 10+ years. I am so saddened to hear this bakery is under new ownership. Clearly the new owners drove the amazing talent they had away! Do not purchase a cake from this bakery. You will be so disappointed on your special day."}
{"text":"I ordered a naked cake for my son's 1st Birthday Party (1/28) and everyone loved it!!! My husband and I were a little apprehensive about spending more than the usual amount of $40 on a cake, but we had heard such great things about Baker-Wee through our friend Stella at work, and decided to place an order. As soon as we got the cake we could not have been happier and even more when we had a slice! Thank you so much for your deliciousness! We will continue ordering cakes from you guys. I will make sure to grab some business cards from you guys, since almost everyone wanted to know where we ordered the cake from."}
{"text":"Visited this local bakery on a whim. The bakery advertises that it's been ranked top ten bakeries in the Valley and having been around for over 20 years we were excited to taste their goods. The staff was super helpful and friendly. One woman in particular was evidently passionate about her baking, and we really admired her enthusiasm for the craft. We ended up tasting a few items, sugar cookies with fudge in the center, a chocolate cake with baked in walnuts and caramel and topped with fudge, and a pineapple upside down cake. Hands down, they do chocolate right, and we're so glad we snatched the last chocolate cake! The sugar cookies were good with the fudge, but the regular one is lacking without, and the pineapple upside down cake was okay. If you visit, highly recommend that you pick a chocolate item!"}
{"text":"I have Baker Wee do my birthday cake every year and this year they did not disappoint! It was beautiful and everyone loved the way it tasted"}
{"text":"Baker Wee provides Phoenix with the comforting, sweet, and scrumptious bits of heaven you expect from a small bakery. The chocolate covered strawberries are unbelievably juicy and rich. We have also ordered our wedding cake with Baker Wee, and I can't wait to stuff my face with it later this year!!!"}
{"text":"To be fair I was not helped..  I was invisible!  The bakery food looked and smelled good, but I had none..  My stars are only a reflection of lack of service, not food..."}
{"text":"I like this place..cute and neighborly. The food was also tasty and the owners/employees were very friendly and helpful. The problem was that the owner/proprietor/manager couldn't make a chai latte to save her life. (They were on the menu, so it's not like I made a special order). It took her a good 20-30 minutes of me standing there for her to track down the ingredients in the cupboards, then concoct the thing. She was very apologetic, but it was still a bit inconvenient and odd considering it was a coffee shop.  Nevertheless, I'm certainly willing give it a second chance, especially since I haven't tried the food yet..."}
{"text":"When I am having a sugar craving after busting out a gargantuan trail run, I hit this place up. Muffins, cupcakes, all sorts of gluttony inducing items."}
{"text":"Wow too bad. I'm got my daughter's wedding cake done here they did a great job the gender reveal cake ok job but not as much I Great as the wedding cake. I just went in for her baby shower cake and they totally to try to dissuade me from the idea I had and lost my business so I do not recommend Baker wee. Each time I've gone in the cakes have gotten  less appealing and more expensive.  They have changed from idea books that were on the table to one iPad. So if they are helping a customer any other customer has to wait. My time is valuable when I'm planning a party I don't have time to wait around until the one iPad is available"}
{"text":"They made our cake for our wedding this past weekend. It was perfect to the picture we provided and tasted amazing! Everyone at the wedding loved it!"}
{"text":"Oh em gee. Baker Wee has some of the best cookies I've ever tasted! Why can't this place open up in Scottsdale? Well, on second thought, never mind- that would be to my waistline's detriment!  Anyway, I happened to be in this part of town for a volunteer event at ASU West and stopped in this bakery on a whim. I ordered a few large sugar cookies, a few small thumb print cookies with vanilla frosting, and lemon, carrot cake, and pink champagne cake balls.  Everything was scrumptious!!   The cookies were perfection. Really sweet & delicious. Loved the frosting on the thumb print cookies.  The lemon cake ball was moist & so intensely flavored! Yummm! I loved the pink champagne flavor as well. The carrot cake one was good too. The cake inside the cake ball by itself was amazing-but I think a cream cheese frosting would taste better than the vanilla they used.  All in all though, everything was fantastic. And reasonably priced IMO!  Highly recommend the sweet treats of Baker Wee!"}
{"text":"Went at 345 on a Saturday  afternoon got 1 doz cup cakes and 1 dozen cookies and 1 elephant ear for $80. Seems a little steep!  Cookies were okay at best, cupcakes good but rather small. Probably would't go back, the price to consumption value is not worth it."}
{"text":"I got my daughter's 1st birthday cake here. It turned out fantastic. The owner added some last minute touches when I came to pick it up. The flavors were awesome too. The staff is helpful and polite every time I've come in. I would definitely buy from this establishment again."}
{"text":"Looks like the new management let go the old staff.  Very Sad!   Quality is not as good, staff a little rude.  I am going to miss this place!  Mary"}
{"text":"I  was so excited to find this baker and one that had such great reviews to boots. My now husband and I went in for the tasting which the glavors were amaxing and they were great to work with. They really worked with us and figured out some changes that we could make that would get us the price range we wanted. I have been in the food industry for year so paying $5+ a slice was something I refused to do. Our cake was suppose to have fondant on the bottom tier and buttercream on the top 2 with different flavors in each tier. Out wedding day came and they were suppose to deliver the cake at 12pm, as our ceremony was at 4 and I wanted to make sure our photographer had enough for photos, well 3pm rolled around and no cake. I had My sister call and they told her the driver got stuck in traffic and was 20mins away. My sister then went to talk to my now husband and he had just called as well and they told him they had just left the store (we were getting married in Queen Creek which is a good 1.5hrs from their store). This really frustrated me as why lie? Plus we paid an extra $100+ for delivery and it wasnt there. The cake finally made right as we were finishing our ceremony at about 4:45pm. The cake looked beautiful but was all fondant, late, and the top tier was leaning. We took the top layer home and because it was 4 layers we took the top 2 off and I immediately found out why it leaned. It looked as though the cake broke or was dropped and the middle was crumbled making it to where the straws used to support the cake couldn't stand up straight. Overall the cake was good and for the most part beautiful but on someones wedding day you shouldnt be 5hrs late and and least apologize (which hasnt happened yet). At this time I'm unsure as to if i would use them again or recommend them to others. The stars are because of being so late and lying to sister as the cake was beautiful dispute the leaning and not being exactly what we ordered."}
{"text":"Found this place one day while looking for a place to get something sweet for breakfast.  Everything was fresh and tasted good.  Prices were comparable to other donut shops I have been to."}
{"text":"The 5 starts is for the Black and White cookie.   I came in to get a sandwich on a coworkers recommendation but they do not serve them anymore. Instead I had a great time browsing their pasty display. The cakes I saw were stunning, The snoopy and gang cake they were boxing up for a customer was totally insane. I wish I snapped a photo.   They did have a check in offer so I had a yummy chocolate cupcake. Thick fudgey frosting.I washed it down with a good cup of Pumpkin Spice coffee.  I also brought home a Black and White cookie since well, I can't resist my NY roots. It was the best Black and White cookie I have had in Az.   The place is busy and the ladies were very nice. They can make special order cakes and cookies if you have a photo."}
{"text":"I've been coming to order special birthday cakes for years. I ordered 2 cakes for my sons first birthday. One for his actual birthday and one for his party. The one for his birthday was okay, mediocre at best. I was fine with it, no one was going to see it. I went to pick up his second cake for his party and I was shocked. It looked like I had made it myself, I don't bake. Beyond upset, they charged an additional $30 for the \"decoration\". When I ordered it I was fine paying the additional $30. I understand they I have to pay for their work. But my goodness if I'm going to pay additional money I want it to look like a professional made it. I'm embarrassed to put this cake out for everyone to see. I will not be returning here I'm so disappointed.   Added pictures below. Each time I paid $30 for the decorations. The first cake had fallen apart by the time we we started to eat it. The second cake is after they \"fixed it\""}
