{"text":"Pretty awful and cringeworthy. The restaurant is not air conditioned so be ready to sweat buckets. Food is overpriced for what you get--$45, before tax and tip, for a cocktail, a plate of nachos split 4 ways, and 3 of the smallest soft shell tacos I've ever seen. We're talking maybe 3 inches in diameter.

Nachos are not served with anything, guacamole, sour cream and salsa is all extra. Guacamole is also listed as \"Market price\"? Weird. Steak tacos were cold and chewy.

Beware the service--likely from the owner. After our nachos he came by, tossed all of our food to the right of the table without saying anything (he knocked over the bowl of guacamole and shoved my arm in the process) and then promptly sat a family of four...right at our table. I've never experienced something so incredibly awkward and bizarre. He took our water jug, put it on their side, then took our water glasses--which I drank out of--and put it in front of them. That family somehow got their tacos before we did, ate, left, then another group of 3 came and were seated right at our table--elbow to elbow--again.

Never, ever going back here. Terrible food and most awkward, uncomfortable dining experience."}
{"text":"The only reason this place gets 2 stars, the decor, for no other reason!! There are far better options than this place, once was more than enough for me. This is the same feedback I am getting from everyone I know that has tried this place. Great decor, u have to give the designer of this place kudos for the great concept. Accolades stop there. Staff, they avert any direct eye contact out of fear of being asked to do their job. Service is slow with zero communication. Wait for food a little long, but not too. Presentation, a joke, seriously, no effort whatsoever. Portions are a real joke, a serious joke. Drinks are mainly ice, expensive to boot, with only a hint of alcohol. Food carried no taste, bland no excitement whatsoever. Thoroughly disappointed."}
{"text":"Nice Bar. Cocktails were delicious!!! We had 6 tacos they were tasty and fresh and we'll just delicious. We will definitely go back. It's a nice place for  date night :)"}
{"text":"We arrived at 6:30 in high spirits on a fine Friday and left at 8:00 PM, our spirits broken, our stomachs barely satiated. Bar tenders were friendly and efficient BUT service in all other areas was abysmal. We came into the restaurant just wanting some tacos, we ordered swiftly (we were very hungry). It took 45 minutes for our one lonely appetizer to arrive (fried calamari, all you need to do is fry??). The bartender sent us complementary chips and salsa but it wasn't enough to keep us going. All around us people feasted. Alas we were forgotten. We notified the owner, who assured us that they were coming. We then preceded to wait another hour for our tacos. By the time we got our tacos we scarfed them down in a record 15 minutes and when we went to pay we got nary an apology. Outside the sun had set. Our hearts were heavy (but not stomachs)."}
{"text":"Not sure what to say, margarita's were mediocre at best, no salted rim or asked if. We wanted it. No grand mariner, Cointreau or even triple sec when we asked to have it in our drinks. seeing that commonly makes a great margarita. As for the tacos, it's 3 tiny tacos. Which is fine, but the staff ( which is non existent ) could inform the clients as to how many to order, seeing we were with 3 hungry guys who got their plates with 6 bites. I had high hopes seeing we only go out in this area and that's who returns to your establishment. Serves us right for not going to satay brothers, but wanted to try something new."}
{"text":"Fatso - that's the name and also the size of your bill except you ain't getting fat here.
Not sure if this is a Montreal thing but your 10$+ cocktail drink comes with loads of ice-cubes and a tiny film of liquid inside. sip.. oh it's done but hey it's overrun with hipsters who can't serve you for beans so it's 'ok'. Go across to Dilallo's after unless you plan to go hungry."}
{"text":"Vin papillon had 1 hr wait so came here instead.  Pleasant surprise had the ceviche and fish tacos.  Ceviche was very tasty and a huge portion.  Washed it down with a yummy mescal/grapefruit  margarita.  Def coming back."}
{"text":"The manager is so weird... I think he's rushing on coke .. it's noon on a Friday and really not busy this guy is freaking out on the innocent bartender .... I think he needs to relax

And this place is dirty"}
{"text":"food was good - filled me up but was small - i had the avocado and cucumber salad. drinks were on the pricy side. regular staff service was very nice what the man who seemed to me the manager/owner wasn't as friendly as his staff. i felt tossed around and that was actually annoying. other plates looked delicious and although it's on the pricy side, i'd go back to try more of their dishes. the ambiance was nice though the place gets very loud."}
{"text":"This place has a nice terrasse during summer to chill with friends or coworkers. The service is pretty quick and the staff is friendly. 

As for the food, the nachos are awesome ( we tried the chicken and chili nachos). Their tacos are good but not the best."}
{"text":"Went there twice. The food is decent, some good vegetarian options- had the tofu and the portobello tacos. Both were good. Also loved their empanadas. We ordered salsa however, and it was not that tasty. The service is not the best, they forget to bring some tables hot sauce and serve tables that came in later before those who were waiting longer. The cocktails are a big miss. We tried different ones, and they are very pricey and not tasty. All in all, it's fun in the summer if you are walking by and can get a table outside, and stick to the beer."}
{"text":"Since it's a beautiful day, and I am hungry; I felt to have lunch at an outdoor terrace. We were on Notre Dame street; my mom spots El Gordo, looks very busy. She says if it is busy then it must be good. Despite the restaurant being busy, the waitress was able to give a spot outside. It was a while for the waitress to come to us to take our order, but the service was super friendly. I ordered El criminal (a platter with two chicken soft tacos, salad, guacamole with chips, and churro with dolce leche. As a drink, I got a white wine sangria. In honesty, there was nothing extraordinary about the taste. I had better sangrias. The company was good, the weather was perfect... so we enjoyed our time in the restaurant. I still have to find the perfect tacos in Montreal."}
{"text":"Update 

Went on margarita Sunday which is $6.00 and shots are $8.00 if you're in the mood to party.

Food isn't cheap and a bit to over priced for what it is. $15 dollars for a plate of 3 small tacos isn't ideal but I do have to give it them flavours wise its good.

Salad was $15 which was not big for what it was. Avocado and cherry tomatoes with guacamole smeared on the bowl and a dash of crumbled feta. I wouldn't get it again as it's not worth it.

Friendly service and a great vibe going on inside. Wish the location was a bit bigger as it feels up quickly."}
{"text":"Should be renamed El Flaco. Overpriced. Small tacos. Not even good tacos at that. Music so loud could barely hear the people I was with."}
{"text":"We are here as a group of four and the consensus was that we would rate it either 3 or 3.5 based on the following things we ate. 
Service was ok. 
The chips and salsa and the calamari were plain. 
Tomato and avocado salad was excellent.  
We tried four different types of tacos - each came as 3 soft shell tacos. The tacos we tried were shrimp (very good), pork (good), chicken (good) and lamb (good). Apparently you can get salsa (squeeze bottles with spicy sauces) with the tacos (all the other tables had it) but we only noticed after we were finished eating - guess our server forgot! Although the tacos looked small all of us were full afterwards and most of us enjoyed the flavours.  
Nice decor and good atmosphere - lively and fun. If we were to come back we agreed it would probably be more likely for drinks (though my mojito was nothing special)"}
{"text":"With a stomach that was begging for something to eat I can easily tell you that tacos are always on my mind, I came here for a random get together with friends and I found this gem. El Gordo Tacos provides the ambiance of a small Mexican dinner and the casual fixtures of Montreal. The service staff was there and provided me with answers to all my questions. Beer is a must if you're not too sure what you want. I felt like be adventurous and ordered the Lamb nachos. No, no you read right... LAMB. Can I say that these were delicious! The sweetness of the corn and the spiciness of the peppers were just great.

With the nachos I ordered 4 tacos for the small price of 10$.. in which you get what you pay for and that's it. They were tasty but nothing I haven't tried before... but those nachos though...*insert droll pic.

Overall I was very surprised on what they offered and didn't leave with an empty stomach. This place is worth a shot and also take advantage of their small terrace!"}
{"text":"Went back last night for a taco/girl's night. While we had to move tables because they wanted to seat strangers with us on the same table (really?!), we still really enjoyed the food! We got 3 orders of tacos - for the full review, please click here: https://therealmtlfoodie.wordpress.com/2017/10/17/is-it-tacotuesday-yet-because-i-crave-these-tacos-all-week-long/"}
{"text":"We ate here twice while visiting. Sat at the bar both times and had excellent service. The sangria and the margaritas were very good. The tacos were flavorful and presented well."}
{"text":"Hm. Came here for mac n cheese week, and we were promised the entree would be too much for one person to finish (it was $17). Basically a burrito with mac n cheese and brisket inside. I understand why they said that, because it was terribly greasy. Tasty, but definitely not worth the price. The shrimp and chorizo tacos were pretty artesan, but then again, a bit too small.

We came without a reservation, so they said we had to leave by a certain time. Service was alright, they weren't rushing us, but they kept asking if we wanted drinks. 

Seating was also not ideal, the bar stools didn't give us much space to put our bags and coats...or lean back."}
{"text":"Excellent margaritas, cevice, gazpacho & tacos. Lime pie for dessert was amazing too! Great service as well!"}
{"text":"I came here because it is super close to where I live. I'm typically not a big fan of mexican food but I have to say that their tacos are super tasty and so are their cocktails. The place look nice, it is as fun outside as inside. The service could be better but, what really makes me having a love-hate relationship with this place are the prices. Too expensive for what you get. I think everyone that have been there can agree on that."}
{"text":"This spot seems to always be busy so I decided to stop in late one night when the restaurant was less crowded, however even then, a spot on their outside terrace was not possible! The location on a corner of Little Burgundy attracts the masses but after trying their tacos and a cocktail, I couldn't understand why?! Portions are small and pricy. The tacos de arrachera were good but not great, and at 16$ for three, were not really worth it. The \"chef cartel\" cocktail, made with rum, jalapeño, hibiscus, mint and pineapple, sounded interesting but was missing punch. 
The venue is nicely decorated, very informal, and a great spot to maybe share a sangria with friends, but I wouldn't go back for the food."}
{"text":"tacos sound great on paper. says comes in 3.....what you get are the tiniest little tacos that might be for a grasshopper to munch on. they're smaller than tea sandwiches. 3 bites done. with drinks expensive....hell with this went to dialo across street for an average burger but won't ever come back to this place. embarassing"}
{"text":"Very affordable, sharing is a good way to enjoy a lot of different dishes. The ceviche was amazing , just like how they do it in Miami. Just wish it had a meal plate rather then an appetizer. Pineapple Express drink was very good. Service is good, very welcoming. Come early , usually a wait to get a table."}
{"text":"Was pretty disappointed with the prices and the level of service. I lived in Texas for a few years before moving back to Montreal so I know what Mexican and Tex-Mex (yes, there's a difference) food is supposed to taste like. 

So the food tasted average but the length of time we waited to get 3 small tacos for such a high price was a bit shocking. I should have expected it when I saw how small the calamari app was even though the price was $12.  I've had better tacos from food trucks and I waited 5 minutes for that. 

So pretty much a one time place for me. I can't deal with a place that takes over 1 hour to bring water to a table after requesting it; yeah, we timed it.  Maybe the regulars here are ok with it. I'll leave the place to them.

PS: I've never been ANYWHERE that charges \"market price\" for \"Chips and Guacamole\". Seriously? Avocados are now a market price item?  Unbelievable. What a joke."}
{"text":"The dishes are very pretty. Very instagramable.
We ordered 2 dishes of tacos (3) each plates for two person. Very small tacos. A little pricy

The Mexican wings are quite alright. The sauce is amazing. Drinks are quite good but not exceed expectations."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite Mexican restaurant!!! I love the ambiance, the Latin music and the food is deliciouuuuus. The Gordo salad (all their salads for that matter) are soooo good and their tacos, OMG they bring them in this chiseled pot with 3 cups filled with dressing, guacamole, tomato and cheese. The portobello sandwich is amazing! To be honest, I would try everything in their menu. I went there by coincidence because Foiegwa was closed and we didn't check the hours. So, my friend and I walked around and stumbled upon it. The place is a little small but I liked it because it felt so cozy. Anyways, despite the negative reviews I gave it a try and I highly recommend it. I go there every 2 weeks now. They also have special deals on weekends."}
{"text":"Brought my family here for lunch around 1pm and was beyond disappointed and quite embarrassed. We waited at the door for a good 5 minutes then proceeded to wave down an employee so we could sit down. Our party ended up sitting at a dirty table where there were used coffee cups and napkins then even got up after another 5 minutes to grab our own menus from the front. My boyfriends chair was also broken and the busboy came and took it but didn't seem to care about bringing back another one??? No one ever came to see us at the table because it seemed as if the only waitress working was extremely busy taking payments and the other busboy texting behind the bar. Needless to say, we ended up getting up from our dirty table and walking out after more than 15 minutes of not even a hello."}
{"text":"I came here because my friend recommended it. It was very packed and we were not able to sit out on the terasse. We ended up inside. I ordered calamaris, chili and a piña colada. Ughh they definitely did the piña colada wrong they used agave syrup which is not what you put in a classic piña colada :/ you usually use cocnut milk or cream and i didnt taste that at all. Pretty disappointed with that! 

The service: was a little slow but super friendly

The food: The calamaris were really delicious that I can tell you! The chilli was great a little too spicy for me but very Delicious ! I love that white drizzle on top it had a sweet kick to the the chilli.

Overall, it's a cute little resto but I believe there are better taco places in montreal. I don't think I'll be back. The piña colada really turned me off because it wasn't the original classic ingredients that were used."}
{"text":"I just created a restaurant page to give it a one star review so know that anything I say next is from the heart.

We came to this place because of the $2 taco Tuesdays advertised on their website but what we got was more than we bargained for.

1. The service at this place was ridiculous. We were seated at the bar and the waiter hardly looked as us as we ordered. He grunted one word answers and then almost left without taking one of our orders. No problem right? It's a busy night and these are $2 tacos.

2. We looked over the menu at the special and ordered What we thought were 2-3 tacos each. The waiter grunted and took our menus away. When he came back he brought a tray of what looked like 3 amuse-bouche versions of a inauthentic hipster taco (complete with pomegranate seeds and dried out chicken) for each taco we had ordered. We were surprised but these were 2$ tacos.

3. We finish and ask for the bill... which takes 15 mins to arrive. When it does instead of a $16 bill. It's a $70 BILL without drinks or anything.

The waiter announces that the Tuesday taco special (advertised on their website and menu!!) no longer available and when we point to the menu, he grunts angrily that he'll be calling his manager and disappears only to reappear angrier and ruder than before as of WE were the incompetent idiots with a corrected bill. He then makes a big show of throwing out the faulty menus in front of us.

On the upside, the mojitos look pretty. 

There are so many good taco places in the area so do yourself a favor and go anywhere else."}
{"text":"In this place the service was cold and nonchalant. The Tacos were flavourful but only two bites each. I thought they were just entrees. Ridiculous. We had to go across the street to Dilallo to finish off our meal. NEVER Again!!! When they called it El Gordos it wasn't to describe what you will feel after your meal but the feeling of the bull gouging my wallet."}
{"text":"Well, it was a nice effort but extremely poor execution.  Tacos are cold, beef over cooked and dry, shrimp and chorizo was drenched in sauce.  Everything only comes in 3. No exceptions.  Music choices feel like a low end resort in an awful country. We were amused writing this because of just how bad it is.  I tried 3 times.  Every time it was just as bad.  Oh well.  Never coming back.  Try other great options in the hood."}
{"text":"Where once we had very limited taqueria options in Montreal, now every neighbourhood seems to have one. No complaints on my end although it is hard to give them all a try. For the occasion of a friend's birthday and just a good Friday Happy Hour, I found myself recently at a taco bar that opened up in Little Burgundy just a short walk from my place, El Gordo Taco Bar.

Started by the same group that owns the neighbouring Geppetto pizzeria, El Gordo is a smallish bar specializing in tacos and other Mexican fare. With the summer weather, they have a nice terrasse out-front off Notre-Dame that increases seating. The space has a nice look to it - Day of the Dead motif and lots of natural lighting through the big windowed facade. Once crowded, the space is pretty loud but the ambience is solid.

Any good bar needs some cocktails and El Gordo satisfied that nicely. Their classic Margherita with agave nectar, fresh lime juice and tequila is nicely balanced. The sweetness of the agave and the fresh lime helped to soften the tequila hit. The Pineapple express with bulleit bourbon, fresh pineapple juice, cilantro and lime was similarly balanced. All the cocktails are available by the pitcher which is a great for a group as we were!

A couple of starters before the tacos. First was the chips and guacamole. The guac was pretty smooth in texture and had lots of lime juice. A little bit of queso fresco on top added a little twist. The plantain empanadas were served with a spicy paste that my girlfriend enjoyed a fair bit. The empanadas had nice crunch to them but they were not that exciting flavour-wise.

El Gordo has 9 standard taco flavours and a special of the day. The standard dish has 3 tacos each and they are pretty small size-wise. For me personally, 3 wasn't enough to satisfy my hunger although the server said as much to me ahead of time. Just be aware of that when you order. My girlfriend ended up regretting not ordered more as she was still hungry later on. The good news is that each taco only comes up to 3-4$ a piece so the price is fair. I tried 3 varieties on this visit. First were the chorizo tacos - served with pickled onions, habareno jam, queso fresco and salsa verde. All the tacos are served on soft tortillas which is my preference. Nothing of that hard shell B.S. The chorizo was nice and tender and the rest of the topping provided a slightly sweet and spicy edge.

The second variety was spicy braised beef brisket with creamy apple and cabbage slaw and pico de gallo. Another hit to us. The smoky brisket was excellent and I really enjoyed the slaw and the hint of sweetness that came from the use of apples. The pico de gallo added some extra freshness.

The final variety was the special of the day and my personal favourite of the night - fried chicken with guacamole, chipotle mayo and creamy coleslaw. I really enjoy the extra crunch provided by the fried chicken. The addition of the guacamole made these tacos feel a little more hearty and the mayo really had a kick to it.

The big negative of the evening was the service. Over the course of the evening, we had two different errors on our order - once our entrees \"disappeared from the computer\" and in the process of re-ordering, our waitress forgot the nachos we had asked for originally. Second time, my friend's order of ceviche was mistook for \"vege\" tacos. Now, we didn't make an issue of the nachos as by the time we figured out she had forgot them, we were ready to move out anyway. However, two errors like that are not really acceptable regardless of how nice the servers were in acknowledging the mistakes.

Good tacos, excellent drinks and a nice decor - El Gordo definitely has a place as a solid happy hour and dinner location. The lack of good happy hour spots around the Market plus the fact that they open at 3pm weekdays and don't take reservations means that El Gordo can certainly fill a nice niche. A few service tweaks and I would be satisfied. I'm just happy I have excellent tacos to enjoy so close by.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"I went for a drink at this place ... and we had to take some food with our drinks ...
So we ordered the arrachera tacos .!!!
Drinks were good and so were the tacos .... but besides that i was not impressed ..!!!
I think am being generous with 3 stars .... but my experience was not disappointing neither 
It's just that when you go out so much ... you need to be impressed"}
