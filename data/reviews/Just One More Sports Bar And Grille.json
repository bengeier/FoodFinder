{"text":"Even though management doesn't like to advertise they are a Steeler's bar they are! HaHa.   They gotta show love to the home town Browns but both are Steeler's fans at heart and you can come here to watch the games when they aren't on local tv.   They have reasonable drinks and great \"Bar Food\""}
{"text":"Very friendly place.  Bartenders are friendly.  The food is standard bar choices but is a step up from most.  Plenty of TVs which is great for a sorts themed bar.  Owner is usually around and very friendly."}
{"text":"Just went to \"Just One More\" for dinner with family and friends.  STAY AWAY!! We arrived at the restaurant/bar at 5:00 and left at 7:05.  Initially there were only 4 bar patrons in the entire place. We tried to order several appetizers that they were \"out of.\" Orders were slooooow and we didn't get any condiments after asking multiple times.  Supposedly a \"fryer\" went out and orders came out at the pace of one every 10 minutes.  It seemed that the owners arrived to assess the kitchen issues and stayed in the \"shadows\" by the bar.  Nobody came over to apologize and no discount was offered to our group for the painfully slow service and lack of items in stock.  The bar and TV setup looked good and service to the bar patrons seemed fast.  My opinion is that this place should NOT be advertising as a restaurant, it is ONLY a bar with some food items. Food was average at best and it seemed as if we were annoying the staff with our food orders."}
{"text":"I probably am somewhat biased as I actually miss the old Stella's. In any event, the decor is definitely updated and they have spent some money on the updates. However, I'm not sure what they're trying to accomplish. The food isn't bad (actually, its about a B+ for bar food), but it takes forever. The service is inept at best. I'd be stunned if it's still open in a year."}
{"text":"Great food, nice atmosphere . The employees are great attentive and quick. We love heading there for dinner after along day.  My daughter loves the buffalo chicken wrap, says it's the best she's ever had, and she's a very picky eater. My husband and I love the burgers and a spicy chicken sandwich, And the chips come out warm and tasting wonderful."}
{"text":"We've been here twice now. We love it. We have two small children so we usually go during the day. The food is amazing!  Our girls are always treated so well and the service is great. We love the much needed renovations from when it was Stella's. The decor is amazing. All the pictures and memorabilia is great!  I'm a huge Cavs fan and to see all the huge pictures is like reliving the 2016 championship all over again!  Thank you!  I hope you're in business for a very long time!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service,and awesome atmosphere. Have specials everyday and great bartenders that always come with a smile."}
{"text":"Nice place. Friendly staff. Owner makes his rounds. Epic wings, they make them fresh and worth the wait with the dry rub. Seems kitchen closes at diff times though. If it after 9 call ahead to make sure if you're hungry. That's the only reason it not 5 stars. Hate to have BWs as the only option late night."}
{"text":"Should have stayed Stella's. Super lame sports bar. Weird lighting. Staff was \"meh\" and not memorable. I guess if you like crappy beer and all you need is a TV with Sportball, then you'll be fine.   I didn't try the food, but I was not happy with the \"feel\" of the place. Just seemed so cold and not comfortable."}
{"text":"This was our first time here.  Food was good.  Ordered the stuffed mushrooms on the waitress' recommendation.  They were very good.  We ordered a buffalo Chicken sandwich and a mushroom burger.  The Chicken sandwich was very good....and huge.  The fries were hot and well seasoned.  The burger was a little over cooked and was supposed to come with lettuce, tomato and pickle, but didn't.  We asked for it and the waitress brought it.  Now the reason i gave this place a 3.   The service was very slow and inattentive.  We walked in and sat ourselves at a table.  There were only 3 other tables seated when we got there, so it wasn't crowded at all.  It was five minutes before anyone even approached the table.  It took about 15 minutes to bring our appetizer, but no plates for them.  We waited another 5 minutes before we could get the server's attention to bring us plates.  I had to stand up and wave across the bar to get her attention   It was another 15 minutes before our sandwiched came.  We had to flag the server down to bring the lettuce and tomatoes that should have been on the sandwich to begin with.  We sat for 10 minutes with the credit card on the table and finally had to go up to the bar to pay the bill.  I would suggest you have a server on watch on the restaurant side.  it is very difficult to see the diners form the far end of the bar.   We might go back to try some more of the food, but if the service is the same we will not return a 3rd time."}
{"text":"We drove from Akron to try this (new place). It's not even open yet... it's still under construction.... So how can they say on this site \"Area's leading restaurant serving Avon Lake and surrounding areas\". Just One More Sports Bar And Grill is fake and so are there statements about there restaurant!"}
{"text":"A fun sports atmosphere that Avon Lake has needed for a while!  Great food and wings!"}
{"text":"It's 91 degrees with a breeze and it's 91 degrees inside with no breeze. Lets just say spend some money and turn the AC on.   The cook was at the bar drinking waiting for orders to come in. I watched him walk to the back and never washed his hands. Thank goodness I didn't order food here.   None of the employees here smiled.   I might come back when it's not so hot outside so it will be cooler inside."}
{"text":"The first time I ate here was good. Beautiful inside, very good customer service. Last night we had take out from there. Not so good. We had a BLT, you couldn't even see the bacon, which was very minimal and overcooked. We had the pretzel sticks, which were overcooked. Onion rings, they were so overcooked the onion inside was shriveled to nothing. The chips were a geat size, but had that old deep fry oil taste to them. I liked the place the first time, which is why we ordered from there again. It was so different and poor last night, I doubt if we would go back there anytime soon."}
