{"text":"When it first opened we really liked this place, however over the last few months the portions of chicken in the lo mein is virtually nonexistent and flavorless. Was our favorite but now we won't ever order again."}
{"text":"This place has great food at an affordable price. The shrimp lo mein was outstanding and the Thai spicy chicken was very flavorful, it had a good kick of spice without being overwhelming."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the Asian cafe lomein chicken noodles fantastic general Tao chicken great prices"}
{"text":"I don't know what the other views are talking about soggy food. This food is great. The staff is great and friendly. One of those hole in the wall places that is very good.  I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Have been getting delicious Chinese food here for the past couple of years, it is consistently delicious...which can be hard to find with Chinese restaurants. The owners are WONDERFUL and know the clientele. This restaurant is reasonably priced, family owned, clean, and simply fantastic! We go nowhere else when in the mood for Chinese cuisine...give it a try!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I really like their Malaysian Satay Style Beef (Mongolian Beef ia slao similar and very good, but I think that Malaysian Satay is best). I would have given five stars, if the dishes has a bit more meat or other vegetables instead of onions."}
{"text":"We tried the Asian cafe over sesame in Tonight to save a little money and time- what an amazing choice!  We got plenty of food with leftovers and it was all very delicious!  Their menu has a lot to offer and I look forward to trying more dishes!"}
{"text":"Lunch special was great price. Under $7 with drink. I had the orange chicken lunch combo. The meal was super hot and quite tasty. Good portion for a lunch combo. Nice clean interior with new granite topped tables. Atmosphere is what you would expect with a large waterfall painting and proverbial white ceramic cat on the counter. Staff was very nice, even asking me how my meal was. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Had a very large takeout order so we were able to try many items. The crab puffs and wonton soup were very good but all the entrées were very average and quite bland. To top it off, the fortune cookies were stale. Will be moving on to the next Yelp recommendation!"}
{"text":"Good food.  Good prices.  Friendly service.  Small eat-in area.  Really more of a take-out restaurant, but several dishes that are more authentic to China.  For instance, you can get duck here.  Most take-out Chinese restaurants don't offer this.  Overall good place.  I'll go back."}
{"text":"Delicious, i got the shrimp with mixed vegetables lunch special. It was good and reasonably priced and the restaurant looked very clean. I recommend coming here."}
{"text":"I recently moved to this neighborhood. I stumbled upon this place one day when I was headed to the pizza place next door, but I didn't really want pizza. WOW, what a great find. The food is fresh and prepared quickly, and the portions are huge. The staff are very nice. I usually get the small, which is enough for two meals. Now, I call to place an order for pickup, and they tell me 15 minutes, but it is usually closer to 5. Delivery has been very quick as well. I have tried almost everything on the menu, and love it all."}
{"text":"Great, small family-owned/run business.  The food is excellent; we've tried several different items and have been pleased every time. The \"Tom Kria\" soup (aka Tom Kha) on the menu is very spicy - and very tasty!  Excellent for when you have a head cold.    If you want good food at reasonable prices, this is your place.    If you want mediocre food at inflated prices and stuffy atmosphere, look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Since I've been splitting my time in places other than Pittsburgh, I was happy to see Asian Cafe in the old KFC/Taco Bell in Castle Shannon.   The fried rice, (pork, and chicken), have become a favorite for my daughter. I enjoy the fried rice, because it looks like rice, untouched by sizzling amounts of soy sauce. It's a nice balance of meat, vegetables, and rice.   We're actually fans of  tofu, and on our last trip, ordered the Buddha's Bean Curd (deep fried tofu), and Bean Curd Szechuan style. Both tofu dishes were good, but the tougher, chewy texture of deep fried tofu might be unimpressive to people not fans of tofu to begin with. The Szechuan style tofu came with some broccoli florets, in a brown sauce, I requested extra spicy, but found it not spicy enough for me.   We'll be back to try more, on the nice sized menu, maybe something Thai."}
{"text":"For the past year I kept thinking there needs to be a place to get some Thai Curry in the Castle Shannon area. When I saw Asian Cafe opening where the KFC/Taco Bell use to be I did not think much of it, but when they delivered the menu to my house I was excited to see some Thai food!   Since they opened I ordered the Penang Curry and Thai Red Sauce with chicken. Both were good. The Penang Curry came with green beans, carrots, and onions. The sauce was what you would expect from this joint, standard and nothing too amazing (like smiling banana leaf) but it cured my craving. The thai red sauce was better. This sauce had a lemon grass basil taste to it. It came with snow peas, green beans, mushrooms, onions, carrots and fresh thai basil leaf!   Shrimp rolls are standard and the last order they put in four small doughnut holes (not sure if there is an actual ethnic name for this?) which was nice.    I never sat inside but take out is fast, 10-15 minutes for 3 meals during dinner time.   The lady who takes my orders is very nice. I asked her a question and she tried her best to understand and answer it. I hung up the phone smiling, and I am one who hates ordering takeout!   Since I am not a fan of chinese food this is going to be my go to place to order from since they are a thai selection."}
{"text":"I used to live over by this place.. It was my \"go to\" fast Chinese food place..  They have a great lunch special with a lot of food.  I recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"2.8 miles is too far from you!!??? Then take that delivery service off from yelp!! You are misleading customers!"}
{"text":"This is a great little hidden gem! From the outside, it looks like just a dive but the inside is surprisingly nice.   The food here is great and they are willing to make things to your taste when it comes to ingredients and spice level.   The waitstaff are also very friendly. They came by while we were eating just to make sure we were happy with everything even though this is an \"order at the counter\" place.  Another little bonus is that they have a drink station where guests can help themselves to free refills which definitely comes in handy in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"We flew into Phoenix and decided to eat lunch before we headed to Sedona. We were craving Asian food and decided to give Asian Cafe a try. We ordered, Mongolian beef, spicy Thai chicken, sesame chicken, and sweet and sour chicken. Each entree was accompanied by a scoop of fried rice, a scoop of noodles, an egg roll, a fortune cookie, and a soda. The egg roll was pretty standard fare, but had a nice ginger taste that was unique. The fried rice was quite bland. I am not an Asian noodle fan, so I did not try them. The chicken entrees were all good. All in all, the food was fine. It was very inexpensive ... $4.50 for the whole meal. I was not impressed, however,  with the styrofoam food boxes (dine-in meals  served that way), styrofoam cups and plastic forks and knives. I do not think I would return to or recommend the restaurant as there are many others to choose from in the area ."}
{"text":"Nice people. Not very good food. Not sure why such positive reviews. Cheap prices, but they skimp on the actual meat. Sesame sauce has a clear BBQ base. Overall a disappointment, and I wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"By far one of the best in town! Service is great as it's always a lady and her husband who are both kind and very generous. You just don't get that in places anymore. I order out more than eat in and my food is always ready in 15 minutes no matter how busy they are. Food is excellent and have had almost everything on their menu. Great portions for great price as well."}
{"text":"Good food.. Great value. I recommend the lemon chicken, the honey garlic chicken, anything sweet and sour, and the walnut shrimp. Those are my faves! They're getting 4 stars because their plain fried rice that comes with the dinner combo is awful. Just awful. But if you order it with all lo mein, they don't charge you extra and it is yummy."}
{"text":"Quick and friendly service. The food is consistently good and very fairly priced with large portions.  I wish that they delivered- that is my only qualm but it is definitely worth the quick drive for take out"}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for over 2 years and they have great food, prepared fast, and at great prices!  Try their Teriyaki Chicken, they use Chinese 5-spice, great ingredient!"}
{"text":"Always top quality food, and they are very nice and friendly.  Love the fusion dishes - the flavorful sauces pack a bit of punch, so specify your spice level.  Dining area is small, but we have eaten there no problem.  More often, we take out.  Prices are good."}
{"text":"The food is very bland. They do give you a big size portion.  Mr. Wongs is the best in the area."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!  It happens to be close to my house which is a plus but we get the kung pao chicken and it is soo good! I even eat all of the vegetables that come in it.  It's decently spicy which is what I was looking for.  I don't ever get delivery though. I'm not too sure what that's all about when I read the other reviews. Otherwise I think it's a great local spot. Fairly priced for the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"This is our go-to place for Chinese take out.  The owner is incredibly sweet and very enthusiastic about her food.  Their noodle dishes are wonderful and always incredibly fresh.  The menu is very well-rounded with some appetizers you don't always find (i.e. pan-fried won tons)."}
{"text":"Merriam-Webster defines \"Café\" as follows... \"A usually small and informal establishment serving various refreshments (as coffee).\"  Can you get coffee here?  No.  Well, to be honest, I have never asked for coffee, but who would at a Chinese... I mean...Asian restaurant.  So this so called \"Café\" has no coffee.  Is that a problem?  No.  First of all, they do have 2/3 of the definition correct.  It is small, and informal.  For me, that is close enough.  I do have to say, though, that for an order-at-the-counter \"Asian\" restaurant, it is extremely clean and new inside.  And the staff is extremely friendly.  In fact, you can ask them about their food and they actually have an answer!  Now friends, this is extremely peculiar for such a restaurant.  This friendliness also lends itself to some flexibility when it comes to ordering.  They will let you substitute meats, adjust heat of a dish, etc., without blinking and eye.  And all this for dirt farm poor prices.  The lunch specials are an insane bargain with all kinds of sides.  And for dinner, although it is a bit more expensive, they load you up with tons of food.     But this begs the question you are all wondering.  Is this \"Café\" at least \"Asian?\"  Merriam-Webster defines \"Asian\" as follows...\"Of, relating to, or characteristic of the continent of Asia or its people.\"  So do they have Russian food here?  No.  Do they have Vegemite here?  No.  Do they even have Korean food or Japanese food?  No.  This is truly Chinese food, without question.  And it is an outstanding example of Chinese cuisine.  Everything is made to order, extremely fresh, and very light and authentic; sort of the anti-Panda Express.  And considering this place will make your food just about as quickly, without having to wait in line with a bunch of mouth-breathing yahoos, I would highly recommend a visit to Asian Café, even if the name is completely and utterly misleading.  And besides, the name still makes a lot more sense than Panda Express.  I mean, can you eat Panda there?  Do they have Pandas working in the kitchen?  Do they have a Panda petting zoo in there somewhere?  Would you want that where you eat anyway?  I hear those things are dirty, ornery, and smelly."}
{"text":"A below average Chinese- Thai fusion restaurant. Prices are low because quality is just about as low, but not as low as the customer service.   No one greets you or asks to take your order. Very tacky establishment. The bare minimum when it comes to Chinese and Thai."}
{"text":"The service here is great. Food arrived quickly. Be warned they dont include utensils. But what was delivered was fantastic! I would describe the food here as healthy, flavorful asian fusion..... and that's lowballing it.   we ordered orange chicken, thai spicy chicken, broccoli beef & soup. everything was fantastic.Thai chicken is deliciously SPICY. The wonton soup should be called surprise soup bcuz there's a yummy surprise in the bottom. Try it! Best egg rolls. Try them too. Happy 2013!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered take-out from here yesterday. My Bangkok Shrimp was loaded with more water chestnuts than shrimp, and water chestnuts were not listed as an ingredient of the dish on the menu. I hate water chestnuts. It should be shrimp, scallions, and basil. I asked if I could add mushroom and she said ok, then I asked if I could please add broccoli, and she told me, \"no, no add broccoli.\" I was willing to pay extra if need be. My dinner sucked. My husbands wasn't bad, he had the Panang curry with beef. The chicken and broccoli my son ordered was good. I won't be going back here, especially since it's too difficult to add a vegetable per the request of the customer."}
{"text":"This is my go-to for Chinese take out in this area. Good prices and great food. Asian Cafe never disappoints."}
{"text":"Ordered the Hunan Delight. Supposed to be beef, shrimp and scallops. Had one scallop, 3 pieces of beef and 4 shrimp.  This dish lacked any taste at all. Must have forgotten to add spices. Was dissapointed to say the least."}
{"text":"This place is great. The food is really cheap, and made fresh.  While the bowls at Panda Express are like $5, they're only $3.40 here, and it tastes better. Plus, you can customize the food for no additional charge (unless you add something). Also, THEY DELIVER."}
{"text":"I love this place.  It was my go to for my Chinese food cravings.  If u noticed I said was as I was horrified to find out that they have closed for business.  I wish the owner well on their next endeavor."}
{"text":"I have read about this place since moving here a few years ago, and what a gem this place. The atmosphere isn't elegant, but the Thai Spicy Chicken was incredible. Full of flavor, veggies & chicken, made in just a few minutes, while being very economical.  I will return again very soon.   Give it a try."}
{"text":"I went to Yelp to find a good Chinese food delivery place and came upon this one.  The last one I used to go to must have changed owners or something because the food went from amazing to awful.  I'm so glad we found this one.  The prices are reasonable and the food was delicious.  I ordered the spicy thai chicken and it was awesome. It had lots of chicken and good quality chicken at that.  My boyfriend ordered the hunan spicy beef and again the beef was perfectly cooked.  We also ordered the pot stickers, and crab puffs and they didn't disappoint either.  The fried rice was not the best I ever had but it won't stop me from ordering there again.  This will be my go to place for Chinese from now on!  I don't know why anyone would give this place less than four stars."}
{"text":"I'm from New York so ever since I've moved to Arizona I have been on the hunt for Chinese food I can liken to what I have had in NYC.  After ordering take out from a handful of places I was thrilled to find that Asian Cafe has super good food.  In true family fashion we ordered a little bit of everything- all of our staple favorites.  We ordered a Lo Mien, A pork fried rice, a shrimp and a chicken plate. All tasted fresh, clean, flavorful and delicious. We have since ordered again and the food quality appears to be consistently great. I most appreciate that the food doesn't taste as greasy as other Chinese take out places."}
{"text":"So happy to have a restaurant so close by that's actually worth going to. It's also great that's local & not a chain. The food is good, but when you order it keep in mind that they use an American level of seasoning. If you don't like bland food then you'll want to up your number. 4 is still kind of bland so you may want a 5. I don't like spicy food, but I don't like bland food either. Everyone is very pleasant that works there."}
{"text":"I always order from Asian cafe, I don't think there's been a single time that I've had meat that was under cooked or slimy & chewy. This place is bomb, I usually keep it simple with chicken & broccoli or lo me in but it's always consistently great. Love it"}
{"text":"Pretty good place for some hot \"Americanized Asian\" food. I can't give it a 4 star because it's definitely a really standard Americanized Chinese food location, nothing close to authentic. However, I still enjoy my hot Asian food once in a while. The taste of the food here is not bad, and it's a popular takeout place. You do have the option of sitting down if you want, but they only have a few tables available.  We tried the Singaporean Noodle and the Malaysian Style Beef - both came out very hot, which I really like. They were both very flavorful as well, except I wish Malaysian Style Beef had more veggies in them and not just all onions. Portions were okay.  If you happen to be in the area and is looking for some hot food, this place is worth a try, but I wouldn't go out of my way just to eat here."}
{"text":"This is a very decent take out Chinese and Thai restaurant. Although there are a few booths and tables, it's really more of a takeout place and the ambience doesn't lend itself to dining in.   I decided to order the Mongolian Satay Beef since it was in the chef specialty list and also was had a positive mention in other reviews. I wanted some vegetables so I got broccoli in hot garlic sauce. The meal came with a very large portion of steamed white rice.   My meal was good, not greasy or too salty and servings were plentiful. I wouldn't order the Mongolian Satay dish, though. Although it was posted as a spicy item, it didn't taste too spicy hot to me and there were too many onions and scallions for my taste.   The broccoli was very good, cooked just right and tasty with the sauce. It would have been a full dinner to have just a large serving of the broccoli with rice.   I'm not a fan of white rice. I'm not sure if they had brown rice but I didn't see it mentioned in the menu and I wasn't asked if I wanted brown or white.   Service was friendly and it was about a 10 or 15 minute wait in the restaurant for my order to be ready.   Prices are reasonable and they have a very large menu. I'd try this place again when I want some Chinese or Thai take out."}
{"text":"Great food and outstanding prices! I enjoyed the people and the next door feel of the place!"}
{"text":"Moo shu pork is best I have had in years and wife loved the sweet and sour chicken.....I recommend the Asian cafe for good, quality take out at a good price!"}
{"text":"Everything was super good :) It's usual fare but not disappointed."}
{"text":"love this spot! Good food, great value on the combo meals , and the staff is extremely friendly"}
{"text":"Me and my sister came here to eat. We looked at the pictures to see what looks good. We were also the first people here and we were the first ones to order. However, we got our food last and what we ordered looks nothing like the pictures. The only part of the mean my sister liked was the rice. And I liked nothing. The food has no favor and all you can taste is the slimy texture. The service is horrible it is like waiting for a train that doesn't even come to your station. The smell of this building is disgusting, and it gets worse going to the bathroom. The bathroom is dirty just like everything else here. I recommend going to Brookline to eat at the Thong Garden."}
{"text":"The best hole in the wall restaurant in phoenix! Chicken Singapore rice noodles are highly recommend"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place. I work in the next plaza down from here, so we are always ordering lunch and sometimes dinner on late nights. They're food is always good. The crab Rangoon here is the best I've ever had. They're big, and get 8 in one order. There's a lot of filling in them too, unlike some restaurants that skimp on the filling and leave you with mainly greasy, tasteless fried wonton. The woman is always very helpful, and remembers us. After we place a big order for the holidays she always makes sure to throw in a couple free items, like a couple orders of sugar donuts and about 10 cans of pop. They get two thumbs up."}
{"text":"I have stopped in here for take out a half dozen times and it's worthy. Give it a shot. Of note I usually order online and never had a mistake! I wouldn't eat in because the seating is limited. The lady at the counter could be on the Titanic and she greets you with the biggest smile. I like that!   I have provided pics of my beef with broccoli, they usually add some extra veggies. I like that. The W always gets the General Tso's chicken. I would prefer she gets it hotter but it's very good. We also got the Crab Rangoon's, egg rolls and of course and fortune cookie."}
{"text":"Yesterday was probably my third time eating from the Asian Café and it's pretty rocking vitals for the prices.  This was my first time picking up from there as I usually send someone else, my errand running husband: )  The place is small, but there are a few tables in there if you decide you want to eat in, but It's much more popular as a take out.  I didn't call ahead or order online which is super convenient and my preferred method.  I figured I would pop in order two entrées and steamed dumplings, which I admit I have a huge weakness for, and wait for the meals two doors down at the well-known bar/restaurant Atria's.  I ordered and paid and asked how long, she replied quickly 15 minutes, I say 15-20, she says, no! 15 minutes.  Ok I was trying to stretch it a bit, possibly fitting 2 cold ones in but with the time constraint one would have to do.  I returned at about the 15 minute marker and my food was packages and waiting for me.  So one thing I really like about this small café is that they offer some not so usual dishes for a mostly take out Chinese restaurant.  They have duck, several dish noodles, and a whole section with Thai food.  This I dig.  I got the Thai Pad, extra spicy, the honey glazed crispy chicken for the hub it came with rice, and of course my dumplings & extra sauce.  The dumplings were a nice size for the price, and not bad.  I like a little more filling but still pretty solid.  The Thai Pad looked a little different than most Thai Pads I've had but it had excellent flavor and I loved everything about it.  Nice spice, loved the basil, shrimp, and chicken.  I tasted the honey chicken and it wasn't bad either, but I didn't dig the sweet glaze, but I know he liked it so all was really good.  This place is definitely in my rotation of local restaurants."}
{"text":"Great food at a very affordable price we. I live close enough and always pick up and it is rare that the food is not ready within 10 minutes.  The family that owns the restaurant is incredibly nice and courteous. Highly recommend their General Tso's and the Shrimp Lo Mein!"}
{"text":"Man...this is a great spot for Chinese and Thai cuisine!  Friendly service, quickly prepared food, and great quantities make it a delicious \"go to\" for this type of cuisine.  Now, the place is small, so dining at the restaurant might be a little loud because of the space and table set up - but as far as take out goes, it's a \"no brainer\" for the Murrysville area.  I'm so glad I've found this place and will certainly keep it in the rotation of \"usual\" restaurants....particularly for take-out.  Kung POW this place is good!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, lovely owners!  Cindy the owner knows her customers and all food is prepared to order.  This wonderful family-owned restaurant is great for eat-in or take out.  Great food and great price!"}
{"text":"So it's Sunday Mother's Day and my wife REALLY wants some Chinese! Off to the wonderland of Asian Cafe! Again never ever a disappointment... The Pad Thai was vibrant, tasty, a hint of sweetness, and an enjoyable level of heat the way it's supposed to be! My wife's Red Curry chicken was also flavorful and brilliant. To top it all off I haven't personally been in for a few months and the woman behind the counter remembered me and as was my previous experiences she was a delight! Thank you again for another fantastic Chinese meal!"}
{"text":"The food is consistently good. Friendly family owned and very fair pricing. Best Chinese Food in Shaler/Glenshaw area."}
{"text":"This place deserve 5 star overall everything is great. I'm brain dead from last night and the worker helped with a good deal took me 10 to 15 mins to make my order. No rush and you can see them cook and they enjoy it. The food smells amazing. They are not cheap with there sauce and overall I think it's a place to go if you want light food or alot of food for cheap. This is how I feel about this place. I'm from LA I travel and I can tell you overall there worth a stop"}
{"text":"Our go-to neighborhood Chinese takeout place! They are fast, have good prices, and prepare quality food (as far as takeout goes). I love their sesame chickens and crab rangoons. They have tables in case you'd like to eat there and they keep the place clean. They have great lunch specials that we take advantage of often!"}
{"text":"I ordered food from here last night 9/17/2016.  On a single order I got Pepper Steak (Large 9.75), Mongolian Beef (Large), Large Combination Lo Mein, and Fried Dumplings total around $36. When I arrived home - I opened up the Pepper Steak and I literally had to look for the meat under loaded of onions and green peppers. It was so disappointing I literally paid 9.75 for sauce, onions, and peppers because the meat was nonexistent.  On top of that they had their children taking the orders which looks younger than 15 what was irritating she was on her iPhone during the ordering process."}
{"text":"Greatest place in the area for take out! Every item served is made fresh to order, and the family who operates the Asian Cafe are great!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Great prices. Nice locale.  Every time I go in, I always feel like they're making food special for me. Oh wait, they are !  I'm a picky eater, so I always deviate a little from the regular menu ingredients. I love that they can cook to suit my needs.  It proves difficult sometimes at other restaurants. But not at Asian Cafe."}
{"text":"Somehow 11111 N 7th Street is \"too far for us.\"  Um... 3.6 miles is too far? wow... OK enjoy your locals. Ordering somewhere else now. :)"}
{"text":"I've been here several times and although the food is mostly pretty good, the man behind the counter is ALWAYS rude. No matter how polite we are to him, he never fails to roll his eyes at us when we ask for extra sweet and sour or hot mustard. He also rolls his eyes when we ask simple questions about the dishes we plan to order. He talks to us like we are stupid and always makes it clear that we are inconveniencing him. If they didn't have lunch specials at such a great price I probably wouldn't go back due to his bad attitude, but the food and prices are pretty good. My favorites are the beef and broccoli and the Thai spicy chicken. The egg roll would be one of the best I've had except they don't change their fryer oil often enough and anything deep fried has a nasty rancid oil flavor."}
{"text":"A pretty good place where I have eaten a couple of times.      Please note - I recommend take out - you can eat there but the atmosphere is similar to a Diary Queen ;-)  Good food - in a place where there are not many choices without a 10-15 minute drive in any direction.       I recommend any of their dishes.   They serve chicken on skewers in lieu of chicken wings.   They were pretty tasty.  Food - Portions are large (dinner) and prepared well Price - $5-11 Atmosphere - meh   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I love Asian Cafe!!!! I eat here all the time. Love their Thai spicy chicken and shrimp and always get their lo mein. They are fantastic at making substitutions also. Great food for a great price!!! We are going tonight as a matter of fact!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good thai and Chinese food. It's not too pricey, wait times are reasonable, and they usually get the order perfect. No delivery and I'd never dine in, but the food is good."}
{"text":"Got a take out on a sunday evening. We ordered a bunch of different stuffs (veg. Lo Mein, fried rice, egg drop soups and general tso (obviously). Besides the general tso, all others tasted kind of bland."}
{"text":"Went in today ordered a beef and broccoli dinner combo and a small side of mo pao tofu , let me tell you the lo mein was so dry and burned, the beef was slimy and had a coat of flour I want to say which made it taste very weird. The mo pao tofu was OK. Big portion for a small. The egg roll and crab puffs were tasty but then you can never go wrong with that. I picked up so as soon as I got their it was ready. But over all the food is not the best and I played 15.30 which was a waste because I did not even eat half of it.."}
{"text":"Dropped in for a quick lunch on my way to Home Depot. I wanted a quick light meal.   The place is clean and the lunch special is cheap. The service was great real friendly.   I had Sesame Chicken and asked them to spice it up a little. It was deep fried and served over white rice. The chicken was good and the rice was rice. LOL $3.69 for lunch and I am just starting to get hungry after 5 hours. NOT BAD."}
{"text":"The BEST General Tso's chicken i've had in this city.  Period.  You know how when its done just right there gets this almost sweet candied outer shell that kinda plays off the spicyness of the sauce?  How that shell almost crunches when you bite in?  No?  Well, it might be that you've never had authentic General Tso's chicken.  Good news for you that Asian Cafe has it.  I've been there a bunch and this is all i've had because its special and perfect and I don't want to waste my time with anything else when I'm there.  I'm guessing the rest of the food is great but when you have a winner, keep getting it.  The owner is also very nice.  Once you've been in once she knows who you are and what you order.  English isn't great and i'm convinced she doesn't know what i'm saying to her half the time...but who cares?  Seriously authentic american chinese food."}
{"text":"You'll never leave Asian Cafe saying \"Wow! Asian Cafe changed my life! I'm a new person from this day forward.\"  You'll also never leave saying \"Oh my god, that was the most terrible thing I've ever eaten.  I wish I could throw it all up now, but then it'd have to go past my mouth again.\"  Asian Cafe is, well, pretty good.    The service is really fast.  The dining space inside is a little bit weird, though... I feel like everyone can hear my table talking, because it's just an open space with a bunch of little tables, and there's no music or other white noise to give you a sense of privacy at all.    The lady who's almost always working there is really nice, and pretty enthusiastic about her job.  And as I said, the service is really fast, which is a plus.  If I recall correctly, the crab rangoons are a step above in quality, so I'd recommend those... unless I recall incorrectly.  There's nothing there I've eaten that I've disliked.  Some of the things with thicker sauces may be good to avoid, because they're comparatively not great, but even those are far from being bad.  If you're in Murrysville and want Asian-style cuisine, Asian Cafe is a great place to go if being quick about it is your goal."}
{"text":"First time for me trying this place though hubby has had their food several times for lunch. I had the Tom Kha soup and Pad Thai. The soup was flavorful but too spicy for me to fully enjoy. The Pad Thai is very tasty...sweet and tangy, I asked hubby to order it \"not spicy\" and it wasn't.  I made that request as a previous reviewer mentioned it was \"always hot\". Hubby had the Hot & Sour soup and Bangkok Shrimp. He said the soup was flavorful and spicy but no where near as hot as their Thai soup (not the Tom Kha)  and the Bangkok Shrimp was flavorful and a little spicy. He especially liked the small size of the vegetable pieces didnt need a knife. It's awesome to have another dining (take out) option on the Shaler Rt 8 corridor besides pizza, burgers or Chinese food. Overall very tasty..4 stars due to the tiny indoor seating space and the spiciness of the food."}
{"text":"Don't expect a fancy place to eat in but DO take-out!  Fresh, made to order food. Great lunch deals and lots of food.  They will accommodate to picky eaters (ehem) so this is a keeper for fast, local food."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good Chinese place among many in the South Hills. Their pineapple duck is pretty good and generously portioned as is their steamed dumplings. I recommend them for takeout."}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese delivery. You get a ton of food and it's not to expensive! The employees are always friendly and smiling. Just a little hole in the wall place. My favorite part is they will sub tofu on any entree! They always quote delivery at 30-40 min and ALWAYS show up wayyyy earlier. My husband and I eat here at least once a month."}
{"text":"I got delivery last night and it was fast, hot, and delicious.  You get a lot of food with good flavor.  This place is now on my call list."}
{"text":"I just recently moved to the area and have been looking for a good place for Chinese food and this is the place. Don't be discouraged by the outside because the inside is nicely put together and very clean. And the food is really good in my opinion."}
{"text":"By far the best place to get Chinese food! I love the beef and broccoli. Give the Asian cafe a try. Good prices. The people that own the place are very welcoming."}
{"text":"I was a bit skeptical when I went in I pass by all the time but when I went in they were very welcoming and nice I got a few thing and dined in they made me feel comfortable . The food was good  pretty simple .try to the mushu chicken ."}
{"text":"Sorry to report that the Asian Cafe closed permanetly today, phone disconnected and door locked during lunch time."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!!! The only down side is that they don't deliver. The quality taste and freshness are incredible for price! They also have lunch and dinner specials 7 days a week and are with open until 10 or 11p every night: ) Their general taos, fried wontons and egg rolls are great! I'm trying the fried dumplings, Mongolian beef and like neon tomorrow!!! Please try, it's cheaper than a fast food value meal but 100x better!"}
{"text":"The service was great. The duck,  vegetables and sticky rice were perfectly cooked except the onions. The onions still had a raw taste to them. If the onions were cooked first for 10 minutes then the rest of the veggies were added the spicy duck would have been perfect. Ill still come here again though."}
{"text":"This is a great local takeout joint. Prices are reasonable, the food has not disappointed yet. The family who runs it are pretty friendly and service is quick. I would recommend to anyone looking for some good, inexpensive Chinese takeout with generous portions."}
{"text":"Really good, the people are very nice and make the food fast and it always tastes really good. Noodles are excellent"}
{"text":"I am giving this place three stars because of the cost for plain white rice. $5 for white rice is outrageous for any Asian restaurant. And the rice just average at best...oh yeah because it is plain white rice."}
{"text":"The thai food was not good. The crab rangoons were edible. The pad thai was terrible.  The chicken seemed fake. I love thai food and can pretty much eat any sort of noodle dish, but I just threw it away. Maybe their Chinese food is better?"}
{"text":"after reading the good reviews and with it being so close, I had to try it. I had high hopes since I love Chinese... but where do I begin... this is my first negative review, and one of few bad experiences I've ever had. one star for the guy at the counter being nice. that's all I could say is a positive. the place was empty save a small old tv in the corner with a taped over vhs player.  the food.. can we call it that? I've been to over 30 other Chinese restaurants in the valley alone, and this is the worst Chinese I have ever had. the rice was dry, falling off my fork. the noodles tasted awful. nothing was fresh. as a former chef I can tell you that it all sits at temp until ordered.  the king pow was hot and tasteless, if it had been fresh it wouldn't  be so soggy. the crab puffs had no crab, just cream cheese, with no flavor. my teriyaki chicken was just chicken covered in a sauce from a bottle. even the white rice was over cooked from sitting all day. I don't care if it's 11am or 7pm, you don't just serve stuff sitting around all day!!  in conclusion I really wish it was good, but I'll settle for the other awesome places a few miles away."}
{"text":"My fiance and I stopped in for lunch. It's a small restaurant with very little ambiance: your typical Asian take out restaurant. It was really hot though. No air on and in the 80's outside. We both ordered a lunch special. I had beef and broccoli and he got General Tso's chicken. The eggrolls were meh. Mostly cabbage, not great flavor. I enjoyed the beef and broccoli and it was a good portion size for lunch.  His chicken was overcooked and the sauce was just average. Not a bad experience but we won't likely return."}
{"text":"We tried this place on a friend's recommendation.  Glad we did!  Nice variety of menu items (some Thai and Chinese).  Favorite item was the Bangkok Shrimp, but it is pretty spicy!  Next favorite would be the Kung Pao Combo, which states it is spicy on the menu, but I only found it to have a medium kick to it.  So good!  Fav appetizer would be the Crab Rangoon.  The woman who usually works the counter and answers the phone is so very friendly....total sweetheart.  They also give you cans of soda, randomly, with your order.  We usually order enough for 2-3 people and always bring home 3 cans of soda."}
{"text":"Very good little Chinese restaurant! I chose take out, however they do have tables for you to dine inside.  I ordered the general tsos combo with fried rice and an egg roll. The general tsos chicken and fried rice were delicious! The sauce had a nice tangy taste, not spicy, but a little kick. My egg roll was unfortunately a spring roll which was disappointing when I opened it, but it was still good if I had ordered spring rolls.  The woman inside was very sweet and friendly. Plus, the price was right and food was quick and hot when I got home! My fortune cookie was stale which I looked forward to :( but oh well!  I will definitely be back again soon!"}
{"text":"This spot is the standard chinese food spot. nothing to special but nothing wrong. I randomly felt like chinese and have driven by this place a thousand times so wandered in. Seems family owned.  We got a non-menu item, lo mein noodles with sheshwan sauce. I got sweet and sour pork combo. soooo the combo not only came with my pork but also crab puffs, rice, an eggroll, lo mein noodles, it was crazy for 7.50.  cant go wrong if your in the mod for some cheap chinese."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with the quality at this restaurant, especially because it seemed it was owned and operated by an Asian family. For Pittsburgh area, it's not that bad, but I used to live in Dallas and Houston, both of which have extremely diverse, quality dining options. The food here had a very fake, manufactured flavor, like what you'd get from a frozen Healthy Choice meal. In my opinion, even Panda Express is better."}
{"text":"This place is probably one of my favorite lunch spots in there area besides getting some Chino action in my life. Food is all that you'd expect from an Americanized Asian joint. The price is the gem. The lunch specials are stellar. If you pay more than $7 you're ordering wrong.   The portions are plenty generous for the price. The place is clean, friendly, and fast. All things that I value very much during my limited lunch hour. I go 1-2 times a week, and have yet to be disappointed. Give it a go"}
{"text":"We found this little place near as hopping plaza that we go to occasionally. It's on the corner of a building. When you walk inside there are 3 booths and a table. It was so cold that the woman who was taking orders was wearing a coat. BBRRRR We checked out the lengthy menu. They have lunch specials every day from 11-3pm-including weekends. The lunch special includes your choice of soup  or an egg roll. We went with egg rolls. I ordered Sesame Chicken and my hubby ordered Hunan Shrimp.  When the egg rolls came the had a nice color and a good crispiness on the out side. The inside was 99% cabbage and small specks of pork. It was disappointing.  Once we were done with the egg rolls out entrees came. My Sesame Chicken had a nice crunch to it. The sauce was sweet which caught me off guard. It didn't make it inedible, it was just a surprise. There prices of chicken were a good size and it was a pretty big portion for a lunch. I had ordered fried rice. It was okay... nothing to write home about.  My husband's Hunan Shrimp had a generous portion of shrimp. It tasted really good. The veggies with it were carrots, mushrooms, and broccoli. They actually had a crunch factor which we prefer over smoothly.  Our bill was $15 which is crazy for the portion size. You get a lot for your money."}
{"text":"We were in the Hampton area picking up an online flea market item and decided we should stop for lunch. My youngest son was with us and he loves vets Chinese food. I saw this place and pulled in. It's in a tiny plaza with only a couple of businesses. The cafe is family run. The mom was taking calls for take out food. The young daughter was waiting tables. The grandma was cooking. There are only a handful of tables. It was very clean and smelled very good. It did take a bit longer than we expected to get our food. I was hoping once we got it that it would be noteworthy. It wasn't. I had the Sesame Chicken. It was fresh cooked but lacked some flavor. My husband and son said the same about their dishes. If you are looking for basic fast food Chinese this fits the bill. Looking for a bit more, then just keep driving."}
{"text":"Great food. Since I live up street it usually takes about 10-15 mins to get my order and it's hot by the time I pick it up. Friendly cashier."}
{"text":"I have to admit they have the best crab puffs I have ever tasted and the egg rolls do not stay behind.I enjoy the food I order which was teriyaki chiken with Lo mein. The cashier was very friendly and helpful. Most definitely I will be going back."}
{"text":"This little place has been in our neighborhood for quite some time, I don't know why I never visited it before. Perhaps it is the abundance of Chinese restaurants that we have. Or, the fact that I really do not like those grab and go take out Chinese joints. But, a week ago I decided to give it a try and guess what? I'm back again. The former Kentucky fried chicken restaurant has been converted. There are tables and they offer table service. Although I did not dine in.  There were two people there both times I went, a man and a woman. Both are extremely pleasant, the woman smiles when she talks to you. She makes you feel warm and welcome. And you can see that they are working hard in the kitchen making the food from scratch. Not the premade foods that you find in many quick fix Chinese.  The main reason I went back is because of the dumplings. There is a certain dumpling that I absolutely love. That you cannot find anywhere but on some buffets. They are not your typical dumpling. You know, the ones that are crescent moon shaped and an inch or so thick, the dough is heavy, and the meat inside is a giant clump. While tasty, they aren't my thing. But! Asian café has the dumplings I love. They're different. They're flat. There are about 2 inches long and the dough is paper thin and melts in your mouth. As long as they don't change just dumpling recipe I will keep on going back.  I'm a creature of habit. When I find something I like I stick with it. Rarely do I vary off the normal path of my ordering or I get disappointed. The last time I was there I had mei fun noodles, this time I opted for the shrimp lo mein. Needless to say I was not disappointed. I was very happy with my choice. The shrimp was tender, and the noodles dance with flavor. They weren't dry like most places, the noodles and sauce were moist. I have to try the eggroll next time. And perhaps the soup. I didn't do so today because I didn't want to crush my appetite on those dumplings. That was the main reason I went.  Asian café is a winner! I plan on visiting this place often. Especially since my favorite restaurant Chinese restaurant has now closed down. Take a chance you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"It's a very nice family business! the food is always fresh and delicious!! There restaurant is so clean even the kitchen! I love coming here!!"}
{"text":"Very impressive especially for the price. Above average lo mein (which is so hard to find around here) and amazing crab rangoons."}
{"text":"I loved the soup and the egg rolls were very good, but the entrees (orange chicken and sesame chicken) were dry and generally sub par. Dinner is t happening there again, but I will drop in for the egg rolls!"}
{"text":"Ordered Delivery at 7:55pm & was told 45 minutes or so ... .  (my apartment is only 5 minutes away from establishment)  Food was delivered at 8:10!   I bought the chicken and broccoli combo, and general Tso combo. Both were fresh and piping hot!  The combo included 2 crab puffs, and and eggroll. Yummy!  The chicken and broccoli was perfect! But the General Tso is probably the worst I've had ever (sorry) but it was mostly breading (that was deep fried and burnt) and no sauce.    Otherwise it was fast, hot, and 1/2 yummy!"}
{"text":"Both of our cats had to visit a veterinarian in Castle Shannon last week, and instead of opting for mere fast food, I urged Kay to stop by this brick 'n mortar restaurant whose glaringly illuminated canary yellow sign was hard to miss along the way.  Choosing take-out due to our precious young feline cargo, we ordered Malaysian Satay Style Beef, Pineapple Duck, and an octet of steamed dumplings.   The steamed dumplings were flawlessly doughy and amply stuffed with minced pork.   The Malaysian Satay Style Beef centered around a slew of supple beef strips and the titular sauce, all which were hidden in a jungle of onions and scallions with the odd halved peanut adding a textural dimension to this adequately filling and favorable dish.   Kay's Pineapple Duck suffered slightly from the poultry itself, which while appetizing enough was just a tad less tender and fatty than what we're used to. However, the caramelized pineapple cubes, snappy/sweet sauce, and the crispness of the duck's skin would hold up the bottom end enough to keep it from being forgettable.   That Asian Cafe usurped the throne of a fast food restaurant is encouraging for an area that is still all too often dismissed as homogenous and corporatized. Support this above average haven for Chinese and Thai cuisine with your wallets and appetencies.   P.S. The clean, bright interiors are sparsely decorated save for some wall art, a waving Oriental cat, and vivid menu signage. The service itself was faster than expected (I thought it might take a while for the food to be cooked), cordial, and the packaging was highly effective. Our entrees were placed inside aluminum pans which were placed carefully into a large brown paper bag that was stapled shut and sheathed with a plastic bag that had handles for carrying. Alas, dinner was still hot when we arrived home 20 minutes later!"}
{"text":"New place in an old KFC.  Nice and clean with 3 booths and 4 tables.  Probably more of a take out place. The person taking the orders and delivering the food was very nice and friendly.  The menu lists it a #1 of 4 family locations in other Pittsburgh neighborhoods but the name did not come on up any searches, so probably have different names.   The Hunan Beef and Chicken Lo Mein where pretty good.  The Hunan had a little heat/spice and had some fresh veggies and some canned veggies."}
{"text":"Had the udon noodles with shrimp soup style and they were fantastic. The broth was savory paired with the thick noodles and the shrimp were fresh and delectable."}
{"text":"I love this place! I've never had such good Chinese food. The service is always good and fast. Not bad prices."}
{"text":"Delicious! The orange chicken is a lot sweeter than most - but still very good! I love their Thai Spicy Chicken. The Lo Mein isn't as good as other places, but still acceptable. Definitely try out this little cafe if you're in the area and are looking for great Chinese food!"}
{"text":"I got the hot and spicy lo mein with chicken and shrimp and was so relieved that it wasn't terribly spicy. I usually get house hot sauce on the side but wanted to go bold this time. The black bean sauce was AMAZEBALLS and the shrimp were the fresh kind, not frozen.   Owner was no-nonsense and straightforward. Limited seating inside so maybe I can count on this place for take out in the future. Dinner prices were kind of higher for Chinese food but I guess portions were generous. I want to figure out the water situation though since they hand out bottled water when you ask for water by default. Not sure if these are an upcharge and I should have asked.   I tend to avoid 22 esp on the Murrysville side as traffic is horrible, so I don't see myself coming here too often. I would recommend based on taste alone though :)."}
{"text":"I called and place an order for delivery it took an hour and a half for delivery once I get my food my orders was not complete their solution for fixing the problem was bringing me out the sauce that was missing and that's going to take another 20 minutes so by then my food will be cold. Don't get delivery for this place."}
{"text":"Consistently good Americanized Chinese food. The pad thai is ok although it is usually too spicy even if I specify that I don't want it to be spicy. However, the wonton soup is my absolute favorite! (The teenaged girl who runs the register and answers the phone is alarmingly mature and professional.)"}
{"text":"What a hidden gem in this town(?)    I walked in and was greeted by a petite woman who was very friendly,   The interior is what you would find in most asian cuisine style restaurants, but was clean and nice.    I went with a sesame chicken plate with brown rice and vegetable. What flavor came from this plate of food. The broccoli and mixed vegetables were delicious and fresh and the food was served fast and HOT!! The way I like it because it gives you time to eat slow and still have a plate of hot food in front of you.."}
{"text":"okay, but not nearly as good as this batch of reviews makes it sounds.    kind of cheap, but a little bit greasy  plenty of choices nearby that will get  you better quality for the same $"}
{"text":"Best Chinese restaurant around! I have been ordering from here for years. I easily pass 2 other Chinese restaurants on my way to picking up takeout from this one and it is so worth the trip! Their service is incredibly fast, they have a large menu and everything is reasonably priced. I highly recommend Asian Cafe."}
{"text":"The food and service was outstanding. The soup and lo mien delicious.  Thai spicy shrimp as well."}
{"text":"We are California transplants - we have tried many different varieties of food.  I will say that we keep coming back to the Asian Café because their food is good.  From the soup to the curries - all of their food is amazing.  Their ingredients are fresh and MSG free from what I can tell.  I have tried other local Asian restaurants and soon after - major headache - for me not using MSG is important.  My favorite is to take the Red Curry - and the sweet and sour chicken (chicken) and mix those two together...sooo good!  You can eat in or take out.  Keep in mind this is not PF Changs - not fancy.  But for food this good - who cares.  Enjoy!"}
