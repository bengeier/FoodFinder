{"text":"Yum yum yum!!! I haven't tried a single dish that I haven't liked! The decor may be outdated, but you absolutely must try the homemade coconut ice cream!"}
{"text":"The food is very good and the spicy dishes do have some heat.  Tends to somewhat pricey, for the size of the portions."}
{"text":"The only place in town where I'm able to get my bubble tea fix! When ordering food, you're asked what level of heat you'd like, based on a scale of 1 to 10. My last meal was much spicier than I was expecting for the number I chose, but it was still tasty nonetheless."}
{"text":"I'm so happy to find an Asian restaurant in Lake County beyond the typical Americanized Chinese takeout places!  I ate lunch at Thai Orchid a few weeks ago with a colleague. That night, my mom asked me to pick up takeout from the same place. Even though I'd already eaten there once that day, not only did I agree, but I ordered exactly the same thing for dinner that I'd had for lunch! It (the yellow curry with tofu) was that good!  Thai Orchid has good Thai food in an atmosphere that (I'm assuming) isn't intimidating, even if you're completely unfamiliar with Thai food. Each menu item has an explanation of the dish, which is really helpful.  The service is excellent, the prices are really good, and the portions are sized perfectly - I get two solid meals from one dinner entree."}
{"text":"The flavors!  The food at this hidden gem in Mentor is always so delicious.  They use curry, coconut milk, hot peppers, and many other wonderful things in their dishes.  Even with all the different ingredients, the flavors manage to not only blend, but to also be distinguished.  Oh, and the whole red snapper entree?  Awesome."}
{"text":"Eat here quite a bit.  Always get vegetable pad Thai and spring rolls.  Always done very well.  Last couple of times I noticed the veggie pad thai is becoming less veggie and more  like  noodle pad thai.  Too expensive for just a bowl of noodles.  The flavor is consistently good. Just specify more vegetables from now on.  As far as the service...... Always good."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants ever.  The restaurant is not much to look at but the food is phenomenal.  My favorites include the potak soup or the seafood basil, but ive yet to order something from them that wasn't delicious."}
{"text":"Service was terrible from the day server. No hello at the door just attitude and disrespect. Luckily she left after I ordered my appetizer. Unfortunately she neglected to tell the person who was taking care of me. After that the service improved exponentially. The muscles appetizer was amazing. Spicy and sweet. The duck was good. I haven't ever tried so I wasn't sure what to expect. Over all of recommend not coming in the morning but try it at least once."}
{"text":"YUM - PAD THAI & GINGER ICE CREAM ?  Oh yeah.  My new addiction --- homemade ginger ice cream.  For a nominal fee, you get a big bowl of ice cream.  I was shocked at the size of it.  And let me tell you --- IT'S TO DIE FOR !!!   And the Pad Thai \"ain't bad either.\"  Wow, so happy with my meal, I went back a week later and ordered the same thing to go !"}
{"text":"One of the best Thai restaurants in Cleveland.   The food is authentic and tastes delicious.   The menu is full of great choices even for greenhorns.  The prices are fair.    All of the servers know me and remember not just me but my daughter and they also remember what we like to eat.  The waitresses cover large sections (sometimes one person for the whole restaurant on days when they don't expect a lot of business) so maybe reviewers who didn't like their service should try being a little nicer.    Their curries, pad thai, and kao ka pao are superior... hands down... to several other high profile thai restaurants.  Some favorites of mine Kao Ka Pao Rad Na Pad kee mao Green curry Red curry Panang curry Chicken basil Eggplant  Firehouse duck Pad thai Sticky rice desert   Everything comes out looking nice.    If you insist on midwest tastes and large portions of unadulterated meat, you probably won't like it.  But if you enjoy adventurous tastes, you will love it."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for lunch. I crave it constantly. The food is so fresh and always hot and delicious. The prices are fair and the portions are perfect."}
{"text":"I have going to Thai Orchid for several years. The food is by far some of the best Asian you'll find in the area, and includes fare that stands out from your average cuisine. The curries are amazing, and the are many nontraditional dishes available you'll not find at many of the other hole in the wall Chinese joints. I recommend the Pad Kee Mao, and regardless of sitting in or getting takeout, you won't be dissapointed."}
{"text":"Thai Orchid was my first Thai experience, and it did not disappoint. My main dish was curried duck. It was enormous and delicious. It was probably enough for two people. I consider myself a heifer and i brought some leftovers home.   On top of the good food, the service was awesome. The waiter went over our menu questions in detail and with a smile on his face. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised!  The dumplings and Thai Orchid rolls were very good, sauces were delicious.  The Veggie Curry with tofu was very flavorful.  They are not shy on the spice levels!!!  Will definitely stop again when in the area!"}
{"text":"We have been dining at Thai Orchid  since they were located on Mayfield Rd . It is our Families Favorite Thai Restaurant in NE Ohio. The food is always Excellent very Authentic  and staff is very  friendly and attentive. We travel from Hudson and look forward to every visit. It has recently been renovated and looks very nice. Can't wait to go back...."}
{"text":"3.5 stars really. Why not more? The Summer rolls had to large of pieces of cucumber for me. Some may lime it this way but I like mine julienned more. But don't let that keep you away. The flavors are fantastic. But if you have time...drive to Akron and eat at Thai Pho...now thats Thai food!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent! The waitress who is always here remembered us and our tastes from nearly 6 months ago. Great experience as always!"}
{"text":"Pros: Delicious curry plates, and the spring rolls are tasty when hot! Cons: Totally unfriendly (Western) waitress who was downright rude.  She judged us the moment we walked in.  We would come back however, for take out only.  We rated a 3 star based on service/wait staff person only.  The food gets a 5 star!"}
{"text":"I really wanted thai food so decided to try one more time, for TAKEOUT only. The snippyness of the girl behind the counter put me off, she was in the phone so I sat on the bench to look at the menu. I turned around to look at my car and made the mistake of looking down. The whole ledge was covered in dead bugs, so disgusting. Needless to say I left and went to the hibachi place in the mall. At least they kind of clean."}
{"text":"No other restaurant like this in the Mentor area.  That is just one of the great reasons to eat here.  Mentor is full of chain restaurants, and the Chinese or Japanese restaurants are so so when it comes to Asian cuisine.  This Thai food is the real deal. The food is as good as any  Thai restaurant we have tried, and we have been to several in the Cleveland area and other states.  We have eaten here at least 8-10 times now. We originally tried it because it is closer than going to Asia town in Cleveland....but come back because the food is  just so good.  Always consistent.  Bee is generally our waitress, and she is always friendly and helpful....they get quite busy here on Friday and Saturday evenings, but Bee's demeanor stays polite and courteous.  Some of the dishes we have tried are several of the curries (spiced just right), Pad Thai, Rad Na, Pad See U, and Pine Nut....any of these can be made vegetarian by choosing tofu over meat.  The tofu is done just right with a slightly coated outside and soft texture middle.  Save room for the homemade ice cream....coconut, mango, or green tea.  For an extra treat, get it served over their sweet warm sticky rice.  My wife and I always share, and it's plenty for two.  We have also had mango slices served with the sticky rice....also very good"}
{"text":"Amazing Lemon Grass Soup (as good as any I've had in Phuket or Bangkok), great green curry and decent pad thai. (Yes, I know that is the quintessential standard and I haven't 'truly' tried their food, but it is my standard comparision for thai restaurants!)  Couple that with friendly servers and a decent beer/wine list, and this is a place that I plan on revisiting, and revisiting soon.   For 5 stars, I would either want a slightly better price/combination options or a full bar. It's neither upscale dining, or inexpensive. Still great great great food though!"}
{"text":"A lovely, quiet setting with delicious food and great service.  Especially love the chicken coconut soup.  Haven't found a dish I haven't enjoyed.  While the yelp site states no alcohol, they do have beer and wine ... A decent selection at reasonable prices.  And as another reviewer noted, for a restaurant within a shopping plaza, the ambiance is inviting and peaceful.  Give it a try ... I think you'll enjoy it."}
{"text":"Today was a special day for two reasons, i was able to spend some quality time with my daughter and we got to spend it eating lunch at Thai Orchid. I have eaten here numerous times before, but this was the first time for my daughter Cara. We started out with Thai Orchid wraps which are my favorite. If you go for lunch you have to ask for them because they aren't on the lunch menu. I love them because they are so fresh with the ricewrap, carrots, lettuce, bean sprouts and thin slices of chicken. The sweet, hot and spicy sauce they serve with it is so good I could drink it with a straw. I ordered Spicy string beans with brown rice (it's a dollar extra). This dish has chicken, string beans, peppers and spicy peanut sauce. My daughters choice was Kao Ka Pao. It consisted of chicken sautee'd in garlic, hot pepper, string beans, mushroom and fresh basil, served with a crispy egg on the side. She asked for extra spicy and to leave the crispy egg in the kitchen. We both loved our dishes!  If your looking for a great Thai restaurant , this is the place to go."}
{"text":"$8.75 for Chicken pad Thai that was not flavorful, and the chicken was a strange consistency... like rubber. There were maybe 3 small slivers of green onion and a few been sprouts. I've made much better pad Thai at home. Won't be going back. :("}
{"text":"Wow, I was pleasantly surprised by this place. I put their food in the same echelon as Banana Blossom and Thai Fun for sure. The dumplings were probably the best ones I have ever tasted, and the dipping sauce is divine. Pad Kee Mao was killer good. I loved that they used the wide, thick noodles in it. I forgot to tell them the spice level I wanted so unfortunately my food was not as spicy as I would like.  But nonetheless, it was flavorful.  Solid Thai choice. Yay!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here for lunch with Powell. Overall, food flavor was good, service was fantastic! Complaints over one dish, but portions were well sized.   He got unsweetened tea and the Tofu Royale. I got diet coke and Penang Curry w/ shrimp.   Things we loved:  -- Penang Curry was spot on! Perfect portion size (not too much curry, but enough for all pieces to be bathed in a delicious puddle). Shrimp were a good size and perfectly cooked. Overcooked shrimp happens so often, I was pleasantly surprised. I should have asked for a little more mild, but the server mentioned that the peppers today were particularly hot...  -- The tea!! Good proper Thai style Ceylon tea without the condensed milk. It was so refreshing and surprisingly strong. I kept stealing sips, much to my husband's annoyance.   -- Service! Fantastic server, w braided hair. She was lovely, managing to pay attention to everyone (8 or 9 tables!) while smiling and chatting.   -- Price!! (Less than or equal to) $10 per person. And we're both stuffffffed.   Things we did not love: -- It's called Tofu Royale. There was about 2 cups or bean sprouts and 5 lil cubes of tofu. Not very tofu, not very royale. Although flavor and portion sizes were pretty fantastic.   Conclusion: -- Would definitely come back! The pad thai looked stellar and the flavors were so surprisingly authentic.  (I love Ohio, but I miss well flavored asian foods that aren't brown sauce based are hard to come by...) Will just have to not get Tofu Royale and try something else!!"}
{"text":"This Thai restaurant is great for a quick lunch! I called early to carry-out and my food was ready when I got there. The portion was quite small, but it was a good amount of food for the price."}
{"text":"Been here a few times now and every time it's always very good. I tried the spicy string bean with chicken, it was so good I never looked up from my plate. Of course I over ate again. 1/2 to 2/3 of this dish would have left me plenty full. Being fairly new to Thai cuisine this place makes it very easy to broaden my horizons"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews, I really wanted to give this a try.  After years of driving by I always thought it was only a take out place.  I'm so glad my boyfriend and I decided to check it out after I saw it on here.  We both love spicy food, but we don't like spicy just for the sake of being ridiculous.  So we both ordered menu items marked as spicy (marked as 3 peppers on their spicy scale) but where as normally we order our food extra spicy, we just ordered the meals as is.  And we were not disappointed at all.  It was spicy, but just the right amount, we were both still able to enjoy the flavors.  I got a dish with shrimp, beef, mango, tofu and veggies.  It was very flavorful and I opted for the rice noodles, although, next time I will choose the brown rice my boyfriend got as it is the puffy kind I love.  We started with the summer rolls in rice paper, very fresh and tasty, and we liked the sweet sauce they were served with.  We also both got the lemongrass shrimp soup, it was very flavorful and just the right amount of spice.  The cilantro really completes the flavor.  This will definitely be on my list when I go again, which I'm sure I will."}
{"text":"Worst Chinese food I've ever had. I had some dish that had some sort of ground meat on it. I honestly have no idea what it was since it was tasteless (it was supposed to be chicken). They did, however, try to mask the meat with the spiciest sauce known to man.   If you want Chinese, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"First time visitor on a Wednesday early afternoon.  The place was totally deserted, which seemed odd, but perhaps the lunch rush had come and gone already?  I got the Panang Curry with chicken, and asked that they fire up the heat as high as they knew how!  Heat was ok, but I've definitely had hotter at other Thai restaurants.  Ingredient quality was above average and approaching excellent, though I was somewhat disappointed at how little chicken was actually in the dish.  Green peppers seemed a bit soft.  In the end, it was a perfectly serviceable lunch at a fair price.  Thai Orchid won't be stealing the #1 spot on my favorite Thai restaurant list, but it's solidly in the top 10.  Will return."}
{"text":"I ordered carry out last evening for my family and I was not very pleased. I've been to this restaurant several times so we were looking forward to dinner. I ordered 4 entrees and 2 appetizers so I spent a few dollars. The appetizers were not good greasy tiny Spring rolls and 4 Crab Rangoon I thought there should have been a few more. I ordered Pad Thai  with shrimp which good, a bit on the dry side and it only came with 3 shrimp. Green curry  chicken my wife loved it. My son and I ordered Chicken with cashews and Sweet and Sour chicken. When we opened the containers it looked like we ordered onion and pea pod soup. Very very disappointed to say the least. I understand that Thai food and Chinese are two different things but come on. The sweet and sour was awful and no one wanted it. The sweet and sour sauce tasted like watered down catsup. The chicken and cashews was ok after thickening up the sauce. All in all not a good meal. I will not order carry out again and will not willingly visit again unless I'm out voted."}
{"text":"We had take out. Very good food. I would have liked more tofu and vegetables  in my pad Thai. Husband enjoyed his sweet and sour entre. Friendly  staff"}
{"text":"I have a new favorite every time I go!  The staff is friendly, and the service is fast.  Never had a complaint here."}
{"text":"The high overall rating on Yelp is unfortunately deceiving.  Words like \"slimy\" and \"chewy\" shouldn't be the first things I use to describe Pad Thai, but...what a slimy chewy mess.    As another reviewer stated, the spring rolls seem clearly frozen. Honestly, what stood out most to me about them was the amount of oil they deposited on my hands.  On the whole: grossly understaffed, awful food, and not recommended."}
{"text":"Every time I come to Cleveland I come here. Don't waste your time with anything else on the menu except the chicken ka ka pow. It is amazing. It comes with s little spice but I add hot sauce too. Their hot sauce has a great tomatoe flavor and is more flavor than heat. The fried eggs on top really sets the dish off.  I also got the coconut chicken soup. One of the best I ever had.  Really creamy if you like that kind of thing. It has an assortment of vegetables in it and a lot of chicken so you don't feel like you are just sucking down broth."}
{"text":"Surrounded by nothing but chain restaurants, Thai Orchid is something different in Mentor. I love Thai, and eat it very often, so I wasn't extremely impressed with this place but it was definitely a decent meal compared to anything else in the area. Our waitress was nice and suggested the beef basil dish for me since I like spicy stuff. My mom tried the green curry and she liked it okay.  We shared the lemongrass soup, which was similar to tom yum, and it was tasty but a small bowl for $5.  I was happy with my meal. Prices were about right and the portions were a good size. They have lunch and dinner menus. Cheaper and less options at lunch."}
{"text":"Thai Orchid has hands down some of the best Pad See Ew and curries I have ever had! And I've had a lot of Thai food in my life. Those alone are what keeps me coming back - reluctantly. The prices are what really get me every time. I can walk out of there with an entree and appetizer and somehow I've spent nearly $30. I know Thai food is on the more expensive side, but this place seems a little over the top. Unfortunately, Thai Orchid is now usually my last resort unless I'm feeling a little spendy that day, which is too bad because it's currently the closest Thai restaurant in my area."}
{"text":"Thought I'd give their newly introduced to the menu  \"bubble tea\" a try. I was rather disappointed. For $4.50 it's on the pricier side but I could literally count 10 bubbles in the entire cup. I even pointed it out when I picked it up and Stephanie(she also made the tea) at the front desk told me there were many, I just couldn't see them. What a load of BS.. but didn't want to argue. For a bubble tea connoisseur like myself.. I know she was straight up being stingy. This is probably the last time I would get it. The overall flavor wasn't too shabby so I give it 2 stars. Go to kokobakery in China town.. many more flavors, cheaper, lots of bubbles and no BS!"}
{"text":"I went in for a quick meal. I only had an hour to eat and they brought everything on a timely manner. The food was delicious and the server very pleasant to talk to. The ambience was sophisticated but not exclusive. Overall berry accommodating"}
{"text":"Went in last week. The place looked dirty.  A bunch of crap was laying around cluttering up the left front corner of the restaurant that was not being used. We sat down at a table and waited a while before the server came to the table. When she finally arrived at our table, she was rushing us to take our order. It was our first time there and we had some questions.  When we asked questions about the food, the server gave us generic responses by saying Thai is Thai. The prices were really expensive.  We just got up and left."}
{"text":"This is my mom's favorite Thai place - and each time I have visited her, we always make sure to eat here at least once!  Though it is situated in a horrible strip mall - such eyesores are hard to avoid in Northeastern Ohio, the Cleveland area is lousy with them - inside is a clean, well decorated restaurant - someone really put some thought into coordinating the furnishings without going over the top with Thai trinkets and memorabilia -  don't you hate going into a Thai restaurant that features exquisite headdresses and dance costumes but covered in dust?  This is not that place.  The food here is delicious and consistent - the service is always excellent.  The staff is very helpful in checking with the kitchen on the use of Nam Pla (fish sauce) and they are happy to make any of their dishes vegan-friendly (or hella spicy!).  It amazes me that this type of cuisine seems so novel and \"different\" to folks in these parts and you really do see a wide range in the other clientele.  On this particular luncheon date with my mother, we noticed two young men with dark skin who looked Indian - wearing the distinctive uniform of foreign programmers: tidy golf shirts and khaki slacks.    Their discussion of the menu indicated that this was their first time eating Thai food - and they must not have known what to expect. Before the food came, one of them stood up and took a couple of cloth napkins from the center row of tables that was set up for dinner - handed one to his friend - and both of them opened the napkin up, spread it across his own chest and then pinned it down with his arms - with the paper napkin across his lap. Fully bibbed - these men were prepared for a pie eating contest!  My mom and I tried to be polite (as in - not falling down laughing) - but I couldn't resist saying something to them - it was \"You know, if you eat more slowly, you won't get food all over the place!\""}
{"text":"This little strip-mall gem gets four star automatically because when they say \"very spicy\", they mean \"burn your face off.\" And I like it hot.   I met my Mom here for lunch recently and wasn't sure what to expect. Sometimes you find great treasures in suburbia, but most of the time it's pretty lame. But I trusted my mother's taste, since she rarely ever steers me wrong.  I'd say this was your typical, strip mall Asian decor--but the service was nicer than I was anticipating. I got there a little late and they close for dinner at 3pm. They told my Mom that it would be OK if we ran a little late and they had no issues with that.   While my taste buds most likely remember the burn, my brain can't quite remember the name of the dish I enjoyed. But damn it was good. Spicy chicken and veggies with basil on a heaping scoop of brown rice. I thoroughly enjoyed that you have a choice here between white rice and brown. My Mom had the spicy green beans which I also tried and really liked! Peanut sauce with a kick...I'm in!  Overall, I'd recommend this place if you're looking for Thai in the endless chain restos of Mentor suburbia. It's not fancy, but it's good and cheap. Oh, and they don't skimp on the heat when you say you like it spicy."}
{"text":"For the only Thai restaurant in the area, the food is good.    I went in one evening for take out and paid for my meal with a credit card and did not add a tip as it was take out.  Once I got my credit card statement, I found that a 25% tip was added to my bill without my authorization.  When I notified them, they didn't seem concerned that this happened and I am still waiting for a refund over a month later.  Word to the wise, pay in cash if you go."}
{"text":"My wife and I were in the area for an event on a Friday night and decided to come here thinking it would be similar to the old Thai Orchid in Lyndhurst. It does not seem to be the same place, we asked one of the servers who said that she didn't think it was. Oh well.  Pros: Food came out quick. Menu was easy to navigate. Pad Thai Woon Sen was very good. Homemade coconut ice cream was excellent.  Cons: The chicken coconut soup was very strange, not bad, but different than most other Thai restaurants (it was garnished before serving with a dried red chili and cabbage pieces, it had baby corn pieces in it, canned mushrooms instead of fresh). Music was much too loud and consisted of a contemporary pop music Pandora station (with commercials I might add - if Pandora's going to be your restaurant's soundtrack then at least spring for Pandora One and save us from the ads!). Carpet looked old and dirty.   For a Friday night at 8PM it was strangely slow. Partly I would assume due to the location in a strip mall that also contains a Melt Bar and Grilled.  Probably would not return anytime soon."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Mentor.  Great Pad Thai & Thai Orchard rolls (cold and not fried).  Excellent soups, fried rice.  I could go on and on!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Thai places anywhere! They know how to do spicy, and have great Pad Thai and curries. Be sure to check out Mango & Sticky Rice, which isn't on the lunch menu but is delicious when mango's in season!"}
{"text":"Been coming to Thai Orchid for about 10 years at their previous location. however haven't been in the past few years since the new owner took over. Was always my standard for good Thai food until now.   Their Massaman Curry now has too thin of sauce. Very watered down compared to other places, which doesn't bring out the flavor as much. The chicken satay has a slightly different spice, but still standard satay. Golden rods are still great (tempura fried sweet potato appetizer). They definitely have changed the peanut sauce recipe, as this was more watered down as well.  Service was good as it was pretty empty inside. They forgot to add something to my order, so they were nice enough to give us 10% off. Overall, not bad, but not the best I've had."}
{"text":"Worst thai food i've ever had. hands down. no competition. Watery curry, no flavor to the old favorite pad thai (and unusually pink color to the noodles?)....Never before thought I could be so disappointed. Not sure how long this place has been in business, and I'm not really sure why it still is to be honest. They need some thai cooking lessons back in their kitchen. Overpriced for what it was, and definitely not worth a trip. East side fails yet again."}
{"text":"Typed in \"Indian Food Mentor\" in Google, and this place came up. Failing to actually read the name of the resturant, I arrived at \"Thai Orchid\", only to realize there was no Indian food to be found. While dining, my mind was continuously occupied by the ceiling, which I desperately wanted to turn upside down and skate in. If you've been there, you know what I'm talking about. I got the \"Red Curry\" with \"Seafood\", which consisted of \"shrimp\", \"calamari\", and some other creatures that live (Lived. Ha.) in the sea that apparently have shells which \"are not edible.\" Anyway, despite it not being Indian food and the non-edible shell incident, the food was fantastic. I will be back."}
{"text":"Great veggie pad Thai and spring rolls. Fast service, modest prices and huge portions. What's not to like??"}
{"text":"The vegetable quality is now improved but the amount of chicken, beef and shrimp they're adding is decreasing. Please get a scale and weigh out the meat portions to be fair to your customers."}
{"text":"I felt that giving this place one-star would have been made my review appear biased and affected by a single bad experience here; this is not the case. This last trip was the final straw, which is sad to say because I used to get pretty decent Thai food from Thai Orchid.  The food prepared here is about as old and tired as everything else in this restaurant. It's safe to say that the bathrooms (surprisingly clean) are probably the cleanest part of the restaurant.   Everything on the table, including the menus had a remnants of old sauces food particles from previous meals stuck on, not to mention a nice greasy sheen. I'll come here if I need anything to keep pesky stray hairs in place if I'm away from home.  The food was pretty close to inedible. The spring rolls and chicken wings were both clearly frozen and, if not for the sauces (same sauce for both items) would have been completely tasteless.   The entrees ordered were the beef Panang curry and the chicken Rad-Na. Both meats were incredibly tough and made the dishes additionally unappealing. The taste of the curry was a bit off even, which was surprising. The only thing that was somewhat interesting about the rad-NA dish were the dumpling-like consistency noodles; they weren't good, just interesting since I had never had noodles that had the chew of a dumpling before.  To top it off, the presentation of the all of our food seems the chefs and the owners clearly do not care any more, which is sad and unfortunate."}
{"text":"This is my husband and I's go to place in the area for Thai food! We usually pick up. Never had any issues. They are very fast and the food is always great. I enjoy the spring rolls and Pineapple fried rice. My husband enjoy the Beef Basil."}
{"text":"I'm not that impressed with Thai Orchid. It is an average restaurant with average food. The service has always been good and the restaurant itself is clean and comfortable. I want so badly to like this place but I have had way too much great Thai food. It's fine for when you want some Thai food in a pinch but I would definitely try other places in the greater Cleveland area."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Spice levels can be hit or miss, so be careful before you ask for the extra spicy, but otherwise really great!"}
{"text":"I got a Pad Thai to go, so I can't really say much about the restaurant atmosphere but the food was good for an all american town like mentor. I come from the greater NYC area so I have had better. Trust me its extremely hard to find good Asian food in this area so I'm glad this is here.  Changed to 3 stars cause my stomach was in pain for a long time after eating this."}
{"text":"What a nice thai hole in the wall. The atmosphere inside was quite and enjoyable. The thai orchid wrap..., decent, probably wouldn't get them again. But the curry...wow! The panang curry had just enough heat and a nice kick. The masaman curry was a little sweeter and nuttier with no heat, but still great! Would highly recommend Thai Orchid, and definitely will be back"}
{"text":"Amazing service. Amazing food. I went with my boyfriend and his parents for his birthday. We started off with the crab rengoon. This is not your average Chinese restraint style. The filling is not too much, and the pastry around it..to die for! Same with the sauce it comes with! His mom got the drunken noodle. It had such good flavor. Between myself, my boyfriend and his dad, we tried three different currys. All amazing. We even got to try all three home made ice creams for his birthday. Delicious! I will be back for sure!!!!"}
{"text":"Best and perhaps the only Thai food in this area. All of their curry dishes are delicious. The servers are so sweet and kind!! The price is average but won't break the bank. Maybe not the place for you if you don't enjoy a little spice!"}
{"text":"Pad Thai and the curry dishes are excellent choices here and its a delight to see Mentor with this thai option.  I have only been for lunch and have been pleased with the quality of the food.  I agree with Denise on the Lemongrass soup...great flavor but they need to nix the canned mushrooms in the soup and just use fresh.  Still worth ordering though...especially on a cold winter day!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing food. I've eaten here many times and have never had a bad experience. I love the spicy string beans with chicken. My honey always has the duck which is always delicious. Try the quack quack rolls, stuffed chicken wings and the lemongrass soup as well. Great food and good service."}
{"text":"It's about time Mentor got a decent Thai place. Comfortable, clean and service was professional. We shared the crab rangoons which were okay. We really enjoyed our entrees however. I got the fisherman's party, which had a nice spicy green curry. Could have used some more seafood in there but the flavor and spice level were very good. My wife got the chicken choo chee and it was also very tasty. We'll be back, although they could improve their beer selection."}
{"text":"Just no. Service was really really slow when we went... and there was no one else in the restaurant. The food was okay. Not the best Thai food, not the worst, but definitely not good enough to go back."}
{"text":"There are much better Thai restaurants in the area.  Try Pad Thai in Hudson, Mekong River in Cleveland Heights or My Thai in Chesterland, all have significantly better food."}
{"text":"This is definitely my new favorite restaurant! I'd never had the pleasure of trying Thai food before, but now it's safe to say I'm hooked.  Thai Orchid has an excellent menu with just enough options and room for variability without it being overwhelming. With extensive selections ranging from stir fry, fried rice and more with chicken, beef, duck, pork, shrimp and fish options that leave you wanting to try something new every time you go there.  My favorite menu items are the Pad Kee Mao (Flat rice noodles stir fried with a choice of beef, pork or chicken, garlic, egg, onion, broccoli, carrot, baby corn, Chinese broccoli, bean sprout, red pepper and basil for $12.00),  Baby Wings (7) (Marinated chicken wings in Thai herbs, deep fried until golden brown, served with sweet & sour chili garlic sauce for $7.00) and Satays (5) (Choice of marinated chicken or beef grilled on skewers, served with peanut sauce and cucumber salad for $7.00).  The atmosphere is wonderful, the food is consistently excellent, and the staff are a treat to be around! Consider going here if you'd like perfectly cooked Thai food at an affordable price."}
{"text":"Couldn't tell you much about this place unfortunately. We were heavily looking forward to dining here. Placed our order to be told a whole freakin hr later that they forgot to put it through to the kitchen ...you want to give them the benefit of the doubt but Whaaaaaaattttt?!!!ohhhhhh the fury!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a lovely neighborhood Thai spot. The staff received us warmly and provided courteous service. I had a generous helping of their pad Thai and it was slightly on the sweet but savory :) A fave of mine is their Curry puffs appetizer which comes with a cucumber syrup dip. So yum. The only desire that comes in mind is that they would provide a spice condiment tray most Thai restaurants bring to the table, so that we may adjust spice levels to our personal tastes with authentic Thai ground pepper or chili vinegar. (Really missing this common, almost standard offering.)  Also, i want to add that they have some of the better tasting spring rolls around. I've been burned by a few spots in Cleveland with bad spring rolls either off in flavor or texture, but here are uniformly crisp and simple spring rolls that make the mark."}
{"text":"Thai Orchid used to be pretty disappointing. This is really the only Thai food around (or exotic food of any sort in Mentor), and couldn't compare to restaurants Thai in cities like DC or Chicago.   Recently, however, Thai Orchid has really stepped it up a notch. The past two times I've visited, my dinners have been more than satisfying. The noodles curry is definitely a new favorite, as is the masaman curry and pad kee mao. They have a spice scale from 1-10. I got a 3 and my mouth was pretty much on fire, and I really love spicy foods. I'm becoming quite impressed with this place."}
{"text":"I would've probably never stopped in this shopping plaza restaurant had I not been googling for Thai places in the area, glad I found this place. Loved the penang curry, pad thai was pretty good. Spring rolls and golden sticks (deep fried sweet potato) didn't have much flavor, wouldn't order those again. Next visit I will stick to curry dish - definitely recommend for that. Portions are generous."}
{"text":"The green curry is outstanding. The pad Thai is so good, even my picky eater wife loves it.  Also try the bubble tea."}
{"text":"I rejoiced the day I learned Lake County was finally getting a sit-down Thai restaurant. The food is always great and it is one of my favorite places to go with friends and family and linger over a great meal and wonderful Jasmine tea."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place late evening around 8:30 on a Saturday night. The place looked decent from outside. Surprisingly this place wasn't packed on a Saturday night. Me and my one other friend ordered our food and drinks. It took about 20 mins for them to get the food which is OK with us. Apparently waitress forgot about our drinks even after she brought out the food. When she brought the drinks finally it had no fizz to it and it tasted very bland. We told her about it and she did not look surprised at all. Her response was something is wrong with the pop machine. She took it out of the bill. I was surprised by the fact that if you already know something is wrong with the pop fountain then why would you serve customers out of it. I probably would never go in there again even though food quality was ok , but the service we got was not impressive. Hope they step up their game."}
{"text":"Had family over and everyone said let's order from Thai Orchid. Went online to their menu. Called to place our order only to find online menu is not theirs. Revamped all nine dishes. Placed order for take out and told it would be 1 -1.5 hr wait!! Went to pick it up after waiting an hour. Told not ready yet. While waiting saw people come in, wait for someone and then saw then leave. Finally got order and asked to make sure the order was complete before leaving. Got home to find THREE meals missing! Tried calling and it took 30 min before the call was answered. Told them of problem and said they would fix it but had to come to pick it up. Went there and they were not going to adjust cost. Complained and they finally did some price adjustment. Overall, VERY POOR SERVICE & ATTENTION TO DETAIL!!  Will think twice about trying again."}
{"text":"I come here often and joined Yelp just to leave this review. This is a place in Mentor that has outstanding food and I have NEVER waited to be seated. The service is good. I recommend leaving room for their homemade ice cream. I can never decide between the ginger or coconut."}
{"text":"I've always passed by this restaurant and wondered how good it really is, so this weekend I took advantage of the the snowy weather and got some take-out. We ordered the traditional to see how good the food is.  Lemongrass Soup: Brothy, tangy and good. It reminded me of Tom Yum Soup. I was only disappointed to see canned mushrooms but delighted to see some fresh button mushrooms as well.  Panang Chicken Curry: This is my gauge to see how much I like the place, and Thai Orchid didn't disappoint. Well spiced and filling.  Pad Thai: Of course I had to try the pad thai as well. Ordered with shrimp although next time I might get pork or chicken. It was well made with a great tang that you would usually get with a squeeze of lemon that I would get at other thai restaurants.  It's a gem in the Mentor area which has a lot of chains and bar food."}
{"text":"I've, like, never been so sad to see a business I love so much have less stars than I think they should have. Thai Orchid just has the most delicious food! Now I love to get the Mango Choo Chee Curry. It's only on the dinner menu but you can order the dinner portion at lunch although it is almost twice as expensive as the other lunch options but is a bigger size. I get the green curry at lunch if I am not feeling spendy. I love so many things on the menu. My vegetarian friend gets Tofu Pine Nut on the Dinner Menu.   IDK, I mean... I would eat there every day - it's so good. The clientele is mostly low maintenance people who kinda know what they want and are chill. Lotsa business type people or middle aged ladies having lunch. So they only have one server for a million tables but it's not a highly \"server interactive\" type place. Of course they can help if you have questions and are always nice. Like, if you go into a thai place hopefully you a little know that it's Thai food (NOT CHINESE! as some goof said it was the worst Chinese food (in his review)) They are not a largely bubble tea kinda place - their thai iced tea is good but uber sweet.  IDK. Thai Orchid is so amazing. My heart hurts when I see people don't like it."}
{"text":"Short story- Pro- Very spicy if you ask for Thai hot- fantastic Large portions for appetizers and meal Con- Slow unfriendly service for most of the visit. Several orders wrong around me (you can't give a vegetarian beef by accident) and food brought to wrong tables more than once.   Started out awkward as I was walking in the host somehow assumed I was there for pickup and without a word walked to the back for like 5 minutes while I stood there confused. He brought the bag of food but of course it wasn't mine so waited several more minutes for them to arrange a table. Took even longer as couples sat after me were asked their meal choices before me. Really was getting a 0 at this point and I was  contemplating leaving.   Finally things turned around. The vegetarian rolls were good and you actually got a lot for your money. Well worth it compared to the 2 quantity you usually get.   I asked for a curry to be Thai hot and for ONCE it actually was hot! That spice is what saved this review. Spice and volume of food saved this from a 0.  This place needs to be more organized.  Better presentation  Better customer service"}
