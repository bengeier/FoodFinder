{"text":"Overall, I would recommend this restaurant to my friend.  

I came around 1:30pm, so i found parking immediately but i understand it could be troublesome at this plaza to find parking.  

It was my first time and it was a great experience.  They served green bean soup as a drink (taste ok) which is different than the other places.  I ordered the beef noodles soup.  Noodles and the soup are prefect!  They also have a paper on the table to educate you about their food and the drink which is nice to know.  

Price was decent between $9 to $10 for a bowl of noodles soup."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! There is one in Los Angeles and it's super popular. Always line up :) I'm glad there is one in Vegas now. Check it out people you won't be disappoint!"}
{"text":"The mung bean soup is delicious. Nice place to go off the strip for some authentic Chinese noodles. Prices are reasonable and service is friendly.  House beef noodle soup!"}
{"text":"We came to Las Vegas and stuck here due to Hurricane Harvey. We are all tired of American food and craving for some authentic Chinese food. We accidentally arrived this place and decided to give it a try. This is a small restaurant but is very clean. The staff here are very friendly. They have cool mung bean soup in this hot summer day for free and refill instead of ice water. They also brought in Sichuan pickles as our appetizer. The pickle was authentic, not like Cantonese styled. Their Manu is short but every single dishes are tasty just as it is supposed to be. We ordered spicy sour wonton, house special rib noodle and Chengdu minced meat noodle. All tasted fabulous!  We definitely will come back. It beats any buffet on the stop after several days away from home."}
{"text":"Perfect noodle, although it is too spicy for me, it is delicious for my friends. Strongly recommended if you are looking for Chinese noodle."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at this restaurant. I love Japanese ramen, and this Chinese noodle shop was great! It's pretty amazing food! I loved every bite. 
We did have one issue when inside. 
I did get full and couldn't finish my food, asked for the rest if it to go. And they accidentally threw my food away. 
But they remedied the situation by giving me some new food :) 
I really appreciate their generosity and Amazing food. 
Thanks again! Great experience"}
{"text":"Great place for noodle.  The noodle is very chewy and not sticky.   I tried the one in LA and this Vegas location is equally good."}
{"text":"I was here with my friend it was my first time here, so nice and clean especial good taste delicious food. I love it will be back again"}
{"text":"Food was authentic. Taste was good. I don't understand why they don't accept spliting bill. That was ridiculous. Would never come back."}
{"text":"Food is amazing here, prices are very reasonable. My husband and I came back twice in three days. Great service too!"}
{"text":"Taste like the noodles when i was in China a few weeks back. I'd come back when visiting Las Vegas again."}
{"text":"Very delicious noodle place. If you live the bold, spicy flavors that characterize Sichuan cuisine, then you will love Mian. 

Their soup broth very flavorful. I only tried the Hauxing Fried Egg Noodle, but it had a great tomatoey flavor to it. But what really blew me away about this place was their Chili Oil Chaoshou. The Chili Oil had such a deep and complex flavor. It was salty, sweet, spicy, savory... But none of the individual flavors were too overpowering. 

There's this cool modern style that resonates throughout the restaurant from their menus to the good presentation. I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best noodles in vegas. Great place. Eqsy simple menu. Perfect for hangovers"}
{"text":"This restaurant is truly a authentic Chinese cuisine. The cold dishes are very tasty. The service here is very nice. The waitress Elena is so friendly and helpful.The place is clean."}
{"text":"Unique, amazing flavors! We love Szechuan food but have never had it like this. We had the dumplings with spicy sweet sauce and the beef noodle soup. My mouth was on fire. Both were incredible- definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Great place to come for lunch. They have a simple easy menu with great options for appetizers..a must try, and a unique flavor when you try the spicy! Oh and free bean drink! It was delicious!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious and The Spice was just enough.  My upper
Lip is still burning but it was amazing.  The flavors of each dish were so good.  The cold
Noodles were the best."}
{"text":"I ordered hot and sour noodle. It has fried bins and veggie. It meets my expectation?I love it"}
{"text":"Great service and the House Beef Noodles are amazing. Authentic Chinese flavor. Careful - \"medium spicy\" is too spicy for many people!"}
{"text":"Love the complimentary beverage and the jello like dessert! Noodle was great too, but slightly on the oily side. Definitely will come back a lot!"}
{"text":"Richard Pro here with another review.

This place is nice and comfy when you walk inside and it's nice to sit in the semi-private booths. The menu is clean and simple. I tried the wontons and their noodles with ground pork.

They give you a big bowl of noodles and the broth is flavored nicely, albeit spicy. However at the end I realized I was still quite hungry, so really you're not getting enough bang for your buck. Yes you can order more noodles but by then you're out of meat and veggies to go with it.

The wontons are average but they charge an arm and a leg for them."}
{"text":"Very authentic sichuan noodles. The Mung bean soup as a cold drink is great! Pickled veggies and many noodle options. Will come back next time we are in LV."}
{"text":"Hands down the best beef noodle soup I've ever had.  That said, the pork dumplings were even better.  I know this place only just opened in Vegas but they need to open up one in Dallas too since we will be leaving soon!"}
{"text":"this has been my craving ever since I first tried this place out. it's currently my favorite place at the moment which is surprising because I'm a little b---h when it comes to spicy things. 

the staff is a little bit awkward, but are attentive and very helpful. the place itself is small and clean. the drawings and messages past customers write are very cute and unique. 

food: so my boyfriend hates the numbing spice. I don't mind spicy but my stomach minds it. a lot. so every time we order, he requests no numbing spice and I request less spicy. both of us are content with our foods every single time! my favorite item is the house beef noodle less spicy and it's the perfect amount of spice for me every time. 

also, I could live off of that mung bean soup. I'm not kidding. it pairs with their noodles so well. I just can't. 

the only thing we were slightly disappointed in was the steamed egg because it had little to no flavor. the texture was amazing, but it was pretty \"eh\" to us. but that's ok, I just want noodles and soup and we good."}
{"text":"Came here with a few friends on a weeknight. I'd give the food (4.5 stars) but the service was (2.5 stars). 

chengdu zajiang noodles with soup (4.5 stars)- this dish was not spicy with ground pork and thin noodles. We were informed that if we wanted more noodles we could get them free of charge. Dish was pretty flavorful and included some veggies as well. 

hot and sour chaoshou (3.5 stars)- same spicy soup as the hot and sour noodle soup dish. This was good with some spiciness to the dish, but if you order the hot and sour soup I wouldn't order this dish due to the same flavors. 

Chili oil chaoshou (4.5 stars)- we liked this dish better chili sauce at the bottom you mix the dumplings in. 

Service (2.5 stars)- we asked for a re-fill on the mung bean tea and were told to \"hold on.\" The server never came back and re-filled the tea. Also took a long time to order dessert. We had to flag down the server and shout across the room to get their attention. 

I would come here again for the food but the service wasn't that great."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on Monday after running around for smog check and hair cut (which both didn't happen btw because smog check had 3 cars ahead and my hair stylist was out of town till Tuesday)

Incidentally i was in the main Chinatown plaza (for the haircut) and decided to come here for lunch. I got lucky and found parking like right in front of the restaurant (everyone knows parking sucks in this complex). After i went into the restaurant, all the side tables were occupied. The waiter asked if I would be willing to sit in the big table in the middle with others, and i was fine with that. 

Fastest lunch ever. I was in and out of the restaurant in like 15 - 20 minutes. This was about 0100PM on a Monday afternoon. I was sat at my seat, given the menu, gave my order of the Piquant Intestine Noodle with extra noodle, got my food, ate, and gone. 

Like the menu picture shows, the Piquant Intestine Noodle gives you some bak choy, piquant intestine, and noodles. Very simple but flavorful noodle soup. Not sure what piquant intestine means but from my experience in eating intestines, it was like, mini large intestines. I had wished they had used normal sized large intestines as they are much \"meatier\". The soup base at a \"normal spiciness\" is pretty decent. Had a good amount of \"ma\" and \"la\" which is the numb and spicy aspects of chongqing/sichuan cuisine but was not overpowering so i was able to eat my noodles fast. Price wise, it was great. I think my bowl of noodles were $8.99. With a free 100g side of extra noodles, it was a good amount of food for my hungry self, since i haven't really ate since 0630AM that morning. Not sure if it was because i was able to eat much faster than i did last time (not status post night of drinking and dehydration), the noodles didn't really soak up the soup as much as it did last time. 

Service was quick. Unfortunately they didn't refill my cup of mung bean soup. Since the \"visit\" was so fast, it didn't really bother me too much. 

Would like to come back to try other noodles like the spare rib noodles, special gizzard noodles."}
{"text":"We've been here twice and their noodles r great! I especially like their free mung bean soup."}
{"text":"Location and ambiance 2/5
Staff 4/5
Food 3/5
Likeliness to return 2/5
Likeliness to recommend 1/5

Location and ambiance:
Located in a busy plaza on Sp.Mt. that typically already have huge issues with parking.
- the restaurant is very half assed and unfinished.  I understand they removed all the booths/ decor from the previous tenant. But they didn't bother covering up any holes or patch up the walls with new paint. There's several hanging lights missing. Personally to me.. if a restaurant is new, I expect it to look like the previous tenant cuz it's reusable or something new and turn key.  I don't wanna dine in a place that looks like someone just moved out.

Staff:
Staff is friendly and nice.  We were greeted promptly and water and comp appetizers arrived right away after we sat down.  My only complaint is the staff is constantly on their cell phone. They are super nice and polite when you get their attention but they're not very attentive on their own.

Food:
We ordered the steamed egg with minced meat.  Came out super fast.  A little too salty for me but my husband thought it was good.  
Then he ordered the first thing on the menu, pig intestines noodle.  All we tasted was the heavy peppercorn and no other depth of flavor coming through.  My husband had to ask for soysauce and vinegar to tweak it.  I ordered the Hot and Sour Noodle which was tasty and I loved the thin homemade noodle texture. Doesn't blow my mind, but it was a good choice.

Likeliness to return:
For what it is, we're probably not going to return.  So far there isn't a flavor that I crave.  However, it's not terrible so should any friends wanna dine here we wouldn't refuse.

Likeliness to Recommend:
Less likely."}
{"text":"The environment is nice and clean; variety kinds of Sichuan noodles. Look forward to come next time."}
{"text":"Good bowl of spicy noodles but I wish it had more of the citrus-y numbing spiciness from Sichuan peppers. The spicy oil wontons are always a hit, same as the ones from their sister restaurant, Chengdu Taste.  BTW if you're expecting zhajiang mian like the kind from Beijing, this is NOT it.  This is more akin to dan dan noodles, only spicier."}
{"text":"It was ok. I was expecting better based on the reviews. Had the cold noodles. Good for the price."}
{"text":"Fantastic noodles!! I love getting the vegetarian noodles without egg (makes it vegan). As far as my boyfriend who is Chinese can tell from a few inquires to the staff, the vegetarian contains no seafood or meat broth and the noodles are Vegan. The steamed veggies are super yummy, and I love the unlimited mung bean drink (served cold)."}
{"text":"Easily my favorite noodle place in Las Vegas. If you can handle spicy, the noodle soup broth is top notch, cooked with real beef, not just flavored broth. The noodles are also very good, and they will give you extra noodles for just about any dish free of charge. To top it all off, they serve a wonderful mung bean soup as a beverage that cools the tongue from the intense Sizchuan spice. Trust me though, I'm no slouch when it comes to spice, but the \"less spicy\" option was still VERY powerful (almost left my mouth numb). Only opt for the true spicy options if you are are a Sizchuan native or a literal masochist. 
If all that wasn't praise enough, their wait staff is great. Truly nice people, even brought our table a free dessert just because he \"liked my mom\". 5 out of 5 stars, could not recommend more for lovers of spicy food."}
{"text":"Wow! Haven't had amazing beef noodles like this in a LONG time. The noodles were perfect (not soggy). I prefer my noodles to have a little bounce to them. The beef soup had exceed all expectations. The soup was flavorful and the beef was tender. My mom ordered the Ma-Lat noodles.. and boy does this dish live up to its name. First sips had my entire lips numb and tingly. Apparently the Szechuan pepper do that to you. The soup base on both dish was on point. Can't wait to come back!

We also ordered 2 appetizers. The radish was just okay for me, although my mom loved them. Some of the radish were too hard to chew. The fungus, on the other hand, was the best fungus dish I've ever had in my entire life. I'm a huge fan of vinegar - and this dish had the perfect combination of sour and sweet similar to pickled fungus. 

For desert, we ordered 2 of the sweet jelly. This was definitely not something I've ever had before. If you like nuts - I definitely recommend this. Otherwise, if you're not a peanut lover like me, don't order this. 

Ohhhh and how can I forget the kung bean soup!?? This restaurant serves kung bean soup for your drink! No need to order water -- as this soup will help cool your mouth from the burning sensation from the spicy noodles! The mung bean soup has a hint of sweetness to it, and the fact that mung beans are good for you - make this place a top contender for me for favorite noodle restaurant in Las Vegas! 

The restaurant is small but very comfortable. No wait for a Sunday afternoon."}
{"text":"First time here was very nice noodles place. If your looking for something spicy and asian noodle this is a great place parking is easy to find and as well the services is quick and nice. Price is good overall 20 per person."}
{"text":"The noodle very spicy, good and the service is fast, i like the greenbean drink and it's free"}
{"text":"Very authentic noodles.  Most dishes are spicy as it's Sichuan style.  The cold dishes are excellent,  especially the black fungus.  Parking is very tight."}
{"text":"Tried this place out last night because my girlfriend wanted to try sichuan style noodles.

Service was really good, they had us seated quickly, took our orders, was friendly about refilling out water, and checked in with us, no complaints.

Food-wise, I got the beef noodle soup. I will warn people who aren't used to this to be careful. I can typically handle spicy, but the spicy oil soup is VERY rich and saturated. The noodles and beef were really good, but the soup was a bit much for me personally. I'm sure other people who love really spicy chili oil or this type of food would love it, it's just not my style.

Price was decent, I think our bowls were about $9-10 each which wasn't overpriced or a great value, just in the middle. I will say the amount we got was good, no complaints.

I don't usually eat this style of food, it was my first time. I probably wouldn't go back, but if you like his style of food, this seems like a decent restaurant to go to."}
{"text":"First  time here, Got a beef pickled noodles. It was really good with a traditional Szechuan spicy to you lips. Also serving with the mug bean soup that will help you out if you got too spicy. Really good food and customer service!"}
{"text":"Tried once in LA. Now again in Vegas. The best noodle place in Vegas. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place is authentic, I bit into one of their peppercorns and it was very numbing. I have some Sichuan peppercorns at home but they don't come close to being this flavorful. I had the noodles with the beef but the beef pieces were on the tough side. My friend ordered her meat on a separate plate but they ended up putting it in her bowl of soup. I felt bad for her because she is a vegetarian, so I helped her take out all the small pieces of ground meat."}
{"text":"Upon opening the door to this little shop, the amazing aromas immediate make you even more hungry. They start the meal by giving you a mung bean \"soup\" which is actually just a drink, but it is used to cool your mouth down after eating their spicy noodles! I ordered the spare ribs noodles and their noodles are handmade. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Another good Vegas chinese noodle joint (there are a ton here!) Great side dishes and solid noodles, although I don't like the spicy Sichuan style noodle soups as much as the standard style. Avoid if you don't like spicy, since that's the main draw to this place.

Short Rib Noodle Soup - 4/5. The noodles stuck together a bit too much, but were decent. The meat was very tender and delicious (what's with Vegas noodle places having great meat? the meat in San Francisco Chinese noodle places are generally terrible). Wasn't able to drink the soup since it was super spicy, but I guess it's to be expected from this style of noodles.

Pig Head - 5/5. Best version of this I've had in a while. Just chewy enough without being too tough, and well seasoned. 

Steamed Egg - 4/5. Standard steamed egg with some sauteed shredded pork thrown on top. The pork was a nice touch bumping this up by a bit, since the sauce paired well with the unseasoned egg.

Seaweed - 3/5. Mostly standard, though well seasoned. 

Mung Bean Soup - 4/5. Perfect for cooling down after all of the spice. I must have drank 5 cups of this stuff while I was here..."}
{"text":"I tried this place in LA, that is amazing taste! We all love it! Just found in Vegas! Same one! U must try it! Everything just great! They have special desert u must try! So exiting Las Vegas has Mian!"}
{"text":"This place is different, wouldn't try it weekly but monthly perhaps since hubby want to try different type of noodles
Came here on Sun right when they open and we were their first customers so parking was also easy . Got the free drink called mun beans soup. Ordered rib noodles which they stated ran out since last night and won't be available til 2 hrs from now the earliest. We ended up getting beef, intestines noodles along with the dumplings and fungus dish
Their hot spice was different. Can't really feel the hot from spice but you can feel you get hot from inside out and it make my nose runs . I also notice my mouth feel slightly numbed after drinking the cold munbeans drink
Noodle soft chewy, meat & intestines was tender, dumplings dish sweet and spicy , need to share the dumplings since the sauce soak in chili oil , more sweet then spicy and I feel it would be sickening for one person trying to eat all that dumplings by self"}
{"text":"Yeah! Finally an authentic, well designed restaurant that showcases different styles of ramen (soup noodles) of China. 

Flavors are on point. Their house drink is the chilled green bean soup. It's a desserty drink, a stable in China like boba tea. I used to drink it all the time back home during the long summer breaks. I was so surprised and excited to discover it when I first came to the restaurant. The waitress was kind enough to make me a to-go drink of it. Lol. 

The fried egg is Chinese style with edges of the egg (and usually bottom) super charred. Damn, everything in the bowl reminds me of back home. Must try."}
{"text":"Came here late one night after work because my sister wanted to try this place. The place was very nice and clean, bright lights, I like that the tables are sectioned off which gives you a little privacy. 

I really liked the mungbean \"soup\" that they served instead of water, it supposedly helps cool your body. The soup was served cold, not too sweet, very refreshing. 

My sister wanted to try the intestine noodle which they said were sold out, then she wanted the short rib noodle which was also sold out. So she decided on beef noodle which she really enjoyed. Said noodle was chewy and tasted fresh, broth was flavorful. I was not in the mood for spicy food so I got the wontons which I really liked. The soup was plain, not bland, plain...which tasted very healthy, perfect for late meal. The wontons were flavorful so I thought the overall dish was great, the plain broth complimented the flavorful wonton. I would definitely come back for more and to try other dishes. 

Cons:
- They did not have the two dishes that my sister came to try (I personally feel that when you are new you want to be on point and have your most interesting items in stock all the time so everyone who comes in can try your best items)
- The menu was wrong all over the place, they have the same description for different dishes which is misleading when it is your first time there and is trying to know the menu
- Service was also not the best, I did not come here expecting excellent service but we waited a long time and had to flag someone down to get the check

Overall, really good food, service needs improvement. Maybe you should come early if you want to try their popular items."}
{"text":"Would have given these place a four stars but sadly three star today. 

We got there before they open in ten minutes, we waited in car until they open and look at menu from the yelp app. Within minutes the sign was flip to open and doors were unlocked, we headed in to be seated. At first, I thought it was nice and since my friend suggested about this place, why not give it a try. 

Overlooking the menu, I decided to get the house beef noodles soup and cold noodles(I don't remember the name exactly but it was cold and spicy). They also served mung bean soup (which is similar to the Vietnamese ché do san) everything was great, the place paper has drawing and side notes on how to eat the noodles. Until my friend pointed out on their whiteboard about getting a free appetizer if you follow and comment on their yelp page. Which I already done checking in but thought it was nice of them to offer free appetizer, so here we are looking at the menu under the section; trying to figure which ones until the server came by and we asked him about it. He pointed out these small black dish in the middle of our table. Not sure if it's picked cabbage or vinegar. Our faces were blank and just arched our brow. Okay?? 

We just order our food, my order was house beef noodles and cold noodles. It was good. Spicy and the broth was flavorful. Will I ever go back??? I don't know. Maybe. Maybe not. They do have one in Los Angeles so I might go try them out and see. But about the appetizer, I think they need to be a more specific on it so guests don't get confuse."}
{"text":"Appetizers: 
- sliced spicy beef: it was alright. It was indeed spicy but it was too dry for me
- Steamed egg with minced pork: this was my favorite one! Egg was smooth and the minced pork had a nice subtle sweet flavor to it. 
- spicy back fungus: this one was alright also. It was spicy but they also put too much vinegar in it and that overpowered the spiciness. 

Noodles:
- Spare rib soup and Spicy house beef soup: both soup had the same broth (at least they tasted the same to me).  The soup itself was okay. It had a layer of chili oil on the top which is expected in Szechuan cooking. I wasn't a big fan of the meat in each dish. Both the spare ribs and chunks of beef felt rough.

Overall, I most likely won't come back. It wasn't enough to wow me and plus, it's kinda far."}
{"text":"Super delicious and very authentic chengdu style noodle. If u can eat spicy u have to come here. I've been LA's location before and I'm so glad have this store open in Vegas. Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"As a guy stayed at Chengdu for more than five years, I definitely recommend this place. They are pretty professional and will not let you regret ur choice. I like here."}
{"text":"Literally the Best noodle house in LV best service,best food with clean and bright environment! My favorite dishes are large intestine noodle and chicken gizzard noodle, it's not too spicy and i love the fact that they offer us the green bean soup as the drink, it really matches the spicy noodle. For people who want a larger portion, they actually offers extra noodle for free. I already visit this place 3 times this week lol, definitely will come back soon!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Chengdu Zajiang with medium spiciness and found these to be the hottest noodles I've ever attempted to eat.  I saw a thick layer of hot chili oil floating on top and became a bit concerned about the calories since so much oil is not good for my weight loss efforts. The noodles had a fine hand-pulled quality like I recall from my trip to China. They were great noodles!

Unfortunately there was no way to cool down the noodle soup once ordered too spicy. My fault. They will generously provide more noodles if you wish and we were offered a cold mung bean drink which was delicious and refreshing. Service was genuinely nice and the place was clean and simple with a modern touch."}
{"text":"The food is very delicious?and all the food matieral is fresh. The side dishes are tasky. They come with a larger amount than their counterparts in LA. We like it???"}
{"text":"Very authentic and delicious noodles! Highly recommend!     The best chongqing noodle restaurant i have been in USA. The noodle dishes we had  are tasty and have bold flavor.   We tried 3 different noodle dishes and all very good. Their noodle fish size is big and good size."}

the beef is amazine here
for sure will come back again soon"}
{"text":"I went here on a really cold day so it was perfect. Although I was unaware I walked into get rekt. Beef noodle soup has a close place to my heart and it's one of the best I've had to be honest. My family and all ordered the beef noodle soup with all various spice levels from baby spice, to liu kang bicycle kicking you in the throat. They also serve a mung bean \"soup\" to accompany the delicious fire water that we were about to eat. Sichuan peppercorns really numb you up. They probably lowkey use it when you're at the dentist probably. While that sensation is going on, the noodles were good, and so was he broth. I highly recommend the sweet savory dumplings. Whatever sauce they had I would get lost in the sauce real quick.  Overall I was dying and I felt like I could breathe fire.


gg no re"}
{"text":"I was craving noodles and this spot popped up under Hot n New so I decided to check this place out with a couple of friends. I know that Szechuan restaurants tend to mainly have spicy dishes, so I enjoyed the fact that u can order mild to medium spicy level here. 
They start out by giving everyone this drink which is Mung Bean Soup. According to the menu, when you eat something really spicy....this drink will help tame your taste buds....it really works and is refreshing (better than water, and Ill tell you why later).  Our table ordered Spicy Black Fungus- great appitizer/side dish.
Spicy Radish- too hard, difficult to chew.
Chengdu Zajiang Noodles- dry noodles with egg and minced pork
Intestine Noodle Soup-different kinda flavor goin on here.
Steamed Egg with minced pork on side- delish and good amount for price.
Hot and Sour ChaoShou- broth was soo good!
Side of Spare Ribs- ehh plain.
As you know szechuan dishes are packed with flavor and spices and a little oily. As I am eating....Im thinking to myself my tongue feels weird. I told my friends that my tongue feels weird...maybe its oily.....oh wait it feels numb. For a second I thought I was allergic to something, but then my other friend said he felt the same thing hahahahah. I drank some water but that tasted weird as hell. I was like....why does the water taste funny. My other friend said their water tasted bomb. Then my other friend told me that sometimes szechuan food sometimes makes your tongue feel numb from all the spices. OHHH makes sense now! Here is when the Mung Bean Soup comes into play. I kept drinking that and it tasted pretty good to me since my taste buds were all outta wack. It tasted better than water! So thats my experience here. I dont know if I would purposely come back, but Im glad I got to try this place out. Staff is friendly, food comes out quick after ordering. Its located next to Tea Station. Parking can be difficult to find esp for dinner time or weekends."}
{"text":"Are you ready for that spicy, tingly, feeling on your lips and taste buds? Time for some authentic Sichuan (or Szechuan) cuisine! Here at Mian you're first served some mung bean soup as a drink to help cool your tongue as you prepare for your spicy dish. It's a subtly sweet, refreshing beverage w/ small mung beans (think similarly to boba).

Their menu is 90% spicy dishes, so if you're not into spicy food, this may not be the place for you. I ordered the House Beef Noodle Soup ($9.99). Don't forget to read their placemat on how to eat their dishes - it'll give you the best experience when grubbing down. The noodles were nice and firm, al dente, and the broth was spicy and had those special Sichuan peppers that made your lips and tongue tingle. I couldn't help but smile and feel the endorphins from the capsaicin rush. However, their beef was overcooked and tough to chew on. It took away from the experience and I preferred not to eat it, even though I did because I don't like wasting food.

I'd definitely come back here and try their other dishes. It's another great place for a culinary adventure.

Tips:

* If you easily get heartburn or flaming hot @$$, don't eat here. It's mostly spicy food.

* If you don't want to eat spicy food, they do have 2 bone broth dishes.

* When eating any spicy noodle soup, make sure to stir the noodles all the way to the bottom of the bowl when serving yourself each time. It ensures absorption and capturing of the Sichuan peppers in between the noodles for each bite.

* Remember you're in Chinatown. You're not gonna get Guy Savoy service here."}
{"text":"The taste is very authentic. The spiciness or the numbness that you get is no joke. Be humble if you've never tried actual Szechuan spicy dish and think you can handle spiciness. It's not the same thing. Both our orders are good to taste except the beef is a little dry. Other than that the noodle is very nice and just the right chewyness. I will definitely come back to try more other types of dishes."}
{"text":"New noodle place finally getting to try...tomato beef noodle, beef noodle, and intestine noodles...pictures to come"}
{"text":"The newest noodle house in town. 
The noodle taste good and the sechuan sauce is bomb!!! Also they have you complimentary mung bean soup. 
I loved wonton and always order wherever I go and this place has a delicious one! I also tried their pork intestine. It's very delicious. 
Try their house special beef noodle soup, the soup really tasty. 
That's all about food. Thumb up!

Service wise is thumb down. 
My 2 Friend's n I went there, the restaurant wasn't  look busy. They had 3 servers. We had to wait for about 10 minutes before they sat us. 
After we sat, they brought us mung bean soup right away and the menu. No talking, nothing! It will be nice if they greet us like hi, how are you. Then offer us some water. It just not at all. It's seems like they didn't speak English. 

Overall, i will come back just for the wonton and probably taking it to go. I won't be expecting for service."}
{"text":"My favorite noodle place to go when I am craving for some Sichuan noodles. I come from Sichuan, and I have to say that their noodle is very authentic that reminds me the time in Sichuan. Staffs are friendly. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. Environment is great. Great choices for food and they all look delicious. Will be coming back to try different noodles."}
{"text":"Awesome noodles found in Las Vegas??Must try stop here?Serve with free green bean soup?Pretty nice?"}
{"text":"Haven't been so satisfied from noodles for such a long time. 

Prices: prices are pretty decent over here, almost everything around $10. The appetizers are pretty affordable like $2 each.

Service: As soon as I walked in, the waitress greeted me and guided me to the seats. Instead of serving water, they serve green beans soup, it's free and refillable! They refill my cup for at least three times, very nice service.

Environment: the tables and chairs are made of wood, lots of customers notes hanging on the wall. It's a chill and casual dining place.

Food: I love the noodle that I ordered, which was special gizzard noodles, the gizzard doesn't gave me lots of surprises, but the noodle was bomb. The seasoning and the sauces were awesome. I only had little bit left over after I'm done eating, and I'm still taking it home.

Overall: No doubt that this place would be my first choice if I'm craving for Chinese noodle. Fair price and nice service."}
{"text":"Great value, tasty food. 
We came in a large group so sampled almost the entire menu. 
Highlights from \"app\" section are fungus (wood ear mushroom) fresh chili and vinegar. Radish fermented like an ultra crunchy kimchi.  Egg custard with beef (similar to a chawanmushi)
All the dumplings are good, I like the pork in chili oil varietals but the savory broth versions are great as well, portions are very large. 
Entree highlights were cold Szechuan noodle, bone broth soup with noodle and pickled beef noodle. 
If it was more expensive it would be three stars as in the large scheme of Szechuan flavors it was mild and one dimensional. But value for the cost is good and the service team was kind and attentive. (Also msg usage was mild)."}
{"text":"Ordered hot and sour noodle with an extra egg. Pretty good. Medium spice level was just right. Enough to get my nose sniffing a bit but not enough to cause pain on the tongue."}
{"text":"Food  are very good service is good too I just don't like too spicy or greasy myself reasonable price trendy"}
{"text":"Was recommended by a Vegas local foodie. 
We ordered way too much and all agreed that the food was delicious. Our top 3 must gets are:
1. Steamed egg and minced pork 
2. Chili oil chaoshou
3. Chengdu zajiang noodle
The cold mung bean beverage is key to cooling off your tongue. 
Can't wait to try the SGV location in LA."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch based on a friend's recommendation. The restaurant is very clean and open. The menu is easy to follow and explains all the food options well. The placemat is helpful in explaining the noodles and mung bean soup. The steam egg appetizer was so good. The egg was really smooth and the flavors balanced each other perfectly. All the noodle soups and dishes had good flavor and the noodles were perfectly chewy. The dumplings were also really good. Service was good, fast and attentive. Parking was easy because there is a lot."}
{"text":"This place was so delicious that I am going to go back for seconds before I leave Vegas and head back home. I had the spicy soup and a spicy wontons or dumplings."}
{"text":"Best Szechuan noodle in Las Vegas. I ate before at LA. They also best in LA. They same taste in LA. They have spicy and not spicy, you can choose what you like."}
{"text":"It is  so delicious    I really  like it   And. Serves was good.   The place   So clean      Feel  comfortable.      Like  it. The Best  noodle  in vegas"}
{"text":"We came to this spot after our Thai Chi class... Starving children... We ordered around 7 PM I wanted the beef noodles but they ran out of beef so that made me very sad... I instead ordered the rib noodles spicy with black mushrooms and tomatoes the food was a little too spicy for me but could they also serve you with this soup that's supposed to cleanse your pallet as you eat your regular course it is made out of sweet bean water and sugar ...the food came out within 5 minutes not long at all ... we also ordered the dumplings which had a little too much of that soy oil stuff so was hard to grab with chopsticks but once you did oh my !!! The meat inside is just great !!! 
Dress :very casual I went in sports wear"}
{"text":"I love this spot and I definitely suggest you come with friends so you can order lots of dishes and share.

Why 5 stars? Because they deliver exactly what they promote. Are they fine dining? No. Are they incredibly fresh perfectly cooked noodles with my favorite Sichuan spices and flavors? Yes.

If you want to go and everyone else is busy get the Cold Sichuan noodles and the side of egg in a cup that is only $1.50 and is an omelette covered in tasty ground beef.

Will add pics when I figure out how to from computer. Does anyone know how to add photos from computer and not from phone?

P.S. Go upstairs after and grab some thin almond cookies from the bakery. So good!"}
{"text":"????????????????? ????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????It's so amazing and delicious"}
{"text":"I was looking for authentic noodles and boy did I find them! Spicy spicy spicy! Definitely prepare to drink up the mung bean soup/drink they offer cuz it's the only way to tame it down! My friend was not a fan of her dishes but I definitely knew what I was getting into and enjoyed. I would say a bit of salt was needed to go with all that spice , but overall very good!"}
{"text":"MSG, thirsty all afternoon and evening. The noodle texture was really disappointing. Service, however, was superb!"}
{"text":"Best restaurant around
We've been trying to find a place to eat on the Strip, but there're way to expensive and not authentic

This place tho, nice and clean environment
Friendly staffs and the best part is the food
We ordered one soup and one dry noodle
Both are authentic in taste!!
Especially the bean soup that served to you as soon as you walked in. It goes very well with the meal

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The food is good. Spice level were perfect. I like the side pickle dishes. Intestine and short ribs noodle were delicious! I only hate the service of the waitress. Never smile since the moments approaching our table and my friend doesn't know what's chicken gizzard so he simply ask what it is. She showed an annoyed look without any explanation. \"It's gizzard!\" That all we got. So I have to actually google what it is. But though out the whole meal only the waiters were actually check on our table and accommodated our needs."}
{"text":"I just want to say that everything is very good!
I want more people to know 
Pork Dumpling with chili: Yum.
My friends tell me to try the Beef noodle:also Yum"}
{"text":"Most tasty noodle I had in US. So delicious! And it's inexpensive, will come back again!"}
{"text":"100% Authentic Sichuan Noodles - taste wise and selection wise.  Server welcomed us with green bean soup which helps cool off the heat and hydrate us after a long drive.  Free to add 100g of noodles for the ones with big appetite. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Good food. Sleepy and thirsty afterwards due to possible MSG. But tasty nonetheless. Service didn't need to be Michelin star-like but more friendly would be appreciated. There weren't anyone else in the place so a smile could've been possible."}
{"text":"We ordered chongqing beef noodle and chicken noodle, both are great! We are from Sichuan, very glad to have authentic Sichuan noodles here! I will give 5 stars for food. Expect 15 mins for seating during lunch time. Clean dinning environment.

We also ordered spicy dumplings, recommend if you like dumplings!"}
{"text":"We got here around 230pm not knowing they were close at 3pm for a short lunch break, it was my mistake I was stressing to make sure I eat faster and not have the servers wait after closing time, but the servers didn't make me feel any bit of need to rush. 

Server was friendly answered all our questions, and the food came out quickly. The two of we tried the spicy wonton, spicy radish , steam egg thing with mince pork? the steam veggies, and the spare ribs noodle soup.

The spicy radish was very flavorful picked with Sichuan pepper numbing to taste! Good experience if you never tried numbing pepper before!
The steam egg with was very very salty though.

I usually love noodle soup, but the spare rib noodle soup was good, but not the best I have had. The noodle itself was very fresh, the soup based was not so impressive. My friend enjoyed the spicy wonton a lot! Must try, the flavor of that was very good"}
{"text":"Glad to have that noddle shop in Vegas. I dun need to go to LA :)

I do like special gizzard noodles."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Sichuan food, so I don't have anything to compare it to. I think a lot of people are going to try to compare these noodles to ramen, but these dishes have some distinct qualities I've never experienced before. 

We came in on a Friday night and there were only 2-3 other tables occupied. The clientele is mostly all Chinese so you know they're doing something right. As soon as we were seated the waitress brought us mung bean soup and pickled vegetables. The mung bean soup is used to cool off your mouth after eating the spicy foods. It tastes like iced tea but has beans in the bottom of it that sort of resemble split pea soup. It does work to cool you off so use it. No one is drinking water here. 

To start we ordered the steamed egg with minced pork which is seriously amazing. The pork is oily and savory while the egg is light and creamy. Definitely suggest getting this dish. After that we both ordered the house beef noodle. The dish itself is just gorgeous: a mix of white noodles, green vegetables and red soup.The noodles are less springy than ramen noodles, but taste fresh and almost floury. It filled me up a lot quicker because they were more dense. The broth is light but intense with flavor and heat. We usually go for super spicy ramen but we did a \"regular spicy\" here and I'm glad we did. The thing that I was not expecting was the tingling that happens in your whole mouth after eating the food. It's not like your mouth becomes numb from the heat, it's that the Sichuan peppers actually cause a tingling sensation. Drink mung bean soup to alleviate some of the tingling. The meat in the dish was very tender but a little fatty at times. I think this is a great intro dish. Next time I'd love to try some of the noodle dishes without soup. Overall I'm glad we tried Mian out. It's always exciting having new food experiences like this and I recommend to anyone who likes ramen and wants something more adventurous."}
{"text":"This was a tasty and authentic dinner. I had the intestine soup. It was spicy but not overpowering, and the intestine was tender.  Left a nice szechuan pepper buzz, and they offered free sweet bean tea to tone down the spice. Dumplings sauce were tasty as well. Good value for the price and a solid off strip option"}
{"text":"Update: I've been there twice since and everything has been too salty or different. The wood ear mushrooms/ fungus was extremely salty and not sour at all. The first time back I got the pickled beef noodle soup which is one of my favorites. I usually get medium spice but this time I got small spice and it was spicier than a medium. Then the second time back I got the beef noodle soup which was too salty. I'll still be going back. Hopefully they fix everything soon."}
{"text":"Very good atmosphere, clean and nice.  I like this place.  

This place is for Chinese noodle lovers'.  Only noodles!

Food taste excellent, and are cooked with high quality noodle.  I would go back.  

Only one small downside: 
I would suggest to set air conditioning temperature lower!  I went in on a hot summer day... 108!  Eating spicy food and drinking hot soup doesn't help to cool me down.   ;-)"}
{"text":"Food quality 5 stars. Nice people working there. Not really an atmosphere, and I think they could work on that. Regardless, will go back often."}
{"text":"Good food great service.  Love those noodle bowls and various appetizers.  If you like sichuan food this is a great place close to Chinese and Asian  restaurants"}
{"text":"OMG, this place is wonderful. I loved everything we tried from the spicy radishes, pickled cabbage, beef noodle soup, mung bean soup and iced jelly desert.  My partner had a tomato based noodle soup with a fried egg and sliced fresh tomatoes in it. He said it was excellent. I thought the service was outstanding. They offer various levels of spiciness which was a good thing. I think medium is hot enough for most people.  This is my first experience eating authentic Sichuan dishes.  We will be back.  I highly recommend Mian."}
{"text":"I love this place! I was yelping on what to eat while in Vegas and this place popped up. I ordered the Chili Oil Chashou Spicy Wontons and House of Beef Noodles. These spicy wontons are better than the ones at Ding Tai Fung. So much flavor in the sauce! The noodles I had were plentiful and delicious too. The beef in noodles were so tender. 

I would visit this place again in Vegas and I'll even drive to the location in Los Angeles if I ever crave for Szechuan cuisine!"}
{"text":"Must try! Their mung bean water is something to look forward too when coming here. Definitely recommend if you love spicy flavorful chinese noodles!"}
{"text":"Really recommend this store. I like dumpling and appetizer beef! The gift for the green bean soup is pretty cool!"}
{"text":"My wife and I ordered the house beef noodle and beef pickled noodle to share with each other.  Our waiter was quick to point out that their dishes was on the  spicier side.  I went with a lighter spice level on the house beef noodle, which ended up perfect for me.  The dark beef broth was saltier and less sweet than some of other beef noodle soups that I've had.  Very flavorful.

The beef pickled noodle had a distinctively different broth.  Light in color, but heavily seasoned with numbing spice (peppercorn), which the waiter did warn us about.   And he wasn't kidding! Both my wife and I couldn't feel our mouths after a few bites.  The broth flavor was good, but we probably would've enjoyed it more if it had less peppercorn.

Overall the food was good and we appreciate our waiter for being upfront about the food.  Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I think this place has the best chinese noodle in town. Their menu is simple, but has enough choices. The menu has a picture for each dish, which helps you in deciding what to order. The prices are also very reasonable. Less than $10 for a noodle dish.

For my first visit, I tried their chengdu style zhajiang noodle with a side order of chicken gizzard. The noodle was cooked perfectly; not too soft, not too chewy. I asked for regular spicy level and found that it had a slight amount of heat, which kept building as I ate more. However, it wasn't too spicy, where it would make it hard for you to eat. I've had sichuan style food that's way spicier where it literally numbed your tongue and made you sweat like crazy. The noodle dish from this place didn't do that to me, so if you like super spicy food, the regular heat level might not satisfy you, so ask for extra spicy. The chicken gizzard was tasty (though it was not a chicken gizzard only, but is rather a chicken giblet) and was actually spicier than the noodle.

They gave you plenty of food and I was struggling to finish my bowl, but if you do need more food, you can ask for extra noodle for free. For drinks, they gave us sweet mung bean soup, which helped cool off the heat and which they would refill.

The only downside is this restaurant is located in the same small plaza, where tea station and ichiza are, so parking can be a challenge during busy time. However, you can always park at the bigger chinatown plaza next door and walk over."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this more.  I really enjoyed their thin noodles in hot and sour soup, as well as their wontons.  Ther jia jia mien noodles were disappointing.  The sauce was great, but the noodles were either a different story.   Either the noodles were overcooked, cooked in a pot with too much starch, or needed to be rinsed, because the noodles ended up with this gummy consistency.  If they fixed that, I would elevate to 4 or 5 stars.

Their mung bean soup/tea was quite good though.  That part itself is worth trying."}
{"text":"I think Mian is great! The restaurant isn't that big and it's in one of the shopping plazas with inadequate parking spots, but the food is tasty and affordable.

The menu isn't big, but offers several noodle dishes (mian means noodle), almost all of which are less than $10. You also get served complimentary pickled cabbage and complimentary refillable green bean soup (I LOVE green bean soup). To top it off, they also provide FREE unlimited noodle refills.

The noodle dishes are all very authentic and tasty. The noodles themselves are fresh and chewy as well. Service is decent. Decor is quaint, especially with all of the comment cards hung up.

All in all, between the taste, freebies, and value for price, I highly recommend Mian for a quick and inexpensive yet delicious meal."}
{"text":"I was craving really spicy food so I decided to try this place out. I ordered the Chengdu Zajiang, I am assuming it is similar to Dan Dan noodles (at Shang) since there is no soup. 

I was told that their spicy here was really spicy so I opted for medium heat. I was disappointed that my order was taken wrong and when my noodles came out I could taste no heat at all. So I asked for a side of the chili and peppers and added a good amount to my dish. The flavors were way better with the spice. Since the noodles were not cooked with the spices it was not as spicy as it should have been. 

We weren't given the option to have the mung bean soup, but then again we didn't ask for it. I'm not sure if it automatically comes with your meal or it is available upon request. I still enjoyed my meal even though it was wrong. I am looking forward to having this place again and my dish be made correctly lol."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out with a friend because we were feeling extra adventurous and figured this would be an awesome place to explore! Y'all are probably wondering why would a person who cannot eat spicy food come here and all I gotta say is #YOLO.

I ordered the chengdu zajiang dish which was pretty tasty and is a chef's choice! The noodles had a good amount of chew factor and the broth in the dish added plenty of flavor. They could have given a bit more meat and veggies with the dish, but overall it was a good dish. Eating it kind of reminded me of spaghetti with ground beef...just without the marinara sauce.

Another cool thing about this place is that you get this mung bean drink that is really refreshing, cool, and has a hint of sweetness to it. This is meant to help you cool down from the spicy dishes, but it is pretty good even if you don't eat spicy food like me.


Overall I would recommend checking this place out if you love spicy noodle dishes! Even I was able to enjoy this place and would probably come back one day just to see if I can handle eating one of their spicy dishes haha."}
{"text":"Definitely tasting Chinese cuisine. I would recommend the special gizzard noodle. The steam egg really good."}
{"text":"Service was great, food was delicious, free cold mung bean soup...loved it!

We arrived on a Saturday afternoon and we ordered the following:
1. egg custard and minced pork - must eat the custard with the minced pork for a balanced flavor.  We ordered a side order of plain noodles and mixed this appetizer with the noodles for our toddler and she loved it.  
2. noodle soup with intestine - the noodle was al dente, the soup was numbingly spicy and flavorful, and the intestine was tender.  I would order this again.
3. dry noodle with minced pork and fried egg - was spicy but quite delicious as well.
4. side of radish - spicy and good to have with the dry noodle.

The cold mung bean soup was a lifesaver..as you can see above, majority of the dishes are made with the Sichuan pepper, that spicy that tingles your tongue.  I am surprised as how much flavor is in the food since one would think the spiciness would overwhelm the dish...but NOPE!

I had the rest of my noodle soup with intestine tonight and here I am, writing this review, and already planning on lunching here with my team tomorrow."}
{"text":"Mian Noodle is a unique Sichuan noodle place. The combination of the signature chili's and peppers sets the food apart. They also make their fantastic noodles in house. Mian Noodle is a hidden gem in Las Vegas. The LA location is well known because Johnathan Gold put it in his top 101 restaurants in LA."}
{"text":"Really appreciate the mung bean drink. The noodles taste great too! I ordered the tomato and egg noodle with added beef. Glad they had spicy and nonspicy options."}
{"text":"New noodle shop located where Yagyu Ramen used to be. They have another location in San Gabriel, California. 

FOOD: Menu is not very ingredient specific. It only tells you 3 out of the 6 ingredients so beware if you're vegetating. Presentation is also poor, mine looked as if it had already been stirred for me. 

Hauxing Fried Egg Noodles was served with thin noodles which I enjoyed and seemed to be vegetarian but because it was not marked I'll assume the broth was a meat broth. It was tasty and had almost a tomato soup style broth with a fried egg on top, tomato chunks and green onion. I don't know that I would this one again as I prefer clear broths but it was definitely tasty! 

Chili Oil Chaoshou is a none soup dish. Just steamed dumpling sitting in a yummy bath of spicy chili oil was fantastic, although I wish the menu said what type of meat it was because I have no idea what I ate now. Otherwise the tastes were fantastic and was not over steamed. 

ATMOSPHERE: Very plain inside, there is nothing on the bare white walls. There is one little tv in the wall turned off that looks to be the same one as the previous tenant. The only other decorations are two of their soup cups by the restaurant entry. It also looks as if there is the same brown wood furniture as the previous tenant. 


STAFF AND SERVICE: Very friendly staff however not a very good flow of who handles customers walking in and those dining. We were approached by someone from the register and given menus while we stood at the door along with 4 other people waiting to dine. Upon entry there is a clip board with lines on it hanging so you can write in your party name and how many dining. Once seated they brought soup and water out immediately after being seated and the food came out very quickly which was great for the lunch hour. I definitely could have waited an additional minute if it made the appearance of my dish better though. There's no fun instagraming it as their place mat suggests if it's a messy bowl of food. 

Overall I'll go again should someone mention we dine there."}
{"text":"Warning: Szechuan spiciness is very different from the normal spiciness that we see in other cuisines. The heat coats your tongue, giving you that numbing feeling and heats you up from the inside over time. It's different from other spiciness where you feel the kick right away, even burning your lips if you get the sauce on it; therefore, be mentally prepared if this is your first time experiencing Szechuan cuisine.

With that being said, this place captures that burning flavor so well. They let you choose your spiciness level in each dish, I'd recommend starting out with 'mild' if this is your first time.

I ordered the house-beef noodle and I was not disappointed. The noodles were amazing and the broth that accompanied it was delicious, best I've had so far in Las Vegas.

In addition to the delicious spicy meal, the restaurant offers you a mug of mung-bean soup, which you consume like a tea, which helps to cool down your body temperature after your meal. 

It's great that the customers are offered these drinks; however, it's also where this restaurant loses a star from my rating. The mung-bean soup that we're given were very little in quantity, it did not even fill up past half-way in the mug. Often in restaurants that I go to, the drink cups are fully filled, or comes within a big container for the customer to fill themselves. With the mung-bean soup being such a vital part to the meal, I'd expect the restaurant to give its customers a fully-filled mug.

Overall this restaurant is a great place to stop by to experience the burning essence of Szechuan flavor, perfect for cold days in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This is pretty much the best noodle that we've eaten in a long time. Going back there again two days in a row during our short stay in Vegas"}
{"text":"Had a great lunch here just now, a bowl of piping hot spareribs noodle and a side of marinated pork.  Oh, so good.  Definitely will come back again and try their other dishes.  I had been looking for a place to eat good, authentic Sichuan food in Vegas and now I've found it.  
Oh, this is a rarity in most Chinese restaurants - a clean bathroom and this place has it lol
I also like the large communal table in the center of the restaurant.  Reminds me of the village life in the old country, communal everything...."}
{"text":"Really clean and. I've environment. Lots of noodle choices and I'm glad they have non spicy oily choices as well. Ordered the hot and sour chaoshou and beef noodle soup

Flavors were a bit bland. We came because the taiwanese hand pulled noodle shop was closed."}
{"text":"Came here right before they closed for a couple of hours before the dinner shift, so it was pretty empty. The food here is ok. Sichuan dishes are an acquired taste. Service was fine since there was hardly anyone there. The prices were also decent. They started us out with a mung bean tea drink when we sat down. It's pretty tasty with a small hint of sweetness, but it does not look appetizing at all. We ordered the spare ribs noodle and the pickled beef noodle, both with an egg.

Spare rib noodle: i love spicy food, but it's kind of overpowering. Kind of like if you dumped a whole jar of chili oil in it, its not spicy but the flavor is too much. The noodles and bok choy were cooked fine. The noodles are similar to ramen noodles. The spare ribs tasted different, almost a gaminess kind of flavor. Not the flavors I was expecting.

Pickled beef noodle: this is a weird dish. It's kind of like a strong rosemary flavor, but the aftertaste numbs your mouth and is not a good feeling. The noodles were cooked fine, but I could not get past that rosemary numbness. 

I probably wouldn't come back here again. It's different than the typical Asian noodles such pho, ramen, or udon. You have to have a certain palate for these kinds flavors to enjoy it."}
{"text":"I was very surprised by this place.  We were looking for a place to eat in Chinatown and found this little gem.  I am not usually a fan of tiny thin noodles, but the flavor of the soup put this over the top.  I am a fan of both spicy and sour flavors.  We both ordered the hot and sour noodles and it hit the mark with a bullseye.  It was like an explosion in my mouth. 
 You can add additional meats and fillers for the soup for a minimal price.  We added pork, spare rib and beef.   I was surprised when a bowl of noodles filled me up.  The quantity/quality/bargain combination was unbelievable.  This place shocked me more than sticking my finger in a light socket.  To quote a Mr. Schwarzenegger, \"I'll be back\""}
{"text":"Once in a while u need to get loose in Vegas and what u also need is some authentic spicy noodles! Totally made my day. I wish I could find such place in San Diego."}
{"text":"I didn't know what to expect and was pleasantly surprised. Friendly and helpful service to explain dishes. I got wantons in chili sauce. Flavors were outstanding."}
{"text":"Coming here during the middle of the week the very first time just right after they opened the door at 11:00am might not have been the best time to come here.  

There was only one customer seated.  It took the staff a good 5 minutes before I was approached with a serving of the mung bean juice.  

I can't compare Mian with the other places I've been to down in San Gabriel Valley (CA) because there's no comparison despite the very good reviews posted on their walls.  Food was alright, but not worth going back to.   I'll save my cravings for Sichuan spicy noodles when am down in LA."}
{"text":"Mian Sichuan Noodles is a Chinese-Korean fusion cuisine. I heard a lot of good things about this place so I brought my cousin to try it out for the first time. Just by looking at the pictures, the noodles are nice, thick and generously full portions. They are true to their pictures lol  

Coming in, we were seated right away and was given the full presentation on how we should order our foods and eat in the way it was presented. There is a paper place mat that has instructions on it to show us how to eat designed by their culture on eating Sichuan noodles.

The waitress knew it was my first time (maybe because of my facial distress looking through their menu), so she referred me their top selling Chef Choices. 

I went for the #1 Zha Jiang mian noodles. Top ten best dishes of 2016 from Los Angeles Times Johnathan's Gold Food and Dining. The flavors are very rich and complimenting for the dish. Normally it comes Spicy but I had the option to choose how Spicy I wanted my dish. You can even opt out of the spices if you can't handle it. 

My cousin got the House beef noodles but they were very spicy. Our server was very sorry and concerned for him because he was continuously sweating over the spiciness. So very apologetic lol I'm surprised he finished it. His last words were, \"I ain't no bitch\" after he finished the soup.

We were given Mung bean soup which is a traditional beverage from China. It is made of natural mung beans, water, and sugar. We are suppose to drink the mung bean soup during our hot meals, for its cooking and refreshing qualities. It helps balance the Spicy dish so we can enjoy every last bite. 

I definitely will come back for more of their delicious dishes. So rich, Spicy, and sweet in the same meal. Thank you Alina for serving us and recommending our dishes to us."}
{"text":"This place is fairly new in town and people are raving about it so, i had to check it out.  
Here's what I thought..
Pros:  Menu is sweet and short but enough choices.  Flavors are endearing especially their dumplings that was well balanced with sweet and salty taste. Their  nice settings of bowls  are large enough to fill you up, it's  originality speaks for it's cold but authentic  mung bean soup which, is unlimited in it's very cute white tin mug.  I enjoyed it's lightness in texture just like tea but the beans remain in the bottom unless you mix it to taste a little sweetness. I like their paper placemats with pictures and witty slogans as well.  This place is simple but has it's own character.  Fast service, friendly staff and the price is right.  Last but not the least,  it is immaculate clean.

Cons:  They did not have any single bottled  spice on any of the tables as Asian soup places do.  It would be ideally good to have just in case people want more heat or salt in their soups.  However, i never asked.  

Lesson:  Ask and you shall receive.  Maybe??

All in all, i really enjoyed my visit here.  Check it out if you are in the area.  It will not disappoint."}
{"text":"Come to try their spicy beef noodle, but it wasn't available. We ordered the egg noodle non spicy soup with chicken gizzards noodle. No flavor for the non spicy soup. Over all they are not good food"}
{"text":"Sichuan dishes are definitely an acquired taste, it's very strong and powerful flavors. This place has good noodles. I got the pork rib noodle while my husband got the house beef noodle soup. The beef was tender and flavorful, the broth was just okay. The noodles and broth for my pork dish was amazing, but the pork was dried and barely had any meat on it. 
Our friend got one of the dumpling meals which was really good. It was flavorful but not too strong. 
The only main complaint I have would be the appetizers. The appetizers were not good at all. We got the marinated pork and steam vegetables. The vegetables were dry and looked like it was microwaved. Good thing we got the steam vegetables for free by liking their yelp page. We each had a piece of the pork and couldn't even finish chewing it.
All in all this place is decent, but nothing I would crave."}
{"text":"This place is clean. Good price? Best sichuan noodle in Vegas. Really like the sauce."}
{"text":"It's our second time to be here. We are stuck in Vegas due to the Hurricane Harvey and this little restaurant makes us feel like home after a long journey.  Especially the pickle cabage is extremely great even though It's free. And they also offer green bean soup in traditional Chinese cups for free. The noodles and the dumplings are authentic as well, which tastes the exactly the same way as we had them in China. I would definitely come here again and recommend it to my friends."}
{"text":"great chinese noodle restaurant. it has been long time since i had a good sichun spicy noodle.. mian became my favorate chinese noodle place today. service was excellent.  great casual atmosphere.  and very clean restaurant. highly recommended."}
{"text":"Favorite noodle spot in Vegas! Always come here when I'm in Vegas, many noodle choices and add-one, extra noodle is free ;) love their complimentary mung bean soup!"}
{"text":"The noodles are delicious and super spicy just the way we like it! They give you mung bean soup as a drink which is awesome!"}
{"text":"I feel like this is the beat place to have chinese noodle in las vegas......lol
I've tried it in Los Angeles, unbelievable it opens here  
Some of the noodles are kind spicy but tasty 
The green bean soup is free and pretty good during the summer time."}
{"text":"Absolut unfreundliches Personal. Würde das Restaurant nie wieder besuchen. Nachdem wir bezahlt haben, haben sie sich über das von uns zu wenig gegebene Trinkgeld beschwert. Mir persönlich hat das Essen nicht geschmeckt."}
{"text":"Must check out this place! I got the beef noodle soup and it was one of the best I've ever had! Needless to say the noodle is amazing but the meat and the soup are incredible!"}
{"text":"I came here at 8:20pm on Friday and there were many people waiting. Good vibe! Spicy wonton definitely is one of my favorite!!!"}
{"text":"I love Sichuan, so had to try this in vegas. This place is conveniently located relatively close to the strip on Spring Mountain (not too far west). The broths were delicious. I especially loved the dry noodles with gizzard! That was listed a \"chef's pick\" so gave it a try and liked it. I would go back just for it bc it was that good. I wasn't too fond of the hot and sour dumplings - it made the meat taste old. Next time, i have to stick to the original spicy dumplings in red oil. Inside you'll notice only Chinese people so you know it's authentic and meets true Sichuan standards."}
{"text":"Mian joins one busy Spring Mountain plaza with some Szechuan dishes that will leave you sweating! 

I've been watching a lot of strictly dumpling on YouTube and tried this place out with my buddy. I've never had Szechuan peppercorns and it is truly a unique heat.

They specialize in numbingly spicy dishes that you eat with a cool tea for balance. The staff literally walk around refilling mugs for the patrons. On the menu they have hot or cold dishes, dumpling or noodle dishes, and meat or vegetarian dishes. They also have appetizers that are pretty unique: my favorite being their steamed egg served in a mug with spicy ground meat.

Each main dish comes a certain way but they have add ins like extra meats or a fried egg. I opted for their chef recommended beef noodle soup. I added short ribs and intestines. These add ins are a couple bucks and served in a separate bowl of broth that they're cooked in I'm assuming. I don't recommend dumping these into your main dish as it alters the flavor. 

The hot soup with the spicy peppercorns will get you sweating even if it's cold out. The tea they serve is unique and I do recommend getting a lot of refills. 

Overall I thought this place was okay. They have terrible service. I don't think they should do sit down style ordering because they don't come by to take your order. I had to go up to the register after being their for 15 minutes to order. I advised the couple next to me to do the same after I heard them getting impatient. We also had to go up to pay. They have a lot of potential with their location if the staff would just leave the register and take some orders and refill drinks.

The food itself was okay. They dish I got was good but nothing cravable. Also the meats I ordered were cooked well but served less than luke warm and not too flavorful. The heat from the peppercorn was definitely an experience but the overall flavor was a miss. If anything their egg appetizer and mushroom appetizer were things I'd get again. With so many other Szechuan restaurants in the area I'd not come back here anytime soon."}
{"text":"Delicious noodles and friendly service. I love that they have this mung bean soup drink that's super refreshing."}
{"text":"Mian is everything it is supposed to be. Simple, clean, unpretentious, fresh tasting and explosively flavorful. I had the beef noodle today (pictured), and from the first bite into the spicy noodle's perfect texture, I knew I was going to be a regular here.

The amazing noodles swimming in the hot soup, bright red chili oil, and tender, rich pieces of beef, I just couldn't stop smiling. You know that cold water can't touch the heat of a chili oil. So, when you need to cool off the heat, take a sip from the cool mug of sweet mung bean soup. It's lovely in its own right on a hot Las Vegas day, but perfect at taking down the cumulative effect of a hot chili oil. 

Mian is the kind of place I need when I crave a perfect bowl of noodles, and lucky me, it's right down the street. With two other locations, one in LA and the other in Honolulu, Mian deserves every bit of the substantial good press they've received."}
{"text":"Love the noodle!  Free green bean soup!! Wow!!!  Also free refill on noodle!! Will leave this place with a full stomach!!!"}
{"text":"??????????????? ???????????????? ????? ??
???? yelp????? ???

I don't think there are many Chinese restaurant have native flavor, but this one does, the soup is really good , and beef are the best , jucy and yummy."}
{"text":"I did not have good impression of the restaurant as soon as I walked in, there were no one worked at the front desk, and we had to call someone in the back of the kitchen so we can be seated.  I asked if they served their noodle in ceramic bowl or plastic bowl, and the server just replied \"we are not Japanese restaurant\", ok? that's an awkward answer...so I asked the question again slower, and server still didn't understand what I meant, finally I had to ask question in mandarin and it was confirmed they use melamine/plastic bowl(funny some people replied to my question that they use ceramic which clearly isn't).  I'm not a big fan of hot noodle soup serves in chemical filling melamine bowl so I walked right out."}
{"text":"Delicious, tasty & fast service. When it says spicy be advised but it is not an over powering spicy because the complex flavors still come through. Second time here & plan on returning again."}
{"text":"My favorite noodle place in town. It is neat as it comes with mung bean soup which is recommended for every meal to reduce the heat. Afraid to come at the first place as I do not take spicy, they do have non spicy option and some other you could also request for non spicy."}
{"text":"Love the mung bean tea. This new spot is a hidden gem. Noodles look great! Love the mung bean tea. This new spot is a hidden gem. Noodles look great! Love the mung bean tea. This new spot is a hidden gem. Noodles look great!"}
{"text":"Wow!! The smell alone is amazing! The complementary tea is wonderful! I love it here!"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying authentic Sichuan Noodles so I don't have much of a reference point but I know I liked what I had and so did everyone else in my party. 

In Vegas kind of late and getting hungry, started Yelping for a noodle house. Typical Ramen shops popped up but this one caught my eye primarily because the photos and description looked very authentic when compared to the You Tube videos by The Food Ranger Trevor James eating his way around China. I was a little skeptical not realizing that Las Vegas has an area that has become a booming Asia Town in terms of shops and eateries. 

We arrived at 8:45 pm and the place was empty but started filling up as we sat. Being unsure of much on the menu, we had a conversation with our server about what taste profiles we liked, what we were looking for and what some of her favorites were. She gave great advice along with a small free starter of pickled cabbage and some cold mung bean sweet soup that really was more of a refreshing beverage that cuts the heat more than anything. 

As the food arrived, I was amazed by the new flavor profiles, especially the mouth-numbing quality of the Sichuan peppercorns and I loved how you can specify the spice level of your dish. If you want it hotter, just let them know. I thought about a piquant intestine noodle dish but opted for the spare rib noodle dish which was fantastic. Sampled everyone else's too and nobody got a bad meal. 

The food was great and the setting/menu/taste is unique enough that it stimulates a lot of social conversation at the table unless, I suppose, you are dining with people that are experts on this regional cuisine. The food really was unique but I can easily see how it is a comfort food of Northern China. In the end, we spent about $40 for a party of 3 and had more food than we could possibly eat but it was a great experience and definitely a recommended non-ramen noodle place for the area."}
{"text":"Very clean place excellent service good food well come back again and bring all friend"}
{"text":"Authentic Chinese, great food. I loved the tea that they served--it helped with the spice. However, service was not up to par."}
{"text":"I went here with a bunch of friends after happy hour. They easily accommodated our fairly large group. Service was alright. My biggest gripe with it was that they failed to realize they were out of one of the dishes my friend ordered so everybody else's food came out and it wasn't until then they informed him. Another friend in my group has a wheat allergy so he asked if it was possible to have his order with just broth and no noodles, but unfortunately, they could not accommodate him. Also, bring cash if coming in a group, they don't really split checks.

Despite this, I really enjoyed the food. I don't recall the name of the dish I ordered, but it was spicy and did not have broth. The flavour was really delicious, although I could have used a little more spice. (Not the restaurant's fault, just a personal preference.) The noodles had a really nice consistency and there was a nice amount of meat and sauce. I would definitely return with friends who are into spicy food."}
{"text":"MIAN deserves 5 stars all the way. Friendly and caring staffs; delicious food and great portions. You will notice all the intimate details in here.

Tips: You can add noodles for free and they come in a separate small bowl with sauce or soup. I suggest order it later if the big bowl is not enough for you."}
{"text":"This has always been my favorite place in China town. I got bad service a couple times and was reluctant to come back. But I missed the food and it does not disappoint. I have been back 5 times since my couple bad service experience and they have been on point and friendly. The food is always the best!"}
{"text":"As someone of Chinese origin, I can say with 100% certainty that the selection of authentic Chinese restaurants are extremely limited in Las Vegas...especially ones that specialize in noodles. Most Chinese restaurants here in Las Vegas caters more to an American palate. And of the authentic Chinese restaurants, most are just \"meh.\" 

And that's why i was so excited when I saw Mian while driving down Spring Mountain, and I was not disappointed when I finally went. The noodles were delicious AND very spicy...as Sichuan-style Chinese food should be.

The service was also fast and attentive...an unusual quality for an authentic Chinese restaurant in Chinatown ;) 

I also love the ambiance of the restaurant...very trendy. Mian somehow made a very boring, traditional type of Chinese food feel \"cool.\" The ambiance of the restaurant makes you want stay awhile after you finish eating to hang out with your friends and chat.

But yea, great restaurant. Definitely would come back. A must go-to place whenever you have friends from Taiwan or China visit."}
{"text":"If you like spicy, you must come here and try their spicy noodles. If you cannot eat too spicy, they serve bean soup which can make you feel better from the pain and keep on enjoy the spicy noodles. I will recommend my friend to come here and have a great meal here. You will love it once you tried it."}
{"text":"Located in a plaza with plenty of free parking space. Taste great, feels like back to China. Strongly recommend!"}
{"text":"Came here per my family's recommendation who was here during Mother's Day weekend. They said this place is the best noodle place in Chinatown Las Vegas- I agree! I love the mung bean drink- different than the typical water drink that other restaurants. Noodles are good- we got the house beef noodle soup. Pretty good!"}
{"text":"this noodles is form sichuan ? very good teast? spicy. sauce on the bottom?just mix it"}
{"text":"* Piquant intestine noodles soup. VERY SPICY, but delicious. Seriously 8.5/10 Asian spicy. Don't underestimate 
* Clear broth zajiang noodles soup. Delicious! Used sone of the spicy broth in the other soup to spice it up even. Really great comfort food 
* Chili oil chap shou dumplings. Excellent 

They serve appetizers last. They also serve a mung bean soup to neutralize any spiciness. The flavor is very pleasant and slightly sweet. Highly recommend this spot even for dates."}
{"text":"Authentic Sichuan noodle, i love the spiciness and how they give you green beans soup for drink instead pf water  (it enhances the flavors)"}
{"text":"Over cooked noodles and fried egg.  Doesn't honor its Yelp promotion.  Good steamed egg and  dumplings. Boy waiter was a douche--would have rated place more highly if I hadn't interacted with him."}
{"text":"This place is so artistically modern. You start out with mung bean soup which is a slightly cold, sweetened mung bean soup. It tastes pretty refreshing. We got the house noodle soup and sweet and spicy noodle ... Pretty good! Try it with friends this place is hip."}
{"text":"This is a new hidden gem. I believe it's owned by the people who did Chang du taste. If you like spicy stuff come here and there's no wait"}
{"text":"Great noodles w very tender beef. Spicy as it should be. Free appetizer if checkin on yelp. They give you this cold mung bean soup that cools you down when your tongue is on fire. Very nice customer service:)"}
{"text":"Honestly the best noodles I have ever had. I had the pig intestine noodle with medium spice and it was so simple yet delicious! The spice was great! The broth was tasty. The meal started with a complimentary cold mung bean \"soup\" which was like sweetened iced tea that we could not get enough of! I ate here a couple weeks ago and have craved it EVERY DAY since then. The server was also very friendly and helpful to my friend and I who were there for the first time. Prices also amazing! Overall great experience!!!"}
{"text":"Surprise, surprise! Most authentic spicy sour noodle i have ever had in the States, and it is 10 mins from the Strip in Vegas! 

Came in here during a biz trip. Was fed up with all the Vegas froufrou, fine wine and steak (not exactly complaining but i need something refreshing :).Looked up Chinese food around the Strip and found Mian. 

$10 Uber ride later, I was here. 

Mian, literally means \"rice noodle\" in Chinese. And that's all you would find on the menu, besides few appetizers. 

I was skeptical: coming from NYC, I was pretty confident we got the best Chinese food in the States (on average, this is still true). But the moment I saw that red, hot, big bowl of spicy sour noodle, in my face! My doubt gone out the window :) . It was just like what I remembered back in the street of Chengdu. Thin rice noodle, slightly toothsome, floating in ping ping hot sweet sour soup decorated with green onion, fried eggs, fried soybeans and pickled green beens. Hit the spot!

I was hungry so I also ordered woodears mushrooms, cold chili beef and a beef stew noodle to go. Def overkilled. But hey, we are in Vegas ;P . everything was delicious and traditional Sichuan cooking. The beef stew was seasoned in five spice and cooked prob hours before serving - was savory sweet and melt-in-your-mouth tender!

I also spotted other less know items  such as bone broth noodle, which aptly called \"milk soup noodle\" due to its silky, milky texture and color. 

Def will come back next time I am in Vegas and highly recommend!

PS. I could give 5 star but i think the spicy sour noodle could tone down on the salt and up the heat :) But that just me."}
{"text":"Delicious spicy Chinese noodles in Vegas. I recommend the sour spicy noodles with beef. 
And Spicy soup base!"}
{"text":"I love spicy food + noodles so obviously I'm going to love this place.  Ordered the Spare Rib nlNoodles, the Zha Jang mian, and some Beef Bone wontons. 

For both of the noodles, I asked for regular spicy. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the heat level was quite high. It was relatively spicy, but not unbearable. The noodles were perfect, and the accompanying sauce/soup broth on each were delicious! I liked how on the soup, you could clearly taste a robust beef noodle soup base along with the mala and spice taste.

The wontons were simply flavored, some milky beef broth, green onion and white pepper. 

I also liked the cold, lightly sweetened mungbean broth. It helps cool off your mouth in between eating your spicy noodles."}
{"text":"After a day of food on the Vegas Strip (Brunch & Steak dinner), my husband and I wanted some simple Chinese food before heading home. My husband found Mian Sichuan Noodles on Yelp and we decided that's where we were going to have lunch.  
It's fun reading the paper cover while waiting. The noodles are fresh. I love the wontons both in non-spicy soup and the spicy sauce. It was very flavorful. The wonton did not have seafood. It's a bonus for me only because I am allergic. They serve mung bean soup. It's a nice touch. Water was not needed with our meal. We may eat at the location in Los Angeles too!
The service was great. The waitress is friendly."}
{"text":"The chilled green bean soup was really nice, especially when you are going to have some spicy noodles. Appetizers does what they suppose to do: to appetize. The noodles are just AMAZING! You cannot get anything wrong, even by just randomly pointing at the menu. Plus, Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Want a warm bowl of spicy noodles or wontons?  Mian is your place. This noodle restaurant serves dishes that comes from the schezuan area of China. It's cold there year long so people love spicy food to keep warm ( or at least that's what my mom told me). 

I got their chengdu zhazheng mian that comes with a spicy sauce( definitely not too spicy) and it comes with veggies fried egg and ground pork. It's broth-less. I thought the dish was really good. At the end the peppers got a little gritty but this is a delicious hearty bowl of noodles. I would have liked more veggies but you can always order extra on the side.  They have non spicy options as well. Also they serve their meals with mung bean soup which is almost like a surgery tea. It seemed like dessert to me and paired really well with their spicy food. 

The must try dish here is their steamed egg. I missed it on the menu but my friend ordered it and it was so so good!  It comes in a cup and the egg is topped with a sweet soy sauce and ground beef. The egg texture is so soft and velvety!  It's amazing. I will definitely order that again the next time in back."}
{"text":"This is probably by far the best noodle place I have in Vegas. The wontons were so good I can't stop eating. This place is a must-go. Try it out. Spicy lovers will love it."}
{"text":"Best noodles place in Vegas for sure! Real authentic and very spicy, it should be your first choice if you want some noodles, hands down."}
{"text":"Mian Sichuan Noodles is delicious! I ordered the House Beef Noodles and it was full of flavor! The soup has a nice umami flavor and a good spicy kick. They also have Mung Bean cold tea that's free. It's a light sweet taste, similar to Chrysanthemum tea. I will definitely come again!"}
{"text":"Vegas never ceases to amaze. Wanting to get away from the unlimited food offerings, looked around for a noodle joint. In an unassuming strip joint (not the dirty kind), we walked into Mian Noodles. After asking for recommendations, we settled on the Zhajiang Mian and the special Chengdu cold noodles. We selected the radish appetizer and the marinated pork appetizer as well. Tip #1, check in, write a note get 1 of 4 free appetizer options. Tip #2 if you want the spare ribs with your noodles, don't get here when it opens. They cook it in the morning and takes about an hour to finish. 

Onto the food. The radish appetizer was surprising! Slightly sweet, texturally rubbery and a little spicy. Sure doesn't sound appetizing when written in words, but don't knock it til you try it! Especially if it's free :) Next up was the marinated pork. We thought it was like meat meat, but I believe it was more like pork jowl. For those who've had it, it's either a love or hate; there is no inbetween.

 The noodles themselves were super flavorful and chewy. The cold noodle was a sesame, peanut base slightly sweet and the zhajiang mien was savory with a soy sauce based sauce and minced pork and some baby bok Choy. Wash down the meal with complementary mung bean water and this makes for a fantastic low price meal for two!"}
{"text":"Craving fulfilled! I really wanted \"spicy noodles\" whatever that means. I was going to settle for some spicy instant ramen after a long day of work, but here comes Yelp to the rescue.  I ordered to-go and I went with the spicy cold noodle and the pork dumplings in chili oil. It was ready in about ten minutes and did not break the bank either. 

I loved everything I ordered. Such good flavor! The noodle dish had good heat, but wasn't overly spicy. My lips and tongue were tingling though!  The noodles were a good texture. Lots of garlic. Total flavorbomb! It's vegan too!

The pork dumplings in chili oil were one of the better versions I've had. I liked that they packaged the dumplings separately from the sauce. Lemme tell you, that sauce is crack! It has a hint of sweetness which makes it oh so tasty! 

I like how the menu is organized and you know which dishes are: soup, no soup, vegan, spicy, not spicy. 

I'm looking forward to my next visit here already!"}
{"text":"Free appetizers for check in and comment:) 
Super friendly staff& nice service 

So glad they are open, gonna be my noodle spot from now on? 

Tried their cold mixed noodles!! So good"}
{"text":"\"You guys order for me.  I don't know Asiany stuff\" says Midwest poker bud.

Five minutes later, piquant pig intestine noodles with gizzard.

\"Awww come on!\"  in total evaporation.

Just in time for the falling temperatures comes the sister restaurant of Chengdu Taste serving one thing; zhajiangmian-style noodles.  A spicy noodle soup with a complex beef broth set on fire with the addition of chilies and tongue numbing Sichuan peppercorns.  The spice of the food is not taste bud blowing but rather coats the whole mouth.  You feel the heat but you are still able to taste the goodness of the ingredients as you eat.  That said, you will still sweat.

The menu is simple and offers variants of the same noodle dish in either a standard spicy broth or a hot and sour broth.  Although there is a primary protein, diners can order extra ingredients including all proteins offered in different soups and free additional noodles.

Noodles are well cooked, still maintaining their chew.  They do absorb the soup rapidly so eat quickly.  The broth itself, very spicy but brings out the sweetness of the beef (beef noodle soup) and the richness of the intestine (piquant intestine noodles).  The mineral taste of the gizzard blends pleasantly with the soup the way a blood cake would work in other Asian noodle dishes.  The only issue, the braised beef could have been cooked longer.   Slightly tough but still flavorful.

The chili oil chaoshou (steamed dumplings) are good with the chili oil bringing out the sweetness of the pork dumpling.  

Finally, do follow their recommendation and drink the free, cooling mung bean \"soup\".  Slightly sweet, it kills the burn better than water.

Asian service.  You get your food and if you need anything, wave your arms in the air and flag someone down.

Inexpensive.   Less than $10/bowl.

New eatery well worth the visit (if you can handle the spice)."}
{"text":"Would highly recommend special gizzard noodles. Zajiang noodles with peas are also very good, as well as the szechuan bone soup noodles for a non-spicy option. 

Their beef noodles and appetizers were just okay. The best part is they serve cold green bean tea/soup (???) that is sweet and refreshing on a hot summer day."}
{"text":"If you like the Chinese numbing spice (Szechuan peppercorns) then this is absolutely the place for you!!

They've got very attentive staff and great noodles. I came here hungry with a few friends and we all tried different dishes. I ordered the house beef noodle soup regular spice and it was great! There was just enough spice in it but not an overpowering amount. They gave us generous amounts of meats and noodles for the price ($9.99). We also tried to dry noodle and spare rib noodle soup. Their spare rib noodle soup was alright for me. I'd definitely recommend the House Beef Noodle though. They also give you a cup of cold sweet soup that is free and refillable! It tastes better once you have the actual food, it was kind of weird without the food. Definitely helps you calm your numb tongue!"}
{"text":"?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Warning: this place has received C grade from health inspection. 

The place feels a little unorganized and not surprising that it is not that clean. The noodle dishes were very similar and not very appetizing. Kinda bland and just spicy. The mung bean soup they give you was a little different- sweet. Overall this place needs to get cleaned up. 2.5/5 stars"}
{"text":"Delicious food, recommend to anyone interested in trying authentic Taiwanese food! Food is spectacular, you get a refreshing mung bean soup that is given with every meal, the apps are very affordable and the food is"}
{"text":"Really good noodle shop in Las Vegas! It's off the strip in Chinatown so the prices are affordable. I went with a group of people and no one complained about their food. We ordered a pork dumpling appetizer and for myself, I got the short rib noodle soup with a fried egg added at a level 2 (the woman laughed at me when I said level 3 so I dropped it down a notch). The short ribs were really tender and the broth was a mix of the fat from the short ribs, hot oil and bone broth. It was like velvet.

I'd go back again if I needed a noodle fix. The spice level was just right. If you want some noodles that aren't ramen, check out Mian."}
{"text":"Very cool new place. Stopped in for lunch. I had a spicy short rib noodle soup. Carol had a tomato veggie noodle soup"}
{"text":"I would give this place 2.5 stars because its not terrible but it doesn't deserve 3 and the business shows.
Their business model is really cute and very well presented and there is no reason why the place shouldn't be slammed like Monta Ramen or Jinya.

The biggest problem is its service, I've read this is several yelp reviews.
Their staff is poorly trained.  It usually one 1 person per shift who truly cares, refills your mug, checks up on you and notices your hand up trying to hail for service.  The rest usually stand around like statues trying to do less work.  Today when I got the check, I put my card on the tray and left it at the corner of my table.  The fat guy passed us three times and did nothing,  the skinny guy finally noticed it.  LOL
I made eye contact every time just too see how much they care.  Then it came back without a pen from the fat guy.  It just goes to show thier training.  I don't get mad, I think its laughable.

I've been back to the place about 5 times now and I come because the prices are good and you get free extra noodle.  However I have to warn you, the food is not for everyone.  Pretty much everything here is spicy and mouth numbing.  Yes I said mouth numbing.  They put ingredients in their noodles that has a local anesthesia effect.   My mom is from Szechuan so I am used to it but not really either cuz they over do it.  

The food is good but its TOO spicy and too much of the numbing agent.  I can't really taste my food after the 5th bite.  I'm sure management will argue that flavor is subjective and spice level depends on the user.  I disagree.  Here in America we have real culinary schools and not just family hand down recipe kitchens, and they will tell you there is absolutely something called, too much heat, too much garlic, too much seasoning.

So compared to like spicy tuna rolls, spicy ramen bowls, some Kimchi, Or even a bag of hot cheetos.  This place is really spicy.  You might argue that it's authentic but that doesn't mean its not too spicy for Las Vegas and hence the business they get.

The free mung bean soup beverage to me.  I love it,  but I gotta say most people don't drink it.  It looks like a cup of muddy water, and it is but it's good for you.  What I find hilarious is that the mug says soup on it in Chinese and translation soup!.  LOL  I laugh because you have to be Chinese to understand that we have a lot things \"called soup\" that's actually just a beverage.  What I found hysterical was that one day while sitting at the big center shared table, a couple across from us who was actually from Cheng Du  took one look at the mung Bean soup and passed on it.  Then After I asked for a refill in of it in Chinese,  They overheard me and said,  OH! that's what this is? and started drinking it like normal Chinese folks.  ROFL

So Although I give it a bad rating,  I personally like this place, but it needs a ton of tweaks, because although the star rating is high, this business here is not that good for these reasons.

#1 Poor Service
#2 Too spicy
#3 TOO MUCH NUMBING AGENT!  no one eats that stuff except for Szechuan people.  but I'm positive they want to Americanize the business for more sales or why bother making all those English cartoons.
#4 I love the mung bean soup but its gotta go,  most people are grossed out by it.

So would I recommend this place?  Yes, but only if you're into the weird because the numbing agent helps you NOT taste your food. But that's what Szechuan is!  LOL!"}
{"text":"This is very specialized noodle place with authentic chongquin noodle. Very unique experience. It is for those who seek the authentic taste."}
{"text":"One of my friends told me about Mian Sichuan Noodles. It was brand spanking new and how could I resist trying out a new spot? A NOODLE spot at that! I love some good noodles!

Came here on a Saturday afternoon for lunch with my fiance and my best friend. We were lucky enough to find a spot the moment we got to the plaza and were seated right away. 

My fiance went with their spicy beef noodles. My best friend went with their hot and sour noodles. As for me, I went with their spicy pig intestine noodles. For every bowl of noodles, you have the option of adding extra items to it such as an egg, more meat, etc. Extra noodles are free of charge so if you're a big eater or you just want a giant serving, go ahead and get a serving of free noodles! All the extras that you get on the side literally comes on the side. They don't put it in your bowl of noodles. They serve it to you in an individual bowl unless you get a fried egg. If you get extra noodles, extra beef, side of something else .. you will have a total of four bowls. 

My bowl of noodles definitely had a good amount of kick. It was spicy but it's a different kind of spicy than most people are used to. They use the numbing spice. This type of spicy is quite famous in the Sichuan region. In Chinese, we refer it to \"mala\" which is pretty much translated to \"numbing spicy\" .. the herbs that they use will numb your tongue. It's a completely different feeling from having ghost pepper. So if you like this type of spicy then go for it. If you don't then don't get it because you won't like it. 

Other than the numbing spice, the bowl of noodles was definitely a burst of flavor. My bowl was actually a different base than my fiance's. His had less spice and more of a beefy flavor. I also enjoyed the pig intestines quite a bit. They were flavorful and fatty. 

They also give you a decent amount of noodles in your bowl. I actually didn't finish my bowl of noodles because I got so full. 

You also get a green bean/mung bean drink with your meal. It is slightly sweet and refreshing. The servers come around asking if you want a refill on that too, which is nice. You might have to tell them to speak English though. 

So why three stars? The location of this establishment is horrid. I hate the plaza that it's in. It gets really busy there due to Tea Station and Ichiza so finding parking can be a nightmare, especially during dinner time. Honestly, I don't think I would come again if I had to deal with that nightmare. I would probably only come in random odd hours where the parking won't be annoyingly stupid. 

The service, as someone else has mentioned, is quite lackluster. There will be times where they're constantly walking around and making sure you're okay but then there are times where none of them are there. Making eye contact is especially hard because it seems they're trying to avoid you. When you say \"excuse me\" you have to say it loud or they ignore you. I got ignored twice. Despite that, they are all very polite and nice. 

Overall, it is decent. It's just not the type of spicy flavors that I prefer. I don't like the numbing effect of the spice. I wouldn't mind trying it again though."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying these type of noodles. Definitely a good first place to try them."}
{"text":"First time here and heard good things about it.  They brought us some cabbage and green bean soup as soon as we sat down. After that, I ordered the pig intestine noodle with less spicy and steam egg. I can't handle spicy but I love to eat them. The steam egg is really good. The egg is soft and smooth. The texture of the noodle is good, but the soup base was a little bland. Overall, it's pretty good. I love their appetizer the most!"}
{"text":"Very nice and clean place. Good customer service.  Jerry and Lewis was very nice. I order the beef noodle soup. It was good. They gave you a large portion of noodle. I just wish the beef was cook a little bit longer. Too chewing for me. The over all experiment was good."}
{"text":"I grew up in Chongqing, this place is very authentic.  The desserts and noodles make me feel like I am home. Highly recommended.  We ordered chengdu zajiang , suanla mian, several side dishes and dessert dishes"}
{"text":"We were in search of a Chinese noodle place. This place was weird but really good. The pork dumplings in chili garlic oil were the best. Mung bean soup was served cold. Sounds awful but it was good. Really interesting place. Give it a shot."}
{"text":"The noodle is really fresh made, I really like the sweet green bean  beverage that they are serving. I came two times today, and I felt that I must leave them a comment! Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Best noodle place I have ever been to.  We came from California and there are many noodle places, Chinese, Vietnamese Pho, Japanese Ramen, etc.  We went there twice during the 2 days we are at Vegas this time. We tried 5 different noodles there and all of them are good."}
{"text":"This is my first time trying this restaurant. I luv it and the mung bean soup!!! Very authentic Chinese Sichuan noodles for spicy lovers. Good service and very friendly staffs!"}
{"text":"This place is easily among the best sichuanese experiences I've ever had in the US. Their dumplings are fantastic, noodles delicious, and the sides are legit. We ordered their beef noodles and the red chili oil dumplings and an assortment of sides. Everything came out to a reasonable price and we were super full. I'm definitely coming here again next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Good service good food! This cute restaurant belongs to tasty chengdu, authentic Sichuan noodle"}
{"text":"Went there 2 days ago and came back again yesterday! Super nice place and the noodles taste so good and authentic! STRONGLY RECOMMEND : )"}
{"text":"Our family stopped in here one day for lunch.  Mom was feeling noodles and we'd just had ramen the day before so this was a different sort.

The name of the game is Szechuan, spicy noodles.  They don't have many other dishes other than a few appetizers so get your mind focused on noodles!

The four of us all ordered different things. I liked my mom's the best - the intestine noodles.  The intestines were very tender and nicely seasoned.  

Brother ordered the hot and sour wontons which I felt were really good.  He thought the regular spicy wontons were better (less soupy).  

Hubby's minced pork noodles went so fast so I guessed he liked it?

Finally, my noodles.  I wasn't in the mood for spicy so I got their bone broth noodles.  This did not come with any meat so I added some beef.  I wasn't a huge fan of this.  The soup was ok...but not really great paired with noodles. The broth was already sort of on the light side.  Paired with noodles, it just washed out the whole dish. Also the side of beef was super hard and not nearly cooked down enough.  

For the sides, we really liked the cloud mushroom dish.  We ended up ordering two of them.

Service was nice.  They were very generous with their offer of green bean soup refills (nice and refreshing to go with the spicy foods).

If you're in the mood for spicy noodles, definitely come have a bowl here!"}
{"text":"How did this place got such high grade? It's nothing extraordinary. Mediocre food and bad serves. I got chicken gizzard noodles and wonton soup. There were literally 4 pieces of chicken gizzards on the noodle...And the wonton was too sweet-American Chinese style I guess? 
Last night, when I was ordering the food, the waiter walked away even before I finished my sentence, and the restaurant was not even busy at that point. And there was no water. I asked a waitress if I could have some water. She looked at me, did even say anything, and then walked away. But she did bring me the water. 
After I finished I waited for a few minutes and made eye contact with some waiters as a hint for a check, but all of them just stood there and continued chatting, instead of giving me a check. Eventually I had to get it by myself. 
This is not a pleasant experience at all."}
{"text":"Haven't tried the food yet, but I have heard lots of good things! I love the placemat though, very cute."}
{"text":"For Vegas this was not a bad place. Generally the food standards in Vegas tend be lower, the taste I mean. I have yet to find a place that I would like run back to in Vegas. I am sure it exist but I could not find it yet.

The noodles, soup and stewed beef were quite scrumptious here. We were served with Mung bean tea which was the first time for me. Sichuan restaurants serve this but I have never had this. Overall very authentic and quite tasty."}
{"text":"Great authentic Szechuan spicy noodles. Recommend to anyone who love spicy food. The service is also great. Clean and organized place and friendly waiters."}
{"text":"This is my favorite noodle house to get the beef noodle soup in Vegas. It's pretty hard to get LA quality, but this place comes close. I like how you can set how spicy you want your soup too because a lot of the other noodle houses here in Chinatown don't make their bowls spicy enough. It's also relatively new so there's no wait!"}
{"text":"??????? ? Las Vegas ?????????????????

A great place to get some tasty Chengdu noodles and dumplings. Highly recommend and I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"We were promptly greeted and seated then served with their famous refreshing mung bean drink.  The menu has enough variety to choose from. We ordered appetizer of pickled cabbage and main dishes of Spare ribs noodle and hot &  sour noodle for dining in plus another two dishes to go. Both noodles were flavorful. The hot & sour noodle is a little less spicy than the spare ribs noodle but it has incredible combination of sour & spice and a nice contrast with the crunchy soy beans sprinkled on it. The spare ribs are tender and a nice combination with the noodle. We'll be back whenever we are in town!"}
{"text":"Solid 4 star noodle place with affordable prices and tasty dishes. The house beef noddle had fresh noodles with the right consistency--not too tough, not overly soft, etc. A medium spiced dish is spicy enough for most people. $10, plus a fried egg for a dollar more, is a good price point.

It's not the best such dish I've had but it is a good one and one I would eat again."}
{"text":"Noodle is handcrafted and with endless Qness make sure you request light on the hotness 

If you try it once will definitely come back we spend our lunch and dinner at this spot the atmosphere is Chinese theme 

Good service all around and they have free beverage (green bean) that will wash out the hotness and numbness


Remember egg custard yummy"}
{"text":"Overall great experience. Noodles had a nice chew, beef and soup base had good flavor. Better than some noodle shops I've had at home. Got regular spicy which was just right and the cool mung bean soup they provided definitely complements well."}
{"text":"The food is good and the service is great , will come back again. The attention we received was excellent. We came from California and it was our first stop. Would recommend."}
{"text":"First time trying chinese noodles like this. Really loved the mung bean drink that went along with the spicy soup. Me and my husband eat spicy often so we didn't find it spicy enough! No fear though, they will happily bring you a side dish of chili oil if you ask. I ordered the spicy sour noodle soup and my husband got the beef noodle soup. We definitely like the beef noodle the best. The broth was very rich and beefy and the noodles were nice and springy. Service was great considering there is just one guy working the whole front when we went. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent noodle! Authentic Si Chiang taste! 
Must try Zajiang noodle with peas! ??????? ??????????Great  customer service also!"}
{"text":"??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????100??????????"}
{"text":"First time here. Really like the mung bean soup. I tried the beef noodle soup and the spicy wonton. Really enjoyed ut"}
{"text":"Interesting flavor broth that will numb your taste bud.
I like the mung bean drink tho, very refreshing.
Service was okay, he really didn't greet us."}
{"text":"Yelp recommended this place & so happy I checked it out. Food is delicious, service was great, and very clean place. Will go back"}
{"text":"Gave this place a try since it is fairly new. Ordered the spare rib spicy noodle.  The meat taste very old and soggy, only ate 1/8 of it, couldn't finish the rest and gave up. So was my friend who only took a bite of her food and gave up too.  Waitress came by and ask how was our food, how come we are not eating? Told her the meat was old and it taste horrible. She replied \"oh\" and walked off.  Waste of money, wouldn't come back again. We went to another restaurant to eat after we left here."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and enjoyed my experience here. I ordered the intestine noodle mild spicy level. I like spicy food however I don't have a huge tolerance of it so mild was pretty good for me. The broth is very flavorful and I do like the tinggling/numbing feeling from the pepper. I also ordered the jelly appetizer thing but it is more of a dessert to me then an appetizer. I can't wait to go back to try more dishes."}
{"text":"This is their second location in Las Vegas! I been to the one in LA and this place is just as good!"}
{"text":"I love noodles. I can eat it everyday. In fact, as I am typing this review, I am making noodles for breakfast. Living in the Bay Area has its perks but good Chinese food is not one of them. I get excited about the food in Vegas and I couldn't wait to drag a few friends to Mian.

I had been to Mian in the SGV so I knew what to expect. The three of us ordered 4 items to share: Pork Dumplings, Spare Ribs Noodles, Cold Noodles, and Chengdu ZaJiang Noodles. All were great. The Spare Rib Noodle was the only soup noodle dish and that was probably the \"least great.\" The others loved the Pork Dumplings but as a true noodle fan, I preferred the noodles. 

The spice creeps up on you. It's a good thing they provide mung bean drink to cut through the heat. We couldn't finish all of the food and the total was only $15 per person."}
{"text":"We always stop by tea station next door but this is our first time walking into Mian after hearing all the great reviews! No regrets!"}
{"text":"This is probably my most favorite for me and my GF to eat at. For starters you should probably start with the Chengdu Zajiang Noodles as they are spicy enough to get a taste of what the Chinese province of Sichuan have to offer and still enjoy your meal."}
