{"text":"Daughter ordered GLUTEN free pizza and was given regular pizza. She was told by the server it was gluten-free. For her, eating GF is medically necessary, not a trend. Called upon discovery of this serious mistake. Manager was polite but completely unconcerned. He also had no understanding of consequences of food allergies. Great regular pizza but poor service and a dangerous error. Just a heads up since they offer a GF menu."}
{"text":"love wolfman pizza. everything is pretty good, any pizza you get, you cant go wrong, i recently tried the thai pizza and enjoyed it. great service, very very quick delivery, they are great! clean inside and polite servers. only complaints to say, the one time ive eaten inside i wanted pizza and sticks my friend wanted to add a salad too and ordering everything individually was costly, however after paying, we saw a sign for a lunch special that the waitress never mentioned.... the lunch special was exactly what we would have ordered... if we had known... i cant deduct a star bc of one waitress though. Ive also had the wings which i didnt like... they r baked, but i got buffalo with barely any buffalo sauce so if u like them saucy ask for extra! and personally the wings werent cooked enough for me, they should go about it a different way. noone likes soggy wings. but overall, great place, great pizza, awesome on delivery too!"}
{"text":"Wolfman pizza is my personal favorite pizza place in Charlotte... it's California style pizza, so don't expect New York style when you sit down. The best of the best is the Big,Bad Wolf and don't overlook the local beer selection! $4.50 for a full pint of Sugar Creek's Dubbel"}
{"text":"I am new to the Charlotte area and I wanted really good pizza. I searched on yelp and almost went some where else but based on these reviews I want to wolf man pizza and I'm happy I did! I ordered the month special and it was good! Good flavor, sauce and amount of toppings. Just disappointed I didn't order the largest size so I could have leftovers for the next day! I will be coming back and will refer my friends and family."}
{"text":"This is a really interesting place. Decor is super cool, wolfs/wolf men pics all over, even some carvings. You can see them cooking/flipping pizzas/dough which is cool but also the reason they got a 4. They don't have much counter space, and anyone who had longer hair was just wearing a baseball cap, so that didn't seem very sanitary. Now about the pizzas.. We got the cheeseburger and a veggie. Cheeseburger actually tasted like a cheeseburger, and it seemed like there was mustard and other cheeseburger seasonings in the sauce!! Didn't even try the veggie, just filled up on cheeseburger. Good place for dinner."}
{"text":"I love this place. I've been a handful of times now and it's always delicious.  They have some unique combinations and always use fresh ingredients.  They call it \"california style,\" however I think it's better than most of the pizza that I ate when I lived in San Diego for a few years.  Always local beers on tap and they run some specials sometimes.  At Quail Corners the patio seems to be dog friendly, so that's a big plus."}
{"text":"Wolfbites need to be taken off the menu. The menu said 6 per order \"Mozzarella cheese and our secret spicy red sauce served with ranch \" for $7.99. What u get is 6 small bread spirals with a little bit of sauce and cheese. It tasted like hot pockets. Nothing was spicy. I honestly didn't know what I was ordering. I should have asked for more details because the description is vague.  I thought I was getting fried cheese bites with spicy red dipping sauce. I like the pizza but save your money and do not order this appetizer.  It's a rip off and it taste bad."}
{"text":"This place has excellent pizza! If you like pizza with pineapple, I highly recommend the Maui. The inside was super cute and I love how you can see them making your pizza. Everyone that works there was very nice and our waitress was great! Can't wait to come back for some more!"}
{"text":"Id give 6 stars if I could but this place is amazing. My family & I frequent this neighborhood pizza joint in a regular basis, even when it's not a full moon. The entire staff is always super friendly & great with my kids. Sally remembers our order every time without skipping a beat. We recommend the Big Bad Wolf pie!!!"}
{"text":"We ordered carryout, so I can't really vouch either way for the service in-house (although the servers I met were extremely nice for the brief time I was there, and the decor was fun). We ordered their supreme pizza and bbq chicken. Both were fairly good, with above average quality toppings but a sadly average crust. Overall, this is definitely better than your average mega chain pizza place. 

PS: they have a special every month: on the night of a full moon, all large pizzas are $12."}
{"text":"we ordered a take out from Wolfman. we had their fanous Bella Lugosi, pizza with thing crust and veggies. the pizza was awesome, crispy, tasty veggies, not greasy. Well done!"}
{"text":"This Wolfman location was my first, hopefully of many, visits to the small chain. I'm so accustomed to the pizza/bar setup with good food, kitschy interior, massive TVs with ESPN streaming and an overt amount of sprinting youths. This location feels more like a quick service pizza joint with service at the tables, draught beer, and an open kitchen. 

Made it in for a late Sunday lunch and had a great time. Cozy booths line the wall, big cushy stools at the bar, and fun decor abounds. We grabbed a big booth for the two of us. The menu is printed like a newspaper and makes for a memorable read-through. Tons of sandwiches, pastas, pizzas, and all of the usual suspects for apps. We started with some \"Styx.\" Breadsticks with sundried tomato pesto, marinara, and creamy artichoke dip. All dips were spot on, the sticks were seasoned heavily, but balanced, and they certainly didn't last long. 6 comes in an order and is a perfect serving for two. 

Our server was very gracious with our vegan order, too. We ordered the veggie pizza with no cheese and also a buffalo chicken....with no chicken or the typical cheeses. Nothing of note for the meat-eater/dairy-lover, but was rather fulfilling for us. It's rather pleasant to visit a restaurant that doesn't balk at a diet-specific order and is rather generous with the time and consideration. Very humbling. The crust is fantastic and I'd imagine is equally notable for other pies. 

Prices are fair and definitely worth their weight. I'm looking forward to visiting this location or one of the others around town soon. Cheers, Wolfman!"}
{"text":"Cool little pizza place. The food was yummy and the service was excellent. We got the Stix app with pimento cheese, marinara and pesto. We also got the personal pepperoni pizza and the personal buffalo chicken pizza. The pepperoni pizza was loaded with pepperoni. The Buffalo chicken pizza was really good but very very spicey. I love buffalo and spicy things don't normally bother me but this was hot. So hot that your mouth burns for a solid 20 minutes after eating.

The food was really fresh. Relatively fast considering its all made.  To order. Neat atmosphere. The parking lot was difficult to find a space in though."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love Wolfman Pizza. I'm quite surprised it does not have 5 stars.  This our go-to for pizza. Our favorites are the Veg-o-matic and New York, New York. The pizza is always delicious and fresh."}
{"text":"I visited Wolfman Pizza for the first time yesterday to pick up a pizza I ordered online. I was acknowledged as soon as I walked in, and the overall service was quick and effortless. We ordered a pepperoni pizza with mushrooms on half. After a short 5-10 minute ride home, the pizza was incredibly greasy making the crust soggy. I wish it has less pepperoni. Literally, the entire top was covered. After putting the pizza in the over to crisp the soggy crust, it did taste okay, but so so greasy. The beer specials looked great, and maybe eating in provides a higher quality pie, but I don't think i'll be back for pizza. $3 beers are worth it, though."}
{"text":"Last night by a (nearly) full moon, we decided to sink our teeth into some Wolfman Pizza, and I'm glad we did. The menu was inventive, the service uber-friendly, and the experience made all the more poignant given the Dominos two doors down. 

- We had the Blue Moo (which was on monthly special) and it would have been worth it even if not. 
- The place has a cool look and vibe.
- The service (as stated) was very welcoming and friendly.

Overall, the crust is a little thicker than I normally choose, but the originality made up for that."}
{"text":"Very Good Pizza with POOR Dessert options!  Brand New or Newly Remodeled!   

Since I do not Read Menus well they gave me a \"Silver Bulletine\"  Newspaper about Happenings with Warewoofs!  If you are a Warewoof someone is hunting you and I would watch it!  OK this was mostly a Menu which was harder to understand than the other kind and maybe I'm not real good at reading anythinj other than Pictures and some GREAT Reviews on yelp, the ones written by Friends (someones Friends, right).  You KNOW I LOVE YOU!!!

Who ever though of \"Build Your Own\" must have known someone like me... Except I usually have CHEESE, Tomato Sauce and Crust... If a plain Cheese Pizza is Good, then......  Since I have eaten this Pizza in other places I knew it was good...

Fresh Basil (turned out Crunchy, still very Good) Red Onion, Sausage, Normal Pizza Sauce (just like I remember and Very Good)... Until last night It has been years since I have had a PIE for the Woofman.

Dessert...Hummmm, How do I word this?  S'mores Pizza... Before I say Two and a Half yelp stars, I'll call it a Poor Dessert to Bare the name S'mores!!!  NOTE to the Owners***  On this Dessert and on your Dessert one person is saying right here...\"Go back to the Drawing Board\" or, OR Ignore me... I'll still eat your Pizza and go somewhere else for Dessert!  I'm NOT mad... This is a NOTE to help YOU! Woof!  I'll go somewhere and learn to use spellject!

Appetizers? Hummm... Last Night I was HUNGRY and really wanted something, Appetizer or two before the Pizza... Instead of making a second note to the owners, I'll ask someone else to make some CREATIVE and Delicius Pre-Meal options, ideas so the Woofman can eat the competition, not that he could not anyway (being a Woof)... Pretzels come to mind!  Thinly Sliced ONION Rings like the Cow Fish Onion Straws.... Something from a Great Horror Movie or an Idea for the Next Horror Movie to come out in the Spring!  Woof... these are the clues: \"Hot\" Sweet Potato Chips (NOT reheated - Made-to-order) or Zoo-kini (Zucchini) Chips (like at Nolen Kitchen) or how about Bacon Wrapped, Sausage Stuffed Jalapenos with Bacon Marmalade Dipping Sauce!!!

Very Good Service!  Most of the Servers are VERY Good with Children...They took GREAT Care of me!!! 

No Way this is a Sports Bar, right? ? ?  Place looks GREAT...Like Chucky Cheese for Adults with a lot of kids too!  Warewoofs photos aretalt over this placet... Serious about the Woofs!  Warhol or Warholesk Woofman Art!  I LIKE it A lot!

Ricciocho ask me to catch a Coyote pup so he could \"Raise it as a Dog\"... I told him \"It does NOT work that way\"!"}
{"text":"Best pizza I've ever had!! Hand down! NY has nothing on this place. Excellent pizza made in very creative manner. They make me like food combinations and pizzas I never liked!! Service is great. Had Blue moo, Maui (several times), BBQ chick and a few more."}
{"text":"i order from them sometimes. the food is great salads pizza and chicken wings. the price is a bit higher than other places but it is worth it."}
{"text":"I am a total Wolfman Pizza fan!  Great ingredients, pizza is always fresh tasting, the Styx are delish!  Nothing crazy there except that they give you 3 different dipping sauces, which makes these Styx the best!

My 6'4\" BF and I usually share a medium pizza and an app of some kind and it is always a good amount of food without feeling too stuffed.  The New York is yummy, and the Big Bad Wolf is my fav.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is easily my favorite pizza place in Charlotte. The BBQ chicken pizza is hands down the best that I've ever had. Nothing that I've ever had from Wolfman has been bad. My parents visited and we ordered from here and they loved it just as well."}
{"text":"My first visit here. Place is happening with good amount of crowd. Tried veggie pizza - tastes good.. No complaints .. But pizza would have more tastier as I tried many local pizzas and tastes better than this.

Careful with the funny sign"}
{"text":"They have such a great selection of pizzas to choose from, which from what I have tried, all taste amazing!  They also have a great dining ambience with a great selection of beer to match!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Super low key and great atmosphere. Almost didn't want to leave a review so people wouldn't know about it . It's a well kept secret! Delicious pizza and the spaghetti & meatballs are great too!"}
{"text":"This place was low key. I ate pretty good. The waitress I had was pretty dope. Being the only African American in the joint, they made me feel at home. I appreciate the hospitality. The wings were straight up bussin!! I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"GREAT pizza!! Nice beer selection too. Also got a meatball sub. Found my new pizza joint!!"}
{"text":"The food is fine but when I called to put in a takeout order they were rude and didn't even apologize for the wait on the phone. And then one person took my order and wasn't very friendly."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza! Me and my boyfriend both loved the crust! I was obsessed with my Bella pizza, the veggies were fresh and delicious! The cheese was a creamy incredible blend! My boyfriends five meat was loaded with his fav meats! Great options for the vegetarians and the meat eaters!"}
{"text":"How have I not reviewed this place yet!? I used to live around the corner from here and it was our go-to place for \"I don't feel like cooking tonight\". For eat-in or take-out, this place is still one of my favorites for personal pizza.

As a vegetarian, my two favorites are the Bella (Lugosi) and the Veg-o-matic. The Bella has an Alfredo base rather than a red sauce and is so creamy and comforting... a mild flavor, but a great go-to. The veggie is nice if you're looking for a bit more punch in your pizza. It has a traditional red sauce and banana peppers. I've also had all of the other veggie pizzas and honestly, they are all good.

The service is great and the place has a small home-town restaurant vibe to it. There are probably about 4-5 booths and 4-5 tables so the staff is always nearby to refill your water or get you another beer. They also started recognizing us after we'd been a few times haha.

The beer menu is small but local, with usually 5-6 beers on tap at any given time. Some local staples and some more adventurous options are available. Plus, if you go on a Tuesday, they have $3 drafts!"}
{"text":"Terrible pizza. Smells and tastes like dominos. Not worth the money. The bread is the worst part."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza, relaxed and friendly vibe, great beer selection. If you haven't tried Wolfman yet, you owe it to yourself to give it a go!"}
{"text":"How have I not written a review for this place yet? It is my favorite pizza place in Charlotte! 

They have amazing flavors, amazing pizza, everything cooked to perfection. 

They even have one of my favorite beer on tap! (OMB Hornets Nest)"}
{"text":"The \"Big Bad Wolf\" pizza is so good we got it again and again. Never had a pizza here we didn't like but the side salads definitely leave something to be desired (a whole mini carrot- no good)."}
{"text":"Had a better experience here for date night with the hubs. The pizza was delicious and the service was good. But the hostess area is pretty confusing. Came in and no one greeted us. Didn't know if we had to wait and put our name on the list or what but there were several others waiting. I finally gave them our name and saw there were 3 other groups ahead of us. Since it was just me and my husband, they told us they had a two top ready for us. I saw on the list that a group ahead of us was also a party of 2. I asked them if that party shouldn't have it first and they were super confused. That party of 2 ended up taking it but if it wasn't for me, we would of gotten sat before them which wouldn't of been fair. Other that that the food was good."}
{"text":"Love this place! GREAT salads, always come in a chilled bowl with plenty of toppings and dressing made in house. I have never dealt with an unpleasant staff member and their pick up orders are quick and hot when you receive them."}
{"text":"The food and service were both excellent.  We had the Chickenstein pizza and got half chicken and half shrimp as toppings.  The sauce was really good and it was a nice way to \"think out of the box\" so to speak with pizza.  The only thing missing for this dining experience were TV sets and a better bar selection.  Having a variety of alcohol available and TV sets on would make Wolfman a real go-to place for having food and fun.  The staff members were friendly and gave top-notch service.  Giving them more fun options available with the bar and TV viewing would really help them shine."}
{"text":"We were so excited to find that Wolfman had reopened so close to us.  We used to frequent the old location on Providence and were so sad when they closed up shop there. The food is so good, the menu is unique but also has the typical staples that you want when visiting a pizza place. Service is always spot on at all Wolfman locations we have been to. 

On a mom note- they have high chairs available with straps that are not broken! They have a kids menu (pizza, panini or pasta options) but at 5.99 we choose to share with our two year old rather than to get him his own plate.  The servers were friendly with our kiddo but could work on making sure they don't put hot plates or full drinks within his arms reach.  

We will definitely be back again and again!!"}
{"text":"Visiting the area from CA...called in order togo to take back to my room. Get there and apparently they gave someone else my order..wth?! Had to wait another 20 minutes while we had ice creAm melting in the car..so fun. Pizza was aight but that just pissed me off.  Guy did say well they'll probably come back for right order and i could get another pizza for free. Like seriously i don't even know what the other person may have done with it....so guy came back to get his right order and got my pizza for free"}
{"text":"Wolfman Pizza is one of those underrated spots in a not-really neighborhood that just cranks out consistent, quality pizza. The Lady and I used to live right next to here and every time we find ourselves back around our stomping grounds, gosh darn it I can't resist the allure of the Wolf. 

If you've never stopped by here, the whole place is werewolf themed. You'd be surprised at just how many werewolf movies there are. You sit down and the menus are these newspaper-esque folds where the story on the front is a satirical story about werewolf, you open the menu and most menu items are wolf themed... they do a great job of theming. All themes aside, I wouldn't give this place 5 stars if it weren't for the food. My personal favorites are the Thai Chicken Pizza and the BBQ Chicken, but sometimes I stray.. like this last time, I got the Big Bad Wolf. Point is, you can't go wrong here. Sometimes The Lady and I order their breadsticks with dipping sauces (don't miss out on the cheesy artichoke dip or the sundried tomato pesto). And I don't think I've ever had a bad or even sub-par experience here! Wolfmans will ALWAYS have a special place in my heart and stomach. And fridge. 

As a closer, another draw is the small array of local beers - they have specials on Tuesdays where any draft is $3. Where else can you get that?!?"}
{"text":"First when I went to order a meatball hero, I was told they dont do those. The young lady seemed off a bit. So I explained they did have them and call them a hoagie. She said it soul be a 15 minute wait, no problem but when I was signing the sarge she seemed put off. Had I tipped I woudl have put in a few dollars from my bag. So I waited and when I got home the cheese was not even melted. What was the 15 minute wait for. The tase was not that good for 20.00.. Was just a bit disappointed  with the whole experience, the sauce, the staff. The place looks nice though."}
{"text":"Got pizza delivered, perfect portion size for one. They have a ton of vegetarian options, which is great for me!"}
{"text":"Their pizza is the best in Charlotte, but for whatever reason, they can't find the magic of royalty.  I wish I knew what they could do to be super successful because their pizza is awesome."}
{"text":"I really like the changes and new location within the shopping center. Seriously delicious pizzas and good service. Much smaller space than the original, but I like that it's not so \"sports bar\" oriented. A few booths, some bar seating, and a more modern interior. When we went, it had only been open a few days, so they were working out some kinks. I hope that the patrons of the previous location flock back in. 

Back when I was eating meat, I remember loving the Cheeseburger Cheeseburger pizza. So good. The salads are also top notch. I saw a couple of local beers on draught...always something I appreciate.

All in all, for good pizza and a pleasant atmosphere, this place wins. I hope they do well in the new space!"}
{"text":"So far this is my favorite pizza in the Charlotte area. The New York, New York was delicious as was the Buffalo Chicken pizza (surprisingly). The sauces were on point (not sweet like some places) and the dough had great flavor and texture.

PS. Just confirmed that everything is made in-house from the dough to the sauces to the toppings. Bonus points!"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza. I recommend the Styx with the dips.  I wish they would go back to having beer specials, but it is nice that they have all local beers on tap for $4.50 when the rest of the city charges more. 

Very happy otherwise and the staff was excellent"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite pizza spot in South Charlotte, and for sure the best restaurant in Quail Corners Shopping Center. They use fresh ingredients and make outstanding tasting pizza (including the dough). The service is top notch and always welcoming. The seating and bar are really comfy with cool werewolf themed decorations. I highly recommend their salads as well."}
{"text":"Been here a bunch of times at this point. Food is fantastic. Only bummer is dessert menu stinks."}
