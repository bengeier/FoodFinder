{"text":"I like the appetizer rolls with lettuce and pork. It's definitely meant for sharing as the 2 rolls are cut into 8 pieces but can also be eaten as a meal. I also like to order the bun  (vermicelli) with spring rolls and Vietnamese sausage. For the quality and the price, I think it's good value."}
{"text":"Had an awesome Hue Style Beef Noodle soup (114) coupled with Spring Rolls, best in town, highly recommend to try these out. Atmosphere of the restaurant is very cozy, the owner is so friendly and even remembers my tasting preference. Overall two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"So disgusting, my fried rice smelled so funky and tasted as bad as it smelled. I wish i could have voted zero but apparently you have to give them at least one."}
{"text":"After ordering delivery from all over Scarborough I would say this place is pretty good. I ordered special beef noodle soup and grilled beef wrap."}
{"text":"Not sure about the mixed reviews. This place is not bad. We come here on occasion to celebrate. I like their Vietnamese and Thai dishes. Specifically, we like their Pho, Thai and Lemon Grass-based dishes. The  place is small but decent. Never had problems with parking."}
{"text":"Today I ate meat wrap with pork . It was very delicious 
Service was good.I enjoyed the place. I will definitely come back"}
{"text":"Whenever I want something different from Pho I usually come here. Don't get me wrong...They still have the Pho noodle soup with beef and such, but it seems there is a bit of a difference here. The variety is pretty good. I have tried many of their dishes. The steam cheung fun style which is not bad. Their simple rice dish or vermicelli with 3 items...

Their shake is usually pretty nice and thick...I usually ordered the 'Sweet & Sour Vermicelli with crab soup'. This is good! But now I notice they don't have real crab, instead use imitation crab. Their broth for this is nice with the vermicelli noodles which is a little different in texture as well.

Food is a bit above standard. Service is usually okay. Price is standard. Ambience is simple. Max seat capacity is probably 30 at most..."}
{"text":"I like how they use authentic noodles. Soup base is great for pho. Very clean. Love their pad Thai. But they've been very inconsistent. The last time I went, it was pretty dry and I needed to add condiments"}
{"text":"Nice small restaurant, lots of different menu choices from the standard Vietnamese cuisines."}
{"text":"yummm pad thai
great food, great service, relatively cheap for the quality of the food you're getting. it can get expensive if you want to try all the things they have to offer. Best to go in a group to split the cost and not waste food because its a sizable serving."}
{"text":"My workmate and I needed to grab a quick lunch so we decided with a bowl of pho.  The restaurant was small, Chinese owned as the waiters didn't speak a word of Vietnamese.  The pho was a little more costly than most typical Vietnamese restaurants I've been to.  It was still cheap in comparison to other foods.  The pho wasn't bad, the broth can be better.  It was one of the few restaurants that used fresh rice vermicelli noodles instead of the dry noodles.  The waiter gave us bean sprouts but not the fresh Thai basil until we asked for it.  Even so, they gave us one small branch with 5 leaves.  They were a bit stingy in that regard.  I personally wouldn't go back.  Two stars was a generous rating."}
{"text":"Tried pho here, but it's not that good as broth tends to be bland.   Spring roll is also a bit disappointing and it was a bit cold when I had it.  The positive thing is they don't use dry vermicelli instead they use more quality rice noodle, and the service is quite friendly and pleasant.  In term of authenticity, it is better than many other Scarborough pho places.  I will give an overall experience of 2.5."}
{"text":"I visited the place 1 time. Not happy. I had Chicken Pho Soup. I never receive any bean sprouts, mint leaves/thai basil, lime/lemon, chili pepper. I mention that after I paid, but the old guy argued with me, witch was a big mistake. Old wise man, if you treat like that a first timer, too bad, you will loose customers. Trying to cheat a connoisseur is an evidence of your low level mentality.
I tipped, and I left for good.
Pro: The tea have a very nice flavor, unique.

Family business, but all the family needs better education and good manners."}
{"text":"There is so many pho restaurant in Scarborough area, but nothing is good. Pho originally is from Vietnam. However, these Pho restaurants in these area own by Chinese...The way they make it is so different.
The only place that I like to go is Green Bamboo. The owners are Vietnamese. They are very friendly. I used to go there at least 2 times a week.
 The restaurant is little small but it's nice and cozy. I like the bun thit nuong and banh dap there....so yummy....The way they marinated the meat....
I moved far from there now but still drop by whenever I have a chance.....
If you are in the area, definitely get to check it out...."}
{"text":"I came here after a long absence and did not realize this place no longer has Vietnamese noodles or cuisine. It mainly serves casserole rice pots. My mom and I decided to give it a try. We ordered two. It takes a while for the casserole to cook. We ordered eel rice and lemon grass chicken rice. The eel rice casserole was good because there was a sauce. I still needed soy sauce. The lemon grass chicken was a disappointment. It didn't taste like much. Overall I would come back to try other things. Just note that the soy sauce is on the sweet side. There were regular who came in and they said they had no more soup. So basically everyone had to order the casserole rice."}
{"text":"Excellent pho! The deep fried calamari was the best I've ever had and the XL pho can feed 4 ppl easily. Great value for your money but the sever was a bit ditzy and it took forever to get the bill. Def will go back again and again."}
{"text":"Not bad... wasn't spectacular or anything, but great value for their lunch specials: $9 or less for pho (large)/rice/vermicelli, salad/bak choy and a spring roll! More than enough food to stuff  your face for less than $10!"}
{"text":"I was up in Scarborough with my family and everyone was craving some Pho.  I gave my trusty little YELP app a whirl and came up with some pretty good reviews of The Green Bamboo.  The restaurant is pretty small but cozy.  Very quick, friendly service.  The Pho is very tasty, with good portions of meat & noodles.  The deep fried spring rolls were good but the fresh ones were awesome, really tasty.  The calamari will definately be a repeater.  Overall, I would recommend this place and I will definately be back."}
{"text":"As of this writing my wife and I have visited Green Bamboo 2x now.  Since we're hungry it slips my mind at times to check in ^_^;   Now, Green Bamboo specializes primarily on Clay Pot Rice dishes, they offer 36 different clay pot rice options.  In my opinion, from all the clay pot rice restos we have visited this is at the top of our list for getting it \"right\" the rice at the bottom is super crispy but not burnt.  We tried the clay pot rice at Kenny's Noodles and those didn't come close to the crispiness of the rice from Green Bamboo.  To date we have tried dishes : #05 Black Beans spare rib rice, #12 Dry shrimp and mince pork rice, #21 chinese sausage and preserved meat rice & #23 preserved pork belly rice.  Wife and I enjoyed those 4, but for use #23 & #05 so far are the ones that shine for us.  We plan to go back to try other dishes.  Their value of portion size to money spent is good 4/5 for the clay pot rice.  Their soup value however is much less.

Please note : you should really be fan of the crispy rice.  I recommended a friend to Green Bamboo and they didn't enjoy their experience due to the crispy rice was too crispy for their tastes.  They prefer the level of crispiness of rice from Kenny's Noodles.

Happy eating!"}
{"text":"The best Bun Rieu in Scarborough!!!

I've been there many times but I always order Bun Rieu, this noodle with the tomato brooth, crab and eggs always hit the spot during the winter months.  

my kids seems to like the Pho too."}
{"text":"Came here many years ago with family and decided to go back again when we visited. Sadly the owners changed and the food was not as good as I remembered. All my cousins ordered Pho and I ordered the curry because I remembered that it was phenomenal the last time I was here. but this time the curry just wasnt as good as I remembered. Overall it was ok. but I think I'll try another viet place when I go back to canada."}
{"text":"This is place is like a hole in wall.  Even though it's street view, the place itself looks dingy and well not that attractive.  Having said that the place has great eats!

Now I am the type of person who loves to try everything, the funny thing is every time I go there I eat the same thing over and over again.  I guess because of the freshness of it and I don't want change that.  My friends who also have tried it have loved it.

I think my brother and his wife have absolutely fallen in love with the place.  

The bad thing about the place really is that it is limited seating.  So get there before 12:00pm and you'll have a spot to enjoy your vermicelli with grilled chicken and grilled beef...top that off with a spring roll.  You have to love its value!"}
{"text":"The sad demise of a wonderful restaurant. Today we went to Green Bamboo for lunch. It's been a year since we went there last. We were a regular at this place. The place is no longer what it used to be. It is not Vietnamese cuisine anymore, it is just plain Chinese Casserole Rice. The casseroles that we ordered were Pork Belly and Duck. The appetizers crispy quail and tempura shrimp were nice. The casseroles were bland and the accompanying stew which we paid a $2 add on fee was like mushroom and beef water. 

The owner is still the same wonderful and bubbly lady. I'm unsure about her decision and the circumstances under which she made this decision. I wish her luck, but I feel badly that we now miss out on the old Green Bamboo, which was awesome."}
{"text":"Like another reviewer, this is my usual pho joint... for Sunday afternoons.  This is the only pho place that I've found with all my favourite beef parts in one bowl without having to ask for it custom made.  The portions in a large are hefty for me and the soup is very nice.  The noodles could be overcooked once in a while, but I find that doesn't detract too much from the overall experience of a well made beef noodle soup.

Another must try if you are eating in a group is the Grilled Meat Wraps listed under Light Lunches (Meals?).  There's a choice of 4 meats to go with shrimp crackers, basil and lettuce all wrapped up in a rice flour wrap.  I find the wrap itself a bit thick, but otherwise, the whole combination is very tasty. Heck, have it all yourself if you're super hungry!  The avocado shakes here could use a bit more avocado, but the thickness and light sweetness is the right consistency.

This place is clean, a bit small and the service is very quick."}
{"text":"very warm and friendly authentic chinese restaurant. comfort food style rice dishes with generous servings. although they changed their menu, i prefer the casserole rice to their old menu. been here twice already and would recommend!"}
{"text":"I eat pho on a weekly basis and to be honest ive never had worse. I dont really have much to say except dont bother."}
{"text":"This mom and pop shop is definitely a hidden gem. The clay pot rice is absolutely addictive. We ordered preserved meat rice and black bean minced pork rice. Unfortunately when the orders came..They made salted fish with mince pork.. as much as we don't want to waste food .. we had to return it because of the salted fish. The owner apologized and gave us a plate of yu choy while we waited for them to remake the rice. Brownie points for the gesture!

Both of the rice were very home style, the rice is flavoured by the juicy sausage and meats. It is even more bomb when you eat with the sweet soy sauce. They also did a very good job with making the rice crust. It is crispy but not burnt. I can't wait to come back and try other flavours!  I would highly recommend to bo jai fan lovers!"}
{"text":"I usually order the pho with beef balls, tripe and tendon. I once ordered the thai style pho which was very good. It had good flavour. Their menu now looks more organized than before. It's a quiet place and it's not usually very busy. It's a nice cozy environment. In general their food quality is good and flavours are nice. I gave it only three stars because at other pho restaurants that I've been to, the food just tasted better and there was more meat slices and tripe and tendon. Portion sizes though are decent and the service is pretty fast when it's not busy. The owners and the other workers there are friendly people as well."}
{"text":"Good spot for lunch and very affordable.  Pho broth is almost as good as my mom's broth."}
{"text":"Restaurant has changed hands, and no longer Viet. Now Chinese  specializing in clay pot food. Did not stay to try it. If you are looking for Viet, look elsewhere."}
{"text":"The first time I ordered for delivery, they gave me a small pho when I ordered a large and insisted they gave a large. 

The lady then told me I could come in and exchange for a large if I wanted to. 

No, I don't want to. Why else did I order delivery if I wanted to come and pick it up. 

I ordered again today. Silly me. I followed up on my order an hour after placing it. The same lady tells me the food is ready but they're very busy and asked if I can pick it up instead. An hour later... Didn't even have the courtesy to let me know ahead of time. 

No, I don't want to. Why else did I order delivery if I wanted to come and pick it up. 


I refuse to make a third mistake on a hungry Sunday afternoon."}
{"text":"Phor tonight, I went to Green Bamboo Phor Pho so I can Pheel Phull and Phall asleep Pheeling satisfied...  

#100 XL Special Pho($9.95) took me just under 20-minutes to consume but in a sense I didn't really consider this XL, which I will explain below.  I asked the older gentleman how large is an XL and he went to the back.  He brought out  eXtra Large on his right and Large on his left.  That's what I call good service.   :D

Let me do this in a familiar format(Pro versus Con) for everyone.

Pro:

-Fresh Noodles
-Quality Beef

Con:

-Missing Red Chili(weak) !
-Missing Basil(are you serious) !!
-Not enough Tendon(I need my Meats) !!! 
-Staff smiling(Probably thought me FUNNY eating XL)

I asked him if they had Lunch Specials and he told me it ended at 5 pm.  He said there's not much Profit Margin since those are such a good deal and might consider discontinuing it."}
{"text":"Horrific wait times when it comes to food waiting 30 minutes for just two pad thai's 

Worst service I have ever experience as well"}
{"text":"good quiet place, they got free wifi. viet noodle is good. good to try. Have been there for 2 times so far.  Satay is not good, but other than that, its good."}
{"text":"This little spot with poor circulation smells like strong fish sauce right upon entry, I should have turned around and walked out at this point. Ordered, found a hair in my food, didn't even bother to say anything - was not interested in ordering another dish. Stopped eating, politely paid my bill and left, to never return. Don't bother, there is nothing about this place that makes it worth a visit."}
{"text":"I can't believe how many times I've passed by the area, not giving this a second look, what with the array of cuisines offered in and around the block. 

It was very busy on a Saturday evening, the crowd being mostly young and obviously very hungry. Their pho bowls and portions in general are enormous!

We ordered the Ginger Chicken and the Basil Curry Chicken, both came with Vermicelli as well as a Sour Sop milkshake. I'd kill for Sour Sop. The Ginger Chicken was song worthy. The flavour was fantastically concentrated and very, very fresh. I was not as excited about the Basil Curry, but it was still very good. It was made with Coconut Milk and I find it a little too heavy for my taste. 

All in all I was satiated, intrigued and I will definitely be back for more. I'm sure their cute, tiny chef will get sick of making Ginger Chicken."}
{"text":"Food here is really really fresh. The only issue I have with this place is that they bring out the main course then bring out the appetizers and spring rolls. Who does that? Come on. I got their lunch special for $7.95 which gave me some vermicelli, lemon grass beef and vietnamese sausage. I wasn't too sure about it but it was actually very delicious after adding some Srirachia. This special came with spring rolls which came out after I got the dish. I also got a soft shell crab appetizer with my cousin which came out after the spring rolls did. The soft shell crab was pretty fresh but I didn't really like the batter and the sweet and sour dipping sauce that it came with. My cousin got another lunch special and the total tab came out to a little over $30."}
{"text":"Ordered two vermicelli bun. They were closing at 10 and we got in at 9 20. They still let us in and got a good meal. It was nice to have proper bun. I was in Korea for a while and they do their viet bun with red pepper paste like bibimbap. So this was a nice reminder of what I was missing. The food was made fast and good. And the old lady there was nice and came over to make sure we got what we wanted and everything was to our liking. Had one bun with steamed egg loaf and grilled lemongrass pork chop and the other with viet sausage and spring rolls."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: cozy, small, modern place for pho
Price: 7.00-12.00 average for Vietnamese 
Food: 
1. Fried calamari- one of the best place, it's crispy and spicy dipped in thai sauce , portions are good! 
2. Pad Thai - awesome, perfect mix of sweet and sour, noodles are perfectly done
3. Sweet and sour soup: perfectly authentic, I always find myself craving for this. Comes in either shrimp or fish. Mixed with lots of veggies
4. Pork grilled vermicelli- they marinate is honestly the best in Toronto, perfectly grilled, this is also one of the most popular dish 
5. Bun Bo hue- I've had better, not as popu

Overall: my go to Vietnamese restaurant in Scarborough. Although they switched from the old owners, they've still been able to keep most of the dishes the same. Nothing but compliments about them"}
{"text":"Delivery order through justeat.ca
Usually go with Thai One on and what a mistake I made this time! I put my order in at 5:45pm and it did not arrive until almost 2 hours later! I called the restaurant twice and both times the lady on the phone kept saying \"ok, ok you are number 1\" and attempting to blame my order because \"it was too big\" (i ordered fresh rolls, tofu and rice! not even a main dish!) Also she kept saying \"okay I cancel your order\" and then she hung up on me. What a hassle. 
When the driver finally got here, he did not give me a receipt. He just handed me the bags and said \"i don't speak english\" and walked away. The food was totally stone cold (obviously because it took so long). The fried tofu was soggy and the rolls were hard. NEVER AGAIN! 

I tried posting this review on my justeat account but they do not allow written comments I think. I wonder why?! 

All i wanted was some good fresh rolls :( which were HORRIBLE - very tiny and only meat, noodles and romaine lettuce!"}

I like the rice is crispy but not burnt in the bottom! It requires quiet skills to make rice that perfect! I highly recommend this place! It is located in an old plaza and the restaurant seems old. But if you are in mood for some authentic clay pot rice, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"They updated their menu, it is formatted much better.  It had a family run business feel, but unfortunately they seemed to lack service etiquette.  My boyfriend and I went there for lunch, but only I ordered as he was not hungry.  The lady asked him if he wasn't ordering in a very impolite tone and gave him a rude stare.  

Could've been better.  Despite there being about 5 ladies standing around and no other customers, they didn't notice when I was raising my hand and also did not come around unless I waved my hand around for about a minute or two.  Very lacking in service.

The pho was also really salty and overpriced, there are better pho places in the area"}
{"text":"The menu has changed since the last time we were here.  The food we ordered last time no longer appear on the menu.  This time we ordered Preserved eel rice, curry chicken, Vietnamese black coffee.

The food was still excellent though and staff are polite.  I'm not sure why they changed the menu but if you're looking for pho or other traditional Vietnamese dishes this is not the place to be."}
{"text":"This was our second visit to the restaurant and this time I thought I'd write a review.  We strolled in for a late Sunday lunch and the restaurant was empty.  From what we remembered, the food was a ok and this time, the experience was the same.  

Hubby ordered a medium special pho and I ordered a bun bo hue.  Surprisingly, my bun bo hue came out first which is unusual as it takes longer to make this dish.  It was piping hot but the meat (especially the shank) was too chewy from not enough cooking time.  My husband's pho arrived lukewarm which is less than ideal.  The portions were large and the flavours were ok, at par with most pho joints.  

I would not go out of my way to eat here for my pho cravings but it's still a decent choice if you're in the neighborhood craving pho."}
{"text":"Got the Combo A which comes with a large bowl or of noodles with rare beef, beef balls, tripe and tendon. A spring roll was included with a small salad for $8.50. Overall food was good but definitely had better at Pho 88 and Pho Dau Bo."}
{"text":"yum yum!

FOOD
We had the calamari, spring rolls and pho (special) and it was so tasty.  The deep fried calamari was so fresh and had the right zing of spice. The spring rolls were ok. Nothing to rave about.

The XL Pho was humongous! We ordered one and shared it with 4 ppl! They put a generous amount of meat in it and lots of noodles. 

I'm not a fan of the broth though. It was practically tasteless and I wish they gave more basil.

They didn't have a separate dish where you could put your sauce for your pho in so I had to use a spoon which was a bit difficult b/c the spoon was so small.

COST
standard

CLEANLINESS
it was clean! and had a nice feel inside. It actually got a bit warm though during our dinner that all of us were getting too hot that we had to take off layers of clothing. And no it wasn't b/c we were eating."}
{"text":"Went here for a late lunch and it seemed to be run by a viet/chin family....service was slow as we waited at least 7 mins for them to bring us our menu....in addition I suggest u do not put expensive items like ur phone on the table cuz it was pretty nasty....got the bun with viet sausage and grilled beef, presentation of the food was pretty nice...portion sizes are aite...a lil pricy if u ask me compared to other pho places"}
{"text":"I came today with my Mom. It was quiet due to be the thanksgiving weekend. I've been here at least a half a dozen times before and always enjoyed the food. 

The service was good, they answered all our questions. 

We ordered the grilled lemongrass chicken with vermicelli. And #512 (steamed fish in red curry sauce wrapped in banana leaves). Both were delicious in my opinion. The fish curry had the right mix of heat from fresh red chillies and coconut flavor! 
The lemongrass chicken was also very good with a lighter flavor and feel. 

Our only complaint was that it was a bit cold in the restaurant but it's that time of year where most places haven't turned on the heat yet. 

We had a small serving left to take home with us as a snack later. 

Their wifi wasn't working but when I inquired they were kind enough to enter a different password in my phone (if I handed my phone over which I did)."}

You get pork spring rolls, a \"salad\", which is more like a small amount of lettuce and carrots and a few options such as beef pho. We enjoyed the meal itself and everything came out pretty quickly.

The only downside is this place is small. I can't imagine coming on the weekend. It must be pretty cramped."}
{"text":"I caught a cold yesterday and asked my boyfriend if we could grab some Pho. I generally like to go to Pho 88 in Bamburgh- but my boyfriend's family loves this place. Ive been here twice before and always left with a \"meh\"...

Tonight was no different.

Service:
The original table that they sat us at was very squished in between two other deuces. Since the rest of the tables in the restaurant weren't taken up, I suggested we moved, but they said we could only sit at the deuce directly in front of the door. Why didn't they just let us sit at the four-top? meh.. whatever.

So we were ready to order, and it literally took the girl 5 minutes to write down EACH of our orders. How hard is it to understand, \"Small, #101, Rare Beef\"? Maybe she didn't know English. meh.. whatever.

It was funny that the next three tables that walked in were served by a different server- to which she seemed to know EXACTLY what she was talking about when people placed their orders. Maybe they realized how stupid our server was.

Food:
Compared to other Pho places, the small is more of an xxs. I finished the entire bowl (which I usually have trouble with), un-satisfied. Doesn't Pho automatically come with the side of been sprouts and lime? I had to ask for mine. It was weird that she asked if i wanted them to be cooked or raw. Plus, after specifically asking for a lime, I was given a lemon. meh.. whatever. My boyfriend on the other hand ordered a Chicken Pad-Thai and it was pretty good.

Overall, you guessed it! 
\"meh...whatever\""}
{"text":"Not a fan - portion too small & overcharged for mediocre quality."}
{"text":"This small family own vietnamese restaurant is the best you can get within the Scarborough area. At least it is run by legitimate vietnamese family, most places are owned by Chinese who tosses noodle, beef and soup together and calls it Pho. 

It wasn't my first visit here, though I don't quite recall what their pho was like (this is why yelp is useful) This time, I tried their rice with chicken and steamed egg. I love their marination on chicken! It was cooked perfectly , the texture wasn't overly dry.  They also give you complimentary soup as well , though the soup I find kind of bland. But it's free, can't complain."}
{"text":"How can I not come for my Pho to my favourite vietnamese restaurant for Pho-bruary!!

Green Bamboo always delivery!!

Small ($5.95) is equal to a medium/large, Large ($6.95) is equal to an XL ($8.95) which I can never finish, and XL is something I won't even dare to order!

The noodles are always the fresh thin noodle never dried! 

The rare beef is the way it is served rare on top..and always tender and plentiful! (even for take out, they will wrap the rare beef separately so they will stay the way it is  when you eat at home!)

The broth always hot and tasty! So hot when I get take out I have to bring in plastic containers to hold the broth.. the soup will melt the styrofoam containers!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious clay pot rice!!! took the chinese sausage and chicken pot rice with a sspecial soup.

Rice was cooked perfectly with the perfect amount of water so the rice could be seperated and not too sticky. The crunchiness parts on the side of rice was great,so scrap it asap whenever you get the dish and mix it well all together. The chicken was boneless and very soft. Add on the sweet soya sauce to perfect this dish.

Lastly the price is incredibly cheap and the service was great from the girl!!

Must go if your in the neighborhood!!"}
{"text":"A great place for good authentic Pho. Ordered 1 Special beef and 1 Rare beef -- both were absolutely delicious. I recommend the Canh Chua soup (Vietnamese hot and sour tamarind soup) as something more cultural/ethnic to try that's not commonly available at typical Pho restaurants. LOVE and highly recommend the spiral spiral spring rolls as something anyone can enjoy. Overall, a great experience!"}
{"text":"Ordered Thai Rare Beef tom Yum soup (#102 $8.50) only this time I also ordered spring rolls ($4.50). HOWEVER, they gave me this grilled pork wrap (#50) which was delicious...but it's not worth $9.50. In total it came to $20 and change, bit pricey for a sickness remedy meal but I did take the rest of the soup, mint leaves home and got a free pot of tea."}
{"text":"Not sure why Yelp says \"the location has moved\" because it's the same menu, staff and prices. I always get the 102 thai rare beef in the tom yum soup; always hit the spot for less than $10 for the large (and i have a bowl set for lunch too!) the best part? The younger lady with glasses remembered my name! Now THAT'S privilage! I proniaed for my fourth visit I would try the coveted avocado milkshake because I'm always not feeling well when I visit yearly. See you in late spring!"}
{"text":"My Lunch special was:
 Lemongrass chicken and pork along with a spring role and bokchoy with rice noodle soup.
The soup is very uniquely flavorful, compared to other Pho joints that I tried, it seem to be very light and had a hit of  lemon grass flavor.  They gave a good helping of Chicken and Pork along with the meal..

The restaurant was small but clean and comfortable.  I will definitely try the food again."}
{"text":"Delicious clay pot rice with a plethora of choices. I love the \"edges\" of the rice that stick to the pot and they made it perfectly well. The clay pot rice dishes are made fresh and so you should expect a wait time of approximately 20 minutes for your food. There is also about 4-5 choices of soup which were very sweet. The vegetables were good but they weren't exceptionally fresh. The restaurant is quite small and very busy; loud and family style. You can tell it's a popular restaurant with tons of return customers. I also noticed that there were several take out orders. I would return for a quick clay pot rice dinner."}
