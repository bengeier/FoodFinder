{"text":"Service rapide et très agréable. Les portions pourraient être un peu plus généreuses et servies avec des sauces piquantes."}
{"text":"Patently the worst meal I have had in Montreal, except for that one time at St Hubert... The mac and cheese was passable at first, but as the grease accumulated in my mouth it got worse and worse. The chorizo starter was greasy, my Montrealais mac and cheese greasy, and my partner's sloppy joe was essentially flavourless, but for the overwhelming taste of grease. He couldn't pick it up with his hands, it was too greasy... He had a side of regular mac and cheese that was sitting in grease. Nice people though and a very cute barman..."}
{"text":"Nous avons dû quitter après une attente interminable, sans que personne ne vienne même nous voir pour expliquer la situation ou simplement remplir nos verres d'eau. C'est un sérieux problème de gestion! Il faut engager plus de gens et les conscientiser à ce que c'est un service efficace. Dommage!"}
{"text":"VERY good experience and food! The place was not crowded at all, but that may be due to construction outside that made the place hard to see from the street. The menu is  mostly mac and cheese, with some sandwiches. I had the mac and cheese with smoked meat, which was AWESOME! Giant portions for around $10. Wifey had the classic mac and cheese which she also enjoyed. The service was good, and prices perfect. If you're into macaroni and cheese, definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"The place is really chic and has amazing mac and cheese. I had their grilled cheese plate that comes with fries or salad and a mac and cheese. It was amazing !  The bar owner came to greet us and made jokes and was very nice. Definitely a place to go !"}
{"text":"S'il y a bien une chose que j'apprécie dans la vie c'est le fromage. Je ne pourrais pas devenir vegan pour cette raison en particulier... vous imaginez donc qu'un bar à fromage et à nouilles au coin de chez moi = une tuerie ?

Okay, alors la première fois que je suis allée je me suis roulé par terre jusqu'à ma porte d'entrée et j'ai converti un français au fromage canadien. Eh oui, les portions sont énormes et mon chum est difficile.. Faut le voir du bon côté, tu en as pour 2 repas ! La 2e fois que je suis allée, j'ai choisi un mac & cheese au homard. Oui oui, au Homard. Yuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuum.

C'était sincèrement un orgasme buccal entre la chair tendre et le coulis de fromage salé. À goûter absolument."}
{"text":"We had take-out and it was amazing!! Such creamy macaroni with rich flavor! The portion sizes are very generous and one order easily lasted us two meals. Will be going here again for sure!"}
{"text":"Great place just a few minute walk from my hotel! I visited on a Monday afternoon and was the only guest there at first. (Missed the lunch rush and the supper rush!!) The server was awesome. He made me a Mojito (with love, as he said ), and gave me time to figure out the menu. Which is all in French...fyi. But, I figured it out mostly and then used Google translate for the words I didn't know. 

The dish I ordered was fabulous! It had macaroni, cheese, and steak and bacon.  A great, large portion that made up for a missed lunch and held me over for the rest of the day. I finished it off with a cup of coffee to warm me up for the freezing walk back to my hotel. 

This was a nice place to find, and I'll try to come back on my next trip to this city!"}
{"text":"My two friends and I traveled to Montreal for the weekend and were absolutely starving after we arrived in the city later in the evening.  Our airbnb was close to Rue Ontario so we decided to look for a restaurant to eat in.  We happened to come across Le Macbar et Fromage by chance.

We were greeted promptly and with a welcome smile.  Our server was pleasant as were all the other staff in the restaurant.

I ordered the Bacon fumé au miel, my other friends ordered the sandwich végétarien andthe sandwich au steak respectively.  Our meals arrived pretty fast.  My dish was excellent!  Loved the taste and I especially liked that the meal was hot right until the last bite.  Both of my friends were very happy with the bread their sandwiches were served on.  My friend that ordered the steak said she probably wouldn't order the steak again but she was very happy with the rest of the meal including the bread the steak was served on as I mentioned above.

I would recommend this restaurant and would gladly return here if I had the opportunity."}
{"text":"Hummm un bon resto de burgers mais surtout de macaronis! Il y en a pour tous les goûts, plein de saveurs différentes, et ça vaut la peine de tester! C'est vraiment succulent et copieux!
Excellent service (sauf qu'il a fallu demandé de l'eau car sinon ils n'en apportent pas d'office), serveur souriant et disponible, prix corrects, carte de bières, vins et cocktails
Le décor est assez basique mais on n'y va pas pour le décor!!
A essayer!"}
{"text":"AFSGDFHBJC.
This is my favourite restaurant in Montreal. I love Mac and Cheese and it was so good here. So cheesy and warm. I am still dreaming about it. This is the mac and cheese that was missing from my life.
I came here for my anniversary with my boyfriend. He got the Brie Wild burger and he said it was 10/10. Flavourful and filling. Plus great value since he gets fries and mac and cheese as sides with the burger. 

The staff was very nice and the restaurant is very pretty. It has a nice cozy feel with the dimmed lights and the wood walls. They do have a tv in the middle of the room which I don't really understand because it doesn't seem to fit in if there is no sports game on.
They were playing the cooking channel and the cook was making jello dessert for the holidays  and it looked weird.

Aside from all that, you need to try this mac and cheese!!"}
{"text":"Deliciously cheesy and filling. Got take out once and legit died and went to heaven. Their portions are generous and the variety of the mac n cheeses is impressive (few options for vegetarians)."}
{"text":"This is exactly what we all need: a restaurant dedicated entirely to Mac and cheese. It's located in a fairly nondescript part of town, and by the time we got there (after 8:00) it was one of the only open places on the block. We really felt like VIPs. Our server was very attentive and kind, letting us sample a generous amount of wines to ensure we had our perfect pairing. I highly recommend the Lisboa Mac and cheese. The chorizo is more like kielbasa, but it's great nonetheless and adds the flavor missing from so many macaroni and cheeses. Try it with the Mexican Petite Sirah. Definitely a hidden gem in YUL!"}
{"text":"Short point form review here we go:

The restaurant looks clean and nice with an open kitchen. It was quiet on a Saturday evening, the place was almost empty. 

The service was very quick and the food arrived promptly. 

I had the pesto & tomato macaroni which was good but unfortunately was cold when it was brought to the table (so was my friend's plate).

The waitress was also rude so I don't really feel like repeating the experience. Maybe it was an off night but I don't think I'll be coming back to try this place again."}
{"text":"Waitress on the phone said they would be definitely open on Thanksgiving Monday 2016. I said thank you very much for letting me know, I will come by tomorrow. When I arrived there it was closed with a piece of paper on the door, saying they were not open for business for Thanksgiving. Great service."}
{"text":"We saw Costa on the morning news talking about his restaurant. We love mac and cheese, so decided to eat lunch there. When we arrived much to our delight there was Costa.  He treated us like family. We ordered the cheese burger mac and cheese, it was great and portions were large. Costa treated us to a special treat he had as a child. It was made with watermelon and was wonderful.
The restaurant was very clean and well kept. Stop by, you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Amaziiiiinnnnggggg place!!!! Everything is so damn good, the mac&cheese the grilled cheese ... totally a place to go when you're craving a good mac n cheese. Totally a place to go.


Una deliciaaaaa!!!!! Todo es tan delicioso, el Mac n cheese, el grilled cheese... todo todo es riquísimo, definitivamente el mejor lugar para ir cuando tienes antojos de Mac n cheese. Se lo remiendo de todas maneras."}
{"text":"Tried Macbar et Fromage one evening for a quick bite. their signature Mac & Cheese was excellent as well as their Le Boss and Sloppy Joe Grilled Cheese sandwiches and side salads. More food than we could eat and we were not disappointed in our choices. Staff were very helpful, especially Trisha who answered not only our questions about the menu but also helped us with figuring out getting about and around Montreal. We'll make another stop here or maybe try out the same owner Greek cafe next door before we leave Montreal."}
{"text":"Made to order mac & cheese - how can you go wrong! We were here for dinner and had some delicious food. Generous portions. We got the bacon with caramelized onions and the vegetarian. Both were excellent."}
{"text":"Disappointed after the place got 4 stars. Had the 3 cheese Mac & Cheese. Was too bland. It needed a kick, like a strong cheese. I added Tabasco and it made the dish.  My friend had the Phili Mac & Cheese and there was more onions and mushrooms than there was meat. She was not satisfied."}
{"text":"Great spot to eat! Wanted to go here for a while and finally did. Decided to get the fromage fromage fromage Mac and cheese. It tasted really good, hot, cheesy and filling. I also tried the Phillymac Mac and cheese and that was good too. The host/waitress was really nice and helpful. The owner was also nice and they both gave an excellent service. Overall this is a great spot and I have to come back to try more things."}
{"text":"The Macbar was a big surprise. My fiancé and I went on a weekend at 3 expecting it to be very crowded but we walked right in and got a table which was very appreciated. Our waiter was extremely kind and courteous, he asked us where we were from and how we liked Montreal and we chatted with him about his Sicilian roots. My fiancé got the classic Mac and cheese and I got the volcano Mac and cheese. Both were incredible. Some of the best Mac and cheese I've ever eaten. It has a very rustic and hip atmosphere. I would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Yummy mac and cheese! Mac and Cheese may be my favorite entree of all time. Macbar was delicious and gave a variety of different twist to their mac and cheese. It was a generous portion and the price was great too."}
{"text":"Si vous avez envie de macaronis et de cheddar, vous devez tester Macbar et Fromage !

Le bon point c'est que vous aurez également votre doggy bag du lendemain, car les portions sont très très généreuses (je pense sérieusement qu'il est juste techniquement impossible de manger une assiette entière de macaronis au fromage).

Pour ma part j'ai testé les macaronis au fromage avec des oignons et du bacon. Ça ressemblait un peu à une tartiflette sans reblochon avec des pâtes à la place des pommes de terre. Pas mal du tout ! Une amie a pris les macaronis aux champignons et cela semblait un peu fade à côté de mon plat. 

L'endroit est sympa et le personnel est agréable. En tout cas, vous en aurez pour votre argent !"}
{"text":"I finally got to try this place tonight, there wasn't a wait so that was a big plus on a Saturday night in Montreal. It had a nice laid back feel with high tables and a nice bar in the center. Judging from the name these guys specialized in Mac and cheese, so we took a few.

We took the smoked meat mac and cheese, with a honey bacon mac and cheese and a all meat lover mac and cheese with BBQ sauce drizzle. I also had he pleasure of trying there chèvre burger, a burger stuffed with goat cheese, and there beer batter fries.... these were very good!! Out of all the Mac and cheese my personal favourite was the BBQ drizzle meat lover, the mix of meat and sauce was delicious a perfect fit. The other Mac and cheese lacked a little salt in my opinion. The food was tasty but the problem here was they screwed up our order a few times brining plates back and fourth. Someone came to apologize but the wait for the food was way to long. I'm glad I finally go to try this joint."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a long time since I love anything to do with cheese and pasta!

We came on a Saturday around 2pm and the place was totally empty. I actually thought it was closed but there was a sign on the door to come through another entrance. This restaurant seems to share the same kitchen and space as a Greek restaurant.

The space is modern and clean, mix of high table chairs, bar stools and banquets. The menu offerings are perfect for what you would expect from a restaurant that specializes in mac and cheese. There are many choices along with burgers and sandwiches as well.

We got to try a philly mac and cheese, the 4 cheese macaroni and a burger- Everything was delicious and fairly priced.

The regular mac and cheese is very creamy and mild, I would have liked something with slightly sharper cheddar but it was still a treat and very decadent.

I would recommend this place for a quiet lunch if you happen to be in the neigborhood. If you are driving before of limited parking, and it is metered.

Next time we will try Poutineville which is by the same owners and right next door:)"}
{"text":"Restaurant de quartier qui vaut la peine d'essayer! Nous avons commandé les boulettes de viandes, les ailes de poulet, un mac & cheese (style cheeseburger et le cochon burger. Tout était très bon et le service impeccable. 

*Mention spéciale pour le hamburger qui est vraiment \"to die for\" ! :D

La raison pour laquelle je ne donne pas 5 étoiles est au niveau de l'ambiance. C'est un peu froid et ca manque de \"coziness\". Je pense que le resto gagnerait à travailler un peu là dessus."}
{"text":"Love this place! So annoyed that it is so far from me and that Montreal traffic and construction make getting here a nightmare! The mac & cheese was so good and I loved the presentation in the cast iron pan! The staff was very friendly and took care of us. the prices are great. The cocktails were fun and tasty! The room has tons of windows for nice light during the day, and I am sure there is great people watching when it is not -30Celcius! Cannot wait to return!"}
{"text":"If you love Mac N Cheese, then you should 100% try this place out. Food is really good, cheap and the portions are huge: what else can you ask for?  

I ordered a mac n cheese filled grilled cheese and it was immense and came with a side portion of baked mac n cheese too- wayyyy too big to finish alone. Bring a pasta lover there and they'll love you forever !"}
{"text":"Très bon service, amical, la nourriture était copieuse et excellente, et les prix très raisonnables, surtout vu les quantités généreuses. Nous étions 7, et tout le monde est reparti plein et content. On y retourne."}
{"text":"very reasonably priced mac + cheese/grilled cheese and generous portions! a great spot to go for the ultimate comfort food! the staff was great and totally accommodating! nice set up and enviroment and yummy"}
