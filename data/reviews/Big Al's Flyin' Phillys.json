{"text":"Everything on the menu is halal, except for the Cheez Whiz -- but that stuff is terrible anyway. The combo for two is pretty good: two sandwiches, fries, 10 wings, and two pops for $28 after taxes.

Al and his wife were extremely friendly, and wanted to make sure we were serviced. Went at around 6pm so it was dead.

Overall, great place!"}
{"text":"I was in the restaurant around 2:00PM, there weren't many guests but that was okay for us. We ordered the Notorious BBQ sandwiches (3) and a plate of 20 wings. Al recommended a custom sauce, zesty Thai and hot sauce. It was DELICIOUS! The only concern that I would have is that the prices are a little high, but not too much. Spliting the 20 wings, and getting the sandwich and drink for our selves cost me and my 2 friends over $15 each."}
{"text":"Good cheese steak, well cooked with the right amount of cheese, but undersized compared to the ones you get in Philly. The bun was a disappointment. Massively overpriced. 

Fries were pretty bad, the drinks in a can. Stick with the sandwiches if you're made of money."}
{"text":"First philly cheese steak experience! Forgot the name of the sandwich I ordered but it was the one with the fried egg! Cheesesteaks were made to order and the owner(?) brought it to my friends and I as soon as they were ready. Extra enjoyable since they were steaming hot and surprisingly didn't have that overwhelmingly heavy feeling you get when indulging in greasy food. I was quite pleased. Bonus pts also for really nice service from the couple (?) that was running the place that night. Made sure to get us napkins and took our trash for us which was really nice of them! Overall definitely a good place to stop by for lunch if you're in the area. We also tried the poutine, but it was pretty average. Stick to the cheese steaks. My feelings for this place may change though as I expand my horizons in the world of philly cheese steaks but for now I'm a fan of Big Al's =)."}
{"text":"Al makes a good cheesesteak.

The restaurant is large with lot's of seating, very unusual for the Kensington market area. They even have a nice patio in the front with additional seating.

It appears Al does all the cooking and his wife (I'm guessing) works the cash and cleans the tables. Both were very friendly and wanted to ensure we enjoyed our cheesesteaks. Nice people.

We went on a Friday during the lunch rush and it was busy. With just Al doing the cooking, it took some time to get our sandwiches. Probably about 20 minutes at least. After the lunch rush, things slowed down and orders were processed much quicker. I suggest timing your visit to arrive after the lunch / dinner rush.

Two things on the menu - cheesesteaks and wings (with fries as a side if you order a combo). Ask Al about his homemade sauce - good and tasty (also Spicy but not crazy spicy).

Sandwiches follow a hip hop theme. I had the Grand Master Crash which is just the basic \"Run BOC\" with Green peppers and Mushrooms. \"BOC\" is Beef, Onion and Cheese. 

Nice grill toasted bun and a good quantity of seasoned steak. They use the correct provolone cheese but also offer American or cheese whiz as a substitute. The sandwich is very filling - worth the $8 price tag. If your really hungry, get the double meat \"Big Pimpin\" at $12. 

I thought the fries were excellent, just the way I like them. Reminds me of home made Montreal fries.  

Give it a shot if your craving a cheesesteak...

{"text":"3 of us ate here this morning and it's coming out at both ends an hr later for all 3 of us!!!

Owner was quite nice but disappointing food. Not factoring the sickness."}
{"text":"Ordered the Big Pimpin' with Provolone, which is the standard cheesesteak with double beef, for $12. Wonderful service, plenty of seating.

The cheesesteak was excellent. Plenty of beef, of course, but what's great is that the bun is toasted, something the other cheesesteak places don't do. Onions were plentiful, and so was the provolone.

Of course, what you're probably interested in is whether this place is better than \"I Went to Philly\", the incumbent cheesesteak king of Toronto. Between \"I Went to Philly\" and Big Al, it's really down to personal preference. IWtP is like Pat's: finely chopped beef and onions, while Big Al is like Geno's: thicker slices of beef and onions. IWtP uses a special sauce when cooking in order to soften up the beef, while Big Al's does not. IWtP charges extra for provolone and places it beneath the beef, while Big Al places the provolone on top. IWtP does not toast the bun, while Big Al does. IWtP doesn't have a double-beef cheesesteak, while Big Al does. IWtP's prices are slightly higher than Big Al. The Big Pimpin' is $2 cheaper than 2 regular-sized cheesesteaks.

IWtP barely wins out in my opinion because I feel its beef is more tender and juicier, while Big Al is slightly tougher and drier. Still, it's a very close call, and you might prefer Big Al over IWtP yourself! Both of them are worthy for the hungriest of carnivores, and Torontonians are lucky to have both of them around."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have a belief that being so proximal to Kensington Market, we should never go to the same place twice. For this place, we've decided to break this rule. Sandwiches are absolutely delicious, portions are extremely generous. Service is very accommodating. I've been to the multiple restaurants that have occupied this space, and this place far surpasses rest."}
{"text":"I came here last night after shopping in Kensington Market. 

I had the Classic (cheese, steak, and onions) combo, which came with fries and a drink. The meal was quite tasty. I would have liked the garlic sauce to be more garlicky and the hot sauce could have been hotter. Otherwise, the food was fresh and filling. For $11 and change, it was a pretty good deal. 

The service was excellent!"}
{"text":"I debated between 3 and 4 stars but I had to go with 4 because the guy is super nice and the cheesesteak is pretty delicious. It's almost authentic,  definitely worth the $8 or whatever it was.  I really liked it. I just have to say 'I went to Philly' is the best cheesesteak in Toronto.  But if you're in Kensington...  This place will not disappoint."}
{"text":"stopped by for alittle snack, super friendly staff, fresh, some great tunes playing in the background........all the sauces are homemade, the chipotle is the way to go"}
{"text":"Love this place. Gooey cheese, tasty beef, onions, peppers..and the right bun. These guys get it. Filling portions and good value for what you pay for. Had the Grand Master Crash with Spicy Chipotle but didn't find it very spicy at all so I docked a star...but I definitely got the crash part...total knock out food."}
{"text":"Ordered the Big Pimpin' ($12) and it was awesome.  Double beef, cooked perfectly on a toasted bun.  I do think they should have added just a bit more cheese though.  Otherwise the sandwich was fantastic.  The owner was really cool, and service was fast.  I'll visit again for sure."}
