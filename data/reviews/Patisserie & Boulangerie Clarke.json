{"text":"Depuis le temps que mon chéri me parlait des fameux sandwichs de la boulangerie Clarke, je comprends pourquoi maintenant.
Bon sandwich à très bon prix. Sérieusement 4$ le sandwich et il est 16h40 et je n'ai toujours pas faim. Celui au smoked meat est très bon. Je vais devoir retourner pour goûter les autres choix. 
Fermer le w-e, argent comptant seulement (ATM à l'intérieur), et file à prévoir. Mais le service est rapide."}

Looking at Yelp, I'd almost call this place a well-kept secret, but come in during nearby Ubisoft's lunch hour rush and the lineup out the door will disabuse you of this notion! Come in at any other time though and you'll have sandwich in hand before you know it, because the service is super quick (don't be afraid of the lineup, it moves quickly!). Don't come too late though because they're closed by 5, sometimes earlier. 

The sandwiches range from $4.50 to $6 (2014 prices), tax included, and they are a good size. Extras (cheese, meat, veggies, hot veggies) are $1-$2. Most of the choices are meat but there are some cheese and vegetable options for the vegetarians out there. You can also choose whole wheat bread, to which I attribute major points! Get your sandwich all dressed to include cheese, lettuce, tomato, and THE BEST DIJONNAISE YOU'VE EVER TASTED. Seriously, that stuff is the sandwich equivalent of magic pixie dust.

They have a pretty big variety of deli meats to choose from, but I keep going back to the salami because I love that stuff. Aside from sandwiches, they offer a great selection of canned and bottled beverages and some delicious pastries (my favourite is the cannoli) to round out your lunch. Don't plan to sit down inside though, because there's no dining area (another heads-up: cash only). If you're not near home/work/somewhere you can eat a sandwich, and the weather is nice, I recommend eating it on the steps of the big old church at St-Viateur & St-Urbain.

Finally, supporting this place makes me feel good because it's one of the few enduring independent places on St-Viateur that hasn't changed since I started working in the neighbourhood in 2008. I really don't want it to close and turn into another one of those \"artisanal\" places that seem to be flooding the neighbourhood and charging rich-people prices."}
{"text":"So sad to see this place closed!  Seriously the best sandwiches in Montreal.  You walk in, the line moves fast, there's a team of three guys in an assembly line and they have it DOWN so your sandwich is literally ready in 11 seconds.  If you're a regular they'll have your sandwich in your hand by the time you've done placing your order.  There's one more guy constantly bringing fresh baked bread from the back room.  The deli meat tastes perfect with the mayo mustard combo they put on there.  And so cheap!  Dang I miss this place.  I can't even recommend any alternatives for it."}
