{"text":"Fast and friendly service, I am a repeat customer. There daily 4 dollar specials are a great value. A good place for a decent sub"}
{"text":"Very basic deli. I work close so go here often. From the street this place doesn't look like much, but once you enter... Still not much. Looks very outdated with booths and a few pictures on the wall, including beer signs although they don't serve beer. 

The sandwiches here are run of the mill deli sandwiches but extremely reasonably priced. They have daily specials for $3.50 for a full sub! Get a bucket of iced tea for a buck and you have lunch for under $5.00. 

The service is very friendly. Most of their business is regulars and they definitely let you know it. After going just a few times they had my name and order memorized. 

They are known for their \"Little Rock Special\" which is a cheesesteak, not bad but I prefer their cold subs."}
{"text":"Good bread, but steakums do not a cheesesteak make. Stick with cold subs."}
{"text":"This is a working mans lunch place. Ok for a quick sandwich. What we had was just okay --but barely. 

We had their lunch special : half a sub plus soda and a side for $4.99. Sub is small and roll is very soft and squishy. The chicken parm sub is sliced chicken roll wrapped around a piece of cheese and slightly warmed and covered in tomato sauce. The little Italy (much better than the chicken one) came with lettuce, tomatoes, onions, salami, ham, & cheese plus vinegar & oil.

Although friendly -- you order at the counter & they call you when ready by name of sandwich to pick up at counter - we won't be going back..."}
{"text":"Great place to grab quit bite. The staff is so great very friendly always clean. I usually get there meal deal. I swear my favorite thing is there tea its always perfect."}
{"text":"Best cheesesteak on the West side, period. Real steak, nice portion size for the money. I just wish they would add fries to their menu!"}
{"text":"I was looking for something different for dinner last night. I stumbled upon this place and was very pleasantly surprised. The sandwich was fantastic, the people were extremely friendly and the iced tea was excellent. I am from Dallas,Texas and when I'm on the road I always look for a go to place to eat. I have found mine in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"This place is great for a great price. Every day there is a special which is a footlong sub for 4 bucks. Also if you get the special that day you can add the extra large drink for 99 cents! The little rock special is a Philly cheese steak with grilled opinions, lettuce, tomato, oil and vinegar and mayo. Yummy. They have many versions of the cheese steak to even include marinara sauce. Okay mouth watering now. Another good one is the little Italy, which is another daily special, basically ham, salami, pepperoni, lettuce, tomato, and oil and vinegar. Oh and opinions but I don't get those. Now if your want some homemade sides like potato or macaroni salad, this ain't your place. They get it at Sams club. However who cares really? The sammich is what matters and of you get the special you don't need a side. They also have chips or fries. Don't feel like a sammich? Well they have other items like pizza and salads. For the cheap price you can't beat this place. I love working on the west side."}
{"text":"Mediocre subs at best.  You ask where's the meat??   
Not the worst food I've ever had, but to me, not worth the effort to ever go
back."}
