{"text":"Friends recently suggested this restaurant. It's a bit hidden in a strip mall (in the same plaza as Michelangelo's Market), but the food was excellent.  Don't let the name 'Eatery and Pub' fool you, it's not a bar, and the food is not bar food. I would reccomend giving it a try, I'll definately go back!"}
{"text":"After seeing the ROTD written by Allison Y I was looking forward to visiting this place as it was relatively new to the GTA/Markham scene. And I mean Western style cuisine in Markham are as rare as first to reviews are in San Francisco. 

It was pure kismet when I was asked to come by here with a fellow yelper today for a coffee/snack. RAPTURE JOY! Located in the plaza on the North East Corner of Hwy 7 and Woodbine (same as Michael-Angelo's Grocery Store). 

They have a small patio out front for warmer weather dining and upon walking in I was a little surprised to find that this casual \"pub\" actually had a white linen table cloth setting giving the appearance of a more fine dining establishment. 

Menu is a simple double sided laminate, easy to read, and filled with extremely affordable lunch and dinner options. We decided to share a Philly-Cheese steak sandwich with a side of sweet potato fries. 

Cheese steak was really good (I recommend taking the lettuce and tomato off), and the SPF's were cooked just the way I like it, shoestring with a nice crisp to them (not mushy and floppy). The fries came with a curry-garlic mayo for dipping which was extremely savoury (and easy to make - currie and garlic powder in mayo, BOOM!)

Cool spot, glad to see some western cuisine in Markham, will be back for another affordable lunch!"}
{"text":"I would consider this place a hidden gem.  Don't let the name fool you.  I wouldn't consider it as a pub.  It's more like a family restaurant / diner.

My colleagues and I were there for lunch.  Everyone of us enjoyed our meals.  We could tell they made everything from scratch.  I personally ordered the fish and chips and I was able to change my fries to sweet potato fries without additional costs.  Plus they made curry mayo as a dip for the fries which was delicious!  The batter on the fish was very light and crispy.  Service was great!  It wasn't busy so we had all the attention from the staff there.

Price is comparable to other restaurant of similar style, but quality wise, I think they beat the rest.

If you're in the area and looking for comfort food.  Definitely give this place a try.  Parking can be a bit tricky in the plaza though."}
{"text":"I seconded Scot and I would give them 3.5 stars.  I went last evening and found it better than it looks.  We were the only table there, so I could tell that the business was not the best.  However, I want to do it justice by saying that the food that we ordered was indeed top quality.  

Decor - clean, nice and not over the top.  I kept thinking it was good for wine and cake.  

Food - I don't know what eatery really means, but judging from the menu, it is simpler than a diner or restaurant.  It features a bit of everything: entrees, brunches, appetizers, sandwiches, pasta, salads, dessert, etc..  However, the selection is limited to maybe 1 to 3 of each category.  For example, under the Signature Classics section, there is 1 chicken panini, 1 vegi burger and 1 house hamburger.  Therefore, if you want a beef panini, there is none.  I ordered from the Pasta section that I could choose my own pasta type, sauce and protein (meatball, grilled chicken, seafood).  Therefore, I think some people could be taken back by the lack of selection.

However, everything that came onto our table tasted and looked great.  My chicken pasta tasted delicious.  The chicken breast was moist and nicely grilled.  The rose sauce was well balanced with a hint of balsamic vinaigrette.  The pasta was al dente.  The caesar salad was fresh and crisp with loads of garlic sauce.  My bf's back ribs were very tender and delicious.  I was told they made their sauces in house.  

This restaurant, in my opinion, is defined by what it is not: it is not a casual-fine dining restaurant, not a Hong Kong tea cafe, not a food court place, not a diner, not a burger place.  The best I can come up with is that it is like a bistro but North American style.  I guess that is what an eatery means.  The pricing tells me that it is great for lunches as everything except entrees and pasta are $10 or under.  However, there is a lunch menu that features a bow tie pasta for $10.  For dinner, the selection is limited, but whatever that comes is cooked with pride."}
{"text":"JJ's Eatery and Pub is an eatery, but definitely not a pub! 

Great place to grab a quick bite with a great selection of sandwiches, pasta, oh and if you consider chicken wings/chicken fingers/fish & chips pub food, then you can consider JJ's as a Pub?!

Since we are here for an afternoon snack, we decided to share a Philly Cheese Steak Sandwich ($9.99) with sweet potato fries. Deliciously good as my friend just ate that half in lighting speed and while I munched on the fries with curry mayo.

Service is excellent and polite. Waitress kept coming back to check on us and refill our water glasses.

JJ's Eatery is definitely worth dropping by for a quick lunch or dinner... trust me the food is way fresher and well made than any other restaurants in the area at this price point.

I did feel like a cheap date.. but I picked this place and I am glad I gave it a try!"}
