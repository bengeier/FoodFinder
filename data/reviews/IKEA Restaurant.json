{"text":"The Ikea Restaurant updated their menu. 

After years of 1.99$ breakfast, the price and quality of the breakfast are up.

The offering is as usual dirt cheap while being of a relatively good quality, often either biological or vegetarian."}
{"text":"I went for breakfast on a Tuesday morning at 10 am.
The prices went up.
The potatoes looked, felt and tasted like they were left over from yesterday.
The eggs are still powdered and tasteless.
The toast isn't toasted, it's just warm.
The nicest thing was the two slices of tomato you get on the plate.    
They were nice tomatoes.   LOL
Tons of seating, great for families on a budget, but I'd skip the breakfast and wait 'til they break out the meatballs."}
{"text":"Le gérant de la restauration nous abordent en anglais en premier. Très désagréable la petite madame aux lunettes. Nous avons acheté une crème glacée à 1 dollar et elle nous a fondu dans les mains après seulement 15 secondes. Je retourne pour me faire rembourser personne peut me rembourser il faut attendre 10 minutes. Moi par chez moi j'appelle ça du vol de temps. Les employés devraient être capable de rembourser une foutue crème glacée à 1 dollar. Bravo pour votre excellent service à la clientèle je n'irai plus jamais manger chez vous c'est certain"}
{"text":"My friends and I used to love the $1 breakfast with scrambled eggs, 2 small sausages, and breakfast potato cubes.  Add and extra dollar for unlimited coffee. Add an extra dollar for 2 pancakes. Overall very satisfying $1-$3 spent!! 

Also if you get the IKEA family card it gives you discounts on certain menu items!

Last year, they changed the menu and now charge more! The breakfast is the same except with the addition of one slice of tomato, it's at $2.50! They also have other options like crêpes for $3.50. 

One of my favorite dishes there is the Swedish meatball poutine: crispy coated fries, meatballs, and cheese curds covered with their meatball gravy--too good!! If I had to take a cholesterol hit at IKEA, this would be it! 

Their soft ice cream is IMHO 5x better than Costco. For only $1, you really can't beat that price and taste."}
