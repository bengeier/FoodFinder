{"text":"Well what can i say. I'm a sucker for fresh cut fries when the outside is beautifully crisp with the inside nice and moist. These were not that.  Frozen mccains curly fries. As for the burger.  The waitress advised me to get the large patty which to my surprise would be considered a regular maybe even small in other places. The bun was huge so the burger to patty ratio was all off. Tasty burger mind you but could have been better with more meat.  
Will likely try another place to eat next time in in this area. 
Also. As ken x noted. Not very 50's diner. Not sure why they went with that theme if their not going to attempt to pull it off."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the burger here, so did my friends. The beef is tasty, not filler'y, very juicy. Ask the waitress to explain the burger sizes, they're not obvious on the menu, but the prices should clue you in which are the small vs large patties.  Great prices too. The fries were perfectly cooked too. Will definitely be going again!"}
{"text":"Nothing special. Pan fried burger... not remarkable. Commercial cut fries... just Ok. Service was good, but not enough for me to crave. In this era or gourmet burgers, Brays is stuck in the 50's."}
{"text":"I like this place. My husband loves this place. Their breakfasts are such great value for money and really tasty. Their burgers are uncomplicated and very tasty, at a fantastic price point. The service is friendly, the place is clean, and food is fresh and well made. It is such a treat to have these folks in the neighborhood. I highly recommend going."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick bite to eat, but nothing special.  I didn't really feel like it was a 50's diner, but the music saved the day.  Very clean and friendly staff as well."}
{"text":"This place is GREAT, don't listen to these other reviewers who are complaining about the \"poor 50's decor\" which has nothing to do with the food Bray's produces. Let's be fair, you either came to this restaurant because you read the Yelp reviews, drove by it [and seen the giant donkey mascot], or you're a long-time Port Credit resident [and know what this place used to be].. I'm not quite sure which of those suggested fine dining, perhaps you're looking for a Burger's Priest, where you pay for overhead, not quality. And hey.. if it's so unbearable, they do offer take out :) 

The burgers at Bray's are SO delicious. The prices are exceptional. The service is warm & welcoming. What more do you need? 

Try the signature 50's Burger, it comes dressed with a tasty garlic-y dill sauce!! Their gravy is also really yummy."}
{"text":"Came here for a late breakfast/early lunch with the family.  The service was very friendly and the place was pretty clean for a diner.  The food arrived in good time.  We ordered the 50's burger, fish sandwich, Big #1 breakfast and a double cheeseburger combo.  The buns were very light and airy.  The hamburger meat was not particularly large in size but for the price, go double and you'll be set!  I love crinkly fries so this was a must get when I went.  The fish sandwich is a fried cod.  Although it looked dark and a bit overdone, the person who ate it thought it was alright.  Would definitely consider coming back here as the price you pay for what you get is significantly cheaper than other breakfast chains/burger places but of the same type of quality.  It came out to about $7/pp and we were all satisfied and full without being overly stuffed."}
{"text":"Thought the burger was very good, fresh toppings and saut√©ed onions were so good and fries were great too! The prices are very reasonable. The staff were very friendly. Not only that they are open till midnight.. for your late night cravings.  Can't wait to try the breakfast!"}
