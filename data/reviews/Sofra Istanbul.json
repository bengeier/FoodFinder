{"text":"I have been to this place for the last 5 years and religiously order the Dorado fish which you can only get off the Mediterranean Sea. And I am never disappointed. I also like the pide and ayran, overall this place is amazing for food! And they have the best bread that is baked fresh in the oven that you can see and pairing it with the Hummus on the menu is the best!The ambience is nothing fancy- not a big deal!"}
{"text":"I used to go there prices were OK considered it is more of a cafeteria than a restaurant, no atmosphere, no music, no decorations. Just sit on kitchen table and eat. Do not try to buy shish kebob since the meat is hard and chewy difficult to swallow, do not even try to buy shawarma beef or chicken it tastes nothing just mixtures of salad and hard meat on top. The portions becomes smaller and prices are high compared to a school cafeteria food."}
{"text":"Poor service overpriced food. Nothing special. Slow service.  Snobish waiters. Undercooked food."}
{"text":"I was quite impressed with their cokertme kebab as well as by their lahmajun.  In terms of desserts, I would highly recommend their roll kadayiph. 
I found their prices were affordable given the generous portions that were served."}
{"text":"If you're a big eater, get the \"open face chicken shawarma wrap\". You can taste the quality from the first bite and it wasn't dry like most places. Also, probably the best baklava in town. I go there for lunch sometimes."}
{"text":"The cafeteria-like interior doesn't reflect the delicious pide.  I can't rate on anything else except the pide,  because I've gone back and always order that.  

I will note,  have gone back with different people,  and everyone (5/5) people have been blown away by the various pide (pizza-ish) dishes. 

Not sure why people note the food is overpriced,  it isn't.  A pide is about $12,  and it is bigger than a small pizza,  plus you get a delicious salad.  

Favorite place in this neck of the woods."}
{"text":"The best shawarma in town!
Great food and a very nice team. We go there at least twice a week. Always fresh!"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed that I didn't even get to finish my meal and also put it in a \"to-go\" box (don't want to waste food).

I followed the comments on Yelp and decided to try here because I'm a Shwarma fanatic! Despite the expensive prices.. I decided to get a chicken shwarma plate..

It came with a nice size of garden salad (much bigger than most other restaurants). Then came the main dish: JUST some chicken pieces and bland-looking rice. This was already $15.

I wanted all the other stuff that goes well with it: salads, pickled radishes, onions, etc (not much selections) and that was an added $2.75.

Even with the extras.. It was not even great.. For that price, I could have gotten about 2 mouth-watering plates elsewhere.

The falafels were good though!"}
{"text":"Went with family for my birthday dinner. The food was good, na complaints, but the service could have been better...

Na Bread, Na Problem!

Na Wata, Na Tip!"}
{"text":"The best shwarma ever! Nice staff and great desserts. This location is still open. ..they just renovated. All the food is awesome! My favourite is the chicken shwarma wrap. Have tea with mint and some pastries at the end - you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Part of the order came out wrong so I notified our server immediately, and I was told that it was my fault, and I should therefore accept the incorrect order. To which I disagreed and stated that I'm quite shocked at the server openly telling me its my fault, but I don't want to get into a \"he said, she said\" debate, and if they would please just fix my order as part of customer service or just take it back, because I don't want something I didn't order. The server went back to speak to the boss, and then came back and told me the same thing again - that I should accept the order because it was my mistake. I was completely stunned that this was the message from the boss?? I worked as a server at a steakhouse for 3 years, and we dealt with even the rudest people, way more politely, and I'm considered by everyone who know me as very polite. I stated I am shocked at the customer service, after which there was more back and forth, but then they finally fixed my order. I thanked the server for fixing it, and left her an 18% tip. I could sense that the server was afraid of the boss and kitchen staff, and I have a soft spot for servers. To the boss: if your staff is scared enough of you to instead accuse the customer of making a mistake and then insisting that they accept in an incorrect order .... I think you need to rethink that. In this job miscommunications happen, and it's not a good idea to force a customer to accept a wrong order. If I ever come back, it's because your server fixed the order and genuinely apologized later for the extra hassle, and not because you did anything even mildly useful for resolving a very simple situation.

Assorted Pideh and Iskander kebab were good. The meat stew was okay."}
{"text":"Best middle eastern food in woodbridge! Simply the best largest shawarma wraps only downside is limited seating and service needs a lot more improvement."}
{"text":"The most amazing Turkish/food ever. Plus they quantity is absolutely amazing. These guys are not cheap and don't count every piece of meat or charge .50 extra for a bit of sauce. I could barely finish their shawerma. I mostly had their platters. Definitely a must!!"}
{"text":"The exterior and dining area does not reflect how AMAZING the food is. There has been nothing that I haven't tried on the menu that wasn't delicious!"}
{"text":"In short : tasty food with generous portion ,  bad decor , over-priced.

I personally dont bother the decor/ambience/atmosphere as long as food is good but many people demand to dine in nice good environment specially when price is high. I reckon this restaurant will go up if they upgrade or move to better interior. I also think they need more servers as its often busy during which their 1 or 2 servers cant pay attention to all customers.
I definitely recommend this restaurant to halal eaters in town."}
{"text":"This is my fav Turkish whole in the wall in GTA.

I had a small Greek salad with chicken shawarma. It was delicious! The feta was melting in my mouth, the chicken was made to perfection. The staff is friendly so I am getting the impression that I will be up for royal treatment when I go to Istanbul at the end of March."}
{"text":"One of the best Turkish restaurants in gta! Highly recommend this to anyone that enjoys some traditional turkish home cooking or something off the grill. Their baklava is absolutely amazing and free tea :)"}
{"text":"Went to it tonight with my family expecting something amazing from how much we heard about it, but oh we were up for a surprise. The food is way over priced, quality of the food was very mediocre."}
{"text":"Overpriced. You can get the same food for less at Turkish places closer to downtown. They didn't give me the complimentary bread until I asked for it. That's not cool. Lucky for them the working crowd in that area doesn't have many good choices."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to eat before a movie and saw this place nearby.  They were packing up the dining area but still open for take out.  Customer service was great.  The portions are huge and the food is delicious!"}
{"text":"The food taste really good
Drive from core downtown to the restaurant to try it and was good food
Give it a try"}
{"text":"I asked for water at least five times but the waiter purposely ignored us! Thinking about what I had done to offend him, I noticed the only other non-Turkish group in the restaurant were also being ignored.

Non-Turks avoid this place!

As for the waiter: buddy, racism is not a good job strategy when you're working on tips."}
{"text":"The service was not that good. Food was good but tooooo much yogurt inside the food(I know Turkish food has yogurt inside but that was wayyyy to much) without the yogurt the food was  tasty they don't come and ask you if we need anything  the place was packed full . I don't think it's a place where I will go again one time experience was enough"}
{"text":"First of all, it's a bit pricy for the service and regular Turkish food. In general, food was OK.  We ordered Shish Kebob and Kofte which was so close to authentic Turkish one and tastes good. Lentil soup, on the other hand, wasn't bad, but it wasn't even close to the Turkish Mercemik Çorba. Also, the Kunofe was a little burnt.
Service was bad though, our server seemed to do so many tasks, so his timing was awful. 
The place looks tidy and clean. After all, 3 Stars sums it up."}
{"text":"Have had better Mediterranean food and customer service elsewhere!

Its right they do well but over years their quality of food and service has reduced significantly. They over charge you wherever they can - $5 for a piece of baklava or extra $16 bucks platter (excluding any garlic or hummus, you pay extra for that). 

The waitress is rude and she does not care about the customers, she knows the place can do without one or two. I have received the same thing from few other friends who have tried it over last few years. 

For the quality of food, customer service or ambiance, coupled with the price tag you pay, the place is not worth it."}
{"text":"Sorry but all of these positive reviews are nowhere near justified. Must be written by friends and family...

My fiancé was happy with his chicken shwarma sandwich (aka pita wrap) for $8ish. I had a chicken shwarma dinner for $14 something. For that price it was pretty much the same dish in a different form, where instead of his pita I had rice but paid $6 more. It definitely lacked sauce and was nothing to write home about. 

Food was overall 6.5/10. Not bad, but I could get better value in this ghetto neighbourhood I call my home. 

Less impressive was the service!!! Insert angry face. 

To preface this story there was only 1 other table of 4 ladies finishing their meal at the time of our visit, and we are a table of 2.

First time, I asked for garlic sauce and it took about 5 minutes. Doesn't seem like a long time but our server  was literally standing next to our table doing absolutely nothing the entire time. I wasn't eating, waiting for that sauce to go with my lack luster meal, so the wait was annoying as hell. Literally... She stood next to us hovering, and was NOT busy! Just didn't have the time of day to bother getting me my sauce. I thought maybe she forgot. But at her leisure many minutes later she managed to non chalantly fetch my sauce. 

Midway into digging in, I decided said lack luster meal would benefit from a side of coleslaw, even with its $5 price tag. I asked another server (because ours was gone for some time, maybe on break) and he himself had been standing around doing nothing... He said just a minute... And came back a 2nd time telling me to hold on. I figured maybe he had to wait for my sever to get back from break and that he had no authority to put the order in himself? I waited patiently...
 10min later she comes back. Minutes after her return, I could tell she had no clue of my request. The guy never bothered to tell her even though he hadn't done anything in the last 15 min - I knew that guy couldn't be trusted!!! So I ordered the coleslaw again from her, to which she seemed baffled like she never heard the word (though it is a dish on the menu) and then finally understood and put the order through. 

I mean... maybe 15 minutes for a side of coleslaw doesn't seem sooo bad. But when it's $5 for a tiny plate, which I needed because of my already  disappointing meal... and on top of that the servers seem lazy like they don't have a care in the world? Eughhhhh! 

I won't be back. Service is a 2/10 (maybe 1.5). Not just for slowness which I'd understand if they were busy, but for not giving two fu*ks to move their as* to give even half decent service! 

This review should overall be a 1 or a 2 but I'm trying not to be bitter. 

P. S. If your business model is to have sh*t service, just have patrons order from the cashier and sit down until their food is ready for pick up! Good Lord!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for Turkish food. The lentil soup, chicken shish kabobs and knafeh have become a personal favourite. The portions are very large. The bread is freshly made and warm. The staff is friendly. On a busy night you might be stuck waiting, but not more than the usual weeknight out at  a restaurant."}
{"text":"I liked this place.  The Gyros are huge and can fill you up. I liked the baklava as well.

The falafals were very good and salad was fresh."}
{"text":"I love Sofra. I've eaten here several times and I always order the Cokertme Kebab - it is THAT good that I always want it. I have tasted their chicken as well and it had a unique basil-flavour to it. It is a shame that the location and casual look of the restaurant shy it away from being a place where you can enjoy a nice dining experience, because the quality of their food would suit that kind of atmosphere. They are very clean, and service is always great. This is a restaurant I would love to see expand and grow, perhaps open other locations across the GTA."}
{"text":"I would give it a 6+ star rating. Everything is made fresh to order definitely have to get the Iskander, Shawerma or lahmejine. Been here several times and never been disappointed. BEST SHAWERMA IN THE CITY!!!"}
{"text":"There are a lot of places that call themselves Turkish or middle eastern. However this was my first experience in Toronto that offered truly authentic Turkish food. The taste, variety, presentation even decoration were really authentic. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"One of the best Turkish joints in the GTA. I have been to 2 locations in North York (smaller) and Concord (much larger location). Adana kabob is a personal favourite, comes in a skewer and very tender, the food is not too spicy. Hummus is great as well. Make sure you end your meal with a Turkish coffee or tea!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, service could be a bit better but that's me being picky. The quality of the food is really good. Lots of options to try. Not to any other good middle eastern places in that area"}
{"text":"I got a Chicken&beef shawarma & it was amazingggg. My first impression when I walked in was terrible , it was over crowded and didn't look good at all. BUT I would go back for sure, they LOAD your shawarma up with meat & the sauces are amazing. I eat shawarma on a regular basis & this would definitely be on my top 5 places now!"}
{"text":"Excellent bread. Great baba ganoush. Sitting is okay but food more than makes up for it"}
{"text":"Doner Kebabs! Although this place had a huge sign that advertised its doner kebabs, I decided to be a bit more adventurous. I ordered off the traditional Turkish menu and got dishes that you don't normally see at a doner/shwarma joint.

Iskender Kebab- This resembled a shwarma plate dinner with shaved meat. However, the tomato-based sauce and the yogurt complemented the flavours of the meat. However, I wasn't a big fan of the bread underneath the meat as it got soggy from the heat and sauces.

Adana Kebab- Two huge skewers of meat on rice. The seasoning of the meat was not overpowering and it was made fresh, which added to the tenderness of the meat. 

Veggie Eggplant- Cold dish of egglant rolls with minced meats. This was mediocre.

Special/mixed peta- Probably the best part of the meal. Fresh bread made in a traditional oven topped with minced beef, onions, feta, and lot more seasonings from Anatolia. I definitely recommend trying the peta here!

The food is overall above average as its price range. However, the decor and environment are a bit lacking, which reminded me more of a take-out shawarma joint than a traditional Turkish restaurant. But hey, if you value the taste of the food above all else, check this place out!"}
{"text":"Generous servings, quality fresh food, consistency, moderate pricing. AMAZING SANDWICHES!! Not the best place to dine in, i grab my shawarma and go. At most shawarma restaurants, i usually eat 2 sandwiches, here one is sufficient as they are pretty big."}
{"text":"My husband and I were craving great tasting authentic Turkish food after our honeymoon to Istanbul and we found this place. It has been our go to date night when we feel like having amazing food. The staff are very hospitable and always polite! The food will fill you as their portion sizes are decent, but you won't feel bloated. You can clearly see that they use quality ingredients. This is one of our favourite restaurants!"}
{"text":"Turkish style shawarma sandwich was delicious. Huge and messy but very nice tasting. Pizza they serve is delicious - thin crust."}
{"text":"We were on our way to get sushi and didn't realize the place was closed on Sunday so we ended up here instead. The place resembles a fast food joint more than a restaurant but it has full service. Decent food but I'd probably not come here again. 

I think this is a place everybody should try at least once. If you're adventurous and want to try exotic foods you've never tried before, you need to come here. They have some Turkish entrees that I haven't seen elsewhere. When people think middle eastern food, it's usually falafel and shawarma. Yes they have those here too but if you come here, you really need to order their specialties like Pide or their Turkish entree dishes like fish and meat saute. 

We ordered Meat Saute with lamb and Sheperd's Braised Chicken. Both came with salad and a basket of bread. For $15 an entree, I think it's reasonable but I'd prefer it to be cheaper and without the salad. I'm the kind of guy that likes to keep my orders around $10 outside of special occasions. They both tasted pretty good but not mind-blowing. They were not \"WOW I need to come again\" kind of goodness. The braised chicken had tastes similar to Chinese stir fry. The meat saute also tasted similar to stir fry.

The bread was awesome. It tasted like it came fresh from the oven. Too bad we had to ask for it. Our server seemed nice but he almost forgot our bread. The bread made us happier than the entrees.

Don't get me wrong. It's a decent restaurant but it fails my value test. If they chopped $2-3 off most of their entrees I'd consider coming again. If you want Pide pizza there are other options in the GTA for better prices. Besides, this place is in the middle of nowhere. There just isn't enough reason for me to drag myself all the way here for food that I feel is slightly overpriced."}
{"text":"My boyfriend had been talking about this restaurant for a few years now, and recently we were in the area and decided to drop by for a late lunch. It wasn't very busy, and someone came to assist us right away. She was lovely.

We ordered a small baba ganoush (with bread) and iskender kebab to share. The baba ganoush was fairly generic, but pretty good. The iskender kebab was a) huge b) nothing like I've ever had before and c) delicious! It's basically shaved beef with a tomato sauce over Turkish bread. It's a medley of flavours and textures and it's balanced nicely with the yogurt and grilled jalapeno on the side. 
Oh and the side salad was really good too! I'm typically not a fan of random house salads, but their dressing is really nice and balanced. 

One thing: The dining area could be a tad bit cleaner. This is not a place you go for ambiance and 5-star-service - you come here for the food and I'd say it's pretty authentic and delicious. There are a lot of options, and I'd definitely go back to try more items on their menu."}
{"text":"I've been going there for years as the food and value are amazing.
Dropped by today to see that it's been completely renovated. 
Looks amazing and the food remains great!
Highly recommend this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch or a quick dinner. Great menu selections, what makes this place a little more unique they do catering and a larger selection of different fish dishes. The service was good we even got Turkish tea after our meal !  The only down side is it has simple decor so if your looking to have a fancy meal its not the place to go."}
{"text":"The chicken shwarma is great! The fries are not (they are the frozen ones you can get at the grocery store)."}
{"text":"Excellent turkish food. The Adana kabob is so delicious and sizzling hot! The skewers keep the meat hot while you eat.

The Pidas are amazingly delicious, quite a variety to choose from too.

Iskandar was not as saucy as I thought it would be. Specifically I felt the tomato taste was lacking but this could be also because they serve it without a bed of rice. The accompanying yogurt was very nice.

Chicken Shawarma sandwich is a great value considering it's a massive portion.

Service was quick, we didn't have to wait long when we requested items. Food does take time due to being made fresh. The entire atmosphere is similar to cafes back in Turkey actually.

The green chillies are fairly potent, beware of their bite but they make excellent side items for many of the dishes.

Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Why does this place have no reviews?

I was given a choice between pumping my stomach with meat, grease and Cajun fries (Five Guys burgers...and I mean that in the kindest way possible. It's an experience all of its own) or taking a chance on this new Turkish restaurant. I cannot express how glad I am to have chosen the latter.

We walk in and, despite being slightly intimidated by our own unfamiliarity with the cuisine, are quickly seated by friendly staff with a massive, beautifully illustrated menu. There's clear photos of everything  and numbered items to order with, so there's no anxiety or uncertainty about the less-familiar items on the menu. Having never had Turkish food, we settled on the grape leaves appetizer, the Cokertme kebab (a beautiful beefy sunburst of fried potatoes and tenderloin) and the special pide - appropriately contextualized as a Turkish pizza.

The waitress surprised us with complementary salads, which appear to be standard with any order here. The salad was a wonderfully fresh mix of romaine lettuce, a nest of shredded carrot and grape tomatoes - no corners cut on the produce quality here or the size of this \"side\" salad. It came with this amazing, apparently homemade dressing on the side (always considerate) - a nice sweetly tangy yogurt-based dressing that I continued to crave long after receiving my entrees.

Food arrived fresh, fast and YES - as good as the photos in the menu. Trust the photos on their website: presentation definitely does not play second fiddle to taste here. And everything tasted just as good as it looked - the kebab and pide both reflected the copious amounts of fire you'll see erupting in the kitchen. Meat was perfectly spiced and cooked nicely, and the cushion of yogurt it arrived on was the perfect complement. 

In addition to the salad, I felt that despite the meat-heavy menu, this place is pretty vegetarian friendly and labels the many options as such. Additionally, the quality of the produce, meat and preparation made for a meal that felt satisfying and robust but not belt-looseningly heavy or self-hatred inducingly rich (see also: Five Guys, my other Vaughan/Woodbridge/YorkU area go-to.). 

Decor was clean and minimal: a brightly lit suburban eatery that would just as easily accommodate a large Sunday family feast as it would a quick solo weekday lunch break. Orders were fast, staff were sweet and helpful despite how busy the place was, and every plate coming out of the kitchen looked utterly delicious.

Do yourself a favor: don't walk in here, and sell yourself short with a shawarma or some lame chicken fingers. Pick yourself the coolest looking picture of a meat-sunburst or point at a fan of kebab skewers and get that. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Food was great! Costomer service was great!! I just didn't get why they didn't bring us traditional turkish bread that all the turkish restaurants brings it with the salad before your food come, even though they brought it for other customers!! But in general everything was good."}
{"text":"Let me begin this review with a DAYAAM BRUH!  Let the record state that this was my first visit to Sofra and it definitely will not be my last.  I shall begin with the interior of the Restaurant. Clean. Simple set up with plenty of tables to choose from. Parking is free of charge and there is plenty of spots available. Table service for dine in and counter for take out. Service was friendly and super fast. We ordered two chicken shawarma's. Now this isn't your regular chicken shawarma people. They use a soft white wrap which is filled with the freshest of ingredients.  Amazing on the meat count.  This bad boy of a shawarma has both length and girth so be prepared to eat. It was good till the last bite.  You get the options of fully loaded and regular or spicy. I would recommend spicy.  Next time I go, it will be extra extra spicy. I do plan on trying everything on the menu. Lol.  Before I forget, I remember it being a wee bit warm inside of the eating area.  They have a large oven for bread and Pide making. So go topless. 
Enjoy it my fellow Yelpers!"}
{"text":"Great food fast service and very clean definitely will come again next time. We ordered lamp Kabab and steak it was very  delicious."}
{"text":"Glad I tried this place

I decided to dine in I ordered the chicken shawarma dinner which is $15.99 they give you complimentary bread served with your salad first the salad I had all fresh ingredients the the dressing was amazing

When the chicken shawarma plate actually came out I was surprised it was a lot of meat the rice was tasty and the food tasted light. I didn't feel heavy while I was eating but I could not finish the portion sizes were quite large


The only thing missing was some garlic potatoes and a bit of my rice was stuck together and chewy but other than that everything was amazing they exceeded my expectations"}
{"text":"My second tim here and a great experience like the other time! Loved the food and was so happy with the service! I do absolutely recommend it! And for sure, I come back myself!"}
{"text":"Nice big portions. The only downside is that we have to purchase the sauces separately."}
{"text":"Oh wow! How could the staff at a restaurant be so rude. The food was less than satisfactory, the place was dirty. 
The staff seemed very ignorant and racist. They greeted other Turks with a big smile and spoke their language to other customers while taking my order. The prices are high for the crappy quality food they serve. And most of their stuff is frozen and reheated. 
Go to McDonalds you'll probably get better quality food, believe it or not."}
{"text":"This is a very good Turkish restaurant, food is good and authentic Turkish style. But if you go for lunch expect long wait times as it is extremely busy due to all the businesses around this restaurant.
Price wise it fairly priced for the portions you get and the quality of the food is very good, the iskandar kebob is my favourite dish here."}
{"text":"I've tried a few Turkish restaurants and this was definitely one of the better ones. We ordered the salad combo which comes with 5 different dips and the fried eggplant and hummus were the only good ones of the 5.

Tried the lahmajun which was a tad undercooked but if it was cooked a bit longer it would have really been delicious. The Adana kabab is the best I've tried so far. 

Unfortunately they were out of tea and dessert so we couldn't try it. I'll definitely be trying this again."}
{"text":"It was really good and everything tastes really fresh! I got the chicken shawarma on hummus and my boyfriend got a falafel wrap. Falafel wrap was better than Me Va Me and so was the chicken shawarma. However, I still love Mustafa's as my top turkish food. Their Pide (sp?) is amazing and Sofra is still good but just not AS good. Overall, I would go again, the food is reallllllly fresh and I enjoyed it a lot."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Gigantic portions  (seriously, 1 entree is enough for two people).

Ingredients all seem fresh, and I think almost everything is made in house. They even have an oven where they do all their baking. Good proportions of meat too, for the carnivores among us.

And very friendly and efficient service to boot!"}
{"text":"Gourmet food in a diner setting!!!!
I enjoyed lunch with 3 girlfriends today and was pleasantly surprised with the quality of food.  I mentioned to the waitress that this was my first visit and she was so gracious and friendly while taking to time to explain the items on the menu. The food was not only delicious the presentation was fantastic as well.  Every bite was a flavorgasm in your mouth.  Only thing missing was a glass of fine wine. I will definitely be back soon!!!"}
{"text":"After looking through different Turkish places to grab a quick bite I landed on Sofra and loved it! We ordered take out over the phone after browsing their menu online. It was ready right on time (she even called us back as soon as it was ready), still hot and everything was absolutely delicious. The food was spiced perfectly, the meat tender and the portions plentiful. And the complimentary salads and house dressing that comes with each Turkish appetizer was a yummy surprise. I was also really surprised by the baklava because I find it too dry in so many places, but Sofra's was perfect and so yummy we wished we had ordered more. 

The staff was really nice even if we had slight difficulty understanding each other on the phone, but they got everything in the order right!

The interior is casual and bright with fast food style seating and very, very clean. 

I wouldn't say this is a cheap eats place, each main dish was $12-$15. But you get a huge helping that will last more than one meal unless you're starving. 

I'll be going back!"}
{"text":"Prices were higher than expected based on online reviews/photos of menu. We ordered 2 sandwiches which were decent sized and surprisingly had a tasty salad mix inside (not just your regular iceberg lettuce, tomato and onion combo). 

At first glance we thought it was an order at the counter service but you are actually waited on which was nice."}
{"text":"I decided to try something here based on the reviews and it was on the way back to my hotel. It did not disappoint. 

The staff was courteous, polite and very helpful. I wasn't quite sure what I wanted but the mixed shwarma was recommended. I know shwarma is pretty much a staple and easily done for the most part but this was excellent!!  And the hummus was also great. 
I kind of wish I was staying in the area a bit longer so I could try more of the menu."}
{"text":"let me start off by saying the portions at this place are huge so each person should really only order one portion for themselves. each plate comes with a garden salad which is quite big in my opinion. the food is very flavourful and authentic. i will definitely return if i were craving mediterranean or turkish :)"}
{"text":"This was absolutely delicious meal. We started with the Mushroom/Onion Hummus. I've had hummus many times before but never with Mushrooms & Onions...a delicious change. The meal was white basmati rice (not my fav) & Sauté Chicken. My wife had Cokertme Beef Kebab. Both were fabulous (my Sauté Chicken was better...just saying)!! The service was great & the food was amazing. The even served cold lemon water with the meal. To top it ALL off..we had a coconut roll which was outstandingly good. If your looking for a fresh & delicious middle eastern meal, THIS is the place to go. I'm coming back!!"}
{"text":"Sofra Istanbul is my go-to for delicious and fresh Mediterranean food ! Though they are a bit on the expensive side, their food quality and quantity is quite good. I would recommend them for sit down over take out, because the food tastes best when it is hot and fresh. They have both beef and chicken shawarma, and they are generous with their portions. My favourite item on the menu is their chicken crepe, it is juicy, delicious and so different ! My mom had the baked salmon which was absolutely delicious, probably the best salmon we have had at any restaurant (yes, even higher end placed like the keg). Their \" Cokertme Kebab \" is to die for. Juicy and tender pieces of beef surrounded in tangy yogurt and crunchy potatos, a must have! They also have great seafood options, both fried and baked whole fish, which are also very tasty. The ambiance of the location could use a bit of work, as well as the service in the front, but the kitchen and the food itself is worth the trip."}
{"text":"Very good shawarma! Also the freshly baked pita was amazing fresh out of the oven! 

I will deffinately be back!"}
{"text":"A great restaurant all the way in Vaughn. If you are heading to Black Creek Pioneer Village, this is a perfect place to have lunch or dinner before or after you head to the park. They have an extensive menu with some traditional Turkish food that you will only find in Turkey. They also have other general menu items such as schnitzel, kabobs, shawarma, and steak for those who are not adventurus in trying something different. I ordered Beyti a ground beef and lamb skewer wrapped in some form of paper dough. It was amazing. The Turkish pizzas looked and tasted amazing too. Their Baklavas are quite good and very cheap ($1.79). This is a great restaurant to check out. I wish it was more central. I would come here more often."}
{"text":"I work walking distance to this restaurant and have been quite a few times.  It's always busy during the lunch hour so I usually go after 2 pm as I like to have a table.  I usually order their sandwiches, open faced, and because of that they remember me.  I've tried a couple of their mains which were really good too.  I live downtown, so for me the prices are comparable.  

The overall service is ok and relatively quick.  There are a lot of people who work in the area who come here for take away as well which keeps the place very busy.

My dish of choice is the lamb sandwich, open faced, with all the dressings"}
{"text":"I would give 3 star if not of the very good shawarma they have. The hummus and the rest of the salads are not great, the baklava is not more than OK and the service was solid. The chicken shawarma though is definitely a winner!"}
{"text":"We truly enjoyed the shawarma, salads and breads.
So much flavour, everything was fresh and delish!
Will be back!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner. Lots of seating, good food , hummus, chicken kabob, tea and dessert deserves special mention. Will go back !"}
{"text":"Sofra is now my go-to place for Turkish and Middle Eastern food around Steeles and HWY400. This place offers a plethora of mouthwatering options on the menu. Even vegans will find suitable items on the menu. Their baba ghanoush is out of this world. The Cokertime kebab is to die for. Seriously, if you appreciate Middle Eastern food, you will absolutely love Sofra. It instantly brought back memories of Turkish food I experienced when I was a kid who spent summers in Turkey. Did I mention their pistachio baklava alone is worth a trip there? It's THAT good."}
{"text":"Best Shawarma hands down.  The chicken is so crispy and tender.  Get the chicken  sandwich spicy with everything in it."}
{"text":"We ordered a rack of lamb with rice and fattoush and a grape leaves appetizer. Everything was delicious! The lamb was cooked to order (yum) and the rice was delicious as well! I loved the grape leaves and the cucumber yogurt sauce it was in was on point !The to go order was prepared Farley quickly.   Would defiantly go again."}
{"text":"This place is a smaller restaurant, with a bit of a fast food feel. The food was decent, lacked flavour. I ordered the Mantu dish. I have had Mantu at other restaurants where the dish is bursting with flavour, so I know what I can get. When I asked for hot sauce, even the hot sauce wasn't doing it for me, it was the chilli's mixed in vinegar.

Overall i think it's a decent restaurant and just didn't hit the spot for me.

The service was on point. For that reason I am giving them 3 *'s."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, Its my third time here. You may think the the price is bit high for a restaurant in this location but the portion is very generous. I was with my friends and all  liked the food. The staff was patient enough to answer our questions and recommend the food to us. We tried falafel (perfectly fried), Babaganoush (just amazing), kebabs.
I did not like their tabbouleh salad, but their Shawarma wraps are very tasty, one of the best I have tried."}
{"text":"OH MY GOODNESS. Alright, I was a little hesitant because I have never tried Turkish food. I went with my mom and my girlfriend (who IS TURKISH) so I had to put on my big boy pants on and try some Middle Easter/Mediterranean cuisine. I ordered the Iskender Doner, a traditional Turkish dish, which is meat smothered in red tomato-like sauce with bread pieces already in the dish. The meat was delicious! Incredibly mouth-watering, not dry at all, and very good! The bread-sauce combination made this dish due to it being AMAZING.

We had some pita and kefte on the side which is essentially almost sour cream with some cucumber pieces in the bowl.

The restaurant was family-owned, but I wish the decor reminded me more of the Mediterranean (a little ordinary, not amazing, but the food REALLY made up for it.)

Overall this was the first time, but WILL NOT be the last time I visit this place. I really want to try every dish on the menu because I was already wowed the first time :)"}
{"text":"We tried this place out today after my brothers convocation from York. After seeing how busy it was from the outside we surely wanted to try it out and we were not disappointed! 
We ordered baba ganoush with fresh pita bread to start with. The pitas had seasme seeds on it and were fluffy, warm and fresh. The Baba Ganoush had a great smoky flavour that my family loved. 
We then got our main course meal. The chicken schnitzel was nice and crispy on the outside and the marinate was flavourful. The chicken skewers were cooked to perfection. The meat pies were also a big hit but just had too much oil. The lamb skewers had a very meaty taste that my brother does not like! 
The meals also came with big jalapeño peppers which looked amazing. Once my brother had a bite of it his mouth literally burned. He then had to eat a sugar packet to calm down the burning sensation. Lol! 
The service was also great. Our server was super nice. All in all I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This place is incredible. I have been eating here since it opened. The food and the service is absolutely amazing. Highly recommend it to everyone"}
{"text":"its a really good place to get some food! but barely any room to walk around to get the food in. I was sold this place by a colleague of mine, when they told me \"hey you like shawarma, they have lamb shawarma\" I was SOLD! upon arriving into this restaurant, I couldn't help but notice, every seat had a person in it, and they had a line-up for people waiting to sit down. slowly but surely, I understood why, delicious plates of heaven was coming our of the kitchen by the minute! the chef doing the shawarma seemed to be going at a heightened pace, but didn't look to be breaking a sweat at all. once I got top the cashier I asked for \"two lamb please\" the response back was \"we didn't make any today, beef or chicken\" so I settled for chicken. to see the chef work on other peoples food, was very hypnotic and symphonic, the right portions and balance with the wraps. when my turn was up, it was front and centre watching my wraps being made, as I watched him make my wraps I told the chef not to be shy with the hot sauce, as it looked really really good. the flavors of the wrap were amazing, and the hot sauce left my mouth deliciously numb. I would definitely go back, and I'd love to see what else they have to offer, this restaurant is in a plaza with some other eateries, but I do believe they could have the whole plaza and be packed as I witnessed at lunch. 
the parking lot has a lot of spaces, but usually all full. the restaurant has some charm to it, might need an update in a couple of years. but absolutely awesome flavors and smells coming from this place. 
I look forward to the next visit."}
{"text":"Incredible, authentic Turkish food. One of the better meals i've had in recent memory. Well worth a visit."}
