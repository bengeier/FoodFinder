{"text":"Been there four times with my better half, and the food has always been excellent, as has the service (service with a smile and offer of menu suggestions). Club sandwich, open face ravioli, burger, fries, veggie sliders - all excellent! Being new, there still are not a lot of people although the atmosphere is relaxed and comfortable. The patio at the back of the restaurant could be spruced up a bit more with some flowers, etc. We intend to keep going back."}
{"text":"Once upon a time, the food here was really good, not great, but really good. I don't know what happened over the past couple of years, but it's really taken a dive. The wait time for your order is ridiculous, yet your food arrives ~ cold! Forget about service if you're on the patio. Expect to go to the bar and serve yourself, it's the norm here. However; this IS a relaxed home-town pub environment. Everyone knows everyone and it does tend to get loud and boisterous at times. So to Sarah P. who whined and cried about people being rowdy and rude. She should dine at a high class restaurant in town rather than sit a local pub so as to avoid Streetsville \"degenerates\"!  :P"}
{"text":"Terrible service; had to go up to the bar to get a drink refill and the bill. My pint glass was chipped on top. Burger was overseasoned but the fries were great."}
{"text":"The food here is adequate. The drinks are fine. The service is decent to bordering on non-existent depending on who is serving you. It's a nice space with a lovely back patio, but the clientele are what keeps this restaurant on my Do Not Ever Go In Streetsville list.

Every time I have attempted to relax on their patio with a drink and a bite to eat, as a woman alone, I have been harassed by the customers of this place.  The last occurrence was so egregious I left near tears. I have not been back since, but on previous occasions when I have been with my husband we were bothered by the patrons -- people playing music out loud on their phones and just being generally very rowdy and rude. 

It is unfortunate this place attracts who it does. I watched, disappointed, when this building was Midtown restaurant and it closed because nobody appreciated it.  It has been through a few changes since then, all going under because the only people who it draws, fairly or unfairly, is degenerates."}
{"text":"Service was terrible. They blamed it on being \"really busy\" but there was only four tables filled in the whole room. Our server was crazy, she kept on tripping everywhere and forgetting stuff. I thought she was on crack. Everything we needed we had to ask for it I.e menu, cutlery, bill. The only good experience that came out from this was when our server gave back more than the amount of change needed after we paid -she calculated it wrong."}
