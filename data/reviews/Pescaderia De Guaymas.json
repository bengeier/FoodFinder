{"text":"Super nice and helpful, they have ceviche Friday-Sunday. For those who don't know what that is it's like a delicious shrimp salad. Has tomato, lime, shrimp, cilantro, cucumber. They speak both Spanish and English and told me in the near future they will have a frier to fry your fish! :)"}
{"text":"This is a relatively new fish market.  It is of Mexican origin.  I have been watching this location for the last 1.5 months since I saw the sign when driving by on University Drive, wondering when they will open.  Well, they are open now.  My wife, of Vietnamese origin, and I decided to see what was up.  We went in on 01/14/2017.  It is a small fish market.  The staff was friendly.  It was a man and woman.  They had some various fresh seafood and fish (octopus, snails/caracol, shrimp, and others).  A lot of it looked fresh.  It even impressed my wife, who knows fresh fish and seafood, coming from Vietnam.  She almost wanted to purchase some of their jumbo shrimp, but decided not to.  We have too much seafood at home to eat through, and now space in our fridge.  We will be coming back, and this time to buy some of the shrimp if they are good.  It will save us the trip to Rocky Point in Mexico.  We wish this business well.  We definitely want them to thrive and be successful.  One of the attendants gave me their card, and told me that if we desired some kind of seafood that was not displayed, to contact them.  They may have it in storage, or they can order it for us.  I will consider it.    Perhaps, they will eventually have more choices.  Otherwise, it will be difficult competing with the Asian markets on Dobson Road, and also on Broadway Road, with their huge seafood departments.  I wish them well.  That shopping strip they are in never has seemed to quite recover since the Fry's Supermarket there closed.  That location needs more successes."}
