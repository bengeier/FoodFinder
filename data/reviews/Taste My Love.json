{"text":"Everything we've tried is very good. You can tell the chef is passionate about his cooking. Lots of good stuff on the menu, creative and flavorful. They also add daily specials which I believe they announce on their Facebook page. 

Macaroni & Cheese is my favorite side dish...the one here is delicious! I'd make the drive for this when my mac & cheese craving kicks in. 

My husband is particular about his chicken wings and this place nails them! They're dipped in flour & fried just the way he likes them. 

My daughter eats pretty healthy so she wanted a salad. They have a couple on the menu but she asked if they had a Caesar and they made it for her with no problem. A Steak & Shrimp Caesar, she was in heaven! 

The food here matches the service. They're friendly and attentive. I recommend this cafe for anyone looking for some good soul food! Or good food period."}
{"text":"Amazing food  the chef is extremely passionate which is shown in every dish i have tried there"}
{"text":"The owner James is super pleasant and passionate about his cooking. This is my 3rd time eating at this restaurant and each time I have been amazed by his food and customer service. For this to be a new restaurant it's running quite smoothly just need to tweak a few things and iron out a few simple things. I would definitely recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and the staff makes you feel welcome. I like the art and enjoyed talking to the other customers. Everyone was very friendly. They have weekly specials that are delightful and the best part is the food is very affordable. Check them out when you can and will be glad you did."}
{"text":"I really liked this spot for the honesty and integrity of the food. 

Down home cooking, no frills. 

I had the meatloaf, which came with a side of mashed potatoes, collard greens, and saut√©ed vegetables. 

I'd have liked the slice of meatloaf to have been a bit larger, but it was very tasty and there were ample amount of sides, which were all fresh. 

I want to go go back and try the catfish next!"}
{"text":"Upon walking into this beautiful establishment we were greeted with a warm smile from the cashier. She very attentive, helpful, understanding and patient. My wife & I reviewed the menu and ordered Shrimp & Grits + Catfish Dinner. The chefs took their time preparing our meals. The presentation of the food was done well. Our food came out nice and hot. It was seasoned to our liking and the portion sizes we're great. We HIGHLY RECOMMEND Taste My Love restaurant! Can't wait to try some more of there dishes."}
{"text":"I go here today for the first time with my mouth set on a order of the throw it in the bag and not only was the \"hostess\" less than enthused to be there let alone pleased to see me walk thru the door she informed me that was on the old menu and didn't bother to throw out a alternative...needles to say I ended up going to teriyaki madness"}
{"text":"A nice welcoming atmosphere, good location. We were greeted as soon as we came in. We placed our orders and the food came out pretty quick. There was a miscommunication and my son didn't get his food but the owner worked to correct the problem.  The shrimp and grits was flavorful and the hash browns were good too. The chicken tenders and fries was a good meal for my growing nephew, it was only sauce left on the plate. Overall a good experience with good food."}
{"text":"Lovely Restaurant!!

My friend and I stopped into this delicious hidden gem Friday afternoon for some food made with love!!

This decor is gorgeous, the artwork is powerful and the aroma is refreshing!!

I ordered the \"Itty Bitty\" which is three catfish sliders with tasty siracha aioli!!! The bread was grilled the catfish was nice and brown and the sauce was soo good. The presentation was impressive. Especially as a to go order. $10

This food is definitely prepared with love and I'll be back soon for some shrimp and grits! 
 

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Oh where do I start? The food here is amazing and made with love. Th chef delivered the plates and made sure everything was perfect. The space is a nice size and the art on the wall is beautiful. 

We ordered two French Boy's which came with 3 whole chicken wings, eggs, and three pieces of French toast. 

I will be back every time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"My new favorite spot! The catfish was crispy not greasy loved it. We also tried there twist on nachos, it had shrimp and chicken on it with house made fresh tortilla chips. And while I was there you know I had to try the grits and I was not disappointed! If you want great food and to try something new stop by and give them a try."}
