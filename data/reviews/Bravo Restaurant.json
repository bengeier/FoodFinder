{"text":"I've been to Bravo twice in the past month and shared most items on the menu with friends and all walked away very impressed. The burgers are their bread and butter, and they're appropriately great -- the First Base is one of the best basic burgers I've had in the city, juicy and tender with the perfect amount of old cheddar and bacon. We sampled a bunch of their snacks which were all fantastic also; the mozza sticks in particular were awesome. And for dessert, the campfire cannoli -- a stellar cannoli loaded with roasted marshmallow -- blew our minds.  But what I really want to compliment is the service. Everyone here is friendly and attentive, and when we came in to watch the Jays' Wild Card game, they passed around free shots to the whole place after the good guys won. All in all, stellar food, stellar people. Great casual spot for an easygoing night out."}
{"text":"I'm probably going to get a lot of flack for this given the opinions on best burger out there...so here goes: I think this is the best burger in the City. The quality of the meat is exceptional. It's more like a perfectly cooked steak flavour. Simple, not over salted (like some of the so called top shelf gourmet burger places out there) and the original toppings...outstanding! They've only been open just under a month. My kids had the simple \"First Base burger and devoured it. My wife had the Palmerston and loved the unique flavours. And I had the Milano (perfectly cooked rapini that complemented the meat...not an afterthought for such a bold topping). Great desserts and friendly staff. Very hip atmosphere with upbeat lounge music just the right volume to keep you toe tapping while enjoying a conversation. You can feel the chef's pride in your meal!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Plaza Fiesta and it was great.  This Greek place is good considering the price.  I had a gyro, greek salad, and some hummus and was very satisfied!"}
{"text":"Their burger is fantastic. At first I was unsure because of the price but once we tried it out we saw that it was well worth it. The portion  is huge and the flavour is even bigger. I can't believe they've been open over a month and only have one review ..and a bad one at that !  As an appetizer we tried the mozzarella sticks, which was smoked mozzarella breaded in house and served with a habanero sour cream. We also had a few oysters and tried their kilpatrick which is 2 torch cooked oysters with double smoked bacon and worcestershire sauce. For 5 bucks it was great; you can't get this anywhere else.  For the main I had the first base which is a plain burger with the typical topping of lettuce tomatoes pickle and onion, and added cheese and their thick cut bacon. We also tried the Milano which my friend was really happy with.  I would definitely recommend this place and have been back more than once (and they amaze me every time). I really hope the neighbourhood catches on soon; I believe this is just what dundas west has been waiting for!"}
{"text":"DECEMBER EDIT: in the name of rooting for restaurants who improve their game based on feedback, I want to mention that they have lowered the prices of their burgers and tweaked their menu since the time of the below review. I'll update my review when I've actually experienced the differences.  We stopped in for some burgers and beers, as Bravo Restaurant has opened in the old Cafe Bar Pasta space on Dundas Street West. Their windows were emblazened with the words \"burger bar\" which made my excited on first arrival. I later learned that this is from the founders of Queen Margherita Pizza. I'm not sure how long they've been open, but the place was pretty empty when we came.   The interior is very much the same as it was under the previous business, although have more individual tables and less communal seating. But it still has the wine cork wall installation when you come in, and the somewhat awkward bar area that splits the room yet doesn't allow for seating at it.  The menu is broken into 4 sections: Starters (salads, oysters, bruschetta type stuff priced $12-$16), Burgers ($14-$18), Snacks (fries, mozza sticks, hush puppies priced at $7-$10), and Dessert ($6-7).  The First Base Burger ($14) seemed to be the sort of baseline standard burger so I ordered one of these with cheese and bacon ($2 each). I must say... I was not impressed for an $18 burger. The burger was literally oozing with aoili, to the point where my hands were covered with saucey drippings. As well, I have to say their bacon is terrible. It's double smoked, but super thin and over sized in the length its cut. It hangs over the sides of the burger so looks good at first until you realize its not actually covering much of burger, and worst yet it just tastes burnt and dry, completely overwhelming the rest of the sandwiches flavours. Literally as I walked home it was the only flavour left in my mouth.  The frites on the side were what I can only describe as the worlds thinnest potato wedge. Very crispy and what I guess could be considered unique on first few bites, but didn't really do it for me on the whole, especially as you get to the harder and dryer pieces as the meal goes on.  Beers are $8 a pint, wine is $5 a glass for the house wine or $9 for the better options, and $12 for custom cocktails. All fairly reasonable offers and no complaints on this front.   I must say, I really wanted to like this place, and I'm sure as they grow and tweak their menu that things will get better, but as of the time of this review, the food needs work. As soon as you cross the $15 threshold in burgers, its got to actually deliver. In our experience, we left full but un-enthused."}
{"text":"Good food,  nice atmosphere, friendly staff, great music. A solid addition to the area, I would recommend if you're a fan of burgers. One suggestion: the bathroom is so dark that I initially thought the light was off. You don't need to be able to see every inch of it, but it's a little weird to have creepy bathroom mood lighting."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot!  Love the Gyro and the Pita Chips!"}
{"text":"Real Homemade Greek Cusine.  Moderate Price, however nice portions.  I had the Gyro Special with Fries and a drink for about $6.00.  I also had the Humus plater, of course with the fried pita bread, a must in my opinion.  Friendly staff, CLEAN, and the only restaurant in the Mall that I know of that gave FREE refills."}
{"text":"Out of all the eateries in this mall, Bravo is my second favorite. Second because I have a soft spot for real Mexican food which the Mexican eatery in there offers. But no other eatery in the food court comes close to Bravo. The staff is always very friend and willing to recommend items or things that will go well with your order. Their pitas and gyros are excellent.  But the real reason why you want to go to Brave is their fried pita bread chips. I've never seen this anywhere else and those chips are insanely good with Tzatsiki. That's it. You need to know NOTHING else. Get off your butt, go to Bravo and order fried pita bread chips with Tzatsiki. NOW!"}
