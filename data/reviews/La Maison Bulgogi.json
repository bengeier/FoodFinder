{"text":"I used to live in Montreal and Maison Bulgogi was one of my favorite. I love love love Korean food and I always have a craving for it. So after 9 yrs away, I can't wait to taste the food there again. But I was disappointed. Big time. I don't recognize the Korean food taste. You know, there's that unique sesame-ish taste that is quite distinct... Nope, the taste is bland and blah. The service was pretty bad. There were barely anyone when we were there, and the waiter did not even bother to check on us. Our glass were empty for quite awhile, while the waiter was there talking to his friends. I am wondering though, if the owner changed. I mean, 9 yrs is a long time. I heard the people in the counter were mainly speaking Mandarin. Hmm... And one more thing, the bathroom is filthy!"}
{"text":"This wasn't my first time eating here, I always look forward to coming back. Not only is the food amazing, but so is the hospitality. Their menu is so vast, coming to you in a soft binder, the only problem is not knowing what to order because everything is delicious. They also have a great barbecue option, however, just remember my previous warning about indoor Korean barbecue: the smell will permeate your clothes and will radiate a five foot field around you, animals will follow you home and people will move away from you in the metro... and you'll smell like barbecue."}
{"text":"Food: Ok another Korean disappointment~ Sure all my friends know about this place but I think more due to its convenient location. The menu actually sets confusion, Korean, Chinese and Japanese all at the same time? And a kitchen run by Chinese people? I have nothing against my own folks but unless I can't read, doesn't the name say Bulgogi? Fine, what about the food? BLAND! yes BLAND. Even the \"famous\" pork bone stew lacked flavor, oh Bulgogi how disappointing!

Service: Maybe when we went the waiters were unhappy that day but very rude! Oo I even got hot water spilled on me, no apologies, thank you~ aka not coming back~

Price: Not worth it~

Ambiance: Homey style decor, lots of spaces to accommodate groups. Kitchen semi-open."}
{"text":"Brought my friend here while I was visiting Montreal.  He never had Korean food before.  He said he enjoyed it a lot.  As for me, the food was good.  Clean establishment and the service was good."}
{"text":"Located between Atwater and Concordia, La Maison Bulgogi is easily accessible. Having been to most of the Korean restaurants downtown, I decided to give this one a shot. The decor is very old-fashioned and it would probably need renovations. The place was almost empty when we came for dinner. 

If you're looking for authentic Korean food then this place isn't it. The menu is very extensive and had a mix of everything, but the food itself wasn't too great. We ordered the kimchi pancake (which was bland, oily and didn't have enough kimchi), the bibimbap (average in size and taste), and - what else- the bulgogi. For a place called La Maison Bulgogi, I expected the meat to be good  but it was overcooked and way too oily. 

The staff was also rather unprofessional and did not fill our water even once for the one hour and half we stayed. Portions are average and on the pricey side. 

Overall, I wouldn't go again."}
{"text":"This place comes highly recommended from my Korean friend. So I figured, it should be pretty good eh? And YES.

My friend told me that the owners are Koreans who lived in Northern China, so they spoke both Korean and Chinese, which I think is pretty cool. They're not like the other Korean restaurants where you'd listen to Kpop or watch Kdrama all the time. It's actually got a quite minimalistic decor, with incandescent light and all. I think it's their way of saying \"My food is so good that you don't have to pay attention to other things.\"  Whatever the reason is, the owners have always been nice to me. Moreover, they're located next to a Korean grocer. So whenever I have Korean food cravings, I'll go there and stop by next door for some Kimchi"}
{"text":"I go to Seoul Chako so much, my friend suggested we come here for a change...

It was nice to try something different. The menu is quite extensive, they have spicy stir fry stuff, and kim chi jiggae, and korean pan cake. They probably have more dishes here than all the other korean restos in mtl, but they don't have any pictures hahaha so unless you know what it is you won't know what you're ordering lol.

We ordered the chicken beef and pork bbq meal for two, and a pan cake. you have to overlook the decor here it's not a fancy place, very casual, some would even say ghetto :P

The things I appreciate from this place is that they have the korean hot sauce right on the table, me likes :P  and the meal comes with a heap worth of lettuce for you to wrap your bbq meat in. I'll definitely come back for the non bbq fare, I saw some stuff I really want to try."}
{"text":"You know when you stumble upon a hole-in-the-wall that surprises and delights you?  Keep walking; this ain't it.

We're immediately suspicious because the haemul pahjun (seafood pancake, sort of) is oval.  An oval mass of glutinous and overfried abomination.  The banchan is underwhelming, even though we're famished and could have eaten dirt at that point.  There's haemul dubbap (mixed rice with seafood) and bibimbap (another type of mixed rice, this time with meat), but they won't make me a haemul bibimbap.  So I order the regular bibimbap, minus the meat, but instead of the symphony of tastes I expect, the ingredients present a sum that is so much less than its parts.

Diclaimer: I have no first-hand knowledge of the eponoymous dish.  I hear it's decent, hence the second star."}
{"text":"I went there with my gl last week, and we had a horrible experience. First of all, the service was fking piece of shit, waitress no smile at all. we ask him to get a hot water, he said no hot water, and bring the hot tea for us which was fine. Then i said thank you, but he got no respond at all. I went there first time, asked sth about the menu, and the waitress getting mad. After the food came, those little dishes taste ok, but one of the seaweed salad taste sting. feels like a dead fish inside of it. The only thing is they have gamjatang,  but still taste like traditional korean food and It was too sweet. Finally, we went to the check out, i paid for the dinner, and wait for some changes. I still gave them 15% tips, and he still \"0 thank you\" with his fking mad face. I would never come back and recommend any of my friend to come to this restaurant. Never Ever Again!"}
{"text":"The food is quite nice and not that expensive. Very friendly atmosphere, they just treat everyone like family. 
They could use some redecoration though."}
{"text":"I must say that my friend and I are very disappointed by this place. First of all, the decor is very outdated and we found the service rude, like they didn't even care about their clients. Also, the food tasted SO bland. I got the beef bibimbap and I had to add a ton of spicy sauce for it to taste anything.  My friend got the deonjang jiggae and she added soy sauce because it tasted like bad water. Plus, the beef bibimbap cost 2$ more than the vegetable one and there was only 3 small pieces of beef...
All this to say that it's one of the most depressing food experiences we've had. We are definitely NEVER coming back. Sorry not sorry."}
{"text":"It was so bad. The food was presented poorly. The decor is boring. The staff doesn't greet you or come to see if you like the food or fill up your water or whatever. My friend got food she didn't like and she complained and the waitress did nothing all and the chicken legit tasted like ass. Afterwards we had to wait 20 minutes until we got the attention of another waiter who got the man (I'm guessing the man who owned the place) and she was asking if she can pay half price which he said she can't but offered another dish. She asked for stir fry and beef and we had to wait another half an hour and by then we were all mad so we got up to pay and she got her food finally at the cash and took it for takeout. While we were paying the boss was annoyed at us and he showed it too and then he had the nerve to say \"the tips not included\" I'm not tipping you if you're services are terrible. So really don't go there ever. The food is overpriced when it tastes like crap and it looks unhygienic the place too.  Oh and the food they gave her to replace the other one was just ass bad and she ended up giving it away"}
{"text":"5 stars for their excellent service. 3 stars for the soft tofu with beef soup. Portion of beef was generous but a little tough. Soup had good flavor and was not too salty or spicy."}
{"text":"Snowstorm on that day. I was looking for something to warm me up. BOOM Korean food. 
I've been there a few times, but this one was my best experience so far.
Looking through the menu, I didn't know what to choose. 
I went for some pork belly first. (Need to try it ahah)
I wanted a shabu shabu as main dish, but the one on the menu wasn't very attractive. I saw a poster on the wall with tasty tofu, ham, sausage, dumplings, noodles, kimchi, cheese, ramen noodle, mushrooms, etc. I asked the waiter which shabu shabu is the closest to the picture on the wall. He said that it wasn't on the menu, but he could make it for me if I wanted to. 
Korean army shabu shabu. There we go. \"When you order something that is not on the menu.\"
Pork belly came first with the side dishes. 
Thumbs up to the korean side dishes (y). 
Pork belly came with a sauce. Tasty :D
Then the waiter brought the shabu shabu pot and warm the mountain of food. 
He, later, brought the ramen noodle. 
For 2 people with the pork belly, we ate a lot. I was so full. Spicy, tasty, lots of meat, super warm. Never felt so good eating Korean hotpot. 
He went out of soup in the middle and the waiter gave us extra soup. Good service. 
Overall good experience. Cost us a good 60$+ (tips, tax included) 
Pricey, but if you watched Korean drama and want a good shabu shabu experience, you won't be disappointed haha."}
{"text":"Probably one of the worst dining experiences in the area. Do yourself a favour and walk down the street to mon ami if you want korean."}
{"text":"It was really awful experience ever ! 
The food was not really good and not fresh 
I couldn't eat at all food 

Save your money"}
{"text":"The place was really... amateur.

I can't understand how my girlfriend was served 10 minutes after me, it was pretty awkward waiting for her dish while mine was getting cold. The restaurant wasn't even full, 3 tables at most.

I had the Kimchi Fried Rice, while she had some sort of Seafood Stir-Fry. I think the long wait was because it takes time to thaw the frozen seafood. The fried rice was really good, but slightly under-seasoned (hooray for Gochujang!), the seafood dish was bland, overcooked, and very watery.

It really went downhill comparing to my last experience here few years ago, portion was much smaller and more pricey, the tables were dirty and the service was just honestly bad.

The food was authentic by the way, but they could really work on their service."}
{"text":"One of the worst korean restaurant. NOTHING positive to say. From the service to food. The waiters didn't come even a single time after they brought the food. Food was awful. We are definitely never coming back again."}
{"text":"Cheap (lots of stuff around $9-12), but still not worth it. Despite the name \"La Maison Bulgogi\", it's really more of a Korean-Chinese-Japanese rice/noodle dish place. You'll find Korean dishes like bibimbap but also teriyaki and Japanese noodles. I think it's run by Chinese people, the kitchen and servers were all speaking Chinese together.

My japchae was crazy greasy and they totally skimped on the beef. Very mediocre. My friend's bibimbap was meh, and the egg was at the bottom instead of the top? I think there are just way too many things on the menu, I think there were over 100 items. When leaving I noticed most people had a soup (pork bone?) so maybe that's the one thing they do well. 

I don't have any complaints about the service, it was fine. They take debit and visa but no mastercard. It's not too busy of a place so if you want to have a long meal without feeling rushed, this is a good place for that."}
{"text":"Where do I start...

I recently had some really good Pork Bulgogi in Toronto that was AMAZING, so I found La Maison Bulgogi in Montreal and decided to try it. What a disappointment, it was bland and the portion was small. We also some chicken wings that were decent but overall AVOID AT ALL COST....

The decor was gross, tables are some sort of weird tables that your legs do not fit under. The price was very high for what you actually get."}
{"text":"Really some of the worst Korean out there.

I always passed by this busy place thinking it must be so authentic and I would always push back my visit to next time.

Inside is unimpressive , we were at the back on chairs that did not match and our only decoration was the stepladder strewn about.

Onto the food, I asked for #18 Dol Sot Bi Bim Bab 
(rice with mixes vegetables, beef in a hot stone pot with spicy sauce).
The waiter said there's not a lot of meat in the dish and recommended a teriyaki dish. 

Not knowing the place, I figured he knows what he's talking about. Wrong,  the ingredients were fresh but the taste was really foul,  really sweet and cloying.

My friend had the bulgogi dish (the name of the place, so must be good).

This dish was even worse, it's supposed to be Korean BBQ,  but it tasted burnt and sweet.

There is over 100 dishes on the menu, so can't comment on the others, so I would rather skip this place altogether rather than trying them all and maybe finding a good dish."}
{"text":"As it was approaching 9pm and some of the classic spots downtown were closing, my friends and I were rushing to find a place to eat. We stumbled upon La Maison Bulgogi and decided to give it a shot. 
I honestly have not been more disappointed by a restaurant before. NOTHING positive to say, from the service to the food, if you can even call it food. Our waiter seemed to have had a particularly bad day as it was reflecting on his attitude towards the customers. Our orders were taken after a VERY long while (about 20 mins) and each of them were supposed to come with a miso soup, which we received ice cold at the end of our meal. 
I ordered the bulgogi as I thought it would be a safe bet. Never have I been more wrong. The beef was so dry I really wasn't sure which day it was made. The whole dish was covered with this sweet sauce which seemed like it belonged on a candied apple. I somehow managed to finish the vegetables but even those tasted like pure disappointment. While trying to push down everything by chugging my glass of water (which they didn't bother refilling obviously), I realized that my bulgogi was somehow the best dish out of the 4 on our table. One of my friends ordered this tofu and rice dish which I tried a bite of. The best word I have to describe it would be emptiness. Emptiness of texture, flavor, seasoning and care. 

The prices were around 15-20$ after tax, which is basically robbery for the experience we've had.

If you think I'm exaggerating in any way, I myself regretted deeply not looking this place up on Yelp and seeing some of the reviews before entering."}
{"text":"Of all of the Korean restos in Montreal, this is probably my favorite. 

1) The menu is.. HUGE. You'll find noodle dishes, rice dishes, bbq meat dishes, pancakes, soup dishes, etc. They do not really have pictures on their menu so if you are not very familiar with Korean food then I recommend the following method: Close your eyes, flip through the menu and randomly put your finger down. Open and voila order what your finger landed on ;) 

2) They actually give you side dishes! Yay.. something that is surprisingly not that common in Montreal.

3) They have some pretty cool lunch specials

Despite the fact that the ambiance is bare basic and a little old, the place is always busy and seems to attract a lot of regular customers. The cooks and servers seem to be comprised of a group of male buddies that come to hangout yet work at the same time. 

If you would like to be adventurous then order the Korean beef tartar, or the pork soup which comes with a single clear glove that you use to pick the meat off of the bones. Be aware that if you order the pork soup be prepared to encounter a lot of stares from people watching you eat soup with a glove."}
{"text":"Just a little update, I had their kimchi jjigae and it was really good! They could make stuff vegetarian too, which is obviously awesome. Also, the waiter working there was really cute"}
{"text":"Very unusual taste for a commonly-named Korean restaurant. You may observe that some the staff is Chinese but from Korean descent (Northern China probably) and the food actually reflects this aspect. Long story short: Korean food with Chinese particularities. 

Consequently, what you would traditionally order from a Korean restaurant will taste different than expected. First, note that menu is very rich and contains as many Chinese and Korean dishes. I opted for a $34 BBQ meat selection for two. Despite the familiar Korean name of the preparation, the sauce used was way more Soyu-based than usual Korean food. I thus felt that the fusion was interesting and very personal. Note that the food comes with the traditional side dishes such as Kimchi. Aside from what I had, there seem to be some interesting lunch specials.

Not an outstanding experience but differently worth trying for a lunch."}
{"text":"It is the best korean cuisine i tried in montreal so far. The potato pork bone soup is very good and the portion is large. The price is very reasonable! I will definately come back."}
{"text":"Absolument fan des Bar BQ !
C'est d'ailleurs la seule chose que nous y mangeons ! Ils retirent le centre de table et déposent une sorte de plancha en forme de chapeau chinois. Puis ils viennent cuisiner devant vous les plats sélectionnés. Cela vient avec une soupe, et plein de mini plats remplis d'\"apéro\".
Pour info : la demi salade servie permet de faire des nems ! On pose du riz, de la viande, des légumes, et de la sauce piquante dedans. Puis on roule tout ça et on mange !! Nous avons découvert cela en regardant manger les gens qui y viennent (tous d'originie asiatique !).
Nota : ne pas s'arrêter à la vitrine de supermarché et à la déco kitsch au possible ;)"}
{"text":"Ill be honest that its not a 5 stars place at all however it suits our needs perfectly and thus it gets 5 stars. 
We are 2 adults with 2 young children and have eaten there 10+ . 
- Great Service, staff is always polite and make you feel great even when the kids break or spill something.  They already know that we need to be served fast before the kids turn. 
- We all like the food, we take 3 orders usually, Bibimbab, Chapche and Bulgogi. Switch it up sometimes to try something new. We were never disappointed.
- Great value, $45 feeds the whole family with healthy ingredients not fast food 
We have visited many other Korean restaurants but always come back to Maison Bulgogi. Other recent Korean restaurants we visited are Omma, Shabu Shabi, Seol BBQ etc on the St Catherine stretch.
At the end its not the decor but what you eat and how you feel about it and we feel satisfied 5 Stars worth.
Thank you very much.

{"text":"AVOID THIS PLACE.
The place is grim, with half of the space closed(at least looks so). The staff? Not very welcoming. The whole service just looks very unregulated. The food tastes funny, I felt the soup is made with some weird chemicals instead of pork.But those are not the point.The worst part is I went to this restaurant and felt bad until I threw up everything. This is the first time I write anything on yelp, just to inform all people who are kinda interested in this place of one piece of message:Get out of here unless you want food poisoning?"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good at least for the stuff I always ordered. Like their pork and tofu kimchi soup or the pork bone. I saw people using glove eating it so weird so I quietly judge them lol. In all weirdness still like that soup. The owner looks like one of those characters from Korean dramas (if you watch any you'll see what I mean). I just like her quiet but cheerful vibe. It feels a bit homie and their food is pretty good for me"}
{"text":"Ordered take out and got the wrong order. They put more veggies than meat. (Also not very sure what meat this was). Fried chicken has tons of flour. Not worth going, especially when there is better korean restaurants a few meters away (MonAmi or Ganadara). Not going again."}
{"text":"We went on a Friday night and it was busy.  We ordered bugogi and ta su seafood.  Bugogi was on the sweet side and not great.  Ta su seafood was a complete miss, too fried, no flavor.  Each table got 4 side dishes.  The service was decent."}
{"text":"This was probably the worst restaurant experience of my life. Went in with a few friends after a long day and server only came to us after 25 minutes of waiting. We ordered our food and waited another half hour (if not more) and the food was disgusting! Overpriced bad food. And the worst part is they didn't even bring my food. My friends didn't even finish their plates. Don't go there it's not worth it."}
{"text":"The menu is extensive, tons of variety - good service. But like others have mentioned, the decor is sparse, and almost very ghetto.

However with that said, the prices were ok - and the food was tasty. They provided an assortment of salads, kimchi at the beginning of the meal. 

They offered BBQ on the table, which is a major plus! And the prices are good too. all in all, very reasonable, but nothing to go crazy about."}
{"text":"To be succinct: the food is acceptably palatable, the service is swift but unprofessional, and the ambiance is reminiscent of a canteen from the Third World; ideal for a quick fix.

The moment I entered, a casually dressed man (who could easily have been mistaken for a patron) greeted me in Mandarin and directed me to an empty table. The table was somewhat dirty and wobbly. A young waitress took my order while making subservient nods, and as soon as she turned her back, yelled piercingly my order at the kitchen.

As with any typical Korean meal, I was first served \"banchan\" (small appetizers): kimchi, seasoned soybean sprouts, braised potatoes, and seaweed salad. The proportions and taste were adequate, but nothing to write home about. My entree, \"Uk Gae Jang\" (spicy soup made form shredded beef and vegetables), arrived promptly. It looked as I expected: fiery red and steam rising from the stew.

However, I was slightly but not entirely let down by my first spoonful. It wasn't terribly bad, but it was not very good either. It lacked punch, boldness, and consistency. The soup was watery and not as spicy compared to what I had had in Korea. The meat was tender, but wasn't juicy enough and difficult to chew. 

Overall, my experience here is very consistent with the cliched adage: you get what you pay for. I would come back because of the value and the speed."}
{"text":"The décor of the place could use a major upgrade, the ambience was that of a greeny/blue McDonalds, except there were grills in your table to bbq meat. 

We ordered much more than necessary and the reasoning behind it is that we have our must-try at every Korean Restaurant dishes, and also because we really wanted to bbq our own food. The restaurant does not allow for self bbq'ing when you order only a single plate of meat, so we took to ordering both the chicken and beef.  We also ordered the beef bibimbap and the rice cake in spicy sauce. 

The Banchan (Korean side dishes) were a bit of a disappointment. The kimchi was not spicy, the beans sprouts were lackluster, instead of spinach we got kelp, but the potatoes were good. 

The chicken and beef did taste good, but not particularly special if compared to any of the other Korean restaurants in town. On top of that though, our server took the liberty to do all the bbq'ing for us, even though we wanted to do it on our own and told him so. 

The bibimbap was also ok, but nothing to write to Yelp about. As with all the other dishes, that should have a bit of a spicy kick to it, the rice cake dish, was also not spicy. They did have the good soju there, and as for beer, domestic Molson, Chinese beer Tsing Tao, but I did wonder why they wouldn't have gone with Sapporo instead.

With many different options of Korean BBQ in town, I don't think that this will be a place that I will frequent again anytime soon."}
{"text":"The food here was delicious! One of the cheapest and authentic meals we got while in Montreal. We got the 4 side dishes to start wth, they were all very flavorful (and free). 

We order a Kim Chi Jagae? A spicy kim chi stew, it was faboulous. We also ordered a bim bim bap, which was okay. We got bulgogi and a meat special that came with pork, chicken, and beef to cook at your table, all were marinaded nicely. We got white rice with each with the meats. They also gave us a huge side of lettuce to wrap the meat in. Over all the food was delish, service was nice, you can tell its family owned and operated. 

The decor is simple mom and pop shop, but to me if the food is good everything else doesn't matter all that much. The bathroom was dirty but most smaller resturants are...Would def eat there again."}
{"text":"J ai attendu avant d ecrire ma critique, je suis allee plusieurs fois a la maison du bulgogi et voici ce que j ai contaste a chaque fois:

Cuisine coréenne avec un bon rapport qualite-prix!
Vous aurez un choix tres large de ce que la cuisinee coreenne peut vous offrir.

par contre, vous devez faire abstraction de tout le reste:  service exécrable, tables et chaises et collantes...

c est vraiment dommage!"}
{"text":"Bulgogi stumps me. It pays little attention to detail. It's decor is very dated. The walls are painted this weird green. It's cleanliness seems questionable. And yet, I don't really care. The food is great. 

My date at the time (who was also Korean) took me there and ordered my meal for me. Forgive me for not remembering the title; I'll try my best to describe it. The dish was a bowl of noodles covered in what looked like black ink. I know now that it must have been an oyster sauce base of some sort, because the saltiness of it was very distinctive. Anyway, this bowl is presented in front of me alongside a pair of chopsticks and pair of scissors. Confused as to what the scissors were for, I ignored them and tried my best to chopstick my way through this dish. LOL, my date must have thought. These thick white noodles were not only covered in this is thick black sauce, they were also uncut. There must have been 3 noodles in the bowl but it pretty much filled the bowl to the top. Finally grasping the scissors purpose, I picked them up and started scissoring my noodles into manageable bites. By this point my mouth and chin were already covered in black ink but this was really my last concern. As disgusted as I was in using these questionable scissors to cut my noodles, I was also really excited to shovel more of these noodles into my mouth. It was an unexpected surprise, I'll tell ya.

Since that first experience, I've gone back to have their general Tao and try their hot pot, and each experience has gotten better. I would definitely recommend this place to check out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I ordered a bowl of cold noodle, and it was the most horrible cold noodle I've ever had. The soup is water I suppose. Few sautéed beef in it. And there was no kimchi in it. Instead, they put some weird Chinese pickled turnips in it, and it smells like fart (no offence I've had great Chinese pickle before). I only paid 50cents for tips, and the cashier seemed so angry but whatever I'll never go again.
Another experience I had here earlier, for kimchi bibimbap (sautéed kimchi with rice). The rice seemed to be over nights and it stuck together, the interior of the stuck rice ball is cold. I should've not come here the second time, but I made a huge mistake to give it another chance."}
{"text":"I went to Bulgogi house.
It takes 3minites on foot from the atwater station.
You can find it easily.
the restaurant is acceptable to korean who miss mom's cooking or the food from home.
The flavor is very similar to food in korea.
Price is cheap and the service is good.
They are fast to serve dishes.
I give 5 stars to Bulgogi restaurant."}
{"text":"worst restaurant I've ever been in my life... The service was out of this world (in a bad way), the food was unexpectedly horrible, one of my friend didn't get his order until the end (he didn't even want to ask for it, he just never had his food)... I may sound harsh, but I went with a group of friend and our night flopped because of this really bad experience...The food was not worth the price at all.."}
{"text":"I must say, I am really surprised by some of the bad reviews. I confess, I am not Korean, however I lived just blocks from Korea Town in Los Angeles for years and as such I spent a lot of time in its restaurants (and its karaoke bars too, but those stories are for another time); I feel that La Maison Bulgogi definitely has something special to offer. First, the food is really good! There are no extra flourishes, so do not expect a raw carrot magically cut into a swan on your plate. No, eating at La Maison Bulgogi is like eating your Korean grandmother's house. The food is good and plentiful and so there is no chance that you will leave hungry and like a good Korean grandma's kitchen, the food is classically Korean and tasty, but not fancy. It should be mentioned that the price-point is extremely fair! We love to order the Korean BBQ and pick the meat selection based on our level of hunger. My husband and I come here regularly, in fact, we are at La Maison Bulgogi more than any other restaurant in all of Montreal and we keep coming back because we really like the food and the attentive service."}
{"text":"Came here twice and honestly, the menu is quite a bit larger than I expected. Having tried two korean dishes, they were definitely good for the price (~10$) but nothing too special. The decor wasn't much to gawk about. Great place for a quick bite to eat.

Like others have said, the restaurant is run by Chinese people despite it being a Korean resto so make of it what you will."}
{"text":"There aren't many Korean Restaurants in the  city and since I was in the neighbourhood, i thought might as well go in because the place was busy and I was craving Korean food.

I ordered a noodle soup with seafood. There were a few things that made me think, 'this is something I have never had before':

1.  There was not MSG in the soup base

2. The seafood was cooked perfectly.  The chef did not over cook the seafood til it was tough and rubbery.  

3. The noodles in the soup tasted as it was homemade.  When the menu says \"homemade noodles\", the restaurant really means it.  

After that meal, I am hooked onto eating more Korean noodle soup dishes.  I won't be touching BBQ for awhile."}
{"text":"Decided to stop by here during our recent trip over labor weekend.  Food was ok - nothing to call home about. I had bulgogi (which is shredded FYI) and the wife had tofu with squid stir fry. Was a decent meal at OK prices, but it didn't wow us and prompt a return visit.   Not quite what we would expect in a large metropolitan area, but if you are craving some kimchi or other Korean it will do the trick."}
{"text":"This place is nothing like the Korean BBQ here in Chicago. I was very disappointed which is saying a lot for a person such as myself. I am rarely picky, but La Maison Bulgogi was not that great. 

The service was too much for me. It wasn't that they were unfriendly, but when I go to Korean BBQ, I like to grill my own food at the table. The waiter kept coming to the table to turn our meat and take it off. We ~a group of four~ had two seasoned cooks at the table. We neither wanted nor asked for help cooking. 

In previous experiences eatting Korean BBQ, the workers changed the grill often so that it didn't stick and reduce the flavor in the meats. Here, they did not change the grill. 

When they brought the side dishes out. They only brought out 4 or 5 dishes where I am use to 10 to 15 side dishes. This was very disappointing. 

Another aspect that disappointed me was their lack of selections for people who are vegetarians. I understand that Korean BBQ is geared towards meat, but some people may want to bring a friend who is not a meat eater. 

Overall, the experience was not a pleasant one."}
{"text":"I have been here regularly. I only order their soups coming with rice. Never tried other dishes because soup is their specialty, and I have this impression that other dishes are not so genuine Korean dishes. 
My favourites are spicy tofu soup and bolgogi. 
All the soup comes with rice. They are so hearty and filling in a cold time. Tofu soup has a very soft and creamy tofu inside. The bolgogi is two big sets of pork bone with potato cooked for a long time. There are plastic gloves for you to hold the bone and devour. The kimchi soup is also recommended. 
They offer complimentary appetizers which you can ask for refill. Also hot tea for free. All the dishes are inexpensive, so student friendly. I used to hangout here regularly with my friends. 
If you like spicy food, their soups are must try."}
{"text":"I went to this resto with a few homies of mine 'n let me tell y'all, this place is wack. 

My ghetto ass orders take out. They hear me lound 'n clear and hand me this bag with my food. I pay 'n leave. 20 mins later, I open it and it's totally not what I ordered. 

Now I wouldn't be writin' this if the food they gave me was aight. Whatever the meat was, disgusting, couldn't even finish. 

Save yo' ass a few dollas 'n avoid this place. This ain't no true Korean resto. 

Oh, and if any of y'all get takeout at this place, ask 'em to open the damn thing so you can see they ain't tryin' to scam you."}
{"text":"high recommended!! its my first choice!! soft tofu soup is very good and cheap price. pork neck bone soup is my recommended one. and seafood pancake :D"}
{"text":"This restaurant has really changed since they switched owners! The food isn't the same nor the quality. As other reviewers have said, walk a bit further and go to places like MonAmi or Ganadara."}
{"text":"Three times, and they've have consistently impersonal/rude service. The menu is extensive, and can be confusing. The items served are inconsistent in portion sizes (large noodle dishes, little meat). They do have large meat portion menu items. The meat served here doesn't smell fresh (and if one can say that after it was cooked, then that's really bad), the taste was somewhat disconcerting in that it was rather bland. The final straw, however, is the hygiene, the server had her finger in our cups, bowls, etc as she served us. The soup actually tasted like dirty water, and last, but not least, hair in the noodles. No apologies by the staff. This place is close to me, so I wanted to give it a chance, but that 'third time was a charm'."}
{"text":"Went here because the line was too long at GaNaDaRa. Due to the reviews, I wasn't expecting much, but it turned out to be great! Super tasty Kimchi Jigae, Bibimbap, and various sides! Very fast service as well."}
{"text":"It used to be good. My recent two meals there are too salty and unpalatable. Service is below average. Place is dark. What's wrong?"}
{"text":"I was very excited when my friend told me about this place on Ste-Catherine because they serve Korean BBQ. We ordered two orders of kalbi/short ribs, korean pancake, and a dolsot bi bim bap because one of us is a vegetarian (not a good idea to come here because it's very meat oriented). 

We were given 4 side dishes to start the meal. Too little, I thought because I am usually given at least 10 different ones at other Korean restaurants. Maybe it's because of the lack of varieties, I felt that they tasted kinda bland.

For the BBQ, they used a curved hot steel pan with a gas stove. We started cooking some of the short ribs but we felt rushed because the server kept asking us to add more meat and turn them over when they started to change color. We found that extremely annoying because I thought the point of eating Korean BBQ is so that we can cook it ourselves at OUR pace. It didn't taste as I expected because the marinade was rather mediocre.

The pancake was super thick due to excessive batter and too little seafood. That was perhaps the last thing I need after the rice, soup, and oily kalbi that pretty much filled me up. I like mine thin, light and with lots of seafood. The bi bim bap wasn't that impressive either. My friend hardly had any of it. 

Overall, I am pretty disappointed with La Maison Bulgogi. They have other selections too but if they can't impress me with the classics, I won't even bother trying the rest. I highly recommend somewhere else for Korean food."}
{"text":"Well I usually don't bother with negative reviews, but I feel like I had to this time, to describe this exceptional(-ly bad) service, highlighting a server pointing his index at me, telling me to 'watch it' (to watch what I'm saying when I told him the bulgogi was dry af.), as if he has a Godfather.

For a restaurant calling itself 'Maison Bulgogi', I was hoping to get decent bulgogi (reasonable  train of thought, right?), but the reality hit hard when my food finally came up: the beef was as dry as cardboard. It is to my surprise, as a carnivore, that I'd finish the veggies (for once) before anything else, because the carrots were more flavorful than the beef. 

And the waiter insisted I pay 15% tips on the total (including taxes), which is ridiculous because I haven't seen him around the table a single time after he brought the food. That is, without mentioning him forgetting a miso soup. 

A couple of friends got the #18, which was essentially a bowl of white rice topped with 5 cubes of meat and some cheap veggies, for a splendid 10$. Now some people might think it's a good price, but let me tell you, it was bland to the point one of my friends suggested adding soy sauce (?!?!). If soya sauce, kim chi, AND hot sauce can't save that bowl of rice, I don't know why you're paying 10$. 10$ gets you at least 5kg of rice, enough to last you an apocalypse.

Ah, and I forgot to mention that these culinary mavericks serve a total of 108 different dishes (taken from their menu)."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery through ALCE. Perfectly happy w/ the delivery mechanics there: easy to order, everything was as ordered, and the delivery itself was quick. So La Maison Bulgogi and ALCE seemed to work well together in this instance (this is not always the case w/ other restaurants).

The food itself was ok - but definitely not the best Korean fare in town. My group and I ordered 4 main dishes and quality was consistent (in it's \"ok-ishness\") - no highs or lows. Alas, given the experience and the other options available, I don't think I'll repeat as a customer."}
{"text":"Excellent resto, rien de meilleur qu'un bon bulgogi"}
