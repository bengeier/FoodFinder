{"text":"Amazing restaurant. Calgary is stepping up! All the veggie dishes are to die for. Brocolini, ginger miso, tahini sauce all so good. Chicken entree also recommended.  Plus owner is SO COOL. Loved her vibe and ish."}
{"text":"First time at Ten Foot Henry - had a reservation for brunch/lunch with my friends and have to say we were not disappointed.  A very hip location with awesome decor and very relaxed vibe.   Can get a little loud when the restaurant is full but that did not take away from our experience.  Our server offered great suggestions and was very attentive.   We really enjoyed the food and make sure to leave room for some butterscotch pudding!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome! I had the Albertan drink that comes with foamed egg white and it was delicious! Ten Foot Henry has an amazing vibe, good service and we didn't have to wait long for our food."}
{"text":"My wife and i were in Calgary for the weekend and after a day of hiking in Canmore decided to check out somewhere to eat on yelp. As is often the case, the suggestions in other reviews were reliable and helpful. We enjoyed the atmosphere and service and although the prices are a bit high, most shared plates spots follow this pattern these days. That said, we enjoyed the diner and felt we got decent value.  We followed the suggestions from other reviews such as tomatoes with whipped feta, Gai lan and mushroom pasta.  Everything was good.  My only comment is that overall they are a bit heavy on the salt on all dishes. The coconut cake (one is enough for 2) is a nice way to end. Recommended.  Make a reservation for peak hours."}
{"text":"Food was delicious - staff was very accommodating to my food allergies. Our server was very friendly and knowledgable of the menu. Will be back !"}
{"text":"Really wonderful flavour creations and options here, love the tomatoes!!, and the ambiance feels fresh, lively and set perfectly for no fuss dining!  Been meaning to write a review for some time on the food, but I think what makes this place exceptional is the outstanding service we had. One night we had a reso for 5, including two vegan friends, which can be tricky for tapas/shared dining but our server really knew what he was doing, had plenty of recommendations, paced out our orders so everyone could have a bite with each round, just above and beyond service!  During my last visit the owner was around and she noticed I shared a unique name with her, so she came by to our table to say hi and introduce herself and we chatted a bit. Later when our bill came we were surprised to see she had comp'ed our desserts. It was just a cherry on top of our already amazing meal experience. I'll definitely be coming back around for another visit to try out the new seasonal changes in the menu!"}
{"text":"The place is good. Location is also good. It is easy to find. I like all the dishes! Beef and Spaghetti taste good. Salmon is also fine! First dinner in Calgary is impressive."}
{"text":"Friendly servers, nice dishes and amazing deserts. Totally would recommend friends to come."}
{"text":"Not sure what all the hype was about. I was disappointed, the salad tasted like lemon and wasn't very flavorful, the chicken was dry and the steak was ok. It was very crowded and everyone was really on top of one another and it was loud. Not really all that enjoyable. The service was quick and friendly though."}
{"text":"Food is good a little too expensive for some items. Good for a little get together but I always leave hungry. Sharing plates style. Great take on vegetables. Rusted beets are delicious"}
{"text":"I don't know how to describe this restaurant other than AMAZING, AMAZING and AMAZING. From the top notch service, even after being open only a few weeks to the simple and cozy decor, Ten Foot Henry will appeal to all types.  I love the focus on vegetable based dishes, but there are a few choices for those who like meat.  I honestly can't decide which of the 6 items we tried were my favourite.  They have a good variety of alcoholic and non alcoholic drinks.  I do highly recommend the coconut cake if it's available.  Cannot wait to visit again."}
{"text":"Only been here for brunch   Menu has decent gems on it, but the quality of of ingredients is better then most places   Staff is friendly and interior is very contemporary   Pricing is in line with others in this space"}
{"text":"I love the lunch and dinner menu! Everything on there is delicious. Service is prompt and friendly. I definitely want to try and pace myself so I can actually enjoy dessert next time! The space is comfortable and lively.  Brunch on the other hand was disappointing. You end up over ordering because everything comes separate. Our group of 5 each ordered 2 dishes each as they Don't come with sides. Hollandaise on the bennies was bland and Luke warm. The sourdough most of the fishes were presented on was too hard.   I would say skip brunch unless you get the quinoa bowl.   Little Henry next door is great!"}
{"text":"Loved this restaurant. The service was great, the food was AMAZING! I went with a bunch of girlfriends and we just ordered a few dishes and shared them, flavor is top notch.  Loved the pasta, we ordered two of them it was so good. Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Today was my third time at Ten Foot Henry - this time for brunch - and it was great.  I think value of money this is one of the best restaurants in Calgary + you get a great vibe.  Dishes are simple but cooked perfectly and delivered by a stand out wait team.    Brunch is a little heavy on bread (shared a few of the brunch items), but flavours were great.  Favourites were the potato hash paired with the green goddess dip and pancakes - I would never usually order by waiter Kyle insisted and was spot on.  Avocado toast and Superfood bowl were not my favourite.  To clarify, these are not the same owners at Una.  The owners worked at Una (front of the house) and Ox & Angela (kitchen) ~ so there are some familiar flavours.  I can't wait to get back."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. Service was top notch and super friendly. I really enjoyed the mushroom & kale tempura and the charred chicken. I recommend this for small intimate groups or a small intimate wedding(if they do that) it's such a great set up and vibe!"}
{"text":"Visited for dinner last night and was so impressed with the food, atmosphere, and service!    Our server was friendly and knowledgeable, and the courses came out in good timing.  3-4 dishes seems to be the perfect amount for 2 people, as it's all sharing.  We ordered Collard Greens with Chorizo sausage, Cucumber Salad with melons, Fried Rice, and Brick Chicken and were so satisfied!  We had a really hard time narrowing down our dishes from the delicious sounding menu, so we're planning to go back with more people to have a taste of more of the options!    The venue itself is just stunning.  The decor and plants are very modern and warm, and the nods to Calgary's original Ten Foot Henry are so fun!  Can't wait to see what Little Henry brings in the front area too, very exciting!  Highly recommend, already excited to go back!"}
{"text":"I keep coming back here for the tuna crudo! But I have a few other favourites like the kale salad, chicken yakitori, and mushroom omelette.   Service here is excellent and you'll leave without a food coma, I can't wait until their grab-and-go concept opens!"}
{"text":"Landed in Calgary and yelp led me to one of the best restaurants I've ever eaten at. Delicious, healthy, flavorful, modern tapas style food. Excellent service and pacing of the dishes. Reasonable prices. Hip decor and music. Open kitchen. Every course was enjoyable."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant. Menu items seem overly simple, but there is an interesting twist on everything and it's  done to perfection and SO full of flavour. Carrots and green beans have never tasted so good. Ambiance is super cool and a nice change from everything else in Calgary that seems to all follow the same trend. Service is excellent. Trust their suggestions, they really do know what they are talking about here. Don't miss out on the Butterscotch pudding. To. Die. For."}
{"text":"Whenever I have out of town visitors, I bring them here to eat.  The atmosphere is friendly, the food is always tasty and thoughtfully put together.  Hands down one of my favourite Calgary restaurants! (Hanger steak and tomatoes, dish are my fave!)"}
{"text":"The brunch here is amazing !!! The decor is beautiful and the food is great!! I recommend trying the mushroom omelette"}
{"text":"Highly recommend it!! Every dish was perfectly paired with different flavours and textures. So delicious! The service was excellent, they were around to top up waters and check in, but weren't in the way or absent.  The atmosphere was perfect too; very clean, welcoming, and well designed. It really was incredible and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"The food was quite good and the recipes were unique. I gave it four instead of five stars due to high price ($70 for lunch for two) and the volume of noise - voices and music given the environment."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere and outstanding food. It was packed when we got there and we didn't have a reservation, but the hostess was friendly and accommodating and actually was able to seat us earlier than she predicted. The rest of the staff was really friendly, too, and gave great recommendations. All of the food was amazing. We had the tomatoes and rye bread (a little tricky to eat at first but worth it), grilled cauliflower, pasta with pepper, steak, and salmon. I really liked the combination of rich, tender beef with bitter greens. We didn't have room for dessert, which was unfortunate because I'm sure it would have been excellent"}
{"text":"Underrated and one of the best new restaurants in Calgary. Food and service were terrific and the prices are very competitive. Looking forward to many more visits."}
{"text":"I went to Ten Foot Henry for a family lunch to celebrate my mom and grandmother's birthday. Everything was sooo delicious! My favourites were the tomatoes (with feta on a crostini) and the collard greens, but everything was awesome! We also had the chocolate avocado torte and coconut cake for dessert. Service was excellent, friendly and helpful but also quick. They were so sweet to pick up on the birthdays and bring cakes out with candles. Prices were very reasonable. I would love to come back!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat! The food and ambience was spectactular."}
{"text":"Went for dinner with my wife. The food blew us away. We ordered:  Fried Potatoes - they had kind of a dill jalapeño sauce on top. They were really good but not the best thing we ordered.  Carrot Dish - it's hard to explain how good these carrots were. There were three colors of carrots with radishes, grapefruit, peanuts, and an avocado kind of sauce. Sounds like a strange combo but was unbelievably good.   Peruvian Chicken - amazing. Soooo good. Weird sounding combination of food with chicken, a yummy green sauce, pepper, red onion and pickles. Yeah, pickles. Sounds kind of crazy but this was my favorite dish we got. Blew my mind and was probably the best dish I've had in a year or so. The chicken was crispy on the outside and super juicy inside. Yum yum.  Hangar Steak - very good dish, but probably my least favorite of what we ordered. The chicken was way better in my opinion.  Butterscotch Pudding - this dessert was wow so good. It was butterscotch pudding that was very thick with a layer of salted caramel and then some toffee stuff on top. If I lived in Calgary I would be all over that dessert as often as I could get it.  Negatives:  We sat at the counter which means we had to sit next to other people. That's not my style but there are a lot of other tables and some people probably like that. We made a reservation last minute and took what we could get. So worth it.  Overall, this was the best experience I've had in a while."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. We had sampling of many plates and each one was delicious, although must say that by the end we were \"sauced out\" service was excellent, and would totally recommend for a date night, or even friends."}
{"text":"Ten Foot is probably one of the best places to have opened in 2016, IMO.  The ambiance is hipstery cool - exposed wood beams, hanging plants and a minimalist feel.  I lucked out being able to go with a group of friends who share the same love for food because we pretty much got everything on the menu: - sauteed gai lan - fried potatoes - roasted beets - green beans - grilled cauliflower - kale caesar salad - spring salmon - chicken adobo - chargrilled hanger steak   And for dessert: - coconut cream pie - butterscotch pudding - cherry donut  Yeah, I was not lying when I said we got pretty much everything lol  My fave of the lot? The kale caesar salad (I think it beats my once fave at Una!) and the butterscotch pudding (that sponge toffee topping added the perfect crunch).  It's tapas/family style so sharing is highly encouraged. And really, why wouldn't you? Sharing is caring, after all."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. Definitely did not disappoint as I've heard tons about if from friends and family, really happy I checked it out!"}
{"text":"Great place to come for lunch. I love that they are vegetable-forward, and their salads are so good too!"}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've ever had and as a food blogger who travels that's saying a lot. They handle gluten free like a pro. The food is fresh and delicious. I recommend the roasted carrots with avocado purée and pistachios, green beans with citrus, walnuts and manchego. Salt roasted potatoes with jalapeños and smoked mustard aioli. The salmon and the halibut. Don't forget the chocolate avocado tart with maple syrup. Cocktails are wonderful too."}
{"text":"Definitely many options for vegans here and servers are friendly and knowledgeable for those with restrictions!   Recommend for groups who love to share dishes to get a chance to try little bits of everything.   Don't pass on the desserts! Hubby loved the donuts!"}
{"text":"Came to Ten Foot Henry with a few girlfriends for brunch - the decor is simplistic while still remaining comfortable and inviting. Good location with ample street parking in the vicinity.  This is family style dining which I personally am not a fan of, and to accommodate everyone's tastes (there were 4 of us) we ended up getting quite a few dishes, to the point where we were unable to finish all the food.   The dishes were very good, excellent pairing choices (example: flank steak served on a bed of sautéed broccolini, whipped goat cheese and roasted cherry tomatoes served with crusty bread, avocado toast topped with a lightly fried egg, pickled beets served with hummus and topped with pistachios). They also serve \"bullet coffee\" for those who are following a keto diet and many of the meat dishes are keto friendly as they come with a side of veggies.  The service was excellent; attentive and friendly while seamlessly keeping our drinks filled and dishes cleared. The only reason for the 4 stars is because the protein portions were quite small for the price of the dishes. I will be back again, while keeping in mind this is family style dining, will probably come back as a table of two to keep things simple and avoid ordering too many dishes to accommodate multiple people's preferences."}
{"text":"After reading the rave reviews, I was expecting something much better but we were disappointed, mostly by the food since the service was great and the place has cool decor and a good vibe. The food just wasn't great. The flavor was subdued or just weird (like, do they have to add goat cheese to sour cream - why? To make it more \"unique\"?). I didn't really enjoy any of the dishes we ordered (4 different things). And, by the way, it is EXPENSIVE. $57 without tax/tip for a mediocre lunch for 2 people... pretty ridiculous."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite restaurant in Calgary. Best to go with a few friends so you can try more dishes as they are served family style. Amazing vegetables."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to Ten Foot Henry on Sunday for our anniversary and the whole experience was incredible. The food was amazing! We had the beets, gai lan, salmon and the tagliatelle and everything was delicious. We had fabulous wine and our server Jill was awesome. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Good: Solid tapa selection, great service, quality food. Bad: crowded tables and overly bright lighting. YES it's worth going. #nuffsaid"}
{"text":"Ten Foot Henry offers a classy hip ambiance and is known as a place to be seen. It had received rave reviews so I decided to make reservations to have brunch/lunch with a friend who happens to be a local restauranteur.  Upon arrival, I was greeted by a snooty hostess who stated she had only high tops available despite me choosing the table option over a high top when making the reservation. I pointed to four empty tables and stated \"one of those will do just fine\". Upon being seated the waitress gave the rules of engagement (tapas style 3/4 dishes would fill 2 people) and I ordered a drink.  I found the wine selection while underpriced to be a selection of pedestrian-grade Lablow Liquor store specials. I opted for a couple micro brews instead as I'm somewhat of a wine snob. We ordered a tomato dish, hash and avacado bread with the reccomendation of the waitress. We wanted to order a fourth meat plate, but she insisted it was more than enough food and practically refused to take it down until we finished. The presentation of the dishes was beautiful however all the food was over salted, blan and very generic.   The entire experience felt rushed. The staff clearly looked down on specific types of people. My message to the greeter and waitress.... you're not at the top of the social hierarchy, you're in the service business. If you cannot figure out how to treat all paying customers you need to find a new career.  The best attribute of Ten Foot Henry besides the ambiance was the acoustics. I would only return for a lunch meeting as it was very easy to hear. Other than that, I find this to be just another attempt to create a foodieesque hangout for the overpaid Calgary Millenial crowd."}
{"text":"Found this gem through Yelp and it was just across our hotel (Hotel Arts). From the outside, the restaurant is very non-descript and simple. My friend and I walked in for an early lunch on a Tuesday. Since we didn't have any reservations, we were seated at the bar where we had a friendly server/bartender who minded us our whole stay.   Service was very warm, friendly and accommodating. We noticed that the restaurant had regulars and as it approached noon, it started filling up.     We ordered the tomato and cheese appy (i forgot the name) as recommended by our server - it was lovely! I enjoyed the combination of tomato and cheese plus the herbs. For our main, we shared their steak (medium) - it was also great but serving might be too small for sharing. Lastly, we got their salted caramel dessert -- soooo delicious! Serving is quite big but we finished it all.   Glad to try this place and next time, will definitely try their sister place - Little Henry for breakfast and coffee"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for quality food, it is pricey, but it is worth it for me. This place can get very busy quick, so I suggest a reservation. I ordered Spaghetti Pomodoro, Hanger steak, truffle mustard, & Gai choy, Yam tortilla, sumac radish, nigella sour cream. The service was great and the timing of food delivery was excellent. I also like the decors and I would go back again to try other menu items."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch. This place is very busy, be prepared to wait 15+ mins, and don't forget to make a booking. Food is good, great looks. I ordered steak. They didn't ask me how I would like my steak, but it was just right for me, medium to medium well.  Would definitely visit again to try something else."}
{"text":"Recently tried this place for the first time for lunch. The food was outstanding and the service was very good. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place....I had a beet salad with hummus and it was phenomenal. Would definitely be back at some point."}
{"text":"This is joining the ranks as one of my favorite restaurants! The dishes are creative and well thought-out. The price point is right, it has a killer ambiance and the service was good without being at all pretentious. The menu is comprised of \"smaller\" plates for sharing. 5 dishes for 2 people was plenty (with some leftovers). There are a lot of veggie dishes, which makes this place great for vegetarians and meat-eaters alike. We got the roasted carrots, grilled asparagus, pickled melon, hanger steak, and bucatini. Everything was delicious, but the carrots were a standout because of their uniqueness! The only complaint was wanting a little more meat on the steak dish. We got the coconut cake for dessert, which was good but I wouldn't get again (a little too thick on the cake portion). If I'm ever in Calgary again, I don't think I'd even look another place up -- I'd come straight here!"}
{"text":"Really this is more of 3.5 star rating. So I've heard a lot about this place and most people speak super highly of it!! We were really lucky to walk in on a Saturday night at 7 and got seated for two right away at the bar.  The good: omg the Tomato and sourdough bread dish was amazing!! I could eat that forever. We also got the roasted cauliflower that was yummy as well but a little bit salty. I got the house Malbec wine which was surprisingly great. Our server was very attentive and my water glass was never empty!  The disappointing: we got the steak and it was very underwhelming. For a $25 dish that contained four slivers of meat it was completely not worth the price. It was way, way, waaaay too salty and the meat wasn't as soft as I'd expect it to be. I think next time I'm just going to stick to the veggie dishes.  Would be willing to try it again since 2/3 dishes were great, but it's a little more expensive than I felt it deserved (especially the meat dishes)."}
{"text":"Fantastic dining experience.  I was lucky enough to get a last minute reservation on a Friday night.  The roasted beets and green beans were outstanding! We also had the seared pickerel which was great.  I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Go get dressed up and enjoy a delicious meal at Ten Foot Henry! You won't regret it. The food here is pretty expensive but it's definitely worth it. Love that they offer tons of veggie options, and the presentation is always on point.   I'm also a huge fan of their fresh modern lay out and all the plants - makes for a lively but relaxing atmosphere. Staff was professional and pleasant. The epitome of a nice place to go eat."}
{"text":"What a disappointment this experience was. I heard and read such great reviews that I NEEDED to try this place out. I was wrong, they were wrong... WHY ME!   The evening started out ok, we showed up on time for our reso but the table wasn't ready yet so we waited maybe about 8-10 mins in the tiny little hallway area. (Side note, the space is really cute and they have some nice plants and pretty fixtures)  Once seated we were greeted by our server that was overly hipster and loud... he didn't have any real grace about him and was not attentive, but whatever.   We order some drinks and browse the menu... I LOVE sharable plates, it's my absolute favorite way to eat so naturally, I'm excited.   We went with the asparagus, yakitori chicken, spaghetti cacao e pepe and hanger steak. Let's start off with the asparagus... wasn't a fan of what seemed to be scrambled eggs on top... it set off the flavour and was just bleh. I did like the crispy potato chips though. The chicken was tasty and we did enjoy those however the hanger steak seemed to lack flavour and was super chewy/rubbery...not worth it.  Now for the spaghetti, I must say this is by far the worst pasta I ever had... EVER. It was super dry and tasted like they put dry white cheddar kraft dinner cheese on top with melted butter and didn't mix it thoroughly. Seriously!! I have no idea why so many people were raving about this dish. If I was blind folded and had a bite of each, I would assume theirs was KD that you just didn't add milk to because you ran out. AWFUL.  Atmosphere sometimes saves experiences, but this one did not. It was super loud and we just wanted to leave.   Save your money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Unbelievable. LOVED every minute of it. Just moved to Calgary a month ago and have made a point of trying pretty much every restaurant referred to me or highly rated on yelp and this was tied with my favourite (I adore the mexican place called Native Tongues as well.) My only reservation is everyone reviewing the Coconut cake said amazing things, best cake I ever ate etc.... maybe a new dessert chef that day or something it was really nothign special in fact very dry. Dont get it. But the Butterscotch Pudding covered with sponge toffee more than made up for it - Im still tasting it in my dreams. Oh also not crazy about the size of some of the plates, we ordered (for just the two of us- we totally pigged out that day) about 3 appetizers and 2 entrees and the very expensive Tuna Crudo was TINY. Ill see if I took a photo, I hope I added a quarter in there to show the scale."}
{"text":"1.Service-Great 2.Food-High quality fresh and pure unadulterated flavor 3.What are you waiting for?"}
{"text":"The food here is excellent... specifically their whipped feta and bread. Their service can be extremely slow and they are kind of weird about seating. I've been there a couple of times and the last time I was there, we didn't make a reservation. It was 5:45 on a weekday so we figured it wouldn't be an issue. They made a big deal out of it and asked us to sit at the bar. We agreed and we were packed quite tightly in with a bunch of other people. The bar was packed... but the rest of the restaurant was empty. The entire time we were there. The bar wasn't very comfortable to sit in and it got annoying when you're bumping elbows with some random sitting beside you but there are clearly empty seats at tables everywhere.  I still give it a good rating because the food is very delicious.  My husband ordered the peruvian chicken and he said it was really good and juicy.  We also shared a grilled asparagus and it was also quite good.  I'll still come here again... but I will definitely make a reservation as sitting at the bar was very uncomfortable and I wouldn't recommend that.  But the food is good and I like the decor of the place so I'm sure we'll be back."}
{"text":"Visited on opening weekend and couldn't be more impressed! But I wouldn't expect any less from the crew that brought us Una Pizza and Ox & Angela. The space is beautifully designed and very inviting. They offer a family style experience where sharing dishes is recommended, our server suggesting we order 2-3 dishes per two people. There was lots to choose from on their menu and was sectioned off into Vegetables, Meat & Fish and Sides. Our group of four decided to order two dishes from each section, and the food was delivered to our table as it was ready from the kitchen. Highlights from our meal included the Mash (fried egg on top!), Brick Chicken (the sauce, what's in that sauce?!), and the Spaghetti cacio e pepe (I might dream about this pasta until I can have it again). We also indulged in their Coconut cake for dessert, which was easily sharable between the four of us. Overall our group was very pleased with the whole experience as the service was great and everything ran so smoothly that you would have never guessed they had just opened. As well, the cost per person at the end of the night was about $40, which included a $12 cocktail! So the value for the quality of the food you get is incredible.  What a great addition to the Beltline/Victoria Park area! Can't wait to go back and try more items on their menu."}
{"text":"Affordable for a high end experience!  Wine on tap too!"}
{"text":"This place was good but didn't live up to the hype for me. It is accommodating of vegan diets which can be hard to find in Calgary. Overall I appreciated the effort that they put into the food, everything is made from scratch. Taste wise it wasn't there for me."}
{"text":"My wife and I were traveling back from Alaska and spent a night in Calgary.  We looked for an interesting restaurant that wouldn\"t over stuff us with food.  This was essentially a small plates restaurant where we ordered 3 dishes for the 2 of us and it was plenty.  We showed up with no reservation and after a short wait were seated at the bar.  Most of us at the bar were dining rather than drinking.  The service was extraordinary, including the bartender explaining the dishes.  Most extraordinary was our first course of a dish with feta cheese, herbs and tomatoes.  It was somehow whipped into creaminess and had an amxing flavor.  All the dishes were carefully prepared and served and I would go out of my way to go there again."}
{"text":"Love love love. Soothing ambiance. Top notch. Coconut cake is bomb dot com. Also, do not go with a crappy person who doesn't put their phone away ( yes, you- Mariam)  and enjoys the vibe with you because then if you aren't very aware of human psyche- you may associate that feeling of being neglected with the restaurant but I am here to tell you that this place is lit. #top10inyyc"}
{"text":"Went with some friends tonite and was blown away.  Everything was delicious and different.  Our favs were the Gai lan, bucatini, green beans, and beets.  Service was delightful.  Hip atmosphere but a bit noisy.  Loved it and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Our friends were raving about this restuarant and we finally had a chance to try it. It was beyond what we'd hoped for.  We had the tomatoes, beets, steak and tagliatelle.  Everything tasted amazing- the vegetables were like art.  I have been craving this place since we've been- service was great too."}
{"text":"What a gem! Food was stellar, service (Roland) was impeccable and atmosphere was perfect. I will definitely be back to try the rest of the unique menu."}
{"text":"It is a must go to place while visiting Calgary. Great food, great atmosphere and excellent service... our server, Kyle, provided outstanding service and great recommendations. A total positive dining experience with great memories!"}
{"text":"This is still my favourite restaurant in Calgary. I LOVE the tomatoes, the potatoes, the gai lan and the tortilla. It's one of those places where everything is a sure bet and you always have a great time."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly service. A little pricey for what was delivered. Worth a try"}
{"text":"Nice decor and friendly staff.  This restaurant concept is family style sharing plates where you get a bunch of food and share, but the problem is you have to order couple of the same dish is you have a big group of people as the portions are rather small and a bit pricey.  The only thing i can rave about is their coconut cake which is super moist, flavourful and to die for!"}
{"text":"I'm getting a bit tired of the \"sharing\" concept. It gets a bit awkward when you have to split the bill with others and, you feel you are paying a lot for less than a full meal.   The menu is rather scarce but the food is good. P.S. most items are on the spicy side."}
{"text":"I love this place! I went for my birthday dinner with a bunch of friends and was so happy I did.  The food was amazing, the only downfall was the sitting setup for a large group.  I'd definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Loved the food, atmosphere & staff. I hope to come back again soon."}
{"text":"Had an excellent family style meal with 8 of my colleagues. Absolutely delicious food... the potatoes are unreal. I highly recommend letting your server order for you. If you order for yourselves you really can't go wrong though. Surprisingly loved the Malbec on tap!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here on a Sunday in November and were pleasantly surprised at the variety of vegetarian options, great service, and friendly bar server that we chatted with while seated at the bar. Food was exceptional. Cool decor and friendly vibe."}
{"text":"Amazing - start to finish. We had dinner here and tried a lot of items. My faves - Beets, Green Beans, Tomatoes & Feta. The Salmon and all of the pastas are amazing too.  We were in a rush the night we dined - headed to a hockey game. So we did not have time for dessert.  I called a few days later to see if they had the Butterscotch Pudding - and if they would hold me one for a late res. The man who answered the phone remembered us from the night we had dinner and was super nice. He put a pudding back for me.  We went in for a late dinner that night and had the pudding. OMG. Amazing - one of the best desserts I have ever had - and that is saying a lot. I am from Houston and we have AMAZING restaurants. We travel and dine all over the world - and I can honestly say this was one of my favorite meals. Both times. Ten Foot Henry can compete with Houston - any day. Simply amazing. Fresh ingredients, menu is full of healthy items. I loved it !! The staff was fantastic. Our waitress, Jill was so sweet. I highly recommend having a meal here.  We will be back !"}
{"text":"We decided to try this restaurant in Calgary after a few days of hiking in Canmore, especially since my friend was looking for a more vegetable-based option.  It was also great for a late lunch as this is an all-day restaurant.  Atmosphere: 4.5/5 I love the decor here - especially all the hanging terrariums and the quiet relaxed atmosphere with an open kitchen.  The chairs definitely remind me of school haha!   Since we arrived at 3pm after a walk along 17ave, it was not very busy, so we were able to enjoy our dining experience here.   Apparently it can become quite busy and reservations are usually needed.  Food: 4/5  There were definitely some interesting options on the menu.  Most of the dishes are meant for sharing.  We ended up choosing the roasted cauliflower, egg bagna cauda, garlic bread crumb; green beans, walnut caper, ricotta salata, and scallops with smoked proscuitto, olive tomatos and herbs.  The scallops were probably my favorite and went well with the tomato / herbs, although portion sizes are on the smaller side.  With the cauliflower, we were not sure how to eat it as we didn't discover the egg or bread crumbs until digging into the dish a little more.  The beans were ok - I liked the touch of caper.  Overall interesting combination of ingredients which worked well, although I did expect the portions to be larger.  We finished off with the coconut cake, which was large and delicious!  Service: 4/5  Very attentive and friendly  Price: 3/5  High for portion sizes  Overall: 3.5/5  Overall, I enjoyed our dining experience at Ten Foot Henry.  Very nice, unique, and relaxed decor especially the plants, however I did expect the portion sizes to be larger for the price."}
{"text":"Very good food. The food is made of simple ingredients, but to perfection. The service was great as well. The drinks however are so so-don't recommend the cocktails."}
{"text":"What a cute place! All the staff members were very attentive and friendly. The food was very good, in particular the Peruvian Chicken and the butterscotch dessert was to die for! Wasn't big on the gai lan and the hanger steak was a bit salty but everything else was spot on!"}
{"text":"A friend and I dined here yesterday for the first time-Excellent! We were seated at the Chef's Counter. The service was attentive but not obnoxious. The food, along with being able to watch the chefs in action, made for a great experience. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great simple food done very well. super friendly staff. Quite enjoyed the potatoes tomatoes and the pastas will come back."}
{"text":"Decent environment, their tomatoes, herbs and whipped feta with bread is a good appetizer. The scallop is tasty, but the size of dishes are small. And the price is a little bit expensive for the size of the dish."}
{"text":"I have been three times in the past year and service has always been incredible. Staff are so attentive and really know the food. The first two times I went the food was 10/10, the third it was more like a 7 or 8 but I'm not complaining! Atmosphere is cool and laid back, noise level a little loud sometimes making it difficult to have a conversation across the table which is probably one of my only reasons for the 4 as this kind of kills the vibe when you have to yell to be heard. Overall amazing place!"}
{"text":"Super delicious food. Great wine and great service. We ate our fill! Too expensive to be a regular stop but would recommend for date night or a special occasion."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. I would definitely recommend this and will be returning in the future.  The beets were so good. Also would recommend the pasta"}
{"text":"First time in Calgary , saw that this was a top 10 restaurant pick by Avenue Calgary. Busy spot in downtown . Reservations can prevent long waits for any parties 3 or more. We sat at the bar . Pretty tight spot but still enjoyable. Great atmosphere and smells. Staff were very experienced and professional. Everything is served to share so they recommend at least 2 dishes each. Had the roasted carrots and tomatoes for vegetables , then the bucatini pasta . We weren't too hungry so skipped the protein . The scallops near by smelled deeelish though. Yelp recommended the coconut cake which was fantastic! Our waiter recommended a liquor to go with it , forget the name but tasty as heck!"}
{"text":"Probably my favorite atmosphere that we went to in Calgary. Super fun space. cacio e pepe was amazing. A bit pricey for the portion but a great date spot."}
{"text":"What a great place. The usual funky industrial building. But the food is very inventive. A dish like \"carrots\" makes use of 3 different heritage varieties, is partnered with a cheese, nuts, and avocado and elevates the dish to something really special. The food is healthy AND tasty. Well done!"}
{"text":"Great dishes for sharing, great flavours and not so sweet to incredibly sweet dessert.  Been there 3 times and will go again."}
{"text":"Visiting from Houston. Best meal in Calgary all week, and probably all year. Great staff, great atmosphere."}
{"text":"It was ok. The food was not bad but it wasn't super good. Very bland tastes, small portions, and way too expensive. The service really threw me off... our server barley said more than 2 words to us and just seemed very quiet and unhappy. When your bill is more than a hundred dollars for 2 people sitting for approx 40 mins in total and you barley said anything to us barley did anything and then we tip you well and you walk away leaving the paper roll to just print out... is so rude. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Very good food & great atmosphere! I was visiting from California and decided to explore downtown Calgary on a Sunday, by myself because my family was on an earlier flight than me and had already left.  I had no idea that Calgary is pretty much closed on Sunday's. Thank goodness this place was open! It was the lunch I was hoping to have when I planned on going downtown. The Caesar salad and tomato dish were both SO good!! As was their pudding. This dishes tasted healthy but flavorful. If I ever visit again the area again I'll definitely be stopping by!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Small/shared plate concept. Strong vegetable dishes, interesting bar menu, friendly staff."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere and service. The red wine in tap was a Malbec and quite nice. They accommodated my vegan diet seamlessly. My date thought the food was just mediocre but my veggie dishes were very good."}
{"text":"Carefully made food with even better service.  Me and my girlfriend came here because there were so many vegetable options. Sat right at the chefs bar tables.   If there was anything I didn't like is that the beet borscht was too salty and we couldn't finish it. Good thing we ordered like fatties and had enough food lol."}
{"text":"I've been here about 4 times.  It has everything going for it. From the moment you drive up to it ... luck always has it that parking is easy to fine. (... okay ... I'm sure I just been lucky.) . Entering you kind of walk down a corridor in anticipation of what you will see.   I've entered to an empty restaurant a very full seating. The food has always been delicious, served by friendly professional staff.   Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch and it was so yummy   Been dying to try this place so when a friend came to Calgary and wanted to find a healthy place to try I knew to try this place...   We made a reservation which I think is the way to go since the place is quite busy   I had their ice tea ( sweetened) and my friend had hot tea and it was great   Their menu is family style so we tried  - tomato and cheese salad  - mushroom omelette  - fried potatoes  - French toast  - coconut cake   The food was wonderful so yummy  The French toast was best I ever had   The only thing was that the French toast came out really late after the other dishes ( so much so we thought that we thought they forgot)  Our server didn't comes ask us how food was or how we were doing after we put our order through   I would definitely come here again"}
{"text":"I enjoy the share concept of the dishes and especially appreciate being introduced to different ways of preparing dishes (grilling mustard greens) or even new ingredients (sauce gribiche).  Everything I've tried so far (my favorites are the baked yam, grilled hanger steak and spaghetti cacio e pepe) has been delicious and leaves me wanting to come back for more.  One thing to note is while portions may look small to some, it is more hearty and filling than it looks and four dishes is plenty to share between two people.  Leave room for their dessert - the coconut cake is a really nice, light treat!"}
{"text":"I love the chill atmosphere and the coffee shop front restaurant back. Fresh wine to go with fresh flavours, bring a friend and share everything! The awards stand true for this restaurant and I can't wait to try it again."}
{"text":"Lovely location and ambience. Nice to see a bustling crowd and love seeing my fav una staff too.  Good was fresh and well presented.  More bounce in the flavour and memorable but solid delish menu."}
{"text":"Awesome food and really great service! Their portions are large so three to four dishes is more than enough to share for two. We got the tomatoes with whipped feta which was amazing! Definitely our favorite dish of the meal! The fried potatoes were also excellent. The bucatini was solid and the chicken was crispy and flavorful. Highly recommended and prices were very reasonable."}
{"text":"Had a great meal here with great service. I'm not a fan of the current restaurant design trend that packs as many uncomfortable seats into as little room as possible - but I understand the economics behind it and it's the same at almost every new \"trendy\" space in town. We enjoyed  Ten Foot Henry's and recommend it"}
{"text":"The food here is seriously good. My date and I went here for the first time last night. I knew ahead of time the entrees are meant to be family style so we ordered accordingly. I think the menu is well priced considering the portions in comparison to some other restaurants I have been too with similar concepts. The service was professional and polite, the drink menu isn't anything amazing but it'll do because the food is the real star. We shared 3 entrees and had 2 beers each. Our bill was around  $90 including tax which I felt was reasonable, also considering we left very full and satisfied. I would recommend trying the Jerk spice cauliflower with root chips and pineapple mayo. Stellar. I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Though somewhat esoteric I really enjoyed the adventure and mystery. Staff were incredibly gracious and prompt. It is a beautiful space and was a wonderful date night choice."}
{"text":"Awesome food and great cocktails Been there a couple times, both times great experiences."}
{"text":"I went to 10 Foot Henry during a quick one night get away with a couple of girlfriends.  Its menu looked great, the reviews are strong and the location couldn't be beat; it's fair to say that my expectations were pretty high.  And for good reason, this is a fantastic spot for sharing a few plates before a night out on the town.  The decor itself is all nuveau hipster.  Small, bright, with vintage church chairs and wooden tables.  Great view of both the bar and kitchen from most tables.  It was quite packed.  We were seated at a wooden picnic table near the kitchen, and the bench I was sitting on could only have enough space for me to squeeze in, with the other half still under the table, to allow servers to run food.  We started with the tomatoes.  Wow.  They were just soft enough to mix well with the whipped feta, and the fresh herbs and dill provided the perfect complement.  I'm actually not a huge dill fan, but this is how it should taste.  This was served along with the yellow-fin crudo, which was my personal favourite dish of the night.  The chimichurri and sesame oil were bright and lively, and the roasted capers finished it all off with the right amount of crunch with no aftertaste.  Next up was fried potatoes and roasted cauliflower.  The potatoes were crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and the jalapeno in the cream sauce kept it interesting.  There was dill in this too, which was fine but not my favourite.  The cauliflower was excellent.  Great crunch, both in the florets themselves and from the panko breadcrumbs that topped the head.  The olive tapenade-ish layer on top was not amazing, but I think that's my personal issue with olives.  The bucatini was not a complex serving, but that didn't stop it from hitting the spot.  Light butter, a hint of cream and the right amount of black pepper.  And the noodles themselves were wonderful, airy due to being hollow and prepared perfectly al dente.  We finished with the scallops, which we were the most excited for.  We even grabbed a glass of the sparkling pinot noir to pair with them.  Unfortunately, we were a bit disappointed.  The prosciutto is only mildly in the ragu that is served with them, so no crisp and not enough salt.  The scallops themselves had a nice sear and were perfectly medium rare, but for $29 and our final plate, I was a bit disappointed.  We paired our meal with a grassy ______ from Austria.  Never heard of the varietal before and it really complemented the diversity of flavours.  Great cocktails as well.  I had a French 75, and my friends had a Negroni and a Hemingway.  I tried them all and would vouch for any or all.  All in all, I think this is a perfect spot for a small group dinner.  Not intimate enough for a special date night and too small for large groups."}
{"text":"The food here is off the chain! Mains, veggies, and amazing desserts. Staff is nice and I loved the hanging plants!"}
{"text":"Outstanding dishes, sides and service. Very interesting ingredients and combinations result in an excellent tasting and healthy meals! Location is very convenient to downtown. The price is very reasonable for the quality and quantity of food you will get. The inside is a very pleasant atmosphere and there is a full bar. If you're in a rush they have a small 'to-go' shop next door called Little Henry."}
{"text":"I went with some friends that I haven't seen in years so we were there to enjoy each other's company, take our time, and share lots of items. It was busy, but didn't feel like a busy place. The ambiance is wonderful; the servers were calm and didn't rush us, the restaurant is bright and welcoming.   We asked our server to pick out everything for us and he brought us excellent selections that accommodated our dietary restrictions. Vegan items (me), gluten and dairy free (one friend), and meat for the carnivorous one in our group. Not an easy task! My favourite vegan items were the beets and the carrots.   For the dessert our server again made solid choices for us. I had the chocolate avocado torte paired with an espresso. The torte was not too sweet and not too rich, just delicious creamy flavour!  We were able to relax and catch up while our server subtly stepped in at the right moments to refresh drinks and bring more food. I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Favorite breakfast place in Calgary! We always make sure to go when we are in town. The food is always good and well prepared. They have the best pancakes I've ever had. They are infused with a delicious maple syrup flavour and are the perfect density.  Hoping to try it for lunch or dinner soon!"}
{"text":"This is now our new favorite place in Calgary! Wow... Every single dish starting w yellow fin crudo was ABSOLUTLEY mouth watering. Tomatoes and whipped feta w toasted sour dough was a song on your taste buds! Jalapeño fried potatoes - best ever / hands down! Spaghetti pomedoro was amazing and I wish I had the recipe! Think this sums it up!!! Will be back  Again And  Again!"}
{"text":"Great night, flavors were great. Friend ordered a juice drink which was squeezed right in front of us.   The spaghetti was perfect, the rainbow chard dish was excellent"}
{"text":"Vegetables are your main dish here, with some excellent choices for meat , fish and pasta. The service is friendly. The decor is clean , light and inviting. I will definitely have to go back to try more items on the menu."}
{"text":"Vegetables alone have never made me fuller. Ten Foot Henry is a real gem, with a very healthy menu to boot. Service is always very welcoming and efficient, with dishes come out in a staggered fashion. This is a wonderful restaurant to visit with a group because the plates are meant to be shared, and the place is decorated in a casual, light, modern fashion. All dishes are presented beautifully, and they're simple enough to let the flavours stand out without compromising innovation. I highly recommend the yam tortilla and butterscotch pudding. Prices are reasonable for Calgary. Will be back, and you need to bring vegans/vegetarians/dieters to a restaurant, this is a very good option, with a good selection of both vegetable-based dishes and meat-based dishes.  Note, I'm pretty sure that during winter this restaurant has more Canada Goose jackets in one room than the Holt Renfrew coat department."}
{"text":"I have tried this place a handful of times, and I am really glad that I did, as if I were to base my review on just my initial visit, I would have given the place a three.   There is street parking around the restaurant, and after 6pm on weekday and Saturday it is free, as well as free street parking all day on Sundays. The restaurant itself is well decorated, with Little Henry (the cafe part of the restaurant) on the left side door and the restaurant on the right side door. I found the place a little louder than I usually like for an intimate dinner, but it is an awesome atmosphere if you want to grab dinner with friends and have a few drinks.    My first visit was for a dinner out on my birthday with my significant other, and we had made reservations but they didn't even have our table ready. They made us stand around for fifteen minutes before they sat us, and that had already put us in an off mood before we even ordered. I found the service at this time ok, but not amazing, and the prices of the dishes seemed expensive.  Fast forward to now. Although I was off put by the first visit, I gave Ten Foot Henry a couple more tries - and am I ever glad that I did! Every consecutive visits I have made since, have been amazing, and they just get better and better. The service has been great, with the servers being very knowledgeable about the items on the menu, and always happy to give recommendations. The dishes are always vegetarian friendly, interesting, and definitely not stuff I could come up with or cook at home!   Another thing I was extremely impressed with was that I e-mailed the restaurant with questions about the menu as I have some dietary restrictions at the moment. The response I received was amazing, and I more than appreciated the time they took to explain to me which item included gluten, dairy, or soy. They even let me know which dishes would be best with what substitutions, and I can't imagine how long it would have actually taken them to write up this e-mail but for ANYONE with dietary restrictions, you can understand and appreciate that they took the time to do this as some other places, would easily show annoyance when you ask about ingredients in their menu items.  Overall, I would definitely recommend Ten Foot Henry to anyone, with the creative, changing dishes they have. I haven't had a single dish I tried here that I did not like, but my personal favourites are the beets, the cauliflower (I don't even really like cauliflower but it's SO GOOD!) and the pickerel. If you are looking for a new place to check out, please do yourself a favour and eat at Ten Foot Henry :)"}
{"text":"Great little shareable plates and nice cozy atmosphere. It gets really loud when it's busy but definitely worth it. I really like the fried potatoes and the pastas. Meat dishes have been hit and miss but still pretty good."}
{"text":"This restaurant left me an unforgettable experience of their Canadian dishes. Everything was so good,  there were 3 of us but we had 4 main courses and 2 deserts. In addition, we finished them all!"}
{"text":"Family style dining shared among 4 mom friends - everything on the menu sounded tasty, so with positive feedback from our host about our choices, we shared 7 dishes.  Each dish was super delicious- full of interesting and rich flavours, and nicely cooked.  In order from \"fav\" to \"yummy but more interesting dishes there\": 1 tomatoes, 2 collard greens, 3 steak, 4 beets, 5 cauliflower, 6 chicken, then 7 dumplings.  Sparkling water is a nice and welcome option during our lunch.  For dessert, we shared the coconut cake (light flavours, really enjoyed this), chocolate avocado (omg, this was rich but not sweet at all) and the butterscotch pudding (an amazingly delicious dessert, it should almost have a better name to reflect how it is so not just a boring pudding) - very large serving sizes and would recommend all of these options.  I have had the cherry donut in the past from Little Henry and already know this option to be crazy yummy.  Decaf Americanos were quite good as well- rich coffee with a satisfying mouthfeel.   Thoroughly enjoyable place for lunch, our host was very supportive of our questions and offered really great feedback about menu options.  Staff were on the ball refilling our waters, just only a smidge , but apologetic, slow with our coffees with dessert.  Overall, I would absolutely return!!"}
{"text":"It was my first time in town. We were starving, so we checked on yelp where to eat on the neighbourhood...bam, first place 124 reviews, 4.5 stars: the Canadian cuisine Ten Foot Henry. Yelp reviewers never disappoint. It was amazing!!! We tried roasted cauliflower, very good. I tried the arrabiata pasta, I loved the sauce, not too spicy for me, nice bread crumbs on top too.  My favourite was the Mushroom pasta, it was so simple but yet it had so much flavour!! I would go back for another dish of that. Very friendly staff, the hostess was really really friendly!!  I didn't have reservations and for a Friday night, table for 4 was tricky. We had to wait around 40min, but I may say it was totally worth it! I would recommend doing a reservation before though, just so you don't wait too long.  Ahh must try: coconut cake, with toasted coconut and coconut milk frosting. Perfect end, for a perfect dinner :)"}
{"text":"There was an extremely unassuming entrance to this warm interior, I never would have found it or even thought to look inside had I not yelped beforehand!  The food here was really good, the gai lan was crunchy and savory, the chicken juicy and well spiced, the chargrilled hanger steak yummy and smoky.  Many more dishes went around and my friends seemed to like them all.  They were very flexible with our ever-changing amount of people we wanted on the reservation, thanks for that.  They were also really good with suggesting dishes, how many, what we should order so things were balanced and plentiful enough to share.  At the end the waitress even circled and starred the 18% gratuity that was already included in the bill to make sure we didn't double tip.  Thanks, Canada.  I have an allergy to sesame, and they were great about separating out sesame-containing dishes (of which there were a few) and telling me what I could eat and what I couldn't.  The only thing that would keep me from returning was that the music was a bit loud and intrusive, pulsing-bass electronic dance music kind of stuff that seemed incongruous with this classy and elegant menu.  Nice and geeky wine list (Rotgipfler, hello?  Sparkling wine from the Jura??) and local beers.  I will definitely come back here my next time in Calgary, but I'll consider wearing earplugs."}
{"text":"We loved this place for lunch. It has such a good vibe - cool decor, friendly and helpful staff, and just enough action. Add to that some fabulous food like the tomatoes and the bucatini, and a great glass (or two) of wine, and what more could we have asked for?! My vegetarian self had many options, too, although there's plenty for you carnivores. We couldn't resist the ridiculous butterscotch pudding - nobody needs to eat this, but man is it good!"}
{"text":"We dined on a Monday night and it was very busy, which is always a good sign. We got seated promptly and service was great. We had the Salmon and Chargrilled Chicken which were wonderful. My favorite would have had to be the Salmon. It was tender, cooked slightly rare with a wonderful avocado mousse and Chorizo buttons. The Ceasar salad was great, made of Kale and topped with a fried egg which is pretty neat.   The noise level is loud (as others have mentioned). I'm guessing the acoustics in there must have something to do with it, but we found it easy to still enjoy our meal and conversation. Parking is a bit of a hassle though as they are right in front of a bus stop, so get there early if you can."}
{"text":"Yum. Very fun inside space, cool tasting menu concept and great menu. I had the halibut -delish. My collegue had the salmon. Also yum and one of the girls had the soup as she was a little under the weather. It was also amazing. Great service, we ended us having the truffles and an americano to end. hit the spot.  We walk from downtown which wad a lovely 10min walk if that. So totally doable if you are looking for a dt restaurant to hit. My only negative was all the hard surfaces, it was a little hard to hear each other as its quite loud over lunch time. Great spot overall.    This is my update. I went there again and since there again. and since then again. I think the ordering the first time needed some assistance to be the amazing experience it is now. Best dishes: perhaps best in Calgary -the tomatoes. I dont what they are actually called but if you just ask for the crazy good tomatoes. They will know. They are roasted but full and juicy and come with fresh herbs and warm cheese. You mix it up and spread it on their fresh daily bread and I am serious. It is crazy crazy crack. Then you order the green beans which are with walnuts oranges and manchego cheese. Again. so good. The tomato pasta is way more delisions than you would expect. And please please. Save room for the choclate avocado torte. Its so good I google a reciped to try and recreate it for my foodie friend on the weekend. Ten Foot is reallly great and has become quickly my go to spot. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is one of my new favourite restaurants in Calgary right now! I love the family style sharing dishes. Favourites include the tomatoes, the carrots, butternut squash tortilla and the hangar steak.  Everything I've tried here is amazing!!"}
{"text":"Do you like small portioned meals advertised as family sized? Do you like unseasoned bland overpriced food? YOU'LL LOVE THIS PLACE!!   On that note, the server was super sweet and made the experience semi tolerable"}
{"text":"Honestly, this place is amazing!! We are vegan and this place is the best place in Calgary for a fancy dinner out..vegan-style. They do have some meat/fish options and the pasta has egg but the veggie options are spectacular. The Henry salad is beyond words...I could have one all to myself (even though it's served family style). The beets, carrots, jalapeño potatoes, asparagus. And even the two vegan desserts are absolutely amazing. Can't say enough good things. Just GO!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times and it's always consistently good.  The food is tapas style and intended to be shared.  The roasted cauliflower is one of my favourite items on the minute.  It's so tasty and creamy with the chopped egg and bagna cauda.  The bucatini is also one of my favourites - so simple and seemingly easy to make but it is so much better than I would make at home.    The only thing I'm not a fan of is its location - although if it were located downtown, I would probably be there too often for lunch - so it's location good for my waistline."}
{"text":"A contemporary, modern cuisine - appropriate for a nice night out and willing to accommodate kids. We went as a double date. Some of the dishes were fantastic and others just ok. We ordered a total of six dishes. I'd strongly recommend the tomatoes (with feta, herbs and toasted sourdough - you mash up the tomatoes, feta and herbs and then scoop it on toast - like a creamy bruschetta of sorts) and the bucatini pasta (so good!). The Peruvian Chicken was also nice - crispy and full of savory spices without a deep fried feel - and our veggie lovers enjoyed the marinated beets.  The gailan dish was not a favourite at our table (Gail Ian simply made with peanut sauce and fried mushrooms, nothing spectacular) and the scallops were candidly quite disappointing in quality and quantity especially given the price. We went for a birthday and they didn't do anything special (not even a candle in the two desserts we ordered). Coconut Cake was really good as judged by my table mates, I personally loved Butterscotch pudding for that hit of sweet and salty. Service was good, staff was friendly, I liked the decor as well. Would have been five stars if the weaker dishes would have lived up to the better dishes, or the staff was on an elite level."}
{"text":"One of the best place I have been . Food is very healthy and delicious! Service is good. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"\"Look, it's Henry and that too a large one\". Yeah, if you have loved the character in your childhood (or adulthood), it's always nice to visit this restaurant. A relatively small restaurant (I think the capacity is 78), it's gets quite crowded and is not to be visited without a reservation. The staff is very friendly and the food choices (tapas style to share) are great. If you are a vegetarian, you will be quite happy as there are many choices out there. Some of the ones I loved included Henry Salad, Peruvian Chicken. We were three of us and liked every order that we made. The quantity is also quite good. Finally, we ordered the Avocado Chocolate desert which was yummy yet healthy. ;) There is a unique energy and buzz in the restaurant there. It's a great place and I loved the final touch where they give you a nice Henry postcard with your  check / receipt. I will keep that with me to remember the great time I had!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious! Service was friendly but a little odd that multiple servers helped us, not just the gentleman who I thought was our waiter. We didn't have a reservation so we sat in the back at the chef's counter. It was cool seeing the food being prepared but it was really hot back there (a water refill would've been helpful). So hot that I didn't enjoy my meal as much as I would have otherwise. Our fault for not having reservations but just a word of caution."}
{"text":"Can't wait to come back.  Loved the family style sharing menu, especially the variety of vegetable dishes.  The steak was maybe one of the best things I have eaten. D"}
{"text":"It's been a while since I fell in love, and I totally fell in love with Ten Foot Henry. Right from the Service to one of the Finest Menus I have seen in Calgary. The hardest part was what to order, next time I will go with a few people so I can try everything. We sat by the kitchen bar, and enjoyed the experience of watching how their team executes all the great dishes, it was amazing. I see I'm not the only one that feels this way, their reviews are terrific, I usually talk about the dishes I had, but this time I won't, as I have to go back and try it all before I talk about my favourites. Do try Ten Foot Henry if you haven't done so, but book in advance as it always busy. One thing I will say is i had tried Little Henry next door a few times for desert and coffee on the go, and the coconut cake is fabulous. Enjoy it!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite new(er) restaurants in Calgary. Although I don't know much about the history of the sign and wasn't in Calgary when it was up I think it's still a cute story. The decor is very trendy, lots of greenery and nice touches. When I first visited it was BUSY, we didn't have a reservation so ended up sitting at the bar at the back which was fine. It's family style dining and a vegetable-focused menu - perfect for sharing! We ordered four different items, the Caesar salad, a pasta dish, the tuna and the last one is escaping my memory. However, they were all so good! Very flavourful and filling, we really liked each of them individually and it was nice to have someone to share with so we could order more options. We had also asked our server for some suggestions and she did a good job making recommendations for us. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"one of my favorite spots in the city, which is on fire lately.  tried to go there for lunch without a reservation on a weekday and almost didn't get a table.  They are worth many visits due to:  1. creative, healthy options 2. amazing cocktails (ask nicely, and they may make you a custom one) 3. sleek space 4. lots of great sharing options 5. veggie-forward, because we're all not eating enough greens"}
{"text":"What kind of dining experience do you get at TFH? Fresh, fresh, fresh!!! We enjoyed some really great dishes -- modern Calgary-style, bursting with fresh ingredients that seem to be sourced from top notch places...... Done in the tapas style -- small plates -- we stuck to a predominantly vegetarian spread (although there were meat options to choose from). We weren't fans of the spaghetti (it was a bit too plain), but the baked carrots, fresh garden salad (with many fresh herbs), tomato and cheese on toast, and the pumpkin ravioli were all really great.  Think clean, modern, fresh...and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, service and space. Everything we tried was perfectly flavoured. Highlights: Yellowfin tuna, dumplings, caesar salad, spaghetti, and collard greens. Can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu. Don't forget to save room for dessert :) A great addition to the Beltline!"}
{"text":"Wow- great sharing menu, atmosphere and decor really welcoming ,big open space, yet not cold or noisy. The flavours are superb and and service impeccable. Great addition to our city!"}
{"text":"Loved this restaurant! Everything from its gorgeous decor to the friendly servers and delicious food! This restaurant also has a smaller cafe style area right beside it that offers breakfast options with cafe drinks. We went here for lunch without a reservation and didn't have to wait long to be seated. Its a small plate restaurant so we were told to order between 3 and 4 dishes to share between two people.   We ordered the Gai lan ($12), tomatoes ($14) and the bucatini ($16). The tomatoes were definitely my favourite - it came with whipped feta and sourdough toast and fresh tomatoes. It was such a simple dish but it was so flavourful and the feta was super soft and both of them went so well with the bread! The bucatini was a thick spaghetti like pasta that was cooked perfectly with lots of cheese and butter on top - loved it too! The Gai lan was served with a miso sauce and dried shitake and it was good but not my favourite so I probably won't get it again. Would love to try out their meat and seafood next time so definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I could argue that this is one of the best places in Calgary. The service is always great, the menu is phenomenal and the drink menu is better than most places I've tried. Completely worth 5 stars!"}
{"text":"We ate a ton of food and still refused us service after we prolonged our stay for drinks, and asked us to politely leave... our bill is $220.00 and we have been asked to leave by aaron the barkeep.  We would like to ask why our night had to be killed early.. because of this experience I wouldn't recommend coming here"}
{"text":"Beautiful space, friendly and engaging service, and fantastic food.  We had the roasted tomatoes and whipped feta on sourdough toast, potatoes, and the spaghetti - all were fantastic with a real depth of flavor.  The pickled melon was very good, but not quite as delicious as the other dishes.  For dessert we had the butterscotch pudding and it was unbelievably good - truly a showstopper."}
{"text":"I could not remember anything but the food when I was eating. It has to be one of the best boutique food I have eaten in awhile and I am a foodie and often eat in interesting places. Fresh, innovative and flavorful, with a delicious lightness of being - the food literally makes music in your mouth - and the best part - completely affordable."}
{"text":"Ten Foot Henry is another place in Calgary that's placed their focus on small, shareable plates. The kicker here is that the menu is driven by vegetarian dishes, which must be a first for meat eccentric Alberta.  The interior is absolutely gorgeous. We made reservations for a late dinner Friday night and the place was bumping. Clearly, this was the place to be. The mix of picnic tables, booths and bar seats along with the hanging plants and open air concept makes for a cozy, hip dining room. Very similar vibe to Pigeonhole.  There were four of us so we decided to share a bit of everything. When we asked our waiter for recommendations, he said everything was good (eyeroll). How helpful.  - Crudo ($14.00) - yooo, this was delicious but you only get three TINY slices of yellow fin.  - Omelette ($11.00) - this was light, airy and way better than expected, especially coming from someone that isn't obsessed with eggs. The sprinkle of truffle complimented the omelette perfectly.  - Tomatoes ($14.00) - the bread was great and I liked how they grilled it but to be honest, this dish was just average. The tomatoes weren't bursting with fresh, summery flavour and the whipped feta was really, really subtle.  - Adobo chicken ($21.00) - interesting with the Filipino twist. The chicken was tender, juicy, moist but again, small portion.  - Cacio e pepe ($16.00) - Tomtom was in heaven with this dish and said he could have ate a whole plate himself. The pasta was al dente, very cheesy and rich.  - Dumplings ($9.00) - the \"dumplings\" reminded me of the ones you get at German restaurants (knödel) but TFH's version was bland and pure gluten. Don't waste your money on this one.  Right now, I'm on the fence on whether I'm a fan of TFH or not. Some good dishes, some misses - I'd need to come back and try a few more dishes to get a better gauge on things. 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"The latest hip addition to Calgary's food scene, Ten Foot Henry is mentioned in conversations left and right. My first question is: Who is Henry?  Regardless, the ambiance of this restaurant is lovely. Bright white space with a humble feel delivered by the wooden furniture, which is complimented by an abundance of green leafy plants found throughout the restaurant. They have a small open kitchen at the back where all patrons can sneak a peek at the action happening. Service was friendly and attentive. I was greeted by a hostess who stood at the entrance when I walked in and my server was quick to give me a glass of water while I waited for my party to arrive.  Everything started off gravy... and then came the food. The menu looked great! But as we got to sampling the food, everything sort of went downhill unfortunately. We ordered the Henry salad, salt roasted potatoes, baked yam, yakitori chicken, and the side egg yolk, serrano ham, toast, fondue.  The Henry salad was super sour, the vinaigrette dressing used was way too overpowering. We had to mix bites of the salad with the other dishes to mellow out the sour taste. I like to think I have a high tolerance for sodium as I'm a savoury person, but the salt roasted potatoes had me reaching for my water between each bite. The salt was not evenly spread out and some bites made me feel like I should down the entire communal water bottle. The potatoes were served on a generous bed of mayo, which was good but in the end I felt like I could've remade this dish at home (with a more healthy dose of salt). The baked yam was good, nothing wrong with it but also nothing outstanding. The yakitori chicken was decent, but not as strong flavoured as it could've been. And lastly the egg yolk/serrano ham/toast/fondue was good, but again felt like something I could order at another restaurant. So to sum up my food experience, the \"best dishes\" of my visit was the baked yam and egg yolk/serrano ham/toast/fondue dish, but was it good enough to warrant a return? Ehh.. I don't think so. If the best dishes we had were nothing spectacular, why bother. My friends and I were bummed out with the food. I'm not sure what happened, can someone tell me if we ordered the wrong dishes?"}
{"text":"Love this place. Trendy and tasty food. Can be quite casual. Some seats are super tight together though so if you're wanting privacy this probably isn't great for that."}
{"text":"I must say the service was excellent. Upbeat, informative and they always checked on us between each dish.  The atmosphere was hip and comfortable, but very noisy. It's not intimate and you will be talking over others and the deep base music they have playing.   The food was very well prepared and had a lot of flavour. They said their dishes are a family sharing style and 4 dishes would probably be enough for us. I think 5 or 6 would have worked better for us.   We tried the Tuna Crudo, Jerk Cauliflower, Green Beans and Bucatini dishes.  The dishes are quite small and like another reviewer said more like appetizer sized. The Tuna was especially small with only 4 thin pieces of fish.   So to get a decent meal when each dish ranges from mid teens to over $20 per option you can expect to still pay between $30-$40 per person without drinks. They also don't offer appetizers, they just bring out one choice at at time.   We still enjoyed our visit and would eat here again."}
{"text":"It was a while that I was at Ten Foot Henry, but it still deserves a review.  The menu is pretty small, but the dishes are unique, interesting and incredibly tasty.  I like that it is family style dining.    I would give it 5 stars, but I found it a little cramped and very loud."}
{"text":"Fun, swanky place. For the price we paid, we expected a little more food. Also, it was tasty, but not extraordinary. They make cauliflower taste better than I thought you could, but still, its cauliflower. The asparagus was a little undercooked. The salmon was done well, but it was basically just a plain, small serving. I expected either a bit more or something more flavorful than a cheaper restaurant."}
{"text":"It's rare to find such genuine service. Kudos to Sean, Jill and Kyle for making our dinner so special. Oh. And the food was great, too. We rolled into Calgary from Jasper tired and hungry only to find the Ctrain down for the weekend. We wandered lost until we literally sought refuge here late and hungry. Sean made sure we had a seat and checked on us several times. Jill was amazing for recommending the tomatoes with whipped feta and toasted sourdough, and she took care of us the whole time. The yellow fin tuna was fresh (crudo) and perfect. We also had seared halibut with a amazing blend of seasonings. It's rare to find such a perfect blend of tastes. The butterscotch pudding topped it all off--thanks to Kyle for finding is the last one!  Mostly, this place saved us from not a great introduction to Calgary. It's loud and alive and has great food and wonderful people. Make a reservation. It's busy well until 10 o'clock."}
{"text":"I was in town for work and I Google Tons of restaurants and let me tell you, this was the best out of all the ones I visited (River Cafe - ANJU- Charcut and cilantro). The food at Henry is delicious and the selection of craft drinks/wine are amazing. I literally went there twice ( and I never try to go back the same restaurant when I'm in a new city)"}
{"text":"The service and food were amazing.   The staff worked well together to aid in the experience.  Plates are served family style so everyone can have a bit to try.  We will definitely recommend the restaurant."}
{"text":"We had dinner here tonight. Good, not great food, at prices that promise more than they delivered.  The menu is annoyingly deceptive - it's like it's deliberately (almost maliciously?) un-helpful. It contains no information about how much food each dish actually has, and we discovered some outright falsehoods about the contents of each dish. For example, we ordered the scallops. This \"family style\" dish contained all of three scallops, which works out to ±$10 apiece. I only had half of one, because the strongest flavour note was disappointment. They were supposed to come with \"prosciutto, olive, tomato, herbs\". There were some microscopic bits of prosciutto, seemingly no olive, but a lot of some kind of greens (frisee? escarole? I'm not sure what to call it). Everything else on the plate was nice, but it wasn't what the menu said would be there - which is distinctly odd. (This is just one example of many. The waitron told us that the main ingredient in the 'raw chocolate truffles' is dates. What even IS 'raw chocolate'? Turns out to be cocoa powder. Hope you're not allergic to dates.) The other things we ordered were the pickled melon, and the bucatini cacio e pepe. The pickled melon was interesting, but kind of too sour, and was almost more ham than anything else. The bucatini we ordered at the waitron's suggestion. It turned out to be pleasant but nondescript pasta with white cheese and black pepper (that's really pretty much all I can come up with to say about it. It's like Kraft Dinner without any of the nostalgia/charm/msg). I also had the cucumber collins, which was interesting but not outstanding. By far the win of the night, flavour-wise, was the glass of syrah my wife ordered. She didn't get to finish it because the eager-beaver staff took the glass with a few sips left. In hindsight, we should've seen that coming - they tried (3 times) to get me another cocktail when my glass still had a third left. Staff were really attentive, verging on overly so. Attentive service is great! Having 3 different people ask in a span of 2 minutes whether they could get me another drink is annoying, though. Our server also offered basically no information about anything on the menu until we pressed her."}
{"text":"Loved the entire experience. Spotless, fantastic service, wonderful food. Great addition to the neighbourhood-will be back for their hipster version of crime brûlée!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!  There is nothing bad on menu. Some faves: Bucatini, Peruvian chicken, tomatoes with creamed feta and the yam tortilla. One of our faves when we are in Calgary. Long wait though or make reservations in advance."}
{"text":"I am amazed at this restaurant. So I was on Yelp looking for good lunch place and this place popped up. So I know I have to try it. Its tapas style.  We ordered: 1) Gai Lan 2) Fried Potatoes 3) Hanger Steak  4) Spring Salmon  Every one dish was amazing. My favorite was the spring salmon. It was cooked perfectly. Salmon was moist inside. The sauces goes really well with it. Fried potatoes were delicious. Not too much dill pickle sauce that over power the potatoes. It has jalapeno in it but I couldn't taste the spiciness in it. hanger steak was good as well. Gai lan was interesting. The mushrooms in the gai lan was like jerky style. But they were delicious and not hard or dry.  Overall, loved the place. Highly recommend coming here.  Portions are not too small and is enough for 3 people."}
{"text":"Cool, hip joint with a laid back attitude and a fun vibe. Service is probably some of the best I've encountered in Calgary in a while and the ambiance is fantastic. So I feel bad when I say this, but the food wasn't standout for me.   I believe the owners of this restaurant are the same as Una which is why you can see the inspiration behind some menu items crossed over like the kale Caesar salad. I love the kale salad at Una but for some reason it just wasn't as great here. Maybe it was lacking more zest or maybe the kale wasn't massaged enough but either way it was meh at best. The next item we had was the mushroom omelette which was exactly that -  a mushroom omelette. I don't know why we expected something different or more unique but it's simply an omelette you can make at home. It was good but would I pay money to eat it for dinner again? Probably not. The third dish that came out was the salmon. Cooked well but again somewhat plain and didn't stand out. Finally we had a tomato based pasta dish which I thought was fantastic. Probably the best dish of the night.   I wish I tried the dessert everyone raved about but I was too full and also didn't want to waste the extra calories on what already seemed like a just okay meal. Overall, I like the atmosphere and vibe in Ten Foot henry but I probably wouldn't make a trip back here unless requested by someone else. Of the four dishes we had, 3 were things I could replicate at home or have the more enjoyabe version at Una so I'll do just that!   My personal thoughts aside, if you haven't tried this restaurant I definitely recommend you go. It's another beacon of innovative cuisine that is slowly popping up in Calgary and deserves the attention it is getting."}
{"text":"My wife went for dinner here on business and loved it so we went as a family and took our two boys aged 5 and 8. Great format where you can select a bunch of dishes and share, that way everyone get to try and figure out what you like the best.   They serve a creative and flavorful ceasar salad, the tomatoes are full and ripe perfectly paired with feta. The steak was super under done unfortunately but the seasoning was spot on.   Great location and the space is uniquely decorated but for some reason it feels really crowded and is super loud. Not a bad trade off for amazing food and service but just something to consider."}
{"text":"You need a reso to get into this place, and for a good reason... it's amazing! i've been to 10 Foot Henry twice and both times I was nothing but impressed. My favourite dish has to be the 'Tomatoes' my god it's good, life changing rather.   I love the sharing plates, it's my favourite way to dine because you get to try so many things! It also makes the experience more like having dinner at home with your family!   There are a lot of great vegetarian options on the menu, so don't be shy, there veggie section is huge! I've never gotten around to dessert because I'm usually stuffed by the time we are done but one day I'll head back and give it a go.  This place is a must in Calgary for sure!"}
{"text":"I thought when we were visiting Calgary we were going to have a difficult time finding places for my partner to eat because he is vegetarian. Boy, was I mistaken!  Came across Ten Foot Henry on the 'Eater' Best of Calgary list and it claimed it was vegetable-forward. Intrigued, I went to check out the menu and shockingly, it wasn't one of those garbage vegan or vegetarian restaurants that try to disguise foods as other food and pass them off as appetizing. I couldn't book us in fast enough.   The restaurant itself is a bit on the small side, but it is gorgeous on the inside. Feels like you've walked into a garden paradise that is fit for a spread in Architectural Digest.   The staff was so great to us. Since we had never been there before, they explained how many dishes we should order (since its tapas style) and also gave us the rundown on some of their favorites. We ended up ordering the tomatoes ($14), chargrilled carrots ($12), jerk spiced cauliflower ($15), bucatini ($19) and spring salmon ($25). One of the other things our server let us know was that our dishes would come out as they were finished, which was super handy.   Everything was fresh, innovative and flavorful, with a delicious lightness. To be honest, my two highlights from the meal were likely the tomatoes (with its whipped feta and freshly made sourdough) or the beautifully cooked salmon. Each bite into each dish was like a new journey we were being taken on. Plus, the portion sizes are perfect and everything is just Instagram worthy (if that's your thing).   Thinking back on it, this was probably the best meal we had while in Calgary. We left so satisfied and just stunned by how much attention to detail was paid on each plate. Plus, the best part? How completely affordable it was. Next time we're in town, we are absolutely going here. But if you're trying to decide where to go: you must make a stop in here. It's 100% worth it."}
{"text":"Went in for dinner a few nights ago, very busy environment! That being said, make sure to book a reservation well in advance. Meal sizes were perfect for sharing! I'm not sure I'd be going back very soon, food was a bit bland for my liking. Although I did enjoy the ambiance."}
{"text":"Exceptionally good. Very clean and comfortable restaurant. Staff is amazing. We ate here twice this week. Jill was fantastic. We tried about 10 different dishes and can't complain about any. Both pastas we're perfectly cooked. Must save room for the butterscotch pudding. Wife claims it's the best desert ever."}
{"text":"Perhaps my favorite place in all of Alberta, and one of my top three in all of Canada. We ordered the pancake and the avocado toast but I didn't remember to snap a photo of the pancake before I had eaten a significant portion... Really it was the best pancake I had ever tasted.   I really liked the sharing plates and the ability to size your meal to how hungry you are by adding dishes. The staff is also very attentive and friendly, service is top notch."}
{"text":"Extremely good food, relaxed atmosphere, great service and nice choice of music. Probably one of the best restaurants I've been too. Would definitely recommend and go again."}
{"text":"Walking into this restaurant is like walking into a beautiful garden terrace; whoever designed this space should be given an award! The dinner was amazing and the service even better but the dessert... dear lord!... the salted caramel, butterscotch, sponge toffee pudding was enough to make me set up a tent and move in!"}
{"text":"Great experience every time, right from the appetizers to mains, and the coconut cake slice is amazing. One of my favorite places in Calgary."}
{"text":"Wow. What a great surprise. Would never have known it was even there, if not for Yelp. Food was Fantastic. Staff was friendly. Right across the road from Hotel Arts."}
{"text":"This place is just phenomenal. We got one of the chef's tables, which was a lot of fun. The food is just sublime-- it's delicious, beautiful, and super creative. Our waiter was fun and fantastic! This place could not have been any more perfect."}
{"text":"Ten Foot Henry is named after a Calgary Icon who happen to be a comic strip character.  They are conveniently located on 1st street SW with their 'little henry grab and go' café right next door. Ten Foot Henry is an all-day restaurant that offers family style dining.  Tiff and I both had a Friday off so we decided to meet for lunch, Ten Foot Henry is close to her neighbourhood so we decided to walk over from her place.  The interior is beautiful, rustic looking with wood trimming and columns. There are some wooden benches for seats as well they have a large marble table in the center that seats about 8 people and an open concept bar/kitchen so you can see your drinks and food being made.  Still or sparking water is offered and we were handed menus. Our server was very informative, offering suggestions and when we had questions, she knew how to explain the dishes well. Since its family style, Tiff and I ordered a Caesar salad, pan roasted gai lan, yam tortilla, and the roasted cauliflower.  Waters were frequently filled as we chatted and our dishes came. First, the delicious looking casesar salad came - it was topped with a fried egg that was sprinkled with chopped cashews and pecorino cheese was scattered throughout the salad. The dressing was light, didn't overpower and everything mixed together was a great meal. The roasted cauliflower came as a half head, egg bagna cauda style which is typically made of garlic, anchovies, olive oil and butter but this dish didn't have anchovies instead, some green olive type mixture on top. The cauliflower was perfectly roasted with dark tips and garlic bread crumbs were sprinkled on top, I`m not normally a huge fan of olives but whatever it was on top, it mixed well with the breadcrumbs and cauliflower and it was tasty. Tiff and I were some big fans of the yam tortilla, which essentially was a piece of thinly sliced yams that is made with sumac and topped with nigella sour cream. Super simple yet so heavenly. Lastly, the pan roasted gai lan which is also known as Chinese kale was really tasty - there was this salty tahini, miso and ginger sauce wiped on the plate with the gai lan placed on top sprinkled with some fried shiitake mushrooms. I appreciated that the gai lan was blanched and left unseasoned because the sauce was salty enough to balance the dish.  Overall, the food was flavorful, the service was great, we left pretty satisfied and we felt that we ate fairly healthy with no guilt because it was pretty much all vegetables so...super healthy, right? ;)  I will return to try their weekend brunch and dinner menu another time for sure!"}
{"text":"This place isn't officially related to the old Ten Foot Henry I think but I like all the references to its namesake! This place is meant to be experienced share plate style and for 2 people the waiter recommended we order 4 plates. We sat at the chef's bar which was actually pretty fun to watch them in action! As others have previously mentioned this place is pretty vegetarian friendly, although I don't think this would be the case if you are a stickler. I would be sure to read the menu carefully and look up/ask about things you don't know. The menu just lists each dish's ingredients and there were some dishes that I could see people thinking are vegetarian but actually come with some slices of ham or something. Personally, I don't really care if there is meat on the same dish (it wasn't cooked into anything) but if you don't even want meat touching your food I don't think there are very many purely vegetarian dishes.  We had the pickled melon, baked yam, mash, and spaghetti. The pickled melon also came with pickled baby cucumbers and cured ham and I quite enjoyed the melons. I didn't think melons would pickle well but they do! The baked yam also came with pieces of meat and I thought the potatoes themselves were just regular baked yams. The mash was super unique though; I've never had mashed potatoes that were so smooth and creamy. I thought it was an omelette when I first saw it but lo and behold it was potato! It's mixed in with yoghurt which gives it an interesting dairy flavour and probably contributes to the super smooth texture. The spaghetti was really good. The noodles were very chewy and the sauce was not very heavy and very flavourful. I don't think I'm going to become a regular at Ten Foot Henry but for special occasions and for a unique place to take people, I think it's a great option!"}
{"text":"As a vegetarian walking into this fantastic new addition to Calgary which is 70 % vegetarian is like walking through the pearly gates of heaven. Every single damn dish we tried was absolutely satisfying with a visually stimulating presentation to match. I don't even have to suggest one dish because they were all equally good but if I must... The kale and mushroom tempura was special! This place has jumped to the top of my new favourite restaurant with ease."}
{"text":"The place to take your vegetarian friends and family! It's a lovely spot that is easy to get to, and has a fun, bustling vibe. There are meat options as well if you have people in your dinner party who must eat meat. The food is flavourful and very inventive, and the cocktails are delightful. The staff is also very friendly and helpful!"}
{"text":"There's so much hype about this venue I was excited to try it! I think it's a tad overrated.  It is definitely \"hip\" and has a great atmosphere. Nice place to share a few drinks & unique dishes with friends.  I had pretty high expectations and although I left feeling happy & satisfied, I was also a little underwhelmed. For starters, their drink selection could be better in every aspect- wine, beer & cocktails. Second, the food was good, but some of the dishes were a little bland, definitely missing that \"wow\" factor. We had the carrots, sweet potato, steak, tomatoes, and the bucatini. The tomatoes were the only dish to stand out, definitely a win. All the other dishes were good, and had the potential to be great, but didn't quite make it.   They were also 35 minutes late with our reservation, and didn't offer a thing for the inconvenience of having to stand awkwardly in their entry while we waited. (Put a bench in there or something!)  I wouldn't mind trying a few other things on their menu, but there are a lot of other places I would rather check out first. I'm in zero rush to go back."}
{"text":"Love this funky place. Great food, playful and relaxing vibe, with very good service."}
{"text":"Great restaurant in Calgary. Solid options including solid poutine and some really eclectic menu choices."}
{"text":"Great place to eat!  Visiting from out of town and stumbled upon this gem.  Sit at the bar and watch the chefs create the restaurant's tasty plates.  Steph was great, helping out with some choice selections, as it was my first time eating at Ten Foot Henry.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere, the service, the food; everything was great in this relatively new restaurant.   There's a large variety of menu items with the idea that you *share* with others what you ordered.   Certainly a welcome addition to the already bustling restaurant scene here in Calgary.  Do yourself a favour and try the tuna crudo. You're welcome."}
{"text":"This spot was recommended to us by a handsome man named Jay who works at Holt Renfrew. We decided to trust him and give it a try since he was so stylish.  He said that this place was THE new hot spot with outstanding food. Boy was he right. Harold, who met us at the door, couldn't have been kinder to us. The decor is simple but unique. Kind of eco friendly meets chic. The food you ask? O.M.G. Amazing. No...divine. The flavors they have put together are so unique, some I've never even imagined. A MUST try for anyone in the area."}
{"text":"We took a chance on this restaurant- it was a short walk from our hotel. The host, Harold, was very pleasant and made sure we knew when our spot would be available. We were seated at the bar that is in front of the kitchen so we saw how hard the chefs worked. The waiter, Rob, was also an excellent host and took good care of us. The main thing is, we felt respected by the staff at TFH. It was apparent they want everyone to feel at home and they want to turn you into a regular.   The two of us ordered the carrots, the tomatoes and the beef. All were excellent and fresh. Each plate was shared and there was certainly enough for two people.  I can honestly say that I will return to this restaurant each time I'm in Calgary."}
{"text":"On par with top notch NY restaurants. Very good value and awesome food. So glad that I went!"}
{"text":"It was meant to be!! We walked in on a Friday and they just had a cancellation so we scored a table! Yes!! I ordered a class of the house red and it was amazing! Super super delicious! For dinner we ordered tomatoes, Chinese broccoli, salmon and steak. Here are my thoughts about the food Tomatoes-they suggest smashing them together, I did and I wished it didn't. It became too watery and I didn't prefer it that way Chinese broccoli-delicious and spicy! Wowzers! Really good yet my mouth was on fire. Salmon-loves the mushrooms and lemon grass and the way it was plated Hanger steak-the best of the bunch. Cooked perfectly and I loved the onions and greens that came with it. Service-stellar! Water filled promptly, checked on appropriately-not too much or too little Fabulous spot that I would definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Ten Foot Henry has great service, good food and an awesome atmosphere. We made reservations for Sunday night - I would definitely make reservations because the restaurant was packed. The service was amazing throughout, from the time we entered the restaurant and when we left. My only complaint was that we ordered our food and drinks at the same time, and our food came out before our drinks. Otherwise, the service was excellent and our server made perfect recommendations, including which dishes are the most popular and the number of dishes to get.   Cocktails were spot on - well balanced and delicious. The price for the cocktails was fair. In terms of food, we had the tomatoes with ricotta and sourdough, bucatini and the peruvian chicken. All were delicious, and I would highly recommend the tomatoes. For dessert we had the butterscotch pudding topped with sponge toffee, which was unreal. I would have licked the dish if it was socially acceptable. Our bill came out to $110 for three dishes, one dessert and four drinks. I thought this was a good value for the quality of food and service. I will definitely be going back when we return to Calgary!"}
{"text":"I died and went to food heaven this weekend. Calgary is really killin the cuisine butt! Great quaint hip place. We were able to get parking right out front. 10 foot henry is this magical place you hear about but never see, welllll I've seen it! Super modern decore, simple, hip, relaxed. Our waitress was so nice, very informative about the menu. You also don't have one main waitress, if anyone sees your plate is empty they grab it and ask if you'd like anything else you aren't waiting around for your waitress who is probably super busy attending other tables. All of the food was impeccable. We started off was the tomato salad which had dill and warm cream cheese to spread on sour dough, the bucatini pasta, and the Peruvian chicken. All of this was good enough for 2 people sharing, it is served family style. Please get the caramel toffee pudding! Our bill came to about $50 which I thought was soooo good considering I also had a beer. I don't suggest this place for children, I don't believe they allow. I will be back here atleast 100 times now."}
{"text":"A hidden gem that somehow has a reputation with foodies as a go to place in Calgary, Ten Foot Henry is a fantastic restaurant with works of art on the table.  The doorway is definitely hidden, but leads to an usually packed modern cove of creativity. The interior design has a home like feel with warm kid friendly walls accented by different plants draping the corners and edges. Real wood tables gives the diners a small outlook to what Ten Foot Henry represents; an artistic take on home cooked meals elevated into a gourmet art piece.  The menu is divided into the vegetables and the mains respectably. Though the division is there, the vegetables can be considered mains in their own right. Just like most dinners at home, they are meant to be shared with the family, so if you're with a few people, ordering 3-4 dishes is perfectly normal. My family ordered the carrots, cauliflower, chicken, and steak dishes. The chicken was by far the best chicken I've had from a restaurant in Canada ever. There is a cardinal rule in most fine dining restaurants to not order chicken because it's over priced, but this was worth it. A slightly tart lemon thyme reduction dresses a half chicken with a slaw-like remulade that helps cut down the acidity of the sauce. The chicken was not dry at all with a light crisp to its skin warming your taste buds wanting another bite after another. That was a good pairing with the cauliflower, which came with sweet potato chips and a light aioli that gives a nice mellow compliment to the chicken. The hanger steak was not the best. The meat was tender and had sharp contrasting onions and bok choy, but the sauce was way too overpowering. Horseradish should be used lightly, but the sauce was just layered over and ruined the whole dish. Lastly, the carrots were what we thought carrots. They were presented like every farm to table place, multi-colored full carrots roasted and rustic.   Though these are the dishes, trying all of them gives your tastebuds an adventure. Sweet and hearty carrots helped cover the terrible steak's sauce, with mellow cauliflower, and flavorful chicken, mixing and matching can be done with all dishes at Ten Foot Henry. A must try for all food adventurers and those wanting an elevated meal experience."}
{"text":"Food was okay. This may be a good restaurant for Calgary but when compared to decent restaurants in cities like San Francisco, Los Angeles, Tokyo, etc., Ten Foot Henry is not good at all. I am not a big fan of the restaurant owner and the chefs who work there. They do not take their job seriously and have no respect for their customers.   They use frozen endamame and have little passion for cooking. It's a mediocre experience and I won't go back again.  Good luck living in your own bubble cooking mediocre food in Calgary."}
{"text":"Atmosphere and service are great. Food out of this world. I had the whipped feta and tomato spread and could have eaten two more servings! Incredible. I all loved the chocolate avocado cake. Ahhh soooo good. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant! The menu has some consistent items but a lot of seasonal options too, everything has been excellent and broadened my palate. I love what they do with vegetables. Perfect spot for dinner"}
{"text":"I would have given 5 out 5 stars to Ten Foot Henry however the restaurant is very noisy and it was very hard to have a conversation. The food....let me tell you about the food. AMAZING!! Loved every single bite. The dishes were fresh, healthy and the flavours were to die For. The way to do it is that you order several plates and you share with your friends. We tried the rice with avocado, peruvian chicken, pan roasted gai lan and chargrilled hanger steak!!!! All the flavours were rich with spices and sauces.  Definitely check it out and indulge yourself in this cozy downtown Calgary restaurant !!!"}
{"text":"TFH was my location for a recent business lunch. The atmosphere was welcoming and our dishes (which we dutched) were great. Watch out for that cafe at the entrance though...deadly treats to indulge in even after you said \"no\" to dessert. ?"}
{"text":"Greeter was friendly.  Food was great.  Service...not so hot.  We ordered three veggies and two main dishes.  Veggies showed up one at a time with a long wait between the second and third.  Then they forgot to bring our main dishes (for a long time!). Rarely checked on, I finally got a chance to ask for our main dishes.  They had to go check to see if we'd really ordered.  Not even a quick \"sorry about that\" or drinks for the wait while they prepared our food.  Not impressed."}
{"text":"Came here for our anniversary night. We had a reservation at 5:00PM and was seated shortly. The restaurant has a open atmosphere and encourages people to share their dishes. Not the biggest fan of the music that was playing, but overall nice decor.   We ordered the hanger steak and mushroom tagliatelle for mains. Our appetizers were the tomato feta sourdough bread and fried potatoes. We also had a coconut cake for dessert. Food came out quickly and was delicious. Our favourites were the appetizers. The only complaint was that there isn't enough ranch on the fried potatoes. The hanger steak was cooked to perfection, but I feel that it was a bit TOO rare. The coconut cake is amazing and great to share. We were very happy with the meal and the price was good too ($80)."}
{"text":"Ten Foot Henry is everything you could want in a restaurant. Vegetable-centered menu, extremely friendly and passionate staff, and amazing flavours. The jerk cauliflower with pineapple mayo was the stand out dish in my opinion, but the tomatoes and potatoes were delicious and well-flavoured too! Super accommodating for not having a reservation (it was unexpectedly packed on a cold Monday). Fun cocktails and a fun atmosphere too. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Although I did really enjoy this place and would've given it five stars for the food quality and friendly service, I wish they had more options. Plus the portions were quite small and more seemingly for a quick bite rather then a full meal.  On a positive note, the ambience and clean and modern feel is amazing. Sitting here feels welcoming and positive. I do recommend trying this place out because the drinks were good and the quality of the food was amazing."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this restaurant.   Every time we go I find a new favourite dish. EVERYTHING on the menu is absolute perfection. Their chefs really have it right. Every place is perfect for sharing (unless you are me and don't want to share - it's too good I'm telling you!).  The service is always outstanding. The staff are friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.   Haven't been there yet? WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR. You're missing out big time.   But note to self: save room for the dessert. The butterscotch pudding is to die for. I'm not lying. You'll be glad you listened to me."}
{"text":"Wow! Such awesome food! Probably our favorite while visiting Calgary.   Place is small, make sure to make reservations. It gets packed.   We got the tuna crudo, Caesar salad, tomato, bucatini pasta, seared pickerel and spring salmon. Everything was really good! Love the chimichurri on the tuna crudo and the egg on the Caesar salad. The pickerel (white fish) was good too! The salmon was cooked perfectly. They do know how to cook fish right. The only dish we weren't amazed of was the pasta. It was okay, nothing stood out. Also they tend to put whole peanuts on everything- wish they use just a tad bit less or none, felt like it could go without...otherwise everything was awesome!   If I'm ever back in Calgary, I'll be sure to hit up this place and try other things!"}
{"text":"when we were visiting calgary, we heard a loooot of buzz for 10' henry and many locals also encouraged us to check it out! so we did!  very beautiful restaurant! the decor really brings out the whole farm-to-table theme!   we ordered beets salad, tuna crudo, caesar salad, buccatini, hanger steak and the grilled asparagus.  I remember it was a very fun dinner and service was very attentive, but unfortunately, i can't say it was a very memorable meal.  i think the grilled asparagus was my favorite? b/c i love my veggies and who can say no to the accent of truffle? the rest: many of the dishes, i've had before at other places and 10' henry didn't add any novel factor to it to make it the unique gastronomic experience for me.  Still, i'm glad i tried it out since i'm a farm-to-table enthusiast!     we visited on a weekday at night and it was swamped! i would definitely recommend making a reservation prior to visiting."}
{"text":"This is by far one of my favorite restaurants in calgary. Every time I go, I try to order at least one or two new dishes and I've never been disappointed. Get the butterscotch pudding! It's amazing. My only complaint was that the restaurant itself was incredibly hot.. apparently their AC was broken or just not on. They had one fan for the whole restaurant but it made for a bit of an unpleasant dinner."}
{"text":"Very good fun and friendly, efficient wait staff. But pretty noisy - a \"bright\" room, which made conversation a wee bit hard."}
{"text":"Amazing!  We showed up impromptu. They sat us in  front of the kitchen which I always enjoy. Great show and great food!  Grilled asparagus with chips was a great starter.  The Cacio e Pepe was delicious. Al dente to perfection!  The chicken adobo was juicy and soooo flavourful.  Ended with the raspberry lemon cake dessert special. So good!  Service fast and friendly and all reasonably priced for the exceptional quality. I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Ten Foot Henry should get ten stars!  But alas, 5 is the max, but I'm a ten foot fan. We had the privilege through a mutual friend of meeting the owner last night, Asia.  Asia is as sweet as the butterscotch pudding.  These people peeps also co-own the already fabulous UNA on 17th, so pizza and sharesies extraordinaires they certainly are.  Now down to the food, wine and service. Our server, most adorable, totally didn't get her name because I was too in awe of the live plants and cozy atmosphere.  At first it seems loud because of the high ceilings, but once you are seated it's almost like you're in your own little world.  Our server had glasses and a nose ring I believe (Asia, this server is amazing, keep her forever!)  .  We had two bottles of the rickshaw Cab Sav and it was super tasty.  For our munchies we had the beans (my fave), the gai lan, asparagus, ceasar salad (with kale and egg!), the carrots, crudo (tiny but good), chicken, and the salmon.  I adored everything but let's get to the best part. The desserts.  We had butterscotch pudding and the coconut cake.  The pudding, you don't even know.  It's this salty, caramelly, toffee yummy thing in a .. probably 12 ounce dish.  Absolutely incredible.  I would come here just for the pudding.  And everything comes out SO FAST!!  We were shocked but how quickly they serve, I adore this place.  I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! I had the Albertan drink that comes with foamed egg white and it was delicious! Ten Foot Henry has an amazing vibe, good service and we didn't have to wait long for our food (keep in mind we arrived during peak time). You should definitely try the tomatoes with feta and toast. They were great!"}
{"text":"Loved the restaurant! Food was on point with tons of vegetarian options. I had the tomatoes with feta, green beans and tagliatelle and loved it all! Ask the bartender to make you a custom cocktail if you're craving something in particular - glad I did! Ambiance is chic and modern but still down-to-earth. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Mmmm I'm happy I finally got to try this place out! Ten Foot Henry is one of Calgary's newest places to open up in the last few months and they have slowly being making a name for themselves. I absolutely love the feeling that you're walking into this beautiful, modern-lookin garden, filled with contemporary pieces like geometric vases and hanging fairy lights and plants. I absolutely loved the ambiance of the place!   Our server was excellent and very cheery about this being our first experience and was really helpful in recommending specific dishes to try for the first time. One thing I noticed right away was the amount of vegetarian and vegan options they had on the menu! Don't get me wrong, I'm a meat eater if you ever come across one, but I find that it's sometimes hard to find places with more then one or two veggie options, which can be tricky when you're going out with vegetarian friends.   Everything is done family style and I recommend approx. 4-5 dishes between 2 people. I would lean towards more 5 if you're more on the hungrier side. Everything we had was very fresh and bursting with flavour. My particular favourites were the crudo and tomatoes. The crudo had capers and dill with this amazing chimichuri and sesame oil over top, it was incredibly fresh and the sashimi just melts in your mouth. I'm not a particular fan of tomatoes, but I'm slowly starting to enjoy them based on the way they are prepared, and TFH knocked it out of the park! The warmed tomatoes were mixed with whipped feta and herbs that you put on top of toasted pieces of sour dough. The flavour is amazing and richness of the feta isn't as powering and it balances out with the sweetness of the tomatoes wonderfully. The hanger steak and gai lan with miso were also really nice. I wasn't a huge fan of the dumping with borscht as I fell short compared to the other dishes, but my girlfriend loved it as she's German. Although we didn't get to try the coconut cake, it sounds like something that can't be passed up and I will for sure give it a try the next time I go.   Overall I loved everything about this place: the mood, the servers, the ambiance and most importantly, THE FOOD. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We had the jerk spice cauliflower and char grilled carrots which were mediocre.  Pretty over priced for what we got, but perhaps being a vegetarian I know the value of what was being served which made the price tag hard to swallow.   The yam tortilla was the star of the meal. It had layers of thinnly sliced yam and topped with a delicious nigella sour cream. I'm not sure what nigella sour cream is but it was delicious. It was the most filling, most delicious and  the cheapest."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this restaurant. I have really enjoyed each of the restaurants that these owner have opened. The food is great the staff is great. I am a vegan and they are very accommodating.  The cocktails are unique and wonderful."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a gem! It's not until you enter the door and peek around the corner that you get the vibe of this energetic and bustling restaurant. While not an extensive menu, it's interesting, really unique and offers ranges of flavors that truly delight. Fun wine and drinks menu as well! If you can't get a reservation, opt to dine at one of the small bars -- either overlooking the open kitchen area or hang with the bartenders while they work their craft. Service was amazing and special thanks to Jessie for her fabulous recommendations! Definitely try the yellow fin Crudo, special caesar salad (unlike any other you've tasted - it's a modern version and truly delish!), and if you have room for dessert, try the butterscotch mini. It's the house specialty and worth every calorie. And the mini version is a great way to indulge without all the guilt! They also have a brunch menu on Saturdays and Sundays. I shall save that for my next visit!"}
{"text":"Great spot, everything works here - food, service, decor, background tunes, etc.  The salads are out of this world, huge portion and absolutely delicious.  All the protein main entrees have been good (been here 3 times), the tuna crudo a standout winner - not expensive, but you don't get too much (order 2!)."}
{"text":"Went here once for their brunch menu. Everything is definitely tapas style and shareable, but also the portions are a little smaller than would like. Food was definitely tasty though! Memorable items were the pastas and the beef. Yummy!   Staff were friendly and helpful. Very knowledgeable about the menu and what combinations would be good together. Also, very attentive with refilling our waters and bringing us drinks.   Overall, the atmosphere is very trendy.it is a smaller space, but there is decent amount of seating. I'm not a big fan of the higher tables with the bar stools; they were a little uncomfortable and the stools did not have backs."}
{"text":"Adore this place. I'd love to talk at length about the butterscotch pudding, but that wouldn't be helpful! The menu is VERY VEGETARIAN friendly, which can even be easily made vegan on a bunch. Everything is extremely tasty, delicious and with great portions! Service is always amazing. Atmosphere is fun! Oh... and the pudding *swoon*"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the unique menu and ended up ordering our servers recommendations and sharing so we could try a little bit and enjoy more. Server was knowledgeable about ingredients and they easily adpated to accommodate a dietary restriction."}
{"text":"Love the green plants scattered around the restaurant:) The share plate concept worked great too - we tried about five different dishes and had a lovely evening. Think tapas! Service was fabulous!"}
{"text":"I am so glad I came back here, the first time I came here I found the place overly loud incredibly expensive and the food mediocre-at-best.  I'm very happy to report that my second experience was a 180 degree reversal. The food was amazing the ambience had changed from a dance club  to an unbelievably overall pleasant experience.  My friend and I went in and had a great lunch the Hanger steak was perfectly cooked, the roasted tomatoes with whipped feta outstanding....I could go on and on. Our server was incredible attentive and looked after us admirably.    We were so happy that despite being over full, we both stayed for desert.  It is a little bit on the pricey side but absolutely worth every penny."}
{"text":"The best meal I've had in a long long time! Caesar salad, Chinese broccoli, truffled mushroom pasta and carrots -- all delicious. They are super accommodating to food restrictions as well. Their portions are actually quite big too where as we were expecting small tapas.  Vegan avocado chocolate torte is decent -- very smooth and almost moussey. Cherry donuts have the most deliciously tart filling!  Service is on point for the most part. It's really busy, so the servers are hustling hard. Ambiance is perfect for dinner, music is good but not too loud, eco-plant hipster vibe going on. Very cool place! Wish I lived here, so I could come more often."}
