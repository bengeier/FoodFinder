{"text":"Loved it! My friend and I came here after a night out and it was delicious! I can't remember the name of the pizza that we got but it was thin crust with lots of different yummy toppings.   Not the cheapest for post-bar food but for lunch or dinner I would definitely recommend! The staff here were very friendly and helpful in splitting our bill."}
{"text":"Really great pizza! Lots of fresh toppings. No limit on toppings!! I loaded my pizza with so much I could not finish it (so full). I liked the thin crust and the tomato sauce was flavorful. Service was good and I got my pizza quickly. I don't think they deliver though. Hope more people give this place a try."}
{"text":"Great:  For $5 before tax, customers can choose their own toppings and get a thin crust pizza in 90 seconds. The toppings include artichoke hearts and sausage meat at no additional charge. The resto also serves wine.   What they can improve on: They should bake the pizzas for more than 90 seconds, as the crust is not crispy and needs more time. The pizza doesn't taste gourmet even with fancy toppings."}
{"text":"This place needs more business. You literally cannot go wrong with a choose your own toppings style of pizza. You start with the dough and the sauce and you choose the cheese meat and veggies. Cooked to perfection in 90 seconds. Add a bottle of beer to your order and you've got yourself a dope Wednesday night.   Very clean interior, chill staff, good music."}
{"text":"Loved it!  Super quick, and you can get as many toppings as you want (Waahh?!?!) as long as it's not the personal size.  I really like their thin crust, great alternative to the other pizza chains in the area.  Good for a quick bite."}
{"text":"It actually does only take 90 seconds. Fresh ingredients and made to order are great pluses in my book. But, TBH, this is more like a savoury crepe than a pizza. Dough is thin like thin crust pizza but it's not crispy. You can't expect that from cooking for just 90 seconds. some areas of improvements: - get rid of the boxes. I can only imagine how much those things cut into profit. - use cheaper/thinner napkins and don't hand out a big wad of them per customer"}
