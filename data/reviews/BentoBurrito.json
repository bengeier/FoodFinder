{"text":"This is maybe the BEST food truck I have eaten at! I'm one of the hipsters that Dale E. is referring to, but sushi and burritos are my two favorite things, and Bento Burrito combines them well. I am happy to see a truck that creatively combines two types of food that I love.They came by our office today and I was honestly a little bit nervous. Sometimes when you combine two great things it turns out terribly, so I wasn't sure if I wanted to try it or not, but a couple of coworkers convinced me to try it and I AM SO HAPPY THAT I DID. I had the chiki-rito, which has a coconut curry chicken with peanut sauce and actual roasted peanuts. The sweetness of the peanut sauce combined with the pickled onions and carrots was tangy and perfect, the cilantro garnish was wonderful, and I loved the crunch the cucumbers added. This is an absolute must-try!"}
{"text":"A really tasty addition to the YYC food truck scene. Had the copious Cali-roll, a super soft flour tortilla packed with tons of bright marinated veg flavours, rice, avocado, smoked salmon, crab, and light wasabi mayo. Heat is customized through the amount of sriracha you ask for. Good value for money at $9.50, and they are pretty quick, for an overall rating of 4.5. Splitting the difference with the current reviews by giving it a 5. Nice that they have gluten free and vegan options, even if neither applies to me. Slightly surprised they hadn't seen the Mind of a Chef episode in which he invents and then that proposes the Korean burrito will take off. Great minds think alike I guess!"}
{"text":"Today I had the pork tacos at the Bento Burrito Food truck. Three taco for $12.00 not bad price. The tacos were jam packed full of pork and quit flavorful. The only complaint was that the soft taco shells fell apart, which made for a pretty sloppy meal, but I would eat here again!"}
{"text":"I ordered the California burrito for lunch. The food was fresh and the portion was large. I was too full after eating my burrito. The generous amount of crab was creamy and rich from the wasabi mayo. The crunchy slices of cucumber, avocado and rice went well with the cool slices of smoked salmon. I requested a spicy level of \"2\" which was perfect for me. Nice balance of contrasting textures and temperatures of the ingredients. I'm a fan. The quality was excellent and for $10.50 (meal for two) well-priced."}
{"text":"Quick, name 2 food items hipsters love as much as ironic moustaches and vintage cameras. Sushi and Burritos! Nailed it! Enter Bento Burrito.   From the second I saw the black BentoBurrito truck sporting asian style burritos in the parking lot of Market on Macleod, my inner hipster did its happy dance. (Which ironically, isn't a very hipster thing to do.)   BentoBurrito takes all the food items you'd find in a Bento Box and wraps it up with a burrito shell into one big mass of love. I could be wrong about this, but I think Bento Boxes are typically a Japanese thing, but BentoBurrito uses ingredient from all over Asia and americanized sushi, serving up items like the Chiki-Rito (Coconut chicken in a peanut sate) and the Cali-rito (kind of like a California Roll but in burrito form.)  I've seen other sushi/burrito places (like Sushiritto in San Francisco http://www.yelp.ca/biz/sushirrito-san-francisco?osq=sushirito) but BentoBurrito does it a a little better. Instead of using the Nori as the burrito skin, they just just use a regular flour tortilla and put Nori flakes on the inside to give you the flavour. Much easier to hold, eat, and a little closer to a burritto than mowing on a gigantic sushi roll that hasn't been chopped.  They'll fill you up with healthy and tasty ingredients for under $10. Hopefully you'll get a chance to check them out before next summer."}
{"text":"I recently visited Bento Burrito for the first time, after many weeks of curiousity.  The Chiki-rito was yummy, but I was expecting actual peanut sauce, not just roasted nuts.  Some crushed peanuts would have been yummy, but the burrito needed sauce.  Otherwise, the service was pretty quick, and I also appreciated that they offered gluten-free wrap options."}
{"text":"Great food and they can accommodate gluten free easily. I had the chicken - amazing. Daughter had pork, she said it was fantastic. Wife had the bowl and she loved it.   I'm sold, great food at a decent price."}
{"text":"Asian fusion in a hand-held burrito = brilliant  I forget how I heard about Bento Burrito but as soon as I saw it was downtown by the Bow, I knew I had to visit. I ordered the coconut chicken burrito with the gluten free wrap (it's worth the little extra wait) and I was not disappointed. The burrito was nothing like any other burrito I had but was actually exactly what you imagine when you think Asian fusion + burrito. It was a deliciously fresh convenient lunch for just $9.50 (+ $1 for gluten free wrap).  If you like Asian fusion, you have to check out this food truck!"}
{"text":"As a vegetarian, this place totally sucked for me! Was looking forward to a sushi burrito foe close to a month. I got the one with mango and tofu, and asked for the spice to be very mild. It was about 10$ and took 15 mins for them to make it. Well, it was so spicy that I could hardly eat it. The mango sauce was disgusting and the tofu inside tasted like it was made by someone who had never cooked tofu before. Every element of it made it impossible to choke down so I just threw it away, which I have not done in years. Don't waste time on that item on the menu! If you're a meateater though, you might enjoy the other things. No idea how different the items with meat may be, but avoid the tofu mango at all costs."}
{"text":"Maybe I have too of a high expectation or something. Well I ordered the Cali-rito and it had quite a bit of stuff. Rice, pickled vegetable , imitation crab meat, smoke salmon wrapped in a white soft tortilla.   So why I gave it two stars. I did find it a bit nasty gross.   Too much sauce. Mine was drenched in sauce.  The rice was not evenly spread. Most of it was at one end of the burrito. And the same goes for the smoke salmon and imitation crab meat.   Portion wise was good. This is not a poke burrito. Also everyone knows California roll comes with avocado. Oh well.  Too much sauce made it very nasty.   Don't think I will order this again."}
