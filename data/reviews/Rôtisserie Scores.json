{"text":"Very good prices. Excellent Rotisserie chicken. Salad bar is kind of meh, soup is always good."}
{"text":"Arrived for early dinner on a Wednesday evening. I was anticipating a BBQ chicken experience similar to the Chalet BBQ, but more like St.Hubert. The salad bar was included with the 1/2 chicken plate, so I checked it out for soup and salad. The salad choices were excellent and the food was very fresh and crispy. I had the chicken noodle soup, which was just OK. After my many years experience at the Chalet, and a few times at St. Hubert, I was very disappointed with the Scores version. It tasted to me like regular chicken cooked in an oven at home and the included chicken sauce was very watery.
The fries, were fairly similar to the chalet version. To sum up the meal, it was nothing close, but overall, I didn't leave hungry. The restaurant is very clean and comfortable, with tidy restrooms. I am sure that, if I had come there looking for a meal and not focused on BBQ chicken, I would have been very happy with Scores. My rating, to be fair, is based on my chicken meal only."}
{"text":"My dinner ruined at a Halloween night. I was starving but my two kids don't eat much and they are picky eater. So I wanted one kids meal so that they both share but the waitress said that we cannot share kids meal cause there is a free salad bar paired with the kids meal. I said my kids don't eat salad or any soup. She insisted that I take the second kids meal so did I. My sister and I each took a meal. Then my husband arrived, he ate already, so he didn't order, he just came to drive us. When the food arrived, I didn't want to waste the kids food since my kids aren't touching the second plate or could barely finish the first one so I asked my husband to eat it to not put to waste. The waitress came to warn us that we cannot share the meal. I told her I'm not sharing but I was forced to take the second kids meal and I don't want to waste the food. She said we cannot share it. I was furious, then my husband complained to the manager. It was the manager's first day and he didn't seem to know what to do at all other than apologizing. And yet, the waitress never apologize. Our appetite was cut so we just asked for the bill and paid in full. Never gonna step foot to any scores again. I have the photo of the waitress which I will share on my personal page."}

{"text":"Pour un scores j'ai vraiment aimer et ça en vaux la peine  le service est merveilleux et rapide"}
{"text":"Their main dishes -chicken or otherwise- are really dull. I was forced to come here a few times with my friend who is a fan of it.

Their salad bar is just Supermarket quality.

Unless you're trying to save money by going to the soup and salad bar which is a good deal given the price, I suggest going elsewhere for chicken etc."}

{"text":"Decent Food. Friendly Service. Great Salad Bar.

This Scores location is on the better end of what you'd expect from a Scores franchise. The staff are particularly friendly, the food is better than other Scores locations I've visited, and they have a bunch of good desserts that other locations don't have.

The salad bar at this location is also a nice touch. All the fare is fresh, and there's plenty of selection, ranging from fruits & vegetables to pasta and potato salads."}
{"text":"Really good salad bar with homemade soups - super fast and fresh - express food that was homemade. Great stop before going into airport."}
{"text":"food was good. but over priced. I tryed to dogy bag my left over food and the waiter tryed to charge me. never saw that before"}
{"text":"Scores has been around for twenty years and offers rotisserie chicken and ribs similar to Swiss chalet and St-Hubert.  The difference in their concept is a huge, very extensive and healthy salad bar filled with fruits, leafs, soups and numerous raw vegetables.  Salad bars are so passé, but this chain continues its longtime tradition and from what I experienced today, does it well. 

The chicken is so-so, rotisserie and cooked yes, but not crispy/golden orange brown on the outside and moist on the inside like Swiss Chalet or St-Hubert.  The ribs are fall off the bone tender with a great bbq maple sauce.  The ribs along with the salad bar, are what the 3 star average is for in this review 

Decor wise, it is circa 1980's, the restaurant is very, very clean and staff are courteous.  Service is good but the \"legacy\" waitresses's communication is curt and robotic, perhaps it is similar to their first day back then and then, a lot of them have been there since the opening from the small chatter in between courses; just like in the 80's diner movies lol. Usually, that's a good thing but in this case, it's \"you order, we serve\".  Legacy waitresses are usually known to \"honey\", \"sweety\"  their guests and show an enthusiastic, positive attitude and pride in their long serving experience.  Yo, Chillax g, this is a quick chicken joint, not the Ritz Carlton! Okay okay, gotcha!

So....the salad bar as a side With your meal is the big highlight, otherwise, Scores is a yester-brand that appears to have failed to renew itself and engage today's millennials; hope it sticks around to offer a consistent so-so rotisserie experience when no Swiss Chalet or St-Hubert are accessible.  

I'll now have another whole kiwi and some grapes from the salad bar before leaving; Merci!"}
{"text":"We come here for the salad bar... the chicken is always fine. It's a good moderately prices meal, which is what we wanted and expected."}
{"text":"Go for the Club House, BLT for two, a great deal. Make sure you get the fruit, salad and soup buffet."}
{"text":"I love the roasted chicken and the ribs here, especially when cooked and seasoned to near-perfection. The salad bar offers a wide variety of veggies, salads, soups, and fruits; it usually comes free with a protein dish but you can also order it alone.

The service is the only reason I'm deducting points here, they waiters could've been more friendly and caring; my water was never filled unless I demanded it, and the waiters seem pretty careless about handling the plates and my food.

Other than that, the place is very good for a gathering or family dinner."}
{"text":"I ordered food for delivery at work and they came pretty quick. Food was still hot and tasted great! I ordered the chicken leg box - comes with fries and coleslaw! So good! Yum! ;)"}
{"text":"If I could then I would have given this place 2.5 stars. 
Went there with my kids and the place is very family friendly. It has a nice service, colouring for kids, and a nice menu for them. The only reason I have given this place 3 stars is because of the general experience and not for the food. We, as a family, had a good time. 
The salad bar, was ok, but the kids loved the diversity, although the taste was less than ok. However, The soup was good. 
As for the main dish, well... all of our plates were cold. I wanted to have a fun time with my family so I just wanted to avoid confrontation and I didn't want to spend some time arguing about the food. If it was a bit colder then I would have thought it came right out of the fridge. 

I would go there another time, but I will ask them for warmer food. My kids liked it for a change. 

As for the service, they were nice and had a good smile. The place is clean but looks old. Another advantage is that there is an entrance from the other side to the mall. You can have a bite then continue shopping and spend a full day indoors."}
{"text":"A full salad bar. Fresh and tasty. You can go only salad bar or have it with an order. 12 bucks and five bucks respectively. Roomy, a bit chilly inside, you'd better have a light jacket on in. I had the fish and chips. The fish was ok but the fries can improve. Staff are nice and friendly. Prices ok. Parking no problem there's a huge parking lot. It is child friendly too."}
{"text":"On me dis que Scores a été acquis par Boston Pizza ???  La soupe minestrone et les frites me semblaient meilleurs!  Le service a été excellent, ça fait la job.

Comparé à St-Hubert qui est à côté, c'est bien mieux... le poulet qui est peut-être la viande qui coûte le moins mais au Qc on paye la totale.

2 x Cuisse avec salade et soupe plus 2 x bières en fût... plus de $45 ... wow.  c'est trop.  Mais pour fêter une vieille tante ça qui aime le poulet :) y'a pas de prix."}
{"text":"The salad bar was excellent. The food there tasted fresh and there's a big selection of salads and fruits. Service was friendly.

Their signature dish (roasted chicken and ribs) tasted overcooked and dried up.  Likely, these have been sitting in the warm up oven for hours.

Overall, I'd say the salad bar itself is worth the price charged."}
{"text":"I tried to order an item for take out that is apparently only available on the restaurant menu. Despite having ordered it many times for takeout in the past, although with a lot of difficulties, this particular time I was bluntly told by the person answering the phone that it was impossible to order this meal for take out. So I requested kindly to be put in communication with their store manager. The store manager came on the phone and indicated to me that under no circumstances was I allowed to order something that was only available for a sit-down meal in the restaurant. I then asked the manager if I were to sit down and order the meal, and when the meal arrived I would immediately ask to have it wrapped up for takeout, would I be allowed? The manager adamantly refused and said we do not want to see you in our restaurant. I told him that I was willing to give good money and he was refusing a regular client and he basically blew me off. In all my customer service life, I've never faced an attitude like this from someone who is supposedly a 'manager'  Sorry Scores, this one man has turned me off your entire chain. Sunday April 9th, 18:00hrs"}
{"text":"I guess the main reason to go here is the salad bar, but overall it just seems like a slightly worse version of St-Hubert."}
{"text":"FREAKING love Scores! The salad bar, the chicken, the ribs, the salad bar, the everything! 

Seriously, $10 for the salad bar. $15 for the salad bar plus half a damn chicken. 

Holy crap I hope no Americans find out about this chain. They could eat them out of business."}
{"text":"Good basic rotisserie chicken dinner. Service was excellent. 
The chicken was tasty although not the biggest chunk of bird I've had. Fries were okay 
As expected, a good basic meal with good value for the money"}
{"text":"I have very limited lunch options at work so it becomes a solid go to when in the mood for chicken.

The quarter chicken used to be better than St-Hubert but has really dropped in quality the last 2-3 times.
Still a bargain at $7 when on special.

There ribs are truly amazing, especially when on special ($15 for a full rack otherwise $22).

Their chicken strips are also pretty good but the sauce is tame.

When I eat there,  the service and decor is very standard,  the all you can eat salad is a bit too cold.

Their delivery is what truly gives them the edge ( and the extra star). Sometimes comes in under 15 minutes."}
{"text":"They do chicken and ribs, and have an all-you-can-eat salad and soup bar.  I had ribs and they were very good.  The chicken soup is fantastic, always has been.  The salad bar is a salad bar - there's a big selection, but I don't get excited over salad bars.

This place is a chain and it isn't \"special\" in any way, but it's uncomplicated, clean, has good service, and the food is good.

WiFi is free from the Starbucks next door."}
{"text":"Unfortunately not a great spot for any allergies such as Celiac disease. My fiancé and I stopped in after a six hour drive from Ontario for an engagement celebration trip in Montreal. Our hotel was down the road and he wanted to check out the Raptors game, so we figured the place called 'Scores' was a good bet to watch it at. I guess all the televisions in the restaurant are connected, so if you changed one you changed them all. The Montreal NHL team was playing, so there was no way we wanted everyone else to miss their game. I let the waitress, who was bilingual, know of my allergy. I ordered the new steak with mashed potatoes and vegetables, thinking it was a safe bet. As long as the gravy didn't come with the dish. I told her the gravy would have wheat in it, and I couldn't have it. She brought the allergy guide over as well, which confirmed that the gravy was the issue. I'm a pacifist and polite, so I hid my disappointment when the plate was brought. The gravy tray was in this center of the plate. Luckily it was in a cup, so I just took it off the plate, checked if anything spilled over, and tried everything. The vegetables that were displayed in the picture on the menu didnt match the ones I received. It displayed cauliflower and carrots, but I received green beans and peppers. I don't care for either one, so it was just a waste I didn't want to be apart of. I ordered my steak medium, and it came to me rare and bleeding. I used to get sick when I saw it, but my fiancé had luckily slapped some god damn sense into me and I've gotten better at controlling my weak stomach. The only thing I could really eat and enjoy were the mashed potatoes. I was heavily disappointed after explaining the allergens several times to receive what I did. The staff was nice enough, just some more education into allergies like Celiac disease would be great. One star. :("}
{"text":"Did not think it was possible to miss something as simple as bbq chicken with fries, sauce and bread... but they did simply because it was cold. My girlfriend took the general tao poutine which had way too much sugar in it. A bit of spicy to balance it out would have been perfect. Service was slow and we were told it was not a busy night. Guy filling up the salad bar was slow and was taking a lot of place making it difficult to take anything."}
{"text":"Lunchtime.....go for the chicken leg dinner which comes with the salad bar.
The salad bar is huge and amazing.    I eat at the salad bar and bring home the chicken to make a sandwich for supper.
The menu is nothing fancy - it's a bbq chicken joint.     It's not as good as others like Chalet BBQ or Cote St Luc BBQ (both in NDG) but it's big, comfortable, holds a lot of people and is very family friendly."}
{"text":"After missing all the lunch time specials we decided let's give scores another shot.

4:15 pm not a single soul was in the parking lot I thought it was closed but little did we know that people were coming in zooming by 4:30 to get the early dinner. 

We ordered a burger with salad bar and the chicken with salad bar. The lady who served us was just leaving so told us another woman would take her place. Th burger was supposed to take 15 minutes to cook which was perfect so we could enjoy the unlimited salad and soup. We got up to get our soup and It was fantastic it was full to the rim not a single soul had touched it minus the waitress standing up eating at the computer. 

We decided It was time for salad and so we got up to make our plates, the waitress was bringing our food out even tho we were don at the salad bar ? So we returned with a bowl of salad and our plates in front of us, had to move our main dishes to the side so we could enjoy our salad.

I don't know why she would bring us our food when it's just sitting there getting cold, unless they're trying to choose how much to eat and the soup and salad bar? She told me my burger would take long and it didn't, so besides that mess up the place  was good better then our last experience."}
{"text":"Pire service à la clientèle jamais reçu! Je vous conseil fortement de changer d'idée de restaurant. J'ai commander un wrap et malheureusement il était dégueulace!

{"text":"Scores offre maintenant un nouveau menu pour son bar à salade.  Le menu inclus du Chili, nachos, goberge et une bonne sélection de fruit."}
{"text":"La première fois il y a 4-5 ans j'avais été déçu ! ! Mais les 3 dernières fois vraiment excellent le service la bouffe le prix vraiment une belle amélioration ! !Je le recommande"}
{"text":"My go-to restaurant when the lady asks me what I want for supper. Love the soup and salad bar and I love all of their main courses! If you like chicken, this is the place to go. Fantastic for families."}
{"text":"Scores has always been an easy go to place when you're not too sure what you want but know you're HUNGRY. I usually go for the chicken, fries, gravy and start with the soup and salad bar. Unlimited salad and soup! Their chicken noodle soup is one of my favourite things to eat. Service is normally super quick, and in this case too quick. When my friend and i came here a few weeks ago we were not too pleased at how fast our main meal came. We had soup to start, then after we got up for some salad. As we came back to our seats with our salads, our main meal was already served, we had to push it to the side so that we could enjoy our salad. By the time we started eating our main meal, it had gotten cold. I would've given at least 4 stars but because of this i have to leave 3."}
{"text":"It was my first time in Montreal and, basically, I panicked.  I'm from America and I can't speak a lick of French and because I was travelling alone, I felt extremely out of place.  I tried to go to a local Asian restaurant, but, after completing my order, I realized they would not accept my Visa (or Mastercard or debit card), so I moseyed on over to Scores, mostly because they accepted Visa, and it looked rather safe.

What I got was a good value, but not anything extraordinary whatsoever.  I ordered the chicken pot pie lunch special--which was mostly bland.  I was mostly just psyched because it was just over $10 and that included a drink and dessert (and the chocolate cake was actually delicious).  Also, the service here was VERY good and they were very, very nice to me in spite of my limited language skills."}
{"text":"I came here on one random night. My friend went to work and told me to just ask her grandma for food whenever I was hungry. Problem was her grandma only spoke french and I was too shy and embarrassed to approach her for food. So what did I do? I went out, got lost and ended up here. In New York, the Scores we have is a Gentleman's Club so when I saw this Scores sign, you already know what I was thinking but instead I walked into a restaurant chain in Quebec.

This is what I loved about dining in Montreal.
- Service was excellent. 
- It's super clean.
- Waitress/waiter and people around you are super duper friendly.
- They were broadcasting woman's hockey (The score was a blowout). I never seen such a high score to any hockey game in my life or woman's hockey for that matter. Only in Canada!
- Just about everything comes with poutine.

The food here was pretty bangin. I ordered a rack of ribs w/ fries and the salad bar. The ribs were kinda small but very delicious. Fries with poutine is just heavenly. The salad bar was pretty good too. They had a excellent variety of toppings and dressings. The prices on the menu weren't bad at all, it was just the ridiculous tax that baffled me. 

When I got back to my friend's house, her grandmother was waiting for me to join her for dinner. She made me a whole rotisserie chicken w/ poutine. I didn't know how to tell her that I already ate and I didn't wanna disrespect her so I ate everything she made while she kept smiling at me. I went into one of the biggest food comas of my life."}
{"text":"This is just a regular Scores. I have been there twice recently, two different services.

The good: Food is good and hot. Salad bar is fresh. Service is usually good (depends on waitress). Busy, but not too much.

The bad: Entrance has a \"speed bump\" and you could trip and injure yourself (personnel usually warns you). Utensils for salad bar does not correspond to what you were trying to pick (radishes kept falling out of clips, spoon would have been better).  Sticky tables and floors.

In the end, this is one of the best Scores in the area. Pick this one over others."}
{"text":"Very disappointing Scores as we were a group of 30 people, who reserved, and did not have the food, or service we deserved.

The good: My thai brochette was good. The server was doing what she can with the group we were.

The bad: The group set-up was awful. Half of our group could not get up to go to the salad bar, unless everybody else would get up. And the manager totally refused to set up the tables otherwise, claiming other people could come and eat at those tables (restaurant was empty for the whole time). Serving food to our tables made it impossible for the servers to do it properly (because of the set-up), we had to pass the plates along everyone so that the person who ordered it could get their plate. Aside from the brochettes, everybody else's plates had issues (badly cooked, cold food, missing items).

The food was not great, but the management's incompetence and unwilling to listen to our reasoning was what ruined the experience. Totally awful. Avoid."}
{"text":"One of the worst Scores I have been to, and yet, one of the busiest.

The good: My Thai brochette was good. Salad at salad bar was fresh. Waitress was friendly.

The bad: The bathrooms are INCREDIBLY filthy! The floors there were covered with all sorts of papers. Took forever for us to get our food, a good 40 minutes. Tables were squished and waitresses were barely able to pass around us and rubbed against our chairs (which is annoying). Xmas decorations were still up, even though xmas ended 12 days ago. Floors had stepped on fries on it (dangerous for slipping). Salad bar was half empty (the popular choices were almost gone). When one of our friend asked were was the soup (taken to the back for fill-up, but friend did not know that), he got an INCREDIBLY RUDE ANSWER from a passing waitress that did not look at him. Took us another 30 minutes between our food and bill. 

This place was very disappointing and, for me, did not live up to the usual Scores standards."}
{"text":"Great food. It's our default midrange sit-down place. The salad bar was great before the revamp; now it's just phenomenal.

Shoutout to the owner / manager who genuinely seems to care about his customers and staff!"}
{"text":"Scores is growing rotisserie chain that I seldom visited over the course of the last few years. I go there for my favorite meal, the chicken and bacon focaccia and in the past it was served on a very fresh, huge ciabatta bread and now it has changed to a more.... economical style bread in both quality and size. What can one expect in Laval, land of the chain restaurants?

However, their side orders beyond the average fries and excellent onion rings are pretty terrible. The rice lacks flavor, the vegetables (if you call them that) are stale, taste like processed food and are probably are less healthy than the fries.

They have a salad bar for a few bucks more but I never bothered. Why eat salad at a Rotisserie? :P

The Pouding chomeur 'a la mode' is out of this world and a personal favorite as well.

Service here has been lamentable in the past and worth noting. Don't come here for lunch, they take A LONG TIME TO SERVE YOUR FOOD! Refills are a problem. 

The price tag is reasonable with a lot of options available during their lunches that don't hit your wallet too much."}
{"text":"We came to visit relatives and had a wonderful meal at Scores. The server was very patient with us while we browsed through the menu. The shrimp pasta was good, nothing too special about it and the salad bar was fully stocked with soups and salad. I really enjoyed the chicken noodle soup from the salad bar. My brother got chicken and had no complaints. 

Overall I had a great dining experience at Scores. It's a great family-style spot and it seems like a place people could go to find comfort food."}
{"text":"Service non existence . Total Misorganization . Over 90min for food service .
Stay away far away 

Also manager at this time slot useless .

Servers and managers clueless 

Also no seasoning to the food

Uncooked fires served as well




Not happy"}
{"text":"This was recommended by my Co worker. The same one who is famous for liking his food very plain and tasteless, but he was driving... so oh well...

I found over all for the price the meal I had was over priced and the portion poor.

I had the half rack of ribs and salad bar. Once I cleaned off the bones I found all there was of meat was about 3 tablespoons. Yes really.

I found the salad bar uninteresting and the glass of wine although only 5.00 was watered down

We also suffered with children running about all over screaming and playing and bumping into elbows of patrons."}
{"text":"Value for money, quick and casual. Great for families and if you like chicken. An extensive salad bar and soup but it doesn't change at all. Extremely friendly servers!"}

{"text":"It has been a long time since we been to Scores. The St.laurent location was cleaned up. They have changed and improved the salad Bar. Which is my wife's favourite since there is no other place in Montreal with a salad bar with a decent offering. Honestly the salad bar had a great selection of fresh vegetables, soup, and sides like hummus, chilli and fruits. The bbq roasted chicken was not dried and was pretty good. This is a good place when you want something healthy and not fancy."}
{"text":"Follow-up review: Had lunch there yesterday......and I maintain my original opinion. It's a good place to eat!"}
{"text":"I love this place and I love chicken, they have over 25 types of salads, the staff is nice."}
{"text":"I moved to Montreal almost a year ago and was told that I should try Scores as I like rotisserie chicken. We have Swiss Chalet where I was from. Finally got to try this place out at the Place Vertu location. The night started off on a good note but ended not well for me (my husband enjoyed his meal). 

Though I usually order the quarter chicken with white meat, I decided I was craving the dark meat more after our workout at the gym. So we both ordered the 2 chicken legs dinner. We were told it would take about 15 minutes, which is fine with us because in my mind, that means the chicken should be freshly made. 

Because the meal includes unlimited soups, salads and fruit from the salad bar, we headed there first. I really enjoyed the chicken noodles soup and lentils soup. The salads I chose we're good as well, though the mushrooms looked wilted. 

Then when our meals came, we noticed we only received 1 leg of chicken each. When we pointed this out, the waitress said that if we order another one and can't finish it, we would have to pay an extra $3 each (even though it was only supposed to cost $2.50 each leg according to the menu). I have never heard of this. On top of that, she should have mentioned this at the beginning or have it written on their menu. I told my husband I would have ordered the chicken breast had I known this, but shrugged it off. The waitress checked on us after we received our meal and asked how everything was and we indicated it was good (I liked their fries and that was all I had so far). But then I tried the chicken and noticed it was dry. I noticed my husband almost finished his chicken and told him mine was dry and said that his was really moist. The server never came around again to even fill up our water. When it was time to leave, my husband asked if we can pack up was was left of portion of chicken and half of his baked potato and her response was let her check and that was the last straw for me. I told her the reason there was chicken left is because it was dry. Instead of apologizing and asking if I would like another piece, she turned the tables around and said that it was my fault for not mentioning that when she came around to ask if everything was ok. I explained that at that point I had only tried the fries. She said that's not an excuse. I was floored but made sure I did not hear it wrong. I have never been spoken to by a server of any restaurant whether its a fast food or high class restaurant. Needless to say my husband still gave her a good tip because he enjoyed his meal, but I told him I never want to go to that place ever again."}
{"text":"Business lunch, came here with a work colleague.  We both ordered the hot chicken sandwich with salad bar.  It had no flavour at all!  He took two bites and stopped and I ate half of it (cause my mom taught me to not waste food).  Salad bar is mehhh.  Service was good but I'm just not a fan of this restaurant chain!  It reeks of plain jane normal!"}
{"text":"It's a good Scores location with friendly and fast service. Food is not a problem but the restaurant feels like it's in need of a makeover. 

It just looks old and depressed. The friendly staff makes up for it but it really does need a facelift. 

Lots of parking available, just be careful for the nuts that drive in that area."}
{"text":"Since it is my son's favourite place we popped in for a quick bite. I've said it in the past the food is consistently good the service is hit and miss. Well this time we were served again by Chantal who is by far the best waitress we've ever had at Scores. She was very friendly, easy going and super efficient. Twice we've been served by her and both times it was fantastic service. 

Merci Chantal! A bientot."}
{"text":"Cette fois ci jai prie la brochette de poulet a la.thaï qui est a 15,50$ le goût était bon la portion généreuse mais le service moyen. La serveuse était là mais sans plus. Pas souriante longue a venir pour voir a ce qui était nécessaire ala commande. Ont a même pas prie de café n'y dessert, car nous étions tanner d'attendre a ce qu'elle vienne. Bref, tout dépendamment des jours et des heures le service peut être excellent comme mauvais. Faut croire que aujourd'hui elle devait pas.être dans son assiette."}
{"text":"If you're from the U.S., the concept of Rotisseries Scores will make you expect a typical \"casual dining\" style restaurant (like O'Charley's or Chili's, etc). And, I guess, for Quebec, that's what this is. Except, it's Quebec, and their casual dining quality is better than most fine dining restaurants in the U.S. The chicken is flavorful, and not at all dry, the salad bar (a terror-inducing term in the states) is a mountainous area of fresh vegetables and fresh fruits. Yes, there are plenty of amazingly good fine dining restaurants in Quebec, but to really appreciate the higher standard of Canadian food, visit a chain like Rotisseries Scores, and you'll weep next time you see an Applebee's in the U.S."}

Every time I go there, I always order the same exact thing which is the chicken thigh with baked potatoes. The chicken is really good. A bit dry although you can dip it in a sauce. The customer service is excellent!"}
{"text":"Went for supper on Boxing Day. Chicken and ribs where decent as usual. The restaurant is back open after a major renovation. Decor is modern.

Salad bar, which was always ok is now even better. There is real bacon."}
{"text":"I remember eating with this restaurant with my host parent and we like getting the chicken. I remember this place was being okay and alright. The chicken was just okay. But I would take my family here though."}
{"text":"Scores is growing rotisserie chain that I seldom visited over the course of the last few years. I go there for my favorite meal, the chicken and bacon focaccia and in the past it was served on a very fresh, huge ciabatta bread and now it has changed to a more.... economical style bread in both quality and size. What can one expect in Laval, land of the chain restaurants?

However, their side orders beyond the average fries and excellent onion rings are pretty terrible. The rice lacks flavor, the vegetables (if you call them that) are stale, taste like processed food and are probably are less healthy than the fries.

They have a salad bar for a few bucks more but I never bothered. Why eat salad at a Rotisserie? :P

The Pouding chomeur 'a la mode' is out of this world and a personal favorite as well.

Service is generally solid and you get taken care of. Refills are never a problem. The price tag is reasonable with a lot of options available during their lunches that don't hit your wallet too much.

All in all, if you stick at the stuff that are tried and true it's a decent enough place to eat at.

Update

Been a few years since my review and frankly dropping this from 3 to 2 stars. Pudding chomeur is no longer as good as is half the portion. The sandwich I love is still there but once again, 2/3 of the original portion."}
{"text":"My opinion Scores has huge bang for the buck plates are full to the tilt, great hot chicken sandwiches, amazing chicken brochettes, wraps and fajitas are really good and I know my daughter thinks their Ribs are better than Baton Rouge it apparently is all in the sauce!

I had the chicken brocheete this night and it was amaing! This Scores is in the Place Vertu shopping centre and has 2 entrance one thru the mall and one thru the parking. was very clean, service superberb and courtious(as usually get at most Scores). food brought promptly and hot.

At this as well as other Scores I have been to the service has been amazing! Restaurant is always clean cutlery package neatly wrapped in a napkin, nice touch seems clearly hygienic :)
Koodos to Scores!!"}
{"text":"This Scores is my favorite! The Manager knows me by face here so I can always count on great above and beyond service! ;).

This restaurant is impeccable when it comes to cleanliness and every waiter or waiter show by there attentiveness how the like to work here. 

Tonight is a hot chicken sandwich night with fries and cole slaw which is really good here. 

They have approx 10 TV's, clear in quality. As at all Scores when you buy a coke come with free refills but you most likely won't have room for a second coke lol.

Seated fast and the waitress took my order in mins of me being seated with a smile as wide as can be, very pleasant lady.

Food came quickly & hot as usually an experience you can count on at pretty much any Scores toy experiences.

Again i love the fact that the utensils are wrapped in a napkin great hygienic feeling to this!

If you want a good hardy and affordable chicken meal, Scores rocks it.
total bill came to $14.08 tax in tip extra. Considering it is a reasonable healthier choice to a fast food buger trio which comes to almost $9.00 these days I think it so worth it!"}
{"text":"This Scores just got an updated makeover, introducing a more modern and light decor featuring wood panelling and a cleaner style. Although this location is older than the other Scores in Dix 30, it is now nicer, larger and offers better variety.

I have been coming to this location for years as I find it offers great value and is possibly the best family friendly restaurant in the area. My favorite feature is the soup and salad bar which can serve as a lunch meal in itself or accompanying side.
The new makeover has also improved this offering as the salad bar now has better choices with higher quality ingredients such as real bacon (previously used to offer simili bacon bits), shredded cheddar cheese, ricotta and new sauces like tzatziki or nacho cheese. There is even a larger variety of soups, usually 3 on rotation now instead of just 2.

The Scores rotisserie chicken is delicious, it's pretty simple to please. If you want something a bit more fancy, they often have special menu items ranging from Asian style chicken, seafood combos, healthy wraps and paninis etc.

The menu is always changing but the classics are there to stay so it's a safe choice for everyone."}

Un dimanche soir de pluie, après une bonne séance de pratique de tango argentin, je décide de mettre à l'épreuve le Scores sur le boul. Taschereau, à Brossard. Je suis un habitué du Dix30, il faut donc que TOUS les SCORES soient à la hauteur. ET BIEN NON ! Vous avez lamentablement échoué l'examen. La réception, très bonne, la serveurse, très charmante et jolie, tout va bien jusque là. Mais lorsque je demande de faire emballer mon combo suprême que je rapporte avec moi, pour ma collation de soirée, c'est parce qu'il faut aussi ajouter les sauces et les condiments qui se trouvaient dans le panier à service. Quelle stupéfaction, en ouvrant ma TOUTE PETITE boîte, de constater qu'il manque les savoureuses sauces et probablement quelques morceaux. Vous auriez dû y penser. Ils choisissent de réduire la commande afin de mieux entrer dans une toute petite boîte. Nous prenez-vous pour des cons ?
Il faut donc continuer à aller au Dix30, là où on n'oublie rien et qu'on nous traite comme de véritables clients.

A rainy sunday night, after a good tango practice session, I want to try the Scores on Taschereau boul., in Brossard. I already like the one at Dix30, they HAVE TO BE ALL AT THE SAME LEVEL. OR NOTTTT ! You have pittyfully missed the shot and crashed. The reception at the door is ok, the service is nice, charming waitress. But when I ask for a doggy bag with my supreme combo in it, for my evening snack, you have to give it completely, with condiments and sauces, and all the pieces. What a surprise at home when I saw missing parts in my combo in a STRANGLY SMALL BOX. You should have done better. Who do you think we are ?
No next time ! I will keep going to Dix30, because they don't forget things."}

Je suis un régulier dans ce restaurant. On y trouve du bon poulet, un bar à salades mais surtout des côtes levées, meilleures que chez St-Hubert. Les combos sont très intéressants et surtout très avantageux. Vous pouvez repartir avec votre surplus pour votre petite collation :-) Un endroit agréable avec un personnel attentionné et charmant. Ils ont des nouveaux cocktails, à essayer ! Livraison et achat au comptoir disponibles.

September 2nd 2012
I'm a regular. You find good chicken, nice salad bar and once and foremost better ribs than St-Hubert. The combos are really good and allow you to try many things. You can leave with your doggybag for a small snack later :-) A nice cozy place with good service. Try the new cocktails, great ideas ! Delivery and pick-ups available."}

Un bon souper entre amis, et l'occasion pour essayer un autre resto à St-Hyacinthe.
Servis par la charmante Catherine R. le repas s'est bien déroulé. La vitesse et l'efficacité des commandes fut maintenue, comme à l'habitude.

À la fin du repas, j'ai pourtant bien indiqué à la serveuse que je prenais les quelques éléments de mon plat pour apporter... INCLUANT LES SAUCES... et pourtant, seuls les morceaux se sont retrouvés jusque chez moi. Aucune trace des sauces. C'est la deuxième fois en trois coups qu'on me le fait. Ça commence à faire ! Est-ce une constance des restaurants Scores ? Au DIX30, ils le font, pourquoi pas ailleurs ?

J'ai fait une plainte officielle à Scores. Le dossier n'a toujours pas été répondu !!!

Sunday february 10th 2013
A nice evening between friends and the chance to try an other place in St-Hyacinthe.
Charming Catherine R. was our waitress, the meal went well, with usual speed and efficiency.

At the end, I clearly asked Catherine I wanted my doggy bag snack WITH SAUCES... and why not ! Unfortunately, arriving at my place I found out the order didn't pass. It's the second of three times it happens. Enough ! Is it a regular hassle for Scores ? At DIX30 branch, they do it correctly, why not elsewhere ?

I've officially complained about that matter. NOTHING has been done yet !!!"}
{"text":"Worst food i got for the price it is 
The chichen a la quebecoise didnt taste like anything, the rice was dry and the fries weren't so good 
The best part of my order was the drink ( coke) 
And when i called to order they didnt even know what was in their salads... 
Ill never order from there again"}
{"text":"Order a chicken burger, I get bread with lettuce... no chicken.
Order a salad, I get 3 day-old sloppy junk.

Call back, takes 2 hours to get a proper order.

Never again."}
{"text":"J'aimerais bien commenter de façon très longue et détaillé, mais je ne me suis jamais rendu au repas! 

Jeudi soir 19:30-20h, plus ou moins achallandé. Dès notre arrivée, nous sommes accueillis (ma conjointe et moi) et installés à une banquette, avec nos menus. 

20 minutes plus tard, toujours personne n'est venu nous voir! Pas d'eau, pas de présentations, pas d'excuses... RIEN. Nous avons attendu un 10 minutes supplémentaire. Même en mettant nos manteaux, personnes ne s'est souciés de nous.

Comme nous habitons prêt de cette succursale, nous nous y retrouvions quelques fois par année... J'aimerais dire que c'était ma seule mauvaise expérience. Au moins je peux me réjouir que c'était ma dernière"}
{"text":"Tres bon excellent bar a salade délicieux service rapide et courtois , sur 5 menus differents tous étaient tres satisfaits"}
{"text":"C ' est mon restaurant de poulet favoris apres celui des maraichers. Le service y est toujours courtois poli et a la hauteur bien que la jeune serveuse que nous avions n' avais pas le meilleur des sourires mais bon tout le monde a le droit a une mauvaise journée. Clairement ce restaurant fait mal au St-Hubert car a comparer les deux stationnements celui du St-Hubert etait vide comparativement au Scores qui etait plein. 

Tout est excellent a cet endroit le bar a salade toujours bien garni et frais, la nourriture chaude et a point et le choix du menu tout simplement bravo."}
