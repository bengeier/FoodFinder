{"text":"Off the main road (Parliament) along Amelia rd - one could easily miss F'Amelia. Nice atmosphere and ambiance. Freshly made pasta and pizza is always appreciated. Flavours won't blow you away and price is on the higher side. Servings are aimed at quality, not quantity. Service was decent though our waitress was a bit bossy."}
{"text":"I loved F'Amelia.  The servers were helpful and attentive.  The atmosphere was adorable and the food was great!  I would recommend the farfalle!  But next time I'm going to come back and try the charcuterie.  It looked yummy!"}
{"text":"One of Toronto's best new restaurants? Not based on my experience, but OK Toronto Life. F'Amelia is acceptable, but it's nothing special. Toronto has so much better to offer.

THE GOOD:
The focaccia our server gave us soon after we sat down was delicious. I would have been perfectly happy to fill up on that rosemary focaccia instead of ordering.

THE BAD:
The kitchen closes at 10. Since my reservation was for 9:45, our server was quick to point out we had to make up our minds soon. I thought this was a bit gauche. It's cool if a restaurant prefers to shut its kitchen early, but it shouldn't seat people 15 minutes before closing time.

Also, there were still three tables eating when staff began taking out garbage through the dining room. That's kinda gross. Isn't that what back exits are for?

THE PAINFULLY AVERAGE:
The pizza was nicely charred, but the toppings were bland (I had the 4 stagioni). The only pop of flavour I remember is the basil. The pizza was not hot when it came out.

The salumi/cheese board was good at the time, but didn't wow me in any way. I don't remember any of its elements in the way I've salivated over memories of other cheese boards past."}
{"text":"Delicious food and nice wine selection in a lovely converted century home in beautiful Cabbage Town...front patio is nice warm weather bonus."}
{"text":"Amazing thin crust pizzas, fantastic house red (a sangiovese), great staff and 14 wines by the glass. Now that is a start to a great restaurant not to mention a perfect addition to Cabbagetown.

My favorite pizza is the diavolo, which is a spicy little number that goes really well with their house red.  And the table next to us loved their margarita pizza! 

Last but not least, their patio is quite big and nicely situated viewing distrance from Parliament on the quiet street of Ameila."}
{"text":"I ate at F'Amelia tonight, after following them on Twitter since prior to opening. I was thrilled. All the people I met: Todd (one of the owners), the manager (I missed writing her name down) and Maurizio, the executive chef, were all concerned, caring people, and you just know they love what they're doing.

The focaccia and rustic bread brought at the beginning of the meal are beautiful examples of in-house crafted product. Actually, I'm very jealous of the focaccia, having failed at it twice this year.

Tonight I ate the warm mackerel salad as an appetizer. The fish was firm and fresh, fried from the skin side, so nice crispy skin on top, with some frizzled lettuce greens. Definitely less oily than what I have produced at home! Underneath lay ingredients that complemented the fish beautifully. Grilled radicchio was superb, providing charry bitterness against the fish's richness, and then potatoes and sunchokes to provide sweetness. Highly recommended!

Next, I had the seafood risotto.
One perfectly seared sweet scallop surmounting a seafood risotto that included shrimp, clams, and impossibly tender squid. Really. I was wondering if I was mistaken, or if it was something else, like some stem of a mushroom that I wasn't familiar with. Executive chef Maurizio Verga dropped by, and I had the opportunity to ask him about it. He cooks his squid sous vide! It gets added to the risotto at the last moment. Very tasty risotto.

To finish, I had the polenta with osso buco. This was my third polenta dish of the last three weeks. I thought the polenta I had at Rose's Cafe in San Francisco was tasty. This was measurably better. Creamy perfect polenta, with osso buco and marrow butter. There's rosemary in the polenta, giving it a strong herby oil that stands up to the richness of the veal shank. Sometimes polenta has so much cheese in it that the flavour of the corn is lost. Not the case here.

With the stew on top...the brunoise was perfectly cubed and tender, not mushy. The meat is so perfectly exquisitely rich, tender, braised long enough to be almost reduced to strands, but not overcooked to complete denaturing (which makes a meat taste dried-out). This dish deserves a revisit. I had the small one: I can see coming back and having the full size on a cold day. It's very much a cold weather comfort food.
 It turns out that Chef Maurizio is from Bergamo, just north of Milan, in the heart of polenta region. He really cares about his polenta, and it shows. Todd brought me a taste of a new wine he has brought in that goes really well with this dish. He knows his pairings!

I finished off with a small glass of a liqueur the Chef prepared. Similar to a limoncello, but greener, and more herbal notes. Worked well to finish the evening.

I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great wood burning oven pizza. The Norcini pizza was delicious. Time for tiramisu."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I passed F'Amelia on a walk with our dog in the autumn and were immediately charmed.  We finally had the pleasure of dining there last night. 

The food was delicious, visually stunning and the flavours were surprisingly complex.  I don't tend to frequent Italian restaurants, as I often find them to be somewhat predictable in terms of spices & dishes, but F'Amelia's food stood out. 

My girlfriend had the scallop appetizer, and I had the warm beet & honey mushroom appetizer. Both were phenomenal. The scallop was melt-in-your-mouth good.  Their use of house-pickled ingredients was stellar. 

For dinner, we got the funghi pizza & the beet and candied walnut risotto. The pizza hit the spot, and the risotto was truly decadent. 

The waiters were friendly, the place was very clean with a cute decor, high ceilings and a friendly bar staff. 

We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Hands down one of our favourite restaurants in Toronto, from the ambiance, to the location, and of course the food. This was our 2nd time for a date and I have to say that it was a top notch dinner. We had our favourite appetizer Quattro Stagioni; crushed San Mariano tomatoes, fior di latte, artichokes, mushrooms, prosciutto cotto, black olives, and EVOO. My fianc√© had Gnocchi with roasted porcini mushroom, house made duck prosciutto, and parmigiano reggiano. As for me I had the braised beef risotto, and a beer from Side Launch. Great place to dine and will definitely return."}
{"text":"I have been to F'amelia three times because I continued to hope that the experience would be better next time. unfortunately this was not the case. 

The setting is lovely, and there is so much potential. 

I feel like I am a lone naysayer among so many positive reviews. I just don't get it. The menu is limited. There are no protein mains on the menu you may get lucky and hear about a special. Beware, the prices are astronomical. The portions are tiny. The food was bland and boring.The bartender has the stingiest pour in all of the city. 

The last time we went on a Saturday night with another couple that had booked on Opentable.com. We had to wait at the bar 45 minutes despite having a reservation.  That is where we had the smallest negronis I have ever seen!! honestly the drink looked like backwash.  

When we were finally seated we ordered a pizza to share right away while we looked at the menu, that took 45 minutes! we got our appetizers and then waited another hour for our entrees. The server was unfriendly and at the end of the night our bill was over $400. Go somewhere else, there are many Italian restos in the city far superior to this place."}
{"text":"Decided to try it out after reading a review of the eggplant ravioli (a house specialty) and boy did they live up to the article.  The restaurant is a pleasant surprise, with a warm, old world charm that draws you in to the cuisine.  Both the appetizers and mains were delicious.  The eggplant ravioli (the name does not do it justice) were superb with the eggplant rendered to a foamy consistency that was a delight to savour.  We also had the Pappardelle with rabbit which again was as delicious as anything I've ever had.  Great little place if you are in the mood for pasta and pizza.  Surprisingly refined dining for this part of town."}
{"text":"F'Amelia was the perfect Friday evening date night spot for dinner. 

It was super cozy, outfitted in what looked like an old house, with dimmed lights, small intimate tables, and light chatter throughout the restaurant. 

It was great. 

The complimentary bread was actually this housemade herbed flatbread. It was crispy and came in this cute vintage metal tin, and was amazing. 

I ordered the margherita pizza as my main and really liked it. No soggy bits, just thin enough, perfect amount of basil (I don't want too much at all) and cheese, and the crust was crispy and chewy. So good! 

My partner ordered the octopus linguine special of the day. It was a tomato-based sauce and had lots of chunks of octopus mixed in. He really enjoyed it, especially because it had a bit of spice to it, but I tried a bite and did not like it at all. I wasn't a fan of the fishy taste of the octopus (our waitress warned us the octopus would taste fishy -- my partner still seemed to like it!) and I much prefer cream-based sauces for my pasta. Also, the linguine was a touch overcooked. Not quite al dente. But pasta is better to be slightly overcooked than slightly undercooked anyway! 

The service was good and attentive, and things were ridiculously prompt. 

Sitting all around us were older couples sitting in groups drinking wine and relaxing. It was such a nice atmosphere. I could imagine coming here regularly if I lived right around the corner in Cabbagetown (someday!!)."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time here.  The food is overpriced and nothing special-so is the wine.  The ambience is crowded and brightly lit. They sat us facing the kitchen and in the corner.  The waitress was pushy."}
{"text":"Had a great time at F'amelia. The appetizers were the best of the night, especially the antipasto misto selection.  Corn soup was also perfectly sweet, creamy and chilled for a summer night.  Cocktails were good but expensive, not much selection of wine at a decent price.

I could of end my night there and gave F'amelia 4-5 stars. However, we order Primi Piatti which were alittle disappointing b/c of how great our expectations were then.
The Tagliatelle w/ braised rabbit had nice pieces of rabbit but the tagliatelle itself was overcooked. Risotto w/ fresh apple was ok, but was over powered by the vinegar.

Watch out for mosquito on the patio...came back w/ 7 bites.
Would come back for the starters....."}
{"text":"Read the one- and two-star reviews before going!

My sister was in town for just one night and we wanted to treat her to a special dinner. We've got a short list of terrific Italian restaurants that we could've taken her to, but decided to try something new. The reviews of F'Amelia on Yelp were a mixed bag ranging from excellent to poor. In this case we should've paid closer attention to the negative reviews.

First impressions were quite good. F'Amelia is set on a leafy side street with a quaint terrace out front. We started our meal outside but moved in when it began to rain. The interior is decidedly less charming and is a rambling mishmash of materials with no real personality to speak of. Atmosphere could've been overlooked if the food and service were top-notch, but they were both lacking. 

Service was fair but perfunctory and completely lacking in any sort of personal connection. We were there to have fun but the server never attempted to engage. The food on the other hand was uniformly poor and unoriginal. Arugula salad was just that--a pile of arugula. A $23 full-portion pasta was TINY and dry. But by far the worst was the baked lasagna that was served dangerously hot and was nothing more than too-much ground meat and noodles. When it finally cooled down we all agreed that it was bland to the point of tasting like a Stouffer's frozen entr√©e. 

The final insult was when the bill came. Before tip it was almost $300 for the three of us. Two appetizers, three cocktails, three mains and one mid-priced bottle of wine (a very tasty 2008 Sangervasio Toscana). We were astonished that such a mediocre meal could cost SO much more than other memorable meals we've had in town.

Ugh. With so many other fantastic Italian restaurants in Toronto, F'Amelia is one restaurant that you can afford to miss."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is lovely and I am sure in the summer that the patio would be wonderful to enjoy a meal.

Or maybe just drinks because the food is only meh.

Have been looking forward to trying it out for some time - I love any place that boasts fresh made pasta.  Firstly, we ordered the grilled calamari ($18) which when it came, I literally had to search for the pieces of calamari in the arugula salad.  There were about 6 small, salty pieces.  I would not call this appetizer grilled calamari, but an arugula salad and maybe some calamari.  For $18, I felt this was highly overpriced.  I don't usually balk at prices, but this was ridiculous.

I had the pasta special and my husband the pizza.  Both were mediocre.  The pasta didn't taste as fresh as other restaurants that serve fresh-made pasta.  The sauce nothing to write home about.  

Service was okay."}
{"text":"Pizza good, overpriced though. Service was reasonable. What surprised me is how fast the food came. That means that shortcuts were made. I believe that the pizza was already prepared and ready for baking or maybe half cooked. Apparently the pizza oven only takes 90 seconds, but pasta with seafood takes much longer. Still it tasted good. I ordered a Taglioni with \"clams\" and mussels. I only detected one clam' maybe two. It would be customary to offer at least fresh black pepper, even if they don't believe that you should add parmessan cheese; they didn't. The mussels and clam were clearly already prepared as the food arrived in less than five minutes from the order taking. For $22.00 I expect my pasta made to order and the seafood in it to also be made fresh. Perhaps they were frozen or prepared ahead of time. And come on, $3 for a glass of filtered water. 

I think they will enjoy much success if they make food to order only and calm down on the prices. Overpriced restaurants don't last. The local competition is really cheap by comparisson. 

We won't return."}
{"text":"con: service slow.  pasta overcooked, pizza crust slightly wet.  i wouldn't go back or recommend.  pro: location, and ambiance are charming."}
{"text":"Unfortunately my experience here was not really memorable and the food would most aptly be described as meah. In the spirit of fairness the beef tartar special was good and the wine certainly tasty, although at $14 dollars a glass it should be, the rest of the meal was underwhelming at best. The calamari starter was ridiculous in its stingyness. For $16 the ammount given was tiny. No one is expecting a trough but seriously the portion is tiny. Similarly the pasta entrees of which we ordered two were equally mean. Yes they make the pasta in house and yes it tastes ok, even if chronically under seasoned but if your expecting a rustic hearty plate of Italian noodles you will be sorely disappointed. Again at $23ish a plate its just not worth the scratch. Service is where things really nose dive, at best aloof and at worst just rude, there is no sense of warmth or of even them caring that your there. Certainly I can only speak to our server but again there was no sense of real hospitality when one thinks of Italian dining. Although not terrible its just another sad reminder of a Toronto restaurant missing the point of the food they represent. Italian food is simlicity, love and fulfillment and unfortunatley this place is none of that.

{"text":"I almost didn't go to this restaurant because of all the bad reviews but I am glad I did. We were served with 2 types of bread and a mixture of olive oil and balsamic vinegar. The bread was fresh and delish. The oil mixture was just ok.
We were served water right away and our glasses were refilled without asking.
For our mains we ordered pizza special of the day and seafood risotto. Both were delish. My one complaint would be that the risotto was an appetizer portion as others have posted on Yelp.
The service was friendly and the atmosphere delightful. Defiantly check it out even if for the pizza which is well priced."}
{"text":"The place was unexpectedly slammed which definitely had an effect on the decent but kind of absent/vacant service.

Excellent Italian food.  I worked in the restaurant business for decades and, while not a trained chef or a veritable supertaster, I maintain an analytical stance during every restaurant experience...  F'Amelia offers a tantalizing menu that utilizes an interesting variety of ingredients.  For instance, many of the offerings (including the special of the eve, a wild mushroom risotto) included rarely featured exotic fungi.  My entree, tagliatelli with a venison and hen-of-the-woods ragout, was excellent.  The fresh-made pasta was a fine ribbon of delectability which stood up to it's rather sparse but delicious savoury accompaniment (while my American palate might have preferred a meatier/mushroomier dish, I absolutely appreciated the faultless pasta as the star of the dish...).  

Some of the things I appreciated most were the supporting details of the meal.  The balsamic reduction on my arugula salad was divine as was the grated parm (which had an earthy romano or pecorrino flavour mixed in).  The bread was baked in house (in the same wood-fired ovens they use for their pizzas) served individually and consisted of a cube of a dense lemon scented concoction with an almost cakey crumb alongside a few squares of bubbly oven-seared flatbread and, of course, some lovely olive oil on the plate.

There were a number of exciting dessert options (including a bruleed lemon tart with rhubarb compote, fig and olive oil cake with caramel sauce, gelato+truffle selections etc.) but to test the mettle I had to order tiramisu (I know it's old hat but I love a good tiramisu) which was absolutely first class...

Then I picked up the bowl to scrape up the last bits of delicious dessert and inhaled the sharp nauseating tang of mouldy un-changed hobart water radiating off the plate.  FAIL.

The smell was so strong the friend seated next to me took note of it and it permeated my tastebuds.  Disgusting.

Many restaurants and bars neglect their dishwashing machines in the heat of service and it can really ruin a dining experience.

Even so, I would've given this place five stars if they'd had a conscientious dishwasher."}
{"text":"Couldn't have been happier with my experience at dinner last night.  The food was excellent!  I went with a group of 5 people and was able to try a ton of different menu items and they were all fantastic.  Try the pizza!  This is a great spot for a small group dinner party or for date night.  The lemon tart was an amazing way to finish the meal.  Plus they have Bastianach wine!  You sure can't find that at the LCBO... Can't wait for my next visit."}
{"text":"Their pizza is something else! I always rave about their tiramisu too. Can't say anything else about the menu, because that's all I've ever ordered, but for what I've tasted, it's very yummy!"}
{"text":"Cute and cozy restaurant off the beaten path (Parliament Street just south of Wellesley).  Friendly and welcoming staff each time I have gone.  Servers are attentive, knowledgeable and sometimes chatty, but not overbearing.  I sometimes do feel like family when coming here since it's so comforting being there with home cooked traditional Italian comfort food and I'm not even Italian.

On a recent visit, we sat on the patio which was called the Extended F'Amelia and what a lovely area.  It felt like we were in someone's cozy and relaxed backyard. It truly felt very zen. Plus great spot for people watching in the neighbourhood, almost felt like we were the neighbourhood watchkeepers.

Decent wine selection with varied prices and we managed to order a bottle that suited our budget.  The menu selection was varied and there's something for everyone with reasonable prices.  Everything was fresh and flavourful, plus plenty of free bread that kept on coming.  We had the flatbread and the rosemary bread which were so good that we just ate them as is.

The pasta was not quite as delicious as previous visits since it was a bit on the dry side, but I still managed to finish the dish since it was still tasty.

If you want a restaurant that isn't in the busy neighbourhood and on the quiet side, then F'Amelia is for you.  It was definitely worth a trip to Cabbagetown for this hidden neighbourhood gem."}
{"text":"Had a casual dinner last night with a friend and decided to stay on the east end. The service was excellent - very thoughtful and attentive, though the food sort of fell flat. I had the gnocchi with mushrooms dish - hold the pancetta. The gnocchi was pillowy and soft - the sauce was one dimensional. I started with a simple arugula salad which was dressed with too much balsamic vinegar. So much so, that it induced lots of coughing and watery eyes. (weird, and sort of me choking).

My friend had the beet risotto which she enjoyed thoroughly.

I had the house red and it was pretty great. 

To sum up, not my first choice for italian - but it might be the best option in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"#Summerlicious 2017 
A more accurate rating would be 3.5 stars...but it was last day of Summerlicious, I left on a full tummy, and I had a good time! So four it is;)
F'Amelia is a quiet neighbourhood establishment with beautiful outdoor patio, and I got a great spot by the window. However....I also had the misfortune of being paired with the worst server working that evening:( Other peole got asked if they want sparkling water or tap, I got tap straight; other people got asked if they wanted anything with the pizza, some pepper or mozarella cheese perhaps? I just got the pizza. It's these little things. All the other servers at the restaurant were extremely friendly, so I don't know what the deal was with this guy:/
Bread(4.8/5.0) - I usually don't judge bread, but this one was just sooooooo good!! I loved the texture, the dough was premixed with olive oil and spices, and I tasted lemon in there too. It didn't come with a spread, which surprised me a little; not warmed either, which is why I took .2 point off. 
Appetizer - asparagus with hard boiled egg (3.5/5.0) It was good, the combination of asparagus, brussel sprouts, egg & cheese was definitely interesting. I generally like asparagus, and this one didn't have any of the hard-chewy fibers, which was good. The dish was interesting, not amazing though.
Main - cacciatore pizza (2.0/5.0) I almost bolted out the door when I learned that they didn't have the parpadelle dish I came for:( Well, it was the last day, I was procrastinating a bit... And this pizza wasn't the high note I was hoping for. The dough was burnt, bitter, and too thin for my liking; the topping wasn't anything special either, the flavor of each ingredient didn't end up coming together. Although the taste was unique, it just wasn't for me:(
Dessert - tiramisu (4.0/5.0) The icing was rich, creamy, and not overly sweet. It also had the right amount of coffee in it. The cake was a bit on the dry side, but it paired great with the icing, so overall it was a solid dessert, I enjoyed it a lot;)
To conclude, the pizza was kinda disappointing, but I had a great time here. The weather was nice, the view was pleasant, the place just had excellent atmosphere and everyone was so warm and welcoming (except my server)... Might come again. 
(Not for pizza though:p)
(Hopefully a different server next time?)"}
{"text":"So-so. Meals were OK, dry martini wasn't, and somehow we were finished in 55 minutes with a cocktail, appetizer and main. Won't bother with a second visit."}
{"text":"Tucked away in a residential neighborhood in Cabbagetown, 
F'Amelia is a popular place for Northern Italian cuisine!

The garden patio is gorgeous and the space is charming.
They take reservations too and they can accommodate small groups.

I started by ordering a spicy bourbon and mango cocktail.
It had a small kick and it was absolutely delicious and refreshing!  
I dished out the mango bits with a fork and pretended like no one could see me.

The menu had lots of delicious pizzas but I decided to go with house-made pasta.
The braised rabbit pappardelle with black kale ($23) was fantastic. 
The rabbit was moist and tender and the pasta was chewy and perfectly cooked.  
The olive oil based sauce with mushrooms was not heavy at all.

The green risotto was very... green from being spinach-based.  
It was a bit light on the protein (speck, smoked prosciutto) but very flavorful, saucy, and rich!  

For dessert, the chocolate budino was chocolately goodness. 
I did wish that the hazelnut brittle was a bit bigger for such a large serving of mousse.
However, it was a larger serving than expected!

I had a lovely meal here and I will be back for more time on the patio and maybe some pizza.   :)"}
{"text":"We missed this place. Service is great. Food is equally as great. Great staff. Great atmosphere. Love it."}
{"text":"- nice patio
- chilled roasted zucchini soup was fantastic. like a gazpacho, but green and tasty. even has a light kick of spice at the end.
- braised rabbit pappardelle was great.
- will be back one day soon"}
{"text":"Delicious food and excellent service. Went here for date night and it was a wonderful evening. The wine was excellent, especially as the server recommended a Pinot Grigio to complement my squid ink linguini with mussels, clams, guanciale, chilli peppers, lemon & green onion. Would definitely come back every once and a while as a treat."}
{"text":"This was my first time at F'Amelia and I hope it won't be the last. My dining companion lives pretty much across the street and she loves it. Service was very nice and the owner came over to ask us how we were enjoying our meal.

I had the risotto special - corn, pork cheek, chantrelles and some kind of cheese (I forget which kind). It was delicious - the flavours meshed really well. The bread they bring to the table was really great too. We shared the arugula salad, which was okay, although I'm not a huge arugula fan. My friend had the rabbit pappardelle, which I tasted and it was really yummy too. We also shared the raspberry pannacotta, which was good.

I don't drink, so I can't comment on the wine. When I go back, I'd like to try the salumi/cheese plate.

They have a nice patio area out front. We went on a Wednesday and it was pretty busy. I'd say make a reservation if you're going to go, especially on the weekend. It felt like the entire neighbourhood showed up to eat.

2 people, 1 shared salad, 1 shared dessert, 1 glass of wine and 2 entrees = $85 before tax/tip."}
{"text":"It's rare for me not to be able to find any positive quality in a restaurant.  

Put simply, I don't get the hype.    

Although it's a nice space, I don't find the ambience all that pleasant.  Clientele is full of heiresses, Cabbagetown and Riverdale types who think that appropriate conversation in an Italian restaurant is describing a trip to Tuscany.

The salumi/cheese platter was simply disgusting.  I'm half Italian and grew up eating homemade cold cuts.  This was just whipped-up fat, in essence, and expensive.  Unimaginative cheeses in such small doses it was hardly worth to feature them.  An embarrassment and a rip-off.  

And the pizza?  Bland and boring, with a gummy crust.  

I don't find the staff here very knowledgeable either.    The server mispronounced absolutely every item and seemed too rushed to take the time to smile appropriately.   And while I'm happy that they try to have an interesting wine list, the explanation from the service came across as more pretentious than helpful.   

I won't be back."}
{"text":"It's rare that we go out of our way for date night- but we deserve it! So, we chose italian. And then we chose this restaurant. 
Too bad.
It was terrible.
Overpriced food and terrible service. Our server, Teressa had an attitude problem. She seemed angry/annoyed that we were there. She kept saying they were 'slammed', although we spotted at least 5 tables on the patio that were empty and half of the inside was empty too. Maybe they had been slammed- and it was calming down- but dinner still took over 2 hours to arrive. It took an hour for our starter which was very very disappointing to begin with. After finishing my first drink she didn't come back to offer another for 55 minutes. She mentioned that we should have water but forgot to bring us any. Start to finish- it was over 3 hours. This isn't because we are slow eaters and like to hang out and enjoy the atmosphere- it's because everything took so long. They had no bread- which totally makes sense for an italian restaurant- when we asked if we could have some she snarled 'i already told you we ran out but I'll check again I guess', 10 minutes later she threw a tin of weird chewy flat bread strips on our table and ran away before we could say thank you. *She actually had not mentioned this*.
Also- the pizza sucked. If you want a good pizza try cafe di portici at yonge and davenport, a million times better, and amazing staff. The lasagne was ok- but would have been better with bread considering the price. 
It actually pisses me off that we actually spent money here- get a grip people. Don't be so f'ing rude to genuinely nice people. 
I'm giving it a two because the nice guy who originally seated us (but was unfortunately serving inside) was so welcoming that I can't say everything was terrible."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Sat on the beautiful patio and had an amazing margarita pizza and a cold refreshing pinot grigio. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Having heard so much about this place, I went with several friend.  I was embarrassed because I found this place truly disappointing.  The ros√© I had was excellent, Bastianich Rosata, slightly bubbly, refreshing ans a little sweet.  The calamari appetizer was quite delicious.  Where the restaurant failed was in the primi, not a big selection.  I had the Norcina pizza with sausage, mushrooms and prosciutto.  This was a flavourless pizza given the ingredients. Also, the toppings were sparse; fill the pizza with the toppings.  However, one friend had the pizza with an over abundance of arugula and prosciutto. The others enjoyed their mean.  We all sampled each other's mean choices.  One friend had the beet risotto which I found too sweet, more like a dessert. Not sure if I would recommend this place to others and would not be my first choice.  The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable about the wines and food."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, consistently perfect. 

Food is a bit expensive, wine is not, and while there is no chicken, steak or fish on the menu - the pasta, pizza (best in the city) and appetizers all more than make up for it. Deserts are perfect, mixed drinks are great. 

This is a neighbourhood Resturant worth the visit from outside the neighbourhood but don't try too hard - we like keeping it all for our selves."}
{"text":"Overall, as an Italian who loves food, I was disappointed with this place, especially given all the hype around it. 

The food here really is mostly a miss. The starter platter of cheeses/meats was overpriced and left much to be desired. 2 of the 3 \"meats\" were just fat. Seriously. I know pancetta is basically fat, but there should be some semblance of red meat in there. And then along with the overly-fat pancetta was another bunch of sliced fat. It was literally just fat. The cheese selections were tasty, but hardly enough for the 4 people at our table to have a decent taste. For $28, this was a ripoff. 

The following dishes weren't much better. The $16 Calamari appetizer was made up mostly of arugula and potatoes, NOT calamari. The presentation was lovely, but there were maybe 5 or 6 small pieces of grilled calamari on the plate. Once again, I felt jipped.

Entrees: My friend and I shared the farfalle with lamb sausage and a pizza. The pizza was the best thing we ate. The pasta was another ripoff. We went for the smaller $17 pasta dish, and our waiter did warn us that it would be small. But for $17, I expected more than a handful of pasta. It really was pathetically small, not to mention seriously un-Italian!

The tiramisu was fine, but nothing to write home about. Again, for $9 a slice I was expecting more. It was flavourful, but you could tell they stretched the hell out of the recipe by using whipped cream instead of mascapone cheese. Sure, cream and coffee-soaked cookies taste good, but this is a far cry from the homemade tiramisus I've been accustomed to. 

Also, be aware that there are no meat entrees on the menu. No veal, no lamb, no chicken, nothing. You're limited to Pasta or Pizza for your main dish. 

Service was fine, although our waiter wasn't particularly warm or social.

Toronto Life rated this one of the best new restaurants in 2011. I beg to differ. There are so many great Italian restos in this city. Pass on this one."}
{"text":"I've walked by this place many times - it was finally time to try it.

Great little restaurant on a side street in Cabbagetown.  They have a cute little outdoor section, as well as the dining room inside.

Our experience was nothing less than great.  Service was wonderful and very attentive, not to mention helpful when we had questions.

I tried the lasagna, which I enjoyed very much.  My friend had their famous pappardelle - it contained some unique ingredients but was very tasty.

This place runs a little on the expensive side but is a tasty meal regardless.  Good for a nice night out."}
{"text":"I've been coming here over the last 3 years for valentine's day. Amazing food, excellent service, and a great atmosphere. No complaints"}
{"text":"Had a lovely meal. Cute little restaurant hidden in a well treed street. Great sangria, calamari app was perfect and my farfalle with arugula pesto and lamb sausage was perfectly cooked. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, wonderful food (though small serving for the price), amazing patio, really nice service.  Its on a small street so its quiet, surrounded by big, beautiful trees.  Try it out.  My friend had pizza, they were a nice large serving."}
{"text":"Super casual chill place to grab some pasta, pizza, pint, wine, cheese, chacuterie and dessert (in that order).

Those familiar with Splendido's menu may recognize some of the pastas here as a few chefs have taken refuge here since moving on from Harbord. The Rabbit tagliatelle is is divine as ever and their charcuterie is still top notch.  Pizzas as other reviewers have remarked holds its own compared to other hipster pizza joints around the city for a fraction of the price.

What you get here is a nice breezy space to unwind with some good food, reasonable prices without any of the pretention. 

Great little spot tucked away in a quiet residential knook in Cabbagetown with a patio to boot."}
{"text":"Nearly perfect. F'Amelia sits in the beautiful cabbage district inside what seems like an old home remodeled into a rustic yet beautiful restaurant. It's found the right balance between being elegant and ostentatious.

We tried two different dishes that were incredible: the gnocchi with brown butter and the rabbit.  The third, a pizza diavola, was good but not great. For an Italian restaurant that offers so many pizzas, I'd expect a higher quality. Still, I was really impressed with this place.  Probably my favorite restaurant in Toronto so far."}
{"text":"Had a date who was a big fan of Italian good.  Decided to try something close to home.  Made a reservation online and they called me to confirm.  Very pleasant and asked if we had any requests  or allergies.

Arrived at the restaurant and the hostess was kind enough to take our coats.  Started by ordering two Apple Cider Ryders, which were quite tasty.  We decided on pizza ordering the Pera Arrosto and Agnello Speziato.  Both were pretty good.

Will probably go back again in the future."}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant. Awesome service and food! Have had dinner here as well as a private party. Tanya and her team were superb and a pleasure to deal with. This is a great hidden Jen suitable for families, couples or singles. Everyone is welcome. Not pretentious. Just friendly and delicious. My new go to place!!! Thx Famelia!"}
{"text":"I has the opportunity to visit F'Amelia for the first time with some family and it was such a great experience! From the amazing food to the staff it was such a great experience! I went with Fungi pizza and all the elements were fresh and tasty! I live fairly close and cannot wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"I should have paid attention to all the negative reviews.

Chose F'Amelia for a post-successful PhD defence celebration for a friend with her family who had flown in from Montreal and Atlanta for the occasion. It was close to the previous venue and they were able to seat us the same night. I booked using Open Table on Yelp, which was very convenient. 

I had read the review in Toronto Life earlier this year and was intrigued. I perused the menu online before booking to make sure there were decent vegetarians options. With one pescatarian and two vegans in the party, the website promised a few solid choices.

The atmosphere was nice and warm. Simple decor and very much the feel of being in someone's house. Our server was on the cold side, but knowledgeable and accommodated our dietary requests where possible. He did strike me as a bit annoyed by the colourfulness of the questions from our mixed dining party, which left a bad taste in my mouth.

To our disappointment, they had just introduced a new winter menu but had not updated their website with it. The server informed us that there were fewer vegetarian options on this menu. Great, I love going to restaurants that have barely anything I can eat on the menu! 

Other than pizza, the choices were scant and dairy-heavy. Only 1 of 7 entree options was vegetarian. We were given the option to omit the meat from a few of them with nothing being offered as substitution, it just means more profit for them since you'll still *pay* for that meat. I really think this is a despicable practice. If you're not going to have any vegan-friendly options, you should at least be flexible with substitutions.

We went for the Autumn Salad, which was the only vegan item on the menu and the beet risotto sans cheese (no option to make it dairy-free) and the vegetarian pizza without the cheese. 

The salad was probably the highlight of the meal but at $16, it was minuscule and overpriced. Appetizer-sized mains started at $17 or $23 for a \"full\" plate. If you don't want to go home hungry, I suggest paying the extra $6 for the full plate, which still won't be full by most Italian restaurant standards. If you're going to break the bank, you might as well sate yourself.

Despite my request, the risotto was brought out with cheese and had to be re-made. It was okay, but for another $16, the portion was less than a cup. What's interesting is that the beet risotto was only a dollar less than the same sized rabbit and lamb dishes. Who is coming up with these prices? 

The pescatarian in the group ordered the gnocchi without the pancetta and asked that they substitute mushrooms to make up for this. The server did not inform her that the substitution of a less expensive vegetable for pancetta would cost her $3.

The pizza was completely unmemorable. Not comparable to Libretto and other Napoletana style offerings on the west side of town. The only positive was that it was a decent enough size to satisfy a single person.

When the bill came, we were shocked to see a $6 charge for the still water that I had assumed was tap water. It wasn't mineral water. It was just served in a decanter. I can't think of another restaurant in Toronto that charges for tap water. Insanity!

The bread, miraculously was not on the bill. It was two, slightly stale small slices doled out to each person and paired with a bland olive oil. It came a considerable amount of time after we had ordered. Enough time for me to forget I was at an Italian restaurant where bread and olive oil typically arrive around the time of ordering.

Summary: 

I don't like being nickelled and dimed to death, so if this is place qualifies as fine dining in Cabbagetown, then no thanks! Are Cabbagetowners so starved for choice, they're willing to pay exorbitantly to eat the tiny, tiny portions here? Italian cuisine is all about the food and there's nothing family-oriented or authentic about this place.

Something has to give, F'Amelia."}
{"text":"We ordered seafood risotto and the potato gnocci as well as the pizza with salami.
The food was pretty good- but not outstanding as I hoped being one of Toronto Life's Best New restaurant of 2012

I like more excitement in my dishes!

The decor is cute- kinda looks like a nice little French place...that serves Italian 

The servers were very nice!"}
{"text":"Such a cute place, very friendly staff and great food. Reasonable prices and a nice selection of wines. Will definitely be back!

Update: have been back once or twice since posting and still consistently great. I don't understand why this place is not more highly reviewed. It's a cute little oasis of Italian deliciousness in the city."}
{"text":"love love love their pizza!!  Buca and F'Amelia definitely have the best pizzas in the city.  I have been to other \"cool\" pizza places in the city and always thought they were totally overrated. The pizzas here are simple, wholesome and wonderful from the first bite to the last.  I also really enjoyed the rabbit tagliatelle. The chef actually uses the whole rabbit, so don't be surprised if you find a tiny liver or a small kidney in your ragu. I personally love it, but my friend who shared the food with me got a little freaked out by the tiny little kidneys."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in cabbage town. Also one of my favorite Italian spots in the city. They have \"wine Wednesdays\" which are 50% off bottles of wine that cost more than $100 (on Wednesdays obviously). All the pizzas that I have tried have been great. Some very nice pasta dishes as well. Service is always great. Last time I was here, I also tried their sangria which is delicious. Highly recommend this spot if you're in for some Italian!"}
{"text":"I'm going to go out on a limb and say this was the best tiramisu I've ever had. Portion sizes weren't large, but we knew what we were getting ourselves in to. The patio on a summers' night is cute as a button. The restaurant itself doesn't have much seating space inside, so I suspect it would be a little less enjoyable in the winter time. Excellent date night spot."}
{"text":"I am 9 years old and came with my family and grandparents and uncle.the waitress was not very nice.the restaurant was almost empty and it took forever to get food. Then they brought out the food for the grownups 20 minutes before the food for me and my brother.we were STARVING!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner last night at F'Amelia and was expecting great things. There has been considerable buzz surrounding the restaurant and I was looking forward to a good meal. Service was slow, our pizza came before our drinks and the pizza was cold. The pizza itself was reasonably good but no better than Terronis or Capocaccia or Pizzeria Libretto. The pasta was awful - I had the Tagliolini with mussels and clams and my girlfriend had the Tagliatelle with braised rabbit. Both dishes were dry and lacked in flavour - I can certainly make better at home. Dinner was around $115 for two with wine. Will I be going back? Absolutely not - there too many great Italian options in the city."}
{"text":"F'Amelia is a regular spot for my girlfriend and I and continues to be a favourite. From the pizzas to the fresh pasta, there is nothing on the menu that isn't worthy. The Rabbit pasta is a favourite and the spicy diavola pizza is a wood fired hit. The atmosphere in this restaurant is great for couples on a date or a family gathering. In either case, make sure to order a charcuterie/cheese board to share."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a few times now and I absolutely love it. The staff is charming and really seems to enjoy being there, which matches the very warm and comfortable atmosphere.

I most recently had the baked lasagna, which was the perfect thing for a cold night - and starting with the excellent mushroom soup also didn't hurt...! The profiteroles I had for dessert were no slouch, either.

I'm not an evocative describer of food, unfortunately, but I can tell you that I've never ate anything here that was short of amazing. Will go back again and again!"}
{"text":"The ambiance is probably one of my favourite qualities of this restaurant. It's small but big enough for a small grouping. I had the octopus linguine for dinner and it was ok. I may have had greater expectations for this dish than what was delivered. From a glance, about 80% of the customers ordered pizza. My friend had the pizza too and it was great! I would go back for a romantic pizza date."}
{"text":"What to say - I was excited to try this place...but left feeling very underwhelmed.  The space is unfinished and uninspired...Very noisy because of the tile floor and we were crammed in to a ridiculous table.  Service was spotty - you know you are desperate when you are shouting in to the open kitchen to ask the prep guy to flag down your waitress who you can see chatting away at the bar.  Nothing special about the cocktails, deserts looked like they had come from Presidents Choice frozen section and while everyone was fine with their food, not one of our group of 10 raved.  I won't go back, but hope they add a bit of oomph so that my friends in Cabbagetown have an alternative to HOP."}
{"text":"Get yo ass here for a pizza. It's the only thing I've eaten here but it is like eating the food that the gods refer to as 'The food of the gods'.

They have a Napoli style oven with ingredients flown in from the same so yes it is a traditional Naples pizza. The only downside to the restaurant is that the wine is fairly expensive (but delish). 

PLUS - If you notice the below review from Precilla C - Mel C has also eaten here. If its good enough for Scary Spice it's good enough for me."}
{"text":"I took my Mom here a few months ago, figuring that Italian food was a pretty safe bet for her tastes. 

We were both completely happy with our meal, from the entree to dessert. 

The only down note was that the table next to us was very chatty and they really monopolized the waiter; it felt like we were being ignored, and we certainly weren't getting the experience that they were. I've rarely felt that way at a restaurant, and it was disappointing. 

However, the food was so good, I'd go back in a heart beat. Too pricey for every day, but definitely worth it if you want an outstanding meal."}
{"text":"This place I found very hard to get a seat! I saw this place on some article claiming to be one of the best pizzas in Toronto. And since there are so many I had to try it out.

This was the second attempt to come here, the first we got here and it was closed.

How can I not get the Margherita pizza? Dough was light, tasted the basil, but I felt it just wasn't as good as Libretto.

Also had the 3 Funghi, I love mushrooms. Really enjoyed this one.

The location, space and characters of the place is great. It felt like some older open house or some local restaurant in a residential neighbourhood. I'd give them that cause it makes it feel a bit homier."}
{"text":"Visited F'Amelia last night for the first time. The reviews below basically say it all - very lovely atmosphere and wait staff (friendly and attentive), good food, somewhat expensive wine list. We had the roasted beet salad, pasta special (tagliatelle, venison bolognese, hen of the woods mushrooms), the venison and polenta off the regular menu, tiramisu, and fig & olive oil cake (total was about $150 with a cocktail, beer, and bottle of house red). The food was all good but I wouldn't say anything was outstanding. I think next time I'd definitely try the pizza."}
{"text":"Surprising.  Went for Winterlicious.  Carpaccio was great.  Cacciatore Pizza (they let you choose the type at Winterlicious which is nice) was excellent.  Dessert was good.  The person I dined with took completely different apps, pizza and desert, which I tasted, and they were all as good as mine.  I don't understand how this is only rated at 3.5 stars.  One of the best Italian in the city."}
{"text":"I came here for my parents anniversary.  I love the rustic decor, and would love to come back for patio season.  The atmosphere was very homey.

The service was fantastic, and the prices were pretty decent for a nicer restaurant.  

As far as the food went, I had the mushroom risotto special.  It was a bit salty and too creamy (not enough rice).  However, saltiness aside, it was really tasty and had a handful of mushrooms on top.  It was very rich and filling, so I ended up having leftovers for later.

There was a flat pita bread for the table.  It was delicious with hints of rosemary.  We loved it so much the server filled up the basket 4 times.

The soup was delicious and hearty.

My parents both had the lasagne.  I tried some and it was delicious and hearty as well.  It was quite a big portion, and I loved how it came in a cute single serve dish.

I didn't try the pizza, but did notice it was cooked in a brick oven, which is hard to mess up.  I will try that next time.  

The dessert was only mediocre.  I think I'd rather get an appetizer than a dessert next time.  

I will come back for sure."}
{"text":"I think I had really high expectations for F'amelia. Good friends of ours love it there. So I was quite surprised at the meal I had there. The food was flat on the palate, dessert overly sweet and the service was horrendous. I left a tip for the waiter ONLY bc I was there with my friends who are regulars there."}
{"text":"A hidden gem tucked inside an inner street of cabbagetown.

Creative name for a restaurant. Amelia is the street that they are on and it sounds like family in Italian.

Made reservations by emailing the restaurant.

A beautiful house with cute and creative decor.

Food was awesome.

Bread was fresh and soft. A

Seared octopus was not bad. It was served cold with salad but I would have preferred the octopus to be heated up. B

Fresh pasta is definitely the way to go here because it's made fresh daily. I got the braised rabbit pappardelle.  Rabbit is very soft and tender. Very flavourful. Not too salty. The pasta was very long and fat. It was a bit hard to eat, but delicious nonetheless. A+

Tagliatelle carbonara - delicious sauce. Very creamy. Pasta was mid size and very fresh. There was prosciutto in the pasta but a bit more of it would have added to the pasta. A

Tiramisu - ordered one to share.Didn't taste the rum and a bit too much coffee powder on top. Soft and creamy though. B+

Cappuccino - wasn't strong enough for me. B

The food was served pretty quickly. Our waiter was a bit pushy with what he wanted us to get, but understood when we selected things that he didn't recommend. 

This place reminded me of a cozier buca on king. Prices are mid range. Size of pasta was good. 

I enjoyed this place and would come back! Good Italian place!"}
{"text":"Salumi.  Go all the way and do the chefs five choices.  The flavour and texture combination are exceptional.  Good selection of wine.   Friendly staff and refined Italian food.   Oh yeah,   They malt their own baked goods and their herbed bread is so good I did not ask for butter nor olive oil to dip it in.   Warm and a bit upscale yet not unpretentious."}
{"text":"This place was really nice.  Lovely space, knowledgeable and friendly staff and a solid wine list.  Do yourself a favour and try the Ugozanier Primitivo.

The beef carpaccio was really delicious.  A classic that I had been craving for weeks and finally got to indulge in.

I had the goat cheese and potato tortelloni with roasted leeks and beets.  It was good... didn't knock my socks off though.  It was beautifully presented but to be honest I found myself looking for a salt shaker (not to be found) and it was small; only five tortellonis and I felt I had to eat really slowly so I wouldn't finish well before my dinner mate who got the Diavola pizza, which was amazing!  

For dessert we split the orange and gianduia semifreddo  and the br√ªl√©e lemon tart with rhubarb compote.  Both were really tasty.  My tea was from the \"Irresistible\" brand... a no name brand of tea seemed out of place.  I thought Mighty Leaf or some other brand would have been a better fit.  

Good place overall, although I would have liked a little more attention to some of the details.  I'll be getting pizza the next I go, and there will be a next time."}
{"text":"Me and my husband are freshly back from a three week honeymoon in Italy, where we ate like kings. Our dinner at F'Amelia was a lovely reminder of our travels and definitely held up against some of our the best meals of the trip. 

We headed over for dinner at 8:00pm on a Wednesday and there wasn't an empty table in the place. It still felt quiet and intimate, and service was very attentive and friendly.

We had cocktails to start: Aperol Spritz for me, a Dark and Stormy for him, and my Mom had Prosecco. Yes: my mom was with us so it wasn't a romantic dinner, but she picked up the tab. Moms are the best! Then we ordered a bottle of 2010 Chianti that was bright, fruity and food friendly.

Starters were a salad of Beets, Fingerling Potatoes & Arugula and Scallops with Mushrooms & Jerusalem Artichokes. The scallops were well cooked and nicely complimented by the sunchokes, but the salad was the real standout.

For mains, we had Pork and Cabbage Canneloni, Goat Cheese and Potato-stuffed Tortelloni with Beets and Leeks, and a Pizza Diavola with spicy Soppressata. Holy shit, everything was amazing! Especially the pizza: the dough is made in a traditional 72 hour process by their \"Italian Master\". Mastery indeed!

Dessert was a lemon tart: the custard was a bit on the runny side but I didn't give a crap because the lemon flavour was so intense and awesome. I had a glass of chamomile-infused grappa to finish off the meal that was a dessert unto itself.

I'd say this was the best meal I've had in Toronto in a long time, but I just went to that hipster taco place Grand Electric last week so it's a tough call. 

Long story short: A+++ would eat again."}
{"text":"This place is SO cute, reminded me of one of those homey movie scenes with the snow falling outside. The service is very quick and friendly. And the overall atmosphere is the perfect place for a date night or a simple girls night (I had the latter). 

We ordered a bottle of wine for $50 (Argentinian Malbec - very light for a Malbec), not too bad at all! As for the dishes we ordered:
- small charcuterie board 3/5
- the rabbit pasta 3.5/5
- spicy pizza 3.8/5
- sea bass special of the day 4/5
- tiramisu 4/5

The food didn't wow me but the cozy family vibe house like restaurant and cheap wine bottles will have me coming back again!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  I hosted a group of 6 (4 women and 2 men) for a special occasion during Summerlicious.  Four of us ordered the scallop starter which was a miniscule portion composed of 4 translucent slices on a white plate with red hot peppers.  3 of us ordered the crusted tuna main course, which again was very small, over-cooked, tough, cold and included bones.  And I love tuna.  The arugula salad was simple but fresh.  The asparagus starter was the winner as it was tasty and a reasonable serving size. The mushroom pizza and the lamb chops also received high marks.  Deserts were all good and the most generous part of the meal. No bread was offered.  The red sangria was fine but the white sangria was so over spiced it tasted like drinking a Christmas cake.

The patio was lovely.  Wait staff was good so were not penalized at tip time for a kitchen that vastly over-reached their abilities and/or budget.

Four of my guests, me included, left hungry and went home to eat something else! Sad."}
{"text":"f'amelia is a rare gem in the city. I recently discovered it and am so glad I did. Tanya introduced herself the moment we walked in and made us feel like f'ameli. will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Good food terrible service. Will gyp you with the tip and tax. Be forewarned before you venture to this sketchy part of the city!"}
{"text":"I really liked the d√©cor and staff but the food made it just short of being perfect.

Staff: We made a reservation and I had to change the number of guests a couple of times with no issues. Our server was great so no issues there. The food came in a timely manner.

Ambience: I loved the music playing in the background. It was dimly lit but not too dark. It was cozy but still had plenty of space. The place had like a modern European look. I can't really explain it and wish I had pictures to illustrate the point. Overall I was very comfortable.

Food: I had the soup of the day, which was a mushroom soup, and a Hawaiian pizza. The soup was nice and earthy but the texture of tiny mushroom chunks were a bit of a turn off for me. I ended up passing it off to someone else. The pizza was nice and thin but it was a bit soggy in the centre. For dessert I had the apple tart which was nice but it didn't taste freshly made.

Overall it was a pretty good experience but I was hoping for more from the food. I'd come back to try it again though."}
{"text":"Went there for winterlicious and ordered the soup, cauliflower risotto and tiramisu. The risotto was delicious and I wish they had it on the regular menu too. We didn't make a reservation but they were able to accommodate us between reservations which was awesome. Like the ambience and loved the service."}
{"text":"Came here in a group of 6 to celebrate a birthday. This is a very home-y and friendly neighbourhood joint with great Italian food. We were really happy with the dinner and the service was excellent. I called ahead and asked them to write \"Happy Birthday\" on the dessert plate. While they did not have anything to write with, they did light a little candle on the b-day girl's plate which was nice! 

The space feels like someone's home and it always smells amazing with the big pizza oven open to the dining area. They also have a wine bar next door and I'm sure the patio would be lovely in the summer (in -30 degree weather, not so much;)!). The decor consists of vintage Italian posters and jars of pickled veggies. They played a nice mix of music from Bob Dylan to Simon and Garfunkel. It's quiet enough to hear people from across the table and not have to shout! 

I recommend the salumi and cheese board for sharing. They have lots of interesting meats cured in-house and Italian cheeses. Highlights were the duck proscuitto and buffala mozzarella. Their bread is really tasty too! 

The mains are only pasta or pizzas, so this is not the place to come if anyone is gluten-free or on some unfortunate low-carb diet. It's also not the place if you prefer meat or seafood based mains. However, their pastas feature really interesting ingredients. I had the saffron gargati with lamb sausage which was creamy but not too heavy, and very flavourful. The pasta was perfectly al dente. I tried the gnocci too - really light and fluffy, not too dough-y like at some places. I also tried the pear, gorgonzola, proscuitto pizza. The pizza dough is not too thick and nice and soft, and the ingredients were all really fresh and tasty. One member of the group had the vegetarian pizza, which she complained was kind of bland, so I would avoid that one. Finally, the tiramisu is really rich and delicious. I always get tiramisu when I go to an Italian restaurant for the first time and F'Amelia's was up there with the best!! 

Portions were pretty filling and I think the prices are quite reasonable for what you are getting. The wine list has a lot of reds with prices ranging from ~$40-200 per bottle. 

This place is definitely worth a try if you are in Cabbagetown, and I can't wait to come back in the summer to sit on their patio:)"}
{"text":"Pizza was good but chef forgot to put salt in our pasta. Service was a bit below the average. We only got water once and has to ask for salt and pepper a few times before they take it for us."}
{"text":"Quaint restaurant. Food was decent. Service was not amazing, but decent. Probably wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Came here with two friends on a Friday to basically try anything pumpkin on their menu.

They offered us homemade bread with olive oil. I love bread and I think their homemade bread was delicious.

The pumpkin gnocchi with brown butter and sage topped with amaretti crumble was good. It was a bit too sweet for my liking but I thought that the gnocchi was cooked nicely. I also like the amaretti crumble but it made the gnocchi too sweet.

The crespelle stuffed with prosciutto, 1608 cheese and spinach was something I've never had before. This is Italian's version of crepe and I really enjoyed it. It just melts in your mouth and it's very rich. It seems like a small portion when you see it but it's actually very filling.

The Di Parma pizza which is stuffed crust with fresh ricotta, fior di latte, cherry tomatoes, arugula, extra virgin olive oil was also good. The dough was very thin which I like. I don't like buying pizza when I'm at a restaurant even if it's an Italian restaurant because I honestly love grocery store pizza. However,  I think their pizza is much better than other restaurants such as Briscola so I'll probably try their other pizza the next time I visit them.

We got two desserts for dinner - the brulee pumpkin tart with lavender chantilly cream and wood oven baked apple and cinnamon pizza with vanilla ice cream. I was excited to try the pumpkin tart when it arrived at our table since I could smell the pumpkin aroma. However, it was a disappointment because the crust was way too thick and there wasn't enough pumpkin filling. I knew I wasn't going to enjoy the apple pizza but I was interested in how it looks. As I anticipated I didn't enjoy the apple pizza but I loved the vanilla ice cream on top! Also, this is a huge dessert so it's something you would want to share between 4 people.

The service here was good, I love the atmosphere/decors and I will definitely come back here once they have a new menu up for next season.

Just a few tips: parking here is free and if you check into foursquare, you can get your second dessert for half price."}
{"text":"F'Amelia gets 3 stars mostly for the ambience which I liked. The food get a solid \"meh\" . I really wanted to like this place but sadly I will likely not go back. It will be F'orgetable for me.  

Located on a quiet side street (ie Amelia) in cabbage town, the resto is casual, open and sunny. It got a lot of hype from Toronto Life magazine but like others on yelp, I don't get it. 

$23 got me a \"large\" eggplant ravioli with artichokes and ricotta. Sounded amazing. It came fast, nicely plated in a simple dish. Too bad that's all it was...\"a simple dish\". No wow, not even a \"hmmm, interesting\". There were 5 moon shaped pieces which were smallish about the size of a slice of apple. Well cooked, al dente, but lacking. For $23 I expected more. 

We also ordered the 3 fungi pizza. Which was literally 3 smallish clumps of mushrooms. If I didn't know it, I would have thought I ordered a tomato and cheese pizza. Nice za overall, but in Toronto where options for thin crust, wood oven zas are growing, F'amelia has got to step it up. 

Service, I felt slightly ignored. Server smiled when signaled to come over but nothing special, and like another Yelper mentioned, no real personal touch. 

In summary, the only thing clever about this place is the name and the ambience/location. Sorry F'amelia, I really wanted to like you."}
{"text":"We went to F'Amelia to celebrate a friend's birthday. I was pleasantly surprised when the wait staff not only didn't give us any problems but actually actively sought out solutions to accommodate our group that was larger than any of their inside dining tables. When we asked if it would be okay to squeeze around a large round table they were totally fine with it.

We were served by two waitstaff. I didn't have any questions about the food but I did about the beer and wine. Unfortunately they only have three beers available. The waitress was high on one of them so I had it. It was okay but if you're only going to carry three beers I expect something with a little more character than an Italian version of Molson Canadian. Their wine list is a suitable size for the restaurant and I was pleased with their recommendations. Throughout the night I had a few questions and requests and the wait staff were happy to accommodate them. So service alone would get four stars from me.

My wife and I both ordered a pizza and it was less than exciting. Mine was a concoction that included ham and leafy greens. It looked slapped together and like the beer, was boring. 

I sampled some pasta from others at our table and the results were the same. Nothing tasted offensive but it was definitely something I figured could have come out of my own kitchen."}
{"text":"Food is good, ambiance is nice. Find it incredibly over-priced in comparison to very similar restaurants."}
{"text":"Wonderful service- delicious satisfying food - great wine - end with the truffles!  Don't miss this one!"}
{"text":"My parents and I came here for summerlicious and absolutely loved the entire experience. For starters, the restaurant is on a cute and quaint street in Cabbagetown, and is in a cute house that almost has a small Italian village feel to it. The atmosphere in the restaurant is great and all of the walls were opened up to extend to the patio since it was warm outside. The service was great as well - our waitress was friendly and gave great suggestions. The food itself was great. My summerlicious main dish was a bit small (I got the tuna), but my parents both got a pizza and couldn't even finish it for how big it was. Drinks and desserts were also great. I highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was nice but it was the worst risotto I've ever had. It was very wet and soupy."}
{"text":"One of the hidden gems in Toronto! Great patio, excellent servers and consistently great italian food, just like your Nonna used to make. Do fill up on the homemade foccacia no matter how good it tastes because you have to leave enough room for the lasagna. Best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Our dinner was acceptable, not exceptional. It may simply have been our menu selection. 
But what has been consistent is the attitude in the service. 
On both occasions we have come to this restaurant we have been treated with indifference. Despite intentional efforts to be friendly with the waitress (I believe this is my default attitude, but definitely the best attitude to find out what's great on the menu, and to be well cared for) there's really seems to be no interest on the staffs behalf to engage the patrons.  Unfortunately that colors the whole experience in an unfortunate manner. Since we never felt welcome, much less appreciated, we wont be back."}
{"text":"They have a great patio in the summer and a nice small menu. All of the food is super fresh and made with delicious ingredients. The pizza and pastas are fantastic. Not good for those with dietary restrictions however as they have been reluctant to accommodate in the past."}
{"text":"The food is so bad! I've been here twice and both times, I found it surprising the food could be so poorly prepared. I really wanted to like this cute place!

My friend paid $33 for the snapper, which wasn't hot when it arrived and had a distinct \"fishy\" smell. The pizza sauce tastes like it's from a can and again, not hot when it arrived. The lasagna had super mushy noodles. The wine pours are not generous by any stretch.

Beautiful patio but the food is just awful. And not cheap. Sorry but... skip this place. If you enjoy good food, this isn't the place. 

(Also, I asked for half my pizza to be wrapped up so I could take it home. The tinfoil job was so messy sauce was coming out when it came to the table. The server re-wrapped it, but it looks like it was slopped together. Very messy.)"}
{"text":"I came here with Mel C and another friend to try F'Amelia's pumpkin menu items (there was a pasta and a dessert). Honestly, I don't even think I love pumpkin that much, but Mel C has brainwashed me into thinking that I do. And of course, free parking around the neighbourhood is always a bonus! 

The decor was rustic and charming, reminicsent of a cozy traditional Italian kitchen. I would love to dine here during the day, when sunlight can flood into the room.

We started off with two kinds of bread, served with olive oil. We all particularly loved the flatbread, which was reminiscent of pizza dough. Lucky that the bread was not served individually and not by the basket. Otherwise I would've eaten a lot more of it. 

Now onto the food:

Pumpkin gnocchi with brown butter and sage, topped with amaretti crumble. The gnocchi had a really nice texture- soft and pillowy, just the way I like it. I could definitely taste the pumpkin, but I would've liked a little more of it. What I found strange was the sweetness of the dish. I expected a savoury pasta, but instead, the flavour combination was closer to the dessert end, particularly with the addition of amaretti crumble. However, the dish was undoubtedly unique, and I don't regret my choice.

Crespelle stuffed with prosciutto, 1608 cheese and spinach. This was my favourite of the night! The pasta was so soft that it seemingly fused with the cheese. The whole time, I felt like I was eating ham and spinach au gratin. The cheese was rich, creamy and absolutely delicious! The portion looks small, but the abundance of cheese made it very filling.  

We bullied our other friend James into ordering a pizza, and he went with our server's recommendation- Di Parma with fior di latte, tomato sauce, prosciutto di Parma D.O.P., and extra virgin olive oil. I had a small slice and enjoyed it. The crust was very thin, which I liked. 

Desserts...

Br√ªl√©e pumpkin tart with lavender chantilly cream. I found the lavendar bizarre and interesting, but luckily, it was quite subtle and not overwhelming. I wasn't overly impressed with the tart because the pastry was too thick and dry. With tarts, I really prefer the rustic ones that are more gooey and buttery.

F'Amelia offers a foursquare sign-in special in which you can get your second dessert 50% off. With that in mind, we coerced James into ordering a dessert as well (we're just wonderful friends!). He went with a more innovative dessert- wood oven baked apple and cinnamon pizza with vanilla ice cream. I love the concept of a dessert pizza, even though I didn't love the actual execution. There was just too much dough, and I'm not sure I want to be eating more carbs for dessert after indulging in a meal of bread, pasta and pizza. I also found it to be a little dry overall. Maybe adding more of that delicious vanilla ice cream would have helped. A word of warning: this dessert pizza is huge! I definitely recommend sharing this between at least 4 people if you don't want to be stuffed. 

Despite the slightly disappointing desserts, I quite enjoyed our meal as a whole at F'Amelia. The menu changes seasonally, so I would definitely come back and try other items in the future. All in all, it's a great place for a cozy, heartwarming meal."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the patio, which is on a residential street in Cabbagetown.   The atmosphere is relaxed and you are not rushed.  Mature trees and Victorian homes surround it and give it a strong connection to the adjecent neighborhood.  Inside is a fantastic bar that is warmed by a fire in the winter.

 I've had the octopus pasta which comes in a small or large portion.  The small was sufficient for me.  It was very flavorful unfortunately the octopus was small and not particularly generous.  I also tried one of their pizzas which is cooked in an Italian oven and quite good.  In all the rating is more for the atmosphere, which is fantastic, than the food, which is good."}
{"text":"A HUGE disappointment, given the buzz.

Nice atmosphere, and I can imagine it's even nicer opened to the patio in the summer. That gets the place up to two stars - because the food price/value ratio is a solid \"1\". 

The food isn't bad, but it isn't very good, either. Points for presentation and creativity, but nowhere near enough points to make up for their outrageous prices.

Toronto is full of great italian restaurants - and F'Amelia isn't one of them. It would be a nice $12 a plate neighborhood place, but two apps and four entrees with a couple of bottles of their cheaper wines cost $350. (Did I mention their ridiculous wine mark-ups?) I was ready to give them the benefit of the doubt, that perhaps we'd hit a bad night - but reading the reviews here, it seems they've been abusing the customers for over a year now. They've had more than enough time to try to bring their quality up to match their prices. They can't do it.

Service is spotty and brusque. Two stars fits it perfectly.

I might be up for pizza on their patio on a nice summer day - with a cold beer. That might be a three star experience. 

Not otherwise recommended."}
{"text":"This place has a really warm atmosphere and a lovely and knowledgeable staff.

I got the '4 seasons' pizza which is a great choice, because each of the 4 slices are different, and who doesn't love variety? 

The crust from their crazy certified pizza oven from Naples is divine... though I'm no expert on pizza, as I love ALL pizza, including the hut. Judge away. 

The wine list is pricey, but the food pricing is extremely reasonable. 

PS: Matt M - I loved your Mel C joke, unfortunately it fell flat as she is SPORTY spice. We should discuss further over pizza... at F'Amelia."}
{"text":"Been there a number of times and always happy with the meal.   We like to sit at the bar;  I'll do the app platter with a glass of wine and my husband loves the Diavolo pizza.    

Spent New Year's there and had an amazing meal; 1/2 dozen oysters which were excellent, moved on to the scallops with mushrooms and walnut and then the venison and roasted veg all of which was amazing (but a bit much so packed up the venison for the next day).

Overall, the atmosphere is casual with a good energy."}
{"text":"Great spot for brunch!  We split the French Toast and a BEO Panini, and both were excellent.  No brewed coffee here but the Americano's were quite nice.  They have some very interesting brunch menu options that will entice us to return."}
