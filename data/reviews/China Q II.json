{"text":"The quality of the ingredients here are a step above the other Chinese Restaurants in town, except e noodle . The quantity is generous, the prices a little higher, but, you get a better value here due to the quality of indredients and the portion size. I have eaten here ,probably around 40 times since they first opened. I have never had a bad meal here, but I never order the Japanese dishes,which seem to bring the largest number of complaints below. I feel certain, owing to the attentiveness of the staff, if I ever got anything that was not to my liking, they would make it over, if I asked. I think it is unreasonable to eat the food, then expect to get it for free, or at a discount if you dont send it back to the kitchen when you taste it when served. Eating your meal , or not calling back after delivery, is your communication that you were satisfied with it, here, or anywhere else. I think its kind of bad to only communicate a bad meal here without taking it up with the restaurant first, and before you eat all of it!  I have also been in the restaurant several times  when local business people have brought in Asian guests to be served special off menu meals,and they were all very complimentary of the food, I think that speaks volumes about the uniqueness of this place. I even asked to try some of the food they served these special guests,and they gave me a sample,and explained what to ask for.  My eggroll from last week was house made,with freshly prepared mustard."}
{"text":"This place used to be delicous chinese food with the best egg rolls in the south. I spent many a lunch here just for that reason and also because the owner has the best memory and knows what you order even though it may be three different things she knows all three. Problem started about nine months ago. I noticed the portions getting smaller and and the food not as good as it usually was prepared. I think they are trying to save some money. The trend just seems to keep sliding in the that direction. Yesterday was my last visit to the Q2 and I hate that. I really liked the place. This is the second time the food was so overcooked you could barely chew it. The chicken was so tough and string like you had to be careful not to choke. We left the entire plate and worst of all, they egg rolls are now on par with the rest of the fast food chinese joints across the south. BUMMA. When I complained to my waitress, owners daughter or niece, one of the two, she said, oh some people like it like that, I don't know how but they do. I reminder her that we are not one of those people, but ones who like to chew or General Tso and actually feel some texture to the chicken inside!! She look at us and said. \"sorry about that, 14.98\". Wow not even can I get you another one, take it off your bill, nothing except; \"Sorry, $14.98 please. We're officially done. I'll go up the street to the southern china where the owner is super nice, his wife is super nice, and he cooks himself and watches closely the two guys cooking next to him. Never had a bad meal there. Don't much care for plastic forks and tins but what the heck, the food is good. Do yourself a favor, skip the China Q II and head on over to the place that take pride in their cooking."}
{"text":"Easily one of the top Chinese places in Charlotte/Concord. I have read reviews of how the steak is chewy, well, would you rather have rock hard steak? The chicken is stringy, well, would you like to have chicken that taste like steak? Sushi don't taste like sushi? Well, what is it suppose to taste like? Steak? Here is my review, I think they use very top quality ingredients. Chicken has good texture and flavor. Steak is just how I like it, a little red in the center and chewy. The staff is amazing. Bing cares for her customers more than the restaurant. If you have a bad order, communicating with her will get you another order to your liking. And if you don't like that, then please go to your crappy Chinese joint elsewhere that'll serve you deer and not steak. I think the bad reviewees are just used to bad Chinese food and think that is good. When this Chinese joint is the most authentic. Go to any other place and you'll have mexicans cooking your food. Can't really say that is authentic."}
{"text":"We love China Q II. Bing remembers what my wife likes. We go back often. We like the atmosphere and the food is delicious. I order different things nearly every time I go. Everything I have ordered had been good."}
{"text":"Great place for awesome Chinese food. The staff is extremely nice. They even try to watch your money for you. I ordered a small fried rice for my wife along with her chicken lo mein. The lady behind the counter informed me that the small fried rice would be nearly as much as the lo mein therefore she just made the lo mein a combo order and added the rice at no extra charge!! Talk about great customer service. The food is well portioned and tasty too!! Definitely the place to get your Chinese food craving satisfied. If your in concord there's no better place for Chinese!!"}
{"text":"First of all...I will start off by saying that the original China Q (when it first opened on the corner of Concord  Pkwy and Hwy 601) was outstanding! Best Sesame chicken I have EVER tasted!  Great sushi also! They had high quality food back then and then they went to the buffet...needless to say they closed down.   Tonight was my first experience with China Q II and it was a horrible one! My husband came home with  chicken hibachi for me (which I usually love). It was just awful. The chicken had a chemical/metallic taste and weird texture. The shrimp sauce had very little, yet bad flavor and was very watery. The carrots  weren't even up to par. I will say the broccoli was good.     If I had been the one to order the food I would have brought it back. I tried to get my husband to at least call. Of course, I probably wouldn't have ordered hibachi from a Chinese restaurant in the first place. I definitely won't be returning."}
{"text":"I often stop for lunch and sometimes for dinner. The husband/wife team do a great job providing great service and wonderful food. Everything is prepared fresh, the egg rolls are made in house and are my favorites anywhere."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful.  The owner Bing is so sweet and so attentive.  The food is excellent.  We've been here several times and she always remembers our preferences.  This is by far my favorite Chinese restaurant in the area. You really do have to give this quiet little place a try."}
{"text":"I got takeout and from the young lady on the phone to the lady at the cash register everything went really smooth.  I got back to work and everything was prepared correctly and all the items I ordered were in the bag. Good sized portions and you could really tell the chef cared about the product he gave to the consumers. They have both Japanese and Chinese dishes on their menu so I got the hibachi chicken with mushrooms and rice. My friend got chicken tso (spelling?) With fried rice.  For both of us it was $21 and we got a two liter of Mountain Dew. I definitely will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"Just received a delivery from China Q ii...the food was horrible...taste, texture, quality. Yuck! I'm not one to complain and have never returned anything, but this was so bad I offered to take it back to the restaurant. We had 2 orders of hibachi chicken with broccoli, and an order of crab ragoons. $28 plus tip. I will never order from this restaurant again!"}
{"text":"Sushi wasn't even really sushi. Too much rice and barely anything in the middle. I got the food to go. I had ordered two sushi rolls and only got one and I had asked for ginger and eel sauce, I got neither. Everytime I've ever gotten sushi it's come with ginger on the side regardless if I ask for it or not. I just moved here from Florida and went here looking for a good sushi place near home.. This isn't good sushi. Maybe their other food is good, but this definitely isn't where I'd suggest getting sushi."}
{"text":"Be careful eating here, overcharged two visits out of three and sushi contents are not what is listed on the menu. I gave this place three chances and they failed all three."}
{"text":"Average all around, poor service, food was OK but not worth going back to the far side of town for. Although I cant say that I have had much success with Chinese food in Charlotte altogether either."}
{"text":"Overpriced, terrible service- everyone seemed displeased and we literally took one bite of our food and had to send it back because it tasted like toilet water. The worst Part is that tried to charge us! We will not be going back."}
{"text":"I've been going to China Q II for almost two years now, and it's consistently great.  It's better in the restaurant than when you get it delivered, but Bing is great, remembers my order, and offers great service.  Also, a lot of the fortune cookies have awful fortunes.  But if you complain, they'll often give you another fortune cookie for free."}
{"text":"Definitely the best egg drop soup since being back in Concord! Fast and friendly delivery and hot food! Should have asked for extra crackers for my soup though."}
{"text":"Horrible.  $46 for what the menu said was $39 and it was completely inedible.  The chicken and steak teriayki was that of a rubbery/chewy consistency and when I opened a piece of steak up it was dark red, shiny and slimy.  Gross.  The shrimp tempura roll tasted like fish (I know...it was shrimp, but it should not have an overwhelming fish flavor).  Never again."}
{"text":"One of the best Chinese spots in Concord. Service is always great, and the food is amazing. And they have a variety of tofu dishes as compared to other Chinese places, so I love that. Would definitely recommend, and I always keep coming back"}
{"text":"Restaurant is clean. Decor is ok. This restaurant does mostly take-out and has lots of specials for take-out. But the combos and specials for eating in are much higher for about the same food. The service is slow and not friendly. I have been twice and got poor and rude service both times. Don't bother going here if you want a good Chinese Restaurant. There are lots of great choices in Concord and all are better. I will not be back. Southern China Restaurant near Bi-Lo has better food for a better value and much better service. Also, I brought my concerns to Bing, the owner and she only said that they never get any complaints."}
{"text":"The app was total crap, oily, chewy calamari. The calamari was over cooked and dripping in oil. The little green pepper chopped up in it was really tasty. But with the jacuzzi dip this plate took, it fried all of its potential. The rainbow roll was fair as expected, cut way too big for a lady...unless your that kind of lady...go right ahead and try swallowing that one. The Singapore noodles house special was amazing. Little bits of shrimp, beef, crab meat and so yah yum! She said it comes spicy but I found it low on the index. Maybe they where playing it safe."}
