{"text":"I'm giving this restaurant 2 stars for the following...on a Friday evening the centropolis plaza and all the restaurants around were packed but bleue was empty. We decided to go in anyway just because we had some little ones with us. We ordered the degustation combo for 35,50$ each and then to our surprise we barely had any mezza and hardly any meat. I ordered extra garlic sauce which they charged us 1,50$ for a Tbl worth. We ordered a side of rice for 5$ which we got like a small bowl worth... The food was good but service and prices are not what I was looking for for the price we paid. Oh and we ordered a plate of tabbouleh and the cost was 15$ and you could only get a couple of spoons each divided by 3. I definitely would not go back there and no wonder why it was empty... I would advice the owners to change a few things otherwise it's lifespan would be short..."}
{"text":"Bon resto...pour ceux qui aiment la bouffe libanaise un peu plus raffiné que chez Amir..."}
{"text":"One of the worst restaurants i ever seen The worst service ever. We had waited more than two hours for our main dishes and never were served. We had to leave after waiting for almost 2.5 hours and nobody from the staff came out to apologize or giving any reason why the food was delayed. I never will go back to this place and will never recommend it to anybody including my enemy."}
{"text":"Très bon restaurant en plein coeur de Centropolis.   C'est parfait pour partager un repas à plusieurs. Tel un restaurant libanais, vous aurez droit à différentes purées que vous pourrez déguster avec un pita. Nous avions un plateau pour 2 et c'était suffisant pour 2, si ce n'était même pas trop. Donc, si vous avez une petite faim, prenez un plateau pour 2 à 3 personnes.  Du hummus, de la purée de piments et beaucoup d'autres classiques libanais.  Ensuite, nous avons eu droit à un \"plateau de la mer\" et un \"plateau de la terre\". Chacun des plateaux pourraient nourrir une armée complète. Des brochette de filet mignon, poulet, caille et légumes grillées. Pour le plateau de la mer, il y a du saumon, des écrevisses et de très bonne pétoncles il paraît.  Bref, en plein coeur du Centropolis et un bon pit stop après une journée complète à faire des activités là-bas."}
{"text":"As per most Centropolis establishments, Bleu is gorgeous. A ridiculously tall ceiling with huge picturesque chandeliers that adorns it will be the first thing you'll notice walking in... then the aesthetic of Bleu.... beautiful interior design with elegant tables and chairs that provide you with comfortable seating. I'd seriously recommend this place as an intimate go to place with a significant other or small gathering of close friends.   I would have liked to have seen it at night but my visit was for lunch midweek and it was dead quiet! During my lunch only 3 other tables were seated which brought their lunch rush ... to a total of 8 patrons. Not exactly killing it and hopefully not a preview of things to come with my meal.   Bleu serves modern Lebanese cuisine, I was excited to try this. Lebanese food is my second favorite type of cuisine and I'm easy to please.  The Shish Taouk plate appealed to me and I upgraded the side salad to a fattouch and Lebanese potatoes. The portion I received was reasonable and we ended up waiting about 10 minutes for our meals to come to us. Our waiter was friendly and on point but I can't state if the service would this ideal if there were far more patrons to be serviced.   I was very impressed with the quality of the food, the Shish Taouk was of high quality with the cuts of meat tender but at the same time the skin ends crunchy and flavorful. The fattouch was really good with just enough dressing to pull it off without killing it. The Lebanese potatoes were excellent.  My only qualm would be the pricing, which would perhaps explain the lack of patrons during the lunch I ate here. It is moderately more expensive than the competition would serve. While it may be true Amir, Basha or Boustan may not serve in such a gorgeous environment, the same plate I received would probably have cost me about $11-12 at most elsewhere. I ended up paying close to $20. Perhaps the extras to get a fattouch salad and a small garlic dip increased the price I'd however state that the fattouch salad shouldn't cost anything extra and the fact I can't have a large garlic dip (which was excellent BTW - size was too small for my meal) to accompany my meal very disappointing.  Simply put, to pay extra for garlic dip for Lebanese food would be about as fair as paying money to be provided with utensils to eat. There's no just cause for that and for that I'll subtract a star from the rating. I'm not a fan of the nickle and dime practice.  If they'd make their price-point a little more manageable, it would serve them well. These extra aren't desirable and it's obvious to see when their lunch rush don't even and up to 10 patrons in a place that can serve over a hundred.   The quality of food simply here doesn't meet the flow of patrons coming in. Especially when across the street you find Juliette & Chocolate with a line-up that extends to outside in the dead of winter for AT BEST, mediocre desserts."}
{"text":"Waked in and I was initially surprised at how empty this large restaurant is. I later counted a total of 5 tables (not including is) and one waiter for the entire restaurant.  We were served pitas to start and this was delivered in a bag that made it look like it was bought at a grocery store. The pitas weren't warmed and there was no dipping sauce so the dryness made them dry and hard to eat.  Additionally, the service was very slow and not attentive which was surprising because of the lack of guests they were serving.  The only saving grace to this restaurant was that the meal was delicious and well portioned.  I don't regret going there but I would likely not return."}
{"text":"This Lebanese restaurant offers a wide variety of mediterenean meals. Its always more interesting when you are a larger group since you can try a variety of appetizers and main courses. We were a small group and we tried the Fattouch and Tabboule salad both were very Fresh and tasty,  then a plate of Hommos and babaganoush (eggplant dip ). Then we swithed to warm appetizers,  some cheese rolls and kibbe balls(made with minced meat and burgh ol ). For the main course we took an assortment of grilled meats. Overall the food is good the portions are a bit small. The chicken terbielli was my favorite a bit different than the shish taouk you find in most lebanese restaurants."}
{"text":"I often go to Centrepolis, and have tried most of the restaurants there. I also notice Restaurant Bleu, but most of the time it's either empty or not much people there, which always made me hesitate in trying it out. Since I love Lebanese food I decided to give it a try. We went a Sunday evening and only a handful of customers were there. Here is what we had:  Lebanese salad:Amazing (cucumber, fresh tomatoes, parsley, mint)  Fattouche Salad: Very good, it was freshly made, the pita bread was still crunchy.   Chicken Taouk: The chicken was so tasty and juicy, came with side of tasty homemade Lebanese potatoes and frilled vegetables.  Lebanese Filet-mignon: The marinade was really fabulous, honestly I am originally from Iran and we are known for great kabab and grilled chucks of filet mignons, but this was out of this world.  All in all it was a great experience, the manager took the time to come and see us towards the end, which was really appreciated.  I give it a five star my only hope is that the quality for food and service stay the same when the restaurant gets busier.  UPDATE  I went back a month ago and it went from Hero to zero for me. The quality of food wasn't as good as the first time. The service was awful, it took over an hour to brink chicken shawarma plate. There were 3 tables in total so the chef couldn't have been overwhelmed. I was really disappointed and it turned out really expensive to the quality of food we got. Not going back!"}
{"text":"Food is good but service was bad. 1hour for appetizer and another for main dishes. I expected more outside the box food when it mentioned modern lebanese cuisine. Food was typical , good and tasty but not special for the price."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this experience. My hubby and I got the combo plate - the meat plate. It was divine. I asked the waitress to show me how it would have been eaten in Lebanon. She explained how the Lebanese eat, and it was fun to try it that way for a while. so, in combination with good food, the service was great and the staff was really friendly."}
