{"text":"Really bad management. We waited for 50mins to get overpriced soft served ice cream. Just don't go in and instead spend your money at sweet tooth rolled ice crean."}
{"text":"Such a great concept!! I've seen so many pictures of chimney cakes all over the internet, and have been longing to try one. I'm glad UTCA opened, it's a unique concept and a first for the city!

The interior is welcoming and beautifully decorated, and there's so many options of chimney cakes, ranging from breakfast cones with scrambled eggs, to ice cream! Will definetely return many times to try their interesting flavours!"}
{"text":"4 girls was carving for high tea, ordered twist IceCream with rainbow chimney cake, afocato( IceCream with espresso), coconut chimney cake, matcha latte and London fog. Lots of parking, good service, really loves the IceCream chimney cake and the coffee"}
{"text":"Many different combination of different chimney cakes you can create. They have both sweet and savoury choices. You can have them plain coated with cinnamon sugar, sprinkles, Coconut, almonds, caramelized sugar etc or have those toppings on the chimney cakes filled with vanilla, chocolate or twist ice cream. I filled mine with Nutella spread and twist ice cream. The ice cream was really yummy but eat it fast or else it will start to melt. Will have to try savoury one next time. If you request to have one made it will take about 8 mins to bake"}
{"text":"I was really excited to come here as I have had a  chimney cake at the Crossroads Farmers Mkt and it was unreal.. the location of this place makes it a bit difficult to park, (street or paid parking). 
The girl was friendly and greets you when you enter, there is limited seating but very cute cushions, tables and chairs (reminded me of Made by Marcus).
I ordered a cinnamon sugar cake but she gave me glazed, my friend ordered coconut rolled. We both got twisted ice cream (vanilla and chocolate mixed) and raspberry syrup/purée drizzled on top. They were $8each. You can have toppings added.. the toppings were appealing to the eye but didn't taste amazing with the ice cream or chimney cake..
I got Hershey cookies and cream hugs, caramel popcorn, white chocolate kit kat and a choc chip cookie.. the items didn't taste amazing. However, I went in with the expectation that the chimney cakes would be made fresh to order and warm like at the farmers market but these were all pre-made ahead of time. My
experience was indeed bias so if you haven't had a chimney cake this would be quite good.
However, warm would be amazing!! I get that the ice cream would melt. But I am a donut lover, so I would take the warm chimney cake over the ice cream combo any day!! Cute date place though."}
{"text":"30 mins for ice cream with no line up???? No thanks. Awful customer service dude. Stay far away."}
{"text":"I was out for coffee date with some girls thought we would try this place. 
Super cute on the inside I'm in love with all the colours they used.  Every one including myself seemed to enjoy the beverages but I found it took way too long to get my pastry I had finish my tea before it was even ready and I would have rather it be enjoyed them together. 
It was too cold for ice cream that day so I must go back and try it on a warmer day."}
{"text":"I finally got to try out Utca having had to miss out on the previous Yelp event. Utca reminds me of a laid back coffee shop, only specialized in chimney cakes. At first, I was a little put off by the location as it was out of the way and further from other popular establishments, but I can see it being ideal if you want to avoid loud popular places that often comes with the trouble of having to find an empty seat (y'all know what I'm talking about.. *cough-Analog-cough*). I dropped in on a Saturday afternoon and during my visitation, there were only 3 other groups that were also there. It was quiet but not eerily so.

I had actually gone out to venture for my first cup of joe for the day, but ended up at Utca. Luckily for me, Utca served Rosso coffee (Mmm!).  I ordered a cappuccino and an ice cream chimney cone (chocolate/vanilla twist, dulce de leche spread in the cone, with caramelized sugar), which was a perfect combination. Personally I found that the ice cream chimney cone would have been too big and heavy to finish myself, so I was glad I had someone to share it with. My recommendation is that you bring someone so you can share the treat. Plus, this place was so cute it would make for a great date night spot ;) And for those wishing to venture alone, I think Utca would be a great study spot since they do have great coffee and a good space for it too.

I would definitely return. Maybe next time I'll try their savoury items, since I was eyeing their cheese cone (that is if I don't get tempted by the ice cream again).."}
{"text":"Yummy way to enjoy ice cream! I appreciated how well the chimney cake held up- despite being stuffed with ice cream, the cake wasnt soggy once I got down to biting into it. The sprinkle chimney cake is a bit messy (sprinkles fell everywhere). Not much of an ice cream flavour selection (vanilla, chocolate, or a twist of the two) but really yummy soft-serve, nontheless. Staff are helpful and sweet. You get a lot of ice cream for $8, so come hungry!"}
{"text":"Kürt?skalács! In Calgary at last (well there is or was a place that specialized in chimney cakes at Crossroads Market but I'm not sure if it's still there- in any case, this is the first one that I could walk to). Superb quality (with soft serve from Fiasco- I didn't know this gelateria did soft serve but here they are) and an outstanding coffee program to boot, with coffees from Rosso. Branding is just adorable. Open 7 days!"}
{"text":"We have now gone here twice. Once the ice cream machine was broken, which was a bit of a bummer because they're fairly new, so I wasn't expecting anything to be breaking just yet. 
I've now tried the chimney cake with almonds on top and Nutella filling. They're a bit sparse on the filling and a bit over zealous with the toppings! It can be a bit hard to eat because things are falling off everywhere. My boyfriend got cinnamon sugar topping and Dulce de leche filling which was really good and not a lot of the common was falling off.

The second time I've gone I got the Dulce de leche filling and caramelized sugar topping. That was a bit better because not a lot of sugar can fall off.
My boyfriend got chocolate sprinkled topping and Nutella filling. Most of his sprinkles ended up on the table/in his lap/in front of me haha! The toppings really don't stay unless they're the small grain. 
I think I'd much rather a bit more of the fillings and less of the toppings so it's not as messy.
Other than that both times, everything was very yummy, and the service was quick."}
