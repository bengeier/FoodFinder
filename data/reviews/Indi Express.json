{"text":"I had the vindaloo chicken it was perfect. Level of spice and taste was spot on. The chicken biryanni was great too. Not to mention friendly staff and fast delivery"}
{"text":"Fantastic Indian food. Truly surprising choices and flavourful curries. Engaging staff and great service. 
You'll come back again and again.

UPDATE: OMG they deliver... I'm in trouble."}
{"text":"Good food. 
Quiet Friday nite + BYOW.
We skipped the apps and went straight to chicken byrani and vindaloo with some bhuna gosht 
All authentic and not too greasy. It was all cooked fresh. Would maybe do take away.- 
The banquette seats are kinda scary."}
{"text":"Great variety of mouthwatering indian dishes. They are vegetarian friendly. Not too spicy so its not so harsh on the stomach. The restaurant offers take out, delivery and sit down. Good value for your buck."}
{"text":"Doesn't get better than this. Perfect vindaloo and curries. Naan bread is top shelf. Don't hesitate to try the vegetarian menu (mixed vegetables or aloo gobhi). Both were absolutely delicious. This has to be the best Indian resto in this crappy town. You cant go wrong with this choice."}
