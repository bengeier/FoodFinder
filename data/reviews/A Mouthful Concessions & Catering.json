{"text":"Absolutely amazing. I had the healthy choice meal, all veggie and it was delicious. The owners are very friendly, and it is a welcoming environment. Will definitely continue to visit."}
{"text":"Food - (5/5) The wings are delicious! My go to is the lemon pepper. If you're a fan of wings, you should definitely try this spot.  Service - (4/5) It was fine. I wasn't really expecting top class but was treated cordially and told of the anticipated wait time for my food to get done.   Location - (2/5) It's attached to a gas station so I guess you can knock out an errand is your tank is running low. Fill up your tank then fill up on wings. There's nothing else really happening around there though.  Venue - (3/5) As mentioned above it's attached to a gas station so yeah. It's not a 5 star sit down restaurant so make sure you set your expectations. It's fine for the purpose though.    Value - (4.5/5) The wings are well priced and packs a great amount of flavor."}
{"text":"Food was delicious. Service was gracious and easygoing. Will be back soon.  I had the Texas burger, was terrific. Wife had very good shrimp po' boy. Not exactly New Orleans style - more like a buffalo shrimp sub. But was delicious. And fries were some of the best in town."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the exterior... Legit taste and value wait for you at Mouthful.  When you looking for it, know it shares a building with a gas station and it's easy to find.  This is a take-out joint, no eating in the restaurant.  Get The Wings.  They are great, and the cheapest wings in town.  My wife really enjoyed them.  You can get a small combo with two sides and a drink for cheap.  I got the A Mouthful Burger single patty.  Juicy, covered in goodies (chilli, slaw, mustard), and just a hair over 2 bucks.  Yup!   Last but not least, I got a Pork Chop Sandwich.  Comes with tomato, lettuce, and mayo on white bread with a fried pork chop. Mmmmm.    Great food, even better value!!!"}
{"text":"Big taste from a small place! A friend of a friend told me about this place. I decided to check it out. I drove passed it twice! But I am 'directionally challenged', so you probably won't have the same problem. I ordered the healthy meal, various wings and fries. The appearance of this place is not 'special' but the host/cook/owner was very nice and greeted each customer whilst she was 'throwing down' in the kitchen. The place is attached to a gas station . If you are looking for a place with ambience and a cozy feel... this is not it. However the food is awesome. The healthy meal consisted of chicken, broccoli, green peppers, spinach, cheese..served over yellow rice. Great combination of flavors! I rarely eat spinach but it blended very well in this dish. Kudos to the cook! The wings (honey mustard, lemon pepper, garlic Parmesan) were perfect! Seasoned just right, not salty and fried to perfection. I would recommend this place...."}
{"text":"I called at 2:48pm and it is now 3:36pm STILL have not got my food. All I had was 10wings and fries. And I'm waiting an HOUR! And they were NOT BUSY when I called so yeah NEVER AGAIN"}
{"text":"We just moved over to this side of town and I've been pressed about finding some good wings and this place definitely did not disappoint! It's a small little hole-in-the-wall type of business right next to a gas station so if you're driving by too fast you might actually miss it.   I got the house sauce and the garlic Parmesan. They were both delicious, but that house sauce??!   It was so good that I was originally gonna split it with my fianc√©, but I told him that he was gonna have to go back and get his own  These are the best wings in Charlotte ."}
