{"text":"Service is great and the tri tip nachos are  outstanding.  The old world ipa is pretty good too."}
{"text":"Relaxed environment, great local beers on tap, exceptional food, friendly staff and actively engaged ownership. This place is a welcome addition to the West Side and a refreshing change from the standard chains found in the area."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try based on the Yelp reviews. Walked in and didn't expect much. Restaurant is small, decor is simple. Service was friendly, everyone was pleasant and gracious. We ordered the mini chimichangas, fish tacos, carnitas tacos, wings and Pollo Fundido. Everything was great!  That Pollo Fundido was insanely good!  The tacos were a little pricey ($4) for the size. We're visiting from L.A.; those same tacos would normally go for about $1.50 - $2.50 back home. Would definitely go back regularly if I lived here."}
{"text":"So I'm giving three stars. I will say that the restaurant looks clean and the decor is nice. But the place was pretty dead the whole time we were there (8pm til probably 9:20ish)

As me and my group walked inside there was a group of servers hanging out by the bar and we were told to pick a table, which was fine with me. Our server was attentive and helpful with the menu items and beer options. 

The food was okay, not amazing. The portion for the fried Mac and cheese appetizer was reallllly small. 

There was a male worker (or maybe a friend of the employees) with a pony tail who was drinking by the bar and looked pretty drunk by the time we left. And there seemed to be some drama between the servers while we were there.. A couple of them were hanging out by the bar a lot and gossiping in front of us.

As we left, our server and another server were right outside the front doors smoking cigarets, which was kinda tacky. 

Not sure if I will return or not.. Was not impressed, and I am kind of disappointed."}
{"text":"I can't think of a reason in the world NOT to go here !!   food was great - server was genuinely responsive - cute place with a good vibe - excellent happy hour prices.   Check it out !"}
{"text":"Popped in after a movie at Harkins and the food was great. My girlfriend, who is VERY picky, absolutely raved about the margaritas. Friendly servers and relaxed atmosphere, as well."}
{"text":"Great food .good beer. awesome service.if your near by and crave some real Mexican cooking stop by here.we will definitely be back again"}
{"text":"A fabulous place to sit and relax.  We were originally looking to eating somewhere at West Gate but with the crowd we changed our mind and found Beach Club Cantina.   The food was AMAZING!  By far the best Chimis we have ever had and the salsa was delicious.   With the live music (we visited on a Saturday night) the wonderful staff (and very friendly and personable owner)  and the great fresh food,  you can't go wrong.   It is a must try.  Just look for it right next to the theater, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Stacey made that best margaritas I have ever had!  The pollo fundido was outstanding. We'll be back"}
{"text":"Three of us went here today after a movie, around 3 pm. The fish tacos are amazing along with the chips and salsa. The owner is friendly and great customer service is very important to him."}
{"text":"Awesome place to go and feel relaxed. We went on a Saturday night and there was awesome live music! I would highly recommend the tri-tip nachos!!! We have already been 3 times since it opened."}
{"text":"Okay. Went for round 2. Took 15 minutes for anyone to even acknowledge I was even there.  Even after I saw one of the owners sitting a few feet from me. Lesson learned will not be back for round 3."}
{"text":"The taco plate was sublime!  Great atmosphere, nice people .We will defiantly be going back for the tacos!! 
A must try if your near"}
{"text":"So, I live in the apartments right in the same complex as BCC. Now I know in the past  this same location has been the spot where many previous business's have tried to open up but have all failed due lack of appeal. So when I saw that BCC had recently opened up my girlfriend (whom also works in the complex and Bath and Body) decided to give it a shot. When we arrived we were greeted by Peter one of the owners  who was extremely polite and friendly. We ordered an appetizer of the BCC Load Fries (basically carne asda fries) one of my personal favorite dishes from any Mexican food joint, as well as the enchilada plate, and a carne asda burrito plate. The fries were AMAZING! I love carne asda fries but I really think BCC has the best ones in town. The burrito was also fantastic and I think what makes it so great is that there carne asda comes a little bit crispy like its suppose to, not all mushy and what not like what you would get at one of the many \"berto's\" restaurants around the Phoenix area. My girlfriend is also a big fan now of there red sauce on the enchiladas! Since our first visit we have been back about 4 times in the last 2 weeks. Plain and simple Beach Club Cantina is a must try if your in the area and I promise you wont be disappointed! 5/5 from me!


PS) Whats great about BCC also is that on Friday and Saturday their kitchen stays open until 2am! That means everyone coming from Toby's or Taps after a night of fun can still still drop by this place before last call. This in itself I think deserves a 5/5.

If your in the area or getting out of a movie check this place out it truly is DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"I have amended my review and added a star, I believe in being fair and honest in every situation. The manager did contact me the very night after reading my review. Although not my intention with the poor review, my money was refunded. The extra star is not for the refund but for the extremely fast response from the manager. So I retract my statement about them no caring they do. I wish them luck in the future and hopefully they can get the kinks worked out. 

We're always excited to see new, independently owned places on the West Side but once again we were disappointed. After seeing such rave reviews we were happy to find this place. After eating here I'm suspicious that the reviewers who gave this place 5 stars may have some affiliation with the owners or staff. When we walked in, there were a few occupied tables and everyone working there greeted us and one guy suggested we sit on the patio. We did and it was nice out there but then it took quite a long time for anyone to come out. When someone finally did he said he was going to get our drink order and then get us some menus. Weird order of events in my opinion. We had to wait until we got our drinks to even start deciding what we wanted to eat? The Hub's ordered an iced tea and I ordered a margarita with no salt. Our drinks and menus came out, mine with salt and when the Hub's asked for sweet n low the waitress said they didn't have any but offered sugar. Huh?! Ok, a little bizarre that they didn't have some sort of artificial sweetener but no big deal... until she returned with sugar on a paper plate. They apparently have iced tea but no sweeteners to offer with it. My margarita tasted like store bought mix and came out in a beer pint glass. Our food came out fast and it was ok until my husband got to the end of his French fries and there were curly black hairs in them. I have long blonde hair and my husband has auburn so they for sure weren't ours. I had to go in and give my credit card to the bartender to pay and when the waitress came back out with my receipt I showed her the hairs. She did offer to take the dish off of our ticket but I refused. He had eaten almost the whole thing so I didn't think that was fair. I heard her go in and summon the manager to show her the hairs but no one came back out to apologize so obviously they didn't care. I guess we'll continue to go to Phoenix or Scottsdale to get a decent meal. That's a shame."}
{"text":"I love mexican food, and after reading all of the great reviews about this place I have to say I was disappointed. Chips and salsa were mediocre, the signature margarita was so-so and overpriced, our food took FOREVER to come out, and the bill was higher than what it should have been. Probably won't be returning."}
{"text":"Man I LOVE this place! I really hope they do well! You will not find better Mexican food and a more laid back relaxed atmosphere!!! They only thing they need to do is put sand on the floor! Great beer and booze selections! I will be back again and again."}
{"text":"Good service~fun times, enjoyed drinks with a few friends here. Have heard that the food is good, but haven't tried it yet. Definitely will next time for sure!"}
{"text":"Our server Chris was awesome from the start!! Had the bcc carne asada fries and mini chimis they were amazing so good and the prices for those and 2 kids meals was so low!! Defiantly coming back."}
{"text":"Wasn't the best experience, I have been here a couple times it was really good! Today it wasn't the best. I love that they have Wyland posters! But the service took forever it took us probably about one hour and 45 minutes just for 3 things."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch with a friend and we ended staying for happy hour. We both had the taco lunch special, crispy chicken was fantastic. The owner was attentive and seemed genuinely concerned that everything was good. They were out of their own brewed beer the mex1, which was disappointing however plenty more to choose from. We definitely be back again."}
{"text":"What a disappointment! With a 4 star rating we thought this would be a good choice. 

Our waitress had no clue about how to do her job. She took glasses for refills and never brought them back. At one point she announced that half our food was ready and the other half would be ready in 30 seconds. She then proceeded to the bar, where my refill was waiting, and talked for 10 - 15 minutes. On her way to another table she realized our food was waiting. By the time the food made it to our table it was stone cold. A waiter for a different section stopped by our table to see how we were doing. I asked about the missing drink to which he replied \"so that's were that drink goes.\"

I can't give an honest review of the food. Most of us did not eat even 1/2 of our dinner. 

I will never return and I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"Great new place, had a large group of family in and it could not have been better.  Food was outstanding, really loved the tri tip nachos and the taco sampler platter.  Had a new beer I had heard about called Mex 1, it is a home town brewery and really was very good, would definitely recommend over corona.  Be on the look out for it!!  Service is excellent and friendly.  The owner Jeff even came by our table and made sure everything was perfect.  Next time you are close, it is a must try!!!"}
{"text":"We were looking for Mexican restaurants with good ratings to eat at on Cinco De Mayo. I called around to a few places to get a feel for which were food and/or drink specials. The one with the friendliest sounding person offering the best deals was a place right around the corner that I'd never heard of. We decided to give it a try.

Located in Park West, the restaurant is a little difficult to find. It's unmarked other than a small stand on the sidewalk out front. Apparently they've only been around since January and are awaiting approval on an actual sign. The inside of the restaurant is clean and they've started to attempt to give it a Mexican vibe, with a colorful array of chairs and palms painted walls. It certainly wasn't busy inside, but I think their current patrons go there for a more relaxed, less crowded bar. 

As for the food, I thought it was good. The chips and salsa were some of the best I've had. We ordered the Pollo Fundido, and I'd say it was better than average. The only bit of advice I may suggest is more sauce. Other than that, I was okay with the taste and the price.

The staff seem genuinely kind, and also very proud of their establishment. I think they still have a little ways to go atmosphere-wise (example: margaritas in margarita glasses), but I believe they'll get there."}
{"text":"The food was great. We had Asada fries and carnitas burrito. The guacamole was perfect just as I love it giving my fries a kick and making me not get my hands off the chips. I had the BCC Margarita it was highly delicious, I am a beer girl and also loved there were good beer options (mainly local, always a plus in my book). But better than the food and drinks? The service. The owner of the place made sure we felt welcome and continuously checked on us. I will definitely come back again when in town. And recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"I am giving a 4 for effort, friendliness, cleanliness and food deliciousness.
Who ever is working the kitchen knows what they are doing.
After watching every single episode of Bar Rescue, it's hard to be perfectly satisfied. Unless you hit key points.
1, customer service
2, cleanliness
3, well executed and consistent drinks
4, good food
5, staff knowledge
I felt that on my visit the staff's knowledge of pricing and what they served was not what it should have been. 
Also I noticed one of the servers using the center of the bar as a servers station instead of one of the ends. 
We ordered a pitcher of the cider. Though good, it was very potent. My friends and I were looking for a buzz. But you don't want to be known as the place to come to get a cheap drunk. That'll bring in low end and possibly dangerous clientele. 
Like I had said tough. Good food. Good service. Respectfully priced. You definitely get what you paid for. Possibly a little bit more."}
{"text":"Love my cantina!!! Great food...especially jalapeno cream cheese!! Special love to Stacy and kj..."}
{"text":"The two stars are for service.  I love Mexican food and looked at yelp for recommendation in the area.  The food was less than mediocre.the chips weren't good and the salsa was bland and watery.  Determined to give it a try, I ordered the mini changas.  Just barely okay.  I wanted fish tacos but wasn't going to subject myself to more bad food.  Would not recommend"}
{"text":"We have eaten here three times and each time it is great! The fish tacos are outstanding. My hubby hates fish but loves them. Margaritas are spot on too! Family friendly to the max during the daytime."}
{"text":"I love this place. The service is excellent and owner/manager, Peter, is great. Was here tonight and they had trivia night. Lots of fun. Plus they will change the channel on the TV to whatever game you want to watch. Happy hour goes until 730 and that is rare. The mni chimis are delicious and plenty for 2 people. The drinks are strong and the bartenders are great at trying new drinks. Its a nice place place to try if waiting for your movie to start. I will be back soon."}
{"text":"We ordered Mic Ultra, nice and cold! But the tri tip nachos were blah, no favor. I was disappointed, but I'll probably come again due to the quick service and beer on tap."}
{"text":"This is a very welcome and unique little place in Park West, just west of the Harkins Theater.  Beach Club Cantina is a refreshing change from BJs neverending wait, Taps inconsistency, Sandbars....disappearance, and everything that is Toby Keiths.  My husband and I have been here three times since it opened.   There is a small beer selection, *but* the local Old World brewery showcases its Mex1 lager and amber on tap, and both are delicious and reasonably priced.  The menu is small, but should be expanding within the week.  The food we had was delicous, flavorful, unique, and fresh!!  All the staff are friendly, and the owners, Pete and Jeff, are visible, and have recognized and welcomed us every  time we have been in.  Tonight there was an acoustic guitar player strumming classic rock covers.  Overall, this is a great place to grab a beer, have a nice meal, watch the game, and people-watch the theater patrons.  Anyone who visits Park West or wants a chill place to hang out after a Westgate function should check it out!!"}
{"text":"Pollo Fundito is great. Fish tacos, though small, are terrific. Salsa verde and chips are very good . Love the Old World beer. Hard to find next to Blu Burger Grill and Grimaldi Pizza"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful lunch today. I had the soup(Broccoli, my favorite) plus a mini 1topping deep dish pizza & Jerry had a hamburger with skinny fries. They were delicious! Great service. As a vet, Jerry's lunch was free. We will be back again soon."}
{"text":"I recently held a happy hour event for Realtors at Beach Club Cantina and it was a blast! I worked with Peter, the owner, for a few weeks leading up to the event to plan everything out and he was so gracious and helpful throughout the process, as tedious as it was and given the circumstances beyond either of our control. The Realtors and Lenders who showed up to the event were very impressed with the restaurant and the quality of the food and drinks. Everyone had a great time and the staff was very accommodating. We are looking forward to another great event here in the future!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and unbelievable service!! The restaurant was short staffed, but the owner stepped up and took care of our table (which was a table of 12)! Owner had us try some amazing treat! I'll definitely come back here next time we are in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly service, worth coming back to! Fast service and they kept a good eye on us! Great overall experience!"}
{"text":"I did go back to this place after my first review and again I had really good service! Like the first time. I liked the fact that someone was going around asking for suggestions on how to make the place better, shows that they care about their customers. It was just a first bad experience, I definitely want to try the rest of the menu! And my favorite beer Victoria on draft!"}
{"text":"A-OK

Stopped by the Northgate area for a Grimaldi's run.  However, they were closed due to servicing their oven and they recommended BCC as a substitute eatery.  

Nice little restaurant with a few flaws.  There was only one guy working the front on our visit, but he was pretty quick about things.  I haven't paid for nachos and salsa in a long time as you have to here. The three soft taco dish was good and our girls liked their take on cheese quesadillas.  I thought their wings were only okay-- nice acidity on the tongue, but little flavor.  

One star off for the apple juice we ordered and some of the clientèle.  On the AJ, the taste surprised our 6-year-old.  My wife and I tried a little and she thought he gave us apple soda by accident.  I thought it was just bad apple juice starting to turn to vinegar.  I asked if they sold apple soda, to which the answer was \"no\".  So, I gave the drink back and asked for a fresh juice.  He apologized and got it  On the clientèle, there was an individual making occasional loud racial epithets as the Ray Rice story was on the news.  He may have had too much to drink, but no excuses.  I should not have to explain away crude commentary to a child when out to eat.

Price is reasonable, good-looking patio area, and it's hard to hold the establishment fully responsible for the behavior of other patrons.  A little more polish, and BCC could be a go-to place for some folks.

On an aside, it's sad to see the Northgate area withering away.  Such a nice shopping area, but too many shops are closed/closing.  Just Harkins, Grimaldi's, and Blu are hopping.  I really hope the location doesn't fail."}
{"text":"My favorite place in the area for a happy hour drink.  Great Margaritas. An Best is the local beer on tap and local tequila on menu"}
{"text":"Came here before a game at the Cardinal's Stadium which allowed for a short 2 mile drive to the game from the restaurant.  The restaurant is moderate size with bar seating and we were able to grab a table for four without a problem.  The music, lighting, and TVs were all at the right level.

Having never been to the restaurant before we ordered a variety of items.  We tried the taco sampler plate, a chicken enchilada, and the house margaritas.  They also bring you house chips and salsa though I believe it is worth asking for their salsa verde and pico de gallo for $1 extra, their house salsa was way too thin for me.  The fish tacos were hands down the best item on their menu that we tried.  The fish was fried to crispy while still being moist and not greasy.  The creamy sauce and slaw complimented the fish well.  The rest of the tacos were okay but not as amazing.  The rice and beans side was small.  The house margaritas were weak but still refreshing.

I'd come back for the fish tacos and their fresh chips and salsa verde."}
{"text":"Great place! Food is excellent. Service was great as well. Pollo fundido was best we've ever had. Great place for happy hour too!"}
