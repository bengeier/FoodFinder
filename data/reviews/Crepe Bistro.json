{"text":"Tried this place for lunch, excellent food and quick service. \"The BLT\" crepe is great. Probably best for breakfast/lunch not really a place I would come for dinner but great addition to the food scene in Southeast Charlotte."}
{"text":"Yum!  Thought I could conquer sweet & savory.  I tried the Monte Cristo- perfect flavor mix of Dijon and preserves,  then on to the Nutella crepe - super chocolatee!   They are very generous with the toppings -  no way to conquer both,  but hoping they'll hold up for delish leftovers.  Cute spot to stop and eat with a nice looking wine assortment.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"We have been eagerly anticipating trying out Crepe Bistro.  We had our first experience at the restaurant tonight and were not disappointed. The restaurant is sort of hidden in a strip of businesses which include Jimmy John's and Five Guys on Monroe Road.  We had both the Monte Cristo and BLT crepes.  They were delicious.  The crepes were very light and the fillings were very tasty.  We can not wait to go back and try both their breakfast crepes and the dessert crepes.  They have acquired their alcohol license and will soon be able to serve wine with their crepes.  This is a wonderful restaurant and I hope it will be successful and be around for many years to come."}
{"text":"I have tried the Fiery Bird crepe and the Breakfast crepe here. They were both incredible. They do need to improve their time management, but I'm sure this will improve with experience. It took 20 minutes from the time I placed my order to receive my food on both occasions. Also, the drink I ordered on the first occasion was not what I ordered.  The second time I ordered an iced chai latte, and it was way too sweet to drink. If you are going for just the crepes, this is the place to be!! If you're expecting a great overall experience, give them a bit more time to perfect their role. They are surely making a great start for their new business!"}
{"text":"Best crepes in Charlotte - huge portions and fresh ingredients! And their coffee is delicious. Owner are super nice!"}
{"text":"I cannot express enough how amazing this place is. The portion size is enough for 2 people to share. Everything I have tried so far was so delicious I cannot wait to try everything else. For a sweet crepe I would recommend the ice cream crepe with all the toppings. For savory, the BLT or breakfast crepe. Also the coffee there is better than Starbucks, I'm very impressed."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this Creperie by mistake two weeks ago, it was serendipity. I ordered their tuna crepe and was in love. I loved it so much I went back the following week and ordered it two more times. This is my fourth visit in two weeks and decided to get something different. I ordered the fiery bird which is delicious as well. I haven't had their sweet crepes yet since I'm avoiding sugar, but I do have my eye on a strawberry shortcake crepe. The day I decide to cheat, that's the one I'll try. I'm sure it will be great just as the savory ones I've tried so far."}
{"text":"I got the Cordon Blue crepe and added spinach along with dark roast iced coffee with almond milk and it was delicious!! It's honestly the best crepe I've had. The portions are good too. They put a lot in the crepes so you get what you pay for. I'm so glad they are near my house, I'm definitely becoming a regular!"}
{"text":"Wow... what amazing FRESH food! I came here with my son and we got the Monte Cristo and Turkey Panini..SUPERB! And it was so much food! The owners were very humble and even introduced themselves. I'm very happy they are close to my home! New place for lunch!"}
