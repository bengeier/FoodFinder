{"text":"This is our favorite pizza place in Rocky River. Others that say it is pricey are just wrong. These pies rock. A lot of cheese, great crust and the toppings are great. Nothing beats a nice locally owned pizza pie. And this is Rocky River's hidden treasure. I love it. Never a bad experience."}
{"text":"Just a right!  I really like this restaurant. Not too this or that - just right.  This is a carry out or delivery only restaurant. The pizza is very good and traditional. I like it because the pizza is never salty or greasy. The marinara sauce is spot on traditional - not sour or overly runny.  Crust is not thick or thin, just right. They make a nice pizza pie - whatever your choices for toppings. I really love the eggplant Parmesan dinner. It is really a steal as it is perfect for two people. Dinner salad, garlic bread and two stacks of eggplant on spaghetti. I'm Italian and this dish is very much traditional and homemade. Good sauce. Great meal for two - $11.95."}
{"text":"This is our favorite pizza place on the west side.  We've been going here for almost 10 years and the prices are great and we've never had any issues."}
{"text":"Serves Georgio's Pizza priced like Angelo's Pizza. Coupons that offer items at the posted menu price."}
{"text":"We love Pelicano's! The pizza is always very good. Tasty sauce, perfect amount of cheese and not too greasy. We have ordered multiple times over the past year and it's always good. It's not over-priced compared to other local pizza shops in the area. Many places in the area charge almost $20 for a large pizza. Pelicanos pizza is about $15 for one large and you can get two large two topping pizzas for $25. The coupons are available on their website. It doesn't get easier than that."}
{"text":"Love this place!  I was surprised to see low ratings from other reviewers.  My husband and I have gotten the chicken parmesan pizza and buffalo chicken which were both delicious. My husband says their regular pizza is good too. We also got wings and the mushroom ravioli one night and it was pretty good. Their pasta sauce was very chunky so I wasn't the biggest fan but everything else was good. Very fresh salad and came with a huge order of cheesy garlic bread which was delicious!"}
{"text":"Pelicano's has been a \"go to\" for my family for years. Consistently great pizza at a great price and always friendly service."}
{"text":"I really really wanted to like this place since it seemed a step up from chain pizza places, yet had some better pricing than Angelo's or Danny Boy's. I placed a delivery order for the seafood pizza and mild wings. The delivery boy was very nice, but I was a bit taken aback when he pulled out a pizza box dripping with grease/oil. I had to go get paper towels for his hands... He immediately knew there was a problem and called his boss about it. Before he left I checked the wings and there was a black hair  on the food... needless to say my money was refunded.   I did try the food and the pizza was very salty and greasy even after I set it on paper towels to try and soak it up. I think they should do away with the oil pesto sauce and go with a creamy alfredo or something. The wings came on top of a bed of corn tortilla chips which was different, but since the hair was on the chips I just threw those all away and carefully inspected a wing before trying it. These were fine tasting.   I cannot say enough good things about the delivery boy who was very apologetic and got the issue taken care of right away and my money refunded. The food however... I am weary about ordering from there again."}
{"text":"Pizza is great but the quality of service has gone down hill in recent years.  In the past few months I have had numerous issues where the pizza wasn't cooked fully or to our order of well done and the staff could care less.  Last night we ordered our pizza well done and we were told it would be 20 minutes.  After 40 minutes it was done but not cooked completely so they put it back in for another five minutes and it was great.  Staff was not apologetic at all and didn't care, this would have not happened 3-4 years ago.  I hope the service improves because this pizza place is within walking distance of where we live."}
{"text":"Great pizza!  The Cheesy bread stix are even better. We catered my son's grad party with them. Everyone loved the food.  Broasted Chicken is a huge crowd pleaser.  Many specialty pizzas and the standard Italian menu fare for takeout.  Try them. You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"This is a nice little family owned Pizza joint in Rocky River.  They have been around for several years now, and I have always had a good experience.  Regular pizzas are pretty good, and their baked chicken wings are meaty and delicious.  The specialty pizza's are what set them part, not necessarily in the offerings (taco, seafood, barbecue chicken, etc.) but rather in their execution.  The menu item that keeps me coming back is the bacon cheeseburger pizza.  Pizza Crust, ketchup and mustard (instead of pizza sauce), WHOLE hamburger pattiies, and a thick layer of cheese and crumbled bacon on top.  Most rational people look at me in horror when I describe it to them, but it's not to be missed.  Think of it as a giant open-faced cheeseburger and enjoy!  By the way, it's carry-out or delivery only.  I find the Bacon Cheeseburger Pizza to be worth the 20 minute drive to pick it up."}
{"text":"I have gotten the coupon for this place mailed to my house for three years and have never been able to locate it while driving on Wooster rd. It is tucked away in a very nondescript plaza behind a tall building in a seldom traveled corner of Rocky River. That being said, i may also just be an idiot. But i finally found it and had to try the pie.   Pretty pricey for a take out only establishment. You're paying Angelo's prices, but not getting the hip dine in experience of an Angelo's. The pie is of Angelo's caliber, however. Very good crust, higher quality cheese, and not greasy. But a 2 topping medium ran me ten bones with the coupon! I had to pop a Target pizza in the oven just to have enough dinner for my wife and myself.  Well....i did order a shrimp dinner. Why would you order shrimp from a pizza place? It's not like it's coming in fresh from Euclid fish daily and is most likely from Cysco. Whatever, i had a craving. The shramps (pronounced shraaaaaamps) were quite jumbo and worth every penny. They came with slaw, cocktail sauce and the dreaded jo jo fries. I'm not a fan of the jo jo.  Overall, i liked the meal, however pricey. I just don't see who you would impress with your fancy pizza takeout. Unless you are a north Rocky River snob, then it makes perfect sense."}
{"text":"Pizza was just average. Crust was meh, couldn't really taste the sauce. Cheese and toppings were good, to be honest the pizza actually tasted better cold. Maybe it was a rough day but you really couldn't taste much flavor"}
