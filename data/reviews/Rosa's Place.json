{"text":"Went to dinner last night and tried to use my Groupon. The owner was rude and obnoxious said I couldn't expect to use a the Groupon for a Saturday and Sunday. I had made a reservation and he said I did not but I remembered the name of person I made the reservation with, he tried to lie and said we did not have a reservation. Terrible owner, we begged for a table, the experience was terrible. Even though the food was good would never go back or recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Food is great and I'm Italian so I am picky when I visit Italian restaurants. I remember it in North York and it was great there too. Rosa's Place has a nice atmosphere and the staff is super friendly. However, I did use a Groupon and they charged me for cofee/tea which is supposed to be included if you purchased the weekend option (which I did). If you have a Groupon I reccomend making sure that you book according to your option (b.c there are two options, the weekend one gets you coffee/tea, but minus one appetizer and minus one dessert...if you chose the during the week option then you get two appetizers, two mains and two desserts but no tea/coffee) and then reminding staff of the option that you chose b.c it could get confusing and I could see why. :)"}

{"text":"This was my 3rd visit to Rosa's, only because my parents like this place. To me it is crowded, with bland food, high prices. It is kind of nice there in Christmas time as the place is nicely decorated. Yet, it is not real Italian food so, unless you like older crowd and music from 50s, I'd suggest going elsewhere."}
{"text":"Food is pricy and quality is not that good. We found a groupon deal, we did not know there is a gratuity before the groupon price which ended up to be more than what we paid on Groupon. The service was really good"}
{"text":"Used a Groupon coupon; $70 for a well prepared, enormous meal.  The staff were polite and efficient. The food was \"traditional\" Italian: good mussels, decent calamari, tasty penne ala vodka, huge chicken scaloppini. Almost everyone there was asking for a doggy bag [which I personally find to be distasteful, so I passed].  The décor is dated, but cozy. All in all, a fine experience. I do wish they'd put pepper on the table instead of having to go through the \"look at the size of my pepper grinder\" routine, but I guess that's part of the 1970s shtick."}
{"text":"Used a Groupon but somehow total was close to a $100 ($50 Groupon + $40 for taxes, tip & one glass of house wine?!). Service was outstanding. We were the only ones in the place for most of the evening. Decor is lovely. Antipasto platter was good. Pasta was very good, but everything else was just ok. Veal with mushrooms, deep fried squid and creme brule were ..unimpressive. It was disappointing considering the price.. And that's with the Groupon."}
{"text":"As an Italian growing up on traditional and authentic Italian cuisine, I am often disappointed when I go to an \"Italian restaurant,\" but this was not the case at Rosa's Place! The food is incredibly authentic and has me returning several times per month. I have absolutely loved their lamb, veal, several types of fish, pastas and desserts! Their potato and sausage dish is one of my favourites, but I never hesitate to try something new off the menu.  The interior is elegant, from their general dining area to the private party room. The staff have always been friendly and helpful with meal choices, and I would definitely recommend it to both Italians, and those who simply love Italian food!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner tonight.  Nice place.  Terrific service.  Prices a bit high.  Food was excellent.  They have a decent kids menu and only 9.99 including a drink and bruschetta and choices of meat , pasta or pizza.  Mostly adults in the restaurant.  We were the only family.  Great place for a date night .  I would go back for sure."}
{"text":"Dated but good quality.  Get rid of the old house furniture already.  They need to accept this is not the old school place they had on Finch.  This is Woodbridge and the new location doesn't have the room and doesn't fit with the old crap."}
{"text":"The most amazing, delicious Italian restaurant I have ever been to. No other restaurant can compare. If you want delicious, authentic Italian, and a good value for your money, this is the place! I've been going to Rosa's Place for years and I highly recommend this place to everyone! It is my top restaurant of choice. The service is extremely friendly and you're treated like family. The decor is beautiful, romantic, and inviting whether it is date-night or you are there with friends. The food is OUTSTANDING! They serve the freshest, most delicious bruschetta, caesar salad and calamari for appetizers. Their Penne alla Vodka is SO good! Their steak and veal scallopini ...mm so tender and so good!! It is amazing how delicious this place is.  The portions are large too! My favourite drink which is also phenomenal there is the Singapore Sling!   Finish off your night with a latte and creme brule or Tartufo ! Muah! So good!"}
{"text":"I have been here for dinner twice and both times were just okay.  Service is good but can be slow at busy peaks and food is good - but not great.  Cozy atmosphere and good for a date."}
{"text":"Went with a groupon deal, service a little slow, food is very good, atmosphere and decor is excellent, there's live piano music which added to our enjoyment"}
{"text":"Oh this place is so great!!! A lovely place for a family dinner , date night or for any dinner! Friday's and Saturdays are busy due to the fact that they have a piano player performing. The pasta is made fresh, their appetizer caesar salad is huge and the staff are quite attentive. You will not blow the bank coming here but you will absolutely enjoy your meal. My entire table loved their meals, I will return!!!"}
{"text":"A quaint little place that makes you feel like you've travelled back in time. Old school interior, old school service, classic dishes..... it's an experience that you don't find often enough anymore. Great food too boot."}
{"text":"Wow where do I start. We picked up a $69 groupon for here that included a 5 course meal and coffee. We met rosa who was also eating at the restaurant. She is a sweet lady.

{"text":"Came here with groupon for the 5 course meal. Great portion and delicious overall. There was at least two dozen mussels in my friend's plate. I was jealous as I had ordered the cold cut as an appetizer. Our pasta was filling and yummy. He wasn't too crazy about the main course with veal but my salmon was good.   Service: I had tried to make reservation for a few weeks. First found out they don't open on Sundays. Then I had booked on a Thursday but they called me and cancelled as we were probably one of the only tables and it was a really rainy day so they canceled my booking and went home. I wasn't too pleased with it. But yesterday worked out OK. Their service was good while we were dining. The only thing I will warn you is that the original price of the 5-course meal is expensive and gratuity is being charged on that so after tips n tax. 2 ppl meal probably worked out to be $100. Still reasonable but Groupon just made it seem like a crazy deal when it's not."}
