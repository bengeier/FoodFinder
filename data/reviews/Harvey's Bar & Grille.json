{"text":"Ive been here a few times. The food is standard Hilton fare which is good. I really like the place but it is eerily quiet. All of the TVs are on mute and there is \"elevator\" music playing quietly in the background. It's a good place to have a drink before going out for dinner."}
{"text":"Bartender Mike is awesome! One of the best dirty martinis I've ever had. Service was quick, food was good and the drinks were on point. Will definitely come back next time we are in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Harvey's Bar & Grille is located inside the Hilton Garden Inn Cleveland Downtown. You can enter from the hotel or from the street.  It's a Sports Bar, there are 2-3 TV's as I recall. The problem with Harvey's is that there is only one person ever working in here at a time - one bartender - and as I observed on two different nights - the bar was way to busy for one person to handle drink orders, food orders, and keeping the place clean and organized.  Having said that - at least the two young ladies working the two different nights were pleasant and working hard. It just took too long for everything.  One plus here - they have two of Great Lakes Brewing Co.'s craft brews on tap - one of which is a fave of mine - their Burning River Pale Ale. Served in a frosty Pint glass - delicious! They also make a decent Bloody Mary - although mine was served to me with no celery - I asked for some and was told they had none.  You can also order food in here - I ordered the boneless Buffalo wings one evening - with a side of Buffalo sauce and a side of Blue Cheese. By the time they got to the bar from the kitchen - they were lukewarm. Again, a function of inadequate staffing.  Be warned, the kitchen closes at 10:00 pm, so you can't get anything to eat in the Bar after 10:00 pm, except for Popcorn.  Listen up Hilton - hire more staff. I should not have to request that the bartender clean my section of the bar just so I can sit down! My food should not be lukewarm by the time it arrives - and the place overall could be cleaner!"}
