{"text":"This place is always busy during the weekday at lunch time because it's conveniently located among many businesses.  Well, I came here for lunch on a weekend, and it was empty! That said, service was still surprisingly slow. Our waiter has this indifferent look on his face the whole time we ordered. I don't think he cares too much if we just walked out..   So I decided to order something different from pho, and was brave enough to order Peanut Butter Chicken Pad Thai. Yep, it was very odd tasting and didn't go well stir-fried with mango and pineapple chunks.. The noodles itself was dry and stuck together like dough.   I liked my friend's vermicelli noodle with BBQ pork much better, but you can't go wrong with plain noodles drizzled in sweet and sour sauce.   The restaurant was very dark - not sure why they didn't open the lights - so you may not be able to tell whether they're open or not. The washrooms are clean, so if you pass by, you know where to go for emergencies!"}
{"text":"Doesn't look like much from the outside but the Pho is pretty good.   We decided to give this place a try as it was the only noticeable pho restaurant in the immediate area.   We ordered the Pho Dac Biet and Pho Tai and Spring Rolls for appetizer and mango shake for finisher.  This is not the most authentic Vietnamese place, but not bad, pretty close.   The soup is delicious, spot on. Noodles were cooked perfectly al dente, but meat was too little. Came with the standard bean sprouts, Thai basil, and lime wedges.  The spring rolls were delicious, but perhaps a bit on the small side. Fish sauce is a little different than what I'm used to, can't describe it, but was still tastey, just slightly different.   Mango shake was very good. Well done.  Price is decent, I will definitely return to try out their other dishes like rice and vermicelli. The waiter was pretty cool and laid back, he remembers your orders, this place does not use the typical \"write down your order\" system. Washrooms were very clean, both male and female!  They also have Thai dishes on the menu but I don't care for Thai cuisine."}
{"text":"Went to try it out at the recommendation of a friend. I usually go to Pho 99 for my Pho but this place was really good. I liked that they also have a great variety of Thai food.  The prices are decent and the food is good.  On busy days, its a bit slow, and thats why they get 3 stars."}
{"text":"Interesting that this place is classified as Cambodian.  I ordered pho.  The decor was neat and clean.  Ad service was quick.  The exterior leaves a bit to be desired, but it does seem frequented by many regulars.  The servers remember their orders. ( that's a lot of lunch time pho).  I don't think it's the tastiest pho I've ever had, but it's nice to have something with  on a cold rainy day!"}
{"text":"Pho's flavor is alittle on the weak side, it loses to the Papaya salad.  Same can be said about the squid. Please do not take my comments wrong the food was good, just that I think it can be better."}
{"text":"Had lunch with family. Service is ok but the server or kitchen messed up three orders out of the six. The chicken in one of the dishes was dry and over cooked. My vermicelli with beef was a bit on the salty side."}
{"text":"From the looks of the place didn't really expect much but the pho was really good! Chicken in pho could have been a bit better but broth was yummy! I had the spicy chicken pho. Waiter was nice guy."}
{"text":"After a VERY long time I found an awesome Vietnamese place. I LOVED my order. I ordered item # 30 and my parter in crime ordered item 42. Both dishes were delicious. We would lick the bowl if could . On a serious note - this place is gem hidden in Woodbridge. I would travel to get here, I liked it that much! Now that I found this place I hope they stay!!! I recommend this place and I will definitely come back!"}
