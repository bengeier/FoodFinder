{"text":"In town on business, great service and the best indian food i have ever tasted. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We've really enjoyed the lunch buffet a couple of times now. Food is hot and delicious. Staff is very attentive."}
{"text":"The food is so very good.  I went there twice this week and will be back soon!  Indian restaurants are hard to find nearby, and this is a gem. So glad to find a great Indian restaurant close to home. The Chicken Makani and Chicken Biriani are both awesome choices."}
{"text":"I discovered this restaurant purely by accident this week, just a week after they opened, and my family and I ate there last night, Let me tell you, we are THRILLED to have found such a treasure so close to home. The service was friendly, always on hand to refill water and/or popadum, and they seemed genuinely pleased we were there. 

Their menu is varied, with many vegetarian options and several items we'd never seen or heard of. We thoroughly enjoyed our meal and look forward to trying out some more new-to-us dishes next time. And I can't believe I'm raving about naan bread, but theirs was amazing -- fluffy and fresh -- much better than other area Indian restaurants. 

Crown doesn't have a liquor license but we were told we could bring our own. We'll do so next visit, which I'm sure will be soon.

Stop in and give them a try, and be sure to order some naan."}
{"text":"I've been to all the Indian restaurants in the area multiple times and have been looking forward to going to this place since it opened.  
I got the Saturday lunch buffet and its pretty standard as far as Indian Buffets go (weekday).  The food was flavorful, but not spicy at all.  I was disappointed in the selection because usually on weekends most buffets have a larger spread and some even have dosa bars and street food; this reminded me of a mid week variety.  The chana masala was very good however.
I asked for a Diet Coke; as I was up at the buffet getting my food they brought a can of Diet Pepsi to the table that was frozen and pretty much not drinkable.  Cost $1.95.  They should have told me it was canned because I would never agree to pay $1.95 for a can of pop at a sit down restaurant, frozen or not.  I guess I've become accustomed to fountain sodas with free refills at the $1.95 price point.
If they add a little heat, widen the weekend selections, and get a fountain dispenser, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Was out today and the food was amazing!!! Very good and authentic and fresh, the best I've had. Clean friendly atmosphere Definitely recommend trying it out. Thx again for the great service and great food. Matt"}
{"text":"After proving themselves truly exemplary to me, I gave this jewel of Cleveland a full 5 stars. I have dined at the lunch buffet at least 10 times now. This fabulous restaurant has consistent top quality Indian food, with an emphasis on spice, variety, gracious prompt service, respectful staff, and clientele. You can tell that the owners, manager, and staff care immensely about the customer and their restaurant. This is always my first pick for Indian. The Crown is King!"}
{"text":"Thanks to YELP! I have found another place to add to our rotation. I did not know what to expect since I have only had Indian twice. It was very good. The staff was super friendly and helpful. I had the Chicken Tikka Masala and it was terrific. I also had a side salad (which was big enough for two) and an order of NAAN. The NAAN was hot and fresh, but I thought that it would be sweeter.
I would highly suggest this place -"}
{"text":"One of the best Indian restaurants in Cleveland and easily the best in Strongsville area. Food is delicious and less oily. Exceptional customer service. I have tried their catering service too. Very pleased with dining in, take out and catering experiences."}
{"text":"Such delicious Indian food, right in Strongsville! Love their lunch buffet and have been there for dinner and enjoyed takeout too. Cute place and best Indian food I've had on the west side!"}
{"text":"Some friends and I got takeout tonight and we were all very happy!  Every dish was delicious.  This will be my new go to Indian restaurant (despite being a half an hour away)!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and attentive service.  The lamb korma, garlic naan and veggie pakora were all very good.  Also tried the kheer and had a mango lassi - all were superb."}
{"text":"They served old food (non-veg) in buffet, very bad experience. Neither me nor my friends couldnt have second bite (non veg), it was that evident."}
{"text":"Giving them one star for every time my wife had to tell me to stop moaning while I dove into my lamb meatballs. My wife had some chicken tomatoey thing that was amazing, and my son went for his usual chicken tikka massalla. Everything was done to perfection, and perfectly spiced. We all got 4-star heat level, which was in line with other restaurants. We also got garlic naan, lamb naan, and paneer pakora - so good. We got fat for sure. Walked out for a little over $50 plus tip. Service was top top notch, very friendly staff. Atmosphere is very clean. Among some of the best Indian restaurants I've tried in much larger coastal cities."}
{"text":"Very good Indian on our way thru Ohio/Cleveland.  Had the buffet and it hit the spot for the family.  Mango lassi was referring.  

Good mix of fried and curry dishes.  Prices were very reasonable."}
{"text":"What a find!  Never had Indian food before, but I will again and again. 

Came in on a Saturday evening at 6:00. Had to get to a show at Playhouse Square by 7:30 and was concerned about having enough time for dinner so we gave this place a shot. 

There were only 2 other tables with customers when we walked in, and about a half dozen wait staff to help, so they were very attentive. They first brought some thin bread, almost like tortilla chips, with 3 dipping sauces. I have no idea what was in them but they were very good. One was chopped tomatoes with some spice, one was like a tomatillo sauce, and the third was like a plumb sauce. 

For dinner we had Chicken Mango and Chicken Tikka Masala. I asked for the Tikka spicy and boy was it!  Outstanding flavor as was the Mango. They also brought some fancy named bread that was like a giant grilled pita. It was delicious. 

I saw a couple other tables getting appetizers that looked like huge crab rangoons. Gotta try that next time. Got in and out in less than 30 minutes."}
{"text":"Excellent lunch buffet full of Indian favorites.  From soups, side dishes, rice, main dishes, tandoori chicken, masala's, rice pudding and a variety of fruits this place really hit the spot.

Everything appeared hot and fresh and the price was reasonable for what you get.  I will most certainly be back as this is a great (local) option for us in Strongsville."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. Good prices. Definitely worth it and will be coming back! The garlic naan was great. I ordered the lamb masala and I was not disappointed at all!"}
{"text":"There's only a handful of truly amazing, authentic Indian restaurants in Cleveland. This place is one of them. The restaurant is tiny and it's decor is minimal. But the food makes up for what it lacks in ambiance. I give it five stars because the food is great and the price is affordable."}
{"text":"Went here for the lunch buffet which was quite good, they had plenty of vegetarian options available.   The place was busy which is always a good sign and the person who took care of us was very friendly and stayed on top of water refills and dirty dishes as we finished plates and went up for a new one.

The restaurant was pretty clean, and I saw a man with two very small children and the person serving them said don't worry about the kids (they probably didn't eat very much but it was still nice of them to do) and just charged him for 1 adult buffet.   I don't know if he is a regular or not but I thought that was awesome of them.

Not much else to say other than if you want some really tasty Indian food, at a relatively cheap price, with decent service, I would certainly give this place a try.   I will be back to Crown of India when I am in the area for certain, both the wife and I are fans, give them a try!"}
{"text":"This place was fantastic, I have been dedicating the last few months on Saturday attempting to find the best Indian cuisine in the Northeast Ohio region. Crown of India is definitely in the running for the title. I was very pleased with the staff and selections. They had a wide variety of foods and only one of the buffet items contained nuts and the spice level was low but still if you are sensitive to spicy food, you may need another Kleenex. They had a Briyani (veg), Lamb & Mushroom curry, Chicken Tikka Marsala, Chicken Tandoori, Gulab jamun, rice pudding, and more. I was certainly very pleased. The price I think is 10.75 for the lunch buffet and if you are meeting other people, mind you there is a lot of construction going on around Royalton and Pearl so spare some time. The other guests around us seemed to be very pleased. Overall you must try, I was there two days ago and now as I sit at work I am thinking about just getting up and going on shoving work."}
{"text":"Really bad experience. We have checked out many indian eateries but none so bad. The chat was cold, had frozen contents. The biryani was more of a chilli chicken/spicy chicken fried rice version. The worst bit was the rasmalai. 2 pieces of hard dough non soaked, in a bath of half n half or heavy whipping cream. Sprinkled with chopped almonds. No connection between the elements, tasteless."}
{"text":"Love their lunch buffet.  I've been here about 10 times and have always tried something new from the buffet.  Their food has a little more heat to it than some of the other Indian places I've been to but I keep going back."}
{"text":"This place is the best place ever! Like if you want to even try Indian food for the first time this is a must go! Very authentic and very delicious! I can't wait to come back here!! The mango juice is amazing!!! And my chicken tikka masala was heavenly!!!!! They were very clean, and very professional. Also super fast!"}
{"text":"Great food & service. Food was fresh, tasty and good size portions. Being of Indian heritage- this was definitely authentic. Tried the chicken tikka masala, dal makhani, and onion kulcha. All were delicious. Definitely going back to try more!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Indian place. The owner is super nice and they have this amazing dish called diwani handi and we added paneer. The best yellow dal soup we have had. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Try the garlic naan! By far the best \"garlic bread\" I've ever had. Food is surprisingly good for being in a plaza restaurant."}
{"text":"i thought Crown of India was pretty good. For folks afraid of hot Indian food, i think CoI is a safer bet. nothing i had there was spicy, but all was flavorful. We even got some to go to take to Danielle's dad to try. he liked it too."}
{"text":"Nice ambience and excellent service. We were late and went for the first time but they treated us like their dearest customer. 
Malai Chicken Kabab was delicious and garlic naan had nice aroma and amazing taste. Chicken Jalfrazi was ok. The complimentary rice they gave was like Pulav and it was mouth watering. Overall a nice experience and we will keep visiting this place."}
{"text":"Amazing food! My first time eating authentic Indian food. This place is the real deal! I loved it! So delicious! The menu has so much to choose from it takes a while to decide what to get...everything sounds good from the descriptions! I ordered the lamb biryani it was incredible! The lamb was so tender it melted in my mouth! The level of \"heat\" was perfect for me, I chose medium and it wasn't too spicy, it had just enough kick to it! The Basmati rice was cooked to perfection! The Naan (Indian bread)was so good I devoured it, which was not hard to do! Portions are HUGE, there is enough for two meals. No problem, you'll enjoy it again the next day! The service was excellent, the waiter was attentive to all our needs. He was very polite and professional. He allowed us to take our time and enjoy the meal. The restaurant dining room is very simple, not fancy. It is very clean. The atmosphere is quiet and relaxing. Basic attire/casual clothes are appropriate, no need to get dressed up in your best clothes. The food is not expensive, everything on the menu is under $20. Oh I will definitely return again and again!"}
{"text":"Been to this place a few times and the quality of the food never disappointed. 
It's difficult to find good Indian food in Cleveland and this place is definitely a good option whenever u crave the taste of a restaurant cooked meal."}
{"text":"I just had the lunch buffet and can say definitively that this is the best Indian buffet food that I've had on the US. They don't westernize it by dumbing down the spices or heat to suit American tastes. I walked out extremely satisfied and full. If you've never had Indian food then this is a great place to have your first experience as this is how good Indian food can really be!"}
{"text":"I love this place!!!! My mom and I went for the lunch buffet, which is $10/person... My favorite  items were the lamb and chicken... Naan is fresh! Service was also excellent, kept water filled. So happy to have a place like this open up in Strongsville!"}
{"text":"Driven by a few times since they opened their doors, and finally on my way home from doing some errands I stopped in for a bite to eat.

Very friendly staff, and a nice atmosphere inside the restaurant.

I started with the vegetarian somosa.  The order comes with two good sized somosas, and they are very tasty.  I really enjoyed it with the tamarand chutney that was provided.

For my main course I had the chicken tikka masala.  Also, very good!

It is obvious that this place puts a lot of care and attention into the quality of their food.  I look forward to many more meals here.

Oh, and they have a lunch buffet that is available on the weekends, too!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing, service is fast, staff is courteous, and the inside is beautiful. Great place I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. The service was attentive, the Saag (a dish I'm very familiar with and so I use it as a point of comparison when trying a new place)  was delicious, we each had ours prepared mild.  The spice was just right and it was full of flavor. The vegetable pakora were amazing and plentiful. I think there were about 10 of them on the plate. We also had garlic naan and an order of Raita which wash creamy and delicious.  I will definitely go again if  I'm in the area and look forward to trying something new."}
{"text":"Crown of India opened Dec 8, 2015 in Strongsville. I am a big fan of Indian food (see my reviews of other area Indian restaurants: Cuisine of India, Jaipur Junction and Bhelwala)

Since we came on opening day, there were a few challenges. They did not seem to have menus yet. Luckily they had a lunch buffet and we were very pleased with that option. 

The lunch buffet cost $9.95 and included basmati rice, naan, chicken tikka masala, tandoori chicken, lamb rogan josh, tomato soup, fish pakora, vegetable pakora, samosas and a few other items. The food was delicious and fresh. 

Service was friendly. Could have been a little more prompt with removing used dishes but it wasn't a big deal. Water was not served with ice, although I didn't request ice. 

The restaurant was clean and the atmosphere was pleasant. Since we live nearby we plan to stop by again and see how it all goes. A few growing pains now, but it looks like this restaurant will do well."}
{"text":"Heavenly Indian food! Went for the lunch buffet that had a wonderful selection - aloo gobi, tikka chicken, tandoori chicken, mixed vegetables, chicken mahkini, saag with chunks of tender lamb, paneer with chili sauce, two types of rice, and of course, raita, salads, green mint sauce, etc. Every dish was flavorful and well seasoned. I'd say about medium spice levels, but such a burst of flavor in your mouth! Really enjoyed the selection, preparation, and quality and will definitely come back and bring friends!

Back again May 21 for yet another excellent meal. Lamb with mushrooms, saag paneer, tikka masala, veg korma, and more! All expertly seasoned - bursts of flavor."}
{"text":"Finally, a good place to eat in Strongsville!!!"}
{"text":"This is hands down the best Indian food in the area. We have tried other places and every time, we are left wanting to come back to Crown of India. Truly the best!"}
{"text":"My favorite Indian restaurant in Cleveland.

Service: Always on point with owners checking in on customers frequently.

Food:

Appetizers: Samosas are excellent. Fish Tikka and Paneer really good.

Entrees: Rogan Josh, Chicken Tikka Massla, Chicken Korma have all been excellent. Nice flavor regardless of spice level."}
{"text":"Service was great, food was excellent!  We had the buffet and mango lassis; definitely going back again soon!"}
{"text":"I've ordered takeout from this little gem several times and have always been super happy. The food is always flavorful and delicious. I definitely would recommend!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious and service was great. Try the buffet on the weekends. All the dishes were spicy and the staff was great about replenishing the food. We came here in here in a large party. Called ahead of time and they were nice about accommodating."}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service! I recommend going for lunch and getting the buffet. The quality is consistent, which can be hard to find. It's one of my new favorites!"}
{"text":"awesome food, support local business! I crave this place, it is delicious!"}
{"text":"The food here was truly amazing. I don't typically write reviews, good or bad, but I loved this place so much to not. We took out 20 month old son, so it is ok for children. And we ended up taking food home, great portions."}
{"text":"Finally got to try the lunch buffet here today.  I'm no authority on Indian food but everything tasted good and fresh.  The service was pretty indifferent.  The spice level left me with that nice warm glow in my middle that I remember from my lunches in Little India in Singapore."}
{"text":"Very tasty Indian food at the lunch buffet. I've only tried the buffet so I can't speak for the menu but I was very happy with the choices offered on the buffet. There were more entree dishes than at most Indian buffets. 6 or so entrees plus all the sides, raita, sauces, naan, salad, pakora. Everything was very fresh and spiced just right. Raita was excellent and fresh. The buffet was $9.95 on a Saturday, I assume it is the same price every day since there is a sign on the door. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing...no words describe!

I can get lunch take out from the buffet which has been great, or can sit and peruse their menu. 

They have great vegetarian options too, and the naan is fabulous. 

The place is clean and nicely decorated too. I love coming here on my own or with coworkers."}
{"text":"Crown of India is one of those places that my girlfriend may suggest for dinner, and I'll ponder it for a while before agreeing, and every time I wonder why I even took a second to debate the recommendation in my mind in the first place. It's clean, the service is friendly (although I wish they'd put ice in the water), and the food is absolutely delicious; every time. 

It seems that most Indian Restaurants around offer a buffet, but for those of you who are sneeze-guard-averse such as myself, you will be happy to know that Crown of India also offer a full menu on weekends from which they are happy to serve from (I find that many Indian restaurants push their buffets). 

If you're new to a Indian cuisine, I would suggest that you try a tandoori or vindaloo dish with a helping of their tandoori breads. The Keema Naan is very good, and different. They will also prepare your dish at the spice level of your choosing. I generally go \"hot,\" but be warned; it's HOT. 

If you're feeling adventurous, bookmark Crown of India and give it a try."}
{"text":"Great Indian food on the west side of cleveland. Excellent customer service, food portion are good."}
{"text":"Omg, stopped in never being there and I LOVED IT! NAAN CURRY EVERYTHING!!!
My mouth is on fire and I can't be happier... Go here eat here so good sooooo good!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was nice. The food was really really good. The restroom was average as far as cleanliness which doesn't cut it for me. The owner? was a bit hard to understand but the server was very nice and clear. We received our menu recommendations from the nice ladies seated next to us. Great choices. If I could remember what everything was called I would include in review. But it's 5 star to me bc it was not overpriced and the food was very flavorful, not over cooked and soooo good! Just wish they served alcohol."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! The food is amazing! The service is great and the people who work here are wonderfully kind :)"}
{"text":"Not a ton of options for their buffet but they use a nice amount of spices and the food was worth the trip."}
{"text":"Two words, complimentary Papadum- this crispy flatbread/cracker comes with a trio of chutneys/sauces and are brought out immediately with glasses of water when you dine in for dinner.  My favorite Indian restaurant does not even offer papadum and I wished they did.  I came in with some newbies to Indian cuisine and they absolutely loved every single dish we ordered: Vegetable pakora, Chicken Korma, Shrimp Masala, Lamb Saag, Aloo Gobi and Naan. The Chicken Korma was so good-perfect for dipping with Naan, the Lamb was very tender, but the Shrimp Masala was the star of our meal. The big pieces of shrimp were cooked perfectly and the sauce was amazingly delicious.  I also loved the little dishes our meal was served in-made us feel like royalty even though the prices were very affordable.  For the five of us, 5 dishes, 1 appetizer and 2 orders of Naan was more than sufficient. We even had leftovers! Service was very friendly and welcome too. Glasses were always full with water and smiles were endless. It's refreshing to have a restaurant like Crown of India in a sea of chain restaurants and I would gladly make the trek from Lakewood to Strongsville for this experience again"}
{"text":"Everything and I mean everything was fantastic.  Mango and Salty lassi were both tasty.  The vegetarian dishes are flavorful and unique. Mango chicken had heat and sweetness.   Oh and the desserts... honey rice balls and the paneer in yogurt were both so good my kids ate them all.  Please eat here!!!"}
{"text":"We LOVE the food here but unfortunately the takeout portions are really small for the price! Such a shame because the dishes are so delicious and it's such a convenient location. The food is always ready on time which is another big plus. My favorites are tikka masala and butter chicken. The garlic naan is also great. Tried the buffet one time and was very impressed with the selection especially for the price! It made me even sadder that takeout here is so pricy for so little food. I wish they'd get larger containers for the higher prices! Until then, it's definitely a better deal to do the buffet or eat in."}
{"text":"Excellent Indian food, great staff and well priced!! If if I can suggest anything get the malai kofta!!!"}
{"text":"Never had Indian food until today.  My son and I stopped by for lunch and were treated to a fantastic introduction Indian food.  The lunch afforded a selection of various dishes.  I sampled them all and was not disappointed.  We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Spectacular hospitality and most delightful food.... Don't let the lack of ratings confuse you.... Try this place you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch buffet. The food was not tasty. The chole and batura was good. Rest all items were just ordinary. 
Also time for them to replace all cutleries. All faded and looks unclean.  Not enuf staff to handle the crowd too."}
{"text":"Best Indian food in the area. Great wait staff. Cant complain. What is a tip and why do i have to type all this out just so i can post this as a legitimate review on yelp?oh wiat but if i add this sentence then now its good to go. Ok hold on just a few more words ok good."}
{"text":"Went in for the lunch buffet they had an excellent selection all the food was fresh and delicious. Our server was very friendly and attentive but not too pushy. We ended up sitting there talking for awhile after they had closed for lunch and they were very gracious about not kicking us out of the restaurant. I'll definitely be back again soon!"}
{"text":"This place is just Ok to me. Cuisine of India in Parma Heights, OH is so much better."}
{"text":"Loved everything we ordered today:  Salted Lassi; Saag Paneer; Daal Bukhara; chole Pindi; Mumtaz Paneer; Peas Pulav; Ghobi kulcha; Aloo Paratha; Garlic Naan; and Bhatura.  Perfect spice level -8  Awesome service and elderly gentleman was very accommodating.  Delicious Food"}
{"text":"I absolutely love their dal makhani and mutton Rogan josh. They serve delicious naan. I have been here quite a few times now and they seem to get better with time."}
{"text":"My family and I rank Indian food as one of our favorite cuisines. We've eaten at Indian restaurants literally around the world (London, Montreal, San Francisco, Chicago, Madhur Jaffrey's place in NYC, and on.....). I own 6 Indian cookbooks and cook Indian at least once every couple weeks. Crown of India is as good if not better than any Indian restaurant at which we've ever eaten. What a gem for greater Cleveland. Atmosphere warm and welcoming, service great, and the menu expansive. The only drawback is that they presently do not serve beer or wine. To have been able to have a well-crafted IPA to go along with the food would have taken it to an even higher level. However, as this is a food review, the 5-star rating doesn't change! Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant! Stopped for the lunch buffet at 1:00 on a Wednesday afternoon based on other Yelp reviews and was not disappointed. Sadly only three patrons were in the restaurant, but everything tasted fresh and warm and was fully stocked. Several chicken dishes, a lamb dish which was excellent, and a few vegetarian options. I tried them all and loved each--naan was soft and warm as well. Service was friendly. Dining area a bit small and darkish but aside from that no complaints. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!! I would recommend this place to all my friends and family. They are extremely authentic and very kind. They were quick with their service and the food was cooked perfectly. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"We enjoyed the lunch buffet on a Friday. The restaurant was nearly empty at 1:00. I certainly hope the word gets out that for $9.95 one can eat a variety of the best Indian dishes to be found in this area. Flavors were amazing, meats were succulant, veggies were not overcooked . . . the food more than met our expectations. The attentive staff members were pleasant, the space was neat and clean. We'll certainly be regular customers from now on!"}
{"text":"Nann is delicious and fresh out of the oven! When walking in, the smells are so delicious! We tried a variety of things and everything was delicious and packed very well to go. Plus, they deliver!"}
{"text":"Wow. Some of the best Indian food I've had and I used to go with a group of friends that met at different Indian restaurants every month. Seriously fabulous cuisine. Waiter was friendly and prompt. I had the chicken Kashmir, which was outstanding. We had rasmalai for dessert and it had a wonderful flavor. We are lamenting this restaurant is in Strongsville, instead of where we live in Solon. Go. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Lunch buffet has a great selection as well if that's your thang."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited here for the first time last night. She isn't accustomed to Indian cuisine so we stayed with a simple dish of chicken tikka masala. She enjoyed it finding the peppers and onions a nice touch. I had lamb shahi korma which was truly amazing. We shared garlic and paneer naan and meat samosas. By the end I was stuffed (having finished my portion and some of her masala).

Our dinner was excellent and we were pleased to see more rice whisked to our table when we had finished the portion served to us with our entrees. The staff were are very pleasant and welcoming. The menu has many selections and varieties of common dishes (korma with vegetables, lamb, chicken, or shrimp). There are many varieties of naan and multiple appetizers and desserts to select from.

I plan to visit soon for the lunch buffet served every day for under $10!

This might be my new favorite place in town to eat.

**Note, here I am a few months later and it is DEFINITELY my favorite place in the area. Also, I stopped for a very late lunch (1:30 PM) and found the buffet still very fresh and well-stocked. Treat yourself and visit here frequently to reward a restaurant that's doing everything so well!"}
{"text":"I loved this new Indian place in Strongsville! And Strongsville certainly needed one! We had the weekend buffet, and there was a surprising number of options! Most of the Indian buffets I have gone to only offer 1-2 main meat entrees and 1 rice option... this place had 3-4 meat entrees (a few chicken and 1 lamb) and 2 different kinds of rice! Everything was delicious... even my boyfriend enjoyed it all, and he doesn't eat Indian very often. I was certain that the buffet was going to be at least $15-20 with all the varieties they provided... it was a pleasant surprise when the bill came to only $10 per person! I even asked for hot sauce, and although it took awhile to arrive, it was obvious that it was homemade, fresh and hot in spice and temperature! We will definitely be coming here again... if the buffet stays this good, it's going to be hard to try anything else off the menu! Great value!"}
{"text":"After all the positive reviews I was excited.  Food was salty and nana was not good. I will stick with Jaipur it's worth the extra drive for certain. I can only comment on buffet."}
{"text":"I am so glad this restaurant is in Strongsville and close to my work and home! Best Indian food I have ever had and feel comfortable after eating. Very good curry and rice and best naan (with a bit green onion but not too oily). The staff there is also very fast at preparing our office's pick-ups but need a slightly better way to mark the food (we have multiple orders) or we won't know what we ordered. The buffet is the best, especially the dark green lamb/chicken thing, desserts are nice. Make sure you try the mango lassi or regular (with a white color) lassi."}
{"text":"I have been waiting for a really authentic Indian restaurant to open near by. And the meal here was FANTASTIC!!!!! Highly recommend !"}
{"text":"I've been making my way around to all of the most notable Indian restaurants in the greater Cleveland area and I keep coming back to Crown of India. Other places are good, sure. They're excellent, even. There are other places I would also go back to, but if I could only pick one spot, this would be it. 

The service here is phenomenal. There is a young man who is always smiling and so polite. He's been there almost every time I've visited and is a pleasure.

The weekend buffet is hard to beat. While most places have one bread options (naan), Crown of India has two. While most places have limited meat options, Crown of India has at least two or three, including a lamb dish. While most places cater to American taste buds, Crown of India isn't afraid to keep the spice level authentic. I need lots of water (or a lassi) when I eat here, but it's so good I don't care. 

Some of my favorite offerings include their vegetarian korma, lamb curry, tandoori chicken, samosas, gulab jamun...I could keep going. It's honestly all good. I think the only things I've ever shied away from were those that were a tad too hot for me (like I said, it's spicy here and I'm a bit of a wimp). 

I love this place!"}
{"text":"Delicious. I ordered two carry out meals and an appetizer and it could easily have fed four people. I would be happy to go back. I especially like that you can specify how spicy you would like your food. I'm not too familiar with Indian food and look forward to working my way through the menu."}
