{"text":"So this is chinese food when everyone is closed... The delivery is slow and the driver is usually angry or annoyed when delivering and the food is so so. There are many better restaurants that serve chinese food but if you are up late and this is your last ditch effort, order and beware."}
{"text":"I went here for Thanksgiving as it was one of the few places open in town. I was a bit confused because it's actually the same location as the Edo Japanese restaurant. They just make Chinese food for takeout. But we ordered Chinese food to eat at the restaurant anyway. The food was good and reasonably priced. The waitress was nice and chatted with us a little bit."}
{"text":"I love this place. The portions are huge and the prices aren't bad at all. The food is great, I've never been disappointed (I always get the chicken moo shoo). The menu has something for everyone, and the delivery is really fast!"}
{"text":"Ordered Shrimp w/lobster sauce  & chicken w/pea-pods, order of crab ragoons and was to get one shrimp & one veggie egg roll.,  Order came in 30 minutes and got two pork rolls instead of what I ordered.  Taste - ehh, had better but it wasn't greasy as other deliveries I have had.  Still looking for that place......"}
{"text":"There are only two restaurants that offer sushi for delivery from grub hub.  This and Edo Japanese.  This compared to Edo, Oriental Wok is definitely the loser.  Their sushi is better than grocery store sushi, but that's about it.  Ordered their wonton soup.  Broth is flavorless.  Wontons are ok, but the casing has no flavor.  Received two free egg rolls.  At first, tasted ok.  Second bite, I had to spit it out.  I'll be throwing the soup away.  Delivery guy was 20 minutes after the estimated time.  Had to call the restaurant.  Woman who answered wasn't sure how far away he might be.  Luckily, when I asked her to find out, she made a call.  He was only a few minutes after that.  Long story short, sushi is just ok.  Not as good as Edo.  Neither are amazing sushi, but definitely better than grocery store sushi.  Everything else here, beware."}
{"text":"As others have already mentioned, this is standard Chinese takeout, nothing fancy.  But they also have sushi rolls, and they deliver to my office, so I order here regularly."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout.  Delivered reasonably fast (25 minutes, 10 minutes ahead of estimate).  Order was accurate.  Food was hot.    Food was very good.   Hot & sour soup has a rich flavor and was nicely spiced, although could be hotter.  Shrimp egg rolls were moist, and the shrimp pieces large and de-veined.  Hot & spicy chicken also had a rich flavor, with plenty of meat balanced with onions, peppers and vegetables.  Could have been a little spicier though.  (Suggest they ask your level of spice when ordering.)   I'd say this is above average Chinese food for the area, and a great value.  Looking forward to also trying the sushi.  Nice to have another good alternative to Hong Kong Caf√©, which is where I usually eat."}
{"text":"Food is very good, menu is very extensive.  Despite online ordering, they can't get an order correct, and the delivery drivers act like the walking dead.  Here's a lesson, guys, when I hand you money, including a nice tip, a smile, and a thank you, it's OK to speak words.  You don't have to sulk away.  Really.  People order delivery for the experience and service.  It's supposed to be pleasant."}
{"text":"Big meh.  This place'll do in a pinch, and there are some popular rolls they do pretty well (spicy tuna and salmon come to mind), but ultimately it's cheap, mediocre sushi that you order because they deliver for a reasonable price and not because it's really that good.  Avoid the gyoza -- it's gummy and flavorless.  Choose the shumai instead.  And certainly steer clear of the Chinese food section of the menu unless you're okay with eating a half-step up from mall-food-court-Chinese.  Worst of all, though, last time we ordered from them, we got a yellowtail roll that had definitely begun to spoil.  My boyfriend ate one piece, decided it tasted funny, and I smelled them and something was definitely off.  Thankfully he didn't get sick, but I doubt we'll be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"The most recent order I got from this place was actually horrible.  The sushi was warmish...which was weird.  And it just tasted like rubber.  Meh!"}
{"text":"A good Chinese restaurant typically has good food and bad service. Oriental Wok has bad food and good service. The staff was so friendly when i came to pick up my takeout, and the food was hot and on time.  I got crab rangoon and hot and spicy chicken. The crab rangoon was pretty regular; it was hot and crispy but also chewy towards the interior with substantial cream cheese filling and a sweet sour dipping sauce. Thats exactly what I wanted. The chicken sucked though. They used strippy chunks of breast meat. The actual meat tasted a little funky (perhaps it was freezer burned); i would hope for unmarinated chicken breast to have a neutral flavor. They used a good amount of vegetables which is reminiscent of typical kung pao chicken. The sauce wasnt very spicy at all; it was more sweet and salty. It kind of reminded me of a very mild buffalo sauce diluted in salad dressing before being warmed up again. The dish left my mouth with an aftertaste similar to barbecue potato chips.  Perhaps I just got a bad dish that i expected to be crispy thigh meat cooked in chili oil with onions. I'm definitely willing to try other things on their menu.  Pros: cheap, friendly, fast Cons: not authentic"}
{"text":"Now joining the ranks of one of the more tolerable faux-Chinese restaurants in Madison (in my opinion): Oriental Wok.  Like some of the others, this rating is based solely on delivery. They were pretty quick, too, so claps for that.  The place is reasonably priced and apparently, good for sushi cravings. I'm not much of a sushi person myself (I hate seafood), so I went with the Chinese side of the menu. I was a little worried after reading some of the reviews, but decided to give it a shot anyways.  I got the boneless short ribs and General Tso's. Neither of which are particularly impressive, but neither are foul tasting. Of the two, the boneless short ribs was the winner--they were not as stiff as I expected nor were they as dry. There was a flash of cinnamon in addition to some other flavors I couldn't quite recognize. Mixed with the white rice, it made a perfect meal for a carnivore like me.  The General Tso's on the other hand, was a mild disappointment. Unlike a lot of other Americanized-Chinese places in town, the preparation didn't leave the nice, crunchy exterior. Instead, it was softer. And surprisingly, had a little bit of a zest that's usually muted in other General Tso dishes.  It wasn't the best Chinese food I've ever had, but there are a lot worse you could do. I may have been lucky and gotten a fluke of good food because it's Easter and not many people are probably ordering out--but at least it'll make good leftovers for work tomorrow."}
{"text":"I order from here on GrubHub. The food is always excellent and huge portions. Delivery is not as fast as I would like but the food usually arrives in 30-45 minutes and is always piping hot."}
{"text":"Well, this delivery option has gone way downhill. I've ordered from them twice in the last month and have been very dissatisfied. The first time, the order was missing some things. Also, the Szechuan tofu I ordered was really bad. It was really just tofu swimming in a watery chili juice with a few tiny pieces of chicken in it. Wow, nope. I called and complained about this and the missing eggrolls and was promised free apps next time. I ordered last night and got the Hunan scallops. For 9 bucks, we had hoped for more than 5 thinly-sliced scallops. It was almost all broccoli and green peppers. BU HAO CHI. Also, there is a coupon for free crab Rangoon if you order over a certain amount. I asked to use that coupon, and they sent me TWO orders of crab Rangoon. So, instead of saving me money and comping the one order, they just charge me for the first order and throw in another. This seems shady. I made it very clear I only wanted one order of them. This has happened more than once.  Lastly, I ordered some sushi, which is usually passably good. This time, an entire roll (the Christmas roll) was fishy-tasting and inedible. In the past, if you ordered a roll spicy, they'd add some spicy mayo to the roll. Now, I have both recent times gotten a roll slathered with Sriracha. That sucks.  Sure, we got some free eggrolls. This did not nearly make up for the lousy sushi and scallop miserliness.  It seems like Oriental Wok is cutting some corners, and it shows. I won't be ordering delivery from them until they can remedy the declining quality of their food."}
