{"text":"I ordered the fried chicken lunch combo to go. It all came neatly packed in a small styrofoam container stuffed to the brim with a quarter chicken dark with rice and beans and a slice of plantain. 

Dee-licious!  Very flavourful, felt like I was eating food at a backyard BBQ. The fried chicken isn't breaded like KFC, it's like jerk chicken then fried. The skin is crisp. 

The rice, perfectly cooked and seasoned. Love the kidney beans.

I'm coming back here, it's seriously good. :)"}
{"text":"Ordered the oxtail came with rice and beans, coleslaw, and two plantain chips. I would say that it wasn't that good, overall I paid $9.50 without a drink. The oxtail seemed soggy and mushy, leaving me to believe it was an old one. Ate a few then I left out the oxtail, eating only the others. I was really disappointed with the food quality. The time I arrive there I was the only customer (I was in for 15 mins). They however have jerk chicken, pork, and others for 4.99, I should've gone for that instead of the oxtail. The place was also small, but looked clean (3 stools for dining in), so I gave a generous 2 star. Im going to stick with the real jerk in downtown for the best Caribbean food in Toronto."}
{"text":"A little place located in a rather inconspicuous strip mall, but definitely glad we tried it! Had the jerk chicken, jerk pork and ox-tail. Jerk chick and pork were great, portions were a healthy size, ox-tail not quite as good as the Real Jerk, but if I have a craving for Caribbean food I'm coming here!"}
{"text":"Question: Why would I go to a Caribbean Take-out shop in a plaza that is dominant of Sri-Lankan & Indian food? That is still a mystery to me but I still followed a man inside this shop that definitely looks interesting from the outside, although it is pretty hidden inside this plaza. 

What got me to take that extra step inside had something to do with the $4.99 Lunch Special with a Pop included (+0.5 *Star*). A tiny place inside that verifies why they note \"Caribbean Take-out\" as you're pretty much at the register counter so you can't turn around and leave as some customers occupy the 3-4 stools eating on the wall-facing counter space. 

Pop selection is limited and the Lunch Special gives 4 options(Jerk Chicken, Fried Chicken, BBQ Chicken, Jerk Pork). I was so full of EMOTION from this meal I even had a single tear as I dug in to my Jerk Chicken which had an excellent Jerk Seasoning Rub and it was slathered on very generously. 

The Rice & Peas were nice and that slice of Fried Plantain was yummy perfectly cooked and offset that spice which to me(non-spicy person) had a wonderful dimension to it. All that said, the Chicken itself was overcooked slightly a bit mushy for my taste. (-0.5 *Star) 

No washrooms here so if you wish you may go outside to that large wilderness/water area next to this plaza and do your business but make sure you bring an umbrella when it rains.

{"text":"Why would I go to Homestyle Caribbean?? 

- I have to admit because they have Lunch Specials which I could not resist. 
- My \"never give 5 star\" Yelp friend giving this takeout place a solid 4 and telling the Yelp world that eating Jerk Chicken made him emotional and cried??! 
- My\"secret following my reviews\" Yelp Fan private messaged me saying I have to go eat at Homestyle.. 

Unfortunately their lunch specials ($4.99) no longer includes pop.. but pop is not too good for you anyway. I still giving them 4 stars because of the food... 

Jerk Chicken Lunch Specials ($4.99) 
- Generous jerk rub seasoning..so spicy...so good...and have a complex flavour... 
- Dark Meat!! Unhealthy but tasty... Moist and tender... 
- \"OMOMOMOMOMO!\" 

Now I need to go back and try the Jerk Pork.. wondering if it is as good and sinfully fatty! 

Fish's Friday if you are looking for Caribbean style escovitch, steamed fish or brown fish stews..."}
