{"text":"Amazing coffee, biscotti, sandwiches, salads! And they even even have beer for drinking in or to go!"}
{"text":"I've visited a few times since it has opened with a number of people in my party and the food was fantastic!  The chips are delicious and I learned they are made fresh on site every day. The grilled cheese had crisp bacon and apple slices and was fantastic.  My wife had a club sandwich which she loved and raved about the broccoli cheese soup.  The beer was very good and selection was enough for me.  I haven't had the coffee yet but I've heard great things.  The ambiance is very welcoming and appropriate to the neighborhood.  Great old neighborhood pictures."}
{"text":"We were driving through Shadyside on a rainy Saturday morning looking for someplace to get coffee and breakfast when Friendship Perk And Brew showed up. Great cup of hot coffee ! I ordered the spinach feta omelet which was perfect. Edges were beautifully browned, inside was deliciously soft and gooey with melted feta. My husband ordered the sausage breakfast sandwich. The sausage was perfectly spicey to compliment the eggs and cheese. We were greeted by the smiling staff as soon as we walked in and enjoyed the entire experience. Nick the owner made a special effort to make us feel welcome. He has done an amazing job in converting an abandoned 7/11 into a new warm and welcoming coffee shop. We will be back. I wish we had this in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere. Quality products. Exceptional service. This is more than coffee and beer. It's an overall wonderful experience. Great place to meet up with friends, morning or evening. Great place to relax and enjoy the ambiance. Just great!!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. It feels more like a restaurant that serves coffee than a coffee house.  I would recommend the homemade fig dressing with any of the salads.  The beer cheese pretzels are very addictive and you can't stop eating them.  The candied bacon is another homemade recipe and a must try appetizer.   My wife and I had a great experience stopping in for dinner."}
{"text":"I've been here several times now and I have to say this has been such a welcome addition to the community. The coffee is great, the atmosphere is cozy, and the food is amazing. If you want the best meatball hoagie in the city you have to try here. I've never been more satisfied. And the staff are incredibly friendly"}
{"text":"Today was my first time going to Friendship Perk & Brew. I am a nurse and I work close by, so this location is perfect! After nightshift, this place has everything needed to refuel. Breakfast, coffee, gelato, beer on draft and bottles, etc. The atmosphere is cozy and very clean. The food was delicious and there was a good variety of foods. The staff and owner are very nice and welcoming. I had a great experience here and will definitely be coming back often after work!!"}
{"text":"I've been anxiously awaiting this place to open for a few years that I've lived in the neighborhood but unfortunately I am disappointed. They have an extensive menu that I didn't get to try because their lunch doesn't start til 11 and we came in around 10am. They presented us with their \"breakfast menu\" which is one thing. A breakfast sandwich that you can get on different types of bagels..was hoping for more. The sandwiches were decent but the white mocha I ordered was the most bland, watered down coffee I've ever had....The woman who took our order was not very friendly either. Overall nothing that left me wanting to come back. Maybe and hopefully lunch is better.."}
{"text":"What a find! True mom and pop type place. We had the grilled chicken sandwich (tender and juicy), cheddar broccoli soup (INCREDIBLE), and the perogis were divine. Nick, the owner, was around and is so friendly. We had great coffee and tea but I saw they have beer on draft. Couldn't recommend more!"}
{"text":"I've been anxious to check out this new place down so close to me and it didn't disappoint. I only took off one star because the service was slow and the ladies working lacked a serious sense of urgency and were rude as we ordered. However, my iced tea was delicious and our food was FABULOUS. like seriously, did not disappoint. The dressings are all homemade and everything we had was better than expected. I foresee this place being a regular for me."}
{"text":"Stopped for coffee and bagel this mornin. So glad I did, if u get a chance check it out."}
{"text":"Breakfast sandwich is phenomenal as is the chai! The service is also very friendly! We had to wait longer than expected for our food and the owner apologized personally and they threw in a free cup of fruit. Looking around service in general seemed very fast so I'm not reducing any stars here. I have not been for evening trivia or any other key features but would highly suggest this place for a solid brunch spot. Seems like it's never too busy in the mornings and there is ample space for even a decent sized group. Definitely some place I intend to frequent. Great space for that person looking for a place to do some early morning work in a peaceful environment. I think the tucked in neighborhood location has this off of some popular radars, which, from what I've seen, seems like a win!"}
{"text":"Today was my first day here. Wonderful coffee and food. I love the environment. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Came by a few days ago. IT WILL BE THE LAST TIME. The Female employee up front stood around doing nothing for 15 minuets before asking if I needed anything.?? Coffee COLD Sandwich DRY Service TERRIBLE.! To make the visit worse ( I am working at the local Hospital)  I could hear the Cooks screaming about the Owner (NICK) screwing over the last (4) FOUR?  Kitchen Managers who ALL walked out apparently since opening only (3) MONTHS AGO.?? I have already passed on this issue to all at the Hospital. Does anyone care about the patrons at this unorganized CIRCUS.? DO NOT WASTE YOUR $$$$ HERE."}
{"text":"So glad to have this place in walking distance.  The veggie wrap was very good and came with homemade potato chips. The kids chicken tenders were real and the breading was great. The beer selection is small but has a nice variety and the serve both 8 and 16 oz pours."}
{"text":"Ordered spinach and feta omelette, received not that. For a place labeled \"Perk\" I kinda expected the coffee or espresso to be on point, nope."}
{"text":"I love Love Love that google maps brought me to this gem! What a great combo, coffee, food and beer?! Fried pickles were great, house salad and Greek salad were both delicious. Lovely ladies that are the waitresses."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! They have a decent selection of beers, coffee, and some good eats. Most of the food & brew is locally sourced and reflect a true Pittsburgh feel (portions are sizable and loaded with flavor). The frozen custard is a must! Joanne (one of the owners) is an eclectic, eccentric, motherly old soul with an eye for detail. They know how to cater for the very cosmopolitan crowd frequenting this joint. It is the type of place you can visit and experience a true piece of Western-PA, put down your mobile phone/laptop and actually have a conversation with someone. And if you really need to be antisocial there is a sign with the WiFi password... ;-)"}
{"text":"it was a cold rainy afternoon in the Burgh...I was in need of a warm sandwich and a place to sit and relax.  Friendship is a great neighborhood lots of beautiful old houses including one right on South Pacific where Perk and brew is located easy parking in the street  headed in very welcoming  cases of yummy looking bakery items  you order at the counter  and then your food is brought to you  menu on the board offering salads , sandwiches And a reuben I was in the mood for a reuben but as you know they have corned beef in them I asked for a reuben hold the meat the girl said no problem  the bakery case had mini pies including pumpkin which I chose  I was asked if I wanted whipped cream yup!  lots of coffee offerings  and chai beverages I ordered and iced chai its a relaxed atmosphere with plenty tables  wood floors and a living room feel with big old pictures of and I am assuming its the neighborhood  the waitress is the sweetest came to see if my sandwich was what I wanted. It was better then expected Swiss cheese on nice toasty marble rye. There was a side of chips with a bit of savory spice to them my little pumpkin pie was perfect not to sweet I really enjoyed it (next time I will try the pumpkin brownie.  my chai was spicy which is so good not watered down blah  We even discussed the neighborhood and she told me where her gram's house used to be and I told her about the \"haunted' house I went to see ( I was looking for my new home) we both agree this is a nice neighborhood  I fully agree this is a great coffee spot to have a bite and a coffee I'll be back for sure"}
{"text":"It took two long years for Perk and Brew to open, but it appears to be well worth the wait. Beautiful place with great food/coffee/beer, a great vibe and friendly staff. Welcome addition to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, beautiful restaurant, perfect location. We ordered lunch and were served quickly. The sandwiches are very big - two of us shared one and left quite full and happy.  The sandwiches come with homemade chips! I recommend the \"Divine Swine\" with an 8oz draft."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic - skip the hipster Abby, this place is legit. Good food, warm atmosphere - free dog treats.  The ladies are super sweet, they'll sit down with you if you want to chat. 100% authenticity. Beers on tap are great - golden monkey, seasonal and nitro taps. Draft espresso, wut?!  The pretzels are divine!"}
{"text":"Been waiting for a year for this place to open. After a few weeks of being open they're already closing early before website says. Not good for a brand new business"}
{"text":"Been here a few times for drinks and they mess up my order every time. The ladies at the front are such nice people but they just really seem distracted or something because they can't listen for more than .5 seconds. I repeated myself several times on both occasions and ordered the same drink both times: an iced soy chai. First time they made it with real milk and this time I got an iced coffee which I couldn't even drink as coffee upsets my stomach.  The prices are also a little high, 2 coffees and a biscotti was over $10. The food menu doesn't have many things I can try so I don't think I will bother. Such a shame because they are nice and the space is beautiful. I just can't keep going to a place that can't get my order straight."}
{"text":"Just want to point out that they limit how long you can use their wifi while you're in there. Staffs were friendly and the food was okay."}
{"text":"If Mary Ann is at the register, just walk out. I don't even understand how bad she could have messed my experience up... Me and my infant daughter were the only ppl there (Saturday morning), I was charged for two meals, one with horseradish on the side and only received one; no receipt. After only one meal came (no horseradish), I asked about the other and she said she didnt put it in, so I paid again. She offered to print me out both receipts, but I didnt look. I took the second meal to go. Got home, thankfully the horseradish was there but it was on a bagel instead of the wheat bread I asked for. And one of the receipts she printed out was the wrong order.   Subpar food. Only went because it was local.  2-17-18"}
{"text":"The warmly inviting ambience is just the start of what will surely be a wonderful eating experience. The coffee is terrific, the food spot-on...not too fussy, but fresh and distinctive in flavor. This is like \"Cheers\"...the feeling that everybody knows your name, but not your social security number!  We were visiting from Long Island, New York so we're a tad judgmental about supposedly \"neighborhoody\" eateries...many being too cute by half, with food that tastes mass produced. But Friendship Perk and Brew is aptly named as the staff is delightful and the food delicious.   I am sure that FPB will soon be the go-to place to enjoy a cozy place to sit and chat, while having some fine eats from a creative, well made menu."}
{"text":"I am thrilled to have a new go-to coffee shop on the East End that has a large menu for both coffee and food options. It's hard to find a coffee shop that allows for you to sit and work for several hours, and that you could potentially eat several meals at if you want to work all day-- Friendship Perk and Brew might just be that place Pittsburgh has been needing!   My pumpkin cold brew was really delicious, and while I didn't try any food, the menu looks like it has options for all kinds of eaters, and adults and kids alike. I also did not order any of their gelato, but I love the idea that you could have breakfast, lunch, dessert, and a beer here if you really wanted too (read: I want to).   Parking is also very convenient, as there is ample tandem street parking outside given that it is in the heart of the Friendship neighborhood and is surrounded by beautiful historic homes. The one downside is that they are closed on Sundays, which I had to learn the hard way...but hopefully it will be here to stay and can add Sunday business hours eventually!"}
{"text":"When we walked in it seems really nice. Good atmosphere, until you speak to someone. Everyone seemed annoyed to be there and there were only three people in the restaurant. I ordered a mocha and that wasn't even prepared well. I tried to smile at the lady and she wasn't even friendly. My wife tried to order a drink and the lady was put off that she had already entered the order. It was as if she was trying to rush through. Maybe a bad day for everyone in the restaurant. If you like a cold experience, this is the place for you. The food wasn't bad."}
{"text":"Banging peanut butter brownie, pretty good to great sandwiches, decent bottle selection, mediocre tap beer selection, poor coffee. Brunch starts this Sunday, stoked about that. Will report back, but from what I've heard it's decadent and unhealthy, exactly how I want to start the Lord's day.   Nick the owner is good guy, working hard to make the place the best. Gotta respect that."}
{"text":"Great place to have a nice bite and meet a friend or hang out.  A very comfortable coffee shop vibe. The lunch menu has a nice variety of sandwiches for a small coffee shop.  I had the cheesesteak and it was delicious - not overly greasy or huge in portion size. It was just right. My friend had a Reuben and enjoyed hers as well.  I'd definitely go back to try some coffee and breakfast items and more sandwiches."}
{"text":"I'm so glad I found this cute little cafe! I was looking for a good place to get lunch and saw this was nearby.  We walked in and were immediately immersed in the smell of coffee! We checked out the menu and decided on the adult grilled cheese a grilled cheese with multiple cheeses, bacon and apples and the Philly cheesesteak which had cheesesteak, onions, cheese and a delicious horseradish mayo! Both sandwiches came with homemade chips on the side and a pickle.  I highly recommend asking for a side of horseradish mayo and dipping your chips in it!!! We put our orders in at the counter and found a spot right next to the fireplace...so cozy! While we didn't partake, both coffee and beer were available hence the \"Brew\" portion of the name.  Our meals came out quickly and the the staff was super friendly! This is the perfect place to meet up with someone over lunch or to come and work on your computer! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First time at this neighborhood bistro, great atmosphere, coffee, beer and food! Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Thanks Nick and team! the temperature inside has been much more cozy since my last review. Love how they really engage with the community- hosting talks, fundraising for local causes, and the trivia night is great too. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Great addition to neighborhood!  Went there for dinner.  Fried pickles, homemade broccoli cheddar soup, Friendship sandwich.  Good beer selection."}
{"text":"We stopped in for breakfast, and it was just 'ok'. Nice people, but it was obvious they were quite new (9 weeks we were told) and still working the kinks out. The coffee was decent, and the space was clean- bonus points for offering free doggie treats."}
{"text":"I love this place! Great place to meet up with friends or a nice place to study or read. The owners are so friendly and nice. It feels like you are in someone's living room. The food is AMAZING! Best fried pickles!! And the chipotle BLT is delicious. Homemade soup and all around delicious food. I love the tea options and the beer selection is small but great quality (all you need in my opinion). Everything about this place is great! Oh and I brought my toddler here and he loved it. They have games for him to play and are not annoyed by him running around the place."}
{"text":"I'm always on the lookout for a new coffee joint. Luckily, Ive been in the neighborhood recently and decided to try it out!  It's a cute little spot, with great service! I've so far had an amazing pumpkin cold cold brew and just a cup of black coffee that was needed on a rainy day. Haven't tried the food yet, but it looks really good!"}
{"text":"I have been anxiously waiting for this place to open and it didn't disappoint! I popped in to check it out today and grab a coffee. My pumpkin cold brew was excellent and the interior was so warm and nice. They had a pretty extensive lunch menu and a dessert case (with pumpkin loaded brownies that I am regretting not trying). I will definitely be back to try the food! So excited for a place like this to be in Friendship - it really fits the neighborhood.   Oh, and I almost forgot. There's beer too! YAS!"}
{"text":"At first I thought they were having an identity crisis because they seem quite invested in being an espresso bar, draft/beer bar, cafè, and gelato. Amazingly, they actually succeed at everything. The staff are charming and the atmosphere is lovely. I would equally recommend them for a first date or your first meal/caffeine of the day."}
{"text":"First off, the space if really cozy--they did a great job with putting in lots of good-size tables perfect for working; a fireplace; exposed brick and wood--it's a nice vibe.  The menu is simple but has some great options.  Staff are beyond nice.  It's a great neighborhood cafe."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood coffee house with a limited menu, but an outstanding atmosphere.  If you live in the Bloomfield/Garfield/Friendship area.  Check this place out!"}
{"text":"This neighborhood cafe is just a five minute walk from our house and we've been waiting so long for it to open. And yay we're not disappointed. Such a nice coffee/beer house/cafe. There's six pours on tap, a cooler with a small selection of bottled beers, various coffees, steamers, espresso, etc. The cafe boasts a delicious menu with something for everyone. Decor is cozy yet roomy. Really so happy to have them finally opened! We will be regulars for sure."}
{"text":"I was visiting Pittsburgh and this coffee shop happened to be 2 blocks from the house. We all loved our drinks! The iced vanilla latte was delicious and their coffees were all great too! The coffee shop looked so warm and cozy and the workers were very nice!"}
{"text":"I had a really great sandwich and iced tea. The place is very well decorated (super cute!) and with good friendly service. I had been anxiously awaiting trying this place. I'm glad I did. I'll be back!"}
