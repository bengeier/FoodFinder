{"text":"Before trying the Wooden Spoon for the first time, I had read all of the positive reviews online (Yelp/Facebook) and was really looking forward to trying it out. I'm not sure if we got a bad day, or if this establishment has switched management or what... but it was not at all what we were expecting from the phenomenal reviews.  When my husband and I walked into the Wooden Spoon, there was a table of four women sitting with menus. Not busy at all. We went to the counter to review the menu ourselves. We could hear two women in the back talking. We stood for a couple of minutes and then one of the women emerged from the kitchen and went to the table of women. She glanced at us and said she'd be right with us. Another girl came from the back and asked us for our order. We placed the order, and she repeated it back. All fine. Then she looked at the computer screen and shouted to the other worker, \"I have a problem!\" The other worker was still with the table of women and tried to ignore how rude her coworker was being. She quickly finished with the women and came to her coworkers side. She fixed the issue with the system and apologized to us for the wait. It wasn't a big issue, just kind of shocking how uncouth the first worker was.  My husband and I sat down at a table and waited. And waited. And waited... Forty minutes passed and we were finally given our sandwiches. I ordered the sunny days sandwich. It was okay, nothing to write home about. My hubs ordered the Mykonos pita. He bit into it, and it was so crunchy, I thought for sure he broke a tooth! He opened the pita and there was no more than a 1/4 of tuna in it. For $9, we were expecting a lot better. The sandwiches were served with 6-7 stale potato chips and a \"side salad\" garnish. Seriously, 5 lettuce leaves does not a salad make.  The more experienced worker came to our table, and gave my husband a refund for his sandwich. She was apologetic and reiterated how she knew we had a long wait from the start. We are sad to say we will not be back."}
