{"text":"Brisket had a liquid smoke flavor, coleslaw was soggy but the portions were good for the price."}
{"text":"Surprisingly not many reviews for this great little BBQ joint. I stopped in for lunch, but my thought was that the TVs and blues music would make for an ideal spot to watch a game with friends. Great BBQ. 2 sauce types, regular and spicy, both good, both on the sweeter side of the taste spectrum. Considering the lack of many BBQ joints in Madison, this should be on the radar for BBQ fans."}
{"text":"Save your money and time, I stopped by to place a to go order and they only gave me four of five dinners I ordered. Took a long time to log the order into the iPad before the order printed in the kitchen. Remember the gold 'ol days when you just called the order to the kitchen?  That would have saved time. Portions are very small for the price. Definitely a pass on this restaurant, No need to make a second trip."}
{"text":"I am a fan.  I've been to the BS-BBQ twice now and both time I enjoyed the pulled pork.  It comes with a side, I had pot-sal today.  Chunky potatoes swimming in a deliciously creamy sauce.  Not all will like this kind, but I do.  the sandwich comes with a generous portion of pulled pork, topped with Slaw.  If asked for 'The Best BBQ in Town', I would not presume to know them all.  HOWEVER, I will tell you that this is my favorite BBQ joint in Madison of the ones I've tried.   Very friendly wait staff."}
{"text":"This is bordering on being a one but the friendliness of the waitress and the layout bumps it up a bit.

I tried cheese curds (basic recipe so it was alright) and their ribs with  potatoe and pasta salad. Also their blue cheese burger. The ribs were tough and a bit dry and the burger was a travesty. The burger was hard to describe, although it didn't seem to be underseasoned, all the flavors just blurred togeather into some strange old hamburger type taste. Very strange. The salads were ok but not my favorite. Finally the bbq sauces are very tomatoey which is not my style.

On the bright side though, I really really really liked their fries. They seemed house made and although I wouldn't recommend the dishes I tried, a plate of their fries would be nice to have.

As always though, you'll only know if you like it if you go there yourself and give the nice folks a shot. They have tvs and such so maybe try it out for one of the badgers bball games."}
{"text":"The fried cheese curds were decent but the brisket sandwich and fries were overly salted. 

The service was also subpar because there was only one person manning the entire restaurant (bar and table service) and one cook on a Friday night (before a Badgers home game, no less). While I felt bad for this woman as she was clearly swamped, this is a clear indication of poor management by only staffing two people on a weekend night.

The tap list is also pretty poor considering the wealth of breweries in the area. Lots of bottles rather than drafts."}
{"text":"My husband and I were here briefly for some food. The food was really good and they have great prices. It was under $20 (after tip) for a burger with fries and 2 sides, cheese curds, a rail drink and a beer.

The staff was friendly and if we're ever in the area again, we will be sure to stop here again."}
{"text":"First time here and super close to where I work. I ordered the Bacon Bleu BBQ Burger and fries. Service was fast and friendly. The burger was great but I wish it had a little bit more bbq on it. The fries were standard but piping hot. I'll be coming back more for lunch."}
{"text":"Had the 3 meats + ribs. Almost right up there with Mickelwait Craft Meats in Austin. This place is legit."}
{"text":"I've driven by this place many a times but never tried it before.

My boyfriend and I stopped in for dinner on a Friday night. 

It was a fairly quiet night.

Since the weather was gorgeous we decided to sit outside. The waitress asked us what we would like to drink without offering either of us a menu. When she did bring out the menu, there were no drink options listed on there. I asked her for recommendations and she kind of stumbled.

We ordered cheese curds as an appetizer. It was delicious but pricey for a small portion.

I ended up ordering a half rack of ribs with a corn muffin and a side of mac and cheese and potato salad. My boyfriend ordered the barbecue pulled pork sandwich with coleslaw.

My silverware set was dirty with hard water stain and his was stained with food residue.

The ribs were fatty and the meat was bland. My boyfriend had to cut it for me because it was tough and not trimmed properly.

The mac and cheese looked old and was lukewarm, I didn't even try it.

After the disappointing ribs I didn't even eat the potato salad.

My corn muffin was discolored. 

His pulled pork sandwich was dry and did not appear fresh at all.

The coleslaw did not have enough dressing.

The waitress was friendly but not very knowledgeable in menu items or drink choices.

I had to ask for wet napkins to wipe my hands after eating ribs.

Overall it was a very disappointing experience.

For two sodas, cheese curds, half a rack ribs and a pulled pork sandwich plus tip came out to about $40."}
{"text":"Best fried chicken that I have ever had. I was in town for a concert and stumbled across this restaurant. Next time I'm in town this is somewhere that I am making an effort to get to again."}
{"text":"I stopped in here for a late lunch so it wasn't busy and service was quick. I had the two meat combo with two sides. The toasted, buttered Texas toast was a nice change from a lot of places flimsy dry white bread. The baked beans were good, the potato salad was really good. The pulled pork and whatever sauce that comes with it was perfect. The brisket was not very good. It didn't have a good smoky flavor, I'd be surprised at if you told me it was even smoked for any amount of time. It was chewy and tasted more like it was cooked directly over a flame. Not bad if you're expecting a well done burger patty. Bad if you're expecting tender brisket. It also came with a piece of corn bread - a clearly store bought corn muffin. That's hard to screw up and was tasty. The sweet tea here was delicious. I'd come back if I'm ever in Madison again."}
{"text":"Went here on Saturday and had a great time! Staff was extremely friendly and helpful making menu selections. The Mac n cheese was fantastic! I would also highly recommend the Carolina bbq sauce. Bill was extremely reasonable, $12 for a meal with two sides and a beer. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Awful food. Worst rib tips I've ever had, and it wasn't particularly close. I still ate them because I really like tips, but I did not finish the slaw, which had a peculiar smell to it. 

Not sure why this is a place that exists."}
{"text":"Stopped to try the barbecue.

Hate to make a comment that doesn't relate to food but I wish they or whoever they lease from fixed the driveway slope as it scraped the front bumper on the way in.

Standard decor. Standard fare. The service was very good and attentive. Quiet on the afternoon was there. Unfortunately, ribs were just okay. The sauces were good.

Overall, won't make it on my rotation but other seem to like it. Each their own?"}
{"text":"I was always attracted by those pink pigs and cute cars besides the store. So I decided to give it a try. It turns to be a good decision. It's more interesting to read those reviews under this restaurant. Seems someone love it and someone hate it. Interesting!^_^"}
{"text":"Had the brisket sandwich with bacon and haystack onion rings, so good! Atmosphere was just like a BBQ joint should be. Server was very nice! We will be going back!!!"}
{"text":"Had the brisket at Taste of Madison.  So tough it was like shoe leather.  Obviously boiled or something.   No person in their right mind would prepare brisket like that.   Had to spit it into the garbage.   Shame."}
{"text":"We've driven past this place several times and recently found a coupon in dollars and sense. So, we thought we'd give it a try. If you're looking for \"fall-off-the-bone\" ribs...this is NOT the place you're looking for. We also tried the $5 spaghetti. It was great to dip the French fries in, but contained very few noodles and tasted of bottled BBQ sauce and canned tomatoes. To add insult to injury, the only beverage we ordered, a simple cocktail, was wrong. When we questioned it we were told WE were wrong. After very bites of our food we left it all sitting on the table and chose to leave. We will NOT be back."}
{"text":"Had a coupon, so was waiting for the opportunity.  That was last Friday evening.  Family was out of twon, so ventured over for take-out.
Place was empty, only one larger group an another customer waiting for take-out.  Place is unremarkable inside, and was hazy, not smoky, but a haze.  
Wanted  a combo ribs and chicken and didn't see on menu.   Settled on the pulled pork sandwich with dsides of fries and mac n cheese.  The entire meal was more than adequate. I really like the cole slaw on top of the meat.  Meat was tender and sauce was not overwelming. Sides were fine.
I like another reviewer had to wait on the Ipad ordering. My food was ready, and the wait person still couldn't get the correct total on the Ipad, so not wanting my dinner to get cold, i was finally able to pay, but didn't wait on the change.
Hopefully this place will get it together on the wait staff and ordering, as the food is better than the experience of trying to get it.
May be back."}
{"text":"While the flavor of their BBQ is alright, it seems to stop there. We ordered the rib tips for an appetizer and they were over cooked and tough. I asked for a Medium Rare Burger Bacon Blue Burger and it was medium well and lacking of flavor. There are bottles of regular and spicy BBQ sauce on the table and I'm wondering if someone put the regular BBQ sauce in the Spicy bottle as neither one had any heat at all, which is to bad as I was hoping that they would make the fries better. My partner got a pulled pork sandwich and he said that it was good, though his cornbread was like cake. Also, the servers (it took two and we were the only ones in the place) ideally should not make you feel uncomfortable and have to be asked for silver wear or plates."}
{"text":"We stopped for the dancing pig. Split a 3 meat dinner: brisket, pulled pork and sausage with 2 sides: potato salad and Cole slaw.  It was really good food.  My favorite was the sausage and potato salad.  Sausage was pleasantly spicy. The potato salad was made  with perfectly cooked red potatoes.

We eat barbeque wherever we travel. This met our standards. The new wait staff was very attentive and helpful. We would eat here again. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"Never will I go back to this restaurant. Me and my mom spent over an hour to eat a few chips and drink coffee and water. We ordered the pulled pork nachos, which had barely any pork on them, the chips were not homemade, and there was more salsa on them than cheese or pork. It took 20 minutes alone to get those and when we finally did, we sent them back, hoping to just get a different plate. The kitchen staffed grumbled loudly and we never saw the nachos again. 
Another 30 minutes passes, and we finally got our entree of rib tips, Mac and cheese, coleslaw, and cornbread. Our waitress happily announced our food just came out of the smoker. Yet they were lukewarm...? Maybe out of the smoker 20 minutes before, but not right before we got them. They were tough and fatty, and we could barely cut into them. They were just awful! The Mac and cheese was not flavorful and not at all what we were thinking as baked \"Mac and cheese\". Just gross. The homemade cornbread was cold and clearly store bought.
The waitress was the only nice thing about this place. She was friendly, albeit slow, and didn't charge us for food and tried giving us someone else's nachos as we were putting our jackets on. Although the way the kitchen staff looked at us and her, I'm sure they were angry with her for not charging us.
Save your money and go somewhere they actually know how to cook and treat customers."}
{"text":"The former Blair Street Brew & BBQ reopened yesterday under new ownership after some well-documented landlord/lease issues. There is a new menu now, but it's a BBQ joint so the choices are similar. They are still trying to finalize their liquor license, so if you enjoy a cold one with your 'cue like I do, you might want to wait a week or so to check this place out.

The gregarious waitress was attentive and friendly. She apologized for the lack of beer and because she hadn't tried everything on the menu yet and couldn't make recommendations, but our family's bbq credentials, of course, exceed Steve Rachlein's and Bobby Flay's, so went with the old standbys -- bbq chicken, beef brisket, mac & cheese, cole slaw, beans, potato salad, cornbread. The barbecue sauces are less sweet than we typically see in these parts, and that's just fine for me.

The creative twist on brisket -- served with a couple thick slices of bacon that came as lean as bacon can get, topped with coleslaw, mustard and some onion straws -- was well-smoked, tender and lean for the most part. I made sure to separate it from it's presentation to try it on its own. 

The chicken was juicy and smoky as well, coated with sauce and very easy to eat. The mac & cheese was as good as any I've tasted. I'd recommend the cole slaw and beans. The potato salad was seasoned, perhaps with garlic, and very flavorful. For the cornbread choice, go with the bread over the muffin. It is baked with real cream corn, which makes it a real treat.

The new owner, Chef DJ, is picking up where the previous owner left off, and serving good barbecue in a tough location for restaurants. He's doing more than well enough to make it, but you have to show up and keep coming back. I know we will."}
{"text":"This joint is legit- the Ole Hickory smoker is out in the open for all to see.  No Southern Pride pit here, these guys do the Missouri pit. I prefer Ole Hickory, don't know why.

They use cherry and apple for smoke, they're smoking brisket right now. I wish someone would make a BBQ smell perfume, I would totally wear it. 

Do yourself a favor, try the East Carolina sauce. Perfect blend of vinegar and heat.  This goes great on the pulled pork.  Great flavor that compliments that bark on the pork. The pork had a decent smoke ring that only comes low and slow. They serve the Sammie on a toasted kaiser roll that keeps everything together.

Baked beans appear to be a mixture of different beans in a slightly sweet sauce, I added the Carolina sauce and it really made the beans POP!  ( Hell I put the Carolina sauce on everything.) Word is they put Jack in the beans.

Potato salad was just a meh, but with the size of the sandwich I hardly needed a second side."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place and I will give it a second chance. We came here for some happy hour $1 PBRs and some smoked eats, but after eyeing what was being served I settled for the BBQ nachos. Flavorless \"smoked\" pork over, chips from a bag, with Pace picante sauce on top. Never again!

They are a staple of Madison with presence at most festivals and I drive past the dancing pig and piggy car everyday on the way to work. 

If you want some $1 PBRs for happy hour come here, just be careful with what food choices are made.

Interesting how they are usually empty..."}
{"text":"I went there with my wife and baby and I did not know that they had live music that day but it was way too loud so we ordered and took the food to go. We got home and started eating it, it was so salty and burnt. We tried to eat as much as we could but it was just terrible so we had to throw it away because it really was not edible. I felt really bad because I dont like wasting food or money(we spent about $30) Needless to say we will never go back there"}
{"text":"I've walked past this place so many times, and it's always been empty.  I've always wondered what the deal was, but never really curious enough to venture inside.  I'm glad it's open again now so that I can finally give it a try (heard it's under new ownership. so I suppose now it's not really the same restaurant... oh well).

Well I stopped in recently, and I was very impressed.  I went on a Saturday afternoon... and it was still empty; it was around 1:30 so not peak lunch hour or anything, but I wonder if a lot of people still think it's closed.  

It looks like the place is still coming together (one of their storefront signs was sitting on the a table inside, and there was some kitchen equipment inexplicably sitting in one corner of the dining room), but it was comfortable enough inside.

The menu is small, which is great for a BBQ place in my opinion; the focus should be on making a few things (meat, we're talking meat here) very well instead of trying to cater to every taste.  

I was just feeling like something small to eat, a lunch item, so I ordered the pulled pork nachos appetizer.  Definitely not small!  This is easily a four person appetizer, and even though I was very hungry I barely got through them.  It was pretty standard plating for nachos: chips, cheese (lots of it!), salsa (standard canned Pace-style, I believe :/...), meat, lettuce, some chopped red onions and a dollop of sour cream.  It looked really good (see my picture), and it tasted incredible as well,

The pulled pork was fantastic!  I mean it was all good, but the pork stood out even amongst the strong flavors of the sharp cheddar, salsa, and onions.  It was perfectly tender and smokey.

I definitely also made frequent and spirited use of the 2 BBQ sauce squeeze bottles on the table, one a \"classic\" sauce and the other a spicy iteration.  Having the sauce on the table MAKES a BBQ joint for me, so I really appreciate it.  

I'll give them some time to get the place together and then get back there for a more meat-centric meal.  And I fully expect I'll be rewarding them that 5th star at that time."}
{"text":"Did not have a pleasant experience at Blair Street BBQ. Restaurant was smoky when we entered (not cigarette smoky, more like too much BBQ smoke). Waitress informed us that the credit card machine was down, but there was an ATM in the building (which ended up not working either). Ordered the 3 Meat Sample Platter (which is set with pulled pork, brisket, and spicy sausage). Didn't wait too long for the food, but the plate came out with the wrong meat on it and was sent back. The portions were meager once we received our food. The beans were so dry they resembled re-fried beans. The spicy sausage was good, but pulled pork and brisket were served lukewarm and tasted sub-par. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"As a testament to my lunch time impulsiveness, the sole reason I dropped into Blair St BBQ was because some dude in a bright pink pig costume was waving at traffic on the corner of Blair and East Wash. Yep, that's good enough for me...

While the food was a bit of a disappointment, the service was not. A person behind the bar enthusiastically greeted me as I entered the restaurant.  I scored a table by the window and as soon as I was settled, my uber-attentive server came by to take my drink order and provide me with the Wi-Fi access code.  Throughout my meal, my server seemed genuinely committed to ensuring that my first experience at Blair Street BBQ was exceptional.   This was one of my better customer service experiences of my summer lunch expeditions.  4+ stars to my server in the blue t-shirt with the dropbox logo.

Unfortunately, the folks in the kitchen could not match the proficiency of the front of house.  I elected go with the BBQ pulled pork sandwich, since that was what my pink porcine friend was repping in front of the restaurant.  The sandwich came with a choice of a side (fries for me), three mini cornmeal muffins and a a cup of slaw.  The fries were your prototypical Sysco coated fries that offered up a pleasing crunch, but they got progressively saltier as I worked my way to the bottom of the pile.  The cornbread mini-muffins were cold, doughy and blah - no thanks.  The slaw also was totally generic - bland and not all that fresh.

While I enjoyed the substantial, toasted sourdough bun, I was less enthralled with its contents.  When done right, pulled pork is a succulent, almost decadent meal, offering up a deep satisfying flavor that almost melts in your mouth.  This restaurant does not get it right, their pork was dry and chewy and just plain forgettable.  It made me especially sad, because the Blowing Smoke food cart was so close and for the same price, I could have had an exquisite pork sandwich...

While the restaurant shows it age, it is clean and inviting.  There are plenty of tables and booths in the dining area and a full service bar.  The restaurant also features a regulation shuffleboard table and a pool table for those who wish to make a night of it.

Will I return?  Probably not, life's too short to eat mediocre barbeque.  Even if it's pimped by some dude in a pig costume."}
{"text":"We went here on a whim as my boyfriend saw they had a burnt ends special of the day and he could not resist. The hardest part about this place is getting there - you have to be in the right lane or go around the block - turning left into here is just not going to happen at lunch time. Plan your route accordingly to avoid unnecessary stress. 

The place is laid out nicely with a variety of seating options. We chose a picnic table near the window. Instantly a basket of mini corn bread muffins and butter were brought out to us - a very fun surprise! A waitress took our order and although they had $2 bottles of beer on special we decided to go the soda route. Lots of napkins were also brought out. Two types of sauce are on the table (regular and spicy). 

Our order of the burnt ends came out in no time. At $8.50 it included a huge portion, a choice of side, buttered toast points, and a cornbread muffin. I chose fries as my side - they reminded me a lot of steak 'n' shake fries if any else remembers those as well! The spicy sauce was not very spicy but they seem to have an endless assortment of sauces available if you ask - I should have asked! The meat was not exactly what I would associate with burnt ends but it was tasty all the same! 

Service was quick and friendly and prices are super reasonable. I wouldn't hesitate to go back here if the board lists a good special. Next time I'll ask for the sauce not on the table though!"}
{"text":"Solid joint.  The atmosphere is simple but fun.  Ribs were delicious with the hot bbq sauce.  Good price for beer.  Will totally return."}
{"text":"Used to go there often and the food was great then new ownership/management came in and everything went down hill from there. I don't know how this place stays open! The ribs were dried up and didn't taste right, the coleslaw and beans were crappy, couldn't even eat half of the meal. To makes matters even worse, mgt refused to honor a gift card that I purchased from \"todays deals\" for this place. The gift card was good till Sept 2015 and this was March 2015! Another customer bites the dust."}
{"text":"There's a lot of fake reviews on here from a former disgruntled employee, so here's mine a real customer. Wow! The food here is sooo awesome. The absolute best flavor, just the exact right amount of smoke, but the meat flavor really comes through, very juicy. 3 meat sampler + 1/4 slab rib add on lasted 2 lunches and dinners with sides. Fries were great a large pile, for $20. Has a bar. Didn't wait too long. Staff is super nice. Comedy club also in another room."}
