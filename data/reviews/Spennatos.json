{"text":"Incredibly horrible service! Have been here numerous times - always sitting at the bar. Ordered food to go tonight. I was told 25 min. When I arrived I waited 5 min at the bar w my card in hand. The bartender was frazzled (very small bar) and finally asked a waitress to help me and the waitress said \"no\". Waited a couple more min before bartender rang up my order. While I continued waiting for my food I watched the bartender eating something under the bar then putting away clean glasses w/o washing her hands!!!!
The pasta is good-hence the 2 stars.
Salads are below average and the servers, not only beyond slow, are rude. My 25 min order took 53 minutes.
Went to website to send an email giving an opportunity to offer an explanation or apology-no contact info. 
Terrible experience."}
{"text":"My sister works as a server at Spennatos, so I had to come and give it a try!  She recommended a small pizza for my mom and I to split, and let me tell you: one small is more than enough for two people!  Eight slices of Sicilian cheesy goodness!  The sauce was sweet and the crust was crispy!  I only wish I could have eaten more, but it was super filling.  (this could be due to the fact that we also had side salads and diet pop to go with.). 

The cook was sweet and came out to meet us, and treated us to tiramisu!  YUM!  I love tiramisu anyways, and this was no exception.  Very very good."}
{"text":"I wish my pizza experience was somewhere near the others that posted here. Seeing it nominated in the PD Pizza Contest made me give it a try. If you like horrendously dry pizza this is your place. At first I thought they forgot the sauce but there was red coloring underneath the cheese and toppings so somebody painted some on. We had to break open a jar of pizza sauce and dip the pizza in it so we didn't choke. 

The sausage was some type of shredded mass of greyish colored something devoid of flavor. The cheese I suppose they were saving for the other pizzas because it was hardly noticeable. The crust was a light and airy type. I prefer a dense, chewy foundation. Overall a highly disappointing pizza experience"}
{"text":"Great food! Great people! One of the best Pizza's I have ever eaten.
Peroni on tap! What else could you need?"}
{"text":"Two co-workers and I ordered our food 30 minutes ahead of time so it would be ready when we arrived since we were on our lunch hour.  We told them we were on our lunch hour and needed to back at work at 2pm, so that is why we ordered ahead.  We waited 15 minutes after our arrival and the food still wasn't ready.  We were told the kitchen was backed up and it would be another 15 minutes.  We told them that it was not acceptable because we made arrangements ahead of time and they knew it was our lunch hour.  

We asked for the manager and the owner sent another worker who came over.  She said that she wasn't a manager but the owner was too busy to see us.  We told her the situation and she said, \"What do you want us to do about it?\"  To which, my co-workers said, \"No, what is the owner going to do about it?\"  She came back and said that he would give us 50% off and box up our food.  We told her that we are not allowed to eat at our desks and now lost our entire lunch hour.  She could care less that we were going to leave.   We walked out and all had to get fast food and eat it on the way back to the office.

I can't believe that the owner was such a coward and didn't even try to make things right.  I've eaten there before too, but I will NEVER eat there again with the way that we were treated.  This is why businesses shut down, because they don't know how to treat customers.  Plus, their food is not cheap, so they should be thankful that they have any customers at all!"}
{"text":"If you re going to the casino this is the only place to eat.  Pizza is great, service is great, menu is great and the ambience is Awesome.  It is deceiving from the outside.  Go in and you will see.

We eat there once a month when  we go to gamble.

Awesome."}
{"text":"Spenattos is truly one of my favorite restaurants in the area. \"G\" the owner and head chef always makes sure your meal is prepared to your liking.  I especially love the Pasta Pescatori and would recommend it to anyone that likes a seafood pasta with a \"kick\".  The bar area is a nice place to sit and grab a drink with friends too!  Would heartily recommend this establishment!!"}
{"text":"So disappointed! We made a reservation over a week ago for our group of friends (8 total) to have dinner before a concert at the Rocksino. We should have known it wasn't a good sign when they didn't have our reservation when we called this afternoon to confirm. We were all slightly early for our 5:45 reservation time. We waited over 10 minutes for someone to take our drink order then she never came back. After another 15 minutes we asked if we could get our waitress to order because we wanted to enjoy our meal and be on time for our concert. We never saw our original waitress again but the new waitress assured us we would be fine on time to eat and leave by 7:10 so we gave her our orders. Note: The people that ordered a drink or beer got them after about 25 minutes but after waiting over 35 minutes my husband went up to the bar to get the rest of us our glasses of water. Needless to say our meals were no where in sight. The table behind us was also upset because they weren't getting their food either. Our table's meals came out in groups of 2 starting at 7:04. The last meals were brought out at 7:15. So basically we all had between -0 to 6 minutes to eat. My ravioli was lukewarm on the edges and cold in the center. And the pasta with shrimp had only 2 of the worlds most microscopic shrimp we had ever seen. As our friend said, \"they should be embarrassed to serve this\". No manager on duty and even the owner my husband spoke to blamed us by saying that we didn't get our meals because we didn't order until \"6:18\". He just ignored the fact that we couldn't get any service for the first 35 minutes and had to track down a waitress to practically beg someone to take our order (in addition to getting our own drinks at the bar). Waitress #2 said that you were short handed but we made a point of asking if it was going to be an issue getting our food in a timely manner because if it was we would have chosen to go somewhere else. We had mediocre service the last time we went there with a group of 6 and gave it another shot but we are now done. What was supposed to be a nice dinner with good friends was ruined."}
{"text":"Good food and service. The Lobster Bisque is great. Been here many times and always good."}
{"text":"Awesome food and service.  The Italian music was pleasing and at the right sound level.  Megan and other employees helpful and efficient.  We had four different dishes, assorted drinks including wine, and several servings of homemade bread.  Very pleasant experience...glad our daughter suggested it, and glad we have moved up here! :)"}
{"text":"Ordered a medium cheese pizza to go which was very good. Great crust, sauce and cheese - as close to NY pizza as I've come across since moving here."}
{"text":"for some reason this place always looks crowded from the road, i dont understand why.  i went once & was not slightly impressed with the ambiance or food.  i decided to give it another try because it always looks crowded, i thought maybe i went on an off night & would try again.  after two tries, i will not go back.  food was bland, nothing special at all.  the house salad dressing was horrible."}
{"text":"not worth the money. worst pizza in the bedford, northfield area. rude staff and messed up my order twice. they need to hire competent staff"}
{"text":"Very good food, great service and always enjoyable to say hello to the owner, G when he comes out of the kitchen to visit patrons in the dining room."}
{"text":"Sad...very sad indeed.  Maybe one of the worst restaurant experiences I have had in a long time. It took 20 mins just to get water...which one of our party got up and got for us!!  Drinks took forever and forget a second round. The ladies went to the bar to get their own glasses of wine!  When the food finally arrived after and hour and a half it was cold or average at best. My dish was a joke. The owner should be embarrassed to even serve it. Seafood? See the picture of the \"huge\" shrimp (I found 3 in my dish and needed glasses to find them'). Won't ever be back and recommend you save your time and money and go somewhere else...anywhere else!"}
{"text":"I take back what I said about their regular NY style pizza, it has gotten way better and is damn decent for Ohio which is a freaking pizza black hole.   They do a decent thin crust and we order from here regularly now... and they deliver!"}
{"text":"Great food, large portions, surprisingly good prices and right down the street from the Rocksino.

We found Spennatos while looking for a meal before a comedy show at the Rocksino and were not disappointed. On the outside Spennatos looks like another strip mall box restaurant, but on the inside you get the homey, authentic Italian vibe that makes you feel like you are eating a family meal. While waiting for your food, check out all the photos and decor on the walls for a nostalgia trip.

When you open a drink or food menu, the first thing you notice are the reasonable prices and the large amount of options. They have a solid offering of wine, beer and even bourbon on the drink menu. The food menu has all the appetizers, entres, pastas and pizza you could ask for. They are well known for their pizza, which comes in NY style, Siccilian style or even stuffed. 

To start out, we opted for a bottle of red blend called ravage that was dark and delicious. For an appetizer, we almost got the brushetta but at the last second saw they have a pepperoni roll on the pizza menu and went with that instead. The small pizza roll was more than enough for two. It was crispy on the outside and warm, gooey, cheesy on the inside with the spicy pepperoni to put it over the top.

For entres my wife ordered the chicken parmesan with cavetelli noodles and I went with the cheese ravioli, both with marinara instead of meat sauce. The sauce is above average and the chicken is exactly what you want in a chicken parm dish. Slightly crispy, well seasoned, cooked to perfection and full of flavor. The same goes for the cheese raviolis. Large cheese medallions stuffed with deliciousness. Both the raviolis and cavetelli were al dente.  The best part of the entres? The come with salad included, which seems to becoming rarer and rarer these days. I highly recommend the house Italian because it is an oil based sauce with a lot of pepper that has an extra kick I am looking for.

When the bill came inwas pleasantly surprised. Overall, the food is better than your Italian chain places and less than their price as well. The place makes you feel like you are in a family restaurant and even though the staff was understaffed due to traffic, I didn't notice anything negative at all."}
{"text":"First let me say the strip mall look doesn't do the food justice.  If you have never been here, then you may not even realize it is a very good Italian Restaurant.  

I had the Eggplant Parmigiana with spaghetti, which came with a house salad and fresh rolls (bread).  

The inside is a little different even, you walk in and the bar is to the right and the main seating is to the left.  High back bench seating.  Per the info at the table they even have a large area for groups.

Now why the 4 stars if I liked it so much.  Well the portion size is for a family or at least 2 very hungry people.  I was only able to eat maybe a 3rd of my meal after the salad and 2 rolls.

So I ended up ordering tiramisu to go for dessert (I love a good dessert) and was told they don't make them in house but a lady that lives nearby is their pastry chef.  Ummm the Tiramisu is just as good as the food if not better. 

Just make sure to share your meal or be very hungry or plan to take some home for tomorrow."}
{"text":"If I could give it no stars, I would. This place was pretty awful. The service wasn't very good. It was a Saturday night and it wasn't very busy at all. I ordered the Pasta Carbonara. Now your standard carbonara consists of noodles (the type varies), bacon, egg, and a Parmesan/creamy sauce, and sometimes, peas. On their menu it's described as \"a creamy bacon sauce with scrambled egg and Parmesan.\" 
I wish I would have taken a photo of the dish I received. What I got was a heaping pile of scrambled eggs, with some noodles and nearly raw bacon. 

It was beyond terrible. I took 2 bites and tried to stomach it. At this point I was so annoyed with the lack of attention from our server that I didn't bother to complain. She should have seen how awful it looked when she brought it out. But she just threw it down, walked away and never came back to ask us how everything was tasting. So at the end when she finally made an appearance to collect our plates, she says \"oh you don't want to take it home with you?\" Instead of asking if something was wrong with it. 

Overall I was very disappointed with this place. 
At least the soda tasted ok..."}
{"text":"Great Capri sauce.  Awesome service.  Will definitely be back.  Ordered Pasta Capri for myself and hubby got the meatball sub with fries.  Very generous portions priced right."}
{"text":"This was my first visit and I must say that I was pretty happy with their pizza.  My in-laws live practically across the street from this place, there aren't too many other choices around here.  We ordered the Sicilian pizza with pepperoni, mushrooms, and peppers.  The crust was perfectly buttery and the sauce was slightly sweet.   Although, it did take half an hour for the pizza, the Peroni on tap made up for the wait."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic! Generous servings. Great variety. Tastes wonderful. Fabulous service. The marinara sauce is amazing. The oliveta veal was delicious. I would definitely recommend this ristaurante."}
{"text":"Good pizza. Good pasta. Nice Italian family runs it. You'll see G having a drink with a customer. Best place on northfield rd for Italian."}
{"text":"Best lasagna ever! Portion size is great so we got to enjoy it for breakfast. Salad was fantastic too. Fettuccine alfredo was horrible, sadly, because, it's my favorite thing to order when I go out. I've had the eggplant parmesan in the past and it was amazing."}
{"text":"Whenever I travel, I try to avoid chains and try new things. That doesn't always go over well with my four kids, since chicken nuggets are their own food group. But when it comes to pizza, I can usually get away with it, and while staying in Macedonia overnight, we ordered carry out pizza from Spennatos. We ordered a large cheese and a chicken Philly stuffed crust pizza. Before we even opened the boxed, the smells were awesome, and both really tasted good. The cheese was thin, but not too thin NY style and my kids ate it, which means I didn't waste my money. The stuffed crust required a fork and it was literally stuffed. So if you're planning a trip to the east side of Cuyahoga Valley National Park, look this place up. It's worth the stop."}
{"text":"After coming here approximately once a month for the past 3 years, one would expect the bar tender to at least great us with a simple \"hi how are you guys?\". But we get it, not everyone is a people person, and the food has always been fine (not amazing, generic Italian but close to home and easy (except take out...never order the food from here as take out)

Most recently we came in for a quick dinner. We were served severely bitter very likely expired chicken. We were assured \"oh yeah it's for sure chicken it's fine\". Neither of us could stomach a second bite.  I am presently ill from it, which is how I have time to write such a lengthy review. 

Our \"friend\" the bartender still charged us for cleaning the expired chicken out of the back of their freezer. he didn't so much as comp a glass of wine or ap.

This establishment does not value customer service or quality. If you want to gamble with your GI system, go right ahead. But I would advise not. We certainly will never be returning."}
{"text":"So, so good!! Easily the best white pizza I've ever had. The crust was crisp and the cheese was Perfectly melted. The house salad was also the perfect pizza salad. I can't believe I've never been here- its easily better than Geracis which was my fave prior to today! Go soon!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what has happened to this once quaint little restaurant but the service is poor and the food is no longer good. I ordered the chicken piccata which was served white and flour slimy (the chicken was not browned). Yuk, won't be going back."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza the medium was quite large and delish Anthony at the bar was great and very good at his job five stars"}
{"text":"Slow... Slow.... Slow.  Came in with reservations at 5:45 on a Sunday evening and didn't get food until 7:15.  Very disorganized and seemed understaffed. Unfortunately it was like this last time we were here for dinner about 4 months ago. Too bad because food is tasty - when you eventually get it. But won't come back here again after giving it several tries. Multiple bad experiences with slow service."}
{"text":"This is a great little Italian place! I came here with a few friends who are close with the owner and family. We got a seat at the bar right about 5 pm.

The service was very friendly, though they did know our friends so I can't be sure that it guarantee (I'd like to think so!). We had a few beers, and I got some things to go and eat at home with the family. I got house salad with their house dressing. Very good! A bit of a spice to it, which we love. The lobster alfredo was amazing; succulent and rich. They did a half order for me which was more than enough! And finally their calzone with onions, and meatballs. SO GOOD! The small was HUGE! We had leftovers even with splitting everything. All of that, and my three beers and I still walked out of there under $30. Great, great value! A new favorite!"}
{"text":"2nd visit - food & service were great. We made a last minute reservation and our table was ready when we arrived, both times.
They have outdoor seating; we can't wait to see what that's all about~
Portion size = huge"}
{"text":"Best (adult) pizza in the area.  Awesome thin crispy crust.  White pizza here is really something special (I order mine with bacon, chicken and broccoli).  Solid menu of good pasta dishes."}
{"text":"Just ordered delivery for the first time. Chic piccata was awesome!  Could use some more noodles but the flavor and sauce was outstanding!"}
{"text":"Great food! I have never had a bad meal there. I love their house salad dressing, it had a lot of pepper so it does have a kick. 
Great place to take a child also. 
Weekends are really busy. We tend to only go early week nights."}
{"text":"I meet friends for lunch occasionally and have always had great meals and good service. The Rosettes are really good and the sauce is so yummy!! I love the house dressing too, a little spicey and very good."}
{"text":"Omg! This is amazing pizza. It brings back many memories of Scotto's pizza in the Richmond mall. Love it!"}
{"text":"Sweet Jesus! This was amazing. I don't eat much pizza but always like to try and find decent Lobster ravioli where I can. FOUND IT!!!

Get it with the lobster shrimp sauce. It's sooooo goooood. 

Not only was the food delicious, but the amazing woman that answered the phone and took my order was great. She had no problems bringing it out to me in my truck since I am a truck driver, and even added extra silverware because she knew I probably wouldn't have any. When she got here to deliver it she was just great, friendly and all around a great person. Can't say enough about her. I assume she was the owner of the place by her splendid customer service and attitude. 

But back to the food. Chunks, yea. CHUNKS of lobster in the ravioli and there were like four or five LARGE raviolis. I didn't count. After the first bite it was game on lol. The sauce was creamy and so good I used the rolls she brought as lobster sauce sponges lol. They were a little hard but the sauce was so damn good, who gives a shit. 

I hope I come back here soon. I will order some to take home and pretend I made it myself to my family and friends."}
{"text":"First and probably only visit. There were only 2 other customers when I arrived at 4 pm. The salad and Italian bread came out quickly. The bread was delicious and the salad was tasty though unremarkable. The meat ravioli was warm, not hot. The meat sauce was also warm, not hot, and it was very bitter with way too much meat, more like a ragu than a sauce. The waitress never returned to my table after delivering the food. I had to ask the hostess to find her 20 minutes after I finished eating just so I could get my check. She said she got sidetracked. I left a 10 percent tip, which was generous all things considered. It wasn't an awful experience, just completely underwhelming when there are tons of restaurants from which to choose. Oh, and it's also tchotchke heaven--I could hear Gorden Ramsey saying \"bloody hell\" in response to the decor."}
{"text":"Sterling did a great job. 
We had great food for grandmas birthday. 
Canollis we fantastic."}
{"text":"Absolutely delightful!!!! Food is amazing! Prices are really reasonable and the service was pretty great too.  We found this place on our way home and now will definitely make this a destination place to eat!"}
{"text":"Casual, family owned Italian restaurant. Probably the best in the neighborhood. The place reminded me visiting old friend: warm and welcoming. 
I met my girlfriend here as we wanted to chat. We did not eat much just soups and pasta. I was satisfied with my Italian wedding soup. However, my girlfriend refused to eat lobster bisque soup because of the amount of the salt. The waitress was nice and friendly and exchanged the soup for the pasta. 
We were pleased of our experience. Probably, I need to come back and check other items menu such as stuffed eggplants, pizzas and other."}
{"text":"I've been to Spennatos on 3 separate occasions, primarily because my parents live close by and don't like to wander outside of their comfort zones too often.

During each visit, we've had awfully slow service. On two of the occasions, we actually had to ask for a menu, drinks and a waitress! When the snot nosed teenage girl finally waited on us, it seemed like we were bothering her as she rolled her eyes and smacked her lips at my Mom when she asked her a simple question about a menu item or  asked for a drink refill.

The food is decent. Nothing special really.  If you don't live nearby, it's certainly not worth the drive. And don't even think about going here during your lunch break as you'll never get back during a normal lunch hour. Both the waitress staff and the amount of time it takes for your meal to be cooked is ridiculous. I suggest they hire more help before I go back."}
{"text":"The best Italian bread anywhere! 

Unfortunately the decor is tacky and the whole place (including the bathroom) is cluttered by it. Also, there was no music- none at all. Kitchen cooking noises and the conversation at the next table were the only sounds. Not even the TV over the bar had sound.  

Good food but poor ambiance makes this a mediocre dining experience."}
{"text":"Terribly slow service for ordering, receiving the food, getting condiments, getting the bill...literally everything.  As well, I ordered a medium-well burger and got a piece of charcoal instead."}
{"text":"One of the best Italian places in NE Ohio!!  My GF and I have gone twice and no complaints. The service is nice, prompt and friendly. Fresh bread and butter from their oven; great selections and clean. I highly recommend this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night restaurant was very busy - not enough parking - has a reservation and were seated right away
Service was slow and not exactly friendly 
Bread was good 3 of us really liked our meals 2 really did not so I decided on 3 stars was thinking 2 1/2 sounded right. Chicken parm was really disappointing would have been better off with pizza -   Bolanase sauce was very good - meat ravioli just ok."}
{"text":"We decided to check this restaurant out on our way to a comedy show at the rocksino.  Our server was fantastic, very attentive and personable.  We ordered the calamari, the dipping sauce was very fishy.  Would not order this again.  My husband had veal Marsala and I had the lobster ravioli.  Our dinners were great.  Our regret was we didn't have enough time to try the dessert!"}
{"text":"Food-stuffed pizza-horrible, Service-rude.  We should have walked out when my husband was treated rudely by what we assume was the manager when he arrived.  While some items at our table were good, my husband ordered the stuffed Philly cheesesteak pizza. This was perhaps the worst \"pizza\" we have ever tried to eat. It had no flavor, very little meat, canned mushrooms and the worst part-red sauce on a Philly cheesesteak!  When we told the \"manager\" that it was not good and we were surprised it had red sauce she agreed and just walked away.  Absolutely no customer service at all!  Don't order this item ever!"}
{"text":"My burger was burnt and over cooked.  I asked for meduim and the patty was well done. I had the calamari and it was delicious.  Other than the calamari the food was poor quality and over priced."}
{"text":"This place is ok - nothing REALLY good or bad. They do have a wide variety on the menu. Place is kinda hard to get in & out of - small/tight parking. The couple of times we went, the service was just ok - but there's some weird vibe we got - like this is a front operation for something else going on in the back...??"}
{"text":"We had my son's first birthday in the party room and was blown away with the beautifully set up tables and decor. The food was excellent.  The pizza was delicious and perfectly cooked. The pasta was tender and not overdone. Everything was very reasonably priced for the amount of food and the quality of service provided. The room reservation was included with the food purchase as well as room set up and clean up. 
Overall, it was great food, great environment, and great service."}
{"text":"I came here before awhile ago and it was a decent little bistro but i cane here yesterday and the food was great bison burger was cooked very well . Im a chef so im familar with it being semi difficult to cook bison as its a tougher dryer meat even when cut with hamburger( which this was) but it was cery juicy . My girlfriend got the Philly and it was huge not only that it was very good , fresh made frys from whole potatoes i highly enjoyed the food.

Will be back again defiantly!"}
{"text":"Close to Rocksino, takes reservations.  Service a little slow. Prices good. My rigatoni and meatballs were excellent but three people ordered chicken Parmesan and two of the meals were a little burnt.  Also wedding soup is odd. No greens, just noodles and little meatballs. Never seen that before. It was ok."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. We have been coming here for years.  If you want good food, good conversation, and good drinks this is the place."}
{"text":"Went with the girlfriend and service was great! Food was very delicious. It's hidden away so make sure you pay close attention when trying to find it!!!"}
{"text":"I was recently looking for a quiet place to hold my fathers 90 birthday party and knew my dad liked to eat at Spennato's. Knowing we would have about 20 attending My sister called about a month in advance. Mary stated they had a back room that would accommodate our group. With a $100 deposit, she provided us with menu options. We decided on a buffet with salad, pasta, chicken, meatballs and choice of drink. Cash bar was an option for those who wished to do so. 

That day everything went as planned. Food was excellent and ready about 15 minutes after we arrived. The waitress serving us was very polite and took care of all our needs and even assisted with the birthday cake we brought in. When all was completed she brought out take out containers for all to take home any remaining food. Everyone took a little. 

I highly recommend Spennato's for such an event. When all was said and done we were charged $20 a plate with all taxes, gratuities, and room use. Excellent day all around."}
{"text":"Slow service, bland and greasy food, and stale decor."}
{"text":"If you look up Italian restaurant in the dictionary there should be a picture of this wonderful place. Very close to the Rocksino. It is a small family type of place that would also be great for a first date or a romantic dinner. They have a nice, spicey house dressing. Wine list is small, but adequate and reasonably priced. All the pasta dishes our group tried were excellent. One of the best spaghetti and meatballs I have had."}
