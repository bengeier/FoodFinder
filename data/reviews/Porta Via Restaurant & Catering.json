{"text":"AMAZING. Had the bowl with kale and quinoa base, corn peppers avocado black beans and Pico de gallo, chicken and basil citrus dressing. I DEVOURED IT AND WANT MORE."}
{"text":"The grilled veggie trio is my favourite. The mixture of veggies and goat cheese, wow! The best soup that I have tried there is the beet soup.. Soo good. Yummy!"}
{"text":"I was blown away by this place.  Unreal.  Since my first time going I've made an effort to go back as much as possible even though I live on the other side of the city.  I now find myself looking for an excuse to have a meeting in Mississauga or Etobicoke just so I can come here for lunch.  The paninis are out of this world.  Tuna is to die for. Salmon is unreal. The marinated beef just melts in your mouth.  Not to mention the home made puree soups. Wow.  For about $12 you get an amazing panini, soup and drink.  Hands down there is no better place for lunch.  It is amazingly healthy and I leave feeling completely satisfied.. not too full and not hungry.  The staff is amazing and even though the line up is often out the door the wait is never long.  I would highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the west end and is looking for a great lunch.  I will be a customer for life. 5 Stars all the way.  AMAZING."}
{"text":"Honestly the best spot for a high quality sandwich or salad.  Everything is fresh from the meats, vegetables and the breads.  It's really as good as it gets. It's more expensive than Subway but you really can't begin to compare the offering of Porta Via to any other fast food sandwich shop.    The staff are friendly and helpful.  The line moves very quickly.  I have been coming here for months and can't get enough.    Keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"Love this place. It's a quick place for lunch. Lunch time is busy but the assemble line is quite quick. The lunch set comes with soup or salad of your choice. Great selection of the sandwiches. If you feel like just salad, there is a variety of salads in the fridge once you come into the store.  Food is great and fresh!   Once you pick up your lunch, there is seating inside the store (16 people capacity) or a patio (6 people capacity) outside"}
{"text":"I go there at least once a week,  it's great food,  clean, tasty, affordable and friendly environment,  it's a hidden spot,  but you gotta try their Tuscan chicken."}
{"text":"Went here with a buddy of mine at lunch during work hours and I must say, pretty good stuff! Love their turkey sandwich with salad!"}
{"text":"I actually couldn't be more please right now! Discovering Porta via has definitely made my whole day. To be quite honest, I'm feeling a little giddy about it.  There are about 20 different sandwiches on the menu, all of which are full of fresh, colourful, flavourful, quality ingredients. The salads are just brilliant and the soups (we tried both) were awesome!  The place is set up a little like subway or quiznos, except cleaner, classier and way WAY better tasting!   After you pick your sandwich and your bread off the menu one of the 'sandwich artists' whips it up behind the glass counter and puts it in a panini press. A minute later you have a fresh warm sandwich, hot delicious soup and a salad...all for $10. They also had samples of the other soup.   There's a small shady patio with four tables outside and a couple rows of clean white tables inside. The Tuscan Chicken sandwich was amazing as was the Tomato and Chickpea Soup. The Brie and Beef sandwich was good too but given the choice between the two go definitely with the Tuscan sandwich.  I am already scheming a way to get back to the area for another lunch. Porta Via, ladies and gentlemen, is lunch time perfection!!"}
{"text":"Food is definitely delicious and high quality. However, don't buy the \"healthy\" claims as its pretty greasy and rich. If you're looking for delicious comfort food, this is great- but don't go if you're trying to watch what you eat."}
{"text":"A new lunch place a friend took me to.  I'm sad that my experience wasn't as great as two of my fav reviewers (laura c. and madelaine d.).  I don't contest that the food shoudn't be great, it definitely looked it.  And i don't contest that the mix of ingredients looked too good to be true.  Seriously, Spicy Moroccan Butternut Squash with Pineapple soup...it sounds like an orgasm waiting to happen.  But unfortunately, it wasn't meant to be.  I had the havarti chicken and the failed orgasm soup mentioned above and it wasn't anything special.  I think what really soured me to it (though it was my first time so I still gave it 3 stars), was the fact that the sandwich \"artist\" and I seemed to miscommunicate...a lot.  Everything I said, had to be repeated, where the artist seemed to get what i said, but then 20-30 seconds later question what I had asked for.  Ok, I can chalk it up to being behind the counter and maybe my voice wasn't carrying as well as the guy in front of me or the girl behind me.  But what killed the meal for me was that everyone else got their sandwiches grilled from what I can tell (without asking).  Even though I told them that I'd be staying to eat, they packed up the meal.  I didn't think anything of it until i sat down and opened the box to find a cold sandwich.  Not as good being cold, imho, but then, I haven't tried a heated one.  Maybe I look like a cold sandwich kinda guy :(  And the soup.  What a downer...I don't even know how to explain my failed expectations but I'll try (insert painful childhood memory).  It's like.....when you go to a sesame street show as a kid, and your favourite character is Elmo and after the show you try to rush backstage to meet him, but when you get there you see elmo ripping his own head off....and there is some guys head there....and all you can think is...elmo ate someone's head, and ripped off his own.  Yes, that traumatizing and disappointing!  I'll definitely try this place again and will make sure to ask for grilled this time.  And maybe I'll stick to the salads."}
{"text":"Nice and clean establishment with amazing, AMAZING Paninis. Get the tuscan chicken on a hearty piece of bread and you will be amazed and shocked at how good this panini tastes. The chicken is an actual piece of breast, not mechanically separated and injection molded and painted like something you'd find from subway. The goat cheese is fantastic and complements the red pepper pesto they spread on both sides of bread. Served with either the soup of the day or salad, it's a big win in my book. The salad is just your regular mixed greens with carrots and a simple balsamic/vinegar dressing and honestly, that's the only way to eat salad.   I work downtown now and haven't been to porta via in a while, but I hope to return soon!"}
{"text":"This hidden little spot is a great place for fresh gourmet panani's in the area for lunch.  Fresh breads, gourmet toppings and a good selection of sandwiches. Smoked salmon, veal, chicken, beef, you have a number of choices and I've never had a bad sandwich here.   They have a variety of white and multigrain breads which you can choose from, and are all fresh.   The soup here is also really good. They usually have two flavors, and the soup is thick and tasty.   It'll going to cost you $9-11 depending on the sandwich. Portions are not especially large, your standard sandwich size.  It's a small place so it gets a bit busy and seating is limited, and it's a bit pricey (considering a footlong sub can be had for $6, but you're paying for quality here), but otherwise, a place I like going to once in a while for a healthy, fresh lunch."}
{"text":"Got take out today and I just have to tell everyone how awesome the Smoked Salmon, with artichoke aioli, grilled zucchini and havarti. Who came up with this? Must be a genius.   Soups today was Spicy Moroccan Butternut Squash with Pineapple, or Vegan Tomato and Sweet Potato Puree. Aren't you drooling now?  Sandwich, Soup and a large coffee cost me $12. I love this place."}
{"text":"Very fast efficient service and right next to our office. Fresh food and lots of healthy choices."}
{"text":"If you like fresh non-processed food go here - it's great. A downtown type eatery oasis that you would expect to find in 1st Canadian Place located in a nondescript mundane suburban office plaza. I don't know how it ended up here but my waistline and palette is so so happy it did.   PS Order the hot sauce for any sandwich - it's really good."}
{"text":"I ordered the spicy striploin and salsa verde sandwich from here last week via Uber eats and it was so delicious. The ingredients were fresh and the flavours were amazing. I did sub out the Brie for mozzarella and they did that for me, no problem. As good as this was after a bit of a transit time I am itching to go in there and having an item or two fresh."}
{"text":"Limited seating and pretty straight forward lunch set up,  you line up for sandwiches or salads and meet in the middle for hot beverages and soup before paying. Make sure to grab your cold drinks and salad base before you get in line. The ingredients are on the side walls,  you can pick 5 to compliment your salad with house made dressing.   The toppings are what gets me excited: it was difficult for me to just pick 5!  Pickled artichokes,  chick peas, avocados, portobello mushrooms, asparagus, 5 different cheeses!  I didn't even need protein lol  They have about 10 different dressings to choose from,  I had the caper and olive tapenade * drool  Kale and spring salad is available! Good portions of leaves and toppings!   The house made soup was also worth the extra $2 with the salad. They always have a roasted tomato and their soup special today was roasted squash,  I couldn't decide so the cashier ley me try both before I picked the squash.   It was really loud but it fits the cafeteria style set up. I'd go back to try their grilled vegetable panini!  **** Haha that was quick lol I went back to try their fired up vegan \"grilled veggie and avocado spread panini\" with their hot sauce... The lovely server put potbelly mushrooms in for me just cause I asked. Wish I worked closer to here and also they had more seating!"}
{"text":"Came here with the bae for a quick late lunch.  Was very impressed. Super clean store, friendly staff, and fresh quality ingredients.  I wasn't starving so we ordered the \"trio\" combo to share, which consists of a sandwich, salad, and soup. The beef panini with smoked mozzarella and roasted red peppers which was very delicious. Soup was a vegan tomato, nicely spiced and smooth, very warming. Really loved the fresh spring salad dressed lightly with house made balsamic dressing.  Would absolutely return here for a reasonably priced and healthy meal."}
{"text":"Huge Fan of these delic sandwiches and their custom salads. I work around the corner so I'm there often.   Their panini's are to die for...with an excellent selection of suggested sandwich combos or they will custom make you one. The Tuscan Chicken is for sure a popular and fav but I do love the Prosciutto with Brie and grilled eggplant. They are pricey about $9 and it comes with soup or salad. Their chickpea soup is really good and highly recommend it.   The salad bar is unique too as they have so many different items to top your salad with that you wouldn't find at your regular salad bar. Everything from avocado, sun dried tomatoes, edamane, different cheeses, nuts (almonds, pecans) grilled veggies...and of course protein like chicken or egg. Salads run in the same price range as well.   Great choice for lunch and I'm there probably once a week!"}
{"text":"Best soup and sandwiches (panini) I've ever eaten.  My fave is the Tuscan Chicken on focaccia bread, although any sandwich is a tasty gourmet delight.  Everything is fresh and the chicken and beef are juicy, not dry.  I haven't had the salad but it looks fresh.  They have 2 choices of soup each day (types change sometimes) and you won't be disappointed.  I usually get the roasted tomato and chickpea puree.  Seating is limited and it's best to arrive before noon.  I've seen line ups out the door.  Soup, sandwich and a drink will be about $11.  They're only open on weekdays and until 4pm.  If you're not in the area it's worth changing jobs so you can pickup lunch from Porta Via. :-)"}
{"text":"When you think of soup and a sandwich you usually instantly think of coffee shops, subway, or grocery stores. I mean there aren't that many places to get a nice gourmet sandwich out there; and yes, subway gourmet sandwiches are quite far away from gourmet.   Portal Via is hidden inside a small business plaza and delivers a Italian inspired menu with a variety of soups, sandwiches and salads.  For somewhere close to 10 dollars you can get your choice of sandwich and a soup or salad next to it. This also is the case for a salad if you so choose.    When you first step into the store, you will notice a very urban decor filled with black-brown furniture, clean and elegant wooden chairs and enough right angled corners to ponder how perpendicular everything is.  Defiantly a nice classy place to have a quiet lunch with a co-worker. No patio though. That sucks.   The variety of sandwiches isn't mind blasting, but it isn't a joke either. On your menu is your usual choices of bird, cow or fish with an assortment of sauces and spreads to mix things up a bit. I actually found the variety of spreads very appealing with choices including sun dried tomato pesto, avocado mayo and a chipotle jalapeno spread. Add in fresh grilled vegetables like zucchini, eggplant and a wide assortment of breads and you got yourself a sandwich worthy of taking a picture of (sorry I devoured mine before I could take a picture... It never had a chance). As for the breads, instead of having your basic white, brown or Parmesan, they mix it up with actual different breads like foccacia, chiabatta or Swiss triangles  The soups are different everyday, once I had a red curry soup that was delicious but today I tried the salad.   Now here's the reason I didn't give this place a 5/5. The salads are just that. I'll give it to them for using fresh ingredients but I don't see the same creativity in their salads as I do their sandwiches. Basically it's an Italian mixed greens mix with your choice of toppings and a variety of sauces. I'd like to see some more creative salad lunch-entree (yes I just made up that word) salads like chicken almondines,  Asian inspired chicken salads or others.   All in all I would highly suggest this place for a quiet lunch. Best way to describe this place in a nutshell... Classy Italian deli plus IKEA."}
{"text":"So do you work in the area? Do you work at Bell or one of the other many head offices of big companies in the area? Want a salad or something like that?   This is essentially the place. From someone who's worked downtown and in the burbs this feels like one of the many places like that in the PATH downtown. It is a build your own soup and salad place and they'll be more than happy to take your $10 - $15 for it.   Is it good? Sure. The best? Probably not but it's an option. They have a lot fresh items so it has that going for it. Most of their items are \"healthy\" so you can rest assured that you're making a good decision. Be wary though all of the toppings cost extra for the salad so pick the ones you really want.   The atmosphere feels nice, with good decor and table arrangements. The utensils are also pretty good for disposables."}
{"text":"There are some pretty fantastic panini's/sandwiches here and the prices are extremely reasonable. For a boxed lunch of a sandwich and salad you looking at around $9.00 depending on the 'wich. My company usually orders in from Porta Via but today I had the opportunity of picking up lunch for a few coworkers and getting the full Porta Via experience.   The restaurant is modern and sleek with just a slight air of sophistication which pairs well with their gourmet sandwiches. The staff were very friendly and polite and my order was waiting for me when I arrived. I had called ahead and they told me 15 minutes, but when I arrived 7 minutes later the order was ready.   Today I had the sirloin sandwich. With its sliced meat, cheese, and caramelized onions, I was in heaven. The side salad was pretty straight forward with a composition of mixed greens, but the vinaigrette dressing is what upped the ante.   Check this place out. Its location doesn't appeal tot he average person; neither its hours of M-F 8am to 4pm; but if you work in the area its a great place for lunch."}
{"text":"Great places for a quick and tasty lunch!  I came here after seeing my collegues always getting great looking sandwiches from this restaurant. I ordered the smoked salmon wrap and it was out of this world! The wrap had fresh ingredients and a generous portion of smoked salmon and brie cheese (my fav!).  The wrap also came with a soup or salad.  I went with their daily soup and it flavourful to say the least.  The restaurant gets really busy during lunch so I think it's better to come slightly before 12 or after 12:30 to skip the line.  I will definitely come back here the next time I forget to bring a lunch."}
{"text":"My co-worker and I stopped at this place to grab some lunch. Food: I ordered Tuscan Chicken and Vegetarian Soup. Quick sandwich with Gourmet quality.  Only critic is that seating area is very small, So we were forced to get a take out.  Will visit this place again."}
{"text":"Great soup, sandwich was good, steak was kinda tough but tasty, pleasant staff . A tad expensive not terrible."}
{"text":"Freshness, taste and complete meal for an affordable price!!! Thats how I would precisely define Porta Via.  Located @Eglinton, near my work place, this pal e offers a varied salads and sandwich selection with some daily soups. They do have veggie sandwich, but just on choice.   They have both dine in ( patio) and take out. I usually take out.  Their rosemary bread is delicious on which I have grilled veggie, goat cheese and avocado sandwich.  I love their tomato soup.  For salads, its easy : pick up a box of greens from the rack, take it to the counter, choose 5 toppings and a dressing. For an extra topping it is 1$ each.  The go to packing and cutlery is perfect."}
{"text":"Perfect lunch bite. Porta Via offers a variety of healthy sandwiches and soups that are made on the spot. I've tried their Tuscan Chicken and Picante Chicken - both very good. I recommend pairing with a daily soup (instead of salad) as they are excellent. Soups are thicker (not watered down) and full of flavour.  This location is tucked on the side of a office plaza. There isn't much space inside to this lunch option is more suited for take out."}
{"text":"Place is kind of hidden and hard to find.   Decent place for soup and sandwich. Nothing too special.  Service is great and food is okay."}
{"text":"We tried this for the first time. Been on my list for a while. My wife and daughter shard a salad which was okay but nothing special. I had the soup and panini. I had the Portobello soup which I did not enjoy. The panini however was good. All in all I will give it another try to see if my opinion changes."}
{"text":"Tucked away in a small commercial office area is a the gem of a restaurant called Porta Via. I've been in the area for about a year now and had no idea it even existed. Parking is scarce nearby so you may have to drive around the parking lot to find a spot.   There was a long lineup at the restaurant however service is very quick and friendly. Sandwiches or wraps come with a soup or salad on the side, so a filling meal is easy to have.   I set my eyes on the Tuscan Chicken panini which consisted of sundried tomato paste, grilled chicken, grilled sweet peppers, and lastly goat cheese.   The combination of these ingredients was simply incredible. Every bite was bittersweet with the experience of the panini leaving me amazed but upset knowing I was one bite closer to finishing my panini.   For my side I went with the vegan tomato basil soup that was the perfect thickness. It was creamy and full of flavour and formed the perfect combo with the panini.   The menu consists of many different options of deli meats, chicken, beef and vegetarian options.   I cannot wait to discover the rest of the menu and recommend trying Porta Via for lunch whenever in the area!"}
{"text":"This place is my addiction - my colleagues and I go atleast once a week. The best sandwich is the Tuscan chicken but they are all amazing.  Make sure to try their unique soups!!  Staff is friendly and food is prepped quickly."}
{"text":"A healthy option and nice place to come for lunch. They provide fresh toppings for you to create your own salad. You can choose romaine, kale or spring mix for your base and you select protein amd extras to go on top. Theu also have daily soups.   The also make paninis with fresh bread. I ordered a chicken and goat cheese paninis on olive bread. It was sooo fresh!!! This place is packed around lunch time and closes early around 3pm."}
{"text":"What a great fresh and delicious lunch option. I cannot stress how amazing the picante chicken sandwich is. It's made with roasted garlic hummus, grilled chicken, grilled banana peppers & smoked mozza - That's ALL!  I accompany my sandwiches with the salad (again, fresh, delicious and colourful- a bonus for salads).  The location is close to my work which is great for when we don't have time to pack a lunch or if a group of us want a delicious group lunch.  The place itself is simple, clean and very welcoming.  The price point is reasonable for the quality of food and the portion size.   I wish they had smaller or half sandwich options because it can sometimes be very filling.  I will keep on returning :) love it."}
{"text":"Best little sandwich shop in Mississauga hands down. Let me preface this with the fact that if you work in Mississauga, your food options for lunch are pretty limited - so I'm not telling you King Street yuppies to make the trek here for some paninis, but if you're around the area, then this would make for a pretty darn good lunch.  Porta is so much better than Panera in terms of the quality of food you're getting for around the same price. Sandwiches and salads are assembled in front of you. If it's your first time here, salads are ordered on your left near where the drinks are displayed, and sandwiches are assembled on the far right side. The cash register is in the middle of these two.   It's pretty crowded during lunch hours but they work quick so there's never a long wait for food. There's not much seating inside so grab & head back to the office to eat. They have extra outdoor seating though when it's warm out! This place is located within a lot of small businesses that strangely looked like retirement homes to me.  I've been here countless times for lunch and so have the bulk of my co-workers. I usually get a different sandwich each time and it's always amazing, and I always pair it with their vegan tomato soup. Try out anything on the menu, it'll be the best lunch bite you've had in Sauga!"}
