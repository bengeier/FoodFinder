{"text":"Amazing food.
Salad.  Fried calamari.  Grilled lambchops.
Hot Loukoumades for desert

Only complaint: lamb chops were salty.  Next time ask for no salt.

Overall will co.e back again."}
{"text":"Très bonne cuisine Grecque, des plats savoureux et le serveur Nico très gentil.  On va revenir!"}
{"text":"I have been to a lot of Greek restaurants being Greek myself , never have I been served octopus cut into small tiny pieces! First of all the octopus was overdone ! As for there salads , never have I seen lettuce cut like coleslaw ! The salad was drenched with oil ! There are a lot better Greek restaurants!"}
{"text":"Not very flexible on the menu, not many options for vegetarians . Food however is not bad and generous"}
{"text":"***my first review was at the parc ex location, this one is the Samson location****

We went here tonight, we were a big group so we started off with there calamari platter and pikilia platter, both delicious, the pikilia had all those amazing spreads, very delicious. The only think is I wished there were pitas on the menu! For these spreads instead of bread.

   Then we ordered a few dishes like chicken and pork brochettes with potatoes and there Greek salad was also very good, the feta wasn't over powering which can be the problem sometimes. The pork was tender and well seasoned and the chicken had that Greek glare to it, lemon, olive oil, oregano can't go wrong !

We caped off the night with a few coffees and a frappe here and there (cold coffee)
It was a very enjoyable experience I would come back!"}
{"text":"I've repeatedly heard good things coming from Tripolis and I've finally decided to make a visit. The resto is easy to find off Samson boulevard with free easy to find parking. Our reservation was respected, seated quickly and we decided to go with a whole bunch of plates to share between us.

The list of things ordered :

Tzatziki - Pretty good with a very strong garlic taste. I felt it kind of lacked a little something something to make it great. Salt maybe? Not sure. Small portion is pretty generous and comes with delicious traditional Greek bread.

Greek sausages - I loved them! They tasted soooo good! Grilled loukanikos sliced piping hot with some oil can truly make my day. If you never tasted this dish.... remedy that.

Calamari - Probably the best I've eaten in Laval in a long time. Chewy and tasty, my palette was truly enjoying this treat of a culinary dish. Writing about it doesn't help my hunger right now!

Greek salad - A big Greek salad with lots of fresh tomatoes, onions and spices with a rain of feta sprinkled on top to compliment the generous helping of olive oil. Quite yummy!

Saganaki - Not the biggest portion I've enjoyed but it's pretty good! The feta cheese looked nicely grilled with the cheese slightly melting. There was a party in my mouth with every bite!

Grilled chicken - I enjoyed them though I'm sure I've had better elsewhere. The spices complimented the chicken well. We took a half potion and it fit the bill.

Grilled lamb chops - I was slightly disappointed with them. Firstly, they were too thin. Lamb is a treat to eat but I'll have to state, I've had FAR BETTER elsewhere. The price-tag for what I got did not meet expectations.

Loukoumades - Who doesn't like fried doughnut balls wrapped in a sea of honey? I liked them but I felt they may have been fried a bit too long for my taste and it somewhat sadly hardened.Generous on the honey though. MIAM!

Cappuccino - I enjoyed the cappuccino that was very well prepared.

All in all, the experience was very good, the service was very professional and amiable. We didn't have to wait too long for our food.

The price-tag is pretty expensive and I recommend going there in a group of 4 or 6 to take advantage of many different types of dishes.

I definitely will be back."}
{"text":"25$ pour des calmars frits sans goût, graisseux, avec une panure molle et une sauce commerciale de mauvais goût. Plus jamais...."}
{"text":"Very good honest greek food. The chicken is unbelievably tender and tasty. The greek salad is probably the best you'll ever have: tomatoes are perfect and served room temperature and the crumbled feta is not too salty. Calamari are tasty but a little too oily. Spanakopita was delicious. 
Service was friendly and efficient. 
Bon appétit!"}
{"text":"Won't be going back, there are way too many better Greek places, such as Nostos for example. 

The octopus appetizer was the best plate we ordered, but the plate is tiny (2 people get about 4 bites each). 

The charbroiled chicken is supposed to be their specialty, but it's bland. Worst part of the dinner was when I bit into a piece of chicken to find that it was pink and bloody on the inside. The server assured me that this is normal and perfectly safe...I'm sure health Canada would disagree. 

The salad was basically mushy tomatoes bathing in a pool of oil. There was about a half inch of oil in the bottom of the plate, which combined with the undercooked chicken, made all three of us feel nauseated. 

Came back home feeling like throwing up. I really don't get why some people are raving about this place."}
{"text":"This is my favourite Greek restaurant in Laval! Fabulous pork souvlaki, Greek roasted potatoes and delicious all dressed salad!  You also got to try their fried calamari!!! Delicious and lightly battered ! Freshly made tzatziki and tarama and skordalia as well!  For dessert you need to try the loukoumades! To die for!  End your meal with a Greek coffee! Enjoy this gem in Laval! Bon appetit!!"}
{"text":"Dr Jekyll & Mr. Hyde. You never know what you will get here. Sometimes the food is good, and other times..well just stay away. I read the other reviews and I am not surprised that some people loved the chicken or lamb chops etc. Go again and order the same dish and you won't know what to expect. We were a party of 8 last night with reservation. We waited over 30 minutes for our table. I expected this so I didn't get flustered. I ordered the rib steak and it was fine, just  what I expected.
 The lamb chops were unchewable (is that a word?). Chicken was dry, octopus was better previous times. They use to have very good feta cheese, but last night they served us a cheeper brand which was so so. Generally we were all disappointed with the food and service. 
There are much better places for greek food with consistency. 
Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"BEST Greek food for your buck. I have been here to eat at least 20 times. Esp. since the original owner Steve has come back biz is booming. After polishing a bottle of XO with a friend we got hungry. I good.THINK WE ORDERED EVERYTHING ON THE MENU. Never drink before you go to a resto. 
As always the lamb, chicken excellent.Octopus yummy and there fries I always eat even though I rarely eat fries. Squid consistently good. Not sure if I took photos as I was to drunk but need to check my phone."}
{"text":"Best greek restaurant in town. I've been there recently and I was so impressed how fast the service was.
The place itself is okay, sort of small but you go there for the food right!
I really enjoyed the greek salad, it was so fresh and tasty! The chicken souvlaki was awesome! Chicken in general is kind of dry, but no this one. It was juicy and tender! Perfect!
The tzatziki was sth to die for!
I'll be back there soon!"}
