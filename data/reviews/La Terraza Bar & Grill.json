{"text":"Used to be a great place and we used to go all the time. Also used to order carry out frequently but the last few times they always seem to screw something up. Tonight was the last straw. We ordered carry out because our electricity has been out for hours. (City-wide outage). Husband arrived in 20 minutes as instructed and had to sit and wait another 10 min as the hostess did other things, including tend bar. When he got home the food was STONE COLD. I'm not talking about cooled off a little on the drive home. We live less than a mile away. I'm talking COLD like it sat out on the counter for half an hour without heat lamps and the cheese had solidified again. And with no electricity, we can't even heat it up in the microwave. Plenty of other Mexican places around to try , I guess."}
{"text":"Love it. Best Mexican in the area. Food is superb. Great service. Guacamole is some of the best around. The salsa and chips are great."}
{"text":"It is a nice, clean place with good service.  I had the tamales, which were hard and chewy and tasted like they came out of a frozen tv dinner.  I don't recommend getting those."}
{"text":"Slow service. Shrimp fishy tasting. Other dishes ok, bit not very good. Will def go elsewhere next time for Mexican."}
{"text":"We bring the family here and always have a great experience.  The staff are friendly and the food is always delicious."}
{"text":"This was one of the worst meals ever i only ate a few bites and was still sick!  Took home my large amount of greasy leftovers and my bf ate them next day he was sick too!!  We will not be going back here ever!!"}
{"text":"They have the best salsa ever (: the food is also excellent....I love how the beans are thick not runny....and the employees are all super nice!!! By far one of the best Mexican restaurants!!!"}
{"text":"Good food and good prices.  Staff is very friendly and it is very clean.  Have a great lunch menu,  dinner menu is just 1.00 more.  They just opened the patio so you have the choice of indoor or outdoor dining"}
{"text":"Today was the first time we ate here. The service was great and the food was delicious and it was out in no time at all! We will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"We ate there last night for the first time and really enjoyed ourselves. The place is really nice inside for being in a strip mall. I had the taquitos and they were yummy. The guacamole and chips and salsa were great too.  The service was extra speedy too. We are definitely going back again soon. There were many other things I wanted to try on the menu."}
{"text":"great food!! we eat here several times a week and i think it is the best mexican around. very clean and modern atmosphere too, some mexican places are seriously lacking in this department. i recommend them for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Great food. This is less expensive than nearby mexican restaurants and the food is better."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at a Mexican restaurant. I loved the atmosphere and the decor of this place.  We had a great server and the food was great! Our food took less than 10 minutes on a Thursday night. There were a decent amount of other tables. Prices are great and they have a large menu!  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We stopped at the new location on route 59 in Kent recently, after waiting a sufficient amount of time after their opening to allow them to get the kinks out. The kinks were live and well that weekday evening, I am sorry to say.

Waited 10 minutes to be seated.  When no one came to do that - we sat ourselves at a clean empty table in the bar. Our waiter threw menus at us as he ran by and caught our order when he ran by the next time.  Our margaritas were a long time coming on his third pass by our table but, the chips and salsa we got with the menus kept us.  Our dinners came quickly and I thought, \"oh he forgot our guacamole appetizer, he's so busy I won't make a deal about it since we have our meals already.\"  Nope he threw that on the table as he ran by 10 minutes later ....with no additional chips to eat it with so... it didn't get eaten.  Couldn't tell him for he never came back all through dinner.  Luckily when he threw our dinners down, we were able to catch him long enough to tell him that we would need silverware and napkins too.  As far as him bringing them to us... we waited and waited and waited for his return, with our food just sitting there, before he threw a handful of silverware on the table as he ran by.  We were able to get his attention to get our check with the writing on an air receipt trick when we were finished,... but waited a good 15 minutes to get our credit card back. 

How was the food you ask?  The food is NO DIFFERENT than 20 other similar places I could get it within a 30 minute drive... the difference is  many of THEM value their customers enough to hire enough people to give them a dinning experience."}
{"text":"Food was average. What was a negative for us was the poor service. Waiter was clearly not in a good mood/acted as if he'd rather be ANYWHERE else, mumbled so that we hardly understood him/had to guess what he said, didn't make eye contact or stop by our table to see if we needed anything. This was not a busy day & he didn't have more than 2 other tables. We probably won't be back. There are several Mexican restaurants in the area where the food is better and the customer service is friendly & helpful."}
{"text":"went here for a get together with two friends.. we waited 10 mins to get seated, when the restaurant was dead, service was terrible. the food was good and the atmosphere was clean and neat.. needs to work on their service"}
{"text":"I am in love with the margaritas here. The best I have ever had and I went to a full on authentic Mexican place in Los Angeles last summer and was sorely disappointed in them. And loving the chimichangas too. Chory polo is to die for as well."}
{"text":"Things seem to have gotten better here....when they first opened the food was great but then began to slip.  It slipped to the point where we haven't been back in two years.  

The decor could use some freshening but I love how much natural light comes in from the windows."}
{"text":"Whole restaurant smelled like toilet water, ruined our appetite. Very very slow service. Would not recommend to anybody."}
{"text":"Our fav local restaurant!   We go fairly regularly, and take family whenever we can.    Atmosphere, service and food as well as prices are great!   Coupons are always out there too!   
I've never waited for a table and tried many menu items.   If you are looking for good Mexican food, this is the place to try!"}
{"text":"Food was good as always. It's nice you can combine two different flavors of Margaritas in a pitcher."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch today. Dulce was a fantastic server and very attentive. Our food was amazing and affordable. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite Mexican around, but I think they're under new management. The menu was different, much shorter. Interestingly enough, all drinks are left off of the menu. My boyfriend and I get pretty much the same order every time. Queso, chicken quesadillas, and a half pitcher of margaritas. Queso costs $4 something now and came out already solidified on the surface. Yum...not. And though we realized all the food had gone up a good $2-$3 dollars, we were disgusted when our bill came and the half pitcher cost as much as the full pitcher used to. Obviously, why the alcohol wasn't listed. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"We have been coming here since they opened and I must say that I am very disappointed in what they have become. 
We sat down and looked at the menu and the prices have been increased significantly. Overall, I was just not happy with the food. The service was good."}
{"text":"My husband and I go weekly and have never been disappointed by the food. We came from California and were looking for good Mexican food. This place fits the bill!"}
{"text":"First timer here, and I was blown away.  Good prices, friendly staff, and the quickest service I've ever seen.  Immediatly, I thought it was pre-prepped food and would be disappointed, but couldn't have been more wrong.  Everything was great!  You owe it to yourself to try this place...you'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"I want to start off by saying that I had a wonderful time having good food and a friendly waiter named JUAN ... AKA \"The Thief\". When it was time to pay my bill, I handed my credit card to JUAN. He claimed that he accidentally charged my credit card to someone else's bill and refunded that amount, then charged me for my actual bill. He had given me my receipt and I felt ok about his explanation regarding his \"mistake\". Well, less than 48 hours later, random charges began being applied to my credit card account for items such as event tickets, fuel at Sheetz, and a fancy Mexican restaurant in downtown Akron (Nuevo). I know the culprit had to have originated from this establishment, because that is the only place I used my credit card. I haven't used this particular credit card in over a month until last Saturday, February 24th. Juan enjoyed a night on the town to my expense on Monday, February 26th. I have notified the local authorities of this incident. I HIGHLY RECOMMENDED YOU PAY IN CASH, because someone is skimming credit cards at this establishment!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I eat here probably every other week. The service and food are usually fantastic. The place is usually pretty clean as well. We only had one bad experience here, and that is when we were treated terribly by a server we had never seen before, and we are generally pretty laid back customers. The other employees took care of it though so I won't go into the experience, because it had not been our experience up to that point. We finally went back after a few months because we really like the food, and we have never seen that server since, so it looks like they took care of it!"}
{"text":"Wonderful place. Has good food, fast service. No complaints. I eat here at least once a week. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Amazing food!!! Kristen is absolutely amazing, we go there weekly and sit in her section. Authentic homemade Sangria! Endless salsa and chips! They are tied in with El Campisino, so if you like that place, you will LOVE Terraza"}
{"text":"This is one of our 3 local favorite Mexican restaurants, we order take out here several times/month. Tried something new today: El Burrito Barzone. Loved it! I was sold on the Pineapples, Shrimp and Chorizo. Our son got a kids Mac and cheese but didn't really like it. It's just Kraft but making pasta is not their strong suit, .  My wife enjoyed her taco combo. For a quick $22 lunch for 3, it's worth every dollar!"}
{"text":"Visiting and shopping at Marshall's a few doors down when hunger hits. Beef o Brady or here and son agreed to come here. We live in SD and this is better than what we have.  The burrito I had with grilled pineapple and homemade chorizo was stellar!  

Desserts, beer and food were all top notch. The service lacked but would absolutely return when in the area again."}
{"text":"great food at a reasonable price.  service was fast and friendly.  staff was very attentive."}
{"text":"Just stopped in for dinner on my way home. Probably the worst chili rellenos I've had in my life. Everything swimming in grease or oil -- the rellenos, the beans, even the rice.  Only good part of the meal was the gigantic draft beer that they call a \"tall\".  I needed it to wash down the yukky food."}
{"text":"Asked for steak fajitas and the server said chicken or steak? Repeated myself and he said \"chicken\" I said no steak. Guess what I get my meal and it was chicken. This is the second time this has happened to me. Apparently if you want steak for your dish you are out of luck"}
{"text":"Love this little authentic Mexican restaurant.  The restaurant is fairly new and the decor is modern.  For my meal, I ordered the chicken fajita quesadilla.  It was delicious and so big for a great price!  My bill was under $10 and I also had a jumbo margarita.  I had leftovers for the next day too!"}
{"text":"Have been coming here since they opened, great place with awesome food and fair prices. my wife and I love the sangria margaritas and their salsas are amazing. Get a large beer here and they give you a bucket of beer with a handle. Seriously,  $5.50 for a beer so big it makes the German in me smile. A smiling german, do you know how impressive that is?  highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to La Terraza. I did not get a chance to celebrate Cinco de Mayo so I took the opportunity a day later to visit a Mexican restaurant. 

The store front of this place is attractive and the decor within was pleasant. We decided to dine indoors even though they had a nice little patio for nice weather days. 

As soon as we sat down, we were served salsa and red chips which tasted good. Our server was friendly and was quite attentive throughout our visit. Their menu was adequate, with plenty of variety for even the most picky eaters. I ordered 'ala carte' steak tacos and my partner ordered a chimicanga meal. My order came with 3 tacos filled with juicy steak and some cheese. I found it a little dry but after I put some of the salsa on it, it was fine. The chimicanga looked great, smothered with sauce and cheese, with some rice. We thought our food was good value for the price.

I have no problems visiting La Terraza again when I'm in the mood for Mexican food."}
{"text":"It's been about 3 to 4 years and La Terraza is sill the best!  Let's be honest, most mexican restaurants in this area can be down right scary.  El Rinco, Mi Casa, El Rancho, Casa Del Rio, El Jalapeno, Panchos....Just to name a few.  Yes I have tried them all.

The atmosphere is very nice, not cheesy and dirty. The service is fabulous, all of the staff is so kind.  Everyone from the servers to the hostesses, bartenders, bus boys, managers, and kitchen staff are all superb. Very nice and very attentive. They'll bring you a refill on your drink or chips/salsa before you even realize you need one!

The food is great!  The margarita's are delicious! The chips and salsa are awesome (salsa made in house), everything is fresh and served well.  It's not just thrown on a plate. I have ordered almost everything on the menu at least once and I've never been disappointed. 

Great food that is no more expensive than any of the other restaurants I mentioned above.  Oh, and they also have outdoor seating which is nice!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place. Not your average grimy Mexican restaurant. Food is amazing, staff is great... Chips and salsa are served as you are seated. Good prices too."}
{"text":"This is an adequate Mexican place. I think the best thing on the menu is the chorizo and cheese, get it as an appetizer and you won't be disappointed. As far as the food goes, it's average. I wouldn't say it's fantastic but it's good enough to keep me coming back for lunch. The taco salad is decent and they have really cheap lunch specials that aren't bad. I would go for the beef tips though, I would say that's probably the best. 

I have always had to go back to work afterwards so I have never tried the margaritas but I would like to. People are very friendly and I have never had bad service."}
{"text":"Excellent meal. Fresh ingredients. Good service. Adequate atmosphere. Fajita  salad was delicious and healthy."}
{"text":"If I could rate this restaurant zero stars, I would. I've never been so insulted. I've visited this restaurant multiple times. Two times, I was asked to move tables to accommodate other customers. In hindsight, I, post 60, was asked to vacate my booth for a younger couple. I won't be back. Ever."}
{"text":"The staff is super friendly and while not always immediately around to get extra salsa, they're easily waved down and happy to please. The chicken fajitas are flavorful, which is more than most other Mexican places in the area can boast. The ambiance on a Saturday night is busy, but not overly busy or loud. They have a nice selection of tequila with Cabo Wabo as one of the options. The place is clean and has a cute patio when the weather is nice. Easily one of the nicest and tastiest Mexican places in the area! Will keep returning."}
{"text":"this place has four out of five stars... how ... how how... i mean it looks nice... its obviously meant to be attractive for the American crowd. but if i wanted microwaved food I could have gone to walmart and get it. By gosh this food was awful. I mean I got a quesadilla. Which was essentially a soft taco. The lettuce and everything else was not in the food. I had to put it in myself. The meat had no flavor. None at all. the rice was out of a can and so were the beans. The server though he did look Latin. Certain never spoke Spanish as his main language. I mean the idea that the temptation of speaking the language to the server in a foreign food place is fun. You expect it. Nope I got dude bro. Of course they give you chips and salsa. They were the Chi's Chi's chips and salsa from the former restaurant (which I love) and their chips. Surely not authentic but good for a party. The service was slow as the service obviously had way too many tables. The guacamole was out of a giant tub. If i wanted avocado mash I could do that myself. I mean look the food was not unsanitary in anyway. It just had no flavor. None zero zilch. This place markets itself and does say that its the same family who own el campesino. I have never been to el campesino but..... bahahahahha ahahahahha ahhahahahahh ... if this is what el campesino is like how are they still in business? Do they really think the American pallet is that bland? I mean ahahahahha do they really think we are that stupid. This is the blandest food the blandest food I have ever had. I mean how does this place get such good ratings. Enough Enough. I give ahahahahah... o i needed a good laugh."}
{"text":"This is the worst excuse for Mexican food. There are plenty of better places to go to in the area."}
{"text":"Found a bone in my food. And the person in charge said well that happens. It almost broke my tooth. There is nothing good about this place. It is really awful"}
{"text":"I asked the waiter for a dish that was no longer on the menu. He said they would be happy to make it.  It was very good! The service was excellent! Not only does your server make sure you have everything you need but everybody walking past will ask you if everything is okay! I think that is great service. Definitely will go back! Recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Very clean and modern design inside, even in the bathroom.  The menu has most of your standard Mexican/American dishes. All of the employees that we interacted with were very friendly and attentive.  I had the huevos con chorizo, one of my favorite dishes, and was very satisfied with it.  The guacamole had a strong lime flavor, but was still good.  Overall a very good dining experience, but nothing mind blowing."}
{"text":"This is the favorite restaurant for my family. They have really high-quality Mexican food and we're looking forward to their new Kent location.  I usually get the Fire Burrito which I like a lot, but I should probably start trying other things because they all look good."}
{"text":"Great food,  Great prices and great service! We go there at least once a month. Best salsa in town!"}
