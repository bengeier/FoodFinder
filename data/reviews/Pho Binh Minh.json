{"text":"Absolutely the BEST pho in Phoenix. The place is hidden in an unappealing area but very worth the stop. I drive from the other side of town just to eat pho here. The spring rolls are delicious; everything taste so fresh. The boba is amazing as well! I definitely recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"Awesome customer service and great food. Greeted immediately and was tended to often. Food was very good too. Definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Vietnamese food: economical, relatively healthy and absolutely delicious.  What's not to love!  Pho Binh Minh has been a longstanding no-frills restaurant in NE Calgary for decades now.  Not much to look at, but they're known for their consistently delicious and authentic food in the Vietnamese community.  Popular picks include the pho, vermicelli and pork chop with rice.  You can never go wrong with a Vietnamese coffee or three bean drink on the side either."}
{"text":"Best tasting broth in Phoenix. Hands down. Try the raw beef platter, and  fresh coconut juice. Large, very clean restaurant. Service is very friendly here. Be patient if it is busy, as the owner is the only server. It is tucked away in a sketchy strip mall, but TOTALLY worth it!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately we went to another pho place just before this one during the Calgary Pho Down just down the street that we can't recommend this one (pretty standard). Stay tuned for the next review..."}
{"text":"This is just a little place tucked away on the west side of town. It's a lot larger inside than outside. I like to come here at least once a week. Staff is very friendly and welcoming.  If you are looking for some very delicious Pho you found the right place. The chicken Pho is my favorite a long with the veggie Pho. Sometimes I like to combine the shrimp Pho along with the veggie.  The shrimp spring rolls are delicious as an appetizer.  I like to try new things so they sometimes have some of the most unusall desserts some from Vietnam and some from Thailand.  I have not had one that I have not only been intreged but also found surprisingly delicious.  I highly recommend this place. I know I will always come back."}
{"text":"Good prices, amazing food, really nice consistent service, absolutely lovely ^_^ The soups are wonderful, the food is really nice, and the prices are actually not bad at all for the amount of food you get. Easily a place you can go to 2-5 times a week."}
{"text":"Solid 4 star pho but 3 stars only because even if you order the biggest bowl of Pho you get barely any meat in it. They are so cheap with their meat."}
{"text":"Used to be our go to for pho, but recently after their reno?, prices have gone up which would have been ok, but portions have gone down - not ok.  Like others have said they are really stingy w meat - my husband ordered the extra large the amount of meat in bowl was pitiful and so was my large and I am not a big meat eater by any standards.  Service is sometimes nice, disinterested to almost hostile depending on the server, which again we don't really mind as long as we get a good bowl of pho, and their broth one of the better ones in Calgary.  At last I have to find new go to in my neck of the wood."}
{"text":"As another reviewer stated, this place was empty when we stopped in for lunch so we weren't quite sure what to expect. Service was great. However, I was disappointed to find that although banh mi was on the menu, they are no longer served.  It was one of the reasons why I was so excited to stop here. I came with a large party so we tried a few different things. Of course we had to try the pho, which turned out to be a good choice. The broth was delicious. The quality of the meat was subpar. Would I order it again? Yes. We also ordered spring rolls and eggrolls. The spring rolls were warm and the peanut sauce tasted very strongly of peanut butter and that was it. My sister added additional condiments to the sauce to make it taste better. The eggrolls were surprisingly good. Again, the dipping sauce failed us. It was very watered down. My husband ordered a beef stir fry that was edible, but nothing to write home about. My sister ordered banh xeo, which was very bland. My brother-in-law ordered spicy noodles, which weren't spicy. Overall, if you didn't order pho, you were unhappy with your food. If you want banh mi, this isn't the place for you. Would I drive to this restaurant again from the west valley? Probably not."}
{"text":"Good....but not great. We started with Cha Giò, the fried egg rolls. The filling and size were good, crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, 3 to an order but they were cooked very dark with the ends being  black.   The Chicken Fried Rice was good without being remarkable.    The Hot and Spicy Soup was good, again without being remarkable.   The Chicken Noodle soup (pho gà)  was steaming hot with a fair amount of sliced chicken but for some reason, the top of the soup was covered in fresh cilantro, something that overpowers the flavor of the broth and unless you're a cilantro lover....diminishes the end product.   Two cups of hot tea, one iced tea total tab: $34."}
{"text":"NEVER AGAIN!!!!!  Our usual pho place closed early, found this place.  Not busy, but took 45 minutes for two bowls of pho. No apology, nothing.     I used the last three pieces to toilet paper in the Ladies room. No paper towels. No hot water.  So how do the employees wash their hands before handling food???  Nope, nope, nopity nope!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favourite pho place ... ever!!!  Love the taste of the beef (thinly sliced and very beefy), love the chewy softness of the noodles, the broth is amazing ...  I always order the pho sate because its the best!    I heart this place!!!!"}
{"text":"Omg there food is so good my fiance and I would come here every two weeks and sit in the same spot the waiter already knew what I would be ordering.  The spring rolls are AMAZING :D"}
{"text":"Good food and very friendly staff. The food always good. We've been here many time and the servers remember us & our orders. It's what make this my go to Vietnamese restaurant.   Restaurant doesn't get busy, but when it does the kitchen backs up. So beware. Also other reviewers are correct; weird strip mall, empty sometimes, & couple of times there was no one at counter but I just rang the bell and they attended me immediately"}
{"text":"I have been a huge fan of Pho my entire life and this place hits the spot! Great service, great food, and they have my favorite Boba shakes!"}
{"text":"Very bad service...there were a couple of tables available but we stood there for 5mins...the waiters (4 all together) walked by and saw us.  No one stopped and asked.  We ended up leaving the restaurant...the just looked at us and see us go....Wanted to give one star but two stars for ok pho....never come back again..."}
{"text":"I ordered the \"Pho Tai\", and it was pretty good. The waiting time is kind of a long time, but not terrible. The people that were working at the time were nice."}
{"text":"Amazing service and great food...all at a great price.  The best part is the scratch kitchen with most orders cooked when ordered and not premade sitting there dieing in a warmer. I've had the pho and it is really good.  The banh mi is good too...just wish it had a little more meat and veggies....that was the only thing holding me back from a 5 star review.  This place is the real deal...plain and simple."}
{"text":"I usually have my Pho fix at home cause nothing will ever compare to mama's cooking. However, when I do eat pho out at restaurants I have to say my favorite place to goto is Pho Binh Minh which is located on 17th Ave SE the avenue of Pho restaurants basically.  Unlike I lot of places this place always uses FRESH pho noodles which makes a remarkable difference in taste. The broth is done just right and the thinly sliced beef always tastes delicious.  Not to forget about the other dishes available, definitely try out the Bun Cha Gio Thit Nuong (Vermecelli w/ Beef and Spring Rolls) and the rice dishes tastes great as well!"}
{"text":"Great food, excellent service by the owner of the restaurant.  This restaurant is very clean and the portions are the same than in other Vietnamese restaurants.  Prices are excellent.  It is worth trying it."}
{"text":"Walked through the doors and the atmosphere felt very awkward here. We were greeted friendly but there was no one in the restaurant besides us. It was lunch time and the restaurant was so empty. Feeling very skeptical to give the food a try because there no one here. My dad and I both got the rice plate with grilled pork and a fried egg. The portion is so small! I got two small strips of meat and a small fried egg. I can't believe how stingy they were with the food.   Moving on with the taste, the food was actually good. Soup was very savory, and my sister who got Bun Bo Hue tasted very good too. But they are too stingy with their portion size. For the price we paid, I think customers should deserve more."}
{"text":"Two days ago I felt drained and fatigued at the end of the workday, so I went to Pho Binh Minh - one of those \"gems in rundown strip malls\" - to recharge. The VERY tasty Bun (rice noodles) with grilled pork and shrimp was a great pick-me-up, and the delicious Vietnamese iced coffee gave me such a buzz that I was ready to climb the walls an hour later ;)  The experience was so positive that I went back today to try their fresh spring rolls and the brisket and steak pho; both were excellent. The restaurant is simple and spacious, the service was good, as were the prices - especially if you're on a tight budget. I guess it's just the strip mall setting that kept me from giving this place a 5-star rating, and that's hardly their fault."}
{"text":"2nd time here...  As usual, the place has only a few people so it's quiet. We ordered our usual fare (spring rolls, combination pho, boba, & thai tea), and once again this place does not disappoint.  I would have included a before picture, but I'll do a during shot...that is if there's anything left!"}
{"text":"Great service and our family loves eating here! I like their rice noodles with pork. Makes me hungry just thinking about it! The atmosphere is great, the people are friendly and it's a clean restaurant."}
{"text":"In a nutshell, very good pho but not the best.  The broth is flavorful but just not good enough for me to make the drive from downtown.  Almost every pho shop on this side of town offers pretty much the same level of goodness.  For those who live in the area, this place should be on your short list."}
{"text":"Our usual fav pho place was closed at 8pm, so we yelped the nearest alternative and voila, this is where we ate! It was very good. The decor wasn't spectacular, but the food and prices were all that we could want.   Yummy broth & good spring rolls. Hit the mark for our Pho cravings."}
{"text":"I have tried so many pho places in Calgary and I always find myself returning here. They are so polite, good and prompt service. Also, we never feel out of place here and the pho ga is really delicious. I also recommend getting the grilled chicken with steamed rice...very tasteful"}
{"text":"Most defiantly love their rice orders, every time you drive by and smell the delicious meat cooking on the grill it makes you want to stop what your doing!  The pho's soups is okay? I personally think rice would be best to eat when you're there.  The price range is pretty fair, just an average asian cuisine."}
{"text":"Was really happy with our first visit,ordered three pho to go. Once the order came and I headed home,notice that the order wasn't complete,had to return to get it fixed. Once home the pho was very cold and flavorless.  Don't feel this spot will be seeing me for a second run"}
{"text":"I ordered the 'Pho Dac Biet' (combination noodle soup with rare steak, well done flank, brisket, tendon, beef ball & tripe) and it is always delicious.  Food is always served hot!  Their staff is always respectful and kind.   Today I walked in to place an order TO GO.  I was immediately greeted by the the lady (possibly the owner) at the register.  Nobody in my party was hungry so I only ordered a single entrée while they waited in the car.  She said my order would be ready in 5 minutes.  I went back to my car to wait.  While we were going over the other appealing entrées on their menu the same lady came to our car with my order.   When I got home I was surprised to find everything was separated.  The soup was still very hot and the only thing in it was the beef ball split in two halves.  The rare steak was wrapped in aluminum foil.  There was a generous amount of Pho, flank, brisket, and tripe in a separate styrofoam box w/the chopped green onions on the side.  The bean sprouts and large bunch of basil came in a bag with two large jalapeño rings and two slices of lemon.  Side of Hoisin (sweet) sauce mixed with a dash of (spicy) Sriracha.  Chopsticks, plastic utensils and napkins.  I will visit again, for DINE-IN and TO GO!    This is a hole-in-the-wall.  Hidden in a small and unappealing shopping center.  Don't let the appearances from the outside fool you.  You'll miss out if you do.  The restaurant is old but very clean.  It had three of their last grades posted... all As'.  I would recommend this family-owned (and family-friendly) restaurant to everyone.  They have about 15 tables for four and they're well spaced out.  Several TVs' around the restaurant with local news or games on.  Support local and small Businesses."}
{"text":"First time here. Yummy Nomz. I like the lady who served us, seems sweet, nice hair cut. I ordered a Thai Tea and Combination Pho, everything was good. Decor/dining area wasn't impressive but the price was great. I would recommend this place to any friend wanting Pho the morning after a crazy night of partying ^___^"}
{"text":"Simply put, its the best pho short of travelling to Vietnam. The broth is beyond delicious and the staff is friendly and welcoming. Love!!"}
{"text":"Had the combination crispy noodle dish, it was soooo delicious!! I'll be back here for sure!"}
{"text":"The pho is whatever, just normal (not horrible but not great) but their rice dishes are so good. The pork chops are marinated deliciously. I only get their rice dishes, but if you get their pho you might be underwhelmed."}
{"text":"Don't know what made us stop in here but I'm so grateful we did. The Pho is served in huge bowls that could probably feed 2 people easily. My son has a serious gluten allergy so it makes it hard for him to eat out but here they are so accommodating. The food is always amazing and the wait staff are super attentive. Don't let the decor fool you there is nothing average about the food here. The cost is super cheap. Definitely a great place to eat."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the worst places for pho in y books.  It's neither economical nor value for your money, and most importantly not good quality at all.  I was raised on homemade pho and my parents owned the Royal Swan Vietnamese restaurant so I can say I know what good pho should taste like and this doesn't even come close.  I had the satay pho and any sate pho is suppose to have some peanuts, spices and heat.  All this had was heat.  It was as though they took their regular pho broth, added some chili flakes and called it satay.  The spring rolls are the ugliest things I've ever seen, long skinny finger like rolls that were expensive too, $6.90 for 4 pieces.  The small size pho was a kid size and it was $8.90.  You would find better value and quality at Noodle World or Pho Pasteur.  I felt kind of mad after eating here, you know the feeling you get when you get ripped off.  Don't even get me started on their rare done beef noodle soup, the amount of meat they give you is so small, and it's thinly sliced frozen beef that is cooked in the microwave before they pour on the broth.  It looks different when the hot broth is poured on and cooks the meat.  I would never come back here again, and the only reason we came because my father in law is vegetarian and they have some vegetarian dishes.  They have some at Noodle World too, so next time we will go there."}
{"text":"The pho and service here were exceptional. The place has a nice Vietnamese feel to it. I will dine here again!"}
{"text":"Love this place ! Excellent service and food! I always get pho and egg rolls and spring rolls ! I love the spring rolls taste like the ones in California! Sandwiches are amazing!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to half a dozen pho restaurants in The Valley including the usual spots like Da Vang. This place has the best pho in Phoenix. Great customer service- the waitress always remembers our order. And this place is definitely cleaner than most other restaurants."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem.  The owner is friendly, the place is clean clean clean and the food is amazing.  The Vietnamese pancake is THE BEST!  Food is always hot, fresh and served with a smile.  Our once a week indulgence!"}
{"text":"I would pass this restaurant occasionally but never gave it much thought. I decided to give it a try today. it was right across the street from a job I had. Glad I tried it. The people were very friendly. The restaurant very clean. Food was delicious. Will come again and again."}
{"text":"We as a hoard of 20 were invited by some Vietnamese doctors to supper at this Vietnamese restaurant one night after a performance.  The doctors knew the owners and asked them to open the restaurant especially for our group because we arrived well after closing time.  Our large gaggle and after hours entrance did not affect the great service and eventually delicious meal.  Orders were taken per table, and drinks and appetizers were brought out in record time.  There were mango and melon blended drinks, bubble teas, Chinese tea and Vietnamese coffee, pho and won ton, all made with perfection and not one lacking taste or presentation.  The main courses came out in due course as well, noodles, lemon beef, dumplings, spring rolls etc.  Food for 20, dishes were taken away when finished and soon our meal which I believe lasted for 2 hours was a success.  I highly recommend this restaurant for big parties, I returned weeks later and had a meal by myself and it too was tasty and to my satisfaction."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant many times. For me, I usually only go here out of convenience or someone else picks the place.  They have updated the menu since I last came here and they have quite an extensive vegetarian menu compared to other pho restaurants.  The problem for me with this place is that it's never consistent and I think they use quite a bit of msg in their food because I'm always so thirsty after eating here.  Sometimes the food is great and sometimes its just not.  We had a large group on Christmas day and we were able to get a table for 13 people right away.  I tried the veggie spring rolls and bun mam this time (special of the day) and it was pretty decent (a little on the sweet side) and the spring rolls were nothing special."}
{"text":"I come here during my lunch breaks for pick up! I have never tried their pho yet, but I'm sure it's delicious. The grilled pork chop is phenomenal! And it's such a great portion. Their spring roll and egg rolls are awesome as well."}
{"text":"I would come here weekly back a few years. They've renovated and the place looks more open. The rice plate is decent, egg was over cooked and also slightly with the pork. I also had a bowl of pho at the same time, the broth is fragrant and a decent amount of meat is given. The service is good, everything came out quite quick and it was a nice visit."}
{"text":"I got well done brisket Pho, Summer rolls and Strawberry boba.  I have had better Pho and Summer rolls in Phoenix (Khai Hoan in Tempe), but the service was amazing, and so was the boba. The boba was clearly canned, but not slimy, and the strawberry flavor was great. The boba comes with whipped cream so make sure you comment if you don't want it.   For being close to where we live, I'll go back when absolutely necessary, but I'm a bigger fan of other places in town."}
{"text":"Wow! This place blew my mind. Authentic and priced right. Their Pho and spring rolls are some of the best I've had in PHX. We will be back. Great service even better food!"}
{"text":"The banh xeo was honestly tasteless and not very filling compared to other places. The spring rolls had too much mint for my taste. The service was pretty great tho. And I must say the iced coffee is also pretty good. I would be willing to try other things on the menu like their pho next time, but would pass on the banh xeo"}
{"text":"A hidden gem! I love the service and food every single time I come here. Their bun bo hue is on point! Better than my mom's cooking :0"}
{"text":"It's amazing place food is great and the staff so friendly and welcoming. Nice quite if you just want a little me time."}
{"text":"A friend bought me lunch here this last Saturday.  He's been telling me about this place for months, and coincidentally, I heard about this place from a former co-worker as well.  He insisted I try several dishes, so we split the first two plates.  We got a combination sandwich, which tasted incredible.  I'm not much of a sandwich fan, but the fusion of flavor was just right.  The next plate was the Cm Bò Nng, the beef was soooo tender and flavorful, that I am still craving it 2 days later.  Then we each got a bowl of pho that was the best I have tasted here in Arizona (had some incredible tasting pho in California).  I was so stuffed that I couldn't finish it.  I would definitely like to come here again.  Staff was very courteous and friendly."}
{"text":"Amazing pho! And amazing boba smoothies! Natural mango and all! Definitely coming back. Friendly staff"}
{"text":"I first came here over 10 years ago, it was my go to Vietnamese pho spot. And this was before there was a Vietnamese restaurant on every corner. Today I wondered if it was still as good as it was a decade ago so I visited.  Still good. I would've given it five stars except my small soup was very small. Smaller than I've ever seen. Also the noodles were a little too slippery for my chopsticks to handle, I've experienced that one time before and it's frustrating. Not sure if it has to do with the heat of the broth or the age of the noodles... Soak time?  But the broth was sparkling, flecks of oil droplets but not large ones, a golden beautiful color, the smell was great, the taste was wonderful.  Really good food. And consistent. I hope this place is always here. On my way out I saw containers of peanuts for sale. I asked, and he said they were salty and sweet. Without me asking to give me a sample of 2-3 peanuts. Five bucks for the container. I bought them. Really good.  I would say officially my favorite Vietnamese restaurant in Calgary."}
{"text":"Stopped by here since our usual joint was closed. Had pho dac biet and it was yummy. It was loaded with meat, tendons and meat balls, which is a plus and its broth was darker than what I am used to, but very aromatic and yummy. My son had the rice platter with BBQ pork chops and he liked it very much. \"Mmmm, goot,\" he says. :o)  I give them a 3 star rating because we were there at 9:15 and they werent open yet. The sign said that they open at 9:00."}
{"text":"Just moved here from California and I have to say that I've tired about 4 different places and this is the one that hit close to home fresh and good and very flavorful .. Found my new place"}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this place. Unfortunately I waited over 10 minutes in the restaurant seated and no one was at the counter or anywhere when I was trying to get some service so I just had to leave"}
{"text":"I almost DON'T want to write about this place because it's so good and I am selfish. This little hole in the wall is some of the best pho I've ever had. I actually finished the entire bowl, which is something I never do because I just couldn't stop eating it. The owners are totally sweet, remember regulars by name and order, and check in constantly.   I had the Pho Tai, which was quite quite delicious obviously. My dining partners had the Pho Tai Chin Nam and Pho Ga. The one who got the Pho Ga said it's one of the only Pho places he can find that has a soup base that isn't pork. We also ordered some spring rolls, which were gobbled up within seconds. The rest of the menu looks really great too, I can't wait to come back and order more!"}
{"text":"This place is a joke.   The portion of food is for kids.  The rice dishes is all microwaved."}
{"text":"Favourite pho stop in Calgary. Always consistent always generous portions always great service"}
