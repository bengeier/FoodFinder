{"text":"The girl with the long hair always helps me out in the morning. I get either a Vegas sumo or a build your own bowl with salmon, and she always makes sure to pay special attention that she doesn't touch any of my food with shellfish items (I have a food allergy). Poukei rocks, thanks guys! :)"}
{"text":"Fresh food they have surf and turf even for the non sushi eater and build your own options. 5 stars if there were more proteins to choose from. I guess to be budget conscious since it's sea food in the middle of the Sahara it makes sense to have only what's mostly popular."}
{"text":"The food was good and portion was substantial. But the flavors were very tame."}
{"text":"Amazing! Absolutely love this place! Came from Chicago & have been here twice! I could eat here everyday & wish this place were closer  (happy to travel here though just to eat here)."}
{"text":"I actually haven't eaten the food that I got, but I can't imagine having worst service from any place in the world. I was given attitude because I didn't want the rice or lettuce as a base. And I made it clear that I wanted this food to go. I was wrung up and everybody walked away. Leaving me with a bowl without a lid. It's took almost 5 minutes for someone to emerge because they couldn't hear me calling for them. It looks like good quality fish but the service here is terrible."}
{"text":"Couldn't decide what to get but was positively and charismatically guided by Saul one of the men behind the counter with a very welcoming smile and attitude. He knew his facts and menu very well, after expressing I wasn't a fan of very spicy things and loved crunch, crab and eel sauce, he recommended the Poukie Crunch. It was not only not spicy but delicious and crunchy with a great combination of flavors. Huge chunks of shrimp and crab. Not skimpy on the serving size. Great Service and knowledgeable-hospitable staff, would definitely recommend to f&f.  Will return for another Poukie Crunch  or another recommendation from the great welcoming staff. Thank you guys!"}
{"text":"Wayyyyyy overpriced for the portion they give u. I ordered the grilled chicken teriyaki bowl and tell me why my chicken was not grilled or at least it didn't look or tasted grilled. I saw them scooping the chicken out of some kind of water. I took a bite and threw the rest away."}
{"text":"Remember to ask for light sauce, not too much.  Cali roll came out spicy? Customer service was great. The two ladies were very helpful and patient with my friend and I.  Check in before ordering."}
{"text":"The food is salty! To top it off the Manager adds extra charges to your bill for her Pocket!!! BEWARE!!! Did you know the workers Do Not wash their hands!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is our new spot for Hawaiian cuisine. superb friendly staff, excellent customer service. got the Cali Roll and Korean POKE BOWL.Taste is delicious.  recommend  it."}
{"text":"Every time I'm in Vegas I eat here at least once a day.    Such good food and the staff is awesome as well."}
{"text":"I agree with Michelle W.  Encouraged by the positive ratings we checked this place out. I wonder if any of you tried the Poke Bowls.  Put aside the expected problems like high price and little actual tuna per serving. The bowls me and wife got were absolutely horrific.  It was so terribly salty it was barely edible.  It was as salty as canned anchovies. Both me and my wife tossed half the meal after the manager refused to taste what the staff had put in our oversized cardboard containers and stated that this is how it is supposed to taste. He offered to make another batch with the same pre-mixed sauce which he said would have tasted the same as what he had already served me and then gave me this look like if you don't like it, don't come here.   This is exactly what I am going to do! OMG even though we were willing to put up with a small serving and a high price, this was absolutely terrible. This left a seriously nasty taste in our mouths for a few hours after until a number of beers could wash this stuff down and quenched the salt induced thirst that followed this \"meal\".  Poukei, Never again."}
{"text":"Teriyaki chicken bowl = bland steam chicken that was prepared well in advance and cut into strips and upon ordering covered with teriyaki sauce from the bottle.   Strongly not recommended"}
{"text":"I think I've died and went to heaven! It's difficult to find healthy/fresh food options along the strip - but Poukei is hands down amazing!! The quality of the sushi, variety of toppings, and stellar service are not to be missed. Special thanks to Misha & Gelasia for satisfying my cravings - I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I ordered a Japanese poke bowl. When I get poke I always imagine that they fill it up to the time of the bowel. My bowel empty. Barely any food in there."}
{"text":"Food was delicious, and Jessica who served us was so helpful! Definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"I give 3-star for the reasonable price. The actual poke was just okay. However, beware, the spicy tuna/spicy salmon is not just spicy, its a burning sensation pain spicy.   My husband and I both got the spicy ones for our protein and we were both blowing our nose the entire time trying to eat the sweeter veggies in our bowl because it was just THAT spicy. I definitely recommend ordering the unflavored protein and getting spicy sauce on the side so that you can control the level of spiciness."}
{"text":"Awesome place and concept, especially the fact that you can customise your own bowl. I will definitely go again."}
{"text":"Go see Byron!! This place is awesome, the best poke deal! Poke burritos and bowls. Fresh sea food, Best spot on the strip. Go find and share the spot!!"}
{"text":"The fish was fresh. Could use more diverse poke sauces. Not too spicy. Overall decent poke."}
{"text":"For the amount of food you receive for the amount of money isn't really worth it.   It wasn't that it was bad, it just didn't seem good. I've seen places like this in Los Angeles and they have a certain quality that you can't capture here. I think this is the perfect food truck grab and go, but as a stand alone store, I feel like you should be able to grab faster and go further with your buck.  Like Jeremy B said \"the seafood was decent, but everything else seemed below average\". It sums it up completely.   Need a tighter roll and more filling for the price."}
{"text":"Delicious! My first time trying Poke! We were starving and needed a quick bite to eat before a hair appointment in Miracle mile. The ingredients are fresh and they're not cheap with the servings sizes. I did the build you own and loved the combination of yum yum sauce with teriyaki!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!! And Jessica is super sweet and super helpful! Her customer service is awesome... I would definitely recommend Poukei to eat and to enjoy the service!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is located in Planet Hollywood right beside the Axis performance venue inside the Miracle Mile shops.They are open late which makes it convenient if you are looking for a quick bite.  You can build your own poké bowl with toppings or opt for a roll. The bowls start with white or brown rice and a protein such as tuna, salmon or spam. Toppings include seaweed salad, grilled asparagus (both $0.50 extra), edamame, red onion, and cabbage. The rolls can be built the same way except it is hand rolled in seaweed paper.   I tried the spam roll with teriyaki sauce and it was delicious. The roll maintained its shape and was easy to eat. The spam was nothing special; I would have preferred for it to be cooked to a crisp for added texture. The bowl was average. I was glad to see that there were set bowl options for those who are new to the concept and cannot decide on how to build their bowl. Some of the toppings did not taste fresh to me and they skimp on the toppings (2 small scoops). The rice in the bowl was not even hot.   I will say though that the staff were friendly and always pleasant when assisting us...they always had a smile and asked us how our stay was."}
{"text":"Visiting from Houston and just needed something light to eat while walking around the Miracle Mile shops. So I tried this place without reading any of the reviews. I'm glad I did. Honestly, one of the better poke bowls I've had. The lady making the food was very nice. I had the Spam Musurrito as well and it was good. For the poke bowl, I had salmon and tuna with their yum yum sauce and eel sauce. Delicious and plentiful."}
{"text":"Although I liked the lunch I had at Poukei today, I must say they are highly over priced. You would be better off going to really any other Sushi Burrito/Bowl place in Vegas if you are a local. Before you come after me saying \"it's on the Strip, of course it will be expensive!\" I have to defend myself by stating that plenty of expensive strip food is also excellent. I'm not mad Poukei is expensive, I am mad it is not good enough for what I am paying. If you are stuck at the Planet Hollywood like I was all day and you need a fix, Poukei can give that to you, but a fix is the most you are going to get. Their logo is cute too so it can make for a good picture or two.   I had a custom sushi burrito with tuna, crab, onion, green onion, cucumber, yum yum sauce, and eel sauce. It was on the smaller side but I wasn't starving so I didn't mind. My friend ordered a bowl and was highly disappointed. Last complaint: they were out of water bottles to buy but wouldn't give us a water cup to get free water out of the soda machine. So my friend wanted water and they told him he would have to buy a fountain drink cup to get it. This is insanity to me, he just ended up going to the bar next door and getting a water but it was super inconvenient."}
{"text":"Managers sucks!!!! Can't get the order right and added extra item in our bill which we didn't order. Beware and double check your order."}
{"text":"This place was so good !!! The girl there was so nice and I told her that I wanted something spicy and she made a recommendation and I was not disappointed at all !!! I'll make sure to stop by the next time I'm in Vegas"}
{"text":"We saw all the good reviews and decided to give it a try. We both order the shoyu poke with tuna. It consisted of a base of rice, chopped tuna, (lots of) red onion and soy sauce which is first mixed and then placed on top of the rice. We felt the shoyu was plain and too salty and can be enhanced with other ingredients, the bowl had way too much red onion in proportion to the rest of the ingredients, and overall it looked like just fish, red onion and rice -- pretty plain. Looking at the menu again, it may have been better to \"build your own\" so you can get other toppings for basically the same price and have more variety in your bowl. I guess we've been too spoiled with the poke you can get in Hawaii, let alone in the Bay Area.   Sorry but not a fan."}
{"text":"The quantity, and therefore the value, of the food is hit and miss. Always tasty and fresh though."}
{"text":"Very happy with the food and service!! Everything was fresh and tasty It was also great talking to the staff as they took pride in what they were doing and what they made!  Definitely going back for more!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out because of the reviews and I expected a lot better but this place was a let down for poke for these reasons!  1. Freshness. The fish is so bland it has no natural flavors. It just felt like the fish was out there sitting for a long time and I couldn't even taste the natural fresh flavor. When I was chewing on the ahi and the skin kept peeling off, super gross! The salmon tasted off and looked odd. Maybe imitation salmon?  2. Serving size. The amount of the serving for each scoop is ridiculously small. If you're gonna order a bowl you're gonna need two scoops or more!  3. Flavoring and pricing. They didn't have that much choices for sauces so I stuck with spicy ponzu. Again it tasted bland so I just ended up adding soy sauce after for some more flavoring. The pricing on the other hand, its too expensive for the outcome. The total for the bowl was $14.95 for two scoops. On top of that you have to pay extra for seaweed salad for toppings and they barely had choices for toppings. So basically $15.45 for poke bowl that I didn't even finish because it tasted so AWFUL!!   For any tourists out there visiting vegas, you are better off going to soho sushi burrito on Sahara or to see roll on s. Rainbow. Might be a little bit of a drive but it will be so worth it!!! You will get the same amount of food for a cheaper price and better quality!!"}
{"text":"5 out of 5 loved it! Fantastic service and the price was super affordable with a great portion for the price! Will gladly return here to eat!"}
{"text":"Decided to get some poke here since I wasn't in the mood for Earl's. $17.81 for a two protein bowl. Went with tuna and spicy salmon, serving for the protein were small and sauce options were okay.  You get the option for two sauces, 4 veggies, and two toppings. Veggies were limited so went with two sides of seaweed salad, masago, and edamame.   Overall, would not come back. Not terrible but not good lol"}
{"text":"So I pass this place up every day going to work & coworkers have always talked about it.... I kinda see why but they have a couple adjustments to make lol. They're bowls are great flavors are fantastic & portions are filling but they're BEEF is TERRIBLE. I STRONGLY SUGGEST THE CHICKEN IF YOU WANNA TRY THIS PLACE."}
{"text":"Vegas cheap eats are always high on my list. This was no exception.  Walking around the strip, you can build up quite an appetite. We stumbled upon this spot while enjoying the many Vegas shops.  Admittedly, I wasn't expecting much out of this place. It does put off a \"we serve amazing food vibe.\"  I saw the \"create your own sushi burrito\" option and I was pleasantly surprised. Putting together a hodgepodge of ingredients wrapped in a sushi role was great!  I threw together some teriyaki chicken, tortilla strips, lettuce, carrots, onions, some of the many spicy sauce options (I said it was a hodgepodge didnt I.) Every ingredient just worked together very well and at a price point around $9, it was some solid Vegas cheap eats!"}
{"text":"Really good healthy food I was there couple days a go. Everything fresh very delicious  Your guys are the best food at the strip.5 star for you guys"}
{"text":"I was super disappointed with what I got. The way they served the poke was very unusual and not how it is done every other place you go. The place was very expensive and was not worth it for the amount of food you get. The vegetable options were sub-par and almost everything good you had to pay extra. Probably would not eat here again unless they lower prices and make the serving size worth the price"}
{"text":"was walking around and saw this. the fish looked like it was sitting out. the help wasnt that great. i got a tofu bowl with spicy mayo. the girl just drizxled it on top. uh ok? ya i soo wont be bsck. payed $10 for this"}
{"text":"I try this place out while staying at the Elara hotel . I was looking for something different. Oh boy this place has the weirdest poke bowl. The taste of the fish is not that fresh and portion is very small for a $16 poke bowl. I gave 2 star for the sauce they had but overall not worth the money at all!"}
{"text":"Really loved this place. We liked that you could customize exactly what you wanted in the bowl and the portions were very good too.  Definitely recommend the spicy salmon and then the tuna. We weren't sure what sauces to use but the guy at the counter was very helpful.   My friend got their spam burrito wrap thing and it tasted pretty good, but she agreed the poke was better.   The second day we are there, they were out of a couple of things which I didn't like. Restaurants should definitely be prepared for Saturday's and Sundays.   The lady who said that she was a manager was also stingier with the fish. Instead of the 3 scoops she gave others she gave me 2 which bothered me. They had also run out of water cups the second day so a different girl tried to make me buy bottled water. I really didn't like that they couldn't just give me a fountain drink cup to get the water.   The two ladies seemed stand offish and almost rude and for that reason I'm knocking one star off, but the food is great."}
{"text":"I basically had to pick 3 different things off the menu because the first two orders they didn't have an ingredient. BUT tell me why the last attempt still didn't have one ingredient that came with the order. So disappointed."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch while spending the day walking the strip. The Japanese Poke was absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"A tasty build-your-own-bowl/roll alternative to the many casual/fast food options in and around Planet Hollywood.   I ordered the two-protein bowl with tuna and salmon. The fish was fresh. Sauces -- you can choose two -- were pretty tasty. The veggies -- you can choose up to four -- were OK, but there weren't too many choices. The two-protein bowl came to $15. I thought that was a wee bit expensive, but hey, this is Vegas, right? :-)  Also ordered the octopus salad as a side. Very good, albeit a bit salty for my taste."}
{"text":"Way over priced and the portions are tiny. It taste good but not worth $14 for the amount they give"}
{"text":"Came here because it was on the strip and close to where I was staying.  Had the Korean Poke Bowl and a beer and wasn't disappointed.  I wouldn't say it's enough for a dinner but a good meal nonetheless."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS! That is the only word I would describe the Asian fusion restaurant known as, Poukei. The food was great it's a nice little stop to sit or go to if you're on the strip with friends and are on the move. The food was simple, yet packed with flavor and the personality made you want to come back for more. This restaurant was located in the Planet Hollywood Casino, it has the most amazing shopping mall located right on the strip with many sites to see.  The first menu item I got from Poukei was the Spam Poke Bowl with sticky rice with my choice of 3 veggies. The spam was nicely cut into strips and salted perfectly which went amazing with the soy sauce. The sticky rice was firm and the veggies I chose,  broccoli, corn, and carrots were nice and fresh. There was an option of chicken or shrimp but I was very satisfied with the spam entree.  For my second order I got to try something I was looking to try for quite some time. It presented the polymerization of two concepts it was a sushirrito an idea so great I would give it a Nobel peace prize. The Puukei crunch was my choice of their sushirritos it was a signature of theirs and it did not disappoint. This item had crab,panko shrimp, romaine, red onion, cucumber, yum yum sauce, and finally eel sauce, something a seafood lover would die for. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful nothing tasted canned or fake.  Some of the best foods stops are some you can walk by and pick up. This was an example of such a place you could find through Vegas's streets and venues alike.   Let's see where my taste buds shall take me next! Stay tuned!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I had my first Vegas sushirrito here. I was a little apprehensive, as all my prior experiences with poke and sushi are from the Bay Area. I was afraid this wouldn't live up to it.  I was pleasantly surprised. I ordered the Poukei Crunch roll, and my husband ordered the Firecracker. I think mine was way tastier, but they were both good and extremely filling. I thought the ingredients tasted fresh, and the service was quick. I also received a medium drink for checking in on Yelp.   It's a pretty solid option if you're on the strip and craving some poke."}
{"text":"Firecracker roll is delicious. Staff is great and the location is perfect for waiting outside Axis Theatre and needing a bite to eat waiting for those glorious glass doors to open.   Located inside Planet Hollywood Miracle Mile Shops this place is worth a stop for both Sushi Burrito Fans along with anyone who needs a quick Teriyaki Chicken Bowl."}
{"text":"I was pleased with my poke bowl and it's everything I want in a poke bowl. The only thing that tipped me off was the price and the serving size. Usually poke bowls are around $10, give or take. But this place charged me $13 for one topping and charged me extra for a special kind of vegetable. I think portion size should be a little larger for the price I paid. But the food was good in my opinion."}
{"text":"We were craving for Poke and found this poke stand in the Magic Mile mall after long searching (don't try to follow Apple maps for waking in malls...).   The poke was sufficient, fish was fresh. Sauces could have been better. There was no  classic poke sauce and the spiciness level was 0 on a scale of 1 to 5.    It was a good eat nevertheless. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Went here today and wasn't even acknowledged by the cashier who looked as if he was stocking napkins or straws, wasn't even sure if he even worked there til he went behind the counter, he had a Non logo'd shirt with a San Francisco Niners hat on. No greeting or anything. Didn't feel welcomed at all and prices are ridiculous for the portion size. He had an attitude as well. So I moved on. Too many options in Planet Hollywood and in this town to be treated like that. Work on the customer service aspect of your business and I'll feel better about paying that price Pouke."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite Japanese restaurants to go to. They always have fresh food and amazing customer service. The manager Luther and the other staff member Philip were great when it came to representing the restaurant. Also I think they're just great people as well."}
{"text":"11.95 for ONE protein?! Are you crazy, Las Vegas?!   Usually, poke places come with 2 protein MINIMUM and you're letting me choose between one or two proteins? Sure, lets just offer the least amount as possible and charge $$$ because in Vegas that's justifiable right?!  Another thing is that most poke places offer unlimited toppings, excluding the more expensive ones such as crab meat or avocado. This place offers FOUR toppings only and the toppings are so bizarre that I couldn't even choose 4. Some toppings they offered were corn, broccoli, spinach, etc, like am I at Souplantation or a poke place?!  The only saving grace here is the yum yum sauce. The poke bowl was good, but definitely experienced better in LA. That being said, the price and limited toppings are both red flags for me so I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Seems that prices are better now- all tasted fresh and only $11 for a two protein bowl which is on par with LA prices. Coming from the east coast was happy to get my poke bowl fix here. This is not Hawaiian poke though if that's what you're looking for. They do charge extra for seaweed salad :("}
{"text":"This is probably the worst poki bowl experience I've had. First they only give you one choice of protein, unlike some other places I've been to where they put 3-5. Second, it's hella expensive. $12 freakin bucks for a bowl with small portion of rice and shit load of mayo (that's all I tasted). Third, they charged me extra without warning. Unlike chipotle where if u say u want guac they automatically say it's extra dollar. This place they just put what u pointed and charge u without warning. Her defense was \"its written on the window extra charge\" with an attitude. Just wow.  In the end I ended up eating a sloppy bowl of one item crap for $14. No good."}
{"text":"Surprisingly very good poke roll in Vegas! This is located in Planet Hollywood. I ended up ordering a poke roll with salmon, cucumber, seaweed salad, red onions, spicy mayo, spicy ponzu, furikake and crispy onions.  It was a little difficult to order since it was really loud and the person helping us could barely hear us.   The poke roll is on the smaller size, so if you have a big appetite, this might not fill you up. It was the perfect size for me though!  My friends had the spicy tuna and spicy salmon as their protein and said that it wasn't spicy at all.  Free fountain drink with a Yelp check in."}
{"text":"Ein Fast-Food-Hawaiianer mit sehr leckeren Gerichten. Wir haben uns einen Sushi Burrito geordert, wo man zwischen mehreren Sorten Fish, Gemüse und Soßen wählen kann. Dann haben wir auch einen Pole geordert, wo man sich eine  Bohle Reis mach dem gleichen Prinzip zusammenstellen kann. Ich persönlich bin ein Fan der Ponzo Soße."}
{"text":"First time trying Poukei! I ended up here before a concert. The guy behind the counter was helpful at putting together my vegan bowl. I thought the food was decent. Not bad at all. But then...I continued to explore the city of Vegas and found another sushi burrito place that's more vegan-friendly, which makes my life much easier. I'll visit Poukei if it's close by, but I won't go out of my way for it."}
{"text":"I think it's getting to the end... the amount of the protein they put now is so small hahaha almost everything have an extra charge! We switch to poké poku with their buy 1 get 1 free they put much protein, they have soft shell crab for their side dish for free, then even have a free miso soup I'm so sad to say goodbye to our once favorite before"}
{"text":"Having been a fan of the original sushirritos in the Bay Area, it was nice to see more poke places utilizing this concept. At first I was going to order a regular poke bowl but I decided to try out their sushi burrito instead. I ordered the firecracker which had a nice portion of spicy tuna and salmon along with some veggies to give the roll some nice balance of flavor and texture. I thought they did a pretty good job with the burrito and I would definitely try out their other selections the next time I visit Vegas. The price point is also pretty much on par with other poke establishments that I have visited.  Overall impression; I think this is a pretty solid poke joint with some nice variations to choose from."}
{"text":"So I have to say that I actually work in the mall and eat here quite often even though the prices are a bit high there are not a lot of options when you don't have time to pack food. I love their food hence why I eat here quite often. Unfortunately tonight we ordered food again and the portion was so small it was actually pathetic. Normally the bowl is FULL but not tonight....it wasn't even half full! What a waste of time and money. I don't know what's happening to this place but it is definitely going down hill"}
{"text":"Cultural appropriation much?  Please tell me(kanaka maoli) what poukei means?  Who came up with this fake Hawaiian name?"}
{"text":"Giving 3-stars only bc I didn't try the poke, but I did get their house Vietnamese Iced Coffee in an attempt to cool off from the 120+ degree Vegas heat.   It's around $5 and let me tell you... could not have regret getting it more.   It was by far the worst Vietnamese iced coffee I've ever had. It had to have been a third condensed milk and was so sweet it made you pucker immediately. The following sugar high and headache... woof.   I think it's cool that they do their own and it's not canned, but it's done poorly to the point of being inedible, unfortunately. Hopefully they'll look at their training for how to make these and revise."}
{"text":"Bryon served me today and he was really cool in giving me what I wanted! I was looking at the firecracker roll but he told me it was more worth it to get the 2 protein sized bowl and made me a poke bowl version of the firecracker and DAMN it's lit guys!   Ask him to get it for you because it's delicious and spicy!"}
{"text":"It's a shame that I cannot rate lower than 1 star.  First of all, my initial impression of this establishment was horrible because no workers could be seen,  and none came out to take our order until I started calling for help. The food itself was very disappointing, with my poke bowl containing VERY little protein as well the accompanying ingredients. In addition, the bowl was tasteless as well as not visually pleasing. My companion,  Joe,  was also overcharged by $2 for some reason.  Lastly,  there was no water cups and there was only one trashcan that took some time to locate.  Overall,  this place presents poke in a bad light, and I would  never recommend this place to anyone,  even Trump."}
{"text":"My friends and I wanted to grab a quick bite to eat before a concert at Axis. Poukei is located right outside the concert venue, so my friends decided to eat here and I reluctantly agreed. Super casual poke place, but I decided to go with a beef bowl. The poke did not look fresh or appetizing, but my friends ordered some and luckily they didn't get sick afterwards. My beef bowl was below average and all of our bowls were drenched in whatever sauces came with our food. Had I known, I would have asked for the sauce on the side.   Next time, I'll choose where to eat. Never again."}
{"text":"Not bad poke bowls but not good enough to go back for more. It's a little pricey, but that's what you get in a mall I guess. I've have much better poke for less $$."}
{"text":"Simple, fresh and delicious! Service is fast and employees are kind and accommodating. Rice bowl, salad bowl or sushi burrito style. Three of us dining.. 2 of us got custom bowls and one beef teriyaki bowl. Custom bowls were salmon and salmon/spicy tuna mix. We were all very happy. DELICIOUS!!"}
{"text":"This food is not good. Extremely over priced. Not impressed by anything. I got a bowl and everything was very sub par. Meat is of low quality. I also got a sushi roll and it was garbage. Their \"crab\" is gross, the rice was almost the entire bowl. Don't eat here."}
{"text":"Poor protein portions and limited options.   They allow 4 vegetables and 2 toppings.  Many other places I've gone to allow unlimited toppings.  I would not go to again."}
{"text":"The whole sushi-burrito concept is big.. at least where I'm from in the Sacramento area. Its also got a very strong following in the San Francisco Bay Area. But Las Vegas? Since my lovely lady and I were staying the weekend at Planet Hollywood Hotel, I was looking for a place that was unique and most importantly, close to the live concert we'd be seeing. We ended up having front row VIP seats to Jennifer Lopez who was performing at the AXIS @ Planet Hollywood. And what made this a unanimous choice, \"Poukei\" was literally 50 feet away from the main entrance at AXIS.  The main seating area is located in the \"Miracle Mile Shops\" which is adjacent to various stores and eateries. When my lady and I arrived (which was on the evening of Saturday 9/30/17), there was actually nobody dining or even ordering for that matter. What I particularly enjoyed about this place is that it serves a variety of sushi burritos as well as build-your-own sushi burritos from the ground up. They also carry a nice variety of Poke bowls. And for the non-sushi/Poke eaters, they also offer a very generous Teriyaki menu.  I ended up ordering the build-your-own sushi burrito. The way it works is that you pick a base, protein, sauce, vegetables, and toppings. I ended up choosing Nori (seaweed) as my base, cooked shrimp as my protein, Wasabi mayo & Yum-Yum as my sauces, scallions & carrots as my vegetables, and Masago (fish eggs) & cream cheese as premium extras. I also chose Thai iced tea as my drink of choice. Total price for everything, around $12 which is a very fair price for a sushi burrito & drink on the Las Vegas Strip. My lady ended up ordering a teriyaki rice bowl.   Basically the way it works at Poukei is that they make everything in front of you; much like ordering food at Chipotle and Subway. I liked that idea since nothing was kept hidden. I was actually very impressed with my sushi burrito; the crunch of the cooked shrimp with the sticky rice and Masago definitely hit the spot. And it was very filling as the amount of food was equivalent to about 1 1/2 sushi rolls.   Overall, this is one of the only few places that actually serves sushi burritos & Poke bowls on the entire Las Vegas strip. Additionally, they also offer a nice variety of Japanese sodas, Boba drinks, and teas. The service was just so-so as the lady behind the register just seemed dull and quiet in conversing with me. However, for the freshness of the food itself paired up with excellent prices, I will have to give \"Poukei\" an above average four-star rating."}
{"text":"I had the ahi poki with brown rice and boy, it didn't taste very good at all. After having half of it, I instantly felt sick. It wasn't tasty at all."}
{"text":"As much as I wanted to give it a 5, they forgot to put the ahi tuna, it had salmon, crabs and the rest of the ingredients. It was delicious but they forgot the very first ingredient and very tight on the salmon. I might just walk to jaburitto next time - fish & rice ratio were equal."}
{"text":"I love their food. The only healthy spot in miracle mile. Glad they opened!!! Someone was giving out flyers around the mall and that's the reason why I know about the place."}
{"text":"Not very impressed to be honest. The seafood was decent, but everything else seemed below average. $2 over market value, didn't say how many scoops of protein (which wasn't very much), small portions overall, rice was hard and clumped together. My friends and I were still hungry after eating and so we decided to get food somewhere else.  I do like how they had some variety on their menu ie egg custard, Vietnamese coffee, etc. But I also think they need to make their menu smaller and focus on their main product. If you have too much variety, you spread yourself thin. I think I'm only going to stick with eating seafood near a coast."}
{"text":"What you see online is not what you get at the strip location so be prepared. Like other yelp reviews, they didn't have many of the proteins, all the bowls and burrito items listed online weren't even listed on the menu board and when we asked they just looked at us. Food quality was just ok. We're big poke lovers and this place missed the mark all together unfortunately."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I always look forward to their firecracker roll whenever we plan a trip to Vegas. For those who enjoy spicy, I'd definitely recommend this item! Ray and Misha (not sure if I spelled their names correctly) were extremely friendly and helpful!! After we paid, there was a long line that formed, but nonetheless, their customer service and food quality remains top notch."}
{"text":"Don't go.  Over-seasoned, salty and mediocre food.  It's a shame, they could do so much better.  (BTW--they are located in the Mile Mall)"}
{"text":"Don't let the construction in the mall keep you away. This place is a great fast option if you're looking for fresh and tasty seafood. My husband and I both got the build your own poke bowls and they are awesome. I would definitely get your sauce in the side so you can control it. But no complaints here!"}
{"text":"Got the yellowtail Japanese poke today and it didn't disappoint. Very flavorful and fresh bowl. Not quite a dinner portion but it is perfect for lunch time or a mid day snack! Will definitely be coming back during my time in Vegas."}
{"text":"Awesome food! The bowl is a great concept-your favorite sushi ingredients all combined in a bowl! You also have the option to get a roll instead.  I had the white sushi rice, salmon, tuna, yum yum sauce, spicy mayo, cucumbers, cabbage, Avocado purée, romaine, black seeds topping (not sure what they are) and French fried onions. Scrumptious!!!"}
{"text":"I literally eat here 3-4 days a week.  The food is fresh, has amazing flavor and is decent priced!  They have multiple options for every type of diet and the service is incredible!  This is a must try when in the Miracle Mile!"}
{"text":"The most disgusting poke I have had. Overpriced with extra charges on top. You would think $15 a bowl would taste decent but the quality of the food is severely lacking. Shrimp and fish was not fresh with hard and dry white rice. We would never eat here again even if it was free."}
{"text":"We got the Poukei crunch which was so refreshing crisp and clean and firecracker def super spicy. Loved every bite so good so fast so clean and healthy! Can't beat that. Wish there were more locations so I could keep coming back! The two gentlemen working were also very nice."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick lunner snack before dinner and ordered the Japanese poke bowl on a whim. Portion size is quite small for the price, and nowhere on the menu did they mention that it came with tuna (I wanted salmon instead, but they never asked and I was too shy to deny the tuna).  I probably would have been more satisfied with the build-your-own-bowl option as I would have gotten more sides, but I chose too quickly as I was starving. The flavor was good, but I've had better elsewhere.   Poukei is located near the Halo Bar, and the seating situation is reminiscent of food court style dining. If I was in the mood for poke again, I'll head down to the Venetian and try the one at Paris Baguette next time."}
{"text":"Poukei is a small store front inside of the mall area of Planet Hollywood. They are open every night till 11pm and 12am on Fridays and Saturdays. There is a tiny seating area with a handful of tables and chairs. The pricing was decent, cheaper than alot of the other food options.... but still pricey overall since it is Vegas :/  I ordered Japanese Poke bowl that comes with tuna, seaweed salad, red onion, masago, durikake, chili oil, Japanaese Ponzu sauce and rice. On another occasion I built my own bowl adding spam, seaweed and teriyaki sauce. The Japanese Poke bowl was good, but they give you such a tiny amount of tuna... the scooping spoon is tiny -_- The spam bowl that I built myself was average, you can't really mess up spam and rice :P The rice for both of my bowls seemed like it had been sitting out for awhile, not super fresh. This goes for most of the toppings as well. The quality wasn't terrible where I had a stomach ache or anything, but it wasn't amazingly memorable either.... somewhere in-between.  Overall I would recommend this spot due to its convenience (hours, location) and the friendly staff, but I would only recommend it as a quick, cheap (relative to Vegas food pricing) bite to eat."}
{"text":"WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE - DIDN'T EVEN GET TO EAT.  Lady in front of me ordered 3 items - took 15 minutes for those items to be made. Then, another group was about to be served by rude food server that walked up after we did, and server said I was not at the front of the line. I'm like, where's the Start Here sign and since the lady in front of me didn't wait back there for her order previously, how the heck would I know.  (The other group was standing in front of the 2\" Step 1 vinyl sign, BTW, and the other food server waiting on the lady didn't direct us back). So we spoke up, and as I go to order, they're out of chicken and Korean BBQ so we give up. But here's the kicker!!! The food server starts making rude comments about us to the folks that were allegedly ahead of us. Good Job, management of Poukei, for your customer service, and hiring a food server like that. No kindness. No understanding. Zero respect for the customer. Not even sure they were out of the two meats....well, another eatery will get the $80 I was about to spend here."}
{"text":"I love poke so I loved their poke wrap. It made me feel like I was eating healthy since I was basically eating fish with rice and vegetables. Their jalapeño sauce did have a kick to it and was deliciously spicy. I would come here again."}
{"text":"This is far from Poke!  When I first saw this restaurant I was rolling in laughter from its name, not to mention the sorry looking examples of what their Poke actually was.  If you're going to sell something folks...Get IT RIGHT!!  Including its NAME!! The most important part!  The NAME!!  Such a Mockery of what true Poke really is!"}
{"text":"Eating good on a budget- this place is awesome and is located right between PH and the Miracle Mile shops. The servings are generous, enough for two, maybe even three people (depends on how much you like to eat or how hungry you are).   I created my own sushi rice bowl with spicy salmon and spicy ahi. My toppings were cucumber, red onions, seaweed salad and edemame. I topped off my bowl with \"yum yum\" sauce which was described to me by one of the girls behind the counter as an Asian thousand island. I also drizzled spicy mayo, sesame seeds and furikake on top. It was all $15 and it was delish!  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"they had an amazing team!! the girl with the short hair is super nice, she always smiles & makes my food really presentable. they have great prices for the big portions they give. great customer service here, really worth the visit (:"}
{"text":"I went to this place. i got baja buritto with extra shrimp tempura. love the taste and fresh vegetables. i love the spicy sauce. also i got poukei bowls with korean spicy sauce. it was awesome! with salad bowl, spicy fish and vegetables.. so yummy. i like to try other food next time!"}
{"text":"Never saw an Asian roll/poke bowl stand at a mall before, so I was curious and checked this out. The counter was clean. The food looked fresh. I got the Cali roll, with crab meat, and it was very good!  The sweet tea was freshly brew and delicious, not too sweet. So happy with my take-out dinner. Tables are available by the shop. The set-up is attractive."}
{"text":"tasty&salmon was fresh, but sadly, salmon was out I had to get spicy salmon.  They were out of seaweed and masago :( and another sad thing, crab meat wasnt a topping... it was one of the protein. Well, so i had to pay 3-4bucks more for that second protein choice.  The poki places around my town always let us choose 3-5 different proteins that we want but here we only get to choose one for reg price :(  I always get spicy mayo! And i could choose another sauce and I wanted some heat so I chose some jalapeno sauce and it was delish!  My mom liked it, too The service was great! I was just little sad w some missing toppings/food."}
{"text":"When I saw the sign, I had to go and get one. When I looked around, it didn't look so appealing but I got one anyways. It's located in casino I forgot the name. When you check in, you get free soft drink. It's like a subway set up type of place. The flavors weren't there but it was enough to satisfy my growling stomach for the time being. The price is a little high for just some rice and shrimp tempura rolled up in a burrito style. It cost $12.95 but ya Vegas after all."}
