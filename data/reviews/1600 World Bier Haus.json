{"text":"I really only come here because of the patio and its proximity to the Glenmore reservoir pathway. Expensive beer (although I love seeing Scrumpy's cider on the menu) and expensive, middling food. Avoid the tapas menu altogether - it's either bland, overcooked or bewildering (horseradish sour cream) depending on the item."}
{"text":"Was very impressed with the selection of beer.  My calamari was great - friends cornbread was like eating rootbeer in a pan.  Weird...didn't like at all.

Atmosphere is great - I'll be back - but not at night as I don't want to experience Laser DJ that Joel encountered.  That would just flat out suck."}
{"text":"Not too much to add to the other reviews really.

Nice place, good service, great food, fair prices for the fare, and a nice patio when the sun is shining"}
{"text":"This was by far the worst meal and service I have ever received. The waitress was new so I have some sympathy but we were forgotten about and after waiting 50 minutes for our food the avocado toast was by far the worst thing I have attempted to eat in my life. The eggs were cold and pre cooked, toast was wet focaccia bread and the tomato jam was lame. We also had wings at the table that were almost cooked. 

We told the manager he discounted the avocado toast but I still paid for those cold eggs. 

Sorry for the crap tip but you gotta work harder. 

I plan to never return."}
{"text":"Can't beat the selection of beers and the servers we have had have been very knowledgeable and always willing to bring you a taster. We've gone twice now on Sundays before a movie and thoroughly enjoyed each visit. Ate 1/2 order of nachos, 20 9 cent wings and couldn't finish. Yesterday had five beers between us and the food and it came to just over $40 - where can you beat that that is clean, nicely decorated with good service? Will be back."}
{"text":"The restaurant is great for it location and choice of beers.  The food here is overpriced and not worth the money.  I have tried several different items on the menu and the only one i like is the baked brie.  Nachos are bland and you basically have to get extra cheese as barley any comes on it.  The salsa tastes like tomatoes out of a can....no flavour.  The fajitas also have no flavour, the muscles are not worth the money, the pizzas are soggy.  

I would recommend driking here but not eating here"}
{"text":"Unfortunately I feel the food at this place is going down hill.  Particularly the french fries.  They are dark, greasy and soggy.  Management was told of this but no change in last 3 weeks.  I think it is a combination of dirty fat and not high enough fat temperature such that too much oil is absorbed. I use to be a regular there."}
{"text":"I have not had a bad time at 1600. Most of my visits have been for Sunday brunch and they have lots of TVs showing NFL football which is great. Prices are a little high, but where isn't nowadays? The staff are out of this world and the manager Kraig is very welcoming, friendly and engaged. He came by, made sure we were enjoying our meal and asked if there was anything he could do. When my friend asked for something that wasn't on their menu, he ran back and grabbed it and didn't even charge us. 

The location is both good and bad. It's in a busy little strip mall in a trendy area which isn't great, but it's right beside the scenic Glenmore reservoir which is nice to walk along. 1600 is like most of the beerhouses that are en vogue right now. Haven't seen what it's like on a Friday or Saturday night, but definitely recommend going for the food and the friendly service."}
{"text":"Tried this place with my family for Saturday lunch.  Was immediately put off by the prices, but the atmosphere was pleasant and the waitress seemed very friendly.  Food took ages to come out and was pretty bland.  I guess they can justify the high prices ($20 for a burger?!?) with the two sides, but my meal was luke warm and boring.  Save your ductets for somewhere else."}
{"text":"I went to 1600 for wings a few weeks ago on a Wednesday. To our surprise, there was a short wait of about 10 minutes for a table. As we were waiting, the host came by with sample glasses of different beers for us to try! Such a nice touch! 

We were seated promptly, and ordered beers from their daily special. For wings, we were slightly perplexed to find that the menu only had four types! The waitress later explained that they did have all of the regular `classic` wing flavors as well. We ordered the Greek, Montreal garlic, and BBQ wings, with an order of sweet potato fries. 

The BBQ wings were standard, nothing special, but holy god, were the Greek and garlic wings amazing! The fries were also great! 

My only complaint, and it is small, is that we were surprised to learn that the Greek and Montreal garlic wings were twice as much as the BBQ! Apparently since they were on the menu under a speciality wing, they still qualify for the Wednesday wing specials, but are a slightly higher price. Don't get me wrong, they were absolutely worth an extra $2, but it would have been nice to know that when we ordered. 

Overall, amazing experience! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I really don't like this place.

Any place that wastes manpower on a hostess that you have to wait for in order to get permission to sit in an authorized place better have competent waiters to back that up. Otherwise, you're just creating another choke point in the flow of mediocrity. Which is the case every time I visit here

I like the beer selection, but the food and service is soooo meeediooocccreeee. The pastas, burgers, nachos. Bland. And not justified by the price. $20 for nachos without meat or guac? If you're not convinced, just look at the menu critically. This place touts the \"fresh, original, delicious\" schtick, but it just comes off pretentiously. And not just because the food sucks. You can get \"Northern California Poutine\" (just like how SFO yuppies love it at their local poutinery in SOMA!) or \"Baked Lobster Bree\" (caught daily from the Bow). It's phony. It sucks.

The last time we went, the waitress was more inattentive than the inattentiveness we are used to at 1600. This is because her zone seemed to be the whole patio and a little section inside. We had to flag down the hostess to get us more drinks or extra salsa with our medicore nachos (credit to them, sadly, but they used fresh jalapenos on the nachos. Yep, that's right, they spent $0.10/jalapeno and cut it up. Sadly, that is praiseworthy). But when they brought the salsa out (not after reminding her) the nachos were extra medicore because they were cold. But they were sure to ring it in and charge us $2 for the salsa. I'd bitch and moan about this, but, the waitress was never around.

When we eventually got the bill, we saw they overcharged us for a bunch of beers that were on special. And the salsa we never consumed because it took 20 minutes.

Honestly, why can't bars just convert to the UK model: put everyone behind the bar. When you want a drink or food, walk up and get it yourself. It would benefit everyone. Really. It would. You think one place in a city of one million could think \"outside\" the box.

I'm going to use my final groupon on this place and I will never again eat or drink out at a tavern in calgary ever again. Seriously. I mean it. 'cept Moose McGuires."}
{"text":"They are approaching a 4 but aren't quite there yet.

First of all it is nice to have 1600 as a neighbourhood option as it is a lot nicer than some of the local pubs. Beer selection is great and the food menu for the most part is tasty and well prepared. For example, I like that sandwiches come with two sides so I have an easier time choosing. Most of the appies are tasty - and I'm a fan of the burgers.

The reason they cant quite get to four stars is the service. Some of the servers are awesome and their others...wellllll maybe they should stay home. Ive had experiences with a few who are just plan AWOL for most of the visit. My personal fave was the one we asked for details from about the beer tasting dinners (that was happening that night) and she shrugged, grunted and pointed at a table where people were having it. We asked for clarification (lol) and she walked away.

If the service was a bit more consistent, I'd probably go a bit more. Nevertheless this is a great spot to meet friends, go on a date or celebrate the weekend."}
{"text":"one of the best filet mignons I've had in Calgary!. great vibe. friendly environment. Very affordable pricing considering how good the food is!. wish I could have complemented the chief that night!. also lots of TVs. lots of girls. fun fun fun.... all the waitresses were super friendly and very attractive!!!. hostess was on top of her game that night helped me and my party out as soon as we walked in And sat us down within minutes!!. drinks came fast and were never empty!!. 

a very easy earned 5 Stars!!!! *****"}
{"text":"Went there tonight after horrific service at Woody's in Braeside. Server (Ava?!) was amazing. Always love this place. Def recommend!"}
{"text":"When did this place go so downhill!?!?!  Service and food were bad. We came with a party of 6 and planned to stay for a nice dinner and drinks, however we left after our first round.  Mediocre at best."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here one afternoon as I was craving a good steak and a good beer, but what we experienced was less then impressive. 

We walked in and got seated fairly quickly and we were told our server would be right over... 15 minuets later (as we were about to leave and take our business elsewhere) our sever showed up at our table. We both ordered a mixed beer, she had the Berry Float and I had the White Summer and they were excellent drinks, but I can make them at home. 

For our food she ordered the Philly Cheesesteak sandwich and I ordered the Steak Sandwich. There was to much bread on both our dishes... in fact my $20 6oz steak sandwich was absolutely disappointing. The steak appeared to be an end cut and looked like a sausage, there was about double the amount of garlic toast to the steak (I will post a picture as well). We patiently waited for our server to come check on us and we waited and waited and became less patient, Finally I decided to eat this disappointment because I was starving. We had made it about 3/4 the way through our food before our server came over and \"checked on us\", I say it like that because she literally started to walk up... and as she walked by she smiled and gave us a thumbs up and walked away to check on a different table...the one 2 away from where we were sat. Now I understand being busy as I am a server as well...but still don't just walk by and give us a thumbs up....because clearly we were not in a \"thumbs up\" kind of situation. Once our server came to clear our plates I made a comment about the size of the steak and that I was a bit disappointed but not looking for anything off the bill, she proceeded to tell me that they would cover my beer, which admittedly made me happy. When she brought the bills over my bill had a \"VIP\" discount of 10% ($2 and change) and my friend had been double charged for her side. When my friend asked the server about the double charge she said that was right because she got a double order of sweet potato fries and her dish came with 2 sides.... NOWHERE ON THE MENU DOES IT STATE YOU GET 2 SIDES AND OUR SERVER NEGLECTED TO INFORM HER OF THIS... needless to say we will NEVER go back there with the poor service and overpriced food. 

I would not recommend eating here, Calgary has much better restaurants at much better prices and with much better service."}
{"text":"Patio is dope, kid friendly , walking distance  to Glenmore    reservoir so you  can walk off their awesome  nachos."}
{"text":"We've been regulars at 1600 for a few years. They just changed their beer options & menu. No more tapas, much more expensive, double patty hamburgers on Thursdays (sorry we're not football players) rather than their delectable steak sandwiches (which are now almost double the price). The fantastic draft beers are gone (Dunkel we love you) and there's never live music anymore (from way-back when). The wife said the salads are boring now - same as everywhere else just maybe a tad more expensive for the small quantity at 1600. 

We've been told Buzzards in Lake Bonavista has a better selection of beers on tap now with good weekday specials. The staff I'm sure will continue to be fantastic at 1600 but this place needs a good review now from John Gilchrest to shed light on that new crappy menu.

Going to find another place to hang out."}
{"text":"I have always had great service here! Food is almost always great. Only a couple times did I have something I didn't like. The nachos didn't have much stuff on them, I'm not sure if they have the fish and chips still but they were very greasy. Nice environment for the most part. Absolutely love the summer here, they have a nice patio. Looking forward to those warm days again sipping on a drink on the patio. I feel bad for the girls having to dress in really short tight black dresses....obviously that helps with business though but doesn't show much respect to the women. Overall though, I do like the food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch yesterday. Seated very quickly. Appetizers (cesar salad, and the spicy chicken soup) came out amazingly well. A manager ( i assume) came out with fresh ground pepper. It was wing night, so we ordered wings. bartenders bbq. my waitress said it was like a honey garlic, and i asked if it was spicy. she said no, so i ordered a pound. the burger and the wrap the table ordered came out a couple minutes later. After everyone had finished eating my wings still hadnt shown up. I grabbed a passing manager who apologized profusely and told me the wings hadnt gotten ordered. Mistakes happen :) 
so finally i got the wings. and they were spicy. probably a 6/10. i couldnt eat them because they would have upset my stomach. I didnt want to cause anymore grief so i simply paid the bill and left. 
4/5. Amazing food, but needs to be more specific on what the flavours of wings are."}
{"text":"World Beir Haus has a hefty beer menu-both on tap and bottle from all over the world. Unfortunately they caught me on a night where I didn't feel too adventurous. I still ended up trying one of their specials, some Belgian fruit beer that really wasn't even beer at all, just tasted like juice. I didn't finish it and ordered my trusty pint of Alexander Keiths. 

The nachos were okay, the ingredients were fresh but it seemed...too neat. Nachos should be messy and chaotic and filled with crap and whatever decided to crawl on there during the microwaving process. Still i liked how they gave a heaping side of salsa and sour cream. We also ordered some yam fries which was a bit more satisfying given that the dipping sauces were tasty and rich in SALT.

The waitresses  or \"guns for hire\" were sub-par in attention. They were neither rude nor engaging. Also not too knowledgeable in their beer selections. We sat in the booth and wished we were at the bar area more which seemed more engaging. That was another the thing about this place, it either wanted to be a loud bar-type resto found in central Calgary or just as the local pub. Still considering the area it's located in, I suppose its a welcome addition to the area."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I love the food, although I dislike the new menu changes every other week. Friendly staff, quick turn around for food and children friendly. Can't go wrong with this place!"}
{"text":"There are a few pubs closer to my place than 1600, but none of them can match the amazing selection of beers. All of my favorite UK beer is on tap which is rare in Calgary. 

The food selection is above average for a pub and I have yet to be let down on an order.  Can't really go wrong with the: greek ribs, wings, nachos, any of the burgers, or more nachos. The nachos are fantastic. I have also been in and enjoyed their weekend brunch too!

If you have similar requirements of a 'neighborhood pub' as I do, this place is a lifesaver!

My only complaint is that they aren't busy enough on weekends, and seems to clear out around 11. I don't get it. Stay for another round people!"}
{"text":"Good pub food, tacos were good, French toast 2 large thick slices with 2 eggs, bangers and salad
Omelette kind bland and small
Chicken Brie and fig jam yummy with 2 sides made for a takeout"}
{"text":"7 of us go out for drinking there, so funny the waitress came to us with very SAD face and took us to area that we supposed to sit. She asked about drink and we order them, one of my friend order Coffee and ask if it is refillable or not, but suddenly the waitress said: if just one person drink it will be refillable.
This is the first time during these 10 years leaving in Canada somebody acting like that. My friend told her; you are better to go and worked in kitchen. Finally manager came to us and showed that the management had same attitude like the waitress. We were very nerves and upset about their behaviors and customer service, It seems they can't tolerate immigrant people there."}
{"text":"Bier Dinners at 1600 World Bier Haus are quite the cultural experience!

I had the pleasure of attending one of the 1600 World Bier Haus' Belgium Beer Dinners, which is a five course dinner, paired with five Belgium Biers for $55.

http://www.1600bierhaus.com/Announcements/tabid/11245/Default.aspx

The first course was a Seafood Gratin with Baby Sea Scallops and baby prawns wtih a dliirium tremens cream sauce.  The beer pairing was also a Delirium Tremens.  I am not a big seafood fan, so I only had a few tastes.  The gratin and cream sauce was pretty yummy.  I went to the event with a friend of mine, and she absolutely LOVED it, since she is a big seafood lover, so she gratefully ate hers, and the rest of mine with a big \"thumbs up\".  

Course two was a Fruli infused goat cheese with candied pecans & grapes, on a bed of micro greens drizzled with a fruli verjus.  This salad was unbelivable!  The fruli infused goat cheese was absolutely heavenly.  I would love to see this salad end up on their permanent menu!  They could count on me ordering it every time I came into the restaurant!  This was paired with Fruli, which is a strawberry beer.  I am not a huge beer drinker, so this one was my favorite.  Aside of the fact that it smelled delicious and tasted just as good, it is also low in calories.  It is equivalent to that of a light beer.

Course three was a black currant sorbet with a de koninck slush.  The sorbet was delicious.  The beer slush on top was an unexpected addition, and the salty slush, paired with the black current sorbet was a neat combination!.  The beer pairing was a De Koninck.

Course four was a Delirium Nocturnum braised beef and truffle cannelloni.  The actual braised beef was delicious.  It was tender and full of flavor.  Delirium Nocturnum was the beer pairing.  For my palate, it was quite bitter, so if you like bitter beer, this one is for you! '

The fifth course, dessert was a vanilla bean and Affigem cheesecake wtih flambe bananas and banana compote, with the beer pairing of Affligem.  The flambe bananas and whip cream were to die for!  I didn't find the cheesecake sweet at all.  I believe the Affligem took a lot of the sweetness out, to make it almost a bitter taste, which was a neat contrast with the flambe bananas.  Very cool combo!

What was pretty cool about this experience, was that the beer rep was there to tell us about the beers we were trying, and also, the Chef was also explaining how the dishes we were trying were prepared, so there was an education piece as well.  Well done 1600 Bier Haus, for putting on a truly unique experience for beer drinkers!"}
{"text":"Beer selection is good and the beer specials are always a good deal. Food is nothing special. Just build the burger and be done with it.  What brings me back to this place is the location. I live close to downtown and we have many friends in the south and Deep South. This pub's location is invariably the closest thing there is to a half way point between."}
{"text":"Everytime I have ever been here, it's been too busy for good service. The beer is good, of course. The food is OK. The servers are trying their best, but the staff to customer ratio is just wrong. The worst part is the bottleneck in the kitchen. This kitchen just cannot produce volume at pace when the restaurant is slammed. One would think that this would change eventually, but it has not. I have been a customer here for several years. This issue has not been addressed."}
{"text":"I like the location, ambience, and selection at 1600 Bier Haus. The selection is outstanding, the staff is friendly, and the patio is awesome in the middle of summer. I started going here with a colleague, and it's a great space to have a conversation over lunch. The boccocini salad is particularly good, and the beer selection is awesome (you can't really beat it). I also really enjoy the yam fries with all of their dips.

I can't comment on anything that is regular pub fare, however, as I'm a pescetarian and don't eat wings or ribs or anything of that nature. I have enjoyed what I've had though and it's a restaurant I keep coming back to."}
{"text":"If you've ever dined at Roosevelt, 80th & Ivy or 1410 World Bier Haus then you can expect a similar experience and a lot of the same from 1600 World Bier Haus. Why? Because all four of these restaurants are owned by the Hospitality Group 933. In particular 1410 and 1600 are basically identical in their offerings. I've also reviewed 1410 which I gave 4 stars, naturally I'm giving 1600 4 stars as well. However if I had to choose between the two I prefer 1600. 1410 is notoriously loud and noisy and can feel a bit crowded. 1600 on the other hand has a much larger dining space that feels more intimate and relaxed. 1410 has a cool rooftop patio, but again it's a bit squishy and really the view isn't that great. The 1600 patio is massive and right next to the beautiful Glenmore reservoir; I definitely prefer this patio over 1410s rooftop!

The beer selection at 1600 is fantastic, one of the better places in the city for a big craft beer selection. They have these really cool beer and cider combinations as well that I'd definitely recommend trying out for a summer drink; they also have mini-yards and boots. Another great plus is their specials are usually a decent premium beer, not the usual cheap domestic special you find elsewhere; it was Mill Street Organic and Last Best IPA on my most recent visits. One thing I will mention is that the beers are priced higher than your usual domestic choices, more of a $7-9 beer place and not a $5-6 beer.

Their menu is really well rounded and very affordable despite offering items I'd consider to be more of the gastropub variety rather than conventional pub variety. Similar to Original Joes and State and Main they also offer two sides with all sandwiches and burgers, I love this option because sometimes it's hard to choose just one side :D lol...  They usually have daily food specials as well which can save you some money. I had the Apple Bacon & Brie on my most recent visit, great flavor combo and very tasty. On my prior visit it was the Buffalo Chicken Wrap which is always a safe bet. The fries here are solid. There are also a ton of gluten-free options here!

Service was solid on my last two visits; warm and inviting which complemented the atmosphere. For some reason the service also feels more authentic at 1600 vs 1412, I just get a bit of a fake vibe at 1412 (maybe because it's DT and attracts a different clientele). The food is always pretty solid and fairly priced, and the drink selection is awesome. Very close to 5 starts for me, just haven't had the WOW experience quite yet!"}
{"text":"Wow, what an improvement over the last dump of a place that was here!

Very nice decor, new tvs, and cute waitresses, what else do you need?  Oh yeah....BEER.

They have many beers on tap, and different daily specials.  Always fun to try new beers, but you will soon come to find your favorite.

Decent food options also - for supper, try a burger, or the amazing ribs.

Really busy on weekends."}
{"text":"Live in the area and regularly walk here.  Good selection of beers, wines and spirits.  Every server we have ever had, has been knowledgeable on drinks.  Food is good but a little expensive.  If it were a little less pricey would probably make this a regular dinner hang out.  Right now just for drinks."}
{"text":"I swear the price of burgers and fries keep going up every time I eat out. I was complaining about how expensive this city has gone with $15 burger and fries in my other reviews and 1600 punched me in the gut with their price of $19. So painful.

We came here on a Thursday night for $1 oysters and $13 burger and fries specials. I can't really comment on the oysters 'cause I don't eat them enough but you have the choice of ordering the east or west coasts. Fries were hand-cut which is different from other pubs but the portion was small. I ordered the World Burger which included 2 patties, bacon, mushrooms, and onion. The burger was tasty but greasy. The patties were tender. I also enjoyed my $11 imported beer. I'm not much of a beer guy so I can't comment too much on it but they seem to have a large selection of imported beers. Finally, we shared a $9 chocolate mousse cake which wasn't too sweet, thankfully.

I wouldn't come here if the burgers weren't on special. It definitely has one of better pub food in town but it's just so expensive for what it is and hence, my 2 stars. They should rename their burger 'Toonie-per-Bite Burger'."}
{"text":"Great food.  Great drinks.  Ultra friendly service.  Downtown venue in the burbs!!"}
{"text":"1600 World Bier Haus still sucks...but Groupon rocks! I told them about what happened and they refunded my groupons and apologized within a day. Way to go Groupon!"}
{"text":"Dear 1600,

I want to like you so bad. I like your counterpart, 1410. It's got charming servers and owners, a reasonable atmosphere (when it's not chalk full of douchebags) and on the whole the food is pretty good.

And 1600, you'd be the exact same, except for one enormous flaw that is quite literally possible to ignore:

Laser DJ.

Like Honey Badger, Laser DJ don't care. Laser DJ don't give a shit. If you roll in on a Friday night, you can behold the ear-piercing wonder that is Laser DJ.

Earlier in the night, things seem normal. Safe. The waitresses are in their typical \"tight and black\" wear, the food is normally pretty solid (if not pricey) and the atmosphere is that of a sort of upscale sports lounge. 

But then comes Laser DJ. Suddenly your meal is interrupted by a high pitched PEW! PEW! PCHEW PCHEW PCHEW!

And next thing you know, Laser DJ is spinning 90's hits for a Baby Boomer/Gen X split crowd at eardrum shattering decibels for the zero people who are actually dancing. In between each and every song you hear, Laser DJ will press the \"lasers n' shit\" button on his turntable and assault your ears with the same horrific laser noises. Why?

Because Laser DJ doesn't care if you enjoy your dinner. He doesn't care if nobody can talk to the person next to them. He doesn't even care that there isn't any dance floor. He came for one reason and one reason only: to play nostalgic hits accompanied by whimsical sci-fi noises - and you'll be damned if you try to stop him.

Eventually a few moms will get drunk enough to stagger around the room and awkwardly shake their hips.Somehow, a drunk guy who rode in on his motorcycle despite it being -30 outside will find them, lambast them with his creepiness and promptly return to his plate of extremely expensive wings. The whole scene is just too awkward. 

1600, please fire Laser DJ. If you do, your establishment will be a much better place to spend a weekend night."}
{"text":"1. Poor atmosphere (DJ's on a Saturday night? I didn't go there to get my dance on! Don't be something you're not)
2. Bad service (goes along w/ the music being too loud to take an order)
3. Poor bartending (Bartenders don't know there basic cocktails. sir a Manhattan is a basic martini, no it's not an old fashioned and it shouldn't come w/ ice)
4. Poorly prepared and over priced food (burgers slapped together w/ way to much sauce! Not to mention much too salty to finish. My opinion on salads is it should be light and crispy, not soggy and over dressed. Why do you continue to serve the most plain quinoa the city has to offer?)

All in all I've been disappointed w/ 1600 a few times but after tonight's udder failure on all levels on what makes an establishment what it is! I will not be back again. On a side note to your existing customers. Stop charging so much for slightly above mediocre pub fair. There's pubs close by that stick to there guns and serve a better product at reasonable prices without offering bland quinoa or soggy fancy salads."}
{"text":"First things first, I would say this is a 3 1/2 star resto but as Yelp won't let me give the extra 1/2 star....  The menu is affordable, good value and flavorful for the most part. The beer selection is outstanding, and service by the extremely lovely and plesant gals are a pleasure throughout my visits.  The brunch menu is also of especial note, and well worth the relaxing trip on the weekends. Tthere are some hits and misses.  The pastas, seafood and burgers are excellent, but the ribs have been lifeless and can at best be compared to boiled meat marinated in a sweet sauce.  Salads are a bit uninspired as well, but then, I suppose their focus would be the beer and pub food.  I enjoy going here regularly, and being larger than it's sister resto, 1410 on 17th Ave SW, it's far more enjoyable to be here as well.  Check their site for the monthly seafood themed dinners (this month is King Crab Legs) and their daily specials.  My team and I are fans of their wings night!

By the by, I've been informed that their food manager left a few months back, and now getting other feedback from others on how the standards have dropped as a result.  Considering the dull salad and the miserable ribs, this would explain a lot, but luckily hasn't affected everything yet.  Standards people!  If you're going to charge $14-$30 for the food, the standards have to be kept up!"}
{"text":"Not very pleased. Calamari was advertised as crispy and the plate I got was not even close to crispy more like wet noodles.
I ordered a rice noodle bowl that was a cold noodle dish that surprised me as the noodles and vegetables were few and far between.
Service was poor when we wanted some assistance for pepper servers were standing around when we got up to look at other tables they ignored us. Dinner was mixed up for the couple we were with side dishes were not on same plate as meal ordered. Hamburgers were served with cold buns.
The only good thing was the beer. 
Not a place to eat or expect good service."}
{"text":"People call in sick, or you're short staffed for some reason or another. But to have a table wait 40 min after ordering a beer to only have to order it a second time with another waiter/waitress is ridiculous. Did I mention the beer never came? I decided to leave after nearly an hour... for fear of ordering lunch and eating it at dinner. 

Normally this place is a go-to for me. Sometimes the service is a bit slow but the food and beer are great! Unfortunately I didn't experience either today. 

Might give it another shot, might not."}
{"text":"I have been here before, but last night the man and I had tickets for their Co-Op Beer Dinner.   Let me just say, it was amazing.   $60 for 4 courses, and 4 full pints of some really unique Belgian Beers.

The chef came out to explain how he incorporated the beer into everything, the parsnips, the lamb was marinated for 24 hrs, the tiramisu - EVERYTHING.   It was a delicious evening."}
