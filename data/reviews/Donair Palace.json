{"text":"I love this place.  I often get the Donair platter.   It fills me up and the hummus is great.  The Donair shop is mostly family run and often comes with a smile.  I'll be back again!"}
{"text":"It is not worthy of the lofty Palace designation, it is more like a donair suburban bungalow.   The regular chicken shawarma was the size of a small loaf of bread but I much prefer quality over quantity and the chicken itself lacked a high level of quality. There was no evidence of any meat on spits, my chicken came out of the fridge and had to be microwaved - boo! There was no shortage of vegetables, but the shawarma maker was a little heavy handed with the sriracha. I like heat but fire- hot lettuce is weird.  This place is located right across the street from a high school and I can see it being very popular with teenagers with huge appetites. Maybe during the school year there is more food turnover so they can serve fresh chicken off of the spit but otherwise, I would look elsewhere for a tasty shawarma. 2.5 stars."}
{"text":"It's a donair stop. Nothing more, nothing less.  I was in the area looking for a quick bite so I stopped by Donair Palace. I had vague memories of my friends while back in high school at Sir Winston Churchill telling me about this donair place they liked. I thought I'd put vague high school memories together with my over 10 years since then experience in eating and drinking my way through Calgary to the test and check them out. The Result: Yah, It's alright. It's a donair stop. Nothing more, nothing less.  The pitas taste like the usual suspect and the lettuce and tomatoes look and taste like they came from a Subway(r) restaurant. They heat the chicken up in the microwave, it tastes bland but ok and there're a few pieces of gristle to deal with.  The quality is nothing to write home about and they're not the cheapest donairs out there either. Pricing in at $8, they're right on par with some of the best tasting places in town. They're a decent and typical for Calgary size.   They've got student specials on until 3:30PM.   If you're in the area and hungry for a donair, sure, why not. But I definitely wouldn't go out of my way and I'd be happy to give a chance to another one of the shops in the same strip mall instead of going back."}
{"text":"I started eating at Donair Palace 6 months ago because I wanted to try a new donair joint. Plus, it was closer to where I live. I got hooked on this after eating one. The donair meat may be a bit on the medium done side, but it was the way I wanted it to be. Most donairs are pretty soft which sometimes make you wonder if it's been cooked right. The staff is really cool. After being pretty much a regular there they took half price of what I was paying for or even gave me free pizza. I would recommend this to anyone who is in the mood for donairs. It may not be Jimmy's, but for anyone living in the NW near Market Mall or near Churchill and want to go in a close donair place then this is it."}
{"text":"I do not like to post negative reviews but I feel if you decide to open a restaurant or food service you should have a passion for the food you serve. This place has zero integrity for the food they are serving. I ordered two falafels and they were more like completely dry cold crumbling pucks of flavourless debris. The vegies were on the verge of rotten. The sauces were basic with the only highlight being sriracha. When I saw the cook crumble the sad \"falafel\" over my pita I almost wanted to cancel my order. Avoid this place and spend your hard earned lunch money elsewhere."}
{"text":"The donair here is pretty big. They put lots of sauce on it. It's a block away from Awesome Pizza which also serves donair. It's really worth the skip and a hop to get it here instead. I like that they give the donair an extra squirt of sweet sauce after it has been wrapped. Be sure to order the giant size, although I'm tempted to get the size bigger."}
{"text":"Waste of time and money. I was really starving and I bought a slice of dinair pizza and a large beef donair. The place was very deserted and had no signs of edible things.  The donair was pre stored. The sandwich was served cold. He did not have a sandwich toaster.   I ended up trashing half the sandwich and wat only couple of bites from the pizza."}
