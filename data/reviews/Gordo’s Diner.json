{"text":"The breakfast is fantastic. The service is quick and friendly. They have some great tasting homemade items on the menu. Always leave feeling satisfied."}
{"text":"What a little gem of a place. I stopped in here after shopping at Ikea just south of here. I ordered eggs home fries and toast. The wait staff were great, food was hot and delicious, good price, not much of a wait time. 
If I'm back in this area I would definitely return."}
{"text":"I've been to Gordo's Diner a couple of times after work and must say I love their kind service and great food. I had their Sausage, bacon and ham (3.59 sides) with their french toast (6.99). They are the only breakfast place even that opens late. I am a huge fan of their All Day Breakfast meal. Their price in Vaughan is cheap compared to places like Spin Cafe (a chain restaurant in woodbridge). 

I found not only are the staff friendly and they have great customer service but they put their faith and trust in customers. They quickly had my name memorized and made you feel like a regular customer. I was very touched from the bad week I've been experiencing at other retailers. I complained and told stories about my bad week to everyone I could because I felt like I was treated unfairly and soon felt like Gordo's Diner was a second home to me. I was very happy to have found Gordo's Diner and to be honest, who doesn't love All Day Breakfast places?!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Food is good and staff is friendly. Very accommodating menu options and sides. Try the strawberry banana milkshake, cinnamon swirl pancake and apple pie. Every breakfast i had was loaded with food. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Been coming here for awhile now. The breakfast is quality and is good portions the staff is friendly also. The burger is really good I love to come here for dinner and breakfast."}
{"text":"If you feel like some good old greasy diner food this place is it. Their French onion soup is fabulous! Better then most restaurants I've tried (including posh fancy ones). I've been here a few times for lunch as it's one of the few restaurant in the area and it doesn't disappoint. Portions are huge so you always end up packing half home."}
{"text":"One of rather few options in the immediate surrounding area (although some new eateries have opened up on the opposite side of the street in the last few years). We did a group lunch here since it was one of the few options location-wise that could accommodate a group for lunch of about 6 people with sit-down service yet casual atmosphere. 

It's a very typical diner, with 50's & 60's decor and memorabilia (including juke machines at some of the tables which, unfortunately, can't actually play music and aren't to be handled by customers).

It's almost boring to write a 3 star review which tells you everything you need to know - it's your average diner with average service, average food, average prices. Don't get me wrong there's nothing particularly bad or wrong with the place, but it really was just average in every way - some of the food items weren't very hot, return service when asking for items like water, creamers, ketchup, etc. was not quick, and so on in every way, down to the waiting for and paying of the bill.

Its real strength is its lack of obvious competition at this intersection, since the area has only starting really expanding recently with the opening of the new subway station. This diner has been here much longer and they have \"home advantage\" because of it, so, if you're in the area, it'll do."}
{"text":"Great portion sizes! The best hash browns(as they are actually fresh potatoes) 
I usually get the side fruit cup, which is always fresh and delicious and a very generous portion. 
We've been going here for a couple years now and still find its the best value/service/quality compared to all others in vaughan!"}
{"text":"Food is okay but the service is not. 

I have been here to sit down twice and each time the waitress was non existent after your meal was served. 

The prices are average and so is the food. Go to the Galaxy Diner or Kotsy's instead."}
{"text":"Not worth the trip but if in area want just plain food then maybe.  Had eggs Benny. Four small eggs but three of them over cooked yoke   had fruit cup with the hardest watermelon I have ever had. Service good but food lacking price high for quality. Will not be around long when competition moves into area"}
{"text":"Definitely not my fist pick. The service is  pretty slow compared to other places in the area and you  an easily wait 20 min for a salad. 
Taste wise is was ok, but nothing special really.
If you want to set down in peace and quiet for an hour this will do, but be prepared to pay more for the service."}
{"text":"Good food. Excellent sized portions for the money. Very cool ambience. Definitely a return trip will be scheduled."}
{"text":"opened at 8:30am. lots of parking.
Booths seating can be rough on your back. Nice themed diner,  nice for families. (highchairs)
coffee/free refills $2.25
Average breakfast $10"}
{"text":"This place never fails to satisfy.
Great atmosphere and something for everyone on the menu.
Friendly staff, good parking and the food is good.
Don't let the exterior fool you, it may not look like much outside but it's worth a visit."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a while, so on Sunday, decided to check it out to see if anything had changed.
When we arrived, there was one person in front of us waiting for a table. A waitress (dark black hair) acknowledged us and advised us that it would be around a 5 - 10 minute wait for a table. Cool. As the only place to really wait is at the door, we stood behind the guy waiting. He was seated about 2 minutes later, so we stepped up to where he stood. Then another couple came in and stood behind us, then another couple with a 4 or 5 year came in. The last couple decided to cut in front of everyone else and stood closest to the counter, I guess because she thought that they'd skip the line and get seated first. She went to the counter and told the person there that were 3 of them.
Sure enough, a waitress (who cleared a dirty table), yelled over specifically for \"the woman in the purple coat\" (the last couple to arrive but who positioned herself at the front of the line) to come over. My 14 year old niece said to the woman in the purple coat (as she started to walk towards the table)  \"I don't think so\" and the waitress who saw us there first (the girl with the black hair) corrected the mistake and told the woman in the purple coat that there were two groups to be seated before them and she called us over instead. You'd think that it would be the end of it.....nope. Our waitress comes over to our table (the girl who cleaned the table and called over the other customer) and yells to the other waitress ..\"who are these people...I called over the woman in the purple coat\". She did this while standing right in front of us. Talk about making a customer feel unwelcome. Thankfully, the server who was monitoring the line up at the door repeated again that we were next in line and that the person she called over had only been waiting about a minute. Our waitress wasn't impressed and our service certainly showed that she was pissed. I don't know if she knew the other people or not, but our service was certainly substandard after that. We waited far too long for her to come and take out order (we actually thought of going to the counter to order), coffee was not refilled (we had to ask another server for a refill...twice), she couldn't remember who ordered what (we were only a table of three) when our food came out, cream was not replenished, she never checked on us ....she certainly made our table of three feel unwelcome. 
Anyways, I ordered a grilled cheese sandwich (that had cheese sprinkled on the outside of it) with bacon and a side of home fries. My niece ordered a BLT with fries and the 3rd person ordered a BLT with a side of home fries. The food was very good and there was more than enough of it.
While eating our bkfst (which, by the way, I really enjoyed) someone came out of the kitchen and we overheard him saying to one of the other staff members that he was worried how the soon-to-open Denny's would affect their business. 
While the food was good,count this person as someone who will definitely try Denny's before returning here....the service (at least by or waitress) was downright awful."}
{"text":"I can't believe I just spent $21.00 on undercooked home fries and flavourless French toast. The extra star is purely for the environment aspect as this place is clearly intended to replicate a 50's diner. The interior alone is not enough to justify the cost or quality of the food. Next time I want breakfast for lunch, I'll tackle the traffic and go to Sunset Grill instead."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time today for breakfast. Got the Back bacon sandwich with egg and cheddar cheese to go. A little bit on the pricey side (for breakfast) but the sandwich was enormous. Flavourful and HUGGGGE. side potatoes also huge and delicious. The lady at the counter (didn't catch her name) offered me coffee and juice at no expense! I kindly refused but she would not let me leave without at least taking a coffee. Will definitely return!!"}
