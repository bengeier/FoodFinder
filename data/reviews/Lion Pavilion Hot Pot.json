{"text":"Great place. They were extra helpful in choosing items to put in the pot. FYI when they ask if you want spicy they REALLY mean SPICY!"}
{"text":"Went to this place on a saturday night. We were a psrty of 8. And had purchased a group deal on a website before. It allowed us to have the 27.99 dinner include a free soup which cost 8.99 per soup. For hot pot. This new trend of mandatory purchase of soup as a side from the ayce price annoying at best from a lot of the new \"premium hot pot places that have shown up\" recently in toronto. Because you have no free option its basically a lie to say its 27.99 . That being said. The service at this place was good. The server was attentive and relatively fast. They employ a button system and the servers actually pay attention to it. The food was good for thr most parts. If the price was always at 27.99 for weekends without the soup cost. It will deserve a 4 star definitely. But at its current price point where you are spending 40 bucks without even including drinks. Is too much and thats what bumped it to 3 star. The desert of this place is good. Better then most hot pot  and has the \"raindrop cake\" although in a different name and form. If you can get the deal online in chinese websites it is definitely worth the try. Because the quality of food was good. Otherwise i would say you may consider depending on your budget"}
