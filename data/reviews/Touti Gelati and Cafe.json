{"text":"The best Gelato on Queens way! The strawberry cheesecake is going to be my go to from now on. My gf asked for a bite but I completely forgot and scarfed it down."}
{"text":"Confession: I never knew what the difference was between gelato and ice cream. Most places I've been to advertised gelato but were really selling ice cream, and if you were like me you wouldn't be able to tell. So when I walked into this place I figured it would be just another ice cream parlor, and it was anything but that. The flavors were fresh, vibrant and very tasteful. I got to try a few testers before I picked pistachio and chocolate hazelnut, delicious! I wanted to try more flavors so I took a couple tubs back home with me. The service was really friendly and the atmosphere at the place was cheerful and fun...perfect for when you want to enjoy a gelato (drooling over the cheesecakes on display isn't bad either) Will definitely be coming back for more flavors, and to try their gelato panini that a fellow customer was having. It looked mouth watering and incredibly inviting, and definitely will require a dedicated visit to try it out :)))) Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"i thought i was the only one disliking the place but i saw the previous review! friendly staff, clean place, but boring selection and AWFUL CAKES  been there twice, first time we liked the mint and the pistachio ice creams, so this time wanted to try other tastes as well, the coconut is too fake for example and too expensive 6 bucks for 1 scoop???they call it medium but its apparently just 1 scoop or two half a scoops...  the whole package costs 5 in the supermarkets and how weird it is that i ve tried so many ice cream shops but the supermarkets' ones always beat all the cafes!!! all of them tastes so FAKE and contains a pound of sugar!  chocolate CHEESECAKE  DISASTER, again wasted 6.50 and I threw it out... it was too hard nothing creamy and the chocolate itself did not feel like a quality one. they order these from the factories, then whats the point going to cafes if they sell the same like supermarkets??? there is no atmosphere left in these places, i like businesses that make their own stuff, anyone can order junk food cakes from wholesalers and open a bakery or cafe but it won't be authentic to win customers' hearts!  i don't think this place will survive during the winter time..."}
{"text":"Went there on a Sunday night, the place was fairly quiet. The place was very cute, had a sweet cozy kind of feeling. Price range is reasonable. Me and my boyfriend got 2 small gelato(fruit explosion and Oreo) and a slice of cheesecake. Fruit explosion was sort of sour but it was also very fruity. Oreo one was the best, I rate it 9.5 out of 10. Carmel Cheesecake was very creamy. But tasted very.   Would definitely recommend it to anyone that is trying to find a light dessert or small date with someone special."}
{"text":"Very good! My kids love it here! Good service and good gelato! Red velvet cheesecake and strawberry cheesecake very yummy :)"}
{"text":"On a first date, a girl and I ended up having dessert there! Best gelato I've ever had just like the real thing! She had the mint chocolate chip and I had the salted caramel plus we had cappuccinos. And we shared, sealed the deal! So thank you Touti Gelati!"}
{"text":"Great coffee in the mornings. Not bitter like Starbucks and good service. Could have a better selection of pastries, but what they do have is very fresh."}
{"text":"Toui Gelati and Cafe is a good gelato shop. It was not crowded and it was a comfortable and pleasant place to have a seat and gelato with friends. I tried gelato, but there were different kinds of pastries. I want to go back to have a piece of cheese cake the next time."}
{"text":"I  absolutely love this place. The gelato is awesome, the staff is friendly and the portions are gigantic. I love that they have rotating flavours depending on the season  Pumpkin and gingerbread are my favourites during the colder months. I recommend getting a vicinity card. You can collect points with this card and take advantage of their weekly offers. If you have a sweet tooth like me head on over NOW."}
{"text":"Really good! The snickers gelato is my personal favourite, but I've never had one I didn't like."}
{"text":"Love this place! Try the mango or the tiramisu. Good service too. They have about 20-30 different flavors including popcorn (which tasted like butter haha) and most of them are delicious. Plus the area is good to take a walk with your gelato in hand."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend after checking out the Toronto Food Truck Festival this past Saturday. It was such a beautiful day so after eating from the food trucks, we went for a nice long walk. Then we decided that we wanted to go somewhere to relax and have some ice cream and a coffee. We were walking east on Queen St. E and came across this little spot so we decided to try it out. They had a good selection of both coffee and gelato/sorbetto. I asked to sample the buttered popcorn gelato and it really did taste like buttered popcorn, but I didn't think I could eat a servings worth so I went with Tiramisu and Hazelnut in the medium cup size. My friend got Tiramisu and Salted Caramel for his two choices. I enjoyed all three flavours and I liked the fact that each flavour tastes exactly like it is advertised to. I also ordered a caramel cinnamon latte to accompany my gelato, which was delicious. Our service was great and I liked the overall atmosphere of the place. I will definitely come back here if I am ever in the area again."}
{"text":"Have been meaning to try the neighbourhood spot for a while. Finally got around to it. This ia short review as will form a better opinion after I have tried other flavors of gelato. The setup is ok with ok seating if lounging around is your thing.  They offer a variety of drinks and desserts. I only got to try the pistachio flavor on this visit as use it as a reference. Quite good and better than the other stop nearby. I would say 3.5 stars with a half star thrown in for the yelp check-in promo. I will be back to try other flavors of gelato and maybe other desserts after the summer is over."}
{"text":"I was honestly tempted to give this place 5 stars because it's so close to my condo and the gelato is delicious.  This is a family oriented spot that doubles as a cafe serving sandwiches, baked goods and coffee.  They've recently done up decorations for halloween and show movies once a week for children.  The staff is extremely friendly and courteous. Way to give back to the small Queens Quay community.  On to the gelato.  They have a rotating selection of over 10 flavours.  I want to say this is closer to 16 but I lost track when the server was naming them off to me.  The only thing that detracts from this is they do not label their flavours.  By the time the server gets to the last flavour, I'd forgotten the first!  Not to worry, you can have as many tastings as you want.  They vary from seemingly healthy to obviously not.  The gelato is home-made and delicious, the service is excellent and the prices are reasonable.  What's not to like?"}
{"text":"A beautiful, sunny day at The Beaches warrants a delicious cold treat.   My friend and I were exploring the neighborhood around Kew Gardens searching for some decent gelato. We sampled from a couple of nearby places but they were either too sweet or the flavors didn't appeal to our taste buds. We covered a number of blocks and were about to give up when Touti Gelato came up on our Yelp radar.  Nice bright decor and friendly staff that let us sample a couple flavors. I had a medium size with lemon and chocolate. We both enjoyed our gelato very much: smooth textures with just the right amount of sweetness and yummy flavors.   Don't settle for what's close by and convenient, make the extra effort and head on down to Touti Gelati; your taste buds will thank you."}
{"text":"I was so excited to find out that another cafe was opening up in the Harbourfront. I'm always up for some delicious gelato and Touti Gelati definitely delivered.  This fresh new cafe/resto recently opened its doors a few days ago along the construction ridden Queens Quay strip and my initial experience was a good one. This place has a really fun and relaxed atmosphere - offering a lot of seating room for families and friends to stop in and have a coffee or dessert (gelato!). They have a decent selection of gelato and sorbet flavours ranging from classic staples such as lime, chocolate and pistachio to cheesecake and oreo flavoured gelato. They also offer beverages such as lattes, coffee, tea, etc. as well as mouth watering cakes and cupcakes!  During my first visit, I had the pistachio gelato and my husband had the chocolate hazelnut gelato. Both flavours tasted very fresh and was not overly sweet. The texture of the gelato was creamy and smooth...and did I mention it was delicious? It definitely hit the spot in terms of sweet cravings. The staff was exceptionally friendly and gave us loyalty cards for our next visit. The cafe has a TV for viewing any local sporting events as well as free wifi (for your \"check in: needs!). Everything looked clean and very well organized. The desserts on display also looked so good (tempting!) - I look forward to trying their CHEESECAKES on my next visit! Definitely a good place to try when you are in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Give this place 5 stars! Friendly staff! Great portion sizes. And such an amazing location! I'm glad they stuck it through during the winter months when they opened! It's going to be a great summer! #queensquaygelato"}
{"text":"There are very few places left in the beaches now to get ice cream / gelato...   We used to have a variety of choices, but since Menchies came in, all the ice cream places shut down.  So where do you go other than all the way east to Ed's if you are near Queen and Woodbine?  Touti!   This place is great.  Very convenient. Clean.  Staff are friendly and nice.   Generous portions.   And the quality of the product is really good.    I'll be back."}
{"text":"One of the best gelato places I have been to. About 10-15 mins. walk from the beaches, this is a great spot to get your cold and creamy sweets cravings! A small and cozy cafe, the store fits about 15 sit-in customers. The gelato selection is pretty good - a lot of flavours to choose from.  The ones we picked (in a two-scoop waffle cone) were London Fog (earl grey) and Dulce de Leche. I can't really decide which one I liked more... the flavours are both so creamy, perfectly sweet, & more than what I expected. The London Fog's earl grey flavour wasn't subtle as I've had with other gelato scoops - which I like. You gotta be able to taste the flavour! The dulce de leche was my fam's overall favourite. You can't go wrong with this one.   I wish Touti existed where I lived because I would definitely frequent it if I could. A definite recommend and a great (and better) alternative to the ice cream parlours around the area."}
{"text":"Have had the lattes here for the last few weeks and they taste great especially the white mocha. Today was the first time I had their gelato and I'm happy to say that it was smooth and delicious.   Not going to stop coming by that's for sure."}
{"text":"We went here for Gelato last weekend on a Friday night around 815pm. No one else was in the shop and the person working was on the phone. It was a strange vibe and seemed unorganized decor etc. The gelato case was half empty and very clearly in containers shipped in from somewhere else. We ordered a small w one flavour and it came out to $5.5. The gelato itself was OK but honestly nothing special at all. We sat at a table by window and chatted for a bit. The staff person started closing up shop, putting all gelato in the back, chatting on phone, pulling in sign outside etc. it was odd because online it said they closed at 11 yet it wasn't even 9. We felt rushed and as if we were causing an inconvenience by being there. It's too bad because there isn't much open later in the east end. This shop just didn't seem very well thought out with the design and product. You're better off going down the danforth for gelato at Dolce."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to check this place out since it opened a few weeks ago, but the timing never seemed right. Finally, yesterday I stopped in and was well rewarded. Tried out a few flavours of gelato & sorbettos. Wow! Ended up bring home a tub with a mixture of 5 flavours & a mix of both gelato & sorbetto.  Favourites? Hard to say, though chocolate raspberry, lemon, and salted caramel are particularly memorable. Same with the pineapple sorbet.  Going back today for coffee and a cookie. Service was extremely friendly & welcoming. I for one (make that 2 with my husband) am really happy to welcome them to the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"the servers are friendly and helpful, and they make a solid cup of coffee. there are many choices of gelato and they're on par with the best in the city. (some of their frozen offerings are too rich to be considered as gelato, imho, but this is a universal reality across gelato shops in toronto. touti gelati can't be faulted for that.)   it's in a lovely area very close to the music garden and right across from the water. the servers tell me that they will be getting some patio furniture soon and that would be a smart addition to their cafe.   the place is clean and the décor is okay. some of the fittings/furnishings look unfinished still. perhaps they were rushed to get the store opened for our all-too-short summer.  i've been three times since it opened, but will definitely go again when i'm in the area. i'll update my review after a few more visits."}
{"text":"Has the classic gelato as well as some cool new twists, ask for samples and blend what you want"}
{"text":"The gelato in this stylish-looking cafe comes mainly in fruit-based flavors rather than creamy classics; not a bad thing on a warm day. There's also a radioactive-blue \"birthday cake\" flavor, whatever that means. The lemon and the blueberry we tried were both good. But I have never before been in a gelato shop where the staff lacks basic competence to scoop gelato and pack it neatly into a cup. What a mess! Bits of gelato falling over the edges; sides of the cup smeared all over. No wonder they don't do two flavors in a small cup; they can't even handle one. But it's too bad, as the small cup is a large enough serving and can totally fit two; and the medium is too big and ridiculously expensive."}
{"text":"4.5  generous portion (please keep being so generous... not like several other good gelato places that were generous only the first months... then became much much less), pretty good and decent gelato, well done and creamy, nice flavours. Perhaps just a little bit too much sugar.  Personnaly, I prefer this one to the Lick it, which is only a few blocks East.  My gf disagrees."}
{"text":"I was very excited when I saw a new gelato place open up in my neighbourhood. So I enthusiastically took my family there on a hot summer day. What a disappointment. We all agreed this is the worst gelato we've ever eaten. Tasted too creamy (more like ice cream than gelato), my brother got 2 solid chunks of ice in his, and the flavours were highly muted. We tried the chocolate hazelnut, salted caramel and tiramisu. Very disappointing."}
