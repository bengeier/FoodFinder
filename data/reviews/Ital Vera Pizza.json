{"text":"Tasteless, too doughy and cold. Had to get a new one and give the old one back. The second pizza was slightly more cooked than the last. When it was delivered, the debit machine didn't work so I had to get a family member to get cash from the bank. Positive reviews must be from employees or past employees. Do not eat here. There's much better pizza joints.  Felt bad for the delivery guy. But he was swearing and didn't seem to give much of a care."}
{"text":"Very rude. I asked for delivery, when they delivered they messed up. I called back and they told me that it wasn't worth their time to fix their mistake. Then they tried to make it sound like I was in the wrong!  Pizza dough tasted frozen, very chewy. Not ordering from there again"}
{"text":"Ordered and picked up many times. Not sure why the 3 star average but great service and great pizza. It's take out people!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood pizza shop with great pizza. The service could be slightly better in terms of not being so rushed..."}
{"text":"The garlic sauce wasn't anything special. Tasted like a garlicy kraft ranch. The pizza was ok. Nothing special either. Better then the chains but not what I expected from the hype"}
{"text":"Probably the best pizza I've tried so far in Woodbridge, and I hear it's been around for years now.  Have tried their large pizza a handful of times now and with different toppings and it's always delicious.  Pizza was served hot, has flavor, cooked well, good toppings used and appropriate amount of toppings, and the dough has a good thickness. I've tried a few other pizza places in the area and for one of the smaller pizza joints it's been excellent time and time again - would definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"I love their pizza. The sauce is home-made and not overly seasoned. The pizza portions and sizes are generous and the pricing is great. I think the other guys have met their competition.  I always order from them and I have absolutely no problems giving them good tips. As far as I'm concerned they deserve it. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"I was going to a friends house for a night in and decided to pick up a pizza along the way.  Found this gem hidden in a small plaza at Chancellor and Fiori .  Was blown away from the quality of the ingredients.  Far superior to the pizza chains out there.  Will be back for more!"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza I have ever tasted. An authentic Italian, family owned pizzeria. They make everything from scratch, creating delicious gourmet pizzas. They don't skimp on the toppings. Every pizza I have ordered has been loaded with toppings and cheese. They always have a variety of slices ready to go if you want a quick snack.   The management is wonderful, and treat their employees well. I worked here for 4 years, and it was a pleasure. Working in various restaurants after I left this place, I now see that it is not common for an employer to treat their staff like family.   I've moved to different cities since I left this job, and have yet to find a pizzeria that comes close :)"}
{"text":"I've had Ital Vera Pizza's pizza twice now.   The first time I walked in this joint, the girl who took my order was very rude. She looked as though she absolutely did not want to be there. I had asked for two slices of pizza, and she got the oldest pieces she could find. Was not impressed with how it tasted and how I was served   My second visit was an order for pick up. Was told to come pick up the pizza in 30 mins. ance I picked up the order, I felt the pizza was cold and not cooked properly. It tasted just ok, not impressive at all.   I thought this place was a hidden gem, but it isn't.   The only upside is the price on pizza. Very affordable, but what's the point if it doesn't taste good."}
{"text":"I've never been disappointed when taking a walk down my street to get a slice of pizza from Ital Vera. It's consistently good service, good food, and a quick in and out atmosphere.  While the pizza is great, I'm reducing a star because of cleanliness. I always pay with debit and the debit machine they use is just completely covered in nauseating caked on dirt and other crap. I have to go home and wash up before I would even touch my pizza after using that thing. Even the phone they use to take calls looks like its literally covered in shit.  Other then that its top notch!!!"}
