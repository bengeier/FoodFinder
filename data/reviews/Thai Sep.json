{"text":"Un petit Restorant simple de quelques tables seulement, mais une cuisine exceptionnelle. Bien présenté et très propre. Le personnel est courtois et attentionné."}
{"text":"Un autre bon petit resto sur Jean-Talon. Thaïlandais authentique géré par une famille provenant de ce pays. Le service est très bien et rapide.  Le menu midi est très raisonnable, plusieurs choix disponible tous entre 10 et 12$ et ça inclus entrée (soupe ou salade), repas et dessert (banane frite). Il va falloir que j'essaie les repas du souper où il semble y avoir plus de variété."}
{"text":"Food was not properly cooked, got sick a few hours later from the chicken curry. Seriously avoid this place, unless you want this to happen to you as well. It's also more expensive than your average thai place, and the ingredients are sub par."}
{"text":"Petit restaurant avec quelques tables seulement. Cuisine haute en finesse et en saveur. Certains plats sont déjà connu de la cuisine \" thaï \" que nous retrouvons à Montréal. Il faut plutôt choisir les autres plats méconnus qui sont authentiques d'une cuisine laotienne. Tout simplement délicieux, des saveurs que vous n'avez jamais goûté auparavant."}
{"text":"Great place, according to my husband(hes been to Thailand several times), the taste was pretty closed from Thailand.  You can change the regular rice to sticky rice, which is great for me! service was amazing + friendly."}
{"text":"Great place with real authentic Lao dishes that is really hard to find in Montreal. Friendly service and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved the experience in this place, delicious food and good service. After reading some reviews online, I was afraid it would be really slow to get the food since we were quite hungry .  But it was reasonable amount of waiting time.  First, the Tom yam soup was right on point, I give it 8,  a small start up soup with two shrimps and some mash room and tomato,  then we had the sausage, I lovedddddd it, the lemongrass taste is very nice, however my husband said he is expecting  something different.  Then we moved on to the beef salad, oh my goddess. It was the best beef salad I had ,  the sweet shallots , the crutch peanut and rice crispy give such a nice texture, service with fresh fresh greens and latus.  You must try this if you haven't.  Then for a long time, I want to try the green curry, it was all worth the waiting, it was with chick I ordered. Sweet and creamy. I really enjoyed. They also have the dessert. Mango with sticky rice which I adored the texture and my husband had the fried banana with ice cream. The banana wasfried with coconut chips.    Then next time I want to try their fish. It looked so amazing from the table next to us.  And I also want to try their noodle soup."}
{"text":"Best Thai and Lao dishes in the city! Very authentic. Try the sausages and the larb salad! This place is a hidden gem two steps from Fabre metro and you can bring your own wine.  Service is excellent. Cash only!"}
{"text":"Resto modeste avec peu de place  De l attente mais cela vaut vraiment le coup. Chaque plat est préparé à la commande. Tout est super frais: champignons, poivrons...  Bon service malgré une attente assez longue"}
{"text":"cash only!  Went there for lunch and in general food was good. I especially enjoyed the Tom Ka (coconut soup).  Service is decent although quite slow...the food doesn't come out quickly either as they only have one person working in the kitchen.  I would say don't go there when you are starving!"}
{"text":"Première expérience; nous sommes allés chercher une commande: Pad thai et nid de nouilles croustillantes avec légumes+soupes won ton.  La nourriture était très bonne. Le Pad thai est bien mais pas une révélation.  Personnel hyper sympathique!  Endroit très petit. Quelques tables seulement."}
{"text":"Definitely go to Thai sep for authentic thai and lao food.Everything is delicious and authentic,just be warned that the spice level is not suitable for everyone.the service,even though a bit slow on busy nights was very friendly and helpful in making the right choices.another plus is that it is bring your own wine.do not hesitate to go there!"}
