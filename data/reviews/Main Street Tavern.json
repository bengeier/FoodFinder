{"text":"Just recently discovered Water St. Tavern. The food is my favorite in the city. There's nice live regional music almost every night-- The bar seem to constructed to accommodate the more \"mature\" clientele in the afternoons and early evening. After 10:00pm the college \"Bro\" set descend, packing the house and all appear to enjoy themselves.  HOWEVER, the bar side is another story, hence my 3 stars. The Jekyll and Hyde bar manager and his staff have the WORSTattitudes--not remotely professional. They treat you like you're interrupting them when you ask for a drink. \"Here's your drink, now where's my tip?\" I dispassionately give them a tip so as to not worsen their attitude the next time visit. But they don't deserve it  Avoid the bar and enjoy the food and music and you'll have a great time."}
{"text":"Honestly, George's review pretty much summed this place up.  Main Street Tavern doesn't attract  the college crowd, but you will find plenty of townies dining here.  At 7pm on a Thursday, the place was packed, mostly with families and old couples.  The restaurant's decor hasn't been updated in a very, very long time, but that sort of adds to the charm.  It's pretty much as unpretentious as you can get.  The serve up a small-ish selection of diner foods.  Unlike many diners nowadays with their 10+ page menus, Main Street Tavern keeps it simple.  Their breakfast menu only has the basics, and I don't think they serve breakfast all day.  The lunch/dinner menu includes salads, soups, sandwiches, and a few entrees.  Nothing fancy- just diner fare.  The prices are quite cheap (we're talking $3 for a grilled cheese) and the quality of food is good (although not great).  Service was friendly, if a bit on the slow side.  I'll likely be back again."}
