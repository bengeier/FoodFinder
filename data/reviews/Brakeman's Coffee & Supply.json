{"text":"We went this morning for the first time. What a treat! Coffee was exceptional and atmosphere was superb! My new favorite place !"}
{"text":"Its good! Super lovely atmosphere, lots of little rooms and tables here and there! I went with a group of friends to study and it was perfect! The outside area is one of then loveliest I've seen. Very peaceful, fenced area with nice tables and chairs, lots of space out there. It does get busy though,  despite all the space and little rooms and tables.   The food is okay. They don't have a lot, a collection of addictive pastries and a fridge of pre-packages salads and adult style lucnchables. I always get a sweetened cold brew and add a whole bunch of cream, and its delicious. The coffee seems good, I've only tried a Sweetened cold brew. I also got a smoothie, which wasn't too great. Everything's definitely a tad overpriced, especially considering how small the sizes are. I wouldn't buy food here, not worth the price.  In total, its a lovely place to meet with friends. While buying coffee there is wonderful, I got bored of the small collection of pastries and fridge salads you could get at your local Walmart. The coffee is quite good though! I mostly just go for the atmosphere- peaceful, chill, perfect for lazy Sundays or busy study days."}
{"text":"So happy this place is finally done! Got the iced lavender latte and added vanilla. SO good. Reminds me of Black Tap in Charleston. The decor/ambience is great! Lots of seating indoor and out. Love that they use methodical coffee."}
{"text":"Great local coffee shop.  The staff is always nice.  The coffee is great, they offer a couple brews depending on the day. It's pretty crowded regardless of when you go.  There is a small area for kids to play games or draw on a chalkboard.  The prices are good, $2 for a large coffee.  They have a few snacks, my kids love the Oreo butter bar. Cute, quaint place to hang out."}
{"text":"Love that a new coffee shop opened in the neighborhood! It is really nice and trendy but is lacking a bit on seating. Some of the extra seating that is in the sun rooms is really warm and need a small a/c unit. The coffee and people are fantastic but unfortunately they are very understaffed. I have been here a few times already but had to add this review, because I went there today to get coffee at about 1:30 and it took exactly 28 mins to get my order. That was insane! They also need a bigger selection of baked goods. If they can just tweak those few things, it would have five stars from me. It seems like business is doing  good but they will probably lose some customers from the new coffee shop opening across the street."}
{"text":"Finally made it to this great coffee shop after seeing all the great Instagram stories from my friends hanging out here.  I happened to be in Matthews with my teen daughters and needed to kill some time and since it was just over a mile from where we were, we took the plunge. It was a cold day so only a brave couple of people were sitting out front and as I entered the front area, it was full. You know those folk that spend all day there nursing one cup of coffee while writing their dissertation and taking up a table for 4 will all their books. That's what it seemed like but I noticed additional seating in the back. This area was full as well and so we were going to have sit out on the spacious patio out back.  We'd be cold after all.  After much debate we finally decided on our drinks. A chai latte, and iced vanilla latte and an irish cream latte.  We wanted a little something to eat but it wasn't much of a selection so we just had drinks.  Luckily some chairs became available in the front and we sat down and enjoyed our drinks.  The vibe is very chill and relaxing and definitely has a \"neighborhoody\" feel to it. The staff was very helpful with menu assistance and there was even Kombucha on tap available.  The coffee was wonderful and the place has plenty of seating, especially for warmer weather.  I look forward to going back and trying a few things and hope they expand their food items to go along with the great drinks they offer.  Did you know you can even get a milkshake here? Yup, a milkshake.  This place is worth the trip, so go in, have a drink, enjoy the atmosphere but don't be a table hog and stay all day. Make some room for the rest of us. That is all!"}
{"text":"Brakeman's was a nice surprise. The staff is very friendly and the atmosphere was great. Very family friendly. Coffee was on point and on par with any of the 3rd wave coffee shops out there today. Love that they are serving coffee roasted in the Carolinas. They really seem to be serving a need for this area. Good work! Keep it up!"}
{"text":"My wife and I often frequent this spot for coffee. The \"Ticket Please\" espresso milkshake is my favorite drink. My wife often grabs one of the lattes. Lovely remodeled house with some great rooms to relax and do work if need be. They even have a little room for kids to play! Check it out!"}
{"text":"What an incredible coffee shop. The people that work here are so friendly and the customers are just as great. Today was my first time at Brakeman's and I will absolutely be back tomorrow (and the next day, and the next day). I absolutely recommend the 'Ticket Please' - add a little caramel for good measure! You will NOT be sorry! ENJOY!"}
{"text":"LOVE! Came here for the first time in December after seeing some photos on Instagram of their holiday decorations. The vibe in here is wonderful. Lots of people sitting and working alone but others visiting with friends over coffee. I sat in the chair by the fireplace and had a peppermint blonde. It was lovely. I have returned every time I find myself in Matthews and have always had a good experience! Lots of different seating areas. Happy to have found a cute/friendly/good coffee shop semi close to where I live!"}
{"text":"Fantastic ice coffee drinks with delicious flavors! I ordered a decaf almond milk carmel latte over ice & it was delicious! The service was excellent and they recommended a homemade pastry that was a combination of chocolate and walnuts, sort of a brownie and baklava hybrid. They have snacks for sale like nuts and cheese and some homemade baked goods. I think the dessert was yummy!  I loved the laid back atmosphere and downtown location in Matthews."}
{"text":"This has got to be the best coffee I've ever had. My only complaint is that they are in Matthews & not Mint Hill. We are in desperate need of a coffee house that has good coffee & stays open past 7pm. I'm begging you to please open a shop in Mint Hill!!!"}
{"text":"Cutest coffee house!!!  Great drinks, service and beautiful art.   I want to go back soon!"}
{"text":"I love Brakeman's! They provide a unique coffee experience in the coffee desert of Matthews, NC. They have a solid assortment of quality coffee based beverages, tasty snacks and incredible smoothies. The staff is incredibly friendly and the atmosphere is warm and inviting.   My only complaint is the cold brew program is very inconsistent and often watered down. It either tastes like they are trying to brew a second batch off of the same grounds, creating a watered down concentrate with less flavor or they are adding too much water to the concentrate for the end product. Quality cold brew should be a mix of 1:1 or 1:2 concentrate to water ratio based on the coffee and to taste."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! Great service, great coffee! Incredible atmosphere, creative environment! The staff are experienced and eager to please. My white chocolate mocha was like the sweet nectar of the heavens. I have also tried the Breve, the Iced coffee and Iced White Chocolate Mocha, and they have all been nothing short of ambrosial.  A must try spot for anyone and everyone."}
{"text":"Try the new nitro brew! Great place awesome staff 5 stars. Don't go to starbucks!"}
{"text":"New coffee spot in downtown Matthews that was greatly needed in the community. Went here shortly after opening on a Saturday and they were packed.. I have driven by a few times since and they are still very busy so be prepared to stand in line to order and wait for your coffee. I ordered a Carmel latte and my husband ordered the ticket please ( coffee milkshake). The Carmel latte was okay- I don't think I should have gotten the Carmel as it really altered the taste- it was a syrup I believe. I hope they will start making their own Carmel as it could really set them apart from other coffee shops. The Ticket Please was pretty good and I think I would order it again.     The atmosphere is really the winner here. They have redone an old home in Matthews beautifully. There is an outdoor patio, seating on the front porch as well as front lawn and seating inside."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere here.  However I am not a fan of the cold brew here compared to Dilworths in Plantation Market and Starbucks, here tasted like regular refrigerated coffee.  The brewed hot coffee is good at a fair price, and selection of seating is very good."}
{"text":"This place is beautiful. Service was fast and smiley. We could spend more time but was too much crowded, was I guess is good:) we'll go back again!"}
{"text":"Have gone back several times since the last review and generally continue to be impressed. I've had a couple of the seasonal lattes and they were delicious. I've also ventured back to try some of the pastries and the quality and variety has continued to improve.   The staff has also generally been very friendly and a little quicker than before (I know...I know...the motto is slow down. Sometimes you just need a quick coffee though :-))  Only small dings are for challenging parking and the prices have seemed to go up a bit since opening.   Keep up the good work overall though!"}
{"text":"We swung by on a Sunday after brunch and they were closed, but they opened the door and served us anyways! Talk about Southern hospitality! Plus the adorable decor and relaxed ambiance, this is my new favorite spot."}
{"text":"Cute and quaint coffee spot in downtown Matthews. Lots of space to relax/work in with an indoor porch, lots of spots outside and indoors too. A few drink options compared to your big name coffee shops and few pastries, but everything is delicious."}
{"text":"Lovely spot to meet friends. The lavender coffee is a great treat. Can be hard to find a seat at times because of the students/workers that hover on computers during the day. Nice shaded outdoor seating. Nice addition to downtown matthews."}
{"text":"Some of my favorite coffee! Nitro is good, give it a try! Cold brew is tasty too. Seating can be a challenge at times, especially because all the tables have a rock to them (looks like they kept the original flooring, super cute, but not even). Never have any issues with surfing the net. Employees are always helpful. Usually have a seasonal menu, that constantly changes which is a nice mix-up in the mix. Offer a couple different non-dairy milks, just wish they'd get macadamia nut milk. You can reserve the room upstairs, first hour is free and then it's $35/hour. Way too high if you ask me, but usually it's open."}
{"text":"Wonderful people serving great coffee in a beautiful setting. Matthews has changed, but it has been for the better. Love this little shop and walking around the historic area. Thanks Brakeman's."}
{"text":"Interior aesthetics are great & the location is cute- the coffee, not so good. Ordered cappuccinos with almond milk and they tasted really burnt. Also tried the peanut butter pastry bar with Reese's cups and it was very average. All in all, wouldn't visit again."}
{"text":"This is a cute little house-made coffee shop! It's a small space so seating isn't guaranteed, but I've been able to find a spot each time i visit. The Chai is great iced or hot! If you live in the Matthew area definitely make your way over here. They also have themed nights like game night, or live music, it's really nice."}
{"text":"Good coffee and Mocha. Very relaxing decor and great staff.  Definitely beatiful place to sit and relax inside and out. They have loyalty program where every 10th coffee is free. Love when places reward loyal customers. Love this place in general. Check it out!"}
{"text":"I really liked the coffee, the setup the whole place but damn if I'm in line to order a drink, please, please, please catch up on your snapchat/Instagram gossip with your friends later.  I was late to a meeting because I had to wait for the conversation of the customer in front of me, obviously friends with the girl taking orders, to finish their gossip before I could order my black iced coffee....obviously a quick and easy drink..."}
{"text":"No pour-over option here, but they do serve drip coffee supplied by Summit roasters in Davidson and Methodical roasters from South Carolina. I went with Summit since it was the dark roast choice. Very good as I always expect from Summit. There are other coffee options too such as lattes and cold brew. Price for a medium drip was just over $2. Borderline fair.   Pastry selection was very limited. Maybe a handful of muffins, baked squares, and \"scones\". I put scones in quotes because the scone I got was pretty abysmal. It was supposed to be pumpkin flavored which tasted zero of pumpkin. However, it tasted exactly like a plain salty biscuit and even had the consistency of one even though it was baked into the traditional triangular scone shape. Aggravated me pretty good since I paid over $3 for it!   Bathroom situation is all gender one at a time style. Very roomy and modern and cheery and clean! Lots of space to sit. Very good seating outside in front of the place and even a nice patio area in the back. Not much to see back there though since it's surrounded by walls.   I'll stop back by for the coffee, but the pastries not so much!"}
{"text":"This is a really lovely little addition to Matthews! I recommend the cold brew tea: it's really quite lovely. There are vegan and gluten free food and drink options, so that's a definite plus! The decor is really beautiful, and I adore the standing tables in the front area."}
{"text":"When did downtown Matthews become such a cute little mecca of shops, restaurants, and cafes?! I needed a spot to meet a friend for a quick drink after getting a massage at My Wellness Place down the road. I picked Brakeman's based on the glowing Yelp reviews and was not disappointed.   The interior is beautiful and inviting. I could camp out here for hours! Service was polite and freakishly fast. My cold brewed hibiscus tea was ready almost before I even found a seat. The tea was cool and refreshing on a hot summer day.   Next time I'm in Matthews and need a fun spot to hang out and caffeinate, I'm heading straight to Brakeman's!"}
{"text":"This place is exactly what every coffee shop should be like. Very inviting place, lots of seating areas both indoor and outdoor, and of course great coffee! I love the old remodeled house, just feels like you are home."}
{"text":"I stopped by for my morning coffee with my family and this was a great gem in the heart of Matthews. The location is a small house transformed into the town's go-to work/connecting space. My aunt and cousin live down the street and can't get enough of this coffee shop! Knowing that I love coffee so much, they jumped at the chance to recommend Brakeman's!  There is plenty of seating outside and inside and the weather has been perfect! The coffee was great and the service was also amazing. I also enjoyed some of the pastries that they had. The only missing star is that I really would have wanted to have some additional options for food but I'm sure things will change as time goes on.   Overall, a great coffee shop! I look forward to visiting again!"}
{"text":"This is a nice coffee shop in downtown Matthews. Coffee tastes really good. Staff is friendly too."}
{"text":"Super cute coffee shop in Matthews. Great atmosphere and plenty of work area. We sat out on the back patio and enjoyed the brisk, early fall weather. The coffees were ok but I would come back just to find a different drink to enjoy. I have give a shoutout to the baristas for calling each person by name and not by drink when finishing each beverage. It's nice to be Aleks and not Caramel Latte."}
{"text":"This place is simply unique! They don't have a lot of options as far as pastries, but they have enough drink options (not a lot but enough). They should give me a permanent work space area because I work from here at lease three times a week and they've only been open few months. The location and atmosphere is just perfect! I fail in love with this place after reading the reason the owner decided to open this place (check out the bio in the pictures above)."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this cute coffee shop for awhile, I have passed it for months and haven't been able to stop. I'm am so mad I hadn't stopped earlier. The employees are very friendly and helpful. A must try is the lavender latte which is amazing and so smart, it's delicious. They also have butter bars which are amazing. This place is a must try! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Food/Drink: I ordered a lavender latte and my sister ordered a nitro brew. The nitro brew was excellent, but my latte was a little heavier on the lavander and I would not order it again however; they had a wide range of options and am more than willing to go back and give other drinks a try, because the flavor of the espresso was good and I'm sure they have something else to suit my preference. Price was comparable most coffee shops in the area, maybe even a bit more affordable.   Service: Excellent. The barista was helpful and nice. She was very patient with the person standing in line before us who was unsure of what to order and took the extra time to help her find a drink that she would like.   Atmosphere: This place is everything I want in a coffee shop. Plenty of seating both outdoors and indoors, beautifully decorated and free wifi. The also have art, coffee accessories and notebooks/stationary available for purchase.  Overall: Brakeman's is a great place to study and get work done or just have a nice chat with a friend. Lavender latte is heavy on the lavender so if that isn't your jam, consider another drink. Service is friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Such a cute spot! It was warm and toasty on a cold, winter day. There are a few tables in the front and back, but we didn't get a table inside. We did find seating in their backyard which was nice. I had a yummy latte to keep me warm. In addition to pastries, they also offer pre-packaged sandwiches, soups and salads prepared by the Culinary Institute of Charlotte - so I'm sure it's good.  There was even a room for kids to play which was a surprise. I definitely did not expect that so I'm assuming both moms/dads and kids are happy here."}
{"text":"Perfect spot for a lovely cuppa coffee. My husband and I sat outside and enjoyed our drinks while our daughter got to draw on the windows.  Also, my experience was made even better by having the opportunity to try both brews they had available."}
{"text":"Wonderful coffee, great service and lots of great cozy spots to sit with your friends or just on your own :) also a great place for any kind of business meeting. Has a very cute cozy nook for kids! And a diaper changing station, Love that."}
{"text":"This coffee shop is definitely not the best in the Charlotte/Matthews area.. the coffee is blah, the pastries are store bought, and the internet is ok. I am trying to download some steam games, and it's taking forever.."}
{"text":"Love the location, the shop has a great atmosphere. Very nicely decorated and staff was nice . My issue is the largest coffee is normally a small compared to most coffee shops. I specifically asked if they had heavy cream and was told yes. I asked for a sugar free Carmel latte with heavy cream instead of milk and no foam . I watched her pure half and half in . When she handed me my coffee I asked her if that was with heavy cream. She said yes, I said , I saw you pour half and half . She then informs me they don't have heavy cream and half and half is the \"heaviest cream\" they have. Never offered me a refund or an exchange . I can't even taste a hint of Carmel and she didn't pour without the foam . So basically I paid for something that I didn't even order. I had such good hopes for this place since I refuse to go to SB. I have been trying to support small local coffee shops and when I heard of this one was very excited . Not sure if I will give a second chance ."}
{"text":"This is a new coffee shop in downtown Matthews. We were there around 10:15 AM on a Thursday morning. Seating was a premium - all inside and outside seats were taken. Service was a little slow - it felt as if they were understaffed for the number of people they were trying to serve. The coffee was good and served at a reasonable temperature. We had a muffin that was very dry and we did not finish it.  I think once they figure out the right level of staff for the number of customers and improve on their food selection they will do much better."}
{"text":"Brakeman's is the best coffee house in South Charlotte. It is low key with a great atmosphere and I especially liked the good seating options indoors and outdoors. I ordered an iced coffee with caramel which is something I wouldn't typically order and the flavor was great. This is a great stop to just sip and relax and kill sometime on a Saturday morning. You'll love it."}
{"text":"Beautifully restored home into a coffee house.  Lots of nooks and spaces to read.  It's awesome.  The only critique I have if that they should have larger sizes of coffee available.  Their large is like most mediums. Hopefully they will expand to offer 20 and 24 oz coffee cups. Other than that is was great!"}
{"text":"Hi, I'm Kendal Ann and I have a problem--I am obsessed with cold coffee.   Yall, let me tell you, Brakeman's is the spot. These folks know what they're doing and they want you to sit and settle in. The owner's of Brakeman's have given downtown Matthews the gift of coffee (cold brew, nitro, drip, lattes...) and friendship. Brakeman's checks all the boxes on my list: character, friendly staff, nitro, baked goods, artwork, exposed brick, ample seating and wifi.  I highly recommend you check out Brakeman's . Chat with the staff, bring a book and become a regular.   Hats off Brakeman's. Keep doing what yall are doing!"}
{"text":"Reminded me of the local coffee shops in Brooklyn, NY but a lot more spacious. The staff here is so friendly and the coffee is made strong just how I like it. I loved that I had the option of coconut milk and plenty of yummy vegan baked goods. Perfect spot for a weekend or weekday coffee date! Much rather give my money to a local spot than Starbucks, I will absolutely be a frequent visitor at Brakeman's."}
{"text":"I have lived in Charlotte almost 9 years without claiming a favorite coffee shop, until now. This one is it! Great staff, great aesthetics, great presence and great coffee with more options to come."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, coffee and the Bailey's Irish Cream Butter Bar is fabulous!! You must go check it out and enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"Decent coffee but long line and not enough seating. There is only one register and the line to order cuts across the middle of the room so you have to cut through once you pick up your order. The coffee isn't good enough to get me to go back and wait 30 minutes in a crowded room for a cup."}
