{"text":"South Indian at its simple best. Well spiced with good proportions. You may get your dosa (go Tuesday night for 2-for-1) on a paper plate and serve yourself chai tea (add a good shake of sugar for the American palate), however you will know you are eating well. Ask your server what things to try and they will steer you in the right direction. Veg or Non-Veg try a little of each. Lunch time has great specials!!! No buffet Indian here, just excellently spiced dishes you never knew you loved!"}
{"text":"we tried mutton biryani and fish biryani here they ask for spice level while ordering, very spicy is really very spicy so keep that in mind ordering. appreciate cook and other folks for good service"}
{"text":"I'm out of town and got  a chance to taste the biryani in the weekend probably the best in Phoenix valley. Calling them on Fridays to order a take out they put on hold and hang up so try avoiding on Fridays."}
{"text":"This is a pathetic place to order food. I would recommend everyone to think twice before going."}
{"text":"AMAZING. LOVE this place, it's a whole in the wall but the food is amazing and the people are comforting."}
{"text":"One might think with such a name that Biryani will be their specialty. One might also think that the place is so new so they are gonna have good quality food to attract new customers, at least for some time. But of course common sense is very uncommon. No where in the world can boiled colored bland rice sprinkled over isolated meat pieces can be called a biryani. This dish needs presence of minimum 2/3 of important ingredients such as onions, biryani masala, yogurt, cilantro, mint, ginger, garlic etc. to qualify for any star. Please save your bucks!"}
{"text":"Horrible management- They rejected to take Restaurant.com voucher, which was bought one week ago. Cheap tricks to bring the customers with these vouchers and reject at the restaurant. I will never go to this place again."}
{"text":"Food was tasty. Veg and non veg options. But didn't like the smell of the restaurant. When I walked in it smelled like pee. The floors were clean, bathrooms not clogged or anything. They need to figure out their air filtration system I guess.   Food served on disposable containers. Which makes clean up easy.   May not go back again personally."}
{"text":"Still going to Biryani.  Their quality and taste has stood the test of time.  They still use quality plastic and sturdy styrofoam take out containers as serving dishes. But since the servings are so large, it saves time when you want to take the rest home.  Last ate on Tuesday which is Dosa day, buy one & get one free.  The friendly couple at the next table recommended the cilantro and mint which ended up too spicy for me.  I enjoyed the potato filled one much better.  Both are giant sized and enough for 2-3 to share.  They come with 3 different sides to dip into.  Check on line for the daily item plus lunch combo. specials. Still love the palak paneer which is a soupy curry of spinach, cream and yogurt cheese. It comes with well cooked, white, jasmine rice on the side.  Greatly enjoy the shrimp dishes because there is so much shrimp in every bite.   They don't have a tandoori oven, which means no naan or tandoori cooked meats.  For example, they do chicken Tikka Masala using tender and juicy baked chicken tenders instead of tandoori seared pieces with grill marks. I suggest if you are in the neighborhood, try it - you'll like it."}
{"text":"Best biryani around here . Much better than Paradise for sure and very consistent. We ordered both veg and non veg and both of them were good and the spice level is always good. Overall good good ."}
{"text":"Very nice food. I have tried Chicken Manchurian, Chicken Masakkali , Veg dum briyani and Chicken dum briyani. All the items are taste too good. The restaurant is very good for business and team meetups. The staffs are very polite and responsive.They are providing tea as a complementary.The wait time of the order is bit more but this can be avoided by making phone order earlier. so that the order will be ready by the time you reach. Definitely recommend this restaurant for who seeks good Indian food for business and team meetups."}
{"text":"This place is my new fav for biriyani. It's a quaint little place in Glendale with friendly staff at the front desk where you place your order followed by self service.Its not just their biriyani that's my fav but also their chicken chettinad curry. Lunch portion is quite good. This place to close to work and so I plan to come here often. I took the leftovers home and my husband just gobbled the rest ."}
{"text":"This place is small and has about 6 tables but I suspect most people take the food to go.   When you walk in there is a table with plastic ware and paper plates.  I assumed this was for the to go orders.  We grabbed a table and the waitress came to take our orders. Ordered 2 chicken dum biryani and a masala dosa.  Medium spice.   You have to go get your own water, tea is complementary. Soda is sold by the cans.  When you go get your drink you can also grab your plastic ware and paper plate.   The dosa came out first and it's huge!  The various  chutneys came with it and they were tasty!   Then the biryani came and WOW!   Came out in a plastic to go box filled to the top.   I dug in and after the first few bites the heat stared building but it was the \"burn your face off\" heat.  It gave a good spicy flavor but wasn't overwhelming.   I've had some of the best Biryani (in my opinion) from a place in Hyderabad India called Paradise.   I go to India every other year and it's always a stop for me while I'm there.  In my humble opinion, the biryani I was eating today was a very close match up to paradise!  Maybe even slightly better since it wasn't as greasy.    I drove 40+ miles to come try this place on a friends recommendation, appears I'll be making this drive again in the near future"}
{"text":"Came here one day and had a horrible experience with their customer service. I won't even go into what happened but they can be kind of off. Also as time went on it's almost like the food got more spicy. When some one says mild it shouldn't be so hot that it makes your sinuses burn and your eyes water. Youch! This place was good when it opened, couldn't recommend it now."}
{"text":"Ordered food for pick up at a specified time. Had to wait 20 mins (with my infant) for the food to be ready. When they gave us our order, half the food was missing. Had to wait an additional 10 minutes for our complete order. At this point I don't even care what the food tastes like. I will not be coming here again."}
{"text":"Food tastes good as expected for hyderbadi biryani restaurant. Gobi masakali biryani is a good pick for vegeterians. Gongura chicken was my favorite then..  This restaurant has been more of a to-go option for me."}
{"text":"This Place is AMAZING! I've had Indian food once before but this was superb.  The atmosphere of this place is very nice. I was recommended the goat curry and even though I've never tried goat before I thought I would be a little adventurous. I was not disappointed, this goat curry was on fleek! Perfect in every way. I think I found a new favorite food. I also had the chicken biryani which was very good as well. I will be going back here for sure. Keep up the great work guys!"}
{"text":"Amazing vibe, amazing food.  Sowjanya, the host and cashier,  is very sweet and helpful, beautiful smile and very hospitable.  What else do you need? Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, clean and friendly. Their level of spice is a little higher than other Indian places in the area. Medium was more like a spicy of other places. Very good flavor though."}
{"text":"O. M. G. !!! If you haven't tried this place yet, what's the matter with you???? Get over there and eat! Unbelievable flavor, value, amount of food. I couldn't say enough. I'm a hell of a cook myself, I must say. But, when I don't have the time and I'm craving some curry and quick, this IS the place to go. Crazy good!! Friendly service. Friendly people. Nice place for take out or eat in. You owe it to yourself to try it. Weather you like Indian food or you think you don't. If you don't, then you haven't tried Biryani and Bites!! Try it, you like it very very much!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner and got curry chicken. It was really good, they had good service too. I'll be back here for sure."}
{"text":"Biryani and Bites is part of Peacock Indian Restaurants. This location is difficult to view from the road because another business in the strip mall is blocking the view. The menu lacks descriptions so if you are not familiar with Indian Cuisine you will have a hard time navigating the menu.   In a nutshell all the food we tried was tasty. This is not a fancy place and everything comes in disposable take-out ware and you dine on paper plates with plastic silverware.   The server was pleasant. PRICES ARE LOW and PORTIONS ARE LARGE. The portions were twice as big as we expected and had half left to bring home.  We tried the Chile Chicken, Chicken Biryani and a Spinach Dosa.   The Chile Chicken was made of moist chicken chunks in a fiery chile sauce that was tasty.  Chicken Biryani was mostly fluffy rice that was infused with spices and fresh mint and cilantro and what I think were tasty caramelized shallots. The chicken was moist and came with yogurt raita and another sauce that was tasty.  The Spinach Dosa is a thin large crepe filled and folded and stuffed with spinach and onions. Three side sauces were served with a Dosa. A vegetable-potato soup, a sauce that tasted like it was made with peanut butter and another sauce that was spicy tasted chile peppers that were slightly creamy. Not sure  but the spinach seemed like from frozen and wasn't the best.   For the most part the food we tried was  VERY TASTY and a very good value.  This is a Three Star Special. Tasty food that's a good value."}
{"text":"Fantastic little place hidden in a shopping center. The food is great and amazingly spicy. This is the only place I order mild. Everything we have tried has been very tasty.   Their menu has no details and the place is a bit sparse. It has a very take out feel but the food travels well."}
{"text":"I travel to Glendale on work, and found this place as a blessing. I tried pretty much everything on their menu (in Chicken and vegetarian), and liked almost all the items. My favorites are Chole Bhatura, BnB Special Dosa, Bezawada Biryani, and Samosa chat. I would have eaten each of these items at least 10 times and they never disappointed. Staff is very friendly and made me feel home. Thank you guys and keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Today I ordered chicken dum biryani and poori masala through  postmates. Biryani was very tasty but the poori masala is crispy not soft. Overall food was good. Will come back one day for dine-in to try other dishes."}
{"text":"The food was very good. Altered it to our taste. Friendly service. We were the only ones there at 5:30 when it just opened."}
{"text":"Do not come to this place if you are hungry and you are ur lunch time. They take your order and money and then make you wait for 25min. The second time the restaurant was open and emplty and the lady took the order and when asked she said we start at 11.30?????? You put open sign and take order and after making me wait for twenty minutes you tell me you start service at 11.30.....absolutely worst restaurant and I think they service only the indian people who prepay food on monthly basis....if you want good food stay away from this place...."}
{"text":"Food is really good. I and my friend ordered a veg biryani and panner makhani.  Both the orders were cooked to meet my spice level. Yall have to try mysore Bonda.  Ambience is not so great though."}
{"text":"What we ate: samosa chaat, madhura malli dosa, guntur chili dosa, plain dosa, and paneer tikka masala with roti. On Tuesdays, they have a buy one get one free for dosas so that really accounts for why we had so many dosas. The madhura malli dosa had a mint chutney paste spread inside it and was quite aromatic and flavorful. The guntur chili had a spicy paste inside it and was also pretty good. The paneer tikka masala and samosa chaat were both appetizing, but really nothing special. Service was pretty good. It is partially self service since you do have to get plates, napkins, utensils, and water for yourself. I did have to take a star off since they were out of both chole bhatura and the B&B special dosa. They mentioned that certain menu items were no longer being served which somewhat irked me since their menu was not properly up to date. Overall, the food and service were both adequate. Good Indian place with both vegetarian and meat options."}
{"text":"Delicious food! My vegetarian mom and I loved all the vegetarian options, and we got veggie biryani, spinach and onion dosa, and dal tadka. All were aromatic and rich in flavor.  Pricing was very good and we got a lot of good for cheap!   The atmosphere was a bit odd, with a combination of table service and get-it-yourself for the beverages and silverware. We were confused about the fact that we had to get our own forks which led to an awkward moment with the waitress.  Still, our waitress was great and all the food was delicious! Would love to go to this place again!"}
{"text":"Hole in the wall place but it's clean and the food is made with love you can tell in the taste .I be back with friends ."}
{"text":"They have improved on the service exceptionally. I visited the restaurant after 1 week and was amazed that the receptionist recognized me from the last visit and apologized for the bitter experience. They didn't even charge me for the biryani this time . Taste was good as always."}
{"text":"OKAY this is another gem! My greeter/waitress/cashier (the only person I saw..lol) was amazing she was sweet and super helpful! They had tea that my daughter loved she asked if it came in tea bags...I'm assuming she wanted to know so I could buy her some! I asked the cashier and she gave me the whole recipe like YESSSS she told me what it was and how they flavored it (the extras...lol) I thought that was super nice of her...we ordered food to go and it took about 20 mins...but when I got home my food was still steaming hot when I open the containers. My daughter ordered fish curry mild which she loved... I ordered my other daughter that lunch special which included rice , Curry and there was something else that had chunks of chicken (the lunch special came vegitarian or chicken) I got that \"as mild as possible\"  and I ordered a veggie masala spicy my exact words were \" A step below super spicy\" and it was delicious...they threw in three desserts which I'd call rice pudding?! Highly recommended this spot!"}
{"text":"Brought chicken65,its pathetic and it is covered with white butter gravy(not sure what it is)"}
{"text":"The food was alright although the menu had very limited options. We were here on a weeknight, so it was totally deserted. We ordered a Dahi papdi chat, Paneer makhni, Chapatis and a Mango lassi. Dahi papdi chat was terrible, it was literally some papdi's floating in dahi. Rest of the food was good although the presentation and the quantity could have been much better."}
{"text":"Spiciness  10/10  Boneless chicken biryani!!!! Amazing ! No words can describe the taste of this amazing food !!! Best in Phoenix !"}
{"text":"Never got disappointed with the biryani here... their Lunch combo is really good deal for the price with biryani,curry,roti,appetizer and desert. The place is inside the complex where parking is hard to find . And good part is owners are open for any suggestions."}
{"text":"(Phoenix location) 3130 E Union Hills Dr #101 Phoenix 602 9966389  I just finished a lunch of last night's \"leftovers\" from Biryani and Bites new Phoenix location and (aside from the naan which I incinerated while reheating) I think it was even better with age. I was  a little unsure when I entered this restaurant. It had all the charm of your average bus station. Décor consisted of orange walls and several tv's playing Indian videos. There were utilitarian Formica tables and chairs and a walk-up counter. There was only one other diner. On my first time visiting a new Indian restaurant, I always order a familiar dish--usually Butter Chicken, Chicken Korma or Chicken Tika Marsala, so I can compare it to other places. Our hostess/server/cashier was pleasant and professional, suggested we add bread (we got the Butter Naan) and directed us to the self serve counter where I obtained plastic flatware, napkins, etc.. My Butter Chicken arrived in a plastic one pint container as did the Tika Marsala I insisted my husband have. Rice (probably about 2 cups) accompanied each meal in  Styrofoam takeout boxes. My chicken was fragrant, flavorful and had plenty of meat.  I had asked for mild spicing and it was perfect. I didn't care so much for my husband's, but that was because of his higher spice level. The order of Naan arrived and all I can say was that it was practically orgasmic it was so good. We both stopped eating everything else to devour it and I eventually had to get another order. As I sat there I noticed that this restaurant is mainly takeout, as a steady flow of customers arrived for pickup. We couldn't finish our meals and the \"service counter\" just happened to have to the tops to the containers our food came in. This seems like a convenient/ economical /less wasteful  way of doing things. Biryani and Bites has a location in Glendale which I have not visited. This location is close by my home and has only been open a few months. The food was great. The place was immaculate (including the restroom) and I see myself going back often."}
{"text":"Very good biriyani but very hot biriyani is served in plastic containers. Very unhealthy when such hot food is served in plastic containers . Hope management starts using ceramic. It is a small place and difficult to find. Not that pricey."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good. Decent place to grab traditional Indian food. Very delicious. Great price point too."}
{"text":"Awesome biryani... this is probably the best in phoenix... i tasted the real hyderabadi biryani after 3 years in phoenix and thanks to biryani and bites for this..even the starters are awesome.. keep this up!!"}
{"text":"This place is located right next to my apartment complex, tucked away in the corner of a little strip mall. The lady that takes orders is very nice, and explained everything on the menu since I wasn't too knowledgeable. I am familiar with the curry though. The butter chicken curry is my favorite. I am in love with the boneless chicken biryani. I usually ask for spicy and it is worth sweating through. Portion sizes are great, and the prices are more than fair. I went in tonight (a busy night) and got my to-go order in under 20 minutes. I've gone here several times. Great atmosphere, great staff, great food."}
{"text":"Some of the best tasting Indian food we've ever had.  Seasonings were amazing, a bit spicy but not too much.  Being vegetarian we were very excited at all the options there were.  The B & B Special Dosa was amazing.  My son had the Madura Malli Dosa, it was delicious. The Chilli Vegetables were a great appetizer.  The Menu does not have any explanations  as to what each item is, which was a bit frustrating.  We were not offered anything to drink, water, tea anything.  There was a rather sketch looking water dispenser at the back of the restaurant that we finally helped ourselves to.  We were hoping for some chai tea, but at 6:30 p.m. it was all out and they said they weren't making any more.  The self-serve silverware and napkins at the front were not explained so we had to look around and figure that out.  So bottom line, very tasty, reasonably priced food."}
{"text":"When there is \"Biryani\" in your name, you need to get that one menu item right. We got boneless chicken biryani. Chicken used is thick breaded chicken, which is chewy and hard. Rice and the spices were flavorful.  When you are charged $1 extra, you think that you would get boneless chunks of chicken, instead you get the small, breaded and fried chicken pieces. The same one which is used in Manchurian or 65.  Will try regular biryani, if we try it again."}
{"text":"Delicious food. They have Mutton biryani on weekends, it is very good and affordable."}
{"text":"Google maps says that the restaurant closes at 10:00 pm and their restaurant time board says 9:30 pm. Travelled 7 miles and reached by 9:00 pm they said only 3 kinds of biryani are available. Since I am a vegetarian I was not left with much options but I was seeing food coming out and person in front of have also ordered all different kind of food. Very disappointed with the kitchen staff. I really appreciate the lady at the front who was taking the order she has requested the chef but looks like he was tired and not in a mood to make any food, Highly disappointed."}
{"text":"Wowww what a huge disappointment. I think anybody who have no idea about how Indian food should taste like will give this place a 5 star rating. If I can I would give this place -100 rating but unfortunately that's not possible. The hostess was nice and friendly but the food was disgusting I am not even going to say bad it was disgusting. Never every going back"}
{"text":"Must visit place for someone craving authentic (or close to authentic) South Indian stuff in Phoenix. After I moved to Phoenix from SFO Bay Area. I had tough time figuring out good South Indian places to eat similar to those found in the Bay. That's when I found Biryani and bites. I usually preferred takeouts because the ambience didn't quite please me. The food is awesome. I tried different stuff each time. The first time was channa masala (garbanzo bean gravy) with naan. It was very good and spiced according to my taste. The second time it was poori+ masala (fluffed deep fried bread and potato curry).It reminded me of the one my granny made back in India. Simply great. It is found under appetisers because of the quantity. It is worth the snack. The third time, I ordered madurai malli dosa. It's basically a rice crepe spread with coriander chutney paste. On that day they gave me a buy 1 dosa and get one free. The taste of the chutneys that came with the dosa was very good as well (especially the sambar). The quantity of sambar which came with the dosa was a lot. I even had it with rice the next day. This place offers a lot of variety of dosas. My colleagues usually order keema biryani from here and they love the taste. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone craving authentic South Indian food."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Samosas and chicken biryani, perfect! I can't wait to try more of their menu. They're doing it right here."}
