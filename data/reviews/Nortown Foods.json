{"text":"Actually I too will never return. I heard the owner is a real terrible person. The women I found are sweet. Prices are ridiculous. The hot foods and salad bar look delish but I can cook all these kinds of foods myself. Anyways why would I support such a mean man?"}
{"text":"A word to the wise from someone who is on the inside but trying to get out. Things are not as they seem at Nortown. The section of \"naturally raised, organic meat\" is actually the same crap as everything else. And trust me when I say it's crap. 
The ground turkey? Not turkey at all but a mix of chicken and veal, just like the \"group chicken\" 
It's a horrible place."}
{"text":"The staff is beyond rude! Perhaps it is because they have to deal with some very rude and self-important customers? I have shopped here several times and after today I have vowed to never return! The lady at the cash was just horrible! She yelled at the woman in front of me to \"hurry up and pay\" and when the woman(who was talking to her friend and did not hear the cashier) ignored her, the cashier said\"hello!!\". Actually, she screamed it at her, I am always baffled at how management could run such an unfriendly establishment."}
{"text":"We usually get salmon stakes fro Nortown Foods. They are always fresh and delicious. They also carry Moo Moo Bars which I ted to buy quite often despite the price."}
{"text":"Excellent quality meat and value from Nortown! (And no concerns that the animals were pumped full of something unnatural.) All the butcher staff are very friendly and helpful. If this butcher is local to you/convenient, it is a no-brainer to shop here. Once you've had their quality of meat, you will not go back to a supermarket. I don't even shop in a regular supermarket anymore - I love that I can shop locally and support the businesses in my neighbourhood. 

They have the butcher counter, pre-prepared dishes, a hot counter, other normal groceries. It's on the small side and often more busy than not. 

Open M-F & Sunday, not open on Saturdays. Usually open until 7 during the week, Sun. until 6.  If you're going out of your way, definitely call to confirm their hours. Open most statutory holidays"}
{"text":"Lately I find the quality has declined  Steaks were tough twice now.  The staff are always \"busy\" and looks like hey are doing me a favour in serving. Checkout is appalling. Prepared foods are decent and we do enjoy the spicy smoked sausages. Bruno's is same price and quality is superior"}
{"text":"Fantastic butcher and specialty food shop.

Try the BBQ chicken!!! They tend to sell out of these (that's how good they are) so maybe call first to avoid disappointment?"}
{"text":"Purchased a stuffed chicken breast and potatoes from their hotcase. The stuffed chicken breast was not only tasteless, but apparently, I paid for mostly limp chicken skin. The potatoes were undercooked but were tasty as soon as I got them in to the microwave and put some salt on them. 

All in all, not worth the $11 I paid for this meal."}
{"text":"Overpriced food, rude staff, lots of yelling and screaming in the office upstairs."}
