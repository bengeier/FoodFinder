{"text":"Horrible horrible experience.  We came in there for lunch, it was not even that busy, but we had to wait for good 10 minutes in the hall before anyone was able to help us. Then the manager (owner?) came in and said he would be helping us today as there were no waiters available.   He sat us down and then went away to chat with another customer, which he did for another good 5 minutes before bringing us the menus.  We ordered some shawerma and it was disgusting- overcooked, tough as a leather shoe, completely unseasoned, etc.  I barely ate any of mine.  They also wanted to charge us for a piece of bread.  I was surprised that water was free.  During the whole meal the manager was too busy chatting up with someone else to even come and check on us.  Nobody even offered us extra water, I had to find him and ask  him for some.   The only good thing about the restaurant is the decor.  But the food is not worth the price."}
{"text":"Moroccan and Mediterranean cuisine situated in West Madison right off University Ave. It's easy to spot but if you're driving too fast it's easy to miss the turn. Mediterranean cuisine is not common in Madison and having one on the west side in addition a couple that are downtown is great.  Their lentil soup is good. Classic dish with soft lentils and spices makes this a flavorful appetizer. We also had the sampler plate with hummus, zaaluk and tabouli. The hummus and zaaluk (grilled eggplant) were good. For entrees we had the chicken tangine with couscous, lamb tangine and the seafood bastila. Their tangines are served in an earthenware pot with a cute little cover - nice presentation. I have always been a fan of chicken tangine with couscous, soft and succulent pieces of meat in a nice savory stew sauce. The bastila is also awesome with thin crispy layers of pastry crust with generous serving of seafood (or choice of meat and other fillings). Those bastilas fill you up pretty fast, I highly suggest sharing one amongst the table.  Service was really slow. Be prepared for significant waiting times at every stage - water, ordering, being served and getting the check. We were there on early on a weekday night and they were not too busy, but still we waited for quite a bit. Later into the evening as more people came, the waits became longer. It seems like they are under staffed?  The portions were big and will fill you up. However, for some of their dishes like the curries and kebobs, I feel like you could get something of similar quality downtown for less. I would head back for their specialty dishes such as the bastila, when I am looking for a slow dinner or have loads of waiting time to spare."}
{"text":"Six of us met and ate a wonderful meal at the Marrakech. It was quiet enough to have a pleasant conversation with soft ethnic music playing in the background. The food came out and each of us had different dishes which we greatly enjoyed. I had an eggplant appetizer and chicken bastilla which were delicious. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"I just returned from one of the most amazing dishes in Madison. I had to write about it. The lamb tagine at Marrakesh may be the best entree I've ordered in this city. In my opinion, you're either a lamb person or you're not. For those who are, this is a must-try dish. Like many entrees at Marrakesh, it arrives in a clay tagine with a cone-shaped top that the server removes. Underneath is a very warm plate brimming with tender pieces of lamb and a perfectly finished medley of carrots, potatoes and peas. My wife had the chicken couscous, which she loved. The \"Flavor of Sahara\" bar--with dates, nuts and sesame seeds and date syrup--is a great way to end the dinner. Our waitress was very friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. The service here has been consistently good in our experience. The prices are admittedly a bit high, but the quality is superb. This one's a keeper.  6/12/2014 I had forgotten about my prior review and just came back from a fantastic meal at Marrakesh. I thought, \"let's write a review.\" So, another year of visits later. I have tried the vegetarian bastilla and love it: crispy on the outside, bursting with delicious vegetables on the inside. My wife loves the fish tagine. The mohamara (a pepper spread) is also very good, although I prefer mine a bit spicier.  There's just nothing like Marrakesh in Madison."}
{"text":"We were excited about going to the Marrakesh for the first time.  We were the first ones to enter the restaurant, followed by one other party.  With only two tables full at the time (a few more people came later), the level of service we received was disappointing and puzzling.  A nice young man led us to our table, gave us menus, told us a different person would be our waiter, and then vanished.  We must have waited 20 minutes before we even got water and were able to order.  Our two drinks took forever to come.  Our hummus -- which we really enjoyed -- took forever to come.  At every step of the way, the service was excruciatingly slow, which was inexplicable given that for awhile there were just two tables filled in the whole place, and each table was assigned a different waiter.  (Eventually there were 5 tables full, split between the two waiters.)  When we finally received our Chicken Tagine, we really enjoyed it, despite the accompanying rice being barely warm.  We assume this is a family-run business and we'd like to see it do well.  We know that running a restaurant is hard work.  But for most of the night, we were pretty much abandoned.  No one ever asked us if we'd like anything more, no one came by to see how we liked the food, and there was no waiter even walking past in the dining room.  The restaurant definitely missed a chance to see if we wanted a second drink.  Unless the two waiters were also pressed into service as cooks -- in which case I apologize for this review -- there was no discernible reason why our service was almost nonexistent.  For almost the entire, extremely long time that we were there, the customers were alone in the dining room and the waiters had vanished like ghosts.  This was our wedding anniversary and we had some other things planned for after the meal which we were not able to do.  I really hope that Marrakesh will read these reviews and make some serious efforts to improve their service, as there are many competing restaurants in town which offer good food AND good service.  I wish them well."}
{"text":"We haven't been here in a long time and we were really pleased with our meal.  Very authentic  chicken tagine with raisins and chicken peas. Chicken was ver tender and delicious blend of flavor. The other dish we had was the vegetable  Bastila which was phyllo stuffed with vegetables with yogurt. The pastry was nice and flakey with a browned top.   It was a pretty quiet night, only a few tables. Give it a try, I think you will be pleasantly surprised!"}
{"text":"This is close to the house and I had visions of it being our go to place.  Probably not going to happen.  Prices are a bit steep and  the service is S L O W.  We had hummus to start and the flavors were there but the bread was cold and stale.  It clearly came from a store and not made in house.  He brought out more after we left a bunch of hummus and no bread.  Bread the second go around was warm.    Food was just ok....veggies over cooked and chicken a bit dry.  There was one other table in the place so it wasn't like the kitchen was slammed.     There are lots of dinning choices in Madison, I'm sorry this one won't be on my go to list."}
{"text":"Disappointing, especially considering they occupy the space that was formerly Shish Cafe, Madison's best Middle Eastern restaurant. Food is only so-so and service is indifferent."}
{"text":"So, this is my first try at Moroccan food and I simply love it! I've tried several Mediterranean place all over the States before, but this is by far my favorite Mediterranean place. Here's how it went down!  Pros:  1) Food is really tasty. And let's face it, how many places are there in Madison where you can get Moroccan food? I had the Chicken Tagine -chicken was perfectly cooked and covered in this mouthwatering sauce. My boyfriend and I basically finished almost every drop of the sauce, pouring it over our delicious saffron rice. Waiter said it's made of lots of spices, which all combined makes the most wonderful taste. I also made a rather strange request of substituting some of the ingredients with those matched with the Beef Tagine, but the waiter was pretty cool about it. I received the dish exactly how I asked for. Boyfriend had the beef kabob, which really, is probably pretty hard to mess up. He liked it.  2) Small menu. Reduces the amount of decision-making I have to make.  3) Decor is prettty awesome! They seated us in this comfy couches and I loved that we had privacy because there was nobody else in our seating section.  4) Because it's our first time sampling Moroccan food, waiter let us try some Moroccan mint tea. It's good but can taste a bit strange at first. Best part is it came in a cute little teapot and teacups, and the waiter poured out the tea most professionally (even though the teapot was boiling hot when I tried to repeat the same feat.)  Cons:  1) Service is pretty slow. This is a good and a bad thing. Good is, the waiter, unlike waiters in a lot of American restaurants, doesn't come pester you every five minutes. Bad is, we waited at least ten minutes for him to take our credit card so that we can up and leave.    2) Dishes are rather pricey for the serving size.   If you're sick of the standard American/Asian places around this area, then I'd say you should definitely check this place out at least once. Good food but pricey."}
{"text":"Really awful dining experience - bland muhummara, burned and strangely textured felafel, badly seasoned meat kabob. I loved the Shish Cafe - which was previously in this location - and this is nowhere near as good. Very disappointing, I will not be back."}
{"text":"Very disappointing.  I am a huge fan of Moroccan food and was excited to finally (again) have a Moroccan restaurant in town.  My previous experience of Moroccan restaurants is that they have a wide variety of nicely flavored/spiced foods that satisfy the soul.  My boyfriend and I visited the restaurant last night and were very dissatisfied. We ordered the lamb tagine and lamb couscous  Here are some of the reasons I felt so disappointed with our meal.  PRICE:  The food is priced quite high for the the quantity and quality.  Each dish arrives ala cart. There is no salad, soup or bread included with the entree.  At $15-17 for main dish, the meal would top $19-24 when adding a salad or soup.    PORTION SIZE:  The portion size was very small and included about 3 oz of lamb.  The overal size of the meal was closer to what one would expect for lunch .  For $16-17, this seemed extremely high priced.  SEASONING:  The dishes were not seasoned as one would expect for Moroccan food.  They were quite bland without any apparent seasoning or spices . The chef had a very heavy hand with the salt.  We both commented on how very salty the food was...to the point of discomfort.  The couscous dish arrive without any sauce or juice, making the food seem very dry.  SERVICE:  The service was slow and unattentive.  The food took about 30 minutes to arrive.  It seems with this type of slow service, the restaurant would provide at least flatbread at the table to keep diners occupied.  Our waitress did not return to check in after the food was served and only asked how things were after we had finished.  We said it was \"okay\" and she seemed satisfied with that?  AMBIENCE:  The new decor is pleasant.  However, the restaurant did not have a welcoming feel due to the lack of staff engagement.  We walked out the door after paying and there was no \"thank you\" or \"good bye\" or any staff in sight to even notice we were leaving.      I'm very sad to have had such a disappointing experienced at Marrakesh, and wish I could have provided a better review."}
{"text":"I honestly don't understand how there can be so many 1-2 star reviews of this place. I went there three times during the summer of 2014 and every time it was fantastic. The owner was quite nice, and the tagine was very good (I've had the vegetable, chicken, lamb, and beef). Maybe they used to have problems, but ironed them out? Maybe these people are all comparing it to restaurants they have eaten at in Morocco? I don't know.  The bottom line is: I loved the place and would certainly go back."}
{"text":"We just went to Marrakesh for New Years Day. The food was amazing and our server was really nice. Probably the best hummus I've ever had. Try the mint tea. Our server had some extremely rude customers but our service was great despite the restaurant being very busy and those rude customers making her night miserable. I would definitely go back and would recommend you visit."}
{"text":"I wish Yelp would allow for half stars, because in that case I would have given Marrakesh 3 1/2 stars.   I was always a huge fan of the Shish Cafe and sad to see it close. So when I read about Marrakesh in the paper I was so excited to go try it that I went there for dinner the same day I read about it.   They did an amazing job cleaning up the exterior and interior of what used to the Shish. The restaurant looks much cleaner and more appealing overall with fresh vibrant colors. They also put up drywall where you used to be able to see into the kitchen which is nice and the restaurant looks more spacious than it used to.   Our server was very friendly and attentive. I had the mint tea which was outstanding. We also had the eggplant appetizer Zaaluk which was also really good. I wish they would have served more pita bread with it.   For an entree I ordered the Chicken Tajine and my partner ordered the Chicken Brochette. Both were served with rice. The portions were not as big as I would have thought they would be for the price. I wish there would have been more food. The Tajine was good. I was a little disappointed in the olives that were used. I expected big juicy mediterranean olives and instead they were simple pimento olives. I cannot recall the name of the Moroccan restaurant that used to be downtown Madison but there Chicken Tajine tasted better in my opinion. Their sauce was better and the flavor of the preserved lemon was more prevalent. My partner's Chicken Brochette was excellent. The chicken was seasoned perfectly and the meat was really tender. The yoghurt dipping sauce was great and you could tell it had some sour cream mixed into it.   I will definitely go back again. Like I said I just wish their portions were bigger."}
{"text":"My wife and I had an excellent dinner at Marrakesh tonight. The Moroccan soup was hot and very tasty. The lamb couscous was very flavorful. The price was more than reasonable for the quantity and quality of the food. We had a lovely chat with the owner. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ate dinner here and the food was fantastic.  We asked for recommendations on what to order and the server did not steer us in the wrong direction.  We had the Makouda as an appetizer, which was very tasty.  You don't need the yogurt dressing because the makouda is good just on its own.  We each ordered a Tagine as an entrée, mine had lamb and my boyfriend ordered the vegetarian version.  The broth was very flavorful and the lamb was very tender.    We ordered the Baklava for dessert and this was, by far, the best baklava we've ever had.  Served with the mint tea (which is somewhat sweet), the combination was delicious.   The service was a little slow towards the end of the meal, but we will definitely be coming back here again.  We'd like to try the kabobs next time."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from Marrakesh through Mr. delivery since I was visiting in town and thought the menu sounded nice. Unfortunately I wasn't impressed.  We ordered a vegetable tangine, chicken tangine, Mohamara dip and vegetarian Bastila. The tangines were very disappointing. They had little flavor or spice. I have made a more flavorful tangine in the past myself. My husband thought the same of his chicken dish. The green beans in the vegetable version were canned and not fresh. The portions were very small and barely covered the bottom of the take out box. I would not recommend this dish.  The Mohamara dip was okay but also had little flavor. It was slightly greasy. It was also a small portion but with a lot of pita but we still didn't finish the dish.  The Bastila was the best item we got. It had a lot of authentic spice and was full of vegetables. The portion was big. I would recommend it. Overall we would not order here again since most items were disappointing."}
{"text":"We were excited and expecting a good meal.  We were seated and waited not even receiving water while the waiter slowly came and went as if in a trance. Didn't see anything approaching efficiency and lacking any attention whatsoever we walked out.   The restaurant was perhaps a quarter full."}
{"text":"I had been looking forward to eating at Marrakesh and finally got the chance last night for a special dinner with my wife. I couldn't have been more disappointed. We shared a hummus appetizer and the chicken couscous. The hummus was fair, the bread was stale and the entree was terribly over cooked with very little flavor. As someone else noted that this used to be the Shish Cafe makes it even worse.  Our waiter was very friendly which is the only reason I gave 2 stars and unlike other reviews talking about slow service, we had little wait since there was almost no one else there. Also, the prices are very high, especially considering what you get."}
{"text":"As a regular visitor from San Francisco, Madison's new Moroccan restaurant, Marrakesh, did not disappoint. Marrakesh is the real deal. The new benches, upholstered in gorgeous moroccan brocade fabric with lovely patterned wood trim evoke some of the elegant restaurants I ate at in Fes. And the food is excellent! We started with zaaluk, a cooked \"salad\" of slightly smoky eggplant with tomatoes and onions and peppers. Not spicy but deeply flavored. Our main courses, both tagines, were terrific. My cousin had the fish tagine, with long cooked salmon and vegetables and I had the beef with prunes. The beef was perfectly tender, no knives needed! the dishes had been cooked in the oven for hours, as is the tradition and reflected the subtle spices of Moroccan cooking. The salmon was delicious, not tasting overcooked despite  the long,slow time in the oven.  We finished with sweet mint tea and enjoyed the decor of hand-woven carpets and pierced metal table lamps giving a mysterious feel to the corners of the room.Youssef, the owner and head chef, was very present in the dining room and made sure our dinner was excellent.  Go to Marrakesh, it is really like a trip to Morocco."}
{"text":"I've never eaten *in* here before, so I can't speak to the service or decor much at all. It's pretty dark is all I can so.  Marrakesh catered for a Thomas Piketty book club event we had, and we ordered tons of stuff: meditterean (sp) salad, hummus, vegetables, and chicken tagine. All of us thought the food was off the charts, and I didn't think it was too oily and greasy at all (like I sometimes do with Moroccan restaurants). If you are looking for ethnic cuisine that's less commonplace in Madison, I'd definitely check them out.  They are a little hard to find because of poor signage, but with a couple U-turns, you should get to it without trouble."}
{"text":"I will be adding this to my list of places that deserves repeat visits!  Stopped in for carryout since it is close to a friends new home & wanted to check out food options nearby.  The decor is amazing... great textiles on the bench seating.  The waitress was very helpful with menu suggestions while we browsed & recommended the lamb tagine & to definately try the desserts.  We decided to add the falafel & makouda (potato croquette) appetizers as well as the Oasis tartlet dessert made with chocolate & figs.  While waiting for our take out order, the waitress was very engaging and had a chance to meet the owner as well, who was most welcoming.  Once home, we were very pleased with the selections... and glad the waitress steered us towards the lamb, which in my past experiences can be either great or horrible... definately a wonderful choice.  The dessert was beautiful AND tasted heavenly, not overly sweet but the perfect end to our meal.  Next time I will definately dine in to enjoy the atmosphere a while longer!"}
{"text":"Ate here last night and the food was to die for! My husband and I decided to check it out with another couple. We started with the falafel, which was excellent - moist but not greasy. The makouda was also very good as well.   Our husbands both had tagines - mine had the lamb and my friend's husband had the beef, which I had a bite of and it was very good. The dates in the beef were a delight. I had the chicken bastilla, which was dusted in powdered sugar and cinnamon. It was a sweet and savory delight!  For dessert we tried the flavor of sahara, which my friends were crazy about but I thought it was a little chewy. The mint tea was very good.   The food was excellent and we all were very pleased and immediately were talking about when we could go back. Our waitress seemed new but she was very sweet and helpful. My only complaint was the bar menu - it seemed like there was a lot of wine but only a selection of five pretty standard beers. My friend also ordered a gin and tonic, pretty standard, but they didn't have tonic. I think he ended up having a gin and sparkling water, lol.   Overall the food was very good, the staff was friendly and helpful, and we will definitely be going back here again."}
{"text":"I have no idea how they got such high reviews on Trip Advisor. The food was bland and the service wasn't much better. It was also uncomfortably warm in the dining area. I saw one couple walk out. Sadly disappointed."}
{"text":"I will start with the positives: Best hummus and dinner I've eaten in a long time. I would love to give this 5 stars because the food was amazing but it was far overshadowed by the worst service I have ever experienced. Dinner in all took over 2 hours and there were only 5 tables (all of whom were talking about how long it was taking) we got there at 6:45 on a tuesday so I don't know what the problem was. We and others never even got silverware, even after being served our main course, and had to ask multiple times for the check.   I definitely will go back but will make sure to not be in a hurry."}
{"text":"Traveled to Madison this weekend for a concert, and decided to look for things that are difficult to get back home. Fortunately, we ended up finding out about this establishment. Never having tried Moroccan cuisine, and always up for trying out new things, my party of culinary adventurers headed to this establishment when they opened.  The exterior is a little worse for wear, and it doesn't look like anything to write home about. Do not believe this impression. It is false, and will lead you astray. Listen to this friendly gourmand, and walk through that front door. The establishment is very nicely decorated, cozy and comfortable, despite having plenty of seating. One side of the restaurant is very standard chairs and tables, another side seems more \"traditional\". Lots of cushions, etc.  We were greeted by an extremely friendly gentleman, and were promptly directed to a table. After being seated and procuring water, he did something I've not really encountered often in a ethnic restaurant. He offered to either let us review the menu as is, or if we wanted, he would give us more information about the dishes, cultural relevance, etc. Being a very curious bunch, we opted for the later.  After a brief but interesting crash-course on the menu, we opted for ordering a handful of appetizers as well as our entrees. To start, we got the sampler plate, which contained hummus (It's hummus. 'nough said), zaaluk, (grilled eggplant blended with tomatoes, green pepper, garlic, olive oil, and other spices) and mohamara (roast rep pepper dip with walnuts, artichokes, garlic, and other spices), as well as makouda (potato, carrots, spinach, garlic, cumin, fried into a croquette, with a dill yogurt sauce). Excellent flavors, a very nice tanginess to the zaaluk and mohamar. Normally I despise eggplant, but found myself repeatedly reaching for more. The makouda was heavenly. Kind of like a weird cross between kibee, falafel, and samosa.  For our entrees, myself and my friend Brian ordered the lamb tagine, a stew of lamb, potatoes, carrots, green beans, tomatoes, peas, onion, garlic, cilantro, and parsley. The lamb was amazingly tender, the dish was piping hot, the vegetables still had a good crunch to them despite being in a stew, and the side of rice complemented it wonderfully. The taste was kind of an interesting cross between Indian and Middle-Eastern. Larger quantity of sauce, like Indian, but the spices were much more layered like Middle-Eastern.   My friend Cindy ended up getting the vegetarian bastila (phyllo dough die with carrots, spinach, potatoes, onion, and garlic). It ended up being a misunderstanding, but one hell of a fortunate one. I got to sample a piece, kind of a vegetarian pastie.  For a beverage, I had the Moroccan blended red wine (cabernet, syrah, and merlot from Moroccan wineries), a very light touch of sweetness to an otherwise dry red that complimented the stew nicely. Cindy had the Moroccan mint tea, a sweet, nice delicate mint tea prepared traditionally. (Courtesy of the aforementioned information, we got an amusing anecdote about why it's served how it is)  Desert was, of course, a piece of baklava. Delightful crispy, not overly nutty, and just enough sweetness. A nice molasses drizzle to boot. They even cut the piece into smaller sections so we could share (I'm the only one that had room for it, so I'm the only one that actually ordered it)  The prices were reasonable, towards a little on the higher end, but very much well worth it. There was a couple mix-ups with orders, both at our table and others around us, leading me to think it might be somewhat understaffed, and our friendly, helpful server was extremely soft spoken, so when more people started to filter in, it got a bit difficult to hear him. That aside, service was extremely prompt, very friendly, and the dishes were all brought out piping hot.  If you're the adventurous type that likes to try new things, or a fan of cuisine from the region, I highly recommend this establishment. My group left full and happy."}
{"text":"\"I have a bad feeling about this...\"  I first attempted to visit this place during their opening 2 weeks. When I went, the dining rooms were quite full, but all the diners looked unhappy.  The harried waiter said that we coudl eat there, but it would take 1.5 hours to get our food due to the kitchen and servers being too busy. It was not laziness on his part, but rather that there were 2 servers for 2 dining rooms. I saw diners who looked very unhappy with nothing in front of them. We quickly left.  I returned in 2014 for dinner and fortunately it was not the chaos we previously encountered. The layout of the restaurant is very odd--I get the feeling it would be more successful if they didn't have 2 dining rooms. At night, the curtains to the dining room are halfway  up; however, it doesn't block the headlights of cars that park directly in front of the building so you get big shining lights in the restaurant if someone's starting up their car.  When asked, we said that we were OK sitting anywhere in the restaurant, which was at less than 25% of capacity. Yet we were placed in a table in view of the restroom.    I'm not sure our server checked on how we were doing 1x while we were eating.  The dishes were really expensive; you basically have 3 kinds of main entrees and a lamb tagine is $17 with no sides or appetizers.  As for the food, if you told me that the tagine was from any part of the world, I would have believed you. It did not have any distinctive flavor other than meat&veggie stew.  The b'stilla, a dish with cinnamon, sugar, eggs, pastry dough, and chicken, was all right but a little more quiche-like than being encrusted in pastry.  I am very glad we had a Bucky Book coupon as this was not worth the full price, and I don't really consider it to be worth the coupon price either."}
{"text":"We have eaten here twice and really liked it.   - Falafel: the best I've had in Madison. Crispy on the outside, moist on the inside and perfectly seasoned. - Lamb tagine - rich, delicious, and generous portion - Hummus - also delicious, some of the best I've had in town - Vegetable tagine - tasty and cooked perfectly - Lemon chicken -- it's hard to cook white meat without drying it out, but they pull it off. Would be even better if it came with vegetables. - The wine list looks great - look forward to trying a few. - Dishes come with saffron rice, which has always been cooked just right. - The mint tea is very sweet (Moroccan style) and also flavorful - My only concern is the portion sizes relative to the pricing, and the salad. Greens besides iceberg lettuce should be served for a salad of that price."}
{"text":"Lovely ambience...very colorful and comfortable.  Arrived on Tuesday night, party of two. during visit with a relative.  Seated in a wonderful window spot and received attentive service from a warm male manager.  Very gracious.                                        We loved the two appetizers with warm, fresh pita bread...hummus and  mohamara.  Try the mohamara...beautiful coloring and exquisite flavor.  The lamb tangine was a 10.  The seafood bastille was a 10.  I would have welcomed more seasoning spices...encourage owner to experiment with giving customers ability to spice it up.  Am sure the owner has to ride the line between people who don't care for too much spice vs those of us who live for knock-out flavor.  The lamb was meaty...no fat.  We cut it with our forks. The seafood was ample.                                  We concur with other reviews that some salad type dish or a soup would be a highly desirable \"included\" accompaniment to the entree.  On the higher side for what I would normally prefer to spend, but I know seafood is expensive and lamb is expensive.  Will return my next visit to Madison."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would.  I got food poisoning from this establishment.  I feel bad, because I can tell the woman who owns the place is a kind lady, but due to my food poisoning issue,  I think she really needs to rethink what they are doing in the kitchen.  I ordered the soup, the chicken rafissa (sp?) and my hubby ordered the chicken bastilla.   The soup tasted as if it was minestrone with a few added spices.  Not luxury and it was lukewarm.  The chicken rafissa seemed like it tasted ok! It was heavy looking---not much color in the dish---just a brown sloppy appearance.  But the crisped up puff pastry was what I was looking for.  Unfortunately, the pastry was overly drenched in oil---too greasy for my liking. The flavors were ok, but it was too heavy overall.  My experience with moroccan food previously was not so drab.   But, I did eat a majority of it, as it wasn't that bad.  The chicken was ok, but it seemed lukewarm as well.  I can guarantee that this was not made fresh, but simply reheated and put in a tagine for decoration.  They forgot my saffron rice, and when the waitress (finally) came back and asked how things were---she finally gave me some---very little actually....  My hubby liked his chicken bastilla. I had a bite and didn't much care for the flavor combination---im not a fan of sweetness from cinnamon and savory egg at the same time.    The bill came back with soup being charged extra. On the  topic of prices---This food is WAY overpriced. IT should have been 7 bucks for my meal.   If this restaurant is going to survive, which I'm not sure---They need to be willing to rethink how they do things in the back of the kitchen.  Whatever they did gave me food poisoning.   THey need to cook things fresh, have better attention todetails and also have lesser prices."}
{"text":"Strangely inconsistent reviews of this place. Many poor ones on Yelp,  yet it's rated the #1 restaurant in Madison on Trip Advisor. Our experience was very positive.  Between the three of us,  we had three variations on the tagine; chicken,  beef and lamb. Each was prepared quite differently and all were very tasty.   The owner was our server. It was very obvious she has a passion for her cooking and the use of only high quality ingredients.  I felt prices were appropriate and portions were large. Recommended."}
{"text":"We just had a brilliant meal.  Service was warm and friendly.  The flavors of the lamb with apricot and chicken tagines were exceptional.  Appetizers Zaaluk with pita bread and Makouda croquettes are recommended. Atmosphere is improved 200% over the smelly and dark dining room of the pervious restaurant.  The new owners are thoughtful and here to share there special recipes."}
{"text":"I was really excited to see a Moroccan place open in Madison. Unfortunately, this place did not live up to my expectations. The ambiance was a little uncomfortable, the food was mediocre, the service was slow, and the prices were steep.   We were seated at one of the tables against the wall, which is one long bench/booth adorned with cushions. The idea is cute, but in reality it is just uncomfortable. There is a reason food is served at a table with chairs that reach it adequately. Also, another group was seated at the same bench as us, and was sitting literally inches away from me when the restaurant was fairly empty and there were several open tables. Talk about awkward! The music was too quiet, and it felt like you couldn't talk openly at your table, as the whole room could hear you. Also, one of the waiters kept staring at our table, which made me feel even more uncomfortable.  We ordered the Lamb Tagine and the Chicken Couscous. The food took a long time to come. It was decently spiced, and the chicken was cooked really well. I was impressed with how juicy it was. The lamb, on the other hand, was dry and overcooked. Tagine usually has some dried apricot and lemon in it, both of which were lacking. Both dishes tasted almost the same, which is strange because they are very different dishes. The saffron rice that came with the tagine was a frightening bright yellow-orange color. Saffron does impart color on rice, but never that bright. It looked like they had put turmeric in it to make it even more colored. I've had some amazing Moroccan food at restaurants in Los Angeles, and sadly this food did not compare.  While our waitress was very nice, she simply didn't come by enough to check on our water, etc. Given that the restaurant was pretty empty, this was unexpected.   The dishes on the menu were all around $15-18, and the portions are pretty small. In my experience, Moroccan restaurants are on the more expensive side, but we're in Madison, people, come on! This city is supposed to be affordable! The BF was still hungry after dinner, and I was actually able to finish my whole meal and still felt dissatisfied. I almost never finish my meal when I eat out, so that's saying something.  I think I'll just wait till I'm back in LA to have Moroccan food again."}
{"text":"This place is great. I went with 2 friends. We ended up getting a vegetarian tagine, a chicken tagine, and a lamb tagine with apricots. All were amazing! Aromatic! Tasty! We immediately understood why this place is rated the #1 restaurant in Madison on Trip Advisor!  We also got the baklava, which was to die for! The mint tea was delicious as well.   The food was perfect and our waitress was the owner and the chef! She was very friendly and welcoming. We felt like we were family.  I returned another time and had the vegetarian couscous! It was amazing.   Both times I went it was super busy. The service was fine! I don't know what people are talking about. It's not a fast-food chain, obviously, it might take 15 minutes for your food to come out."}
{"text":"We ate here in the first week they were open. The service was really, really slow, but I suspect that will improve as they figure things out, and it is not the reason for the 2 star review. The food was.   At first, things seemed great. We were promptly seated (although we were only the second table there) and promised a complimentary Turkish tea. After about 10 minutes the tea arrived. It was herbal, sweet, and delicious. However, we had not seen our waiter at all between being seated and getting the tea, so we didn't order until then and it felt slow.   We started with the hummus, which was very good, and accompanied by a wonderful light, slightly chewy bread. For a main course, I ordered the Chicken Tagine, and my husband got the Beef Tagine. Both were disappointing. The chicken was dry and overcooked, which is a little odd for a tagine dish. There was very little sauce, and two small strips of preserved lemon and a few olives. It also was absolutely under seasoned and under salted. The beef tagine was also overcooked, dried out, and tough. It was also a very cheap cut of beef, a very fibrous cut (like chuck) and honestly, for a $15 dish, I expect a little higher quality meat. It was literally about $3 worth of beef, with a hard cooked egg and a few prunes. It was also under seasoned, which given the description on the menu was surprising.   Overall, it felt like the meal (at about $50 total with tax and tip - no drinks) was not worth the price, and I do not often say it. It's too bad, because the Shish Cafe (which used to occupy the space) was really excellent."}
