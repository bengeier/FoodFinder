{"text":"Rude driver speeds down narrow streets radio so loud he can't even tell his boss is calling him to straighten him out. If that's how they represent themselves I will take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Glorious fried wings, sauce on the side. This is definitely their best item!
Pizza is great, too, including specialty pizzas.
Fast delivery in the local neighborhoods.
Highly recommended"}
{"text":"I came here with my sister looking to pick up a few orders of food for my family, as I'm visiting my grandparents here in Swissvale. When I tried to order a fettuccine alfredo, I was told that I could only get it in a catering size. We weren't planning to eat that much, so we ordered three orders of spaghetti and meatballs. Our food took very long despite the restaurant being virtually empty, and the food was average when we received it. Overall, they could improve the menu and wait times."}
{"text":"My friend got deathly sick after eating half a cheese steak hoagie. Never had, but that's enough for me."}
{"text":"We've been searching for a delicious local pizza delivery joint, and this place FULLY fits the bill.  So far, this is the best delivery we've had in regards to pizza.  We ordered a large plain, fried mushrooms, and bread sticks.  Firstly, the gentleman that took our order was patient and didn't rush me off the phone, which I feel is something that happens often when you call places for delivery.  Secondly, the driver called us when he was running a few minutes behind.  Honestly, when he called, I hadn't even thought he was running behind yet.  Lastly, the food was delicious and portions ample.  The bread sticks looked to be hand-stretched dough (assuming, here), there were a ton of mushrooms in our order, and the pizza passed the 7-year-old test.  :)  We'll definitely be ordering from them again.  Can't wait to try some of the other stuff on their menu."}
{"text":"No frills, just your normal neighborhood pizza shop keeping us fed.
And i thank you for that.
Not something to go out of your way for but definitely worth the try if your around. Not too many other choices in Swissvale so..... WHY NOT!
The pies vary by who is there cooking, people will remain anonymous. Weekdays seem a little better than weekends, in my opinion. But I'm just about critic that wouldn't pass a pizza up anyway.
Wings are on point. Average size.
Haven't expanded to much further into the menu because of a shop got a good pie I look no further."}
{"text":"We ordered a small pepperoni pizza and a dozen wings from here last night. We ordered the honey garlic wings and were pleasantly surprised that the sauces come in cups on the side. This is perfect because my fianc√© likes his wings dry while I like them saucy! The pizza was delicious and extra cheesy. Prices were reasonable and they delivered right when they said it would. Overall a 5/5 experience!"}
{"text":"I had recently entertained the menu at Maldinis in swissvale. My first impression was as follows dark unclean and unfortunately
That was just the beginning. My order was pizza, and wings....I've been spoiled by going to places for food that actually knew what they were doing. At Maldinis you are \"in for it\"., an experience you shall not soon forget. The wings are over cooked and dry as the gobi desert.
Then you have to actually buy small containers of the sauce that they should've been submerged in, and the additional charges for Bleu cheese and celery. However they did add some flavorless powder to the wings as they came out of the fryer, but this only served to make possible a hardened crust resembling dark brown tasteless crud. When the server asked if I wanted a box to take the product home with me I replied \" my dog eats better than that\" .I paid the bill and left, but I still can't forget that one burning question......how is it that a pizza place can be so poorly run, yet remain open????"}
{"text":"Went in to get a slice for my daughter.I went to order and the staff completely ignored me. When I finally got their attention and ordered we waited for like 20 minutes (empty shop). When they gave us the slice it resembled a pizza from a school cafeteria. It might have even tasted worse then it looked. terrible!"}
{"text":"Great prices, pretty good food. The wings are our favorite! The Sicilian pizza is perfect for kids!!"}
{"text":"So good for delivery in the East 'burbs. Personal favorites: Buff Chick Egg Rolls, Barbecue Chicken Fries, and sandwiches that are really hoagies. So good!"}
{"text":"I have never had a calzone with bread so delicious. You don't have to dip it with sauce. The bread is definitely a 10."}
{"text":"Subs and calzones are really good and the wings are some of the best I have ever had. Delivery is always prompt. Really glad this shop is in my town."}
{"text":"Ordered on the Slice app when I was moving. Driver called three times but I wasn't near my phone. Never showed up.  Called restaurant and they told me he was on his way. Still never showed up. Called to cancel order and was hung up on. Good luck running a business like that."}
