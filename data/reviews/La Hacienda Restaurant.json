{"text":"Meh. You'd think that there wouldn't be much to be said about greasy Mexican food, but that doesn't seem to be true in La Hacienda's case. Not on my part though; they've got a pretty decent reputation online, particularly where weekend brunch is concerned. The Internet is full of lots of reviews, lots of check-ins, and lots of positive feedback.  I'd say most of that good stuff online about them is dead wrong.   La Hacienda is a decent little place at first walk-in: cozy, dimly lit, the kinda place you'd expect to find on this stretch of Queen West. With a mostly-covered back patio full of comfortable seating and nicely placed greenery, it seems like the perfect place to hide on a Sunday afternoon.  But one thing is for sure, it isn't the perfect place to eat. The menu is mostly unimaginative with few signs of thought or effort. Boring chicken and beef burritos and greasy chorizo hash is what you'll be eating. Mostly everything comes with a side of their store bought corn chips and homemade salsa, but again, that salsa isn't made with any degree of love or passion for food; just a bunch of cubed tomatoes with little seasoning. La Hacienda sure doesn't have the fresh-chopped tomatoes and cilantro and killer guacamole you'd expect of a Mexican joint. This place doesn't have one dam authentic thing about it.   Perfect for a hot, Sunday afternoon, they also serve in-house made Sangrias by the glass or pitcher. Unfortunately, they're far from perfect too. Cheap red wine, mixed with pre-frozen orange juice, and few bits of floating fruit, it's again, a big miss from the freshness most people associate with Sangrias. Call me crazy, but for 6 bucks a glass, I want some fresh-squeezed orange juice and fresh slices of orange and limes cut specifically for that purpose. I want the red wine they choose to have flavour that compliments citrus, not just whatever is laying around and recently opened.  On this particular day, La Hacienda was brutally understaffed with one server and one cook; hardly enough to accommodate the back-patio alone, nevermind the front of the place. While still friendly, the server was obviously struggling to keep everyone happy; never returning to check on how people liked their food, which I assume they didn't. She was so busy in fact, that I didnt even have the heart to tell her how crappy everything was for fear that one misguided detail like that would throw her off her game completely.  Seriously, this place is should be on your avoid list. There is absolutely nothing special, or Mexican for that matter, about it at all. It's just greasy, over-priced, 'Mexican' themed food served in a hipster shop on Queen West. If you're looking for authenticity, you've got a ton of other way-better options in this city."}
{"text":"La Hacienda isn't your typical mexican restaurant,  This is where you can get simple mexican food without the huge plates of melted cheese and refried beans that you might find at other resturants.  I have only ever had the burrito and enchiladas but both were fab along side a nice salad.  This is one of my favorite spots in Toronto and it is a great place to bring out of town rock friends who want to dine somewhere charming.  The back patio is fun, the prices are great and the Margaritas are excellent!!"}
{"text":"Veggie options abound, and never disappoint! Service is always great, and the atmosphere is undeniably queen west. I always feel like I am at home here! They have been consistent for the 15+ years I have been a patron. I have never been let down. Large, filling portions and a great weekend brunch too!"}
{"text":"Wow, would never recommend this place in a million years. Food was horrible. I ordered a burrito -- it was strange because there wasn't any rice in this burrito... it was way too soggy there were only three things: shrimp, beans, and weird onions or cabbage.  Chips were okay. Tostistos put in the microwave. Overpriced as well: $14.   Place was pretty dead, but food took FOREVER to prepare."}
{"text":"Three of us went to have a cheap dinner.  The atmosphere is pretty good and the servers were helpful, when you could get their attention.   My burrito was okay, needed more variety in the fillings.  I think it only had chicken, cheese and lettuce.  To compensate I asked for guacamole and two salsas.  The mango-habanero was tasty and HOT!"}
{"text":"I came here because I was reaaaally craving mexican food. I ordered the burrito with the side of nachos. The burrito was stuffed with chicken, melted cheese, and black beans. I was disappointed because it tasted nothing like mexican food, it was actually quite bland. The nachos were also very saltless. I did not enjoy my meal here at all.  I won't be coming back, I find that fast food burrito places taste more mexican than the food here. I payed $15 total for my meal.  I gave a 2 star rating because the customer service was good and staff was friendly."}
{"text":"The food is nothing special. I've had better, I've had worse. The service is the absolute worst, the waitress rarely visited out table despite there only being 4 other tables in the entire restaurant. It took more than 45 min to get a drink, let alone a menu."}
{"text":"This place is really disappointing.  With many great Mexican inspired places in Toronto I would assume that a place with such a great location and storefront would actually pay some attention to what they are selling.    -Drinks are too sweet -Terrible cheese less nachos (these were and insult) -Flavourless enchiladas with over steamed rice - also no flavour  Essentially everyone we were with agreed that this food was garbage.  I'm actually getting angry writing this review."}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is nice and laid back. The service is unquestionably slow, but it kind of goes with the whole vibe. Not the kind of place you would want to go if you have somewhere to be, but if you're just looking to hang out until you decide it's time to leave it's good for that. The only thing we had to eat was the nachos and they were passable at best."}
{"text":"Back patio and purposeful hole-in-wall atmosphere are good. Service is great. But none of these factors are enough to make up for the fact the food is decent at best."}
{"text":"We ordered nacho chips with guac and salsa. The nacho chips came heated (that's nice!). Guac was nothing to write home about, and salsa was actually quite spicy. Wish they gave a bit of sour cream with it... I ordered a hacienda, it was spicy in a good way, but it was pretty dry. The chicken bits were dry, and even the bed of rice tasted old, like it was made a long time ago. Their sangria is TOO salty, and all I tasted was salt. I wish they had used that salt on my food instead. They have a small beer selection, but they have hard to find brews, like the Wellington. Verdict: I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst burrito I've ever had. No sour cream, no salsa, and no guacamole. Then it was tossed in the oven so even the lettuce was hot. This is also the first time I got store bought chips at a \"Mexican\" restaurant."}
{"text":"Don't go there if you are looking for Mexican food or you will be severely disappointed. Go there if by \"burrito\" you mean overpriced, bland and toasted wrap. Huh? Toasted burrito? Go there if you want to pay lots of money for oven heated Tostitos (as if the warmth will trick people into thinking they are homemade tortilla chips?), sickly sweet salsa from a jar and 3 scoops of guacamole. I should have known better and walked right out as soon as I saw that it was a bunch of hipsters preparing and serving the \"Mexican\" food."}
{"text":"Grocery-store Tostitos-brand chips and salsa, over-priced, below average texmex, slowish service in a decent queen street pub environment. Something like Sneaky Dees but without the noise and throngs of college students. if you're just looking for a beer with friends, and don't mind eating roughly Kraft Dinner-quality food when you get the munchies, this could be the place for you."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and really enjoyed this place. They have a back patio which is really nice. Drinks are fairly cheap and they have mill street organic on tap which I am a big fan of. The service here is pretty good as well. All the servers I've had were very friendly and very helpful.  If you do go here, you have to order the chorizo nachos (preferably with a side order of guacamole). Aside from sneaky dee's, they are probably the tastiest nachos I've had in toronto - they also come with the added bonus of not having to go to sneaky dee's. Aside from the nachos I've had their breakfast burrito (which was great), their vegetable chili with corn bread (ok) and a chicken burrito (meh).  All in all, I would recommend this place for a post work/pre bar drink and snack, though not for dinner."}
{"text":"This was not the greatest experience.  Waiting an hour and a half for a burrito is definitely not the greatest experience.  Granted, there appeared to be one frantic maybe on acid server trying to manage the entire restaurant that night, and, alas, a table of about 20 people celebrating a birthday. Dirty dishes were literally being picked up and piled on one end of the bar because they were so short-staffed.  We were warned it might a bit of a wait. But seriously? Waiting that long for nachos, and that long for burritos? And paying that much? The nachos, I confess, were pretty tasty and light, and loved that it came with optional spicy salsas. The half-plate was big enough for our table of 5 to share as a starter. If we'd known we'd have to wait so long for our entrees to arrive, perhaps we would have ordered the full size and called it a night.  The burritos were okay - a bit too meaty for my liking (I prefer veggies and rice and the works worked in there), though there were some good reviews for their Haciendas. Definitely an \"off\" night for them, but alas, that's not a good enough excuse to invite me in again."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Latino/Mexican brunch in town. Bar tender and cook are nice and the food is delicious. Simple yet tasty. The decoration and the ambiance are great, very authentic, with old furniture. I love the place."}
{"text":"Service was terrible, food was horrible, and they charge extra for salsa/hot sauce. Which Mexican restaurant doesn't have hot sauce? I'd definitely not recommend this place."}
{"text":"There is probably worse Mexican-style food in Toronto to be had, but these guys definitely get an A for effort. My girlfriend and I stopped in for a quick bite on the way to a party a week ago. I had a chicken enchilada which consisted of totally flavourless chicken smothered in ragu sauce and baked with cheese on top. No beans, peppers, onions or anything that would make it halfway tasty. My girlfriend's chorizo-nacho-type thing was marginally better. This would have all been bearable, except for that (adding insult, injury and so on) no one ever stopped by to ask us if we wanted more drinks or check on the food. We probably could have walked out and no one would have noticed. Unfortunately for me, I paid the ridiculous $50 bill and left like a chump."}
{"text":"Beautiful sunny day in Toronto...patio time!  The patio at La Hacienda was the best thing about this restaurant unfortunately.  The service was quick although there were only 4 other groups in the place at the time.  The chorizo hash and egg bake was oily and lacked any flavour other than salt while the breakfast burrito was just scrambled eggs and black beans rolled up in a tortilla.  A side helping of salsa was provided, which tasted home made.  All in all, a mediocre experience."}
{"text":"La Hacienda Review  Last night I visited La Hacienda on Queen West.  What a mistake.  A friend had recommended it when we were talking about Mexican restaurants.  It was late and my partner and I were hungry, we were driving by and decided to try it.  I should have known when we walked in, just by looking what was being prepared in the exposed kitchen and that this wasn't going to be close to authentic Mexican food.  At first glance, it just seemed like a regular diner.  I wasn't expecting a great meal, but I also wasn't expecting to be annoyed when I left either.  Calling the menu lackluster is an understatement, none of the menu items sounded like there was any thought, passion or even respect for food. I ordered the Beef Burrito thinking it may be a safe choice, how can you really screw up a beef burrito, right?    What arrived was ground beef stewed in what tasted like canned pasta sauce with no seasoning, whatsoever, not even salt...with chopped iceberg lettuce STEWED into the sauce wrapped around a flour tortilla, then toasted.  WHY WAS THE ICEBERG STEWED? WHY WAS THE TORTILLA TOASTED? WHERE WAS THE RICE OR THE BEANS?  WHY WAS THERE NO SEASONING IN A BURRITO?  I was so confused.  None of it made sense.  Then came the cherry on the top, a side of what looked and tasted like no name brand tortilla chips served with stewed tomatoes and onions, which they called \"salsa\".  Again, no salt, no seasoning.  I've never had to use a saltshaker this much at a restaurant.    My partner ordered their Chorizo Chili with \"Cheese\".  Extremely bland, no seasoning, no flavour.  I wonder if they even put any chili pepper in.  I would bet my life savings on the fact that they probably used a no name brand cheddar cheese brick.  Served with the no name chips again.  How authentic.  Service was just ok, the waiter didn't have much of a presence, but it didn't bother us much.  Two cooks in the kitchen, 4 couples in the restaurant having nothing but drinks, still took over 20 minutes to be served our food which was definitely pre-made and reheated.  Last time I take restaurant recommendations from that friend.    At least the Dos Equis was cold."}
{"text":"Attended a great meet-up with Poly's Adventures in Dining.  Indoor / outdoor dining - i didn't even see the interior of this place - it was packed for what i believe was a boxing match ( watching on TV's )  you order at a take-out style window on the outside of the property.  in the front you have meats cooking on a few pits.    The group sat outside near the pits ( kinda hot ! ) - i had 5 different types of tacos  - all  served on double tortillas and a taco bar with onion, cilantro, lime and 3 or 4 different sauces.  I believe the tacos were a $1 ( i had a few margaritas and a few beers and just gave someone $20 and asked them to buy as many tacos as they could  - they brought over at least 3 if not 4 plates of tacos !! )  This is the kinda place to enjoy long after the sun goes down - bring a lounge chair, a cooler with beers and some buddies and start chowing on the tacos  - good stuff !  BUT - bring a designated driver !!"}
{"text":"Guys, this place is great. Is it grand electric with a giant line and beef tongue tacos? No. But, do they have an awesome patio and litres of margaritas? Yes. We had the chicken quesadillas and veggie nachos and both were well above average.  This will become a regular spot, not when I want to feel fancy and dress up or anything. But, that's not really what everything is always about, is it?"}
{"text":"I've been a handful of times now, and am ready to go back.  They have the best guacamole I've found in the city.  I'm from California and highly suspicious of \"mexican\" food in Canada, but this place does relatively well.  My favourite dish is the chicken burrito - the chicken is well seasoned and tender, the tortilla was baked and soft, and it was no problem to substitute guacamole for cheese, but I don't know how I feel about lettuce inside the burrito - would prefer some beans and/or rice.  The rice on the side was a bit bland, but everything else was perfect.  There does seem to be only one guy ever running the place (bartending, hosting, and waiting), and the last time I was there we waited a further 20 minutes after we asked for the bill before I went and asked again.  He's friendly enough, though.    It's nice and dark inside, with a big patio out back shaded by an old tree.  Beer is expensive ($7 pint) but margaritas and sangria are reasonable.  It's a great relaxed date or easy dinner out."}
{"text":"Unlike some of the other reviews I've read, I personally have never had a bad experience at this restaurant.  Sure, I've found the service a little slow at times; but, then again I've always found them to be very friendly and accommodating as well.  In any case, as long as I have a beer in hand, I don't mind a little wait, as I am always there with company for a conversation and a social experience, and certainly not to gobble up fast food.  As for the food, I've only ever had the burritos, and so I cannot comment on anything else from their menu.  Although I've enjoyed them all, I really like the Shrimp, and especially the Chorizo burrito the best.    Seriously, the Chorizo burrito can only be described as awesome.  Each and every time I've had one, I and my guests immediately think of ordering another, but somehow manage to restrain ourselves - ha!  I'm not sure, but I believe that I heard that they get their chorizo sausage from the St. Lawrence Market.  In any case, it is simply the best chorizo I've ever had at any restaurant in Toronto.  I'd give their burritos a 5 star rating, but I do agree with other reviewers that they are a little pricey for an otherwise seemingly run-down, hole-in-the-wall, Queen St W cantina."}
{"text":"My friends were craving Mexican so I decided to bring them to La Hacienda as I recalled walking by it earlier that day. We ordered 3 Chorizo burritos, one Chorizo enchilada and a pitcher of Margarita. Our meal took almost 30 minutes to prepare, despite being one of only two occupied tables. The burritos were very small and consisted only of Chorizo, cheese and beans. It also came with store bought Tostidos with a tiny portion of salsa on the side which is a huge no no my opinion. The taste was average and for $15 each, we all would have preferred Burrito Boyz/Chipotle (not the best benchmark for authentic Mexican) and get a better tasting burrito that would actually fill us and also put more money back in our wallets. The best part of the meal was the Margarita, but even that came at a steep price of $63. There are definitely better Mexican restaurants around the area with larger portions for the same price."}
{"text":"Not impressed - came here after patio hopping for my birthday. We were drained from being in the sun and asked for lots and lots of water - which we only got one glass each (but she was quick to bring out the beer when asked).  between the 8 of us, we had the chicken and beef enchilada, pizza, and apps.   everyone except for 2 people had stomach issues the next day - not a great experience.  some of the food came out overly spicy and the other really bland."}
{"text":"Awful! Guacamole is just crushed avocado with maybe salt and lime. I've had many guacamoles and my fiancé is a chef it was terrible I had to complain and the server said ya it's just crushed avocado with a touch of salt and garlic I usually suggest adding more salt when customers complain!!! If people have complained before why would you change the recipe? Anyways, we ordered quesadilla and they took so long. It was not busy. 4 other people there. It took about 35 minutes after our salsa and chips app! Music was terrible it was a creepy, loud, scary music.  The whole experience was just awful id never go back or recommend this place. There are many other Mexican/Spanish restaurants  in the city!!!"}
{"text":"A nice, large patio. Generally, good service. Definitely a place for drinks; not for food. On that note, however, lunch for three of us cost over $85, and none of us ordered alcohol. We had the chicken burrito, chicken enchilada, and the chorizo quesadilla. We also shared some veggie nachos. Food was unremarkable.  Kind of a disappointment when we were looking for some good food after walking around on a nice day."}
{"text":"This place used to be a punk bar first of all, so right out the gate it has a history attached to it, which rules. Everything is awesome about this place.  Food's great, feeling is great, the lighting is very nice, cool patio, and everyone who works there is pretty cool. I've been there about 5 times, and it's been pretty stellar."}
{"text":"Found this place for lunch just while walking down the street with some friends. Atmosphere seemed pretty good upon sitting down. I noticed only two people were working here. Food didn't take long and was pretty good. Nothing amazing though.. my friend had got ingredients in her food that she had asked not to have included and only really realized 1/3 of the way through so after we informed the waiter, he apologized and that was it. We were hoping for the \"don't worry, we'll take care of the bill since we messed up\" line but that never happened. Moreover we asked to at least have the tiny cup of $2 sour cream removed from the bill and the waiter disagreed and couldn't understand why were asking that of him but he somehow took it off anyway so that was fine. As we were paying, the waiter so very close and behind my friend as she was paying, making her feel uncomfortable so all in all, it was a poor customer service experience with decent food."}
{"text":"The reviews for this place seem confusing, as it only has 2 stars. I want to clear something up:  If you are coming for MEXICAN FOOD you will likely be unimpressed and give it a low rating.  If you are coming for PATIO DRINKS AND MARGARITAS, you will likely get drunk and get your money's worth, therefore, giving a higher rating.  This is one of thinly places in the city that does a proper margarita and doesn't charge you an arm and leg for a drink with actual tequila in it.   Before you go for Mexican, read the reviews thoroughly. La Hacienda pumps out great drinks and they have an incredible patio. You do the math...food will taste better when you're drunk and can linger. If you want to have trendy braised meat tacos (which are yummy, don't get me wrong) and be kicked out of your seat after an hour and only one cocktail, go elsewhere. personally, I prefer the former."}
{"text":"Food was a 6 out of a 10 but the waiter lady got mad at us because we didn't tip her 15% I'm like once you split the bill if mine is 20 bucks I'm not giving you more then 7 buck tip don't ask or tell us what we were suppose to leave that's very unprofessional and ignorant stay away from this place they jus want to make a quick buck and shitty service and to top it of she kept going outside to smoke I don't want smokey hands touching my food I will notify the CDC about this I'm not one to do this but maybe because we were american and not Canadian I'm not sure but Dian and John where feeling the same way along with the two guys sitting behind us STAY AWAY FROM HERE"}
{"text":"Great little place for Mexican food and pitchers of margaritas, whiskey sours, sangria, etc. Nice back patio, plenty of shade but also full of tables that get sun. Service is a bit slow. On both occassions we were there, the waitress (pretty redhead) informed us it would take a minute, and was attentive throughout our stay. She was honest about it (and looked like she was working alone both times) so props to her for being awesome."}
{"text":"Night out with a couple of girls and we stumbled upon La Hacienda. It was a Tuesday night and the place was empty. This normally puts me off but this area of Queen West was super quiet.  The atmosphere was welcoming the restaurant felt warm and intimate.  So we decided to eat here. We ordered some nachos and house red; to start.   The nachos were nacho-y. They were good, the ground beef was rather delicious. We then ordered some burritos....which were accompanied by rice and salad. My rice was a bit undercooked and crunchy, the burrito was chicken and I remember it being creamy with a decent amount of heat. The guac was perfect.   Dessert; well there was only one choice, vanilla chocolate cake. By this point I was rather drunk. My recollection of the cake was it being lovely. But in this state I could have been served anything and I would have thought it delicious.   Overall, it was fine. The meal and copious litres of house red were reasonably priced.   I most likely would return."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was really NICE and the back patio is a Gem.  Our waiter was super friendly and helpful! The food was ok.  It could had used some sour cream as it both our meals were a tad spicy and dry which our waiter provided at no extra charge. Oh and watch out as the old sign in the front is no longer there.  I almost walked past the place!"}
{"text":"I've never been crazy about the service or the prices at La Hacienda, but  do really love the cozy atmosphere and the decor - very pieced together, with remnants from kitchens of days gone by, not to mention their salad. The house vinaigrette is an extremely fresh raspberry concoction that draws me back on the strength of it alone.  In the summertime, the back patio is a great place for a plate of nachos and a drink with friends."}
{"text":"This dining experience was pretty terrible... save for the margaritas which were served by the litre and pretty delicious. Our server was unmotivated, to put it mildly - she was really interested in her phone, smoking, the guy outside and doing what seemed to be shots at the bar. She messed up our order and forgot to bring the appetizer (which, after seeing what appeared on another table, was probably a blessing in disguise) of chips, salsa and guacamole.  My friend ordered the chili which was bland and tasteless. I had enchiladas which, fortunately, had more flavour but were still the blandest enchilada's I've ever had. Getting our bill was a struggle and, as we stood around waiting with our coats on, finally had to bring the money to the server who was gossiping with a friend at the bar.  I don't understand how a restaurant that performed this poorly can survive in Toronto with its highly competitive restaurant scene."}
{"text":"Got the wrong order from this resto via Hurrier... PS, Hurrier has the worst service. Anyways, I got the wrong order, a chicken burrito instead of beef. If you want a burrito, go anywhere cheaper because La Hacienda is overpriced.. It was sub-par at best, and priced like they do something special, which they don't..."}
{"text":"I only come here on Sunday night when they have a DJ playing psych and soul music. The patio at the back is probably the best thing about this place. Nice and spacious, which is good seeing as the front area is pretty cramped. The bar is pretty minimal and a pint of Creemore was seven dollars, which seems wrong to me for some reason. The bartender wasn't very pleasant either. Not very impressed with this place as a bar -- haven't ate there yet but not exactly rushing.  Last time I was there the men's washroom smelled absolutely revolting. I think the reasoning is because their urinals have no flush system. So you are basically pissing into a hole in the wall. It sounds gross, but there could very well be months of urine sitting in there."}
{"text":"Had brunch at La Hacienda yesterday (Sunday).  A breakfast burrito with chorizo for me, and a salad with chevre for my wife.  The burrito was very good, very large, and came with a health helping of chopped & fried chunks of potatoes.  The salad was also very good.  The place isn't fine dining, but it is comfortable and seemed clean (though you might not think it when you first walk in - its a bit dark).  A bit reminiscent of a diner, the coffee cups certainly came out of one.  $30 for the two of us.  Not bad, I'd certainly go there again.  I'd give it a 3.5 if I could."}
{"text":"This place was cute - even if the food was not Michelin star the drinks were amazingly priced and the service was great !"}
{"text":"LOL, I don't know if they changed the restaurant name recently, but I wasn't aware it was called La Hacienda Hornys BBQ. (ok I'm a child lol)  Anyhow, heard from a friend that this place has awesome ceviche. First time my husband and I came here we ordered from the window outside. Nice friendly lady. They had a grill outside and a man serving tacos. They have seating outside at night under a cabana. Perfect, since it's bearable to be outside after the sun sets here in Vegas and it's nice to eat outside.  I ordered the fish ceviche. It was delicious! Full of flavor and large portions. My husband got the carne asada burrito. Also large and full of flavor. Their tacos are also good.   We ordered ceviche, carne asada burrito and 2 large drinks. The total was like $10. Another time, I ordered ceviche and a taco and it was $5. This place is well priced, and you get more for your money.  At another visit, we shared their Super Nachos. They were super indeed. Very big portions, fresh homemade tortilla chips, nacho cheese, chicken, avocado, and much more. Oh, try their homemade horchata! Best I've ever had. Not too sweet, just right.   The workers don't speak english but, there is usually at least one server who does. Been here a few times now and the service is always great. Nice smiling servers.   Wait time is pretty good. Maybe 5-10 minutes. They also accept credit card."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best.  The most tasteless salsa. Also completely tasteless \"spicy\" black bean burrito. The chorizo hacienda wasn't as described on the menu because rice was on the side, and the sauce was like canned spaghetti sauce and there were no beans. Service was super slow and we weren't told the specials.  If you want a burrito go to burrito boyz (or Cantina if you want to be fancy.)   If you want chips, the salsa and chips are way better at Loblaws.   Assuming this place was only busy because of location."}
{"text":"This is a Mexican Restaurant far away from the neon lights of Las Vegas and is in the Sunrise Manor neighborhood. You pass this place as you go visit Lake Mead if you are anywhere North of the strip like Freemont street. It's a large inside and they serve really good ceviche.  The best ceviche (street style) I've had I have to say. To be fair I've tried a half a dozen decent places and this ceviche is so good you'll scrape the bottom of the styrofoam plate for every last bit of it. Yeah, I wasn't even that hungry too which makes it that good (for me).  Chips are stale but that's the style, their really not stale. The salsa is hot and red.  Observations: It was hot as usual and I decided to see if the fish tacos were any good. I know the ceviche is incredible but I was in a hurry and didn't want to eat ceviche in a car in this weather so I chose a taco. Good but not great. As I waited the only two patrons inside the place were eating asada plates. One guy couldn't help but keep looking at me as if I were some undercover guy looking for Butcho or somebody. He had an incredulous look on his face and kept turning his head over to me like if I was going to rob the place. He couldn't help it, that's the face he was born with I suppose. I finally got my tacos and thanked the two ladies working the front and kitchen at that hour and left. 113 degree weather sucks ass but it's a dry heat at least."}
{"text":"Came for Happy Hour. Sangria was fine enough. Chips and Guacomole were clearly store bought."}
{"text":"La Hacienda  Although I do appreciate the effort to eliminate the Mexican Restaurant Kitsch factor by replacing the typical tacky, sombreroed wait staff with servers that were pulled off the street less for their ability to provide the customer with food and more for their likeliness to wear black and pull of skinny jeans, when they lay my shrimp burrito in front of me bare, that is when I get angry.  I mean what kind of Mexican restaurant gives the customer a burrito with no condiments and no refried beans?   One that wants to make money I guess, but not one that I wish to frequent."}
{"text":"The food tasted good but not mind blowing, the back patio was nice. The service was good. But what i hated though was the portion. Seriously for the price there was barely any food on the plate. The salad that came with it, didn't have a drop of dressing. For the price i could have gotten two fat burritos which would been easily have been two meals."}
{"text":"I felt like I had the Bubonic Plague. The waitress didn't speak to me during the 2 hoursI sat there. Atrocious service.  I will never go back."}
{"text":"La Hacienda has some of the most authentic street tacos in town.  I brought my friend from Mexico here and he fell in love.  Warm, fresh, corn tortillas filled with freshly grilled carne asada, pollo asada, and al pastor, and served with a bar of salsas, cilantro, and onion.    The smells come from about a block away, and the al pastor is cooked on a rotisserie located outside that brings people in just from the sight of it.  Can't blame them, their Al Pastor is what makes this place so special.  Marinated pork layered with pineapple and cooked on a rotisserie?  While it's really hard to mess up Al Pastor, it's also really hard to make Al Pastor that I love, and La Hacienda does it.  While it may be in a random spot of town, it's worth the trip!"}
{"text":"If you're hungry and tempted to eat here, don't bother. You can walk another 10-12 minutes west and go to Milagro where they take pride in their food and service.   The food isn't terrible, it's just lacklustre with limited menu items. My friend had the burrito, I had the nachos. And our lunch took an hour and a half due to the glacial service. We weren't even offered water or asked if we wanted another margarita and had to wave manically to get the attention of someone to get the water.   The one saving grace is the margarita - those are quite outstanding. On the rocks, not too sweet."}
{"text":"Came here for some lunch and discovered there weren't many gluten free options.  The server kindly checked with the kitchen and offered me something off the dinner menu : the empanadas which come with either beef, chicken or beans.  I opted for the beans and went for a corn chip and house salsa side.  My friend went for the chicken quesadilla and was pleasantly surprised with the portion and size of chicken chunks within the quesadilla.  She opted for the rice and salad side. Which she told me was lackluster at best.  We also had limeade and lemonade drinks with our meal and had a hard time distinguishing them.  Overall the service was prompt and the food was satisfactory.  The decor and ambiance was relaxed, quirky and fun.  Will definitely be back for drinks and more food."}
{"text":"I had a great burrito but pretty poor service, plus the tortilla chips are of poor quality and the owners should take a good, long look at themselves and say \"Hey, are THESE the kind of chips I feel good charging $11 for? With this under seasoned spoon of guac?\". Cause if they did, they'd probably whisper to themselves, softly: \"No\"."}
{"text":"After shopping for a bit, a couple of my friends and I decided to look for a place to eat. We decided on this Mexican place. It was very tight and had some chairs and tables and on one side there was bench like seating. We seated ourselves and the service was very very slow. I think it's because they're understaffed and they need more people or they just want to save money, it could be both. There was just one woman working the kitchen and a man waiting tables. He took pretty long with the food. It took maybe 20-25 minutes to get our food. I got the lunch special that had a daily soup, salad, and a burrito. At that point in the day I was really hungry, but come on, store bought chips?! The burrito was cooked okay, chicken was seasoned. Nothing out of the ordinary. The soup was sweet potato chipotle, nothing wrong with it. I was glad with the portions of the burrito but everything else was mediocre. If you're looking for Mexican food, I'm sure there are better places in the area, if you're hungry, come here for average food."}
{"text":"I'm the type of person who will walk and walk and walk and walk until I find a restaurant that I want to eat it at. Last night as I marched my friend down Queen Street, I stopped short in front of La Hacienda and thought \"How have I never eaten here?\" and popped into the dimly lit abyss of a restaurant.  The menu doesn't read so well as it is a simple Mexican menu printed in comic sans (that alone could cost a star), but my friend and I had an absolutely amazing meal. We were so surprised and delighted that we mostly just said \"Om nom nom nom\" and savoured the moments.  Our half litre of sangria was OK, I can't say I was stunned by it, but the goat cheese and cornmeal salad was great. We had just come from the spa and wanted to eat something healthy and the salad did the trick. We also went with the vegetarian open-faced quesadillas and devoured them and the salad that joined them. Everything was beautiful to look at.  The place itself has a great atmosphere and my friend said she could very easily sit there all day and just read a book. Not a bad idea.  We could have stayed there for a few more hours, just chatting and drinking, but it closes at 11 on Tuesday nights. The friendly server mentioned that La Hacienda does brunch and I can only imagine what they do to a plate of huevos rancheros...yum.  Our total meal tipped in at $50, with tax and tip. A bit pricey, not going to lie, but I left feeling healthy and guilt free."}
