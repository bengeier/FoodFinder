{"text":"Visited here a couple months ago but didn't think much about it. I ordered a Wellness smoothie (tasted very good, and is healthy). I decided to come back to it about a month ago and now you'll always catch me stopping by every time I visit the mall.

Visual: Stands out, very clean, and unique! Love the green and monkey theme. Definitely instagram/snapchat worthy.

Food: So far, I've tried their lasagna, chicken caeser wrap, mac&cheese, and fruit cup. By far, my favourite foods in the mall. They were about $5-7 and they offer to warm it up for you. 

Drinks: High recommend! Staff told me that their teas have no artificial flavour or sweetening so it's all healthy and I can feel good about what I'm drinking. They have so many different flavours of teas I hope to try all of them one day. My favourite is the chai tea latte. They also have iced tea of the day which never disappoint me. They'll suggest adding lemonade to their iced teas because again, their teas are pure and unsweetened but it will cost a few cents extra. I've also tried their strawberry white frappe and it was delicious! About $4-5. I've tried their wildberry smoothie and maple beach milk tea as well. Very good! 

Customer Service: By far one of the best customer service I have ever received from a food place. The employees greet you, offer to answer any questions, will help you choose a drink if you're new, always smiling. You also get to watch them make your coffees and drinks and sometimes they will bring the food out to your table. I've been visiting Tea Monkey a lot more regularly lately I wish I caught the names of a few employees. I'm not sure if they don't have too many employees yet or if I'm just visiting way too often but I see the same few quite often. Which isn't a bad thing actually. It's nice to see that they remember their regulars and are always smiling. 

Overall: 5/5. Definitely my new favourite place to get work done and have a cup of coffee or tea while I'm doing my work. They also have a wall of iPads and shelves filled with bags of teas/mugs/cups to buy. They have a stand with free sugars, milk, cream, napkins, and honey. The only thing I think they should do it maybe add a sign to their back door that says \"Staff only\" because I've witnessed so many customers walk in thinking its a bathroom (guilty as charged)."}
{"text":"Very good latte. Friendly staff. provide free wifi. Overall a very nice place to stop by or study a bit."}
{"text":"Nice staff. Good selection of teas. Appreciate that they offer straight teas for the tea purist. Roast beef and turkey sandwiches warmed were tasty. Favourite is the brookies (huge) with a hot tea--very satisfying. :)"}
{"text":"Dropped in for a quick snack because CF was giving out coupons for a buy one get one free drink deal. The prices are what you would expect from a coffee shop. They also offer sandwiches and wraps; they'll suffice for a snack but nothing close to a meal ($3-6) and a selection of baked goods. Got the chocolate smoothie which was banana-y and so smooth, no detectable ice pieces at all! I also got the matcha latte which had SO MUCH MATCHA ._. It was a little too bitter for me but it would be great if you really like a strong matcha flavour. If you buy a sandwich, I got the tuna one which was tasty, you can ask them to warm it up. The staff was very friendly and accommodating and will often come from behind the counter to deliver your food. They also have a row of iPads for kids and customers to play on :D"}
{"text":"Support local businesses!

Ambiance:
I really enjoyed the chill environment here. Came here for a quick snack break. Like everyone else, i preferred the seating near the back instead of the opens by the open entranceway. They have 5 iPad stations for kids to play with and a wall of take-home goods if you wanted to purchase anything.

Food:
I ordered a tuna sandwich for $4.95 (very good heated up) and tea of the day which was a refreshing tropical fruit punch. Next time I'll add honey or lemonade to it as it was a bit plain when I left it that way.

Service:
Overall I received good service. One of the girls kindly asked if I wanted to heat up the sandwich which I sometimes forget that there's an option to. Makes such a big difference! I totally forgot to get that done at the place I went for lunch today.

Overall verdict: you'll find me back in here if I happen to be at Fairview Mall again! :)"}
{"text":"A hidden gem in the mall by Sears on the lower level of Fairview, Tea Monkey is an independently owned coffeeshop from the UK. Everything about this cafe is amazing - their staff, their baked goods, their beverages, their service, the cafe itself. The seats are very comfortable and it's a great place to either study, work quietly, read, have a caffeine date or catch-up with a friend. There's free wifi so you can work (or Instagram, let's be real). Hidden gems rock!"}
{"text":"It was my first time noticing this new cafe to me during my visit to the mall.  Of course I had to give them a try especially seeing the place was empty.  I ordered a tropical fruity herbal iced tea, wasn't sure exactly what it was but the lady recommended it to me as I requested non caffeine teas.  She also gave me the options of sweetening it with various kinds of syrup, honey and I chose cane sugar.  It was very very very delicious.  I also ordered a ham and cheese sandwich, while it looked very ordinary but she heated it up for me and it came out piping hot, it was the best ham sandwich I had in a very long time. 

I now have a new tea place to!  This is sooo exciting especially since I've retired from Starbucks and Teavana. 

Lastly, the last staff was super nice and friendly. I should have noted her name to commend her for her suggestions and helpfulness.  We definitely will be revisiting."}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to give this place a try. I ordered the Iced Coffee Hazelnut Latte, and my friend odered the Maple Peach Black Tea. When I ordered it at the desk, I had to repeat it 3 times, before the person got the order right.  The girl that was prepping our drinks, I assume she was new and had no idea what was what. My drink came first, but there was no milk in it when I asked for it and there was no hazelnut flavour nor sugar in it at all. I went back to asked for just milk..I ended up pouring it myself, but that was ok, I'm fine with that. But I didn't like the drink at all, cuz I basically paid for a iced plain sugarless coffee. My friend's drink was being prepped, but I went to ask for a to go cup cuz they were going to put it in a mug. My friend said there was no maple flavour in the tea, but she can smell n taste a slight hint of peach. Overall our drinks were mediocre. 

I understand maybe the staff is new etc..we didn't complain or anything, but the girl came up to us and offer a free plush monkey to my friend's daughter. That was a nice gesture on their part, b/c I think they sensed that we weren't impressed.

 I will give it sometime and hopefully they have better fully trained staff, that knows their stuff..or they have a better organized system. Because they both looked confused."}
{"text":"This is conveniently located right outside of Sears on the lower level. The ambience of the cafe is very comfortable and I enjoyed my visit very much. This is a fairly new cafe in the fairview mall. It serves a wide variety of drinks and food: hot brew coffee, matcha lattee,  taiwanese bubble tea, herbal tea, etc. I tried the tuna sandwich and a medium matcha lattee. They were very generous with the amount of tuna in my tuna sandwich ad well as the macha powder in the lattee. 
The macha powder is unsweeten, so make sure to order it sweetened (syrup added)if that is what you want. But be aware that they DO charge extra for the syrup. I was surprise to know that (after i paid for the bill)as I wasn't notify by the person who took my order that the syrup would cost extra. I wasn't mad/annoyed as they are generally polite and helpful/cheerful but I thought that it would be nice if they could notify the customers that a sweetened matcha lattee would cost  $.45 more than a normal matcha lattee. Might come back to visit and to try the bubble tea or some other brewed tea."}
{"text":"Pretty standard. Just got a mango smoothie for $5 which was good. Made with yogurt and milk. 

My cousin got the wellness smoothie $5.50 and it was decent, not that sweet but she thought it was good (clean)."}
{"text":"I love the green, love how this cafe stands out, but I didn't like the drink I ordered. I really wanted to like it, but I just couldn't. I have a feeling the guy forgot to sweeten my Taiwanese Milk Tea with Apple Oolong :( .. Either it's supposed to taste like watered down milk or he didn't make it right. I was expecting a rich and aromatic flavour but when I took a sip, I was like what the. I couldn't taste the tea or the apple oolong. So sad."}
{"text":"Happy Hour 3 pm - 7 pm 50% off all blended drinks is a sweet deal. Ended up my Matcha Frappe cost less than $3 with tax. The matcha taste can be more but quite good for the price point.

I do love their different loose tea options that you can have them brew fresh when order for you. There are also loose leaves package for purchase and they have samples for you to smell. I though got a little confused as there is no prices on all those tea packages. 

The interior is cute and I hope you like green. There are also couple of tablets set up both for use by kids or adults.

The Monkey Cafe is a cute little cafe and a great place to chill out while shopping in Fairview Mall."}
