{"text":"I am absolutly stunned by this review of the Greedy Pig. We use this shop everytime we visit Whitby, and find the lady who runs it to be friendly and always well presented. To make the comment I did wonder if the place was named after her is very rude, and is a personnal insult to the lady. Perhaps this just shows the type of person you are.
My wife and I always get a sandwich each. I get a large one, and she gets a small one, and I can tell you that there is a massive difference in the amount of pork in each sandwich. The above reviewer(if we can call him that) only ordered one sandwich, so how can they know if there is a difference in what pork you get? Hmmm, seems strange to me. As I have said, we use this shop every single time we come to Whitby, and I would highly recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"Lovely little shop...
Staff are always friendly and the sandwiches are to die for. 
Would recommend!!"}
{"text":"A delightful little shop with lots of potential tucked away in a tiny back street. As serious carnivores on a day trip my partner and I got stuck in to two large pork rolls. The pork was very nice but the stuffing was obviously the just add water variety and apple sauce was from a jar. Shame indeed. If the woman here made her own she would sell much more I am sure. Although nice enough, and I could not finish the bread, I thought it was a little too pricey. Interesting contrast in the other reviews of this place. I am firmly between the two extremes."}
{"text":"Well, the woman who runs it would win no awards for politeness and presentation. This tantalising sandwich shop hidden away from view on Golden Lion bank serves basic sandwiches and Roast Pork sandwiches for which it is best known. The Roast Pork comes in small for £2.50 and large for £3.00. The only difference is the size of the bun and not the contents. I was offered stuffing which I accepted and asked for crackling. She said she had some but it was soft and not hard. Surely then it would not be crackling ? I asked then for apple sauce and she replied don't do it. I felt like telling her to keep her sandwich but my hunger got the better of me. There was an ample amount of pork in the sandwich but it lacked in seasoning and the stuffing was not the best. Tasty enough but too pricey. £1.50 would have been fairer considering the opposition e.g. Bothams. The proprietress could do with some customer relations practice but all in all it was ok. Certainly better than a McDonotalds or Burger Ring.


 210709 - I have had this report criticised for being rude. I have taken away what I believe some do-gooders may find offensive but I stand by everything else - it is a poor sandwich. I do not make personal attacks on other reviewers in my reviews. I do not have to. I am above that - which indeed is indicative of my upbringing."}
{"text":"Absolute perfection!! Beautiful sandwiches, 1st class service from the owner who is an absolute gem. Pork reared at a local farm and was of the highest quality. Gorgeous breadbuns and will certainly come again and again. Was recommended by some friends and what a recommendation!! Not entirely sure what 'Toby Pippin's' problem is, clearly has far too much time on his hands writing so many reviews. However, personal and rude comments show what kind of upbringing you must have had (bottom class to say the least)."}
