{"text":"This place is awesome!!! Go there on the weekends to get the dim sum - and it's all real stuff too! No more of that fake stuff sold at other places. They still had the all you can eat last time I went - although you may want to call ahead of time just to make sure they still do, because they have taken it way in the past."}
{"text":"Decent dim sum with pretty good variety.  They used to have all you can eat Dim Sum but they got rid of that.  It was a great deal then just OK now.   But definately a place I'd recommend."}
{"text":"Thank you, Uncle Tom, for bringing me to this wonderful Chinese restaurant.  Having moved to Cleveland from the San Francisco Bay Area, Tom's Seafood is the closest to good chinese restaurant food you can get in Cleveland!  I think all 50 of the Chinese people who live in Cleveland go here for Chinese food.  Supposedly the owner, Tom (not my uncle), has this superstition that the more people there are in his restaurant, the more luck and prosperity he'll get... so he makes his dim-sum dangerously cheap (dangerous for HIM, that is) but wonderful for all the people who should go and spend $1.50 per plate!"}
{"text":"Since I am not Chinese, and have only experienced it a few times, I can confidently say that I am not a dim sum connoisseur; however, based upon my experience last Sunday, I can say that Tom makes some pretty tasty dim sum. I went with a friend who speaks Cantonese and already knows the place pretty well, so I didn't even have to worry about looking through the menu or ordering anything. I just sat down and indulged! Basically, they offer a plethora of rice and noodle dumplings stuffed with different items, such as shrimp, beef, chicken, etc.   If you are sick of all the Americanized Chinese food offered in the suburbs, head over to Cleveland's Chinatown and try out Tom's for a more authentic experience. I will warn there are a few items they serve that average Americans may find \"exotic\" or \"weird.\" Like the chicken feet. Just try it.  I swear, its good."}
{"text":"5 stars in loving memory of Tom's Seafood that is now closed.  Oh how I miss stuffing my hungover face on Sunday afternoons. AYCE dim sum bye bye.  I hope I did not put them out of business with my can you eat all approach.  On the positive side I have probably lost 10 pounds since this place closed and will have to add a couple of holes to my belts."}
{"text":"Decent dim sum. All you can eat for $8.99.  Tom's has most, if not ALL the staples- steamed/fried dumplings, braised misc. and chicken feet, noodles, sticky rice, chinese broccoli, congee...and and desserts (banh bo, egg custard and mango jello, just to name a couple)! I went to Li Wah's for dim sum last Sunday, and I'd say the quality in dim sum is comparatively lower at Tom's, but not significantly. I would say for the price, you definitely get more than what you pay for. The restaurant at the time was consistently busy enough so the carts were flying out of the kitchen. I went Sunday for brunch.. yes, again."}
