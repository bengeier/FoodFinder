{"text":"Our new favorite breakfast/lunch place to go. Had breakfast and lunch there.  The Reuben sandwich was delicious.  Service and price was great."}
{"text":"Very friendly. An older facility but kept clean. Heads up:  they do not serve breakfast after 11 during the week."}
{"text":"Very fast very good! Basic meat and two veggies place but my meal was out in 3 minutes and it was great!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast in the area. Good food. Good service. Very clean. Reasonable prices.  Can't beat that combination. Will be my breakfast goto place."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great atmosphere!! VERY clean!!  Scramblers and skillets are amazing for breakfast/brunch, philly cheese steak, homecooking and flame grilled burgers for lunch! AMAZING!!  Everything I've had is great-you won't be disappointed! MUST try!!"}
{"text":"I usually eat here during my lunch break. The beef tips are out of this world!!! The portions are perfect, I am always filled up(and I eat a lot). Great country style family cooking. They serve all the classics(fried squash, country fried steak, meat loaf, pork chops, ect.) as well as subs, wraps, and salads. It's an awesome selection and they'll make the food exactly the way you ask them to! Five stars!!!"}
{"text":"Love the food and the atmosphere. I eat here a few days out the week.  The staff are exciting and entertaining and always make you feel like a valued customer. Im a huge fan of the breakfast meals. They are portioned just right for hard working men and women who may need the extra love. You also have to try the Big Burger with bacon if you a fan of big juicy burgers. The menu offers an impressive list of foods to fit your needs and mood. Very spacious eating area and can accommodate your entire family. If you are in the city... better yet the state of North Carolina, you should come here to dine. Tell them Jon sent you!"}
{"text":"Sit where ever is open. Good meal for the price. I got the big cheeseburger with onion rings. Burger was nice and juicy with that char taste. I would have liked a little more onion rings. They stop serving breakfast at 1100. It was crowded, thats how you know this place is good. Almost all of the patrons were working class males (jeans, boots, high visible jackets, etc).   Working man's diner, not really a place to take the family. Give it a try though."}
{"text":"New to town and thought about giving this restaurant a go.  Great experience, friendly staff and most important delicious food!"}
{"text":"This is always one of the place u go for lunch when I am nearby. The service are great, food are awesome just like mom's, and the best part is the value for money. The desert is a must try. So far never get disappointed."}
{"text":"The breakfast was very good and the portions were very large. The prices are even better. The reason why this place got only three stars was because I wasn't a huge fan of their service. We waited a while before we received menus and the place wasn't even busy yet. Decor was nothing special there's counter seating, booths and tables. Crowd was mostly older people and truck drivers."}
{"text":"Good quality southern food at a great price! Stopped here because of the reviews and have to say the food is great. Environment is nothing to write home about but the wait staff was very friendly and accommodating. Check it out if you are in the area."}
{"text":"First of all I have eaten at stockyard a very long time. When nick reopen after the fire. Things were good the wait staff was ok. But now the food is good. The prices I get the same food for just a little bit less but that's not my problem. The problem comes in with the waitstaff. If I not know any better I would think that he would have went to a strip bar and got the strippers to come work there. Their attitude is awful. And to be honest with you I really wouldn't want some of them bring nothing to the table. He could do a little bit better"}
{"text":"The food was great and our waitress was funny and accommodating. New to Charlotte and was trying to find nice breakfast spots. I did."}
{"text":"The good: I received a good portion for the price that I paid around seven dollars for breakfast . It's a clean restaurant with the simple decor. I will visit there again at some point  The other: I suppose it's not much to complain about . I ordered the corn beef hash breakfast and asked that the corn beef hash be cooked a little crunchy. It was delivered as a patty and had little to no crunchy parts. I only bring that up because the way that I cook it I kind of sear the meat a bit to wear it is a little crunchy or more specifically has little crunchy pieces in it which appears to cook was unable to duplicate or replicate.    The other thing is that they don't open up on Saturdays I asked the waitress why that is . She said because the owner wanted to spend more time with his family . I think he can leave someone else in charge to open up on Saturdays that would be a chill breakfast spot."}
{"text":"I have stopped here for 10 years off and on.i am a trucker and this place is close to a tank wash i go too. They have fried bologna  yum.I tried the livermush once. I know it is a local favorite  but not for me. I love the home cooking and friendly  service. Their is a big lot for tractor  trailer  parking. Alot of times they are closed when i am in town but  today  I am  definitely  going to  stop  in. 5 stars."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of this place and I visit stockyard 3-4 times a month and I've yet to have a bad experience with the food here.  The service and staff are great people and they make you feel like your in grand ma's kitchen on a Sunday morning.   Everyone speaks when you walk in and say goodbye when you leave and with the variety of meals on the menu and super low prices we so reason to visit anywhere else.   Places like IHOP and Bob Evans need to take a page out of Stockyards book.   When you want good old fashioned service and a hot country breakfast this is a sure hit."}
{"text":"This place is outstanding and worth finding!  \"Kendra\" was a great waitress and full of personality and beauty.  Will return when I am back in Charlotte. Had breakfast special"}
{"text":"Went to the stockyard for the first time based on yelpers reviews andddd drumrolll please. They weren't lying . Fantastic waitresses . fantastic breakfast . had a scramble. Was nice n filling. Tasted the grits of my co diner and was just the way i like creamy goodness. Also tasted the kid Mickey mouse pancake. Excellent. We left after my 2 yr old finished hugging the pretty blonde waitress. Who was fantastic with him .made him a juice cup too. Wow."}
{"text":"The Stockyard is CLOSED on Saturday and Sunday!  Only open Monday thru Friday 6:00 a.m. - 3:00 p.m.  Bummer, we enjoyed eating Breakfast there on Saturday mornings."}
{"text":"Gotta up my review to 4 stars  I've returned several times from my last review (guess I'm nearby more often than I thought).  Each time the service is spot on,  prices are reasonable, and the place is always hopping.  Oh, yeah, I like their food,  too.  Strictly blue plate, meat-n-two sides southern comfort food."}
{"text":"Staff are so attentive and friendly. Coffee refills kept coming steadily. The skillets were delicious. I had the Stockyard Skillet and it was the best breakfast that I've had in a long time. I'm so full that I couldn't even eat my biscuits. Definitely will come back when I'm in this area."}
{"text":"Took care of some business just down the road and was needing breakfast. Most places named this are usually pretty good. Stopped in and ordered a mans breakfast of 4 eggs, bacon, sausage, home fries, grits, toast and coffee. Huge servings of potatoes and grits. Staff friendly. Service fast. Food GREAT. Building VERY clean."}
{"text":"I'm not a breakfast foodie however this restaurant is by far amazing!  Everything was done perfectly to my taste. I tasted everything on everyone's plates. Had to!"}
{"text":"Ok I figured this would be ordinary diner food at best but I was wrong!  This was fantastic diner food.  I had the Breakfast Special for $4.99 which came with two eggs, crispy bacon, home fries and a biscuit.  I got lots and lots of perfectly crispy bacon!!!!  The home fries were excellent and crisp.  The biscuit was large and soft....great great great.  I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Don't let the location fool you, this is a great spot that has an extensive menu. Their brisket was awesome. Did not like their mashed potato and gravy though. Service was excellent as well."}
{"text":"Amazing. Everything is great. You have to try it. I've had a chicken wrap, fish, salads and much more. Everything is tasty."}
{"text":"The Stockyard is an 'institution '. This is a 'working man's restaurant ', however, one will see a combination of blue collar utility lineman, mechanics, etc. with lawyers and doctors also there. The staff is perfect, just 'home folk', and they will go out of there way to make the customer happy. The food is good ole southern food, and the kitchen staff is comprised of some experienced southern cooks. The quality of food is very good, and the portions are very generous. My only complaint, if it is a complaint, is that the portions are very large. I know, I do not have to eat everything, but it is so good, I do not want to leave anything on the plate.  The next time you are there, try the 'chicken and dumplings' or the 'fried flounder'. Also, their Mac and Cheese plus the banana pudding is to die for. If you have to return to work in the afternoon, be sure to have a quiet spot available, as you may need to take a nap."}
{"text":"Today my co-workers dragged me to another place that they claimed had \"amazing food\". I would have to disagree.   I ordered the backed chicken special with collards and mac & cheese. Backed chicken didn't seem \"baked\". It was very fatty and the skin was chewy. I actually had to pull at it like a rubber band. Collards were good 4/5. Mac and cheese was not good. It was cold and most of the cheese that was put into it hadn't even melted yet.   My co-workers both got the hamburger steak with 2 sides each and they said it was very good. This must be a southern thing - I never saw hamburger steak on a Menu until I moved to Charlotte. Anyways, the service was pretty good as they checked in with us often and brought us 2-3 refills.  Prices were very cheap - if your looking for an inexpensive \"home cooked\" type meal.  Personally, if it's left up to me, I will probably never come here again. But you never know since my coworkers love to go to places like this for a \"plate lunch\"."}
{"text":"Good Diner type food! Very friendly staff! Quick service and a lot of variety on the menu! The only thing I dislike are their hours. They close at 3pm. I wish they stayed open later, even if just on the weekends"}
{"text":"Nice blue collar type of place. At lunch they have many choices for a meat & 2. I chose the baked BBQ chicken white meat. My sides were potato salad & fried okra. I had a choice of roll or cornbread. I had the cornbread served with butter. It was sweet & moist. The chicken BBQ sauce was a kraft style sauce. Breast & wing well cooked & moist. Used all my napkins. The potato salad was tasty like grandma's. Iced tea was sweetened just right. I ate at the counter. My server was a real sweetheart & checked on me & kept my tea glass full. Great service. They had a nice looking menu for sandwiches & salads I'll try next. I'm gonna check out the breakfast to. You can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"So I'm from Philadelphia and a place (exterior) like this in Philadelphia would be sketchy. However, it's the south so I tried not to judge the location or exterior. Stockyard is like a home-y diner. Very affordable home cooked food! The home fries were surprisingly delicious, they were crisp and has just enough oil. Servers and just about everyone was nice. Menu has so many options from breakfast to steak. Definitely would recommend for a quick affordable breakfast since it's opened so early. However, if you're a fancy person I would not recommend this place, it's truly is a local gem."}
{"text":"This place is amazing from the service to the food just a reall great hole in the wall."}
{"text":"Back again. Came in for lunch today. I usually get the hamburger steak, but decided to try something different today. I had the ribs with mashed potatoes and okra/ tomato. My coworker had the grilled salmon patties. I really like this place a lot. The food is good and homestyle and the staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"Great breakfast - eggs, scrambles, whatever....all is good-  and multiple types of potatoes...nice touch.  Service is wonderful and lots of seats....so unlikely to have to wait"}
{"text":"Wow! Excellent service, Amber did a great job on service and getting my family's needs taken cared of. The food is excellent and the atmosphere is nice and pleasant. The value of the food compared to the price is good. No complaints from this family. We will become regulars here when we visit our kids."}
{"text":"When you walk into Stockyard, you'll swear you've seen this diner in some movie or tv show. The experienced staff, the brown coffee cups, the pricing, and the portions .... most authentic diner experience in Charlotte for those sick and tired of the retro wannabes. They never let my coffee cup go empty. Hash browns and runny grits for breakfast are a must."}
{"text":"The wait staff is always courteous and prompt. The prices on the menu are acceptable to the food you receive. The quality of food is excellent and cook very well. I have eaten here several times and have never had a bad meal or dining experience. Wish they were open past 3pm. One of the best breakfast you can get in the area as well."}
