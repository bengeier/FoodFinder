{"text":"The worst fish and chips I've ever had. The chips were cold, and are not freshly cut. 
The price of $14 for Halibut and Chips is higher then most fish and chip shops charge and no where near the quality. If you want to eat fish and chips in Port Credit I'd suggest buying at a local joint and taking them to the park near the lake.
I'd give these fish and chips an Animal House rating of \"Zero Point Zero\""}
{"text":"Its sad to say I am a long time loyal fan of this place due to the pefect customer service and welcome homestyle feeling place. My regular was steak with 2 portions of bacon with hash browns(deepfried) toast orange juice and tea.

I went last week and seen a up 4 lease sign and almost cried to see such a good place go down."}
{"text":"Helen's has been in Port Credit for as long as I can remember.

Decor isn't good. It's not supposed to be good. This isn't a high end place. This is a tiny family diner type place.

The food is alright. Decent comfort foods. Always liked the fries and gravy here. They have very generous portions. The burger is good too, I mean, as good as can be expected from this type of place. Don't expect to be surprised, but don't expect to be disappointed either.

Helen's features simple counter service. Then you go sit down and eat your food.

If you're in the port credit area and want a cheap diner type meal, give Helen's a try."}
{"text":"I had the Halibut dinner with chips and coleslaw. $11 is on the high end of what i'm willing to pay for fish and chips, and it especially seems outrageous considering that it was obviously just brought in frozen. Greasy, doughy, and bland, if I wanted captain highliner, I would eat it in the comfort of my own home and not this dim dive. 

Don't waste your time or money. 
I suggest the nearby 'Country Fish and Chips'."}
{"text":"This was a great place for good food at a low price before the current owners took over.  Bland food, doughy fish batter, breakfast is mediocre.  Dont bother going."}
{"text":"Helen's is not the greatest thing ever, but it has charm on its side. Located right on the scenic banks of the Credit, I often come here for breakfasts with my girlfriend's family. The house breakfast with three eggs, hash browns, plentiful toast, choice of meat (sausage, peameal, bacon or ham), coffee and OJ is pretty much guaranteed to fill you up right, but it's fairly average in preparation (except the hash browns, which I really like.) I've certainly had much better (and heartier, and more option-able) all-in-one or lumberjack breakfasts. The fried egg sandwich is decent, but the omlelettes are unremarkable and dry.

As for the fish and chips featured on the marquee: they're honestly not all that good. The chips themselves are nice (and you get a lot of them) but the word \"doughy\" which others have used to describe the fish and the overly greasy/soft batter is pretty accurate.

I haven't been around long enough to know firsthand, but I have heard the story about the change in ownership being a drag for this place. I don't mind coming here because it's a decent place to get a big plate of breakfast and shoot the breeze, but it's not really impressive in the long run."}
{"text":"since the new owners took over it hasn't been the same.  I stopped going after the change.  Used to be one of my favourite greasy spoons.  Now i go to country fish and chips."}
{"text":"Here is probably the best way to describe Helen's Fish & Chips

Service: 1/5 - Over charged  $15.50 and did not explain to the patrons.. until I went         back up to get a refund. The response from the cashier/cook (kinda of not cool, considering he's handling food and cash at the same time, and did not wash his hands after) was that he \"thought it was weird that bill came up to $51.30, but choose to ignore it, until I sat down to calculate... 

Quality of Food: 4/5 - Batter on the fish was great, the fries were great.  Coleslaw was ok... Caesar Salad very tasty (But who can really mess-up Caesar Salads)

Temperature of Food: 4/5 - Not very quick, so be prepared for a wait. Good thing is that its cooked fresh when you order.

Value of Meals: 3/5 - Prices are a bit pricey, many other places are better on their prices. It won't break the bank, but for a two person meal, it comes out to 30 bucks.  Its not even the best fish on the menu.

Atmosphere: It seems like this restaurant is going through some reno, so its starting to look a bit better.

Would I Return: No

Time of Meal: Dinner"}
{"text":"Located in Right in the middle of Port Credit, across from the port credit light tower and right beside The Starbucks here. Iv been coming here for a while now, and I usually always get the same thing here

Haddock, chips, and coleslaw. 


It costs about $12 and the fish is very fresh, it's not a five star restaurant but the fish they sell is good, so are the chips. It's basically like a diner but \"fish n' chips\" style and everything else a diner has to offer as well. They make the food in front of you so you can see how they cook it while you wait for your order. Iv ordered cheeseburgers and poutine here as well and it's tasty too. The staff here is pretty nice too, its a family run Joint. It's a not a \"wow\" type of place but it'll do."}
