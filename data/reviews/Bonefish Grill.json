{"text":"I SHOULD HAVE LISTENED TO EVERYONE!   My wife and I went to Bonefish Grill Saturday night.  It was busy but not packed.  Had a reservation anyway.  Here is the positive - seated quickly, Rochelle (Awesome server!) took drink & dinner order and returned quickly with drinks.  Appetizer - Coconut Shrimp - came quickly and was delicious!  Now the night goes to hell!  We, and several other patrons, waited almost an hour for our entrees!  In fact ours was delivered to the wrong table and when this was discovered, picked up and brought to us. Not good!  If not for the fact we had waited so long I would have sent it back. Pasta was overcooked and came in one big clump.  Veggies were OK but very oily.  Fish was good.  MOD came to apologize and really had no excuse for the slow kitchen.  Offered a \"free\" desert for our inconvience ($5 homemade donuts).  I know they we $5 because they charged us for them!  In fairness they did take them off when I brought this to their attention.  Pretty unlikely we will ever go back.  Kind of spendy and there are lots of choices in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere, great service and the food is amazing.  We enjoyed the bang bang shrimp, and the Day Boat Scallops.  The veggies were prepared perfectly.  The bread is always fresh and warm.  The manager stopped by to make sure we enjoyed our time with them and to present my friend with a box of chocolates for her birthday.  This place is top notch!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had my birthday  dinner here 10/10/16 and I must say the staff here were amazing. I enjoyed my dinner and also received a very nice card signed by the Bonefish crew. I'm sure it's what they do all the time but it just put that extra special touch to a wonderful evening. They even spelled my name right :-).  Thank you Bonefish for making my dinner special."}
{"text":"Cluster-Bleep.  Ordered grilled salmon no butter or salt and broccoli steamed plain w/o butter or salt.  Picked up my to go order.  Couldn't have been more butter on the vegetables, was gross.  Spilled onto salmon. Called and they said they would re do the order in 15 mins.  Showed up in 15, waited another 15 mins (30 total).  Said they would give me a gift card bc it was easier to refund it.  Asked me to give him a minute to retrieve.  Took 10 mins.  My food was cold by the time I got back to hotel.  Will never eat here again."}
{"text":"This is a very sought after place. Best to make a reservation. Wonderful food with an exceptional staff!! And the food is delicious!! Highly recommended!! Worth every penny!"}
{"text":"Monday night. Not busy. I have never seen so many people on staff work so hard to ignore you. They all seemed very stressed.  Had appetizers and was not going to stick it out through dinner. Left the place  and went elsewhere for entrees. This was not my first time here but had similar experience with the service the last time. Gave it another try. Will not be going back!"}
{"text":"pros: love the bang bang shirmp! I love the mango salsa sauce on grilled fish.  service was good. cons: the quantity is small."}
{"text":"Nice to have another good restaurant at Town Square.  Bonefish is very well appointed. Inside is beautiful. Patio looks great.  Will be a nice outdoor location when the weather is warm. We went for drinks, appetizers and dinner.  The drinks were okay.  Some of our martinis were only 2/3 full.  The appetizers were fabulous, crab cakes, shrimp and ahi tuna...no complaints at all.  Dinner was sea bass and those awesome potatoes au gratin.  Not a big fish fan so it would be unfair to judge but my husband loved the seabass. The staff was spot on with the service. Lots of staff around and very pleasant.  i would return."}
{"text":"Food was just OK, service is spotty and prices aren't that great."}
{"text":"I cant decide what I like more about this restaurant...the awesome martinis( Blueberry or the Pomegranate are my faves) or the Bang Bang Shrimp? The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because they used to have pinenuts on the house salad and now they have sunflower seeds.  Bring back the pine nuts!"}
{"text":"We went for brunch and it was perfect. The bottomless bellinis/mimosas with eggs benedict was less than $20. The food was well prepared and presented while the service was exemplary. The Crème Brulee was a little pricey at over $7, but after 4 bellinis I barely noticed. I don't understand some of the previous comments posted here, we were impressed with all aspects of our meal. If you go clutching a coupon or a Groupon deal (sipping your ice water) you might be as disappointed as our neighboring table was, as there are some sensible restrictions on discount programs. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great food and service! Wonderful happy hour. My wife and I enjoy the atmosphere and surroundings. Its a place we like to just to feel comfortable and relaxed."}
{"text":"First time was 6 months ago had bad experience, manager was very sorry for it and invited us back..came back much better experience, bartender Austin was awesome,knew menu, very nice and very attentive to our needs!! Michael manager great as well.will be back again!!! Thanks guys"}
{"text":"Pros: Attentive management and servers Delicious drinks from the bar Bang bang shrimp appetizer was delicious!  Cons: Very cramped space  We felt very rushed, even though the place was half empty  My husband ordered the shrimp & scallops with a side of green beans. The entire meal had no flavor, even with the mango sauce. He left half unfinished.  I ordered sea bass with sautéed spinach and the au gratin potatoes. My fish was cooked well and the lime garlic sauce was delicious, but my spinach was literally swimming in liquid and tasted like nothing. No garlic, salt, nothing. I am certain the potatoes were ice cream scooped out of a vat. I also left half my meal.  2 drinks, one appetizer and 2 below average dinners-over $100. Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time today, around 12:30pm.   We we're seated quickly and we we're in time to make selections from both their brunch and dinner menus.  We ordered their corn clam soup, alasken cod +chips, kobi beef burger, the crème bruleé French toast and the scallops with shrimp entree.   Before our meal arrived we had freshly baked bread delivered to our table with an olive oil and  herb dip which was delicious.   Our entrees came quickly and they we're cooked well."}
{"text":"I've been to Bonefish six times because my boyfriend likes it. I think it's just okay. I'm not impressed with the service or the food. Yesterday I ordered an appetizer before dinner and while I was still eating the server came over to take our dinner order. I thought it would have been good manners had she waited until we were done with the appetizer instead of coming over when we have food on our forks and are actively trying to enjoy our appetizer. I felt like we were being rushed.  I ordered cocktails so i was dying for water but unfortunately I wasn't given water..  Ive tried the bacon wrapped scallops, mahi mahi, Chilean sea bass, firecracker tacos, lobster bisque, chowder, key lime pie. Nothing stood out as really good and I've ordered a different item each time to try to find something I liked but it's all just okay."}
{"text":"We were so excited to have a Bonefish come to the neighborhood and this one does not disappoint. We have been several times and the food has all been good. The Bang Bang Shrimp are crispy and flavorful and I had a wonderful piece of swordfish done Oscar style. The fish was cooked perfectly. The potstickers met with mixed reviews, but the rib eye was well cooked and flavorful. Their creme brulee is okay flavor wise, but the texture could be firmer.  The service was also very good - prompt and friendly even though the restaurant was packed."}
{"text":"Run, walk, drag your broken leg to the Bonefish Grill on Rockside in Independence Ohio and get their Tilapia Imperial! It is awesome. I hate tilapia with a passion because it has NO flavor and it tastes like paper but that chef turned it into something wonderful! It was stuffed with the food they must serve at the White House! If your doctor ever tells you that you will die soon make sure to have this dish as your last meal! It is stuffed with something that might be crab meat but for sure scallops and I HATE scallops. How did they do it? They took all I hate and created something I love. :)"}
{"text":"First time visit and it was great. I had the Chilean Sea Bass which was better than perfect. Wife had fish and chips which were again perfect. Tried the bang shrimp appetizer which was good but a bit heavy but a very generous portion. Service was very good for as busy as it was."}
{"text":"My wife and I ordered the special fillet and cold water tail. Wife got the deluxe side Mac and truffle cheese IT WAS TERRIBLE this should not be a deluxe side. The fillet was cooked medium and was cooked correctly and was a good piece of steak however it was very very bland no taste and it was ashame because is was a good piece of steak. The tail was ok and the deluxe sweet potato was day from deluxe. This will definitely not be the first place we think of to go. Also service was ok aswell. Which is what I would call or whole experience"}
{"text":"Where to begin....so I was in the mood for a Lobster Roll. I am actually from New England so it's rather important that this meal not suck. Unfortunately, it sucked. I don't know what was more insulting; the hotdog bun or the $18 + I paid. How dare you serve it on a soggy hot dog bun. Rude. The lobster part...flavorless and disappointing. The fries, salt-less, not as disappointing, however I probably had like a total of 11 fries. COME ON! 11 freaking fries.  The coleslaw was ok, it needed more or less of something but I can't quite put my finger on it. It was served with some bread and pesto(?) it was so warm and good.  All in all the decor was beautiful but I didn't go there to eat fancy chairs and flat screen tv's....  Service was good."}
{"text":"Went for lunch, yummy!  The chowder was amazing,  the bread and pesto was a great starter.  When our lunch came,  the fish tacos were super good,  just enough spice for my liking and the Bang Bang tacos were so good both were great choices.  We splurged and had the brownie, a great ending.  Service was great.  The manager was an active player, he worked just as hard as the servers.   Amanda was our server, she was excellent.   All in all a great dining experience."}
{"text":"Got there at around 6:45 tonight (Wednesday) and the parking was packed. It is in the Concord Mall parking lot so there's not a bunch of parking; mostly next to Outback. The hostess told us that the wait would be an hour. I guess it wasn't our night because we didn't end up getting seated till 8:15. I guess many people made reservations; I will definitely be doing that next time. It was crowded tonight because it was the day after Valentine's Day snd it was $5 Bang bang shrimp. The server said they were understaffed tonight. I had the Tilapia Imperial which was really good with the potatoes au gautin and spinach. My boyfriend had the Caribbean Style Mahi Mahi which was mediocre. There wasn't really any seasoning. Our server was awesome and prompt. We will be going back but definitely no more Caribbean Mahi Mahi."}
{"text":"Our first visit to the Bone Fish Grill and unfortunately we left disappointed. Things started off fine, the restaurant is decorated nicely and the initial service seemed fine. One thing that was annoying right away was the music, it was loud and more of the type of music for a bar or burger place. One of my biggest complaints of restaurants in Las Vegas is how noisy most of then are. Im not sure i liked the paper table cloths either it seemed out of place. We ordered an ahi appetizer and it was good, maybe the best part of the meal. We ordered the prawns and scallops and the rib eye. while both dishes were ok but the presentation of the food on the plate just wasn't right. The seafood was covered in butter and the side of broccoli was to salty to eat. The rib eye was cooked perfectly but i thought the cut was somewhat on the cheaper end of the rib eye spectrum. Both dishes came with a side of spaghetti squash but it was not really cooked right and was not that enjoyable. The potatoes gratin was probably the best side we had. The service seem to fade after we had our dinner on the table, how your water glasses are handled is a good sign of how the management treats its customers, ours were rarely filled.  So we will probably not be back to the Bonefish. I will no doubt choose Flemming's next door, the price is higher but the experience is worth it, after all isn't that one of the reasons we go out to eat?"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Very busy but we were seated within 30 minutes on a Saturday. The soft shell crab was fantastic. The sirloin was blackened (we specifically asked for well done but not burned) but otherwise very good."}
{"text":"Bonefish Grill is a well-established commodity, and a welcome addition to Huntersville's Birkdale Village shopping center.  On a Thursday evening the restaurant was packed.  The service was frantic and a little slow, but friendly and competent.  I chose n orange roughy special, and it was a bit overwhelmed by its toppings and flavors.  In hindsight I wished I had chosen some simple grilled fish, which I suspect would have been better.  It is an attractive place and I am sure will be successful.  They are off the main drag in Birkdale, and the parking lot across the street will make it more accessible than the competition."}
{"text":"I have to agree with everyone, the Bang Bang Shrimp is killer. However, skip the corn chowder - it has zero taste (I actually had to add salt to give it some flavor). Also, when I made my reservations online, and filled out the area of special occasion (i.e., specifically  stating it was my birthday), nothing special was offered nor said. Why bother to ask? I would go back for their \"Happy Hour\" (which is only on Weds) - otherwise, never again."}
{"text":"Great food..served hot and fresh. Bread with pesto dipping oil was so delicious.Jason Z. Was our waiter and he was exceptional  very customer focused !!! Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Food - 4 star Service - -3  We stopped in for a few appetizers in the late afternoon.  Maybe 2 tables, 3 people sitting at the bar...not busy.  Oh, but the entire staff (about 6 or 7) was at the end of the bar talking the ENTIRE time we were there.   We sat at the bar because we were on a bit of a time crunch.    Acknowledgment......acknowledgement....ackNOledgment....a c k  n  o   w   l    e    dgmennnnnnnnnnnnnntttttttttt...And we've got it!  Bummer...just wiped down the bar in front of us.  Didn't ask if we wanted anything to drink, menu, nothin'.  About five minutes go by, I raise my hand like a little school girl.  \"Could we get some water please\".  Another five minutes go by...I REALLY don't want to interrupt the popular kids from their recess chat but for the love of god puck drops in 55 min!  I raise my hand like a little school girl again.  \"Could we order some apps?\".  Another 5 minutes goes by.  Now I'm frustrated because the popular kids at recess are still ignoring me!  I raise my hand again.  \"Could we order some beers?\".  Word to the wise servers at Bonefish, NEVER judge a book by it's cover.  Just because we weren't dressed up doesn't mean we aren't good tippers or even the sausage kings of Chicago.  Plus, you do know you are working at a chain restaurant....no need to be snooty or snotty.    Food came out fairly quickly.  It was quite good.  I would recommend the Bang Bang shrimp with a side of the sweet chili sauce that comes with the mac & cheese bites.  The mac & cheese bites were kind of blah until you added the chili sauce. There were quite a few things on the menu that I'd like to try.  Their bowl looked good as did their chicken, of all things.  I'm not much of a fish eater but some of the meals look pleasing.  Wasn't until we were almost done when the bartender (one of 2, by the way) came by and asked how everything was.  I was quite excited that I didn't have to raise my hand again to ask for more water.  Oh wait, my husband did...He filled my glass but not the one sitting 6\" away.  Final hand raise - the check.  Not once did he ask if we wanted another beer.  Way to upsell buddy!  The final straw to this poor, poor service was what was overheard said by one of the bartenders.  This is not a direct quote, but you get the gist:  \"We need more experienced bartenders here.  But where are we going to get them?  Chili's?  Outback?  Olive Garden?  Those are just pretend bartenders.  They don't know what they are doing.\"  As my friend Johnny said:  Dude, when I think \"mixologist\" I'm definitely not thinking of a bartender at Bonefish.  And given the HORRENDOUS service we received, and the fact that I actually know some of the bartenders at those locations, it might be beneficial to Bonefish to actually hire those bartenders because they have more experience in their little finger than the current bartenders and could bring people in because they know people in the hood.  Plus they are friendly, attentive, non-judgmental and actually know how to make a drink.  Gosh, I even hired one of them to bartend for me.  Best hire in a while.   We MIGHT be back in a few months.  Maybe then they might have their stuff together."}
{"text":"This was my first time here.  We were seated ahead of our 8:15 reservation which was nice.  Ordered the ceviche as an appetizer and it was really good.  The bread was amazing! Had the mahi special which was delicious.  The service started off really well and slowly started to decline due to the large party that our server had to attend to. Other than that i would definitely come back when i'm in the mood for seafood."}
{"text":"1 word : Disgusting Not fresh or flavorful . The complimentary bread was the only thing worth eating .  Never again. Would not recommend .  4 stars for this place is very deceiving. If you want to go to a restaurant where everything tastes the same, this is your spot. If you are a foodie this place is not for you."}
{"text":"My husband and I heard so much about Bonefish Grill that we decided to finally give it a try on a recent date night.  We made a reservation for 6:15 PM on a Saturday evening.  The restaurant was packed, but when we arrived at 6:10 PM were promptly taken to our table.  Our server was great.  The pomegranate martini was awesome.  The Bang Bang Shrimp was a major disappointment.  With all the hype surrounding this signature dish, I was expecting something amazing, but it was nothing exceptional whatsoever.  I've had a much better version of this at another chain restaurant.  I ordered the Talapia Imperial with garlic whipped potatoes and french green beans.  The entree was too salty, the green beans were terrible, and the potatoes were just okay.  In my opinion, it's not worth the price and is over-hyped."}
{"text":"We had made reservations figuring it could be a lengthy weight for a Friday night. When we arrived about 15 minutes early, our table was already ready. Our server was great, very attentive and happily replaced my mom's mojito for a cocktail she did like. Georgia peach martini is excellent. The shrimp and scallops were delicious as was my Jasmine rice and tomato salad. Don't forget to try the Creme Brûlée too!"}
{"text":"The five stars are for the manager who let us in at 10:00 pm Sunday night as they were closing. We just arrived from the airport and were desperate to eat.  Our server was fabulous too. It never concerned her that she had to serve new customers when she was probably getting ready to go home!  The food was good too. I had the fish and chips, and although I was surprised it was Tilapia, it was quite tasty."}
{"text":"Was excited to see a fish restaurant going in at Summerlin. However, was very dissapointed in this place. Went during the opening week. Arrived about 3:30PM looking for a late lunch. We were told that lunch stopped at 3:00PM and we would have to order from the dinner menu. Same food, different price. We were the only ones there, so it wasn't busy. In fact there were so many servers, moving around it was like a show. For a fishplace, it did not have Oysters, which is what I was looking for. Ordered the Fish and Chips, small portion and very greasy, if fact had an upset stomack later. The wedge salad was nice with lots of blue cheese. That I would order again. I doubt they will do well here. It is too pricey for what you get and I don't find the menu very much to my liking."}
{"text":"My husband and I came to this one very often, mainly for their grilled rib eye and burger. Sometimes I will order their regular grilled trout too. So we mostly get these three, very stable, and that's how I can say that their quality has been very consistent.  We always order our food well done. And they are able to wood fire grill our food (including steak, fish and burger) to well done without burning them. There is char, but not burnt. That's a very very admirable thing and please keep up the good work.   There was only one time so far that they made a mistake on our burgers, it was underdone (we wanted them well done). They humbly acknowledged the mistakes and fixed it for us. The manager would even come out to apologize and gave us a coupon for the bang bang shrimp as a gesture of apology. It was very professional and good work ethics. We didn't end up using the coupon because we are allergic to shrimp. But we admire and appreciate the gesture, so we keep going back after that mistake. Mistakes don't happen often anyway too, that was the only one mistake we experienced out of numerous visits.   I don't know if they age their steak, but I don't really care for those long aging taste anyway, and I don't feel that their steak is aged, I like the texture of the rib eye they offer, soft and tender, good quality.  The staff are all courteous and friendly. There was one particular young waiter that we really like. I think his name is Cameron according to the receipts. He is easy to make conversation with, and he gives good service and also very energetic and has good work ethics.   Please keep up the good work. I really like this restaurant. I like this one so much that I didn't even care about visiting the other location on Charleston as I want to keep having this good image of Bonefish by only coming to this one in town."}
{"text":"Great food. High quality ingredients. Friendly. We've become very picky about food and were really imposed with the meal."}
{"text":"Went for our early Valentine Day's Dinner.  Bang Bang Shrimp is always fantastic.  My wife ordered the Caribbean Mahi Mahi Daily Special and was less than impressed with the overall taste.  It was bland and not very flavorful.  I ordered the Steak and Lobster Thermidor Daily Special.  The flavor was delicious but for price ($31) the portion of lobster was disappointing.  Our service was also disappointing.   We never received the soup she ordered or the salad I ordered."}
{"text":"I'll admit it up front - I'm not a big seafood fan.  But it was Mom's birthday yesterday and this is where she wanted to go.  Place is easy to find at the corner of Carmel and Pineville Matthews Road.  Decor is very pleasant - nothing that stands out as either exceptionally nice or exceptionally horrid.  Food was consistently edible.  Server asks if you want anchovy on the caesar salad which is a nice touch (dad said yes, I declined).  Salad was served a touch too cold for me.  The fish and chips was an acceptable option for us landlubbers.  Enough tempura batter and tartar sauce and I forgot I was eating fish!  Dad's dish seemed to be the best - the diablo shrimp over spinach fettucine.  I would have liked to tried a grilled fresh fish dish (the house specialty) - but they were priced in the $20 per entree range.  Seemed like a lot to pay if you aren't already a stark raving mad seafood devotee.  Which brings us to value.  I thought it was a okay for what we had - $81 before tip for dinner for three including two salads, three glasses of wine and one gin martini.  (BTW, the server seemed surprised that martinis are ordered with anything other than vodka.  Isn't gin the classic martini?)    No dessert - homemade chocolate on chocolate birthday cake was waiting at home!"}
{"text":"Having eaten at their other locations we were looking forward to having a Bonefish Grille closer to our home. We both ordered the grilled scallops and shrimp. The scallops were as good as possible. I want to go back and eat more scallops. The accompanying vegetables were also quite good. Getting the scallops and vegetables so right is worth five stars."}
{"text":"Delicious!!!!! Ordered food to go and it was perfect! Must try the flourless, gluten free chocolate brownie!!! Mmmmmmm"}
{"text":"Initial service was slow but everything after was great! Bang bang shrimp were delicious! Come hungry! You won't leave that way!"}
{"text":"Bonefish grill is a perfect place to go for a drink and some really good food.  The booths are comfy and the lighting is dampened but not too dark.  They offer a good variety of wines and mixed drinks as well as beers.  The salads are fresh and have a great citrusy dressing.  The calamari and shrimp appetizers are really big and so good!  The grilled fish is fresh and comes with your choice of sauces (I stick with the traditional lemon butter).  And even though the restaurant caters to seafood lovers, it offers a good variety of non-fishy options including steaks, chicken, and pasta.  Everything I've tried has been excellent.  The best part: the creme brulee and key lime pie.  Really, same some room because both desserts are incredible!"}
{"text":"Start off with the bang bang shrimp or the crab cakes and see what you think.  I usually proceed to the imperial longfin and leave very satisfied.  For a commercial chain, all of the meals have been very consistent over numerous visits.    I enjoy their food and will continue to be a patron!"}
{"text":"This was one of the most enjoyable meals I've had in a very long time!!! Amazing service, fantastic food and a great atmosphere!! AAA+ ."}
{"text":"What a awful experience!  The service is subpar to say the least. After the salad course the plates were still in front of us as the entrée was being served. We had to clear our own dishes to make room for the incoming plates. The cutlery that was taken away was not replaced so I had no silverware to eat my food and the server disappeared.  Water glasses sat empty and the dishes piled up, what a mess!  We still had the appetizer dishes on the table when the dessert order was taken. I should also mention that this took place on a Sunday night so it was slow, can't blame it on being slammed!  The food was cold and ill prepared, kind of reminded me of a bad Red Lobster restaurant.  Save your money or better yet go next door to Flemings where you can get great service and delicious food for the same price."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Summerlin.  They prepare saltwater seafood just the way it should be done.  Crab cakes appetizer is delicious.  The sea bass and day boat scallops are two great choices for a main course.  And key lime pie for dessert, a perfect ending for dinner.  The waitstaff is friendly and attentive to your needs.  You are getting top quality food, perfectly prepared and presented ... It's definitely worth the price!"}
{"text":"The food was fresh, the server was a beginner, but she rocked it, she helped my dad put the food in the bag, she did awesome! My food was delicious and I never thought that bonefish was this good even after it had been like 5 years since I've been there. Amazing, and I will go back."}
{"text":"Food is excellent even if it is a bit pricier. Great service good ambience and a really nice sea food selection."}
{"text":"May be it is cleveland or may be this place is just great. It  relaxing and serves great food."}
{"text":"Highly anticipated coming here for dinner. I love wood fired foods and this new restaurant seemed like a good choice. Maybe it was the timing, but the place was overcrowded with no room to wait even at 8pm on a Tuesday. The hostess said a community table option might be faster. There is no good reason for a community table, it cheapens the atmosphere and in effect makes you feel looked down upon. Service was rude, bare minimum level. Food was not very exciting, tiny steak had to be sent back due to it being very overcooked. Mashed potatoes had way to much garlic in them, and the dessert (coconut pie) was not good at all. I watched two couples leave after their food took almost two hours to arrive. To put the cherry on top of this review, how would you feel if the people who sat next to you were served by your waitress first after you had already put your order in ten minutes before? Do not go here, there are too many clones of this kind of restaurant that do it better."}
{"text":"Always always always get bang bang shrimp !! Every Dish is well prepared and tastes good but bang bang shrimp is amazingly great ! You can't go wrong with it"}
{"text":"We were so excited to try this restaurant. It had been open for a month so we figured the kinks would be worked out. It was my birthday and we had a pretty bad experience. We waited an hour and 20 minutes for our salads to come. After mentioning the long wait time we waited another 10 minutes then asked for the manager. He didn't show up for another 20 minutes and had never been told that we had asked for him. The dinner was not great. the seabass was very small, the ahi tuna was a purple black color on the inside which we hadn't seen before and the sides (mashed potatoes and spaghtetti squash) both tasted runny and soggy. Our salad and appetizer plates never got removed from the table until we were done with the meals and we were never offered refills on drinks. At the end of the meal, the manager offered a complimentary desert and appetizer but we had coupons for those anyways. Needless to say, it was very disappointing. We have been to other Bonefish restaurants and they were so much better."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar, bartenders are top notch and hustling quick (especially Chris!). Great service and food all around!"}
{"text":"I was a party of 4 on Friday evening 6-24.  The food and drinks were delicious but the lack of service and recovery on part of leadership was poor. 1) we ordered the dinner for 2 (both couples) 2) 1 guest ordered dewars on the rocks of which the staff weren't sure if they had it nor what it was  3) Our bread plates were removed before we finished the bread and oil....never offered more 4) the bang bang never arrived until we asked about it as our main entrees were delivered (bang bang arrived mid main entree) 5) a watermelon martini was delivered to our table that we never ordered....the waiter cycle around the bar with drink in hand and redelivered it to the table next to us.  Mind you the drink sat at our table for appx 5 minutes until the waiter could be flagged down 6) decaf coffee was ordered and never delivered 7)  we ordered per the dinner for 2 strawberry cheesecake and instead strawberry shortcake was delivered. This was most disappointing as the waiter read the desert order back to the table....only after the we asked to we a desert menu (a menu was never delivered) 8) the bill was inadequately split (needed correction)  I've been here before and truly enjoyed the experience with my friends.  Madison has many many good restaurants to eat at....we will think thrice before attending this bonefish.  Bonefish compensated the experience by offering free bang bang on he next visit and 1 free entree.  Bonefish could learn from the recovery process of Biaggi's."}
{"text":"The good - Service The bad - Lighting is like Home Depot, bright white lights overhead.  No mood whatsoever. Music was some form of disco Christmas.   Food was what one expects from a low end chain"}
{"text":"The food is always really good!   I also must say that their service is so great! Their servers are knowledgeable and always check on you and are very friendly."}
{"text":"Gave this a 2nd go a few weeks back.  I wish I had something better to report.   We ordered the lobster tail special & bang bang shrimp. Just like my initial review, my meal was okay.  Lobster tail was okay. It could have been better. Not the freshest or tastiest - I've had worse. It was obvious it sat in the pass longer than it should have.  It arrived room temperature, not hot, but not cold either. It was served on the shell; I was able to manipulate it without burning my fingers on the shell. Mash wasn't great...again, room temp.  Bang Bang shrimp was ok. The sauce its tossed in is too creamy for the amount of batter these are fried in.   I've spent a good amount of time trying to figure out what it is about this place that doesn't sit well with me. I think I figured it out.   Atmosphere? Great Service? No complaints.  Food?  For a seafood place, the menu confuses me; it just seems heavy. Too much batter on the fish & chips & bang bang shrimp.  Too many \"fried\" options...and burgers, & I recall a steak?  During my last visit a plate was brought out to a nearby table. The smell alone made me ill. When I realized what it was I vowed not to come back. BROCCOLI by CHEF MIKE!!  You DO NOT MICROWAVE BROCCOLI.  You steam it, sauté it, serve it raw but you never nuke it. Not only does it kill the nutrients but it stinks to high heaven. Seriously makes me wonder what is going on in the kitchen...in a Gordon Ramsay Kitchen Nightmares kind of way.   I know this review may read a bit bipolar, but Bonefish kinda is. I really wanted to like this place...I really did. Subpar food & confusing menu vs. Great atmosphere & nice staff. The broccoli though....killed it for me."}
{"text":"I called at 2pm to request a table of ten for 7pm on a Sat. I was informed by the person answering the phone and the manager they could not take the reservation even though the website says reservations. I showed up at 6:15 to try to get on a list and get a table for my party. I was asked \"did I make a reservation?\" Um, Bonefish would not let me. The hostess then said I have to get the manager to ask how long the wait will be. I didn't ask I just said I needed a table. I don't understand why I couldn't simply be put in a list. They then directed me to the first come first serve table which I was told about on the phone but when I asked the manager if I could reserve this table for 7pm I was told no. I got this table waited 45 minutes for the rest of the my party which only hurt my server because the table would not be turned over so she could make more tips. This Bonefish location is not friendly to large tables. Well only at their convenience, not the customer. This is my first bonefish experience and the customer service to accommodate my party was frustrating. I will tell everyone I know and I will not be back"}
{"text":"My hubby and I hosted a Tasting Dinner last Thursday at Bonefish. The evening kicked off with Chef Michael introducing himself graciously to the table and asking about food sensitivities and allergies. We had two gluten free (one dairy free) and one tuna allergy. He accommodated all of the special requests perfectly. With a table full of foodies, we were set to go!  The evening exceeded our expectations. We were hosting 12 people in the bar for a lovely dinner. We started with a plethora of appetizers including the famous Bang Bang Shrimp (crispy texture with just the right hint of spice in the sauce), Lamb chops (divine- carmelized and mid rare; lollipop size- my husband's hands down favorite app); ahi tuna served sashimi style (one of our friends said it was her favorite for sure); delicate beef potstickers with a nuanced sauce. Chef even improvised and made an gluten free Shrimp Italiano that was delicate yet luscious in flavor.  They were so many delicious apps on the table, we could have called it dinner! All of it was served with a lovely white blend and heavier red wine. Pomegranate martinis were a huge hit as were the fresh pear martinis. Most of us had Uber'ed so everything was flowing nicely!  The fish course, consisting of 4 tasting pieces each was the highlight of the evening for me personally. The first dish was a delicious jumbo shrimp paired with scallops. We also had a fresh salmon in butter sauce (my favorite- it had none of the strong overwhelming flavor that salmon can sometimes have); flame grilled grouper that Hubby LOVED! and finally a lovely sea bass balanced with a fresh mango salsa. Absolutely OUTSTANDING!   The final course was non fish and featured Filet Mignon perfectly cooked with a chimichurri sauce. One of our friends said this was her favorite of the night. Next was \"Lily's Chicken\" which included artichokes, sun dried tomatoes and was SO good. The other hit of the meat course was the pork tenderloin cooked with fresh sage and fontina. It was moist and delicious.  With full bellies, we ordered coffees and Expresso Martini's for some. The Martini drinkers loved them and said they could sip them all night! John, the Managing Partner came out and greeted us at that time and everyone told him how much they enjoyed the meal.   Two of my chocoholic girlfriends almost jumped out of their seats when they saw the trio of desserts- gluten free chocolate brownie with ice cream (have you seen grown women literally SWOON?), key lime pie (one of the choco centric gals said THIS dessert was her favorite) and last but not least a delicious coconut pie- not cream like you usually see- just delicious coconut in a delicate crust.  This review would not be complete without highlighting our awesome server, Joe. He is a true professional and did a fantastic job with keeping up with our lively, demanding table. THANKS JOE! YOU ARE THE BEST!  Bonefish outdid themselves with this awesome evening! A big thank you to Chef Michael and John for their efforts! We had a ball!"}
{"text":"I went to dinner with a friend and ordered the jumbo shrimp & scallops.  When the plate arrived, it had THREE scallops and FOUR medium shrimp - not jumbo at all and I asked the waiter to send over the manager.  I asked her if they skimped on this order of so few scallops and shrimp for such a HUGE price and she said this was the standard order.  I told her to take away this order and bring me an appetizer of bang bang shrimp, which was good, that I had for my dinner.  There is absolutely NO value for your money at this restaurant and I was so surprised that people in this town like to pay for so little food at such a HUGE price.  Hard to believe this restaurant is still open.  I do not recommend this restaurant at all."}
{"text":"Okay, but indifferent service.  Food is a little heavy for a seafood restaurant.  Had a Stella, and it tasted a little skunky.  It also wasn't quite cold enough.  Probably won't go back.  There are much better seafood options in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"A bar that cares to call you by name (bartender Tony rocks). Very nice place.  Food was somewhat pricey, but high quality. This is a place I will frequent.  Significantly exceeds expectations!"}
{"text":"The bang bang shrimp was amazing. Food was extremely fresh and well prepared. Service was phenomenal and our waiter, Jason, was very knowledgeable of the menu. I definitely plan on visiting this restaurant...so much more I want to try."}
{"text":"I made reservations for Saturday Feb 6th 2016 @ 6:45 , I arrived early 6:00 pm the reservationists informed me that they are running behind by 15 minutes. Well they never sat our party of 4 until 7:45 no apologies nothing. I know they were seating people without reservations because a couple walked in and ask how long of a wait and she was told 90 minutes that party was seated before us and I was there 30 minutes already. Don't take reservations if you can't seat people at a reasonable time close to there reservation."}
{"text":"Was here for lunch and had a great time! Our server, Jason Z, was wonderful. Very attentive and helped with suggestions. I had the Shrimp Pad Tai. Portion was very generous BUT way too spicy for me and I like things zingy!  Was only able to eat a small amount before saying that's enough -- too spicy for me. I think they should tone it down a bit and they would have a great dish. Whatever pesto oil dip they serve with bread is awesome!! I usually don't oil dip but this was wonderful and very flavorful. I will definitely go again but stay away from the Pad Tai next time."}
{"text":"Wife and I had dinner, which we both characterized as just ok, nothing exceptional."}
{"text":"We need this type of seafood grill in this area of North Phienix.  It is a step up in fare from Red Lobster. They'd like to have more lunch customers, they do well for happy hour and dinner."}
{"text":"Me & the wife went here on my birthday.  Curtis knows the menu & is friendly.  Dinner started out great receiving wine & app quickly.  From there salads took long & dinner took forever for 2 entrees.  Curtis was apologetic & gave us a heads up, however I now know why dinner took so long, my wife ordered a med rare ribeye & it came out well done.  Steak had flavor & we would of sent it back but after waiting for dinner so long, you just don't want to wait any longer.  We showed Curtis, again he was apologetic & said he'd tell his manager but that was all that happened.  No kind gestures on their part besides Curtis' apology.  Sea bass was great.  Will we go back, a big maybe."}
{"text":"It might be worth a visit just for the bread and pesto they serve at the start. We were scoping this place out for a potential birthday spot for my Mom and it should do nicely. Great shrimp appetizer, wood-fired chicken and Kobe burger for a test run. We'll be back for the  lobster for mom.  Our server was fast, professional and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"I went to this place yesterday during happy hours with my girls friends. The waiter give us poor service, he didn't even offer us complimentary appetizer. The manager had to came over and offer us bread with parsley and melted butter.  I order two tiki Martini and a min craft burger. When I get my check I see and extra tiki Martin I didn't order. So I told the waitress that I only order two martini. Now I'm looking at card info I see they charge me for two different charges. The worst place ever"}
{"text":"This place is great. The staff is very friendly and personable. The owner deliver the food to the table with a smile. The food was the best and fresh. I'm from San Francisco and I'm selective about my fish. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"If you aren't a big fish, not shellfish, fan you will be disappointed. If you like fish I think you'll like it. I wish they'd have more shellfish. If they did, I'd give a better rating. Service fine. Basically, a seafood carrabbas. I believe it is owned by carrabbas."}
{"text":"Our first visit to Bonefish was a great experience.  We could not get reservations but did the walk-in.  For walk-ins they have the community dining table and some tables reserved for walk-ins.  However, we were seated in a nice booth right away.  The service was prompt as they had a lot of staff on hand.  The menu was interesting but not exhaustive as to selection.  I ordered the Ahi steak and my wife did the shrimp & Scallops.  I ordered a Blue Moon.  The dinners came quickly & served nice and hot.  My Ahi steak looked to be @ 4-5 ounces but was very tasty.  My wife's choice had @ 4 shrimp and 4 scallops, good size but somewhat spicy for her taste.  We each had the au gratin potatoes and paid the $1 extra to upgrade the vegetable to broccoli from the couscous (couscous is not a vegetable in my book.)  We were a bit disappointed in that there was no baked potato option.  My Blue Moon was fresh but the cylindrical glass only held some 6 oz - pretty small serving for $4.5.  We did not get a salad or appetizer and our bill ran @$50.  Overall we really enjoyed the visit.  The food was good, the place lively with much bustle and background music.  We will definitely go back for dinner."}
{"text":"An hour and a half after finishing an expensive glass of wine as I did not prefer the happy hour choices, I came to learn that bottles of wine were half off when I overheard the other bartender telling a customer. My bartender's response when I asked him was 'I forgot.' Could have had a full bottle for a few dollars more than the glass. They also turned off the ESPN college football game in the 3rd quarter that had been on from the start in favor of the NFL game (without asking) which was on the other TV a few feet away. Had to use up a few Costco cards and past experience was average food combined now with poor service. Blow it off."}
{"text":"I visited this place with my wife yesterday and we will most certainly go back.  For two reasons (a) food (b) customer care. Everything we were served was of top quality, in freshness and preparation.  Just for the food I would highly recommend it.  But even more than that what I want to highlight here is the rest of the experience.  Basically, after waiting for 45min for a table (place was busy as you would expect on a Friday evening before the Valentine's day), and another 45 min for the food, we found that they were out of one of our orders.  Normally , something like this would be enough to walk out, never to come back again.  But there is something about how they treat the customers.  The person serving the table was so polite and caring that it felt like this was a case of genuine situation resulting from an unexpected demand on a busy evening than just careless planning on their part.  It was further evident when the managing partner, Brian Fischer, came three times to talk to us and was extremely apologetic about the whole incident and was trying his best to comfort us.  He never made any excuses and said he would fully understand if we never wanted to come back.  What had the potential of ruining my nicely planned evening with my wife, ended up being just fine, with great food, and great attention and service.    In trying to make up for the inconvenience, Brian offered to waive the charges for the meal with additional free coupon.  While I would have been fine without any of that (and I told hime so) it just went to show that he genuinely wanted to right the wrong.  Basically, this is a truly classy place that serves fabulous food and cares for their reputation and hence their customers.  I will strongly recommend it and will visit it again myself, especially to try the stuffed tilapia - their supposedly the best dish on the menu - that we missed yesterday."}
{"text":"After going to bonefish for quite a while I wanted to write a review about the excellent service, the fantastic food, and that terrific customer service I have received over the past few months. Today I went and had a salad in the salad was terrific the chicken was cooked right and it looked really good"}
{"text":"Server never came back to ask us how the food was or check on us (party of two) The beef and ginger potstickers were beyond salty. Ceviche was ok. Wine had been open waaaay to long before pouring. The tables are almost on top of each other. Will not be back."}
{"text":"We've been wanting to try this place. We are so happy we did!   We started with the Bang Bang shrimp appetizer...it was delivered to our table rather quickly. It was great! The perfect amount of crunch and spice. I feel like I could have made a meal out of it. Definitely enough to share.   Our waitress recommend a great wine that was perfect for our meals.  My husbands Caesar salad was fresh although he said it was a little bland he still ate it (usually he'll push it aside).    Our entrees arrived and they were delicious! My shrimp and scallops were cooked to perfection. Not too chewy not too dry. The sides were tasty. They did not skimp on the taste of the sides. My husbands twin lobster tails were perfectly broiled. He loved the garlic whipped potatoes.    We followed our dinner with the macadamia nut brownie...even that was perfect. We are so happy to have visited because we now have a new date night spot."}
{"text":"Quality is fresh and presentation looks nice but it's overpriced for what you get and the wait time to get your food is way too long."}
{"text":"Excellent. Best new place in the north hills. Service was terrific. The mahi mahi and chilean sea bass were great; but the appetizer bang bang shrimp was incredible. All ln all worthy of revisits"}
{"text":"We have always loved Bonefish and were excited that there would be one in Madison. That excitement changed to disappointment after eating there tonight. My shrimp and scallops were lukewarm. My daughter had to send her meal back since they mixed up her order. They replaced part of her order and the other part was cold. Of course, everyone else was done eating when her food arrived.  Apparently, she was suppose to be happy with this.   There are lots of restaurant choices in the Madison area and I think we will be making a different choice next time we go out."}
{"text":"Had a good table, were seated immediately, great service ...and three of us had the Kobe beef burger and 100% surprised and pleased with how yummy it was. I ate every bite and left no room for creme brûlée.   Tried the peach martini -was okay.    My favorite part of the evening...they wouldn't let a guy in who wax wearing z wife beater and flat billed ball cap. NICE! Stick to a dress code Las Vegas!!!  Lets keep it classy for a change. You won my forever fan ship Bonefish Grill!"}
{"text":"Bonefish \"bang-bang shrimp\" are addictive! Be warned! This place is well-run, and very popular. We usually make reservations for Friday and rarely wait more than a few minutes. Without a reservation you could be looking at \"an hour and 15 minute wait\" no lie. People come and wait though. Order the \"bang bang shrimp\". Just do it. You will not be disappointed. Salads are tasty and well composed. Wait staff is attentive, if a bit stretched. Food comes promptly and is always good. This place is not inexpensive, but they have their act together, so it is worth it. If this is your first try, you night want to go on a weeknight so that you aren't distracted by the huge crowd. Also, ask for a booth when you place your reservation. They are much more comfortable, and you don't have to listen to the conversation at the neighboring table of \"expressive diners\"."}
{"text":"Happy Fathers Day. I was in the mood for some seafood today so I tried the fresh grouper that was recommended by the bar tender. It was cooked perfectly and the mango sauce on the side gave it a good flavor. The meal took quite a long time to arrive, the manager came and apologized for the delay and said she would comp the meal. The bar tenders were great as well. I will definitely be back. The food is excellent."}
{"text":"This was a great experience.  We got two of the lunch specials (fish tacos & Caesar salad + crab soup & house salad combo).  Both were extremely well priced and delicious.  We also got the ceviche appetizer and it was loaded with tasty shrimp.  The bread that came out first was solid as well.    Service and atmosphere was also on point!  Our waiter, also named Michael, never lett our drinks go less than halfway full.  The Manager even gave us a \"Buy One Get One Entree Free\" coupon for us to come back in the future for dinner.    We look forward to exploring more of the menu at this location in the future.  More updates to come..."}
{"text":"I live near a Bonefish location but I drive out of my way to go to this one.  They have great food, drinks and service."}
{"text":"Update from first visit...the food was much better.  I was definitely impressed with this.  However, the service is still not up to the standard of every other bonefish I've been to.  When we first walked in, I smiled and said hello, but was greeted with a very dry \" how many?\"  We were seated and told they would be out with bread and water.  The glasses at the table were visibly dirty.  When we picked them up we could feel how nasty they were.  The waitress came out and immediately started pouring water.  I asked her not to because the cups were dirty.  She apologized and took them away, but never replaced them with clean ones.  We watched as about 10-15 minutes went by and we still didn't have bread.  Other tables were greeted with water and bread and we still didn't have any.  So the next time we saw the waitress, I asked for bread.  She came back with it and apologized that it was just now ready.  The bread was warm on the outside but almost frozen on the inside!  The forks were also dirty.  The only good thing about this visit was the food.  As I said earlier, it was very good.  This is the ONLY bonefish grill that I have a problem with.  I wanted to give them another chance because it is so close to me and they just opened not long ago. However, I will not be giving them another chance.  I'll continue to drive to Huntersville location where they know how to cook and provide good service.  Their prices are to high to have to choose between the food or good service."}
{"text":"Slooooow service. Small portions. Greasy fish and chips with more breading than fish. Fish used to prepare dish did not seem to be fresh cod but instead maybe frozen sole? Server forgot our appetizer, yet went on and on about personal issues. Oh, and food poisoning! On the up side, I will never waste my time or money here again!"}
{"text":"I've now eaten here 3 times. 2 out of the 3, our order was taken correctly, the kitchen made the wrong order. The last time, they even made the reorder wrong. Food is decent and priced fairly. you won't be blown away by anything"}
{"text":"Just had dinner there last night. The good: food was prepared well, I had the filet mignon and crab cake. The filet was thinner than expected, but cooked as ordered and delicious. The cervichi appetizer was also fabulous. The service was very good, there was a slight wait to be acknowledged, but once we were, food orders were quick and staff very friendly.  The only downside was the size of my cocktail, though made with fresh ingredients and well executed, for a $9-10 drink, it was small! Four sips and gone, please serve a martini filled close to the rim!.  But, I would recommend this restaurant and will return. Menu has lots of options for all types of eaters."}
{"text":"Based on service alone this was the worst I have ever experienced in Vegas. I'm a local here and don't expect to be treated any different. The food took almost an hour to get out to us along with the drinks. We waited for almost 45 minutes for just the ticket to pay. We were in the restaurant for over 2 hours. Waiting. We were told  there was an issue with the system. Then we were told that the system went down. Then the waitress made a snide comment that because someone in our group of 7 moved to another seat that it ruined everything in the system. The surrounding tables all paid and left long before we even got our ticket. It's the worst service I've ever had. The food wasn't worth the cost either. It was severed incorrect to almost every person who ordered. Medium burgers come out as charred. No gluten means everything is served with gluten. And if you want warm food forget it. It was like eating food fresh out of the freezer. Ice cold. And to top it off no sorry from the manager. I wouldn't suggest eating here unless you are waiting for the world to end because that's about the amount of time you'll sit waiting for your food and ticket"}
{"text":"Always a great experience.   Outstanding food and drinks.  Definitely sit at the bar for the best service and drinks. Ultimate dirty martini and the espresso martini are amazing.  It always feels like home.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"LOVED IT!! We started with drinks at the bar - great happy hour prices! When we moved to a table for dinner, the wait staff were right on it. Our server was fantastic, attentive and very happy to explain the menu to us.  Appetizers came quickly and they were wonderful as were the entrees. I highly recommend Bonefish to anyone who wants really fresh, tasty food paired with terrific staff!!   Definitely going back!!"}
{"text":"Had a reservation at 4:45, no one in the restaurant but could not get seated for 30 minutes and after I asked to just be seated and get a drink of water.  Was told it was against policy to do that and we were waiting for our waitress who was late? We were finally seated but no one even spoke to us for 10 minutes.  When Ms late waitress got there she told us she could not take our whole order (only drinks and starters) because others were waiting.  Never been to a restaurant where we asked for simple things that were against policy.  I found myself explaining that seating customers, taking orders and providing water was NOT against company policy.  10 more minutes to get a glass of wine?  2 couples just left while we waited.  2 other couples just took over tables in the bar (we were told we could not do that)  No managerial presence at all (or maybe the couples would not have left)  Food ok I ate the scallops; bang bang shrimp had no bang, dumplings were mush. BUT food was better than poor attitude and service. Only come here if you want your servers on the mean side!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and food. Started off with great cocktails and appetizers. It was my husband's birthday and they treated him very special. We love this restaurant. Coming from California, we greatly appreciate fresh grilled seafood. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Slimy and greasy  Almost broke my neck slipping on greasy floors, I guess the children working there are above cleaning floors. I have never seen a restaurant with so many employees standing around not doing a damn thing. Service was terrible,  food presentation was a joke and food was standard fair at best. My advice to the owner, Do Better"}
{"text":"This was definitely a good spot. I always drive by it, but I just never felt like trying it until the other day. I'll definitely come back and try some other things on the menu. My girlfriend and I were happy with our meals and our waiter or chef I forgot what he was, but he brought us complimentary Calamari and that was very good as well. It's a nice place to go for an occasion too. Bonefish Grill didn't disappoint."}
{"text":"Awful front door service. Waited 1 1/2 hrs after given a 1/2 hour wait time. Ordered a few drinks at the bar. There were no appetizers passed and front wait area was packed. Hostess area showed no empathy for waaaayyyyy underexagerated wait time. Left before we were seated. Too bad we have enjoyed ther food prior to this. Really turned off by attitude."}
{"text":"My husband ate there for lunch and were very disappointed.  The server was very nice, I think his name was Glenn.  I asked what Baja fish was and he said Pollack.....what happened to cod for fish and chips.  Pollack is the stuff they make the fake crab and lobster and mince to make fish sticks!!!  Pretty cheap to use Pollack.  My husband's fish sandwich was tilapia and was not very good.  Will not be back."}
{"text":"Delicious! My husband and I went on a short trip, staying in a nearby hotel. We ate here and were very happy with our decision! I had the shrimp and scallops and my husband had the sirloin with the crab cake. Both were wonderful and the service was great."}
{"text":"LOVE Bonefish Grill! Haven't ordered anything I didn't love. Great staff and great service."}
{"text":"We just had a painful experience for an early dinner on Sunday. I have never felt so rushed through a meal before. My salad arrived and not a minute later our entrees were served. When I indicated I had barely taken a bite of my salad, the server remarked that the kitchen was fast. No apology. My friend enjoyed his food, but my scallops and shrimp were way overcooked. Our check was plopped on the table before I had finished my entree. I will not return here anytime soon! I was really disappointed after reading other rave reviews."}
{"text":"Have dined at the Bethel Park location several times. Each time we have had great service and the Bang Bang shrimp is a must every time we eat. The place is usually busy, so call ahead ."}
{"text":"good service from waiter although they talk too much. modest servings. nice ambience but we notice menu is too rice based."}
{"text":"From the very beginning we had issues. I called to place a reservation and was told at 3pm that there was about an hour wait. When I got to the restaurant and told them my name I was told I didn't have a reservation and could put my name on the list and wait another hour. The hostess had this tone as if it was our issue. I told them that was acceptable. They scrambled to put together tables (which included folding chairs)that could not accommodate our large party. We told them that would not work. So after another 30-40 minutes they managed to move tables around to seat us. Needless to say it took over an hour for our food to come out and almost everyone's food was cold. The waiter was very nice but was hard to find when you needed something. This was my first time here and last. You would think the manager would come over and apologize for everything that happened but she didn't. We didn't finish dinner until 6:45 when our checks were given to us. The majority of our time was spent waiting."}
{"text":"Definitely our favorite restaurant ever! Not one single complaint. Everything from great drinks to great food to amazing service. I can't remember the name of the martini I chose but it was the best drink I've ever had. My husband got the filet mignon and it was amazing melt in your mouth meat. I got the talapua imperial and same. Absolutely amazing melt in your mouth delicious. Of course the bang bang shrimp appetizer is a must. And our server mike was absolutely incredible. He was happy polite, got our food and order in a timely manner, and just went above and beyond to make us have the best experience ever. I actually asked to speak to the manager before we left to give the compliment."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the portions vs the prices. Food was flavorless and I can only assume it was frozen meat. I ordered the lobster roll, it came out in a tin bowl with a lettuce base underneath it and the fries. I am assuming this was an attempt to make the meal look larger but it caused my fries and bread to be soggy. It also came with a 3oz of coleslaw and one oz of ketchup.. I hope they don't break the bank with giving me those \"large\" side items... I am giving it two stars, one for our nice server and the other for the coleslaw. Just wish it was a larger portion since it was the only item with flavor."}
{"text":"Nice environment. Nice worker and very good food. I took my wife on a date at this place. Sat at the bar since they only serve oyster rockafella if you sit at the bar o well bartender/ server Brandy really nice person and made us feel welcomed. Mix drink alci is good too. I suggest you should try the bang bang shrimp. It's their house special stuff really good.1 happy customer here thanks guys and gals"}
{"text":"The restaurant is fairly new to the neighborhood and we were so looking forward to going there for dinner.  Heard good things about Bonefish Grill.  I will start by saying that it is very nicely appointed with a pleasant atmosphere.  Of course I tried the Bang Bang Shrimp, which turned out to be a very good appetizer. I ordered the Moscow Mule, also very good...although on the smaller side for the price.  From the menu we ordered Chilean Sea Bass, Crab Crusted Orange Roughy, and the Kobe Beef Burger.  Now whoever is posting reviews of how insanely good the food tastes at Bonefish, should have their head examined.  The Kobe Beef Burger had to be sent back.  The Char overwhelmed the flavor. Terrible.  My Crab Crusted Orange Roughy was so overcooked and dry I could have been eating Carp and would not have been able to taste the difference.  The Chilean Sea Bass, which should be the most delicious, was awful.  Watery not flaky, lacked that buttery flavor.  Not sure if it was Chilean, could have been Sablefish.  So disappointed.  This falls squarely on the shoulders of the Chef and their staff.  I think this is a great concept and would work well but there has to be a major shake-up in the kitchen and the preparation methods for cooking."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite restaurants.  Food and service are consistantly excellent. Since my wife and I are seniors, we like to share a salad and entre and Bonefish will separate the meal on to two plates in the kitchen.  We really appreciate this service. I suggest always making reservations as this location is always super busy."}
{"text":"We love the Tuesday night special.  We were there twice.  Cannot beat the price with the happy hour together.  Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Tried Bonefish Grill for lunch this afternoon and was mightily disappointed. The service was appalling which made the entire experience awful. Will not plan on returning."}
{"text":"First time trying this place. Everything was just eh. The Baja fish tacos could have had a better flavor. They were kind of boring. The crab cakes weren't the best either. I almost got annoyed with them and couldn't finish. You almost feel like your not really eating crab. The corn chowder and lump crab soup also called have tasted better. The flavor just wasn't there. And save the best for last. Dessert! I ordered the key lime pie....which was also not memorable. Call my crazy but it almost tasted as if they put garlic in my key lime pie or some type of ingredient that just doesn't go with this dessert. I had pretty high hopes but I won't be eating here again."}
{"text":"We frequent here often.  Never a bad meal.  Also get on their Wine Dinner mailing list.  Awesome everytime."}
{"text":"I have been to many bonefish grills before, including this location, and have never had such a bad experience. The service was fine. Just fine - not good, but the food was terrible. I ordered a sirloin and crab cake dish with a side of mashed potatoes, but I upgraded the sirloin to a filet cooked medium. That sucker was the rarest steak I have *ever* seen. It was practically still mooing. Everyone at the table was astounded at how undercooked it was. Even the ones who like rare steaks thought it would be too rare for them. At any rate, I sent it back to be cooked. When the steak was returned to me it had been charred on the outside and was still pretty rare on the inside. I hadn't eaten 1/4 of it when I asked for a box. That was honestly the most poorly prepared steak I have ever eaten. It was absolutely terrible. Granted, I don't eat steak often, but it was seriously bad. My boyfriend was very disappointed in his dish as well. He ordered some sort of stir fry and it had been wildly over sauced. I would have only put that much sauce on a dish with twice as many noodles... The point is we had a terrible experience at this bonefish. The food was awful.  Maybe this bonefish recently hired a new chef who just doesn't know how to cook, maybe someone was having an off day, but when we complained we were brushed off. I am terribly disappointed and will not be returning to this location again."}
{"text":"This would be a great restaurant for me if i liked seafood at all. Basically everthing they serve is seafood with extremely limited alternatives. In other words, dont bring someone here if they dont like at least one type of seafood. Regardless i was able to order a burger, one of the only non-seafood dishes. For the record the burger was incredible (although kind of tricky to eat) and thats really why im giving it four stars. They had tvs so we could watch the steelers and bucs at the same time, which was cool. Prices were average, but definitely reasonable for the food. Although i cant personally attest to the seafood, i can say that every single person of my group (6 people) enjoyed their seafood. I did try the shrimp, which was actually really good although a little spicy. All things considered as a seafood restaurant, this one is really great. However, if you want anything besides seafood, youre in trouble."}
{"text":"I've been to Bonefish Grills all over the U.S and love the food, but this place did not live up to the others.  Went in and there were only 3-4 tables with patrons.  The bartender did a horrible job handling the bar and those of us seated there.  It took us close to an hour to get our food and all the meals were cold.  I then had to go to the bar to pay the bill because he never came back to our table.  You couldn't pay me to come back to this location.  Far too expensive for poor service and cold food."}
{"text":"I have always been impressed with Bonefish. Friendly staff and great food. Their specialty cocktails are consistent and delicious. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"reservations for 6 at 3pm on a Sunday (today). Very disappointed that it was a lunch menu instead of dinner on a Sunday. Pretty limited. We had to ask to be waited on after ~10 min. of waiting. Server acted like we were putting her out. Not everyone's food came out at the same time. They forgot a side dish. The food was not good. Porkchop was very pink and the stuffed tilapia was tasteless. It was a problem when we asked for crayons for the 2 kids. I have been here twice before and it was very good and we were treated well. NEVER AGAIN! It has gone way down hill. Oh, and the large glass light above our table had a thick layer of dust on it.   Wrote to Bonefish to share my poor service and food. They did not bother to respond so I guess they do not care. Goes right along with this locations food and service. Any company should care about their customers."}
{"text":"I had a business trip in Cleveland and decided to go here for dinner.  When I first arrived I planned on sitting in the bar since I was a single person....no need to take up a table.  But the bar was full.  Upon walking up to the hostess I heard the man in front of me say he was a single table also.  She asked him if he wanted to sit at the bar.  He replied that it was full and she happily sat him.  Upon her return I explained the same, that I also would have sat at the bar but there were not any seats available.  She told me there would be a 15 minute wait.  No problem, I said ok and took my pager.  Not two minutes later a couple walked in and she sat them immediately.  How rude.  I understand you dont want one person at a six top table but where is the customer service.  Im a paying customer also.  The manager must have seen the dismay on my face, because he quickly came over to assist me and he also sat me.  My service was great after that.  I ordered the imperial tilapia and it was awesome.  Potatoes were wonderful and fish was flaky.  I had a great meal and despite how it started it definitely ended great."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice now and both times have been great. Good cocktails, great appetizers and entrees. Last time I had the artic char pasta and it was delicious. The service is great and I'll be back soon for sure."}
{"text":"We went to this location for my grandmothers birthday. The wait staff was borderline pleasant however, the wait time for food for a party if six exceeded 45 minutes. I ordered the shrimp pad Thai - a fool proof dish- knowing that bonefish consistently has poor food quality. As expected, my dish arrived in a hockey puck of pasta, my Spouse's dish was over cooked \"ahi\" tuna , while the rest of our party was underwhelmed with their food. For $15 plus a dish you certainly would expect better. I was turned off by the fact our server literally handed plates to people at the head of the table to PASS DOWN to the rest of us, as if they couldn't be bothered to actually serve as they should have been trained to do. Our servers were ridiculously unkempt, Ill spoken, and poorly trained. I never liked bonefish to begin with, but my grandmother wanted to eat here as it is close to her retirement home. She had a salad for dinner and was pleased. You can't mess up a salad. The important thing is that she had a good birthday dinner. We will NOT be giving business to this chain ever again.  Save your money. Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Although there were empty booths, had to wait.  Staff seen standing around, appearing to do nothing. Drink order arrived 20-30 minutes after ordering.  Martini did not have olives as requested. After bread/pesto delivered, had to request bread plates. After about another 20 minute wait, soup arrived lukewarm. Glass of wine had particle floating on top; returned to kitchen and a fresh glass delivered. Cobb salad delivered with NO chicken and drenched in dressing, when I'd requested dressing on the side. Replacement salad delivered with NO chicken again! Companion ordered calamari as appetizer; it was delivered after the entree salad and was rubbery - returned to kitchen. While apologies were made, it made for an extremely LONG and unpleasant event. I will not return to this restaurant.."}
{"text":"This was my first time dining here. A friend of mine loves this place so I thought I would give it a try. We arrived pretty early at 5pm so there were a lot of open seats. Decided to just sit at the bar. The hostess that seated us seemed irritated to have to bring us a menu which I thought was odd because she wasn't doing anything.  I was hoping this wasn't how the rest of the dinner was a going to go.  We started off with the bang bang shrimp which was very good. The complimentary bread was also delicious. We ordered a pair of their red sangria which tasted very good but I'm not sure exactly how much alcohol was in it. Then again it was only $6.00 so I guess I can't say much. By this time I was getting a little full so I decided to get the chicken Cobb salad. The chicken had no taste (no salt or pepper) and neither did the salad. I had to season it with some pepper myself and asked for a little more dressing. Would never order another salad from there again. My girlfriend had the bang bang tacos which she said was tasty.  Overall, our food was pretty good. I think some of the items on the menu are a bit overpriced. Our server made up for the rude hostess. I'll probably try other restaurants in the area esp with all the new restaurants at summerlin mall before coming back here."}
{"text":"they would have got 6 stars but the waitress gave me a glass with lipstick on it! Great food and drinks"}
{"text":"Love seafood so was happy to see new restaurant in the area. Unfortunately will not return because the food was so disappointing. The bread was the best part. My scallops and shrimp were decent but my wife's rockfish and both our potato dishes were way too salty. Service was good and manager stopped by to see how things were but I don't want them to make it right after the fact so did not complain. So disappointed  :("}
{"text":"As a rule, we love BFG! This one not so much! Bang-Bang Shrimp was breaded too much and there was no bang! They were out of sweet tea, we had to wait for them to brew more. Bread not placed in table until just before meals arrived. Husband's asparagus was bigger in diameter than my pointer finger. And, his shrimp and scallops were served cold. Daughter's shrimp tasted very \"fishy\". Three other kids ordered angler steak (sirloin). They were given and charged for filet!! We will not be going back to this location!!"}
{"text":"Bang Bang Shrimp is worth getting--has a nice flavor and crunch to it, but could be spicier. I'm not into super spicy foods, and this dish didn't really come close to my threshold. They provide warm, soft bread with an olive oil/pesto blend to dip it in--I'll probably try to recreate that. I chose the Tilapia Imperial with a side of French green beans (the optional part) and \"seasonal vegetable,\" which ended up being spaghetti squash. With living in the Pacific Northwest and traveling to Boston and Hawaii, this was hands down one of the best pieces of fish I've ever had. The stuffing of shrimp, crab, & scallops within it seemed almost non-existent, though. The scallops were really the only noticeable piece in it, even then, they were the tiny scallop variety. A lemon caper sauce is drizzled over the dish and it compliments it well. The biggest miss was the spaghetti squash--not much to it and I feel like there are a lot more favorable produce selections for this time of the year. Butternut squash puree maybe? Anything with a better texture, mouth feel, and flavor. I remember reading about it from another review when the place first opened up. Wasn't thrilled when I asked what the seasonal vegetable was and that was the selection . You'd be better off paying extra for a different side from their selections.   Overall, service was exceptional and friendly, fish is delicious, bread & oil dip is worth a fuller stomach. For a chain in Madison, it's a nice option. A little pricey. Nice ambience. 3.5/5 would be more accurate."}
{"text":"Bonefish Grill is definitely one of the better chain restaurants that I've been to, and if claim to not like the Bang Bang Shrimp, you're a liar. This specific new location is definitely still getting in the groove and dealing with a heavy patron load. With that in mind, the food was the high quality you would expect from a well know seafood chain, and the service was very pleasant."}
{"text":"Great meal, my wife and I enjoyed it very much. We had dinner there Saturday evening and the place was packed and had a laid back atmosphere. The bang bang shrimp were awesome as was the corn chowder soup. My wife had the heart of lettuce salad and told me it was great. I had the cold water fish from Norway and it was excellent and extremely tender and buttery. Our service was super and the waiter knew the menu well. We will be going back soon."}
{"text":"First visit since return to neo.  Food was great had the Mahi Mahi backend very good.  Three folks there all meals prepared to our liking.  On tap selection needs some work.   Over all a great meal."}
{"text":"First time at Bonefish Grill is the place was simply great. The ambience is warm, inviting, and has a great classic nightlife feel. This is now a recommended place to take friends, a date, or enjoy a simple dinner.   Our server Bryce H. was very knowledgeable of the menu and had excellent recommendations, especially for an indecisive person l like myself. Great customer service.  Thank you Bonefish team."}
{"text":"Disorganized. We had two servers, the first of which seemed to be on his game however, he was quickly booted out by a server who couldn't care less about us. Split one appetizer and one entrée and drinks for a table of two. Overcharged my bill about $17 and the whole ordeal took nearly TWO HOURS! Place was half full btw.  All of this could've been forgiven but when I brought it to the manager's attention the guy condescended me by explaining how taxes work. I would've brought it directly to the servers attention but she was nowhere to be found.  I feel bad about dinging the staff...but seriously screw this place, never again.  Food was so-so......go to burntwood tavern or wasabi, or McDonalds...you'll leave happier."}
{"text":"Thought we would give this restaurant a try today. We were looking for a place we had never been to since we always seem to end up at the same places whenever we go to Madison.   Walked in and it wasn't too busy. A waitress with her hands full was walking by as we came in and she greeted us immediately. She said the hostess would be right with us to help. Not 15 seconds later and the hostess was taking us to our table. She gave us our menus and that was the last time we were spoken to until we finally gave up and left. We sat in the middle of the dining room for about 10 minutes while, at least, 8 different employees wandered by us. As we were walking out my husband went to let the hostess know we were leaving. However there was nobody at the hostess stand but there were 5 employees standing at the far end of the bar talking to each other about their weekend.   They must be pretty content with their current clientele because it was obvious they didn't feel the need to bother themselves with a couple of newbies.   We ended up going to Longhorn and we had a waitress, bread and drinks within 10 minutes. They seemed to have more guests & less staff so how could they have such better service? Looks like we will stick with the tried and true restraunts and we will not be recommending this place to any of our friends."}
{"text":"Went there with my wife and we ordered 3 martini's each.  I ordered the Ocean Tropic Heat and she ordered the Pomegranate Sage.  Normally, after three martinis we would be feeling pretty good but nothing...absolutely nothing.  Weakest drinks ever.  At $10/per, don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Not a good spot to eat at lunch unless you have the time. I don't know if it was the time of day, or what was going on.. I work close by and decided to go have lunch around 1:30 p.m.. We walked in and the hostess was nowhere to be found, a waiter did come to greet us and went to look for the hostess to seat us. The waiter that greeted us ended up serving us.. I ordered tea, appetizer, and our food, asked for sweetner, had to ask another server before I got it..  At least ten minutes later had passed, and had to asked another server about our appetizer and he came back to let us know that it will be another five minutes. I asked if our order was even entered and  he just smiled.. This guy was super attentive, brought us bread and came back to let us know that the manager was taking care of the appetizer. There were not a lot of customers at that time and my guess is that is why staff seemed to be MIA.. Manager never came to our table to address  our concerrns... Food was great, but not the service I expected..."}
{"text":"Had the grilled tilapia topped with mango salsa with green beans and its was so delicious! Our server was nice but had no energy! He didn't talk very much unless he ask us if we wanted water. Nonetheless great food and the atmosphere was awesome!"}
{"text":"Martini Monday's !!!!    Great food.   Billy is an excellent waiter.   Tilapia with imperial topping is great.   Will be back soon"}
{"text":"best fish I ever ate im not a big fish eater but will go back"}
{"text":"There's so much to say about this place! We had a reservation at 7:30, we arrived a few minutes early and were seated immediately. The hostess was very friendly as well as the entire staff. This was my girlfriend and I anniversary. I had asked if it was possible to have flowers delivered to the restaurant. The staff said absolutely and I was amazed that they had them waiting on the table when we were seated.  Sorry to all the other boyfriends and husbands there that night but the wait staff made me look awesome and my girlfriend broke out in tears for the romantic gesture.   The restaurant was busy but it didn't slow down the anglers one bit. The place is clean and the is laid out perfectly. I dislike a place where the isles and tables are crowded and you get in and out of your seat easily.  The service is five star our angler went above in beyond in table side service. Other restaurants should take notes because this is how it's done. I would give 6 stars A+++++  The Food was awesome! As you've probably read that the bang bang shrimp is excellent! Everything was delicious beyond what I was expecting for seafood in the desert. They even gave my girlfriend a complimentary box of chocolates for our anniversary.   I will be a huge fan of Bonefish Grille and will be back again soon. It's hard to find a place that combines a great food with a great dining experience."}
{"text":"We were seated in a booth with lots of cold AC coming down on our heads. Asked if they could cut back on AC, were told they would. No improvement noted. Moved to another booth, slightly better, but still cold. Restaurant remained chilly through meal. Ordered red pepper soup, got bland tomato soup with touch of red pepper. Ordered ribeye steak, was told they were out of item. Received a \"sirloin\" steak with almost no taste. Wife's fish was mediocre. Service was lackadaisical. Non-fish menu selections were few. Previous visit ordered barbecued pork chop. Received dry, tasteless pork. In summary, this is an inept restaurant with fairly tasteless entrees. Keylime pie dessert was good. Probably will not visit again !"}
{"text":"The service was good, but the food was lacking a lot. The sea food was over cooked and the beef was under cooked. Glad I used a gift card because I wouldn't have paid for that kind of food. The crab cake was more of a crab scoop same goes for the potatoes just scooped on the plate like I was back in elementary school. Never going back!"}
{"text":"I'm updating this review because I ate here again and wanted to comment. It was my birthday and I made reservations for 7:15. Got there a little early they didn't even ask if I had reservations.  My husband asked the hostess if they did anything for birthdays. She told him to tell the server that they didn't have anything set up but she would do something special. That was not the case at all. I ordered the ribeye & lobster sauce with potatoes. My husband got a different kind of stake. When our meals came my steak was full of fat. But our server didn't come to check on us until my husband was finished with his meal. I was never offered a drink refill either. I asked for the manager, who said he was sorry and they would comp my meal. It did appear that my husband may have gotten the ribeye. He said his was great. I was so disappointed with the whole experience. This makes the second time that I ordered the ribeye that came loaded with fat. Needless to say I won't be wasting my money on their steak again. After contacting the management online they sent me gift cards. I haven't been back. Now I'm trying to find a friend to give them to. It will be a long time if ever that I go back."}
{"text":"Our waiter Mike was the best part of the experience at Bonefish; he was very attentive and a good guy.  Other than that, the food was a step above Red Lobster. I've had better food from the prepared food section at Whole Foods. And I know this is a seafood restaurant, but the grade of steak they use is Choice?! Really, like the value-pak stuff you get at the local value market? Neat!  Anyway,  you probably won't get food poisoning, but don't expect anything to wow you."}
{"text":"Happy hour bang bang shrimp is delicious, can't beat it!! Service is great, atmosphere refreshing."}
{"text":"Bang Bang Shrimp was aces. Mahi Mahi was perfect."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and i like to go to new restaurants every chance we get so we get a taste of our city. We try to stay away from \"chain\" dining but figure we should give Bonefish a try none-the-les.   Called ahead to see if reservation was needed on a weekday, none needed unless you were a party of 8+.   Ryan Rust (server trainer) was our server and he was great! Wasnt the typical here is out special jabber that i hardly listen to but was very brief about some suggestions and friendly.   He suggested a pear martini and moscow mule which were fantastic.   For appetizers, we order the Bang Bang Shrimp, super great to share for two. The shrimp was cooked perfectly over some lettuce - a nice pre-entree snack!   Entrees were the Oscar Mahimahi and the shrimp scampi snapper (specials menu).  we generally don't visit the same restaurant twice unless we really liked it, Bonefish Grill will be on our list for returning customers, the credit goes to our server for making everything very enjoyable on our date night!   Thanks Ryan!"}
{"text":"Very poor service.  Waited more than 15 minutes before hostess offered water.  Canceled drink order because meal was almost over.  Food was good but experience of crowded restaurant with loud birthday party group, slow food and overall bad service will make me think twice before going back."}
{"text":"First time experience wasn't bad. The \"Happy Hour\" menu wasn't bad but could've had a few more items to choose from. Drinks were pretty good. However I didn't like the portion sizes. That'll be something that will keep me away. Nonetheless it was a good time and the service was on point, which is key."}
{"text":"If you want a slow dining experience Bone Fish Grill is the place..I had the 8oz Chilean sea bas very good highly recommend..My husband had the cold water lobster (2) Just the right portion. The best was the desert we had the flourless brownie it was the best,,Was not too sweet..Our waiter Kameron was very personable and he knew the menu very well  and gave great suggestions.."}
{"text":"I would like to comment and say my fiancé and I returned to Bonefish for lunch, it was a much better experience. Lunch hours are definitely the time to come dine to avoid hours of waiting and a crowded, restless mob of people hovering the check-in. Our service was very good and we had a quick but nice lunch.  As always, the food was delicious. Their lobster bisque is amazing and the bang bang shrimp is a must try. Absolutely recommend."}
{"text":"Food and service are always fabulous.  Love the changes they've made with the new menu."}
{"text":"Had Sunday Brunch yesterday YUM!!!!!!!!!, server Michael B, number one in our book, As always, this restaurant is very accomadating , right on top of everything, the food is the best always.  Keep up all of the good service in this restaurant Marcus.  The only thing I did notice, which was outside of the restaurant:  We arrived a few minutes before the restaurant opened, as we sat in the parking lot watching the employees arrive, they were parking in the prime front row spots.  I think they should be leaving those spots for the patrons."}
{"text":"We have been here 3 times since they opened.  Food is so yummy, specialty drinks amazing and the service is off the charts friendly, attentive and fun.  So excited they are open."}
{"text":"Amazing service! The brunch is so great...$20 for all you can drink mimosas, bellinis, or sangria WITH a delicious meal! The greatest deal in Summerlin..you have to check it out."}
{"text":"First timer and what a treat! Don't even know where to begin. Started out with the Big Bang shrimp and Winter white Cosmo and I was not disappointed. For the entree I had the talapia stuffed with scallops and shrimp and my dinner date ordered Chilean sea bass blacked. Delicious!! And to top it all off, coconut pie.   I think I have a new favorite place. Highly recommend to everyone. We had reservations and we were taken in right away. Not sure what the wait would be without. Either way, definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Went here when we first moved to town. Was a quiet night, but the food was good.   I had the spicy tuna bowl and a moscow mule as a drink.  My wife had a crusted trout with potato and brocc.   My meal was great. My wife's trout was awesome.  The only complaint was her brocc. was extremely undercooked.   Otherwise, the bonefish is a place i see us coming back to."}
{"text":"Nice, flavorful soft shell crab. Sautéed to perfection! Lemon caper sauce was tasty. Sauteed spinach side dish offered perfect accompaniment. Service at bar was speedy and steady throughout dinner. Always look forward to next visit!"}
{"text":"Love Bonefish!  Gotta try the Bang Bang Shrimp. Yummy."}
{"text":"I had dinner here with my family the other night and it was AMAZING! I honestly thought it was going to be one of those super fancy places to eat but I was wrong. We were seated right away. Super friendly hostess. Our waitress, Virginia, was such a doll! She recommended great good and wine. And Yes! You have to get the BANG BANG SHRIMP! We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch and was surprised how empty the dining room was. There was a much older crowd, but the staff was attentive and courteous.   Ordered the fish sandwich which was a massive cut of fish on a tasty brioche bun (I think). Smaller than expected side of fries, but seasoned well.   My friend got the fish n chips which was an ample amount of food. The fish looked like there was more breading than I'd prefer, but he was very satisfied.   Would go again."}
{"text":"Great food and service at Bonefish.  Tried Lily's chicken for the first time and it was excellent. My wife had a perfectly prepared steak as she likes it medium rare.  As always, the Bang Bang shrimp is a must!"}
{"text":"Food quality great, portions small. Ordered iced tea and got tea that was sickening sweet. Waiter should tell customers that they have a choice. Waiter was going to bring me sample of soup and completely forgot, he only had three tables to wait on. House salad was good, size of salmon was small for $17.50, was supposed to have kalamata olives, had 2 only, very few sunflower seeds. Skimpy!!! Other salad ordered had tiny croutons, as if cut in half, we had to ask for more. Hot water for tea was just warm. We went for lunch on Saturday and they do not have a lunch menu, only dinner menu (more expensive). Won't go on Sat again!"}
{"text":"Food is overpriced for what is offered. Service was ok. Some dishes came out much later than others. Would not go back."}
{"text":"Amazing Food!!!!  I'm tellin you - get the Bang Bang Shrimp, it's awesome.  The food is really great quality here, with very special tastes.  From steak and chicken to the seafood, any and all the appetizers - it's just fantastic.  The service is wonderful, and the atmosphere is very inviting with warm colors and lighting."}
{"text":"I give this place only 3 stars mostly because of the slow service. Went there for lunch and it wasn't very busy, the hosts greeted us and we were sat right away. But then we say there.... We waited too long for the server to arrive at our table. It was slow and the server wasn't busy. He never asked \"can I get you anything\"  it was \"do you need something\" I just find that a little rude. The food came out quickly which was nice. Enjoyed the bread while waiting. When finished, We asked for our check and once he dropped it off, he disappeared. I was going to pay on the card but after waiting too long I chose to pay with cash and leave a less than satisfactory tip. And I'm not sure if out server was high on some sort of drug or just extremely tired, but he seemed very awkward and was hardly visible. The food was delicious, but the service was absolutely terrible. I might return if I get a different server."}
{"text":"The food was cooked perfectly, but not seasoned to our older and wiser taste buds.  It wasn't seasoned too much just a little bit more than we would have wanted.  The muscles were cooked with more butter than we preferred, but 10 years ago I would have considered them rich and perfect.  The broccoli was seasoned with more salt than we preferred.  The vinaigrette dressing on our salad was sweeter than we preferred, but again 10 years ago it would have been perfect.  The lobster and fish were grilled and seasoned just right for us.  The service, lighting, and ambience was very nice for a romantic evening or night out with friends."}
{"text":"Only giving 2 stars because server did a pretty decent job otherwise it would be a 1. We picked up a bottle of wine at the bar while waiting for our table. bartender was a little slow considering how few people were at the bar but no biggie, she was friendly and even offered to take the wine to our table.  Server quickly greeted us brought us water while we looked over the menu. We settled on 4 items: Large order of ahi tuna Wagu beef and ginger potstickers  Bang bang shrimp tacos  Blackened fish tacos  Ahi was a little bland Potstickers -  first order was cold to the touch second was luke warm Tacos - they originally brought out 2 orders of the shrimp (kitchen told server they had sent out one of each and someone else must have taken ours). Shrimp was ok, not much \"bang\" though  Blackened fish tacos were good.   Would have complained to the manager but he was busy dealing with another complaint from a table near us and we just wanted to get home.   Skip this one!"}
{"text":"I went to check in at the hostess desk and apparently the computer was down to check our reservation, which I get. We then had to wait for a table when someone walked in previous to us without one and was seated. I had mad the reservations for my husband's birthday, which wasn't noted since the reservations were missing. They usually ask the dining occasion, and didn't. Once we got our food the garlic potatoes were crispy and brown and the steak to be cooked at medium well was medium at best. We love the one in South Hills. The food is amazing there and so is the staff. We will never return to this one and keep going to the one in South Hills."}
{"text":"The service is horrible. The restaurant is run by a bunch of 20 something kids that think customers are causing their problems while they read their texts.  We simply asked if the music could be turned down a little bit and the server immediately said no. We asked to speak with the manager and the server said no. The bartender disappeared as well.  There were only 9 customers in the restaurant on 9/8/15 at 6:30pm, why would you anger two others that wanted dinner and drinks for such a simple request. They music playing outside could be heard 150 feet from the restaurant and inside the noise was over bearing and not conducive to any conversation.   I can't remember when loud music made the food taste better or the service any better.    I look forward to the day you close your doors."}
{"text":"We went on a Monday night, so the restaurant was busy, but not overly full.  We were seated immediately.  Our waiter took our drink orders, and they arrived shortly thereafter.  However, it was a while before he returned  to take our order.  The waiter then actually asked if we wanted bread.   Doesn't everyone get served bread as a routine?  We thought this was odd, and when we said we did want bread, he said, \"oh, okay, the I will bring some out for you\".   I got the corn chowder with lump crab to start and the rest of the party got house salads.  The corn chowder was delicious and the house salads tasty. When our entrees arrived, we were all surprised that the servings  were really small.   The sirloin with crab was good, but nothing to rave about.   The Chilean sea bass was nicely grilled.   The fish and chips was a disappointment. The fish tasted as though the oil that it was fried in was old.  I ordered a cappuccino afterwards.   This took a while to come, and when it came, it was in a really small cup.  We asked the waiter if this was cappuccino, and he insisted that it was.   I sipped it, and it was really bitter.  Everyone at the table took a sip and we all agreed that this had to be espresso, not cappuccino.  I did not drink the espresso.  The waiter brought the check and we asked him again if there was a mistake, and he insisted that we had been served cappuccino.  A supervisor  happened to walk by as this was happening, and said that what I had was definitely espresso.   She asked if I still wanted the cappuccino, and I said no, because it had taken so long for the order to arrive.   The waiter then had to fix our bill to take off the cappuccino charge, and this took more than half and hour to fix.   We could not understand why it took that long.  Overall, a disappointing finish to the evening.   Service was slow and we think the serving portions were small for the prices charged."}
{"text":"This place was okay. The restaurant itself looks nice and we were seated right away. My waitress was nice. But the food took forever to come out which I know wasn't her fault.   The crab cakes and lobster stuffed shrimp were delicious. The Baja fish tacos were not however. Rubios has better fish tacos. Will possibly try again. Hopefully their food timing is better when we do."}
{"text":"Having come from Florida where Bonefish was our fav, we HAD to try this out to see if it compared. IT SO DOES. The Bang Bang Shrimp, Tuna Sashimi, Lobster Bisque, and Sea Bass were Amazeballs! Ask for Chad-HE ROCKS and will take the BEST care of you! They give you a small box of chocolates on your birthday :)"}
{"text":"They spent all the money on decor rather than training staff.  They were unfamiliar with which items are wild-caught (only swordfish on a fish menu!).  Steak came out raw, and Swordfish also under cooked.  We would not recommend"}
{"text":"Have not had a disappointing dinner here yet!  I'm sad they don't have Halibut anymore, but lily's salmon is equally fantastic."}
{"text":"I went to this place two weeks ago with the girls. 5 dollar drinks is what brought us in, and the bartender was not cheap on the liquor.   All I had for food was appetizers and they, although relatively small in size, were the opposite in flavor. YUM!"}
{"text":"Fabulous food - great service! The manager checked on every table & brought us 2 glasses of champagne for our belated anniversary. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to the new Bonefish Grill in Crocker Park for a early dinner on Friday. We found the service and food to be excellent.   We enjoyed martinis while we explored the menu and found many of our favorite items including Oysters Rockefeller, Sea Bass and shrimp tacos.   Our server was friendly and did a great job of making us feel welcome. Our food came out as ordered and was excellent.   We are happy to have a new seafood restaurant in Westlake and will definitely go back."}
{"text":"The moment you walk in the door and sit down...dont let menu options overwhelm you. Start with the bang bang shrimp and do NOT miss the Mussels Josephine- as a foodie.... I have to say, best in the city....we used TWO loaves of warm delish sourdough bread to finsh the amazing sauce and I think one of our group might have licked the bowl after.,         I had Lily;s Chicken... was awesome with the garlic mashed potatoes... huge portion for just 14 bucks! *the only reason restaurant not getting 5 stars is I dont eat red meat and told my server that and the garnish/side dish on my entree (which was not mentioned on menu) was a garbonzo bean salad with SAUSAGE! Thank goodness a friend spotted it before it went into my mouth or would have been catastrophic!!!!*     Other than that- the ahi tunn starter weas delightful, my friends sea bass was not smelly and was very satisfying, the grilled tilapia tacos with mango salsa were fabulous! We never felt rushed and the prices were incredible. Afforable and delighful! Not only all that, Ashley our server was charming and funny and attentive!!!!! I will be back, soon...craving those mussels!!!!!"}
{"text":"We ate outside on there outdoor patio. It was nice that they had that option. The waitress was great, and 2 different managers stopped by the table and asked how everything was. While they don't have a huge variety of beer on tap, they do have a decent selection of craft beer bottles. We had bacon wrapped scallops which was a special appetizer for the night and the bang bang shrimp along with complimentary bread. Both of the apps were great, but we loved the bang bang shrimp. We then had the crab crusted cod and the lobster stuffed shrimp for our entrees. Both delicious as well. Although this place is a bit pricey it is worth the money. Reminds me of a seafood style \"Bravo\"/\"Brio.\" We will definitely eat here again in the future."}
{"text":"I have been there twice. Both times everyone in our group was delighted with their entrees. Everything was reliably delicious and delicately seasoned. Great service too! Thank you for opening in Madison."}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this place! I want to try everything on the menu! The price is very reasonable! I had the chocolate Creme brûlée and I must say its the best in town!  If you need help deciding what to get, try their Bang Bang Shrimp appetizer! Big enough to share with a friend...but if you're  as much of shrimp lover as I am, I suggest not sharing!:) Speaking of shrimp, if you're in the mood for surf and turf, order the Surf N Turf burger!! You won't be disappointed! Lastly, if you're 21 and over, try the cold snap cocktail-blackberry frost! Puts the \"OH SNAP!!\" In every sip!! :)"}
{"text":"Like most places I feel like the customers that are there should take priority instead of a phone order and the girl in the front I had to tell her twice for her to finally sit us. She took us to the very last table in the back where just to take our order was about 10 min wait and for the food to come out took 30 min. I get that we got there at 8 and closing time is 9 but that still doesn't mean to not care. Also on top of that there was a really bad smell where they sat us and I told the waitress and she went to get the manager and nothing was done. Overall it was just a bad experience. My first and last time going there.  Looks nice, the food was pricey but just a terrible place. Never going back."}
{"text":"Fantastic! One of my all time favorites. Great  food, good prices. Bang bang shrimp is amazing."}
{"text":"Wonderful food and great service from everyone. Our waiter, Shad, was very professional and extremely attentive! I was in no mood to make a decision, with all the great choices, and he made the perfect suggestions with drinks and food. A very enjoyable date night. We will definitely be back and we want Shad!"}
{"text":"Had a bowl of chowder and wrap for lunch.... quick service and company was exceptional"}
{"text":"This is a great place! They always have great specials and the bang bang shrimp is amazing! Also, one of the best happy hours in town."}
{"text":"The best grilled fish. We both had the grilled Rainbow trout and we can't wait to go back for more."}
{"text":"For starters we had the new Sushi grade tune wrapped in a fried wonton with asian slaw simply delicious a must try and its a new menu item.  Two thumbs up for sure.  As always are meal was delicious and the atomosphere is wonderful.  A true gem in Matthews if you haven't tried it it is a must."}
{"text":"A great place to enjoy a relaxing dinner after a long week. It's nice to find a white tablecloth restaurant without going to the strip. Nice variety of fish and sides."}
{"text":"I took my mother to dinner here for her birthday. Even though it was a busy Friday night, the hostess was very helpful in trying to push my mother and I up in line for waiting. We were even surprised with a little gift for her birthday. The menu has many options, and the food is delicious. I definitely will be visiting again."}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Corn chowder over floury, fish and chips over breaded. Crab cakes had an odd flavor. Good service at a non-busy time. Another example, I'm afraid, of a large chain restaurant trying to pass itself off as gourmet. Only Cheesecake Factory seems to be able to pull it off. Superb creme brûlée though, but not enough to make me come back."}
{"text":"Nice casual but expensive dining. The menu is limited but very tasty. If you go, you should try the shrimp, I have not had any like it anywhere. Staff is professional ad knowledgeable of menu items. Mixed drink are delicious! Bonefish Grill is an awesome place to take someone special and to celebrate a special occasion. On our visit, we tried the 'couples special'. Portion size seemed small to me but were adequate, I did not leave hungry."}
{"text":"Fish was super unfresh, fish&chips very greasy, my order fish taco was weirdly sweet... both of us were about to puke now... there were more servers than diners on a Saturday, they said \"serve brunch\" outside and we walked in and received lunch menu instead."}
{"text":"Annie made our night tonight. The food was fresh and tasty, the wine was good and the service---excellent!!!"}
{"text":"i went to this place a few nights ago with my wife.  the place is nice looking and we got good service.  my wife likes to order a drink on their menu with jalapeno in it and salt & pepper rim which i recommend if you like spicy.  its also notable that this place has wild salmon which isn't always so easy to get in las vegas.  i got the salmon and it was cooked perfectly, no complaints.  place is a little expensive but i think its worth it.  they have a coconut pie dessert that is really awesome.  would go again."}
{"text":"On our last two visits we have been disappointed in the way that the waiters at Bonefish in Town Square served our table in filthy uniforms. We spoke to the manager who said cleaning their uniforms was the waiter's responsibility. He said he was thinking of changing to black uniforms to hide the stains.   We wonder if the waiter is in a dirty uniform what else is dirty in the restaurant, possibly the kitchen.   We spoke with customer service who said that they hoped this doesn't stop us from returning to the restaurant, but said nothing about correcting the problem.   This is unfortunate because we really like the quality and selection of the food and always had good service."}
{"text":"Just had dinner here tonight, the service was deplorable!!!  At first our waitress seemed attentive, she took our order for a bottle of wine within the first 5 minutes, but after that everything went downhill.  We had to ask for bread after our salads arrived, then it took another ten minutes to get the bread.  Then our dinners arrived when we had not even finished our salads.  I told the server to send the dinners back because we had just received our salads and bread.  Then finally our waitress came to the table to see how we were doing and we told her what happen, she was totally indifferent to the situation. Of course, they sent out the same dinners that probably were sitting under a warmer, that came to the table as over cooked fish and lacking the luster of a fresh dinner plate.   Then we had the nerve to order dessert,  donuts that come with whipped cream and chocolate sauce which came to the table without an offer of dessert plates and silverware!!! I guess I expect better service for a dinner that costs close to $100.00."}
{"text":"I have always loved coming here. The staff and the food is excellent every time. They have an incredible muscles appetizer in a white wine sauce that is to die for. I ordered the Baja shrimp tacos as an entree and they were absolutely delicious. And i can forget about the complimentary bread and oil. All of our food came out within approximately 10-15 minutes which was perfect. Our waitress checked on us regularly and answered any questions we had with no hesitation. Oh and it was $5 martini Monday just to top it off. I will definitely be making a trip back to the Bonefish Grill very soon."}
{"text":"Previously I have enjoyed my meals here at Bonefish with spectacular food and average customer service. BUT I was APPALLED at the service we received. We made a reservation a month prior for my birthday dinner on Christmas Eve. My grandma travelled 7 hours to dine with us for my birthday and we showed up for our reservation. An hour and a half later (after our reservation time) our party of 5 was sat squeezed into a table for 4 people. On top of all of this the servers were extremely slow. I am extremely disappointed at how unprepared they were for the Christmas Eve crowd."}
{"text":"We've eaten at this restaurant in other locations and had a positive experience.  We  are health conscience so were excited about having one in our area.      Pros:  friendly staff.  Lots of menu choices.  House made chips and the house salad dressing were very good.  Warm bread with pesto sauce was salty but we thought good.  Cons: However, don't go very hungry-- LONG wait, very small portions for price- 4 very small scallops and 4 smaller sized  shrimp for almost $17.  Grilled fish, shrimp and scallops had very little flavor- completely forgettable.  Fish tacos had same completely forgettable fish.  Nothing special.  Atmosphere was cramped and loud.  Our waitress was flighty.  We will not return."}
{"text":"Nice seafood place away from the casinos.  Food: 7.5/10 - Nice menu selections. Well prepared.  The flavors will not wow you but they are a solid meal.    Service: 8/10 - No problems. Nothing spectacular either.  Cleanliness: 8/10 - No visible issues.  Decor: 8.5 / 10 - Sat outside on a beautiful night.  Was very nice.  Inside looked nice as well.  Restrooms: 7/10 - no problems.  Parking: 9/10 - Tons of parking.    Overall: 7/10 - A nice place to eat.  I personally like the Texas de Brazil located right next door MUCH better."}
{"text":"I liked this place, service was good, grilled salmon was great! I also tried watermelon martini, very refreshing. Cool place with warm atmosphere, I recommend."}
{"text":"Not one of my better Bonefish meals. Ordered Pad Thai Shrimp. Tasted like it was reheated in a microwave. Shrimp were overcooked and noodles were all stuck together. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"This is a must try! All 6 of us shared our dishes and they were all amazing from the bang bang shrimp to the tuna bowl and the lobster stuffed shrimp.. All were more then expected also customer service was Amazing."}
{"text":"Our group of four arrived at 4:30pm. The dining room was clear and empty from the host stand, but we were told there is a 25 minute wait because of booked reservations. Maybe sooner if there were some no shows. Really? The room was empty except for two tables and there is a wait? We were welcome to sit at the bar since it is first come seating. Great idea host, we had two small children with us. Way to go the extra mile for guests. That was my first and last time attempting to dine at the Bonefish grill."}
{"text":"Got the bang bang shrimp to start then the filet and crab cake. Was really good. Waiter made nice recommendations which was nice. Also gave us a buy 1 get 1 free coupon for lunch."}
{"text":"If you are a fan of mashed potatoes as a side, you should try their garlic whipped potatoes. Oh! The best mashed potatoes ever! Subtle taste of the garlic and the creamy mashed potatoes went well together. It was a party in my mouth"}
{"text":"I remember how good the Eastern Ave location was  It's been a long time since I ate at a Bonefish. I remembered how awesome the bang bang shrimp was and the delicious bread with the dipping sauce. I was so excited thinking about what I was going to eat. Hostess sat us right away and the waiter got our drinks and orders. Of course, we started with the bang bang shrimp and waygu ginger dumplings. Not at all what I remembered.. Shrimp was not crispy, sauce needed salt. How disappointing. Dumplings were ok. And where was the bread?? Had to ask for bread. Bread was warm but dipping sauce was olive oil with specks of pesto. Maybe I was expecting more. Onto Chilean sea bass, it was ok. Small serving. Crab cakes were ok. Soft and soggy. Sauce ok. It was just an ok dinner for two that cost $132 with just ok service."}
{"text":"The Bonefish Grill is an excellent upscale seafood chain with one Cleveland area location at Rockside Rd & 77. The space is relatively small, as it shares a building with Outback Steakhouse. There is a main dining room and a bar area with several tables. We sat in the bar area.  The restaurant is pretty dimly lit, but it didn't really bug me (we also sat near the door on a rare sunny day). The staff is very friendly and professional. No complaints about them at all. For my entree, I had the mediterranean style salmon. It was excellent. It was salmon topped with feta cheese, pine nuts, green olives, and tomatoes and was on top of jasmine rice, which struck me as odd as this was a Mediterranean dish, not a Thai dish. It tasted great though. For dessert, I had the strawberry shortcake. It was also excellent. Overall, if you're looking for a great place to eat in the Independence area, check out the Bonefish Grill. It's a great place to eat."}
{"text":"Ate there Saturday noon and it was very disappointing. Service was very slow with wait staff standing around chatting with each other.  My wife ordered Caesar Salad and they brought it with no dressing.  We also had to ask for a fork three times.  Her corn chowder was barely warm.  I ordered Pad Thai and it was a congealed mess with little flavor.  The Pad Thai at Noodles and Co. is far better.  The people on both sides of us were complaining about service, it took 1 hour for them to get their soup and salad order.  I noticed neither of them finished their soup. Real glad we didn't try them for dinner as lunch was expensive enough. So many better options in Madison."}
{"text":"Their chilean sea bass is by far the best I have ever had. The staff and service is just excellent."}
{"text":"This is my second time here in the last month. So I can say that I certainly gave it a second chance.  The food is only mediocre. First time I had bang bang shrimp, though it started out good it became extremely mayonnaise based. This time I tried fish tacos or at least I thought there was a slight reminence of fish there, somewhere.  But the injectable doughnuts where awesome once they cut the tip off the bottles. Oh and cocktails, I would only pay happy hour prices for. Btw, we hot offered someone else's food four times."}
{"text":"My sisters and I went to Bonefish Grill for my Birthday and the food was very good. I ordered the bang bang shrimp and the coconut shrimp. The coconut shrimp were huge and delicious. Brent was our waiter and he was great, he made suggestions answered questions and kept our glasses full.  Will definitely come back with hubby next time."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch and the restaurant was nearly empty. I had heard good reviews for this place and thought we would give it a try. I would return because there are a lot of great items on the menu.  We had some nice craft beers, iced tea, edamame and calamari to start. We had been rating our experience with calamari dishes for the entire 2 week holiday and this one rated towards the top. Crispy, panko encrusted and very tasty. The edamame was good also in an unique sage salt. For our main lunches we had the Po Boy, which we great but a lot more spicy than we had hoped for. The sauce for it was delicious but with a big after burner kick. I had the fish and chips which was nothing special but tasty and filling. Lastly, the Bonefish House Salad, it was a very nice presentation. The salad was filled in a large glass container, and placed upside down on a plate, when served, the container was pulled up and the salad filled the plate. Nice presentation and it hit the spot but next time I would ask for less dressing or on the side.  The decor and environment were nouveau, clean and comfortable. Since it was a quiet lunch it was a nice surprise to have the chef come by the table to say hello and see how out food was."}
{"text":"i've only eaten at bonefish once, but i enjoyed it.  the food was great and so was the service.  i think i ordered tilapia...or some other white fish.  but it was tender and delicious."}
{"text":"Last night we dined here. . Service was superb , we had the bang bang shrimp, the Chilean sea bass ( I had mashed and asparagus ) the berry sangria and creme brûlée for dessert . Definitely 5 stars . Looking forward to going back"}
{"text":"My wife and I went there this weekend and had a great time our server Melissa was great.  Bang-Bang shrimp is awesome I had the filet cooked just right m.r. (i know its a fish place)  My wife had salmon and commented it also was very good.  The place get crowded so go early to avoid a wait."}
{"text":"My husband and I went there last night. The restaurant is small. The tables are so close together we felt closterphobic. The food is overly priced for what we got. The Bang Bang shrimp tasted like rubber.  My salad was overly dressed the lettuce was swimming in dressing. Not to mention the lettuce was not very fresh. The steak was dry and not seasoned. The lobster tail was tiny. The side of squash melody had beans in it.  The salmon was grilled fine but lacked flavor."}
{"text":"Amazing service and the food was fresh and delicious.what more can you ask for? I can't ask for anything more they aimed to please and it was mission accomplished"}
{"text":"We have dined at BFG in other cities and were excited to have them here in Madison.  Hint: if you are planning on eating here, make an online reservation. We really enjoyed our meal. Service was very good too."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Sat at the bar and ordered a mixed drink with my dinner. The bartender-who did not deliver my food-FORGOT to make my drink.  Ordered potstickers that were in the saltiest sauce that I could hardly eat them.  Even regular soy sauce is not that salty.  Crab cakes were spicy and I really don't think they were described in the menu that way, so I wasn't thrilled with them.  I don't think I'll go back to this one or any other one."}
{"text":"What a total disappointment!!! The food was decent, but the service and attitude from our server(Annie) was horrible. We went at 6.30pm on a Friday, and tried ordering the special... \"We're out of the special\", so my wife ordered the seabass that happened to be more expensive than the special, but asked for the pasta that was described on the special. So the bill comes, and they charge an additional $5 for the pasta, in addition to the $25 for a piece of fish! Annie never told us about the charge when ordering, then argued when we disputed the $5 charge. I gave her my credit card, the check comes back for signing, but with no adjustment! Then she has this attitude and slams the check back on the table and says (in a very sarcastic voice) \"have a nice night you two\" Pathetic attempt at service! ***note to the management*** that $5 just cost you all our future business, and that of all our friends that will listen!!!"}
{"text":"We love the Bonefish in Wilmington, NC and the one in Johnson City TN, but this was just so-so!  Greasy food, did not taste fresh and the service was average.  I had to wait 30 mins for a refill on my empty water, while she kept getting my husband liquor drinks.  Will not return to this location"}
{"text":"I've been here several times before and I would've given them four stars each time.  Yesterday, not so much.  Got there around 1:30pm with my niece and we were seated right away, and the hostess brought us a soda and an iced tea.  A bus person then brought bread.  So far, so good.  Unfortunately it was about 10-12 minutes before we saw a server.  She apologized for the wait, and took our order.  I asked her for sweetener for the iced tea, which had been sitting in front of me all this time.  She left to place our order and didn't come back.  I figured I'd just go up to the bar and ask for sweetener, since the server was pretty busy.  I tried asking the two servers who were at the bar, as well as the bartender, all three of whom completely ignored me.  I went back to the table just as our server returned with the sugar.  We got our food within a reasonable time, both of us having ordered the Bang Bang Shrimp Tacos.  The shrimp was only lukewarm, appeared to have been slightly under-cooked and was drowning in the sauce.  I was going to say something about it, but the server never came back to ask how things were, so I just sucked it up, ate one taco and left the rest because the shrimp were skeeving me out a bit.  Finally caught her attention to get the check, but unfortunately, she never did inquire about our satisfaction with the meal -- just asked if we wanted boxes to go, which we declined.  Honestly, since she saw we were done eating, with each of us having left 75% of what we'd been served, shouldn't she have asked whether everything was OK?  Granted, the kitchen was slammed that day because there was a group of about 20pp in the same room at the same time.  But since our server was not serving THAT table, I'd expected a bit more in terms of the service.  The kitchen seemed to have just thrown it together just to get it out."}
{"text":"I called to see if we could be seated or if I needed reservations. The general man that I spoke with was wonderful so I was excited about eating here.  I was asked if I wanted a drink when I sat down but when I asked what kind of hot tea they had, the beverage person had no idea.   My wait person came and I felt as if I was in fake smile and compliance land. She just kept saying, \" very good,\" with that plastic smile and insincere voice.   The food was over spiced. To much salt, pepper or whatever was the chefs house favorite of the moment. ( great way to ruin sea scallops! )  Anyway, the swordfish was so soaked in butter, I had to wonder what demographics are they going after. ( not west coasters)   Anyway. It was a failed night of dinning. Enjoy if you have no idea what good sea food should taste like."}
{"text":"My first time to bonefish and I was seriously underwhelmed. The food was just okay. I got their mussels and mahi dinner special. Meh. Definitely not worth about 40 dollars. They were seriously understaffed when I went. Around 630. I watched this poor girl go to about 8 different tables in my hour there, which resulted in seeing people not even get drinks by the time I had received and almost finished my appetizer. (I have been a server for 8 years so I pay attention to these things like a total weirdo lol) Service was meh. But the server was very nice and apologetic, so I'll chalk that up to being understaffed and poor management. There were two younger female managers walking around but not helping at all. They both walked by my table (which was very close to the host stand, where they spent the most of the night, talking) quite a few times while I went my whole meal with EVERY old plate we had used stacked at the end of my table. Which is super annoying. (I only knew they were managers because my guest was a server where the two ladies come in and use their bloomin brands manager discount cards.) I won't be back."}
{"text":"Great grilled Chilean Sea Bass with mango salsa! Food was great as well as the service. Only complaint was that the music was so loud!"}
{"text":"The service was not good. Place was empty and could not get a server to come out after I ordered my appetizer. The appetizer i ordered was the mussels and I give them a 1 out 5. Came in a sweet sauce and over cooked. Not my favorite. The manager did come out and talk with me. He offered me and my wife free dinner. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Let me break it down, this place looks really super fancy, and I love the decor. I like the uniforms they're required to wear, its just all a great atmosphere. Thats the only thing that was good. The price CAN be acceptable, and the drink menu CAN be acceptable. However, the food was awful. I can deal with a small portion of steak and a shrimp skewer with a small side for close to $30, I don't need a plate full of food to be worth it. That is ONLY if the food is good. The food was so bad I am on Yelp trying to save you a $100 dinner date night filled with the smallest drink I've ever had (though was good, mule). So, I'll break down why the food was so bad. It's steak, it was cooked right, but had no flavor. I mean no salt, pepper, just burn marks on the grill. Potatoes were bland, shrimp wasn't all that bad, because that had seasoning on them. The bread was better then my steak. I know what some might think, hey, don't go to a fish place and order a steak... Then don't have 6 variations of steak on the menu, and who doesnt like surf and turf. Bottom line is if the food had taste I'd like this place. But it didn't."}
{"text":"Was excited to try this place out after checking out the website.   Ordered the Seared Ahi Tuna appetizer. When it came to the table it immediately made my wife and I cringe. It was discolored and looked rotten in some spots. Ahi tuna should be bright red, this was blue and gray. Didn't even touch it.  For an entree I ordered the \"Special\", Scallops with Risotto. Scallops were fine but the portion of risotto was about 4 bites and it was $25. Half of the plate was green beans.  Also ordered a side of \"mashed\"potatoes. They were disgusting and had the texture of instant mashed potatoes. No doubt that they were from a box."}
{"text":"Remarkable! This was my first time at Bonefish Grill and I was impressed. I am more of a \"meat head\" as Yelp has labeled me but the fish here was amazing. I had the wild caught haddock with garlic potatoes and streamed broccoli. The service was exceptional as was the bread and oil. They have a special olive oil dipping sauce that was good enough to take home. In fact we did get some to go. The servings are plentiful and we had enough left over for lunch tomorrow.   We will be back again! Next visit I will add a picture. I was so excited about the food I forgot to take one."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful meal. Victoria was an excellent server with a bubbly positive attitude and always a smile. Had the scallops on the special menu, which were perfectly cooked. Authentic key lime pie for desert (yellow with a hand-formed crust)"}
{"text":"This restaurant is so good! The service is great and the food is delicious! The food comes out fast even when they are packed!"}
{"text":"Presentation of the food was great and that's where the greatness ends, they do what a lot of the new hip and trendy restaurants do, they take normal food and put a twist on it, no big deal, service is slow, portions are small, if you're on a diet come here, if you're hungry and like to eat, don't come here!"}
{"text":"I celebrated my deceased mother's birthday last night 10/20/15 at the Bonefish Grill located at 8701 W Charleston Blvd, Las Vegas, NV and I LOVED the Swordfish with the Pumpkin Ravioli, the flavors together were just magnificent. The staff was very friendly and I enjoyed every moment. So glad this restaurant came to an area for us locals."}
{"text":"I'm usually very wary of chain restaurants. But, this chain restaurant rocks. I went to a Bonefish Grill ten years ago when I was in grad school out in Philly and always remembered thinking how good it was. When one came to McCandless, I kept telling my husband that we have go there, that he would love it. I wasn't wrong. We got ceviche as an appetizer - awesome. I got a scallop meal for my entree, he got ahi tuna - both awesome. They gave ciabatta bread with an oil dipping sauce - so awesome. The blackberry sangria I had might have been the best sangria I've ever had. And I would know. I love sangria, I get it everywhere. Really really dynamite food. And service."}
{"text":"Had a good meal here. Good, not great. The service was good, not great. The price was very good for the quality of the food and service. Been here a few times, and it is very consistent.  This restaurant is located very near 3 busy hotels and the intersection of 2 interstate highways, so most of the patrons are travelers. It tends to be busy early in the evening (6-ish), but by 9PM is relatively quiet."}
{"text":"Love the place. The Moscow mule and kiwi drinks were awesome. Bang bang shrimp is the best appetizer ever. Had misoyaki Chilean sea bass and shrimp pad Thai for dinner and both were awesome!"}
{"text":"Writing this review was tough. I want to like, even love this place but I just can't seem to get over the unpleasant experience we had. Lets get started.   We came here because some of our friends said the food here was great. I'm always excited when friends rave about a new place. Upon entering, I was quite impressed. The hostess was friendly and the atmosphere was open and very trendy. What a great start, or do I thought.   We found our group and sat down. As we were chatting, this lady shows up and stands by our table and doesn't say anything. When we finally greeted her, we found out she was our server. She didn't even say her name or hello, just a 'can I get you something to drink?' We ordered some drinks and they took a really long time to arrive, one by one. Not a very good sign.  Ordered our food and hoped for the best. Here's what's on the menu:  APPETIZERS: Ceviche: good, not great. The fish seems like they were already cooked before everything was tossed together. The overall dish lacked flavor. It was precooked fish, scallops etc. tossed with lemon and avocados. The avocados gave the dish some flavoring. Not my favorite and will not be having it here again.   Bang bang shrimps: This dish is great to those that love mayo. It was good, I don't know if I would give this dish 5 stars. It over dressed and reminds me of having walnut shrimp at a Chinese buffet.   Caesar salad: Nothing too special here either. Both of your salads were overdressed and soggy. Not very appealing, especially when it seems like the dressing wasn't even made in house.   ENTREES:  Shrimps and scallop, mango salsa and green beans: To my surprise this dish was good. The scallops were cooked nicely and well seasoned. The shrimps were a bit undercooked so I didn't eat them. And my green beans were no longer green but brown, so I didn't eat those either.   Fish tacos: These were very good. Fresh and light. There's only two tacos so if you're hungry, order two orders.   Salmon and asparagus: salmon was flaky and not over cooked. Asparagus on the other hand were soft to the touch and brown.   Sea bass: I didn't try this dish but it did get great reviews at the table.   The food here isn't bad, but it also not amazing. But then again, what are you expecting from a chain restaurant? What would have made our experience better was the service. Our server was not friendly, didn't seem to know the menu items and it was slow and completely unorganized. Everything about the service aspect of this restaurant is unorganized.   They have a concept call \"team work\" here. This is when the team/staff needs to help each other by delivering food and clearing the table etc. this is a nice idea, except no one at this location seems to know how to do it. Drinks came one at a time. Coffee came one at a time. By the time we got our coffees, the rest of the table had already finished theirs and was waiting for us. Our table wasn't clear of all the empty appetizer plates before dinner got dropped. Our server failed to be a decent server. I'm sure if I went to Denny's, the server there would have done better job. Such a waste of a restaurant space. Bonefish has a lovely room and prime location but the staff is a joke.   I would recommend this place to people under the circumstance that they just sit at the bar. Here's a tip that I live by, PEOPLE COME FOR THE FOOD BUT COME BACK FOR THE SERVICE. Get it together bonefish. Look at your entire staff and start picking out the weeds or you'll be packing your bags and leaving not just henderson, but Vegas, for good.   Happy eating everyone, ciao :)"}
{"text":"I can't say enough great things about the staff and manager of this location. My husband and I come here often and the food and drinks are always perfect. My last visit, the crew went above and beyond when my cell phone was dropped in a very difficult to reach area, the manager actually came out, rolled up his sleeves and basically dissembled furniture to retrieve it. They were very light hearted about the scene I caused and couldn't have been more polite and helpful. I look forward to our next visit. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Love Bonefish Grille never have been disappointed in what I have ordered!  They also have the best martinis! Great dining experience"}
{"text":"Came here on a packed Saturday night with my mom and boyfriend. There was a 1/2 hour wait so we sat at the bar. They have some very pricey drink items (who doesn't).. but they also had $5 house specials. I started with a raspberry vodka drink and my mom had a lemonade concoction of some sort. Both were DELICIOUS. She practically chugged that thing, and if hers was half as strong as mine I'm certainly surprised she didn't fall off her bar stool.  A manager also came around offering a sample of their calamari. I am a fried squid FREAK, and theirs is hands down the best I've ever had. It rests on a spicy-ish sauce and was crispy and fresh.  It was our first time here so when we were seated our server, Terry happily explained the menu and answered all our questions. I had eaten shortly prior to our visit. I insisted that they order and Terry gave me plenty of time to finally decide on a bowl of corn & clam chowder. I didn't feel rushed at all with him. He had a very outgoing personality and kept us laughing and entertained throughout our meal. My mom said her scallops were the best she's ever had and they practically melted in her mouth. Boyfriend had steak and was very impressed that a seafood joint could cook such a great hunk of cow.   Highly recommended restaurant. Pretty pricey, but worth it! Ask for Terry if you go!"}
{"text":"Daughter and mom decided to try Bonefish Grill on a warm Pittsburgh Saturday. This was our first trip to BG, and I wasn't sure what to expect. The revolving door at the entrance is a neat feature for a restaurant, I'm easily amused by things like that.   The inside of the restaurant feels modern, when compared to places like Joe's Crab Shack, or Red Lobster, yet it still felt okay being casual. Our server was Melanie, she was pleasant, and after getting our beverages, let us know ordering Bang Bang Shrimp as a starter was a good move.   The lunch special my daughter ordered was Lily's Salmon with goat cheese, I went with the Maryland lump crab cakes with red remoulade.   The Bang Bang Shrimp was good, the Thai style creamy sauce was tasty, and made the dish. My daughter said her salmon was great, the goat cheese was new for her, and she quickly learned to not eat the goat cheese by itself, but to eat it with her mashed potatoes, and salmon. My crab cakes were smaller than I expected, I got two that were a little larger than meatballs. The lump crab was easy to see, and there was not a heavy bread crumb, or filler ratio. My sautéed spinach tasted very fresh, and just needed a bit of salt.   We had an early lunch in a quiet, not crowded restaurant. Overall it was a nice experience."}
{"text":"This place is our \"go to\". We prefer to sit in the bar area, they are always friendly and the service is fast. The food is great with good portions. The staff make helpful suggestions and know the menu."}
{"text":"The food is here consistently good; prepared well; good value for the money.  Friendly people at the bar. What kept me from giving 5 stars is service.  Sat at the bar; had to repeatedly ask for things; silverware, server who brought food out to bar didn't seem to know where it was going so just asks out loud who had what. Also some of the \"patrons\" seem a bit low class; better suited for a Denny's than a nice mid-range restaurant.  Not sure where they are coming in from since this is an upper middle class neighborhood."}
{"text":"This is my go to restaurant. The food is always amazing and the staff is professional and friendly. The best night is $5 martini night.  Their bang bang shrimp appetizer is big enough for an entre and so amazing!"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch. Got a cold blue moon on tap. I then went to the Fish Taco and Cesar salad combo. It was a GREAT salad and probably the best fish tacos I have ever had. These aren't street tacos... These are elegant tacos done high class, taste and quality.   I will be back...FOR SURE"}
{"text":"Normally good quality food. Nice ambiance. The service has been hit or miss. We've been here when  it wasn't busy. Always amazes me when you go somewhere and see servers talk to each other instead of checking on their couple tables."}
{"text":"It's a funny story how we ended up here.. We actually had a living social deal to Flemings, they were too busy so we stopped into bonefish having read such great reviews. We were not disappointed.   Loved this place! The fish wasn't fishy at all, cooked just right and the whipped potatoes were perfect. Garbanzo beans were the veggie of the evening, even those were delicious! Manhattan wasn't anything to write home about but the happy hour is pretty reasonable. Our server was josh I believe? He was knowledgeable, helpful and persuasive. He definitely made our evening enjoyable!  Happy hour ends at 630 I believe? But the entree options looked amazing, hubby and I chose the specials they had for the night. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place absolutely rocks!  I just found out that they are putting a Bonefish Grill on Charleston in Summerlin.  Of all the seafood restaurants in Las Vegas, I would say this is the best one.  The scallops are amazing and my favorite drink is their martini with a frozen watermelon cube.  The environment is also fun and the service is excellent."}
{"text":"The service was poor and unprofessional.  Management needs to train them how to talk to customers, if there are no bus staff, at least train the waiters how and when to remove dirty plates from a table,  cream and sugar needs to be served with coffee and tea, tablespoons are not teaspoons.  If the service was better, we might have enjoyed the mediocre food more."}
{"text":"do yourself a favor men of Yelp, take your wife or girlfriend to Bonefish. Order the Red Sangria to drink and the BangBang shrimp appetizer.  that combo is fantastic. Its my go to \"date night\" location to romance my wife :)"}
{"text":"I went with my friends for happy hour on Monday.  The food is great and the cocktail is amazing.  The only reason for 4-Star is because the bartender who took care of us first did not know how to make the drink correctly.  I can't remember which drink it was but I usually get the blood orange cocktail and it tasted different from before... The bartender clocked out and another came in and she made it correctly so I guess I will always ask her to make my drinks."}
{"text":"First time dining here on a quiet Sunday night, got seated immediately  but took a while to be greeted. Drinks took some time as well..The food was delicious. The bang bang shrimp was amazing and we really enjoyed our entrees..The crab crusted roughy and the shrimp and scallop dish that i ordered oscar style, but it didnt come with bernaise, not sure if it was supposed to or not but nice dish none the less. Would have order another cocktail had it been offered and we sat there with empty plates waiting for the check for a good while..Still a good meal and will return."}
{"text":"I have been to Bonefish in Florida and Chicago and the Madison Wi. Bonefish is just as interesting.  The creamy corn soup with lump crabmeat was delicious."}
{"text":"I love all of the Bonefish Grill locations. My favorite is believe it or not the steak. But others that I go with always order the seafood dishes and the bang bang shrimp is amazing and I do not eat any seafood at all and it is fabulous."}
{"text":"Food was terrible. Mealy and overcooked steak, burned fish. Service was awful. Our waiter was MIA most of the meal. We had to wait for drinks to be refilled or to request anything else we needed. We had reservations and waited around 20 minutes past the reservation time for a table. Never saw a manager and/or one never stopped by our table. I do not understand why the line is out the door for this place. I will never go back."}
{"text":"Horrible Service. We waited 55 minutes during a business lunch  to get our food. And they gave me the check!! Had to take it to go. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"We were and Bonefish for dinner in a Wednesday evening.  Walked in asked if we could sit outside, then jokingly asked for \"best\" server.  Hostess suggested Johnney, the other hostess gave a look and we got Bill. Was told he is awesome best server.  We were seated next to the door where the servers came in and out (other tables were open) he came out all attentive then............ nothing ordered a wine 20minutes later it came we could see the bar/server area everyone was running and doing their jobs no sign of Bill, did comp that!Never got out bread plates, no water refills, never asked if meals was ok. Worse service ever.   The next day I went for lunch had Alex perfect server. Attentive and we had no alcohol orders but he was a perfect server and was treated accordingly."}
{"text":"Bang bang shrimp!!!! If you go here, you have to try this popular appetizer! Love it! If you go on Wednesdays it is on special for $5.00!! Can't beat that.  I only go to this place if I want to enjoy some tasty fish. On my first visit here I got the Salmon. My second visit I got the Long-fin Tilapia. Both of them were good and very fresh. It is best to set a reservation for this place or you will wait for a while, especially on the weekends."}
{"text":"Food was great. Service a little slow.  Front door overwhelming with 5 hosts,managers and servers standing there - some with their backs to us... Never turn your back on the customer."}
{"text":"Although I really enjoy this place, my husband doesn't. The bang bang shrimp is so good. I can eat two servings on my own! ;) I've enjoyed every seafood dish I've ordered there - especially the sea bass. My husband has ordered filet almost every time and the last 2 times there was a large line of fat down the middle of the filet. Sent back and came back with the same problem. Not sure if they got a new butcher or what but s/he needs to remove that from a filet mingon, especially for that price. I convinced him to try the sea bass and although he's new to seafood he actually liked it. But the main reason he goes (besides taking me for my shrimp!) is the key lime pie martini (OMG so good) and the creme brûlée. We have to order 2 since he will eat a whole one by himself."}
{"text":"Terrible meal and service.  Had house favorite steak and crab cake. Either the steak was tough or the knife was too dull, could not eat. Brought to attention but nothing done. Never go back."}
{"text":"First time here was pretty awesome. Tried their famed bang bang shrimp, maryland crab cakes, kobe beef burger, and it was all excellent. Service was prompt and attentive.  So was looking forward to a second time. However, it was a letdown and makes me not want to rush back for a third time.  The bang bang shrimp themselves have no flavor, but that's what the sauce on it is for. The complimentary bread they offer is wonderful, especially when freshly baked and warm. Even better with some balsamic vinegar in the olive oil. Most of the appetizers and entrees seem about $1-3 overpriced.   Our server was adequate, but no real enthusiasm. During the time we went, there must have been an issue with the grills or the kitchen itself because for about 40 minutes, no entrees seemed to be coming out of the kitchen. The surrounding tables were all waiting for food as well. Things happen, which is understandable. However, our server never kept us updated or apologized for the long wait. Between the time our appetizer of bang bang shrimp and wagyu beef potstickers and our actual entrees was close to 50 minutes.  But again, the whole time there was not a peep from our server or communication as to why food was taking so long to arrive.  Just felt like they didn't care at all how long we had to wait for food. So not exactly jumping at the chance to return."}
{"text":"I really like this place. Service is good & food is great. We've been for dinner & brunch. What a unique place for brunch! Excellent selection. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"PLEASE THINK TWICE BEFORE GOING TO THIS LOW QUALITY RESTAURANT.  DO NOT BE FOOLED BY ITS SOMEWHAT STYLISH APPEARANCE.    BIG WADS OF THICK, DISGUSTING GREASE SOAKED BREADING WITH A TINY PIECE OF SOFT, MUSHY OVERCOOKED FISH INSIDE AND PLOPPED ON TOP OF A FEW FROZEN FRENCH FRIES WHICH WERE MADE LIMP BY THE \"RUNOFF\" FROM THE FISH.  THE FOOD IS ABSOLUTELY NOT GOOD.  WE SHOULD HAVE EATEN AT THE NEARBY WENDY'S.  $38 FOR ONE ENTREE, ONE BEER, AND ONE GLASS OF WINE.    My son had eaten there once and told me it wasn't worth the bother, but we were inside and seated before I remembered his assessment.  I returned food to the kitchen that our waitress said she would not eat if it were her after  she had recommended it when we ordered our lunch.   It was around noon, and the place was mostly empty.    The hostess was clueless.  We are an older, well dressed couple, and were walked through the entire dining room full of empty tables only to be seated near the kitchen and next to a large group of people having a business lunch. Then, later, the table behind us was seated with another business group where one diner, we noticed, sent his food back to the kitchen also.  At no time did a manager come by either table to ask what was wrong with the food or to apologize.    I know this is a very negative review, but there are SYSTEMIC problems with this place.  Marginal service, staff poorly trained, nearly empty at noon on a weekday with their few customers bunched near the kitchen, and simply pathetic food."}
{"text":"I'd give this 4 stars except for the customer service.  First the food was fine.  Grilled trout with mango sauce matched up well and we treated ourselves to the scalloped potatoes which were way rich but good.  Crab cakes appetizer were moist and tasty.  Decent wine list also.  The only problems were they tried to seat us next to the kitchen (noisy, busy) when the place was half full.  Also the waitress spilled a glass on red wine on my colleague and all over the table and didn't offer to move us.  We understand that Stuff happens but she didn't even comp us the wine.  Bad move.  So wear a rain slicker and enjoy a good meal if somewhat overpriced."}
{"text":"This is our family's go-to restaurant for seafood. We love the fresh seafood here. The bang bang shrimp are a must for an appetizer. Incredible flavor! (Check these out on Wednesday because they are usually half price before 6 pm.) Our favorite entrée has to the crab cakes with their creamy, garlic mashed potatoes. Ask for a side of their lemon butter sauce for your crab cakes. It's delicious and I enjoy it more than an aioli. Mmm..... As a girl who grew up going to the original Bonefish in FL, this place brings the same quality and fresh, delicious seafood as the original. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"When we arrived around 6:00 it was rather full yet there were still open tables. Regardless, we were told there was a wait. After being told it would be 25 minutes we decided to sit at the tabletops they have near the entrance. There were very few people working and it took about 10 minutes just to get our drink order. After ordering some appetizers, we waited around 25 minutes for those. After finally getting the waitress to come take our order, it took until 7:40 (and yes I checked) to get our food. The food was nowhere near what we expected for the price. The shrimp we ordered had an off taste and a weird texture leading us to believe it may have been old. I will not come back."}
{"text":"OK ate here a few years ago and it was absolutely fantastic flew into Vegas and was hoping to relive that.  I have also eaten add a bonefish Grill in Florida which was actually pretty good!  In Las Vegas as you know there are many many choices and good restaurants to go to and I choose the bonefish Grill, sadly it was a complete mistake!!!  When we first walked through the door there was The strong odor of fish and it wasn't a good odor!  We had made a reservation and I was really surprised at how few people there were at the restaurant even during the hour we were there  Appetizers came first calamari and the mussels. The calamari was excellent but the muscles had somewhat of a fishy taste and yes I know it's seafood but I get muscles all the time that don't taste like this. In spite of it we ate the mussels but not all of them.  It was Friday so we specifically came here for Fish being a Catholic family and it being Lent. I opted for the crab crusted cod with green beans and potatoes au gratin.  My wife had the Rockefeller cobia with potatoes and broccoli.  She said her fish was decent,  she wasn't thrilled with the broccoli and the potatoes tasted like they came out of a box.  the crab crusted Alaskan cod had zero taste it was extremely bland I ended up having to get some of the dipping sauce from the calamari to pour on it  I originally ordered an iced tea and my wife ordered a cocktail her cocktail came out one before my ice tea when I finish my tea I had to ask two different people one of them twice for an iced tea. I also asked for better for my Green Bay which they immediately forgot. When I finally did get the butter which was after I decided to eat no more of the cod or the potatoes I could barely cut the green beans with a butter knife they provided in the green beans were hard and crunchy  The only two things good about the meal with the calamari and my wife's cocktails.  I have to say I don't intend to ever come back and I hope they never opened one in Southern California!"}
{"text":"After reading some of the mixed reviews on this place, I took a chance and set up reservations for valentine's day thinking they may have polished some of the rough edges after being open for a month.  Unfortunately, they remained true to the poor service reviews others have given. We were promptly seated at 8:15 pm after having made reservations 2 weeks in advance, but their website reservation tool, did not confirm the reservation like it said it did, so I was glad that I called days ahead as I had to switch it to 4 people anyway.  When we arrived, we did get seated promptly, which I was pleased with. We ordered drinks and appetizers, however, the delivery of a moscow mule took a good 15 minutes before getting the drink or someone to acknowledge that it hadn't arrived yet.  We ordered appetizers along with the drinks, which I will say the bang bang shrimp and the Ahi street tacos were very good.   Although it was accompanied with a spilling of a glass of water.  All this could have been avoided had 2 of the other servers not crowd our waiter while trying to refill our drinks, which seemed a little unorganized. Dinner was unfortunate, as both my brother and I both ordered the large portion of the Chilean SeaBass and when it came out, mine seemed to be half the size, which is a little disappointing when you're paying almost 30 bucks a plate.  My wife didn't fare well either as her order for the steak was not correct and before serving it the waiter corrected the staff serving it and they took it back promptly.  However, it came back out just as promptly with carbon-like charring meaning it was well past overdone.  While the waiter was more than understanding, he asked for back-up from the manager on this one, which I would have hoped would be an open discussion for improvement in the future.  Unlikely, the first manager that was supposed to come over didn't show up, then the waiter had to ask the female manager to come by our table.  Mind you, this is after everyone had finished eating and all plates returned (my wife's meal untouched as we were waiting for manager to appear and past the point of ordering something else).  The female manager arrived in a somewhat snarky fashion, and asked us what problem we had with dinner.  Don't get me wrong, it's a simple straightforward question, but don't assume that when someone returns an order, that it's necessarily the patron that is having the issue with something or rather are in the mood to recant at what point in the evening they were let down.  We didn't ask for the manager, but when you are asked to speak with one, it probably makes sense for the manager to get some background from their staff before approaching a table.  Upon explaining the fact that the meal was inedible, the response back is, \"and that's it?\"  Well, now I'm prompted to explain all the events of the evening which only emphasizes what a bad choice I made going there.   The manager was grateful enough to remove my wife's order from the bill, which I thanked her for since it wasn't even eaten after the first bite.  Overview: Overpriced for the petite portions served. Inconsistent portions among plates Poor Service"}
{"text":"Good SEAfood, reasonable prices.  Good selection of entrees, even have burgers, steak etc for non fish eaters.  Do try their KEYLIME pie.  They make it from scratch and it's really good; much better than the pre-made stuff you get at other places.  Good service, and they didn't keep us waiting.  Manager, Rhonda, checked in with us; friendly, helpful person."}
{"text":"Had such an amazing time !  Good food great  atmosphere and the staff was on point ! The bang bang shrimp was so delicious   I recommend this place ! Keep up the good work bonefish !"}
{"text":"We went here many times. Every time the dinner was perfect. Last week we went with grandma and grandpa and it was awesome. The rainbow trout is excellent and the keylime pie is delicious.   We wish they would start to take reservations online."}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised at the excellent service and delicious food after reading mediocre reviews. Trout with mango salsa and spaghetti squash was delicious. Snapper with green beans excellent. No music at all. I would definitely come again."}
{"text":"My wife and I  went to dinner at the bonefish grill in independence Ohio. Received an over cooked steak as part of our filet scampi order. The waiter Dwayne offered to replace the entire meal, scampis  and all. The waiter also offered to box up the wrong order for our dog and gave us a complimentary dessert. We were so impressed with the service recovery. And not to mention, the appetizer and my wife's meal were excellent. all of the food was excellent.  The manager Dave also contributed to the service recovery. He was aware of the order mishap and stopped by our table to inquire about the mistake and how the server fixed it. Nice job bonefish grill."}
{"text":"This place is awful! I would rate it as a seafood \"Denny's\" The calamari chewy and  greasy. The Bass was undercooked, the spaghetti squash was overcooked and like a heap of mush that was served with the bass. I would not recommend this place. The service was also terrible the servers never have eye contact when they are taking your order too busy putting your order in on a iPad. Hopefully they will get it together. Unfortunately I nor my family will ever return..."}
{"text":"This place has quickly become our go to place for special occasions as well as when we need a fish fix.  We've been to this location 4 times and each time was just as good as the last.  We have never had to wait to be seated, drink orders were brought out and refilled quickly, and the food is sensational!  We always have to get the Bang Bang Shrimp when we go and I LOVED the swordfish with pumpkin ravioli (I crave this regularly).  I have also had the Ahi Tokyo style and devoured it!  My husband enjoys their Sir Will's Fish and Chips for lunch which is very tasty.  I'm going to ask him to go tomorrow. hahaha ^_^"}
{"text":"I don't normally write reviews let alone bad ones but other users deserve to know how fast bonefish has deteriorated recently. We had been there just a few weeks before around 3pm and though they had plenty of open tables they told us that there would be a 15-20 min wait. We instead sat at the bar and though food was good, we still felt it very odd on comment of not being able to sit in the dining area as it stayed 1/2 busy throughout our time there  Yesterday we attempted again to eat there, this time calling two days ahead to get reservation for Sunday dinner  Again my wife was informed that they were booked solid and the only time available was 3pm, which we agreed to. We brought our in laws as well this time as they haven't been there yet, and again first thing I noticed were many open tables, no one else in line waiting to be seated and the hostess not knowing where to put us. It gets worse from there.  In the first 30 minutes of being seated we witnessed the table to our right, left, and behind us complain to either the waitress or manager of their service and food. Since we had guests we kept up our optimism of our experience not being the same, but they had the same wait staff as we did and I already noticed how long it was taking just to get water and we were never asked if we wished any drinks, and our appetizers were taking long getting out to us We did get the appetizers eventually and I decided to stick it out since we ordered our main course 10 minutes earlier and they would come out soon, again my mistake. 45 minutes later as we watched other tables seated after us eating their meals and almost done we asked where our dinner was. The waitress came out with three of them and stated the kitchen ran out of the green beans and replaced them with broccoli. I was amazed and informed her that my wife and I are unable to eat broccoli and need to speak to the manager. The man that came over looked haggard and unkept, seen managers in McDonald's with more professional appearances. He apologized profusely, just as he had with that table to our left earlier and said the meal was on the house. I accepted his offer of paying for our appetizers but told him I did not trust that they would get our meal right and we instead will be leaving to seek another restaurant.   Note - During this entire wait I saw even more tables open up, with ones becoming empty never being replaced with new customers, so there was no way they were booked solid. This is just very very poor management and training of their people.  Bonefish is a great franchise but whomever the owner of this establishment is giving it a very bad rep.   One bright spot will be that parking will become more prevalent for shoppers due to drop of attendance to bonefish!"}
{"text":"Bonefish was delicious! The fresh bread that they bring out to begin with was nice and warm. I had the Florida Cobb Salad, I would definitely recommend this. My husband had the mahi mahi which I took a bite of and it was wonderful! Next time I will definitely get some of the fresh fish. Only downfall is if you aren't a big fan of fish the menu is kind of limited but what do you expect going to a seafood restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been to several Bonefish's around the country and this one by far had the best food and the service (Nina) was excellent. I did not know they had a rewards program and just signed up for it."}
{"text":"We just walked into this location of Bonefish.   Bartender: Do you need a menu? Me: No, I'm looking for scotch.  2 minutes later... Bartender: Did you decide yet? Me: I was hoping you could tell me what kind of scotch you had. Bartender: (eye roll) I'll get the other bartender.  Me: Bye. We will never be back.   I love attitude from bartenders that don't know how to do their job.   This Bonefish is awful. Poor management. Our 2nd negative experience here."}
{"text":"Not worth the money anymore.  Order was wrong, shrimp were chewy, Bang Bang didn't have much sauce and they were out of items on daily special menu at 5:30.  There was a time when Bonefish was a nice night out you could count on...now it is 50/50."}
{"text":"2nd visit tonight.  I'm still trying to figure out why so many people are raving about this place.  I suppose I must be ordering the wrong menu items. I do have to give them props for promptness now, though.  Our food came out 13 minutes after we ordered.  Also, we made a reservation, and despite the place being packed, we were seated within 10 minutes. I had the shrimp pad thai.  Meh.  Only about 6 rather small, tasteless shrimp, and a TON of rice noodles.  No peanuts, either, as per the menu.  I guess they ran out of peanuts. Wife had the lobster tail; she said it was good. We shared the coconut pie for dessert.  Honestly, I'd rather have a slice of coconut cream pie at Eat 'N Park. Had to track down the waiter to get a drink refill. It was interesting to note, as we were sitting there, we had TWO passerby customers offer us their extra $10 off coupons.  Does everyone in this place have a coupon? Plan to give them a 3rd try.  I'll order yet something different. To anyone who thinks their Bang Bang Shrimp is the greatest thing since sliced bread, here's a tip:  make your own at home.  Go to Wholey's and get yourself a bag of GOOD shrimp, then find the copycat recipe online.  A lot cheaper and a WHOLE lot better.  I have ordered shrimp dishes on both of my visits here, and my personal opinion is the quality of the shrimp could be a LOT better."}
{"text":"Just went here for dinner the other night and it was great. The staff seems to really be on their feet and never sitting around. Food was absolutely excellent! Beer was ice cold down to the last sip. Salad was fresh and steak and shrimp were cooked perfectly to my liking. The paper table mats are a bit tacky but didn't bother me. Atmosphere was nice and a feeling of privacy."}
{"text":"I used to really enjoy this restaurant, but it has gone seriously down hill over last year or so.  Would not even consider going back, food and service both terrible latley, management doesnt even care or try to act concerned about issues"}
{"text":"Best crab cake that i know of and the bang bang shrimp is not far behind. Seafood choices are pretty good and delicious! I'm happy i can taste close to fresh seafood here in Matthews but the prices are pretty high so i cant go as often as i want."}
{"text":"We have dined a this Bonefish location three times since it opened.  We like their menu items and that they are and Outback owned company so we didn't want our first impression of the staff to deter us from coming back.  We have been back 2 times since and have been very displeased with the service staff each time.  They are slow, incompetent, and inattentive.  The only reason they got 2 stars instead of 1 is because their Bang Bang Shrimp has been excellent every time."}
{"text":"I love fish, but my husband is a vegetarian.  This place is very hard for us to enjoy together.  There are no vegetarian entrees other than a plain salad.  There are a few vegetarian side dishes, but if you order them on their own, the restaurant charges you much more than if they were a side dish to a meal, yet the serving size is the same.  We would gladly pay more for an entrée size of one of the appetizers.  But being charged extra when no other vegetarian entree's are offered, is insulting.  My meals there have been good for the most part.  Although the last time I went I had a tuna steak that was way overdone which made it dry and tough.  I really liked their crab chowder though.  Unfortunately, I probably will not go back again unless they add a few vegetarian dishes to the menu as I usually dine with my husband."}
{"text":"This was my first time at the McCandless location.  For being a chain, ambience was nice.  We stopped for an early dinner on a Sunday, at about 4:00 so the place was not crowded and we were seated promptly.    Now I know everyone is in a hurry these days, so call me crazy, but I'm one of those people that likes to take my time when dining out.  It's an enjoyable experience for me.  I hate to be rushed, especially if I'm paying decent money for a meal.  From the second we sat down, I felt we were being rushed out the door.  Mind you, it was early...it's not like they needed to turn the table quickly or that the server was missing out on additional tips...there were still empty tables when we left.  I'll also add that if I'm taking my time I tip well to compensate for holding up turning a table.    They have a nice list of wines, beer and specialty martinis and other drinks.   I had time to read about 2 descriptions of drinks when the waitress (I'll call her Speedy) asked what we wanted, and we sent her away saying we needed a minute to decide.  I get it...some people get the same thing everywhere they go and know exactly what they want...I like to try new things so more than 30 seconds to browse the drinks would've been great.  She came back to get our drink order - the espresso martini was great - and at the same time she asked about an appetizer.  Ok, clearly we had looked at drinks only so far.  So we sent her away again to put the drink order in while we decided on an app.    They push the Bang Bang Shrimp.  I get it, people like it.  Speedy said 9 out of 10 tables order it!  Alright!  But popcorn shrimp drowned in a mayo/hot sauce mixture doesn't do it for me.  So I'm a rebel, what can I say.  Went with calamari.  Mostly very good, light breading, not greasy, the larger pieces were a bit rubbery.  Loved that they breaded the strips of peppers that came with it.    Of course when she took the app order she also asked if we were ready to place our dinner order...ok, again, we just looked at apps...didn't look at dinner options yet.  Sent her on her merry way again.  We will give you our dinner order when you bring our app, Speedy.    Ordered the special day boat scallops over corn risotto with green beans.  The scallops were cooked to perfection, tender and flavorful.  The risotto was good but needed just a little more seasoning.  Green beans were good, presentation was nice.  My dinner mate ordered the walleye which she said was very good and fresh.    We were disappointed when we were done eating and we heard Speedy offer the table behind us bread and dipping oil....we were offered none.    5 stars would've been given, as we enjoyed the food and drink, but the rushing me out the door gets under my skin.  This is not the only place it happens, and it especially happens at chains.  I wish servers would try to get a feel for the type of dining experience people are looking for...maybe asking a question as simple as \"are you in a hurry tonight?\""}
{"text":"The bang bang shrimp are to die for.  The house wine selections are not.  Please add a Pinot Grigio or a Sauvignon Blanc to the whites list."}
{"text":"Service - My drink was never empty, but that's about the only good thing I can say.  Despite the restaurant being very empty, for some reason I did not get my food until a couple minutes after the rest of our table.  My friend ordered fish and chips with vinegar but the vinegar did not come out with the food, and the waitress did not check on us so he was stuck nibbling on fries for 5 minutes until he could flag her down.  Food - I ordered the rockfish with a pesto sauce on it, and broccoli as the side.  The fish was slightly larger than a goldfish, and came with 5 or 6 small broccoli florets.  The portions were definitely too small and most of my plate was empty.  Normally I couldn't care less about presentation but a plate that was 75% empty space really left me wanting more.  The broccoli was delicious, but that's the only part I enjoyed.  If I had boiled a piece of chicken breast in plain water it would've had more flavor than their rockfish.  I don't plan on going back.  The place isn't horrible or disgusting, but it's not the cheapest and since it is in Town Square it is surrounded by a half dozen places I would prefer to eat at next time."}
{"text":"The food is great! Service with a smile, and they know their menu-I lost my keys, they had to be hidden in the very back of a booth, and their cleaning crew found the, so I know it must be clean!"}
{"text":"Once again a good call adding this spot for an after movie feast. Blackberry Sangria, Bang Bang Shrimp and Coconut Shrimp, followed by a Cobb Salad. Holly"}
{"text":"I ordered two Tito vodka presses and upon receiving my bill saw I was charged $17.50 for each drink. I asked my waiter if that was correct to which he said yes. I thought that was odd but moved on. My next visit I asked my waiter what it costs for a Tito vodka press and he said $7.50. So that's that, I shrugged it off. Upon receiving the bill for that dinner I saw that I was charged the $7.00 for my friends oysters that she very clearly had ordered for herself. I have now wasted $27 at this restaurant. The level of incompetency is overwhelming."}
{"text":"Let down...  we use to go here regularly when we lived near one.  When we were traveling and had opportunity to go, we were quite pleased.   our visit was on a Tuesday.  Sadly, we were disappointed.  Our server was nice but inattentive.  We had to fill our kids water cups with our water because he never asked how theirs were.  I even went to hand him one but he left.  Our food was the low point.....barely warm.  It must have sat in the take out window forever.  He didn't bother to ask.   We next saw him with the check.   For your money, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great Sunday brunch. I recommend the French toast and yummy bacon. My husband had the Oscar omelette, which he enjoyed. Friendly and attentive server. It was busy because it's Easter Sunday. Reservations helped."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant in another state and fell in love. I had the same expectations here but it's never quite as good. I usually order salmon or ahi tuna with some appetizers to start with and my food is always wonderful but they never cook my husband's steak well enough. He orders medium well every time and it comes out almost rare. I don't know what's going on with that but the seafood is wonderful."}
{"text":"This is the 2nd time I've eaten brunch here and it feels like the same pattern. The hostess was friendly and chatted with us as we walked to the table. Then everything goes downhill. Waitress smiled when she came to the table. But then we declined the \"ultimate bubbles\"   After that we were treated like we should have been sitting in steerage.  I finished my first cup of coffee and when I received my food I asked for a refill. I was told that they were brewing a fresh pot. 10 minutes later she came back and said that she did not forget about me. But they were still brewing a fresh pot. I wanted to ask why she was able to serve 2 tables around me coffee. Or why I can brew a pot of coffee at home in 5 minutes but it takes a restaurant 20.  I watched manager boy talk (and actually sit down and chat) with several tables. Mostly with 20 some things. I guess a 50 year old guy isn't the demographic they are looking for.  The 3 stars is for the food not the service"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Bonefish Grill (party of two). We visited early evening (Sunday) & there was no wait. There were quite a number of empty tables. I'm not big \"seafood person,\" nevertheless we ordered the salmon & rainbow trout entrees. We really enjoyed our meals. I cannot rate whether seafood meals were reasonably priced as I don't frequent seafood restaurants that often. Here are a couple of issues: The inside of restaurant & restroom were too dark (need more lighting); its not that accessible to disabled individuals; we never received any bread to complement our meals, which Im sure is included in the price of the meal (as previously mentioned, this was our first time at this restaurant); the server just seemed to be there, well most of the time she was m.i.a., and had a disposition for not really being there to do a good to great job, at least not at our table for two; & for it to be a slow evening, our order took a while to arrive at our table --- more than 15 minutes and keep in mind, we did not order appetizers."}
{"text":"they would have got 6 stars but the waitress gave me a glass with lipstick on it! Great food and drinks !"}
{"text":"My first experience at Bonefish Grill was at their Concord Mills location.  My husband raved about the TiIapia Imperial so much that we decided to visit Bonefish again for Father's Day at the Pineville- Matthews location.  Big mistake!  It was not as good.  The sides were of smaller portion.  I ordered the steak (again) and the flavor and cut was less than average.  We did give this feedback to the manager when he asked about our meal.  His response was, \"he would contact the manager in Concord to see what they are doing different\"...... Hum, good luck with that.  I won't re-visit."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. Went here for dinner and was extremely disappointed. The vegetables we ate had a peice of plastic in them... When we asked our server about it they apologized and mentioned that all of the vegetables are MICROWAVED in PLASTIC BAGS so that is probably how the plastic peice got there. Horrific.   What type of restaurant microwaves veggies in plastic bags? That is just so utterly disgusting- I would never microwave anything in plastic and then eat it but to pay a restaraunt to do so for me? NO THANKS.  The supposedly amazing bang bang shrimp is really bad- its just the sauce on it is so tasty it tricks your brain into thinking its good. The actual quality of the shrimp itself is like you chewing on a peice of rubber.   Corporate restaraunts all suck."}
{"text":"Our favorite restaurant in Charlotte.  Not only is the food inventive and the wine excellent, but the service staff have always proved to be helpful and knowledgeable. We have always enjoyed our experience a great deal.  Try the creme brulee for dessert.  Wonderful!"}
{"text":"I have had great meals at other 'BONEFISH GRILLS', but this restaurant seems to be poorly managed. The staff was the most unprofessional I have experienced for a restaurant of this stature in many years. We dined at the community tables in the bar. The 'noise' from the bar staff, talking to each other, over our conversations, from many feet away, completed the feel of a cafeteria atmosphere. It appeared the dining room tables did not suffer this as badly. I hope management reads this and understands that it is not a hard fix, but a necessary one. Food was worthy!!"}
{"text":"Bonefish Grill has a lot of potential it doesn't tap in to. It has a good location on the west side of Madison and a good exterior/interior appearance. However, each time I visit it gets close to impressing and then fails to do so. We dined at Bonefish this past Saturday evening. Once we were seated it was immediately noticeable that the music was far too loud. Not only was the music far too loud, but it was also Techno music. Given the restaurant's clientele I don't think their music volume and music choice is the best idea. Most of the diners were middle aged, some with children in tow. For being a Saturday evening, the restaurant was half empty. Perhaps, that is reflection of the fact that the restaurant is just ok for the price you pay. Our waitress was friendly. When the lobster tails we ordered arrived, they were served without melted butter. After finally flagging down an employee to inquire about the butter, she stated the kitchen had been out and was making more and implied we should have known that already. Strange.  My Moscow mule was tasty. The bread and olive oil dipping sauce was also good. Once the butter arrived the lobster didn't disappoint. However, I find that their sides are lackluster. They are just ok, nothing to write home about.  For dessert we tried the homemade donuts with whipped cream and salted caramel sauce and they were by far the best item of the evening.  In summary, I recommend if Bonefish wants to retain and gain new diners they should turn down the music, select more dining appropriate music and amp up their entrée sides. This would ensure the dining experience you get is more in line with the prices they charge."}
{"text":"The Bonefish Grill at Town Square is a second attempt at bringing this franchise to the Las Vegas area. Despite its attempt at a revival, the food here is mediocre at best. Their signature cocktails that we ordered were either too sweet or tasted weird. I had heard that the Bang Bang Shrimp was its signature dish, so it was a must-try during my meal there. Unfortunately, it fell short of my expectations. The rest of our food was executed satisfactorily but overall, I'd rather take my business to a local oyster bar or even Red Lobster."}
{"text":"We have been here a couple of times. The first time we had a wonderful time. We both had the NY Strip Steak with trimmings and it was perfect. The waiter was wonderful as well. The second time we came with a purpose which was to see if their Waygu Beef burger was as good as a competitors . The manager had met us at the door and the conversation just lead to the reason for our visit which, of course, he stated that, \"Our's is the best hands down\" which I replied, \"That will be up to us to decide\". What a set-up. We both ordered ours well done with no pink and no bacon. What came to the table was  all but dripping with pink to red juices and two slabs of bacon on them. We were appalled. The waiter quickly came and removed our plates and after what seemed to be 30 minutes we received new food on new plates cooked to our original preferences. All's well that ends well. We will come back again with high hopes that they will do better. Still, they are still good enough to receive 4 stars as one incident doesn't deserve to take away from the overall. They are still a real classy place with great food and service. When they get it right.  ;-)"}
{"text":"Went to this place to celebrate an early Valentine Day with another couple.  We'd never been to this location but loved the food at other Bonefish Grills. The service was horrible-almost non-existent.  It took forever to even get water;  the drinks (ice tea) was even wrong; refills had to be asked for-and the wait was very long for refills; I ordered a salad which was not served with the other salads; we would look for our waiter to ask him something and he was nowhere to be found; my wife's lobster was served without melted bbutter. When the waiter finally brought it the butter was not melted and the lobster was cold; and the desert was described by our waiter that it was topped with raspberries and fresh whipped cream.  It was served with strawberries and no whipped cream!  We asked and were told they'd run out of whipped cream!   They should've told us prior to serving it in my opinion. We complained to the manager who adjusted the bill but this place better shape up  or it will not survive in my opinion"}
{"text":"Delicious. Can't wait to come back here. We had the bang bang shrimp as an appetizer, i had the filet and veggies which were delicious. And for dessert the brownie, which was okay."}
{"text":"I took my husband here to celebrate his new job and had my eye on the place since it opened. Very classy and worth the wait. We waited about an hour, but given their cozy patio waiting area it wasn't unpleasant. My husband and I both enjoyed our warm bread and pesto appetizer which the server offered to us while we looked at the drink menu. I definitely recommend the blackberry elixir which is non alcoholic and delicious. A wonderful blend of coconut water seltzer water lime juice and fresh blackberries tasted refreshing on a 80 degree day. My hubby had the Thai iced tea which to me tasted like a iced chai tea. For dinner I had the   Seared ahi tuna Tokyo style, which was basically the dinner portion of their ahi tuna appetizer. It was served with sweet rice and sautéed veggies alongside with some sir racha and a flavorful soy sauce, wasabi and ginger. I definitely recommend this dish if you are into sushi or like ahi tuna, it was full of flavor. My hubby had the fish tacos and said they were delicious as well. We ate outdoors, but ventured inside briefly. Very nice ambiance inside and staff was very good with time and very helpful when we asked questions. As far as price goes, entrees are on par with somewhere like Atrias. I was expecting a $50 dinner after we ordered all we did, and given the feel and look of the place and was surprised to see our bill was only about $35 for the both of us. Overall, loved this Restaraunt and will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I love going to The Bonefish Grill. It has such a wide variety menu. Not only do they have fresh seafood but also steaks, burgers, pork chops, and tacos. You can get an upscale meal as well as something as simple as a burger. Every time I go the wait staff is so accommodating and their fresh bread and pesto is my favorite! I like going for $5 martini Monday. As well as $6 bang bang shrimp Wednesday. If it's your anniversary you get a champagne toast. A birthday and you get a free dessert. They make special occasions special. The ambiance is both casual yet can be a great venue to get dressed up and celebrate a something or someone special. Right in the middle of McCandless crossing I love stopping by for lunch or dinner after I'm shopping or running some errands!"}
{"text":"I dined at Bonefish Grill last night for the first time and wow was I impressed! I have always seen this restaurant located in Town Square but never went inside. I feel that I have been missing out. The atmosphere of the restaurant is excellent and very comfortable. Drink prices are great! Not too expensive. And the food was spectacular. Our server Annie in the bar area was outstanding. She is truly the reason why we have such a great time. She was friendly, outgoing, knowledgable and gave great reccommendations. She recommended the Bang Bang Shrimp to us and I instantly fell in love. She also did a great job of recommending a good sauce for my Samon that I ordered. I will definitlely return to Bonefish Grill!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a restaurant with some really great food. It is one of Outback Steakhouse's concepts (I know this because I used to work for Outback). They pride themselves on quality. The corn chowder with lobster on top was probably the best soup I've had. The filet was cooked just perfect. I had lobster meat on top which was good also. The Ahi tuna appetizer was soooo delicious! It melted in my mouth, but had a great peppery seared crusty outside. Flash seared to keep it rare. Made to perfection. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because our drinks, although presented very nicely, tasted like Kool Aid...pretty much no alcohol-and for $9 a drink, I would like to taste my liquor lol! Service was a little slower than if prefer, but since I know the ways of the concept, this place likes to space out their times between courses to let you soak in all the flavors...and order more drinks, which we switched to wine. Can't go wrong there :-). They take reservations, which I suggest on a weekend of course, as they are pretty busy then. They also have outdoor seating, which I always prefer on nights like this. It was the Fourth of July of course! And from this location...bonus...you can see Upper St. Clair's fireworks from the outdoor seating area!!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the service but that was it I ordered a filet mignon with Applewood bacon, mushrooms and cherry tomatoes  It was ill concocted  The steak was medium rare as requested but was as tough as a standard sirloin. It was ridiculously flavorless. A couple chips of bacon were in the sauce And there was none of it the flavors weren't balanced and an element of sugar or fat was missin. The couscous salad was the same could of been good but four flavors thrown in a bowl that didn't compliment each other. The sweet tea was full of sugar which is great unfortunately no tea was present just water, sugar water. The food took 45 mins to hit the table with an apology after 30mins but no comps or bill reduction. After I finished i was very hungry this was also a lunch portion. I wasn't going to give them a chance to burn me on dessert. My son had chicken fingers and fries they looked good and he liked them. My other guest had the lunch salmon entree and he said it was excellent."}
{"text":"Had a great meal at the Bonefish Grill last night, our first time dining here. The restaurant is fairly small, and gets crowded on a weekend night. We had a 40 minute wait, but with a couple of beers at the bar, it passed quickly. Their draft selection of beers seems limited, with only 4 being available.   Jessie, our waitress, took great care of us and service was fast. They were running a non-RW affiliated special, four courses (appetizer, salad, entree, dessert) for $30. We chose to go this route, even though the famous Bang Bang Shrimp wasn't listed as an available appetizer. (Jessie told us it was on special on Wednesdays for $5 so we might come back then to try it.)  The food was very, very good. We loved the Wagyu Beef wontons. The Cesar salad was tasty, but a little too ice cold for my liking - it was hard to get any real flavor from it. I ordered the special filet, and my husband ordered the Ahi tuna, which arrived perfectly seared and rare on the inside.   Based on our great experience, we will definitely return."}
{"text":"Great food, service and setting.   You are sure to repeat the experience each time.  Went to many locations, this one is like all the others."}
{"text":"Lets brake it down: SERVICE - was decent, but the server was not knowledgeable of their limited wine list. (seriously, it was only like 10 wines). APPETIZERS - the bang bang shrimp was the savior of the night. The best thing overall. MAIN COURSE - The presentation was LAZY. I felt like I was at a high school cafeteria. The taste of the grilled fish and the crab cakes was good, but not exceptional.  Besides that, the ambience is cozy and welcoming; and the food was served at a leisurely pace."}
{"text":"I can't speak for everything, but I can give 4 stars to the service and Bang Bang Shrimp.  Service was quick and helpful.  The Bang Bang Shrimp was very tasty adding an element of spicy I think I detected a slight sweet taste for a tasty combination.  I'll try more options on my next visit.  Non appetite"}
{"text":"The line out of the door at 5 pm is for a reason. This is the newest restaurant to open in McCandless Crossing and in my opinion, is the best dining option in this area. Although they were busy and there was a wait for seating, we were able to be seated reasonably early at what is referred to as \"community seating\", which are open tables beside the bar that you share with others while enjoying drinks and appetizers while waiting for a regular table. We decided to stay and have our meal here. Every staff member I came in contact with was friendly and smiled. EVERY staff member. That, to me, is huge and unfortunately rare anymore but it makes a very big impression. We enjoyed the bang bang shrimp and calamari as appetizers. Both were cooked to perfection and served hot. The fish tacos were my favorite and all of the ingredients were fresh and tasty. Although full, dessert was reluctantly ordered. Oh my, flourless macadamia nut brownie with vanilla ice cream, this dessert was worth the gorge! We will definitely be back but will probably try a reservation next time."}
{"text":"The service was awful!  A \"drop and run\" mentality of service.  The food was mediocre.  I expected far more from this establishment.  I won't return."}
{"text":"What can I say?!?!? EXCELLENT service, and GREAT food! I ate the Bang Bang shrimp tacos.... Very good to be my first.I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at a verity of Bonefish locations and the Huntersville restaurant is the worst!  They even screwed up the Bang Bang shrimp. Find a different Bonefish."}
{"text":"Horrible!  We ate there tonight and I would say for the price it was the worst meal I have had in Charlotte. The place was practically empty and it took almost an hour to get our food. Two of us had the grouper shrimp special which was overcooked and rubbery. Also the shrimp was cold. It was not very plentiful for the price. Our son ordered a hamburger medium that was totally rare, cold on the inside and also rubbery. So was the chicken on the salad. The quality of the meat and seafood was an F for sure.    What was good was our waiter, the bread, and the bang bang shrimp."}
{"text":"Reasonable lunch price good service.  Ordered apps and it was good but app was more expensive than lunch.   Service was good. Friendly and engaging."}
{"text":"It's a chain restaurant so the consistency is there. Service is above average. The Bang Bang Shrimp is overrated though."}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service. Went to this location for brunch for the first time. The service was great and the food was amazing. I definitely liked the fact that this location wasn't as crowded as the huntersville location. I'll be back in the future!"}
{"text":"What a terrible experience. I sat there for 20 minutes on Saturday 2/10/18 and wasn't even greeted. No server came up or anything. I had to walk out and eat somewhere else. Never coming back."}
{"text":"Ordered the ceviche ( needed salt and a jalapeño or something.) The fish and chips was boring. The truffle Mac and cheese was ok. Tried the  fried calamari and that too was average.  Had the 6 piece  oyster Rockefeller and it was probably the best thing I ate that night. Our waitress was very attentive and polite/ friendly. Food came out very quick so thats always a good thing. All and all I don't think anything stood out that would have me coming back, but I will. I have to try it 2/3 times before I decide to take it off my list of possible dinning options."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped by for lunch and were surprised that Bonefish Grill seemed to get their prices in line.  We were both impressed with our choices.  My wife had the red pepper soup and I started with the lump crab corn chowder soup.  Both of us finished quick and I had to restrain myself from licking the bowl.  We each had sandwiches that were excellent.  We each had the shrimp po'boy and would have them again.  I had a Cajun po'boy a few days earlier at a different restaurant that had better spice, but the sauce on the sandwich gave this one a kick.  Overall we were impressed and will go back for lunch soon."}
{"text":"Blackberry Sangria is sinful especially Sunday Brunch they're endless with entree $19.99 :)"}
{"text":"We went to bonefish to try their special tuesdays. Food was good but the server was very rude. He only sounded nice when he was dropping the check off so that he can good tip. But we gave him good tip anyways."}
{"text":"Typical Bonefish excellent food great atmosphere fast waitress. What more could you want"}
{"text":"Energetic bar scene and always a great meal here! From the stuffed sea bass to the fish tacos, there is something tasty for everyone."}
{"text":"Early dinner at Bonefish Grill before checking into my hotel. Nice wine list, an upgrade from the past. The corn and  crab chowder was very good. Also had a huge wedge salad and Coconut Jamaican pie for the road. Service was excellent and the facility was as expected. All in all, a good dining experience."}
{"text":"Run don't walk! I was honestly impressed with the quality of food. Coming from Los Angeles has been difficult for me to find places to eat that are incredible. Well this one fits the bill. When I have visitors come to town this place will be first on my list to share with others! Everything was great, we went on a Wed night so there was no wait. All food had great flavor and spiced adequantly. Yummy in my tummy:-)"}
{"text":"This is a fantastic restaurant. The food was very good. I had the fish and chips for my entrée and it was crispy and tasty. The crab cakes and bang bang shrimp appetizers were awesome. Service was spot on. Definitely a place i will eat at again..."}
{"text":"We really enjoy the food here, love the trout, tuna, and salmon. The side dishes are always wonderful. This visit I called about reserving a table near an electrical outlet (had one of those digital pic frames to show friends) and they couldn't have been more helpful for such an odd  request!! Our server was just wonderful. And the Tuesday special menu is a heck of a bargain."}
{"text":"I am surprised by the bad reviews. Stopped in knowing nothing about the place. Our waiter Miles was great. He say when our water was low before we moved it to show him. He did a great job checking on us. Never felt forgotten or smothered. Perfect service. Thank you Miles.   The food was great. I had the crab cakes and au gratin potatoes. They tasted great. I have lived in the west coast and had crab I caught. This tasted that fresh. My sister did the bang bang shrimp tacos and chowder. I didn't try the chowder cause the put bacon In it but my sister said it was good. The tacos were amazing. We will definitely eat here again.   Ps the flourless brownies are to die for!! So good."}
{"text":"Everything was great, our waitress Shelly was very nice and friendly. We were greeted right away our appetizer and beverages came out right away as well. My biggest turn off is waiting to long and this never happened. After every course was dropped off she was right there to check on us to see if she could get us anything else. She knew what she was doing and was on point. We will be back for sure and make sure we ask for her. Marcus the manager came over as well, we felt the service was 5 stars."}
{"text":"Place was amazing, great fish, had the coconut shrimp app was amazing, had the stuffed shrimp was amazing!!! There drink list was very good with mixed drinks and a good quality liquor. Service was fast and awsome it's a must go for sat date night!!"}
{"text":"Wife and I went in for Sunday brunch, at about 2:30. Not alot of people in the dining room and less in the bar. We weren't dressed well so we sat in the bar. Sat for 15 minutes while the couple next to us was given a free dessert, I'm assuming because of poor service.  We left without even having our drink order taken. Funny enough the host told us to have a good day when he had shown us to our take 20 minutes prior."}
{"text":"I just left Bonefish with a to go order of bang bang shrimp (appetizer), the bang bang shrimp tacos entree and an order of fries. The nice girl who showed me my food upon checking out, showed me the side fries that I paid $4 for and I was shocked!! Look at the picture below of a $4 side of fries. I told her the value fry at McDonald's is actually has more fries. She was very apologetic and said she understands but it's up to the cook on the size of fries they give. I didn't complain because I don't want my food spat on, so I decided to Yelp it."}
{"text":"Time: 9:30pm Friday night (they close at 11pm) Patrons at bar: 1 (now 3 including us) Staff members, including MOD (manager on duty) standing at end of bar: 8 Times bartender cleary saw us but continued to stock anyway: 3 MOD even used computer down by us, said hello, went back to the \"water cooler\" area, yet still no service! WTF is going on!? Do you think we will just disappear if you ignore us long enough?? Well, I guess you're right. We ended walking out a solid 15 mins later after never being served. You're too new, and empty, to just let people Walk Out after being clearly ignored. For Shame, BLOWfish."}
{"text":"food was excellent...Try the Shrimp tacos....CRAZY GOOD! This is a cool place."}
{"text":"I had dinner there last week and everything was excellent. We went to dinner with my grand daughter who 's only 9 months old - something I would advise against but we had no choice .  Even though it was prime dinner hour we were seated quickly and our waiter Constantine was very attentive , the food was outstanding . We all went with a chefs speciality and wasn't disappointed. I highly recommend ."}
{"text":"I was hungry for some unique fish and Bonefish is the place to get it.   I really enjoy the Orange Roughy, which I got.   It is very tasty.  I would have enjoyed a little more butter sauce on it, but overall, it was good.  The service was, however, less than desirable.   My server was nice, but not friendly or personable at all.  She did her job of bringing out my food and my check and took my order, but there was no human connection the entire meal."}
{"text":"I don't write reviews just if I have been comped a meal-or am just a first time diner. Have been to several Bonefish Grills throughout the country.  Have been comped half a meal due to poor service issues at this location, etc.,  and come back several times at lunch only.  At this point, I can say that food is consistently delicious, but service is consistently Denny's. Who wants to experience  a $50 lunch with cleaning activities nearby  by your own server moments before the same hands serve your meal.  No follow up re: how meal is--no follow up re: drink refills or coffee --half of our bill was two beverages--iced tea and coffee and a late (forgotten?) dessert --never refilled--but told \"no big deal\" by female server when finally summoned to do so.  Asked for salad with blue cheese dressing on side--received salad laden with dressing with blue cheese crumbles on side. Ok.  No removal of dirty plates or glasses.  At 1:20 today,- a Tuesday-clearly any lunch \"rush\" was diminished. Bill dropped off unceremoniously with instructions that we could pay anytime--then server disappeared--again. Server tried to look professional by not writing down order initially--but then had to come back to verify order.  Hello, Restaurant Managers of the World--anyone listening?  We just want to get our orders--please write down --that's what pencils and paper are for--We were overcharged for entree and when coffee was brought out there were two molecules of cream in creamer--someone asleep at the wheel.  When asked for more cream, server again said \"no problem, she could get it\"  Wow--superstar--where can we give a bigger tip?? Again, lovely meal--but you really pay for the unengaged, lackluster service--or lack thereof. We didn't bother to correct overcharge on check because we didn't have an extra half an hour."}
{"text":"Came in to have a bite with a client and needed  wifi for the meeting.  Very disappointed that there is no wifi??? EVERYONE HAS WIFI!   we moved the meeting to Panera for crying out loud.  Do they have any idea how many business lunches they are losing because of this?"}
{"text":"Just had dinner for the first time here and, boy, was I pleasantly surprised! To start off, the service was amazing. Our waiter was extremely pleasant, helpful, and attentive.   To drink, I ordered a Watermelon Martini. It was very refreshing, strong yet smooth, and those frozen Watermelon cubes, really, added a fun garnishing detail! I enjoyed it so much, I had to order a second!  The food was delicious. I had the Bang Bang Shrimp, which I highly recommend, and Wagyu Beef and Ginger Potstickers for appetizers. For the main course I had the Shrimp Pad Thai. It had the perfect amount of noodles and shrimp topped with green onions, peanuts, and a delicious Pad Thai sauce.   Great experience, overall!"}
{"text":"We visited Bonefish this past week to celebrate a birthday. Rebecca was absolutely amazing, helping us with food suggestions that were exactly what we were looking for, as well as making certain everything was perfect for the birthday girl. Thank you Rebecca. The Bang Bang shrimp is awesome!!!"}
{"text":"This place is as bad as it gets. Bad food, slow service, unorganized, just a complete waste of time. Tried it a second time hoping the first experience was due to grand opening glitches, unfortunately that wasn't the case. Just an overall terrible dining experience."}
{"text":"Good food and very nice atmosphere. Family friends or dates would love this place. A little pricey, but the food was excellent. Had the sea bass and thoroughly enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Visited Bonefish tonight before we went to see the new Melissa McCarthy movie, The Boss. We began our meal with the mussels, and they were absolutely amazing, the best I have ever had, and the bread and pesto that went along with them paired perfectly with the butter the mussels are cooked in. I had the Chilean a Sea Bass and my date had the Sirloin plus a Lobster Tail, needless to say, we both cleared our plates. Fantastic meal, and great experience, highly recommend it to seafood and land food lovers alike. And Meg N. made our night, she was polished, professional, and an absolute joy to have as our server, will definitely be back! By the way their patio looks awesome, can't wait for that to open up!"}
{"text":"Came here instead, since Flemings couldn't seat us for happy hour. So glad we came by as they have great martinis with stuffed blue cheese olives, and bar tender Brenda suggested the mussels dish as appetizer (very affordable by the way). So fresh and delicious and is our new favorite place for happy hour. Not crowded and loud like Flemings and the place is lovely. Highly recommend this place. Will definitely be doing dinner here next time."}
{"text":"Great service love the bang bang shrimp even the kids tore it up. We had the sea bass and burgers they all where good. A little to much oil was on the sea bass. The Augratin potatoes was also great."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been open for awhile and we finally stopped in.  We weren't that hungry so just had 2 of the smaller dishes.  The waitress asked us if this was the first time that we had been in to Bonefish which was nice and explained the menu to us and also offered to bring us the Lunch and Brunch menus to us to look over while we waited for our drinks.  After getting our drinks, the waitress brought us a small loaf of bread with an olive oil dipping sauce.  The bread was nice and warm like it had just been baked and the dipping oil was awesome!  It had some Italian herbs that really made it pop!  I was really loving it  My wife got the Kobe beef burger and really liked it.  Was cooked perfectly and was a really substantial sandwich.  The only downside to it was that it was so juicy that it basically disintegrated the bottom bun.  She had to turn it upside down to finish it.  I got the Bang Bang tacos.  Very good!  At least 3 to 4 nice size shrimp in each taco, mixed with lettuce and sour cream.  A really nice combo!  A totally satisfying dish.  I see some complain that this is a \"chain\" restaurant.  So what!  Those same folks throng to \"Chipotles\" and don't complain about them being a chain.  This was one fine dining experience and the next time I will be coming hungry and exploring the menu much more!"}
{"text":"Bonefish used to be my \"go-to\" place in Birkdale Village. A martini at the bar, some appetizers before a movie, chit chat with the lady bartenders...Every week. That all changed last Tuesday. Tried the 3-course Lobster special offered on Tuesdays. Lobster was so skimpy and tuff. For the price I wasn't expecting much anyway, BUT...drawn butter was brought after I had finished the meal. Potatoes and vegetable were unbearably salty. Cocktails arrived after first course. I'm not a fan of sweet martini WITH the food. Service very slow and unpleasant. I was charged for a dessert that was supposed to be included in the fixed price. My fav bartender gals had been replaced by guys. Just not the same experience on so many levels. I'll be moving along to Smoke from now on."}
{"text":"Walking in, Bonefish feels unlike the mid-price range chain (Bloomin' Brands) you've come to expect from other area competitors. The decor is understated, simple, and elegant, for example the one steel wall art on the accent wall instead of showing seafood motifs in your face. The really don't get enough credit for this. Though the plastic salt and pepper grinders on the table was off-putting, and did not mesh with the overall atmosphere.  We ordered the 6 shrimp stuffed with crab on a bed of sauteed spinach from the specials menu, a cup of the corn and crab chowder, fish & chips, and an ice tea, all for $40.12 before tip.  Our waiter was changing shifts and we ended up with another waitstaff instead of the original one that sat us, I'm not sure if it was due to this shift lapse, but we had to remind another waiter for our bread. The bread comes with a dish of pesto oil for dipping, instead of dry seasoning, this was a deliciously fresh basil pesto with finely diced kalamata olives. The bread is tantalizingly crusty, the crust is almost glowing, with an extremely airy and soft interior.   The soup was brought out the same time as the bread. By most restaurant standards, the portion could have very well been considered a 'bowl'. It was really generous. The name is not what you'd expect, it's corn chowder yes, but the lump crab meat is sprinkled on top. At first it may seem unappetizing to see such white meat on top of your soup, but it was delectable! Very Santa-Fe style, thick with sweet corn and red peppers, the luscious crab meat worked better spooned with the soup, rather than mixed in.  Our dishes arrived soon after, the shrimp dish was amazing! Each jumbo shrimp was cooked perfectly, tail on, succulent and still almost translucent, it didn't have a hint of fishiness or rubbery texture. The stuffing was almost all crab, and I did not detect a bit of breadcrumbs, it had a hint of Hollandise-like sauce. The bed of spinach created the perfect compliment for each bite.  The fish and chips arrived with 3 slabs of lightly battered, fluffy cod. My partner kept exclaiming that \"it's SO good!\". It was quite remarkable, definitely a contender to any fish fry's around the area.  My dish was so excellent that this was the first time in a long time that I could recall where I didn't feel the need to reach across from me and steal my partner's food. I was perfectly content with my order and wanted to savor every bite.   Service was friendly without being obtrusive, everyone seemed genuinely nice and unpretentious.   The restaurant is beautiful without feeling stuffy, there were people in joggers, sweats, and then there were very nicely dressed couples.   We'd definitely recommend this spot for mid-priced seafood, a romantic date, or for girl's night."}
{"text":"bang-bang shrimp is great,also the grouper was amazing. my wife   ate the trout a nice filet ,nice place ,great service."}
{"text":"The wood grilled char & crab cakes were good. Nice ambiance. Very expensive yet worth treating yourself once in a while. Disappointed with the service. The waiter was selectively not attentive. While customers sitting next to us were getting the VIP treatment. Very odd. Those were an old couple ordering more than us & it is possible he thought its time well spent, assuming a bigger tip. Poor service & pricey should not go together!!! My daughter wanted dessert but the waiter got us the check & did not even mention dessert, while he had asked the other table few secs ago. Some people simply should not be in the hospitality business."}
{"text":"Lobster tacos and spicy shrimp.....Oh Bonefish how I'd love to give you more stars....but I can't.    We came in for a late happy hour and the placed looked great.  We had read good things about the bang-bang shrimp so we both ordered some.  Yum....the shrimp is worthy of the positive reviews and they have it for $6 on Wednesdays.    Unfortunately, the rest of the tale is not a good one.  Service was slooooooow, even with just 8 people at the bar and 2 bartenders.  They weren't bad, just not in a hurry to help anyone.    The lobster street tacos had 2 pieces of small lobster in them, some lettuce, and a light mayo.  The taste was uninspiring at best.  I would have recommended some chipotle mayo or something to spice them up.   I was charged for two lobster tacos and received just one.    Overall too many good restaurants in the Tatum corridor to return to this one."}
{"text":"Order the bang bang shrimp, cold snap ceviche and clam chowder everything was terrific, service is outstanding, friendly and fast. Will definitely come back ;)"}
{"text":"went here today for lunch since I don't want to eat the food I cooked. it's for my kids.. so, we tried this resto bcoz I heard from my friends that it was good. I'm very disappointed. we ordered, the famous bang bang shrimp, Chilean sea bass big order and the shortcake dessert. so.. the shrimp was ok, I felt like it was overrated.. I've tasted and tried a lot but these were definitely not the best or my favorite.. the sea bass was alright but it lacks flavor and kick.. the plating was also lacking... the dessert was just ok. nothing to be excited about.. overall 3 stars for friendly staff and cleanliness. the waitress tools little time even though it's not busy at all.. they are accommodating. I have my strollers and babies.. so that's always a plus! anyways, it might take a very long time for me to go back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent service! I have a dairy allergy & our waiter was very knowledgable about what I could eat safely.  He even double checked with the chef to make sure he remembered correctly. The food was delicious!  I highly recommend the ahi tuna. It was perfect!"}
{"text":"SOLID.  Food is very good.  The wait staff is a tad slow but very, very nice.  They mix a small but well done martini.  Good place"}
{"text":"I have been here twice over the last month or so and also ordered take out. It has been great both times! Went on my birthday and even though their system broke down they seated us on a super busy Friday within 15 minutes. Food was delivered correctly and everyone in the party enjoyed it! Obviously the bang bang shrimp is a go to, but a must if you haven't tried it. I've also had the mussels which were equally delicious! Staff is always friendly and prompt. Would recommend as a great go to sea food place where the food is consistently good!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Bonefish Grill! I tried the bang bang shrimp first as an appetizer and immediately became addicted, so I ordered the bang bang shrimp taco's! I definitely suggest to get it either as an appetizer or as your meal, personally I thought it was too much for both. It's just so good though :P I got the orchid drink and it was absolutely amazing! It tasted like a tropical paradise in the drink and the orchid was edible!! Definitely a fan of this place!"}
{"text":"Seems like reviews for this place are pretty hit-or-miss -- I'll have to err on the \"miss\" side. There are lots of other places in Birkdale that will satisfy your dining needs in a quicker, better-tasting way."}
{"text":"Great menu. The crab cakes are superb. Lobster special currently going on. Best pride in town."}
{"text":"Came here last night with a party of 9 to celebrate my moms birthday. I joined a couple family members at the bar. We got beers and were escorted to a table built for us in the bar area. Everyone arrived, as we sat there for a good 15 minutes without any sort of acknowledgement. The few of us were finished with our beers and the rest of the family sat there without drinks for another 10 minutes until my Uncle asked if we can have service. Mind you the bar isn't busy at this point. We are 25 minutes into our dining experience at this point which the female bartender comes and gets out drink order. We finally have drinks and put in our appetizer order, than salads arrive missing of course my mothers. She ops out of the salad and gets the lobster bisque instead. She loved it. That makes one of us happy at this point. We see other tables getting bread and water. We have to ask for these things... Moving on to dinner I had asked for my steak Pittsburgh rare. This did not happen. After a re-fire of my steak the manager had brought out another steak. Looked like it was microwaved, no sear, no char, nor grill marks. I attempt to eat it, it's ice cold in the center. At this point I just send it back and tell him to forget it. At this point I can't bite my tongue any further.. We let the manager know exactly how our experience went. His apologies fell sort. Our server who was busy tending bar and serving us should have never been put in this position! She was great for what she was thrown into. After dinner we did receive extra comped desserts and comped appetizers when we received the bill. Sadly, I was the one to recommend this place. We will not be returning. If we want stellar service and seafood we will go to Bluewater grill!!"}
{"text":"Came in on a Saturday before going to a concert. It was steady but not too crowded, Staff was friendly and nice. Ordered some yummy food, they have a nice Happy Hour Menu daily till 6:30 with food and drinks. We had a reso but our bartender Sadie was really nice, we decided to sit at the bar with her instead. She was knowledgeable about lots of different items on the menu, and made some great recommendations!"}
{"text":"We went to Bonefish Grill for an early dinner on Sunday, 8/3.  We arrived a little after 5 and the hostess asked if we had reservations.  We said no and then she said, \"so you're a walk in?\"  My husband, being funny, said\" well we drove.\"  The hostess didn't get it.  She took us into the bar to be seated.  She never asked if the bar was okay.  Don't you normally sit in the bar if you don't want to wait for seating?  The entire restaurant was empty except for 2 tables and there was 1 other couple in the bar.  I have no idea why we had to sit in the bar.  My husband asked but he was ignored.  We didn't really make a big deal of it because it was our anniversary (30th) and we didn't want the evening to get weird.  So after that we ordered but the food was just okay.  The soup wasn't hot and the entrees were decent but not excellent.  The service was also mediocre.  Our server was there to bring the food but that was it.  The rest of the time, he and the other 4 servers were gathered around a tv in the bar watching football.  At one point, he even walked out the front door and was outside for awhile.  The bar music was blaring.  I guess for the prices, which I think are somewhat high for the food you're getting, I would expect better service and better ambiance.  We'd been there before and sat in the restaurant and the food seemed pretty good, but then again we had an attentive happy server and we were in the restaurant.   We won't be going back.  Our breakfast at the Coffee Pub the next day was a far better experience and what we'll remember for our 30th anniversary celebration."}
{"text":"Got the Tuesday special, I had the salmon, cooked very nice, house salad, two sides, green beans and spinach, dessert fancy brownie with whipped cream and ice cream, drum roll please, price $14.95.No clue how it was done for that price. Wife had scallops and shrimp meal another great deal at $21."}
{"text":"We had a nice lunch here the other day.  Service was awesome and the food was very good.  Our server forgot our Bang Bang Shirmp order and brought it to us after a reminder.  He took it off our bill without any requests from us, so we were quite pleasantly surprised.  We had the mahi mahi and sea bass, with lemon butter sauce on the side.  Both were perfectly cooked and delicious even without any sauces.  The sides were well done and decent too.  We had truffle Mac and cheese, steamed broccoli, potatoes au gratin, Caesar salad, corn and crab chowder.  It was all well prepared and tasty.  We'll be back for more."}
{"text":"Such a great restaurant but what's most amazing was the service! Mike and Easton are literally the best.... Extremely professional and very accommodating! We dined here on two separate occasions while family was visiting and both times were awesome experiences thanks to these guys! Mike wasn't even our waiter the second visit but he still took care of us... As fellow Californians it was much appreciated. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Bonefish is my favorite chain restaurant. They are pretty consistent on providing good service and good food. You can't go wrong with bang bang shrimp and their martinis. My husband I shared a special they had: $55 for 2 entree specials, an order of bang bang and a dessert. For our entrees we both got the snapper and shrimp. The shrimp was very good, however the mojo sauce that came on the snapper was too overpowering for the fish. I would have preferred a simple lemon butter. I had a pineapple martini (ok, I had 2!) and it was delicious. For dessert we got the pumpkin creme brûlée and took it to-go since we were full, maybe that was a bad choice but it was disappointing. Overall, an average experience but typically I don't leave disappointed so ok give them 4 stars. Bonefish is a good option for upscale casual dining in Birkdale."}
{"text":"The Bang Bang Shrimp appetizer is amazing, I highly recommend that plus the smoked salmon. We went for my Mom's birthday and the waiter was really friendly"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to this location for the first time, we love Bonefish Grill. Our server was Landan and he was great. He was very attentive and the food was fresh. The managers were visible and we will be coming back here."}
{"text":"Update: I sent in a survey to bonefish regarding their service. The manager reached out to me via email saying he wanted to speak with me. I responded to his email with my phone number....it's been about four weeks now and I still have not heard anything. Terrible!  Let's start off by saying we came on a Thursday night and literally no one was here but we waited five minutes for a hostess to come to seat us. It ended up being the lazy hostess who was non apologetic about the wait. For some reason, this bonefish grills food taste different than all the other bonefish grills. I don't plan on returning.  Our hostess was Amber, she ended up being super sweet."}
{"text":"So great to have it back. I lived in Kansas City where this restaurant was created. My wife and I were regulars at the Henderson location before they closed it. Such good placement in Town Square.  To the point;  BANG BANG SHRIMP! Seriously, 2 could order 5 of these and several mojitos and be very happy. However... Don't miss the fresh fish. Sea Bass? Perfecto. Btw, do you know the original name for Chilean Sea Bass? Challenge the server when next you're there. (No goggling)"}
{"text":"8/26. The Food  was Terrible.  It was Overcooked and cold. Ordered the Special. Stuffed lobster/shrimp and filet. Ordered filet medium rare came back Well Done. Manager came over said he was sorry and gave us a voucher for free appetizer for next visit. Wow!!!  Still had to pay $58.00 for 2 drinks and appetizers, manager didn't take anything off. Shows he didn't care. Was I asking too much This was my birthday dinner. Wow thanks a lot for a great dinner; NOT!!!  Next time I will think twice before I go back to the Bonefish Grill.   Thank you so much for ruining my dinner and evening!!!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised. For a chain, Bonefish has pretty good food--and healthy food, if that's what you're looking for. Let's put it this way: when given the choice between this restaurant, and the beefy, greasy Outback Steakhouse right next door, I'd always choose this place.  They had good appetizers, which the table shared (we were with a group of six for a business-type dinner). We tried the calamari, coconut-crusted shrimp, and bacon-wrapped sea scallops.   For entrees, there is quite a variety. For example, there's a portion of the menu in which you are given a selection of different grilled fish  options, as well several choices of sauces (sort of reminds me of what they do with the pastas at some family-style Italian restaurants). I opted for tilapia with the warm mango salsa. I enjoyed it fine, but someone else at the table thought the fish was dry and bland.  Dessert was ridiculous. The table shared two things and to be honest I can't remember what they were, but they were decadent and were topped with ice cream and fudge sauce. This is what most reminded me I was in a chain restaurant!  Overall, not bad at all. I haven't been back since that one time, but I wouldn't be opposed to it."}
{"text":"Average is the title.   Soup is average, with undercooked potatoes.   Saucy shrimp average  Sunday brunch omelette small, and seasoned with Salt and pepper only. Cheddar cheese and bacon, with avocado on top ... very unique...not  Gluten free options limited, I had to send my meal back, even after explaining gluten free, sending the server to the kitchen to ask about the side potatoes, then they served the dish with toast ( not ordered) contaminated over the whole dish.   Not impressed... this place is so far from the quality I used to get in Tampa at the original BoneFish."}
{"text":"So we went to bonefish last night with a party of 7, they say us down, on time even though the place was packed. They somehow mad a mistake on how many was in out party, thinking only 2. But they still made it happen on time. We ordered our appetizers and somehow the order appeared within less the 10 minutes, now I'm talking 4 different appetizers. Word from the wise, get the bang bang shrimp. The bomb, if you don't try the bang bang shrimp your missing out. The food was good, I ate a t-bones the night before so it's hard to camp are the two, but I wasn't upset in the least. The service was one of the best I've witnessed, especially with a packed house & the slight mix up in the numbers in out party.  Eric Johnson (manager) came out to greet us and apologize for the mix up, I said to him \"I'm truly impressed with your service. Great place, good food, phenomenal service."}
{"text":"We've had take out a number of times from this place, and the food has been generally pretty good and tasty.  We stopped for Sunday Brunch there yesterday.  This is a nice place inside, good ambiance, busy atmosphere, even with all the snow that was out there.  Our service was just not good.  Our server had some problems, to say the least.  Her short term memory was horrible and her eye contact just non-existent.  I'd ask a question, and she'd look at my wife and answer.  She was way too pushy on the upsell.  We are hungry people --- we order usually some type of appetizer, have a couple drinks, and order dessert when there's something good.  But she was too pushy, and I felt like I was in a furniture store or car dealership.  She asked us if we wanted more bread about three times.  After two, I'm annoyed.  She didn't ask me how I wanted my steak cooked, and delivered it mostly rare-med rare.  I prefer it medium, but of course, she wouldn't know that.  She didn't check on us fast enough for me to send it back. So I ate it and was unhappy about it.  I think good service at a restaurant should be almost invisible --- quickly and quietly elicit the information you need to give me what I want, and then disappear.  She repeated the order back multiple times as if it was a second grader trying to remember where the bathroom is at the grade school.  \"turn right at the water fountain, straight, and then it's on the left.\" \"turn right at the water fountain, straight, and then it's on the left.\"  The food was fine but the service was so irritating, that there's not much point in going there.  Take-out has been reliable."}
{"text":"Don't get caught up on the exterior/interior decor it draws you in but once you get your meal A hot mess!! I usually love bonefish grill. This must be a knockoff because the food was not the same as any other bonefish I've ever gone to. I forgot what i ordered but it was dry and not tasty at all,  i had to send it back. Started off bad, the bread was still frozen in the middle and they couldn't get a simple side of spinach right. It was awful and i was upset that i spent over  $40 on something i could have put together myself. I go out for the experience and to eat good food that i cant prepare and this wasn't it. Haven't been back!"}
{"text":"The service was very good, but the food was well below par. The spicy tuna bowl and ceviche was eatable. The bang bang shrimp was pretty good. If there is a next time I think we would stick with signature dishes."}
{"text":"Our go to place for seafood in the North Hills. Save from for the coconut pie!"}
{"text":"I can only comment on their brunch menu, but it's fantastic. $20 for bottomless mimoa, bellini, or bloody mary + entree. Got the burger and it was fantastic. Chef came out to check on our dining experience (restaurant was not busy). New find, but it's already one of my favorite brunch spots in town."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday...disappointed a little. ..service is extremely slow...I ordered filet and crab cake $27.00....I would like to think I could get at least a warm dinner? Definitely not...also I love love love lobster bisque soup.... (don't even waste your time ordering) it tasted like tomato soup with imitation lobster....2 positive things...the bang bang shrimp is delish! And the bread and the oil is yummy..tastes like a pesto oil...my 1st time here, I won't be ready to go back anytime soon."}
{"text":"The quality of food at this location has gone down over the years. The appetizers are smaller for the same price. The food is served very bland or overpriced. The drinks are overpriced. I think I will stick to Bang Wednesdays only. Nothing else is worth it. I used to love Bonefish Grill. I can waste a ton of money on horrible food soomeplace else."}
{"text":"Food was delicious but I do think they were overpriced.  Salmon was cooked well and the broccoli and garlic mashed potatoes were delicious"}
{"text":"Really great service, nice clean restaurant.  The food was well prepared and came out in a timely manner.  Portions were smaller than I expected but the flavor was good!"}
{"text":"Awesome! Great seafood, nice \"no ching ching ching\" atmosphere. Funday Sundays are perfect for a few drinks and bites before dinner. We love to go here often. My favorite is the calamari and my husband always orders the bang bang shrimp."}
{"text":"Surprisingly poor service for a well reputed, upper end chain.  Our party of 4 had a reservation and were promptly seated, but waited 30 minutes for the wine. After asking twice, the bottle was delivered and comped. The meals arrived over 1 hour after we were seated.  The food preparation was good although the fish portions were about 1/3 small for the price.  Seafood portions at comparable restaurants are larger at this price point, either locally or per our experience on the east coast. It made me wonder if they were stretching the supply since it was New Year's Eve.    Our server never checked on us after ordering.  Someone else delivered the meals (including an attempt to deliver another table's meal to us). We had to find her to take a dessert order but the one we wanted had been exhausted by then.  These service issues were not expected of this chain, which apparently does not have uniform procedures or hiring practices.  Our server did not have basic skills for the job at this level.  We may return in 6-12 months if the reviews improve."}
{"text":"Someone stole our reservation.  Which the blame should fall on the restaurant for not making sure before seating. And dear customers DON'T just take a reservation. Super rude.  Although the manager was super nice and gave us 2 free bang bang Shrimp. We had to wait 40mins for a table. Since it was 7 total. 3 children, 3 and under made this a tiresome 40min wait.   The steak I ordered, medium rare -was served rare.   Our drinks weren't bought out at the same and the waiter had to be reminded of the drink order for our friends and husbands side of orange juice.   Bang bang shrimp is scrumptious. So is the crab fried rice, mashed potatoes, & truffle mac and cheese.  Cranberry cosmo (special) was also delicious.   Overall I think we will need to visit again to really decide. I feel like it was off night for the restaurant. Till then my rating stands."}
{"text":"It really saddens me to write a bad review since we had been looking forward to dining at Bonefish Grille for quite some time. But it was absolutely AWFUL. Do not waste your time or money! My husband has been talking about Bonefish for as long as I can remember and couldn't be more excited that one finally opened in Phoenix. We went last weekend for Sunday Brunch. The brunch menu is a little limiting compared to the regular menu but so be it. It was pretty quiet in the restaurant and not busy at all (several servers clearly had nothing better to do and stood next to our booth, literally an arm's length away, chatting away during our entire meal). No one was out and out rude but the hostess seemed annoyed when we asked for a booth and quickly quipped that she couldn't put a high chair or sling at the end for our baby. Not a problem, he's young enough to stay in his car seat. The attitude was unnecessary though. Our server was nice enough but super slow to refill our drinks (had to ask three times for iced tea refills). They charged more than $4 for our 5 year old's lemonade (separate from her meal that should have been included) that \"had to be made at the bar\"-taking a full 15 minutes longer for our kiddo to have a drink after the rest of of table received theirs. And it was served in a tall glass-not very accommodating to young kids when the restaurant has a kids menu. Minor things but there was hardly anybody there so I'm not sure why they delay.  The issue is the food-my husband's bang bang tacos were just ok. I'm not sure what people are gushing about in the online reviews but they were mediocre at best. I ordered the surf and turf eggs benedict. I am not a food snob by any means-but I coudn't even gag my way through half of it!! Poached eggs, hollandaise, filet mignon, and lobster-it should have been fantastic. The eggs and english muffin were too tough to even cut with a steak knife, the lobster was flavorless, and the filet mignon, although it appeared to be cooked well, had an odd smell and taste to it. I felt sick for several hours afterward. The cerviche appetizer was the only tasty dish that came across our table. The whole experience was just awful. We could not be more disappointed. There are plenty of fantastic restaurants in the valley, do your taste buds, tummy, and your wallet a favor and go just about anywhere else."}
{"text":"We were really worried about dining here after seeing the reviews but we decided to try it out and I'm so glad we did! The Bang Bang Shrimp were soo perfect! Our waitress was very friendly and the food came out fast and was all delicious."}
{"text":"This was our first time at this restaurant and I wanted so much to love it. We had a 6pm reservation and were seated promptly upon arrival. The hostess was friendly and our server George was helpful. We were presented with a list of specials which included Swordfish and pumpkin ravioli. For appetizers we tried the Ahi Tuna Sashimi and the Bang Bang Shrimp. The tuna was good but not spectacular. The shrimp had a good flavor. Portions were pretty big for an appetizer. Would have been better if we shared one. I had the wedge salad which was okay, but again just an average salad. My hubby had a cup of corn chowder with lump crab meat which was tasty and a generous portion for a cup. I decided on ordering the swordfish but was told they were out of pumpkin ravioli. I was quite disappointed by this. It was early in the night to be out of something on your specials list. Poor management of inventory if you ask me. So I ordered it with the suggested mushroom ravioli. My hubby got the Chilean sea bass with mango salsa. Both of our entrees were disappointing. The mushroom ravioli was not tasty at all. Both fish dishes were flavorless. I was surprised that a place that specializes in seafood does not know how to infuse flavor into the fish. They merely just top it with stuff. I was not impressed at all by the food here. I will say that the service was good and ambience nice for a night out, but it does not make up for the poor food."}
{"text":"Love this place for many reasons.   First: on a mild Spring or Winter day you can enjoy sitting outside in their patio. The sun will just shine enough to make you feel warm and cozy. Beautiful set up. Second: The staff, and especially the manager, is friendly and very professional. They recommend, and explain their specials etc.   I especially love the Bang Bang Shrimp sandwich. The mix of the dressing, the spices, the amount of shrimp, and the crispy light bread roll. Delicious!!!  My husband likes the fish and chip dish. The fish is very crispy and ligth. Yummy! Try it!"}
{"text":"Love Bonefish! Wednesdays they serve bang bang shrimp on lunch special for 6 bucks. Some of the premier fish can get pricy like the sea bass but it's really good. Great ambience for business casual lunch. I work really close to here and I meet my wife for lunch here at least twice a month, we've had two different servers remember our drink orders and have them to the table before we order them. Can't say enough about this place. It's by far my favorite lunch spot."}
{"text":"We eat here at least once a week and always ask for Bobbi! She is awesome and attentive to our needs. When she is not there we will ask for Jay as he has a great personality as well. Food is always consistent and fresh tasty! Would recommend joining the dine in rewards too!"}
{"text":"From the music to the lighting to the food this place is amazing. Everytime I go there I am blown away. Shawn the bartender is amazing and his knowledge is impeccable.  Danny the front of the house manager is always around and making sure that everything is perfect. I live this place!"}
{"text":"You might not know but they have a great happy hour from 4 - 6:30 PM and I LOVE happy hour! The bar is big and rarely ever busy. The decor is awesome too!   My favorite appetizers are the Crab Cakes and & Sashimi. For entrees I love the Chilean Sea Bass with Mango Salsa! I also love trying their specials. You can never go wrong with one of those! Right now they have a Saucy Shrimp Appetizer that I hope they make part of the menu because it is fantastic. They are known for their Bang Bang Shrimp but I think the Saucy Shrimp is better."}
{"text":"We had a good time here. Service was slow but the food was all done well. The server was nice and personable but it was busy so we expected it to be slow going. It was slow.   Bang bang shrimp. So good. But haunts you later at night if you are older. Just a warning. The corn chowder with lump crab was delicious. The risotto with shrimp and scallops special was pretty decent. Seemed like all of the dishes we ordered had a little kick to them. Which may have contributed to the haunting heartburn later.   The bread service was excellent and the mojito was served in a neat tilted glass. Over all a good experience."}
{"text":"Recently went for lunch for the first time. My partner got ceviche, which she enjoyed as a light meal and did look nice. It wouldn't have been enough for me. I got a lunch special: 2-3 fish tacos and a caesar salad. The caesar was pretty good, large portion. The fish tacos were a little fishy, juicy, and heavy with mango. Some might really enjoy those qualities but it was not my taste. I try every fish taco in town when I have a chance :)  Drinks were large and strong, which I always appreciate. We had the modern mojitos, which were quite heavy on the orange and grand marnier. We were seated quickly, great looking restaurant. Staff was OK; good looking people but we didn't like the ipads. Didn't come back for a long time when we needed waiter. I'll be back to try dinner."}
{"text":"Angelica M was our server and she was absolutely wonderful! Very attentive, informative and knowledgable about the menu. She was a fast service and made sure we had full drinks and bellies the entire time. The food was awesome and I would definitely suggest the Bang Bang Shrimp and the Winter White Cosmo. We had a great date night and will definitely be back and soon!"}
{"text":"7pm reservation and were seated right away. The place was full including the bar. Our drink and appetizer order was taken promptly but the server had to apologize since the bar couldn't fill the order, 3 glasses of wine and 1 mixed drink, for about 10 minutes. During our wait it was difficult to carry on a pleasant conversation due to the noise level. The acoustics are horrible. I've eaten in a bonefish in Maryland many times where the atmosphere is wonderful. This one is not. When the restaurant is full you can't hear anything your dinner guests are saying. The servers were all great. The food is outstanding. When the place emptied out around 8:15 a conversation became possible but the overhead music which now became evident was also too loud. Lots of staff who all tried to make the experience pleasant but they couldn't turn down the volume and couldn't get the bar to speed up. Turn down the noise and I'll be back regularly."}
{"text":"great food and service try the bang bang shrimp 4 appetizer pan Asian salmon 4 main course"}
{"text":"I really like this new location.   Came for the sips and samples event they have almost monthly. 2 drinks and 4 appetizers for $25. Wonderful deal. I came with a friend who has never eaten at Bonefish before. She was very impressed. I tried both of the newest/featured martinis. Both are great but my fav was the Tropic Heat! See pics for the menu....  2 things, we went on a mild early spring evening and the air was very cold inside! Cooled the food off. And a little girl stubbed her toe because the revolving door goes a little too fast. Can it be slowed down some?"}
{"text":"I came for the Sips and Staches event. This is a pre fix menu for $25. Bonefish has a goal of $20,000 to give to Movember.   Started with a bang bang shrimp to share... Then... Dumplings-good Crab cakes-ok Cod sliders-meh  Beef sliders-ok Augratin bites-didn't try due to bacon  You also had a choice of receiving 2 drinks from a list of martinis, draft beer, wine, a.d other mixed drinks"}
{"text":"This restaurant was excellent all around. I've been to this chain many times, and I'd have to say this is the best experience we've ever had. The food was fresh, excellent, and brought out in a timely manner. The best part about the experience, however, was our server Nina. She was attentive, personable, and engaging. I highly recommend eating here, and ask for Nina!"}
{"text":"Very good ! Great service and food! Must have the bang bang shrimp as an appetizer. Fresh bread server with meal as well. Id suggest doing call ahead seating as it is rather busy on the weekends. Have been here a bunch of times ! Id also suggest going on Tuesday nights as they have some great meal specials. Once it warms back up they have some great outdoor seating available too.  Overall a great place for seafood and any thing on the menu ! We love it there"}
{"text":"Seated immediately at 6pm on a Tuesday, despite no reservation.  Our table was next to the bathroom, which was fine considering it was moderately busy (75% occ).  But then we sat for 10 minutes without being greeted, despite the table next to us being visited twice, and the large party behind us being visited 4 times for bread, water, and drink orders.  Perhaps our table was unassigned to a server?  Maybe they were short a server?  So we left.  Will try again another time."}
{"text":"I recently wrote a review about bonefish because my wife and I had a bad experience. We spoke with the manager Marcus and he said he was going to turn it around for us the next time we came in and he did just that. He listened to us complain and basically be right the disparage the place  but took it as constructive criticism and really made changes that we were able to notice upon our next visit.  As consumers were generally quick to complain when something isn't right so I wanted to be just as quick and express how Marcus and the guys over at bonefish turned things around for us!  Great job. my wife and I Love bonefish again."}
{"text":"Bonefish Grill has usually been a consistent favorite of ours - consistent in food quality, service no matter which Bonefish Grill we go to - although our dinner tonight would make us think again.   First off, our server, Rachel, was awesome even with her hands full training a new person. She did everything within her capabilities to remedy our dinner experience. If not for her, I rate this barely a 1 star.  Main issues: 1. Bang Bang Shrimp - flavor was still there but...bed of lettuce seemed like it had slightly brown edges but brushed it off because it.may have been the sauce, and the batter on the shrimp was \"slipping\" off. Definitely not a good start.  2. Fish-n-Chips - portion sized was SIGNIFICANTLY smaller and there was batter than fish! We inquired about this and was told that it could have been a result of inconsistent cuts. 2 additional peices were then brought in to make up for the issue.  3. Shrimp Pad Thai - had this dish before and it WAS good, now no longer. It tasted over sweet like it had been drenched in sweet chili sauce, noodles stuck together in clumps, and the shrimp was added in like an afterthought instead of part of the dish as it had ZERO taste and was rubbery. Now I don't expect it be the same as in a real Thai restaurant but this dish has been on their menu for awhile.   4. Ice tea refill was so watered down that I had to being it to their attention to get the real stuff  5. Overheard the tables around us also having issues i.e. sides listed on the menu not available because they were given an old menu, food not cooked as expected, etc...  We hope this was just an off night for Bonefish Grill but to be safe we will wait a bit before our next visit that is if we dare to return."}
{"text":"Excellent food (Mostly) but when they messed up one of our orders (way overcooked the fried fish), management owned it and made sure we were taken care of by comping that particular meal.  There was no line, no wait for lunch, that was good because I was STARVING!    Service was mostly good - we had to flag the server down for drink refills and to bring the overcooked fish to his attention, but otherwise he was positive, upbeat and friendly.  I'd have no issue with returning here for another go at some decent lunching."}
{"text":"This place was alright. I was really excited and was really looking forward to dining here. We didn't have the friendliest greeting and the food was okay. We ordered the Bang Bang Shrimp for starters which was pretty good. We were offered bread and pesto but didn't get it until our salad came. I couldn't even tell you if the bread and pesto was good or not because there was hair on the plate.  We ordered the Bonefish House Salad, if you don't like olives than this salad is not for you. I like olives so to me, it was pretty good! I for my main course I ordered the Tilapia Imperial with sautéed spinach and garlic mash as my side and my date ordered 6oz Filet medium, garlic mash and steamed broccoli for sides.  I'll start off with the tilapia, it started off extremely dry around the edges and was pretty good towards the middle of the fish. The entire entree was really bland. The filet was really bland. The broccoli was over cooked... I don't know... This place was a disappointment. For desert we have the chocolate crème brûlée and it was delicious. Everything else was okay and the service was okay. Probably won't be back. Didn't go to the restroom... can't judge them on that. The moscato is good!"}
{"text":"Disappointed that the host made fun of my last name when I checked in. I found it very immature and rude and it set a negative tone for the rest of the meal. Our waitress was having difficulty with the bar staff filling drink orders so that resulted in a round of drinks that never got delivered and the others, that once delivered, were brought out 5 minutes apart making it uncomfortable for those who did not get them. First impressions in the restaurant business are everything and Bonefish was lacking. Stick with some of the many other restaurants in the area for a better experience."}
{"text":"My Rip-Eye wood grilled Steak was okay. I ordered this Steak with Potatoes Au Gratin and Béarnaise."}
{"text":"We had 7PM reservations. After waiting an hour and a half, we gave up and ate elsewhere. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"My husband and I went in for New Year's Eve dinner. We usual only go on special occasions- NYE, anniversary etc. We made reservations for 6:45 but were running late, so I called and let them know. They were very accommodating even though we didn't make it until 7:05 and despite how busy they were, we were seated shortly after we arrived.  The Bang Bang Shrimp was delicious (as usual). We each ordered the filet and lobster tail dinner. I asked for my steak to be medium-well, my husband asked for medium. His came out perfect and mine was extremely well done and very chewy. The waitress immediately noticed and took it back to get me another filet. We waited a little while, which was expected since they were so busy, but it came out great.  The manager came to our table to apologized and took care of our bill. The service is always exceptional every time we go and we will continue to dine at Bonefish Grill for all of our special occasions. Thank you to the Management and staff for making our dining experience great!"}
{"text":"Well unfortunately I wasn't impressed. My friend suggested this place so I took a look @ their menu on line & already knew what I wanted before I even got there. My friend was already there, seated. We had waters on the table to start. Our young waitress cane over & introduced herself (forgot her name) & asked us about drinks & apps. after I had to tell her I couldn't hear her. She had a very soft voice & the place was busy & nosey.  Our cocktails took some time to get to us but they were really pretty & tasted yes yummy! (see pictures). I got the pineapple martini....made with rum not vodka. I asked if bread came with the meal since I saw some at the table next to us & was told yes. The bread was delicious, tasted homemade but the oil & herb dip wasn't so good. Had a odd taste to it. I was soooo hungry I ate it anyways, though it would of been better if I had some butter!   We both got a lobster tail dinner on special $u13.90 & added a lobster tail on $8.00. A tad cheaper then the lobster tails dinner on  the full menu. It was OK, but had this different odd fishy taste to it. Now, now I know lobster is a seafood but I've never had a lobster that tasted so fishy before. Now the menu had a ton of shrimp items in it & also other fish & steak stuff too.  All non-pasta meals come with a side of veggies but all I saw was squash in my veggies. Tastes as if they sprinkled cheese on it....I could of done without the extra calories. We also got to chose a side. I picked the potato au-gratin which wasnt very tasty or good!   We waited too long for out checks after our table was cleared too...... I don't like the set up inside. The tables were all to close to each other. No room for a private conversation, or to hang your purse on the corner of the chair without someone knocking into it or worrying if someone People had to walk almost sideways to get by & through the dinner room. It's as if they were trying to  squeeze more tables then they could by putting all the tables so close. Not sure if I will go back!"}
{"text":"This evening my friend and I thought, \"let's go to bonefish grill\" we researched it on yelp and the presentation looked awesome.  Unfortunately the presentation and the waiter  were the only thing awesome.   I tried the \"Ahi Bowl\" and my friend tried the\"Chilean Sea Bass\" the Ahi  bowl was a bit off in color and the Sea Bass tasted like it was soaked in petrol.   On the bright side we did enjoy each others company and a great bottle ofSanta Margarita Pinot Grigio!!! That's really all that mattered!!!  Food is definitely subpar!!!  Damn I really did want to like this place!!!!"}
{"text":"Bonefish Grill is chain. It has become the destination of choice by people at my workplace for the Wednesday afternoon happy hour. They have loved their bang bang chicken so much and for so long that they refuse to go any place else. We had to change our plans once because we could not get the reservation.   Ambiance is good. The corporations know how much light and music is good for the customers when they are drinking. The place is always full on Wednesdays, when I have visited here. The problem is overcrowding and narrow places between tables when moving around.   Food is good for sure. But there are no vegetarian options. Their salads are not filling. I ordered the shrimp pasta without the shrimp both the times I have been there. First time, the waiter was a very nice and old gentleman who asked me for my preferences and delivered a very good dish. I enjoyed it a lot. The second time it was not the case. The waiter did not particularly respect my dietary preferences and just delivered pasta without the shrimp.   I will be going there again with my coworkers because it is the place they like to go to. If it would be on me, I will go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Friendly service. Good looking bar. Booth we sat at was covered in food crumbs. Ordered fish and chips and shrimp tacos. Nothing had flavor. The shrimp was a little bit spicy but unless you already knew you were eating shrimp, you couldn't tell.  Fries are crunchy but lack flavor of any kind.  Would not come back ever."}
{"text":"We were really looking forward to finally eating here, but right away we knew something was wrong.  The place was empty and we were the only people there.  The waitress started out ok, and said we could still get the lunch menu even though it was 3:10pm.   That made a great impression, but believe me it was all downhill from there. We got our drinks from the busser and then waited about ten minutes to order.   After a very long wait of almost twenty minutes we got our food.  My mother and I ordered the fish and chips, and my sister had Pad Thai with shrimp.   I can only describe the food as really tasteless, the fish was almost non existent.  I ordered a side of coleslaw that was really bland and really sweet. I knew my sister didn't like her dish because she immediately started asking us if we wanted any shrimp.  She couldn't eat the pad thai because it was also sickeningly sweet.  The shrimp was small overcooked and again not very good.   When the waitress came over about ten minutes later to check on us, we were already done and told her it was very disappointing.  The weird thing is she acted like she expected us to say this, and had no apology or reaction. It looks like they spent every dime they had on  the restaurant, and they have nothing left on the food or help end..."}
{"text":"Came here twice with the hubby. It's alright. Love The atmosphere. I had the chowder And my husband got a fish dish."}
{"text":"I loved the food! The drinks; however, were a different story.  The food (bang bang shrimp, filet mignon, and tuna steak) was amazing! The shrimp was exquisite, filet mignon was juicy and succulent, and the rare tuna steak was divine!  The drinks, besides the water they give you when you sit down, were way too expensive! $17 dollars for a jack and coke?!   I hate writing 3 star reviews by the way!"}
{"text":"The service is horrible! Food is good, but they need to be trained and get some management in there that will train the waiting staff what people expect when they dine out."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've been to Bonefish, and it has a typical upper scale chain restaurant vibe: chic, low lighting, and crowded.   This place got my attention when I realized the happy hour wine price was only $3.50!! That's a steal, and the wine tasted great. My mom really enjoyed her raspberry martini; the presentation was appealing and it was chilled to perfection.   As an app, we tried the Rockefeller oysters. I don't traditionally like oysters, but I did enjoy the crusty, cheesy toppings. It still wasn't enough to disguise the slimy innards, but that's just me. I would recommend for any oyster aficionados in the Madison area.   I ordered the spicy tuna bowl as an entrée, and at 950 calories it was no light dish. The seared, sesame  -encrusted ahi tuna was a little warmer than anticipated but sill paired well with the chutney salsa. Next time, I would probably order the Chilean sea bass I was drooling over at the table next to ours. I'm not a huge fan of chain places, but if I'm in the area I would stop by here again just for the pesto olive oil bread pairing."}
{"text":"Bonefish grill is probably our favorite higher end restaurant in the area.  We have been here so many times to count but every time we go the food is just as good.  I recommend everything on the menu but the filet mignonette is unbelievable.  We enjoyed dessert today and saved room for Banana Foster which was fantastic.  The prices are a little more expensive but its totally worth it."}
{"text":"We went today for lunch.  None of us had ever been.  My friends had the scallops with the mango salsa.  They did not comment on it...one way or another.  It looked good though.  I had the Kobe beef burger, it was really tasty, The waiter said...best burger you will ever get in a seafood restaurant.  I think he was right.  I think next time I would like to try the brunch.  Seems like a great deal if you like cocktails...bottomless Mimosas, Bellinis or Sangrias...and lots of choices of fruits to mix in."}
{"text":"Typically I'm not a fish person so when my family picked here to eat I wasn't very excited... I luckily found some kind of chicken over rice with veggies and it was super yummy! We also got the bang bang shrimp to share and it was amazing, they are fried so it's crispy and the sauce is super savory and just a little spicy. Another time I went I tried a dish with salmon and it was also very good. You can tell their food is pretty fresh cause it doesn't have the overwhelming fishy taste. I would definitely recommend this, even to people like me who don't loooove fish!"}
{"text":"First time for dinner there January 5,2016. Had steak and coconut shrimp. Your shrimp was FANTABULOUSSSSS!!!!!! Great place, great service and greatttttt food. You just might want to teach your sister company how to do that shrimp. I was there on January 7, and ordered their steak and coconut shrimp. Their shrimp was very small and it was bought already breaded . Just regular breaded shrimp. And then they give a coconut sauce to dip it. No comparison . Very disappointed with Outback and that was my favorite but you are number one now in my book."}
{"text":"Finally checked out Bonefish Grill tonight. Things started off good.  Server was nice and informative. Appetizer came out in like 2 minutes. More into dinner, the service was good but seemed robotic. Bang bang shrimp was good. Our salads were underwhelming. When are dinner arrived, we both ordered crab cakes, we were definitely not impressesd. Taste was ok but portions are pretty small. There was also something in the remoulade that didn't taste great. To end our dinner our server said all he asked is that we don't steal his pen?  Really?!  All in all the food was good but underwhelming. I'm not rushing back."}
{"text":"Been to many Bonefish restaurants but this was not my best visit.  Had a bang bang shrimp that was over cooked and could not get the fork through the breading.  My side dish of broccoli was cold and not steamed and I look up to see my wife choking on bones from her trout.  Do Not get the trout!  She had 5 bones in one bite. They quickly took that plate away.  We got another trout refired about 20 mins later and it also had bones.  Manager said that happens sometimes.  At this point we left.  Do not get the Rainbow trout, it has a parmasan crust and you cant see the bones!"}
{"text":"The food was fantastic! Bang Bang shrimp tacos were so so good, and my boyfriend's fish & chips were super! Really really great food! Our server, Lacey, was also great!  I deduct TWO stars for music. Why? Music is such an important part of the atmosphere that when it is bad, you can't help but have it impact your dining experience. I get what the restaurant is going for...soft, easy going music, but it was downright depressing. It made our trip on a lovely Sunday only so-so. The food was so good that we will try again, probably for dinner, and hope that the music is not so 'sad' again."}
{"text":"I've been out to the bonefish in Michigan and was very excited to see this place was opening.  I've been to this location 3 times, all with pretty awful service, and this last Friday 3/20/2015 really took the cake.  Looking at Yelp reviews every seems to love the food, but complains about service.  I Bartend in this Industry and I'm very open to busy staff, new staff, and other issues that come up on a day to day as to why there could be weak service.  My Girlfriend and I sat at the bar for 15 minutes without being greeted once, and there was one lady at the bar.   The bar holds like 15-20 seats so with one person at the bar you see just how much open space there is and how it is impossible to miss us.  We realized that we weren't going to helped after the bartender glanced at us then Went back to stocking 5 bottles of beer( when I stock 5 bottles of beer it usually takes, I don't know 8 seconds?) which took 10 minutes or so.   The 7 other servers/ staff were all at the other end of the bar laughing it up having a good time, as it looked like they made it through a successful night and were all done at 9, even though they're open till 11.   At least 5 staff members saw us sitting there including the MOD, an older lady who was wearing Blue, and no one said a word to us.   Even with my last two experiences here I was still recommending people come here because the food is great and maybe it was new growing pains for the staff.  Never again.  ide say the food was great but didn't get a chance to try it yesterday.  My first yelp review ever, congratulations for being the one and only on my list ."}
{"text":"Great Service! First time at a Bonefish Grill.  We went on a Thursday evening at 5 and were asked if we had reservations.  We didn't , and they did get us a seat immediately, but it got very busy by the time we left.  I recommend reservations! When we left the waiting area was packed, but they were walking around with free appetizers for sampling, very nice touch. Having never been before, we completely relied on our waiter for menu helps.  We got all the things he suggested and were very pleased! Bang Bang Shrimp for appetizer's crispy crusted shrimp in a spicy cream sauce....didn't sound so good, but was wonderful!!!!  ( He said on Wednesdays they have Bang Bang specials on everything for $5 which is a good deal) For dinner I had the Kobe beef burger (yes a hamburger) and it was truly phenomenal.  My husband had one of the specials which was a haddock, grilled with feta and artichokes and he also thought it was great. The wait staff were always coming by and clearing the table or refilling drinks, bringing bread with pesto sauce.  Our waiter was very personable and friendly, never had to wait on anything.  Really enjoyed our visit.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went last night for ladies night out to get some always delicious bang bang shrimp. Upon coming in the hostess stand was ciaos. Could not even check in for our reservation because two hostess were taking a to go order at the hostess stand. Not sure who thought it would be a good idea to have people placing to go orders at the hostess stand on a busy Saturday night versus having them place at the bar.  When I asked if this was where we should check in the rude young hostess replied \" we are taking care of this to go order and then will assist you\". Again, not sure WHY it takes two people to take a to go order. My friend said we need to make sure we yelp and the rude hostess stopped what she was doing with the to go order and said \" what did you say?\". I can't! But, I guess that is a way to finally get service.   I noticed the same hostess telling a party of 7 that their table was ready and it would be at the high top at the bar. The lady responded that she told them she has a child in a high chair and that wouldn't work. I heard her on multiple times explain they had a child. The rude hostess said \" well that's that we have so you can take that or wait and be out be out back in the list\". It's a shame the manager guy was in the mix and didn't stop this young lady from talking to people like they were pieces of crap.  After we were seated thankfully our server was amazing and very tentative to our needs. Food was great. We decided on the bang bang shrimp, seafood dip, mahi mahi Oscar and coconut shrimp. All exceptional!  I would go back but would walk right out the door if that same hostess is working the door.  Note- your hostess is the front line of customer service! If you don't have that in order the rest won't matter.  I hope Management reads this and reconsiders their hostess especially on Saturday nights!"}
{"text":"Let's start the review with my meal was so good at the restaurant  ... I ordered my meal as takeout.  I started with the house salad ... hearts of palm, olives, and spring greens .... lemon vinegarette yummy  My entree was highly recommended by people waiting to be seated ... scallops and shrimp with a tomato garlic light sauce ... with their version of scalloped potatoes .... which was the epitome of comfort food.  Wait ... I skipped the warm bread with dipping oil ... you can't just eat one piece of bread.  The manager came over, introduced himself, & personally took my takeout order.  The portions left me satisfied not full.  I bet if I had ordered dessert I would have moved from satisfied to stuffed.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"excellent meal! alaskan salmon and wifey had the steak and lobster! everythings prepared to perfection! Armando was our server, Great service. highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great place love it but call for opening times stated on yelp they opened at 11.AM but it was closed when we got there , that is a bit of a disappointment."}
{"text":"We were there on December 26th, Friday.  I thought it can be crowded with  a busy shopping day, but it was almost empty.  We had great service and was able to kill sometime before heading to the airport to drop off the guests.  Bang bang shrimp was good. Corn chowder with lobster meat was very good and I even ordered seconds. The burgers were okay.   The location is great in town square for us. Away from the craziness of the strip. Our friends who stayed in the strip for 4 days appreciated the quietness there."}
{"text":"I got the happy hours tacos and they were good! My friend got the other flavor of tacos and we switched so we could try both! Honestly, both are good and would recommend either of them.  Originally wanted to come for bottomless mimosas, but apparently that is only on Sundays. So if you are coming here for those, please remember to come on Sundays."}
{"text":"Fabulous food, drinks, specials and service!!! Ryan our host was fabulous and accommodating  and Amber M our server was friendly and knowledgeable & very attentive as well. We will frequent Bonefish Grill for sure!!"}
{"text":"Had a girls luncheon today..... Kinda disappointed ~ I really like Bone Fish but my last 2 lunches have left me......disconcerted!      Today's lunch was for 12 and the young man..... He looked about 14, however I am sure he was over 21, just not a good fit for this group of gals. I do remember his name, however I am not going to call him out, I usually think it's a training issue & o think this was the case here too!  He spoke quite fast & in a quiet tone.... I had to laugh as he finished speaking one of the gals commented she was gonna have some chicken dish, to which he replied \"we don't have any rice cooked\"  to which I whispered to her, put some water in a pan, heat to a boil etc. etc. anyway..... As we ordered he did say, they now can prepare her earlier request!!!! So she did have the chicken dish WITH RICE! The orders came out at the same time, however there were some mix ups ~ the good news was he had another server assisting him and she kinda took control. I did notice they put in the orders with hand held computers (which I hadn't noticed happening before) so this could have aided in the confusion~     Bone Fish is noted for the Bang Bang Shrimp! Usually OUTTA SITE! However my order was kinda like lightly deep fried without much sauce  and no I didn't send it back, there was already confusion & I didn't feel like adding to it plus it was fine, just not what it could have been~ My house salad was very ample with lots of good things on it, plus the balsamic dressing was excellent. My salad on my last visit, a Caesar was drenched in dressing.....not a good thing atleast for me....but the BANG BANG SHRIMP was DEVINE on that visit!!!!!    On the positive side my red wine sangria was very good, as usual~"}
{"text":"We had an excellent experience at the McCandless Bonefish on Saturday Even though they had a over a hour wait we received great service. The food was served on time, faster than we expected."}
{"text":"Just had a late lunch here today with my family. Service was excellent, food was outstanding and the atmosphere was relaxed and comfortable.    I had the filet and giant shrimp.  For the first time in a LONG time I was served a properly cooked rare steak.  Well seasoned and perfection.  Side were done right and the portion was excellent.   My wife's Mahi Mahi was also outstanding.  Garlic mashed are a spicy bit of creamy beauty.  5 stars.   Big surprise was the creme burlee. (sp?). This was as good as it gets.  A piece of art that feeds the soul.   Must try the chocolate version next!  My birthday is In a month and we are already sure this is the place for it!!!"}
{"text":"For my fathers birthday he decided to go to the bonefish grille. We had had high hopes but they were quickly dashed.   We had a shellfish allergy in our party and after making the server aware we ended up finding a shrimp in our appetizer that somehow mistakingly found its way onto the plate. This potentially life threatening mistake was treated very casually and without any apology.   After that the food came and a member of our dining party was handed a hot pad to retrieve her plate as the server handed it to her, a very awkward and unprofessional way to be served your meal.   All the waiters have iPads which takes away from the whole experience. Instead of being able to casually order no eye contact is made as they are too enthralled in ordering with the electronic device.   As far as the food is concerned it is less than appetizing to say the least. The sea bass was raw in the inside and the fish tacos were small and thin pieces of fish absolutely buried in an overly sweet mango salsa. Encasing the tacos was a stale tortilla.  The whole experience was utterly dismal.  We are going to have to redo my fathers birthday somewhere else as this was a severe disappointment or better yet cook at home!"}
{"text":"I recently went to Bonefish Grill for a friends birthday and I really enjoyed myself. It was Thursday so it wasnt super busy and we were seated quickly.  The servers were very attentive and knew the menu in and out.  The food came relatively fast and was fresh and enjoyable. I LOVE their calamari.  I would recommend trying this place out."}
{"text":"I ordered the salmon dinner which was supposed to have crab meat on top.   I ordered the garlic mashed potatoes and Steamed broccoli for my sides.  I got three florets of broccali, instant mashed potatoes, and a small mushy salmon that had one lousy crumb of crab.  I wold have had better food at Applebee's which isn't saying much.   Bottom line go somewhere else, hell pick your nose and eat your buggers.   Its also mushy and doesn't cost 50 bucks.   The bar tenders were great and they make drinks that will make you forget the dinner you tried to eat!"}
{"text":"We had the house salad, ribeye and the Chilean sea bass. The food was absolutely amazing and service was even better.  Dionne was our server and she was awesome!  We look forward to coming here again."}
{"text":"It was 4th of July weekend.  LongHorn could not accommodate our party of 9.  We called Bonefish Grill and they said to come right in.  When we got there, we were greeted and seated right away.  They wait staff were very warm and welcoming. They were very patient with the kids and our large group.  We did not feel rushed to place our order. They were very knowledgeable about how food is prepared. (i'm gluten-free, dairy-free.)  Although food was taking awhile to come out, we were understanding cause the restaurant was crowded due to the holiday. The wait staff was great at checking on is to bring us more bread (which my family loved) and refill our drinks.  I ordered Chilean sea bass, and it was moist and delicious.  The asparagus was crisp and tasty too.  I don't remember what everyone else ordered, but I do remember that everyone loved what they got.  Then when the waiters heard that 2 of the kids were celebrating their birthdays, they brought out treats with a candle for each birthday kid.  Very sweet.  Overall, it was a great experience.... great service, great food, good time with family,"}
{"text":"Start with the Bang Bang shrimp! Awesome! But for dinner....Chilean sea bass all the way!! SO GOOD! I couldn't figure out which sauce, so our waiter suggested trying all 5 on the side! They were all good!! So I just kept dipping in all of them! Be sure to get the truffle mac and cheese!! FANTASTIC!!! We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Not going back here again.    Why?    Left almost as hungry as we arrived.    Crab cake appetizer included two very small crab cakes, seriously extremely small.     Ordered the tuna as main course.    Very small as were The two sides I chose, potatoes au gratin and spinach.    All of this was not as bad as the tacky policy on bread.   Looking around, bread was sporadic on tables.     We never received any at our table.    When the waitress brought the check, I asked what the bread policy is.  She said totally surprised,  \"oh did you not receive any with your drinks.    I'm sorry.\" Uh no we didn't and you knew it.    Probably the first time ever that I've not tipped 20%.     Again, Never going back."}
{"text":"Very good, quality fish but could have used some seasoning, oysters are fresh and tasty, service was 5 star, it was opening day so hope that continues, managing partner John Barbosa was on hand and made us feel right at home and bought a round for us and others, someone who looked like the store manager was very attentive to the older ladies next to us but we just got a perfunctory hello, beautiful atmosphere, the people around us raved about the bang bang shrimp, will have to try that and the tuna tataki next time."}
{"text":"Was nice food very good service  The manager come and stop to ask  His name tony I see he care and professional  I visit this place weekly and I like how thy keep adding new items on the menu"}
{"text":"Overpriced disappointment. .  Let's start with how excited I was to try this place. Let's end with how I will never come back.  High price points...which would be fine if the food was with it.  Restaurant has great ambience, however the service was lack luster. Ordered the crab cakes (minor obsession) only to find out its more like shredded crab together on a plate. They don't even have the nerve to shape it like a cake.. wth... food was bland and servings were so small. Save some time and money and go to Stonecrab..."}
{"text":"Wow! Every time I think sea bass, I think Bonefish Grill! This place makes some amazing sea bass no matter how it's cooked and type of ingredients used. I usually order from their short list of specials to try what the chef has whipped up for the day.  The Miyosaki Sea Bass was the killer for the night that made the lobster tail look bad! The fish was marinated with misoyaki then grilled over oak. It has pickled ginger, sautéed spinach, mushrooms, and served with jasmine rice. All these flavors were splendid together.  And of course, there's their famous Bang Bang Shrimp that's how I started getting hooked with this place. Let me not forget their hand crafted martinis! I absolutely love the drinks here! The winter white cosmopolitan and the fall apple martini were an amazing drinks for the season before they disappear.  The service here is always impeccable! I love how it's a white coat service with fresh white chef coats that makes the environment extra special. The prices here are reasonable. They have awesome specials all the time like their Martini Monday or Bang Bang Shrimp $6 every Wednesday. Their offers online is also worth checking out. I can't wait to go back to see what's cooking on their specials for the day!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at many Bonefish restaurants, but was extremely disappointed in this one.  We decided to eat here because we always loved the bang bang shrimp.  I'm not sure how this one got it wrong, but they did.  The shrimp was that tiny frozen food bag kind with barely any sauce on it.  It was not good.  My wife had the fish tacos which were pretty good.  She said her salad was just ok.  I know I shouldn't expect much from a seafood restaurant as far as a burger goes, but fast food restaurants rivaled this one.  For the $10 \"Kobe\" burger, the first one that came out was a 4 oz burnt hockey puck.  I sent it back.  The next one was cooked well, but I was still shocked at the size of the burger - again it appeared to be about 4 oz.  even the dollar extra bacon was like deli sliced thin.  The only thing big was the bun.  The burger also came out with nothing on it - no special sauce, no mayo, no lettuce, no onion, no tomato.  Basically, no taste.  It did come with catsup on the side, but I think that was for the 6 or 7 fries that came with it.  Very disappointing since we  usually love this chain.  We won't be back I do not believe."}
{"text":"My grandma just loves this place and I am glad she does because it gives me a reason to splurge on myself.  While the prices are a bit steep for me to eat here regularly, I will say that the food served is worth the price.    Now, you are just plain cheating yourself if you do not try the Bang Bang Shrimp.  Try them as an appetizer or in the tacos.  Whatever you do, just try them.  If you have this year's Bucky Book, you have no excuse, as there is a \"Complimentary Bang Bang Shrimp\" coupon when you purchase an entree.  Outside of the Bang Bang Shrimp, I have tried the crab cakes, lobster stuffed shrimp, the Wagyu burger, truffle mac and cheese, and the spicy tuna bowl.  My tastebuds have not been disappointed once by my selections.    Ok.  Ok.  So the food is AH-MAZING.  What about the service and ambience?  Well, the decor is very light and elegant.  The lighting is dim and romantic.  Every server I have had has been attentive, helpful, and patient.  They know how to train their staff for sure!  Tonight the manager even stopped by our table (I believe he said his name was Casey) to make sure we were enjoying our experience.  It is always refreshing when management makes themselves apart of the atmosphere and chats with tables, rather than just coming around when there is a problem.  Bonefish Grill for the win!"}
{"text":"Nice place to be off the strip. They accommodated our party of 14 last minute, the staff were very courteous, food was excellent. We had the bang bang shrimp and calamari for appetizers and I had the Ribeye with crab fried rice; all were excellent! I don't know exactly what everyone in my party had but they were all pleased with their orders. I would highly recommend Bone Fish Grill and I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Delicious food, quiet atmosphere for a good visit and courteous wait staff. I ordered a pomegranate martini  and I could have had many more. I highly recommend for a business lunch or sophisticated dinner.  Lobster stuffed shrimp along with truffle mac as a side was a table favorite. Management even stopped by. A++"}
{"text":"Ok, we like this place, but we weren't real impressed. Now to the Defence of Bonefish, I just got fish and chips. Something I could have got at Capt D's for 1/2 the price. Not saying I was expecting something to blow me out of the water, but for the price they could have done something a tad out of the box. My wife's meal was good but nothing that said, \"We gotta come back to this place!!!!\" Service was good and was on point with drinks and the arrival of food."}
{"text":"Great food & service! Absolutely love the Bang Bang shrimp!!! Just loved it. For an entree I had the delicious tender, well seasoned grilled lamb chops. Perfection on a plate I must say...I also enjoyed the Wild OrchidHawaiian Martini cochtail which was recommended by our waiter. My overall experience here was incredible. I'm extremely happy that there is one close to my home when I returned Bach to the NY."}
{"text":"We were in the mood for seafood and this place was close to where we were staying.  We were seated quickly. Our server James was very attentive, bringing our drinks quickly and some warm ciabatta bread and olive oil to munch on while our food was prepared.  Hubby had the wood grilled rainbow trout, and I had the bang bang shrimp tacos. We also each had salads to accompany our meals which were delicious. We will definitely try the one in our hometown!!"}
{"text":"I have had dinner at other bonefish restaurants and it's been good, but this place sucks.  There were two other people complaining about their lunch while we were here.  On my cilantro lime salad with black beans and corn, there was literally a teaspoon full of corn and beans.  Description should be side salad with chicken.    I have 2 stars because the dressing and chicken was good."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times before. I've always been a fan of this restaurant, the food is of great quality, the drinks always fresh and right, and the servers are always very helpful with menu options. Each time I've visited bonefish (always in a different area) has been a pleasant one.   I recommend the bang bang shrimp for appetizer and for entree the tilapia or sea bass with the pan Asian sauce! For dessert if you are having a craving for chocolate, the flourless macadamia but brownie is melt in your mouth heaven!  All of these selections are so delicious you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try.  Food was pretty bland, 28 for a steak with no taste and the tilapia wasn't any better.  With so many other choices I don't think we would return."}
{"text":"Because I'm a vegetarian, this review should be taken with a grain of salt. I found the service to be good, the ambience nice and the food consistent.   The BANG BANG SHRIMP, of course, was a hit for most of the table. It was spicy, nicely fried and came with a decent portion size.   The free bread and herb oil was also very nice. The bread was soft inside and perfectly toasted outside, while the oil had enough flavor from the herbs to not be bland.   My TOMATO SOUP was nothing special. And the CAESAR SALAD was equally boring.   My husband's STEAK was perfectly cooked. He ordered two healthy veggie sides, and his overall meal was exactly what he was looking for. He travels for work and eats at high end steak houses all over the US, but he said this steak quality and cooking was on par with the best he's had.   The LOBSTER GRILLED CHEESE sandwich was enjoyed by another person in my group. I thought it appeared dry, but she liked it and said it had good lobster flavor.   The desserts were the most disappointing portion of the meal. The COCONUT PIE was recommended by the server. Beware that it is a warm cooked coconut pie with a thick layer of shredded coconut on top. The coconut was too thick to be nicely browned and toasted, so it ended up being hard to eat.   The KEY LIME PIE was the best of the three. It was tart and thick and creamy. But the crust was soggy - missed potential.   And the MACADAMIA NUT BROWNIE WITH ICE CREAM could not have been more generic. It was fine for a sweet bite to end the meal, but again, nothing special.   I find this place to be perfectly adequate, but not somewhere I'd crave or really want to return."}
{"text":"I've been to Bonefish Grill in Orlando (and had exceptional experiences) but hadn't tried either one yet in Charlotte.  We weren't disappointed.  I booked a reservation for a Saturday evening and, for being crowded, we were seated pretty quickly upon arrival.    The service was fantastic.  Our server was quick, attentive, and very knowledgeable.   Our food came one item after the other with little to no waiting.  To start, the complimentary bread with olive oil/pesto sauce was delicious.  Then came the superbly prepared calamari appetizer.  It was truly one of the best calamari dishes I've ever eaten.  It was very full of flavor with just a touch of spiciness.  Order extra dipping sauce, though!  It's so flavorful that you're going to want more for the big pile of calamari they serve!  Next came our unnecessary house salads.  I say unnecessary because with so much other food, we could have skipped the salad, but it was refreshing after the fried calamari.  Plus, it was more than just lettuce greens.  It contained some pricey items like kalamata olives, hearts of palm, and pine nuts so you definitely got your money's worth for only $2.80 to add to an entree.    Lastly was the entree.  I ordered the tuna steak -- rare -- with a chimichurri sauce (you can pick one of four sauces/flavors for your grilled fish).  It was so full of flavor.  We had made good choices all around.  Even the wine went down easy (although when doesn't it?).  Speaking of wine...they have a great, very reasonably priced wine list.  All in all, it was a great night out.  Bonefish offers a \"special night out\" feel, but not at the prices that you'd find at other seafood restaurants.  Don't be fooled into thinking that because Bonefish is a chain it's not good or not someplace to take a date or family visiting from out-of-town. It's truly worth it...and very affordable.  Although the atmosphere and decor wasn't as \"modern\" as the Bonefish I had been to in Orlando, it was still steps above other seafood chains like Red Lobster or Joe's Crab Shack.  And for the amount of food and its taste, as well as the exceptional service, you'll feel like you got a bargain!  In today's economy, that's a good thing!"}
{"text":"Rating is from original review.  Just wanted to acknowledge that I was contacted via e-mail by Bonefish Grill customer service.  In the e-mail they were very apologetic and said they would send me something.  I did receive 2 - $25 'gift cards'.  I thought this was a nice gesture.  But what bothered me was what was said in the e-mail:  \"The next time you dine with us, please speak with a manager at the beginning of your meal so they can ensure your experience is a great one.\"  And here was my response to that 'suggestion':  \"I find it a bid odd that you suggest that on my next visit to \"speak with a manager at the beginning of your meal so they can ensure your experience is a great one.\"   One shouldn't have to speak to anyone at a restaurant in order to have a great experience.  It should be part of the 'routine' service.  Just my opinion.\""}
{"text":"It's nothing special but a good chain restaurant. I think they are a little overpriced for what you get and definitely not great. I'll try it again I'm sure but it's not a favorite and I love seafood."}
{"text":"We were in the area and actually wanted to go to an Italian place but the wait time there would have meant we'd miss our movie so we came here. I'm so glad we did! It was petty full but we got a table really quickly. The bread with pesto was delicious, crusty on the outside and soft on the inside! Freshly baked too! We started with the wagyu beef sliders which were good, but even better when drizzled with lemon! I had the lobster stuffed shrimp which was heavenly! Yum yum! The potatoes au gratin were a break from the classic but good nonetheless, the breadcrumbs really took them to another level. Hubby had the sea bass from the grill with pesto sauce, the bass was cooked perfectly and his side's of garlic whipped potatoes and crab fried rice were scrumptious!! I'm not sure why this place has v just 3.5 stars because the food was great but the service was amazing too! Definitely with a try!!"}
{"text":"Best place to eat great seafood. I've been going to Bonefish for multiple years now and it always gets better. Started off with the Bang Bang Shrimp which never disappoints. I ordered a Caesar Salad with anchovies, hands down the best Caesar I've ever had anywhere. I had the Swordfish with jalapeño bacon cream for my entree. This was so delicious. It was cooked perfectly with amazing flavor. This is the first time I've ever had swordfish and I will for sure be ordering it again in the future. And to end the meal I split a creme brûlée with my wife. She's obsessed with it and I don't blame her. I have yet to find a restaurant that does their creme brûlée like Bonefish does."}
{"text":"This place (this location) is inconsistent with the taste of the food and the options. My family and I have been here twice for Sunday Brunch, the first trip was a HIT with the Orange Grand Manier French Toast and a $5 Mimosa which was standard. We went back the next Sunday and the french toast was over cooked, my daughter burger bleeding when she ordered it WELL DONE, my husband had hair in his food and we had a SHI&&Y waiter who only came over to take our order and to drop the check. We had to go grab a manager to send our food back.."}
{"text":"I was super excited that they opened another Bonefish Grill in Las Vegas, after the location on Easten closed a few years ago.    Came here with a few girlfriends to have some beers and appetizers.  It was even better than I remembered, and I am thrilled about the patio!  Always looking for new places to drink outdoors.    We went on a Wednesday, which is Bang Bang Shrimp night - you can get this appetizer for $5 from 4-11pm on Wednesdays.  Those shrimp are delicious!   We also got the ahi tuna appetizer, beef dumpling appetizer, and crab cakes which were all very good.  We ordered a side of the au gratin potatoes because they looked like macaroni and cheese, and they were amazing cheesy goodness.    Can't wait to go back and see if all the entrees are just as I remember!"}
{"text":"The service here was exceptional. They went out of their way to make sure we were comfortable on the patio before our entire party arrived for dinner. Even if it wasn't our primary server stopping by the manager would check in on us to see if we were doing well. I've actually been to bonefish in Raleigh a couple times but never this location. For a chain their food is,especially the fish dishes, is well prepared and spot on every time. This trip I just had the fish and chips but it was some of the best I've ever had. Not too much breading, too oily or to over/under cooked. For appetizers we had some calamari and a stuffed dumpling with ginger sauce that was both prepared and presented at top notch standards. The little bread basket they brought out was even out of this world. Bread was super fresh and not stale or tough. Anyways, this is a spot you should for sure check out when you get a chance."}
{"text":"I usually give a restaurant 2-3 visits before passing judgement. We have now visited Bonefish Grill 3 times. This is how it went down..  First visit: Made dinner reservation for party of 6. Arrived on time and was told by the army of staff standing at the front door that it would be about 10 min. We were sat in about 10 min. Once we sat down we waited about 10 min or so before a server asked for our drink order. Once engaged the service was ok. Everyone enjoyed their food from the Mahi to fish and chips and drinks but it was not a great visit as many items ordered were not brought to to the table including my salad. First visit had some bumps but I gave them a pass on these as I know sh@# happens sometimes. The table next to us was really pissed about something and it took what seemed like forever for a manager to come over and help a waitress who seemed to be on the verge of crying.  Second visit: No reservations made but we called while driving to the restaurant \"5 min drive\" and were told there was no wait. Arrived around 5PM and it seems about 20-30 people showed up in that 5 minutes as there was a small town of people trying to find somewhere to wait. We were told the wait would be 15-20 min so we took our pager and went outside to the patio. 10 min after sitting a server came over and offered us drinks. This guy was on it and did his best to keep us full of booze as we waited which is a good thing as it kept us from walking out. 40 min into our 15-20 min wait I noticed people that arrived after us started getting seated. I then went to the greeter and made mention that we are 20min past our original estimated wait time and that people that arrived after us were being seated. I asked a couple inside how long they had been waiting and they said 1 hr on a 20 min estimate by the host. The host then said we were next and it would be no more than 5 more min. 15 min later our pager went off. We were seated to a dining room that had many empty tables. Many of these tables were never filled during our visit and the waiting area stayed packed. Like our first visit the food was good. This time nothing was missed. We did however witness a couple tables around us get food very very late and I did see a couple complain to a manager so it seems that service can be hit or miss.  Third visit: we stopped by on a Friday night around 6pm and we were told the wait would be 60 min. Remembering our last wait this most likely meant that we would eat around 8pm so we went across the street where we had 0 wait and a great meal.   Summary: Good food, average service, poor management. Make sure you have a reservation on the weekend. This place really needs someone who knows how to run a restaurant to get the operation issues resolved. This place has 4-5 star potential."}
{"text":"Thought the food and service was good. Came alone on a sunday.night because the.wife had the kids so i figured why not right? Definitely not dissapointed with the bang bang shrimp and i ordered the filet with a side lobster tail. Both cooked perfect. Only down side is they forgot the tail so i enjoyed that after i finished the steak, potatoes and sautéed spinach. The waiter was really nice and was energetic. Big reason i always come back, good food, good service and good prices for what you get."}
{"text":"Honestly, I had my reservations since this place seemed very \"chain\" restaurant and I prefer trying out small private owned places but we needed a place to eat before catching a show that would fulfill my son's need for a surf and turf without breaking the bank. Much to my pleasant surprise, this place hit all the right notes. Seated immediately when we arrived at our reservation time, food was good and service even better. My Moscow Mule had a nice kick and the check was more than reasonable, actually down right great for the amount of food we ate. Would definitely come back here!"}
{"text":"Really bad service The food is always overcook, no flavor, I think the cooks don't know how to cook, the Tuna always looks old no red color,  nice concept but the owners need to get a new management, every time I visit this place something wrong happens."}
{"text":"This is a really nice place for seafood also the atmosphere is so lovely here. The location of this place was just near my house so I loved being here. Bang bang shrimp is the authentic dish and must have everyone but The quantity is less but one should have it. Also the desserts are amazing here. I had a good experience with this location of bonefish grill."}
{"text":"Had dinner on Saturday night with wife in the bar area.  Host was able to seat us in a booth and we had a great time with our server Will.  I had the dumpling appetizer and fontina pork chops.  Wife had new corvina fish.  Had some kind of special topping that she can't remember the name of, but it was awesome.  We frequent this location because the food is good and the staff remember you."}
{"text":"WHAT?!?!?! $20 for bottomless cocktails AND breakfast at the Sunday Brunch?!?!?! Who are you right now?!?!?! I live in LA, $20 doesn't even buy you the Uber to GET TO the boozy brunch. I could seriously come here every Sunday. My homie Danny the manager is so nice and personable, he definitely makes you feel welcome and will know you by name if you go a few times! Wednesday night had a really good $5 menu.   I'm from the east coast so, sorry, but y'all are a little late to the Bonefish party. Yes, I know this restaurant is good, yes, I'm familiar with the bang bang shrimp. HOWEVER: boozy Sunday brunch for $20 is the bee's knees. I'm just saying. You don't have to try it out. But if you do I'll probably be there."}
{"text":"This place was great. We go to restaurants often and I was very impressed by this one. I visited March 25, 2016.  We didn't have reservations but they got us in. This s a somewhat upscale restaurant but not over-the-top. They had a deal of $50 for two dinners, Bang Bang Shrimp and a desert. The dinner selections were shrimp, steak, lobster and fish combinations. The dinners alone ranged between $20 and $28 alone, so this was a good deal.   The food was good, and we brought some home so not small portions. Other people talked about poor service here, but we didn't see any of that. I'd even say the service was one of the best. We had a main waiter but others checked on us again. My soda glass never sat empty for long.   While this isn't a place we would go to all the time, as prices are moderately high but certainly not bad for a splurge. We WILL go back, which honestly is not something we say often. A great value for this price restaurant. And my wife said the Key Lime Pie was the best she ever had."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try out Bonefish Grill for date night.  I am not a huge seafood fan but I love a good filet mignon which I noticed they had on the menu.  We called ahead to get our name on the list which ended up being a fantastic idea as there was a 45 minute wait by the time we got there for anyone who hadn't called in.  We waited about 15 minutes for our table (which was in the bar area but was totally fine).  We had a lovely waitress which I wished I had gotten her name but I didn't.  She was very soft spoken and truly made us feel like we were her one and only table (which I am sure we weren't as they were very busy but she never made us feel rushed).  I ordered the filet mignon with mashed potatoes and broccoli and my husband had the \"Catch of the Day\" which was sea scallops.  Our food came relatively quickly and I was very relieved that the \"garlic\" mashed potatoes are really not very garlicky.  They are very comparable to Longhorn's mashed potatoes.  My filet mignon, on the other hand, was not the greatest.  It had tough lines of fat in it and was chewy.  It was by far the toughest filet mignon I have ever had (and I've had quite a few).  My husband loved his sea scallops though and the bread with oil and herbs they give out is great.  I had the blueberry lemon drop as a night cap and it was divine.  Super yummy.  Overall it was a fine evening.  My steak was disappointing but I am hoping it was just a bad cut and not their norm.  I look forward to giving them another try."}
{"text":"Last two visits were a total disaster.  Both times our food took over an hour to arrive. Both times other tables who were seated after us received their food while our server apologized. Both times when the food finally arrived it was inedible.  Never coming here again."}
{"text":"Very nice environment. Good bread, soup, and wide selection of chicken, fish, and meat. Good service and reasonably prized."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner on Christmas Eve. It was busy, but nothing too crazy. We were told about a thirty minute wait that turned in to an hour. However, we counted at least five tables that were sitting dirty that could have been cleaned off and turned. No big deal though. It was a nice atmosphere and had very nice decor.   It took about ten minutes to receive our sangrias (blackberry sangria is delicious!) and a bottled beer from the bar. The beer came without a glass, while other tables who had ordered a bottled beer received a glass, and some of our sangrias came with straws while others did not. Need to get together the consistency of their presentation.   The food was good. My salad entree came out as an app, but that was no big deal. I also ordered the coconut shrimp, which was pretty good! I used the dipping sauce from the calamari we ordered as an app, which I prefer over the sweet chili sauce they drizzle on top.   Refills on drinks were very hard to come by, and food came out very slowly even though the traffic in the restaurant had died down significantly. No one really checked up on us to see how the food was tasting, and one of the entrees was actually missing a side; which we never received even though the lady who dropped off our food said she would be right back with it.   What I thought was weird is every thing that came to the table (drinks, app, entrees, and check) were all delivered by different people. It didn't feel very personable, like we were kind of a community for whoever isn't busy to take care of. I understand this is a newer restaurant within the last month or two, but some of these kinks should be worked out by now. Food was good, but the personable service touch isn't there and everything was waaaay too slow. Now don't get me wrong, everyone was friendly and food tasted good. But if you chose to go here, make sure you have some time to kill and lots to chat about over your empty drinks. :/"}
{"text":"My wife and I really enjoyed this new restaurant. We are a professional couple who is always looking out for a great place to get dinner. We were pleasantly surprised at how nice this place was.   Believe it or not there are not a lot of seafood places close to Town Square. Our waiter was just awesome and very knowledgable.  I would highly recommend this place to friends and family.   One suggestion is that you need to try and do more to tell people about you guys. We just got lucky by driving by.  Thanks again and see you soon!...:)"}
{"text":"Bonefish Grill is Bang Bang Delicious  This review is for Bonefish Grill, 6527 Las Vegas Blvd, Las Vegas, NV 89119, 702-407-0980, for a visit on July 22, 2017.  It's located in Town Square.  I first heard of this restaurant when I earned Reward Points through visits to Outback Steakhouse.  It is one of several restaurants where the discount Rewards coupon can be used.  I read a few reviews and decided to use my coupon there.  I attended the restaurant with my adult son Richard.  We entered the dining room at 6pm and were offered a table or booth.  We chose a table in the center of the room.  The ambiance was wonderful, carrying over the open yet rich interior design from the bar area, onto cloth covered tables.  I love that the restaurant has great lighting.  I hate eating in the dark or struggling to read a menu in minimal lighting.  Keep in mind it is summertime and the sun does not set until 8pm.  I imagine, after sunset, the restaurant probably offers a romantic lighting.  Upon being seated, our server \"Billy Balantine\" immediately brought us menus and filled our water glasses with cool water.  Water at the table is such a highlight in Vegas during the overheated summer, and I was glad to see that we did not have to order it or ask for it.  The menu was only one page front and back, plus a short Summer Specials menu on the table, but the offerings were more than adequate.  Most of the menu comprised of seafood delicacies including Chilean Sea Bass $30, Rainbow Trout $20, and Filet with Lobster special for only $22.  Keep in mind that this restaurant presents itself in an atmosphere of upper class gourmet yet the prices are only moderate. While we looked over the menu, our server \"Billy\" kept up a lively banter, answered all our questions about menu items and made several great suggestions.  The first item we ordered was the Bang Bang Shrimp appetizer $12.  People raved about it online, so we had to try it.  \"Billy\" stated it was a customer favorite for which they received tons of orders.  Within minutes, literally minutes, \"Billy\" returned with our order and a plate of bread and oil dip.  The bread was a wonderful soft crusted sourdough with a side of garlic oil that was devoured so quickly by the two of us that we worried we might not have room left for dinner.  The Bang Bang Shrimp did not disappoint either.  We quickly gobbled that up too.  It had a wonderful flavor that was a little bit spicy and simply delicious.  I could have made a meal out two or three orders of just Bang Bang Shrimp and the delicious bread.  [Hint:  If you can't afford moderately priced restaurants for a full meal, I suggest going during Happy Hour, purchasing a couple of $5 drinks at the bar, carry them to your table, then order two Bang Bang Shrimp appetizers with bread, and really make it a meal.  It will only cost you about $40 for two people.]  For our main courses, my son chose the Chilean Sea Bass and had another Blueberry Lemon Drop $10.50 (tableside).  I had to try it.  The bass was so tender it fell apart in huge flakes of perfect white meat.  I took one bite before my son shooed me away, and it was a flavor burst in my mouth.  You could taste distinct flavors of seasoning and lemon, that seemed separate yet blended.  You could taste four different flavors along with the delicate fish' own flavor that was just exquisite.  I began to wish I had ordered the same item.  Instead, I had ordered the Rainbow Trout along with ice tea.  I'm a bit picky when it comes to trout.  I like it pan fried, but that was not an option,  Everything here is grilled, hence the name \"Bonefish Grill.\"  I still tried to get it the way I wanted.  I asked for the trout to be grilled hard on the skin side to crisp it, and also requested it blackened (meaning cajun spiced).  It seems these requests could not be filled, but the dish was stiull very good and a fair sized portion.  I recently had trout at \"Cracker Barrel\" and found it to be a bit slimy, flavorless, and the portion was one small side fillet about 2\" x 4\" in size.  Barely a mouthful or two.  The portion at \"Bonefish\" was two full fillet sides about 3\" x 5\" in size.  I only ate half and took the rest home for  a second meal later.  Both meals came with a selection of two sides.  We both chose the same sides: Garlic Whipped Potatoes ($4) and Crab Fried Rice ($6). The potatoes were so yummy and so was the rice.  Whoever heard of Crab Fried Rice?  It was a nice sized portion and so flavorful.  Just yummy!  The total bill was $88, minus our Rewards coupon for $20, and we were left with balance of $68 with our savings covering the whole tip for our excellent server.  My Ratings: Ambiance 5 star Service        5 star Food  5 star Overall  5 stars"}
{"text":"Great food, great service.  Only downfall, was half of the menu was not available.  They ran out on the weekend.  Hello we were there on a Tuesday.  Again, isn't it called projecting????  Waitress said it happens all the time.  What they did have available was delicious."}
{"text":"Stopped in for happy hour again. Seems their food just keeps getting blander & blander.Ordered up the Bang Bang Shrimp Tacos on the happy hour menu. Just batter fried shrimp with an orangish sauce on it that wasn't even spicy at all. Same sauce seemed to go on the Sriracha Pepper Chicken (crispy chicken tossed in a creamy, spicy sauce) that a friend ordered which again was not spicy in the least. I think the tacos would have been better had they a cole slaw mix instead of the lettuce. And mine seemed to be missing the sour cream which was ok since there was no spice to it & that would have made it even more bland. Tuesday & Thursday they have all sorts of Lobster deals & another friend ordered some of them & she said they were just ok. Not really sure I'll go back again with the way the food tasted. Would rather spend my $$ somewhere else."}
{"text":"This was our first time here and it was to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary. The food was excellent, waitress did a great job serving us and the dessert was a perfect ending"}
{"text":"Mediocre quality ingredients, all farmed fish and grain-fed beef. The foods in the dishes just didn't really meld together and the plates that came out all had some differences from how they were listed on the menu. The staff was very good, the place was clean and the service was fine. All the negatives lie with the food. Overall, I wouldn't come here again.   Had the cobb salad and the swordfish special with bacon and spinach. The dressing on this salad was just terrible. It was okay on its own, but combined with the rest of the salad the flavors just did not work well together at all. The swordfish was \"eh\", the bacon and spinach were a disappointment. I have high expectations of bacon. The spinach had a poor texture and flavor."}
{"text":"Not bad.Probably better than you would expect from a chain restaurant.  Good food for a reasonable price.  Got free Bang Bang Shrimp coupon from their Facebook, which we thought was a good deal. Enjoyed sirloin steak / crab cakes combo and scallops with shrimp. The portion was generous."}
{"text":"Understaffed this hurts customer service forgetting the bread and serving ice cold asparagus.  Is not going to make this location very desirable. However the Hawaiian martini  is delicious. bathroom needed toilet paper and hand towels. Thankful they had soap"}
{"text":"Bad from the start..We went here for Valentine's Day with a reservation, our table wasn't ready in time. We sit down and ordered two appetizers bang bang shrimp and crab cakes. The shrimp comes out but the crab cakes doesn't and had to wait longer for them because they waitress forgot to order it. Then I ordered the Caribbean Cobia special while pointing to it on the special sheet which was supposed to come with coconut, grilled pineapple grilled shrimp and pineapple salsa, my meal came with none of that just the fish and two sides I ordered. We also ordered two house salads and never got those either until the middle of our meal after saying anything. I usually love bonefish but this kinda service is unacceptable.. how could all those things be forgotten in one visit?!"}
{"text":"Service was fine but the place wreaked of fish and my trout was old. Won't go back."}
{"text":"Great spot for happy hour! We went in last night (martini Monday who knew?) so all their martini's were on happy hour. We sat with John, bless his heart we were a handful! Haha and he rocked it! Well done John and thank you Chris behind the bar for some yummy drinks! We have been here before for happy hour and the menu has gotten a lot smaller. For example they used to have their bang bang shrimp on happy hour but now they don't. Kind of a shame it was yummy. But you can still order it as it's on their regular menu. Anywho what we did have was pretty good. The boys had a couple wagu sliders, which they both really liked, then the cod sliders were also very tasty! The calamari was a little weak which was a shame because it looked good coming out of the kitchen with all the tentacles and rings but we liked the sauce!  And the mussels were slightly cold and so we sent them back and they nuked them and sent them back to the table. All in all this spot got a 4 star because of our great service! We had fun and the people next to us in the bar at a family style table were a hoot!"}
{"text":"This place is always a family favorite, especially for birthdays! Im big on seafood and love coming here since it is in the heart of summerlin, very convenient & nice dinning experience. Last night we celebrated my birthday on a Friday night and made reservations prior. Since they are so busy weekend nights the hostess informed me that the latest they can tend to us is 7:30 almost 8, out of the question since that is a late dinner time for my mother. Got off the phone to think of another way almost 10 minutes later someone cancelled at 6 and the hostess was gracious enough to call me back to make the reservation earlier & help accommodate us. Very impressed with their great customer service!!   -The Tilapia Imperial is a favorite, can customize your sides - I enjoy the fish & chips the batter is light & airy -Cant go wrong with bang-bang shrimp tacos, a very more affordable meal offered on their menu compared to the rest   *Pictured Most of us did the 'pick 2' meal - $50 -Bang-bang shrimp appetizer - 2 specials off the menu (I did, snapper & oscar style sauce)  -And dessert which we all chose something different to share, my new favorite is the coconut pie with rum sauce. Me and my brother agree it tastes like a Filipino dessert or more like a bread pudding.  .. Of course the bread is delicious enough it can fill you up!"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to happy hour with my friends. Sat in bar area at family style table. No service. Had to stop Manager, Andrew, to get a server. Andrew was great, placed my order and sent over server, Eston. Eston was great. Did what he was supposed to do and upsold me on $11 per glass red wine. After we closed out, apparently thats when service ends. I had to get another server to place a to go order, Salmon superfood salad. Glad I checked order before leaving, missing avocado. So additional wait to get avocado. Overall, food was good. Service not on point. SN, nothing was comped."}
{"text":"Great service! Healthy and Delicious meals (or unhealthy if you choose). I would definitely return if I'm in the area, but don't see me making the trip from Henderson otherwise. Quiet but comfortable atmosphere. Clean restaurant and clean bathrooms. If you are nearby, it could turn into a regular night out kind of place."}
{"text":"Food was very good.   Way understaffed. We arrived at 6pm on a Tuesday. We were seated right away.  Didn't receive our dinner until 7:15 and they brought me the wrong entree.  Brought the correct one out right away.  Food was awesome.   But they really need to work on their service."}
{"text":"With a new menu roll-out and a $10 off coupon from their website, I came in to see what Bonefish Grill was all about. Menu features a limited number of (mostly) healthy, fish-focused dishes, prices range from $13-ish for lunch items to averaging $30 for fish dinner entrees.  Started with a house salad with a pleasant citrus vinaigrette before the FISH AND CHIPS. Batter on the fish was a little bland, but the tartar sauce really complemented the fish- lemony, lots of herbs, good consistency. Fries were average.  FIRE GRILLED RAINBOW TROUT was stellar- large portion, beautifully crisp skin, flavorful with a light lemon-butter, and served with sweet snap peas and French green beans. Fresh, healthy, flavorful.  Service was interesting... our server took quite a while to get out to us. Another employee helped us with drinks and bread but was unable to take our order when we were ready, insisting we wait for our elusive designated server. When he noticed that I was taking photos of my food, he made some odd comments about secret shoppers.  Overall, food was very fresh and the menu has a lot of healthy options. Restaurant itself seemed busy enough and we had no major issues with service. Interior is nice and slightly upscale, patio seating available. \"Bar Bites\" HH discounts available at the bar only, 3-6PM."}
{"text":"For a chain restaurant, this was a pleasant experience. Nikki was a fantastic server. She was attentive and helpful. She made some good suggestions and gave us plenty of time to peruse the menu. She didn't offer us a happy hour menu, which she did to the table behind us, so that was kind of disappointing since we had already ordered our drinks, but all in all that's ok.  My husband had the rainbow trout which was excellent! I had the seasonal sword fish with pumpkin ravioli which was just ok.   While I go really don't like chain restaurants, we will come back here. It's a convenient location, the service was great, and the food was descent."}
{"text":"UTTERLY DISGUSTING!! The night started out great. We were seated fast with a reservation.  The waitress was knowledgeable and fast.  Our apps arrived hot and everything was going great until a huge roach decided to take a shortcut across our table.  I immediately called the hostess, who in turn ran and got the manager.  The manager came back red faced and apologetic. She acknowledged the pest problem and said it was due to construction out back.  That was of little consolation to me.  I couldn't help but think where else those little critters might be.   I would never go back there again.  EVER!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went to lunch at Bonefish with my husband and was very impressed.  The restaurant was very clean and nicely decorated.  The food was delicious!  We split the lobster stuffed shrimp appetizer,  a bowl of crab corn chowder,  and the bang bang shrimp tacos with a side of crab fried rice.  Very impressed with all the food and will definitely return again."}
{"text":"I have tried many items on the menu and they have all been well prepared.  Bang Bang Shrimp is a great appetizer.  Some menu items change every few months which brings new items to try.  Where they lose stars with me is the service.  It is really hit and miss.  During busy times there are a lot of employees around but they seem do be doing everything but taking care of guests.  I really like this place and go there a couple of times a month but the service has to improve and speed up."}
{"text":"i really hate to update my review with a poor rating, but tonight sucked.   at first it wasn't bad. we showed up around 9:15 and were seated immediately. i ordered some potstickers and they were good enough. then our original server decided she was too tired and she was replaced by another server. while this new server was nice enough, this is where it started to fall apart.  we ordered our meals. Danielle got salmon and i got ahi tuna, both with the pan-asian sauce. when the meals came out neither of us had the sauce and had to ask for it while our food got cold.  well, \"got cold\" may be redundant as my tuna was seared very rare. i'd asked for medium and it was nowhere near it. and it was ice cold.  Danielle's salmon was also undercooked. while i said nothing and just ate my rare tuna, Danielle did mention that she wanted a box for her fish because it was not cooked enough to her liking. the server didn't seem to care and just got the box. no apology. no offer to remove her dinner from our bill or even discount our bill. just brought a box and our bill then disappeared again when all we wanted to do at that point was leave.  we finally paid and got out of there and both of us agreed that we're going to take a lengthy break from Bonefish Grill for a while.  ironically, Danielle's parents and sister's family are in Orlando tonight and also ate at Bonefish and it sounds like they also had a bad night. though that hasn't been confirmed."}
{"text":"Hate to say ... this is one of the worst Bonefish grille's EVER, from a service standpoint.  The food is good, it's a Bonefish grille quality and selection.  We made the mistake of showing up without a \"reservation\" on a Friday night at 6:15pm.  Honestly I wasn't even aware that they now even took reservations!  It's a Bonefish Grille?  We waited 1 hr and 40 minutes to eat dinner (our bad for waiting).  It doesn't matter if it was good or bad, we waited 1 hr and 40 minutes ---- it will NEVER be that good! Done here, will never return.  3 strikes at this place - I'm out.  Too much bad that I could write, I will just leave it at that.  My suggestion - Drive 5 minutes West to ChillFire Grill in Denver, better food, better service, better price, better experience -- hands down."}
{"text":"After hearing so much about this place, we finally had a chance to visit for and early Valentines Day date night. The reason I rated a 2-star was because of the sodium content in both entrees. It was incredibly salty almost unbearable. I should have made a complaint but we were having such a romantic moment that I just could ruin it. We ordered the Chilean Sea Bass and the Filet with lobster stuffed shrimp. The sea bass was flavorful but salty. Don't order the filet with lobster stuff shrimp, you will be disappointed. The shrimp were small (you would think for a fish house they would serve jumbo tiger shrimp) and there was disappointing portions of lobster meat. The fact is that the shrimp were too small to stuff with lobster meat. Too bad for me as I was really looking forward to it. The filet was cooked just right (Melted in my mouth) but the masala sauce was way too salty and the mash potato was unbearably salty that I didn't even eat it. I hope this was an oversight or there was a cook in training because someone didn't check the spice portions or taste the food. Needless to say, there were some bright spots. The appetizer, Bang Bang Shrimp was amazing. I should have ordered two servings and I would have been completely satisfied. Served on a bed of spring mix, the spice, pea nutty sauce was simple delicious. The chopstick were a plus as a utensil. The bread was to die for...with the garlic infuse olive oil and pesto based spices. Lastly, the chocolate Crème Brule was yummy. If you want a private space, ask the host don't settle for other tables as they are extremely close. Without a good experience with appetizer, bread, dessert and my hot date (wife), I would have given it a 1-star."}
{"text":"I was really pumped up to be impressed... But no so much.  It's like the menu had such potential, but execution was average.  I was excited about the Blackberry Smash beverage, but once I got it it wasn't sweet enough or strong enough, it was like blackberries put in water.  It was basically a watered-down version of a blackberry Izze, if there is such a thing.  The Bang Bang shrimp had a glaze on them that gave them a somewhat pleasant texture but severely lacked flavor.  Their broccoli was heavenly though."}
{"text":"Superb entrée selections with fresh seafood. I only drink water and there's is totally awesome!! Not just any regular city tap water. Bang bang shrimp is a must!!!"}
{"text":"This place was good & I'm happy we decided to eat here. Our steaks were cooked well & the service we received from Denise was great! My husband always had a full drink & she was prompt. We enjoyed our meal & the ambience."}
{"text":"Why did I wait so long?!  During a lunch date with my wife I decide to see what all the hype was about for Bonefish Grill.  We both started off with the fresh lemonade and let me tell you it was great and quite refreshing which is saying a lot as I usually don't even like lemonade.   Next after seeing it go by our table so many times we went with the Bang, Bang Shrimp appetizer. The shrimp were perfected cooked with just enough of a kick to keep you wanting more. They were so good I wanted to order more.   For our entrees we both went with the tacos. I had steak and the she had fish.  My tacos were so good. The steak was juicy and tender and full of flavor. The prices are very reasonable for the quality of the food.  Our server Melanie was great and very patient as it took us a while to decide what to order as it was our first time there.  My only complaint is that there is no Bonefish Grille on the East Side. Cough, Monroeville! Cough, The Waterfront! Hell, I'd even take one in Southside Works or Ross Park Mall!"}
{"text":"Wow. This was truly the first time I've been to a restaurant where you can say they don't have cooks -- they have Chefs. Master Chefs. The food was incredible. I used to not understand foodies, because really, food all tastes the same -- decent or horrible. Until I came here. The food is elevated and delectable, the presentation is eye-catching, and the price was surprisingly affordable. The server was super-nice, and he explained everything, he double-checked with the kitchen on food allergy-issues. I was totally blown away by this place. I can't wait to go to Vegas again, so we can have another wonderful meal here!"}
{"text":"Came here for a company dinner and had an excellent experience. The prices were reasonable for the type of food they serve. The wine list was commensurate with the food served and excellent choices. I had the two lobster tails and pumpkin ravioli. Both were well prepared but I didn't enjoy the onion topping on the ravioli. Service was good and our waitress was very engaged with us and she took very good care of our group. A wonderful experience overall."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to stop in today for lunch and they gave us a brunch menu...we had looked online before we went in and were disappointed that we didn't get a lunch menu.  I told the waitress we weren't going to stay because we really didn't like anything on the brunch menu and she promptly found out if we could order from the lunch menu instead... And YaY! We were able to! We both ordered the cilantro lime shrimp salad.  He got salmon instead of shrimp and I asked for mine to be gluten free.  Wow this salad was simply DELISH!  Everything was so fresh and so flavorful.  My shrimp was grilled to perfection and his salmon was a nice thick piece. It is a little spendy, but for the area not too bad.  The decor was beautiful and the service fantastic.  We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"We arrived at the restaurant on Friday after Thanksgiving the restaurant was fairly empty so we got excellent service getting to the table right away and the service was excellent for the whole meal and the food was excellent. I had the Kobe beef hamburger which I rated excellent even it was rather greasy. About an ounce or two of grease dripped out of it. But the burger was very tasty and did not taste greasy. The homemade chips were considered excellent by all. The fish and chips were \"the bomb\". Note: the chips were not British style, but we're the same homemade style.  The fish tacos were excellent. Our server frequently refreshed our drinks so unobtrusively I didn't notice she had been there many times. All in all we were very pleased with the food and service.  The cost of the meal came out to about $17 per person including tip. No alcoholic drinks were consumed. We would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Officially decided to celebrate my birthday dinner here with my boyfriend who lucky for me had never been so it was a very exciting trip for both of us.  Ok on to the good stuff!   You MUST start with the bang bang shrimp...they are the perfect mix of sweet and spicy! And the size of the order is great! So full of flavor and heat an absolute treat! All the previous reviews are correct...they are a must have if you visit this restaurant!  Also the Pomegranate martini is so yummy...sweet and refreshing topped with frozen grapes...it was just wonderful!   For our meals, my boyfriend chose the Shrimp and scallops and I decided on the crab cakes as a dinner...now you won't find this dinner on the menu but ask for it because they will create it just for you! It comes with two crab cakes and is paired with either a soup or salad.  The shrimp and scallops were delicious, cooked perfectly and paired with one or all of the side sauces they offer. We chose the pan Asian and lemon butter which are both heavenly! The pan asian is sweet and spicy and was great on the scallops and the lemon butter just really enhanced the taste of the shrimp. However, encourage you to try all the sauces!   The crab cakes are filled with so much crab it's absolutely wonderful! They come with a wonderful sauce that adds a bit of \"spicy\" to the cakes! The taste is just to delicious to fully describe...try them! You will not regret it! Yum!  Our server was wonderful! she made sure we had everything we needed, checked to make sure our food was ok and even brought out a dessert box with delicious chocolate with sprinkles and dried strawberries on top!  I absolutely loved the experience, the food and the service!   Everything about this restaurant was wonderful...they did an outstanding job!!!"}
{"text":"Steak was well priced and tasted amazing. Service was great! I have been here twice and love their food!"}
{"text":"I went to this establishment with a number of coworkers while in the area. The atmosphere was nice and there was adequate seating. My filet was excellently prepared!  Our server, Morgan, was extremely friendly and provided great suggestions for appetizers. I would absolutely go back next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"As many reviews on here mention, the bang bang shrimp is quite delicious and definitely a great way to start the meal. Food is overall very good, haven't had anything on the menu I didn't like.   They have a bottomless bubbles brunch special and while the mimosas are average, what keeps me coming back is the sangria, so good!  If if wasn't for mediocre service I would give them 5 stars. Every time I go it seems like it takes a long time for the wait staff to take the drink order, apps/entree, and continue to check back. I've learned just to be ready with everything you want to order the first time they come around or you end up doing a lot of waiting."}
{"text":"The bang bang is bangin'! Perfectly cooked breaded shrimp with a little kick to it. Paired perfectly with the blackberry sangria. Perfect place to come in for casual dining with amazing fish and seafood options. The crab crusted Alaskan cod is amazing! Must try!"}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal at bonefish. Went for my birthday and the oysters I had were great I was very surprised as good oysters are hard to come by."}
{"text":"I love this location. The food is really great and the staff is fantastic. This is our new got to go to place for date night."}
{"text":"Came hungry! Ordered the King Salmon. It arrived severely over cooked. Even my server agreed. The Dynamite Sauce is tasty, but suffered the same fate as the salmon. I dont often send food back, but this was a real disappointment since it's a place that specializes in fish and seafood. Sent it back for grilled fillet with lobster sauce. Didn't mind the wait as my Cosmo kept me busy!  Second dish arrived cooked rare as requested. Very fresh, very good. Veg cooked to perfection.  Very pleasant wait staff despite late hour on Saturday evening!"}
{"text":"Food was decent, service was horrible.  Bar service was incredibly slow; servers both in the bar area and the dining room seemed like they had never worked in a restaurant before;  they lacked basic service skills; they seemed very uncomfortable waiting on the public. I'll give the restaurant another try in a few months..."}
{"text":"I was craving some scallops & Bonefish just happened to email me a coupon for free bang bang shrimp appetizer; so Bonefish for dinner it was.    We went on a Friday night, they were about 85% busy, and we were seated right away.  The restaurant serves bread with oil while you're looking over the menu.  The menu is primarily seafood of course, but there are a few other options for the folks who don't do seafood.  We ordered the watermelon martini, bang bang shrimp, house salad, shrimp & scallop combo and lastly my fiance ordered the waygu beef burger.  The bang bang shrimp are the highlight of the meal.  The watermelon martini was ok, it was not very strong and honestly I wouldn't order it again.  Kinda chunky as it was muddled.  My shrimp and scallops were ok, kind of dry.  My fiance's burger was ordered medium and served well done.  He said he's had better burgers at cookout.  The server and manager addressed the problem and had a new burger made.    We liked how they were nice about the situation and fixed the problem.  A new burger was served and it was so much better.  Also it was comped.    Bonefish was ok. The staff is friendly. The ambiance is nice.  The food is a little below par.  For the prices I had higher expectations."}
{"text":"Really nice private dining room for group dining. They have the screen and projector there, the staff are very professional and friendly and of course the menu is excellent!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is CLOSED.   Was driving by today and noticed the signs were missing so we drove up to the front of the place.  The sign on the door said \"they were permanently closed for business as of 4/4/16\".  No surprise - poor food, inconsistent service, poor managers and no happy hour.  Considering they built this from the ground up and lasted only 15 months alot of money was probably lost."}
{"text":"So lovely here. Came in, went straight to the bar to order the bang bang shrimp. They're $6 on Wednesdays. Staff is friendly and the place it's very well kept. Received my shrimp in less than 10 mins after ordering. #Nice"}
{"text":"Came here with my girls for Sunday brunch. Such a great experience! Our waiter was phenomenal, the food was amazingly delicious, and the bottomless mimosas were perfectly made every time! I ordered the French toast and it was mouth watering good !  MY OFFICIAL NEW BRUNCH SPOT !  Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last weekend for our anniversary. I got the George's Scallops over Parmesan risotto with garlic mashed potatoes as my side. The Scallops were a nice size and they were delicious! I loved them paired with the risotto. My boyfriend ordered the steak and crab cakes with rice and mashed sweet potatoes as his sides. We both really enjoyed our meal, and we did order dessert since us was a special occasion. We chose the macadamia nut brownie that our server recommended, and we were not disappointed! It was a great size dessert to share, and it was decadent with the ice cream drizzled with raspberry sauce. I hope to come back here soon :)"}
{"text":"So Jason wouldn't shut up about the Bang Bang shrimp since he'd had it while on TDY in Florida, so naturally after we rolled by Bonefish Grill after a day shopping at Town Square, we had to make plans to visit. We did so a couple weeks later after the Wine Walk in Town Square.  We started with the Bang Bang. Jason noted that the portion was much larger than he had received in Fl and it tasted exactly like he remembered. Maybe it was the wine talking, but I wasn't that big of a fan- I'll probably have to try it again sober.  Jason had the trout in the lemon sauce, and opted for the potatoes au gratin. His fish was delicious! The au gratin gave him a little trouble though, he noted that it was delicious, but when he took a deep breath over his food, the breadcrumbs of the au gratin had gotten lodged up into his trachea. DON'T BREATHE HEAVILY OVER THE AU GRATIN!  I ordered the fish n chips.. but with quinoa instead of fries. The quinoa was AMAZING! Very fresh, and crisp. The fish was also much better than I had expected following finding out it was tilapia. I was very happy with it, but even better was the tarter sauce. The best I think I had ever had.  Service was also on point. Was a good meal, and we will definitely be back, but won't be making any special trips down here for it. If you're in the area, definitely stop by."}
{"text":"This is a large restaurant with a full dine in bar and separate dining area. I've been to this restaurant many times and its one of our favorite! We always bring our guest here and they enjoy their food too!!! Their seafood are absolutely amazing!! Last night my hubby enjoyed the Rainbow Trout but i wanted to try something different so I had the sirloin stake with crab cake this time, with fresh pineapple Martini, it was out of this world delicious and by the way i love the bread and butter, All I can say is great food with friendly staff. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to have great night out!"}
{"text":"not what i expected. a little disappointed.  as usual for new restaurants in lake norman everybody flocks to it."}
{"text":"What a nice surprise! Tonight was our first of many dinners we will have there. The ambience was lovely and simple , the service excellent as was the food. It's hard to find great fish in Arizona and this is one of those places.  Be sure to try the donuts as well, amazing."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went a couple weeks ago and the food is actually pretty good. The server eas very attentive as well but thats not why this is getting a one star. I'll tell you though. There's a delicious appetizer there called Bang Bang Shrimp. Now the waiter told me it's 1/2 off on Wednesdays. \"Fantastic, so on Wednesdays I can order that take out?\" I said. \"Absolutely\" he replied. Sounds good right? Wednesday rolls around and I'm craving shrimp. So I call to place a to go order and the woman who picked up informed me that you have to buy an entree with it. I explained that wasn't what her own staff told me. She didn't care. Left a bad taste in my mouth and lost a potentially loyal and regular customer."}
{"text":"I took my in laws here about a month ago and we sat in the restaurant. The food was amazing. There was a gluten free menu, which I appreciate. Service was really, really bad. We waited for over 15 minutes to even be asked what we wanted to drink. It was sub-par service for the whole meal. I spoke to the manager not to complain but to just bring to his attention and he was very apologetic.  I went there again today (for the amazing food) and sat in the bar by myself for Happy Hour. I ordered a regular full meal and 2 glasses of wine. This time service was EXCELLENT. The bartender, Mandy, took very good care of me and I think she is super sweet, friendly and knowledgeable. It seemed she knew all the regulars and they loved her. *****5 stars for todays experience :)"}
{"text":"I was hesitant about coming here because of the number of stars, but the most recent reviews seemed to be good and it was the healthiest option nearby. I'm so happy I decided to walk in because I really had a surprisingly great meal. I had been to Bonefish only once before many years ago in Miami, it was an ok experience, so I wasn't expecting too much. Luckily, I was blown away by my server, Jennifer and with her recommendations. I had the PEI Mussels for my appetizer and the grilled trout with spinach and asparagus. Everything was delicious and Jennifer was a really great server. Very professional and polite, my crappy day turned into a very lovely evening, so thank you Jennifer and Bonefish Grill for a very nice meal!"}
{"text":"The bang-bang shrimp is ah-MAZING! So is the black cherry guava mojito! Ambience and wait staff also great!"}
{"text":"We decided to give it a try ... And truly we were not disappointed at all. The bang bang shrimp was amazing huge portion for only 6 dollars during happy hour. The saucy shrimp  was equally delicious. The fresh yellowtail was great!!....perfectly cooked and served with what I thought was orgasmic Au Gratin   potatoes. They were so creamy and so delicious. Seriously they were amazing !!!  The service was perfect our server Mandy was gracious informative and extremely sweet. The manger Ralph came out and greeted us was  equally informative and super nice. Thank you for a great experience we really enjoyed our selfs. We will return !!!!"}
{"text":"Had a good meal last night at Bonefish.  We opted for the couples meal special for $55.  Shared the bang bang shrimp which was better than the last couple times I had it.  I had the scallops topped with bacon and sauce, my wife had the grilled swordfish and pumpkin ravioli.  Both were excellent.  Finished with a shared dessert that we took to go."}
{"text":"We went on new years eve for our wedding anniversary and had a lovely  time. We got the bang bang shrimp of course and then the sirloin (medium rare, cooked anymore is a sin) with the crab cakes(flakey and flavorful) and my husband got the pork chop(very juicy). Try the scalloped potatoes as a side it sooooo good our server recommended it! We had so many leftovers lol. I forgot our waitresses name she was really nice I was gonna give her a shout out!"}
{"text":"Had a pleasant evening here with some friends for dinner.    Let's start with the food~  We started off with the Bang Bang Shrimp Appetizer for the table.  There was a enough for 4 of us to share for a starter.  They were delicious! Had a great creamy and spicy flavor.   I could have probably ordered just that for my entree.  But since it was our first time here, I kept truckin on...  The fresh bread was delivered to the table with dipping oil and seasonings.  This was also pretty great .  The bread was warm with the great flavor of the dipping oil.  My stomach was filling up fast but I'm still going to power through.  :-)  I ordered the Longfin Tilapia Imperial.  It took a little while for our meals to be delivered but mine was worth a little wait.  It was stuffed with shrimp, crab, scallops and cheese with a great butter flavor and seasoning.  I chose to accompany my fish with the steamed broccoli.  I might as well have part of my meal to be healthy right? The broccoli was perfectly steamed with a seasoning that did not over power any flavor.  If I was judging my dining experience alone... it would have been at least 4 stars but I was not there alone.  Why only three stars?  Our waitress was pleasant when we saw her, but few and far between.  She messed up a friends drink order, twice.  But this could be overlooked if she had acknowledged her mistake. She rarely came back to our table to check on how our meals were and let our drinks go dry a few times.    My husband and friends steak was over done.  I realize we are at a seafood restaurant but if steak is offered, know how to prepare it as requested.  Our friend sent his back but my husband ate his as he doesn't send food back.  We've all seen the movie Waiting... right?    I'm hoping to come back here since I loved their bang bang shrimp.  Keeping my fingers crossed for better service and meal for the hubby.  Happy that we were there with great company!"}
{"text":"I've heard great things about this place but it didn't deliver. I appreciate a clean and inviting place but the food was nothing special and the prices were high. We ordered several different things, I chose the lobster roll which had very little lobster in it but huge chunks of celery. My friend ordered steak which was ok, nothing special but expensive. The best thing I tasted was my friends bang bang shrimp. Spicy and creamy, wish I ordered those instead!  The service was good but nothing was very memorable about the experience except 1 thing.  It was pouring the night we went and the hostesses had umbrellas in hand waiting to walk us out to our cars in the rain. I have to admit that the gesture made me smile :) Thank you for the nice walk in the rain!"}
{"text":"I want to lunch  with two of my family members at Bone Fish  Grill, I had the Alaska Cod fish and chip meal. My fish was cooked golden brown as I like it. Overall Bone Fish Grill is a decent place to eat at."}
{"text":"Excellent meal !!  Everything was delicious and full of flavor !! I will definitely be coming back here more often  .. Definitely must try the wood grilled sea bass, sorry picture didn't come out :( !! The best I've ever had  !! Seafood here is so fresh and service was top notch  .."}
{"text":"Loved it! We need a good seafood restaurant in Westlake finally."}
{"text":"Wow, stopped here off hours, they do good food well. The bread was amazing and the food kept getting better, had the scallops and shrimp, fantastic, keep in mind you are getting fair portions, think European or California, the exceptional service keeps this place classy."}
{"text":"The food is great. Awesome atmosphere, I will totally make this a weekly stop.  and if you love an amazing cocktail, Andy Diego and Kari Hutch make the best drinks on the las vegas strip!!"}
{"text":"We had the awesome bang bang shrimp, which is deliciously spicy and some great fish. Can't go wrong with the Bonefish Grill, in my limited view."}
{"text":"Shrimp tacos are delicious!! I'm not a seafood person but they looked so good I couldn't pass them up. I'm glad I didn't, they were perfect. I think they added mango to their salsa, very good idea."}
{"text":"I have been to many Bonefish restaurants in many cities, even throughout the Charlotte area, and this is by far the most disorganized one I have ever come across. I had some friends coming in from out of town so we met here for dinner. It was unfortunately their first time at a Bonefish, and they left wondering what kind of place I just took them to. To start our server had to come by and ask us multiple times what we had already ordered after we placed our orders, then when he brought out the food he was giving wrong information about the temperature the meat was cooked to. Another annoying thing was that one person at the table had ordered a side and over 20 minutes later he came to tell us that this side was not available. The food took absolutely forever to come out and they didn't seem super crowded. The happy hour cod sliders are bland and could use some type of slaw or something added to improve the taste. Overall disappointing experience, and the first one of this sort I have had at a Bonefish restaurant. Definitely not going to be the place I take my visitors from now on."}
{"text":"The food herb is very good, excellent service. I would recommend this restaurant, for anniversaries, birthdays and just a date night out with your man or  lady."}
{"text":"Bonefish has always been a huge favorite of mine. It's absolutely my go to spot on Wednesdays. While traveling for work, it's always nice to stick with reliable chain restaurants when searching may be difficult. This location is like other BF locations. Nice bar area with free seating and tables on the opposite side.  Food quality is always top notch here. Everything is consistent with other locations. I have recently started ordering the Salmon superfood salad and it is absolutely splendid. To save on calories, I opted for the dressing in the side.  Service at the bar was friendly and great.   Will return next time I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"I'm guessing the reason the staff are in chef jackets is because there is not a chef in the kitchen. This place could be a lot better, but if the management doesn't get out of the back room and help the staff out they are in trouble. And for the food either the person in charge in the kitchen don't care or they don't know how to execute good food. A little pride in what you do gose a long way."}
{"text":"Food is amazing. I had the Orange roughy special.. Yummy!! Bang bang shrimp is a must have.... Virginia is great server and so freakin nice!! She is top notch!! Thanks Virginia.. Midwest people are so freakin nice!!!"}
{"text":"Parking lot is by the mall so quite hard to find a parking space on a busy Christmas shopping evening. However the restaurant wasn't as busy as I thought it would be and they accomodated us ( party of six) quite quickly. Service was prompt and appropriately friendly. Food was a little slow coming out but the place did get filled up later on. Appetizers (bang bang shrimp, Thai shrimp, crab cakes) and entrees ( Mahi Mahi, Salmon, Pork chops, Steaks) and the sides were very good. Everyone enjoyed their meal, they even allowed us to cut and serve  our own birthday cake which they refrigerated before we needed it. Overall a nice and casual place where you feel that you can talk normally but not too noisy or packed where you are listening on others conversations."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Could not be more perfect....Atmosphere, food and service....all outstanding! Of course...the Bang Bang Shrimp is always a most. So excited one has opened in Summerlin. Can't wait to go!"}
{"text":"This location had great service. My co-workers and I decided to check it out on a Wednesday for their bang bang shrimp special. Best decision ever made."}
{"text":"Pretty decent food, friendly service. Reminded me of Nandos, but not quite as good as Nandos.  If you're in the mood for a casual lunch, this is a good place."}
{"text":"We went last night and had a great experience. The decor was very nice; I would have felt comfortable dressed up or causal. The food was great; had bang bang shrimp then ahi tuna. Their special Halloween menu added a salad and dessert (the dessert went home in a doggie bag) at a great price. Dan, our waiter,  was just the right blend of efficiency, charm and interest. We'll be back even with the 50 minute drive."}
{"text":"I went to this location for a dinner with my girlfriend and her parents for the father's day celebrations. This location is pretty busy, so I would highly recommend that you reserve a table ahead of time, otherwise you might end up waiting for 30 minutes.   After we were seated, the waiter came over to take the order. I ordered the steak and crab cake, with asparagus and mashed potatoes. My gf and her parents ordered salmon and sea bass. While we were waiting for our dinner we got their complimentary bread with olive oil and pesto dip. It was a great pseudo appetizer to meal that we were about to have. Approximately, 20 minutes later the dinner arrived. The steak and crab cake came with a lobster bisque sauce. The steak was good, however it wasn't perfect, it wasn't seasoned enough and the crab with lobster bisque sauce was bit to salty. Asparagus looked like it was heavily drenched in steroids; this thing had bigger muscles than me (Got to love genetically modified vegetables).  I tried my gf's salmon and it was pretty good. Seasoned properly with delicious lemon butter sauce.   Overall (3/5), good for chain restaurant, but you can do way better when it comes to seafood at other locations in LV."}
{"text":"I come here often. Love the Tuna bowl! I ordered a ceasar salad tonight which the bartender gave to the guy next to me. He almost dug into it, but caught himself. He was like ...I don't eat salad!!"}
{"text":"The food here was ok. The only item to die for was the bang bang shrimp. However, I gave this a 3 star instead of 2 for the service provided by our server Danielle.   She is the true definition of excellent service. She is friendly, and knows the menu like the back of her hand."}
{"text":"Mediocre food, small portions, overpriced, so-so service. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"This place is easily one of my favorite restaurants. I've been several times and really enjoy just about everything on the menu!   So for this review, I'll just highlight some of my favorites:  Cerviche Appetizer- It's light, crisp and refreshing. I love the combination of flavors and especially the fresh avocado. I definitely recommend starting off with this dish!   Pomegranate Martini- It's my absolute favorite martini here. It's a combination of vodka, pomegranate and mango. It's sweet while not overwhelming and comes with three frozen grapes. Perfect!   Bang Bang Shrimp- Classic.Fried.Spicy...$5 on Wednesday!   Creme Brulee- Whoa...Oh my creamy goodness. It's ridiculous. (Warning: You may want to lick the bowl!)  Side Note: Our waiter Tim was AMAZING. He totally rocked it out with the service! But I would be remiss not to mention... that he's freaking hilarious!!! He had us laughing all night! Make sure you ask to sit in his section!   This place is definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant. I have frequented many other local establishments. The service was mediocre. The food was overpriced and very small portioned. I will not ever come back. Too many other options in the local area that are worth your time and money."}
{"text":"Great restaurant!!! I lost my wallet on Christmas Eve at the restaurant, however, people kept my stuff for almost a week until I called to find it! So responsible! By the way, the food taste good as well!"}
{"text":"The food here is excellent!  I had the coconut shrimp and fish tacos.  Both were incredibly flavorful and nicely prepared.  The decor and waitstaff need some work.  Our waiter was extremely annoying and unknowledgeable.  When we first sat down he spent 10 minutes talking about how Bonefish was better than all the competitors in the area (and that he had worked for all the competitors).  Then retold us about the competitors while he was telling me about the specials this made me feel like I was in a discount steak place.  Then he incorrectly answered many questions we had about (for example we asked about certain seasonings, amounts included in orders and prices---he was incorrect on all accounts). I was also disappointed that they had plastic table coverings---seemed tacky.  Great food tho."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried Bonefish this evening for the first time, waits 50+ minutes to be seated.  Like most of the reviews, the service was terrible:  there are NO busboys so no one. Leads up dishes on the patio or pours your water.  After finally being seated our waiter was very pleasant but service is terrible, long wait for a glass of wine, no water until we asked repeatedly, forgot to put our dinner order in then said he had just remembered!  The fish was good, but couscous was very salty, which comes with it, R jasmine rice flavorless.  We ordered calamari and it was tough, flavorless and has had a sauce like Panda Express, would net recommend it.  No manager that we ever saw, poorly trained staff.  Analysis: $70 for this very mediocre dinner, we will not be back!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this, but was very disappointed.  Reservations for 5:45, didn't get seated until 6:15 & only after talking twice to the hostess.  My Cabernet was served chilled for some reason, service was extremely slow & food was just ok.  Lobster bisque was good & the husbands liked their steaks, but overall presentation & flavors were very \"chain-like\"."}
{"text":"As a chain restaurant, I expect a lot more.  This is a brand new location and we spent most of our dinner trying to kill fruit flies.  Jumbo shrimp as a meal were small, (not jumbo) and alcoholic drinks were not good.  The last one, I actually sent back.  Lastly, the service wasn't bad, just non-existent. Very disappointed in this location as I know bonefish have been good in the past.  Avoid this location for something better, really anything else."}
{"text":"Met some retiree friends from San Jose who now live in this area.  My Henderson friends recommended this place.  Now, I do, too.  We did not get our Peachy Canyon zin (not being stocked), but had another okay zin instead.  But the food was delicious.  Instead of dinner, I had several starters: corn chowder with lump crab, crab cakes, and calamari.  Next time, I'll have a salad instead of the crab cakes, which were delicious (and hot with its pepper sauce) - I was forced to eat all of it.  I only had a little space left for dessert - an ooh-so-good strawberry shortcake.  I tasted the salmon (very good and flakey).  My friends' filet and trout looked scrumptious  . . . ah, next time, as I will go back.  Loved the ambience.  Bar on the right as you enter looked inviting; didn't have a chance to try it this time."}
{"text":"Came here last night while in town on business.  They have great happy hours (wine $4 and some apps are $6).  I had a shrimp salad which was great- added avocado which I highly recommend as well.  Friendly bar staff and patrons which can never hurt when you're traveling alone for business!"}
{"text":"So my family and I went to Bonefish Grill for the second time today. We had patronized this location once before and had a very pleasant dining experience, so we were really excited to visit here again.  We arrived there around 4:30 pm. and the restaurant was virtually empty with the exception of a couple sitting at the bar and 3 other families dining at the tables.  We were immediately seated by the hostess and given menus. This is where our service ended. We waited and waited and waited for someone to at least come and take our drink orders. No one ever came. We also noticed that a group of servers were standing in the back chatting and wrapping silverware, but still no one came to get our orders. It was as if we were invisible! We decided to leave. When we got to our car, we decided to call the restaurant and ask to speak to the manager.   The person who answered the phone ask for our name, and other grilling questions before placing us on hold. I personally don't think she ever got the manager because we were holding for about a couple of minutes before we decided to hang up.  Needless to say, won't be back here again! Service appears to be hit or miss."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant with delicious food and friendly staff! I went here for a birthday celebration with my boyfriend and when we told our server that we were celebrating my birthday, Brian the manager came out and gave us a small box of chocolate as a gift to make the celebration extra special! This truly shows their excellent customer service and really made our day special :)  The food was also delicious with good prices for the portion size. We would highly recommend the Bang Bang Shrimp! We also had the tilapia and Chilean sea bass, which were both very good. The desserts were also excellent and a nice way to end the meal. We would highly recommend this restaurant and it is the perfect place to go for a special occasion!"}
{"text":"This place is terrible. Was super excited to come here for brunch and it was such a disappointment. The only thing good was the mimosas.   I wish I knew the name of our waitress because she was super awesome. That was the only part of our meal that was fantastic with her service. She has a high-pitched voice you wouldn't be able to miss her.  Ordered the Thai chili prawns for an appetizer. It was OK. I'm not sure if it was the manager put them on our table. But when she brought them out, she had a mad look on her face like she hated her job. She had long hair a little bit colorful. Personality not so colorful. Not enough sauce. And it looks like they decorated it with cilantro.   Ordered an omelette and it was sick. Had to cover it with a napkin.Tasted like something I would order from Denny's. Considering this place was triple the price. Ordered the burger with the egg. It just wasn't good. Sautéed spinach was good. Ate that instead of the burger.  Left having a buzz from all the mimosas. Wishing we would've just went to McDonald's for breakfast.  Atmosphere was super awesome except for the food."}
{"text":"I love this place. The ceviche is amazing. Everything I've had has been good. The service has always been great as well.  I know it is kinda  aiming for the fine dining experience, but it is in a mall for cripe's sake-- I wish they had more affordable lunch options and I'd be there much more often."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. Friendliest best staff we have ever experienced. The crave cakes were to die for. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Seriously nasty.  Someone else mentioned the fish and chips as indescribable.  I can describe. . . . Nasty.  The batter was about 1/4 thick all the way around.  Think corn dog with about twice as much batter.  How can any chef or cook even think this is appetizing.  How can they not now how bad this is.  Once you actually get to taste the fish it's very bland and boring. No flavor.  The tilapia also had little flavor.  This place will be out of business in about 6-8 months.  Bang Bang shrimp was good, but not good enough to keep them in business."}
{"text":"Great meal.  Mom came in town and we were up for seafood with it being Lent.  We had a couple appetizers , two shrimp and calamari, that we all loved...even my 16yo son and 13yo daughter.   We all had a variety of meals and all were cooked perfect.   Service was very friendly and professional.  Pricing was just right for the size and quality of the meal.    Just would suggest management to dust the ledge between the booths!!!"}
{"text":"My husband had the butterfish. It was very good done just right.   I had the George Bank scallops and shrimp. The scallops were perfect but the shrimp were over cooked.  Our waitress checked in on us as our dinner was set down and then she never came back till we were completely done with our meals.   I never had an opportunity to tell her the shrimp were over done. I think her name was Melissa.  She offered dessert we wanted cheesecake she said we could take it to go because it was frozen and we could eat it tomorrow!!!!!  WHAT. Dinner was just over $60 but we didn't get $60 of service.  She didn't seam real interest in even being at work."}
{"text":"There are so many things wrong with this place. We dined in on a busy Saturday night and had to wait for a table for about an hour. Fine. While we waited, we looked over the menu to make sure that we knew what to order as soon as we got seated. Once we got seated, our waitress never asked us if we wanted any other drink besides water. Fine. We went ahead and ordered. Unfortunately, they were out of the mussels, which we love. I got the pork chop with fries and whipped potatoes, and my boyfriend got the sirloin and crab cake with rice and coleslaw. A table next to us started to complain that one of their steak dishes came out undercooked. My boyfriend and I should have known then that this place was a mess. We ended up waiting for our food for about 45 minutes. Two tables that got seated after us even got their food before us. We got pretty impatient as we had made other plans later in the evening, and we were debating whether or not we should just take the food to go. Our waitress was not apologetic about the wait at all. Once our food finally arrived, my boyfriend realized that his sirloin was cold. My pork chop was tasteless, my fries were cold and my whipped potatoes were the scoop of a small spoon. Ridiculous. But we didn't have time to complain. We tried to make the best out of it and asked for our check immediately afterwards. As we were leaving, we overheard one of the tables that came after us talking to their waitress about their food....apparently it was their second plate and it was still not made to order. My boyfriend and I have been to other Bonefish Grill restaurants, but this was our first time here and it will be our last."}
{"text":"Well this is a great story of what could have been a 1 star experience but thanks to the great service it was saved. We arrived and were promptly sat. We ordererd our food and a great tasting order of calamari arrived soon after and it was scrumptious. Top three calamities I have had or can recall.       Then we waited...we arrived and sat down by 5:45 p.m. at 6:40 our food arrived. Kids food good it's hard to mess up Mac n cheese and chicken strip's. My wife had ahi ahi seared it was supposed to be rare the only way to truley enjoy a steak of ahi. It was medium and barely warm a sign of sitting under a heat lamp for 10 to 15 minutes. I know this because I have worked in the food industry for 10+ years. But it was still tasty. Unfortunately I had ordererd sea scallops and shrimp which if it is not promptly served and sits under a heat lamp it will be unpalletable. Well it was chewyover, over cooked, and just messy. In addition the side of green beans was undercooked! Greas and burnt pieces of foods were all over the plate it looked like a methed up greasy spoon diner cook slopped it out. But here comes the shinning moment where service out shone the bad experience. I told the waiter the food was overcooked he promptly appologized and took it away to fix it. It came back fast and we'll cooked it was delicious. The scallops had the light fluffy buttery goodness I know. The shrimp was well cooked and flavorful just how I wanted it. Then the manager Eddie came over apologized for the food and then found out we had been here for well over an hour by this point. He comped our appetizer which made me happy then bought us dessert and gave us a complimentary appetizer for our next visit. Which we will do. Thank you Eddie and staff because of the service and attention paid to us we will be back and I will recommend this place the food was good. Thank you Bonefish for a great meal to end a great day. We will see you soon."}
{"text":"Went here with my girls for lunch last week and it wasn't busy at all. I got a burger and fries..which weren't that great. I've personally had better burgers but it was juicy and cooked right but the fries were too hard. I also got the crème brûlée and it was great! I can tell it wasn't burned or anything; it was just perfect! Even though the real meal wasn't great I'd still go again. It was a nice place so I'll give it another chance!"}
{"text":"Very good food.  Kitchen still seems to be working it out. Ordered entree with lemon butter sauce and had to ask twice for it to come out. Also asked for side on separate plate as one of us is vegetarian and entree was not. They missed it, which is fine, but the awesome bartenders had to go back twice to get it fixed. Good bar.  Awesome ice glass blackberry cocktail.  Great wine list     Good bartenders.  Hopefully they work out a few kinks. We'll go back.  Food overall was very good and priced right."}
{"text":"If I could give less then one star I would:(.    My husband ordered a filet w crab cakes. He received sirloin.. I think if you are not aware of your cuts of beef. You are not getting what you pay for. He ordered mashed potatoes received potatoes oh gratin .. our waitress spilt my drink, she replaced it ..But charged us for the replacement and the one she dropped. I ordered shrimp stuffed w crab. They gave me the appetizer version. The manager was at our table 3 different times. our check adjusted twice. All we wanted to do is have a yummy enjoyable stress free dinner, and it was horrible. sorry I wasted our hard earned money here.. It's like sizzler meats seafood..."}
{"text":"I have been to The Bonefish twice now and had a wonderful experience both times. If you like seafood, you'll definitely love it here, but they have many non-seafood items as well. So if you aren't into fish/lobster/shrimp, you can still get a fantastic meal.  During both of my trips we have gotten the bang bang shrimp as an appetizer. Soooo incredibly good. I liked it so much I got the bang bang shrimp tacos as a meal my first time. The second time I went I had the lobster grilled cheese. It comes with lobster bisque and greens. Such an awesome twist on the traditional grilled cheese and tomato soup. I'm also told the sangria is excellent but have not gotten to try it yet.  Be warned that if you walk in at normal dinner hours, you'll likely be waiting awhile for a table. I recommend making a reservation. There isn't really a waiting area either...so the front of the restaurant/bar area gets packed.  Service is very friendly and helpful. I do wish the restaurant was lit a little brighter. It makes reading the menu a little hard.  Love the Bonefish! Can't wait until the next time I go back!"}
{"text":"The food is fantastic.  I had the tuesday lobster  tail special for 8.00 or so dollars and house salad.  Wonderful food.  Our waiter James was so attentive and obviously an expert with  in food and drinks and an opinion   we loved the ambiance.  My friend had swordfish with pumpkin ravioli and  an apple martini (sessional) and the apple and cinnamon aroma over the table was so wonderful.   The only small negative thing which was no big deal was when you order from the bar it takes forever to get the drink.  The bar was not crowded so we were not sure why we waited so long after we ordered the drink ."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Definitely coming back regularly :)) swordfish and asparagus = amazing !!"}
{"text":"I recently had a delicious guilt free experience at Bonefish! I've been here several times over the past year or two but this visit was unique. Gena our lovely waitress gave my dining companion and me some recommendations for lighter versions of our favorite appetizers and entrees. These were simple modifications to menu items that made our dinners lighter in all the high calorie sauces and butter but so very flavorful that we didn't feel like we had sacrificed anything! I'd never gave known these options were available without Gena's input. Wonder why Bonefish doesn't  offer these lighter fare options on their regular menu? I'm certainly going to request these from now on when I dine here. Thanks,Gena, for being so informative and knowledgeable as well as friendly and efficient!"}
{"text":"Although it's a chain and quite pricey. The food, ambience, and wait staff never disappoint. Always consistent with a great changing seasonal menu. If you live nearby they send great coupons and updates!"}
{"text":"Very nice meal. Quick and attentive service. Solid advice and knowledge of the specials and dishes. Big fan of the orange shrimp and scallops pad Thai. Also the pork chop was very nicely done for the land lubber. Prices are comparable to similarly situated national chains."}
{"text":"I've always been hesitant to try this place because I'm pretty picky about seafood.  I went with a few coworkers for dinner and I liked it.  It's a bit pricier than most chain places.  I got a steak and crab cake.  The crab cake was definitely on the small side but delicious.  The au gratin potatoes were so yummy and the steak was good but a little more rare than I'd like when I asked for medium.  Service was good.  The table we were seated at was a little cramped next to other tables.  The restaurant was packed the whole time we were there and it was a Thursday night so that's always a good sign!  I would certainly go back again!"}
{"text":"Great service and the food is great. Marcus is the man! The rest of the staff is very helpful. Definitely try the bang bang shrimp!"}
{"text":"Haven't been in here for awhile wanted to have a good dinner...Specials sounded appetizing, ordered the Pineapple shrimp coconut rissoto with battered asparagus. When it came out I didn't even know if I ordered the right dish...Not sure what the CHEF was thinking when he sent THAT out...the server checked on us and asked how was everything and I pointed to the \"battered asparagus\" she said they're not \"usually\" that big... (we laughed) our server was Great, she sent over her manager, she  apologized and comped our appitizer. *Food for thought...Presentation Is Everything."}
{"text":"Our waitress, Colette, was phenomenal! She was very attentive and gave excellent recommendations. The food was fabulous, especially the white truffel mac and cheese and the key lime pie. Definitely recommend this place for a nice date night!"}
{"text":"I decided to give this location another try, hoping that there were some improvements. I saw that they are now open for lunch, which was surprising. unfortunately, their menu and food quality has not improved. I ordered a ahi tuna salad. it was nicely seared but the tuna was ice cold, I mean literal ice crystals on it, as if it was seared, frozen, then thawed, then cut to order. this completely ruined the texture and integrity of the fish. I emailed corporate and they only stated that they would inform the area director.  this place is a polished turd. you can get the same quality food at Applebee's for much cheaper."}
{"text":"This was 2nd time at Bonefish Grill in Summerlin - NV. They must be going through management/menu changes.....service was poor & selections were limited. The waitress told us coucous was being served \"in place\" of the seasonal vegetables - however, we did not expect to have mashed potatoes & coucous served as sides for the same seafood meal! We shared small salads - but, before we barely touched them, the entrees were served. I had them hold my entre until I finished my salad - & then waited at least 15 min to be served. We paid $4 extra for \"premium\" sides - 4 tiny overcooked asparagus spears per order!!! To be fair, I had Pecan-crusted Trout - which was very good; others had Mahi Mahi & Salmon - both were also good. So, the fish preparation was still very good - but service & side selections need to improve for me to give this restaurant a higher rating considering the prices & competition."}
{"text":"Yesterday's lunch at Bonefish was wonderful.  My lobster tail was one of sweetest I ever tasted.  The sides (garlic mashed potatoes and sautéed spinach) were equally tasty.  My disappointment was they were out of donuts for desert.  Service was good.  Water was served cold but, no ice. Will recommend abd make a return trip"}
{"text":"The food was very good, no doubt. Bang Bang shrimp, bread with a pesto dipping sauce, corn chowder with crab, Caesar salad with blackened shrimp, Maryland crab cakes, potatoes au gratin ... It was all very yummy (though admittedly a little heavy for lunch). I would definitely come back for the food.   But the service was just meh. We had to ask for bread three times, and each time the excuse was \"we're waiting for it to come out of the oven.\" Then why wasn't it hot when it finally came to the table? Toilet paper dispensers in the bathroom were mostly empty even though we were among the first customers of the day. And paying for the bill took forever. Granted, we threw them some curveballs with our coupons, but it still took entirely too long for them to tell us that the coupons wouldn't work and to process the bill. Manager also seemed a little rude and kept our coupon because he thought we were trying to scam the joint -- no, buddy, we were using a valid coupon that's worked at other locations, and it's never been a problem before. Don't appreciate the feeling that you're treating us like criminals when we also happen to be the only group of foreigners in the place.   To end on a good note: the host was the cutest. Happy and clearly enjoys his job. He danced all around the patio when preparing for new guests, singing Taylor Swift!"}
{"text":"So I have been here a total 5 times now, and have thus far refrained from writing a review.    The restaurant itself is wonderful, spacious, airey, spotlessly clean and nicely decorated.   The food is REALLY good..... and Ive tried a lot of things!!   Ive done HH at the bar, Sunday Brunch, Dinner (twice) and even Easter Brunch.  The food IS good!!    But the service has been just plain horrible EVERY time!   And I SOOOO  wanted to like this place!   Its right across the street from my house!  OK.... so I went in for dinner last night because they sent me an email with a coupon for $7 fish n chips!!  Why would I not try it right?   The experience was REALLY good and most enjoyable!!  Not only were the fish n chips deelish ..... hot, crispy AND tastey ......  they were a nice, reasonable size!!   But the reason I have finally decided to write my review .......... The service was GOOD!!!   My server's name was Dawn, she is perhaps one of the most \"senior\" members of their waitstaff, hence the experience and expertise!!  But she truly made a BIG difference to my experience!!   Finally,  a competent server to go with the great food!!  I should also mention James in this review ....... he is one of the most pleasant, friendly and welcoming host's I have encountered in a very long time!  Kudo's Bonefish!!!!    You are getting there!"}
{"text":"Take out experience!   I called the Charleston location and the lady I spoke to took my order and told me it will take 20-25 minutes for pick up.  I live nearby and when I arrived my food was all ready to go. I also asked if I can have a their bread and gave me a fresh bread with the olive oil bread dip. The process was smooth, except they don't have a designated take out parking spot, that time it was really busy and I'm jusy saying this because my left knee was not cooperating that day, it hurts like hell. And when I asked if I could use their side exit they said no I can't!  All the take out food was really good, we ordered their famous bang bang shrimp---they set aside the sauce which I prefer to be mixed in while the shrimp is still hot so all the shrimp will be coated evenly instead of having the sauce on the side. Hubby tried their Rainbow trout with potato au gratin and bacon mac and cheese. I opted for their Angus burger and it was cooked the way I want it---medium rare and seasoned well.  Over all the food was great!"}
{"text":"Bomb ass seafood... a must try is the lobster stuffed shrimp and mashed potatoes, delicious!!! The calamari was amazing as well.. nice chill ambiance.. very spacious and clean.. a lil on the pricy side but worth it."}
{"text":"I normally don't write reviews about many places. I've lived in Vegas for 20 years and try and stay away from the strip when it comes to food. My boss gave me a gift card for outback and my wife was the one that suggested Bonefish grill. I'm stupid I don't read gift cards there are a few restaurant we could have used the gift cards at.       I called and asked if I have to make reservations. The hostess was very nice and said no that I don't have to but it's always good to make a reservation. I chose not to and that was a mistake. I don't mind waiting and realized how great they are at making sure the people that do make reservations are not waiting. I have been to other places where reservations don't make much of a difference. The hostess was very engaging and while talking would pause to greet everyone that came in do her job and go right back to talking to us about the menu. It took around 45 mins to be seated (next time I'm making a reservation) and Cassie greeted us promptly. Was ready to answer any questions we might have. We ordered bang bang shrimp and half order of oysters. Both dishes were excellent. My son tried oysters for the first time and wanted more. The manager at one point came to the table and talked to us. My wife was gonna order another drink but couldn't figure it out. Sorry I don't remeber names well but she suggested the ocean trust tropic heat martini as did Cassie. The Manager told my wife to order it and if she didn't like it she would buy it. It was wonderful. She ordered another after that. The corn chowder with lump crab was fantastic. Like everyone else has said the bread with oil and pesto was very good. My wife and I ordered off the specials. My wife ordered a misoyaki Chilean sea bass and I went with the scallops my son ordered bang bang shrimp tacos. Everything was on point. The sea bass was on a bed of rice with mushrooms and spinach. One of the greatest things I've tried in a long time. The scallops I had were fantastic. They were on top of a corn risotto topped with a sauce and bacon. Forgot the sauce. Also had some zucchini on the side which was a great surprise. Didn't say anything about it on the specials menu. My son loved his tacos. After our meal we had dessert. Cassie suggested key lime pie or creme brulee. We went with the doughnuts. They are fresh made doughnut holes topped with cinnamon sugar served with sea salt caramel and chocolate. The caramel and chocolate came in a nice squeeze bottle. We all loved them.       I have to say it was a great experience. I really don't have anything bad to say about the place. Everyone was engaging and friendly. My wife took pictures of our food and I sent it to my family. My brother has to a lot of good restaurants around the country. He lives in LA and has never been to Bonefish Grill. He is looking forward to going on his next visit. Thank you everyone at Bonefish Grill on Charleston for a wonderful evening."}
{"text":"Great location, just OK food.  Too many other options to waste your money and time here.  Food is just ok, nothing special.  Have business lunches there occasionally but have never really enjoyed the food.  Service is just ok too.  Try somewhere else."}
{"text":"Bonefish Grill is carrying the momentum of their grand opening quite nicely. We showed up around 6:30pm on a busy Friday night and stood at the bar for about 15 minutes before realizing the first-come-first-served bar area includes not just the bar, but the tables to the left of the divider. The entire restaurant is basically half bar area, so it's likely you'll find seats quickly if you show up with a smallish party.   The restaurant seemed otherwise really well staffed, but there were just two bartenders serving all thirsty Madisonians in the building. The bar was being slammed with orders, so it took awhile to get our drinks. Incredibly, when she got to us, the bartender who took our order was friendly, warm, and genuinely interested in helping us pick out the right drinks. I didn't expect the extent of her kindness for whatever reason. Maybe she has resting nice face.   If that's the case, our waiter also had resting nice face. Everyone we interacted with at Bonefish seemed to genuinely enjoy interacting with customers and care that we had a good experience. This left a really good impression.   The menu is a bit pricey, especially for the things they specialize in, but the wood-fired, fresh seafood flavor is worth the setback, at least once in your life. The bang bang shrimp is supposed to be what they're most popular for, outselling all other appetizers combined, but we went with the Thai coconut shrimp because we're rebels. My first bite in, I doubted shrimp could get better than that -- definitely try it if it sounds appealing to you.  P.S. When you punch in their address, Google Maps currently takes you about 5 minutes out into the country. We corrected the location but I'm not sure how long until it goes into effect. Drive towards West Towne Mall's JCPenney and you'll see it from the street."}
{"text":"Took my boyfriends mom here for her birthday the day before Memorial Day. It wasn't packed for lunch but the inside reminded me of Flemings found out it's the same company. The brunch menu looked amazing and the deal they have for unlimited drinks and entree is pretty darn good for the price. I didn't get the unlimited but me and mom got the lobster and filet Benedict. We thought it was okay nothing crazy. My boyfriend got the Kobe hamburger and omg it looked so good!! We started off with the bang bang shrimp appetizer and that was so good! Service was okay the server seem a little slow in thought not really there and didn't know what he was doing. I would check it out again and next time going to try that hamburger."}
{"text":"Went to Bonefish Grill on Saturday, May 5 at approximately 6:30 PM, a party of three.   We shared two appetizers and each of us had a main course.  The two appetizers were just so so, too sweet for my taste:  the Calimari and Thai Coconut Shrimp.  As for the main course I picked the grilled Georges Bank Scallop and Shrimp.  The Shrimp was okay.  The Scallop was outstanding (to die for), so soft and tender and just melted in my mouth.  I didn't even use any of the sauces.  Overall, nice ambiance.  Clean."}
{"text":"Food was decent. Staff was embarrassing. Very immature. I felt like I was in the company of a bunch of high schoolers.   It started with the parking lot. A short little guy, straight out of Compton, was walking out to his white BMW. He stood in the spot where I was trying to park, so I waited. He got the hint and finally moved and stared me down as I parked. He then proceeds back into the bar. I thought he was just some little turd, but he walks back into the kitchen hood up and pants sagging off his butt. He also walks behind the bar a couple times. Point: if this guy is somehow affiliated with this restaurant, he is very immature and unprofessional.   My waitress was very nice and did a great job, but there was a table of three waitresses and an apparent bartender two tables down. I had to sit and endure their all important boyfriend stories and valley-girl-BS while they drank. Very annoying overall. Too bad. It's kind of a decent atmosphere for a chain and like I said food was decent. Fix the children-running-the-place-problem and I would come back."}
{"text":"Tasty food. Awesome service. When they made a mistake, they owned to it quickly and resolved it brilliantly.   Pesto sauce served with the bread is great. The edamame hummus was delicious with the tomatos and pepitas.  I had a bite of the trout and it was really good as were the scalloped potatoes (more casserole than potatoey).   My house salad with chicken was perfect (had brazilian meat service the evening before so this was a great light dish). The dressing was citrusy and light with no cloying aftertaste.   The coconut pie was my favorite. Also tried the pumpkin creme brulee (good, but very pumpkiny!), and the macademia nut brownie (a bit dry for me!)."}
{"text":"Not quite up to the Bonefish standard.  I have in front of me an appetizer, salad and my dinner.  Not just me but my entire party. Am I in the way? Do you need my table?  Oh, by the way... There is no wait.  So my salad is getting warm, appetizer dinner is getting cold. No room at the table and I can't figure out what to eat. I am rushed."}
{"text":"Been there 3 times. Disappointed last time. Food was basic bar quality. Not smart to venture off the popular items. Overall not worth the price of admission."}
{"text":"So I was not expecting this when I saw the menu...but the food here is basically the equivalent of eating cow sh!t. The waitress was very nice, but the quality of the food was horrible. The fish was EXTREMELY fishy, the crab cakes were so soft they were basically in liquid form, the corn chowder had a nasty sour after taste, and the fish and chips tasted like dirty feet. I would not recommend this restaurant to anybody with taste buds. It was so bad in fact we left and went straight to In-N-Out burger to cleanse our pallets."}
{"text":"Enjoy Bonefish Grill very much. Solid meal and great service; ask for Mike (big guy, the kind of fella you'd want on your side in a bar fight! :-) Only.. he's real nice).    I had the sea scallops and they were fantastic.  Best kept drink secret of Bonefish, is the Raspberry Vodka Collins for $6.... not $9.. not $12.. just $6! An old school drink and awesome!"}
{"text":"Ok...so I was soooooooooooo excited for this place to open & knew it would take a very special occasion for the boyfriend to take me...VALENTINE'S DAY :D  Once we get seated @ bar (yeah) our waitress came right over she did the greeting thing perfectly!!! Great knowledge of menu items which has alot to do with good training program. We ordered the bang bang shrimp the girl that brought it to our table scratched her head as she was serving it to us 2 shrimp fell outta the bowl and our server said \"oh no\". We weren't real real hungry so we decided on splitting the fish tacos it took over an hour for us to get them. The place was not that busy. I was watching our server because I've been a bartender for 15+ years started as a server so I watch noticed her getting mad about something. She avoided us to the point I had to ask random servers for more drinks, more if any bread & their pesto/oil that she should of given us but I spotted on other tables. Once we got our food I had to ask bartender for hot sauce. Only saving grace was the manager came over after we finished apologized said they really dropped the ball on this one & they where picking up the check for food only. Which was really cool! We never said a word to anyone, never gave our waitress a hard time, just sat there & talked! My boyfriend did get a little mad when he had to wait for 2nd bloody mary ( they are fantastic)! Now, had they not done that...he'd NEVER go back with me. I do think it's a bit pricey for 2 very small tacos! Also, all I eat is seafood been vegetarian for 17yrs :("}
{"text":"I went here with my fiancé for a nice meal with some gift cards, not expecting too much from a chain. I was surprised. He ordered the swordfish and I the Chilean sea bass. The sea bass was to die for: flaky, layers upon layers of flavor, and so succulent. The waiter recommended the pesto sauce and it was perfectly complimentary. So good! The swordfish, unfortunately, was just a little too cooked, but our sides were perfect and the calamari app is addictive! I can also recommend their house margarita for a hot summer night."}
{"text":"Great dinner option for a franchise restaurant. Quality ingredients in the teriyaki meal, fish tacos, and salads. Very fresh, very colorful. Speedy and friendly service. Affordable prices for surf and turf."}
{"text":"Stellar serice (thank u Emerson, staff & managers!), food to DIE FOR, we WILL be back - soon! Bam Bam Shrimp, Lily's Salmon, etc.- unbeatable!!!!!!!!! Even a beautiful gold box of chocolates for me, the birthday girl. :-)"}
{"text":"This is my third time going to a Bonefish grill.  My steak was over done, the service was the worst I've experienced yet."}
{"text":"From a food perspective - We loved this place! I am a huge mussels fan, and my appetizer served as an entree!  Amazing portions, high quality food, very tasty and well presented.  My son had the grilled chicken, and my husband had the bacon cheeseburger which was incredible.  The biggest standout of the night was our server, Jamie.  She was friendly, knowledgable, attentive but not intrusive!  I adored her and we even gave her our cards to stay in touch.  Here's the not so great part - This is one of the most awful dining rooms I have ever been in.  The tables are set NYC style and so close that our chairs not only touched the chairs of the surrounding tables, but I heard more about the other's tables' relationships and work issues than I would have liked.  Additionally, the kitchen entrance is so large you look all the way down the line.  Not in a sexy, open air kitchen kind of way, but in a \"did the drape not come in\" or \"is that a mistake\" kind of way.  And, lastly, the way that the booths are set around the perimeter combined with the height of the tables and the color of the space made me feel like I was squished at the children's table.  It was so uncomfortable that we actually left earlier than we would have had the space been more comfortable.  I would love to go back, but I would not sit in that dining room again.  Which means that I'm stuck in weather permitting dates when I can sit on the patio!  PS - One final thought - The highchair to table hight was so awkward that my daughter's forehead was literally up against the table edge.  Not safe and felt very unnerving!"}
{"text":"This is my first time eating at this restaurant. I I had grilled tuna steak which was a really good dish. I also had their bang bang shrimp. It was ok. The best part of this experience was the service. The tuna steak and the potatoes au gratin. I wasn't too thrilled with the steamed asparagus especially when they charge you $4 extra for it. The food is good but the pricing is a little too high for the type of food they serve. I would return just for the tuna steak and potatoes augratin themselves."}
{"text":"Excellent crab cakes...they far exceeded my expectations.  Service was highly attentive and entree (mahi mahi oscar) was delicate and moist.  I will definitely come back.  I know theyre a chain but the food and service are really exceptional.  Very impressed.  Rod, the chef/owner (?) was great guy.  Really like this place."}
{"text":"This is my second trip to Bonefish Grill (the other visit was in Matthews).  It was 5:30 in the afternoon, so they weren't busy yet. They've been open a couple of weeks, so I felt that was ample time for them to work out the new opening kinks.  We were seated immediately in the bar area, which is a pretty decent size. However, the tables by the \"dining room divider\" are a bit tight - to the point you're all up in the next table's convo.  We were greeted by a very happy waitress who told us all about the specials. For drinks, we ordered a blueberry martini for me & my boyfriend had the rum punch. Drinks get an A+, they fill them to the top of the glasses & they're strong!  With today being Wednesday, it's $5 Bang Bang Shrimp all day. If you know Bonefish Grill, you know this is their top seller & with good reason. A bowl of lightly fried shrimp in their signature, spicy bang bang sauce laid atop shredded lettuce. This appetizer could ultimately be a meal in itself for one person.    Next up is the Italian bread, which came out warm & with a plate of pesto & olive oil. Delicious.  For entrees: I ordered the shrimp & scallops, garlic whipped mashed potatoes, & the seasonal vegetable of zucchini & tomatoes. My boyfriend ordered the chilean sea bass, seasonal vegetable, & the assorted vegetables.  Both meals came out in a relatively short amount of time.  Temperature & taste were A+. The portions are a nice size, too.  I love that the shrimp & scallops are huge - no skimpy sizes here.   As if all that food wasn't enough, we ordered a creme brûlée to share. Now, it took quite some time for this to come out. Maybe almost 10 minutes. By this time it was about 6:15 & the restaurant was getting pretty busy.  Luckily, it came out & it was heaven in a oval shaped bowl. The creme was creamy & the sugar topping was delicious & not burnt.  They also had a huge blob of whipped creme with three blueberries. We both commented we could have used more berries.   Other notes: friendly & attentive wait staff. Our waitress was really great. She had a cute sense of humor & checked on us just the right amount. They look sharp in their white chef coat type uniforms. The restaurant is clean. The restaurant isn't huge, but they do have a small area for patio seating. I also love the fact they have a huge aluminum water bowl out front for doggies that pass by on their walks.    They're pretty pricey, which is really the only turnoff for me."}
{"text":"Bonefish has really stepped their game up in the ambiance department! This location is absolutely gorgeous & welcoming. Even the bathrooms felt very \"spa like.\"  Service was excellent. Our waiter was very attentive & friendly. YAY for lunch specials! I got the two bang bang shrimp tacos with a house salad for $10.50. They were shy on the salad, which was great for me! I LOVE their house salad. Everything was so tasty. And can we talk about the complementary bread?! YUM. The pesto & oil along with the bread = heaven.  I have no complaints, only praise for this visit!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Bonefish for a long time, and have gone in many different cities. They are always very good and the food & service is very consistent. I went to this location (been here lots of times) but this could be the last. I love Bonefish because it is a nice place to have a dinner date and service is always great. I also like that the manager will check on you to make sure all is well. Before I start this, it was a Tuesday night and we were 1 of 4 tables seated. Instead of a long drawn out story, I'll just make a list. 1- ordered unsweet tea  2- had to ask for sweetener 3 times(server asked what color of package did we prefer) 3-1 glass of tea is all we got the whole meal (asked for that 2 times) 4-saw server 2 times (only 3 tables now) he seemed to be standing around talking to the cute girl at the front 5-hostess had a room full of empty tables to seat a family of 6 with 4 very loud children (but decided to seat them right beside us)  6-server even made a rude remark to the family about them having that many children  7-asked to speak to a manger about these issues, but she seemed to make all excuses in the world as to why we haven't seen her or why we could not get anything to drink. I guess #7 is the worst. If the food is bad, the service is bad, the atmosphere is bad, you expect the manager to handle the issue. I will continue to go to the Bonefish, but not this location."}
{"text":"The food at this restaurant was amazing, and the waitress Rachel was spectacular she went above and beyond. When we asked Rachel about a certain item she was very knowledgeable about the ingredian! Rachel is a wonderful waitress they are lucky to have someone like her working for them. God bless her!"}
{"text":"First review but not my first time here. Previous times were decent. Today, not so.   Service was fast today and also confusing. We noticed folks are greeted with fresh bread and pesto but we did not. It was an empty table when we sat down so that was very apparent.   First dish out was the appetizer. Their new ceviche. We thought - why not? Mistake. Accordingly the description, it is based off the traditional Peruvian dish. It did not turn out that way. Shrimp, scallops, and fish looks more cooked than usual. The biggest disappointment was the used of carrot cubes. The hard texture just did not go with the rest of the dish. We didn't get to finish the appetizer because the bread came after a reminder that they did not bring any out and just as we got started on the bread, our entrees came too. So the service is very fast tonight. Way too fast for us as we ended up packing the appetizer to go because we wanted to eat our entrees while they are warm.   The entrees today was very salty. My dining companion has a high tolerance for salt and she found the dish very salty. Sautéed spinach was salty. Soft shell crab was very salty. She ate it with the bread that came out late. My creole redfish was also salty.   Server said next time, just say it is too salty and they will re-do it. Will remember to do that next time or simply ask for less salt. That would be my tip for all visitors.   Best thing tonight? the Hawaiian martini. Sweet and refreshing. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Went to the new Bonefish Grill in Concord Mills. It was Sensational!  Hosts were warm and friendly and accommodating. Our server Daniel was amazing, funny, and expertly knowledgeable of all items on the menu. Drinks from the bar were the best I've ever had! Bang bang shrimp, need I say more!? Food cooked to perfection and my seven year old enjoyed everything too! Will be back again and again!"}
{"text":"Few girl friends and I went there last Sunday for brunch to celebrate a birthday.  The have all you can drink mimosas, sangrias and peach Bellini's, and a brunch item for $19.99  Everything we had was perfect and the service was over the top.  There was 6 of us and our server never let our glasses stay empty. They even brought out a cafe with a card and free bang bang shrimp for next time.  This is my favorite brunch place and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner with my wife and Mom who was visiting from NY. I had the sea bass and they had another fish which i forgot the name, the sides of mashed sweet potato was incredible and the scalloped papas were as well. Wine was a red, most tasty, def go back again...4/8/16 visit..."}
{"text":"Very pleased with this place!! First time coming in and wasn't let down at all got the rainbow trout and was almost like home cooked rainbow trout!! Servers were great n very aware of customer service aspect, the wife n I will b back here soon!!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure with my visit to this Bonefish that I'm over my obsession. Thanks a lot.  Went in and was seated in a booth that I requested and sat down. Service was very quick and the waitress was super knowledgeable and very friendly. That part was excellent. It was the food. WTH?   Started off with the bang bang shrimp because, duh, delicious. Delivered awesomely fast, but as I started to eat it I thought that it tasted super bland. I thought it must have been an off day here. No. A waiter comes over and asks if I knew that it was chicken instead of shrimp. I told him I thought it tasted weird, but I was tired from working all day and navigating the crazy snow (man, snow is hard) after the blizzard that swept through. I was so hungry from not eating all day that I just wanted food. So, they bring me what I actually ordered, shrimp. They didn't even ask if I wanted it, if I wanted to just take it off my check. Nope, just plopped it down. I didn't eat all the chicken, but I really wanted the shrimp so I ate enough that I was sort of put off my meal by then.  Anyway, I ordered off the specials menu because I saw asparagus and feta and it was a white fish (haddock) and it just sounded so good. It came out looking like a train wreck on top of mashed potatoes (which almost killed me with the salt content alone). It was covered in some crazy, fattening sauce that tasted like pure junk. Ugh. How artery clogging can you get? The asparagus was limp and ugly. Hated that. The fish was flaking, I THINK, but I can't confirm that because it was covered in heart attack. That had to be the worst thing I've ever eaten at a Bonefish. No, wait, almost anywhere. And, I had the glorious privilege of paying $20 for it. You'd have to give me $40 to get even anywhere near me accepting an apology for this disaster. (to their credit they did include a chickpea side dish that was really good)  So, I'm over Bonefish. I can make my own dishes that won't gag me. Done."}
{"text":"Aside from the obvious fact that is should be Fishbone (who says \"Bonefish\"?!), this place is actually a nice little find!  Tried to hit up Helix for brunch, and though their website proudly advertises brunch, they have changed things up and this is now a lie.  Just sayin'.  But the hostess does redeem a few points by recommending Bonefish nearby.  Totally walkable, except it was 115 degrees that day.  As soon as we walked in, and said \"table for 3, please\", we kindly requested (read: desperately begged) for copious amounts of ice cold, fresh mimosas to quench our thirst (champagne is an obvious choice; no need for water).  Our server Melinda was a bundle of smiles and high energy, and tried her dandiest to keep on top of our glasses of bubbly.  Food was surprisingly tasty - someone in your party absolutely must order the crème brulee French toast with mascarpone whipped cream, it is phenomenal.  Cool vibe, and I always enjoy the community table concept.  If in the area again, will definitely consider this place!"}
{"text":"Good for a date night. The lights are low, the music is good, our waiter was awesome. I liked the bang bang shrimp. This one is located at Birkdale. My love and I went here, then walked to the movie theater in the same center."}
{"text":"My husband and I go out to eat all over CLT and Bonefish is one of my favorites. I get the sea bass with the pan Asian sauce with au gratin potatoes and green beans. The fish is always delicious. It's one of those places you can always go and know you're going to get a good meal and the fish is always fresh and prepared perfectly."}
{"text":"We waited 45 minutes for our food. This was after we ordered said food from our server. I went to Bonefish yesterday for a late lunch with the family. It was not busy. No one was in the weeds. I watched a three top and four top seated, served, and paid for their meals. Both these tables came in after we had already been seated and placed our order. The bang bang shrimp appetizer was ok...once we got it. Both my sister's and mother`s orders were messed up. The kobe beef burger was super well done-borderline dry. The corn chowder...the only soup available...cold and...bland.  This place has issues. Service was horrible. I won't be going back, unless I lose a bet."}
{"text":"I love Bonefish in general but the one in Madison, WI. is the best! All of the staff are very friendly. Our waitress Sara H made our dinner experience delightful. She attended to us almost immediately when we sat down. She promptly followed through on requests I made (hot water, butter). My steak was cooked rare instead of medium & she immediately offered to send it back, but I had already eaten half by that time. Sarah's manager Nicole was outstanding. She came over to our table  & was very kind & professional. I had also eaten caesar salad (very tasty) & cheesecake (also yummy) so I was very surprised to see my entire meal had been removed from the bill. So Mr or Mrs Bonefish :-) whatever you're doing in employee training keep doing it. I would return in a minute! BTB the bread is warm & delicious."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday dinner. The service was great! Everyone wished me a happy birthday including the manager. They gave no fuss to splitting our check. The food was amazing! Definitely get the Bang Bang shrimp. My steak was a little over done but still delicious and tender. And the creme brûlée was big enough to share. Would recommend this restaurant to everyone."}
{"text":"So I've been here a few times now since they opened and to be honest...not as good as I remember when they had the location on eastern and horizon. The bang bang shrimp used to pull me in at least 1 x month and now I only go if someone else suggests it. Every time we've come there has always been an issue with any food that was special ordered; so be warned. So good, but not as good as it used to be...or is in other cities. 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"I am not a seafood lover, so I wasn't sure what to expect from the Bonefish Grill.  I was also worried about the price.  To my shock and awe, the menu has lots of great options for non-seafoodies and the prices are totally reasonable.  I got a kobe beef burger - which was delicious & my husband had shrimp tacos, which he devoured.    We happened to be there on a Sunday so we got the info on their Sunday Brunch - for $19.99, you have a wide variety of menu options and (the best part) bottomless mimosas and sangria! Saayy whaaaaat?! You'll know where to find me on Sundays from now on."}
{"text":"Surprised in a few ways.  Looking at the rest of the eateries in the center we decided to head to BoneFish because of the reviews on Yelp. So glad we did.  Firstly if you are staying on the strip pick up a $5 Tix4d restaurant card kiosk that are all over or up the road from  as it will save you 20% here!  Food excellent, service excellent too.    Huge variety of items on the menu, Thursday is 50% off wine. Which makes a bottle of Malbec $14.50.  Our table ordered a mix of ahi, burger, steak. All perfect.  Salads and sides were excellent too.  The sourdough & pesto oil you are seated with is very good and especially good if you mix in some fresh lemon    All in all a new favorite when I am in town.    Fun fact. You are on the end of a runway across the road from the airport.  They restaurant has been well silenced but outside you can feel the landing planes every few minutes."}
{"text":"I have dined at this location a few times. It gets very crowded but you are able to make reservations and each time I've done so, the reservation has been kept on time or no later than 10 minutes past. Acceptable. I feel the quality of the food is  consistently good and very reasonably priced. You are not forced to eat seafood only, there are other good options. I like the Dine Rewards Program with their affiliates and the service always has been good. In summary, I have been here several times and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"I had a gift-card for Bonefish Grill from Christmas, so we decided using it over the weekend was in order. The restaurant is large with multiple rooms and plenty of tables, not too mention ample parking. A hostess greeted us at the door and we had only a short wait until we were seated. Our waitress was friendly, efficient, and knew what she was doing. She clearly described the specials and suggested we try one of the customer favorites: the Bang Bang Shrimp. We ordered that and drinks and then continued to peruse the menu.  For drinks I had Bonefish Grill's version of a Moscow Mule. The copper mug was on the smaller side but they made up for it by including candied ginger. This was very tasty. I also tried the white sangria. It was super-sweet. I left most of it at the table as I was unable to finish it. Unless you enjoy Moscato and sweet fruit juice I would stay away from this. We also enjoyed a margarita and a craft beer. Nothing special, but decently made.  When the appetizer arrived I ordered the Pecan Parmesan Crusted Rainbow Trout and my partner ordered a grilled fish from the specials menu. The Bang Bang shrimp was a pretty pile of popcorn shrimp bathed in a creamy, slightly spicy sauce. I would have preferred a sticky sweet and spicy sauce. This was a heavy mayo-like consistency and strongly reminded me of Hibachi Yum Yum sauce.  Just about the time we started to wonder where our entrees were, they arrived. The trout was cooked perfectly but didn't have much flavor. For sides I had the sauteed spinach which was also cooked perfectly and the garlic whipped potatoes which were creamy and flavorful. The two sides were actually my favorite part of the meal. My partner was disappointed with the size of his fillet, especially considering the price and size of mine (my trout was a decent size). He said the flavor of the fillet was very good. He had the spinach and Potatoes Au Gratin and like me, he thought the sides were the best part of this meal.  I'm not opposed to going back to Bonefish Grill. I wouldn't mind trying some of their other dishes. However, at that price point, I think there are other, more consistently tasty options in the area."}
{"text":"Bonefish Grill. Mmmmm. I really wish my income could suffice eating here every week!  Menu isn't too overwhelming. I went with the bang bang shrimp appetizer for starters. Um, can I just say, I would have eaten 2 of these & made it my meal! These are SO amazingly tasty.  Which, by the way, they're only $5 every Wednesday. For my entree, I went with the jumbo sea scallops & shrimp, with the lemon butter sauce, steamed vegetables & splurged on the Bonefish house salad. I was in awe how good everything tasted! Oh...& the drinks, of course! I had a watermelon martini & a sour apple one. YES, you heard me correctly!      Presentation: A+++ Staff: A+++ Atmosphere: A+++"}
{"text":"I've been here approximately 5 times. It's a 50/50 experience. Sometimes they are spot on, and sometimes the service is slow and food is cold."}
{"text":"Might as well go to Long John Silvers. this place is a disaster, I will never return. Never! Lol.   I have eaten here twice and have been disappointed both times. The first time we ordered the Sea Bass. It was expensive and the portion was tiny. The food server disappeared and forgot things we ordered and we had remind him to get our entire order.   Went back last night and the service was horrible. Much worse! The food server couldn't understand that my friend wanted a vodka and tonic with a lime. It had to be repeated to him five times. And then the drinks were forgotten, so we had to ask another food server to get those to the table. When our food server went to take our order he said I don't have a pen, that is so unprofessional of me. So I gave him a spare pen from my purse to keep. I asked if we could order our Kobe burgers rare and medium rare and the food server said yes. A couple of us ordered hamburgers rare and they came out well done almost burnt. Then the manager was walking past the table, as our food server was gone for days at this point, and we asked him if we could get burgers done the way we ordered them. He took them back to the kitchen and new burgers w the old fries showed up approximately 15 minutes later, after our two friends had already eaten their food. The burgers that were ordered rare and medium rare came out medium but at this point we both wanted to eat. The waiter showed up eventually to drop off the check. One of our friends asked for dessert menu so he ran off to bring that back. She ordered a brownie which eventually came out. I put my credit card in the bill that he set down before we order dessert and of course he brought a new check with the brownie on it. No comps for all the trouble and nonsense, of course. At this point he explained to me that he had lost the pen that I had given him and I said no worries I have another pen in my purse. I will use that, but I'm not giving it to you. What a complete dingdong.  I won't ever go back to bonefish.   They should change the name to bonehead."}
{"text":"For a long time I would drive by Bonefish Grill during my monthly trips to Target and think to myself, \"One day I'm actually going to eat dinner there!\" And finally recently I had the chance to do just that.  I went here for a Friday night birthday dinner with a group of friends. Immediately I saw that Bonefish Grill is the kind of place where you're better off getting a reservation - the entire place was full except for the table set aside for my group. Bonefish is also not the place to go if you want to enjoy a quiet dinner conversation; the noise level admittedly got better as the night went on (my group left close to 10:15 PM), but it was quite loud when I arrived.  Business and high volume of noise aside, I actually really enjoyed dining here - the food and service were both impressive. Our waiter checked on our group frequently to refill our drinks and make sure we were happy with our food. In fact when our appetizer was brought out he even said that it took so long to get it to us that he was dropping it from our bill. And here we weren't going to complain and had thought things were moving pretty smoothly considering how busy the place was! It was a nice surprise.  For my main course I went for the ahi tuna, which had a very interesting mix of sesame and soy sauces with light touches of wasabi and ginger - which combined gave the tuna a tasty but (thankfully) moderate kick. By the way, if you're not talking about your food during dinner, you'll probably be talking about your drinks; my friends' drink was brought out in an actual cup made out of ice! Half of our table didn't even believe it was ice until we watched it melt throughout the night. Talk about different! And the desserts? Quite large and quite delicious - our group of four went ahead and shared a giant piece of strawberry shortcake to wrap up all of our meals.  All in all Bonefish left a good impression and a great taste in my mouth when I rolled my way on out of here. Now I want to come back to try their steak and crabcake dinner and see what other interesting drinks come in that cool ice cup - no pun intended."}
{"text":"Hi Madeline  Thank you so much for your response !! That was so very nice of you !! Do send me your email or a contact # and I will surely contact you !! BTW Ivory was awesome !!  Thx  DR MD"}
{"text":"Had the teriyaki chicken bowl. Too little chicken and way too much rice. Mango salsa was good but not enough and they barely drizzled the teriyaki glaze on chicken so had to ask for more. Wish it had more veggies. Pretty tasty but a tad skimpy for $14. The bar was too dark and we all struggled to read menu.  Colleague was not thrilled with his go-to Bang Bang shrimp this visit.  If up to me I would not return after 3-4 disappointing visits."}
{"text":"I went to the Bonefish Grill in Maryland and my experience was okay because the service was excellent, considering how busy it was.  The food was not that hot though, the scalloped potatoes were cold and undercooked. My fillet mignon was really good and lean though, crab cake was really tasty though not hot too.    Finding out they had recently opened a location in the Pittsburgh area was exciting.  I thought I could give this a place a try on a more quiet night, hoping that they could pay better attention to the food. It was incredibly packed on a Wednesday night; the wait was an hour.   We ordered the 2 for $39.9. The meal came with 3 very small cuts of ahi tuna, salmon, sea bass, as well as 2 shrimp and 2 scallops. It also included 2 salads and 2 sides (asparagus $1 extra and garlic mash potatoes) on another plate with their signature garbanzo salad.  The fish was just simply undercooked.  The ahi tuna made my stomach turn, because it was raw, and I understand that is how they do it.  It just did not sit well with me.  The texture of it was just too mushy and flavorless.  My taste buds were not very excited to work the sea bass either- salmon, I make that at home and it wasn't good either.  The scallop I ate was undercooked too.   In the end, our bill with tip came to about $60 (we got water). I'm not sure I'll ever pay that price again to wait an hour for food that is disappointing to just okay.  I might stop by for Happy Hour because the service is really good and the atmosphere is extremely nice (slightly crammed).  However, dinner would be more enjoyable, for me, somewhere cheaper and better tasting.  The 4 of us that went left agreeing that TGI Fridays would have been better and much cheaper."}
{"text":"Had amazing scallops with corn risotto for dinner and my date had great rainbow trout. Service was very good, loved that you could make reservation. Definitely will be back again. Oh the bread and pesto is outstanding !"}
{"text":"Yesterday was hands down the worst restaurant experience. I don't even know where to begin. First, we traveled and hour to get to bonefish...(we had been there before and it was pretty good) so, we had reservations for 6, and were seated. (At the same time as the couple next to us.. With the same server. The server asked if we had been here before, we said yes and be immediately moved the specials menu. As if we don't need to hear it because we have been there before? So, we order a flatbread pizza for an app, and a special of a sirloin and lobster stuff shrimp. An hour goes by...  We wait... We ask... We're told it's coming right out. Then, a kitchen runner brings out our entree. So we decide to keep it( I dont want it sitting under a heat lamp until they make a new flatbread). So, I cut into the steak (which was ordered medium rare)... It was rarer than just rare. The inside was beet red and cold. I sent it back for a new one. So then, our waiter comes back and we tell him were just gonna pay for our pops and go. He insisted we stay, he said the meal would be compensated. He really really wanted us to stay and promised it would be resolved. We stayed. 5 minutes later the pizza came out and it was good! 2 minutes later our entree came out. I wish I took a picture of the before and after. What we got was the steak I sent back a half hour ago, ( that I has cut in two) re seared on the grill ( it also looked like it was rolled on the floor), and was still bloody red. And some cold green beans. We told the waiter were missing the lobster stuffed shrimp and potatoes. He brought out the potatoes (which were not the same thing on our original plate), and no shrimp. What we waited an hour and a half for was inedible. There were probably a host of serf safe rules violated.... That steak would have made anyone Ill. We promptly told him we we're leaving and didn't want any of the food. He asked if he could get us a dessert. I think we said yes because we were soooo hungry at that point. And it's an hour to get home. So, we get a piece of key lime to go...  It took 20minutes. He came and tried to bill us for the pie. We left everything there and just left. I told him I don't know how we stayed as long as we did and he said \"I can't believe you did too\". The entire evening was wasted between the drive out to sitting and waiting. (Oh and the icing in the cake was that the couple next to is enjoyed all of there courses while we were waiting) we got to salivate over it (sorry !!!! We were really hungry). So we got home at 9 and had leftovers. :("}
{"text":"Usually not a fan of fish restaurants, and worry about quality and flavor of fish in chains like this. My first time to Bonefish a friend suggested it since we were in the area, so I went with it. To my surprise it is lovely inside, and our service was way above average. Bang bang shrimp seems to be pretty popular there, so I started with that and then had wild salmon with asparagus and jasmine rice for my entree. Our waiter Cameron was very sweet and explained the dishes well. I trusted his description of the salmon and it was very good. The cocktails were alright, I didn't feel that any of their \"special\" drinks looked so incredible, but my companion didn't send his drink back, so he must have enjoyed it. Overall I was quite impressed and I'm wondering why the reviews of the bang bang shrimp aren't better! I would go again with no hesitation"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time! very disappointed!!!! My wife order the filet mignon, they served her the top sirloin instead. I ordered the ribeye and over 50% of the steak was nothing but fat. then order the large!! now I say again the large fish n chips,  inside was three tiny pieces of cod, the French fries were bigger then the cod fish that they served. never ever again will we eat here. it's amazing that there are so many people think this kind of food is acceptable. nothing but fast food and not worth the  price or wait!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I have the lunch bang bang shrimp. The flour tortillas were like chewing cardboard. Never been disappointed  till today."}
{"text":"This is a winner. I enjoy going here with my wife for a quiet dinner. The service is very friendly and knowledgeable. The food is just amazing and well worth it."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch everything was great.  Omelets cooked to perfection.  All you can drink mimosas and awesome bread and pesto.  Good service throughout."}
{"text":"Bonefish Grill is one of my favorite restaurants,  I travel around the country for work so ive had it in different states.   It is consistently good.    And ps I eat out all the time and have only given two Yelp reviews in my life.  Today was my first time having BFG in Charlotte.     THE FOOD was not up to par.   The CRAB CAKES normally phenomenal...were soupy and wet.  No crunch at all.  The LAMB CHOPS were not seasoned at all.   I left two orders of those on the table not eaten.   When they come they did not look appetizing.   One bite was it for me.   BANG BANG Shrimp always always good.   Was alright.   Again tasted wet and under cooked.    Whipped mashed potatoes and broccoli same thing.   So sad to write this because I Love this restaurant. $60 bucks gone down the drain."}
{"text":"It's OK.  Fair prices, decent food, nice atmosphere and staff.  Crab cakes were good, salmon super food salad was fresh and good.  Scallops were ok but small and gritty.  Shrimp was overdone.  It works for a meal, nothing to go out of your way for though."}
{"text":"Went here for mothers day with my mother and my wifes mom ......It was all our first experience here and I wasn't impressed in the least ....The bread and everything that comes out pre-food was Ok....But My food I got the bacon cheeseburger left very little to be desired .....No real flavor and nothing to write home about, The fries had to have been sitting around for a while as you could just tell they weren't anywhere near fresh anymore. And we were there at 12:35 on sunday on mothers day ...How hard is it to have fresh HOT fries...."}
{"text":"The first thing Bonefish has going for it is an intriguing menu. I hate restaurants where my first impression is a menu full of items I could have made at home. From there, the cocktails are delish (we had a variety of different hand-crafted cocktails from martinis to margaritas and more), and the starters are great (we tried the mussels and the Bang Bang Shrimp). All of our entrees were good, especially the Tilapia Imperial, and the desserts were to die for (we had the Strawberry Shortcake, brownie, and creme brulee). The shortcake was our favorite of the three. But aside from the interesting menu, inventive cocktails, and delicious food, Bonefish has exceptional service. Our waitress, Rachael, was attentive, congenial, and generally fabulous. She gave us great recommendations (I hate servers who respond to the question \"What would you recommend?\" with the question \"Well, what do you like?\"), and we left full and smiling, which is what dining out SHOULD be all about. :)"}
{"text":"First off we had the Bang Bang shrimp, which is delish. Followed by tuna fish tacos, corn cho wder with lump crab. For our Granddaughter pop corn shrimp  and fries.  The corn chowder amazing. Tuna tacos superb. Service great Thank you Ben."}
{"text":"Very disappointing experience. We waited over an hour to be seated while other customers who made an online reservation were just walking in off the street and getting seated. It was like the forgot the customers who were patiently waiting and only seating online reservations. This was extremely frustration considering we were waiting at the bar, ordering $8 beers, and customers who did not spend a dime yet were getting seated. I expressed my frustration to the manager, telling him we've waited over an hour and spent $40 on drinks, and were basically ignored. They ended up having a table for us all of the sudden and offered us a complimentary appetizer. As soon as we sat down the waiter told us the kitchen was behind and we would be waiting a little longer than normal for food. The managers shifted had ended and he failed to tell our waiter about the complimentary appetizer and we ended up paying for the appetizer that we only ordered because the manager said it was complimentary. The food was just average, the drinks were very over priced, and the overall experience was poor.  Not the type of service you would expect from an established upper end franchise. I will not be returning to Bonefish again."}
{"text":"We had our two year anniversary dinner at Bonefish in Matthews.  Exceptional food.  Best keylime pie in the Universe!"}
{"text":"This is the perfect place if you want a healthy yet tasty fish meal. We went there with a friend of mine. I had the haddock and he got the sea bass. Both were really good and the good thing is you can ask the fish to simply be grilled with lemon, which is my favorite way of enjoying it.  The staff is very friendly, our waitress knew exactly what she was talking about. Nice place, pretty cosy, the bar area is my favorite. It should be a good spot for a date night!"}
{"text":"The corn and crab chowder is outstanding! It always has been and remains an unbeatable menu choice. I could happily make a meal out of a bowl of it with some of their crusty bread. Fabulous!!! I tried a side new to me. It was a fried rice with crab meat. Wow! Scrumptious! Those dishes were worth the trip. However, my entrée was a fail.  The rainbow trout on the menu used to be wild caught, so I expected it to still be wild caught and ordered it. DISAPPOINTING! The texture was dry and the taste just wasn't the same, lacking those omega 3 fats. They had tried serving the mango sauce I ordered for it plastered over the top to hide the difference, I guess, instead of serving it on the side as they used to, when they were proud of their product. The mango sauce also was spicier than before, to hide the tastelessness, I suppose, but I don't like spicy. I didn't notice it being any less expensive than before, but it was way less taste and texture, and less healthful, too. I felt cheated on the most expensive dish in my dinner."}
{"text":"The food was great!  Never been there before, always wanted to try it...was very delicious. I made reservations and since we got there early, we had a short wait. Was offered free soft drinks while our table was getting ready; nice touch....The waiter made some suggestions that were on point! The only things that would have made this better was the space. They really need to expand the seating area. Tables were so close together that it looked like management tried to stuff as many people into a square room as possible,  not good."}
{"text":"Good food, good service. Nice wine selection. Only crticism is that the tables are very close. Not very good for an  intimate meal. But one of the better restaurants in Crocker Park."}
{"text":"I have more than excitedly dined at the Bonefish Town Square location at least a half-dozen times in the recent past...with both service and food quality so consistent that I order the same entree each visit - without hesitation.  The Summerlin location, disappointingly falls short.  Two entrees ordered arrived well after 35 minutes of wait (at a non-busy 3pm serving time)...entrees appeared and tasted as if they had been sitting under a heat lamp for at least an hour before service -- reminiscent of pre-made, glazed over desserts that sit in diner display coolers for weeks/months.  Lobster served lukewarm and rice with no flavor and a cool crunch, as well, the cocktail menu seemed to have undergone an unfortunate and muddled revision.  Service was genuine and friendly, no qualms there...though for a $100.00 meal -- absolute stellar food quality is by no means an unreasonable factor to expect/demand. I do remain an overall fan of Bonefish restaurants...though I will allow the Summerlin location a second chance hopefully and once these new growing pains have been resolved."}
{"text":"Awesome experience at Bonefish today for a late lunch.  Chilean Sea Bass prepared to perfection along with potato au gratin and streamed broccoli.  Service was prompt and every detail was on point.  Crocker has added some great restaurants over the last few months and this place will do well with the selection of fresh seafood and great service."}
{"text":"If I could give this place a negative star I would! Horrible service! Had a reservation and an hour later was told it'd still be 30 min! When I told the manager she informed me it was out of their control and she got mouthy with me! Went to flemings and was seated right away! Flemings was amazing and great service! Skip bonefish and go to flemings!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed  in the ongoing food quality and service level. I have been a weekly dinner customer of Bone Fish since it first opened. Although I have been a loyal and pleased patron ( would have rated 4 or 5 stars) from the beginning--  recent experiences have caused me to decide not continue my weekly dinners. Over the past 4 weeks I have noticed a decline in the quality of the seafood. Initially, I assumed my more recent experience with the poorer food quality  was simply a one- off and thought my next visit would be a better experience. It never happened. Something is very wrong with this place and this unfortunate trend in poor food quality has continued.This sense was corroborated by a recent visit when I took an out-of--town guest with me. My guest had to returned 2 not fully cooked seafood items. The resulting cooked portion was inedible! The manager and waitstaff were unapologetic and made no effort to address the circumstance. Last night was the final straw. I made advance reservations (I was put on hold for 5 minutes while the Bone Fish rep looked for a pen) and when I arrived they indicated they had no record of my reservation. They admitted the mistake and said they would seat me at the next open table. I waited and observed 5 groups be seated over the next 20 minutes. When I approached the front desk they again maintained they had no record of my reservation. I spoke to manager and described my situation. He had no interest in resolving my circumstance nor did he even offer an apology. Be assured I am done with this place."}
{"text":"I have been to at least 3 dozen Bonefish restaurants.  This one left me unimpressed.  Multiple items were \"Sold Out\" by mid-evening ( 8 P.M.) including the Bang Bang shrimp. Was also told that all the specials were \"Sold Out.\"  Service was not up to what I have come to expect from the Bonefish.  Servers almost seemed annoyed to be there. The food was very good as always.  No complaints there. I do recommend the Bonefish.  Just not this location."}
{"text":"My family and I went to the bonefish grill tonight and I can tell you this is no three start restaurant... the ahi tuna is amazing! !! Excellent sweet potatoes as well! Will defibtely return and will recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to check this place for a while. I love sea food so, I thought fish restaurant should be great place to go. We had Karissa for a server and she was very fast and efficient. My favorite thing was the bang bang shrimp. That by itself was a 5 star for me, loved it! We had also the fish tacos, that came with mango salsa. They don't have regular salsa?! The tuna steak was good but seems like it was missing something, a little tasteless? And the Haddock fish I liked a lot. The berry martini was excellent! Overall, it was good enough so, we are going to be back."}
{"text":"My wife and I dined here for the first time and we will definitely be back. We had the bang bang shrimp which is delicious. The food was fantastic. Service was great. Our waitress Brittany was absolutely amazing. She managed to give great service without being pushy or annoying."}
{"text":"I stumbled across Bonefish while planning a shopping day with my friend. We love brunch so we looked up brunch options in town square. Bonefish had an amazing bottomless bubblies (mimosas, bellinis, sangrias etc.) along with an entree for only $19.90!!! I loved that they allow you to switch between the bottomless drink options. And the food was great too! Lots of choices! Service was amazing and server answered any questions I had about their menu! Would highly recommend if you enjoy brunch. I plan to come back and check out their happy hour next time!"}
{"text":"I love this place so unfortunately I'm troubled to write this review. I went to Bonefish on Saturday. Loved the food I ate, no complaints! About an hour or so after I left I started feeling really bad. Uncomfortable bad. Nauseated, dizzy, just flat out sick. Later that night I was extremely sick. Not good things happening within my body. The next day I was still very sick. I even napped and I'm a mom of three and I just don't do that. Now my husband had a small portion of what I ate and he got a little sick too. I dont know what was wrong with my fish but I'm wishing that I hadn't ate it."}
{"text":"Came here many times , some dishes are fantastic, like fish and chips, Chili sea bass are my favorite, Ahi tuna bowl is not that great, full of the rice on bottom which is waste my money ,"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!   we discovered it by accident. We were on our way to kabuki in town square and took the back route to avoid some traffic. Then we saw Bonefish and decided to try it out! We've been back at least 2 other times in the last 6 weeks.   My boyfriend and I have a gluten sensitivity and every time we've come the server has been knowable on what they can do to accommodate us.  My favorite drink there so far is the Hawaiian Martini.  LOVE the salmon and sea bass!!    We tried the flourless brownie it was delicious for the first few bites, but i couldn't make it past the first brownie it was a bit to rich for me and gave me a headache. but kudos on the yummy tasting gluten free brownie!  Creme brulee is our all time fav!"}

{"text":"Newbie! Glad I came. Great new place!  Warm and welcoming atmosphere.  Service is fantastic. Will was so attentive to my table as well as my neighbors. He was very friendly and helpful. He's attentive to each person and theirs needs...not just the table as a whole. Glad to have been taken care of by him. Even both managers, John and Rhonda, checked in with our tables and made friendly small talk along the way. Great team of people here.   The food was also great. I am a fan of the Thai coconut shrimp and key lime pie. My neighbors are regulars and were raving about the steaks, Caesar salad and chocolate creme brûlée. Said they come here all of the time and love it. They are from Chicago and excited to have a Bonefish Grill. They drive here all the way from Surprise!  I will back for sure! So much more menu to try."}
{"text":"The service was horrendous! The food? Mediocre. The nearby mall was so jammed with people and all of the restaurants were jammed as well. We decided to go outside of the mall and found the bonefish Grill. I thought I found a great place to have some seafood. I knew this was a chain restaurant, but decided to try it anyway. It was absolutely terrible. Our waiter was so slow that it took him 1/2 an hour to tell us that our food would be \"a couple more minutes\". After another 15 minutes, we finally received our cold food. My friend had salad with coconut shrimp. It was cold. I had problems with scallops and a side of rice and broccoli. The scallops were hot but everything else was cold. My guy had fish tacos and they were cold. When I asked the waiter what the problem was, he said \"the scallops took longer than I thought\". Seriously? Does he know that scallops take four seconds to cook? Never again for this joint!"}
{"text":"Our server was sweet and did a great job, that's for one star. The other star is for the bread and pesto. I ordered the fish and chips and the fish didn't have any flavor and initially it felt like grease was dripping everywhere. Although I am not very shocked, MANY chain restaurants have went downhill recently but if I were you, I would skip and go eat across the street even at Wild East Pan Bistro."}
{"text":"I went last night for a Perfect Pairing Event at Bonefish. It was my first time going to a event and will do it again! My friend and I went and they sat us with 2 other people. We had great conversation about traveling and wine. The food was great especially the Cobia which is a fish in the shark family. The wines were ok I did like the Pinot Grigio. The service was excellent and it lasted 2 hours. I really like how they gave us a sampling of 3 entrees to pair with the wine. I left full and a little tipsy! Also this event would be perfect for a date night with a special someone."}
{"text":"So my son convinced me to go to Bonefish grill. This restaurant is beautiful inside. Nicely decorated. We sat outside because hey it's the end of May and still beautiful out. I started with coconut shrimp that was to die for. For dinner I enjoyed the potstickers and some truffle mac & cheese. I really wasn't a fan of the mac & cheese and probably would not get it again. The potstickers were really good, I had never had a beef potsticker. My son and his girlfriend both had the burgers and seem to enjoy them. My husband really enjoyed the glazed pork chops but was not a fan of the green beans. My mother-in-law absolutely loved the filet and said it was better than outback. I have to mention the bread was fabulous, awesome and very tasty. Overall the food was really really good. I think it is a bit pricey though.  The waitress we had was good and attentive. I thought that the time between the appetizer and dinner was a little lengthy. I think the Bonefish grill is deserving of 4 stars and I can guarantee we will be back."}
{"text":"Bang bang shrimp appetizer is a favorite... Shrimp Thai Bowl was great too. Nice place... Good service."}
{"text":"Bang bang shrimp are to die for, grouper is amazing and so is their broccoli which I find is strange to say but everything is great here that I have tried."}
{"text":"Food was very nice but the service staff, while acceptable, was unfriendly.  My table of 6 asked what sides came with entrees. We were never told of the up charge for a side salad ($2) or asparagus ($3.50) ....brought it to the attention of the waitress, she could have cared less.  And to top it off we are Dine Rewards members...gave the waitress our phone number and she said she gave us credit for the visit ($80 for 2 people). There is now no record of our visit and we paid in cash!!!!! No credit given and we have no way to prove it.  Very, very disappointed."}
{"text":"Every time I go here I am inpressed.  Very pretty, casual restaurant with great food and drinks at a pretty decent price.  Bang bang shrimp is a must as is the salmon or Chilean sea bass with the pan asian sauce.  The martinis are great as well, especially the pomegranate martini.    They have bang bang specials on Wednesday which was a pleasant surprise as the appetizer was half off!  They also have a promotion if you buy $100 in gift cards you get a $25 gift card for free.  I love this place."}
{"text":"We go every Sunday after church and enjoy the food and service at this location. We are regulars and the hostess is very sweet and knows our girls by name. On Sunday there is a brunch menu and it's delicious.  Highly recommend this restaurant!  Family friendly, clean and tasty!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I just moved to Charlotte a few months ago.  This was one of the MANY places that sent us a 'coupon' to get us in, it worked!  We will be back again.  The dumplings were delicious, he loved his fish, and my chicken with goat cheese and spinach was out of this world!"}
{"text":"I want to be clear, I am only reviewing the fish n chips.  Our server was awesome and my wife's meal and our appetizer were great, but I have to remark on the fish n chips.  It was bad.  I was suspicious when I was told the FnC was tilapia.  I should have trusted my instincts.  It is just not a good fish.  I know a lot of people love it, but to me it tastes swampy in the way catfish and frog legs can.  FnC should be made with haddock or cod.  Period.  I would never order this again from this restaurant.  It's shameful that a fish place would try to pass off tilapia as an acceptable fish for FnC.  When  I go back I will definitely try something else."}
{"text":"As per my other reviews of other Bonefish Grill locations, it's no secret that I love this company. The food is of good quality and executed very well.   Our service at this particular location was outstanding. Top notch. Will be back. Happy that a Bonefish is open right down the street from me.  Also, hard to please parents came with me for lunch and after bitching about going ended up very happy with the whole experience, food, etc., and will also be back."}
{"text":"As with my other Bonefish review for a different location, this place is wonderful. I constantly crave the Bang Bang shrimp tacos, and the fish is cooked to perfection every time. Perfect for date night. Romantic, classy atmosphere, and can be casual or dressy. Both go.   Service was equally great. Had a great lunch here."}
{"text":"Pleasant fast service and extensive food selection.   The meal I had was delicious, and the service was excellent. They even put our doggie bag items in s bag and hung them nicely on a hook so that we wouldn't forget to take them home  For dessert they even have a flourless brownie!"}
{"text":"What a difference location makes!  I was given a Gift Card and visited the Matthews location.  It was a disaster.  We decided to give the Pineville location a try. Five Stars all the way around.  We ordered off the Tuesday menu.  We left stuffed with delicious food. Whitney, our server, was perfect. She kept our glasses full but never was annoying.  The food arrived promptly and hot.  They even shelled my lobster for me.  We will return."}
{"text":"Unbelievably horrible service.   We made reservations and stated it was our anniversary.  We arrived on time and dressed up.  First, we were taken to a booth next to the bathroom; we asked to be seated elsewhere. We then  were offered a booth in the bar.  Meanwhile, all the tables in the main dining room were empty as was another booth not by the bathroom. We then asked to speak to a manager.  A woman came to us dressed like she worked in the kitchen, not professional.  After expressing that she felt both seating options should have been acceptable she offered one of the many open tables.   She was not very apologetic.  We left and went to the Palm."}
{"text":"Service was slow to start even at 4:00pm but then picked up. Happy hour is a joke though. Better called mildly amused hour. I guess $1 off well drinks and house wine and no food make for HH menus these days."}
{"text":"This is a great place for dinner and brunch, as they have good food selections and drinks!  Their fish selections are always great, and their French toast is the best I've had in the area!  In addition, I love their sangrias... I've actually feel in love with that drink because of this restaurant.  Lol.  The service is good, but you may want to make a reservation for brunch, as they can get busy quickly.  The only downside to the brunch is that I wanted to order it and pick it up, but was told that they no longer allowed \"takeout\" for brunch items because the quality might not be as good when you get it home?  That was too bad, because at times I can't sit and stay but prefer to grab food while I'm out or returning from church.  If they don't allow to-go orders on Sundays (or for certain selections), they force people to go elsewhere for brunch."}
{"text":"The food is good, but the portions are more like appetizer size.  Have given it 3 chances, and brought 3 different people each time and everyone said it was just okay but they  wouldn't return.   The service was good 2 of the times.  The inside is very nice, and it could be a real hit if they overhaul the menu, and serve larger portions. It was mostly women eating when we were there.  I don't think most men would be satisfied with the portions!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here with my wife 2 nights ago.  The place was packed which was probably the reason for the very poor service.    Beverages took over 10 minutes to order and then over 10 more minutes to arrive.  When beverages finally arrived the waitress took our appetizer order but not our entree order???  I found that to be odd, but didn't say anything because it was my first visit to this establishment and wanted to wait and see what they would do.  When the appetizers arrived, about 25 minutes later, the waitress took our entree order.  When entrees arrived, about 40 minutes later, my wife and I had to lift up our dirty appetizer plates that weren't yet removed from the table, so that the server could place our entrees on the table.  The food was mediocre at best (Stuffed shrimp and Atlantic Salmon Oscar), cocktails were sub par and service was disjointed and bothersome.  Whoever is managing this location needs to pay closer attention to details.  There are plenty of other options in Birkdale that provide exceptional service.  We will not be back to Bonefish Grill."}
{"text":"We went to Bonefish tonight!  We had only met the bartender, Holly, once and yer she remembered us!  Great food and hospitality!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"I was definitely excited to try this place for a girls dinner party. When I arrived, I was greater by (who I assume) was the manager. Very friendly and helped me find my group. Once I sat down, it was nearly impossible to get a drink order in since all had already done so. Finally when we ordered din, I got a drink too. Our table had two waiters, which was confusing. You'd think by having two we'd have prompt service. Not the case. Wrong order, app brought out early when it was asked to be an entree, again took for ever to get my second drink... Oh and my entree came 15 minutes after everyone else's even though we ordered together. We asked twice about it... Then it popped up. They offered to spilt our checks, which was nice (we were prepared to pay cash). And when we got out checks, half were messed up. Then one of the waiters accused two of us for not paying for our drinks... When we explained they were on others tabs and we straightened it out, he never apologized. I realize group outings can be difficult for restaurants but we were a considerably easy table with a lot of blunders. Service, 2 stars (with the exception of the initial greeter/manager?)  I ordered the red sangria which was great! Tastes like grape juice, much sweeter than your average sangria. So may be a no-go for some. And the baja fish tacos with chips. A fresh mango salsa topping the tacos was definitely above par! My food was a solid 4.5 stars.   I'll return but most likely will hit the bar area."}
{"text":"Not only the food was great, the service was wonderful! We went there to celebrate mother's day and they were very busy, but still provided excellent service. You know you are appreciated there and I can't say enough good things about Bonefish Grill.  Must haves: bang bang shrimp and Chilean sea bass! their mango salsa was soooo grrrreat as well."}
{"text":"Had to wait, even though we had reservations. Food was cold. Would not accept gift cards, until told them food was cold. Had trouble with bill. Not good experience."}
{"text":"We watched as they tore down the old islands restaurant and built this new bonefish grill.  There were no signs telling us what was being built .   Sure am glad it was this place!  One of my friends is from Florida and he said it was a great place.  Finally went Saturday night.  There was a 30 minute wait at 7ish as expected.  We got a seat at the bar in 10!  Bartenders where comical and attentive.  I had the bang bang shrimp appetizer.  WOW!  Great flavor with a little crunch.  My girlfriend had the mahi mahi with broccoli and loved it.  I had the scallops and shrimp and they were also good.  I will try something else next time though.   Make reservations on the weekend to get right in!   Nice patio too!   It wasn't too loud in there either like one of the other reviews said!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for our anniversary. My husband ordered the calamari which was bomb! :) Happy hour!! Loved it!! Very clean place."}
{"text":"Always wanted to check Bonefish Grill out since it open just never got around to it. I read some reviews (most part seem more positive then negative ones) and really like the logo/concept of the restaurant. It really has little bite of everything from Steaks, Seafood, and just good diversity throughout the menu. I like one section of the menu can choose the cooking option you want from healthy to standard fare. I went with the family so got see few different items on the menu for my first time. My first impression the entrance really stood out cause not that many restaurants that have the revolving door. It nice with the Bonefish Grill logo and kind feel like taking you on spin into another world or Bonefish Grill World. lol. The whole interior has very modern decor from the bar area to the dining room. The booth that are higher off the ground on one side then have middle area that more like high bar stool tables and then again more booths but lower then the other side. The waitstaff all wearing chef wears coat that was confusing at first impression. I work as cook. So I was like wow so the chef brings out all the food. Nice. Once sat down found out just the waitstaff uniform but one that could appreciate. The decor from all these different style selfs all decorated with different stuff really make for great atmosphere. They do have private dining room or private room that can rent out.    The food.....Like mention went with my brother family so got try few appetizers and got see few dishes. We started with Steamed Edamame and Fried Calamari. The Steamed Edamame it tasted like they steamed it in some kind of tea. It was really good. It was steamed perfect once got into every edamame was nice hot, moist, and cooked right. It refreshing then your normal oil sauté edamame. I can do both but always nice mix things up in life from time to time. The presentation must say LOVE it!!! Not only cause the bottom basket can put shell in. But feel like keeps it warmer longer with the bamboo steam baskets (or think dumplings that the basket they use). It also come with the seasoning but our waitress warn use can be overpowering and if want just put little bit or none on top. I felt like tasted great without it. The Fried Calamari. The thing that stood out for me not only was it well battered, crispy, moist, and the peanut dipping sauce was nice change instead of red sauce get at every italian restaurant. Also they add bell peppers added nice touch and different texture along with the calamari. Both appetizers would highly recommend.  My entree went with the Spicy Tuna Bowl. Not sure the best way to describe it then LOT of things going on and none of it collectively made much sense. Sometimes less can be better especially comes to presentation. Spicy Tuna Bow all over the place. The Seared Tuna enjoyed. It had nice even sear all around, cooked perfect, and tasted like sushi grade tuna. The passion fruit salsa was not very good. Usually the ratio of passion would be more then the peppers and onions. It was completely opposite. It was to citrus or vinegar based. The carrot salad whatever was exactly whatever had no flavor and no real purpose except fill up more space. The avocado must say was perfect ripe, nice green not bruises, and tasted fresh delicious. The jasmine rice was great. So for me the whole dish was mixed of emotions. I ordered side of truffle mac and cheese. I have to put it up there with some of the best truffle mac and cheese in Vegas. I loved the balance of truffle and cheese. Like the breadcrumb crust on top they finish the dish. The curly noodles instead of your normal macaroni noodle added nice touch. My brother ordered ride eye that looked great. Sister-in-law ordered one of the street tacos again looked great. They both enjoyed there meal. One of my nieces she ordered the Kobe burger. Dam that good looking burger!!!   The service was excellent. Our server was fabulous the whole night.   I was surprise thinking would be pretty pricey but it very reasonable. Not cheap but still less then strip prices and get high end feeling just looking at the interior decor. I can see myself coming back again try more of the menu"}
{"text":"Disappointed with my time at this restaurant. First we walk in to like 7 people at the host stand and not one person greets us until we stood and stared at them for like 30 seconds. Weird.  The tables were covered with weird table clothes and paper on top. It looked awful and was annoying to hear all the servers walking around crumpling paper everywhere.  My boyfriend and I ordered the Norwegian salmon. His was with spinach and lump crab on top.. except there was literally no crab on it. Why pay the extra $5 when all they did was throw leaves of spinach on top?  Also our server checked on us only one time when we first got our food and I had to flag down someone to get a box. Finally she came with the check after a long time. She didn't seem to really care about her work. She was short and had an attitude."}
{"text":"Bang bang shrimp is absolutely delicious!  Don't let the word 'spicy' fool you, it was just the perfect balance of spiciness and creaminess. The fish and chips that my husband got was pretty decent but compared to the bang bang shrimp, it was rather bland. Very reasonable prices and comfortable ambiance.   Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Between a 3-4 as the bottomless bubbles brunch is a good deal for 20 bucks!  Went their with girlfriends and had a great time!  I had the surf and turf eggs Benedict which the both the steak and lobster were too tough although the potatoes au gratin were really good.  That is why a 3 rating, drinks were good and a good price just a little disappointed in my main meal.  Bottomless deal includes a meal from a big range if choices plus bottomless blackberry sangrias, mimosas or bellinis."}
{"text":"Disappointing happy hour value . No specials on appetizers & minimal discount on drinks."}
{"text":"Went for my girlfriend's birthday. Had reservations at 6 and were seated immediately. The service was great, we both felt welcome and the waitstaff was attentive to our needs and helpful with recommendations. The prices were a little more than I was fully cool with, but still reasonable for a fresh quality meal.  The food was excellent. We ordered the ceviche as an appetizer and really enjoyed it. I got the grilled scallops and shrimp, was given all of the sauces to use to dip and all were tasty. She had the haddock that was on the special and it tasted very fresh. We were treated to dessert on the house for her birthday and thoroughly enjoyed the creme brule.  Drink selection was good. I'm a beer drinker and liked the options they had, even though it wasn't many. She had the sangria as well as the pomegranate and sage martini and liked both a lot. Overall, we would definitely come back and recommend to friends, family, and strangers."}
{"text":"We have always had a great experience at this location. Tonight was a different story. We sat at the dirty bar and were greeted and given our drinks and bread. In the interim, the server spilled a drink on another customer. The bar was not full and the other bartender was handling the service bar. We waited 10 minutes while our bartender took her time (no sense of urgency) and did not acknowledge us in anyway. We asked for the bill and left without another word from this bartender. My husband spoke with the manager on duty who said okay several times but never apologized. Needless to say, we will never return."}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to take our husbands out for dinner at Bonefish on a Saturday night.  Mini date night. :)  We were seated immediately at a nice tall top in the bar area.  Great ambiance and I have to say for the crowd they had not loud at all.   We ordered drinks and my friends who had gotten there a bit before us had already ordered Bang Bang Shrimp and I ordered crab cakes.  They bring out a nice fresh loaf of bread with olive oil for a nice light snack.  Our shrimp arrived and it was amazing!  Our crab cakes were amazing as well so full of crab and the sauce was a nice touch.   My hubs and I eat ordered the crab corn chowder and he ordered the steak while I went with their chicken as my friend was getting the other item I was eyeing, the tilapia.  The soup was so nummy, large chunks of crab through out the soup.  So GOOD!  Our main course arrives and it looks amazing.  Sadly, they overcooked my hubs' steak so he had to wait a bit.  The manager and the GM came over both to apologize which was quite thoughtful of them. My chicken had goat cheese and artichokes layered on it making it even better.  My green beans were smothered in butter which is not good for me but great for the hubs who ate them while waiting for his refire. :) I did taste my friends tilapia and it was a good choice as well.   Now to the reason I gave them only 4 and really debated on giving them a 3.  Our service was HORRIBLE.  My hubs orders his soda with no ice.  She brings it with ice and doesn't apologize when he mentions it to her. Does she correct it on his refill?  Nope!  I brought it up to her on the side and then she brings him seltzer water instead of his Sprite.  During the entire meal our water glasses were empty and I had to ask one of the servers who brought out our food to get another glass of wine. Let me explain, she had 4 tables she was working and I really wasn't paying attention to what kind of service they were getting but both my girlfriend and i kept commenting that we really never saw her with anyone else.    Will we be back?  Of course, the food was awesome.  I think our waitress may have had an off night but we did have quite a few misses during our visit."}
{"text":"What I think of this restaurant I'm often think of Christopher Walken in the movie Pulp Fiction you know that scene when he's talking about the watch the watch that his father had held deep inside of his ass I'm not exactly sure how this relates to the quality or service of Bonefish but for some reason it just reminds me maybe because the place is a little overpriced and deep when side of town ass but yeah"}
{"text":"Movie and dinner with the girl's ended here with drinks.  The weekends are busy so if you don't make a reservation you may end up at the community table as we were, which turned out to be perfect for us.  I've never been a huge fan of Bonefish, mainly because the food is just ok to me.  I understand everyone loves the bang bang shrimp but I'm not in to shrimp like that.  I did enjoy the seasoned oil and bread, probably a little too much, but definitely the highlight of my meal.  I opted for the grilled salmon with oscar topping, and spinach....it was no different from me preparing it at home for half the price.  The servers were very attentive, so I probably would come back."}
{"text":"I was here for an early birthday lunch, my first time at any Bonefish Grill. I got the corn chowder and bang bang shrimp tacos, which were delicious. The soup was hearty with good size chunks of crab meat and the tacos were perfect: great seasoning, well presented, well cooked. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Second time here and enjoyed it as much as the first.  Can't say enough about the great customer service. I know some bartenders at other restaurants have issues about transferring tabs from bars to the dining room (I totally get it though I've worked for tips too) but these guys didn't have an issue and I made sure to leave some cash before heading to our table.  Wife had the white sangria and I had scotch and our glasses were never empty.   5/5 Calamari cooked to perfection.  Never had Calamari so soft and breading was just right. The sweet spicy Asian sauce was a nice change from the standard marinara.  5/5 Fontina Chops.  Tender and juicy.  The Marsala sauce wasn't too rich or overwhelming as other sauces.  Spend the extra $5 for the white truffle Mac and cheese.   Wife had the sirloin and crab cake and only had great things to say about it.   Didn't have enough room for dessert this time but on my first trip I remember having the key lime pie and being extremely happy.  Worth the extra 1000 calories   Will be back for sure. Reservations are highly recommended.  Perfect dining ambiance for either family and friends or business clients.  Has a very classy feel without the high prices."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch and was a little disappointed in that the silverware was very dirty even after being replaced twice. The fish tacos were very good as well as the side of coleslaw. The slaw was different than any other I've ever had - but good. We also had fish and chips with a side of fries. They were both very greasy and it seemed that the fryer was not up to temp. Perhaps the new restaurant has growing pains so we'll wait awhile before returning."}
{"text":"We had been to a Bonefish Grill in CA so decided to try the Birkdale Village location for dinner last night.  We had a reservation for 4 at 7:45 but did not get seated until almost 8:30. We ordered the Bang-Bang shrimp for an appetizer and it was really good. When we ordered our meal we were a bit disappointed to find that Bonefish does not offer clam chowder or a lobster bisque, they only have corn chowder with crab.  Hubby ordered it and said it was very good.  Two of us ordered the Chilean sea bass which was amazing....so delicious and cooked perfectly.  The big guy in our party asked how big the Tilapia Imperial was and was told by our server that it was a good sized portion.  The manager delivered that plate himself and the portion was a bit on the small side so he told the big guy that he would bring him another portion so he wouldn't be hungry!  (What other restaurant does that?)  Hubby ordered the steak and it was cooked perfectly.  For dessert the big guy ordered the brownie with ice cream & whipped cream, pronounced it really good and polished it off in no time flat!  There was a large party of 23 people next to us but the service was still excellent.  We'll definitely be going back to Bonefish Grill again!"}
{"text":"The food is good, service is good.  The one thing that has be going back is the bang bang shrimp.  I am not a big fan of shrimp but this dish is amazing."}
{"text":"HERE. WE. GO.  * Mahi Mahi: starting off with my least favorite--the mahi mahi was pretty dry. Even though they advertised it to be fresh and grilled to perfection. The seasonings that came on it, just weren't quite enough to supplement how dry it was and I didn't really care of it at all * Bang Bang Shrimp: I was expecting a bigger bang, but it was quite good. The portion of this dish was bigger than I expected, so theres a plus! The flavors were pretty good, but bordered along the line of popeyes shrimp with sauce on it. Not saying it's a bad thing, but I think I was expecting something a little different from the dish as a whole. I would probably order it as tacos or with a starch side because the flavors get to be a little much.  * Sea Bass: so first of all. I LOVE seabass. Make it miso seabass and I'm in heaven. Bonefish must have seen me coming because this dish is what really won me over. It was moist, flavorful, and absolutely delicious. Highly recommend and I know I'll be back to have it.  Overall, this place's food was good, not great, what really did it for me was the service! We had started at the bar and were readily attended to. I got a mule which was a bit sweet for me, but my friend got a cocktail and it was pretty good (forgive me for not remembering what exact drink it was). We made some small talk with the bartender and he was very gracious to keep refilling our water and getting our check promptly once our table was ready.  The waitress was really great. I need to start documenting their names, but blonde hair and super happy. She was amazingly attentive, gave some great recommendations and added to our conversation a bit she was very sweet and made our night at bonefish.   Overall, I've been to a good amount of places in Madison. For Seabass, I will definitely return and if not for that the service and the people.   happy eating!"}
{"text":"Tonight was a major disappointment.  Arrived at Bonefish at 7:00 without a reservation and had to wait 25 minutes.  That's understandable on a Friday evening, but it gave me a little time to look around.  Couldn't help think what a low budget place this is.  There's just nothing interesting or nice about it.  Cheap finishes, unarticulated surfaces, bathrooms that could be found in your run of the mill McDonald's...environment 2 out of 5.    After we were seated (2 adults, 2 children), we waited over 10 minutes for someone to take our drink order, and only after we asked the hostess for help.  Not a good start.  When the waiter finally showed up, he tried pretty hard, but everything was very slow, and with kids, slow is tough...service 3 out of 5.  The salads came first.  Two \"watermelon salads\" consisting of a few small cubes of watermelon, a few small cucumber wedges, and a lot of leaves of I'm not sure what, all swimming in oil.  Great idea but way too much oil.  Then I had scallops wrapped in bacon.  Good, but the relish that came with them ruined the flavor.  My wife had a filet.  She ordered it medium well and it came out very well, and completely dry.  Sent it back and the 2nd try was perfectly cooked, but they butterflied it for some unknown reason.  She thought it was ok; I thought it was tender, not tasty.  The kid's food was fine (chicken and broccoli), but they were out of kid's cups and we had to monitor their drinks very carefully, since one is 3 and the other just turned two...food 2 out of 5.  This would have been bad enough until my pant leg touched the underside of the table and pulled down a piece of gum that had been stuck to it.  Scraped and rubbed my jeans for 10 minutes and got most of it off.  The place was overcrowded, and the vibe seemed fairly old.  Music was elevator type; waiters, bus boys and expeditors all wear the same ill-fitting jackets with faded black pants in various shades of gray.  Most of them looked like they hadn't showered...ambience and vibe - 1 out of 5.  Everything was medium priced to expensive.  The filet was $26 with corn on the cob.  Shots were $9.50...value - 1 out of 5.  We wanted it to be good, but it's a place we'll never go back to, and frankly have a hard time understanding some of the positive reviews.  It's the kind of experience you'd expect from Applebee's but at twice the price (and we aren't Applebee's fans).  Bottom line - don't bother."}
{"text":"The food is always top notch!  We get the sushi which I crave and it never lets me down plus the fish and chips which are not cod ....tilapia but have a tempura batter which is delicious!!  Atmosphere, well none but servers are exceptional to make up for lack of ambiance.  Oh well we keep going!!"}
{"text":"Let me start with, I really like Bonefish. In the last 45 days, I have probably gone to the Pineville-Matthews location 3-4 times. This is my second time at the Huntersville location.  So, my review is more like what I've come to expect from the Bonefish franchise.  The Good * the Bang Bang Shrimp was amazing!  * the server Andrew was attentive. * I had an issue with my food, and it was taken care of pretty quickly. * the chicken teriyaki was tasty. * the bread/oil was fantastic.  The Bad * compared to the lamb at the other location- the lamb here was... Less than pleasant.     -the plate the lamb came out on, was super hot. The lamb, however, cold to the touch. (They did bring out a new, hot plate).     -the flavor of the lamb was bland, although they threw a lot of sauce on top of the lamb pops.     -the consistency of the lamb was very rubbery. It required more chews than I felt it deserved.  * the Pear Martini tasted like it came from a pre-made mix. I had 2. The first one was good. The second drink was way stronger, and a little more bitter, than the first.  Overall, it's a nice place to go. As a matter of personal preference, I will stick to the other location."}
{"text":"Love this place!! If you're looking for fresh seafood in Ohio this is the place to be! Definitely on the pricey side but worth it. Excellent service, from George for lunch! The special pear martini was divine!"}
{"text":"I have frequented Bonefish grill on many occasions and I have to say that the food and service are consistent and satisfactory every time I go.   I once ordered a plate of fried calamari as a starter. For some reason, our calamari came with small pieces of shrimp mixed in. Being allergic to shrimp, this was unacceptable. We alerted the waiter. Not only did the waiter take the plate back immediately, but the manager came out, apologized profusely, brought out some fresh calamari with no shrimp in it, and comped our drinks. The manager continued to check up on us that night and made sure the rest of our night was perfect.  As far as entrees go, the Spinach Bacon Gorgonzola Swordfish is a must try here (whenever they have it, as it is only on special during certain parts of the year). Absolutely splendid use of Gorgonzola cheese cheese on fish.The bacon bits give the swordfish just a tiny bit of a crunch that make the meal that much more enjoyable. I have ordered this several times and it is definitely one of the best swordfish plates I have ever had."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch and ordered the lobster and filet mignon benedict because it sounded interesting. In my opinion, the flavors of the benedict did not go well together. The hollandaise sauce was heavy, and the English muffin was on the soggy side. My friends got the shrimp benedict and the lobster and asparagus omelet, both of which they seemed to enjoy. As Bonefish is a seafood restaurant, I think I'd probably have better luck ordering from the lunch or dinner menu.   Service was good- no complaints there. Will try something different if I find myself back here again."}
{"text":"Just updating my review! Still awesome and delicious great service and drinks. I had the best lemon drop ever! The manager even came over to check on us and said how they all thought the lemon drops are the best!"}
{"text":"Going to Bonefish this Friday July 30th I live their fish& chips! Mmmm and last x jan 2018 I& my friend went both had fish& chips didn't disappoint us! So much had to take it home. And what is neat they changed fries to thinner ones and it came the fish was still sizzling. I dint just judge on food- its the treatment I get being disabled in chair& how they seat you in a power chair. They were so nice to me my friend was 20 min late and server brought me without asking me a basket of warm bread and a olive oil dip and it was a nice sized loaf  warmed and soft mmm it was so cold outside the server never bothered you if your lunch companion was late. Please go here I hope to get bang bang shrimp appetizer and well if full will bring fish& chips homeward bound!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit. The food was excellent and Debra my server could not have been any better than she was already. I will definitely be back soon. The prices were in line for the type of restaurant this is."}
{"text":"I came to eat here with my boss and some collegues. The servers are all very friendly and kept the liquor coming. The food was fresh and flavorful. We ordered calamari and dumplings as appetizers. Both were very tasty. I ordered a salmon entree, it was quite tasty as well. We ate here on a Wednesday evening and there wasn't any wait. The restrooms were very clean. Prices are decent."}
{"text":"Last time my wife and I came here, we had a great meal. The bang-bang shrimp was delicious, my Kobe burger was flavorful, and her seared tuna dish was satisfying. That was almost a year ago.  We came back here recently with another couple. The bang-bang shrimp is still impressive. I ordered the Oscar Wild Mahi Mahi, which was one of the specials and came broccoli, mashed potatoes, and asparagus. The portion of the fish was measly. My palm was bigger than the whole thing. It was dry and kind of bland. Completely disappointed.  My wife ordered the Tilapia Imperial, which is one of their popular dishes, paired with steamed spinach and potatoes au gratin. She really enjoyed the potatoes and the tilapia, but did mention the sauce was too sour with too many capers. Luckily, she likes capers so she didn't mind it too much.   Service was good. Our server was informative, attentive, and had a sense of humor without being lame.   I wouldn't count this place out yet. Maybe I won't order any fish next time."}
{"text":"Thursday night about 6 pm Beautiful building with outdoor patio. Immediate greeting by 3 attractive Hostesses. Server Ron was very helpful and knowledgeable. They use  a held order I -pad. Cool. Bang bang shrimp was piled high and delicious.  The ultimate dirty martini was very smooth and hit the spot. Happy hour specials! My char fish was just ok. My business partner's  fish selection was very small. Both the fish portions were tiny. The creme brûlée was very satisfying! Great atmosphere and service. The manager was visiting tables and seemed to know quite a few guests! Major plus! This particular location was much better than the 2 I've been to in the Chicago area and several in Florida."}
{"text":"If you want to break the savings account open then bring the family here. No selection for the kids so I found this place as a bring the lucky lady date night. The fish selection is good but pricey, plain n simple. I'd go to red lobster before I'd go here again. The menu is scarce at best. Can you tell I wasnt overwhelmed?"}
{"text":"Tonight was one of the worst experiences I've had at bonefish. I thought the \"thing\" frozen into the ice cube left in my martini was no big deal....until the food arrived. Bang bang had almost no sauce and was chewy rather than crispy. I had been hungry for this specific item....that's why I went. To make things worse, the ahi tuna sashimi was almost cooked THROUGH!   The bar tending staff fixed my drink, but they stopped talking to me after that, and I was kind about it. The icing on the cake was the elderly lady slurring her words (loudly) to someone at the bar.  I know they've had some changes in management here, but the food quality hadn't noticeably changed until now.... I guess I should change the location I go to. So sad because this was one of my favorites close to home."}
{"text":"A party of six and not one complaint about anything, the appetizers were amazing, the corn chowder with crab was delicious, probably the best I have ever had. Our meals were prepared perfectly, 4 people ordered seafood and 2 ordered surf and turf, the comments on the steaks were great. The seafood dishes were better than expected, I would love to rate this place more than 5 stars.. Seriously great food and wonderful service."}
{"text":"Nothing like it used to be for the money. Fish was so so. Bathroom was gross. Take your own TP"}
{"text":"Crab crusted pompano. Delicious!!"}
{"text":"I came and the waiters were friendly and suggestive and checked on my table constantly so I gave a five star for that and the bang bang shrimp were the best choice of an appetizer you have to try them"}
{"text":"A group of 6 went to Bonefish Grill to eat dinner. The place was dark and we had to view the menu using a tiny head lamp. It was not fun reading the menu in the dark. Otherwise, it was a quiet place to have dinner.  For appetizers, we ordered the Cajun Chicken Egg Roll, Crab Cakes, and Calamari. The egg rolls were decent as it had chicken, roasted corn, onions and peppers. The crab cakes came in two round patties. I didn't like how saucy the crab cakes were. It didn't taste like crab cakes. I didn't try the calamari.   For the main entree, I wanted seafood since the restaurant is known for the fish. I ordered the sea bass w/ side of freshly steamed vegetables. Usually the veggies are cooked in butter. The fish was slightly overcooked for me. The pan-asian sauce was good over the fish.  Three of us shared the creme brulee. It came in a huge dish and was more than enough to feed us. The creme brulee wasn't as light as I expected, so I just ate mostly the topping.  Prices are expensive, but the service is good."}
{"text":"The staff was accommodating to a large group of 9 adults and children. Service was good, food was cooked and seasoned well. There was a bit of a wait for drinks and appetizers, but the server was responsive and the the pace improved. At the end of the meal, the manager advise she felt we had to wait too long (didn't seems too bad at the time), and comp'd us 15% off the bill. Bonefish was affordable and good quality."}
{"text":"I don't usually like to write reviews.This is my second time visiting Bone fish at this location.I had a great lunch on my first visit.However not today! I was very intimidated by our waitress.First of all our waitress did not bring the lunch special menu to us.I have to ask for the lunch menu after she return to our table 10 mins later.Then she informed us the Lunch Menu is Only Available by REQUEST!!!!!!!!!!!! Ok thanks for the information! I am a foodie and been to a lot of restaurants in Las Vegas.However to be told \"LUNCH MENU IS AVAILABLE  BY REQUEST \" is really unheard of ! Totally unbelievable if it's true on company policy!!!!"}
{"text":"Never been here. Planned dinner at Texas De Brazil next door but the wait was an hour and forty minutes.  One of the guys out with us mentioned Bonefish so we strolled over and were seated within 5 minutes.   Our server, John, was cool.  Drinks were properly mixed and the atmosphere was good.   Six of us in the group and everyone ordered steak. At a fish house. Filet was superb. Wish they had baked potato sides but the au graten potatos were awesome.   Will definately be back."}
{"text":"Really good food and great service! Try the spicy tuna bowl and the pumpkin ravioli. I would recommend this restaurant 100%."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of having a late lunch at this location on Sat., 1/20/18 while out shopping.  Kevin C. was my server and was absolutely a joy!  He provided great suggestions on what to try (as I haven't been there in a while) and was so friendly and engaging.  I ordered the stuffed lobster w/asparagus and mashed potatoes with a glass of red wine.  Upon leaving, I introduced myself to Phillip, mgr. to express the warm front-of-the-house reception.  He was so receptive to my compliments and I offered to write this review of my dining experience.  It was one of the best restaurant experiences I've had in a while in Charlotte!  I'm a major foodie and always looking for an elegant dining experience out. It was a clean, inviting environment, professional and friendly/engaging staff and the food was wonderful!  Keep up the good work and thanks for a wonderful dining experience. I'll definitely be back and bring friends. Ray Clark"}
{"text":"Cool spot. This is a chain I like. I really like bang bang shrimp, and the steaks are \"decent\".  Honestly, I don't often get steak from places that are not \"upscale\". That's because I have been spoiled by high quality steak houses. So when I go other places, I usually don't order steak, because I am normally disappointed. But Bonefish does a good job and represents their price point pretty well, I think. So I don't find ordering a filet mignon from them. Now, their ribeye seems to often have an excessive amount of fat on it. More than it should, but the flavor is good. You just feel like you didn't get the meat you should have.  I did order mine Oscar style, and the crab meat they topped it with tasted good, but they were tiny chocolate chip sized bites of crab. A little disappointing. The sauce added good flavor tho. It's a decent spot. What you would expect from this chain. So in that respect, they are spot on."}
{"text":"My cousin and I popped in hoping for brunch on a Saturday but it's only available on Sunday :( Instead we each enjoyed a cocktail, an order of bang bang shrimp and went on our merry way. It was super slow which was nice but I'd rather battle the crowd and enjoy bottomless mimosas and brunch food on Sunday."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my experience at Bonefish for the most part. I felt like the service was a tad slow, but not bad. We ordered the lobster chowder to start. It was good. Although, I  wish it would have come with a crusty piece of bread. We also had the bang bang shrimp which was great. Prices were comparable to other similar chains. I'd go back again."}
{"text":"We shrimp tacos and fish tacos, amazing !!  Server did excellent !   I would recommended this place any day!"}
{"text":"This place used to be good--the fish tacos & shrimp tacos were great. Then they changed the menu and things went terribly wrong."}
{"text":"I found me a great go to spot. I've had the Bang Bang shrimp before but what the did with the stuffed Tilapia was amazing.   The Oyster Rockefeller was delicious."}
{"text":"I went on a Sunday with a group of 4. I would say the fish is fresh and that is hard to find in Charlotte. The server was like a robot but did his job. One of my friends went into the woman room and said it was a mess. I am new to the Charlotte area and will give It another shot. I heard a lot of great things about it."}
{"text":"After all of these years I had still never been to the bonefish grill.   Parking was a little tough but it was 5:30pm on a Friday in Summerlin. Even though it was packed we did find two seats at the bar. It's open seating at the tables in the bar area as well. Local Tip (It's always happy hour during a golden nights game) The bartender was busy but we were greeted and served right away.   Happy Hour Items we ordered:  Mussels - these came in a red broth sauce which turned out to be flavorful.   Calamari - I enjoyed the peperoncini slices added good flavor to the Calamari. ( I didn't care for the sauce it came with)    Waygu Beef Sliders - traditional burger with good quality beef. A little plain but none the less it was still good and definitely a larger sized slider.   After a few brews and these appetizers I only had room to split an entree . We went with the Lilly's chicken which was juicy, topped with spinach, goat cheese and an artichoke heart which all seemed to blend together exceptionally well. Potato's Au gratin with a side of broccoli.   After 3 appetizers an entree a glass of wine and 2 beers our bill was $53.00"}
{"text":"I have been this restaurant 2 times what a luck same server served us.Last time was our birthday dinner server ruined our birthday dinner like before.Foods are delicious but server treat you so bad and she was so mean.We couldnt ask something bc her answers always mean.They need to educate their server!!!"}
{"text":"I tried this restaurant twice. The service is good and you can make a rezi which is a plus for a chain restaurant. Their signature dish is the Bang Bang Shrimp. It is so good, I could it that all day. However everything else is just meh. I've tried the shrimp/scallop meal and a fish sandwich. Totally tasteless. If I ever return, I'd just have the bang bang shrimp."}
{"text":"We have had the pleasure of dining at Bonefish twice in the past couple of weeks.  The food is awesome especially the Chilean Sea Bass.  The waitstaff is attentive and we especially like Adam and will request him from now on."}
{"text":"We visited the bonefish at town square today for the first time ever... the server did not seem to be interested nor did she really have the knowledge of the menu. I asked what was good and she said the shrimp but then said well everything is good....  ok, so I got the crab cakes.... well I guess if you consider those good they have another thing coming to them.... they were both burnt on the bottom and fell into a million pieces when I touched them with my fork. The crab cakes were tasteless besides the burnt bottoms but the sauce was good so I covered them with the amount of sauce I had, I also had a side of spinach that also was tasteless. The server didn't ask how things were till they were good and since I was starving I ate the bigger pieces I could scoop off the plate. My husband ate his fish sandwich but he even said it was just ok.... we ordered the shrimp for a appt but they never showed.. when we asked about them she said oooo I didnt know you wanted them.... so we just said it was fine and we didn't want them still. We won't be going back .... spent $50 bucks on a very disappointing lunch"}
{"text":"Imagine your favorite restaurant, which is 30 minutes away but you go there for every special occasion and any \"just because\" evening. It suddenly opens in your neighborhood. Has to be like Christmas morning right? Well, if so, then Bonefish Grill in Huntersville, NC is the Grinch.   We decided early this Saturday to make reservations for the entire family at the newest Bonefish Grill. When we called we were told that because they are \"so popular\" now they only take 20% reservations per night so that they won't turn away any walk in traffic.  So, let me get this straight... you will TURN AWAY a confirmed booking on the off chance of having to tell a walk in that they may have to wait?  Sorry, Bonefish... we would visit your restaurant at least 3 times a month and we would generally spend well over $150 each time. We will now be taking our business to another restaurant. One who actually WANTS our money and patronage."}
{"text":"When I saw they opened a BFG here in PHX, it brought great memories.  I used to go to the one in Tampa and St. Petersburg in FL all the time.  I love the chilean sea bass with the mango salsa.   We finally were able to go during HH on a Sunday and we had a great time.  The restaurant is a lot nicer than the ones in FL, really nice modern design.  We sat in the bar area in one of the booths.  The house chardonnay is pretty good, unoaked, light and at $3.25 during HH is a deal.  I had the special on this visit.  It was grilled salmon with choice of sauce (of course I chose the mango salsa) and mushroom ravioli and grilled veggies.  It was delicious.  Since the hubby doesn't like salmon, I got to eat the whole thing by myself.  My husband had the bang, bang shrimp tacos, they were three of them and larger than street tacos, so they were filling.  For dessert I had the key lime pie.   On our second visit my husband had the same and I had the blackened fish tacos.  For my side I chose the couscous and my hubby the asian slaw.  So far we have had a great experience and the size of the meals where more than enough to fill you up.  Second time I didn't get a dessert, I was too full."}
{"text":"I returned this year to be even more thoroughly impressed with the staff, service, and food at Bonefish Grill! Our server was attentive, friendly, and prompt. The highlight of the meal was the personal service from the culinary manager, Rod (maybe Ron, sorry!!). He greeted our table and when he discovered it was my boyfriend's birthday, he made sure to check in on us several times and even prepared an incredible dessert free of charge! He was absolutely amazing and made our experience so special.  I have nothing but praise for the staff and for their amazing food. We will definitely return for more special occasions, if not more often!"}
{"text":"I tried the corn chowder soup with lump crab, caesar salad, and the fish of the day with fries. This was my first time here so I didn't know what to expect. I wasn't thrilled about any of the dishes. Soup was OK, nothing I would go out of my way for. The caesar salad was pretty tasteless. I didn't finish my salad because it wasn't good at all. The fries were overcooked and dried out as if they reheated old fries. The fish of the day was cooked nicely but too much seasoning for my taste. I won't be itching anytime soon to return back here. The service was good. The manager checked up on us and the decor is modern and clean. Just wish the food was better."}
{"text":"Ate here with a co-worker of mine while visiting the Cleveland area. The food was on point. I had the special which was a swordfish. The waitress was very pleasant and made sure we were able to get a couple of drink orders in while happy hour was still going on. I would recommend this restaurant if you are in the Westlake area!"}
{"text":"Very tasty. Had the Ahi Tuna Steak cooked medium. Spectacular. Got the truffle mac for a side and was not disappointed. Waitress had wonderful recommendations for sides and drinks for the ladies.  Not a huge tap beer selection but I'm sure they'll get their crap together after demand for them goes up. \"Premium\" beer list has Spotted Cow, Blue Moon, and one other tap I couldn't remember.  No line at 730 on Tuesday night. Will probably be very busy for a while being so new."}
{"text":"This was my first time to bonefish and my husband and I sat at the bar we had two great bartenders Megan and Nicole despite the bar being packed they were very attentive and gave great advice on menu items. We had the bang bang shrimp, tilapia with mango salsa and the tuna bowl. They also provided us with deliciously fresh bread with oil and pesto. Everything tastes incredible and the white sangria was very refreshing. Happy hour drink prices are very reasonable however I did not order of it! I definitely plan on going back in the future!"}
{"text":"Very friendly and knowledgeable server.  Bang Bang shrimp is worth the trip alone.  My husband and I both enjoyed our meals very much.  good house cabernet as well.  i will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Day scallops were beyond superb.  As a diver for over 30 years, i have had the freshest scallops and these were fantastic.  Shawn says they only get them once a year, so hurry in.  You will not find fresher unless  you dive.  And perfectly seared rare. Wow"}
{"text":"Thank you Michael,  Paul and William - each of you did a fabulous job at helping us. Food was FABULOUS!  I order tuna almost everywhere and this was the BEST I've had in a long time.  The bang bang shrimp appetizer was INCREDIBLE! Coming again for sure."}
{"text":"Wines du Jour with chef Les Kincaid! Really good food : served a bit cool for the show but , I sat at the bar before show and really great happy hour! I will go back for dinner and can't wait to try more on the menus!! Ps on the happy he! Hit the blue cheese chips! Amazing!"}
{"text":"Their unlimited bubbly is a great deal for brunch. We got to alternate between champagne, mimosas, sangria, and peach bellinis- all of which were delicious.   I had the shrimp eggs Benedict while my friend had the surf and turf and both were cooked to perfection. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone planning a fun brunch with friends.   The service was great, lots of parking, and a great menu."}
{"text":"This place is ok.... You definitely just get enough food just to eat a small meal. Which sucks. You think for the prices you can at least get full.....? Nah. So I had their Chilean sea bass and boy did I wish I would e just gone to my regular Chilean sea bass spot. The service was ok, nothing impressive but at least we got our drinks and food accordingly.  The place looks nice and clean.  But I just don't think I will be back. I'd rather spend the money somewhere where I actually feel full after spending this kind of money..."}
{"text":"Some of the things here were on the salty side which I didn't like such as the soup and mashed potatoes. I do like the burger and fish with the lemon butter added."}
{"text":"Our first time here tonight. We are so disappointed. Food and service just horrible. Won't come back here again."}
{"text":"This rating is only regarding the bar. Food gets a 3.  The infused Manhattan is heavy on the infusion \"mix\" and light on the bourbon and vermouth.  The same applies to the rasberry martinis. Also, the glasses were filled just slightly over halfway. The drinks looked like someone had some sips before bringing them to our table. Stick with beer or wine at this place."}
{"text":"The good: The appetizers were good (Crabcakes, Calamari and Potstickers) Entree quality was also very good. Decent selection of desserts.   The bad: I have to agree with another reviewer that the IPADs take away from the ordering experience. It took the waiter almost 10 minutes to take an order for seven people.   Overall I give this a solid 4 stars. I will come back the next time I am in the mood for seafood."}
{"text":"This place absolutely sucks. It just continues to get worse. 1.5 hour wait, cause you got no one cooking. Staff is trying to smile. The food was not good. Overrated comes to mind. The fish had so much batter in it you could not tell it had fish in it, who the heck wants batter only. Wait for food to come to the table 1 hour 4 mins. Prices are ridiculous for what you get."}
{"text":"Service was horrible. We were not ready to order the first time we were asked, but about 25 minutes later we sure were. Appetizers were good.   I should have known better than to order steak from a fish place, but I did it anyway. Medium rare at this place has almost no pink left in the center. My buddy sent his back, I won't do that.   My second beer didn't look or taste anything like the first one. If you don't remember just ask me. I'll tell you what kind of beer I ordered.   I might try again, but if I got the same waitress I'd run."}
{"text":"---Rant---  Good food, great service!  I love great service and our waitress came back to ask how we were doing a few times, water was refilled very quickly, and we were asked more than once if the food was good.  The food was presented very well and was rather tasty, but much too salty for my taste.  Additionally, avoid the \"white sauce\"...it's super fattening and salty. Urg.  Besides that, the shrimp and fish tacos were pretty good.  The bacon-wrapped scallops were amazing. We enjoyed the appetizers a bit more than the main entrees so keep that in mind when ordering as it's likely you'll experience the same!  Side note - I left my credit card there! I only noticed the next day when I was leaving to come back home as I was at the gas station about to pay for gas! I called them immediately to see if they had it and as sure as Dahmer is burning in hell getting gang-raped by strap-on-wearing lesbians, they had it at the front desk waiting for me!  Great service, awesome dining experience.  Food could be a bit better~  ---Overall---  Service: A+.  Awesome~  Food: B.  Salty, secretly fattening, but damn good~  Atmosphere: A. Very cozy, intimate atmosphere.  Great for date night"}
{"text":"Good service fine food no complaints went there opening day been a regular since then. Bang shrimp is delicious tobia is rich and tasty. Service is impeccable"}
{"text":"I think I am a huge fan of bottomless mimoas... No. I DEFINITELY am. Especially when they're TEN DOLLARS AND you can switch from a mimosa to a bellini or a sangria... Decided to switch it up and BRUNCH for this birthday this year. I made a reservation for about twenty, requesting the long tables in the bar.  GREAT SUCCESS! We had two servers to handle our crowd and basically brunched from open til they stopped pouring!  Okay so I was looking at the menu and didn't see many vegan friendly items on the menu and i was gonna be draaaaankin' so i definitely had to find SOMETHING. I already knew I could have the house salad, hold the cheese but I needed something MORE.  I did ask our server what, if any, were vegan friendly items on the menu. He really didn't give me an answer and I was super annoyed by it but i glanced over the menu some more and they have several side items you could order and probably be vegan but honestly I ended up just ordering the small salad and some french fries and ate some edamame and then just kept drankin'!   Our two servers kept me and my peeps full of alcohol and food so by the time brunch was over I was a happy camper."}
{"text":"Food is great, except one with soft taco shrimp. The soft taco is too dry, not soft, not warm, it break easily. We ask for new one, it never come. Overall it good, included service."}
{"text":"Our first visit to Bonefish Grill for my birthday. Our waitress was Danielle. The food was excellent, and Danielle was really sweet and totally on top of things - she knew what we needed before we had to ask for it. I had the shrimp/scallops, my husband had the filet mignon. Both were absolutely delicious and expertly prepared. The prices are really fantastic, given the quality of the food and the service. There was plenty of parking, and you can get reservations online (so there's no waiting when you get there). Their happy hour drink deals are available in the dining room, and are really good. Overall, this place is highly recommended, and we will be back again (hopefully, we'll be in Danielle's section again!)"}
{"text":"Went back to Bonefish a second time. And was very disappointed . Had tempura type fish which was over breaded. Shrimp appetizer was good but at $11 was way over priced Best seafood for me is chowder bar at Suncoast Resort in Summerlin area. Forget Bonefish Grill for me in future Hope they make it as ambiance is nice"}
{"text":"This place was good. Sunday its packed to the wall with tourist sometimes. It was a nice casual place."}
{"text":"I took my mother here on mother's day and she loved the food. They had a special with the  bang bang shrimp which you Must order because it's so good, along with 2 entrees and a dessert. Our waiter was very slow, like very. The entrees were pretty good, not amazing but the strawberry shortcake was amazing! My loved her fish so as long as she was happy! If I came back it would only be for a wild orchid cocktail along with bang bang shrimp and strawberry shortcake. I'll probably order at the bar for faster service."}
{"text":"Ordered the bang bang shrimp appetizer and the fish and chips for lunch. Delicious. Ronda was our server and was great."}
{"text":"I got to try out Bonefish Grill recently in Vegas because of a gift certificate.  It was my first time ever to visit Bonefish Grill and learned that everything they grill is on a Oak wood grill. Overall the menu is pretty healthy. For most of the entrees you choose your protein and two sides.  I chose to get Lily's Chicken which comes with grilled chicken topped with goat cheese, spinach, artichoke hearts and lemon basil sauce. For my sides, I got mashed potatoes and spinach.  Overall the meal was ok. The addition of the goat cheese gave a unique flavoring to the chicken as well as the addition of the artichoke hearts. I couldn't really taste the lemon basil sauce. It really was healthy meal with decent portions.  Atmosphere wise this restaurant had dim lighting, was quiet and intimate. It was didn't have a Vegas like feel at all which I found to be nice. It was a good place for a small dinner and conversation."}
{"text":"Wait time was good drinks amazing. Ordered the Ahi tuna / not he best but good, sautéed spinach was amazing as well as the garlic mashed potatoes. Good atmosphere and friendly staff. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"We go here for brunch and love it. The menu is a little limited but the offerings are fantastic. The bottomless bubbles are a must."}
{"text":"We were delighted to find an elegant, pallet pleasing restaurant. The food was well thought out,  had a beautiful presentation, and was accompanied by a wait staff that was perfectly on point. I whole heartedly recommend the Bonefish restaurant at Town Center."}
{"text":"My rating would be 4 from previous visits but our last visit was terrible. My husband and I have been to this location 3 times and each time we've had great service and food. This time the food was meh, steak and crab cake. We ordered our steak medium and got well done. It took a while for food to come out so we just ate it. My biggest complaint is the floors were slippery and our daughter fell. We told the waitress who was serving people next to us. She called the hostess to help clean it. Hostess grabs a table napkin and wiped the floor down using her foot. The other hostess grabbed mop. Still sticky. Meanwhile, a manager was loudly talking to people next to us saying she lives in summerlin and she's opened several bone fish in Cal and nv. Male manager comes by and sees the mop and waitress told him it was slippery. He smiled at us and walked away. As were leaving we told the male manager that our daughter has fallen twice and he smiled and said he knows it's slippery. I don't know if management has changed but we won't be returning."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to having dinner here for the first time. I was not impressed, the food was overpriced for the quality of food we received and definitely not up to par with other restaurants in town. We started with the ceviche and it was very underwhelming. The shrimp was over cooked, the scallops were terribly dry and the fish was not appetizing. My friend and I split the sea bass with mango salsa and the tilapia tacos. The Sea bass was over cooked and the four cheese scalloped potatoes were dry and not impressive. The tacos were okay. I will not be back."}
{"text":"It was just a Bonefish  Grill Kinda night. My daughter and I went and had a fabulous dinner. Photo to follow of lobster stuffed shrimp with sautéed spinach. That was my dinner. Megan was our server, she was excellent. Everything was delicious as always, this is my \"go to\" restaurant."}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch my last trip to Vegas. I was very impressed and I would definitely recommend it. Had the trout with lemon butter, green beans, and potatoes. Added the house salad which was pretty tasty also. After tax and tip cost was $30. Kinda expensive lunch but worth it in my opinion."}
{"text":"Stopped by last night a little after 8 to meet a friend. Greeted at door by nice hostess, choose to sit at bar. Only 5 other people sitting in area. Sat down at bar, bartender said hi. Waited a few minutes as he was doing things asked for a cocktail and then a water. The bartender did not ask or make any small talk with me till my friend got there about 5 minutes later. Got her a drink then continued to do what he was doing. Not sure what he was doing but my friend grabbed her own menu and then ordered an appetizer. He took order never asked anything else not even if we wanted anything else. No small talk, no do you need anything else  basically nothing. He was absolutely the worst bartender. Felt ignored and even worse like we were bothering him. Overall experience bad will not be back. Poor guest service and management."}
{"text":"This is my third or fourth time at this Bonefish, part of the Outback chain. Had a reservation on a Tuesday for 7pm, and arrived slightly early, and they seated me immediately while I was waiting for my dinner mate.  Since I'm trying to watch the carbs, thought this was a good place to pick, though I've never been bowled over by their food before. Our waiter was a bit over the top, not necessarily intrusive, more like too much \"bro-talk.\" What's up with waiters that think two gentlemen eating alone (myself and my son) need to approached with macho affirmations? The service was fine, if not a little annoying.  They started us out with a loaf of fresh-baked bread and butter, which my son tells me was quite good. We passed on their practically-shoved-down-your-throat Bang Bang Shrimp, and we started with the Ceviche, which was brought out simultaneously with my side caesar salad. The app consisted of pre-cooked shrimp and minced bay scallops in juice with \"fish (?), fresh pineapple, coconut, cilantro and guacamole.\" Truthfully don't remember the guac (it may have been there).  Pre-cooking the fish defeats the dish's purpose - it's supposed to be only slightly cooked, not tougher than it should be from cooking twice. It came with large tortilla-like chips. I ordered the rainbow trout, and though they tout several \"complimentary sauces,\" I decided since they hype that their \"market-fresh fish are cooked to perfection over a wood-burning grill,\" I went sans sauce, to be supposedly accompanied by a \"fresh-grilled lemon.\" Maybe the citrus fell off the plate on the way to the table. I chose spinach and broccoli for my sides - going for the green I guess. My son ordered the Spicy Tuna Bowl.  The trout was not flaky at all, more like a nondescript, flavorless, mushy mess. The attached fins and skin DID alert me to what gave its life for me to eat only a third. The veggies were a bit overcooked, but acceptable. And my son said the Tuna Bowl was good, and the seared ahi was cooked properly.  All in all, the atmosphere is nice, and the service is adequate. I would give this maybe a half star over Red Lobster. I can't speak to their red meat entrees, but they have a wider selection of fresh fish and associated higher prices. But most likely won't go back on my own."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Monday night and had a lovely time! We were seated promptly and our server was very friendly and attentive. We started with the bang bang shrimp which was fantastic, as always. The free bread with the pesto olive oil dipping sauce is also on point! For our entrees, my boyfriend got his usual tilapia imperial, and I decided to try the soft shell crab that was on special. My boyfriend always loves the tilapia, so he was happy, but one of the surprises he got was  in the sides- he ordered a side of spinach, which was huge!! Definitely a great value! My crab was tasty and had good quality large pieces of crab meat in it, but it was a little too rich for my taste. Otherwise, it was great! Also, would definitely recommend the garlic whipped potatoes as a side as well. Overall, there's a reason we keep on coming back to bonefish- you get a pretty good value for your money and some tasty food!"}
{"text":"Yummy corn chowder soup, yummy cerviche,  yummy crab cakes, yummy lamb chops...sooooooo tender!!! We went during the lunch hour and really enjoyed our meal"}
{"text":"While our waiter was very pleasant and professional, the food we had was perfectly insipid. In general, if I am going to spend $50 on lunch, I would expect to find that my fish and chips were made with cod or haddock. Instead, I was given mealy tilapia.  My co-diner had the \"bang bang\" shrimp tacos, and we kept looking for the \"bang\", in the 3 or 4 30-35 lb/count shrimp found in the taco. Now, do not get me wrong. The food was not disgusting; it was simply disinteresting. I would expect to pay the same amount, on the east coast, for a quality seafood product at Legal Seafoods.   On the positive side, they served their food with very good bread, and our mediocre fish was served with very fine french fries."}
{"text":"My husband and I rarely get to go out to dinner bc it isn't in our budget. We went to Bonefish Grill last night, and I have to say that it was the best food we've ever eaten!!! The service was amazing as well!! I'm so glad we decided to eat here instead of our original choice! Keep up the good work!!!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to bonefish for years, visited my first bonefish back in FL, and have always enjoyed the food and atmosphere. Just recently moved to Vegas and thought to give this one a try. Shelly was our server and I have to say, by far the worst service I've ever received. She was very short and rude with us and seemed to be in a rush, but when I noticed her giving her other tables a lot more attention (primarily white people) I knew she was assuming I wasn't a good tipper or was profiling me because I'm a black women. She barely came by to check on us and was very very short with us. Will never be back. Food was okay, but service left a bad taste in my mouth. I still tipped 20% just to show her not to profile next time."}
{"text":"Amazing! Went there with some friends, tried several appetizers and entrees including bang bang shrimp, kobe burger, swordfish, sea bass, and they had seasonal pumpkin raviolis!   Excellent tasting food, service was very nice and friendly and made good recommendations.  Sunday afternoon, not too busy or crowded, no wait.  Not very expensive, ranges from $8-$30 depending on what you order."}
{"text":"The food is pretty decent here, but I'm come in for the amazing employees. They are all so amazing. Everyone is is always in such a good mood, they really make it feel like home."}
{"text":"Bonefish Grill didn't excite me too much. Upon entry, we were not greeted with a warm welcome. We were simply asked, \"2?\"... Great first impression. (PS there were about 5 hostesses at the front lobby)  Food was decent. Ceviche had iceberg lettuce in it that was chopped like a house salad. Small portion. I guess the ice bowl was cool.   I got the Wild Mahi Mahi. It was very good. I opted out of sauce and went with the grilled lemon instead.   Blackened Fish Tacos were also okay.   Our server seemed drained and walked / talked like a zombie. She hurried us out by asking about a desert menu prior to us finishing our main dishes and brought us the check faster than she refilled our waters. We had plates that needed to be picked up on the table during dinner that she ignored until we personally stacked and placed the dirty plates on the edge of the table.   At least act like you're enjoying your job. No small talk. Nothing more than the bare minimum. Thus should be a 2 star review but the Mahi Mahi was good.   I'm not sure if I'll return. Maybe I'll try happy hour?"}
{"text":"Medium size menu executed well. I was actually not a fan of the 2 Cabernet wines that were suggested by the bar tender, but that is just a personal preference. The salad was fresh and well seasoned, the grilled swordfish with sides with simple, but we'll executed.  Truffle Mac n cheese....can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Very pleasant experience at Bonefish Grill. Salmon was cooked perfectly and the Mac n' cheese was excellent. Service was great and we were seated immediately. Will go back."}
{"text":"Okay, let's get this out is the way:  even a with a reservation, you likely have to wait for a table. This is not how reservations work at a decent restaurant.  This is poor.   Okay, so the food is pretty good. I've had various grilled fish, fried fish, and salads. I like the wedge salad.   Service is as I expect. It's good but not overwhelmingly so. It fits the price-point of this restaurant.   The setting here is getting a little dated, looking a little 1990s, but not too bad. Don't look too closely at the decorative, copper plants along the dividing wall between the dining room and bar, though (it's covered in dust)."}
{"text":"Came for a quick happy hour bite.  The cod sliders are our go to on happy hour.  Also ordered the bang bang shrimp.  Today the shrimp were over sauced so not my favorite but have been good in the past.  The sliders are a good value $6 for two.  Busy for a Tuesday. If you are looking for fish place that's not overly expensive then Bonefish maybe worth a try."}
{"text":"6pm on a Thursday night and we are seated and it takes over ten minutes until anyone even looks at us.  Some busboy finally asks if anyone has helped us...and offered to get some water and iced tea.  So...not off to the best start.  When a waiter finally comes to talk to us we tell him we are ready to order...then he starts in explaining everything we don't care about and don't want or need to hear.  Then he apologizes saying they were having a shift change...really?!  Right in the middle of dinner rush hour...whatever.  So we order the Bang Bang Shrimp appetizer, fish tacos, Salmon and a Caesar salad.  The appetizer shows up very quickly...and was pretty good...breaded deep fried shrimp in some type of good sauce.  About ten minutes pass and...the main courses arrive.  I casually mention that my salad never came and to please make sure I'm not charged for it.  Still not improving.  The tacos were good and served hot.  The Salmon was okay and served hot.  Frankly for a fresh fish house I was really expecting the salmon to be better than...say...any random cafe.  It was not.  It was on the lower side of average...kind of small and too dry.  The one saving grace for this place was that it was not too expensive.  We had a complimentary card for the appetizer, so the bill with tip was exactly $50.  I can think of literally a dozen other places $50 gets two people a better experience and food.  Considering we eat every dinner out, we get around a lot.  I can assure you Bonefish is off the list.  Maybe I'll forget all of this in a year or three and try again then."}
{"text":"When I left this restaurant, after eating, my husband asked me how I'd rate it on YELP and I said GOIR STARS because it was delicious... Chicken moist and salmon seared/cooked to perfection and paired wonderfully with the extra avocado... But the reason why this review is missing a star is because I wish the Salmon portion was bigger and the service was pretty slow... What initially was supposed to be a quick bite turned into at least 45 minutes to an hour. Despite that though, I'm glad we ate at Bonefish Grill because I had always been curious!"}
{"text":"I thought this place was good for the money very affordable compared to the rest of vegas! Lobster tail for $14! Good sauce for mussels and they gave us so many."}
{"text":"Everything was great and on point! Delicious and fresh! Service like no other! Can't wait for the patio to open!"}
{"text":"Wife and I were excited to see this place open-we are seafood fans.  The thought of fish brought in fresh daily was very appealing, considering we live 400 miles from the nearest ocean. How wrong we were!  We had no reservation, but we were greeted promptly & courteously, and seated immediately. Nice ambiance! If the story ended here the place would be a winner.  Menus arrived promptly, and the  server immediately pointed us toward the alcohol menu. We weren't interested, and asked if there were any specials. The server explained the menu well. This place is nothing more than a restaurant with pictures on its menu. Blue cheese dressing on the salad was right out of the jar.  When the entrées came, they reminded me of the WWII army chow line-when the servers would slap the ice cream on top of the mashed potatoes. The food was piled into an inglorious heap, very unappetizing and very UNpresentable. Wife's mahi was totally overcooked and inedible . When we told the server, She was quick to apologize, and went to find a manager. After 5 minutes or so, she returned to say the manager was busy with something and couldn't come out, but offered us a free dessert. We looked at her as if she had a foot coming out of her head, while the very inedible mahi sat in front of my wife with the server looking at it as if she thought it might bite.  In addition to all that, there were intolerable waits to get our iced teas refilled. However, when the check came the mahi was deleted, and  we left. This place would do well to close up for 10 days, train the staff, hire a decent kitchen staff from head chef on down, provide proper portions, and learn how to present dishes in an appetizing way. If Bonefish Grill succeeds, it won't be on our dime!!!"}
{"text":"I will never bring my business to this Bonefish again!!!  Called for reservations for 8, they said they could only accommodate 6.  I'm like \"really 2 of them are toddlers, you can't accommodate 2 more?\"  They absolutely refused.  And our first visit to the Concord location the service was awful.  I  will be driving to the Huntersville location to dine at Bonefish from here out.   Way to make an AWFUL first impression on Concord, Bonefish."}
{"text":"A tad overpriced and the menu is SERIOUSLY lacking variety, but I can still recommend this place. Not super kid-friendly either but you should be able to find something that can satisfy the kids, but again LACKING MENU.  I also find the bar area and lounge seating right when you walk in to be tacky and too much real estate is devoted to couples/singles in this regard."}
{"text":"This place is SOOO good! This is definitely one of my new favorite seafood restaurants in town.   The restaurant itself is a little on the small side, but it's cute and definitely great for a date night or intimate conversation. The bar area has a TV and is pretty cozy. Service has been fairly consistent. We've had a couple servers that seemed like they were new and maybe having issues with explaining the menu properly but I can look past that when the food tastes as great as it does.   The food here is really phenomenal. Every time I've come here the fish always tastes incredibly fresh. You get free bread with pesto for dipping that is really fantastic and the bang bang shrimp is a must.   Great drinks, better food. Worth every penny."}
{"text":"Love the service.  Good bread.  Good fish choices.  Gift cards available for less at Costco.  Even offered is drinks while we waited - we were early."}
{"text":"sat at the communal tables in the bar tonight.. A quick couple of appetizers.  Bang Bang shrimp were soggy and half unbreaded. Had to ask for bread halfway through  . They were out of the wine I ordered that was on the specials menu. Weird. Salads were just okay. Chicken Caesar with chicken and the house salad with mushy hearts of palm at $11 a piece should have been better.. Server was just okay, but seemed annoyed to have to wait on us.. Sorry, but for $46 for two Waters, two appetizers and two salads it should have been better. This is why I usually avoid chains and will in the future."}
{"text":"Owned by the same company that owns Roy's and Flemmings (two of our favorite restaurants), we decided to try it out.  The bang bang shrimp appetizer was highly recommended and good, but I didn't think it lived up to the hype.  I had the Tilapia Imperial and the wife had the sea bass with mango salsa.  Both were good, but the Tilapia was the best.  The au gratin potatoes were good, and the spaghetti squash that came with it was surpringly really good.  Oh yeah - watch out for the pre-meal bread - it's like crack!  We couldn't stop eating it.  Prices weren't too crazy (we had 2 mixed drinks and got out the door under $100), and our meal was great.  Definitely more on the menu I'd like to try."}
{"text":"After reading the other reviews I feel I should give this place another try.  My experience and food review will be a bit different.  My husband ordered the fish tacos, for $13.90 you get 3 small (won ton wrapped) tacos and house made chips.  Not great and not much food.  Almost appetizer sized.  My mother ordered the Thai coconut shrimp appetizer and it was huge for $10.90.  I had one and really liked it.  She ordered garlic whipped potatoes and they had large lumps in them.  Barely smashed and she doesn't like them that way.  To my dish, I had Lily's Chicken, $14.90, and I cannot recommend it at all.  It's a small piece of breast meat that is cut wrong so it comes apart as stringy bits not nice cuts.  It's grilled, I think, but all around the edge all you taste is a burned taste. By the time you cut it off there is just not much left.  It's thin and overcooked so quite dry.  There is goat cheese on it but it's way too much for the size of the piece of the chicken.  It says it comes with seasonal vegetable but it is couscous not vegetables.  When I asked for the grilled broccolini the waitress said they didn't have any. Good review:  great bread and olive oil dipping sauce.  If you come early the house wine is $3.25.  (Our waitress was not sure if they had house Cabernet)  They did and it was good for a house wine.  A pet peeve for me,(I grew up in the restaurant business),  I can't believe that you can walk into an almost empty restaurant tell the hostess there are three of you and then wait while she stares at the computer screen waiting for it to tell her where to seat you.  She should know where the next party should be seated before they are in the door.  They also should give you a few minutes after you are seated and get your drinks.  Our waitress came to our table 7 times (in a 5 minute period after being seated) to see if we were ready to order.  I don't know if it's excellent service or just annoying.  We were eating at 5pm the restaurant only had a few parties eating.  I think it might be a good place to come for happy hour drinks and appetizers.  The bar area is huge and does a great business.  I hope it does well.  It just seemed pricey for the food we had."}
{"text":"Will be coming again!!! From start to end the food had good flavor and crunch. The waitress had a smile the whole time and since it was our first time she gave us the run down of her favorite picks. I went with her top picks and loved both of them."}
{"text":"Last night I went to celebrate my husband's 70th birthday at this wonderful Bonefish Grille. The experience for such an important occasion did not let me down. The service was so good I tipped so well even the waitress was surprised and I loved seeing her smile.  The stuffed shrimp with lobster for an appetizers was something really special. The Caesar's salad was perfectly chilled with just just the perfect amount of dressing. The Chilean Sea Bass was outrageous and the Creme Brûlée was plentiful and delicious.  I am never one to give 5 Star reviews except to exception restaurants in my hometown Manhattan but I must give Bonefish Grille the exception."}
{"text":"Bang Bang Shrimp!!!! Seriously so amazing. Try the Bang Bang Shrimp Tacos.  This is a go to venue for lunch meetings."}
{"text":"Highly disappointing experience with food service staff and mediocre food: The Town Square restaurant was an awful experience compared to the newly opened Summerlin Location, which was terrific in every way!  My friends and I decided to celebrate one of our birthdays at the Town Square location. This place was a nightmare from the moment after we were seated.(In all fairness, the hostess was fabulous).  The waitress was aloof and impatient. When we got our dishes, I asked where my garlic mashed potatoes were, and her response was \"The kitchen made an error and put your mashed on her plate\" (pointing to my friend). Um, ok? Then she WALKED AWAY! She did not come back with a sided dish for me. That was her response. I was flabbergasted and disgusted. The food was mediocre and completely different than the wonderful food we experienced in the other location. The Chilean sea bass was dry, the filet mignon was tough,  The manager, Scott came by to ask how everything was and we told him what happened. He was the only good thing that happened in this restaurant. He was absolutely wonderful in turning a \"horrible service evening\" into a tolerable situation. Our waitress never came back expect to basically throw a birthday desert on the table and give us our check. She never offered desert, never apologized, and never came near the table again. I would never step foot in this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Great service and well thought out menu. It's a solid chain destination that offers fresh options for everyone. It's a true chain with its consistent portions and seasoning, and it's always a solid experience. Bar and dinner service are always quick and efficient. Make reservations."}
{"text":"I looked forward to visiting this place due to recommendations from friends who are discerning.  Let it be said in advance:   I have high standards for food quality, preparation, and service.  Value counts too, but is not my first consideration.  I was very disappointed.  Went today for lunch with 5 friends, folks who get together quite often for lunches around town and the area.  Our very blond 20-something wait person (Kelsey) was mostly concerned with how cute she is.  Not one word that she ever uttered seemed in the least sincere.  Fakey,  cheery and squeaky voice.  Drastic overuse of a number of phrases such as \"you got it!\" and various usages of the verb \"to work\".  She seemed a little impatient with the fact that there were six of us and we took some time getting ourselves organized and making decisions.  (We range in age from 62 to 83).  The place was not really very crowded, but she seemed to want to hurry us.  During the lunch service, she never noticed totally empty water glasses.  We had to ask several times for refills.   The final blow, for me, was that she gave us all our (some separate) checks long before we were finished eating.  Several of the folks in our group dutifully whipped out their credit cards and put the folders out for her, despite the fact that we were all sitting and eating and chatting (again, the restaurant was really clearing out due to lunch being almost over).  I was sharing a dessert with a friend next to me when she appeared, picked up the finished folders with bills and cards and then asked me \"Are you finished working on your check?\".  I said, \"No.   In fact, I have not even STARTED to work on my check.  In fact, I didn't come here to WORK!  In fact, I didn't think I needed to 'work' on my check until after I finished eating!\"    She backed off.  (I will give her extra credit for NOT using the much over-used word \"Awesome\" during the time I was listening to her) OK, that's the service.  The food?  Crab cakes were very tasty and nicely prepared.  The french fries to accompany them tasted right out of a box in the freezer case at Woodman's.  I haven't had fries like that since the 50s.   Sixteen dollars for 2 small crab cakes and very inferior fries is, in my opinion, overpriced. The food others ordered looked pleasant but nothing that I could not make at home better and much more economically. As other reviewers have said, Madison has a plethora of wonderful restaurants.  I see no need to return to Bonefish Grill."}
{"text":"Another solid 3.5 to 4.0 star performance. Giving them the benefit of rounding up here. But overall, this is an excellent chain with good quality food and usually wonderful service.  Took my friend for her 50th Birthday, so it was a special occasion. I mentioned that in the reservation, and they denoted that when seating us with a \"Happy Birthday!\" Very nice gesture.  Had to start with the Bang Bang Shrimp, which I call \"Shrimp Crack!\" This stuff IS addictive! Be forewarned....it's easy to eat the copious amounts they give you, and if you're not a big eater this dish alone can fill you up!  I also ordered the Corn Chowder with Lump Crab Meat. My GOD was this delicious! Best dish of the night for me. Very creamy, RICH and full of fresh crab and chunks of corn. Highly recommended!  We both got the \"Surf and Turn\" even though it is NOT explicitly on the menu. You have to order the steak of your choice (in our case Filet Mignon) and add a side of Surf (in our case Lobster tail). Not a hugh portion but still yummy for a giant sea cockroach! LOL....Steak was prepared the way I asked for it, and it was decent quality. Not the best Surf and Turf I've ever had but it was delicious nonetheless for a competitive price. Gotta love the butter dip they bring for the Lobster. I should have ordered 2 doses of Lipator with that!  They do have a nice wine list, and I ordered 2 glasses of Sparkling Wine to celebrate my friend's birthday.  The waitstaff is very nice, but our guy was a little inexperienced so I'll give him a \"mulligan\" for bringing our food to the next table, not bringing a cold bath for my wine, and being a little scatter brained. But he WAS very nice and tried hard.   All in all a VERY good dinner and she loved and appreciated this experience.  TIP: I brought my own bottle of Pouilly Fuisse for only a $10 corkage fee! This is VERY reasonable and a relatively inexpensive option for those of us who are real oenophiles!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my visit here at Bonefish Grill. This restaurant just opened couple of weeks ago.   Staff is friendly and Hostess sat us comfortably in a table for 4. Had more leg room and space. Waiter did an excellent job answering our question of what was on the menu.   Hot bread plate with Olive oil and basil dipping sauce was the first to come out.  The list of Martinis were extensive. Went for the Bonefish Pomegrante Martini which was sweet and refreshing.  After a long day, wanted to unwind and have a relaxing dinner. We took our time with placing our order. Started with salad first. Waiter wanted to get whole order placed. Did not want to be rushed. He was so acommodating and told us to relax.  Cesear Salad was fresh and crisp.   The Filet Mignon came out perfect just to my liking. I usually order Medium Well and it came out nicely cooked and juicy too.   Ordered French Fries and the spinach (Not greasy nor oily).   The Classic Cheesecake was not to my liking. It was creamy but it had an after taste.  Instead I went for my friends Macadamia Nut Brownie with Ice Cream- This is definitely a winner!  The Cappuccinos were good.  The key here is to come early.  Will be back here again."}
{"text":"We had a dinner get together with several colleagues from work. This is a busy area in Huntersville, since we are located all the way Uptown give your self ample time driving up North on I77 which traffic can be horrendous trying to make a 6:15 PM reservation. We left like 4:30 PM and made it at 6 PM.   We headed toward the bar and got some drinks. It took a while get a bartender for we only saw one working and then another popped up and took our orders.Got the White White Cosmo which was nice and sweet. The restaurant prefers you to cash out at the bar before heading to the table.  We were seated right next to the bathroom which I'm not so crazy about with people coming in and out of the both bathroom. Don't you just hate that. Place was busy and guess those were the only seats they have for a party of 6.  Times have really changed. They do not bring a round of waters to the table nor automatically with bread. You have to ask for them. I asked for water 3 times. One waiter and two other servers bring food. They do not tell you what the specials are or what is the chef selection for the evening. Imagine if this was your first visit? This is definitely, not fine dining and it is like a step above Outback Steakhouse.  Had Rib Eye steak which had a lot of fat on it. The string bean was very buttery and fries were okay. Nothing to rave about. The Waygu Beef Potstickers was like your basic beef dumpling. My colleagues raved about the Tuna, and seafood. They just loved the Bang Bang Shrimp and order one to go."}
{"text":"Drove from L.A. and stopped at Bonefish Grill for lunch with my 7 year old. Had the Chilean Sea Bass and my daughter had the Fish Strips. Good food and great service.  Server was very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Awesome ambience, and out waitress (Denise) was amazing. So attentive & sweet  Will come back next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"My friend has been having treatment for cancer. Several friends and myself made reservations here to celebrate her  treatments coming to an end as well as her birthday. She actually made the reservation for 6 and totally forgot to count herself. We got there and they said we only have a booth for 6. We asked if perhaps 2 people could sit together somewhere else and were told no- we either cram into the booth or the wait for a 2 top was 80 minutes. There were 2 extra rooms with tables that were set and not being used.The hostess(on advice from the maitre d') said it was only for special occasions. After suffering through a crammed table of appetizers and my back hurting from being twisted on the end, I gave up and took my meal to go so the others could enjoy theirs. I heard a lot about the bang bang shrimp- it was ok but nothing special. The entrees were small and expensive. The waitress left after only getting 1 appetizer order for 7 people without checking if anyone else wanted to order. We placed 3 additional appetizer orders which all came much later than the first. Needless to say, after the poor attention we received from the front of the house- I will not go back. I work in a service industry and don't think I would recommend it to my clients. I am eating my entree out of my styrofoam take out now. Unfortunate- it tastes pretty good, but I know I'll still be hungry after."}
{"text":"This was the first time I had been to Bonefish Grill and I absolutely loved it. The service was great, the hostess was kind. We were sat and our server, Brice, was so helpful. He explained the whole menu to us and answered any question we had. Our food came out fast once we had ordered. We had Bang Bang Shrimp as an appetizer, it was SO GOOD. I had Filet Mignon, it was cooked perfectly. My boyfriend had fish tacos and he loved them as well. We will be returning to Bonefish and specifically his location. Loved it"}
{"text":"The service is fantastic.  The waiters and the servers work as a team helping each other. We had the chowder, house salads and the oysters Rockefeller   Next time I will tell them to leave the bacon off the oysters but otherwise they were perfect."}
{"text":"Service was slow.  Party of 3.  Two of three meals were deliver to table, only one was correct.  Third meal came out about 20 min. later.  Timing was way off.  Sorry, I will not visit this location again."}
{"text":"We went there a couple of days ago for dinner. The place was fairly busy but we got a nice table soon enough.  The ambience and the food presentation was great, however, the service was not good at all. They also took a really long time to prepare our food and then brought out the appetizers and entrees together!! The food tasted alright, however, was not worth the wait."}
{"text":"This location isn't my favorite! I came here for my birthday right when they opened and the customer service was really dry! The guy that was our waiter just didn't seem like he wanted to be there. I'm only giving 3 stars because the food was good...just good! Nothing special and far from spectacular. Hopefully they'll get it together and smile more!"}
{"text":"Ate the lobster grilled cheese sandwhich with bisque last night... Tasted really good but today I have been sick all day :( I can't for sure blame bonefish but I do believe it was that sandwhich. I am never eating here again."}
{"text":"I went to this this place for a lunch. I had grilled trout with broccoli since they couldn't substitute French fries with anything else. Few hours later at home I felt so sick that I will not go back there again. I had horrible fish poisoning. I am not allergic to any food. Service was very mediocre. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Loved bg when I could eat the bang bang shrimp. So good. You can make a meal off of just that dish. I usually get the shrimp and scallop in lemon butter sauce. It's very good and very light. I don't know if they still offer the beef teriyaki bowl, that was tasty as well. The lobster tacos were good. The corn chowder was delicious. The Lily's chicken was ok. The cheese wasn't melted enough for me and added a tartness to the dish. I tried the potstickers which were good but cold when they brought it out. The pad Thai dish was a disappointment. It had a terrible flavor, like they went a little overboard on the sauce. Service was excellent. I think it's the blue Hawaiian martini? Can't remember the name but it is so good. If you like sweet cocktails this is one to try."}
{"text":"My Boyfriend and I have gone here a few times now and we Absolutely LOVE it! The Service is Great, the ambiance and food are wonderful. We had the Bang Bang Shrimp, the Grilled Trout, Fish & Chips...and the Key Lime Pie is the best Around!"}
{"text":"Good things: food was great--a bit over priced but very good. Drinks were reasonably priced. We enjoyed their Tuesday, 3-course special.  Bad things: Staff seemed very disorganized (we had multiple people ask for our drink orders and it took a while for us to be seated despite the restaurant being only about 50% full). The waiters were also extremely unprofessional. We sat outside and about half way through our meal, a group of waiters came out for their break. Would not have been a big deal had they not been asking each other for weed, giving back rubs and making sexual jokes. No regard for the little boy at the other table who was also within ear shot. Our waitress was very nice but didn't seem to know the menu and not particularly attentive.   All of these would not be so surprising if it weren't a nicer restaurant. For their prices, we expected more professionalism."}
{"text":"This was my first trip to the Bonefish Grill. I had heard horrible stories of long wait times, but at 8 on a Friday night the wait was just about 15 minutes. Comparable, if not less, than other comparable places.   Three words: bang bang shrimp. The appetizer alone is reason enough to stop by. Close to a dozen fresh shrimp (grilled maybe?) then rolled in heavenly crunchy goodness that is somewhat like a breading, but crispy, and better. Then the sauce- a creamy spicy sauce that hits the spot. I measure all appetizers against the crispy fried alligator at Nola on the Square- this rivals, if not surpasses, that (very similar in sauce).  I had the fish tacos.  I order fish tacos everywhere and I was a bit hesitant because it describes it as Cajun seasoned, which I don't tend to like.  If Cajun is what you want, that isn't what you will get. I was pleased. It is topped with a mango salsa that is pretty great. I highly recommend the fish tacos. I was disappointed in my side- I chose the spring greens. It was a pile of lettuce drowned in balsamic. I should have gone with the chips, but tried to go healthy. Just a little overdressed and plain.  I mixed it with a Thai iced tea- amazing. I could become addicted to the creamy, sweet, yet slightly spicy concoction.   My companion ordered a shrimp pasta diablo dish. Sweet at first, the heat eventually hits you. I recommend it.   The reviews talking about slow service are well warranted. 15 min to take our beverage order seemed a bit much. However, the attentiveness improved as the meal progressed (and the restaurant cleared out).  We will be going back, the fish selection looks pretty great and so does the dessert menu."}
{"text":"Bang bang shrimp are a must!  Had the crab cake meal, it was outstanding, one of the best I've had in town. Service was great and our waitress was very attentive. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I'll  admit.  My last visit to Bonefish was at the Independence location.   I was so looking forward to my usual scrumptious dining experience.   Maybe Bonefish changed their suppliers ????  Bang Bang Shrimp - lacking the usual kick.   I tasted mustard. I don't like mustard.   If it's a typical ingredient in the recipe,  it was over powering.  Yuk.  Lobster tail - First bite tasted murky.   Sad to say I enjoy the lobster at Longhorn just a little bit more.   Augratin potatoes - Institutional powdered tasting.   Where's the cheese?  Reminded me of the cheap stuff in the box.  Green beans - super al dente.   I think they just dipped them in hot water.   Waitress came by too late in the meal to rectify the situation  Good bye,  Bonefish."}
{"text":"Wanted to go someplace special with my beloved wife to commemorate our Silver Anniversary and, lo and behold,  the luck of the gods was definitely on our side. Bonefish was very chic, yet understated in its' décor, and the interior design(s) perfectly augmented the dynamism of the place. My pineapple martini was smooth, delicious and did not overwhelm my palate for the delicacies to come. There was an exciting synchronicity among the waitstafff, servers and management personnel that added to the totality of our experience, They did a bang, bang job on the crispy and delicious Bang Bag Shrimp, while the lobster tails were bursting with robust freshness. We spent less than $30 roundtrip for a Badger Cab taxi from the heart of the UW campus to the west side location. Doesn't get any better than this."}
{"text":"I've been to Bonefish a number of times, but never took the time to post a review.  I've been to a number of locations in other cities, as well and never left disappointed.  This time, I visited on a busy Friday evening after having received a $10 off coupon via email (always a plus!).  I had a made a reservation thru the website, so I had no wait upon arrival.  I ordered a glass of the pineapple wine (which was very good and a deal at $6).  I placed my entree order and was presented with a fresh sliced ciabatta roll and seasoned olive oil for dipping (yum!).  I has also ordered the house salad which I have always enjoyed, heart of palm, spring mix greens, sunflower seeds.  My entree arrived a short time later, grilled shrimp & scallops (a little bit overdone, but still ok), with sides of green beans and crab fried rice.   This is the first time that I had the rice and OMG, it was delicious. I've always enjoyed the key lime pie at Bonefish, so I ordered a slice to take home.  The meal was great, especially with the $10 off coupon.  I could hardly wait to get home to enjoy my dessert.   Well, the dessert was not nearly as good as my meal.  I was very disappointed, especially because I've had it many times before.  The portion was small, and there as not the usual tangy lime taste.  The filling was a bit waxy and flavorless.  The crust was soggy and the entire dessert was completely covered (as if to disguise the small portion) in an unappetizing, off-tasting whipped cream substitute.  I felt as though, I got the last piece that had been forgotten about, in the back of the fridge.  If I had been served the same while in the restaurant, I would have definitely sent it back to the kitchen. I will definitely return to Bonefish, but would think twice about dessert."}
{"text":"Loved it! One of the girls at work experienced their happy hour a few weeks ago, so we decided to try it out. We got there a bit before 5 and were seated immediately. The staff were very friendly, however, they did not explain their happy hour specials very well. I asked if the table notice were all of their specials, and looked around the menu for what it entails with no luck. So we ordered the bang bang tacos and the ceviche. A-Maz-Ing!  Still hungry, we decided to order more and some drinks. I caved and got one of the specialty drinks because it did not appear that a glass of wine was part of the happy hour special. After we ordered (the bang bang shrimp, yum!) we found out that there were more options for happy hour--including a $3 glass of wine!  The food was great! The specialty drink, the blood orange one, was meh.  And more clarification would be appreciated!"}
{"text":"I like this restaurant. Fresh seafood entrees that don't break the bank.  Boyfriend and I always order the Bang Bang Shrimp. One of their popular favorite appetizers. Crispy shrimp tossed in a spicy aioli sauce.  For entrees, I usually switch between salmon or Chilean seabass. The outside is seared and the inside got a smooth, buttery and tender. I made sure to specify that I want it well done. Completely cook the sh&t outta it!!!!! I know some restaurants serve their seafood medium. So make sure to specify if you have any special requests. You get to choose two sides; I picked steamed broccoli and potatoes au gratin. Yum!!!! Portions were just right. (Didn't have any leftovers, perfect 4 oz. portion. You can choose between 4 or 6 oz seabass. It was either 4 and 6 or 6 and 8). Boyfriend chose his entrée from the special menu for the night. He got soft shell crab and really enjoyed it. He got the garlic mashed potatoes as one of his sides and man that was good!!!! Personally, I liked that better than my potatoes au gratin.  Overall, great ambiance, customer service was good and it wasn't an expensive bill. It's healthy....well...healthier than most restaurants and it never disappoints."}
{"text":"I made reservations here for 2 on NYE. I wasn't super impressed with the service upon arrival - we had reservations for 6:15 and walked in at about 6:12, the manager at the host stand seemed super annoyed and asked for my name, and told me that it would be a few minutes since we were early. He then seated us in the bar area which I thought was kind of strange. Luckily, our waiter was fantastic and got our drink orders in ASAP.   We got the Bang Bang Shrimp as an app and thoroughly enjoyed it. I ordered the salmon which was cooked perfect, and the sides I got with it were both great as well. I'd definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere, great service and great prices!  We will definitely be back!!  The Chilean Sea Bass was definitely a crowd favorite.  Our waiter Cameron was FANTASTIC, and took great care of our spirited party of nine!!"}
{"text":"Food and drinks were on point! I've never been to this location before but I must say, everything was great! From the bang bang shrimp to the last bite of my sea bass entree; every bite was delicious and full of flavor! I wanted my regular go to \"Hennessy\" drink but they didn't have it. I told the waitress to give me something good and she brought out a drink that had some old fashion in it...let's just say I had about 3 of them! Good stuff all around. Will come back for sure!p"}
{"text":"Service 5 stars. I do also hope it continues. Food was awesome! Great flavor. Yum! Can'twait to come back. Management is on the look out to please. Ambiance is right on point. This place should be doing awesome, if they keep up the good work! In review... Go check it out!"}
{"text":"The room is lovely and elegant at this Bonefish Grill.  Moreover, our wait staff were attentive and very warm and friendly.  And of course, most importantly, the food is always delicious! I had the fish tacos and usually get the seared sashimi .  The tacos were packed with outstanding cod and fresh chunks of mango.  Win."}
{"text":"So happy to see they did not go away for good! We use to eat at the location on Eastern and were disappointed when we saw that it closed.. j So we were very happy to see them back at Town Square.   Stopped in Friday night. They had a good crowd, fortunately it was only a 15 minute wait.   The décor and set up looked almost identical to the other, nice and comfortable   Once seated we were greeted immediately and our drink order was taken, we were told about the specials, all but the one we saw on Yelp.. So not sure if that's really a special. Because it wasn't shown as a check in special...  We started off with Bang Bang Shrimp! Always a winner. Crisp, fried shrimp tossed in a spicy remolaude sauce. Plenty for a table of four or more..   My husband ordered the fish tacos which he said they were good. .  I ordered the Crab Corn Chowder and Ceviche. The chowder was rich & creamy... with a few lumps of crab and corn. I would have liked it if it had more crab.   The ceviche was good. Nice and light. Lots of seafood, scallops, shrimp & fish..   Our waiter and wait staff were EXCELLENT!  The GM came to our table after our meal and asked about everything too.   Love great service and this place has it! Looking forward to my next meal!"}
{"text":"We had a 5:30 Reservation. Got there early and we were seated right away. The server was very personable and knowledgeable . I had the chilean Seabass. The food was excellent. Highly recommend coming to the Bonefish Grill."}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Service was ok. Food was comically bland and short on portions. Waste of money and time. First and last time there."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Pregnant hostess at the front is very rude - I asked if it was brunch today (Saturday) and she gave me an annoyed look, and sighed and said \"nope.\" If it wasn't for the bang bang shrimp tacos, I'd never come back to this establishment. All the servers here are just very blah - no smiles, no friendliness, no exuberance.   Sincerely, a tired registered nurse who has no time for people's ridiculous attitudes"}
{"text":"Tonight I was looking for just some plain old baked chicken.....I decided to use a coupon I received from an email and go have dinner. I'm always a single so there is no wait at the bar...lol. I ordered a Longboard Lager with a glass....and looked at the menu. Nothing is just plain here on the menu.....the food has a flair and is creative. I ordered a Chicken dish but do not know the name. It basically was grilled chicken with sautéed spinich/artichoke/ goat cheese on top. My side was potatoes au gratin which are always delicious here. Veggies where basic squash with spices and cheese. I'd have to say everything was great ....definitely not boring to the taste buds. Service was great but one waiter kept brining me everyone's food....lol....not sure why he thought a small skinny girl could eat that much."}
{"text":"We visited Bonefish Grill about a month ago. Prior to this, I hadn't been to a Bonefish Grill in maybe 7 or 8 years. This place knocked my socks off. I was very impressed. It was the best meal I had in a long time and probably the best creme brulee' I ever had. We choose to sit in the bar area, since this seating was first come, first serve. First they brought out fresh, warm bread. We ordered the ceviche' appetizer with chips, which was really good. For our entree, we ordered the dinner for two option. We choose the salmon, tuna, Chilean sea bass, and shrimp and scallops. They brought us four different sauces to compliment the dishes, as well. During our wait, one of the waitresses was passing around the calamari as a sample for people to try. Calamari is not my favorite dish, but this wasn't bad. They also gave my husband a sample of the bang-bang shrimp. It was delicious. We'll definitely order a full order of that next time. Our entree was excellent, we ordered mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli with it. It also came with salads. I believe the entree for two was 30 bucks for both of us, which I thought was an exceptional deal. I gobbled down the sea bass pretty quickly, while my husband went after the salmon, shrimp and scallops. We shared the tuna. We ordered the creme brulee' for dessert. It was excellent, as I mentioned earlier. I look forward to dining here again in the near future."}
{"text":"First trip to Bonefish Grill. As we normally try to do on a first visit, we started with lunch.  The restaurant is a chain so we really did not expect too much.  The interior is very nice and somewhat upscale. Darkwoods and white linens set the tone, making it feel very warm and subtle. You can tell it was thought out, if but by a corporate interior designer, and that the space is likely repeated dozens of times over across the nation. But that's OK because, while not unique, it works. The waitstaff is very attentive and knowledgeable about their menu.  We were pretty impressed with the variety and fairly modest cost of their lunch menu. They have a few nice drink specials, both alcoholic and nonalcoholic. We had one of each, although I do not remember what they were. But they were good.  I had the snapper special for lunch which, with fries, was approximately $15. My wife had the fish tacos which was approximately $10. My wife's entrée was ample.  But I left somewhat hungry,  which is not too surprising given that it was a small fish entrée.  Food was just okay snd plainly presented.  But the fish was not overcooked or overseasoned. Definite points for that. With drinks and tips, I think we spent almost $40.  Not too bad. All said and done, it was just an OK lunch. Nothing particularly special or memorable.  But here in Madison with all of the dining choices, I think $40 would've gotten us a better and larger lunch somewhere else. So I do not think I would return unless I needed a quiet and professional space for a business lunch. But this was a nice change and a nice place to spend a quiet lunch hour. Very nice for a business lunch.  Not too much fun or appropriate for family dining with younger children or those who are hungry and on a modest or less budget."}
{"text":"2/14/18  This was our second time coming here and I must say the food is amazing. Valentines Day landed on Ash Wednesday and I basically had to fast all day. Dinner was my first meal of the day.  The restaurant was packed. We had reservations for 7:30pm. There was still a wait and that's when I told my husband that this is the reason we don't go out on Vday. Anywho, we waited about 15 minutes and my husband got the text. The hostess seated us. Jon was our waiter, and quickly gave us water and soon some bread. I ordered a martini which tasted wonderful. We ordered some appetizers and quickly came out. We were so hungry he came with another bread.  Lol. Then our entree came and surprisingly ate it all.   I will definitely come back, and maybe for Happy Hour. Thank you Bonefish Grill and Jon for making our Valentines Dinner special. Probably be back for next year."}
{"text":"Service was really slow. Took 15 minutes to get our drink order and it wasn't busy at all, maybe 8 other people in the restaurant. The food was decent, but giving it a low rating because the service was awful."}
{"text":"Solid restaurant in a great location offering delicious appetizers and entrees.  It's always great to have food options when venturing around Town Square and I'd gladly recommend this establishment.  Upon arrival for lunch, my family was seated immediately and they provide slings for infant seats which was nice.  We ordered:  Bang Bang Shrimp - Crispy fried shrimp tossed in a creamy and very mildly spicy sauce.  5/5, would get it again.  There was enough shrimp for at least two people.  My wife, who dislikes spicy food, enjoyed it.  Cup of Lobster Bisque - Not the best, not the worst.  A nice chunk of cooked lobster makes the soup worth it.  No bread or crackers are provided unless you ask the server for it.  Tilapia Imperial - Nicely sized baked tilapia with stuffed shrimp, crab, and scallops, tossed in a lemon butter and caper sauce.   The fish was perfectly cooked.  The lemon butter and capers gave it a delicious flavor.  The entree came with two sides of which we had two types of potatoes, both good.    Spicy Tuna bowl-  My only slight disappointment.  \"Premium\" sushi grade, sesame-seared rare, on top of jasmine rice, a half avocado, along with a sweet chili sauce and passion fruit salsa.  Compare my photo with that of the company's.  The tuna I had was very dark in color, not very fresh tasting, and the chili sauce just seemed out of place.  I'll give them a pass here as maybe raw fish is not their specialty.  The small slices left more to be desired.  Chicken tender kid's meal- Doubt you can do this wrong.  Came with a small drink and a side of fries.    Our server was okay.   Not super fast but she was able to be flagged down when we needed her.  Sometimes she forgot our requests for things like extra spoons or napkins.  Also, I'm not a fan of having to ask for bread for it to be served.  I would suggest having the servers at least offer it.  Once we asked, a generous loaf of bread came out with olive oil and basil.   All in all, a good business worth checking out a second time if not just to try their various wood-grilled fish options.  Stay away from the raw stuff and do ask for bread.  Yelp 100 Challenge 2016 - 5/100"}
{"text":"We had a \"Date Night\" meal here on a Sunday Afternoon @ 4:00. Great timing! The restaurant was pleasantly \"full\"--no one seated near us but enough people to keep it interesting. We were seated at a pub table in the bar area--very cool! It was also Happy Hour, making a glass of wine .26 cents more than a soda! Hardly a decision to think about. Will be back during Happy Hour. We started off with the Lobster Flat Bread. So delicious!! I am a health nut & I do not feel like this appetizer contradicted my healthy diet. I did not eat the bread & oil, but my hubby loved it. I ordered the small portion of Chilean Sea Bass (my fave!!) & it was delicious. Shared with my hubby who got the Grilled Scallops & Shrimp. We were able to sample 2 sauces each. Pan-Asian Sauce was our favorite out of the four. Sides were great. We did not leave room for dessert--or I would have had a forkful of Key Lime Pie! So looking forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"Three words: Bang. Bang. Shrimp.   WOWZA I'm obsessed. Not only is it an appetizer option, but also in the tacos. Not going to lie, I got both. Upscale atmosphere for a chain restaurant, but not too upscale that you feel out of place. Fun drink specials and friendly staff."}
{"text":"I went here for their Sunday Brunch with my husband and our family. We were a decent sized group (of 16) and the service we experienced was phenomenal. Our servers Ashely and Rachel were fabulous and extremely attentive. When it was time to order, my husband and I opted for the Bottomless Mimosa Special (includes: bottomless mimosas and a choice of a brunch item; I highly recommend it). My husband ordered the eggs Benedict and I ordered the Wagyu burger (it was so good!). Our whole experience was great. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Bias: been to Bonefish Grill before but at a different location. Also, I just love seafood in general.  The atmosphere and the waiting staff were as friendly as I remembered. But while I do understand the appeal to maximize space of a restaurant and thus its profits, walking from my table to the bathroom was oddly difficult. My family and I (6 people total) were seated in the middle of the room at a table for 8. I found myself bumping into tables and chairs walking between tables to get to the bathroom. And that was when the restaurant was relatively empty and the chairs were pushed in. I couldn't imagine it busy and people were actually in them. Even the waitress was bumping into them when she was bringing out the food. That should mean something...  Besides the crowded factor, the food was good and portions were pretty reasonable per price."}
{"text":"Made reservations for 8:00. Service was excellent. Food was amazing. Had saucy shrimp for appetizer. Sea bass entree was flavorful and cooked to perfection. Great atmosphere! Loved it."}
{"text":"Just horrible... Ordered take out and they told us 20 minutes.. Took 45 minutes and we sat forever and the food all was finished at different times so now we have a half hot and half cold meal . Thanks a lot assholes!!!!"}
{"text":"Great service great food. Everything was good even when we didn't like a drink they replaced it right away. Very nice place to go eat and enjoy a great experience anytime of the day. Also had the Chilean sea Bass and it was great new experience. Kids loved and destroyed the brownie ice cream dessert which melted in your mouth and takes you to heaven briefly lol."}
{"text":"I want to group Olive garden, cheese cake factory and bonefish grille etc. into the same categories of resturants. Probably not very exciting due the standard menu, but you would expect reasonably good food and decent service. But based on my recent experience, I do not think I will go back any time soon. My review is based primarily on the quality of the food and one problem with the service.   I went to Bonefish Grille a couple years ago at another location and I remembered liking the Bang Bang shrimp, but not like my entree back then.   When I was here tonight, I was surprised to find the Bang Bang shrimp is $13 or something like that, quite a price jump from my memory. I ordered the sea bass with Asian sauce and it comes with seasonal vegetable and I can choose another side. I chose the couscous. It turns out to be a major disappointment. The fish recipe is not well designed in the first place and I think the execution is poor as well.   In my opinion, Chilean sea bass is very good fish. It taste good by itself and it is really hard to screw up. But somehow Bonefish made it happen. The only good thing is the fish is still tender and juicy (as I said the fish is very forgiving).   The first problem is the sauce is awful and it totally overpowers the delicate fish. The sauce is labeled as pan Asian sauce, but it tastes somewhat sweet with a tomato undertone. So it tastes like a cheap generic sweet and sour sauce. Diluted soy sauce or salt/pepper would probably be much better. When the food itself is good, the recipe should be simple to show-case the food material itself. There are also some shredded carrots on top of the fish. They are totally unnecessary and so out of place. Who on earth wants sweet and sour fish with carrots? Why on earth call it Asian sauce? I do not know any Asian cuisine cook delicate fish in sweet sour sauce with carrots.  The second problem is the outer surface of the fish steak is burnt. I understand the fish is probably seared in the pan first and then baked or grilled. But apparently the temperature of the pan is too high. The fish surface can be slightly crispy, golden brown, but not bitter and burnt. So I think it is not executed well.   Thirdly, the menu says the dish comes with a side of seasonal vegetable and it turns out to be Garbanzo beans. I would not consider them to be seasonal and when I think of vegetables, I generally do not think of Garbanzo beans either. It tastes ok. But if you would like fresh vegetables (i.e., broccoli, zucchini, asparagus etc.) like I do, please ask the waiter what the seasonal vegetable actually is. Make no assumptions.   Lastly, the bathroom is out of towel paper and there is no hand drying equipment either. I think it is a negligence of the management.   With all above being said, our waitress is attentive and friendly. The ambience is comfortable and trendy. If you are not very concerned with the food taste and would rather choose familiarity from the chains (i.e., the food and the ambiance), I think this may still be a good place."}
{"text":"to be fair it was a monday night, that said, here we go: -ordered three times to get an item they actually had in stock. -food took one hour to come out. -drinks consistently took 20-30 minutes due to it being \"martini monday\" even though very few people were in the restaurant. -food came out cold and one plate at a time.  complete let down.  everyone else had been before and said this was out of character, but i am not sure that i'll ever be back to find out."}
{"text":"My hubby and I went for the first time today. Food was awesome. I had the Blackened Baha Tacos with Caesar Salad, and my husband had the fish (Tilapia) sandwich. I enjoyed mine, but will be ordering the fish sandwich next time. I agree with the other reviews about the music being too loud, and about problems with the tablets to take/pay for orders. Although, Kudos to BFG to have their staff use tablets so that patron's credit cards never leave their site. (Unfortunately, a big concern today)    :-(    We highly recommend this restaurant! We'll definitely be going back!!!"}
{"text":"This was our first time dining here:  1.  Bang Bang Chicken was great  2.  Corn and Crab chowder was flavorful  3.  The Caesar salad was good until salmon was mixed in--it was quite oily and ruined the salad."}
{"text":"Chains are going to be chains. Obviously to comply with corporate requirements the dining room has way too many tables. You have your minimum 22\" between diners so be ready for some bumping and josteling during your meal unless you can score a booth.   The table tops are small (we had four on a four top) barely enough room for menus and the server made it worse by plunking down a pitcher of water and a plate of bread. We appreciated the bread and water but perhaps keep the pitchers off the table and serve as needed.  Two of our meals arrived, the men's, and our wives sat without meals while ours got cold as gentlemen would never eat before ladies. We finally flagged down our sales girl ( you want this can we add that all the required script delivered by rote without enthusiasm) she  did promptly find our wives tepid dishes in the kitchen. The fish was all very fresh and we'll seasoned. The sides were at best Luke warm and bland. My dining companions Mahi was 100% raw in the middle, but good enough his wife decided to take it home and finish cooking it. Three stars only for the quality of the food. Won't be back though."}

{"text":"What a great experience we had at Bonefish today. We came here for the Mother's Day brunch. Even though our reservations were at 2:15pm, they sat us early and even honored the brunch menu, which ended at 2pm. Our waiter was great. She was accommodating, attentive and friendly. The food was delicious. I had the surf and turf egg benedict, which I highly recommended. The bottomless brunch cocktails were also on point. Looking forward to eating here again.   To the staff at Bonefish, thank you for making our Mother's Day dinning experience awesome! You guys rock."}
{"text":"This was our 6th visit to the Bonefish Grill.  The 5 previous visits have a 5 star rating from us.  Not sure what happened this time, but we were very disappointed with many things this time.   1) We showed up on a Saturday without a reservation so we were expecting to have to wait and have some cocktails at the bar first.  We were told 20-25 mins. Not bad at all. The reality was that 55 minutes later we were finally seated.  UGH!!!  Hostess was very kind to offer us a free appetizer to make up for the wait though(more to follow on this) 2) Always have had AMAZING food here.  This time TERRIBLE.  Both fish entrees were very under seasoned and had a mushy texture to them.  Rice was dried out and no seasoning at all.  Asparagus and spinach was WAY overcooked and with no flavor at all.  Not sure what happened, as the previous visits the food was the star and second to none.  Maybe new kitchen help? 3) Wait service was the worst ever.  I was going to leave the waitress name, but I thought better of it.  She failed to put our free appetizer order in that the restaurant comped us for the long wait for the table.  We ended up having after our entrees.  VERY long waits in between her checking back on us for drinks or to even see if we needed anything at all.  She came to our table 3 times. Once to take order, once when we requested from another staff member to have her come to our table, because we didn't receive our appetizer, and the last time to bring check.  No thank you or anything.   Once one our favorite restaurants in Vegas, now not so much."}
{"text":"Went today for endless bubbles and brunch! Delicious! Great service. Good was served in a timely manner and nice and hot. Server was a doll. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"We came in for lunch on a Sunday.  There were lots of empty tables but we still had to wait about 20 minutes to be seated.  Then they seated us at a table that had been empty the entire time we waited.  That sort of set the mood for the meal.  I had the salmon and it was very good.  My husband had an omelet that seemed  small and my daughter had a burger that was too rare for her tastes.  Overall it was not the experience I was hoping for."}
{"text":"The food was amazing, but the service was the best part. We had  Billy as our waiter and he was the nicest and so helpful. Thanks for the great experience Billy. We will def be back!"}
{"text":"The corn chowder is fantastic. I also love the macaroni and cheese with mushrooms. I had a special lunch with bang bang shrimp tacos in the corn chowder for $11. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Bummer - the place is permanently CLOSED as of April 4, 2016. Lasted just over a year. BYe bye Bang Bang Shrimp!! Evidently the parent company has decided to close at least 14 Bonefish Grill's across the US."}
{"text":"Last night was my first time visiting Bonefish.  Me and my boyfriend met his mom there for dinner.  We were told it would be about 15-20min (it was very busy) so we made our way to the bar My boyfriend and I just ordered waters and his mom got some wine.  Within 10min our buzzard was going off and we were being walked to our booth.  The booths are soooo nice and big LOVE THEM!  Our waitress was very nice and joking around with us the only thing she forget to do was bring out the basket of bread in the begining........wish we simply reminded her and it was brought out.  We ordered the bang bang shrimp for an appetizer...........OH MY GOSH im addicted.......amazing! It has a bit of a bite and I am not one for spicy/hot things, but I could handle this they were GREAT!  His mom ordered some sort of clam chowder soup with crab meat in it and an order of the bang bang shirmp as her meal, my boyfriend ordered the bang bang shrimp tacos with au gratin potatoes, I ordred the Burger (I am just starting to experience with fish so I figured the bang bang shrimp would be enough seafood for me)  My burger was amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I also got the garlic mashed potatoes.......out of this world.   The bread and oil to dip it in were great as well.  The place itself is very big, dim lighting.  Like I said the booths are great, but as my boyfriend and his mom pointed out to me the tables are very tiny and very close together.  All in all cant wait for round 2 of Bonefish!!!!!!!  the only reason I said \"not good for kids\" is because I am not sure how many kids enjoy seafood, I know when I was younger all I wanted was mac and cheese, grilled cheese and p&j sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Fast service & fresh cooked food. We ordered the grilled salmon with asparagus & for dessert we did the flourless chocolate, macadamia dessert with raspberry sauce & vanilla ice cream to top it off. My mouth is watering writing this... it was devilishly good. We'll definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"We had a big party so granted it was going to be more work but I won't be coming back regardless. Our server was rude and literally pulled a glass out of my friend's hand. As a vegan, I couldn't eat anything off the pre-set menu and had to basically beg before they would let me pay extra for something off the regular menu. They also didn't inform us of the \"contract\" at the time of the reservation so we were all caught off guard when it came time to pay- one person was left to foot the bill for 30+ people. The food was good but it wasn't nearly enough to make-up for the poor service and lack of preparation. They ran out of mimosas at BOTTOMLESS brunch and didn't even apologize for the inconvenience nor did they adjust our bill."}
{"text":"The service is excellent, that's what you're paying for.  The food is good but you can see that portion control is a big part of the operation. The Scotch on the rocks was very skimpy. I had a special of shrimp stuffed with crab meat. It was prepared well but the shrimp were very small. I would have preferred larger shrimp with less pieces. The spinach was tasty but about one tablespoon. They spread it across the plate in an extremely thin layer about seven inches long. It looked sufficient but was actually an optional illusion. Bottom line a impressive place to take someone on the surface but actually a glorified chain."}
{"text":"This is a chain, and it tastes like a chain.  I guess it draws customers because the prices are not too bad, but there are a whole lot of better restaurants for a seafood meal.  I started with the jumbo lump crab cakes; both the jumbo and the lump were sorely missing.  Small crumbly cakes with a \"remoulade\" sauce that (to me) tasted like bottled thousand island dressing.  I then had the halibut, which was a decent piece of fish.  I liked that you get a choice of sauce to go on it.  The two sides that came with it were really bad.  I had the potatoes au gratin and the sauteed spinach.  Both were poorly cooked and terribly over salted.  I asked my wife about her meal and she simply said \"I wouldn't come back here.\"  The service was quick - in fact, a little too quick.  Like the food was pre-prepared and sitting under a heat lamp.  The main course arrived before we had finished out appetizers.  Their goal is clearly to get you in and out, post haste.  Despite that mistake, our server was generally helpful and attentive.  The ambiance wasn't too bad - maybe a little skimpy on decoration.  All things considered, dinner at Bonefish was a little more evidence for staying away from inexpensive chain restaurants."}
{"text":"First impression was ok.  Food service is very very slow. Not even full tables. Way to slow for lunch"}
{"text":"We were impressed on how good the quality of the seafood was. It tasted very fresh and each dish we had was great. i would say this is the best seafood place off the strip"}
{"text":"Second time with Reservations was a Charm  Tried to catch dinner at Bonefish about a month ago and was told 45 min plus wait.  This time we made reservations and were seated within 5 minutes of our reservation time.  A bit crowded but the bar was full of people watching the Preakness which added to the crowd.  We were seated a nice booth on the side of main dining room that also had a view of the large screen TV's in the Bar.  It was a concession on my wife's part to go out for dinner because she wanted to watch the race.  Turns out we both got what we wanted.  Our server was there shortly and he proved to be excellent throughout the evening.  First of all, he took our beverage order. I had 1/2 and 1/2 tea and my wife had a Raspberry Martini. She enjoyed her Martini but my tea, even 1/2 and 1/2, was still way too sweet.  I opted for a Ceviche which was very good with plenty of shrimp and other seafood delights.  Just enough lime to give it a good taste without being overpowering.  For entrees, my wife chose Bacon Wrapped Scallops with au gratin potatoes as her side.  I have the Cod Fish and Chips with Malt Vinegar.  My wife enjoyed her scallops whereas my fish was excellent. Good taste and texture with more than ample portion size. Definitely not greasy with a nice light taste.  We were both very pleased with our dinner.  We rarely opt for deserts but this was one of those rare occasions where we did.  My wife ordered Key Lime Pie ( I had a bite and it was great) while I went with the more traditional Creme Brulee. The custard part was a bit runny but good nevertheless.  Very enjoyable evening.  Atmosphere is nice but a bit noisy  Considering where this restaurant is located in Birkdale, parking is surprising easy.  A bit far off of the I-77 for those just passing through but if you're staying in the area, a definite possiblity"}
{"text":"Hummmm.... It's really too bad that their happy hour isn't more... More of anything to be exact... More food offering or drink selection.  They offer $3.50 for house wine only Chardonnay white zin, merlot or cab blend. $6.00 for bang bang shrimp is the ONLY food option.   My husband and I came here because we had a gift card and we're happy that we spent no cash out of pocket.  We walked in right at 4pm for happy hour and found we were 2 of 6 guests.  We stayed for about and hour and half and maybe at the most 10 guest including us were there by time we left and this was on a Friday night.   Service: 4/5 our waitress was sweet   Food: fresh ceviche 3/5 just average nothing special Edamame 3/5 average  Calamari 3/5 average we asked for sautéed vs breaded   Unfortunately nothing was mind blowing and left us overall a bit unsatisfied that we ended up going to Flemings after for their happy hour.  Was happy we tried it and don't feel like we are missing out if we don't go back.    Recommend them beefing up their happy hour to attract more people.   Overall... I would pass on this pass average"}
{"text":"This place is great!  The Bang Bang Shrimp appetizer and tacos are awesome!  Fall Apple Martini was excellent.   Service was a little slow, but server was friendly.   Everyone in our group enjoyed their food. Fish and Chips were hot and tasty.   Would highly recommend trying this location. I know we will be back."}
{"text":"In Cleveland for the week on a business trip. Went to Bonefish the other night and was thoroughly impressed. Had two appetizers for dinner - started with the tuna tartare tacos (AMAZING) and followed up with the lamb chop lollipops, which were prepared and presented perfectly. Bar staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. Would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a high quality meal in a classy and clean environment."}
{"text":"Tasty meal. I've been to other Bonefish Grill and always had a good experience. Ceasar salad was delicious, complimentary bread with olive oil delicious. I had shrimp and scallop meal with pesto sauce and it was all cooked perfectly! My husband had Caribbean Mahi Mahi with mango salsa and it was also really good. Atmosphere is ok. Waitress very nice. Went on a week night and it was pretty full around 7pm."}
{"text":"We had such a delicious dinner here last night! Everything is great but be sure to order from the seasonal specials! The misoyski seabass is to die for! My husband loved the oscar mahi mahi. Jamie was our server; she is the sweetest and so competent! Excellent wine recommendations, too!"}
{"text":"I was in the area for a small family reunion. My brother, who lives nearby, chose this place. I love seafood, as does the rest of my family, so it seemed like a no brainer. We arrived especially early (5:30p) on a Sunday, yet the place was already quite busy. The general sense that I had from this place from the moment we crossed the threshold was that they were a bit overwhelmed: it took a while to get a clean booster chair for my niece, we waited just to get drinks, and then we experienced an even longer wait for our entrees (like 45 minutes!). I'm glad we had some appetizers to tide us over; otherwise my dad would have turned into that creature he becomes when hungry.  The food there was good, not spectacular. I asked for a large order of the seabass and swear they mistakenly gave me the small order because the portion size was very small (I think they confused it with another order at our table, to be honest).   I'm not sure I'd return to this location when I return. I think there are places with more consistent service, more competitive prices (even I, who lives in CA, was surprised by the price tags!), and better food in the vicinity.   PS-the bang bang shrimp is highly overrated (unless you like battered, saucy, heavy appetizers). If so, make sure to ask for your heart attack on the side."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service! We came for the sunday brunch. Great deal with excellent food! Our server was very efficient and friendly. Gave us great menu recommendations.  We will return."}
{"text":"My parents and I went into Bonefish Grill during a busy Valentine's Day weekend. We were seated promptly (even though I decided to be a pain in the butt by asking for a booth- no biggie! They were saved for reservations.   We were greeted by one gentleman (I forgot his name!) that reassured us Michael would be our server and although he was busy at the moment, the other server would at least get us started with drinks. Having been a server for many years, this got extra points for me!   We had never been to Bonefish and with me being indecisive and my mother asking 34567548 questions, Michael had his hands full. He was very knowledgable but what impressed me even more was the fact that if he did not know the answer to our questions, he was willing to go ask someone. Kudos, Michael, kudos!  Everything we got was excellent! ( maybe except for the jasmine rice- pops said it wasn't very flavorful. It's rice, dad) Service was great, good was great and the last little bit I will say is that the presence of the manager on the floor was very much noticed and appreciated. He was friendly, knowledgable, and so helpful to his staff as well! You guys are doing some good things there! Excited to go back! :)"}
{"text":"It was nice inside.  I had two things some seviche which was so acidic that I had heartburn for days and some fish that was mediocre I left disappointed"}
{"text":"We love bonefish grill. Especially the bang bang shrimp. We went with out family for my husbands birthday and this was the first restaurant that ever gave him a birthday card with a coupon for a free bang bang shrimp appetizer! I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I really like the vibe in this place. It was Pretty quiet for a Saturday lunch. The wait staff was on it refilling waters and complimentary bread with olive oil. I ordered the fish and chips with a Caesar salad. The fish was heavily battered which isn't really my favorite but the fries were perfectly crusted. The salad was not too oily and the croutons were very crunchy. Overall good experience and a great place to go if you are in the town square area."}
{"text":"Love Brenda, the bartender.   Also, tip, you can get the Bang Bang shrimp without the coating (like naked). But I still like the sauce.    Went to their Wine Pairing (Lohr) last night.  It was great.  The ceviche salad, the lump crab cakes, the lamb chops, and the pumpkin crème brulee were all delicious.  The chef came to our table and was so friendly and knowledgeable.  Cost was $55 a person and w/tax & tip about $70 a person.   Overall a great experience.  We each took home some trinkets and prizes."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. I was in the area for work and got horrible food poisoning from this place. I had to change my travel plans because I was so sick. I know it was this place that caused my food poisoning because this was the only thing I ate all day. Be careful eating here."}
{"text":"I used to love this place.  Last Friday my husband and I came here for dinner.  We ordered the ceviche for an appetizer and shared the Trout.  Fish was good but the sides were small (2 slices of zucchini cut up and a dollop of rice).  The rice was so salty we could not eat it."}
{"text":"TopWell this is one time no matter what a Yelp review or anyone said we are glad we didn't listen.  We had a great waiter names Thomas, the food was very good. Of course the bang bang shrimp was tasty.  They now have a great Tuesday night dinner special so check it out   Back again good food but could try to remove the dirty plates faster  Decided to update again and drop it a star. Thinking about last nights dinner wasn't so hot, wife's fish was not that great and the service was a let down from our last trip there.   Might go back once in a while but that's about it. There are better fish places"}
{"text":"Nice place! Romantic restaurant! Low lights! Pricey! Service was ok, waitress took a long time to come to our table. Other then that service was ok. I just had the bang bang shrimps which was REALLY GOOD!!   PLEASE NOTE: Bone fish have the Bang Bang Shrimp $6 every Wednesday!"}
{"text":"First: who doesn't love the bang bang shrimp? Now that we have that out of the way.  I have a monthly dinner group with rotating selection of restaurants. Someone else picked Bonefish and I was happy to be able to get the bang bang shrimp.  Our entire party arrived early and was seated; I was five minutes behind but still 15 minutes early. Apparently, this meant I was to be ignored by the server and staff for the rest of the evening.  My drink order was taken late, my drink took longer, my dinner never arrived until I asked, at which point they made up an excuse about the scallops being cooked incorrectly. I opted to cancel my dinner order, but it still showed up 10 minutes later. They tried to offer me a free dessert but at this point I preferred my pot pie at home and ice cream.  Plus, I ordered another drink that took even longer to come. Server was... ineffective and confused.  Of course, they offered to comp my dinner but sure enough, it was on the bill. Tried to explain that to the server but he couldn't comprehend simple logic or math.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Friendly atmosphere and good service. I had the creme brûlée French toast and ate every bite, my husband had the filet mignon lobster Benedict and loved it. Well priced menu."}
{"text":"When asked about a discount card for myself (one they just previously gave to my friend 30min before when he just walked in for a menu) I was told by the server that the manager was giving those away \"like a while ago, and that they were all out.\" Which slightly Irritated me. However the food more than made up for it. The bang bang shrimp to start and anglers steak (11 oz) with Gorgonzola butter for the main course was incredible. The cheesecake to finish it off was perfect. 4 stars because the waitress lied to me. But I will be coming back with my wife!"}
{"text":"We had a great group of friends last night get together for our christmas gift cards redemption and we came here for a night in Birkdale Village. We had the Bang bang shrimp, edamame and potstickers for appetizers. I have always had the bang bang shrimp but I had never bought the potstickers which was very tender, brown on the bottom and delicious!  For the main course we all bought different things and everyone was very happy with their choice. I had the trout which i always wanted to try, the kitchen did a phenomenal job grilling the trout with crispy skin as well and keeping the fish tender. Some of us ordered the sweet mashed potatoes and they were very favorable and delicious! My wife had the scallops and shrimp, it was so good that I didn't even get an offer to try it.  I even hate to review anything bad because we all agreed we would not let the waitress ruin our evening out as friends, but she was either new or just bad. Our waitress was very soft spoken commanded no attention when she spoke and forgot to fill our glasses several times, bring utensils, which we asked a hostess walking by to grab our waitress. I asked her at one point after I ordered and drank my coffee after the meal if I had to order another coffee or are refills included, she then brought us more coffee. She needed more training or at least apply her common sense. I like the Bonefish and I will go back as I always do and have a great meal, hopefully our waitress will be better trained next time. 2 thumbs up on the ambiance and food."}
{"text":"Concord Mills is stepping up its food game. I happened into Bonefish because other locations around the country give great sea food at a price that is reasonable and this place was right in line with the rest.  I had the Seared Tuna to start along with a salad and the freshness was like \"just caught\".  The sword fish for my main dish was also well done like I have come to expect from Bonefish.  The part of the meal that blew me away was the desert.  The carrot cake was to die for.  Fresh, moist, just the right amount of frosting.  Perfect.  Would have given this place a 5/5 but the parking is going to be a problem.  Opt for the valet and save yourself the trouble of trying to find a spot.  Concord mills is great at getting new places to eat and shop but adding a couple of higher end places to eat in the middle of the parking lot seems like an unwise move."}
{"text":"Since Bonefish Grill closed in CT we've been missing it. We were so happy to find this location and it was just as we remembered at home! Our waitress seemed a bit unhappy to be at work at first meeting but she seemed to get over it quickly enough. Our meals were delicious, as usual! One tiny complaint, my husband ordered the scallops and shrimp and thought they were a little too cold, needed to be hotter."}
{"text":"The sea bass is amazing and the crab soup is awesome.  Only downside is the sides are all a little bland. The crab fried rice was ok but it needed to be stir-fried together instead of jusr cold crab meat placed on top."}
{"text":"We came for happy hour. It was relaxing and enjoyable. The happy hour drink prices are very reasonable and the bartenders, Brandy Brenda and Brian were very personable and efficient. There is a VERY limited happy food menu but the blue cheese kettle chips were amazing! And the ceviche was very good. The decor is beautiful and the ambiance very nice. Brian was able to create a drink for my husband, even going to the kitchen for ingredients for it. It is a must go to in Summerlin!"}
{"text":"Good service. Good bread.  The rest of the meal was disappointing. The ceviche was rather flavorless and overcooked. A fellow patron bar echoed the sentiment and said the Bang Bang shrimp was much better.  I also had the basil fettuccine with salmon. The sauce smelled unpleasant and had a really fatty mouthfeel with a vinegary taste. The vegetables were substituted from what was described on the menu with no warning.   There were some regulars that seemed fond of the place so maybe I just choose poorly in my menu items."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for dinner on a Saturday night, made reservations online for 715. Bc that was first available. Arrived around 7, and checked in. Saw multiple other people come in without reservations and get sat. Finally got sat at 730. Besides this, meal was great had shrimp and scallops with butter sauce, asparagus, and crab fried rice. Excellent service, and great food, will be back, but will not waste my time with the reservations."}
{"text":"Our double birthday party was a party of 16.  Ralph, managing partner, and his staff treated us like royalty.  All the fish was amazing, however, the beef not so much - that's my only reason they didn't get 5 stars.  Thank you for an amazing birthday!"}
{"text":"I don't know how these guys only have 3.5 stars, this is one of my favorite places for seafood in town. You CAN NOT beat the bang bang shrimp. Love their decor and always have excellent service."}
{"text":"Fantastic seafood with classic plates that have a modern twist to them. Spicy Asian Calamari and the \"Bang Bang\" Shrimp apps are great. MacNut brownie and Key Lime pie are up to par as well. Prices are fantastic as well as the ambiance."}
{"text":"I went here on sat with my husband for the first time , when I walked in I was like eh  not really sure if I was feeling it but then I ordered some appetizers which was the ceviche and then we had the main course the filet mignon,  well let me just tell you everything was so delicious,  the ceviche was to die for it was not fishy it was fresh it was wonderful, they give you this bread to start with with a delicious pesto sauce I was totally obsessed with it.  Our server  misty was wonderful too, very attentive , we didn't have to ask her for anything , she was spot on , the drinks were flowing, I will totally be back here."}
{"text":"What can I say....  The manager here (Marcus Powers), AWESOME guy.  He has people skills like you wouldn't believe and I have to say that his training of the staff here shows.  And he's a joker (in a good way).  All of his staff were cordial, wonderful, and could explain all sorts of things going on with the menu, happy hour, and everything.   A group of friends and I came to this location thinking it's just another Bonefish.  WRONG.  The food is still as good as the other places, but the people.... oh yes, the people, make the Town Square location an awesome place to be.  Marcus, my man.... I'm coming back.  Keep my booth waiting.  If Laura's in town, we'll be there, buddy so you can get your percentage up."}
{"text":"Went last night for the Tuesday specials with my spouse.  Surprisingly, we sat right down despite not having reservation on Tuesday special night at 6:00! He  had the ahi seared tuna steak w/ pan Asia sauce. He loved it. I had the sirloin (which had a little more fat than I expected) that had s great taste & cooked to perfection. Our waitress was excellent. Also took advantage of the $3.25 glasses of wine.  Not thrilled with the kitchen made whipped cream. It was \"mediciney\" (not a word but only way to describe. Bang bang shrimp was absolutely amazing & would get as a meal itself! All the vegetables & everything else were very fresh. Generous portions that had me very full when I left!! It's a little tight in there & very noisy- it maybe be we were sat at a small table for two in the middle of the restaurant. It was busy bc we were there at 6:00.  Would definitely return"}
{"text":"Love this place.  It's great to see a chain achieve success while still managing to keep the prices reasonable.  We've been to three different Bonefish's, and they have been remarkably consistent, especially for the level of quality.  You have to try the Bang Bang Shrimp."}
{"text":"Sad to say that I was underwhelmed by the food and more disappointed by the service.  We ordered from the bar menu and had a coupon for a free appetizer because I signed up for their email club. We had the lamb lollipops which were cute but a little bland (salt fixed that); the ahi tostadas which had browned avocado ; the Mac and cheese bites which were good but very rich for my taste; and the Chipotle shrimp sliders which also were bland.   Now, my gripe with the service stems from the coupon we had. The coupon stated that we'd get EITHER the sliders or Mac and cheese bites for free. There were separate codes for the server to enter into the system depending on what we ordered. When we got our bill, the Mac and cheese bites were taken off. Only thing is that they can were the least expensive of the two options. I know it's only 3 bucks but c'mon! It would have been great for management to do us a solid and choose the more expensive one to deduct since they had a choice in the matter. When I asked our server about it she just passed the buck off to management saying that it was their sole decision.... Sad"}
{"text":"Finally, restaurant staff that works together and a manager that knows how to right a wrong. We're long time fans of the brand, but this was our first time at this location. It was a very busy night, as they had a Father's Day promotion going on. There was a large party in my waiter station, and they seem to be very high maintenance. We sat for what was starting to feel like longer then we should, when another waitress came over, apologized that her colleague was delayed, and offered to take our drink and appetizer order. She brought us water and bread. She proceeded to keep her eye on our table throughout the night, and pitched in whenever necessary. Our waiter seemed rather inexperienced, and it seemed a large party was really throwing him for a loop. He was very rattled when he waited on us, and then screwed up the order. When we told the food runner that what he brought was in order, the manager was at our table with in seconds. She was very apologetic, made no excuses and took full responsibility for the error. Very professional! Katie Fuller, you should give lessons to other restaurant managers in the Charlotte area!!  They got the corrected order out to our table reasonably quick. Katie and our waiter checked back often to ensure everything was OK, and they graciously comp'ed the meal.  Both my husband and I have worked in the restaurant industry, and we know crap happens. It's how you handle the crap that makes the real difference. Katie and the staff turned what would've been a miserable dining experience into a very refreshing example of what good service should look like. We will be back. Bang-Bang!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here for the first time two weekends ago.  His food was great but mine came out cold.  We had to wait and wait for our server to come back and see how the food was and then waited another half and hour to get a new entree that was actually warm.   I have been a server before and understood that everyone has an off night so we gave it a try again today January 21 because the reviews were so good.  We sat at the bar and not only did we wait over 15 minutes to even get water both our food came out cold.  No one came and checked on us.  When we explained the situation there was no apology or anything and we then waited again for warm food and again no one addressed refilled our drinks in the meantime or anything.  Overall it was a waste of a Sunday afternoon brunch that took over two hours and was terrible food and service.  We will never be back or recommend this establishment to anyone!!!!"}
{"text":"I can definitively? say that I do not have bone to pick with this place....get it? BONE? HA! I am so punny....I can barely contain myself! I first was introduced to Bonefish from a Yelp Elite event that I attended (if you do not know what a Yelp Elite is, I suggest you research it. WE ARE AWESOME!) I had passed Bonefish many times but never stopped in. But, my eyes were opened to the truth and I saw the fishy light!   This location is located next to the Holiday Inn on Rockside. The parking lot of this place is really wonky. It is tucked away next to the highway and there wasn't much room to make a lot that functioned particularly well. I must say....I hate the flow of this lot and there aren't enough spaces in my opinion.   The interior of this location is a bit dated IMHONSHO (in my humble or not so humble opinion) and could really use a revamp. The decor is just okay and I kind of felt like it made Bonefish feel cheap and trust me, the menu is anything but cheap. Say goodbye paycheck! A dinner for 2 will set you back at least $50. But, if you play your cards right and come in during happy hours, you can slip away without committing financial hari-kari.Our server Melissa was very nice, but not very attentive. Many times we had to flag her down. I do not want to feel like an air traffic controller when it comes to my meal.   Started the meal off with their Blueberry Lemon Drop Martini. Linda Linda.....listen to me Linda. THIS DRINK ROCKED MY SOCKS! It actually tasted like REAL blueberries and was made very well. Not skimping on the alcohol and bold on the flavors. For $5 I couldn't pass it up!   I cannot eat gluten, so I got the Bang Bang shrimp sauteed with unbreaded shrimp as it was $6 on the day we went. The Bang Bang sauce is a great blend of sweet and spicey (kinda like me!) It comes on a small bed of romaine and while not filling, it is very good.  Next, I got myself the Raspberry Vodka Collins. This drink came in the prettiest little tilted glass and the presentation was really professionally done. Slightly sweet, slightly tart and a little bubbly. It was a nice refreshing drink.  For the meal I ordered and thoroughly enjoyed the Fontina Pork Chop. Dude, I love me some porcine style goodness and this dish? IT DELIVERED! The cook on this chop was damn near holy. I swear I felt the presence of Jesus when I cut into it. The flavor was spot on and the fontina cheese just sets the dish off. Got it with green beans and broccoli.   Great meal! I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"WHERES THE COCONUT PIE?! HEY BONEFISH, BRING IT BACK! Usually bonefish is good drinks good food and fantastic coconut pie! They recently took their signature coconut pie that was covered in a warm rum sauce and homemade like whipped cream off the menu! Though the food is good and the drinks are still flowing I can't say we'll be back as often as before, it made the meal.    For this location outside dining in the nicer months is a good option. The bar is nicely laid out and the big tables in the bar are first come first serve. Parking isn't limited."}
{"text":"Gave this place a try after not eating here for a year or so in hopes they got their act together. That was a mistake.   Ordered the pineapple shrimp with Coconut risotto and asparagus. The risotto was still cold (ice cold) when I tasted the dinner. Not sure how you serve risotto very cold. I thought risotto was made to order. I can see it getting cool from sitting but this tells me they just microwave pre made shit. The server overheard me say it's ICE COLD.  She took it back. It came out 10 minutes later, after others were finished, and was the same dish only 500 degrees. Everything was LIMP. Microwaved to heat of hades. Of course I refused to eat it. Any of it. Just went to McDonald's for better quality food. At least there you know you are getting shit but not paying Bonefish prices.   I'm amazed anyone goes here with all the other options in the area."}
{"text":"Silly hours for a place one step above Red Lobster.  Got bang bang shrimp take away.  Breading was soggy.  Nothing great about this place."}
{"text":"(10/6/17) We haven't been here for years... The restaurant was full of diners at 8pm but they found a table for two walk ins with no reservations. I had a couple white Russians and ordered a large portion of the tuna sashimi and an order of weygu beef dumplings. Both were very good. My wife had a mojito and fish and chips. For my entree I ordered the two cold water lobster tails. The tails were tender and sweet. I normally don't associate sweet with lobster. I also had a side of Jasmine rice and sauteed spinach. The sides were good as well. For dessert I had a slice of coconut cream pie with a rum sauce. It was easily the best meal I've had in a long time."}
{"text":"We were skeptical when we decided to try out this place because we had never heard about it and someone told us it had only been open for a little over a year (it was only after our visit that I found out it was actually a chain).  Turned out my skepticism was unwarranted as our dinner there easily exceeded expectations.  Appetizers started with a soft sourdough with olve oil and basil (?).  I decided to try the lump crab corn chowder, which was excellent on its own and even better using as a dip for the bread.  My entree was the longfin stuffed with shrimp, scallops, and more lump crab, doused with a delicious cream sauce.  I'm salivating just remembering it, and it went very well with my sides, asparagus and potatoes al gratin.  If I could criticize anything, the fish itself (tilapia) was a little on the bland side, but with everything put together it was hardly noticeable.  After the bread and soup, I could hardly finish the large fish entree, although I tried my best because I didn't want to waste.    The ambiance was nice... dark like most restaurants try to be to give you the \"upscale\" experience, but because the tables are so close to each other it hardly feels as private as the lighting would suggest.  Service was quick and to the point.  Just a party of two, we were in and out of there in less than an hour.  I'm not sure when or if I'll ever get a chance to visit Cleveland again but now that I know Bonefish is a chain I will definitely keep my eye out..."}
{"text":"Although this is a chain, I think it is worth reviewing because it is new to the North Hills and many of you may not have dined here before like you have other chains. Bonefish is much more elegant inside than your typical chain eatery, but not so fancy that you can't just walk in from off the street...it is a chain after all. The must-try dish here is the Bang Bang Shrimp. Before trying the dish at Bonefish, I had made a similar copycat dish from Skinny Taste and it was delicious so I knew the real thing would also be good and I wasn't disappointed.  The shrimp are battered and fried and then coated in a creamy sriracha/spicy chili sauce and served on a bed of lettuce. It should be mandatory for any first time Bonefish diner to order these shrimp. SO SO GOOD!"}
{"text":"Since most communities have independently-owned upscale restaurants,.the idea of dining at an 'upscale restaurant chain' such as Bonefish Grill often eludes me. Nevertheless, we had a better-than-expected time dining here.    The ambiance set a great tone and high expectations for the night. We kicked off with seasonal cocktails and I appreciated that the Grapefruit Basic Martini was 'fresh and grapefruity.'  It featured the 'bitter' side of 'bittersweet' which really hit the spot after cookie-filled holidays.    The meal began with fresh-based bread and seasoned dipping oil. It was tasty, but it wasn't inhaled as quickly as the coconut Thai Shrimp appetizer we ordered.  Both the Shrimp bisque and shrimp/scallop entree impressed the 'SeaFoodie' in our group.  I enjoyed the Sirloin and Crab Cake entree.  The crab cake was loaded with flaky crab meat and the sauce that accompanied it added flavor to the crab cake, my steak, and the bland crab-fried rice side dish.  Service was excellent. When they brought the wrong taco entree to a guest at our table, they replaced it quickly with an apology and a free dessert.    Bonefish Grill doesn't compare to the best high-end local restaurants, but the food and drinks are good -- as are the prices.  On Tuesday, they offer a variety of three-course dinner options for less than $20."}
{"text":"Brunch at Bonefish!  This was our first Sunday brunch at Bonefish and it did not disappoint.  It normally takes a lot to get us out for Sunday brunch because lines are long, and due to crowds food can be mediocre.  We make a mean breakfast meal so we usually opt to stay in and cook at home.  We decided to change it up this morning and bike to brunch.  To our surprise, no big lines and an overall enjoyable brunch.  My husband had the western omelette and I had the bang bang shrimp eggs Benedict.  We also had $5 mimosas.  They still have a full lunch menu for those who may want something different.  But brunch was great!"}
{"text":"Mediocre Food, Good Service, Presentable Restaurant, Basically an Upscale Red Lobster  Pros:  Service, Clean Cons:  Food is sub par  My wife and I dined at Bonefish Grill last Monday.  While we found the server very friendly and attentive, the food was mediocre and sub par.    Apps (Wagyu Beef + Ginger Potstickers / Wedge Salad)  The potstickers were really unmemorable.  I wouldn't say that they are bad, but I wouldn't say that they are better than frozen ones you can get at Trader Joes.  For the \"wagyu\" beef, it really didn't taste like anything, which made me believe that they were frozen or likely prepared at a central commissary.  As for the salad, it was good, but slightly under dressed.  I wondered if the server is the one who prepares the salad.  If so, then the salad will probably be inconsistent depending on who makes it.  Entrees (Georges Bank Scallops & Shrimp, Caribbean-Style Fresh Cobia)  Starting with the good, the cobia was excellent.  I would order this again, but since I'm never going back to Bonefish, I'll just order it when I go to RM Seafood.  The garnish on this dish was notable since it was so much superior to the garnish on the Georges dish.  First, the scallops were simply insipid with a strange texture.  Second, the accompanying shrimp were the same, except that the shrimp with the cobia was much tastier and seasoned better.  Third, the salsa on this dish was strange in that it was mushy and felt like it was overcooked (not that I've had a cooked salsa before).    Dessert (Chocolate Lava Cake)  This is not a lava cake.  It is a bundt cake that is covered and filled with strange tasting chocolate.    Anyway, if you're the type of person who likes the Cracker Barrel, you'll probably be impressed with Bonefish Grill.  However, I would rather just go to Yardhouse since the seafood there is better than Bonefish Grill.  You could also go to Todd's Unique Dining.  If I wanted something more expensive, I would go to RM Seafood, Maestro's Ocean Club, or Milos."}
{"text":"As you will see in many other reviews, the corn & crab chowder steals the show.  It is a perfectly balanced, creamy, mildly sweet blend with a soupcon of spicy heat.  Everything else was just a tad off.  The potatoes were dry and the fish was about 2 minutes overcooked while the haricot vert, could have used about 2 more minutes of cook time.  The wait staff is knowledgeable, almost to the point of condescension.  I had to chuckle when I requested some butter for my beans and the waiter asked if I'd like cold or drawn butter.  Not having heard what he said, I said what? He began to explain what drawn butter was, when I only needed him to repeat what he said.  If you mention that it's your first time at Bonefish Grill, prepare yourself for a lengthy pitch on the history and quality of the establishment.  It's definitely worth a try, but expect to pay a little more than you would at Red Lobster."}
{"text":"We went there to celebrate my birthday. What we thought would be a simple meal turned into a wonderful experience. The food was wonderful and the service was exceptional. Our waitress Jaleen was attentive, kind and cheerful.  Every need we had was anticipated and cared for before we had to ask or even realized we needed something.   We had almost given up on Bonefish Grill because of our terrible experiences at the Town Square location- glad we gave the Charleston location a shot. They are well worth it. Thanks for a great birthday meal."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. It is just that simple. I have been to this location on 4 occasions and the last 2 were so  disappointing that I doubt I will return. The hostess was just a step above rude and definitely a terrible first impression. This was the case on both of our last 2 visits. The last time I asked for some extra salad dressing on the side and it was brought to me when I already was 1/2 way through my main course. I had lobster and was not given any melted butter. Our server knew she didn't bring it and as I waited and waited I finally asked someone else for some butter; because now my lobster was getting cold. Our waitress brought the butter and was put out and confrontational as she asked if I needed more because I was asking her peers to bring me butter. Food was good. Service is not only substandard it is rude. Management was nowhere to be seen. There are too many restaurants in this city with friendly staff to waste your time and money at this Bonefish Grill."}
{"text":"Second visit and we sat out on the patio.  Service at the front was far better this time.  Forget about a new food review...what I had was great, well thought out and very tasty blah blah blah.  What really set this meal apart was our server, TK.  This guy was hands down one of the best servers I've ever had, period; fine dining included.  I highly recommend that the management at Bonefish does whatever it can to retain him as an employee.  This guy has the skills of a well seasoned fine dining server.  Because of this I am granting this establishment a well deserved 5 stars.  In the future, I will be requesting TK and fully expect him to still be employed here; else I will never return hahaa!"}
{"text":"The service was great. The food was not. The potatoes au gratin were a joke. My steak was undercooked. The food was pre-fab McDonalds quality crap."}
{"text":"Came for brunch this morning with a group of people on reservation. I had no problem making the reservation or having checks separated. The greeting and wait staff were all super friendly.  I ordered the mimosa and the bang bang shrimp Benedict with asparagus.  I thought the food and drink were great, though I would have preferred a more traditional hollandaise sauce than the thick almost cheese-like sauce on the bang bang Benedict. Others who ordered traditional Benedict did appear to have the standard hollandaise sauce.  I will def come back and I look forward to trying dinner next time.  So I've been back to Bonefish twice since the original review above. Once was for brunch with a friend and I was advised they are not serving brunch any longer, despite the website stating they do. I got salmon and some veggies. Very basic, but it was def tasty.  The other time I went with a friend and ordered the Caesar salad, which was quite small and not exciting. I also ordered crab cakes which were a complete disappointment   not only were they very small, but they were also more like patties that would come from a non-seafood restaurant trying to serve something gourmet-ish.  Total fail for Bonefish.  I feel like their food is inconsistent and certainly not anywhere near as good as it was when I first tried them so many years ago. I may go back, hut only if others want to go there and nowhere else. Otherwise, there is far better quality only a few minutes away.  4/10/17 - UPDATE:  I've demoted Bonefish a point. I've been here a couple times now and find the food to be sub par quality at best and just lacking the atmosphere I remember from years ago. it wouldn't bother me to not come back again.  it's loud, it's uncomfortably hot, there's no ambiance at ALL, the table we got sat at was filthy, and the wait staff didn't know much about the fish being served."}
{"text":"Great food! Love love love the patio! Service is outstanding.  They have a wonderful wine list too.  Easy parking makes it easy to get in and out of Town Square."}
{"text":"We have been to the Town Square location 4-5 times, and were excited to see one closer to our house and wanted to try it. We love the decor it is very comfortable, and the service is always A++.    I received an e-mail excitedly telling me with beautiful photos about the yummy dishes that would be awaiting me once I went in. Yeah! I was inspired, and away we went.  Upon sitting down, was a bit disappointed to be told that this location does not actually honor the company-wide e-mails and they do not have these dishes or promotions that we have come in for. Even though we were told by a manager, they are know to be \"wildly successful\" for the other locations. OK, there are other choices. Not the end of the world.  We both order entrees, starting with caesar salads. And even though the Romain in the salad we super fresh and crunchy, our salads were actually completely flavorless, pre-manufactured croutons, barely any cheese. It was a dud.  Entrees - We both ordered a season special. Mine was great, my partner was mediocre.   Key lime pie for dessert was delicious.  This is my exact challenge with Bonefish, which I was hoping would not be the case in this new location. It is frequently inconsistent and rarely amazing. The food is \"fine\", but for a $100 dinner, I kinda want something awesome! And yet, I think we keep going back for the comfy booths and excellent service."}
{"text":"This place is a tricky one for me. I have been 4-5 times. I have had some AMAZING meals here and I have had a couple really mediocre meals. I am not sure I really understand. How can they be so great and so meh at the same time?  Now, I will always ask for the waitperson to make recommendations. That seems to be the way to go here. An insider's tip. And hopefully they will become more consistent, now that they are preparing to open one really close to our house.  Overall, we keep going back, the service is always A+, and the decor is comfy, not to loud and a great place to bring people for dinner."}
{"text":"We were excited to try Bonefish Grill when we were visiting Las Vegas because of all the great reviews. Their menu items looked appetizing and it was conveniently located at the Towne Square (an upper scale version of The Americana or The Grove).  The GOOD: [Substitutions] I chose an entree that was supposed to come with two skewers (scallops and shrimp). Being slightly allergic to shrimp, they were able to change it to another skewer of scallops. They didn't have anything else on the menu that was just scallops or scallops without shrimp.  [Not Crowded]  We were seated right away.  The BAD: [Slow Service] It was awesome that we were seated right away, but when it's not crowded and the dining experience is a two hour long one, not cool.  [Mojitos Sucked] Everyone was raving about the Black Cherry Guava Mojito, but for some reason it had an after taste (maybe artificial sweetener?). I'm a REAL sugar type of girl and the drink would have been better with real cane sugar or just regular simple syrup. FYI - it wasn't indicated on the menu what type of sugar was used.  OVERALL: It was nice to try once, but if I had a choice between dining here or a casual eatery like California Fish Grill back home, I would pick the later because of taste and variety alone.

{"text":"I was very excited to hear about the restaurant  re-opening in Las Vegas. It was a good decent amount of people for a Tuesday night, but not real busy. We decided to sit in the bar area and take advantage of their happy hour specials. When we sat down, the hostess came by with some menus and told us their specials which was great, however it took awhile before a waiter acknowledged that we were there.   We noticed that there were several waiters, standing around and just chatting and they just kept walking by us and didn't say anything. One waitress, that walked by us several times did finally say to us that she apologized for the delay, she didn't know who was our server and that our server did not come in yet and she will be taking our order.  We ordered the steamed mussels and several other items that were on the happy hour menu. Our food came fairly quickly, but no one brought us any silverware. We waited for our waitress to come by so we can ask her, but she never did. My husband finally decided to get it himself and went to the bar to ask for 2 place settings.   I have to say that the food was excellent and delicious as I remembered the first time I ate at this establishment several years ago, when it was in Henderson. I would definitely come back, but wish the service was much better.  I realize they just opened a few months ago and have to work out a few things. It looks like they have a lot of help, but all of them just stand around and talk. They need to work on this.  I would give this restaurant a higher rating if the service was much better."}
{"text":"Food is always amazing!  Bang bang shrimp is a MUST!  However service was very slow!  Sat down at a table with no silverware or cups for the water that was given to us.  Staff seemed somewhat chaotic.  Would return just for the best appetizer ever!"}
{"text":"Great selection of fish, plus plenty of other non-seafood options. Gluten free menu has an array of food to choose from too :) service has been great both times I went. Definitely recommend the Chilean sea bass"}
{"text":"First visit and overall a very nice experience. On Tuesdays they offer 5 course meals that are a very good value. Bang Bang shrimp lived up to reviews and was exceptional. Service was oustanding (kudos to Taya) Nice decor. Did'nt really feel like a chain. Will return.....No Wi Fi ?"}
{"text":"Love the Sunday Brunch! Surf and Turf eggs Benedict was great. Hubby got the Kobe beef and egg burger and couldn't put it down until he was done eating."}
{"text":"Service was so so. Waitress was kinda snooty. Ordered a filet & got a sirloin (eh). Manager adjusted the bill. Ordered asparagus was brought mixed veggies drowned in sauce that got all over everything else on plate, so of course plate had to be re-made.   And for a place w/the word \"grill\" in the name you would've thought they'd grill the asparagus? ....nope, blanched in a pot of water & soggy.   Disappointed. MIGHT give them another chance ....in a year or two. :("}
{"text":"Great Dinner! Can't go wrong with the crab cake dinner and Patricia behind the bar was excellent."}
{"text":"Went here on whim one night after a long day. The restaurant was mostly empty despite being a Saturday night. Our waitress was very professional and attentive. My fiancé and I both ordered off the \"Specials\" menu and everything was delicious. A bit pricey but it is mostly seafood, so we expected that. The sangria was outstanding. Our server also told us about their brunch special on Sundays which we will definitely be going back for that soon."}
{"text":"I was surprisingly impressed with Bonefish Grill, which I didn't honestly expect to be (not usually a fan of chains).   Side note for people with kids: Don't short change yourself, they are a moderately loud restaurant, so don't hesistate to bring the babies. And their children's meals look more like mini-adult meals (steamed broccoli, bell peppers, carrots, and snow peas were on my niece's plate!).  Side note for people with gluten allergies: They have an ENTIRE menu that is for gluten-free folks with some solid offerings. My food-snob baby sister didn't feel relegated to the salad menu for once. It was awesome!  Since I was out with my sister-in-law and sister, we decided to have some fun and ordered our meal in reverse. Desserts first! The chocolate creme brulee was good, but it was the flourless chocolate brownie that really knocked my socks off. The addition of the raspberry sauce was phenomenal and the macadamia nuts were a great touch.  We ended up ordering appetizers/salads as both the entrees and the appetizers, so we'll go down the list:  - Bang Bang Shrimp: I loved these, my dinner partners were not quite as excited. I thought the creamy/spicy sauce was divine.  - Maryland Crabcakes: There was some SERIOUS crab meat in these things. They pretty much fell apart (which is A-OK with me) because there was too much meat and not enough binding ingredients.   - Wagyu Beef & Ginger dumplings: ROCKED. These were fantastic. Little packets of beefy-spicy explosion.   - Thai Coconut Shrimp: These were actually the hit of the table. I wish we had ordered two plates, because 6 shrimp between 3 people kinda sucked. The shrimp were crispy, the sauce was sweet and had a great kick to it.  - Bacon wrapped scallops: These.....were a fail of grand proportions. I docked a star for it. My sister-in-law and I weren't quite sure what was wrong, but the sauce actually tasted moldy. Freaked me out, but the waiter promptly took them away and off the bill.  - Beet Salad with Goat Cheese: I love beets. It's a sick sick addiction, and this salad totally rocked my socks. The goat cheese was creamy and delicious, the beets were perfectly cooked, and the dressing was lick-the-plate good."}
{"text":"Reiterating my last review, Bonefish is a good addition to the north hills dining choices. It's a good, not great, seafood restaurant, with few notable positive characteristics, but also lacking in negatives. The building, menu, prices, service, and wine list are satisfactory, creating a good, safe everyday dining option. We're happy regulars."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for dinner tonight at 5 pm. They weren't that busy but the people in the front were confused and took their time seating us. Once we were seated we sat there for ten minutes and no one ever came to wait on us. My husband had to go find someone. Then our server finally came. Brittany was not apologetic for making us wait and tried to laugh off our ten minute wait.   We ordered our meal and it did come pretty fast. Then suddenly we were told Brittany wasn't our server anymore. I don't know what her name was but she was sure better than Brittany!   The food was good but the service was terrible."}
{"text":"Fabulous place!! The food was amazing, as well as the customer service. Our server was very nice and personable! Thanks so much for a marvelous experience, Bonefish!"}
{"text":"Ohhhh MAN!! I'm drooling just THINKING about this place... SO good!!!  My daughter and I were taken here by my cousin's, while we were visiting in Las Vegas. Those scallops with the bacon and burgundy sauce?? DO IT!!! I've never had scallops cooked to perfection before... seared perfectly on both sides, and then so insanely tender inside that they practically just melted in your mouth. CRAZY GOOD!! I can't even express to you how amazing they truly are... but if you like scallops, then do yourself a favor and order these!!  Everything everyone else had looked amazing too, and they all raved about it! The crabcakes were huge, with large chunks of crab (no skimping there!). The service was impeccable! Our cousin's go there often and ask to sit with their favorite server, who was so sweet and professional, while making us feel really appreciated as customers. It was just a really great experience all the way around!!"}
{"text":"I came here most recently for a staff holiday party of around 50 people so we had our own room and waitstaff of 4 people for 3 hours. We had a set menu that was served in a timely manner once our drink orders were taken. Of course it was loud, crowded, and a bit hectic. But the drinks, food, and attitude  of the staff was all very up to par. The food was hot, flavorful, and served in with a smile.  The time before was for a birthday party of about 10 people. We did have a reservation so that was helpful. Service was helpful with questions about the menu. Food was served all at once so no one in our party had to wait. Splitting the bill was easy and quick. This place can get packed: date night, happy hour, celebrations, etc. So be ready to get snuggly with the people at the table next to you.  Lots to choose from as far as: apps, soups, salads, tacos, fish, and desserts."}
{"text":"Wait staff very friendly and attentive.   Food was poor for the price.   Waited over an hour to be served Luke warm sea bass and lamb chop entrees.  And what is up with the spaghetti squash?   Did they have a sale at the farmers mkt?  It came out on all plates served even though not ordered (including those tables around us!). Dessert took another 20+ min and then another 5 for coffee.   Whipped cream on desserts was inedible-no sweetness at all.   First thought was they had mixed up whipped cream with butter or sour cream.  Very disappointing- will not be going back!"}
{"text":"Funny thing - now I know why I can't open my mailbox advertisement intercepts w/o running into a Bonefish grill Brunch coupon.  They are everywhere, I get 'em weekly.  So we finally went...and it was just meh.  Firstly I will say that NOTHING on the brunch menu appealed to me at. all.  So I went with my tried and true bang bang shrimp.  They were as expected, good.  For my side I got the Cesar salad.  Also decent, but nothing to write home about.  My dining companions that did get brunch items reported it was so/so to bad.    We had a party of 8, with a reservation, and though the dinning room was empty they had us pushed over into the corner.    So add up bad table arrangement + so so food you get a rating of 2 stars.  Based on my meal I probably would have given it a 3, but I got a little sick to my stomach after our meal.    Oh and one word - don't try the eggs.  They are rubbery and kinda faux egg-ish according to one girlfriend."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice in the past three months. Each visit was in the latter part of the evening. Despite there being a fifteen minute wait to be seated, the rest of each experience was wonderful.  The drinks are flavorful and strong, but the alcohol isn't overpowering. The food was piping hot and freshly made. The staff was professional and friendly.  The prices are moderate, but the experience is well worth every penny."}
{"text":"Good food, great service, and great drinks.  This is a nice change of pace from the usual Yard House stop in Town Square.  I'd come back again."}
{"text":"i had lily's chicken with goat cheese, spinach and steamed broccoli, it was amazing and the bang bang shrimp and it was yummmmy! the service was also amazing"}
{"text":"A lot of hype and crowded.  The menu looked promising but did not deliver.  We got the fish tacos, ceviche, and a few of the dirty martinis.  The only reason I didn't give one star is because the first martini was superb.  The food, although branded creatively, was bland and below average.  Don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"We (the gf and I) visited late afternoon on a weekend. We were seated promptly and our waiter noticed us quickly, none of that anxious waiting and sizing up the place with no waiters in sight. This was our first time visiting and he walked us through all of the usual first time queries most guests have.   While most items sounded great, we both stuck with more simple/light entrees as we still had a lot of running around to do. I opted for the blackened fish tacos with mango salsa and slaw and she picked fish and chips.  Our food took less than 10 minutes to arrive, which we were both appreciative over.  Now, I'm usually against blackened over deep fried fish tacos, BUT they were perfect. All of the elements of a great fish taco were represented: A touch of spice, a crunchy texture, and a fresh tortilla that holds up under the weight.   Her fish and chips, although simple, were executed nicely. The breading wasn't overbearing and the cod was flaky and fresh.  Overall we both left with a great first impression and will be returning to try more extravagant items soon. If you're a seafood lover definitely check this place out. The menu isn't huge but they do have a bit of everything represented moderately priced."}
{"text":"Just wanted to enjoy a couple apps and drinks. Will not be returning. Waited 10 min for service, flagged down manager to get drinks. Waiter finally arrived and ASSURED us we would now be taken care of. Not so much. Bang bang shrimp was great as usual, corn chowder wasn't warm enough and I sat there for 15 min with empty glass of wine. Totally depressed we blew $60 on a fat tire and average Malbec, when we could have gone somewhere else and had a great craft beer and an excellent wine"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and was not impressed by this place. The service was terrible and the food wasn't much better. I had the BFG tacos (steak, fish, chicken) and asked for the mango salsa on the side because I wasn't sure if I was going to like it. The food took a while to come out, and I noticed my salsa was not on the side. I reminded the waitress...15 minutes later I still didn't have it. My mom got up to go ask the hostess if she could fill our water glasses because those had been empty for a while. While she was up she asked if she could bring the salsa to the table also. The salsa did make the tacos taste a bit better. The two stars are for the fish sandwich that my mom had. She said she enjoyed it. I probably won't be back since I wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"We were at Bonefish Grill this past Saturday with some friends who recommended going there.  To our delight the staff was courteous, the owner was working and happy to see one of his patrons had invited us to his establishments.  The atmosphere was pleasant and the facility was clean.  The food was excellent!  My wife had the Salmon and I had the Trout, the vegetables were fresh and crispy.  I would recommend going here, but make reservations, this place is busy."}
{"text":"I love everything seafood so this restaurant is one of my favorite. I've been a regular here ever since I ordered their salmon. Location - I like how it's away from the busy area of the strip - always a plus.   For the love of all things good and holy, try the Wood-Grilled Atlantic Salmon with just the lemon butter sauce! It's just so simple but it's always spot on. In this case, less is more. I've had their spring special with the salmon dynamite style, I did not like it as much. I think the flavor was overwhelming that it overpowered the fish.   The service here is consistently excellent and the food is always fresh.   I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Summary: great food, good service, snug but eloquent atmosphere.  First, is the food - to start,  I ordered a Caesar salad.  It was excellent.  The dressing was perfect and the croutons were yummy.  There was seriously nothing left on my plate.  For my entree, I ordered the Bang Bang Shrimp Tacos.  This dinner item is under $10 and is definitely Bang Bang for your buck.  You also get to choose from a few sides.  I opted for the homemade chips.  They were very tasty but they didn't come with a dipping sauce so we requested a side of ranch.  Just the salad and the tacos filled me up - but of course, we munched on some amazing bread with a side of even better pesto & olive oil.  The waiter was patient (we had a group of 6) and knowledgeable about the menu and specials.  My only complaint was the timing between the salads/apps and our entrees.  My guess is close to a 25-30 minute wait.  About 20 minutes in, the waiter did come over and apologize and said that the kitchen got backed up.    We did have one birthday girl and she was given a small box of chocolate cookies to take with her.  It was a nice treat!  I'd definitely go back to Bonefish Grill and would recommend this restaurant to others who may not have tried it yet.  The locations can be somewhat inconvenient if you are in central Charlotte but I think it's worth a trip."}
{"text":"I've only had the chance to dine here once since they've opened.   We had a party of 4 and we all really enjoyed our meal here.   I had the Bang Bang Shrimp Po Boy and I would definitely order it again. It was the perfect size for a lunch or lite dinner.   Another family member had the Bang Bang Shrimp Tacos, she enjoyed them and said she'd order them again.  The other family member had Lily's Chicken Wrap, sadly she did not care for it and didn't eat much if any of it. The sauce which I believe was some Artichoke just didn't taste all that great.   The last person ordered a Chilean Sea Bass, he enjoyed it and shared some of it. It was my first time trying it and it was delicious!   Excellent service, nice atmosphere and very reasonably priced. It's a chain but it's a very nice place. I'd say leave the kids at home and enjoy a night out as adults."}
{"text":"The waitress was friendly, but got everyone's orders wrong. Each order was with the sauce on the side, but every order had sauce. The fish tacos were drenched in oil! I would never order the blackened fish tacos here!!! It was VERY disappointing!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place three stars because of it's value.  For the price, you really cannot beat it.  I ordered the scallops and shrimp with a side of jasmine rice - and when I come back, I'll order it again.  There aren't many places in Las Vegas that you can find scallops under $38.00, but this is one of them - and they are GOOD!    Service was great, I asked for sauce recommendations, and was not disappointed.  Our bill was a little more than Cheesecake factory, but a little less than Morton's.  So the price is definitely right!    I love the servers' uniforms.  Makes me feel like I'm in a restaurant along the pier of the Maine coast.  Worth a trip or two if you've never been!"}
{"text":"My parents, husband and children ate here on Father's Day. My mother and I had the scallops. Although a little on the salty side, they were delicious. They were tender with great flavor. The service was excellent. There was no extended wait to be seated, the server was attentive to the needs of our children, and the restrooms were really clean. We had a great evening."}
{"text":"I'm not typically a big fan of chain restaurant. But, Bonefish is a consistent great meal for a fair price. They have a great selection of cocktails, wine, and beer too. Service is always top notch!"}
{"text":"Our first experience and it was wonderful! Our server was very attentive and the food was perfectly cooked and hot. We were there to visit with some out of town family and we weren't made to feel as if we needed to rush. #Wewillbeback thank you for the great time"}
{"text":"El stinko! They had my favorite wine by the glass. Tasted like it had been open too long. No water brought to table. Had bread with no napkins....waited over an hour for a table in the bar. Waitress not familiar with the menu. Out of Mahi Mahi. Ordered shrimp and scallops...came cold on a warm plate minus the side. Sent it back and it took another 20 minutes to get it. They brought the spaghetti squash on the side and it was still steaming from the microwave. Manager bought us a round of drinks. I've been to Bonefish in Florida. VERY different experience here. I'll give them a couple of months to figure it out and then 1 more try. Bummer that I wasted my gift card here:("}
{"text":"Was one of the lucky ones that got to eat here during their Training prior to the official Grand Opening.  Staff was very attentive and knew the menu.  My husband has some food allergies so always curious about what is in sauces, etc.  Staff was able to answer questions and offered samples of the sauces so that my husband would enjoy his meal.  Servings were well portioned.  The Bang Bang Shrimp and Pecan-crusted Rainbow Trout were well done and flavorful.  We both fell in love with the white truffle Mac and Cheese!  Glad to see a mid price seafood restaurant move back into the area.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"This review would normally be a waste of time. This is a chain that is very well run and managed around the country. So, I know they do not rely on this kind of review.  However, I think the managers/owners should know just how good this team was.  As you can tell by my opening statement, I am already a fan of Bonefish.  I ordered two of my favorites, the Bang Bang Shrimp appetizer, and the sesame-encrusted seared tuna  (in the appetizer section, but a large portion is offered, and this is commonly my meal).  The shrimp was spectacular as always.  However, when the tuna arrived (my coworker ordered the same thing because I recommend it) it was not seared. It was cooked through.  Not my favorite thing, but clearly edible.  My dinner-mate was disappointed too, and so I asked the server if they could have another version done. I hated to be a pain, but still...I like it seared - not cooked!  She was polite, and tried to help, but they were out. It wasn't the end of the world, but it wasn't the best we have had either.  Well, after the check came, the server had mentioned to the manager. She comped both Tuna entrees, which was very nice, and again it was edible, so we all made out okay. I'll for sure go back and order the same meal again. I know it will be just great."}
{"text":"Service was terrible and slow for an early sitting at 5 pm. Food was blah. Took 1.5 hours to eat."}
{"text":"We had a great waiter, his name was Joe B. He was informative, funny and always available. Service was top notch!   I had the Sea bass, it was buttery, fresh and had that wonderful wood grill taste. My hubby had the Halibut. It was terrific as well.  The lemon quinoa is so good!   Also had the nonalcoholic blackberry elixir  drink and loved it! You can get it with Malibu rum if you like."}
{"text":"Very disappointed this time around. My family and I come here twice a year since this is centrally located for our relatives.  The service was extremely SLOW. We did not get water until after 20 mins of being seated, then after we placed our order, our menus were left at the table.  Our server was dragging his feet and roaming around the restaurant just chatting. We were out of water and didn't get refilled until we asked. The plates and utensils were all sticky. I was still eating my food and he offered to give me a box. I am extremely disappointed because we love this place. I believe management has changed since our last visit and it seems that this new person is allowing everything to spiral downhill."}
{"text":"Luv, Luv, Luv the Pear Martinis! Wish they were on menu year round! Thanks, Wendell for ALWAYS ensuring the service is top notch!!"}
{"text":"It's a close spot from our apartment we just went there for lunch loved the bang bang shrimp po boy I believe thats what it was called it tasted awesome! I could go back a thousand times just for that! They also have some good bread that they serve while you're waiting to order!"}
{"text":"A favorite place to have Brunch I ordered a new item filet mignon and lobster eggs Benedict with potatoes.  An excellent dish with one issue. I was not asked how I wanted my filet done (medium rare) unfortunately the filet was over well done and barely chewable. The lobster side was perfect. As usual the wait staff was impeccable. They lost a star on the tough beef but certainly deserved the other stars."}
{"text":"We went here last week excited to try a new restaurant in the neighborhood, especially as we are foodies and this place just opened. We showed up surprised we had to wait, but expected we could grab a drink while waiting. Unfortunately, the wait was 50 minutes and the bar was crowded, leaving no room to grab a quick drink. After consideration, we decided to try and wait it out. We eventually grabbed opening seats at the bar and received good service and the best dirty martini I've had in a while. Unfortunately, that was the best service and order of the night. Upon seating, we were not offered water or specials. Our waitress, who was clearly not well versed with the menu, took our order, but did not ask for common sides/sauces shown on menu; however other servers did. When the food arrived, we were disappointed. The fillet that was ordered (6 oz) was large yet unsatisfactory, especially as the sauce that was requested was absent. The pork was also unsatisfactory, it was dry, bland, and left much to be desired. The couscous side, was highly welcomed, although it was the same color as the plate, the very large plate with much room left to fit other veggies or food. A smaller plate could have been utilized more efficiently. Presentation was lacking. Overall, we were disappointed. We will not be back, unless it's just for the martini."}
{"text":"Bang Bang Shrimp: Crispy fried shrimp tossed in a spicy cream sauce on top a bed of lettuce. The shrimp was piping hot when it arrived, but it was very flavorful. I would find myself eating some lettuce to cool down my mouth after each bite of shrimp. I didn't taste any spice, but the dish was still good.  Grilled Lamb Chops: Wood-grilled seasoned chops in a balsamic demi-glace sauce. Served with a steamed broccoli and green beans. My girlfriend ordered this medium-rare but it came out well done. As she expected, the meat was a little dry which was upsetting. This would have been a great dish if the meat was more tender and juicy because the flavor was definitely there.  Grilled Rainbow Trout: Wood-grilled and served oscar style. I absolutely enjoyed this dish. The fish was seasoned well and had great flavor. I was caught off-guard by the tiny lumps of crab meat but the béarnaise sauce was excellent. The asparagus was cooked perfectly for my taste. It was tender but also had a good crunch to it. The garlic mashed potatoes was probably my favorite of the two sides. The white truffle mac & cheese was good, but not great. I still enjoyed it though.  Can't wait till the next time we go back."}
{"text":"Excellent! It was very busy but sat at the bar, which had happy hour on Saturday!! Service was excellent and the staff was very friendly. The waitress was very knowledgeable on the menu and was very helpful. It's always nice to have another great seafood spot in the area"}
{"text":"Arrived and promptly greeted at the desk and was handed a pager with 20 minute wait time. After 25 minutes we're we're 5th in line and told 7-8 minutes. After another 20 minutes were 4th in line and told 11 more minutes. I have an idea... how about be honest with your customers and not try to hold them and waste their time. Get your act together Concord Bonefish. :("}
{"text":"With all the hype about the new Friday night fish fry we were looking forward to try it. I have never been there on a Friday night and it was nothing like our previous visits. Packed with customers with standing room only. Luckily we had a reservation and got seated at the reserved time. Our server was excellent but the staff that actually brought the food to the table is another group that apparently just does that. I asked them for more cocktail sauce and another person at my table asked for the forgotten bacon bits on here wedge salad. They said they would get it but never brought it and we never saw them again. Our waitress did appear and immediately got the two things. The fish fry was a big disappointment. There was cod, which was ok, and shrimp and scallops that were absolutely tasteless. The coleslaw that comes with it was the size of a shot glass, once and a half oz maybe and typical. Would have like more. The fries were average. The usual fish dinners here are very good and I was surprised at how bland and boring this fish fry was. Would not come back for it and would avoid Friday night as well."}
{"text":"When I traveled for work if there was a Bonefish I would always eat there one time...mostly dinner but sometimes Brunch/Lunch. I was always impressed with the consistency from location to location. To date I have eaten at twenty four different locations.  We stopped at the Concord Mills location for lunch. The server was great and the Fish Tacos were good. My wife ordered the Crab and Asparagus Omelette for $10.95.  This was an Omelette that I could have done better at home. Big and Fluffy Omelette? No, Small and Flat yes! This was an amateurish attempt. When we opened the Omelette, two eggs, there were three, maybe four, Asparagus Spears laid beside each other on top on melted White Cheese. The CRAB consisted of three little pieces, inconspicuously laid, on top on the Omelette. The Toast consisted of One Slice, cut in half, with a blob of Melted Butter (?) in the middle of each half. The Jelly, Jam, Marmalade were NONEXISTENT! After alerting our server with our dissatisfaction with the Omelette, he took it off. A very nice gesture on his part but no member of Management came by to apologize.   Guess we'll be eating LOCAL when it comes to Fish."}
{"text":"While I've eaten at other Bonefish locations, this was my first visit here, and my first visit as a food allergy sufferer.  I have to say that hands down, this is the best restaurant I've visited since being diagnosed with a severe food allergy.  Our server, Michael, was awesome and extremely knowledgeable about the menu and allergens.  The food was fairly priced for comparable restaurants and it tasted wonderful.  I ordered the salad, salmon, and a mojito, all of which were very tasty.  We will be definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Denise the waiter, is by far the best waitress in Nevada. She took great care of us and the bottomless mimosas were a great deal."}
{"text":"I struggled picking between 2 and 3 stars.  I went with 2 because I wouldn't recommend someone go eat here. However, in a pinch if you are in the area and want to stop in, the food is edible. Everything was alright but not good.  It is overpriced and the tuna I had was mediocre.  My wife's shrimp tacos were alright.  In summary this place is just alright and I doubt I'll ever go back."}
{"text":"Came here a few weeks back and had a great experience. Me and my gf had the bacon wrapped scallops, ceviche, ahi tuna, the salmon dish, a flourless brownie dessert, creme brûlée, and the mini churro things. All the food was excellent. Our food was brought out by the manager BRUCE. He was super nice and gave us great customer service, as well as others throughout the whole night.  He made our experience so much better with his great attitude. Thanks Bruce and the rest of the staff. I would def come here again"}
{"text":"The Curse of Chain Restaurants ...it's cooking by the numbers, can't escape it. Cooks following mandated recipes instead of chefs offering their own version, showing with pride what they can do.   A house salad on the side: good deal, good size, great ingredients  but the dressing falls completely flat.   Grilled scallops and shrimp - what was it, only 4 of each?- plump meat, nice and firm not overcooked by much but way too charred. I like charcoal but here it overpowered the seafood. A pity really. The mango sauce, what can I say I don't know what they were going for and I suspect neither did the cook. Don't remember the side veggies.  Meh, definitely meh.   Plus the place was hectic so I chose to smile and say nothing. Not bad, not great, not cheap."}
{"text":"Bar drinks were good and strong.  Shrimp appetizer was outstanding. Sea bass with mango sauce was greatest.  And good service too.  First time there and wont be my last."}
{"text":"A Birthday Celebration brought us to Bonefish. The birthday girls favorite restaurant.  Although never seeing a Manager during our dinner, I have to say the food was great, prepared to everyone's liking. Quick and friendly service. We started our dinner with the amazing crispy, fried, spicy Bang Bang Shrimp!!, as an add on to our dinner.  I would love to have the recipe to make this at home! We also shared the Crab Cakes, delicious! We all chose the Hooked on Tues Specials. Salad, entree and dessert. The birthday girl had the Salmon dinner, I had the Ahi Tuna and her father had the Shrimp & Scallops. I chose the Ceaser Salad. It was good, but lacking in dressing. I really enjoyed the medium well Tuna, it was prepared perfectly. Everyone had the Potatoes, excellent choice. Dessert was Cheesecake with both butterscotch and chocolate sauce, very good !!! I belong to the email subscription. I have not yet joined the rewards program. We do go to Bonefish or Out Back Steak House enough to join. We gave her the points to her rewards account to get one more visit for a dinner reward.  I may consider it. We will return."}
{"text":"Few places deserve the sixth star award, but this location of Bonefish is one of those locations.  I started with an order of Bang Bang shrimp which was incredibly GOOD. I do have one problem with them though, for some reason, probably because of my speed and precision in eating them, they disappeared way too fast, compelling me to order a second order of them.  YES, I know, that was greedy of me, but, If I don't treat me good sometimes, who will, LOL.  I must try the coconut shrimp next time.  I indulged in a Fontana pork chop, deeply covered in with Fontina cheese, garlic, prosciutto & mushroom marsala wine sauce, so says the menus, and it is delicious. While I tend to watch my pork intake, I can only say that I watched this as it disappeared from the plate and nearly licked the plate clean, it was some kinda good.  Thinking of scheduling myself back here next week, its been to long off my schedule..."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I dined here last night and had a fairly decent time. We sat down knowing that we couldn't have a 2-hr dining experience (time crunch)! Nonetheless, our waiter wasn't the best I've ever had. He wasn't rude, just really forgetful! There's only so long you can go without having any water while eating bang bang shrimp...   I'm not a stickler most of the time at restaurants but we were a forgotten table which actually made our meal less pleasing!"}
{"text":"This is quickly becoming a favorite of mine, as well as of my husband's. I don't think I have anything bad to say about this place!   We generally like to make reservations because this place can get very busy. Even on Wednesday nights, when we like to go for the Bang Bang Shrimp appetizer. Try it, you won't be disappointed! I went a week ago for my birthday and everything came out amazing. I had the fish tacos, so good, and pineapple martinis, which were better than I expected.   The noise level is a bit loud because the tables are pretty close to each other, so it's a bit difficult to have a super romantic meal there, but the food makes it worth it!"}
{"text":"Pretty busy Friday night, we had a reservation and were seated in just a few minutes.  The waiter was excellent (Danny), his knowledge of the menu was very good, his suggestions were spot on.  Staff was friendly and attentive throughout the meal without being bothersome.  The Bang Bang Shrimp was a good starter, the Fresh Apple and Espresso Martinis were delicious.  The salmon was moist and well seasoned, the Sea Scallops & Shrimp were cooked perfectly and we enjoyed both. The Mango Salsa and Chimichurri Sauce were great compliments to the seafood. Topped it off with a piece of Key Lime Pie, loved the graham cracker crust with pecans.  Looking forward to brunch there soon, the menu looks great."}
{"text":"We had dinner here on Tuesday and the food was absolutely delicious! When I arrived before the others, I was seated without having to wait for the rest of the party.  Our server, Jake, was amazing!  He greeted me as soon as I was settled and took my much needed drink order! He also was quick to greet the rest of our party as soon as they were seated.   He made great suggestions, was attentive and so personable! Please ask to be seated with him when you arrive-You WILL NOT regret it!!! We had the Imperial Dip to start off our evening with our drinks and it was so warm and gooey and had tons of seafood in it. The chips that came with it were warm and crisp as well. Each of our party of 3 had a different dish (all from the \"Specials\" menu) and everything was wonderful.  The fish was fresh and expertly cooked and delivered to us hot and plated beautifully.(Be sure to order the Mac &  Cheese.  There is an upcharge but the portion is HUGE and 2 can share it easily.  I am undeniably a sucker for a good Mac & Cheese and this was one of the best I have had! So order it-you won't be sorry!  Needless to say, we had to have leftovers boxed to bring home because the portions were so large.   My husband just ate cobia/salmon/Imperial Dip and Chips/Mac and cheese/sauteed spinach for dinner tonight.  It all reheated and tasted as fresh as it was originally cooked! Before we left, the manager, (Ryan, I believe) came over and made sure everything was good and also gave us coupons for Bang Bang Shrimp Apps next time we come in for dinner.   This was my first experience having a meal at Bonefish Grill and now I am wondering why it has taken me so long to go! Will definitely return...and ask for Jake of course!"}
{"text":"I drive by Bonefish every single day on my way to school and up until last week had never given it a shot - partially because it is a bit pricey and somewhat because my wife is rarely willing to stomach seafood. Luckily for me, I got to try Bonefish on someone else's dime without any restrictions on price or type of food.   Let me first say that I am an infrequent seafood eater but when I do take a fishy night on the town, I tend to go to more expensive places since fish is something that when it sucks, it sucks really bad. I also prefer the less \"fishy\" fish like salmon, tilapia, lobster, etc.   Now that my disclaimer is out of the way, I left Bonefish feeling totally indifferent. The ambiance was okay. The food was okay. The service was okay. And the price was reasonable for what I got. Blown away? Absolutely not. But I left satisfied and satiated.  My order consisted of the Salmon ($19 or so) with a Pan Asian sauce, Au Gratin Potatoes, and their seasonal veggies. I never ordered an appetizer because the bread and oil they gave ahead of the meal was sufficient (actually the oil and pesto were fantastic - best part of the meal). The salmon filet was a healthy size and was good overall. It was cooked well but the Pan Asian sauce seemed a little over-powering and took away from what would have been a well-prepared fish. The Au Gratin potatoes were actually extremely good and had the right texture and taste balance. The veggies were terrible - poorly cooked (slightly raw) and under-seasoned.  One might ask why, with no price boundaries I would go for Salmon rather than the Chilean sea bass or Lobster tail. Well, first of all, because I'm not a douche. Secondly, I think Salmon is a staple that should be done right by any place that considers themselves a seafood restaurant. It's the measurement standard. That's why I chose it. Second visits are for deviation - at least that's how I justified my frugal choice afterward.  Overall, I think seafood fans who prefer the safety of chain restaurants will be satisfied but not doing cartwheels. True fish-faces will probably cringe at what they served... but luckily, that isn't me. I'd be happy to go back on someone else's dollar."}
{"text":"I first tried this place in Orlando, FL and it was really good, so I wanted to try this place again and I brought my dad here for his birthday. I have to say I was not impressed this time around. It was pretty dead, I got the seabass like last time, however it wasn't as good as the first time. I got it with a lemon butter seasoning and I have to say it was drenched in butter sauce Overload. My Veggies were seasonal so it came with butternut squash and It was horrible!! The plating was like a buffet style, just slapped on the plate and I paid $20 for this dish. I was not impressed. I think the only thing I liked here was my bread that they give you. My blackberry drink sucked. Service was ok. I will not return"}
{"text":"\"I'll have an order of Bang Bang Shrimp with a side of discrimination\". Might as well have said that; both were served in generous portions.  I loathe writing negative reviews. Some yelpers' profiles are filled with 1 & 2 star reviews and one cannot help but wonder if they enjoy slamming businesses. Sure, I've had bad experiences. Most of the time I have no desire to revisit the details in narrative so post no review at all. Other times, I try to find some justification for pushing the review to at least 3 stars. Here was a rare time I struggled to push a review to TWO stars. I waited 48hrs to see if I'd feel different. I don't. I also detest long reviews. You've been warned.  After a rigorous workout, I was enroute home deciding what protein I'd eat & realized I could finally try the Bang Bang shrimp at Bonefish Grill. I'd heard it was $6 on Wed and was less than a mile away. I'd drove pass it for years and always admired the architecture. Upon arrival, the first oddity was the front door. For such a grand façade, the entrance door is single and calls to mind a tiny take-out place. I stood back for a moment, thinking perhaps this wasn't the main entrance, but it was. Hmm.  I walked in and was taken aback. It was shockingly dark. Like 'power outage' dark (minimal lighting).  The interior was in direct contrast with the exterior. The restaurant seems to be in an identity crisis. Attractively modern on the outside, barn-like on the inside.  I looked around to see if there was a better area to be seated, as my body ached and I just wanted to relax. No dice. All equally dismal. Would order to-go.   No one was at the front when I entered. It was 30min past opening and 3 tables were seated.  A young woman arrived within moments, greeted me, and answered questions about choices. 2 separate customers arrived to pick up orders. Each time, the manager came out, handed them the orders, thanked them, smiled & advised them that bread & pesto were in the bag. I was excited; I didn't realize bread & pesto were included in to-go orders. I make pesto at home and LOVE fresh bread. The woman at the counter asked him to help describe the kobe burger to me, which he did with satisfaction then left. I decided on the Bang Bang Shrimp.  I sat for a while in the waiting area, but the gloomy ambiance overwhelmed, so I stood looking out the window in meditative calm. I was bundled up, since it was chilly outside and my pores were still open from the routine. I heard a voice behind me say \"here's your order\", and smiling, I turned around, only to see her abruptly pause, pull the order slightly back & ask in a distinctly accusing tone \"did you pay already?\". (WHAT? Wait...WHAT? Ok...I'm sorry...WHAT?) The look in her eyes, her body language, just horrible.  Here I was, in this antebellum-like establishment, and despite the previous 2 pick-ups being hand delivered their orders personally by the manager directly from the kitchen, NEITHER WERE ASKED IF THEY'D ALREADY PAID. (The first put you in the mind of Joe Biden, the second, Jennifer Aniston.) They had both also ordered Bang Bang shrimp. It is a small reception area. The attendants who rang me up were right there! Zero excuse. Were I an indignant snob, I'd responded that 'yes, I paid with a card you may never qualify for'. But I am not. I stood incredulously.  It didn't end there.  No bread or pesto.  Nauseated with disgust but civil, I mentioned to the young woman I'd first spoke with and another young man who'd just shown up that I observed the last 2 pickups receiving fresh bread & pesto in their orders, and questioned why mine lacked. I imagined -hell, I HOPED- they would say it was because those orders were for more than 2 entrées or something, which would have been acceptable. (Still trying to put a positive spin on things. Still giving benefit of doubt.) They looked at each other, shrugged, and said they didn't know, saying it should have been included. I was done at that point. DONE.  You would think the manager himself would then have brought the missing items out, offering up some corporate style regret right? Nothing. No damage control or conciliatory effort from management. The young man brought the items and apologized.  The delivered missing items didn't erase the stain of the experience.   The shrimp was glorious; the portion was huge. The bread tasted fresh baked. The pesto wasn't pesto; it was oil with a pitch of pesto in it.   Business is a team effort. It pains me when those who put forth A+ effort suffer due to the recklessness of teammates. Why should the cooks not be celebrated? That bigoted young woman is a liability; those cooks are an asset. Only reason ANY stars were justified is them. Shame. Won't return."}
{"text":"This restaurant was outstanding from the exceptional waiter who was very attentive and supportive throughout our meal but the food was great also would come back again and again and for me to give it 5 stars I know what that means it was over the top loved it Oh and by the way they dropped my food in my lap and I didn't even get upset we had fun"}
{"text":"This is a nice place to go if you are craving fish hence the name lol. The food is pretty good. There was a huge line to when we got there but if you don't mind sitting at a community table by the bar the wait is a lot shorter and you can still order off of the whole menu which was great because we were in and out of there before some of the people who waited in the line."}
{"text":"We decided to venture out to the shops at Town Square where this Bonefish Grill is located. Our visit was during brunch hours and I would say about third of the dining room was filled. Drink orders took 15 minutes to arrive at the table. The server acknowledged and apologized that the bar was backed up. Then our food arrived immediately after. We were planning to have a second round of drinks but the slow service just kept us from placing any additional drink orders and the fact the food had already arrived and we were not going to chug down our drinks that fast. The Chilean Sea Bass Oscar Style was one of the best I have had. It tasted fresh and flavored very well. The potatoes au gratin were too cheesy for my taste. The California Omelet was average and did not stand out. I think the slow service at the start put a damper on our brunch outing and the attitude of the server rubbed off on us too, you know the one that reads, I don't want to be here."}
{"text":"Four words: freezer burn tuna sashimi.  Generally this is a great place. Adequate staffing needs, friendly, knowledgeable staff. One bad meal can change the way you look at things."}
{"text":"Food quality not up to par with prices.  They use the smallest shrimp on the planet for their bang bang, terrible texture. Wanted my kobe beef burger medium but it came out well done and dry as dust. No reason whatsoever to go here to eat."}
{"text":"We were lounging around town, up to our usual hijinks, which usually include food, golf and spas, and we found the new Bonefish Grill, located in Town Square.  Ample parking lot that was nearly chock full led the way through the revolving door to the nature vibe decor of the grill.  We sat at a large raised table and were just in time for the Happy Hour specials.  We chose the Fish Tacos and Bang Bang shrimp tacos, along with a very respectable Margarita and a large lemonade.  The servings were flavorful and generous, and the service attentive and friendly.  The atmosphere was cooling and relaxing, the 115 degree Vegas heat outside melted away, as we enjoyed their mellow atmosphere."}
{"text":"Food was wonderful.  Bang bang shrimp was is a must, steaks were cooked perfect.  Service was very slow as they were accommodating a large birthday party."}
{"text":"Made reservations and when we arrived we sat right away. We ordered the bang bang shrimp and it was good as always. I have been here several times. I ordered the crusted fish and when my meal arrived it came with the wrong side dish but it was replaced with the right one free of charge. Service was great, our meals just did not seem as good as we thought they did in the past. Even with saying that we will be back again. A bit on the pricey side."}
{"text":"Service was slow. I've eaten here a few times plus at other locations. The bang bang shrimp are always spot on. Now that this location is open for lunch I wanted to stop during  my lunch hour. Not that many people in the restaurant for the service to be this slow. The server was very good and helpful.   Ate the bang bang shrimp po boy with the couscous salad. Sandwich was crispy and spicy. Very yummy."}
{"text":"Great Gluten Free options. Chilean Sea Bass with lime tomato garlic sauce was excellent ordered larger portion and enjoyed every bite along with my garlic mashed and broccoli sides. The filet mignon was tender and juicy. Gluten free tilapia with lemon butter on the side- didn't even need side sauce as the grill flavor made the entree. Another entree was tilapia and lime tomato garlic sauce with green beans and scalloped potatoes -plate was cleaned."}
{"text":"Been here many times and always enjoy my food! My service today was terrible we were the first table today party of 7 for birthday brunch our server was not attentive and I was constantly asking other servers for drinks and other items. I let the manager know at the end of our meal while waiting 20 mins for our check about our experience and she did nothing said I'm so sorry I'll talk to the server. Then to top it off we made it stupid proof with one bill for 7 people wrote down the last 4 digits of the cards and amounts had 2 gifts cards and cash. Our server did not bring back a receipt and to the left over cash as a tip! You always bring the cash back and let us leave the tip!!! That's was ridiculous I had to ask for a receipt and although our service was terrible most of the party works in the serving industry and would have tipped 20% percent but since she helped herself to 19.00 on a 170.00 check we didn't feel the need to leave any more. I felt like at the very least the manager could've comped the desert since it was a birthday brunch. We told the server before hand and let her know she wanted the donuts. Her desert came out no candle no one sang overall a terrible experience and I will not be dining here anymore. By the managers response my service is not needed."}
{"text":"We went here for a MS event, the a/c was broken, the food was late, staff did not keep up with drinks.  I would not come back"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner, and had to get the check right away after we ate because i started having stomachache, I had the tilapia imperial and there was nothing \"imperial\" about that tilapia. I agree with the other yelpers bout the food quality, for what they charge, I would have opt for fast food instead. WE WILL NOT BE BACK!"}
{"text":"6pm on a Friday and they were already out of the Artic Char special. I asked if I could order the Sea Bass but with the summer pasta side that came with the Artic Char special. Annie, our server said they could do that. When our bill arrived there was a $5 up charge for the summer pasta (which is not listed on the regular menu). I asked about this to which Annie replied that it was a \"special\" side, thus the extra charge. I pointed out that the sea bass cost more than the Artic Char special and they ran out and that I thought it was crappy that they would charge me the extra $5, and without telling me up front. She took the check but did not remove the charge. I will NOT be going back."}
{"text":"Where do I start, the terrible service or the processed food on the menu? I thought Bone Fish had grown up when I saw they were now serving Numi organic teas. And the chef jackets being donned by the waitstaff suggest they are experts of what's on the menu.. Don't believe the hype chile. Our server knew nothing about the food and she was very slow. It was like watching paint dry. The food is processed (for short cuts) because the kitchen obviously isn't trained to actually cook  food. The atmosphere was so nice that it is such  a shame that the other moving parts did not work well together. It's a chain so hit or miss."}
{"text":"I came here with a fellow yelper as she (Grace L.) told me that it was worth it. And surprisingly, she couldn't believe that I haven't came before. This place is located right next to the Guitar Center, right on Independence Blvd.   Anyways, lets get to the exciting part: the food. As I just ate at 2:00 and then came here at 5, I was thinking I wasn't going to eat that much. But seeing the menu I had to try out their Kobe Beef burger. Grace's hubby decided to just get appetizers so I had my fair share of their different types of appetizers.  We ordered the restaurant favorite: Bang Bang Shrimp, Crab Cakes, and the fried Calamari. Lets go through them.  Bang Bang Shrimp: Not bad. This I thought was actually the worse appetizer compared to the other 2. The problem of this appetizer was that there was just no flavor to it. It was just fried shrimp, with some kind of sauce and had a hint of spice to it. Almost like they sprinkled it with black pepper and that was it. The sauce, was just bland. Plain and simple. My friend told me that it was usually better than this time, but I guess I'll just have to find out next time.  Crab Cakes: I thought these were delicious. Even though crab cakes are usually pricey and usually no one gets them I thought they were very full and had a good amount of crab in them. The flavor I thought was better than the shrimp. It came with a sauce that went pretty well with it.  Fried Calimari: Not bad. Well, calimari was calimari, nothing crazy special. It came with an Asian sweet dipping sauce, sort of like a sweet and sour sauce, and that was about it. All fried calimari preparations taste the same this way, the only place that I like the calimari prepared is the one they make at Saigon Palace on South Blvd.  Kobe Beef Burger: I sort of killed this dish, just because I thought it was the dish of the night for me. It was big and full of flavor. The beef had a sort of sweetness to it and was very tender when I bit into it. So, yes. I recommend to try this dish. (And I know, it's a fish grill and I didn't order fish...but that means I have something to try next time!)  So. Why 3 stars? The price I felt didn't justify the means. I think they're going for a sort of high/medium class of food and service. But the location and menu just didnt seem like it. It's part of a department store, not an independent kind of store. The service wasn't bad and I thought if I give a 3, I have a chance to come back to it and give it another go at it."}
{"text":"I'd put a 4.5 star rating if it was available.  The knocked off half star would be because out of 5 visits or more, one time the pecan crusted trout came out under cooked and bland. I did arrive a bit late and I believe the kitchen was trying to close. I don't feel like a 945pm arrival time for 1030pm closing is that bad. maybe they were trying to close early due to a slow turn out.  Every item I've had here is yummy. Yesterday I came here and got the $36 alaskan king crab legs. They were very yummy (not the best I've had, but a damn steal for that price!)  The ambiance is great for a date.  Some wet naps would of been really nice after the crab legs, but oh well, i don't knock off points there.  I love the arnold palmer. I think the lemonade is their restaurant recipe, and it really gives a great after taste with the arnold palmer."}
{"text":"Attentive service, menu is more diverse than I expected, and prices are reasonable. It's always crowded so call ahead or be prepared to wait. They offer small bites and drink service for guests waiting for a table."}
{"text":"I will start by saying the wait staff was polite, friendly and very attentive. But I didn't come to the Bone Fish Grille to sample the wait staff. The crab cakes were more like crab mashed potatoes, bacon wrapped scallops were tasty but somewhat \"rubbery\" (cooked too long)  We also tried the petite sirloin and a skewer of shrimp which was just okay (nothing to rave about) also ordered the Mac & cheese but got sauteed spinach. (They were out of Mac & cheese)  Not enough to bring me back for a second visit."}
{"text":"Was super excited to go, since everyone said it was so good. Mediocre food, high prices and terrible TERRIBLE service. Never again."}
{"text":"Came in for 5$ martinis and an appetizer- the bar was the only part of the restaurant with patrons, and the bartender was too busy to give good service (or socializing with a table of cut servers...). They cut a second bartender as we were walking in, and we would have gotten much better service had they stayed. Drink glasses sat empty, dirty dishes in front of everyone around us, and we had to ask for food by getting their attention, whereas normally someone would check in when menus are on the bar to see if we'd like anything. Martini glasses were dirty with water spots and gunk. Ordered calamari, and it was FAR from the quality we are accustomed to. Over seasoned, smaller pieces- disappointing overall for an 11$ dish. With so many options in Vegas, it seems bonefish will no longer be an obvious \"go-to\" in town. Two stars because it generally meets expectations for brand standard. Food and poor management were the issue. Someone should have stepped in and helped the bartender. We would have spent more money with better service, and had anyone asked how everything was while we were there, we could have communicated the issues before leaving."}
{"text":"This was an amazing experience!!! My server Barry was amazing!!! The GSA Antonio was so awesome!! They made my mother's birthday so special!! I will definitely be returning to THIS Bonefish!!"}
{"text":"This place is great for seafood lovers, and those that want a little \"surf and turf\" (upgraded, of course) offerings.  I was happy to have this dining experience return after leaving the Henderson area a few years back.  Now with a new, easy-access location, and in the trendy Town Square area, Bonefish should please all that want to experience everything they have to offer.  You won't be disappointed with the diverse list of appetizers including their famous Bang Bang Shrimp with just the perfect amount of \"kick.\" Adult beverages are unique as well, with their Pineapple Martini being brought to my table many times throughout the evening.  If you order an entre, you're given a delicious bread plate that features a parmesan cheese bread with oil and fresh pesto...try not to fill up on this as you still need to make room for such items as jumbo sea scallops and shrimp with lemon butter, Chilean Sea Bass, chicken breast with goat cheese and sautéed spinach or their steak and Maryland Style Crab cakes.  Bonefish Grill does not feel like a chain restaurant. The decor provides a stylish setting that is both comfortable and open. The dining room is spacious and there is a large bar area with community tables."}
{"text":"This is my second visit within six months and both visits included great food with awful service.  There is an incredibly long wait time to for the server to take the order, to get the food, and to get the bill.  The staff seem disinterested and borderline rude.  I will be back because the food is good, but they really need to work on customer service."}
{"text":"Terrible service.  This is my 3rd time each time worse.  25 minute for 3 salads.?  One salad dish...Ice cold!!!! However, food is good....They did pick up the tab.  Hopefully they can learn from their mistake"}
{"text":"Been to several Bonefish Grills around the country and this one does not disappoint!  We were able to sit outside, which was lovely.  The service was excellent -- prompt, polite, they kept our water glasses filled, and didn't push dessert/coffee or expensive drinks.    We had the bang bang shrimp (generously portioned and perfectly spicy), salmon with bacon jam butter (AMAZING) and swordfish with pumpkin ravioli.  They are now offering a new side of herbed couscous, which was cooked perfectly and very flavorful.    It is located in a lovely shopping area.  There's a movie theater and lots of shops in the area.    Overall a really great dining experience!"}
{"text":"Omg I was not disappointed one bit - the bang bang shrimp was so yummy I could have ordered more and then I had the pineapple glazed shrimp with coconut risotto while my better half had the Parmesan rainbow trout - every bite was delicious and the drinks too - excellent service as well!!"}
{"text":"I AM SO FULL!  Bang bang Shrimp was $6 tonight and it was my favorite part of the meal.  My husband had a seafood dish with green beans and truffled mac n cheese. My son had sirloin and potatoes. I took his salad with yummy house dressing and had another appetizer.  Server was very kind and atmosphere was perfect for town square. Just missed $5 happy hour. Maybe next time!"}
{"text":"My significant other and I wanted a nice dinner after a work trip. He got the tilapia and I got the lobster stuffed shrimp. The mixed drinks were nicely made, rather strong too! The mashed potatoes were amazing and the asparagus was the biggest I've ever seen. I was let down by the \"lobster\" stuffed shrimp because honestly I didn't see or taste the lobster. There was shrimp stuffing my shrimp actually, either way my boyfriend loved his meal and said the tilapia was cooked perfect. (That never happens)  I'd return,  but I'd probably skip on the same meal I got.  Btw.... make a reservation, I went on a Wednesday night and it was a half hour wait for the other people."}
{"text":"My fiance and I go to the Matthews, Bonefish often as their food is outstanding and never have a complaint. The only reason we want to write this review is to make sure the manager that night, Julie, gets credit for being amazing. About a week ago we went to Bonefish and unfortunately the service was not up to par at all. I told my fiancee we were sitting at the invisible table. We didn't ask for a manager because we know every night is not perfect. The waitress must have known that we were not happy with our service and our food. We didn't ask for a manager but the waitress sent the manager our way. I have had poor service at other restaurants and the manager may come over say I'm sorry and discount your food and go about their way. Julie had exceeded our expectations. She was so friendly and apologetic and she was so concerned with how we were treated and wanted to make sure we received the service that we always come to expect. It was like we were talking to a good friend. Kudos to you!"}
{"text":"The food was just so-so. Nothing special. Their sister company, Carrabbas is way better.   My bf tried their Arctic Chill (Salmon, Crab Meat, Spinach, Sautéed Vegetables). He said it was good but nothing special. I had the Grilled Chilean Sea Bass with Sautéed Vegetables and Mashed Potatoes with a side of Mango Salsa. It was also okay. It's not something I will be thinking about again to order. Plus their plate presentation was messy. The plates were small and it looks like they dumped all the stuff on that small plate.   Maybe we will come back probably if Texas De Brazil is full and there's a 40-minute wait like what happened on this visit."}
{"text":"Compared with the one I visited in Orlando this was an epic disappointment...if only I could give it no stars I would .... One of the busiest travel and shopping days and it was nearly empty for lunch, this should have tipped me off....service was slow , portion sizes a joke, side plate was dirty. My wife's entree chicken salad was no bigger than a side salad and the extra $4 for the chicken turned out to be 5 slices of half a chicken breast......Very disappointing especially as this was going to be a special Christmas luncheon."}
{"text":"Had the Misoyaki Sea Bass and it was delicious!  Our server was exceptional, thanks Amy!"}
{"text":"Was there for brunch on a Sunday. Most of the brunch specials are reasonably priced ($10-13), and they offer bottomless mimosas, sangria, or bellinis with any brunch item for $19. I went off grid and ordered the orange roughy special, substituting cous cous for the whipped potatoes. The roughy was supposed to come with crab meat on top, and although it did, the amount was comedically tiny. It was literally one tablespoon of crab. The fish itself was cooked well. It was crusted with something and fried, which I didn't realize when I ordered it but it was still fine. It came with broccoli also, which was also fine. I dislike being served regular broccoli with my meal when the price tag for the entree is over $23. It's like, really, you guys can't get some broccolini up in here? The cous cous was flavorless. Service was acceptable. Music levels were on the way too loud side. Could hardly hear each other over it, and we're not particularly soft spoken.   From the menu, it looks like they have some good happy hour specials, but I probably wouldn't ever come back to this location or any of the locations unless it were for that. I just think the prices are too high and the food too bland for what it is. Don't even get me started on how excessively caloric the food is according to their online nutritional information. I'm sure that had I ordered something in the 800-1600 calorie range it would have been delicious, but who wants to eat that many calories in one sitting at a chain restaurant?"}
{"text":"I expected more.   Was very disappointed.  Broccoli was cold, augroutin potato's hard shrimp swimming in sauce.  Not a good sauce. Would never go back."}
{"text":"Food is consistently awesome, as well as the staff......  I am just not a fan of the cramp sitting and ultra loud environment in the restaurant.  If you want a romantic dinner, forget about it."}
{"text":"My sister and brother-in-law brought us here tonight for my husband's birthday and it was awesome. Especially for the fact it is part of a chain and located near so many other great Scottsdale restaurants. The food was excellent and the drinks were amazing! We had the bang bang shrimp, Caesar salads, tilapia, rockfish, and Chilean sea bass to eat and blackberry sangria, pomegranate martini, watermelon martini, and mules to drink. Shad was an amazing and very attentive server. Everything was brought out in a timely manor and beautifully served. We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"First time visitor and disappointed. The server was very friendly and explained how all the fish and steaks are inspected by management on a daily basis? She said she would be right back with bread. Never brought it. We took advantage of a coupon for free Bang Bang shrimp appetizer. Very good. I ordered the special of the day Rockfish. It was ok at best. Was a bit rubbery and not hot. My wife ordered a medium rare ribeye, which was very rare and cold. The waitress had it re-fired and after about 10 minutes brought it back medium well, dry and tough. Wife left more than half of it. We were offered comped dessert but declined. I got the bill and had to ask for an adjustment because I was charged for the free appetizer. I know many people love this place; I'm not one of them."}
{"text":"Balling On A Budget!!! This is the place to go if you don't have a lot of money to spend but want a nice atmosphere n reasonable prices. The Customer Service is A Plus. Our Server Alicia was Great n Very Friendly!  We had the Parmesan crusted fish Perfect! I also had the corn chowder soup  The food is Delicious You Won't be Disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"A couple of friends and I wanted to try this restaurant for lunch first. That is our usual strategy to try a new restaurant. I really liked the atmosphere and the food was flavorful. Bang Bang Shrimp was wonderful, hot and spicy as I like it. Fish and chips was okay, just needed a bit more heat and flavor. I don't think it will be one of those restaurants where we would always crave to go back but it is still a choice in my top 15 places to eat."}
{"text":"Bonefish grill is one of those seafood chain restaurants located in the birchdale area complex.  It was my first time here trying this restaurant; and i have always heard ratings about the bang bang shrimp.  What is so great about the bang bang shrimp?  So instead of ordered it as a $10 appetizers i decieded to order it as my entree.  I ordered the Bang Bang shrimp tacos! with a pomegranate martini !   The pomemgranate martini was fantastic and would recommend whoever dines there to try it! it came with frozen grapes! My bf ordered the scallops over a bed of rice.  My bang bang shrimp was delectable and i now i see why people rave about the shrimp.  My dish came with three tacos, with a handful amount of shrimp in each taco.  The dish also came with a side salad with balsamic vinegar.  The scallops also look juicy and delicious but the whole entree came with probably 4 scallops the most.    The service was great! The waitress was nice and attentive.  I will dine at BoneFish Grill again sometime in the near future. Hopefully it'll be good as the one in huntersville."}
{"text":"5 of us came here for a late lunch. There was no wait as the place was pretty empty.   I've never had Bonefish Grill so I was pretty excited to try this place as I love fish and chain restaurants!  The Signature Artisan Bread was served with pesto dipping oil. It came to us warm and was delicious.   I ordered from the Grilled Fish section and had an Ahi Tuna Steak with Pan Asian Sauce on the side. They have different sauces you can pair with the fish. It also came with 2 sides. I chose Mashed Potatoes and Sautéed Spinach. It was delicious but I wish the portion was bigger.   I was able to capture another dish from the Grilled Fish section: Chilean Sea Bass with Mango Salsa. The two sides were Steamed Broccoli and Mashed Potatoes. The person who had this dish doesn't usually like fish but he said it was delicious!   Others ordered Bang Bang Shrimp Tacos (I was too late to snap a photo but it looked really pretty!) and Lily's Chicken. Everyone loved their food as well!  The only thing bothered me was the wait time for the food to come out. It took unusually long...  I'd love to try this place again! I'm going to Google for their other locations!"}
{"text":"Never encountered bad service here. They are always welcoming and try to accommodate whatever you need. The bartenders do a great job of remembering your name AND drink choice even if you have only been in a couple of times. Of my favorites, The steak is great here and always cooked just the way I ask. The fontina chop is wonderful and the gravy is rich .The fish and chips is another favorite with its light and crispy batter (the fries are pretty darn good too! ) Wednesday is bang bang shrimp night, a little to busy for my liking so come early!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for our 2 year anniversary dinner. We had about a fifteen minute wait so we had drink at the bar. The bartender was very personable and fun. Our table was ready right as we finished our drinks so we thought we could just add the tab to our dinner but the bartender came to our table and explained they run on different servers so he took the credit card and walked it back to our table which was extremely nice and he gave no complaints or attitude at all. To start the waiter we had recommended a pineapple martini since I didn't know what I wanted. Let me tell you, it was delicious and I love a waiter/waitress that recommends their favorites. We got crab cakes for an appetizer which was delicious even though they fell apart very easily, also the dipping sauce is amazing. It's got a spicy zing to it but not too much where it over powers the crab. For dinner we both got the stuffed lobster which was a special. They were decently filled with crab meat, creamed spinach and some type of cheese. They brought actual butter to dip our lobster in and it was out of a metal holder with a candle underneath to melt it. Our lobster was very good but the meat was a little too chewy from being over boiled (the only complaint I have of this place.) For dessert we got the brownie with ice cream that had a raspberry drizzle. Perfect size to split and a great ending to our meal... You can't really go wrong with a brownie. I will definitely return and our customer service was excellent. Also fyi, they give you bread with this delicious oil and herbs instead of butter, it's to die for!"}
{"text":"I've eaten there two time now and they did not disappoint! Both times I had the Bang Band Shrimp and the Crab Cakes. OMG!!! Both times they were so amazing,just beyond everything I was expecting! Our server was Jolene and she was fabulous! Funny, knowledgeable, and great at her job. Everything was so great and amazing I returned for some take out a couple nights later. That didn't disappoint either! I highly recommend this place as do the 4 others I was with! Just an amazing experience all around! Thank you!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent. We waited a few before our waitress came to the table, even had to ask if we had one. Once they found her, she was awesome. I had no been to Bonefish in years, I was very impressed. I got the salmon with seasonal veggies, which was zucchini with tomatoes top with Parmesan cheese, to dead for. My boyfriend got the stuffed tilapia, he loved it too. Cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"This was absolutely the worst dining experience ever at one of their restaurants. I visited the concord mills location tonite 5/30/2018. Not crowded at all. The host at the desk ignored us for 7 whole minutes before aknowledg us. 3 employees talked to him and no o e greeted or acknowledged that we were standing there in their faces. The waitress, a young blank faced black woman waited on us. I asked for sweet n low for my un sweet sweet tea and she never returned. Finally after  another person brought our food, she returned after I asked the food runner for something else to drink. She then informs me a full 15 -20 minutes later that her manager said told her the sweet n low packs were wet. She brought the check to us, two men, stating , this is together, right guys? Those people CHOSE to work there, they were not forced. Rude, slow and the bacon wrapped scallops were burned. Will NEVER return to that place again. Horrible people, horrible service. Was it just an off night?? Who cares, it's your freakn job to be kind and take care of guest and freakn WORK for your gratuities. $0 tip. I only rate them 1 star because there was nothing less."}
{"text":"The menu at Bonefish Grill pretty much leans along it's name. However, there are a number of non seafood dishes.  This night I chose the Spicy ahi tuna. The dish is served with several slices of perfectly prepared ahi tuna accompanied by a ball of jasmine rice,  julienne carrots and a bowl of chili sauce on the side. To kick it up, a bottle of sriracha sauce is provided. Overall this was a wonderful dish full of flavor.  Bonefish Grill also has a Happy Hour with several small plates and wines offered at discounted prices. The dining room and bar areas are bright and comfortable. Service was prompt and friendly. Parking can be challenging since it is next door to Flemings which also very busy. Tip- use valet parking at Flemings"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE it here.  We always sit in the bar and every export eve I've ever had is just great!  How can you beat $3,25 wine per glass?  The bang bang shrimp are to die for and all of the servers are so fun and engaging!"}
{"text":"I've wondered about this place for some time. It looked to me like it might be a chain. We went on a tues night for dinner and were given an electronic device that would vibrate and light up when our table was ready. My gut said leave but we stayed. The wait was short and we were taken to a table right at the kitchen opening. There are no doors and we spent our meal watching the staff pick up plates of food and listening to yelling in the kitchen. It wasn't angry yelling but it also wasn't enjoyable. Our waitress was super nice and told us about the menu and emphasized the fresh fish delivered daily and the oak char grilling. We started with crab cakes and a caesar salad. The salad was ok, dressing a little heavy, had an odd flavor, maybe too much dijon? The crab cakes were dry and served with a small dry seedy bit of lemon. (Some sea food restraints have learned to put elastic cloths over lemon halves but i guess not this place.) The crab cakes were ok, a bit  dry, crumbly and bland. not great at all but not so bad to send back, just boring. Entrees were grilled salmon and the grilled scallops with shrimp. The salmon was ok, not bad not great just ok. The scallops had faint grill marks and were cooked through, as were the shrimps. Both seemed a little small and under seasoned and under seared.  For a place that emphasizes their oak wood char grill it was pretty disappointing. The scallops were sadly boring and bland. the grill marks were minimal, char or sear almost non existent and over all presentation and flavor just plain and underwhelming. Sides were adequate - spinach and green beans. Again nothing wrong but nothing stood out as good either. The coconut pie has a weird texture, pretty much shredded coconut without much binder leaving the impression of a coconut hash brown served with a way too sweet Myers's rum sauce. The whole meal was adequate, just ok. Nothing terrible, nothing wrong but also no passion, nothing stood out. It seemed like the work of a C student, it got the job done and not a bit more. I went on line to find out they are indeed a chain with dozens of locations and that explains why the entire meal I felt like I was at a Claim Jumper or a Yard House or an airport."}
{"text":"Great to stop on the drive in or out of Vegas. Great atmosphere and quality food. That means you pay for it, and it's worth it. Fab drinks and menu choices, Sunday brunch for $20 with bottomless sangria, mimosas, beer, and a single breakfast. What a deal!"}
{"text":"Come here for the wood-fired fish.  Everything else is just OK.  Ceviche appetizer ($7.90) - taste overpowered by bell peppers, celery (especially strong!), and pre-cooked shrimp.  There was nothing refreshing or well developed about the flavor of the ceviche.  It seemed more like a salad of chopped ingredients rather than a medley of flavors.  I do not recommend.   Scallops - both as a bacon-wrapped appetizer ($10.50) and main entrée w/ Caesar salad ($19.80) were disappointing.  They may have been fresh and cooked correctly (thank goodness!) but they were tasteless.  I expect that sort of nice, subtle sweet flavor in the flesh but these were just bland.  Of course adding bacon to anything makes it better but the scallops alone were lacking in flavor.  Did not try their \"bang bang shrimp\" which is apparently their star appetizer dish.  I don't know, couldn't wrap myself around wanting breaded shrimp marinating in a mayonnaise sauce.  Sauces - Egads!  WTH!!  I've had mango in dishes before (salsa, chutney, etc.) but Bonefish's mango sauce used for the scallop appetizer and the sea bass entrée simply sucks - it seems to clash with and detract from the seafood, not enhance.  And the chimichurri sauce (2nd on their list of 4 sauces to choose from for your grilled fish) was, again, nothing to write home about - just a fancy name for Italian dressing.  Whichever you order, make sure you order sauces ON THE SIDE so you can try it before slathering it on a perfectly good piece of fish.  Chilean Sea Bass ($27.30) - and now the SAVING GRACE!  Everything with this entrée was superb!!  This delicious fish (AKA Patagonian toothfish) had a wonderful flavor in its delicate, buttery white meat with a nice wood-fired surface.  The fish's freshness and quality and the preparation were PERFECT!  Even the accompaniments were cooked and seasoned just right (spaghetti squash and steamed broccoli).  In fact the fish was so delicious I stopped using the mango and chimichurri sauces on the side altogether and enjoyed the naked flavors - the fish was stupendous all on its own!  Service - Generally was quite good... at least during the 1st half of dinner.  Our waiter was very attentive and communicative through our whole \"first-time\" process and spent the time helping us understand the restaurant offerings.  He did botch the ingredients on two separate dishes despite previously boasting that he knew the ingredients of every dish on the menu by heart.  And he ended up locking his attention onto another table which seemed to be friends of his.  Anyway, we ended up waiting on him throughout the second half of dinner as he spent time chatting and writing things (unrelated to order taking) at the other table.  Ambiance/decor - a bit strange if not confusing: dim lighting and a classy feel but you spend most of the time trying to hold down the butcher paper they spread out on your table.  The whole time I wasn't sure if I needed to wear a tie or a bib with a lobster picture on it and a crayon in one hand!  So to recap, we were unimpressed with the overall meal especially for the expectations set by the overprice and ambiance; a borderline 2-star experience which for me means I'd be the one in the group steering us away from choosing this place for dinner.  However, on only the merits of the Chilean sea bass entrée alone, I'd go back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"We made a reservation for today at 6:00pm, it is our 52nd Wedding Anniversary.  The restaurant was recommended by friends at dinner the other night.  Server Ralph listened to our comments , since we had never eaten there before.  My wife had the House Salad and the Chilean Sea Bass.  While the salad was good, the Sea Bass tasted undercooked and spicy.  I had a house salad and the Cold Water Lobster Tails and a glass of Merlot.  The salad was good. The Lobster Tails were steamed but had a lot of spices on them and didn't suit my taste.  I like Lobster steamed with little seasoning, only drawn butter which was served with the tails.  When we left the restaurant Ralph delivered to us a bag with a piece of Sea Bass cooked with less seasoning and two steamed Lobster Tails with no seasoning on them.  We ate them the next day.  My wife said that the a Sea a Bass was much better tasting and I could taste better Lobster.  We will go back and order properly.  Oh, we were given a complimentary desert and a anniversary card.  Great!!!"}
{"text":"I never thought of going here due to the title and I don't eat seafood. But we decided to take my mother in law here for her birthday brunch.  I liked that it was not crowded at all which works well when you're taking 3 kiddos to a nicer restaurant.  I was happy with the menu because I saw a couple options for me since I'm vegetarian.  I ordered an omelet with avocado with veggies on the side (it was very tempting to get the mac n cheese or potatoes au gratin, both of which were delicious as I tasted some off my husband's plate).  Of course, my omelet came out with bacon in it. I know it was not the server's fault, but frustrating all the same.  They did take the item off our bill and provided me with a new omelet which was appreciated.  Everyone else seemed to enjoy the food, but no major raves about it.  I'd be willing to return for brunch and try out the mimosa with a group of my girlfriends.  The food wasn't amazing, but I appreciated the healthy options and the location since I could then run errands at Crocker Park."}
{"text":"Great with a big group. Quality of the food pretty good for that price point. Had a variety of food and no one complained in our party."}
{"text":"Awesome food and great location.   However,  get your order to go because the service fluctuates between really bad to mediocre performance.   3rd visit-Not many people here,  but plenty of staff.  After waiting 5 minutes,  I had to move inside because the server had too many tables on the patio where I was seated.    My lobster bisque soup was room temp; but the bowl was fuming hot. So the server had to nuke it the microwave.   Normally;they bring out bread while waiting on your  entree.   When I asked about the bread the server said oh we only serve that based on request. (Umm no???) The server brought out the butter for the lobster only after I received the entree.  Which is pointless because it takes 10 minutes to melt the butter by tea light candle and lobster gets cold fast.   Had to flag down the server for refills.  Etc etc.   The Manager (tall woman with glasses)  observed me having to move to another table- one would think she would have stopped and say sorry for the inconvenience.   Nope,  she was too busy walking around shaking old ladies hands and complementing people like she was campaigning  to be an elected official or something .   Being a manager is not walking around shaking hands while wearing your Sunday best;  it's actually rolling up your sleeves and supporting your front line team.  The wait staff is nice and I fairly tipped my server because she was pleasant; and it was clear she didn't know if she was on horseback or on foot- to begin with."}
{"text":"First I would like to start by saying I have dined at Bonefish grill twice. My first experience I was pleased with so I returned again. If I could give this restaurant zero stars I would.   I ordered crab stuffed shrimp which was on their specials menu. The specials menu was not divided into courses (appetizers, entrees, etc), it just listed each dish out. At the very bottom it stated all entrees came with two sides. I was very excited for my meal and even when the meal arrived it was very tasty. Are you ready for the icing on the cake?   When my bill arrived I was surprised by the total because the price on the bill was not the same price listed on the specials menu. Let me just say I don't ever let prices steer me away from a meal. If the meal is worth it and I'm not blindsided the price doesn't matter. I questioned my waitress because I wanted to make sure I didn't miss something. She seemed annoyed by me questioning her and her response was the price listed on the specials menu is an appetizer price. How was I supposed to know that when at the very bottom of the menu it stated \"All entrees come with two sides\". Talk about misleading.   I went home and wrote to the corporate office to discuss my experience. Only because misleading menus lead to very unhappy customers and they should be aware of that. It said I would be contacted ASAP. An entire week goes by and I heard nothing, so I sent another message. It wasn't until that time that I was contacted by one of the local managers. I was given the apologies and I hope you will dine with us again speech that ended with I want to send you something in the mail. So I rambled off my address and waited for that something. It's been over 2 months and that something never arrived (not that it matters). My point in this whole review is, it's clear the customer service at Bonefish grill is terrible and I will never be returning. Thank goodness for Pinterest now I can make my own bang bang shrimp!"}
{"text":"The bang bang shrimp are great but the prices they charge for everything else are kind of high for the quality.   It's a nice experience for a night, but I didn't leave there happy about the ratio of quality:price. We had to ask for the bread! I would go to Red Lobster before this place for quantity/quality. You are probably over-paying for the same thing. Grouper are over-fished and shouldn't be eaten in any restaurant!"}
{"text":"We were in Cleveland crossing off a couple of bucket list items, the rock 'n' roll Hall of Fame, and the NFL Hall of Fame in Canton and also had occasion to meet up with my wife's family for dinner so we wanted to go someplace nice.  I've eaten at other Bonefish Grill's and the experience has always  been good and this was a convenient location to our hotel so we gave it a try.  It was just as expected, very warm atmosphere, excellent menu and beverage selection, and first class food and service.  The menu is a little on the pricey side, but definitely worth every penny."}
{"text":"Bang bang shrimp was good, so were the drinks. The Eggs Benedict was ok. Except the English muffin was raw, kind of gross, but I didn't want to wait any longer for another one. The restaurant wasn't very busy, even though it was peak lunch time. Still took awhile to get the food. Staff new it was special occasion, didn't acknowledge in any way. The environment wasn't inviting & food was mediocre, won't be going back."}
{"text":"the food is good but tbere are no vegetarian entrees or sides!! the lighting is the worst ever why even bother with the candle!!! the food was good and the iced tea is nice but please fix the lighting!!!!!"}
{"text":"BEST FOOD EVER!!!! I loved loved loved this Bonefish!  The wait was long and kind of annoying but it was OK. We were given samples f te Cicken Marsala while we waited and ad a drink. It was about 30 minutes and packed on a Wednesday evening.  I had a rasberrry Vodka Collins. It was so good I had another later on. The bread was so good. Chewy on te outside soft on the inside and te olive oil plate had actual olives in it and cracked Kosher salt and herbs. SO GOOD! And the Calamari was light and plentiful with chives and in contrast to other resturants, non greasy! There was a great little surprise of fried red and orange pepper stripes that with great with the Asian styl dipping sauce. The fish was grilled perfectly, greatly seasoned and pipping hot! The  My husband and I had the exact same meal, Orange Roguhy fish grilled in the wood oven. It had crab meat that was so yummy with steamed spinach on the top. OMG! Mouth. Orgasim. There were also jasmine rice with seasonal veggies. The rice was OK noting to write home about. It was not bad. The veggies were steamed perfectly and the flavors were still coming through with fresh grilled tomatoes and parmasean sprinkled on it. The portion sizes were perfect and did not sacrafice quality for quanity. I cant  wait to return!"}
{"text":"This location has spectacular food, classy decor, competent staff, and great drinks. I was with a group of 12 over the holiday weekend and they did everything right. Two waitstaff were assigned to us and multiple other staff brought out our food, refilled drinks, and checked on us. They even split the bill correctly without having to be told more than once.   The Bang Bang Shrimp is pretty much to die for, as is their creamy Imperial dip - made with crab meat, shrimp, and scallops and served with crispy flatbread chips. The roasted mushroom flatbread is also tasty but the first two appetizers blew everything else away they were so yummy. I could have had just the bang bang shrimp and imperial dip and been extremely happy. In fact... next time that may be my entire meal.   Our group tried the fish sandwich, surf and turf burger, basil fettucine with chicken and salmon, the kobe beef burger, the brunch burger with an egg on top, the fish n chips, and the creme brulee french toast. Everyone raved about everything.  Also, the berry smash lemonade is tasty.  From the food, to the service, to the atmosphere there was nothing missing from this experience. They handled our big group with ease and simplicity. I loved my basil fettuccine and cannot wait to return for their brunch items.  The bad reviews all seem to be from when they first opened, which was not too long ago. They seem to have ironed out the kinks, gotten their online reservations to work properly, and weeded out the staff that were struggling.   Nothing but kudos for this BFG location."}
{"text":"Good Service, Great Food!  Very impressed with portion sizes. Was reasonably priced. Ahi Tuna was fabulous. Would definitely go back.."}
{"text":"I come here 2-3 times per week sometimes, then take a break and go back again multiple times per week.  I went last Wednesday and had the BB shrimp- it was excellent. I went back again on Saturday afternoon and of course ordered the BB shrimp, but it was not the same as 4 days prior, there was literally no breading or sauce on my shrimp. I ate it up since I was starving...but I think they changed the recipe or something?  disappointed...."}
{"text":"The crab cakes are full of crab, very little breading and the bang bang shrimp are delicious. Our service was fantastic. Definitely will go back."}
{"text":"This place is massively underwhelming. The prices are high for the quality and presentation of the food. The flavor is meh. The worst part of the experience was the awkward service. I took my parents out to dinner; during the 20-minute wait for a table, we got drinks at the bar. They have the most miniature Moscow Mule mugs I've ever laid eyes on, BTW. When our table was ready, I sent my parents on their way and tried to flag down a bartender to take care of our tab. The bar was far from full, but both bartenders did that thing where they walk past but carefully avoid eye contact so they don't have to deal with you. The guy knew we were waiting for a table - why so hard to take care of the tab? Then finding my parents was an ordeal. The two girls at the hostess stand were too engrossed in conversation to point me on my way. When I finally joined my parents, my dad said he had specifically told the girl who seated them that I'd be following after I paid the tab. Maybe so much time had passed that they forgot? Our waiter was over-the-top enthusiastic, perhaps to make up for his space cadet coworkers. Overpriced, mediocre food in a cringe-inducing atmosphere - I won't be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I LOVE Bonefish! The fish is always fresh and the service is always amazing.   Appetizer: You have to get the Bang Bang shrimp! It is lightly coated for a crunch and the sauce has a nice kick that adds flavor but not overpowering. It is big enough to share.   Dinner: All of their fish is amazing but we usually get a seasonal special. Tonight we split the swordfish topped with crab and served with pumpkin ravioli. With the appetizer it was more than enough to share.   Our drinks were always fresh and we were checked on frequently. I recommend going for happy hour because their $5 margaritas are delicious and 2 of them will make you quite happy!"}
{"text":"Wow, their swordfish was great. I loved the bang bang shrimp and the house salad (hearts of palm, amigos!)   Bonefish Grill is one of those places it seems all my friends are raving about and I didn't see the point in going to...until I went. This place was a great time. The food was remarkable, especially considering how affordable it was. We are talking quality sea food for a price that isn't too much more than TGI Friday's \"fancy\" menu.   We dined here for our 3 year wedding anniversary and the service was superb. Everyone we encountered, especially our waiter, was very kind. We struck up conversations with nearly every staff member we spoke to and to top it off the food was great.   I love swordfish, the steak of the sea. I always order it when I go out to seafood places as a gauge of said place's quality. If you're bold enough to serve swordfish, you better make sure you do it right. Spoiler: they did a great job.  Overall, I would absolutely eat here again AND recommend the place. Give it a whirl, kids!"}
{"text":"Haven't been to a Bonefish in years and can't understand why.  The aroma of the smoked cedar planks hits you as you walk in the door and causes a Pavlov-like response.  The Bang Bang  Shrimp Flatbread isn't traditional flatbread at all but  lightly tempura fried shrimp in a creamy spicy romelade sauce.  Both the Crab Cake Dinner and the Rock Fish Oscar were excellent.   The beer was among  the coldest I've had in Vegas and the Key Lime Pie is made on-site with fresh key limes.  Excellent meal."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing!  The food and service is great and the ambience was even better.  Spoke to the owner, very nice Gentleman.  Great experience!"}
{"text":"Ok maybe I am not allowed to write a review yet because I did get a free meal today during the soft opening with a flyer that came from American Express, but I have made reservations for dinner later this week and for a Holiday party in December.  That should tell you how good it was.    The decor is beautiful wood grained and black with the bonefish accents tastefully arranged throughout the restaurant.  A really big beautiful one on the main dining room.  The wait staff is enthusiastic, friendly and while there were a few minor glitches, they were quickly remedied.  And hey, they haven't even really opened yet.  The 17th is the first day.  The Bang Bang Shrimp appetizer, is a must order!  Enough to share with 3 or 4.  I had the Sea Bass with mango salsa and it was perfectly cooked and really was sea bass.  I'm sure everyone knows that the name on the menu does not always equate to what comes out on the plate, particularly when they say sea bass.  This was perfectly cooked - moist, tender, and flakey.  It had a beautiful sear and the salsa had large chunks of mango with red onion and a bit of spice, and was most definitely sea bass, not an immitation.   It was served with spaghetti squash that was well prepared and I chose couscous as the side dish, which was surprisingly good.  My friend had the Salmon, also with the mango salsa and shared a bit with me.  It was perfectly seared and her side was broccoli.  Big bright green beautiful florets.  The creme Brûlée dessert was creamy, with a windowpane of fired sugar and was big enough to share.  I am sorry I did not take pictures for you.  I guess you will just have to go over there yourself and see.  Thank goodness bonefish grill finally came to Madison and we can pretend we are in Florida while the snow flies.  This is the best seafood I have had in Wisconsin."}
{"text":"After doing some last minute shopping. Decided to relax and have dinner at the Bone Fish Grill... my salmon was the best.  And their bread.... warm and sooo good!  When in the area we always try to stop in.  Food is always delicious and the servers are so polite ."}
{"text":"Came here for my sister's graduation dinner. We had about 18 people (two separate tables). At first it was a little bumpy. The table was not set up yet on time, and we had a select menu to choose from (but they gave us their regular menus). They seemed a little underprepared. But after that everything seemed to go a little smoother. Our servers (we had two) were good and seemed to check on us frequently.  Our select menu was a three course meal that included a salad (house or Caesar), an entree, and a dessert. I opted for the Caesar and it was delicious, not overly dressed.  I got a alcoholic beverage - pomegranate martini. It was fruity, but sweet. I drank three of them!  For the entree I ordered a filet mignon (medium rare) with the whipped potatoes and broccoli.  It seemed to take quite a long time for the food to come out. When it did, my steak was over cooked (it was basically well done) and the broccoli was under-seasoned - or maybe not seasoned at all?   A little after the entrees came out there was a little situation and the medics were called. Everything is fine. But the staff (management) was helpful and responded quickly. This was why I gave them the four stars. After everything they checked up on me and seemed honestly concerned. After the situation, I was able to take my dessert home - brownie with ice cream.   Their food was not bad, it was just a little under-seasoned (but pepper does the trick!) and my steak was a little over done - but I'm sure they would recook it if I had asked. I have been here several times, and I'm sure I'll make my way back here again!"}
{"text":"Well, with 0 Degrees and being directly next to my hotel, It is just convenient. Walked in, it was busy, but found a seat at the bar right in front of a TV (Winning!) that was streaming ESPN, so I was entertained from the get go. Bartender Chris was on point with my order and was very helpful as well. I'll upload a picture of my order. Love their Bang Bang Shrimp so went ahead and ordered, as well as the corn and crab soup, perfect for this weather.  Food was great, service was amazing. Then again, I've never had any issues with Bonefish."}
{"text":"Group work lunch on a Friday. although bad weather day, service and food was excellent! we had a waiter and waitress attend to our party of 8. they attended our needs, thoroughly answered questions   food was hot and fresh, nice presentation great rum specials,  will look forward to going again"}
{"text":"We are from San Diego and we do not have a Bonefish Grill anywhere near us.  I love food and I like to try new places.   It also happened to be a Friends and Family Event.    I was in the mood for Fish and Chips and boy did I get some delicious Fish and Chips.  Big Flaky Fish (cod?) and crispy fries.  I also had a house salad with their tasty Lemon Vinaigrette, loved it.  Their fresh baked bread with Pesto was served warm and it was so good.  And now to the absolute highlight...the Coconut Pie.   The rum sauce and whipped cream complimented the pie perfectly.  I've never had anything like it.    The service was friendly and impeccable.  Jeff and Molly took care of all of our needs.  The restaurant was clean and comfortable.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Food is good as every one say Bang Bang shrimp is out of the world so good. They offered bread only after ordering main course. Overall it is a good experience."}
{"text":"Never heard of this place before, saw it while driving around townsquare when they were still in the building stages. We decided to come in after running the spartan race myself... Everything was top notch, specially our server Vanessa. She was very thorough with the menu and gave us near to excellent service. (Maybe a water refill here and there) but their \"Parker's margarita\" made me wanna drink nothing else but. Overall a good experience. We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I tried Bonefish for the first time last week (1-31-15).   .....this has nothing to do with Bonefish but parking was ROUGH. This was a Saturday around 7:30 p.m. which, apparently, equates to mayhem in the Birkdale parking lots. It took me at least 10 minutes to find a spot, so just be warned.  All right back to Bonefish...I was surprised at how dim they keep the lights inside the restaurant yet it did create a more intimate ambiance. For drinks, I ordered their version of the moscow mule. It was very strong on the ginger and probably not anything I would order again from there. Since I wasn't too hungry, I decided to order one of the appetizers, shrimp ceviche.   There was quite a length of time we waited before our plates were brought out to us. The ceviche arrived in a glass bowl with tortilla chips. Surprisingly, it was very filling! The ceviche was topped with guacamole and had a light, acidic dressing.  This visit was nothing special but I plan to go back to Bonefish to try one of their entrees to get a more well-rounded experience."}
{"text":"Perhaps if i were on a diet and wanted badly to overpay for my meal, I would be a big fan, but as I am not on a diet nor do I typically just like giving away money I am not a fan at all.... I was left wanting.......another meal....."}
{"text":"I must say this place is amazing, this was the second time my family and I went. This was a special occasion for us, as we were celebrating my mothers birthday. She was craving the stuffed tilapia, which by the way is amazing, but it was not on the menu for today. We asked the waiter Jon if he could ask if we could order that item, and he was kind enough to ask. The chef was more than willing to accommodate our order in. Jon, was on top of everything. Not once, was our glasses empty, and he came around constantly to check on us. Not everyone is quick to write a positive review, but our service today and the previous time we have visited has been superb!     Two thumbs up to all the staff!!"}
{"text":"I visited the town square location for my anniversary and it was fantastic the food was perfect and they were having a special menu that we ordered from that. Our waitress so fantastic.  We even got chocolate covered strawberry's since it was our special day.  Scallops were perfect and I had a watermelon Martini that was to die for on a hot summer day. I highly recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Great food. I am a fan of bonefish, love the shrimp and the tuna. Both are on the appetizer menu. It's a little pricy but worth the money. It was very close to my hotel so it made it easy to get there and back. Stop by its a nice place for dinner  Visited November 2011"}
{"text":"Opening night at Bonefish..Jarell at the bar is awesome and has the best customer service! Although the food left a lot to be desired he made our experience most enjoyable! Four stars for customer service!"}
{"text":"love the happy hour menu! and i lucked out, came on a Wednesday, which their awesome Bang Bang shrimp is $5 all day on Wednesdays! *does the fat girl happy dance*  prices were great, food and cocktails were great.. servers were awesome.. had a great experience all around. will definitely come back to get tipsy & full ;)"}
{"text":"I've read about this place before and honestly, I was hesitant to try as the reviews were, mixed. Three if us went on a Wednesday night and were seated immediately which I suppose we expected. Nicole was our server and was easily one of the best we've had in a long time. She's well spoken, knowledgeable, and has a good sense of humor. We found out she's a corporate training which explains her extreme level of professionalism and ability to navigate the menu. Two of us ordered off the specials menu. My dad ordered bacon butter Norwegian salmon ($25) and I ordered diver scallops ($29). Both were perfect. My boyfriend ordered the salmon of the simply grilled menu with pesto.($20) Also, perfect.   I have to say, this experience surpassed even some of the most fine dining restaurants we've been to. It's was quiet, professional, and comfortable. For the atmosphere and food offered, it was reasonable in cost as well.   We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I guess things change.   We moved to Beloit Wisconsin about five years ago from Columbus Ohio.   We were regular diners at the Polaris location there and were never disappointed.  Sometimes just to indulge in bang bang Wednesday and a Guinness.   There isn't a bonefish grill near us in Beloit,  so until last week we had not been back.  I decided it was time and took my wife there on her birthday.   Service was fine,  a little lacking, but fine.   The food was a huge disappointment.   I'll concentrate on that as the reason we won't be returning.   Starter was bang bang shrimp.   Way too much mayo in the sauce,  it didn't bite the way we recalled,  and we ate a lot of it in the past.  We both ordered the crabcake and steak,  upgraded to filet,  Oscar style, both with au gratin potatoes,  and a different veggie for us both.   No-one has ever had better au gratin potatoes than you guys.  Theses ones were horrible.  They tasted like thawed frozen potatoes mixed in Velveeta.   When the manager visited us after we responded to the waitress inquiry about our satisfaction,  he did say that they had changed the cheese.   Bad bad move,  your guys had the best quality.  The filet had to be sawed to cut it.   It was very tough for a filet.   The Oscar style had no bearnaise at all, none just some flakes of crab (?) meat dribbled on top followed by some limp asparagus that was too mushy to eat.    The crab cakes were awful,  they weren't even a cake because they would not hold together.   They were just a pile of mush basically.   The remoulade obviously had the missing spice from the bang bang sauce because it was way too spicy.   During his visit,  the manager comp't us a desert,  but not the coffee to go with it.   The key lime pie that I had was good.   The lava cake my wife had wasn't really a lava cake.   They cut a hole in the top of a piece of chocolate cake,  filled it,  then covered the hole with whipped cream.   That's the bulk of my review.   Shortcuts will kill,  and have killed,  your business reputation.   We won't revisit,  won't recommend,  and will steer those who want tho go there,  away.   Sorry,  but my dollar is worth way better.  -pjh"}
{"text":"I've only been to Bonefish once, for a birthday dinner last week, but it was a five-star visit.  The place is a little dressier than the other venues in its immediate area, but it isn't too stuffy. It's relaxed in that particularly upper-middle-class way: I'm surprised that they're located on 74 instead of somewhere in Ballantyne.  Anyways, I digress from the main point of this review: the food is good. Really good.  Make sure you order the much-lauded Bang Bang Shrimp appetizer: it really is as delicious as everyone says, and it's half off on Wednesdays too boot.  For my main course, I ordered grilled shrimp and scallops with mango salsa.  The scallops were good, but the shrimp were definitely some of the best I've ever had in my entire life, and I have had a lot of shrimp.  They were little meaty flavor bombs.  I don't know if they're always that good, but I certainly will go back to find out.  Bonefish is worth driving on 74 to get there. I think that's the best praise I can give."}
{"text":"We ate here last night for our anniversary. We both barely made it home and were immediately sick. The restaurant was very busy and dining experience felt very rushed. Was not like our other visits, which were very good.  We will come back, but will try to visit at non peak times. We arrived at 6:40pm and were seated at 7:10.  There were very comfortable seating outside in shade and servers were excellent."}
{"text":"My husband and I used this Bonefish Grill location for a late lunch/early dinner after our small wedding ceremony on a recent Saturday afternoon. It was 30 diners, including us.   The events manager, Andy was great. Their policy for group reservations was really flexible, as well. We only needed to give a final headcount 2 days ahead (we gave a ballpark when we booked) and people could choose that day from among the 3 entree options we selected when we booked. No having to get people to RSVP to us with their meal choices - heaven for a wedding! We even had 2 vegetarians in the party and they could select from among a few vegetarian options at no extra charge. The group events menus they have start at very reasonable prices - less than other options in Town Square we had considered using.   They let us use the projector screen in the room, which we used to put up a slideshow of combined family photos that my mom made. That was a great addition to the meal. Everyone was happy with their food, and the waitstaff made serving and clearing smooth.   Thanks!"}
{"text":"Had a group of 8 who were part of the Warthog group staying at the Holiday Inn next door. The greeter wasn't too thrilled with the group. Our waiter was attentive and took very good care of the group. Loved the Bang Bang shrimp!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat found the food with my wife really decent. The more we go the better it gets, the bang bang shrimp is really awesome. The dinner for two gives you the best fish. You can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"Make this a Monday-Must for Happy Hour. All martinis on the menu are just $5 on Mondays and happy hour goes from 4-6:30pm- I tried their dirty martini and it was fab. I was pleasantly surprised with the blue cheese stuffed olives and a hint of pickle flavor, for the win! They have a bar specials menu with a variety of dishes from cod sliders, ahi poke to the yummy mussels, and if you have a child with you- they will even accommodate their happy hour menu in the dining room - I really appreciated that policy, not every business does that.  On our most recent visit, we started with their warm crisp-on-the-outside-soft-on-the-inside house bread with garlic-herb pesto. Delicious! (side note: check my tip on the bread, just to be safe)  On to Bang! Bang! Shrimp & Ceviche. The B!B!S is a crowd favorite with fried shrimp, perfectly crisp, liberally tossed in a flavorful sweet and spicy sauce over a bed of lettuce. It's a good portion for sharing amongst friends and make sure to toss the lettuce in the dressing for a delicious little salad, to boot.  Not to be outdone, the ceviche of the day is a mixto of scallops, shrimp & sea bass, marinated in lots of lime, cucumber and avocado- served with tortilla strips. Ceviche was good, aside from large pieces of butternut squash that didn't mesh with the rest of the dish. I would request extra jalapeño if you're into spicy and ask for extra crispy strips; they were a little chewy and under-seasoned.  I had the Mussels Josephine from the bar bites menu. A good portion, plenty to make a dinner out of- with a delicious lemon butter broth underneath and tomatoes that paired perfectly with each bite of mussels. I thoroughly enjoyed each bite of succulent garlicy mussel with the diced tomatoes, it was a great mix. I wish I had saved my bread to sop up the broth, it was just super yummy.  Hubby had the filet with lobster, green beans and potatoes au gratin. Sides were all good. The cook on the steak was as requested (medium rare) but needed seasoning. We shared the lobster- it was cooked and presented nicely with side of grilled lemon and butter for dipping. Not mad about the lobster.  As for service, Nicole K. was a rockstar- some of the best service we've had dining out in a while. She was right on top of each detail, whether clearing plates, replacing utensils, fresh waters- next rounds of drinks, and even brought my son a special little dish of chocolate covered strawberries with whipped cream and chocolate chips in honor of his kinder-graduation.  As far as chains go, this one is my current favorite."}
{"text":"Shrimp dynamite, truffle Mac and cheese and crab fried rice were superb!!!! Customer service was also top knotch. We had 2 servers, one in training.. both were excellent with personal recommendations and extensive knowledge of the menu. Would definitely eat here again. Great experience!"}
{"text":"So me and a good friend of mine went to this place and decided to have a late night dinner I decided to start with an appetizer I ordered the bang bang shrimp which was a really delicious appetizer and my friend order the calamari which was also a really yummy appetizer..   For our entrées I decided to order the salmon, garlic whipped mashed potatoes and a side of jasmine rice however my jasmine rice was really hard my whipped garlic mashed potatoes I really loved but my salmon I did not... My salmon tasted like of course it had been on the grill but it had that charcoal taste to it  My friend ordered the fillet mignon butterfly style asparagus and white rice with crabmeat however he loved his rice,  I of course thought it was still hard.. His steak was pretty yummy he really didn't care for it too much tho..  After all being said I don't think I would give this restaurants a second try, however the staff are very friendly and accommodating and the set up on the inside is very gorgeous!!!"}
{"text":"Couldn't believe the seafood here is so amazing. Crabcake is a must-try appetizer; grilled shrimp is also a bomb; I know we should drink white wine but can't resist Woodford Reserve!"}
{"text":"The minute we walked into this place at 8pm on a Friday night and it was practically empty, we knew we should've left and gone somewhere else.. but we decided to stick it out. Ordered an appetizer (bang bang shrimp- -only so so) and had brought two bottles of our own. We were immediately told of the $10 cork fee Per Bottle- somewhat ridiculous and tells me they take themselves far more serious than they should. Then the waitress said she still had to card us- bad vibe came from her from the moment we sat down.  Food was sub par at best. Mahi mahi was decent but nothing to write home about. The crab was Smelly from the moment it got placed on our table. We made it clear that the crab did not taste nor smell well and that we would not be eating it- nothing was done.  Will not be returning. Wish we would've gone with our instincts and left."}
{"text":"The first thing I have to mention is the interaction with the host and manager. We had a reservation and, upon arriving, the host indicated that the table assigned to our party had a prior party still sitting in it. He went on venting about how they'd been there for 2 hours, check paid, and are just sitting there talking. I understand these things happen, but it's a little uncomfortable to have a restaurant berating other customers behind their backs to you. How do we respond to that? To make matters worse, when we were seated at the common table, the manager came over apologizing for the seating problem, and he again went on about how irritating he found the party overstaying their welcome. I was very self-conscious about leaving as soon as we'd paid, that's for certain.  On to the actual event. It's Bonefish Grill. It's slightly preferable to Red Lobster. You go for the ambiance which is a little like PF Changs - date night on a budget with respectable but not exciting or memorable food selections.  As I'd been to Bonefish Grill before I decided to try something new and got the Lobster Roll. Bad choice, as it was overpowered with salt and celery. It almost felt vegetarian. The celery pieces should never be larger than the lobster pieces. This roll would absolutely benefit from large chunks of lobster, truer to a New England style. The side of coleslaw was, in my opinion, too vinegary and thus inedible."}
{"text":"Great food! Great service!  I'm a huge fan of their bang ban shrimp tacos and I can't wait to try their Sunday brunch w/mimosas!"}
{"text":"I've been to many locations and have never had a bad meal at any of them.  Great food.  Bang bang shrimp are a favorite as is their house salad dressing (lemon vinaigrette).  Had one of the best steaks I have ever had at their Panama City Beach location (rivaling Ruth's Chris, Blackies House of Beef, and Morton's) which blew me away...  We chatted with their manager and apparently they get first pick of the cuts before their other restaurants and this guy knew how to pick them and it was beautifully cooked."}
{"text":"Came here with my fiancee today and it was our first time. I got the roasted red pepper soup and the kobe burger and she got the house salad and the Atlantic salmon.we got their version of a berry shortake with strawberries, blueberries and blackberries with whipped cream and a biscuit topping qs well. Our server was friendly but did not frequent the table as often as she could during a slow lunch afternoon.  She did go over the whole menu and the specials so we understood it all as well which was nice.  I would definitely go back to eat here again. It was worth it."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch with a colleague the day after opening.  It was a late lunch, and there were plenty of servers around, including the manager.   I can't give a review on the food since I didn't eat.  There was plenty of wait staff, and a lot of them came by.   Went back a couple of days later for happy hour.   It was a Friday.  Whoa!!   Chaos!   Plenty of servers, again.  We grabbed a table in the bar, got the appetizer menu (Food is not part of happy hour specials), and were told by four different people what was on the happy hour drink menu.   Since the information didn't coincide with what we were told at lunch, I talked to the manager.   He had to go to the bar  staff to get what was on the bar happy hour.   We ordered the mussels, which my companion had had in another Bonefish location.   They were mussels.   Nothing special.   The tables for two were taken by the time we got there; therefore, we sat at a table for four.   People kept stopping by our table and asking if they could join us.   Uhhhhh, hello??!!   No!!!   He was so irritated by all of the different responses of what or was not on the happy hour food menu and the fact that people kept wanting to sit with us that we ended up going to another restaurant for dinner.   Well, six days later I went there with another friend cause I thought it would be good and since it was not a Friday, I figured it would not be as busy.   I had the basil fettuccine, and he had the lobster grilled cheese.  I tried his lobster grilled cheese sandwich.   Meh.   He loved the lobster bisque that came with it .   I didn't try it cause he had a cold.   He said the salad was good that it came with as well.    My fettuccine, meh.  So so.   It had a lot of artichoke hearts in it that I didn't especially care for its flavor.   I love pasta, but this fettuccine left a lot to be desired in its flavoring.  I ordered it with chicken added.   Another meh.   I don't know.   Would I go back?  Probably not.   There's a lot of restaurants in town, good ones to boot.  Not worth it to go to a mediocre restaurant.   If I did go, perhaps would try one of their fish dishes."}
{"text":"Over priced for what you get .... Sizler quality at Flemmings prices.... Service was horrible had to ask 4 times for water!!! I will never be back."}
{"text":"Food here is awesome, excellent bartenders. Eat here twice a week! The superfood salad, sea bass, and bang bang shrimp are the best!"}
{"text":"Food was great the service was awesome. Our waiter was so friendly and knowledgeable about the menu, he was also funny. The food came fast and it was so delicious, definitely going back"}
{"text":"This was my husband's and myself first time here. Im telling you now we shall return the wait wasnt bad at all. Now the food, first the bread I'm not a big bread eater but let's just say I kept ordering more. The food i had the Stuffed Tilapia with fresh season vegetables and a side of Truffle Macaroni and Cheese, my husband had the special which was the Salmon with Blue Cheese and Sauted Spinach Im once again not a salmon person I love seafood but not all,and his salmon looked so good. He enjoyed every bite. The price wasnt bad at all for the 2 of us , we walked out saying WE'LL BE BACK."}
{"text":"Went in to put in our name. Hostess asked us how many, we said the amount - waitstaff started saying \"nooo - don't seat them!\" So we left. Forget that. Don't want us there, we won't go. Last thing we need is shitty service. Do not recommend."}
{"text":"I've been to bonefish a couple of times with my family, my last visit was the best experience I've had! Bonefish has a really nice, \"date night\" ambience, w/ the dim lighting & classy setting. The menu prices are a tad on the higher side, since the menu mainly consist seafood! My mom is a carb-oholic, so she LOVES their bread. (it's like fresh out the oven typa bread- heaaven) Everyone raves about their famous, bang bang shrimp I enjoyed it, but I feel as the hype is waay too high. I had tried a couple of their dishes & all is good no complaints. (: BUT LETS TALK ABOUT OUR WAITER DOE! All the waiters I've had here were pretty awesome, but this one exceeded my expectations. Sadly I forgot his name, but he was so charming and attentive to all our needs. We had a party of 5, and only 2 of us arrived so we had to wait about half an hour behind the others arrived. He was very patient with us  & we didn't feel rush AT ALL. He made sure to check up on us throughout our meal. At the end of our meal, we wanted to take the left over bread home & he was very sweet to go in the back & grabbed 2 extra loaves for us yasss!! We had a $10 gift card that was expired & he somehow made that work for us. (:"}
{"text":"This was our first visit and I'm happy to say that it was a great one! Nothing bad to say. Wednesdays are $6 Bang Bang Shrimp so we definitely took advantage of it, great flavor. We ordered our entries (Rhea's Yellowtail and Swordfish and Pumpkin Ravioli) from their special seasonal menu which was so GOOD! Who would have thought Pumpkin Ravioli would taste so good?! It was nice and creamy. Our waitress was wonderful and friendly, quick, checked in with us often. Nice atmosphere, modern ambiance. Will go again. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Bang bang shrimp.   If you've ever been anywhere with some variation of \"buffalo shrimp\", it's only second rate to the bang bang shrimp at Bonefish. Not only are the shrimp one of my all time favorite items but they're served on a bed of lettuce so you literally have a salad left once you eat all the shrimp. Two meals. One order.   If you go on Wednesday after 4pm, you can get this Two-fer for $6. Just in case you missed that, it's:   Shrimp. Salad. Deliciousness. $6.00   You're welcome for Wednesday night dinner plans for the rest of your life."}
{"text":"The two bartenders were legit. Took care of me very well despite the fact that I came in at 9:15. They made me feel welcome and introduced themselves. Little things mean a lot. Food was good too. I was in and out in less than 40 minutes."}
{"text":"Went to have a early dinner first time here and love the way it looks very clean and friendly staff quick to say hello as we arrived and our sever was first class lady made sure we were ready for our food experience and it was worth it? Not to pricey but you get what you pay for quality food or cheap they have both and serve you like a king!!!! Drinks were  good and food great lamb chops out of this world and side Mac .... Yum all in all we loved the dinner and mgr cane out to say hi and invite us back and tell us about good day to come try different combos !!! Nice they made us feel important and that and good food makes it our spot!!!! Thank you bone fish grill for your top notch customer service at the town square one..... Steve and Paula"}
{"text":"2nd trip there. Food was delicious. Service good and staffers were very pleasant. the ambiance is great . Bonefish is a great new addition to the area...off to a good start now and glad to see they are here."}
{"text":"I really don't understand why people love this place. Bang Bang Shrimp is fantastic but everything else is just so-so."}
{"text":"Nice impromptu dinner tonight. Even nicer was surprise menu - Hooked on Tuesday's\"  We started off with bang bang shrimp (doesn't everyone that comes here) and then I had the Cold lobster tail entree for dinner. I started with the bonefish house salad, which I didn't care for at all, and is the reason for four stars. The lobster was real good, as were my two sides. I would recommend it."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why they've had some bad reviews, because my first time here went flawlessly!   Food: order the Bang Bang Shrimp! It will not disappoint! I've never had anything like it before! Crunchy, flavorful, and a really great serving for 2! I also love love love their Cobb Salad with shrimp! Everything looked fresh, and it was so filling!   Service/Environment: Our server was so sweet and kind! Everyone was actually very sweet!   HIGHLY recommend visiting this restaurant! I'm probably going to visit the happy hour as well! I heard it's a bit cheaper. But if you're wanting a nice, low key kind of date night with your partner, this is the spot!"}
{"text":"The sea bass I had was rather bland. Seasonal steamed vegetables were served too big to eat without cutting, but required a steak knife to cut.  There are plenty of great locally owned restaurants around that serve better food at the same or lower prices than Bonefish."}
{"text":"Everything was so delicious.  Will definitely be coming back. Got the shrimp stuffed lobster as an appetizer. So yummy. My boyfriend got the fish and chips and the fish is breaded with tempura and it was amazing. I got the tilapia imperial with the crab fried rice. Everything was great even the lemonade and sangria."}
{"text":"This rating is based on my last 3 visits. Management seems to be responsible. I've eaten at several different locations and this is the only one that just can't seem to get it together. During my last visit there were 4 people at the hostess stand, 2 looked like managers. The managers were drinking at the stand and just standing and talking to the hostess while we waited to be sat. My impression is that this is their social time and pretty secure with their job. Once seated we had mediocre service, several tables sent back drinks, and at least 3 tables needed to be bussed. The entire time we were there the managers crowded around the hostesses. It would have been nice if they had checked on our table. Then we could have gotten the bread and chopsticks we requested. I think 3 opportunities to get it right is fair and they failed all 3 times. I will not be back to this location. Try one of the other restaurants in the area like EEZ. It's very good and the service and management are excellent."}
{"text":"Attending a retirement seminar with Freedom Dream Team, Inc. Lets see what good info is provided along with this free meal."}
{"text":"So Disgusted! I Ordered my favorite dish from this place, the Bang Bang Shrimp Po Boy. I have been here a few times and always thought this was a nice clean place to eat. I will never ever go back here. I found a COCKROACH IN MY FOOD!!   The staff was nice and offered to comp the bill for the entire table, but i can't stop thinking about the critter that was in my meal.   I will never eat here again. The staff was apologetic and nice but i cant get past this terrible experience."}
{"text":"Once again, I wish there was a 1/2 rating. This isn't quite 4 stars, but it is better than 3. I'm going for 3 now, and when I come back, if it's worth upping, I will do so.  Located in Town Square, it's than fancier Wahoo Fish Taco's. The decor much nicer than WFT. Not quite elegant, but nicer than cozy.  They had what read as a nice non-alcoholic mocktail. Muddled blackberries, coconut water, \"lightly sweetened\" and a touch of mint. Sounded amazing, so I ordered it. I KNEW, I knew I should have asked about the sweetener, but I didn't.....and I didn't care for it. The waiter said it was a simple syrup but I've never tasted a simple syrup with such a weird taste. Also, nothing in that description would lead one to believe it's tea...but it's brown. Had it referenced tea, I would not have tried since I only like unsweetened tea. Anyway, on to the food!  We started with the humus appetizer. I enjoyed that A LOT. Very tasty humus, garnished with roasted cherry tomatoes', golden raisins (I swear, I dont like raisins, but I think I'm just kidding myself. I LOVE when they are added as an ingredient!) and some seed (not sunflower) on top. It is served with a salty like flat bread. I really liked this. I'd come back just for this! For lunch, I ordered the fish sandwich; tilapia. It was better than OK, but not good. There was nothing wrong with it, but it didn't say WOOOOW either. I got the asian cole slaw and, to me, there was NOTHING asian about it except the chinese cabbage. They sweeten it waaaay too much, which is odd, since I really like a sweeter cole slaw. I think they are very heavy when they sweeten something here. I wanted to like the slaw, but I only had a few bites as it was just toooooooo sweet for me. (what's happening to me? next I wont like chocolate???)  Our server was Jason and he was nice and friendly. Drinks and food came out pretty quick. He checked on us occasionally to see if we needed anything else. The manager stopped by our table, looked like he was gonna say something, and walked away....kinda weird.  Anyway, I will definitely come back, at least for the humus. Nothing else on the menu really jumped out at me but man, that humus. That was good."}
{"text":"It's a chain that serves mediocre food at affordable prices. The corn chowder with crab ($7.30) was light on crab, but tasted alright. The wagyu beef and ginger dumplings ($8.90) come six to an order. Not bad, but too busy with all the ingredients. The Maryland crab cake dinner ($17.30) wasn't bad. The two crab cakes had little filling which allowed the sweetness of the crab to shine. The veggies that it came with were an afterthought. We got a side of their butternut squash ravioli, which was ok. The wood-grilled lobster tail ($7.90) was cooked and seasoned well."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar and was greeted by Patricia. She was friendly and on point! The food was awesome and came out in a timely manner. I had the cod feature with green beans and spaghetti squash! It was yummy!  Great food and great prices."}
{"text":"I went to the Bonefish grill on Sunday.  I am a fan of the chain since I have had the service in many locations.  So I thought let me try the Charlotte, NC location.  Pros:  1. Brittany my server she was pleasant and attentive to customer needs.  2.  The ambiance is the standard for the chain.  Cons:1.  location.  2.  When I redeemed my born day reward I was surprised about the portions.  The additional food, Crème Brulee French toast I ordered was okay.  I guess after eating the same dish in the NOLA then this was a disappointment.  Mind you last year this time I was in another state and the portions were great.  Next year I will not go to this location and I know I will not be returning to this location.  I had to give it a try and well now you have it, my review that is."}
{"text":"I came with friends for their brunch. I ordered the eggs benedict but substituted avocado for the ham.   The dish came with a broken hollandaise sauce, brown avocado, and eggs over poached. To be fair, they were able to put an English muffin in the toaster and toast it, but otherwise, they failed in every aspect of the meal.   If you're a chef and your emulsion breaks, you can start a fresh batch or try to re-emulsify the sauce. But what you cannot do, if you have any standards, is simply pour a broken chunky sauce over the dish and send it out. Because the assumption is either I am too stupid to know what you are doing or you just couldn't care less about what you serve to your customers.   For twenty dollars for a meal, you damn well better make a hollandaise sauce right and if you can't, an apology and correction better be forthcoming."}
{"text":"Very good experience. Lamb chops not quite as tasty as last time  lobster great, drinks great"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I have nothing nice to say about this restaurant.  I ordered a house salad to start and most of it was yellowish, ice-berg lettuce, my husbands was dark-green leafy lettuce, fresh looking and way better tasting than mine.  I ordered a raspberry martini and when it came out it smelled funny.  When the server finally came back to the table she asked if there was something wrong with it and I said it smelled weird and didn't taste at all like raspberry.  She said that they put egg whites to make it frothy and it was something new they were trying.....thank goodness I wasn't allergic to eggs since it didn't mention anything about egg whites on the menu.  I pretty much had an egg martini.  I got a new one but not until I was almost done with my meal.  The food was good, fish & steak cooked really well, but not for a final bill of almost $100.00 This place has consistently been bad and we will not be back for any reason.  Bonefish Grill should really keep up on their Yelp reviews.  When you find a front parking space at a restaurant at 6:30 on a friday night, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"This was an awesome first time experience the food  was so delicious and the drinks are amazing especially durning Wednesday happy hour"}
{"text":"I typically don't trash a place, unless I have a specific  Four Friends dinner tonight was very disappointing Calamari was less than average  Edemame tasteless The Ceviche had nothing to do with Ceviche,seriously NOTHING The fish and ships was so soggy , had to return it  The tuna sashimi was OK The fish tacos OK Hence the 2 stars rather than one The drinks and cocktails were good though  Definitely not recommended !"}

{"text":"I am originally from Frisco Texas and they have a few locations in the metroplex, so I am used to the upscale decor and the food quality from the other chains. Bonefish Grill was founded in January 2000 in St. Petersburg, Florida, Bonefish Grill is a seafood restaurant with almost 200 locations in 34 states, our knowledgeable waitress told us.   The menu includes grouper, tilapia, lobster tail, mahi mahi, Chilean sea bass, rainbow trout and salmon, all cooked over a wood-burning grill.  The only other Bonefish Grill in Wisconsin is in the Milwaukee suburb of Brookfield. If you have younger children, Duncan recommends arriving earlier in the evening. Happy hour is from 4PM-6:30PM Sunday through Thursday.   When seated, the kids received a Bonefish Kids Adventure Menu and a pack of crayons. As someone who has traveled all over the country and dined at more restaurants than I can accurately remember, kudos to Bonefish Grill for nailing this one on the head.   I'm usually weary of seafood restaurants in non-coastal states, but Bonefish pleasantly surprised me with its dishes, even thought I have been to the locations back home. Overall I enjoyed most of the menu items.   You have to try the Bang Bang Shrimp, crispy, tossed in a creamy, spicy sauce. Simply delicious for only $10.50."}
{"text":"The wife and I go up to the Independence, Ohio one all the time. We don't mind the trip. So when we saw one was opening here we flipped!!!  We went a couple weeks after opening. Going in, I knew it was not going to be perfect. No biggie. When we walked in, the girl the took our names was, putting it bluntly, a bitch to us and, as we waited at the bar, to other people as well. Didn't care or too good for that.... We waited for about forty five minutes for a table. No biggie. We got a table, had a wonderful dinner  and could not wait to go back. The place lost a star because of her.   Fire her and you get five stars from me. Totally unprofessional. I was going to say something to the manager but I didn't want to ruin the mood."}
{"text":"First time in the Cleveland area and decided to have dinner at BFG. The wait time was around 20-30 min, luckily we had friends holding seats for us in the bar. I don't remember our waitresses name but she was really nice and took care of our group. Wait times for food and drinks was not bad. We had crab cakes and calamari appetizers which were both great. For my entree I ordered Salmon with mashed potatoes and broccoli. Salmon was cooked perfect, charred just right on the outside. If you're a seafood person, this place is great. This place was a little more crowded than other places in the area during the week, but not overly crowded."}
{"text":"What can I say this place will always be a favorite in my book.  Seafood done at its best.  Your experience here will wow you in every aspect from the food to the drinks and the service, its an all around amazing experience.  When you come make sure to have room for all three courses. While I agree with everyone yes the bang bang shrimp is a staple if not THE staple for Bonefish Grill please kindly open your options to some of the other amazing items on the menu because if you haven't branched out you're doing yourself a disservice.  For starters the tuna sashimi appetizer is THE BEST one I have ever had in charlotte and believe me if I go out to eat and its offered I'm eating it no exceptions.  Its always perfectly seared and served with wasabi ginger soy sriracha and a perfect white sashimi sauce. Also if youre a fan of mussels this is always a win here also.   Now on to the main course, they have an amazing selection of fish which is not limited to your average tilapia, salmon and trout. While they have these on the menu and they are some of the best sellers as they are delicious of course don't be afraid to go above and beyond with something like the seabass or the even branch out from the seafood category and try the fontina porkchop. Its to die for. This place perfected seafood but they also have landfood down pat too, from the fontina chop to the lilys chicken.  They also have specialty toppings that will take your entrée to the next level like you wouldn't believe, now these aren't always on the menu so be sure to ask for them. For example try the Imperial style topping that usually comes on the tilapia on the seabass. Basically its a seabass stuffed with shrimp scallops crabmeat gruyere and parmesean cheese then topped with a lemon butter caper sauce.... uh yes please!!  OR if your wanting something lighter try any fish Rheas style, its best on seabass and salmon but honestly compliments fish or steak perfectly its sautéed spinach lump crab meat and a lime tomato garlic sauce.  These are only examples of SOME of the toppings they have,,,,, can you tell I eat here too much? Just ask they have so many options to customize your order and make a delicious meal, that much more outstanding.  Also don't forget to pair your meal with the perfect glass (or bottle) of wine or cocktail they have one of the best wine menus I have seen in a chain restaurant and its ever changing with so many options to choose from.  Also save room for dessert as they have THE BEST coconut pie you have ever tasted served with freshly made whip cream and rum sauce.  They also always have a seasonal dessert, my favs being the chocolate crème brulee and/or the pumpkin crème brulee they have in the fall and winter.  Service is always amazing from the servers and bartenders to the management. Every experience you have here is always special in some way even beyond the food. I can definitely see why there are so many regulars myself included."}
{"text":"We used yelp to find someplace for tonight and Bonefish was our choice. We had the pleasure of having Ashley as our server and not was it a great experience. She took the time to educate us about the menu. Marilynn had the cedar plank salmon and stated was amazing. I had the Waygu hamburger and was so good I could be called a home made burger. Desserts chocolate cream brule and donuts with salted caramel  really good. Only complaint was coffee need little work"}
{"text":"Celebrating my birthday was an epicurean sensation. Our Server, Megan, was pleasant, welcoming and informative . My Moscow Mule was delicious. I ordered Cabia fish. Never had it and loved that it was not fishy. Prepared perfectly with spices, sitting on a grilled pineapple. Sides were spinach  and stringbeans.  Dessert was coconut pie with rum. It was like eating a warm macaroon. Husbands creme brulee was thick and delicious. Complimentary strawberries. A meal I will repeat next visit."}
{"text":"I just finished dinner here, despite the less than stellar reviews. My blood orange Paloma was fantastic. The Bang Bang shrimp were great, and my arctic char was good. It reminds me a lot of salmon. Probably would get a different entree, because I like white fish. Must if all, my service was super. Thanks to Cinnamon and Mandy for the fantastic customer experience!"}
{"text":"I've always been a huge fan of Bonefish Grill mostly because of it's grilled seafood options and course the ever so delicious Bang Bang Shrimp. My sister and I decided to check this location out for lunch. It's located in Carmel Village on Pineville-Matthews Road. The staff was very welcoming and friendly. Food was amazing! We started with the Oysters Rockefeller's that was served on a bed of rock salt which I thought was pretty cool. Be careful as of some of the rock salt may get in your oysters...just in case you're watching out for your salt intake. I got a huge chunk of salt that slipped in the oyster. For my entree, I ordered the Bang Bang Shrimp Tacos with a side of jasmine rice. We had to ask for the bread. I'm sure it had something to do to the fact that the bartender was serving us. Kudos to her for making an exceptional mix of drinks. I ordered the Pomegranate Martini which was served with red grapes on a small skewer. My sister ordered the Apple martini which was out of bounds delicious! I took a sip when she went to the restroom...guess she didn't notice a portion missing from her martini cup. Will definitely order my own at the next Bonefish I visit. Nothing spectacular about this location as it seemed to line up with the other chain restaurants. Food was great, service was great, and atmosphere was awesome."}
{"text":"Had an absolutely delicious meal and drinks. Started with the bang bang shrimp appetizer. It was not what I expected, but in a great way, as it's a mountain of crispy shrimp covered in creamy spicy bang bang sauce. The raspberry vodka Collins was very tasty without being too sweet. For my main meal I had tilapia with mango salsa. The fish was cooked perfect. The salsa added just the right sweet and savory flavor. Our server, Camille, was extra attentive and had great recommendations. You could tell she wanted you to enjoy your meal. The atmosphere of the restaurant was quite boring, but with great food, who cares."}
{"text":"wonderful atmosphere at Bonefish grill in Madison. went there with my family for my birthday this weekend and was graced with a tasty beigner from chef Rob. Treated well by the servers and the food was awesome sauce.!!!!!"}
{"text":"Me and my wife had a terrible experience at this restaurant when we walked in we are seated immediately however it's took a solid 10 minutes to get a waitress we ordered the bang bang shrimp and they came out terrible we also ordered The muscles and they were spoiled. We ordered the salmon and that was great about the only good thing about the night. Might I add waitress barely came to the table, when you're waiting for drinks at a dinner table if technically feels like you're in the Sahara desert without a cup water. We walked in at 5:00 PM sharp and didn't leave until 6:45 I recommend going to the one in Canton. I will never come back to this location again sadly.   Side note: when we complained on the appetizers the manager refused to remove them from the bill even though we did not eat them, and the water glasses was dirty."}
{"text":"Been here twice now.  The food is excellent.  Let me say that again . . . THE FOOD IS EXCELLENT!!!  Service is very good too.  However when they're busy, they're REALLY busy and service can fall off a bit.  But that can happen anywhere.  I would not hold that against them.  We will continue to go back here.   If you haven't been here yet, you need to know 3 words:  Bang Bang Shrimp.  This dish is amazing.  You can't go wrong with any dish at Bonfish Grill.    Now if they would just change their commercials . . ."}
{"text":"Did not expect much from a chain sea food restaurant.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Nice menu, appreciate that they will prepare according to your choice of seasoning.  Good service.  Well prepared food, good portions for price.  Would recommend and return."}
{"text":"Wow.  We had awful service. We didn't get plates to eat our appetizers on and we only had one set of silverware for the longest time.  I don't know if it's because we were the only two minorities being served or what the problem was.  Everyone else was treated nicely and had great service except for the two minority women in the middle.  I was highly uncomfortable and extremely ready to leave this place.  The food was good! The service was horrible. I do not recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"The service was great, and I loved the design of the restaurant and patio! Now to the food----slightly over priced for what you're getting. We had the bang bang shrimp tacos with a side salad and the fish and chips. The bang bang shrimp tacos were good---however, the sauce is creamy and heavy and is begging for some sort of acidic slaw to balance it out. The lettuce on the tacos was not enough to achieve this balance, it needs some vinegar and lemon and a crunchier green--maybe cabbage. The side salad dressing was great, but it was pretty over-dressed."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Bonefish Grill. We ordered the Crab and Corn Chowder with bits of Bacon, Bang Bang Shrimp with spicy sauce, and the House Salad with citrus dressing. Plus I got a Flat Tire, an ice cold bottle that  was only $4.50.  Our total bill was $34.07. The price is just right. The food was pretty good. Service was spot on. We need to join them for Bang Bang Wednesday and get the Bang Bang for 5 bucks. It's lightly beaded shrimp in a light firecracker sauce served on top of a bed of lettuce. It was is not as spicy as they say but  it had a mild favor and fresh tasting shrimp. The house salad came with a Heart of Palm, tomato slices, Romain lettuce and Pumpkin seeds (shelled). Our bartender Will that gave us the real Bonefish story. Go see him for Happy hour. He's a great all around guy, Leave a  good tip. We did.... They treat locals right. More stars to come on a day we have dinner. This was a snack before the movies. PS. They serve Sunday Brunch for less than 20 buck that includes Champagne."}
{"text":"You can't beat the brunch special at Bonefish Grill.  From omelets to Creme Brulee French toast, there are plenty of great food choices....plus bottomless brunch cocktails for only $20! You can even make special requests (such as egg whites only) for no extra charge. Service is a tad slow, but they had quite a crowd to serve.  Get there early and plan to stay and relax."}
{"text":"This is really a 3.5 stars review.  And I feel a little bad about it. The food is good.  But there's something wrong here. You don't feel like you are getting a good value, and not just because it's high-priced. I like high priced! But you want to feel like it's special.  Often, the fish feels like it's okay, not super well prepared, or super fresh. The service is nothing to write home about.  (But the hostesses are quite sweet and are good about greeting you when you come and go).  The decor is nice, perhaps a bit too simple.  Though I am a fan of the silver fish on the wood plank wall! There just seems to be no passion in the food--a lobster tail is just a lobster tail.  A salmon is just a salmon here.  And shrimp is just, well...shrimp.  No attempt is made to elevate these ingredients, or to bring out their \"wild\" sides, or even like, Eric Ripert (Le Bernardin, New York, a fish genius), to make the fish seem like it's the star of every plate.  To be fair, this is a chain.  But honestly, I did not know that the first few times I went here.  That is to their credit.  Best dish I've had here is the dessert: They present (not make in house, unfortunately), a mean Jamaican custard-like pie worth fasting for."}
{"text":"Well, we used to love this place.  Today we both ordered the fish tacos (soft) and it was more than disappointing.  There was literally about an inch of fish in each taco.  We asked the server for more because it was an embarrassing amount inside.  He brought us another very small portion- enough to satisfy one of us.  The manager then came over and said \"we can offer you more if you pay for it.\"  And that \"that is all she can do for us.\"  I should've taken a photo of how small the portion it was- for $13 it is laughable.  The manager had seriously zero customer service skills.  We left and now my husband needs to find something else for dinner.  Very disappointing.  The manager claimed the menu and portions changed.  If that was the case, they needed to inform us as customers when we ordered the product."}
{"text":"It has been quite a few years since I've been to a Bonefish.  I'm super excited that they opened some new restaurants in Concord Mills, and this is a great addition for something new and different for the area!  Just be prepared for the parking situation.  I'm not sure if they really thought that out, as the parking was already terrible in that part of the mall, before adding new restaurants.  I was here on a ladies night with a huge group!  We took up almost the entire outside area, which is a very nice patio.  They have strong heaters which made it bearable, even on a chilly evening.  With a huge group, it's usually never smooth.  Drinks came out randomly, food was sporadically delivered.  I ordered the fish tacos, which were very good.  A friend ordered the shrimp and we traded and I got to try hers.  Now those were amazing!  My order was incorrect- ordered a salad instead of a size- the side showed up and no salad.  The salad showed up so late I didn't want it- and I didn't eat it, and was still charged.  I was not too happy about that at all.  I am also a member of their rewards club and the server did not credit my account, even after asking.  Oh well- I will blame it on our huge group!  The restaurant is very nice, but it's clear that they are still adapting to the new location.  I would try it again, probably on a weeknight so we didn't have to hike across a parking lot!"}
{"text":"I came here with my family for dinner and I really enjoyed the decor and the ambiance of this restaurant. It was nice to go out of the casinos for dinner.  We had a variety of items starting with edamame and bang bang shrimp (very delicious). For dinner, they ordered red snapper, mahi mahi, salmon salad, fish and chips and I was the oddball and got the teriyaki chicken bowl. Everyone loved their food. The chicken was really tender and the sauce wasn't too sweet.   For dessert we all shared a flourless brownie and it was really good. The service was great and we really enjoyed our evening here. It's a nice place to go for dinner to get away from the hustle and bustle of the casinos."}
{"text":"We loved the decor, and the food is probably great, but we didn't eat there. We left after 40 minutes of waiting to be seated, even though we had made a reservation. Terrible service and not very friendly hostesses. What a waste of time ... and we'd had such high hopes for this place."}
{"text":"Bonefish Grill is a staple in every neighborhood. We love to stop here in Fort Myers, and love it just the same, if not even more, in Pittsburgh. We arrived around 6 PM on a busy Friday evening, and we got lucky that another reservation had just canceled and they sat us right away.   Unfortunately, our server was a bit slow throughout the entire meal. It was nice to catch up with family during the long waits though! Everyone in our party enjoyed their drinks and dinner. I'd recommend trying the Chilean sea bass with any sauce, but I especially love the tomato garlic one. It sounded a bit weird to me the first time, but I crave that sauce now. Bonefish does a great seafood!"}
{"text":"Our server was very friendly and welcoming, and upon finding out it was our first visit, his suggestions were spot on for the night, which included the Kate's Haddock. The restaurant was clean, perfectly lit and the staff was all quite friendly.. The food though, was delicious and worth the extra drive out of the way."}
{"text":"I have to say the quality has gone down since my first visit a year ago. I was so happy to see the oscar topping last night as they don't always have it. I was very disappointed, just not the same. Also they gave my husband 2 unripe chocolate covered strawberries for his birthday....REALLY!  Too many great restaurants in this town to keep going here."}
{"text":"Devoted to the creatures of the sea, Bonefish delivers! Always fresh seafood with a twist, making it an eclectic menu yet one you'd be sure to find something appealing. The waiters know our group now and service is excellent."}
{"text":"Didn't care for fish & chips.  Also had the bang bang shrimp.  Nothing special. Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Food was good, staff was friendly. Dip for bread was not good, wait between apps and meal was excessive. Staff tried to make up for wait though."}
{"text":"I often visit this location with my husband and family and I can say over the past few years I have never been disappointed. I am generally happy with the Bonefish chain, but this is my favorite location in Charlotte area. We generally sit and the bar and always get great service there. This visit I had the bang bang shrimp for an appetizer and the lobster stuffed shrimp ( SO GOOD) for dinner."}
{"text":"I'm excited Bonefish has come to the Concord Mills area. It's always nice to have variety of places to choose from after a day of shopping. This location does not disappoint or waver from the Bonefish standard of serving excellent food. This visit I enjoyed my favorite dish : lobster stuffed shrimp, which now comes with two sides. I highly recommend the house salad. Who says that right? But listen, I believe this is Bonefish's salad that comes with the tastiest citrus vinegrette."}
{"text":"We were so looking forward to our first visit until we were seated AND ignored on a very slow evening.  Although we counted servers that passed us 20 times (!) we couldn't place a drink order even after asking a server. Upon walking out, the host retrieved the manager. She offered us free meals but wouldn't apologize.  Why would we want free meals if we couldn't get waited on?"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful for Sunday Brunch!  Also it's a great place to go with your girlfriends to catch up over a Sunday brunch with all you can drink Mimosas, Bellinis and Sangrias! I would recommend to anyone! It's super nice inside too!"}
{"text":"This was our first time at this establishment. The drinks were tasty but a bit overpriced. I ordered the large portion ($30.00) of Chilean Sea bass with two sides. When the plate arrived my sea bass was about as flat as a pancake and on the small side of the scale. The taste was good but was expecting that thick cut filet that one expects when ordering Chilean sea bass. I informed our server of my disappointment and was hoping she would have informed the chef or manager. No one came over to address my concerns. Needless to say I don't think we will be returning due to he lack of quality of food for the price that was paid."}
{"text":"I tried a piece of my buddies Bang Bang Shrimp that he had ordered Togo and I had to go right then and there! I can't wait to go back and have a nice date night with the lady."}
{"text":"Run don't walk to a different restaurant. I travel to this area for work quite often and I've now tried Bonefish 4 times hoping it would get better.  The service is really slow and disorganized. The food is typically flavorless and in 3 cases now it's either been undercooked or overcooked.  Worst of all? Traveling after getting food poisoning from the food.  This has happened twice now after eating at this Bonefish.  I'm done, not trying it again, not risking my life for a chain restaurant with mediocre service and horrible food."}
{"text":"This place is Fab in every way. I've dined at the original Henderson site, Townsquare and Charleston in Vegas, Grand Rapids MI, Orlando and give Bonefish 5 stars at all 4. Manager Marcus Powers and his staff at Town Square are always cheerful and efficient and the food fresh and well presented. They are exceptional at group events and I've seen it at several parties and meetings.  Bonefish is my go to place to dine. Of course Bang Bang shrimp is a must have, but the chowder leaves me pretty happy, too."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner one night, as this is close to home ad I had been wanting to try it.  The restaurant was practically empty, but the host asked if we had reservations and then acted as if it was going to be tough to seat us if we didn't. He then said that since we didn't have reservations he would only be able to seat us right away if we sat on the patio.  I figured a private party must be coming in, but even when we finished dinner the restaurant was still mostly empty.  I had the lobster, and it was the smallest, worst lobster I have ever eaten. We will not be returning to Bonefish Grill!"}
{"text":"Some very good food and nice atmosphere.   A little loud, very busy. The bang bang shrimp is very good as others have pointed out.   The calamari was average.  Calamari-nothing to brag up nor order again but it wasn't too chewy and had a nice coating.   I expected more flavor and have had some at other places that were much better.   The Ahi Tuna was delicious.  The Chilean Sea Bass was delicious with a nice delicate crust.   I could have used more sauce with mine.  Next time I will ask for more.  Meals are cheap but some dishes are more affordable.  The menu is not large and pretty easy to order from.  Pretty good service but it could have been better.   Our meal came to 155 with tip for 4 people with four drinks, two appetizers and four entrees."}
{"text":"I'm here with my cousin Schula and I'm her guest here in Las Vegas I just drove in today from Ontario California and she suggested this place awesome we got full on appetizers Christian she is the bomb ass server come and ask for her great smile great service you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Yum yum. My hubby and I went to this restaurant last night and thoroughly enjoyed it.  A person we met in the morning recommended it and said we HAD to get the bang bang shrimp.   They had a special for $50 for two which included the bang bang shrimp,  a choice of about 6 entrees and a dessert to share. The bang bang shrimp was delicious.  The shrimp is crunchy and covered with a slightly spicy sauce. It is served on a bed of lettuce. There are a lot of shrimp!   Hubby had the lobster stuffed shrimp with creamed spinach. I had the rockafeller cobia. I had not heard of this fish and the server described it perfectly. It was to die for! So flavorful! I had it with green beans and jasmine rice.   We shared a HUGE strawberry shortcake for dessert.  I was stuffed and brought home about 1/3 of my dinner.  (I needed to save room for dessert,  right? )  Our server,  Joe,  was fantastic. When we told him it was our first time there,  he explained the menu and gave us his recommendations. When we told him we would definitely be back, he said he had been there since they opened so he would probably see us again.   All in all, a great dining experience."}
{"text":"Food was fine but the service was GREAT! Thank you to Dwayne, the best server at Bone Fish Grille! He was very attentive and engaging. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night. Their website made it very easy to make reservations before hand. We came right before 5 so it wasn't really needed. By the time we were done though it was definitely getting busy.  The service was good. The prices weren't horrible. The food was amazing. We shared a Hawaiian martini,  which if it wasn't so expensive we could have went for a couple more of them! My husband got the shrimp with coconut risotto. It tasted great and there were more shrimp in there than we realized. I got the pesto salmon which was cooked perfectly.  Only complaint is when we paid,  it took forever for me to get my card back. Not sure what the hold up was. I did have a paper gidtcard so I'm not sure if that was the problem?  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Food and service were both fantastic, but its what happened the next day that set them apart. I was on business from Dallas, TX and left my corporate credit card on the table. I didn't realize it until I got to the airport the next day and I called them. I identified it and they were kind enough to place it in the mail and I received it today. That SAVED me. I leave in 3 days for another trip and it wasn't enough time to to get a new one. THANK YOU...THANK YOU!!!"}
{"text":"First time coming.. which is odd I don't know why I've never went but I'll definitely be back. Came in about an hour til close and sat at the bar. It's really cute inside. The lights were low. The bartender was the best part aside from the food which was awesome. As 11 o'clock came around I was kind of sad we had to go but I'll definitely be back for more food :)"}
{"text":"Just had lunch here and thought the food was ok. Some items have two portion sizes on them which gives the server a great opportunity to up sell the guest. The problem is they don't ask. The server just automatically gave us the large portion of everything, which is not what we wanted. Now that I know their tricks I will pay more attention IF I actually go back."}
{"text":"Great for Date Night and Happy Hour!  Happy Hour: Happy Hour is on point! The portions are generous, \"happily\" priced and the seasonal cocktails are always a safe choice. They also offer warm bread and dipping oil while at the bar. Both of the slider options are amazing and have large portions of wagu/fish.  Dinner: I've come for dinner on valentines day and on a normal week day. They do fill up on the weekends for the dinner rush so try to make a reservation or dine early and definitely need one on valentines day. I usually order off the seasonal or special menu for fish.   Service: Always great service. The hosts are pleasant and give generous wait times so you're seated quickly. The waiters are very knowledgeable of the menu and have always given great recommendations."}
{"text":"I've visited Bonefish for multiple occasions including a romantic valentines dinner as well as casual happy hour after work. It's a really versatile space for different dining occasions and has a menu that will please both fish and meat lovers.   If dining in at the restaurant side for a date night: Portions sizes are not too heavy but not gypped  Recommend 2-3 sides for the table to share (for 2) Wine and beer are reasonably priced (IPA about $6) Check online for their specials going on Make a reservation if going on a weekend for dinner  If having a casual drink for happy hour after work: Check online for their specials (Monday Martini $5) Can order the full menu at the bar TVs at the bar so you can catch a game The fish or beef sliders plus an edamame to share is enough to fulfill your dinner needs  *Currently their watermelon martini is worth trying!"}
{"text":"Tuesday night is  specials night!  I had a 6oz Lobster tail for 18.99 w/ soup and Salad and 2 sides. We had a great dinner for about 50.00 Better than Red Lobster.  The only exception is, they don't have those cheese biscuits."}
{"text":"Service good but not great. Ambiance was nice and inviting. Food was awesome. Friends called the mussels the best they ever had. The dumplings were tasty, steak cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"I took my fiancé here last Friday night and it was amazing!!  The food and the drinks were superb!  The menu is diverse and the drinks are delicious.  We enjoyed ourselves very much."}
{"text":"Quality is awesome.  Service was great, specially since we were a large group celebrating a birthday. Not a single mistake in our order, now that's impressive.  Appetizers were very good, good amount and cooked to perfection. The staff was very cordial, well trained, and showed a lot of professionalism. Congratulations to the entire management!!!!!"}
{"text":"We used to love Bonefish at the Henderson location and we were sad when it closed. Then, we were thrilled to find it again at Towne Square. We enjoyed our usual fave dishes until lately. The quality of the food and been consistently going downhill. We recently tried the Bonefish at this location (on West Charleston) 3 times and were disappointed each time!!!  The coconut shrimp is not as flavorful as in previous years.  The mussels are consistently off-flavored now (my friend even complained on a separate occasion that most of the shells were empty!). The salmon also had an off-flavor. The shrimp and scallop dinner was totally devoid of flavor and the scallops were slimy. The side dish of rice was awful. I recommend the green beans ~~ ONLY, the green beans.  We received a coupon in the mail for a free entree with the purchase of another. The restaurant was pretty empty. We now know why. Very sad our favorite restaurant has come to this."}
{"text":"My wife and I got food poisoning from the bang bang shrimp. Beware. Corporate had no response other than to spam me with email special desks. They are non responsive to social media it seems are not in tune with customer service."}
{"text":"One of my favorite lunch destinations and so this review is based on my lunch experience alone. This location is convenient to the many errand spots and stops one must accomplish during the day so I usually feel somewhat rewarded when Bonefish Grill ends up being the last stop over my lunch break.  My first impression while entering through their revolving door was that this place feels smooth and looks inviting.  We were promptly greeted by the hostess and then were led through the warmly lit dining room to the most comfortable, cushiony booth ever!  The dining room was fairly busy with an active lunch crowd yet I quickly noticed how pleasantly peaceful the sound level was even with all the conversations around me going in full tilt.  How relaxing and refreshing not to have to shout to your dining partner.  We were warmly greeted by our server who was wearing a very nicely pressed professional looking waiters jacket as did the other servers and bar staff. Nice touch.  While glancing through the menu I immediately realized that an overabundance of delightful choices lie ahead of me!  Not your same old same old lunch options at all.   Great appetizer listings include things like the Bang Bang Shrimp, PEI mussels, lamb lollipop chops, fresh oysters and much more. There are soups like lobster bisque, or corn chowder and lump crab. The menu also features wedge salads, cobb salads, cilantro lime shrimp salad, Fresh fish of the day, Sandwiches such as BFG fish, Kobe beef burger, Bang Bang Shrimp tacos.  Too much to list but if choosing is hard to do then there is always the lunch combo.  The lunch combos allow you to go with a soup and salad, or the soup or salad and wrap, or soup or salad and soft tacos and are all under $10.00.  All in all lunch at the Bonefish Grill is a first class experience at an affordable price."}
{"text":"\"Caitlin B\" was by far the worst server Ive ever encountered. I'm not sure if it was because of our appearances we were a younger couple and family but she had a bad attitude toward us since the moment she walked up. I have been a server for 5 years from high end steak house to bar and grill, and I would have never got away with treating a table the way she did . Being my first time and bonefish I wasn't real sure what all was on the menu but we wanted to just go ahead and order cause we had a movie to be to in just a little bit , so I had saw fish tacos and asked which were the best she personally liked, she paused for a good 5 seconds before saying \"uhhhh there's only one kind\" I apologized as I just wasn't sure sometimes there is different kinds, when my husband went to order he didn't know he could get two different sides , as I looked up I saw her rolling her eyes as she asked what else he wanted .. Anytime we thanked her for our drinks or anything we never got any type of response, never got a smile or anything nice so we felt welcome. The booth beside of us of (an elderly couple) she was being completely different to as I started watching after my husband and I looked at eachother and were saying how rude she was.. She was smiling at them checking on them, making sure everything was great etc. last but not least , we were sitting in a booth with direct vision into the kitchen, as I was watching her get our food together , and she switched plates because some had gotten hot as I could see, without ever seeing her go wash her hands she grabbed a handful of fries from one plate setting it on the other that we were eating.. In total disgust and Awh I watched to see if she actually was going to set it down for me to eat, and she did.. So I did not touch my fries ... As I was looking for a manager to talk to no one came by my table , so I went on to eat the tacos , and I needed a different hot sauce than the one Caitlin had set down originally. Mind you it was completely empty in the restaurant other than 6-7 tables . So finally I caught the hostess who was cleaning a table and asked her is they had a different hot sauce , she said she'd go back to check and came back with another one . We didn't see Caitlin again until we were finished and she asked us if we wanted our check, but we watched her in the kitchen laughing amongst other employees talking the whole time we were eating except when she checked on the table next to us... We paid the bill and left and told my sister about the experience whom advised I complain to a manager , but I didn't see one and just wanted to leave after that experience and said I'd email someone ... I have never left a negative review in my life, being a waitress I get we all have bad days , but it didn't seem that way.. That was hands down the worst experience I've ever had & have never been treated so horribly and felt so uncomfortable or disgusted .. I will honestly never be back and never go to another bonefish."}
{"text":"This place recently opened near my home and we went out to give it a try. It was yummy, and the restaurant was really nice. We sat outside, and it was really enjoyable. We tried an appetizer and entrees and the food was great. It was a little more on the pricey side to make it a regular place to eat out for me but I would love to come for special occasion or when family/friends are in towns overall I'm glad we have a modern seafood restaurant close by!"}
{"text":"Our dinner was delicious and very reasonably priced.  I ordered my usual house salad and the coconut shrimp appetizer to be served as an entree' and my wife ordered the trout.  The service by Cecelia and the added attention by Kari Kelly' Managing Partner added another layer of enjoyment to our meal.  Our only complaint is the chain's unwillingness to open a location closer to us.  Oh well, we will survive and continue to make the trek to this location."}
{"text":"What can I say? It has to be me. On my last visit I started with a scotch and soda cocktail from the bar. The server brought me a scotch with cola mix. My bad, I was not clear enough. Frankly, I don't think he even knew what scotch was. I then ordered a Rockfish dinner special they were running that night. I was looking forward to it as I had not eaten Rockfish before. When our dinner was served they brought me a Salmon dinner. At first I was confused as I did not know what Rockfish looked like. Two bites and I knew it did not look and taste like Salmon.  I confirmed with my guests as to whether I said one thing and meant another and they all confirmed that I had indeed ordered the Rockfish dinner special. Now that dinner had been served our server disappeared and I had to eventually get up and find someone who could straighten this out. Meanwhile, I requested that everyone start eating before their food got cold. My correct entrée came out later. Awkward. For the record I was not starving as we had started with a couple of appetizers.  Also, the waitstaff was apologetic and  our server provided us with a complementary dessert for the party to share. Fair enough. I enjoy the location and the ambiance is nice. I just seem to have a hard time with either the food (drinks) and/or service at this location. I can only attribute it to a high degree of turn over in their staff. I guess the thing for me to do is to order a beer and stay with their stalwart Bang Bang Shrimp."}
{"text":"A good value for dinner for two. We did the $55 special which included an appetizer, two entrees and a dessert to share. Hawaiian Orchid Martini was amazing. Food was a little heavy on the salt/seasoning, but other than that, server was great and quick."}
{"text":"Yep a bit pricey but what I love about Bonefish Grill is when they say your Mahi Mahi is grilled - they really mean it.  It isn't breaded and grilled and soaked in butter (ahem...like the 'grilled' shrimp and scallops at.Carrabas!  grrrr!!)  But it is just great fish plainly grilled.  I love that.  They offer a choice of sauce - for those that need sauce.  The Chimichurri sauce is my favorite - simple and not overpowering  - mostly just parsely.  The grilled entrees come with a choice of a side - I love the scalloped potatoes.  It is a ton of food so prepare yourself to take some home!    The atmosphere is cozy for a chain, low lighting with booths and tables.  A little more upscale than you would think.    The Bang Bang Shrimp is a fantastic app, there is a bit of spice to it which I LOVE!!  I think Wednesdays they have a special on this app?  It is definitely enough shrimp to be an entire meal.  Huge shrimp, perfectly seasoned on a bed of lettuce.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Food was average. Small portion sizes which left me hungry when I finished. My fiancés Mac n cheese had a thick piece of plastic in it which almost broke my tooth. Definitely not worth the money."}
{"text":"Came here with my husband only because we had a gift card. It sounded like a cool place, but it really isn't. When you first walk up there is a big revolving door that can only fit one person at a time.. Kind of obnoxious and although it looks really nice the food is your run of the mill average food you get at any other chain restraunt. All of the front of house staff wear chef coats...maybe back of house wears collared button up shirts? It didn't really make any sense. We shared the calamari which was ok. It was a little chewy but I've had worse elsewhere. I ordered fish and chips and my husband had a burger which the server didn't ask how he wanted it cooked and even though he told her medium it came out well done. You would think with a name like \"bonefish\" the fish and chips would be decent. Not the case here, just your average frozen fish stick with some soggy fries tossed on a plate. Definitely not impressed but would have been more upset if we actually had to pay for it."}
{"text":"Yelp 100 Challenge 2013- 19/100  3 Words: Bang! Bang! Shrimp! - It will rock your socks off. Seriously, the Bang Bang Shrimp app and Key lime pie dessert are worth the trip alone. I Pinky Promise...   All in all, Bonefish is consistent.... which is a big deal to me when dining someplace multiple times. My love and I try to come here every few months on a date night and have enjoyed every appetizer, drink, entree and dessert we've ordered.   During my last visit, we ordered: Bang Bang Shrimp, Salmon (with lemon butter sauce), Rainbow Trout (with lemon butter sauce), Key Lime Pie, Spiked Blackberry Elixir (Malibu rum, blackberries, sage, fresh lemon juice + coconut water for $5), and their Classic Sidecar & Mango Twist (Amber brandy, mango + sugared rim $5).  The service, food, and atmosphere were all top notch. I would even push my review to 4 1/2 stars.    TIP: Wednesdays at Bonefish is $5 bang bang shrimp= ALL NIGHT.  Also, they have a great happy hour menu (see pic) that runs 4:00pm - 6:30pm Sun- Thurs."}
{"text":"This is a really nice, classy little seafood joint. The bar area is huge, and has alot of seat yourself tables. So you could probably just walk in any time. The dining room is very nice and the food was great. Its a mainly seafood menu, with an emphasis on fish. There are about 8 different types of fish to choose from and several different sauces, and ways to prepare them. The appetizers were all very good too.  The fish portions were also very large. I dont think anyone in my party actually finished what they ordered. I had the Hawaiian sailfish with bacon and gorgozola cheese, and it was very tasty. It was off the specials menu, so might not be around anymore, but the standard menu looked very good too.  I liked it and will go back next time I'm in the mood for (cooked) Fish...best I have found in the Green Valley area."}
{"text":"Wow. What a bad dinner. They have this service program where everyone serves all the tables which would work if there was communication among the staff and if some of the staff could stop hanging out with one table. Ordered tomato soup, got a half filled bowl of thick salty salsa that looked as if someone had eaten some of it already-although I can't imagine why. Had to call a manager over because none of the team of servers was available. She said, \"Oh, I know what happened. It was the bottom of the pot.\" I asked why they would even serve it. She shrugged. We asked 3 times for a glass of wine. I eventually went to the bar and got it myself. The only reason they are getting 2 stars is because the shrimp appetizer was good and my wife's sea bass was very good. But it was a small piece of fish for $27! Not going back."}
{"text":"Nice place to get something on draft with the fish and chips, coconut shrimp and Maryland style-crab cakes. Love having a good seafood option that is fresh. Friendly service, good atmosphere. Will be back."}
{"text":"Took my daughter to Crocker Park for shopping and a bite to eat and ended up at bonefish grill @ Crocker Park....have been to different Bonefish Restaurants over the years and I have found that each is different, quality of food, service, atmosphere and overall quality of experience....We ventured in on a Saturday afternoon and decided to sit on the patio....which I recommend, big patio, great for people watching and can't beat it on a summer day!! I started with the Bang Bang Shrimp...as many of you know, this is a staple as a starter at BF, tower of lightly fried shrimp, seasoned (I believe it's a mixture of hot sauce and sriracha) over a bed of greens...do yourself a favor and order it!! It pairs nicely with your favorite cocktail as well.....I ordered the grouper with a hollandaise sauce fries and creamed spinach....my daughter ordered the salmon, with fried gnocchi, and a mixture of vegetables....Service was outstanding, server was sweet and took the time to explain the dishes to my daughter.....dinner came out and it was delicious....my grouper was spot on....don't normally order grouper, but it's a mild fish normally found in Atlantic(regular item on menus in Florida), the grouper was a lightly grilled with just enough hollandaise sauce to take it over the top : )) creamed spinach was average at best, can make a better version at home myself....my daughter's salmon came out and it was pretty, big hunk of salmon, cooked to perfection, in a mixed medley of blanched veggies and fried gnocchi, nice combo...I would definitely order either dish when I return....The ambiance and environment at this particular Bonefish was excellent....inside was more upscale, bar was big and vey nice in case you want to get a drink and again the patio is bomb!! For dessert, ordered a Key Lime Pie which is what I normally order at seafood restaurants...Pie was ok, not much pie, more crust and have had many KL pies that were over the top...Overall had a great time, our dinner was delicious, and the environment at the Crocker Park Bonefish is pretty sweet....do yourself a favor and try it out on a nice summer evening or afternoon....: ))"}
{"text":"FRESH!  That is the word of the day here at this restaurant.  The fish is so tasty that it was obviously swimming around in the water, very recently.  One of the best parts about the restaurant (aside from the deliciousness of the dinners) is the price.  Instead of going to Bartalotta's at Wynn and spending $200 a person, you can go to Bonefish and really indulge there for a mere $100 per couple (including everything).  So, when it comes down to it - both places give you super-fresh fish, but only one gets it to you at a great price.  I love this place and am hoping to visit there (and eat) again soon.  Kudos to Bonefish!!"}
{"text":"Took my wife and daughter there tonight for valentine's dinner. We were not impressed at all, the calamari app was pretty good but my wife got the sea scallops and shrimp and was not crazy about it. I got the steak and crab cake. The crab cake was the size of a 50 cent piece and the steak was tiny and a bit over cooked. Also they never brought us any bread out."}
{"text":"Hands down, \"go to\" choice for a better dining experience than most in the Metro area. The fish is grilled impeccably every time!"}
{"text":"Great food, service and drinks. Great place to unwind after work. I recommend the Mussels  Josephine starter and the Pomegranate Mango Martini."}
{"text":"First time being here, and it wasn't the greatest. Service wasn't very good. Forgot to make a salad and food came out late. Our waiter disappeared and we had to ask another for service. Her name was Whitney and I would recommend her the next time you come. Food was decent, steak was cooked too rare but had good seasoning. Seafood was delightful."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and pretty decent food. Excellent service, we had a pretty large group but we were we'll attended to. Waiters look like chefs, super professional. I don't know about eating here for dinner, the fish entrees were alright but not amazing. I would def come back for the appetizers. Wagyu dumplings: awesome.  Shrimp is like half off on Wednesdays so better to take advantage of that. Decent prices on beers and cocktails. Great place for appetizers and drinks."}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoyed the best dinner and had the best service for our date night out at this location. The service was impeccable and the food was amazing! The rainbow trout was grilled to perfection. The sides were not overly drenched in butter. Everything had a fresh flavorful taste. Now the best part was the wild orchid Hawaiian martini! Smooth, tasty perfection. They deserve 10 stars!"}
{"text":"The service was excellent! However, we ordered the New England Style Lobster Roll. I have consumed this classic in New England proper as well many other spots throughout my culinary adventures. Their version (or the version the chef felt compelled to put their personal spin on) had wasabi in the mixture and it threw off the entire dish completely. Separately, I love these two but a dish should be advertised as \"a take on a classic\" rather than crush the real deal (and my craving for a familiar taste). It's a chain, and sometimes that's what you get. Nonetheless, I think I'll be getting my Lobster Rolls elsewhere moving forward."}
{"text":"So I met a friend here for lunch the other day and was pretty excited that she picked this place for us.  I have been to Bonefish Grill before but not this one off of Rockside.  The lunch hour traffic for the restaurant is very light.  I was seated right away when I came in.  They put us in the bar area for our meal, so our waitress was the bartender.  When she came over to stop by the table she was very friendly and nice, which I always appreciate.  As I was waiting for my friend to arrive, I ordered the edamame as a starter.  This dish was ok but I probably won't order it again.  Once my friend I arrived I ordered the house salad, steamed broccoli, and jasmine rice.  Let me tell you!!!  That jasmine rice is quite delicious.  I have been dreaming about it since I had it.  During our time at the restaurant my friend pointed out how the waitress/bartender wasn't really attentive to our table and I would have to agree.  We had to call her over and even walk up to the bar to get her attention.  Outside of that, it was a good experience.  I highly suggest it for lunch/dinner and a date.  It can be pricey but the food is good and they offer some great drinks."}
{"text":"Went for lunch before taking our family to the airport.  Don't waste your time.  Fish and chips fish batter was runny inside.  Waiter was nice but oblivious to needs had to ask for many things including bill.  Food took over 30 minutes to receive.  Really at lunch with eight tables full thirty minutes.  Never once asked us how food was or how our meals tasted.  Nothing.    I'd give them no stars if I could."}
{"text":"Try the Bang Bang Shrimp. Just do it. It's worth it. It's basically fried shrimp in an amazingly delicious creamy spicy sauce. They have it as an appetizer and as tacos. The tacos are pretty great too.   I've also had the surf and turf with filet mignon and lobster tail and it was also amazing. All of the food I've had here had always been very very good.   The one piece of constructive criticism I would give would be that the customer service could use a little fine tuning  (outside of one really tall server - he was awesome! - I forgot his name). It took a while for us to be helped the last few times we've been (the first couple times we went, we sat in the tall guy's section)."}
{"text":"Went here last night for dinner. The service was excellent, but the food was mediocre.  The salmon was cooked adequately, but the sides sucked. The rice was gummy and tasted like it had been sitting in the pot for hours. The grilled vegetables were over cooked and soggy. The plate presentation was of poor quality. I was sort that I hadn't gone to the grocery store and cooked my own dinner."}
{"text":"My first and last dining experience at Bonefish. The food was good but the dining experience overall was a disappointment. From the hostess to our server. Both were not friendly or welcoming. I'm a server and a low maintenance diner and I was compelled to write this review upon leaving. We actually wanted to leave after sitting there for 10 minutes with out any service while the table behind us who sat down shortly after us had drinks and bread from the same hostess that sat us. We stayed because we really wanted to try it out and optimistic that service would improve. Caitlin B served us and seemed to be friendlier to the other 2 tables she had. For this treatment I can not understand. She didn't say \" you're welcome\" when I said thank you and spoke very little to us, cold shouldered. The only reason I give this 2 stars is for Curtis who was quick to find assistance and was pleasant to interact with. Thank you Curtis.   So if you're looking for a positive and friendly dining experience, I can't recommend coming here."}
{"text":"My husband and I tend to stick with our regular lunch/dinner spots and rarely try new places as we're often disappointed. However, after checking out the Bonefish Grill menu (with pictures) I was certainly enticed by all their seafood options and thrilled that they had a non-seafood appetizer I thought my Hubby would be interested in trying.   Last Saturday we decided to give it try for lunch. Upon arrival we were warmly greeted and told we would be seated momentarily. It wasn't busy but the hostess needed to cleared off a booth for us.  Shortly thereafter we were greeted by our server whose white shirt was a mish-mish of food stains~ not sure if he had been helping out in the kitchen or what. He was very polite and answered our questions although got confused when we were asking about portion sizes.   Since we had already checked out the menu on line we knew pretty much what we wanted to order: oysters, crab cakes and Wagyu beef potstickers for appetizers then a steak with garlic mashed potatoes & Truffle mac & cheese for my Hubby while I had Chilean sea bass with mango salsa, steamed broccoli and crab fried rice. Overall, everything was very enjoyable: my oysters came with fresh raw horseradish instead of the creamy sauce, the Chilean sea bass was perfect with the mango salsa and my Hubby's steak, although ordered well done, was not a dry charcoal briquette as it sometimes is when he orders is meat well done.  The only real disappointments were my Hubby's garlic mashed potatoes that just seemed to have an odd texture and my crab fried rice that just had shards of crab sprinkled on top. I don't think there was even a tablespoon of crab meat thought the dish.   During our meal I noticed several other tables with bread and dipping oil.. I was already too full but wondered why we were not given any. Later a friend informed me that you have to ask for bread otherwise it will not be served. Geez, since it was our first time you would think they would have asked?!! Anyways, you've been warned--ask if you want bread.   Will we be going back- ABSOLUTELY! And looking forward to it."}
{"text":"We decided to eat here because it replaced our favorite place that was once in it's spot, islands! We happened to get a 10$ off coupon in the mail from them, so we went. We got the bang bang shrimp as an appetizer and it was amazing!! Similar to the shrimp appetizer at steak 44 but not as amazing as theirs. We then shared the salmon dish which they spilt between two plates for us which was really nice! I normally do not eat fish because I never liked it but!! I REALLY enjoyed this dish, it was quite amazing. Over all the atmosphere is beautiful, the service is great, and the food is amazing, but it is a little pricey That being said, we will probably only go back if we have another coupon."}
{"text":"First, let me start by saying how professional the staff at Bonefish Grill is. We were dining here on a weeknight and there was a patron in the bar area that was clearly disturbed and becoming unruly. The manager handled the situation SO WELL. He escorted the man into a cab that he called for the patron all while calmly asking him to leave. There was no screaming or yelling. It was very professional and classy.  Yes, it was a little distracting, but mostly because I was so impressed with the staff. Our meal was delicious (scallop and salmon entree plates and the calamari appetizer). The interior was light and nice for a little romantic dinner.   Parking can be a little insane because the Bonefish Grill is located outside of Concord Mills (not connected or inside). The wait can be LONG at peak mall times, so plan accordingly!"}
{"text":"Tried it out for the first time recently with the family. Shared the dinner for two with my husband. Loved the Bang Bang Shrimp appetizer and my entrée of Rockfish was quite tasty. My husband had the swordfish and only complaint was that it was a little dry. Rest of the family were all happy with their choices as well; they have been here several times."}
{"text":"Tried something new over the weekend with my wife for our date night. Good thing I reserved our seats over the phone because it was such s busy night. I reserved our spot with 1 hr time frame to get ready and head out so that we weren't rushing. They also have text reminders to let you know when your table reservation is ready. Unfortunately even though we were right on time, we still had to wait an additional 30 min to be seated or get a response from a text message. The waiting area was cramped full of hungry people lol. Other than the waiting, my server had utmost unmatched guest service for us throughout our dinner. I apologize for not remembering her name but I left a generous tip for her.   I love the layout of the area. They kept it old school with a revolving entrance door facing a rustic gatsby style bar. Our dining experience was a candle light dinner for the romantic intimacy. They covered the tables with white sheets and disposable paper - I guess it's for the easy cleaning after each brutal food slaughting experience.   To get you prepared in advanced, expect to pay around $100 for the full course dishes from appetizers to dessert. We both started with their famous bang bang shrimp  which was super delicious! I want more!! Then we went straight for the specialties! I had the \"catch of the day\" Mahi Mahi with asparagus, creamy smashed potato, broccoli.  My other half got the lobster stuffed shrimp and fried rice!   I will tell you this!! I will definitely come back for the bang bang shrimp! We skipped the dessert because our course dishes were so filling. For a plate that didn't look big and full, it sure made my stomach full. I guess it was all that bread and pesto from the start lol   Gents, take your partners here and you will get her to want you for dessert later on"}
{"text":"I LOVE the Tuesday specials. 3 course meals starting from $15; great choices! The desserts are scrumptious. And their drinks OMG so yummy; the Hawaiian one and the jalapeño one. Yasss I love coming here. GREAT service."}
{"text":"Went there for Sunday brunch! Great drinks, great service, great food! Get breakfast and unlimited breakfast drinks (mimosas, sangria, passion fruit champagne, etc.) for $20!! AWESOME"}
{"text":"Our first visit to Bonefish Grill in Madison.  Our visit lived up to our expectations and experiences we have enjoyed at other Bonefish locations.  We attempted to schedule reservations online, 3-4 hours before our arrival with no luck - we chose to walk-in and add our name to the wait list.  It was great to see the dining area and bar packed with patrons.  We visited the bar for a bottle of Charles & Charles and tap Leinies' Dopplebock - all served to perfection.  Wait staff tantalize your taste buds by offering appetizers as they pass through the bar - \"bang, bang shrimp\" are a big favorite.  Our wait was estimated at an hour and we were seated within that time frame.  Kelsi was our server, she was efficient and attentive.  Our table tried the sea scallops and shrimp and the yellowfin ahi tuna steak.  Everyone at the table was impressed with the presentation and the quality and taste of the dishes.  My dinner was served on the cool side, but I would have to accept equal responsibility for any criticism as I chose not to return it to the kitchen for re-heating. Dinner was preceded with oven warm, fresh bread with herb olive oil - this was equally delicious.  We enjoyed our dinner and visit to Bonefish Grill.  I believe their food and service will continue to improve to \"five stars\" as their team gets more comfortable and acquainted with their new building and their rapid popularity in Madison.  Give Bonefish a try for your next dinner out - schedule reservation far in advance - if you prefer a minimal wait - I think you'll enjoy your visit."}
{"text":"What a waste of our time and most importantly our money.Started with the calamari, so tough & chewy we couldn't eat it. They were offering a Valentine's special for $29 choice of either steak & lobster and/or sea bass to include salad, side & dessert. One of us opted for the sea bass..we made it very clear to the server that we did not want to be rushed, salad showed up as we were attempting to eat the calamari, no sooner was the salad set down, the sea bass showed up, we sent it back and asked again to slow it down. When we did receive the fish & the mussels which were ordered to be served as an entrée not app, the sea bass was so small and the $4 up charge for the truffle mac & cheese was crazy. Truffle? seems that they used regular button mushrooms with some truffle oil over. Mussels has more red onions than mussels. After removing our entrees, we sat there for 20 minutes waiting for the dessert. Inquired where it was and was told it was being made. The best part was the dessert served and touted as chocolate crème brulee...remember the chocolate pudding Jello makes? They put the pudding in a dish with something that resembled a brulee topping and some whipped cream? Seriously, it was disgusting. After the dessert was finally served we asked for our check and we handed the server a coupon that was sent in the mail for $20 off $40, upon receiving the check he neglected to deduct the $20...another 15 minutes and finally we were able to get out of there. Never, never again."}
{"text":"The ban bang shrimp poppy was fantastic lots of flavor and taste a little messy definitely will fill you up. My husband had the fish tacos and said they are better than tilted kilts  very good food. Gave 4 stars our server was slow, it took a while for food to come out when they weren't very busy, and do not order the Moscow mule unless you want something super sugary sweet. The Moscow mule us to be a refreshing drink this was anything but, it was so sweet we had to drink water and for $8.00 (7.90) each it was a rip off-no booze in em and to sweet to drink."}
{"text":"I can say I was very pleased with this restaurant. It's nice inside the food is pretty good as is the service. I have been here a few times since the opening."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a couple times, and the food and service are good.  But the music they insist on blasting in the place?  Really, when I was there last some sort of Millenial-Elevator stuff was making it damn near impossible to either hear the waitress or hear my old lady."}
{"text":"I had never heard of this place until recently, was told we were getting one in Vegas, and my friend raved about it. Found out this is apart of Bloomin' Brands (Outback, Carrabba's, Fleming's & Roy's) and I'm a fan of the latter two, and who doesn't love Outback every once in awhile, so I excited to try this place. Immediately upon entering it reminded me of Outback with a Tommy Bahama feel. They have an awesome patio as well, it's that time of year for outside dining and I appreciate a good patio.  I started out with a glass of wine and I was surprised that had a decent wine list. The bread basket was a hit. Warm sourdough, butter and oil/pesto mix dipping sauce.   Their menu does change regionally, I noticed we don't have some of the fish on the menu as they do in Florida, but in change I noticed we do have menu items they didn't in Florida. They run nightly specials, and they have some drink specials as well. The Bang Bang shrimp happens to be my favorite menu item."}
{"text":"My friends and I eat here a lot for their Sunday brunch. A fantastic bottomless bubble brunch! You get all you can drink (choose between Sangria, Mimosa, or Bellini) and brunch for only $20. Can't beat that! My vote is always for the Bellini, but you can easily try them all.   My favorite brunch option is the Bang Bang Shrimp Benedict, but anything with their Bang Bang Shrimp is amazing. The Bang Bang Shrimp isn't spicy but it has a really great small kick to it. Almost all of the options are worth trying. The Surf and Turf Benedict is probably my next favorite. If you are really hungry definitely go for the burger. Aside from the burger the dishes aren't huge, but they will likely fill you up, especially if you combine it with the bottomless bubbles. If you aren't a big drinker, their coffee is surprisingly good as well.   I have never found this place to be over-the-top or anything, but the service is good, the food is good, and the price is perfect!"}
{"text":"This place is very bad when it comes to customer service , we came in the server wasn't there.  We have been waiting for 15 mins  .. And then she came we asked her if she could seat us out side she went for another 15 mins and she came back when we were about to leave ... Never again !!"}
{"text":"Chris was our amazing and smiling server on Easter Sunday. He was helpful and kind and informative as well as knowledgeable. The food was nothing short of exquisite. As you can see from the photos, I requested an over medium egg on my burger and it was absolutely flawless.  Excellent presentation and flavor to make ch for and overall amazing Sunday brunch dining experience."}
{"text":"Overcooked fish and painfully slow. This was our first time here. We looked at the menu online and it looked interesting and priced right so we gave it a shot. Unfortunately, the experience wasn't good. The food was just barely OK, but for a so-called \"fresh seafood\" place I am doubtful of the freshness. We started with oysters on the half shell. They seemed to be on the dry side, and I suspect that they were previously shucked. Never, never, never! Fresh oysters should be shucked to order, this is not a food item that can be prepared ahead of time. My wife ordered snapper and I had the Atlantic char. Both fishes were overcooked and dry. I should of sent them both back, but we had waited so long for everything, I just didn't want to wait for a new order. We ate a few bites and took the leftovers home and gave it to our dog. I don't know why they were so slow, we arrived a little after 6 pm and they were not even half full. Our server apologized for the delay, but it wasn't his fault, but a slow kitchen.   Great restaurants have chefs, mediocre restaurants have cooks. A minimum requirement for a good chef is knowing how to cook a protein to the proper temperature. The \"cooks\" working here didn't even come close to cooking our entrees correctly. Also, our server never asked if we wanted desert, which we probably wouldn't have ordered anyway, but  a complimentary desert for our delay would have been the right thing to do. Doesn't matter anyway now because this was our first and last visit."}
{"text":"This was our first experience at this particular bonefish. I've been to them in the past. The food was very good. The bang bang shrimp was good but I think they may have changed the recipe. Our server, Kevin B was excellent. He was very friendly and charming and was excellent at what he did. He was very nice to my children as well I will be coming back for sure since we live so close!"}
{"text":"Pretty sure our server was high. Everything came out wrong. Food was overcooked, and the manager kept coming to check on us like he knew that his employee was incapable of service.  Love bonefish in florida but will definitely not be returning to this location. Yuck yuck yuck- $167 worth of food that was barely touched. We'll see how long this establishment holds up."}
{"text":"So delicious! The bread was hot the food was delicious, the place was extremely clean and the service was good for the most part. The hostess was sweet we sat in the bar area. When the waiter finally came she came with water then gave us a min to look over the menu. They closed at 10 it was a little after 9:00 but we never felt like our waitress was rushing us. I ordered a salad with my food that never came but she apologized multiple times then quickly gave me another side with my meal. Altogether it was a good experience. I will definitely be back especially on Tuesdays they have a 3 course meal for $14."}
{"text":"Went to this location with a group of friends for brunch. Most of us tried their brunch special which consists of bottomless \"brunch\" cocktails i.e. mimosas, bellini's, etc. along with an item of the special brunch menu for $19.99.   The restaurant itself is very nice and clean with an \"I'm on vacation on the waterfront\" vibe. The service was fantastic. Our server was on point with cocktails, food and overall very pleasant.   I ordered the Bang Bang shrimp Benedict with side of asparagus. The Benedict was very good, crispy shrimp and a flavorful with hint of spice sauce. The asparagus were meh. They seemed overlooked and a bit soggy. Had the price not included bottomless brunch beverages I would've given the review 3 stars because how difficult is it to get asparagus right? But keeping in mind what you get for the price, the overall atmosphere and service the experience did deserve 4 stars."}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend decide to try this new place out inside of townsqaure. Menu seemed nice and simple, food was fairly good but the service was a horrible experience. We came in for lunch around 3:45 on a Sunday to a empty restaurant with the exception of two people finishing up their meal. We waited about 5 minutes to place drink orders then it went all downhill. Our water came out and we sat for about 30 minutes waiting to take our order while other servers just walk by avoiding eye contact at all cost. Finally our server pops up out of nowhere saying \"oh your not my table, but I will take your order anyways\" after that delightful experience we sit and wait and notice they are bringing bread out to people that arrived after us, so we ask another server for bread and she says we have to wait for our appetizer to come out, seriously? Btw our server never mentioned bread to us, so whatever getting more irritated. By this time everyone that arrived later than us are receiving entrees while again we sit there and wait. Finally we are fed up ask for boxes and check and she goes to help another table. I hope the management can resolve this issue, we will NEVER be back. I'm scared to see how this overstaffed restaurant works with a decent rush."}
{"text":"I should have known better. Corporate chains are not my thing, I know too much about quality food. We came on a Tuesday which is apparently a 3 course meal for $14.99. So it was stacked with tables of what I can only assume we're retired folks. Nothing wrong with a good deal on a limited income, the staff was just not prepared to keep up with that so service was spotty.  The good: fresh hot bread, and tasty oysters The bad:  house salad dressing had so much sugar my teeth hurt, sea bass (yes, I should know better) was nearly raw. Had to send back. They put the same fish back on the grill while my hubby ate his dinner and my veggies and rice congealed under a hot plate. Husband done with dinner, then they brought back the recooked fish, although cooked to temp was fishy and awful taste permiated the now soggy and gray broccoli so that was a wash too.  Sent back the second glass of wine as the served me the wrong wine. Hubby had orange roughy which I would grade as adequate but not good. The management response. The admitted they were having problems with the sea bass as I was the second one returned (this is 6:30 pm).  He took the sea bass off the bill. Well I would hope so since I didn't eat it I should not have to pay for it.  Advice to management - Not charging a customer for food too bad to consume is really not customer service. Should have comped the entire food bill. I did tip on the total bill, server struggled to do as well as he could dealing with a 20 top that all requested separate checks. I give this place another 6 months. They won't survive the summer without the snowbirds.  Salty sow is across the street and is an excellent choice as is Yasu close by. Learned my lesson!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend an I decided to try this place last night. Let me start by saying it was not a great start. When we got there we were barely greeted by a hostess who looked like she was annoyed that we even entered the restaurant an had to seat us. Then upon trying  to seat us she tried to seat is at a table that was so close to another table you couldn't even pull your chair out without hitting the larger party next to us. An keep in mind there were more tables open that were not in a crowded space. So when we asked for a different table we got the even more annoyed look with sigh an eye roll. Very unprofessional..Once seated our waiter came over who was very nice. He explained everything to us as this was our first time an was very informed on the menu items. We started with the bang bang shrimp as an appetizer as he said it was the most popular an good. It was ok..then after waiting over 45 min  for our dinner an apologies form the waiter our dinner came out which consisted of the Cajun fish tacos an salmon which shouldn't have taken that long. All in all the food was ok."}
{"text":"Me and my wife love bonefish and so glad they just opened one so close to us. We went to this location for the first time on Saturday night. Like Friday or Saturday night the place is busy and on a 45 minute wait so we decided to pull some barstools and have a date night at the bar. Our first impression of the bar staff was that they were friendly and nice. We started off with a bang bang shrimp which is always a awesome go to for an appetizer. I had the fish and chips and my wife had the fillet which were also excellent. We will definitely be coming back here. They have a great bar staff and excellent food."}
{"text":"This is now my 3rd time here at Bonefish Grille and I don't know why this place doesn't have a higher rating here on Yelp.  The Bang Bang Shrimp is my favorite thing to eat for lunch.  The savory taste of the tang as it enters your mouth followed by the desire to want more, has got me back 3 times now!   I will be back for sure and the service is always very courteous."}
{"text":"I've been to Bonefish Grill 3 times now. Food was amazing, the bang bang shrimp is hands down to die for as well as the Chilean sea bass and lobster stuffed shrimp. I was on the fence of giving 5 stars but the customer service is out of this world for a chain like restaurant.    My first two experiences were great. Food and service was on point the whole time. The last time there were a few small issues that left me a little less than satisfied. I sent a message to the company and the JVP of Bonefish reached out to me personally to make sure everything was handled. I was very happy with the prompt customer service, and thought the situation was handled better than I expected it would.   Please give Bonefish a try."}
{"text":"So glad I finally had the chance to check this place out! There are some really great pictures on here that make you want to try so many things, so being a Yelper of course I had to try!  Came on a Monday night with the whole family and we all really enjoyed our food!   So here's what we ordered: pecan parmesan crusted rainbow trout with coleslaw, and steamed broccoli. Not packed with a lot of flavor but still really good if your a lover of all fish, coleslaw was great and well, broccoli is broccoli. Fish and chips it was beer-battered and it came with fries. The fries and fish were both equally great. I had the ribeye and crab cake. My sides were garlic whipped potatoes and steamed asparagus. They had no gorgonzola butter so one of the gentleman made me a blue cheese butter and it was phenomenal!  The steak was cooked to perfection and the crab cakes was bomb! My kids had popcorn shrimp and chicken tenders and they loved both plates. We had raw oysters, Singapore calamari, ceviche, and bang bang shrimp! Every appetizer was awesome! The oysters are not very big but they are some of the best I have ever had! Service was good and all in all everything was great! Definitely will visit again to try something different!"}
{"text":"Great food, but service (at the bar) is usually not up to par to the other Bonefish restaurants I've been to.  I had the salmon (and it was great!) but after ordering my food and a glass of wine, I was never asked; would you like some bread? Would you like some water? Salt and pepper? Or even how is your dinner?   It seemed to me (after several visits) that the duo behind the bar, seem to be more attentive to the faces they know.   (Maybe they're shy). Lol.  This might sound nitpicking but that service comes to mind when deciding where to eat when I stay here at Rockside Rd."}
{"text":"I have had outstanding service every time I have gone here. My last experience my server Kevin did a great job. The food was amazing. Save room for dessert. The donuts are really good."}
{"text":"Excellent fresh seafood and service, the bang bang shrimp was out of this world. We were a party of eight, so we tried several different items from the menu; ahi tuna sashimi, Thai coconut shrimp, bang bang shrimp tacos, sir will's fish and chips, corn chowder and lump crab, Chilean sea bass, long fin tilapia, filet mignon, and a couple of their stuffed fish specialties and their kids Mac and cheese. Everything was amazing, the only thing that was just okay was the filet mignon, granted they specialize in seafood not steak, but highly recommended you won't regret it! :)."}
{"text":"I have been here on multiple occasions. The food is really good.  I like the noodles dishes, bang bang shrimp, and lily's chicken.    I came here the first week they opened and the service was not that great but I assumed since it was their first week it would be better the next time.  I have been there probably 10 times since it is 50/50 on service. I do not recommend eating here if you have a plans after like movies, etc.   Overall, the food is really good which is why it is still gets a good rating.  I will continue to go for the food!"}
{"text":"My first visit to this wonderful restaurant! My son recommended it and I was not disappointed!!     I started with the corn bisque. Just the right amount of \"kick\" my main course was pecan- crusted tilapia with asparagus and lobster ravioli    Finished up with my favorite dessert, creme brûlée!!   Who could ask for mores fabulous dinner with my wonderful son!!"}
{"text":"This was our first time here. A little pricy but well worth it. There were 4 of us and we each got something different. All the food was amazing. So was the pomegranate martini!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service tonight. The sea bass was well prepared and tasty. My wife thought her talapia was excellent and moist. The chowder was very good also   The restaurant was busy with many waiting at 6:30 pm. Key lime pie was very tasty for desert, good flavor and not to tart. They seem to be popular and the restaurant was very clean. Management came by to see how our food and service was. They opened in January and the service level has improved"}
{"text":"Went in on a Friday, wait was about an hour and a half. It was well worth it though. The bar makes fantastic drinks, but it took them a long time to make our drinks after we ordered (waited about 5 minutes).   Ordered the Bang Bang Shrimp appetizer, definitely a must order. One of the best apps I have had in a long time. Wait staff in the restaurant was fantastic. Definitely will be going back."}
{"text":"Ordered via phone for a lunch pick-up. The hostess was not the friendliest over the phone, but despite that, we decided to order the crab cakes and fish tacos. I asked for salads for both orders and waited several minutes for the total. I was told our food would be ready in 15 minutes. I arrived 25 minutes later and was greeted by, who I assume to be the manager, he accepted my cash payment and proceeded to the back to retrieve my order. Here's where the lack of customer service becomes noticeably apparent. The hostess, who I assume took my order, returns to the front. For at least 5 minutes, she did not greet me nor acknowledge me. She didn't ask me if I was helped, if I wanted to be seated...nothing. Finally, a cook who walked up from the back of the house, kindly asked if I've been helped and I replied that I was being helped by the gentleman who retreated to the back. The hostess, however, still couldn't be bothered to ask me anything. Anyway, 10 minutes have now passed and the gentleman returns with my order. He indicates that the bread isn't ready and I would have to wait 10 more minutes. I told him that we would forgo it. As I looked through the order, I realized that 2 different salad sizes were provided - a very small container of just lettuce...seriously and a larger container with tomatoes, nuts, etc. I questioned why the sizes were different. It was explained that the salad for the crab cakes was an up-charge. I countered by stating I asked for salads as the sides for both meals and each meal comes with a side, so they should be same. His explanation was deficient as he stated with the crab cakes, salad is an up-charge and again, I didn't understand why an up-charge (larger salad) wasn't provided for the tacos. Additionally, when I reviewed my receipt, I didn't see an up-charge reflected for this meal. Furthermore, the hostess did not indicate or explain any of this during the call. The food was mediocre at best. My fish was overcooked and while I asked all condiments to be on the side, someone thought it made sense to place sour cream in the container with the hot food. Of course the salads were horrific, mine was just a toddler's handful of lettuce whereas my sister's looked and tasted old. She was scared to eat the cheese because it didn't look fresh. Crab cakes were ok - cold and falling apart, but at least edible. So, it looks like we won't be dining here again because the standard to which we were accustomed to has significantly lowered since our last visit. Just sad!"}
{"text":"I make the second best Baja fish tacos in the world; this place makes the first. Did the Bang Bang shrimp appetizer, yup, that was incredible. Wife had some kind of fish sandwich I didn't care about  because my tacos were way better so we didn't Bev. We had some bro as a server, but he was really good. (Very knowledgeable about the menu and seasonings (or a great liar,doesn't matter))."}
{"text":"As far as chain style seafood joints go, this one sits slightly head and shoulders above all others.  Always a fresh selection of entrees to choose from and nice relaxing atmosphere to wind down at the end of the day.  Hall of fame appetizer....bang bang shrimp.  Not too spicy, just the perfect blend of heat and great meaty shrimp.  Can't beat it.    My favorite entree here (as hard as it is to really pick one) has to be the Ahi Tuna \"Tokyo Style\".  Rare, seared tuna served with Asian vegetables and Jasmine Rice.  It's a colorful dish and equally as tasteful.  Highly recommended!  This \"fishy\" likes Bonefish and it just feels like home!"}
{"text":"Our anniversary dinner.   I love the environment of this restaurant. It's really relaxing and enjoyable. I've never been to a Bonefish Grill before. My boyfriend and I decided to get bang bang shrimp as our appetizer - 1 because he said it was delicious and 2 - on Wednesdays its only $6 which sounded like a good deal. I loved the shrimp and now I kind of regret getting it because I can't stop craving it. Lol. The bread they serve is delicious too.  As our entrees my boyfriend ordered the steak with mashed potatoes and Cole slaw. He ate his steak as if  he was never going to see food again and told me it was perfect. He devoured the mashed potatoes. The Cole slaw was a no-go to him. I ordered the crab cakes with fries and green beans and a the lumb crab lobster soup. I personally loved the soup, it was smooth and had the perfect amount of seasoning. I didn't however care for the green beans that tasted like peanuts and the crab cakes were meh. My boyfriend ended up ordering creme brulee for dessert and that was delicious.  Over all I really don't know if I'd return.. It's obviously really expensive and I felt like we could've went elsewhere and received more bang for our buck but it was a nice anniversary dinner.   Our server was somewhat attentive and he answered my nine thousand questions about the menu without telling me to just shut up and pick something so kudos to him. Haha.   One thing I really didn't like was- and this is going to sound bratty-  the water. They serve it lukewarm.. No me gusta."}
{"text":"This is an adult restaurant. Kids are OK, but the place is for people who appreciate food, service, and ambiance.   Bang Bang Shrimp® is to die for. We get that starter each time. Be careful it is a whole meal for a individual.  Fish & Chips is really good. Not greasy and not too such coating, you actually eat fish.Chilean Sea Bass very good.  We've had the Caesar and the House Salads, they are not a disappointment.   The bar drinks use fresh fruit for the mixers, and you can taste it. Imagine a Screwdriver with freshly squeezed orange juice? Or a Lemon Drop where you watch them squeeze the lemons, yum...."}
{"text":"I really wanted this to be a great experience but it was really lackluster. We're going to give it another chance in the future but the first impression was pretty poor.  We had friends in town for the weekend and decided to check out the new Bonefish Grill for Brunch. The ambiance of the place was fantastic and we were seated promptly and presented menus. After a delayed wait, our drink and food orders were taken with FOUR mistakes that resulted in the server having to come back to us to have us change our selection.   They comped us an appetizer which was very kind of them and you could tell the wait staff were very frustrated for us and felt bad but the experience really left a bad taste for us.  We did have their signature shrimp which was delicious but the rest of the food was mediocre for the price. The Kobe beef burger was overdone as was the egg on top.  This may have had to do with the food waiting while order corrections were made.   We feel they may be better during a better time of day and will try it out again soon."}
{"text":"First time in with my family for my birthday. The food was absolutely excellent. The server was very courteous and got the orders perfect. The place was absolutely packed however, they brought the food out in a very short amount of time. Very impressive. Prices are actually a little lower than most fine dining restaurants. The food is superior than most fine dining restaurants by far. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"I ordered Lily's Salmon for lunch and I expected more for how much I was paying. Presentation was boring and looked like something I could do at home. The salmon was cooked very well, but the toppings (goat cheese and spinach) weren't necessary. Best thing about this place is their bottomless cocktails and drinks. Definitely recommend their blackberry sangria."}
{"text":"I feel a bit awkward being the first outlier ruining the average 5 star rating but take it for its worth after my explanation.  And really if I could I would give this place a solid 3.5 stars.    Agreed with the other reviewers, service was great and the place was jumpin on a Saturday night.  My friend and I had reservations for 8:15 pm but we arrived an hour earlier and grabbed a drink by the bar.  We both had the malbec to begin with which was decent.  A server was coming by the bar to pass around a sampler of their signature \"bang bang shrimp\" appetizer.  We each took one piece and the flavor of the sauce was good - creamy with a bit of a kick.  The shrimp was meaty but I noticed a slight aftertaste which to me indicated that that it's not the freshest...but again, it tasted good.    We got seated fairly promptly around 8:00 and I ordered the Caesar salad the tilapia stuffed with crab meat and scallops.  Before the salad, we received bread with olive oil and pesto which in my opinion was the highlight of the meal.  It was good - real gooood.  That pesto sauce on its own was good enough for me to start licking the plates clean!    Ok now on to the salad.  The Caesar salad was a bit heavy on the dressing.  I never thought I'd hear myself say that because I LOVE dressing.  But it was overkill.  It was like I was getting Caesar dressing with a side of romaine lettuce and a spattering of croutons.    On to the tilapia stuffed with crab meat and scallops.  As a side I got the chickpeas and steamed veggies.  Both of the sides were very good.  The fish was good, but it didn't taste as fresh as I would have liked it to.  The stuffing was a bit too creamy for me - it was like mayo mixed with crab meat and scallops.  And also the baby scallops were a bit rubbery as I was eating them.  I probably ate 1/3 of my entree and packed the rest to go.    While Bonefish is a decent option in the suburban sprawl of chain restaurants that's just what it is...a good chain restaurant.  They mentioned that they fly in their fish fresh daily, but I've definitely had better tasting fish in the Burgh so I'm a bit skeptical about that statement.  I'm a huge seafood fan so my standards are high when it comes to seafood restaurants.  Traveling often to a coastal town when growing up I've had some of the freshest fish available so I know fresh fish."}
{"text":"I have eaten at several Bonefish across the country and I have to say they are very consistent! The food is always fresh, good, priced right, and the staff is always well trained.   I love the Wed $5 bang bang shrimp special it is always awesome!"}
{"text":"This area is super convenient for those traveling on business and staying at the nearby hotels. I came here by myself during happy hour and took advantage of the $4 wine special. My waitress was super attentive and thorough. I imagine the fact that I came early contributed to the speed at which everything came out. I kept things simple and ordered the ahi tuna (medium rare) with rice and veggies. Everything was cooked very well, although I selfishly wished there were more food on my plate! I would recommend this Bonefish to any out-of-towners looking for a dependable, reasonably priced meal. It's also adjacent to a walkable strip of other shops / restaurants, which I would have liked to check out if I had more time."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this restaurant! My friend and I go every Monday for lunch! The service is GREAT and the food is fabulous! Try the bang bang shrimp, coconut shrimp or crab cakes! Or try the fish and chips! Actually we've tried almost everything and it's all great! Love this place and we enjoy the whole experience there! Everyone is so friendly and we have many favorite servers now! Hostess, manager, chef are all so friendly! Did I say I love this place?"}
{"text":"Stopped in with the baby for potstickers. Ashley is our server. So nice! Food is always amazing and hot."}
{"text":"In a town, like Madison, with all of our choices of local food, the thought of going to a chain restaurant rarely, if ever, crosses my mind.  But when you are desperate on time and stuck on the westside, sometimes you just have to throw caution to the wind and stop at one.  Which is what we did on Sunday night.  We decided to sit outside and the patio was well equipped with both ceiling fans as well as space heaters.  At first, I was a little disappointed with their regular beer menu.  It was limited and focused on major national brands.  My frown quickly turned upside down when I noticed on their special menu that, one of my faves, Dogfish 90 minute IPA was available.  My better half opted for the blackberry sangria.  Another 2-3 ounces of red wine would have cut down on the sweetness. For food, we opted for the oft mentioned Bang Bang Shrimp as well as the beef potstickers.  I would say both were good but neither would bring me back.  I think we would have better liked the shrimp if we ordered them in a taco (featured on the menu).  Served on their own on top of some greens, they quickly became one dimensional.  They needed some texture and acid to help liven it up.  The complaint on the pot stickers would be the over seasoning. For my girlfriend, who should have NACL tattooed on her body, to comment about how salty the dish was, is saying alot.   I'm pretty sure fish sauce was one of the ingredients used and a heavy hand can quickly kill the dish. Service was polite and efficient.  All in all, a basic experience at a chain restaurant.  Nothing horrible but nothing outstanding.  Middle of the road.  Will I be back?  Probably not.  But in a pinch, Bonefish does just fine."}
{"text":"I often eat at a NJ Bonefish, so I was happy to see one in the Scottsdale area. For a chain restaurant, its outstanding.  The bang-bang shrimp is a MUST try. TIP: If you are a member of Life Time Athletic, show them your card and the Bang-Bang are free! I've only eaten at this location once, but our food was delicious, our service was excellent, and the place was very clean and well-maintained.  We came for an advertised specials, but this location didn't have that special. Our server and manager worked with us and gave us an even better deal!"}
{"text":"Training Day Brunch  I got invited to a Friends & Family brunch service which was also a training day.  There were limited spots and my indicated time of 12:45pm was pushed back to 1:00pm when I called in to reserve my spot, which actually worked out better for my group & me.  I am  breaking this into sections since it is all still fresh in my mind:  Decor - It is a nice, contemporary look with lots of windows & great outdoor seating.  The bar has a nice feel while the bar itself being, nearly, the width of the restaurant.  The tables are covered with logo'ed, slightly course, tan paper.  I sat in a bar high-top so I only viewed the regular dining area.  BTW, the happy hour runs until 6:30pm, Sunday-Thursday with 5 or so food & 5 drink specials.  I didn't really pay too much attention since I am reviewing the brunch service.  Cocktails - I ordered Bloody Mary's & tried a sip from a Passionfruit Mimosa.  The Bloody Mary consisted of Absolut Citron muddled with fresh herbs & tomatoes & something that makes it spicy (horseradish + ???) Garnished with cucumber slice, olive stuffed with cream cheese, and celery stalk.  The overall flavor is freshness.  Not the sweet/Worcestershire tomato vodka combination that I am accustomed to.  A big plus, the muddled tomatoes & herbs hide the vodka bite.  The Passionfruit Mimosa was sweet & bubbly; during regular brunch, this is an \"endless\" drink, YMMV, though.  Appetizers - Though Michelle, our server, called the A la Carte items appetizers for today's brunch, we ordered a chocolate croissant.  It was very tasty with some type of maple glaze on top & dark chocolate within.  Appetizing, yes.  Appetizer, no; more like pre-dessert   Main Course - I ordered the Shrimp and Creamy Corn Cakes.  This was an outstanding dish with a good amount of spice for a Creole inspired dish.  The 6 large shrimp were served in their Creole sauce over 2 \"creamy cheesy corn cakes\".  These were lusciously fried with a light cheese & cornmeal sweetness.  A great platform on which to serve the shrimp.  This was a great dish and I would be hard pressed not to order it again instead of trying a new item. I sampled the potatoes au gratin.  For you potato & cheese lovers out there, we may have your new addiction.  I could have eaten this one item & been happy; very full, but happy, nonetheless.  Our server, Michelle was very fun & excited about the menu.  She had just gone through the tasting/training day and definitely was enthusiastic about many items.  I am excited about going back for dinner (Chilean Sea Bass in the Pan-Asian sauce).  The cost of our meal for 4 which was 4 entrees, 8 cocktails, and the \"appetizer' was around $100.  This seems a good price for the quality of food, which I would rate at 4/5 to 5/5 stars.    Warning, the overall flavors here are bold with mild (IMO) spiciness in many items. So, if you can't handle the heat, ask your server what's spicy & if they can turn in down a notch or 2.  Watch here for a dinner review, hopefully, soon!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful evening out with my folks to celebrate my Godmother's 85th birthday on Sunday in mid August at the Summerlin location ( West Las Vegas). As we wanted fish, we had the prawns and scallops , and my Godmother had the whole trout. The seafood was very good. The service was nice, and the manager / co-owner even came out with a birthday card , desert, and a gift certificate for the Birthday girl. ( She told us that she went back a few times after we left town and now all her friends like it too) Just one thing to consider, the parking lot fills up very quickly, you could park next to the Kohl's several hundred feet West and walk back East past Merialdo Lane,  but you can sometimes get a closer spot at or behind the adjacent Fleming's Steakhouse. (I believe they are owned by the same parent company)  The entrance to Bonefish Grill has one of those fancy rotating glass doors like you see in all the old New York movies, and the inside has soft lighting, white linen tablecloths, a nice bar with 2 flat screens ( good for following the Olympics or other sports), and a pretty, metallic wall art installation of the namesake fishbone motif."}
{"text":"While it doesn't appear that most of the seafood served here is sustainable, the quality of food & service are pretty good. Good, hot bread started our meal. We enjoyed pompano served with crab, salmon (Atlantic--farmed, I presume), and crab cakes."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times.  I've taken my 5 year old at dinnertime. We had great food and ok service.  The waitress wasn't very nice until we ordered 2 tasty treats at the end. This took away from the dining experience.  The children's fried fish was all fried breading.. next time we will choose unbreaded baked. . I recall having a great meal of Atlantic salmon.   The desserts Strawberry Shortcake, and Crème Brûlée were wonderful. After we ordered desserts the waitress was helpful, friendly, and cleared the dinner plates from the table even asking if we wanted to box our left overs which I found unusual in such a place. Though nearly none of the children's fried fish was eaten.  The second time I went was after work. I was surprised by nothing but wonderful service.   I had a wonderful raspberry martini.  The corn chowder and the calamari appetizer. Both were wonderful.  I have also tried the bang bang shrimp, as well as the shrimp tacos thanks to my someday sister in law.   I would go here again"}
{"text":"I never have a bad meal here, the chops were cooked just right Lillys chicken was done right as well. The service was very good! The only complaint was, as a side I ordered the french green beans, however they gave me au gratin potatoes! Other than that everything was good besides after mentioning it to our waiter he brought me some french green bean! All is well!"}
{"text":"Bonefish used to be one of my favorite places.  Now when I ordered  the shrimp ceviche it was whole shrimp.  Who puts whole shrimp to pick up with little chips. Worst ceviche ever.   The salmon special was just ok.  My husbands muscles were cold and my daughters dynamite shrimp with risotto was not good.  Too much spinach in the risotto.   Bummer think I need to find a new favorite."}
{"text":"If u like seafood I highly recommend this place.  The host was so friendly and the waiter we had was thw best giving his advise and all.  I can't wait rmto go again."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night and sat at one of the tables in the bar area. It was busy but not packed. Service was very slow. Our waiter said he would fill up our water and we didn't see him for 20 minutes. We then asked two other servers to fill up our water and the second apologized for having to wait.   We started with the Bang Bang Shrimp which was very good and came out pretty fast. Our meals took forever to come out and once they did, they were lukewarm. We ordered the chicken and an 8 oz filet.   Unfortunately, I don't think we would come back again."}
{"text":"I'm a Bonefish fan nationally speaking BUT this particular location is all about serving you Red Lobster quality food at double the cost. I took my girlfriend here initially on a busy night. Huge mistake.   The place is right across from a very busy Holiday Inn so they are slammed on certain weekend nights. Her mahi mahi was grossly overcooked and the taste was the farthest from \"fresh fish\" you could imagine. My fish was grossly undercooked. We got a good laugh out of that. They ended up comping our bill but it still ruined our night as it was really too late to go elsewhere.  I'm a big seafood fan and I've beeen to better bonefishes in other cities so I decided to chalk it up to business and give it one more try on a slow night. I got scallops and she got mahi mahi again. They were both cooked \"ok\" this time maybe a little on the overdone side for her fish. Both items didn't taste very fresh certainly not something I'd expect from any other location.  2 strikes and your out for sure in my opinion. Definate case of Cleveland restaurant syndrome at this location. Seriously can ANYONE in the Cleveland area get fresh fish on their menus? If someone has an insider tip on a reliable seafood place in this area please send me a message. (if it's Blue Point Grille don't bother)"}
{"text":"I used to really enjoy Bonefish Grill. I used to be a regular customer and go here on dates. I thought of it as an upscale Red Lobster. However, the last 4 times I have visited BF, I have been met with very rude staff. I've noticed that the customer service is more resentful than appreciative. The prices have not declined, just the quality of the staff."}
{"text":"4 stars for their Tuesday selection specials. Fast service with friendly servers. Ambiance in the bar area is great, booths, bar and high table seating. Dining room is very bland, kinda like a hotel banquet room that has been set up for dinner. Music a bit to loud for me but that certainly differs depending on whom you talk to."}
{"text":"We have been here twice.    The first time was for a business lunch.   Although the initial layout of the room has a nice ambience to it, stay away from the windows as the sun really heats them up.  That however was not the reason for dissatisfaction.  We ordered their fish special and it came out within 2 to 3 minutes.  It was obviously not cooked as ordered but instead prepared in mass and left under the warmer.  Consequently, it was pretty mushy.   Not to mention, the purpose of hosting a business lunch at a nice restaurant is to have some quality time, not to be done eating in 20 minutes.  The 2nd time was to meet friends for happy hour.   It's not very happy.  There are no food specials, so even with their bar bitrs menu, it's pricey.  Although the food we did have was good.   The drink discounts are nominal.  And service....I know they are only 3 weeks out, but certainly a chain like this should know how to launch a restaurant by now.   Our server disappeared for several minutes at a time, and they weren't busy."}
{"text":"My hubby and I went to one in Michigan a couple of years ago and were looking forward to trying the new one. He made a reservation for us and when we arrived we were seated right away. Our server, Austin was very attentive and took great care of us. The coconut shrimp was so good, a bit spicy but great flavor. I got the Mahi Mahi and my hubby got the filet mignon. The Mahi was cooked perfectly but my hubby's medium rare filet arrived well done. Austin commented that it wasn't the first time that had happened. They quickly brought another and it was cooked just right. We had chocolate creme brûlée which was really good. Other than the issue with the filet being over cooked the rest of the meal was very good. We ate there on a busy valentines night but were in and out in about an hour. We will be going back soon."}
{"text":"Out in Cleveland for work, and I didn't want to go far from the hotel. I had been to another Bonefish and it hadn't been that memorable, but I had a good experience tonight. The Bang Bang Shrimp were pretty fire, and the burger was juicy and had good flavor. With a fresh salad you can't ask for much else. Had a couple craft beers but selection could be better."}
{"text":"ZERO STARS I am lost for words.  But I thought its my duty to let everyone know and help save time and money and perhaps a life. This was my first time going to this resturant  and it will be the last. Service was horrible, food is not that far from the service. We had so many ppl coming to our table and going (serving or cleaning plates) that we couldn't tell who was our server.  For starter we ordered calamari and took forever to take our order; it must be the i pad (tip- get rid of it, use pen and paper). One of our friends dining with us had shellfish allergy, after making sure our server  keenly aware, we found a few shrimp mixed in with our appetizer. This is bad practice. What began as a casual dinner with friends  quickly became a situaion that could've ended up in the ER. Thank goodnes she noticed, but what if it had been a child, we would all be reading a differnt review... When we notifed the shrimp in our calamari we made the server aware, she didn't even appologize she just said \"thats how it is!\". WRONG!!  THAT IS NOT HOW IT IS. The next day i called  to contact the manager, he wasn't available. Instead i was directed to the kitchen manager Mr. Joe. I explained to him what transpired, he offered me a gift card to shut me up; of which i refused. He then assured that they take food allergies very seriously, I was then told it was the responsibilty of the patron to accept the risk of possible contamination at this establishment. I guess it was my fault to eat at  fishbone grill. Lesson learned I will never be dining here again. Mr Joe this review is for you...  Every 3 min a food allergy resulting in anaphalactic shock sends someone to the emergency room accross the country.  I can see why because poeple, like those working in bonefish grill, could careless. Staff needs  to be educated about the serverety of these conditons. I hope this review can help someone before they dine at Bonefish grill. Please learn from this and if you have a food allergy all I can say is RUN,"}
{"text":"Located in Birkdale Village next to Pier 1.  This place has been busy since it opened.  It is a great mtg place for a quick bit to eat in the bar area.  There are $5 appetizer and drink specials and Wednesdays is my fav $5 bang bang shrimp night.  yeah baby!  You can dine in the main dining room area for a full meal.  The oil and bread served when you sit down is tasty and the  fish is always fresh.  Service is great and they serve Sunday Brunch!.  Plenty of parking in the lot across from the restaurant."}
{"text":"Bonefish Grill on Carmel for early dinner. I was delighted by the greeting from every employee! Our server was quick to the table & knowledgable ... enough so to clearly detail the specials, answer questions and make recommendations based on something specific to the dish. She also brought bread w.a good sized platter of seasoned olive oil. Not those skimpy ones other places give & I always have to ask for more....like 3 more! Unfortunately I forget her name & she was excellent! :-/  Oh! And the servers wore chef's coats! Nice touch!  Wednesday special: Bang Bang shrimp appie for $6. I ordered them GF/grilled, no breading. Just not the same as fried but ok. I didn't order a salad bc the shrimp come on a nice bed of greens. The salads I did see coming out were  generously portioned! Being rather hungry (aka eyes too big for my stomach ) I added al a carte sides of potato au gratin & sauteed spinach ($3 each). The potatoes were chunked like potato salad, not the usual sliced, and had lots of gooey cheese. Very good! The spinach was delicious; not oily & had just the right amount of garlic. One of my pet peeves is when you don't taste the food bc it is overseasoned. Like, what are they covering up when places do that?!  Excellent service, good food & nice atmosphere for just $12.00 Sometimes it's not worth shopping & cooking. An enjoyable visit! There were drink specials, also. But, it was my \"off night\"."}
{"text":"I love their gluten free menu! I can eat at-least some of every kind of item on the menu -- including desert. While I love their mussel appetizer I would really like it if there were a gluten free bread option for the herbed oil and bread  they bring to the table."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of this chain everything I've ever ordered was soooo good I usually go to the Matthews location but I came here Saturday it was packed as I expected but the staff was very friendly no complaints I will be back"}
{"text":"The Coke is amazing service is always good I have no problems when I dine here however my mom and sister have I guess you just have to order the right thing the bang bang shrimp is amazing chose when you come wisely it can get pretty crowded here"}
{"text":"Poor service and cold food. Will not go back again! Had a reservation and we still waited 20 mins only to be seated in front of the kitchen (very loud). The service was so slow that we had to go to the bar to get our own drinks. When our food finally came it was cold. Several of us ordered the same item and there was literal resemblance between our plates. Weird and gross."}
{"text":"Came here during brunch on Sunday. Sat right away. Within just a few moments the service was over and very attentive. The bread came out warm and was good as always.  My boyfriend got the soup which was cold. However they noticed without him mentioning it and took it off the bill. They were quick to correct a problem which I find is rare to do.  I had the Kobe burger and it was cooked perfectly. The house chips are really good too. I couldn't finish it all though... So full"}
{"text":"*brunch review* Came here for my first time this past Sunday!! So brunch is only available sundays here, their brunch menu is pretty small but tasty nonetheless! They have a deal which is $20, which includes bottomless bellinis, mimosas, and bloody Mary's, AND select breakfast items!! That's a pretty good deal considering some places charge $15 alone for drinks. Their drinks also come in a lot of flavors as well. I ordered the surf and turf eggs Benedict on English muffin, which come with a side of potatoes or seasoned veggies. It was super good! Came with one English muffin split in half, so it was two of the eggs Benedict pieces and it was really good!! I'll be back"}
{"text":"1st time here all stuff was very friendly we hav 5 plus people but we didn't wait for table  They do have happy hour for drink and food  Great for date ,family and friends"}
{"text":"Good food but stuff kind of slow. My server forgot bring me water and I'm several times asking other people bring me water but it's pass at least 10 min and I'm ask 3 times before they bring it . Other than that good clean place. Good food"}
{"text":"My first time and  I can't wait to go back. I may be addicted to the dynamite shrimp which I am eating the leftovers as I type. It's delicious..our waiter Richard was a pro and very attentive.. Kevin the manager made sure we were taken care of and enjoying our experience.  My drink was even filled by another waitstaff member.. the staff is hard working and professional. They seem to take pride in their jobs. Great experience, only suggestion, make reservations.  It's packed!  A+ all the way!"}
{"text":"This bonefish grill is fancy. Definitely not like the ones I see in Cali. I'll have to update this review if I ever go back to try something else but their cilantro lime salad that I had was not fresh. You could tell the greens were frozen. The salmon that I added on the other hand was pretty good. The tacos my coworkers had definitely looked much better. Just disappointed in the lack of freshness of the salad."}
{"text":"I am a frequent flyer at Bonefish. Good food. Great atmosphere. Lots of options for hanging out with friends or bringing coworkers/ clients for dinner."}
{"text":"Not surprised it closed. I rarely have been to a chain restaurant that was so poorly managed. I kept going back for the food, which when served correctly made up for the mistakes that happen one each and every visit."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting Bonefish Grill. Service was great. Bartender explained the menu thoroughly and offered suggestions. I was well taken care of. I started off with the lamb chops. They were cooked medium. They were tender but no real taste or flavor. They were bland. I had the mango salsa salmon with haricots and sautéed spinach. The vegetables were delicious. The salmon, however, was well overcooked. It was very dry. It was not very appeasing. Thankfully the spinach was sitting in a bit of garlic au jus. That helped me through the salmon. If I was asked to come back and visit here again I think I would choose somewhere else. I wasn't overly impressed."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch while in Town Square.  If this review were solely on service, it would be a lot different. Service was bad in the bar. Nonetheless, food was consistent with other Bonefish locations. The baja shrimp tacos are a must. I hadn't been in several years and decided to switch it up. Instant regret. I also tried a new drink, Paloma, which was too sweet for my taste.  I am curious if the B team does the lunch service and maybe dinner is the way to go."}
{"text":"Delicious seasonal drinks and outstanding service.  We were a party of eight and we had two servers at a table in the bar area...now that's some service!  Don't get me wrong, the restaurant and bar was very busy, as well.  The food was delicious and the price was reasonable.  Oh and did I mention their seasonal, fresh cocktails?!"}
{"text":"Our first Bonefish experience.  Me and my mom were out for a \"girls day\" lunch and on a whim stopped here.  We were not disappointed!  We had the lunch specials which were large portions.  My mom had the Fish and Chips (with the broccoli instead of the fries) and she liked the lightness of the tempura batter.  I had the lump crab cakes which were awesome!  So meaty with a spicy sauce to dip into!  We topped it off with a piece of Key Lime Pie to share.  We both agreed it was better than most either of us have ever had, including places in Florida.  Would certainly recommend this spot for really fresh well prepared fish!"}
{"text":"So we just left because we sat there in the BAR AREA for 25 mins and didn't get asked for a drink order or even acknowledged. Listen...I don't care about the hockey game...there were SIX SERVERS eating away in The bar area and didn't even get a service. #majorfail and it was an anniversary dinner so you just lost out big time..."}
{"text":"We went here recently for a business meeting with friends. I had never been to a Bonefish. I've heard a lot about them and I've been curious. I just recently started getting into seafood and have only eaten at fine dining non-chain establishments when I do have it.  Surprisingly I didn't know this place was a little more upscale for a chain. It was very nice inside, had a great ambiance to it.  Our server was absolutely wonderful and she was very sweet and humorous. She kept us all smiling and laughing the whole time. We started off with ordering 2 calamari appetizers and the wagyu beef potstickers. Unfortunately when she came back out with the potstickers she told us that they were out of calamari and to choose two appetizers on the house. What awesome service. Really trying to take care of customers! We had coconut shrimp and stuffed potatoes. All appetizers were delicious!  So I had Chilean Sea Bass and my boyfriend had Tilapia. I was so surprised at how delicious the fish was. No fishy taste, a great smokey flavor and cooked to perfection. I had the lime/tomato/garlic sauce on my sea bass and he had the lemon butter. Both were perfect.  Our friend had the Bang Bang Shrimp and I tried a bite and I'm addicted. I want to come back just for the shrimp!  The speciality drinks were a little too sweet for my personal taste but not too bad. I switched to white wine after which paired wonderful with the fish.   Overall we had an amazing time and I came with a certain idea of this place and was blown away in so many ways. I'm super happy this is close by to where I live. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Waitress was great and helped my vegetarian/vegan friends and I find yummy meatless options on the menu.   Nice atmosphere.   Perfect drinks, done right by an experienced bartender- cocktails were delish and not just overly-sweet concoctions. Margarita was legit.   Oh! And I accidentally left my credit card at the restaurant. Called the next day to inquire. A manager got back to me in 15 minutes with my found cc. So thankful!!!  All around great experience and also warm and fuzzies from being taken care of so well."}
{"text":"If your a person who likes cold disgusting food with a great view of plastic containers this is the restaurant for you. But if your normal like me then take your money and leave. - Horrible service             - Horrible management"}
{"text":"First time here and my wife and I were very pleased. Atmosphere was great, service was outstanding, and the food very good.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We had an amazing experience; food, drinks, atmosphere, and service were all top notch. This has the perks of being a chain in that it is very standardized, consistent, accountability, but it seems like a privately owned place b/c the food is excellent, fresh, top notch and the service is remarkable.  Atmosphere: Casual elegance, modern fresh feel, classy bar area with seating, good lighting  Service: Excellent, the waitress was able to make honest recommendations about the menu. Our drinks were never empty, perfect timing with each course, very personable without being overly personal, very professional and relaxing vibe   Food: EXCELLENT! The complimentary bread and herb oil is a nice start. We had the ahi tuna app and it was to die for. Dinner was fresh salmon done to perfection, cheesy scalloped potatoes were an unexpected find. I want to try the mac and cheese next time. The drink menu has lots of great options, I had the classic Patron Margarita which was nice, not too sweet, not made from a bottle mix. Dessert was home made doughnut dish with fresh whip cream and sauces for dripping. A perfect meal!  Highly recommend this place! The quality of all the nice places down town Pittsburgh, but with a parking lot!"}
{"text":"So today is Mother's Day. We made a reservation last week at 1:10 pm . We arrived at 1:00 pm . They informed us that it would be 1 hr Waite after our reservation time . This is not acceptable. The reason you make a reservation is to get seated at that time not one our after. And on top of this they have no place to wait except outside in 90 degrees. Horrible service. And the hostess informed us that everyone had to wait , like That made it ok"}
{"text":"Love this place and their staff!!! This has been our 2nd time back and we always enjoy ourselves here. Donnell our waiter was super accommodating as well as the manager Miles who helped me receive my receipt from days ago because I forgot to attach my Dine Rewards. We just moved here and this is one of the only places that makes us feel like we're at home. We appreciate the atmosphere and the experience we receive when dining here!"}
{"text":"I was very excited to finally have a Bonefish in this area.  I lived in Orlando, and frequented the one there.  However, this one was quite disappointing.  I went there with my husband and 2 year old son.  The table cloths are paper, so my son was able to draw on the entire table....which sadly, was one of the highlights.  I ordered apple juice for him.  The waiter told me that they don't have apple juice.  Though I was kind of shocked about that, I said ok, milk will be fine.  My husband & I ordered sodas.  About 5 minutes later, he brought our drinks, minus my son's milk.  He said they were out, that someone was running to the store to get more....that turned into another 10 minutes before the milk finally arrived.  I ordered tilapia stuffed with shrimp, scallops & crabmeat.  There was maybe 3 tiny pieces of shrimp and 3 tiny scallops with hardly any crabmeat at all...very disappointing.  My husband ordered pork chops that were entirely too dry to even eat.  My son had grilled chicken...wasn't too bad...for a kids meal.  The bang bang shrimp was okay....sauce was very thick and just soaked into the breading.  Portions aren't that big for the amount you spend....way overpriced!      We will probably go back, due to the fact that there isn't a large variety of seafood restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great fish at a reasonable price. Had the swordfish and the pumpkin ravioli. Both are great. The chowder is not so great. I'd skip it, but the bang bang shrimp is always a good decision"}
{"text":"Service was okay but not great or positive, I asked the waiter what he recommends from the menu and he had no clue he literally said \"I don't know\" I was sitting in the lounge area by the way. I got the crab cakes and they were absolutely disgusting, I really went for oysters but he said that they no longer serve oysters so I decided to go with the crab cakes instead... Very disappointed! I also showed him a picture of a lobster dish that was posted on Yelp by another customer and he said they no longer have that either so decided not to order anything else... Now I'm full and can't go eat anything else because I ate those nasty crab cakes.. When you're really hungry you eat anything until you 7 bites in and realize how disgusting it taste :/ but two stars for the not so bad service."}
{"text":"I love the bang bang shrimp but I have been here several time and everything else is inconsistent.  I had the bang bang tacos the last time I had dinner there and it was quite a disappointment. I don't think I'll go back unless we order just appetizers."}
{"text":"Just left happy hour there and it was fire! Mussels finger lickin' good! The cute bartender made great cocktails! Worth it. Go check them out you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed.  On the plus side, the waitress was friendly (though not extremely attentive) and the au gratin potatoes were to die for.  The dining room is classy and pleasant too.  However The pesto was too salty and there wasn't enough of it.  The steak was too tough.  The shrimp was blah.  And the veggies looked overcooked...and were.  Even the kids meal was pretty bland - didn't hold a candle to Great Dane's mac n' cheese.  I doubt we'll return."}
{"text":"Poor service at many levels.  Noisy.  Crowded and chaotic, loud, lack of ambiance."}
{"text":"One of my worst experiences. I purchased the bone in ribeye and it tasted spoiled. I asked if my steak was aged and I was told no. So the manager comes out and says that he didn't believe anything was wrong with it , but can I bring you something else .  I told him no I would just like the ribeye steak remade and he agreed to do so. And 25 minutes later my steak comes out, and it's absolutely nothing wrong with the steak at all. So the people I came with are completely done eating and it's just me now and of course I don't feel like eating it so I get me a to go box and asked for the bill. They bring me out the bill and lo and behold, the bill is full price. So I asked the waitress what happened and she tells That the manager doesn't believe that anything was wrong with the steak so he didn't take it off of the bill. I don't mind paying the bill when the food is great especially when the bill is great. I just feel that there is it in consideration of the manager on duty on 01/13/2018 @8:30 pm. I understand that they are in the business to make money as I am business owner myself, but I also understand that costumer service is key. And I wasn't shown that at all."}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting to be blown away by a chain seafood restaurant 1000 miles away from a coast, but it certainly could be better.  The place has a good atmosphere and the waitstaff is friendly enough, but the food is boring and overpriced. I think they will improve over time but they are still working the kinks out at this point. For example the last time I was there my asian slaw wasn't dressed and the crab cakes couldn't hold themselves together if their life depended on it.   This is a better place for lunch than dinner. If you got the dosh then I would recommend it but if you're broke like me then don't bother"}
{"text":"This place is just meh. Savs your money and eat somewhere else like Hash House A Go Go"}
{"text":"Service was not good. We sat down to a table that only had 2 silverware for 5 people. The waitress took our order and disappeared until the food came out. We had to ask for more drink and the additional silverware. Ordered the special of scallops on a bed of parmesan cheese risotto, risotto was ICE COLD, they offered to bring more risotto, well Chef Mike (Microwave) cooked that...the dosh was super hot. Ordered the Norwegian Salmon special with au gratin potatoes...that are not au gratin at all. Ordered the Cobia special with spinach and au gratin."}
{"text":"Just amazing food and service, what else can you say?. We love this place so much.  I had the salmon which was excellent."}
{"text":"This is an excellent restaurant, white tablecloth, great service and reasonable. I had the red sangria but it was to sweet ~ I should have known. The club salad with salmon added was superb. The bread is yummy. The fish tacos are a big seller. Everything looks fabulous. My fish was very good. I had the cod."}
{"text":"Awesome dinner we had last night.  Service was a 10  Our food was amazing. And the strawberry shortcake was to die for.   We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is my 5th time at Bonefish and my experience is consistent. Mediocre service with decent food. My waitress was more attentive than most this time; however, It took a while to get drink refills and our food took almost an hour to come (we had bang bang shrimp). Overall it's ok. Not over the moon about It. If you are looking for a quick bite look elsewhere. But if you just want to try It out it's not a bad spot"}
{"text":"I was here just to try out their happy hour. sat at the bar with my cousin. we tried the bang bang shrimp tacos. excellent..pretty big tacos for a happy hour menu...also ordered the siracha pepper chicken which was also excellent..small happy hour menu but great stuff..Mandy was our server/bartender..she was very nice and attentive and very informative with the menu..."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a couple of times. I usually always get the same thing - Atlantic salmon. I know I should change it around a bit but why go with something that is really good for something that you don't know. I do mix it around with their side dishes - sometimes salad, sweet potatoes, veggies, mahi mahi sauce, etc. Every single on of them, so far, are excellent.  I also really like their happy hour cocktails, they are always great and it's fun to keep trying out different things. Also make sure to leave room for their desserts, any suggestion from the servers so far has been great but I am still a number one fan of the key lime pie. The staff is great and very helpful, and I really like the ambient and decoration of the place, and for convenience this location is really close to my home, so I can always go for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Kenny A. and I might share the same brain...  I'm from the west coast and I had never heard of Bonefish Grill, so I had no idea it is a chain. When we walked in, the decor and ambience easily gives you the look and feel of a much higher-end restaurant.  I loved everything I had: the bread, the crab and corn chowder, the Imperial longfin with the amazing crab and shrimp stuffing. I don't remember what my sides were. For dessert I ordered a lemon drop martini. Service was great. I would go back in a second, even though the Newcastle came in a bottle."}
{"text":"Great service from our waitress. I got the grilled salmon and it was the perfect pillowy softness with a crunchy exterior. So good. Lovely date spot"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here last night for our two year anniversary. It was disgusting!  We ordered the Bang Bang shrimp and they were over cooked. I ordered the filet and not only did the chef cut into my steak like he's never cooked steak before but it was soggy and cold. Mashed whipped potatoes were cold and taste like they came from a box. I also had the add on of the lobster tail. It was over cooked. My husband had the imperial and he said it was soggy too. Truffled Mac had mushrooms which never specified. The only good thing was the Moscow mule. The chef either lacks experience or is lazy and doesn't care. Don't eat here!"}
{"text":"I have had to travel to Cleveland twice in the last month on business. I had the chance to experience this restaurant each visit and the service was fantastic. I am a seafood fanatic and every dish from the appetizer, to the entrée over exceeded my expectations. Come to find out, there is a location in Cali just 20 miles away from me. The waiting staff Kevin and Mary were great."}
{"text":"Sea Bass...TO DIE FOR.  So good, fresh, nice presentation, awesome wait staff.  Reasonably priced...$64 for two people.  Go."}
{"text":"Ordered salmon salad was very small, waitress forgot the dressing  had to wait as well as had to ask her for everything else bread, water-she was not attentive at all.  Chicken dish was dry, jasmine rice dry had no flavor, drinks pricey, martini 9.60!!! Decor very ugly.. Rip off will not Return."}
{"text":"What a great place to eat while in Las Vegas. The \"Bang Bang Shrimp\" appetizer is something everyone should order. Enough for two people to share and they set your taste buds for your main meal! Awesome!"}
{"text":"Updating my last review: Hubby and I went for dinner recently and, let's just say that BG has gone downhill. Years ago this place used to be an upscale place to dine. Perfect for date night, networking, girls night out but the quality of the food has changed. I ordered the tilapia stuffed with shrimp and lump crab meat. Stuffed is an exaggeration. It also wasn't very flavorful. Sides were mediocre. Hubby had the salmon and said it was unremarkable. There's other things that have changed too but I can't put my finger on it. It's just an overall inconsistency with them.   Bonefish Grill is hit or miss with me. I've been several times. Sometimes the experience is really good from the service, the atmosphere and the food. Other times, I've been disappointed in 2 of 3. I went with my hubby a while back and being that both of us are...ahem...mature in age...we sometimes need to out on our reading glasses to see menus. However, the lighting is so dark in this place we additionally had to whip out our phones to illuminate the menu! I guess they're trying to create a romantic atmosphere? But what about when you go with a friend? I took a friend out to dinner to celebrate an accomplishment and I felt like I needed a lamp on the table. Finally, the food. In general, the food tends to be delicious. I always order the bang bang shrimp. The last time I ordered, however, I had the worst ...um...bathroom issues later that night. Their martinis are always yummy. Service is typically good. They do get crowded so I've found that going on a Sunday for dinner is less crowded."}
{"text":"A+ for atmosphere!   Warm and open space with clean white table cloths. Our waiter was charming and good with the quips.  Bread with herbs and oil hit the table first. Our appetizer was calamari with peppers and sweet spicy Asian sauce. Calimari was tender and everyone at the table loved the sauce.   For dinner I ordered the crab crusted Alaskan cod. The portion was so large I thought they gave me a tilapia filet by mistake! The cod was nothing special in flavor but it was cooked properly. I had steamed spinach as a side but I didn't like that it was sitting in a pool of water. The garlic mashed potatoes were the highlight of the dish.  Overall it was a positive experience. We may return the next time we're in the mood for elevated chain restaurant seafood."}
{"text":"Very happy with this restaurant. They have a nice menu even if you do not like fish,  I had the Atlantic Salmon with mango sauce, it was firm, tasty and cooked just right.  Service was very good, although they are using tablets to take orders and they had quite a few issues with them.   I really think they are trying very hard, I hope it stays that way. Give it a try, you will like it."}
{"text":"Love the food, love their service, love the manager, they gave me the best wedding reception. Love them and will forever be in my memory and will always be special to me."}
{"text":"Went in because I had a free dinner offer from AMEX- will definitely return. Food was fresh and cooked to order. Staff was knowledgeable and pleasant. We were told that the wait for 4 would be close to an hour but we were able to sit at a community table for 4 right away."}
{"text":"We had a great time during my daughter's birthday. The service was fast. Food was great. It was not too much pricy! :) Good place to go."}
{"text":"I visited Bonefish Grill with my girlfriend as we received a giftcard and decided to try it.  Neigther of us had been here before,  The selections were adequate, but a tad bit pricey.  The evening started off bad, and got worse,  While ordering drinks, I ordered an angry orchard, i was told he will see if they have it, as the menu is wrong quite a bit.  Then while ordering dinner, I ordered the tilapia, which comes with seasonal vegetables and one side.   I inquired if i could substitute another side for the vegetables.  He said for 1.50 I could have whatever I want.  I again said i want to substitute, not add, and he again said 1.50.   I will not be going back to a place that charges extra to substitute a side that probably costs less than the side listed on the menu.  This is just a way for the restaurant to make more money."}
{"text":"This Bonefish was awesome!!! My husband and I got the bang bang shrimp and fish and chips for dinner and it was great"}
{"text":"Great place to come for delicious seafood!! The mussels appetizer, bang-up shrimp flatbread, stuffed fish with scallops, crab and shrimp, filet mignon. We are definately returning!"}
{"text":"Bang Bang shrimp is great. Had the Salmon Kale salad and was very tasty. Food and service is always first class. Great job!!"}
{"text":"Follow up. I emailed in their website my review. Guess what response I received  Yup NOTHING! They don't care.   Not a peep. No I'm sorry no concern to fix it nothing."}
{"text":"Looking for a great date night spot with delicious seafood... Well you've found the spot!  Bonefish Grill was a delightful experience - from the friendly staff to the delicious food, the dining experience didn't skip a beat.  After some thought on what to eat, we asked the waitress for some suggestions. Appetizer - Bang Bang Shrimp: Didn't sound so appetizing, but had to call the waitress over to tell her how amazing this dish was. Definitely try it! Dinner - Salmon with Imperial Topping: The great thing is is that you can mix and match the toppings on all of the seafood. Drinks - Winter White Cosmo: Probably my favorite new drink. Made to perfection and I might just have to remake it for my holiday parties!  Definitely a great spot to check out. Pretty busy during dinner time - make sure you make a reservation in advance."}
{"text":"We have been coming here on a regular basis, and always thought the place was ok.  Our last two visits make me think that this place may not be around for long.  The bathrooms are always dirty, used paper towels everywhere, and the floors are very sticky.  All of my silverware was dirty.  Not just dirty, it had baked food stuck to it.   Our napkins had dried food on them.  Lost my appetite, finished my drink, and did not touch the food.  Maybe a new manager can turn this place around?"}
{"text":"As a somewhat regular I was extremely disappointed on my last visit. The evening started by stretching a 10 minute wait time into 30 minutes. Once taken to the table it was very noticeable that the table cloth had been replaced by tacky plastic. We ordered the mahi mahi grilled, and two sides. The fish while a very small portion, was warm although a little dry. The sides were cold, and the Mac and cheese was fridge cold. The waitress was extremely nice removed the mac and cheese from the bill and apologized for the dry fish and cold sides.  Not really sure what happened, is this typical of the Pineville NC chain it is this a franchise wide issue? I travel a good bit and Bone Fish is my favorite for fresh and relatively health food. Looks like I will have to reconsider my go-to when on the road."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I met my parents here for dinner. I was about an hour late and walked in to my parents still having not received drinks. We waited another half hour before flagging down a host who didn't do anything either but apologize. A manager ended up coming over and getting a waitress for us. Almost 2 hours after my parents got there, drinks and appetizers were served. The table next to us also had a really long wait before getting their drinks. This was the case with the tables by the bar and behind us too. The food is great and they tried to make the wait right by offering a free appetizer and drinks, which is the only redeeming quality to this review. With better service, this place would receive 5 stars easily, but if it doesn't improve, this place sadly won't be around for long. EDITED: the check came and they ended up charging us for the \"free\" appetizer and drinks."}
{"text":"The food was spectacular... I ordered a mango sangria and it was way too sweet even though the waitress suggested it... we started with the bang bang shrimp. I got the rainbow trout with mango salsa, jasmine rice, and steamed broccoli... I was stuffed when I left. Now the waitress was not very good, but the manager LJ did come around and ask us how everything was, that and the fastness of the food really impressed me! Will be returning for sure!"}
{"text":"I visited on Saturday 1/16/15. Of course it was a busy Saturday night, and that is to be assumed. The pace was poor in every possible way. With a reservation, we still waited over 45 minutes for a table. Not even an apology was offered. After being seated, our server did not greet us promptly. There was no silverware given to us (or even offered), nor any appetizer or bread plates offered. After we asked for these, we were told \"there aren't any clean plates\" and \"we are out of silverware\". Eventually our server, Sheretta H, brought us two rolls of silverware and said \"these are the last two rolls\"- leaving the other couple at our table without any silverware. The pace of receiving bread was unacceptable ,but we had no plates nor any silverware to enjoy the bread anyway after it finally arrived. By the time we did receive silverware and plates, the bread was cold, and salads were getting stale sitting in front of us. Of course, no apology was offered for this. My wife promptly ordered a glass of wine when we sat down, and it actually arrived one our later. No apology, no acknowledgement by the server or mention of why that would happen. The pace we received the check was unacceptable, the pace we received our copy back to sign was completely unacceptable. No apologies offered. One of the entrees received was incorrect. Our server was quite truly the worst I believe I have ever experienced during a dining experience. We were beyond disappointed. Be prepared if you do decide to visit, and make sure you request a server other than Sheretta H."}
{"text":"I eat here all of the time. Usually the service in the bar area is slow, but if they realize it, they make up for it with a free appetizer without having to say a word or show any kind of frustration. Serving staff has great personalities and great sense of humor"}
{"text":"Overpriced. Decent food. Unimaginative. Not worth the premium dollar.  The shrimp appetizer is excellent.  Been twice, unimpressed for the cost. Better value elsewhere."}
{"text":"Tried the bang bang shrimp, calamari, mussels, and the beets and goat cheese salad.  bang bang shrimp reminded me of honey walnut shrimp dish at Chinese restaurants... It wasn't anything spectacular.  the calamari was just ok... I've had better.  the mussels were great I definitely recommend it.  the most memorable dish was the beets and goat cheese salad. I don't know what they did to it, but it was freakin good... probably the best in head yet.  in my opinion the place is a bit overpriced, however one can't really go wrong with this place especially if they enjoy fish. the staff is friendly. oh I ordered an old fashioned and it was one of the best I've had. so I would come here again, but I'm not sure if I'd have any strong urges to come here like some other places."}
{"text":"Bonefish, where to fish the most delish!  I said it once and I'll say it again.  Bonefish Grill, in my book continues to be a Seafood lover's place if not paradise!  Of all the fish and seafood restaurants my wife and I have had the opportunity to try across the country, Bonefish Grill (BG) continues at the top 10 Seafood eateries in the country - regardless of which one you try. With over 200 locations across the country to boast of, and despite the volume and their size, they have found the secret of keeping their quality successfully good, service as good and as exemplary as humanly possible, excellent attention to detail and an ability to adapt to their communities and environs!  We just recently visited one of their newest restaurants, just five days after opening.  This is a time in a Restaurant business that the restauranteur wants to go by quickly because of how hard it is to avoid errors and disasters.  Let me say, they will not let you down.  We did not spot any disasters, only the opposite.  Recently having moved to Phoenix, one of the few restaurants we missed greatly from the East Coast was BG.  But now they're here, and let me tell you that it is the Fish and Seafood place to go.  The place whether you have simple or discriminating tastes.  We decided to order from our old BG faves to see if they kept their excellence across the country.  We started by cooling off with two refreshing cocktails - a Moscow Mule and a White Cosmopolitan Martini... both perfectly prepared as if the bartender had been doing them for years!  We continued in with a fantastic rendition of a large Tuna Sashimi.  Perfectly prepared with just the right amount of sesame seeds, and cooked just right!  Prepared elegantly with each required ingredient.  My wife and I can continue to say WOW! when having it.  As I've said in the past, most of their offerings tend to always be in my top ten list of always well prepared and served.  This new location is fantastic that it has the opportunity for you to dine in their regular dining area, their casual bar surround booths, and the actual bar and very, very nice, is their ample outdoor seating area.  Our next picks for dinner included Chicken Tacos with an incredible execution of Lump Crab & Corn Chowder with some bacon - simply marvelous.  Although I also had my serving of the fabulous Chowder, I had the Tempura-style Battered Fish & Chips.  Enjoyed every morsel and tidbit.  Being the fan of their east coast rendering being North Atlantic Cod, I was glad to find their use of Alaskan Pollock which like Cod is a mild-flavored white fish with a delicate and flakier, yet slightly denser in texture.  Not my all-time fish, but worked very well with their fantastic batter.  We topped off our meal with their fantastic Brownie - just great... 'nuff said!  I only have one question for corporate: Bouillabaisse, Cioppino, Caldo de mariscos, Riblji paprika, or Zarzuela - will we see a rendition of Fish/Seafood stew anytime soon?  I must also mention that Bonefish's commitment Nationally to its professionalism, services and attention offered by both our Server Colette, and knowledge and caring by the Floor Manager Rhonda, cannot be found in a more upscale bistro. Whether you want to lounge at the bar, or dine in the restaurant, we highly recommend it!  By the way, be ready for crowds in the near future though, this joint is going to be really, really very popular.  We'll be back again, and again... Keep it up Bonefish!  Profiter et bon appétit!"}
{"text":"I've been to bonefish a few times and the food is delicious. They have a great menu and delicious cocktails. The one I go to is right outside the mall so you would think it was busy, but it's not. So why only 4 stars? Well that brings me back to my previous statement.  They haven't been busy anytime I've been, but every time I go, the service is super slow, and I mean I waited almost 15 minutes for some water, and the food was slow coming out also.  Aside from that the food was great, they servers are nice, but just don't go if you are pressed for time."}
{"text":"Bonefish Grille was a Lovely Spot to take a Date. Very classy on the inside and all the waiters and waitresses were very Professional and very cordial. Staff was very knowledgable with the Drink and Food Menus. A very large Wine list and other alcoholic beverages. We started off with Appetizers the Wagyu Beef & Ginger Potstickers and the Bang Bang Shrimp which was simply Delicious!!! The Wagyu Beef melts in your mouth. We shared the Lobster Bisk and Lobster Grilled Cheese not something I would order a lot but it was ok. We also shared the Blackened Baja Street Tacos which were off da Hook!! We washed it down with a Blue Moon for me and a Winter White Cosmopolitan for her, Both drinks were very tasty!!!  Over all I would definitely recommend them, prices a little on the upscale but well worth it."}
{"text":"Met a client here for lunch. I ordered the crab cakes with potatoes augratin. The crab cakes were decent. Not over breaded like a lot of places. Our sever was prompt and attentive."}
{"text":"Good food, great service.. Quiet for lunch during the week, but very busy nightly and on weekends for dinner.. Come early b/c while there is plenty of parking, Concord Mills is always a very busy place to be.."}
{"text":"Had a nice experience here the other night. It was a great place to dine al fresco with enough shade to keep us cool.   I ordered the avocado tomato panzanella salad - so fresh and delicious! I then had the wood grilled salmon with lime butter. Large portion, and also very delicious.   My husband had the bang bang shrimp tacos. I tried a bite and, if you're not trying to eat healthy, get these! Packed full of flavor!   All in all, a very good experience."}
{"text":"It's okay. Great atmosphere but food not so great. I ordered the special,  Swordfish Oscar style and was disappointed when it came out tasting of mesquite.  My Mom had to wait 30 mins for a second drink and my water has been empty about the same time.  My high hopes are crushed."}
{"text":"I ONLY go back to this place for their BANG BANG SHRIMP. The most delicious appetizer I've ever had in my life, be aware it's pretty filling so you do want to share it with a group of people, you could also order it as an entree. Everything else on the menu is alright, a bit on the pricy side but the food quality is excellent!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Our server deserves more stars. The overall food was good because it was what we expected.  The disappointment was the crab rice. It was I think a version of their crab fried rice. Disappointing because they used Spanish style rice and it just didn't make sense. They sprinkled crab on top of the rice and that was about it. Other than that it was good."}
{"text":"The waiter surely knew the menu inside and out. Crazy how they send your orders in from the table, so your drinks could actually be ready by the time you listen to the daily special spill.  The good cam in reasonable time; I'm always cautious when your plate shows up 5 minutes after you've ordered, yet I don't want the 25 minute delay as well. The food was good; full of flavor My wife thought her dish was a little to flavor. We will surely be going back to try additional entrees."}
{"text":"Went on a Thursday and the service was excellent. The food however was high priced but not very tasty. The bang bang shrimp just had too much sauce. Everything else was just bland. In my opinion it's just not worth the price."}
{"text":"We were very excited to see the place packed!  First time visiting Charlotte, NC in town for business.  We were told it would be a 15 min. They got us to our table in about 5 min! Great! Waitress was very quick and pleasant.  Took a little time to get our drinks.  We ordered the bang bang shrimp, sub-par. I ordered the lobster tail with crab rice for a side. My husband ordered the Spicy Tuna bowl.  After sitting and waiting for our meal for an hour my lobster tail was over-cooked, potatoes and crab rice were cold. At least the butter sitting at my table for 45 min over a candle was at a low boil. My husbands jasmine rice was \"crispy\".  The waitress came to check in asked if our food was fabulous?  I explained to her what was going on with the food. The manager kindly came over to our table and comped our meal. I don't want a free meal!!!! I want a good dinner! . Needless to say I will not be back."}
{"text":"Whoa...... don't know what's going on here, but the food was awful!  Some of it was even comp'd by the manager.   Being a chain, I don't expect perfection and we have had decent food at the one in Dallas and receive above-average at the location in Colorado Springs, CO, but this was beyond disappointing.   Would not return if we are ever in the area again."}
{"text":"I don't like giving poor reviews.. but I feel I must.. it takes a lot for me not to be happy with my food..  My husband, son and I wanted to give Bonefish Grill a try.. We found hair in 2 of the dishes served.. their solution was to remove the 2 dishes off our tab.. Never again!"}
{"text":"Chilean sea bass was excellent.  Salad and sides excellent. Service and ambiance also good. We'll be going back."}
{"text":"This spot was tough. We walked in and were told by the hostess we could wait 45 min and grab a drink by the bar, but not specific seats. As we walked to find a set, a server sat us in the forbidden seats. We were confused, but obliged, and then were ejected from the seats moments later by the hostess again. Working out the kinks.  The food was okay. Lobster grilled cheese tasted like a really expensive grilled cheese. Cobb salad was uninspired.   Honestly, our experience was more 2 star than 3, but I feel bad since they are new and still getting their feet wet. Not sure we'll be back, but hopefully theyll get things together."}
{"text":"Time is the most valuable perishable commodity....and the Bonefish squanders it.  Waited 25 minutes to order.  Brought water flask without cups.  Super slow service with rotating staff.  Looking at table with cleaning rag just left there and another table left dirty for 15 minutes and counting.  Food was OK but overall underwhelming effort."}
{"text":"So, in going through the reviews from people who have dined here for birthdays, there seems to be a large discrepancy for what this restaurant actually does on birthdays... not good.  Any good business is consistent, if nothing else.  We went for my birthday and when my partner told the server, she kindly asked me what my name was.  I told her, thinking, \"Oh, they  might write my name in something/somewhere because it's my birthday.\"  Haha.  Nope.  The food was alright.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't particularly good, either.  Unlike a lot of other yelpers, I actually didn't enjoy the Bang Bang Shrimp.  It tasted too much like mayonnaise glopped onto mini cocktail shrimps.  So, at the end of our meal, I'm expecting something for my birthday.  Especially in going through these reviews, I'm peeved that they selectively give out birthday cards?  Rude.  But, so anyway, then it comes... we died laughing.  Not even an appetizer dish, I don't know what it was, but it was a minuscule dish.  Strawberries.  Not big juicy strawberries.  Baby strawberries.  In... wait for it... ice cream?!  Nooooo.  That'd be too extravagant.  Four tiny globs of WHIPPED CREAM.  With cheapo Hershey's chocolate syrup drizzled over top.    I mean, this restaurant isn't super pricey, but it's no Applebees or Red Lobster either.  Our bill was a good size for our party.  And THIS is what they/management/whomever decided to give people on their birthdays?!  Oh, and sometimes cards with coupons inside, but that's a hit or miss - too bad so sad?  Ridiculous.  Yeah, we won't go back."}
{"text":"Hi, I just ate here for the first time. I found a new restaurant with a lot of bugs to iron out.  It's pretty clear that the wait staff are very inexperienced as were the hostesses.  The food we ordered was sub par and if not for JD, one of the owners there, I would not have considered ever going back. JD is the right guy to turn the place around so I'm gong to go back in about a month to give it another try. They have only been open for a few weeks and they deserve the time to get it right. I really believe JD will get it done."}
{"text":"I would give a half star if possible. The bang-bang shrimp we started with had no crunch...but lots of a mayonnaise type sauce...not very appealing! The scallop dinner that I had was so salty that I had to send it back...could not eat it...and I'm a chef who takes liberty with salting my food well to bring out the flavor. Also the corn side dish that came with the scallops was horrid..thick and pasty...like it came out of a box! Three bartenders on duty...we ate at the bar with 7-8 others, had to ask for everything...they busied themselves with everything but customer service. Been there 3-4 time with ok results. But will not return after last night!"}
{"text":"5 stars for the service with JAY.  If you can, sit in the bar and ask for jay.  If you can't sit in the bar - still ask for JAY and you won't be disappointed.   The kitchen can be slow but JAY delivers on expeditious, courteous and appropriate service.   I don't love the chowder due the corn and the base but the burgers made folks in my dining party excited.  Tried the 3 course with the 6oz sirloin @ 160degrees with augratin and fries. The fries have a little batter to them and crisp. The Au gratin was served with bread crumbs (which I personally never care for) yet the crumbs didn't distract. They kind of helped. Tasty and creamy. Dessert was as close to beignets as I've had in this town and I'd highly recommend. They are served two (2) to a plate with chocolate sauce and caramel sea salt. I'd prefer a cherry or raspberry but my word so flaky, so decadent, so PERFECT rolled in sugar (which I don't have to have).   The dumplings impressed the dining crowd as a burst of flavor. I'll try something else next time but I prefer Bang Bang shrimp without the sauce. Yeah! I said it.   Happy HOur still in effect. Give it a try. Ask for Jay."}
{"text":"When did couscous become a seasonal vegetable?  The menu indicates that a fresh seasonal vegetable is served with entrees, and couscous is what we got.  Was not expecting that, would not have ordered garlic mashed potatoes if we knew.    Salads were served and before we had a chance to get halfway through them the waiters were trying to stuff the entrees on the table (the entrees didn't fit and one of our group who refused the entrée until she finished her salad then had to wait and wait and wait to get her entrée back).    My mahi mahi was not moist at all, a seafood joint should be able to cook seafood properly, especially when they rush the entrees out before the salads are done."}
{"text":"The original location by my area in seven hills shut down but luckily I was excited t hear that they relocated by town square.   The restaurant is located in the outskirts of townsquare by las vegas blvd at the NE section of the shopping center.  We arrived just before dinner was starting and were seated in the dining area within a few seconds.  The waitress was complaining to the manager saying, \"really i have to do all these tables?\" This really irked me and literally made me want to leave but i figure i would at least try out the food and enjoy my company with my lady.  Initial Service: The waitress wasn't very pleasing as she came to our table with this \"Why do i have to serve you\" sort of expression which continued to ruin my experience there.  Took about 15 minutes for our drinks to come out.  I got the bonefish martini which was actually pretty good and gave a decent buzz.  She got the fresh cucumber collins which was refreshing.    Entrees: We read all about the bang bang and we basically did a drive by.  We ordered bang bang tacos,  bang bang chicken and bang bang shrimp lmao.  Plus it was a good \"bang\" for the buck being $6 for each entree during happy hour on i think it was a wednesday?  The entrees were all very good but it was too much bang.  The sauce they use is like a spicy mayo with green onions.  Ending:  I ordered another martini and noticed something shiny in my drink.  Thought it was a golden ticket for Wonka's chocolate factory but it was aluminum from a whisky top.  I reported this to the manager and he apologized by saying hes not sure how they got there but it must've been from the ice machine.  He ended up comping one of our bang bangs and getting me a new drink \"metal free.\"  Overall:  Poor service with the waitress.  Great alcohol and good food.

{"text":"Just had my fifth visit in two years.  Better open seats at bar for happy hour than other places nearby, good selection, nice apps on HH menu.  As it was a Tues, it was jam packed for their special.  Another local even was there eating and highly suggested it.  https://www.bonefishgrill.com/specials/hooked-on-tuesday  After the visit, I didn't quite comprehend the bill when signing it.  I was wondering how I could rack up $50 on two simple drinks, but assumed that the wine was made with napa valley gold or something.    After seeing the bill at home, and the $30 error, I called to see if I could have it fixed.  The manager knew what it was about right away, and apologized for the error, comped the bill and apologized again.   Kudo's for solving this before I had to question the options when I called.    +good parking +lots of seating at bar on crowded night +better than average beverage selection for chain seafood place - not one up in NW location yet."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a date night dinner out last evening at Bonefish grill & loved it.   Despite the full parking lot, we were seated immediately, were provided excellent service, and wonderful food & cocktails. Great quality from start to finish. Atmosphere is slightly upscale but comfortable. We will definitely be back.  The bar is attractive - makes you want to sit there for drinks & appetizers. Our table was ready so quickly that we didn't need to do so this time, but maybe next visit.   More specifics:  all were great & I would order again  Winter White Cosmo drink special Craft beer choices Bang Bang Shrimp Warm bread with dipping oil & seasoning Wedge salad Shrimp & scallops Tuns were all perfectly cooked.  Sauces complimented nicely but didn't overpower flavors of the amazing sea food.   Took some pics & will comment on those."}
{"text":"Husband and I went for dinner. The place wasn't packed but had few patrons. Ordered the bang bang shrimp...pretty good! Loved that it's served with chopsticks. I ordered grouper with colossal shrimp and hubby had fish n fries. I'm noticing food coming out consistently to tables except ours...it took too long so of course I mention this to our server who says \" everything is being made fresh\", well I sure hope so! Our food comes out and so does the manager who comes over to ask if everything is ok. I mention the wait and he pretty much says the same thing (Listen, I expect my fish to be fresh, smh). That put a damper on the dinner and I was just ready to leave. Took my food home and put it in the fridge. The next morning, the smell was so fishy I couldn't stand it! I immediately through the food out! Scratching this place off of my list! If my fish wasn't blackened I may have known I was served fish that \"wasn't so fresh\"."}
{"text":"Food tasted great but had some issues with the service. I asked what the purple topping was on top of my salmon and the server didn't know. I waited for about 5-10 minutes before he returned with the answer:pickled onions. I scraped them off.  My sister asked for an ice water and received water without ice. She asked again for an ice water and the server proceeded to stand at the table explaining why they don't serve ice in their water. Tip for the server: just get it. We don't care why."}
{"text":"After  moving to Charlotte from Arizona we were so happy to hear Bone Fish was going to open.here..We go a couple times a week and have been Dine Rewards members for over 4 years it is a great program. I can't say enough about Pearl the Hostess she is always so pleasant and cheerful, all the staff is Great!!! but enjoy when we get Kyron, Brinkley who is a sweetheart and also Deanna..The food is always Great....and the managers always stop by to be sure everything  it to our satisfaction...."}
{"text":"Our first visit to this new restaurant was not a disaster, but the experience was far from satisfactory.  We visited about 4:30 on a Saturday, it was crowded but we were seated in about 45 minutes.  Our waitress was very good and prompt to our table.  We order a calamari appetizer which was very good with a delicious dipping sauce, but after that the experience went downhill fast.  We waited a long time to receive our dinners.  Several nearby tables who were seated after us received their entrees before us.  We were not in a hurry but it was frustrating.  Our meals did arrive and looked appetizing.  My salmon was a a little dry, but overall tasty.  My wife really enjoyed her shrimp and scallops, though her green beans were undercooked and tough.  My son's fish and chips had an off flavor, I am not sure what was wrong but he did not finish it.  Our overall experience was decent, but this restaurant needs to do better if they would like us to be regular customers."}
{"text":"We had a 6pm reservation and the hostesses sat us immediately.  When we say down there was a mix up and our server didn't stop by and check in so we sat for several minutes.  I approached the hostesses and they sent DANNY the manager over and he fixed things up quickly.  He have us an appetizer on the house and got bread/water/cocktails and drinks for my kids ordered immediately!  He then assigned us a very conscientious server, Heather, who was AMAZING!  Everyone makes mistakes, even restaurants but what matters is a humble attitude to fix it.  Danny and Heather and the hostesses were amazing!"}
{"text":"We've only been to Bonefish once, but when there are so many better alternatives, I simply wasn't impressed enough to rush back any time soon. Don't get me wrong, it's not  really a baaaaad restaurant in any way, but don't expect to leave Bonefish saying, \"I can't wait to go back!\"  We got there early, which was beneficial for the lack of a wait, but it quickly filled up as we ate our meal. I would expect a wait if you're not in there by 6 or so.  The service was good, with both the hostess and the waitress being amicable. The waitress was helpful in answering any questions that we had about the menu. The atmosphere is pretty nice, but also pretty standard for a chain seafood place. Think Mitchell's or McCormick's with a hint of P.F. Chang's darker colors and vibe.  Anyway, the food was why my review was 3 stars. We heard a lot of people recommend the bang bang shrimp (as well as seeing just about every other table ordering them), so we gave them a chance. My first thought? Too much mayonnaise-based sauce. I mean, I'm a fairly gluttonous American who enjoys some disgusting mayo from time to time, but c'mon...why even serve anything of any quality under all of that sauce? It's all you taste. The shrimp were good, but I got pretty bored with the sauce after a while. If there's a next time, I'm going to see if I can get a ramekin of sauce on the side instead of having the shrimp pre-smothered.  As for the entree, my wife got the shrimp and scallops with the warm mango salsa. I tried them and they were okay, but fairly ordinary. The veggie sides of asparagus and broccoli were also fairly basic, but kudos to them for having healthy sides.   I opted for the fish tacos, which were basically in the same vein as my wife's meal. Unfortunately, as the bang bang shrimp are lathered in sauce, the tacos come with too much sour cream on them. I really wondered what the point of the sour cream was, actually. Cajun styled fish (but not spicy in any way), lettuce, mango salsa...seems good enough, but no...must. add. sour cream? Again, I like sour cream, but it's a really unnecessary ingredient here.  As you can tell, the themes at Bonefish are basically this: if you order something simple, it's going to be pretty boring and you'll wonder why you didn't just make this at home. If you order something \"adventurous,\" it's basically only adventurous because it's going to slopped over with sauce. In my mind, places like Bonefish that advertise on the premise of having higher-quality fish, should really let the fish do the talking, not the mayo and sour cream."}
{"text":"I had eaten at BG in Denver on several occasions, the most recent was about 5 years ago.  I was happy to see their entry or re-entry back into the Phoenix market.  I had planned on visiting as soon as they opened, but life kept getting in the way.  I finally made it there tonight (3/1/2015).  We enjoyed the Bang Bang shrimp appetizer.  It was everything that I remembered from years ago.  If you visit, and enjoy a little spice as well as shrimp, you must try it.  For a main course I had the wild caught Mahi-Mahi with the lime tomato garlic seasoning choice.  It was exceptionally good.  The seasonal side that came with it was a hybrid couscous.  I did not care for that at all.  The free choice side I chose was steamed broccoli and it was slightly over-steamed, but flavorful.  My friend had the lobster stuffed butterfly shrimp.  She said it was very tasty.  The seating arrangement is split about half and half between a dining room and a bar area with dining.  I plan to go back soon and give the kobe beef burger a try."}
{"text":"Picked up a friend from Bellagio and brought him to Bonefish.  We both had the grilled Trout and it was fabulous.  I also had the salad wedge with blue cheese and they put a very nice amount of crumbled blue cheese along with a great blue cheese dressing.  Atmosphere is very warm and friendly.  Lookinf roward going back soon!"}
{"text":"I came here with two colleagues on a Monday night. I'm not sure if they were understaffed that night or just a lot busier than they usually are, but it took a really long time for our waitress to come over and take our order. We ordered drinks to start off and didn't receive them for about 15 minutes. By the time we ordered we decided to skip having any appetizers because things were moving so slowly. It was nice that they brought out warm bread and pesto to hold us over until our meals arrived!    I ordered the large portion of salmon with the seasonal vegetable (snap peas) and really enjoyed the entrée. My colleagues ordered the Chilean sea bass with jasmine rice and the filet with garlic mashed potatoes. Besides the garlic mashed potatoes, we all liked our meals. I would give the food 4 stars but the service 2 stars, so I decided on a 3 star review to balance the two out."}
{"text":"Shelley. The rudest manager I have ever experienced at a restaurant.  We had a 12:30 reservation and didn't get seating until 1:30. No management was to be found but when we sat and enjoyed ourselves we were asked to leave when the bill came.  Shelly does not know how to be respectful or considerate when bringing this up and we all felt uncomfortable dining here  Do not recommend, the lobster steak Benedict's was not even good"}
{"text":"This was our first experience at the Bonefish Grill and it was great! The food was delicious and the service was spectacular. We didn't get our appetizer before our meal but our waitress took care of it and the restaurant manager came over and apologized and gave it to us for free! Everyone was professional and prompt. Our water glasses never made it past half empty and even with the appetizer mix up our experience was pleasant. We'll definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"Located in Town Square. I went to a private event here, so this is more of a review of their catering. The room was private and the noise form the dinning room was drowned out. The service was very good and unobtrusive. The food was fantastic. I recommend having your event here. Live It Up You Are In Las Vegas For Cryin' Out Loud!"}
{"text":"We always enjoy our local Bonefish in Colorado and decided to visit this Bonefish.   We were happy we did. Everything was perfect and our server, Collin, was her name (i believe) was spot on.  She may be one of the top 5 servers ever.  Always appreciate good service."}
{"text":"I would give this restaurant a 5 Star Review based on the excellent customer service that we received from Bernadette and Dana, but to be fair to Yelpers, some of the dishes were only \"ok\".  My husband had the lamb and enjoyed it immensely!  A couple of my kids had the burgers and loved them!  My daughter really disliked the fish tacos.  She said they were way too sweet as they were covered in mango salsa.  So, Bernadette got her something else that she loved!  The Bang Bang shrimp tacos!  Bang Bang shrimp was the highlight of our dinner!  I did not care for the crab cakes.  They were a bit soggy and I prefer mine with a nice crunchy outside.  I would also stay away from the chicken sandwich.  It was burnt, had very little chicken and the flavor was overpowered by too much spinach.  The service and Bang Bang shrimp is enough to bring me back!"}
{"text":"Went to Bonefish Grill on Tatum for the first time yesterday and really enjoyed the experience.  My friends and I had salads.  The presentation was very nice and the chicken and shrimp were cooked to perfection.  We arrived around 4:15 p m on a Sunday afternoon and the place was empty but soon filled up.  Our service was good as was the food.  I will try them again."}
{"text":"For being a chain this place is pretty good! Their bang bang shrimp is amazing and one of the reasons I keep coming back! The service has always been great and we were even served free apps one night while we waited for tables to open up! They are very kid friendly which is great when you want to eat some place nice with the little ones along. Great drink selection as well!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time 2 months ago and we had a really nice time. Food was great and our server was ok. I noticed that the hostesses were not so friendly. Called today to see if the \"seasonal\" lobster rolls were still on the menu and the response was \"it's only Monday so we will be fine unless we run out.\" Ummm WHAT? First of all, it's THURSDAY my dear and Second, do you understand what SEASONAL means? Very rude and snobby phone girl. Not sure if I want to bring this establishment any new business if that girl is the first impression. I'm gonna check out the other location and hope for a nicer time. At least maybe a friendlier /happier group of people that enjoy their jobs."}
{"text":"I would give 3.5 stars if I could but yelp doesn't do the half stars. All or nothing baby. This place is a nice chain and that's about it. I had the lobster grilled cheese with lobster bisque, tasty! My friend had the shrimp tacos, also good but not as good as mine. I'm only rating low because lack of desirable service and prices for what it is. Just know what you're getting  when you come to bonefish: overpriced and nothing to brag about chain food."}
{"text":"This place was good but wasn't great. The service we received was a star but the food was about a 2 star.   Crab cakes 4/5 stars Moist and lots of crab meat but was kinda lacking flavor.   Salad 3/5 stars  The dressing was good but some of my lettuce and greens weren't fresh and crisp   Tacos 2/5  The slaw was kinda sour to taste but the meat was ok"}
{"text":"Limited menu, staff seemed very unhappy to be there - the atmosphere was very down.  Food took awhile to arrive.  Lilly's chicken was good but served with the weirdest mixed vegetables - corn and lima beans - yuck.  Two in our party had fish and chips which was very greasy and pretty small portions.  Probably will not be going here again."}
{"text":"We went there Saturday at 7 (reservations are a good idea).  Service was a little slow because they were slammed.  We had the bang bang shrimp appetizer and loved it.  The bread was very good.  The \"seasonal vegetable\" was a garbanzo bean and kale creation that I didn't care for, but my wife liked.  Our vegetables were broccoli for me and green beans for her, and they were prepared properly.  My wife had the shrimp and scallops, and I had crab stuffed tilapia with gruyere cheese and capers.  It was cooked perfectly, and tasted good.  Our server Terry was very helpful and friendly,  With adult beverages, our check came to $64.  We will be back."}
{"text":"I came here for a special event. Our group had the room in the back which was private and had plenty of space for a group of about 50 people. The space also blocked out sound from the dining room so the speaker was easily heard as well.   The service was okay. Food came out quickly and courses were properly timed. Our event included wine, but my husband and I couldn't get the attention of a server to get wine. It seemed like the only people getting wine were the ones tracking the servers down for it. Other than that the servers were good at clearing plates and refilling waters.   The food was okay, but similar to what you'd expect for catered food. I've eaten at this chain outside of a special event and thought the food was better on a regular visit. The servings were very small for all of the courses. The steak and potatoes were bland. Dessert was okay, but not great.   The room is great for events, but the food is just okay when served to a big group. I think I'd pass for a group event, but on a regular basis this restaurant is okay."}
{"text":"I recently ate here for a work lunch. The location is easy to access and parking is plentiful even at lunch time.  The hostess greeted us immediately and seated us. She was friendly and welcoming. Our waiter arrived shortly after to take drink orders and he was also friendly. Our service was good overall and they were quick enough to be a good lunch hour option.  The lunch menu had some nice options with reasonable lunch prices. My boss and I both opted for the lunch combination of two tacos (one filet mignon and one fish) with crab and corn chowder. I liked the flavor of both tacos. The meat and fish were both well prepared. The tortillas weren't as soft as I prefer and that threw off my overall enjoyment of the tacos a bit. The chowder was fine, but not nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Town Square can get a bit boring after a while, so it's nice to have a different option to try out.   The menu consists of various seafood items as well as more standard fares such as chicken, beef, salad, burgers. I chose the salmon with pesto and green beans (also comes with a side of zucchini and squash). The salmon was delicious and both vegetable sides were a good complement. Wish I could have asked for more zucchini/squash!   Definitely recommend checking this place out if you're looking for variety! Good for groups of 2-8, in my opinion. Can be a good date place as well ;)"}
{"text":"This place rocks!! Lovely atmosphere and wonderful prices and choices on the menu. My hubby and I went here for date night and it was well worth it!! Having 2 little kids we are definitely on a budget and this place did not disappoint. I had a nice glass of wine and he enjoyed one of their signature beers. Bang Bang Shrimp appetizer was delicious!! We each tried their evening specials for an entree and it was amazing. Sea Bass for him and Tuna for myself. It was seasoned well and cooked perfectly. This place knows their seafood. No room for desert but we will definitely be back to try it!! Our bill came less to $60!! Score!!! Oh, and our waiter, Fernando was super helpful and great personality!!!"}
{"text":"First time here, and so impressed with everything from the service to the drinks to the food!! We started off with the bang bang shrimp appetizer. Amazing. The fresh bread and pesto also a gem. I got the grill Atlantic salmon with lime, garlic, and sun-dried tomato with broccoli and garlic whipped potatoes. He got the Chilean sea bass with mango salsa with truffle macncheese. Everything was SO delicious. Mandy was our server/bartender and super nice."}
{"text":"My husband and I took my brother to BFG for his birthday lunch. We had excellent service thanks to our server, Colette!  Loved the bang bang shrimp and felt it was as good as what we had in Orlando. Our server even brought my brother a birthday dessert. Overall we had a great experience!! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Wonderful sea bass with mango salsa and tonight we had flourless brownie with rich vanilla ice cream. Bonefish Grill is always consistently great with food and service. Our waiter, Matt, was super friendly and very attentive. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I don't write reviews often, or ever really but my experience here was god awful. We started with a decent bottle of white wine, very over priced for the quality, and some of the boom boom shrimp, which was suggested to us by our waiter and that was fair at best. I ordered a steak, filet, and it was the worst cut of steak I have ever had. Which is saying something because I have had a lot of steak. I couldn't believe it was actually called a fillet. The waiter was fine but this was one of the worst restaurant experiences I've had since moving here."}
{"text":"my girlfriend and i ate here Saturday night with reservations for 5 o'clock. i am sure glad we did because shortly after it got real busy. the food there was awesome. if like seafood you will like this place. the only thing wrong with this place and why it got a 4 star rating instead of 5 was that it was a little pricey.  other than that excellent food. the staff there was very nice too. definitely would return."}
{"text":"Consistently great food as other review have said. One of my favorite restaurants!"}
{"text":"Another good meal at Bonefish last night.  Service continues to be excellent and food delicious and reasonably priced.  All of these are a tribute to management, which hires personnel who seem to genuinely enjoy their jobs and help each other.  If your server is presently unavailable, just contact another one who will take care of your needs."}
{"text":"Ate here last night.  Started out with the Bang-Bang shrimp.  They were good.  Then for my entree I had the Scallops-Shrimp, which were really good.  Also loved the hot bread that came out with dipping oil.  I kinda felt like the waiter was hoping we wouldn't stay long but still decent service.  Overall, a good meal/experience."}
{"text":"I'm a regular at this bonefish grill location there's always great service and great food. I love the lobster bisque and the ahi tuna bowl is my absolute favorite second only to their bang bang shrimp and their Chilean sea bass. really good food really good service great ambience"}
{"text":"Pros: Consistently great service consistently good food  Cons: it can get a little loud so if you're trying to go for a quiet place the weekend is not the time you need to go to this restaurant"}
{"text":"What makes Bonefish so special is that they serve high quality food at very reasonable prices. They offer seasonal cocktails at $5, specialty drinks at around $8. Their filets range from $19---$21-- with a side. Why pay strip prices for comparable food when you can get it here for so much less! Friday night was all a buzz here. We left our name with the hostess and told it would be about a 40 minute wait. No problem since we wanted to get drinks at the bar. The bartender was very nice and attentive and also quite knowledgable on drink selections. Not more than 10 minutes passed until we got paged for our table. We ordered the Hawaiian martini and let me say that I felt like I was in Hawaii after taking a sip of this beautiful drink accented by coconut water.  After enjoying fresh hot bread and pesto, we started with the ahi sashimi...one of the best and better than Roy's. The ahi was so delicate and had a perfect sesame crust with a light wasabi sauce that wasn't overpowering but complimented the ahi. We both order the filet mignon...available in 6oz or 8oz portions. Get it with the Gorgonzola butter! Service timing was on as the sashimi came out within a few minutes and our filets were ready right after we finished the appetizer. The filet was cooked to the perfect temp for each of us and very flavorful even without the delicious Gorgonzola butter...but it made it so much better. The potatoes au gratin were the perfect portion and cheesy with a breadcrumb topping. Our favorite dessert here is the strawberry shortcake. In season strawberries with whipped cream atop fresh creme anglaise (it's like melted rich vanilla ice cream) and a flakey shortcake biscuit. Great way to end our wonderful meal. Being a fan of the other location that closed on Eastern, I was thrilled to see Bonefish re-open here at Town Square. We will be regulars here."}
{"text":"Good food. Service is.....not good enough.  Eat already few times in this chain - this is my first time in Madison, so I can compare"}
{"text":"The food was amazing when I ate here last night. Lobster, perfect, Filet, perfect! The wine was perfectly chilled and above all, the ambience was exceptional.   I was here to catch up with a good friend and we were both over the moon with the experience. Why? Well one young lady, Jillene! (I hope I spelled that right) she served us.  Jillene is very bright, beautiful and motivated. She has a gift that if you could bottle it, it'd be worth millions! She was attentive but not overbearing, charming, polite and respectful. I have eaten at some of the worlds finest restaurants and never before have I met someone who was an absolute 10/10. She is the real deal!  This young lady made our evening, no doubt! Ask for her by name (sounds like \"Jolene\", think Dolly and Miley) and tip her very well. Encourage her, she is going to go far!    One of the best meals I've had in a while, thanks to you also Chef.  Update: visited again tonight and Stephanie took great care of us and the wonderful Jolene greeted us like family. Truly from the manager to the floor, the kitchen to the door, this place is special, do yourself a favor and eat here!!! The Butterfish is so amazing it sold out!!!"}
{"text":"Had a late lunch with the hubby today... haven't been to Bonefish in awhile and probably won't be back any time soon. Unfortunately the food quality has gone down but the kicker for us was the very apparently sick waiter. Sneezing continuously in FOH and even heard him from BOH (seated by the kitchen door) to the point he wiped his nose on his work sleeve as he approached our table to handle our setting. Manager was oblivious. Gross! No thanks Bonefish"}
{"text":"Fantastic Seafood and great bang bang shrimp appetizer.  The Lobster Thermidor Mahi Mahi is amazing as well!!"}
{"text":"I was pretty happy to see Bonefish pop up in Las Vegas.    We stopped in as a family on a Saturday night (admittedly, after another restaurant next door had a 45+ minute wait) on a whim (read, no reservations... not usually a good idea for this town) and were seated immediately even though the restaurant looked pretty busy.    The hostess was cheerful and friendly.  Our waiter (Josh W. I think-- it was a few weekends ago) was great.  Fantastic attitude, expertly handled multiple random questions from the child, and was attentive but not overbearing.  He answered all of the questions we had and made good recommendations on the menu.  The rest of the staff who helped out at the table did so without getting in each other's way, were all professional and courteous, and they were all smiling (I remember, because I wasn't having the best night and it really made a difference in my attitude to see them all smiling).     The food was great, portions were just right and flavorful.  The atmosphere was appropriate for a Saturday night dinner.  It was conversation-level noise, not too much but not too quiet.   There is a children's menu and non-seafood choices on the regular menu."}
{"text":"Three words....bang bang shrimp! Now I know what all the rave is about. Had they not returned to Las Vegas I would've been forced to wonder what the wonders of bang bang shrimp is!!! Yay!!!  Just an FYI their happy hour specials rock harder than most places! Considering their right beside Texas de Brazil makes it tough to decide which to visit for dinner. Spread the word and spread the love this place can not disappear once again!!! :)"}
{"text":"Service was OUTSTANDING(Brochelle)....service couldn't have been any better We had lunch....I had corn chowder soup(luke warm) and street tacos with filet mignon...hubby had salad with chicken street tacos...We both left HUNGRY..portions are not good if you have an appetite although the food quality was good."}
{"text":"Hidden happy hour gem in Town Square! $3 house wines...yes please!   Bonefish is located on the outskirts of Town Square, on the corner of Las Vegas Blvd. and Sunset. The restaurant is quiet and pleasant in ambiance. Service is always friendly and professional!  On Tuesdays they have lobster specials. Lobster appetizers starting at $5 and a lobstertail dinner for only $15! I've been twice during happy hour which is from 4p-6:30p. I enjoyed delicious lobster and the $3 house wines... Heaven! They have Bang Bang Shrimp specials starting at $5 on Wednesdays which is delicious too!   Definitely recommend if you enjoy wine for a great happy hour in Town Square. Looking forward to being back."}
{"text":"This chain located in Town Square (right next door to Texas de Brazil) has been one I have been meaning to check out. I have heard friends and co-workers tell me it is pretty good. I'm always a little hesitant to check out a chain over a locally owned place, but it wasn't half bad.  I came here for a friend's birthday, we were seated in the large, darkly lit dining room. I began my meal with a really great riesling - Chateau Ste Michelle from the Washington valley. A very easy-to-drink, and not overly-sweet riesling.   Next we had appetizers - crab cakes, which were disappointing, small and poorly plated. Served with some sort of sauce I did not partake in.   The ceviche app, however, was pleasing - with large portions of shrimp, scallops, and perhaps some type of white fish? I wasn't sure. However, I did enjoy the sliced fresh jalapenos and chunks of avocado. This ceviche is served with a good portion of chips that are salted.  I had to have their \"bang bang\" shrimp which I have heard rave reviews about. Instead of getting it as the app, I got it in their \"Bang Bang Shrimp Tacos\" - which come out in a set of three with flour tortillas and your choice of sides - I got the kettle-cooked potato chips. Overall I would say \"eh\" to the tacos. I thought they would be more spicy - they were not. Fortunately, the tacos were filled with shrimp, so you get a good portion for $13.50, and the tacos themselves were generously sized.  Lastly we had their macadamia nut brownie, which arrived warm and gooey, with raspberry sauce and scoops of vanilla ice cream. We all shared - and we were all stuffed. But, at the end the management also brought my friend out a plate of chocolate-dipped strawberries with some cream and we also had those.  Service was up-beat and management did check on our table. At the end of the meal my water glass was left un-filled, so that was kind of disappointing, but none the less, a small ding against what overall was a good experience.  I would come back, especially since their menu has a lot of seafood items (obviously). I would say good for a party, especially if you have people that are not \"outside the box\" with their food choices, but you would rather go somewhere other than say, Chili's or Applebees."}
{"text":"5/12/18 Bread and pesto olive oil was a nice start. The tropical heat martini was outstanding! The new cosmos was good too. The wedge salad and crab cakes were good. Service was extremely slow and our waiter kept forgetting to bring things or check on us. The atmosphere was not as good as expected for menu options and prices. The scallops were small and lacked flavor. Shrimp had a good taste. Au gratin potatoes were awesome, mashed potatoes not bad. Sea bass had good flavor."}
{"text":"First time here. Read the reviews and wanted to see for myself. The atmosphere is nice, casual and quite. Very nice staff and waiter.  I got the Snapper & Shrimp with jasmine rice.   Unbelievable! Lightly blackened but not too much and very tender. Cooked perfect and tasted like it was caught today!  Awesome!"}
{"text":"Really good food and Amazing serves.  All i can say is you need to make a reservation cause the wait can be a bit long.  This place isn't too expensive but it wouldn't hurt to get the 15% off coupon from the internet.  Before you go look online at the menu and daily specials cause there are not a lot of options.  Everything on the menu looks and sounds delicious tho.  I must say i loved this place and will be making a second appearance, once i find a special occasion."}
{"text":"My first visit was better...more for my money.  I tried the Georgia Peach martini.  I expected more sweetness from it, but other than that, it was quite delish! If you haven't been, make sure you make reservations. And you have GOT to try the Bang Bang Shrimp!"}
{"text":"I recently checked out bonefish grill for brunch with my boyfriend. I've had bonefish down in Virginia and absolutely loved it so I was excited to finally check out the Pittsburgh location.   We started off with a order of the shrimp because I remembered how delicious it was last time I had it. Definitely one of my favorite items. The right amount of breading and just enough spicy mayo to give it just enough kick. I also ordered a mimosa which I could tell was clearly homemade. If you aren't a fan of pulp in your orange juice I would not recommend this mimosa for you.  Everything else on the menu looked delicious but I always end up going with eggs benedict if it's offered. Sadly this eggs benedict left me very disappointed. The eggs were very rubbery and it just didn't taste good overall. As you can see from the photo they don't look all that appetizing either. Not sure what their recipe for hollandaise sauce is but they should probably work on it.   While my experience definitely left me disappointed and fell short of my expectations I would like to come back for dinner some time. I've heard good things from friends and I remember loving the fish tacos last time I had them."}
{"text":"Excellent seafood - they have a gluten free menu.  And it doesn't  smell fishy when you walk in and that you know is a sign up fresh fish .  Also excellent service"}
{"text":"I was in town for work and needed some lunch stopped in at Bonefish. It was an odd time in the afternoon so there weren't that many people in the restaurant but the bartender was very attentive and helpful.   The food was consistent to what I was hoping for and the price was reasonable!"}
{"text":"Nice place, great menu.  Always busy but wait staff is very accomodating."}

{"text":"I've been to several Bonefish outlets before my Yelp tenure, mainly on the east coast, have always enjoyed it, and never wrote a review.  This wasn't my usual Bonefish experience, but was one of those freebie seminars that we can't seem to resist when they're at a place we haven't yet been to. An hour of harangue for a free dinner.  Seems like a good trade-off to me, unless the dinner is a rubber chicken affair.  Fair to post this?  I think so, because the good was good, the bad bad, and what we had to choose from was identical to what's on the regular menu.  I didn't get to have the Bang Bang Shrimp, which has always been a favorite.  I think Bonefish started this craze, and the world copied them.  But I mention the crustaceans because I've never had a Bad Bonefish Bang Bang, and I suspect they'd be the same here.  The freshly-baked bread was excellent. I would love to have tried the olive oil/pesto dipping sauce.  But there was a sicko woman sitting across from me who, after moving my knife toward herself, then pushing it back to me (touching the blade), and then repeating that action, took command of the dipping sauce.  She'd dip her bread, then double and triple-dip again, in a Seinfeldian absurdist manner, until all the bread and the oil were gone.  Waitress brings new bread, new sauce, and it's Take 2.  Finally, I just asked for some butter and I hogged the whole wrapped pat.  I ordered a glass of their house red Sangria on my own tab.  It's made with cab, has a bit of blackberry syrup, and came adorned with two blackberries and a half slice of orange.  It was tasty, but in my book, a good Sangria has to be spiked with brandy or some other booze to give it a kick.  But at $6 a glass, I knew that wasn't happening.  The Caesar Salad was just ordinary.  I asked to go easy on the dressing, so the server brought it on the side, just fine with me.  The raison d'être for my four stars, however, was the Grilled Salmon.  That was piscine PERFECTION, slightly undercooked, moist, tender, and absolutely, mouth-wateringly delicious.  A fairly large portion, about half and inch thick, and 24 hours later, in the middle of the night when I'm writing this, I am absolutely craving another hunk of that beautiful creation.  And, having foresworn all farmed or Atlantic salmon, I vow never to learn the provenance of Bonefish salmon, lest I have to avoid ordering it in the future.  It was THAT good, and the five stars for that raised the average rating.  But I'm also trying to put out of mind that past performance is no guarantee of future results.  My choice for topping was the mango salsa - good, but without a scintilla of the spice that the waitress said it would have.  The dish came with broccoli, undercooked in a strange way, and rice.  The people who ordered the filet mignon got asparagus, which looked a damn sight better, even to this broccoli-lover.  Dessert was a fudge-covered brownie with a dab of decent vanilla ice cream.  The brownie was very, very cocoa-y, and had a strange consistency, kinda like Passover cakes that are made with potato flour - a very esoteric reference, I know.  Sorry.  I'm not sure I liked it.  But after tasting it, I know I'd never order it.  Not that I ever order dessert.  Just sayin'.  We will go back, because it was Salmon Chanted Evening.  Oh, stop groaning."}
{"text":"Well...I can say that if you sit at the bar you are definitely greeted like long lost friends!  That was very nice.  Lee, Rafi and another girl were very friendly and helpful and made sure we had what we needed throughout.  We ordered the Pecan Trout and Grilled Tilapia.  My sweetie is trying to eat healthy, but I don't think he was satisfied with the Tilapia...not their fault though...it was very good, just more plain than I think he wanted.  The portion for that was a bit small...it looked as if 1/3 of it didn't make it onto the plate.  The Pecan Trout was huge and delicious.  Very well cooked and flavorful.  I ordered the rice with it not realizing it came with couscous.  I wish I had a double portion of the couscous or maybe tried another veggie...the rice wasn't that great.  Decent pricing and a good selection of drinks & beer."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is nice. Lobster , bang bang  shrimp and sides were lovely. Enjoy this place plenty."}
{"text":"Was in Ohio and business and needed to grab dinner after flying in as my hotel didn't have room service (Grr).  4 colleagues and I went to Bonefish which was right by the hotel and had a wonderful meal.  We were there @ 8:30 pm and there were only a few other occupied tables.  The menu has a nice selection of meats to choose from, with multiple preparation/presentation styles.  I loved this.  They also have a nice list of sides to choose from, so you can build your meal as you want it!  Disclaimer:  This is not a place for vegetarians - I didn't notice any veggie entree options.  I got the salmon with lemon butter sauce on the side, with steamed veggies and a garbanzo bean/spinach salad side dish.  It was all delicious.  My colleagues got other fish dishes and seemed pleased as well (ahi/mahi mahi).  Service was friendly.  Parking was a snap.  We didn't have to wait too long to be served, and were out of there by 10 (party of 5 took about 90 minutes from start to finish).  Next time I'm back in town I will likely go here again simply because it's a great meal right by the hotel."}
{"text":"Took the girlfriend out for a nice dinner. She loves seafood so this is a perfect choice! I really recommend it for a nice occasion! Started with the \"bang bang shrimp\" wasn't bad. The \"crispy\" shrimp lose most of their breading when tossed.. they must make this stuff in huge bowls and dish it out, it's their most popular item. Drinks were good and decently priced. The girl had the special Dynamite shrimp, which was amazing! Great flavor and a ton of shrimp! I had he Filet Mignon and crab cake with the truffle Mac and cheese. The Filet was perfect. Perfectly cooked and seasoned. The Mac n cheese was amazing! Only reason they are not getting the 5th star is because of the crab cake. It was pitifully small, and lacked seasoning. It could use a few more ounces of crab and flavor. I do recommend this place! Make reservations if you can, since they prefer that. I asked for a table for 2 on a Sunday night, they must of had 6-8 empty tables and still asked if I a reservation..? If I did I think I would have said so.. also the two $$ is a bit deceiving.. I'd go with $$$ if your not going for the 55$ meal for 2. Our waitress was really nice and Overall had great experience!"}
{"text":"The restaurant didn't feel very clean and organized but overall not too bad. I had to wait for awhile to get my table clean before I was able to sit."}
{"text":"Bang Bang.  Eric and Sam gave excellent service.  Bonefish at Summerlin has a great ambiance and great service.  We were celebrating our friends Birthday and the staff went above and beyond to ensure our friend had a good time!  Eric and Sam  were accommodating and they are truly as asset to the Bonefish franchise.  The customer service was better than I expected.  I strongly recommend this location for groups and families.  Eric we truly appreciate your excellent service and compassion to support your front line staff.  Eric is a great manager, visible, and on the floor with his servers.   Bartender made the drinks that were superb! We ordered the Old Fashions & Silver Cucumber Margarita w/ peppered rim."}
{"text":"There wasn't anything particularly good or bad about our lunch. We had the bang bang shrimp as an appetizer. It was quite tasty. Lunch for me was the fish tacos... they were okay.... a lot of mango salsa and not a lot of fish. The home made chips served with the tacos were good. My husband had the red snapper from their specials. He said it was okay, not really good, not really bad.  I wish I had a more exciting review to write, but truthfully as boring as this review is..... that is just how boring our lunch was."}
{"text":"So far, we enjoy Bonefish HH with great drinks and food we got, also like to say great thing about our bartender Rachel, she made my drink so smooth and top it with great service, definitely we'll be back for more."}
{"text":"The seafood is so fresh and well prepared!  Service is impeccable, and everyone is so friendly!  Love this place!"}
{"text":"When I review take-out I don't think it reflects eating in. So I generally never give stars based solely off of takeout... But this was far from ideal so whatever.   The steak that came with the Steak and Crabcake entree was an extremelyyyyy thin cut. We also ordered the Bone-In Ribeye but it was actually a semi-boneless rib steak. WHAT. The?! There was a piece of plastic in my mussels. The avocado in the Ahi Tuna bowl was very bruised, and the tuna had a shimmer green sheen?? Can't decide if that's normal or not, but definitely not appetizing. Shrimp Pad Thai was not great.   I listed five issues but only the bone-in ribeye issue and the plastic in the mussels issue are really what made it a one star experience. I personally do not like paying for something that I don't get it, or having inedible material in my food. How the food tasted was actually probably a three star, but I can't forgive those two things."}
{"text":"2 pm on a Monday afternoon. We were promptly seated in the dining room. Both the dining room and the bar had a fair number of patrons.  We ordered from the lunch menu and the servings are very large. We plan on splitting on our next visit. I ordered the bang bang shrimp tacos with a cup of clam chowder. 3 soft shell tacos made with a generous amount of spicy, slightly sweet shrimp, lettuce and tomatoes. The chowder was very good. My husband ordered the fish and chips. 3 large pieces of cod breaded and deep fried. The breading was very crispy and not greasy.   Our server was friendly, efficient and brought warm rolls soon after we were seated."}
{"text":"Long overdue review! This review is for my 2/14/16 visit here. Will never come back. Not sure what the deal was with the service today?? We all suspected that perhaps the waiter Eugene was new. He was friendly enough but that's about where the positive ends.  - The server brought bread out to the tables after we were done eating our entrees - Food (everything!) was SO SALTY. I'm talking beyond what is normal for restaurants adding excess salt. My friend ordered steak and she was embarrassed that she had to send hers back because of how salty it was. They brought her another and it was just as bad.   - Prices a bit on the high side - SALTY!!!!! I know I said that already. I still can't get over it. Holy salt!!!!  - Lot of mistakes with entrees and sides. I ordered a side of steamed rice and got some weird cheese potatoes. Eugene took it back to the kitchen and brought me the correct rice right away, not sure if perhaps the mix-up was the kitchen's fault? Other people at my table also got wrong sides, or their entree orders were completely wrong.   - Servers made us pass steaming hot plates to the back of table instead of individually serving dishes to us. Huh? Who does that? Is this pure laziness, lack of training, or bad management?  It was my friend's birthday celebration so we tried not to moan and groan about the service too much...but sheesh!!! and one of our friends asked the waiter if he could bring out a special birthday dessert which  she offered to pay for, and they didn't even have a candle. I know this is a petty little thing.. but thought it was a little odd for a franchise restaurant like this to not have birthday candles?   Overall very unimpressed and disappointed with the food and service."}
{"text":"I have such mixed feelings about bonefish grill. I personal didn't care for the food. The other 2 in my party really enjoyed there's so I guess I need to bump it up a star.  Location: next to Flemings in the town square mall (separate buildings from the rest of the mall). Nice venue, mixed age crowd, overall it seems to be catering to the 30+.  What we got: 1. Mahi mahi (good! 8/10), with asparagus and the Mac and cheese (delicious....as all Mac and cheeses are...but I've had better) 2. Atlantic salmon (8/10), broccoli and mash potatoes  3. Basil pasta, cream pesto sauce with fresh chopped veggies (I would give it a 6/10, my friend thought it was a 10/10). 4. Special ahi ahi in wonton tacos (9/10), comes with a salad. Out of everything I would get this again  5. Teryake bowl (5/10), not bad...not good either  6. Bang bang shrimp (9/10) lots of crispy shrimp with a spicy cream sauce over it.   Staff is good when not busy, service goes down on the weekends.   Would I come again? Not for dinner, but I would like to try their happy hour!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is a solid 3 or 3.5, but the waitress is a 5.  She was the best waitress I have ever had in Charlotte, and I wasn't even in Charlotte.  Her demeanor was that she loved her job and enjoyed helping people make food choices.  She was spot on regarding her recommendations and our bread kept coming as we used it to dip up sauces that she recommended we do so.  The mussels were good, most of them were still in the shells and not lost in the sauce.  The sauce was sweet and somewhat savory.  This was the highlight of my meal.  I ordered the trout and it was overcooked, not so overcooked as to be completely ruined but overcooked enough for someone less skilled to be on the safe side for illness purposes.  I have eaten and cooked enough fish to know when someone has the craft down or they don't.  I need more data points to confirm if it is the entire cookstaff or just one person causing this.  They give you rich sauces and that might be a tipoff that they are compensating for well done fish.  I didn't have any cake or creme brulee but others did and they indicated doing so is a must if you like such after dinner flourishes.  I will be coming back but I won't be getting the trout again.  I think you will enjoy yourself if you decide to make a night of it."}
{"text":"What a delight ! Came here for dinner a while ago & it was pretty good but... Came here for HH and was blown away by the fantastic dishes , flavorful appetizers & great service from the bartender ( Dylan ) . We ordered Old Fashioned's & Bang bang shrimp with the mouth watering  mussels ! This will definitely be our new go to local watering hole ! This spot had a nice atmosphere & friendly wait staff & great HH discount prices .. Perfect."}
{"text":"A girlfriend and I recently came here for a Sunday bite after some shopping. We were able to catch the brunch menu, but I wasn't feeling like breakfast food so I'm glad that had a couple of lunch options too.  To start we both had the blackberry sangria which was $12 for bottomless as an add on to the entrees. The flavor was very good, it honestly tasted just like juice to me which is typically a dangerous thing. For a meal I had the caesar salad with added shrimp. The shrimp was cooked perfectly and the portion size of the salad was just right. I also enjoyed the complementary bread with oil that they give out in the beginning.   I'd defiantly love to come back here again to try more of their lunch and dinner options. I love the location and ambiance of the place."}
{"text":"I returned for my second trip in a week with a party of 6. Everyone ordered something different so I had the pleasure of seeing and tasting more dishes. The lobster fried rice is out of this world good! The lobster bisque was fresh and flavorful. This is being said by someone who does not care for lobster and I would certainly order both dishes.   I ordered the basil fettucinni with salmon. It had a bit of a citrus flavor. Just a tad bit too much, however, I added some cracked pepper on top to calm down the flavor and it helped. Dish was still great.   And of course, the bang bang shrimp were still bangin'!   What would make this a 5 star would be adding more to their menu. It's fairly small. That being said, I do think there is a payoff to that which is better quality food with smaller ticket times. Larger menus can make this a bit problematic. Still, adding more variety of seafood, maybe some steaks and one additional kind of burger along with their Kobe burger would be ideal in my opinion.   I will be a regular diner."}
{"text":"I am writing this review as I wait for my table to open. We are currently at hour 3. We were told at the door that the wait would be 45 minutes.   At the hour and a half mark, the hostess offered us a free appetizer (for a party of 6).   I was planning on writing about the food, but we never got it.   I will legitimately never come back to this restaurant or any restaurant in the chain."}
{"text":"The family ate a Bonefish last night.  This was our third time there.  The initial two times were excellent.  The food was cooked very well, however, this time the food was greasy.  My wife's bang bang shrimp tacos were especially greasy.  My daughter's fish strips were very very greasy.  My guess is that the oil was not hot enough causing oil to soak in.  I had the miso seabass.  It was not great and I love seabass.  They used  what I think was a cheap General TSO sauce on it.  Usually this is an A+ but last night it was a D or C at best.  The service was excellent.  The service personnel were very attentive."}
{"text":"I have eaten at several other Bonefish locations, but this was the first time since they opened in Pittsburgh. There was a wait despite our having reservations. Well we had a drink and went outside under some sorta warm heaters - in was unseasonal, but it is still January! Long story short, they forgot is and deleted our reservation. I can't say enough to about Angela and Chris (management) and our server who took every opportunity to make their blunder up. Drinks were awesome, apps generous. And the shrimp and scallops that my daughter, daughters-in-law and I all ordered with varying sauces were grilled perfectly. The only drawback was, in an effort to get things rolling, our server did not mention any of the specials. I'll have to save those for a return visit."}
{"text":"Consistently wonderful food, service and specials. So often restaurants coast or decline, but Bonefish never disappoints. From Brunch to Happy Hour and everything in between, it's always a pleasurable experience."}
{"text":"This is the second Bonefish Grill I've been to in a few years. The other one was up north.  My overall experience was so-so but the food was pretty good. We went on Mother's Day. I believe someone in our group made reservations so there was no wait.  Here's how it went down from beginning to end.  1. We were seated at an \"extended table\" in an awkward location. Right near the front door and the \"extension\" seemed to be a small table that was shorter than the main table and tilted towards the floor the slightest bit so we had to be careful NOT to put anything near the join. Which was hard to remember because the whole shebang was covered with the same piece of butcher's paper (?).  2. Our drink order was taken. Drinks received soon enough but someone in our group had to ask for bread.  3. Food order taken. I applaud the staff for getting everyone's food out almost simultaneously. We were a party of nine or 10.  4. Wait staff was very attentive but forgot the side sauces some asked for.  5. Leftovers were boxed to go upon request but returned to the diners (me included) without a bag. Initially I thought they didn't HAVE bags. Then I noticed other diners exiting with bags so I asked and received.  (It just makes sense to me that a customer leaving one's establishment with... anything would be given that item in a BAG. A bag displaying one's establishment name or logo is also a means of free advertisement as I will re-use a good bag until it falls to shreds.)  6. The waiter knew to ask if  and how the bill should be split.  Peeve: The way their prices are displayed on the menu.   By the way, my meal was delicious. I wasn't in the mood for seafood so I ordered Lily's Chicken. It was delicious."}
{"text":"I've been here three times, and my final conclusion is: meh.  It's not awful, but it's not worth the high prices either.  It's very nicely decorated inside though and our waitress couldn't have been better.    My latest visit we ordered ceviche to share. It had no citrus flavor and the chunks of fish and scallops were very tough and fishy. The shrimp in it was ok, but this wasn't nearly as good as the civiche at Mitchell's.    I had a blackberry red sangria which was pretty good and reasonably priced at $6.00.   I had the Lily's chicken for dinner,  because fish and chips, and crab cakes on past visits weren't great.  The chicken had wayyyy too many greens on top, and the goat cheese was very sour. And I love goat cheese. Their mashed potatoes are very good.   Three of us shared the macadamia brownie...it was a very small portion for the price and was more like a crumbly cake than a brownie. Another \"meh\" moment.   Someone got the sirloin and crabcake dinner and really liked it, and another in our party got the salmon with mango salsa and said \"it's just ok\" when asked.    The 5 year old tore up the popcorn shrimp and fries.    Two of us put our food on the same check.  We had $55 in gift cards between us and still had to pay $20 each. Almost $100 for a shared appetizer, 2 dinners, a sangria, and a shared dessert. All of which, except the sangria and mashed potatoes, were just mediocre?  No.      There are too many great places around with reliably good food to go back here.  While i don't hate it here, i don't love it either. For the price, I'll stay with Mitchell's or Bahama breeze!"}
{"text":"830pm already out of beet salad. I'm sad .  Oh well.  Jesse had ordered what he thought was clam chowder, but it was corn chowder.  I tasted it and said, \"hello, it has bacon, its corn chowder!\"   It was Good Friday so it was no meat for us.  he verified with a server and they were kind enough to understand and gave us a house salad.  Ashley was our server and she was quite delightful.  Very prompt with service and not over checking in on us as we devoured our food.  Maryland Crabcakes kind of small, but I guess it matches the price. It's the lump type of crab cake if your wondering, what every crab cake should be! Not as thick of a patty, but in flavor, delish.  Side sauce complimented it as well. I think it was a spicy mayo sauce.  I went with the Chilean Sea Bass since it was a recommended entree.  I got the full order and I'm glad that I did.  If you are familiar with my appetite, I eat a lot .  It wasn't as flavorful, but i did order the sauce on the side.  It had more of the grill taste than flavor.  It was served with garbanzo beans and asparagus.  For those that are looking for healthy options, this is the place for you.  But if you have a sweet tooth like me, you need to try their brownie a la mode...hot brownie, drizzled in raspberry sauce, with macadamia nuts and topped off with vanilla ice cream.  Whoa, I just drooled.    Four stars for my first try, I'm gonna find a dish that will be my go to.  I loved the healthier options that i could choose from.  I am definitely returning and I do recommend."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to early dinner with our 10months son. Very pleased with everything from service to the food. Fast service, polite and professional personal and good food."}
{"text":"Horrible. Don't go here! The upside is the friendly staff. The downside (and it's an important one) the food is terrible.   We went here for lunch today. There were three of us so we ordered a few items. The calamari was overly breaded and not very tasty. The corn chowder had a distinct and weird aftertaste. The crab cakes (which DID NOT have lump crab meat) were mushy and watery. The fish and chips... I can't even think of how to describe them... Gross. The Asian Slaw was the only tasty thing we had.   If I could give zero stars I would. This place is a step down from Red Lobster.   Not worth the money. Not worth getting frustrated over. Just heed my warning and stay far far away."}
{"text":"We had not been to Bonefish for years so we stopped in after church Sunday around eleven. Crowded early. We chose to sit at the bar. Food was good, not great. The service was excellent. Our bartender, Doug really made us feel comfortable. He also makes a great margarita. Thanks Doug."}
{"text":"Probably the best happy hour!!  We had 3 apps, shrimp tacos, spicy chicken bites and blue cheese chips. All were great !!   Finished with the Cob salad, couldn't eat it all. Presentation was spot on flavor was awesome!   Def on the go back to list !"}
{"text":"Love it !  EXCELLENT food and great service. Plant to be back again .I have ordered a few things on the menu, but my favorite would have to be the bang bang shrimp. I would recommend anyone to Bone Fish ."}
{"text":"Had to change my review and drop them down to 2 stars. Had a terrible experience, and management wasn't interested in hearing about my experience.  This place is great, for a new restaurant. Keep in mind it takes a little while to get things moving smoothly. The Coconut Shrimp was amazing. Great crab cakes. The filet mignon I ordered Oscar style was perfect. My only complaint was the wait time for drinks. Each drink took about 10 minutes to arrive. All in all, a very good experience, and I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"What a joke. Wanted to try this place since I love seafood. My mom and I ordered an ahi tuna steak specified from the server as sashimi grade and the thing came out completely grey. The server said it was only that color because it was over cooked, so he said they would make a new one and it would be the correct deep ruby color. Unfortunately it was still a disgusting color although \"rare\" that go around. The manager came over to our table to apologize and insisted we look at the menu to order something else. We ordered some grilled shrimp  to go with the ahi so we decided to just for the the scallop and shrimp skewer. It was going pretty well and my mom and I were talking about giving this place another shot. Shortly after those words were spoken I cut into a scallop and took a quick bite.. Looked down and it was raw. At that point I didn't even say anything we just wanted to get out of the place. Just to top it off the $17 ahi was taken off but the $18.90 shrimp and scallop skewer was added to the bill. At this point just hoping the bite of the raw scallop doesn't make me sick. Definitely don't recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"I love this place and to be a chain restaurant they've got it going on.  Three words: Bang Bang Shrimp!  If you've never had it, get it!  They usually have some great drink specials as well."}
{"text":"This may be one of 2 dinner places for me to eat at when in Vegas....and it is even in other locations! I tasted 3 red wines and chose Dona Paula \"Los Cardos\" Malbec from Argentina by the glass ...thank you waiter for being sure I liked what I chose! Chilean Sea bass with mango salsa, jasmine rice and sautéed spinach was wonderfully delicious. My friend had Atlantic Salmon with herb pesto and doubled her spinach choice. Dessert: delicious Creme brûlée  Waiter was excellent. Sound proofing on ceiling was wonderful as we could carry on a conversation even while this place is packed with people and 2 TVs are on side wall with closed captioning. Great experience; will check you out other places in my travels!"}
{"text":"Our company had our annual Christmas party here and the venue was fantastic.  Thankfully the food was on par with the location and ambiance.  From start to finish, the quality and service were all excellent.  Started out with the Bang Bang Shrimp, easily one of the best shrimp appetizers I have ever had.  The sauce and flavor of the shrimp is just to die for.  Oddly, they give you a substantial serving of shrimp as well whereas most seafood places hold back on the portions to save money.  Kudos to Bonefish Grill for getting this one right.  I see why everybody starts their dinner with the Bang Bang Shrimp.  Had the dumplings as well and while they were good, I would probably try another appetizer due to the menu being pretty extensive.  For the entrees, my wife had the Tuna Steak and I had the Filet Mignon.  Both were excellent and we would order them again, however the huge surprise was the mashed potatoes that came as the side.  When you imagine mashed potatoes and how they should taste and how the texture should be, these were on point.  I look forward to the next visit to the Bonefish Grill to check out other items on the menu.  If they're anything like what I've already had, it won't disappoint."}
{"text":"I have to admit this is my favorite \"chain\" restauraunt.  It's consistent in menu choices, quality and service level.  It's mid-priced but no matter where you are in the country you know what to expect.  They easily accommodate preferences and preparations to align with taste and dietary requirements or preferences.  They now have a frequent diner program that with three visits gives you a 50% off/ $20 off coupon!"}
{"text":"Conveniently located at the entrance to South Hills Village mall, Bonefish Grill served up a very good meal, with a great wait staff, and a manager that visited each table, asking if everything was cooked to order, and asked if the service was excellent.  That counts for something and is appreciated.  Our meal started off with fresh bread, with olive oil for dipping. Bread was amaze balls!!! That's very tasty btw!! Bang Bang shrimp for an appetizer, consisting of crispy fried shrimp with a creamy, spicy sauce, 5 stars!!!!! I had the Shrimp Pad Thai, very good, ample portion size. My friend had the Carribean Wild Mahi Mahi. It was delicious, wood fired, fresh, flaky, excellent. Sides were creamy mashed potatoes, French Green Beans, and wood fired shrimp. A great meal, I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"The updated menu is so much better. I really enjoy my steak dinner the steak was cooked to my liking I thoroughly enjoyed it. The service was so fast and attentive. Must I say I enjoyed the experience.  My daughter had the pecan parmesan crusted rainbow trout she said it was delicious."}
{"text":"I have been to Bonefish Grill several times and have always been please with my meal and the experience. It gets very busy during dinner hours, so I highly recommend making a reservation. Otherwise, you may be waiting at least an hour. The restaurant is very clean and relatively new looking. Staff is friendly and service quick. Prices moderate.  I always get the Bang Bang Shrimp which is one of their signature dishes. I like it as the appetizer where you get a heaping mound of perfectly cooked shrimp in a delicious sauce!  I think this place is similar to the seafood experience Red Lobster strives for but I think it is done much better here. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"If you read through the other yelp reviews on Bonefish Grille you will come to the conclusion that this restaurant has decent food but terrible service.   Well Bonefish Grille is nothing if not consistent.   We made a reservation for around 7:00 and were seated right away. We then spent the next 5-10 minutes waiting for the waitress to come over and get our drink order. We ordered our drinks and the bang bang shrimp appetizer. Another 5-10 minutes pass by and our waitress comes back to take our soup/salad and dinner order. We asked her for some bread at this point because we were starving.  Our bread and salad/soup came out a few minutes later and we were finally able to eat something. Our waitress came over to check up on us and inquired why we were sent our soup and salad before the appetizer. I gave her a sarcastic reply which was not well received and she proceeded to bring us our appetizer which was followed by our main course 3 minutes later.  It saddens me to give them a 2 star review because the food was delicious we ordered the sea bass and the filet with lobster tail. We also ordered the chocolate creme brulee for dessert which they were of course out of.  4 star food with 1 star service."}
{"text":"Do NOT come to this establishment for brunch. After only 4 drinks they had a manager come to our table and he had the nerve to offer an Uber and said we were not going to be receiving any further drinks. First and foremost, I am responsible for getting myself to my next destination safely and in no way was I or anyone in my group inebriated in the slightest as we had a large meal to accompany these drinks. At their other location friends have reported drinking upwards of twelve drinks with no issue. The manager made us feel embarrassed and arguably ruined the remained of our time in the restaurant. For compensation they offered a meager $10 off.  And then after issues with our bill due our server's error, as she was new the manager returned as we were becoming upset and had the audacity to tell my friend to be quiet and sit down \"Before he had to take it to the next level\" I'm not sure what exactly that means but it felt as if he was threatening to hit him or call the police over an argument no louder than a hushed whisper."}
{"text":"Had a really enjoyable experience here. It was late in the evening around 9 on a Friday and no wait to eat. My boo I ordered bang bang shrimp app because THATS WHY U GO TO BONEFISH AMIRITE? So it was ... Bangin. Then he got the bang bang tacos because he is now a straight up banger. I ordered combo lo mein with extra sauce and I loved it. Also I forget the servers name but she was SUPER sweet. She was telling me about her upcoming wedding and stuff it was cute. I mean id of course go back anyway but now I have to because I'm dating a bang bang shrimp addict. Need to go to bang bang anonymous."}
{"text":"The main reason this place is getting 5 stars is because of the food. It is absolutely incredible!! The bang bang shrimp is flawless and i never even knew i liked calamari until i had it here. The service is on the iffy side but i think that was because we went on new years eve and it was incredibly hectic and busy. Other than that, it was perfect!"}
{"text":"Perhaps I need to lower my expectations when dining out. The reservation process and humorous host were exceptional, and first impressions do count (5 stars there). The interior featured 'chain-decor:' unimaginative, boxy, and drab. To quote Trump: \"no energy.\" Service was...serviceable. The fish was grilled to perfection, however, the mango salsa flavors had not quite married with sickeningly sweet mango and overpowering onions. The white truffle mac-and-cheese was mediocre. The garlic mashed potatoes were perfect, however the spaghetti squash side was not. The entrees were priced right. Will I remember this meal? Of course not."}
{"text":"Great place. Bang Bang Shrimp is awesome as are the Mussels Josephine. Drinks are reasonably priced for an upscale bar and restaurant.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I went to Bonefish Grill this past Monday in Vegas.... All I can say is that I'll definitely be back!  I had a taste for seafood so we came here. We got in, and got seated in about 15 minutes.  The restaurant has a classy vibe to it. Low lighting which was nice for a romantic dinner.  I actually ended up ordering Lily's chicken instead of fish because it sounded sooo good!  (grilled chicken goat cheese, spinach, artichoke hearts, lemon basil sauce, fresh seasonal vegetable) My husband ordered fish and chips. I also ordered a winter cosmopolitan which was sensational along with a Caesar's Salad. My husband ordered Corn chowder with Lump crab. We also got some fresh bread with a pesto olive oil and it was sooooo delicious!!  The salad that I received was just \"ok\". I've had better Caesar's salad. The croutons needed some help as they were small, dry and lacked flavor. My husband's observation was that they use the leftover bread for the croutons. It seems like a good assumption. The dressing on the salad was somewhat flavorful, but not enough on the salad.. Also, there wasn't enough parm cheese, but the greens were fresh. My husband enjoyed his soup. Now the main courses were delicious...That chicken was divine...the goat cheese and artichokes made all of the rest of the flavors \"pop\". I tasted my hubby's fish and it had a nice flavor. You can tell that they used very fresh fish..not frozen.  The service was a bit slow...but still good. Cinnamon was our waitress and she was cheerful and very accommodating.  She even happily took a photo of my husband and I.  All in all...Good food and service... I'll let the salad thing pass...The rest of the meal, service and the cosmo made up for it."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of chain restaurants.  As a matter of fact there are only 3 that I will \"choose\" to go to.  Bonefish has been one of those places for me.  Over the 10+ years that I have been going to Bonefish. I have come to rely on them to 'consistently' provide a great meal...until last night.  Service was slow, our waiter seemed a bit distracted, and the worst part...the food was just \"ok\".  Unfortunately, \"ok\"  isn't acceptable to me when I'm spending $100+ for a meal.    - They either changed their bread recipe or it was an off night.  Either way, the bread had no flavor whatsoever....we were thankful for the flavored dipping oil!  - Bang Bang Shrimp was barely battered, arrived to the table \"warm\", and the sauce was lacking.  -  Calamari was also \"warm\" when it arrived and was seriously under-seasoned. - My husband had his favorite, Fontina Chop.  We almost laughed out loud when the waiter put the plate down and saw the \"tiny\" bit of mashed potatoes and the (6) little cubes of zuchinni that were his sides with the pork.  The chop was tasty and the sauce was delicious as ever, but the chop was a tad overdone. - The soda fountain was off in it's mixture...again.  My son and husband had to send their drinks back for new ones.  The waiter said that he was going to get it from another spot in the restaurant since they sometimes have issues where he got it from originally.  So...if they know it's an issue shouldn't they get it fixed?  BTW...my son reminded us that the same thing happened last time...and he was right. - Kobe beef burger was slightly overdone and wasn't hot when it arrived, but the housemade chips were excellent.  My son ate every one of them and hated to share with the rest of us who wanted a taste.   - Fish & Chips were good, but a bit greasy...and they hadn't been that way in the past. - I had the Bonefish Salad and that was excellent and my guys had Caesar salads and they loved them. - Pomegranate Mango Sangria was delish!  Highlight of the meal....how sad is that?!?  So...it wasn't a terrible meal, but it wasn't what we have come to love about Bonefish.  I seriously hope it was just a bad night, but I am hesitant to go back again.  With so many good restaurant options, I don't know if I'm willing to take the chance on another \"ok\" meal.  It's a shame and I hate to give up on a place that I really love."}
{"text":"Bonefish has become one of my favorite spots lately. The atmosphere and decor of the establishment is fresh and agreeable. I think that you get an awesome deal for the quality and taste of food that you receive. Every Time we have gone the service has been great. Their staff including the manager try their best to provide you with great service. They are also changing and updating their menu, so there is always something new to try. I have been here for brunch which truly is the best deal in town. For just $20 dollars you can get unlimited mimosas plus an entrée!!!! You have the option to pick from lobster eggs Benedict, omelet, french toast and other four options!    Believe me, you will find something you would like. I have also come here for dinner which I always find a good variety of options!   Must order: Bing bang Shrimp: this is a great appetizer, i'm amazed by the large quantity of shrimp. Crab Cakes: you get two crab cakes, but they are filled with tons of fresh and flavored crab!  Shrimp filled with Lobster: you get four large shrimp filled with lobster and capers on top! Even Though there are only four, every bite of it is delish. -available only at the bar Lobster eggs Benedict: available only at brunch Western omelet available only at brunch Tuna bowl: I enjoyed this dish as i'm always struggling to find healthy options. The tuna is very fresh and the price is pretty reasonable. Bang bang tacos: cannot go wrong with bang bang The burger: large with lots of flavor. Do not bother ordering the following: Blackened tacos: unfortunately they need some extra flavor Lobster bisque: although you get big chucks of lobster, it's not really your typical lobster bisque Overall, a great restaurant that won't break your pocket!"}
{"text":"Bonefish has recently redesign their menu. They appear to have a lot of promotions and the food quality still pretty good. We decided to come back for brunch and we found an awesome deal... You can pick you entree (omelets, egg Benedict's or burger w egg) + unlimited mimosa for just 20 bucks!!! This is really the best deal in town!  The food was great and the service was also good! I wish yelp would have the option to give 3.5 score as this place is definitely better than average.  Things to order: kobe beef burger!"}
{"text":"Wow!  Great place!  I love having a high end seafood restaurant  so close.  The decor is trendy but warm.  Yes very good service, very helpful w/o being overbearing.  The seafood is wonderful.  I loved the salmon on the lunch menu.  Chowder with corn looked good.  My guest had one of the combination lunches-a good deal if you  are on a lunch hour.  Yes I will be back!"}
{"text":"The food was actually great but the whole process was so slow.  We had a reservation at 8 PM for nine people on Saturday. I understand that is considered a big group but we weren't seated until 840.. And our food took even longer to come out.  Our family shared the calamari, bang bang shrimp, coconut shrimp, and the salmon asparagus salad.  The bang bang shrimp reminded me of the rock shrimp tempura at Nobu but it also had some lettuce with the sauce that was a little strange.  Everyone enjoyed their mains, which ranged from grilled sea bass to filet mignon to fish and chips."}
{"text":"I love bonefish grille in Cape coral  florida and Lehigh Valley pa but I took my parents to the new one in phoenix and my dad's fish and chips were mostly tempura batter and hardly any fish But our shrimp and scallops were good and the veggies were the best  I'm coming back tomorrow for my favorite bang bang shrimp"}
{"text":"Awww such a nice round of staff. The manager Ralph and our waitress went out of there way to make our experience wonderful. My choice of an entree was not my favorite but the service made up for it. Ralph even gave us a free 2nd trip. Amazing caring staff. Also suggested I get a tour of the fish.... so so sincere about our experience. I recommend this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Three stars? Really, if it were possible to bump it up to 3 1/2, that would be fair. First, let me say that fresh fish in Pittsburgh is always a good thing and reasonably priced fresh fish is a win!   Let's start with the cocktail. A Patron cucumber margarita on the rocks was beautifully presented in a salt and pepper rimmed glass. It was okay, but there was no discernable cucumber to it.   My dining companion enjoyed the always popular Bonefish classic, Bang Bang Shrimp - once again, beautifully presented. She really enjoyed the gentle heat at the end of each bite!  Chilean Sea Bass on the menu? My lunch decision was made, it's one of my favorite swimmy foods! With a choice of several sauces or toppings for the fish (as I recall maybe 5 or 6 options), I went with the mango salsa and a side of green beans. Chilean sea bass is normally a tall piece of flaky white fish, this didn't look anything like it should have. Instead, a thin slice - no more than 1/2\" high - sat on my plate with not a raw mango salsa, but more of a cooked mango, red pepper and onion sauce like no salsa I've ever encountered. A neat pile of green beans lay on the side of the fish. Presentation? Boring.   Taste? Okay, but overcooked...probably because of how the fish was cut. The mango sauce (not salsa) too sweet and gloppy for the fish. The green beans were nearly raw. The manager came to the table to ask how our lunches were. When I pointed out the way the fish was cut, he was surprised and said he was going to the kitchen to insure the fish would be cut properly. To be fair, this location just opened...perhaps the kitchen staff isn't yet up to snuff in how to cut various types of their product yet. The manager did comp the plate.  Dessert. Dear Lord, the Macadamia Flourless Brownie with vanilla ice cream was amazing! But, Bonefish is a sister restaurant to Outback...this is a sister dessert to the flourless brownie there. The macadamia nuts made it even better than Outback!  Would I go back? Sure! You're not paying for fine dining...it's a chain. The food is good (the brownie is excellent!), and the service is outstanding. Bonefish is a welcome addition to the North Hills dining scene. Just wish Yelp would allow me to give it 3 1/2 stars. Maybe my next visit will earn it a solid 4?"}
{"text":"It was a good night!  The bartender Carissa was on fleek, she made old fashions taste like it was a 5 star drink.  My food was good lobster tail was good.  Dem bang bang shrimp delish and ahi tuna was great.  They brought me out some chocolate covered strawberries thank you!! The manager Eric was very attentive and helpful."}
{"text":"Great location and ambiance. Definitely looks like a new restaurant and plenty of people were there on a Wednesday night. The staff was great and so was my waiter!  The crab cakes and creme brûlée were great! My shrimp and scallops with potatoes and veggies was sub-par. The shrimp and scallops were very rubbery and tasted like they still needed some time on the grill to remove the freezer taste. So disappointed.   My cousin and aunt had the salmon with mango salsa and they loved it! Hopefully my next experience will be better."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Bonefish Grill. I was expecting a chain, but was very pleasantly surprised!   The waitress, her helper/trainee, and the additional person who bright out food plates were all extraordinary.   Drinks were phenomenal! I had the Ultimate Infused Dirty Martini, which may be the best I've ever had. My friend had a wonderful, fruity moscato.   Of course, we started with the Bang Bang Shrimp appetizer. You cannot visit without getting this. Delish!  I had the blackened fish tacos, which were great! Don't bother with the greens on the side - basically a small bowl of spring mix. My friend had the panzanella salad, which she liked, but was over dressed for her taste. She kept commenting that the dressing felt like it was \"stuck to her teeth\". Probably just get it on the side and you'll be good."}
{"text":"I went with friend for lunch at Bonefish and sat at the bar.  We wanted to have a cocktail and something light to eat.  We were  the only ones at the bar.  I ordered the corn chowder soup which was OK, a little on the bland side.  My friend had the house salad.  It was good and a nice portion.  Our problem was the bartender.  I had asked for some bread to go with the soup, his reply was NO!  No????? He said they only serve bread at dinner. What????  This is a restaurant, right?  He said it was frozen. hmmmm, OK.  The manager went behind the bar and he asked how everything was, I said fine except I would love some bread.  He just said oh, and walked away.  No effort at all to accommodate me with anything.  Oh, wait, they offered me crackers!  Second problem. We did not want to be inconvenienced by figuring out who owes what so I asked the bartender to please give us separate tabs.  He said OK.  I even at one point bought my friend a drink and said again, please put it on my tab.  So guess what?  We asked for our checks and there was only one check.  So now he is trying to remember who had what, we told him what each of us had and he still got that wrong.    He doesn't seem to have much going on upstairs.  So, I was hoping this would be a great new hangout, the food may be OK, but I have to say the service is terrible.  BTW, I read a previous post, the poster put the picture of her food she had for LUNCH, guess what there was bread on the table!"}
{"text":"Don't worry about coming here. Oysters were dirty gross. Food was plain and seemed like it was just unfrozen. No silverware and we had our food sitting in front of us for 5 minutes. Our waitress did not give us our food and never checked in. Had to go to bar to get silverware. My salad I ordered was a tomato and avocado salad on toasted bread with some arugula. I had about 3 cups of arugula and 2 small slices of tomato and about a half an avocado slice with half wilted arugula. Only thing that was good was the dirty martini and wine."}
{"text":"If there was a way to give negative stars I would! The attitude of the wait staff was terrible, only to be topped by the management. Had to wait an hour for a drink followed by another thirty minutes to order food. The food on the menu is not what is served. The surf and turf beni is made with stew meat not the filet on the menu! Had to go to the bar for a refill, the bartender kept with the theme and put his finger up to tell me to wait. Waited thirty more minutes for a check before getting up and leaving. I would NEVER go back to the restaurant again."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great service!! Had a party of 12 made reservations online which was quite easy. Everything was so fresh from the food and the raspberry ice tea! The bang bang shrimp is a must and on Tuesday they have great specials for dinner I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and cocktails were good, as were the bread and pesto oil for dipping, but that's where it ended for us. I tried their special winter cranberry cocktail and it was delicious. I can't say anything was bad about our experience because it wasn't, but it was just ok. Our served seemed very out of it. My husband ordered the seabass and it lacked any flavor. I ordered the blacked tacos and they were more like an appetizer than a dinner. We decided to try dessert and got their signature oreo flatbread. We would definitely recommend nobody to order that. It was chocolate syrup painted on plain flatbread with some whipped cream and crushed oreos on top. We left feeling like we wished we had gone somewhere else with our rare nights out.  We don't have any plans to go back because there are so many other better dinner options in our area."}
{"text":"Well it started out a bit awkward right off the bat, we had a bearded gentlemen as a server to start, we ask about the happy hour and he explains no happy hour food (his words exactly) but drinks this and that(not his words but not going to write you their drink specials either) , steps away to get some water for our table.   Another patron at my table had a question so naturally I ask the first person I see about whether or not a drink is a well drink, our bearded server comes back as the other guy who was nice enough to answer leaves.   Our server, yes the bearded short haired hot tempered guy gets offended immediately that we were talking to anyone other than him or the other server assigned to our group and says \"we are the only servers for you tonight don't talk to anyone else\"  Things are great so far yeah!?? Anyway we have our water he takes some drink orders and all is fine then he's back and taking dinner orders. Great! Food! 35 minutes or so and still no bread and we had to ask for it! Thank god for this gem named Sadie (sorry if I spelled it wrong) she sure turned the night around the best she could.  Though shortly before her timely and welcomed entrance to our lives he took some dinner orders and then forgot some others at the table, and I don't even think he put in any of the food orders until he got all the drink orders down (we all know they make their money on alcohol) so as more of our party gets here, the few of us in the first pack that didn't order wait until either he finishes taking all the drink orders or thankfully Sadie showed up.  She was quick to take the orders and get any drink orders he missed and was very polite, and she overheard us r alking about the bread we wanted and jumped right on it.  We arrived and settled into our seats (the first group) at around 6:30ish, we didn't get our food until around 7:40ish, as some people were late but some of us ordered well before people arrived but no one cares they just want their tips!  There was some immaturity with the bearded server nearly spilling oil on us and then slamming plates around but..  If nothing else the bearded guy was a disaster and Sadie was an Angel! She did the best she could under the circumstances and really made the night quite enjoyable!"}
{"text":"Winter white Cosmo and black cherry guava mojito! Yummy  The food was pretty good too!  We had originally planned to eat at Flemings because we had a gift card, but upon our arrival we discover that they are only serving by invitation because they didn't officially open until Friday.  But the valet out front pointed us to Bonefish because it's part of the same restaurant group and we would be able to use our gift card there as well.  I am really glad we took his suggestion.  We were just in time for happy hour and the cool thing is they allow you to sit anywhere in the restaurant as opposed to most places that limit seating to the bar area for happy hour.    Service was a little lacking but they were a little busy.  Other than that, our food was really good, the happy hour menu had some good choices but we actually only had the bang bang taco off the list and enjoyed a few things off the regular menu because they sounded so good.  So overall, I would return, and try a few of the other appetizing items on the menu."}
{"text":"I had confirmed a large reservation on November 6th for a party of up to 25 guests. I called the end of November to give them a final count of 20 which actually ended up to be 16 guests that night. The dinner was on December 16th. This was organized to celebrate my graduation from UNC Charlotte and a chance for my family to meet my boyfriend of three years' family. Myself and mostly my family arrived at 5:45 and the table was not ready, that was fine since we were early. After discussing with the managing partner he explained if it is less than 20 guests we would be able to sit at one large table. So, I was expecting to sit at one large table but to my surprise we were seated at TWO separate tables which singled the families out... This was quite upsetting to me because my family could not mingle with my boyfriends family (whom were meeting for the first time). As we sat down we were given regular menus instead of the set menu I had organized. The menu was not already printed and we had to wait for them to be printed. When it finally was printed, it did not look like the menu from the PDF file I was expecting. We also had to use the regular menu for the side dishes, which should have been printed on the set menu as well. My guests were also not informed there was a salad and dessert included by either of the two servers. The two servers we had were not on the same page and seemed unaware of my party even coming in that night. Everything took forever to get to our table. Appetizers were ordered al a cart; as discussed, and took 30 minutes to get to the table. Entrees took over an hour to reach the table. I would have been fine with some of the guests receiving their meal sooner than others due to timing but that did not happen. At the table I was sitting at three meals were medium rare filet mignon and they were ALL cooked well done and dry. A1 sauce was never delivered to our table after asking, but the other table received theirs. The noodles at my table came out ice cold and after reheating the meal, the guest said it really wasn't that great anyways. At the other table my sister order the same; a medium rare filet mignon, and that also came out well done. My brother ordered the spicy tuna bowl and said the tuna tasted bad and didn't get to eat dinner. The managers on duty that night did compensate for only three of the meals, which was the right thing to do. Half of my guests left early because they were not informed dessert was included, and I wasn't there to inform them... After handing one waitress some money to cover the check, we never received an actual check until I asked for the itemized receipt (which a manager handed to me later). A few of the guests that stayed, wanted dessert but asked for it to go (after my side note situation) and that even took 20 minutes to come out. I am extremely upset and disappointed at how the night went, because I felt forgotten about; even when I made these plans a month prior.. The entire time being there was THREE hours.   On a side note, my sister fell unconscious about 5 - 10 minutes after the entree came out. We had to call 911 to come and check on her, she is doing fine; but it was quite scary. The management handled the situation very well and seemed honestly concerned about her. This part of the night was the only good thing that occurred."}
{"text":"I love their crab cakes nice place for a night out and decent food. The Managers are awesome and customer service is great. I had a great waitress I can't remember her name. Middle aged woman she kept the water coming with refills and napkins without asking. We love the area will return soon"}
{"text":"In for dinner after with MLB after Sunday meeting. She found a gift card while looking for something else and decided we needed to go out for dinner and even though I'm not real fishy off we went to Birkdale. Got parked, got in, got a table outside because it was just that nice (if you like it warm and dry with clear skies.) Got settled in with bread and water and bang-bang shrimps were out in a jiff;  a medium bucket of greens and zippy breaded shrimps: so good! Mains were Creole Redfish and an extra fancy fish with a fake name. I knowabouthismuch about fish as I have only recently started eating it regularly and usually have it more than a little carbonized. Redfish was light and flaky but neither red nor fishy as it kept a puddle of pink crawfish sauce from inundating the spoonbreads and green beans. MLB did a good job with dinner: only brought half her meal home in a box. The large portion of fish was firm and fresh under a light sauce and dried tomatoes. Beans and rice were very nice and played well with her Chardonnay. Dessert was a respectable example of mint topped lava cake surrounded by sliced strawberries. All in all a pretty good day :-)"}
{"text":"Been here 3 times. Nothing special. Between the six meals my wife and I have had, only one would be worth coming back for and that's the bang bang chicken or shrimp. Don't even think about a steak at this place, can you say terrible?"}
{"text":"I haven't been to bonefish in years.  My mom has been talking about it non stop.  I'm a member of the dine rewards program and had a 50% off up to $20.  If you aren't a member of dine rewards sign up now!!  All you do is give them your phone number and they apply a reward.  Forth visit you get a 50% off coupon.  That's a win in my book.  The waitress sat us immediately and brought out bread and waters.  The bread was surprisingly good.  I ordered the shrimp and scallops with broccoli and potatoes au gratin.  The waitress suggested some really good sauces.  My meal was amazing.  My husband got the steak and crabcake with green beans and potatoes au gratin.  He really liked it as well.    Service was good and the price was right with the coupon!!! $30 including a tip."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time.  I came here for a birthday brunch and the service ruined the experience. They only had one server to attend to 30-40 people who came for a bottomless brunch. Before even pouring our first glasses, the server gave us attitude and mentioned that \"the minute that anyone becomes too intoxicated, this party will be shut down.\" Although I understand the reasoning behind the warning, it was extremely off-putting.  The next big red flag is that we arrived to a pre-set menu that no one was aware of - including the birthday girl who made the reservation. She had a large party but no one mentioned that she would be under contract with a set menu and price point. This made things extremely difficult at the end of brunch as it took us over an hour to pay and the price/gratuity (which wasn't even well-deserved) just kept increasing.  I've been to bonefish grill before brunch and warned my friend that they would likely \"run out\" of supplies for bottomless brunch. And just as I predicted, they did. 2 hours in and barely any of my friends had been served more than 2 drinks and they no longer had supplies for the mimomas or sangria. Why advertise bottomless if it is not so?   Overall, I will not be back. I paid $40 for a nonbottomless brunch and a brunch burger that was mediocre at best."}
{"text":"More great food from beyond the Strip.  I came here with a few friends visiting Vegas. The service here was divine (as it always in anywhere remotely near the Strip), and the starting bread and pesto was refilled frequently enough that we had to make an effort to save room for the main course.  I had the seared tuna paired with a pinot noir. Definitely as good if not better than I thought it was. My friends had similar success with the daily specials and ahiahi dishes.  My only complaint (as with a lot of restaurants) is that it was really dim inside. Ah well, save a little of the electric bill I guess."}
{"text":"Their brunch menu on Sunday is awesome. For $19.99 you can get a lobster and steak eggs Benedict and bottomless mimosas. One of the best brunches I've ever seen. On top of that, the service was awesome. My first experience there, our server Cassie was super sweet and right on top of things. One of the managers (Eric) was also extremely attentive and while asking if we were ok, we asked about their French toast and what it was like. He so kindly brought us a piece of the French toast just so we could try it. It's dessert as breakfast! The quality of the food is fantastic and I love how the servers wear chef jackets. Nice little touch. I would highly recommend dining at this restaurant!"}
{"text":"It's actually been a bit since I've been here, but I wanted to mention this place for at least two reasons.  One is that it's easy to overlook - there is a big Hops location out front (which has really bad service, or did the last time I was there), and you're likely to not look behind it.  This means that I tend to forget that it's even there.  Add in the fact that it's a strip mall, and you don't go looking for places in a strip mall often.  Two is that the place is actually something of a hidden gem.  Yes, it's a chain of sorts (though I haven't often seen other locations), but they aren't like a McDonald's or anything, so it's still a bit different.  Throw in a helpful staff and tasty selections, and you have a decent place to grab a bite.  As mentioned, they can be a bit on the pricey side (not too bad overall), but it's one of those places that is worth it.  Get over the fact that they are in a strip mall and you'll be fine.  In fact, put them in a different location, say South Park or Uptown, and they'd probably be considered cheap."}
{"text":"We had dinner there last night 9/13/17 and it was the most fantastic dinner we have had in a very long time.  We met Ralph who is the GM at this Bonefish and he is genuinely a great guy.  We had been there a week ago and had not enjoyed ourselves.  We spoke to Ralph and explained the problems we had encountered and he invited us to have dinner at his restaurant and give it another try.  The food was absolutely fantastic, the scallops over jasmine rice in a coconut, pineapple sauce were indescribably delicious.  The grouper with shrimp which I had was fabulous.  Our waitress Debra, was so attentive and sweet, the kind of waitress that loves what she does.  Ralph the GM came over to the table a few times to make sure everything was to our liking.  I highly recommend going to the Bonefish at W. Charleston for dinner, you will not be disappointed.  It was just a great dining experience and I know you will enjoy yourself when you try it. Thank you Ralph for caring about your customers and making sure they do leave your restaurant with happy tummies, and a great dining experience."}
{"text":"The variety of wonderful fish dishes and drinks were outstanding. I found it hard to believe it was a chain as it was incredibly fresh!"}
{"text":"Located in Town Plaza. Place looks classy and upscale.   Food: Fresh fish of the day- I forgot the name of the fish but it was delicious. The only part was missing was lemon. I had it with mango salsa but it lacks citrus flavor. I particularly want my fish went some lime or lemon. Overall it was flaky, soft, and good.  Service: Service was okay. I wasn't blown away.  I'll go here again if I have to. Town Plaza has so many restaurants to choose from."}
{"text":"Came for lunch one day. Got sat in the bar area. Decor was nice. Bartender was friendly. I got shrimp tacos and they were awesome. Large and flavorful! I had leftovers!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to any Bonefish Grill location, so I was excited to try this new eatery in Town Square. My visit last August was pleasant with just minor hiccups. I spoke well of them and planned on returning. Six months later, my dining experience was just okay -- not bad, but nothing spectacular.  By no surprise, I was really taken by their Bang Bang Shrimp ($10.90) -- fried shrimp tossed in a deliciously creamy and spicy sauce. It's their signature dish (complete with trademarked name) and there's a reason they build all their marketing around it. The appetizer, however, wasn't as good the second time around. I'm not sure if it was just the preparation that evening or if that's just how it's served now. They also offer their prized shrimp in tacos and for $5 on \"Bang Wednesdays\" (4pm-closing).  Other appetizers: Twisted Edamame Hummus ($5.50) -- topped with roasted tomatoes, pepitas, and served with crispy flatbread chips and Wagyu Beef and Ginger Dumplings ($9.30) -- pan-seared with crispy onions, Thai peppers, and soy sauce. The hummus was all right, but the dumplings were pretty good.  During my first visit, I opted for the Chilean Sea Bass ($29.90) with Chimichurri sauce (no longer offered) with two sides: Chorizo, Edamame, and Corn Slaw and Red Quinoa Salad. The entrees come with a seasonal vegetable and additional choice of side, however, I requested another side in lieu of the vegetables and paid an extra dollar. The fish was exquisite. All their fish are grilled over their wood and it was delicious. It was a really nice size for the price as well. The Chimichurri wasn't very good though. I really liked the slaw topping, but the quinoa salad was flavorless.   Ruben and I shared the Baja Fish Tacos ($14.10) during my most recent visit. It's made with grilled Tilapia, flour tortillas, mango salsa, lime crema, shredded lettuce, and served with housemade chips. The fish was good, but I didn't enjoy anything else. I'm not a fan of the use of flour tortillas for tacos, I didn't care for the mango salsa, and the lime crema didn't add enough pizzazz. The housemade chips were okay, but had no flavor.  For beverages, my friend and I shared a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc: \"Attitude\" by Pascal Jolivet, France ($36) and I also tried their Signature Pomegranate Mango Red Sangria ($5.50). Both were really great selections. They also have a white sparkling sangria, but the server suggested the red.  Desserts: As a recommendation from our server, we tried the Jamaican Coconut Pie with Rum Sauce (no longer available). It was a warm coconut pie (well, ours was improperly reheated) with very strong rum sauce. Not very good. I also tried their Crème Brûlée featuring Madagascan vanilla custard served with fresh seasonal berries and whipped cream ($7.30) and Chocolate Crème Brûlée - decadent and creamy chocolate custard made with a hint of Grand Marnier and housemade whipped cream ($7.30). The Crème Brûlées are definitely good. I really like that they used Madagascan Vanilla since it has a more robust flavor and the Chocolate version was delicious! That splash of Grand Marnier really made it.  Service has been odd. Both times, the servers have been really nice, but there's been disconnect between the servers and the kitchen or something. The servers would disappear for long periods of time, but otherwise would be very attentive. One of our friends didn't receive his pre-dinner course prior to our entrees, but the server was nice enough to remove it from our bill. It was still difficult for him to enjoy though. Also, there was absolutely no timing between appetizers and entrees. The complimentary bread is delicious, but it wasn't offered the first time.  I do like the ambiance and decor, but it seems to have identity issues. The decor, menu, and prices portray a nice \"date night\" dining establishment, whereas the butcher paper, vinyl tablecloths, and heavily fried menu feel like your typical casual dine-in restaurant (without the benefit of cheap prices). For the most part, the food quality seems (slightly) better, but not sure if it's worth it."}
{"text":"I've had great service every time I come here. Last time, I ordered fish tacos and received shrimp instead. The manager came over, apologized and took the order off of our bill. I understand mistakes happen, and the fact that the manager made it better is the reason I will continue to come back. Great fresh food!!"}
{"text":"I took a group to Bonefish for lunch. I called the reservation in 2 days before we arrived. When we arrived they did not have our reservation so they gave us their private room which was nice (without charge I might add). The food was delicious, the service was a little slow but really considering that they probably were not prepared since they did not write down the reservation, the wait staff did well. I also want to thank the manager who did take care of the mistake and treated us well. Many of our lunch group members had not been there before and said they would go again.  A very pleasant experience. I would also go again. My only other complaint is that they do not have clam chowder. I am always surprised when I go to Bonefish and they tell me that. They only have corn chowder. This is the only restaurant that serves fish that does not have any clam chowder in Las Vegas. Oh well."}
{"text":"They did not take our number when ordering take out, so when we got there we were told one of our entrees wasn't available. It took more than 15 minutes for them to then tell us to pick something else off the menu (which was comped). They also gave us a card for a free shrimp app for next time. We waited at the bar for the food to be prepared, which took almost 40 minutes. The bar was half empty and yet it took nearly 15 minutes to get a drink. Everything is very slow and I'm surprised they didn't make it a priority to get the new item out fast. When we got home the rest of the food was obviously stone cold, the food just average tasting and the portions extremely small. Will not be back to say the least. Hope for their sake they figure out how to run the restaurant smoother."}
{"text":"Seafood is 5 stars, Services is 5 stars (His name is Ryan). Technology interaction to reduce mistakes of order, +1 star. Bang Bang Shrimp plus Bread with Dip are a great start of evening dinner.  Seasonal Menu is impressive. grill mahi mahi with crab lumps is a must try of the 2014 seasonal menu. this is a great place for FRESH Fish, Shellfish and Seafood restaurant.  However, Sprit Drinks can use bit more work (mix with Stronger kick). +1/2 Star, if it will take any more stars rating."}
{"text":"I went there Saturday with my wife and some friends, just before seeing a movie around the corner at the Birkdale Regal Cinema. They gave us a table right away. The waiter was nice and he knew the menu, specials, drinks and ingredients by heart. Overall, it was a great experience and we will definitely be coming back. You can never take good service for granted."}
{"text":"I'm so shocked how much I enjoyed my dinner here this week! I'm not usually a big seafood person and neither is my friend who I went to dinner with. We both realized this looking over the menu and started laughing. On Tuesday, they've got one of those 3 course meal deals. Since we were already there and no turning back we decided to order martinis and just stay. We both had caesar salad which can be awful and sometimes, just sometimes, it's crisp and fresh with the right kind of funky dressing. This was a pleasant surprise! Loved it. I had the salmon with green beans and mashed potatoes. Generous portion of salmon but the sides were skimpier than I expected. Turned out to be enough! My friend had the lobster and was happy with her meal, too. We took our cheesecakes to go. Overall, salad/main/dessert and 1 martini $28 with tip. Not bad. I'll be back! Just maybe not on a weekend based on these other reviews. Sheesh."}
{"text":"My daughter and I had dinner there yesterday, we had oyster Rockefeller it was good, The bread and olive oil delicious, The white truffle mac n chees had no real  flavor, Pot stickers were mushy, we both ordered the lamb lollipops big mistake. My daughter ate one and said it tasted old, I smelled mine an didn't eat them. we sent them back, an hour after we got home my daughter was sick and vomiting.   I was very disappointed since this was our first visit, I think perhaps it was the chef and they are better with seafood, I sent them an email with our concerns we will see,  I would really like to try them again, this will depend on how they respond to my concern, I wont be ordering lamb lollipops again  Very disappointing"}
{"text":"I must say it was a great food, nice environment. We went there for my birthday and ordered bang bang shrimps as an appetizer. The manager gave me a box of chocolates as a birthday gift. Overall great experience."}
{"text":"My mom and I came here for a late lunch. The prices are quite high. Expect to pay about $25 per meal. The waitress, Sola, was very kind. She brought us out a pitcher of water and warm soft ciabatta to start with a pesto dipping sauce. It was Devine! I ordered the fish and chips. The portion was quite generous. However, there was way too much batter and it was over fried. I had a hard time even biting in to get to the Alaskan Cod on the inside. The fries lacked seasoning. When I asked for ketchup, the waitress kindly brought me 1 tablespoon of ketchup and I'm not even joking. My mother ordered a shrimp taco and a cod taco with a cup of chowder. I did not care for the taste of the chowder, i guess it was just different than i was used to. The tacos were Devine, especially the Cod taco with mango salsa. It was so savory and unexpected. The bathrooms were cute and really nice and clean as well. I have to rate 3 stars because my meal was extremely disappointing for $15 but the service was great!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed it, and the people are so friendly! Loooove the bang bang shrimp. I ordered too much for my belly. I got the tempura fish and chips. Way too much but so tasty. I will be back! And Jacob is an excellent waiter."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant and was surprised at the decor and what it look like inside very disappointed yes it was white tablecloths and yes the wait service is awesome but the food does not live up to the expectations I would never return and I would never recommend it very expensive and not worth the money"}
{"text":"Although Bonefish Grill no longer carries 'Imperial Tilapia', which I absolutely love, our server Brittany was spectacular.  Her friendly demeanor and professionalism, along with her recommendations made for a wonderful dinning experience."}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed a good meal here and I continue to like this restaurant chain.  Today, I had their seasonal Curry Shrimp dish and I am impressed. It was a creamy curry , ala Thai-Malaysian style, nice level of heat and tangy lemon grass flavor.  It was better than any Thai-Malaysian restaurant could have done.    If you find this on their seasonal menu,  you should definitely try this.  I would ask if the kitchen can do something special with this sauce. I think it will work very well with mussels and the bang-bang shrimp."}
{"text":"Great place for a nice quiet evening, good food, and great service. Just don't get the lemonade - unless you like the artificial sweeteners."}
{"text":"Holy fried seafood, Batman.  Between the Singapore Calamari, Bang Bang Shrimp, and Fish and Chips, I think I've had my fill of fried food for a while.    We started with the Singapore Calamari and Bang Bang Shrimp for appetizers.  The calamari is generic, with too much breading for my tastes.  It does come with some fried peppers, which was a nice treat.  The Bang Bang Shrimp is their most popular appetizer, and consisted of crunchy breaded shrimp in a very mild sauce.  Both the calamari and shrimp were supposed to have a spicy sauce, but on a scale of 1-10 they were both probably a 0.5.  A positive is that the portion sizes are very generous; if you're not sharing, it could be an entree for one.  I opted for Sir Will's Fish and Chips because the description said it was tempura style, and because the fish was tilapia instead of the usual cod.  The fish itself was really good, nice and juicy and again, generous portions.  Sadly, the batter was less tempura style and more Long John Silver's style; a giant block of fried batter that encased a filet of fish.  Crunchy and thick, it didn't do anything for the fish.  I don't think Bonefish Grill would ever be my first choice if I'm at Town Square, but I also wouldn't dismiss it if someone else wanted to try it.  Based on the tilapia in the fish and chips, I'd want to try their grilled fish entrees."}
{"text":"Went for brunch today; this was the first time we had ever been to this restaurant. The waitress was very friendly however the food left us feeling ill and very disappointed. The eggs Benedict was the worst I ever had; we apprehensively sent it back because our eggs were fully cooked (not poached) and both were cold and it came back even colder and was honestly disgusting. Very disappointed and would highly suggest passing on both their bang bang shrimp Benedict and traditional."}
{"text":"This is a great place to come for Sunday brunch! They have a nice variety on their brunch menu. You can get classics like eggs Benedict, and also lunch items such as fish and chips. I did try the fish and chips and it was great. The fish came crispy and was served with traditional malt vinegar. They offer endless mimosas and Bellini's for $10. That is an excellent price for endless drinks! I also tried the bang bang shrimp as an appetizer. The shrimp was cooked perfectly, it was not chewy at all. The sauce was creamy and delicious. The Keylime pie for dessert was an excellent ending to this meal. It was perfectly tangy with a nice, thick graham crust."}
{"text":"I had the shrimp & scallops.  I choose green beans & whipped potatoes .  You get 6 large shrimp & 4 scollops.  The potatoes were a small dip of maybe five bites. The beans were raw and not trimmed on the ends or even cut. I had to finish preparing the beans before I could eat them. You may have all the fresh baked bread you want. This was a 19.99 meal & the seafood was good but I left hungry .  Good service , nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"I had dinner here tonight with some friends and this place never disappoints. We all ate until we were stuffed and the drinks were so tasty, on average we all had two cocktails each.   I highly recommend this place for anyone that loves a great atmosphere, good food and cocktails."}
{"text":"The food was very fresh & flavorful. Had the crab & shrimp stuffed tilapia for the entrée, bang-bang shrimp & a cup of chowder. The only thing I wish I could change was the amount of spicy sauce on the shrimp. It was way too much & smothered them. Next time, we'll get the sauce on the side because the shrimp are fried w/ a seasoning already. Our server was very knowledgeable about the menu & offered great suggestions. My husband & I are major garlic lovers & the chef was willing to accommodate our request of adding garlic on our fish. Magnificent!  ; )"}
{"text":"Called to place an order. When I arrived it turns out the guy who took the order never put it in. Needless to say I was very upset. And no one apologized or offered me some bread or anything."}
{"text":"Cobia special was excellent....save room for dessert!  Good drink selection.  Parking lot by the restaurant which is nice given that it is in Crocker Park."}
{"text":"The tilapia imperial was one of the best seafood dishes I've ever had. Girlfriend tried the lobster grilled cheese with lobster bisque soup which was also excellent. The service was pretty average but certainly nothing to complain about."}
{"text":"Still so many kinks to work out... But the mere fact that bonefish is now open is a plus. Service is good but not quite polished yet. There were a few hiccups during our meal but overall it was a pleasurable experience.  It was Halloween night and they were offering their three course special. We had the bangin shrimp, which was really tasty and a good portion size for the price. Husband got the rainbow trout, I was getting the tuna steak. After about 15 mins, I was informed they had sold out of the tuna steak. The kitchen may want to communicate to their servers when they sell out of something In a timely manner. I opted for the tuna bowl...  Husband was not too pleased his trout came with the skin on and didn't find the fish to be flavorful. I was very disappointed with my tuna bowl. Almost inedible. The \"seared\" tuna that was supposedly rolled in sesame seeds was not warm at all and literally tasted a bit frozen in the middle. Not pleasurable at all. I looked around and noticed the lady next to me happily eating her tuna bowl, so it might just have been my meal... I'm sad nonetheless.   We will probably come back again as bonefish is a solid place to go, but we will go back after they work out their kinks."}
{"text":"I have always loved the bonefish grill. The bang bang shrimp is great.  We got the bang bang shrimp tacos for the first time and was very disappointed.  It was like there was no sauce on them.  Once I got the sauce I could tell it was missing from the dish.  I informed the server and they said \"sorry\" grabbed the dish and was off.  I will not be back to this location. Since it is the closest one around we will probably not be eating there anytime soon.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"We had a reservation this evening that we made earlier today.  When we arrived our reservation was not in the system and due to how busy it was we could not be put on the list.   When the manager came over he fixed the situation immediately.  He sat us at a table right away and explained the situation of a system issue earlier that day.  I felt very importaint and appreciated as a customer.  I wish all restaurants were that prompt to fix potentially difficult situations.  We had a great server as well.  I will defiantly recommend this location to others.  The food was great too."}
{"text":"We had family in and decided to go to dinner. We had a group of 7. Megan was our server and did an amazing job accommodating everyone including my elderly mother in law. The staff was very welcoming as well.  We ordered 2 orders of the Bang Bang shrimp to have with our drinks. Delicious!  Two in the party do not like fish. They were happy with the sirloin steak. The rest loved their fish!"}
{"text":"Lindsey,  the bartender, makes the best Margarita on this planet! Tuna Poke was excellent! Glad my return visit was better than my last review!"}
{"text":"Sadly, the food is beautiful in presentation, but not in taste . Ordered the \"special\" and got tough steak. Ordered medium and got medium rare, so that was probably my hint to send it all back. Shrimp was not cooked all the way through, so I cut open the next one to show the waitress. I asked if it could be put back on the grill, but they brought me 3 more. It makes me sad that the food was not up to par when it is a rare occasion that Bri goes out with me. I kept on chewing my steak but spit it out on the plate and just let it collect. They did offer a dessert for free, but afternoon was already ruined. Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"I came here with my girlfriends for Happy Hour on a Tuesday. They were offering an awesome Lobster Tuesday special when we went. We were served fresh baked crusty bread with a seasoned olive oil for dipping, very tasty. I ordered the Sangria press with blackberries for my cocktail which was overly sweetened. Bang bang shrimp tacos were offered on the HH menu and they were crispy, sweet and delicious! The Ceviche with chips on the HH menu was just ok, not enough citrus for my taste, at least the chips were freshly fried. For the Lobster Tuesdays special I ordered the lobster tail which was perfectly cooked. The restaurant is very clean and  classy, I'll definitely come back especially for the Bang Bang shrimp!"}
{"text":"Have been here many times.  Good seafood and steak, nice atmosphere, and excellent customer service.  Management bends over backwards to address any complaints.  Everyone I have invited here was impressed.   Can get extremely busy but it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"The restaurant has a nice atmosphere, caring and attentive staff, and prompt service.  The food was excellent.  I've never been somewhere that the crab cakes didn't stay together too well due to having so much crab.  Everything was delicious and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My wife and I went for a date night and the food was great. We started with the bread and oil, as well as the bang bang shrimp. I had the Fontina Porkchop and it was amazing. My wife had the Chicken Marsala  and she loved it. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of visiting Bonefish Grill again! I am a big fan! Last night we went to celebrate my daughter's birthday and they were packed even on a Wednesday night. As usual, we received exceptional service. I had the fish and chips, it was very tasty. The portions are big enough to provide a decent lunch for the next day. The calamari was a standout! We will be  back soon!"}
{"text":"Totally forgettable.  This place is like an upscale Red Lobster.  We had the ceviche to start which was ok, not that flavorful, mostly tasted like onion and pineapple.  We both had the Alaskan cod which was flavorful.  I had the sauteed spinach which had no taste and also the Jasmine rice which had no flavor.  The service was good, very attentive, but it was like they were pretending to be an upscale restaurant.   We only came here because we had a gift card."}
{"text":"I have been here for lunch, dinner & brunch. It wasn't busy every time, but yet the service was very slow.  Their food is okay. The only food worth mentioning is the bang bang shrimp, which I love.  They also have an outstanding brunch special. It's $19 for bottomless bubbles & a brunch meal -- that's the best brunch deal I've seen!"}
{"text":"I was mildly disappointed by the food but impressed by the service. Our waiter was always checking on us and was very attentive.  My mom, nephew, and I order the ahi sashimi, lobster roll, and the corn chowder to share. I was not expecting the ahi sashimi to be almost completely encrusted in sesame seeds.   Let's start with the Ahi Sashimi. The size and flavor of the fish were great, big portion and fresh fish. Unfortunately for me, the amount of sesame seeds on the fish was a bit overkill. There was also a drizzle of this wasabi sauce on them that kind of killed it for me as well as I am not the biggest fan of wasabi.   The lobster roll would have been great (for me) if there hadn't been a wasabi base. There was a heaping amount of lobster in the roll, the bread was toasted perfectly, but I just couldn't get over the hint of wasabi with each bite.   The corn chowder was okay for me. The predominant flavor was just cream and did not have much taste to me.  The ambiance and plating were all beautiful. The food; however, was more expensive than what it was worth."}
{"text":"Favorite restaurant ever. I always get the corn crab chowder and bang bang shrimp. Hawaiian martini and brownie for dessert is a must also!"}
{"text":"I've come a few times and every time the food was great.   I get the scallops and shrimp with the Pan Asian Sauce and they have already been cooked perfectly.   My kids I've brought each time (Mommy date nights) have also shipped their salmon and pop corn shrimp. There's not a lot of choices for little kids though.  The cheesecake is a nice, thick and creamy slice, rich enough to share."}
{"text":"I was surprised on how my sea bass tasted to so delicious and not dry. Their calamari is to die for. The price is not to expensive and their location is great.  Staff are very informative and attentive."}
{"text":"Absolute WORST service of any restaurant I've ever been to. Prepare to wait too long for EVERYTHING from water to the check. Visited this restaurant many times and it's only getting worse. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Our first visit to Bonefish and probably our last which is sad as we looked forward to our visit.  It is a comforting environment, a bit more upscale then we expected for a \"grill\".  Wait staff was friendly and attentive.  We ordered the bang-bang shrimp benedict, a denver omelette, original eggs benedict and a salmon salad.  Oh, we also ordered calamari for an appetizer, more on that later.    For $11 the omelette was small, however the asparagus side was a nice touch.  This breakfast would leave anyone that was hungry, still hungry.  The potatoes that came with the eggs benedict were tasty although without the \"browned top\" you get when home made.  Both of the orders of eggs benedict came with undercooked eggs.  The bang-bang shrimp them selves were ok, however I hoped for an unusual flavor, but they were just spicy.  Since they appeared on the menu three times I expected a \"wow\" factor.  The salmon salad was a bit pricey but generous and pretty good.  Lastly, the calamari.  This of course was the first thing we tried, or tried to try.  They were overcooked and under flavored and hidden in a mass of lettuce and crispy noodles.  In retrospect we should have sent them back, they were that bad.  This is a seafood grill and they cannot get calamari cooked right? Come-on!"}
{"text":"Excellent place,  may seem expensive for the proportions but the flavors and prep done well.    Must try the shrimp apps and the coconut pie with rum sauce.   Never a bad stop!"}
{"text":"I hate chain restaurants. This place, exceeded my expectations. The only thing I disliked about the place was that they serve brunch, but they don't serve alcohol until noon. Honestly, I don't think anywhere in the state of North Carolina should say they serve brunch.  The pesto and bread were AMAZING. Also, the surf and turf benedict was some of the best breakfast I have ever had. It would've been better with a Bloody Mary."}
{"text":"Something can be said about consistency, especially in Charlotte restaurants. So many places have one note melodies and fluctuate greatly in experience. Bonefish Grill in Matthews is spot-on every time I visit.  I have become a slight regular at Bonefish, seeing as how I work in the area. The ingredients have always been fresh and top-quality. Freshness only goes so far, though; it requires refined technique to bring out the flavors. Kitchen manager Sandra and her team do an excellent job preparing each dish to perfection. Table service is also stellar, with an attentive and knowledgable wait staff that is eager to help.   While not the cheapest eats in town, you do get what you pay for: incredible food and great service. The only thing better would be more room (so I don't have to wait for a table)."}
{"text":"Tonight my mom and I went to Bone Fish Grill on Pineville Matthews Rd like we always do and it was phenomenal. From the service to the food I was extremely pleased with our experience tonight. We had to wait about 40 min to be seated. We arrived a little after 7 p.m. However there were some available seats at a high top in the bar area where we ordered drinks and an appetizer while we waited. Once we were seated our server pretty much came right over and she was the best server we've had since we started coming to Bone Fish. She was so kind and not pushy at all. She constantly checked on us. I believe her name was Sheana. She said she typically works there on the weekends. I ordered the sirloin and crab cake entree with mashed potatoes and green beans. Everything I ordered was piping hot, minus my sirloin which was lukewarm, yet still delicious and perfectly seasoned. I would definitely recommend this Bone Fish Grill. My mom and I come on a consistant basis and we are NEVER disappointed."}
{"text":"Service is out of this world. Just as good as any five star restaurant. Wedge salad was exquisite with nice sized chunks of Danish Bleu cheese. Now I have had many things at this restaurant, but I will say that their steaks are amazing. Only drawback is the fresh veggie. It's a bit inconsistent on how tasty it is. I will certainly be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"We go to Bonefish often, it's one of our go to's. Not anymore. We made a 630 reservation for Valentines Day, big mistake, and were seated at 8! They had so overbooked and were taking walk ins! The lobby/ bar was so packed that the fire inspector would have had a field day. There are too many good restaurants in town that respect reservations to go thru this again. Bye bye Bonefish."}
{"text":"Got our orders wrong three times. Took forever to get our food and by the time my eggs Benedict came the eggs were basically poached. Oh and there was a bug in my juice. Never going back"}
{"text":"What brought us here was a $20 off coupon in the mail. Went for dinner 9 PM on a Friday night. Seated right away and service speed was good and waiter was friendly. Decor is nice.   Ordered mojito and pinneapple martini which were great. The thai coconut shrimp appetizer was amazing! For dinner the orange roughy special and pecan parmesan crusted rainbow trout. Both lacked flavor and were meh. Parmesan trout was very buttery and lacked any flavor at all.   Overall expensive and not worth it. If I go back it will be for the drinks and apps only."}
{"text":"I went into Bonefish for lunch. They will not provide you with a lunch menu; however, if you ask if they have lunch specials they will bring out a lunch menu. I ordered the 2 taco and salad lunch combo. The bang bang shrimp tacos were delicious! The amount of spice and sauce on the shrimp was a perfect amount for the tacos. The tacos came with a side salad which was also very delicious. I would highly recommend trying the bang bang shrimp tacos!"}
{"text":"Expected great quality of fish/seafood. Shrimp and scallops were rubbery and over-seasoned. Fish & Chips good. Bottled water on table nice touch. Service excellent - the kitchen let her down."}
{"text":"Our experience started out a little rocky....well actually, a lot rocky.. but, after going to the manager, Wendell, he made everything right and after that our expectations were exceeded! He checked on us several times and seemed to genuinely care that we were taken care of. Our waiter, Juan was so nice, funny and very attentive! Sometimes things go wrong, but when employees go above and beyond to make up for it, it is well appreciated and can truly change a person's experience! I wont even mention the issues we had because I feel that Wendell and Juan made up for it and I feel that my overall experience was wonderful!!"}
{"text":"Food and ambiance is great. Came here yesterday for our anniversary and we had a great time. Only reason I'm giving 4 out of 5 stars is because of our server. We had to ask drink refills a couple of times. He wasnt very attentive despite a non busy time."}
{"text":"The real downside to the restaurant was the atmosphere, we joked that it was like eating in the middle of the freeway, we were seated close to the restroom, there were service people running up and down the aisles and one of them dropped a pitcher of water that splashed everywhere then they cleaned it with bar towels (I guess they did not have a mop). The food was okay, I loved the Bang Bang Shrimp but the crab cakes were almost too salty to eat. The bread was good but the seasoning mixture for the dipping oil was not to my liking. I will not return. The folks at the next table ordered a tilapia and were served trout and it seemed like the server was trying to convince them that they were mistaken. We were aware of all of this because the server was an inch from our table while the conversation was going on. It was loud, cramped and the food was not worth trying again."}
{"text":"Everything was okay, just nothing to make me go to the 5 star rating.    I started with the Crab Chowder, the lump crab really made this a good soup.  Unfortunately the soup would only have been average on its own.  Next was the Lobster Roll which was a let down mainly because it was pretty small for the price.  The bread was super good, but the lobster part didn't have a lot of flavor.    The best part of the whole meal was the slaw.  They should sell this on its own!"}
{"text":"Love their bang bang shrimp. The service was pretty good for the most part. Only thing I would mention is that I think it's a nice gesture for the GM (or manager on duty) to say hi or smile when walking by your table... The one last night (10/30/15) didn't. No biggie tho. They had this awesome swordfish and pumpkin ravioli that was so good! Also the drinks are well priced (most around $8-9). Love their bread and pesto! All in all a good dinner!"}
{"text":"I have to give Bonefish a 3 star because of the weak martinis I got while I was there (the main reason I went in was for martinis). The bang bang shrimp was so good that my friends were all over it before it even got onto the table (they had been there before and knew it was good). I had to fight them off to get my first taste. Boy, was it good! I did share the shrimp though (begrudgingly)!  I had both the Ocean Trust Tropic Heat Martini and the fresh pineapple martinis. I didn't feel the liquor effects of either drink, which is weird for martinis. As for taste, they were both pretty tasty. I shared the blackened fish tacos and fries. The fries were fried until crispy and the tacos were pretty darn good. Lots of fresh ingredients packed into soft shells. There was a good balance of fish and veggies. They are not spicy though. I would like a little more heat in them. Or, if they could serve them with a salsa on the side to add some heat. Not a bad chain restaurant overall."}
{"text":"Came here on a busy Friday night, and thoroughly enjoyed the experience and food. You can tell this place is run by people who care, specifically Marcus! We had a show to make, and once I expressed my worry with both the wait and receiving our food he assured me we'd be taken care of. Not only were we taken care of in a timely manner, but the food was genuine and the service was welcoming. I went with the Fish Tacos (delicious!), and coming back to try the rest of the menu since they proved their seafood reputability with a classic.  Thanks Marcus!"}
{"text":"I must start by saying...this place is pretty awesome!   I know I ramble...so I thought I'd put my bottom line up top! :)  Anyways, so I had seen Bonefish Grill a few times while driving by Town Square and I'd made a mental note to come back, about 500 times...   Finally...I remembered!  Boy am I glad I did.   I really didn't know what to expect...the restaurant is a new build and seems quite large from the exterior.      While walking up, I noticed a cute little seating area out front, I imagine it would be a nice place to wait when the weather warms.  The front door is a revolving door, SO EXCITED!  What can I say?  I like it. It reminds me very much of New York and gives the restaurant a very cosmopolitan feel.    After going in, I was pleasantly surprised.  The restaurant was just that...a real restaurant.  (I didn't know what to expect...corner bakery style, chipotle style, a super loud Cheesecake Factory style...or what?!  It was none of these!).  We were greeted by a dark wood bar area with ample seating and also high tables for quick sit down dining.  Adjacent to the bar was comfortably lit and serene dining room.  Windows all around, but with shades so you don't feel like you need sunglasses while indoors. (Don't you hate restaurants like that?!)  The hostess was very nice and friendly. We were seated right away in a long booth. Very comfy.  Our waitress greeted us shortly afterwards and since it was our first time (she asked) she went through specials and favorites. I loved her introduction. Sometimes, I find the waiter/waitress (at other places) insincere or uninformed...but out waitress seemed genuine, knowledgable, and interested in us having a good meal.  Ordering was difficult only because I can only eat 1 meal at a time.  :)  Our food came in no time. And I mention this because the dining room was about 75% full with one table that was a large party of about 15.  I ordered a salad with grilled chicken. Salad, onions, corn, black beans, feta...all fresh and delicious. The grilled chicken breast was cut super thin, which I appreciated since it was on a salad. Without me asking, the dressing was on the side. And oh my, their house vinaigrette...LOVE!  I think it's a white cider vinaigrette...but I could be wrong. SO GOOD!!!    My lunch date ordered tilapia tacos...I didn't try them, but she said they were YUMMY!  I decided I had to come back for the sea bass.  I CAN'T WAIT!  See you soon Bonefish Grill!"}
{"text":"I love coming to bonefish but this location is horrible. We came in on a Friday night and our server was horrendous.   He forgot to bring bread until he was asked and he did not clear our table once. The guy continued to walk back and forth (from what I counted over twenty times) waiting for a table that was empty to be seated instead of focusing on his tables he had. I had to physically hand him my glass to be refilled on his fifteenth walk around and every time I asked for something he said sure... try anticipating the guest needs first. I absolutely hate bad service. Never coming back here!"}
{"text":"First time visit with my parents. Loved the atmosphere and the layout. Noise level was good as was the ambiance. Wednesdays a local radio station runs a 98 cent wine promotion for happy hour, which is a great deal.   Unfortunately, the service and the food didn't measure up to expectations. We had to wait a long time to be served and 2 of the 3 dinners missed the mark. Might be worth another visit, but this one was a bit disappointing."}
{"text":"I've been going to a Bonefish Grill for going on 8 years now and have NEVER been disappointed.  I fell in love with mussels at the BFG in Grand Rapids Michigan, could NOT stop eating those things.  How about two thumbs up for Bang Bang Wednesdays, damn shrimp are addicting, especially for $5.  What I really like about BFG is their quality and selection.  One of the only places that consistently, year long, serve Sea Bass, one of my favorite dishes.  I also get the filet w/ gorgonzola quite often.  Just the other day I went and got the Seafood Platter for 2 and was very happy with my meal.  The Garlic mashers were a little too garlicky but I dealt with it all day and going into the next...lol.   I do like their Caesar salads too.  Pretty much a must try in my book.  BFG has a great selection of wines and bottled beer.  Their draft selection could use some expanding but I can put down a couple Coors Lights as much as I can a Bud Lights, so not a deal breaker.  BFG is the big sister to Outback and the prices are really not that much higher for the kind of dining experience you get.  Great place for dates, anniversaries, work functions, etc.  So get your butt over there and wait for a table no matter how tempting Outback seems."}
{"text":"Waitstaff was well informed & helpful. Had martinis that were delicious. Went for the Bang Bang Shrimp & were not disappointed. Entrees were served quickly & were good. Actually had room for dessert & shared a slice of warm Jen's Jamaican Coconut Pie, mmmmmm!"}
{"text":"Excellent food choices.  The best place for fish off the Strip.  Service can be slow.  Only open for dinner (unfortunately).  Creative alcoholic beverages.  Interesting and tasty apps.   Ample parking in their private lot."}
{"text":"The Bang bang shrimp is their \"must have\" item. I remember it tasting pretty good when I first had it in Florida years ago. So I finally visited the one in Madison and I didn't feel the same. Could be at first I had zero expectation because I didn't know what it was. And the second time, not only was it at a different location but also I had experienced it and expectation. I considered just okay mainly cause of the excess sauce and the use of a bed of lettuce to make the dish look looked there were more shrimp than there actually were. We also got calamari. A little over cooked, breading wasn't to bad, a little thicker than I prefer and they also mixed in peppers with it. But the same thing here where they included a good amount of batter fried  peppers, comprising the amount of calamari in he dish.  This time I ordered a non-seafood dish, because let's be real, we're in WI. I got an 18oz bone-in ribeye steak, medium. And the rest of my group actually got a 6oz sirloin dish and a 6oz filet mignon. I gotta say the Ribeye was pretty good. Can't say the same about the filet mignon. It just had a different flavor and texture from other filet mignonette I've ever had.  She actually didn't finish the filet mignon and helped herself with a cut of my ribeye. Actually I had a total if two others help me with that. That ribeye was SER.I.OUS :) [if I can rank on the ribeye alone, I would have given a 4 star].  I did have there Mule. It was tasty, served with ginger candy. So why not? It was a pretty good drink."}
{"text":"I was a little skeptical when we first went here as I knew it was a chain restaurant. Usually I prefer locally owned restaurants over the ones you see right next to the mall. This was a pleasant surprise.   We were meeting friends and arrived early so we grabbed a drink at the bar. It was a Saturday and a little before 6:00pm .They still have happy hour specials going in which was nice. Usually these are restricted to Monday-Friday at most places. I ordered a $5.00 Raspberry Vodka Collins. The drink was refreshing and fresh. They clearly used fresh raspberry's in the drink, nice touch.   Once we met everyone and were seated we ordered the bang bang shrimp for an appetizer. This was very good, it was creamy and spicy. If you are not a fan of mayo you may not like it but I am. It is deep friend shrimp that are tossed in a sweet and spicy sauce.   For dinner I had the spicy tuna bowl. This came with seared ahi tuna, jasmine rice, mango salsa, shredded carrots and avocado. I really enjoyed this as it was very fresh tasting and not to heavy.   Overall this place is decent for a date night or a nice dinner out. It is a little pricey so isn't a place I would go regularly but I would come back for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Service was slow but the waiters were nice. There were a lot of waiters for nothing. We had a table of 19 with two waiters to us. Constantly had to ask for refills. Food was ok.   I got the grilled scallops and shrimp. The scallops and shrimp were small. Got like a dollop of the garlic mash and it was salty. They put a bunch of carrot and green onion garnishment that was just a waste and in my way of the food since it was on top. I had a piece of someone's hamburger meat mixed in my sauce. I got the Pan Asian sauce cause the waiter said it went well with the scallop and shrimp. It was your typical \"sweet and sour\" flavor. It just tasted salty to me. The side of veggies were corn, beans and I don't even remember. It didn't pair with the dish well.   My husband got the salmon or halibut. I don't remember. He said he liked his dish. Also got the bang bang shrimp as appetizer and that was good. They had a happy hour or sale on that app. I also had the corn chowder soup which was delicious. Lead me to believe my entreé was going to be good.   We were celebrating two birthday celebrants and they don't do candles or singing here. The ambience was low lighting and small space. It made the birthday boring! Food was boring, place was boring, service was boring!   We ordered dessert for the birthday celebrants. We got the flatbread sangria thing and that was just disgusting. $12 for that flatbread. That just needs to be taken off the menu. We also ordered creme brûlée and brownies with ice cream for the kids.  I think those were good according to the kids. Guess you can't mess those up.   My cousin in-law and myself left hungry. Overly priced for sucky food. They should consider serving a starch, some bread or something with their expensive small ok entreé.   You'll probably get more bang for your buck and tastier meals at King's Fish."}
{"text":"Food was okay,  not great. My martini was tasty.  Service was okay. The tables were too close together"}
{"text":"We came here for my husband's birthday  and were treated like royalty. Billy, our waiter, was incredible. He was attentive and personable. He made excellent suggestions and took very good care of us. When we had an issue with one of the dishes, which was served with something I was allergic to that wasn't listed on the ingredients list, he quickly took care of it. Our table was immediately visited by the manager. He was apologetic and very kind. The rest of the meal went without a hitch and everything was positively divine. The sea scallops were so amazing that I can't even post how good they were without this getting X-rated. Hubby's parmesan rainbow trout was delectable, and the portion was generous. They brought him a signed card with a coupon for a free appetizer. He almost teared up, because even his own mom didn't send him a birthday card. He said from now on they are his family, LOL. Overall, it was a wonderful experience and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The coconut shrimp were great but the fish in the fish and chips was greasy for me and made me a little queezy.  The lobster roll was overpowered with too much celery to lobster ratio. But the toasted bread it is on was tasty. More lobster and less celery would do the trick I think."}
{"text":"Love the concept as a whole, but the last two times I've been to this location, things have been subpar. Sat at the bar both times, as sitting there usually means faster service. Today I came in and was greeted within a minute by bartender. Ordered a water and a drink. The bar had 5 total guests and there were about 10 tables in dining room. I received drink approximately 9 minutes after initial order, but didn't get water until I had asked a second time. Very disappointing in a brand that I probably won't be going back to any time soon. At least not this location."}
{"text":"Hmmmm,  I really liked Bonefish and when I was there entertaining clients at their Orlando Florida restaurant, I was wishing that they had one of these restaurants in Las Vegas.  My dream came true and I am tried this place yesterday with the family.  Overall, I have to give this a weak three star.  Here is the deal, it is both good and bad, I will go back again, just that it was not what I expected.  1.  Let's go with the good stuff first:  a. Ambiance - Very nicely decorated franchise restaurant,  good size bar with Sports on. Very friendly staff and greeters. Very efficient.  b. Availability - I like the fact that I made a reservation 1.5 hours before dinner and was able to get a nice table by the window.  c.  Service - Pretty darn good, very attentive and very willing to please.  d.  Menu - Very large menu, something for everyone.  From seafood appetizers, hamburgers, salads, fish, chops and steaks, dessert, very cool.  Plenty of draft beers and a \"just right\" selection of wine.  2.  Now, let's go with the odd stuff next.  a.  Ambiance - As the sun was setting, why would they lower the lights in the restaurant and open up the window shade that was at our table?  It brought in the oddest, most unpleasant light from the dusk that was not light, but an eerie glow and feeling. It was also odd to have a motorized shade going up while you were eating right next to it.  I don't want dusty bits flying around while I am eating....  b.  Food - We had salmon, seared Ahi Tuna, Chilean Sea Bass, Atlantic Swordfish Oscar, steamed broccoli, steamed asparagus and steamed medley of vegetables.  To me, the sea bass was absolutely wonderfully just okay. It was small, and I ordered the asparagus which cost 2.00 more.  Now I know that asparagus compared to broccoli and string beans is more expensive, but for 5 sprigs of asparagus, I would think 2.00 extra is a bit much.  Also, the sea bass was okay, but what got me was the size.  I am thinking the size was either small, or the plate was way too big.  Perhaps the 5 sprigs asparagus took up too little room?  The grilled salmon was good, I stole a taste from the kids, but I am not sure if they were happy to see a glaze on the salmon. I think it was a miso glaze, but you know, it should be on the menu.  The Ahi Tuna was pretty darn good, just that it looks like a lot because it is presented over rice so it looks like a good portion.   c.  Overall, I find the food was uninspiring and not excitable for me. I would try perhaps the steak or hamburger next time.  Also, some non seafood appetizers would be good for the kiddies.  I will try the place again, just that I need some motivation for this place.  GK says, not bad, if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Food is generally good but the service can be inconsistent. The bar is always good and pretty efficient given how busy they are."}
{"text":"Enjoyed our dinner last night. Service was spot on as usual. I had the fish fry and the wife had the pork chop. Everything was prepared perfectly. Thank you"}
{"text":"Love Bonefish.  Have eaten at all in the Charlotte area.  This Bonefish is very nicely designed on inside. But past that they stuggle. The food is not up to par with the others.  I've been here 3 times since they opened, to give fair review. The waitstaff are nice, but the service is slow.  On top if that every time I have visited they are always out of something.  Fish, champagne for mimosas, shrimp, and basic items on the menu.  Disappointed since this is closest to me, but I would rather drive to get the consistency I expect."}
{"text":"Very Impressed! Nice relaxed ambiance.  Great date spot( I have already told honey that this is where I want to come for Valentines), nice low mood lighting and nice music playing(not too fast, not too slow, just enough to make you tap your foot).  Go on Wednesdays, Bang Bang shrimp-which is one of their signature dishes- $5!  We also had the crabcake appetizer.  Extremely yummy!  The crab cakes(2) were good size, very meaty with very little bread, and a nice remoulaude that really set the dish off.  The Bang Bang shrimp were very lightly breaded and sweet and spicy.  The portions are great for the appetizers and the meal.  Doing it over again we would only order one appetizer because we were almost too full for our main dish after having 2( and we are not bird eaters lol). Everything about our entree was perfect, fresh, and seasoned perfectly.  And then I had the chocolate creme brulee....LAWD!!!!  So good.  I considered driving back tonight and going to get another.  If you like chocolate this is sin on a spoon. My eyes were rolling in the back of my head.  To summarize...LOVED IT.  Not too pricey in my opinon, you'd pay the same as eating at redlobster- but get food that is alot less fresh."}
{"text":"I went to Bonefish in another city years ago and was so turned off by how crowded it was and how close the tables were that I have never been back. A friend met me here last night and I'm glad I went. Of course it was not the weekend so it wasn't crowded, but as the tables were not as close as the 1st BF I went to, perhaps on a busy night it wouldn't be too bad, either.  99% of the time, I am a leisurely diner.That is, it's social for me and I don't like to rush. At first I think that threw our server, but once he realized we were going to hang out, he was not intrusive and seemed to be able to gauge just the right amount of service (thanks!). We had tuna sashimi to start. It did have a sauce on it that was not identified in the menu description, but it was just drizzled partially over the fish so it didn't overpower the ability to taste the fish. That being said, the fish was not that flavorful.  We then shared mussels.I really enjoyed this dish. The mussels were cooked just right, and the \"white wine\" broth was very rich. Although the garlic was obvious, what did it for me was the distinct flavor of what I thought was fennel. The server confirmed Anisette. I try to stay away from chain restaurants, but if I find myself going to BF again, it will be for these mussels.  We finished with coconut pie. I didn't want to like it, but it was warm and dense, and the rum cut the sweetness, and I exceeded my intent to have \"just one bite\" by about 5.  Good dinner out."}
{"text":"First - It was nice to be able to call ahead for a table for two on a Friday night! Then our server, Asia, was so nice, like 25% tip nice! Lastly, and most importantly, the food exceeded expectations! The bang bang shrimp of course were delicious... the rib eye steak, shrimp/scallops, potatoes au gratin, bacon mac n cheese, asparagus and crab fried rice were all amazing and the last three sides were so worth the up charge! Great date night!"}
{"text":"Tuesday night romance: - ALL bottled wine half price - Mussels Josephine - Bang Bang Shrimp  Yum, yum..."}
{"text":"A packed place tonight with an above normal noise level. We had a new waitress who was struggling with the new tablet ordering system. We worked through this minor issue, received all of our specified drinks and food. The Mussels Josephine was superb and the Bang Bang Shrimp was a hit. My wife tried the Corn and Lump Crab soup. She wouldn't share so I can only assume it was great. Our guests were duly impressed with the mussels and shrimp along with their entree choices. To top off the meal we shared (okay, I ate more than my fair share) a wonderful Creme Brulee."}
{"text":"The server, the hostess, and everyone was amazing. The brunch endless mimosas were amazing but the manager on duty name SHELLY was extremely unprofessional and rude and I have never been spoken to the way she spoke to us in a restaurant. Shelly should never manage a restaurant because she has ZERO customer service skills."}
{"text":"Food 5 stars! I had the bang bang shrimp for an appetizer and the grilled shrimp and scallops got my main course. The scallops were cooked perfectly. Just melted in my mouth! You can choose what sauce you would like to have. I chose garlic lemon, which was not over powering with garlic so that was great!   Service 5 stars! Every time I go I am never disappointed! It's the little things that count! Like for example, I never have to ask for a refill on my drink. They bring it right away!  Ambiance 5 stars! Very clean, inviting, elegant surroundings. It's perfect for lunch or even a classy dinner!"}
{"text":"The star rating just continues to keep dropping at what is unquestionably the worst excuse for a seafood restaurant in the Phoenix area. Bonefish in Mesa closed, surely because people recognized how horrible the food is. The folks in north Phoenix obviously haven't gotten the message yet. The service was virtually nonexistent, but the food was inexcusable. Everything we had looked and tasted like it was prepared days ago. The seasonal salmon special was particularly offensive. The fish was grilled to death, dry and flavorless. Apparently the executive chef felt that adding sautéed spinach topped with a cold slab of blue cheese would somehow up the game. It was without question, the worst preparation I have ever eaten. The ceviche was also old and flavorless, and the fish had been sitting in the lime juice way too long...it was mealy at best. Perhaps the local owners should change the name to something more appropriate, like \"Oldfish\""}
{"text":"so remember the movie rat race. when all the people are racing for a bag of money in a train station in new mexico... thats how i feel about this place.  we had a really strange experience here... we were told that our waiter would be right over by 4 different people who all looked like they'd just been slapped in the face, dazed and confused...  i'm 90% sure our server was drunk or high or something with his slurred surfer boy speech about the tacos being \"super-rad\"  we ordered a couple sangrias which were more like blueberry koolaid with sprite. whatever.  our appetizers finally came, dumplings were room temp, calamari was so over cooked it was like eating slightly-rubbery rigor mortis of cotton balls. the tacos, however, were \"super-rad\".  so theres that.  finally our entre came. it was pretty good aside from the awkward lump of tomatoes and chick peas that were just kinda hanging out,flavorless and sad in the corner of the plate.  the whole vibe was really weird, and then the 30 minute wait for the check began. \"can we get our check?\" i'll find your server. -- no one ever comes back. 4 times we did this dance until I finally flagged our server down with what might as well have been smoke signals and a high school marching band style.  anyway it was a very strange situation...."}
{"text":"We came here for a date night dinner and honestly just had a horrible experience at Bonefish Grill. Not only was our server rude but unwilling to set forth any effort. We asked her if we could possibly have the trout prepared almandine style since we saw they had almonds in other parts of the menu but her response was that she had never heard of trout almandine and did not know what it was. So instead of asking the chef if it was possible to accommodate our request she just said no we could not order that. I had the lobster which arrived completely cold and when I asked our server for a side of lemon butter her answer was that my order did not come with lemon butter. She must have read my mind by look on my face because she conceded and brought it out. My zucchini and squash were completely overcooked and the broccoli I chose as my side was mostly yellow instead of green and was part mush and part rock hard raw broccoli. I ordered the Arnold Palmer iced tea and quite frankly the Snapple Arnold Palmer I get from a bottle tastes better than this. The restaurant manager looked lost just walking around the restaurant and did not stop at any of the tables to speak to anyone. When he saw that I was trying to get his attention he looked away and kept right on walking. You can tell he was not interested in speaking with anyone and trying to avoid any confrontation. If our experience is an indicator of others experiences maybe he's just tired of listening to complaints and not interested in changing any of the problems. What a waste of money, time and a date night. Will definitely not be back."}
{"text":"I was not disappointed. The food was very good, we had the Shrimp and Scallops with the lime, tomato, garlic sauce and it was delicious. For dessert I had the doughnuts with caramel and chocolate sauce and it was delicious. We ate at the bar and Austin, Adam and Matt were great hosts. They made our visit delightful. We will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"Gave it 3 stars because I have been here before and like coming here however do not get the Seabass. I was very disappointed in it.  I am a huge fan of Seabass and decided to try it here and it was a mistake don't waste your money!!! For being a fish grill I excepted it to be decent. :( now I'm still hungry"}
{"text":"This place is excellent for happy hour! $4 wines, $5 cocktails & $6 apps. And obviously the bang! Bang! Shrimp is to die for. They put the crunchy flavorful shrimp on a bed of lettuce for that freshness. Everyone at the bar ordered it.  On a personal note, we were there celebrating my besties last day of chemo.  We let the bartender know.. awhile later the manager came out and made a big deal about it, gave her a candle with chocolate, and said her candle lights forever.  it was very sweet. Nice touch Bonefish!"}
{"text":"I've been here before for dinner & it was amazing! The food was delicious & the service was great. So today my fiancé & I decided to try their Sunday Brunch. The service was still great, but our food was not. I ordered the Surf & Turf Benedict and my fiancé got the Western Omelette. Our food came out in a timely manner, but it wasn't quite as we expected. My poached eggs were over cooked, the lobster meat on one was tough, & there was only a couple small chunks of steak. The omelette was very small & there was only a couple tiny chunks of chorizo inside. We both got the potatoes gratin for the side and those were pretty good. Our server was great. She offered to have the kitchen remake my Benedict after I cut into the eggs & noticed they were over cooked, but I was too hungry to wait for a new one. We will definitely go back for dinner, but never for brunch again."}
{"text":"2-stars for boring food with mediocre service."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Their menu is delicious, their drinks are original and the service is excellent. They have  $5 martini Mondays, $5 Bang Bang shrimp and chicken and definitely check out the Sunday Brunch. $20 all u can drink mimosas or sangria and includes an entree. Yes they're a seafood restaurant but offer other options and have a gluten free menu. They're owned under Outback Steakhouse so the food is guaranteed delicious"}
{"text":"We really should have read the reviews BEFORE we went here!  Friday afternoon (2ish) and the place was empty, so why the hostess takes us on a meandering tour of the dining room, with all sorts of tables by the window, and tries to seat us right beside the kitchen door is beyond me :-/ But then again, this same hostess seated two tables right beside us (where we were now at one of the window seats) and each time hollered across the empty dining room to tell, in one case \"Collette\", our waitress, and in the other to \"Justin\", who looked to be maybe a sous chef. It was actually kind of funny. She'd tell their name and then point at the people at the table.   Anyway, the Bang Bang shrimp app was decent. My wife says the Caesar salad was good. Her chicken wrap had flavor but was tiny, as though they had made a big one and then cut it in quarters instead of half. I hope whoever got the other half of the wrap enjoyed it. I had the lunch combo with the chowder and blackened fish taco. The chowder had good flavor. The fish tacos were laughable. They looked like the street taco apps they serve at Z Tejas, except not nearly as filled with goodness. This was supposed to be an entrée size. I hope the picture does it justice. It was a long way down to find the filling and, when I scraped back the bits of corn and some wilted green (maybe spinach, maybe cilantro), I found the thinnest slice of fish you could imagine. And this couldn't have been an accident because both tacos were identically sad.   Adequate food but a terrible value and service that was almost silly; it was as if we weren't there at times. The waitress hooted to the sous chef looking guy \"three dollar, makes me holler\" when she came to clean the table next to us and collected her tip (where it seemed the couple left before their meal came, but I cAnt be sure). I the heard our waitress say to the table behind us (remember, we're in an otherwise empty restaurant but we're seated next to each other) \"I'm sorry, I'm usually much better than this\".  I'm not sure I buy that."}
{"text":"Great service! Dakota is our server and he is doing an awesome job! We just ordered bang bang shrimp and it's amazing. I am definitely coming back here! You can tell a lot of care and detail went in to opening this restaurant and I am SO happy something like this came to this area! Woo!"}
{"text":"The wild salmon tasted great, but I was a bit underwhelmed by the bonefish salad. It was too plain for my taste.  It needed more dressing.  Also, I felt the side portions that accompanied my fish were too small. I had to order an additional side of rice. Luckily, the rice was delivered quickly, so I didn't miss a beat. My husband had the fish and chips which he enjoyed.  The best part of the meal was the dessert. The key lime pie was delicious! Also, my husband ordered soda, but there was something wrong with the soda machine that night. The first soda was too clear, the next one was dark, but flat. He sent them both back. The service was great as well as the ambiance. Will return and order different items."}
{"text":"Let me just go ahead and say this is my favorite chain restaurant.  First experience wasn't so great, but I will go ahead and let it slide, got ignored at the door, but after I made it evident in my facial expressions that I was not pleased with what happened, everyone ensured to, what's the nice way of saying kissing my @$$? Well...you got the point."}
{"text":"Love Bonefish! Appitizers are awesome the drinks are great too! Go see them for their HAPPY HOUR !"}
{"text":"Fantastic salmon tonight and great service. Our anniversary dinner was really really good. The bad is very fresh and so many choices on the menu it was hard to decide what to have. I was very pleased with this location, the lights are low, it is kinda that romantic feel, prefect for a celebration. We had a great night, and then they surprised us with a small glad of champagne. Very cool."}
{"text":"Had dinner with family during a visit to Cleveland. Food was good and service excellent. Fast and courteous. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The corn chowder with crab meat is super delicious, and do not leave here without ordering the Jamaican Coconut Pie - creamy coconut custard, Myers's Rum sauce and fresh whipped cream. The coconut pie is worth every penny! Tastes like a coconut macaroon with a sweet, rum reduction. A delicious and unique dessert offering!!!!"}
{"text":"Visited Bonefish Grill for happy hour.  We got just appetizers of Bang Bang Shrimp and Ahi Tuna.  Both were excellent!   However, the person who made our entire evening was our waiter, Nate.  He was very personable, efficient and probably the best waiter we've had in a long time.  His smile and personality made the entire experience fun!  He should be commended on his enthusiasm and eagerness to please the customer.  So, thanks to him, it was a wonderful evening."}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever experienced! I called in an order for pickup. The lady was short of memory on the phone. Then said it would take 25 mins and I would recieve a call. Never recieved a call. So I walked in at 8:10 pm. There was a lady standing at a small free standing table a little away from the bar. She was dressed like a chef like the rest. I attempted to ask her about pick up and she rushed off without acknowledgement. I looked around and there was a desk deep in the corner with no one at it. (Behind the corner). I waited for the lady to come back and 15 mins went by with no one coming back to either wait area. Then several staffed walked back and forth without offering assistance. My mother called their phone number asking for corporate and/or regional managements number. (Of course the lady wouldn't give it). She then came from the back and asked whats wrong? I proceeded to explain. She cut me off and said she would get a manager and check on the food. The manager came out with an attitude. And he said, \"so what's wrong?\". I explained to him the same story. Then he said he would get our food. He came back about 2-3 mins later with it and said, \"here\". My mom was still willing to pay. However he did say he took care of it. However while saying that he rolled his eyes and rushed off. His staff scattered back to what they were doing walking back and forth ignoring patrons with their attitudes. I will NEVER eat here. Also the wait had our food cold and soggy. Disgusting. Threw it away!!! Don't waste your time. Just go somwhere else!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Bonefish Grill on Saturday 6/16/2018.  We were celebrating Father's Day and my oldest Daughter's Birthday with the entire family.  It was quite busy, but the staff handled it wonderfully.  We were treated well from start to finish.  The food was great and the service was on point (even when I spilled my entire water glass on the table).  All of us were totally pleased with the experience."}
{"text":"I told myself I wouldn't come back to this location but had plans to meet up with a friend after work. I suggested happy hour and our plans were to meet in the Concord Mills area so this was the best choice. I'm glad I gave them another chance! During this visit, the hostess staff was extremely pleasant. We sat ourselves in the bar area and were greeted by Richard. Richard provided top notch service from beginning to end. I have a habit of asking what the waiter or waitress would suggest and he made a great suggestion to try the tropical tiki martini. It was DELISH! Our food and drinks came out promptly and Richard made sure to periodically check on us and clear away any unused dishes. I ordered the cod sliders and a small order of calamari. They were both seasoned well and cooked just right. My friend ordered the cod sliders and potatoes au gratin tots. The tots reminded me of a fried baked potato when dipped in the sour cream dip. I would try them again! I almost forgot to mention the bread! I'm not sure what changes were made in the kitchen, but the bread was perfect! We left more than pleased and I'm so glad this location was able to redeem themselves!! The perfect spot for an afterwork drink and bar bite!!"}
{"text":"I love the pomegranate martinis here! So refreshing and I like the frozen grapes they put in it! I'm allergic to shrimp so I can't have the famous bang bang shrimp anymore but I've had it in the past and it is delicious. Steak or fish you will not be disappointed in your meal!"}
{"text":"We came on Memorial Day so it was dead in the restaurant surprisingly. Guess everyone was home bbqing. We saw all the posts of the Bang Band shrimp and that Corn soup. Gotta give those a 5/5. Texture and blend on both dishes were delicious!  Now, on to the entree. I ordered the crab cake and sirloin streak. My sides were French fries and garlic mash. (I got the fries cuz that is the only thing my 3 year old will eat there) When my plate arrived my first thought was \"that's it?\" The portions seemed so small! I was waiting to eat something the size of a horse, I was was so hungry! Let me just say, for the steak, it was actually cooked just right. I usually ask for A1 sauce for a little kick but it didn't need it. The crab cake tasted very.... What's the word? Well, crabby. Very very crabby like I was tasting the ocean with it too. Not my favorite but still good. Garlic mash was delightful. You can never go wrong when ordering that. Now.... As for my French fries. I don't know. I never got it. They gave me string beans instead. Which actually, I'm not mad. Maybe the universe was telling me I had too much carbs on my plate. Lol And no I didn't flag down the waitress to have her exchange it for French fries. (I'm not the type to complain unless it was like my incident at the Country Cafe review). At the end of the meal, I was surprisingly satisfied. Not over stuffed, not hungry. I pass by this restaurant all the time, give it a try sometime!"}
{"text":"Love Bang Bang shrimp!!! It's a bomb n the portion is good for 2. Wish they have bigger draft tho. Ordered a steak too which was delicious. Well worthy it cheating day!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are having a hard time figuring out why this restaurant is so busy (at least on Friday and Saturday night).  It must be because of the paucity of decent restaurants in the South Hills.  On our last, and what will probably be our last, visit, we ordered two apps, two entrees and a beer.  The Bang Bang Shrimp and the beer were, according to my husband excellent.  That's where the good ended.  My Wagyu Beef & Ginger Potstickers were a gummy mess.  The filling was good, the toppings were good, but the wrappers - yuck!  They tasted like they had been in the steamer all day.  When I pointed this out the manager, he said they were pan fried.  Yeah, right.  Maybe pan fried and then reheated in the microwave.  On to the entrees.  I ordered the Spicy Tuna Bowl.  The tuna was ice cold, right out of the fridge cold.  There is an asterisk after the name of this dish on the menu which says:  *These items are cooked to order.  Now wouldn't you think this would mean the food would be hot?  The manager argued with me about that one, too.  In my opinion, if it's not going to be hot, it should be warm or room temp, not ice cold.  The rice was hot, the avocado looked good but the star of the dish was awful.  My husband's Ahi Tuna Steak with lemon butter sauce was a disaster.  He ordered it cooked medium; it looked raw inside but was still cold at the center.  He said he'd never tasted anything worse than the sauce.  His broccoli was mush.  We each had one bite of our food and then waited for the server to reappear, which took a while.  The manager comped us on everything but the shrimp app and the beer, but really at that point why bother to charge us for anything?  We had a coupon for the shrimp, and he still charged us for the beer!  A comment on the service:  our server was nice and friendly and competent, but they need to up their game when training.  We had the dishes from two apps and bread and plates sitting on our table.  The runner who brought the entrees set our dinners down on the corner of the table and left without taking anything with her.  The server and manager did offer other food, but at that point I just wanted out.  It will be a long, long time before we even contemplate going there again."}
{"text":"Good meal, great service. We drive a bit further to come to this bonefish location because apparently it's managed better than the one on Pineville-Matthews Road. The servers are kind, knowledgeable, helpful and well trained. At the other location, they act as though they are doing you a favor by waiting on you. The only disappointment was the strawberry shortcake. The biscuits were served cold, hard and stale. Didn't eat them---and for a nearly $8 dessert---it should have been great. The server did not ask how it was. Don't waste your money on it unless you find out first if the biscuits are freshly made or stale."}
{"text":"Gluten Free/Allergy Sentive Okay, I've been there twice and didn't review it last time. It is delish and the prices are moderate to high. The have any exclusive GF menu and several options to choose from as well as appetizers and dessert! I have had bother the chicken and the fish several times and had no adverse reations. The bar is well-versed and \"after work\" type crowd was there on Friday night. It looked like most were waiting for tables. This is a fairly decent sized store-front restaurant, in the strip mall next to Guitar Center and across from Hops and Chick-fil-a.  **Note**I recently went gluten-free for my health and they have a gluten-free menu that was an added bonus."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night (two days after Valentine's Day and also the first Friday of Lent) for dinner before heading to a movie.  My husband and I arrived around 7:20pm for our 7:30pm reservation.  The restaurant was packed and I was worried they not be able to honor our reservation.  However, we were seated pretty quickly.    The bread bowl they bring out to the table with pesto/ olive oil was delicious! My husband had to wait a little bit for his drink because the bartender was backed up which was understandable since it was so busy.  Our server was laid back and friendly and checked on us appropriately.  She mentioned that she believed it was so busy since a lot of people where looking for fish / seafood dinners since it was Lent season.  I mentioned that I also that it was busy because a lot of couples were able to celebrate Valentine's Day until the weekend like me and my husband.  We had the Coconut Shrimp as an appetizer and it was absolutely delicious.  The shrimp were huge!  I could have definitely gone for a 2nd order of that.    The main dishes did take a long time to come out.  My husband ordered the Spicy Tuna bowl and commented that the sauce was really good.  I had the Crab crusted Cod with a side of sauteed spinach and Sweet Potato Mash.  The best part was by far and away the Sweet Potato Mash.  My husband thought there was too much butter in it, but I thought it  was a perfect balance of savory and sweet and came in a generous portion size. The spinach seemed a little dry to me and was in desperate need of some salt.  The cod was just ok.  It's a fish so it was rather bland tasting even with the crab crust and lemon butter sauce.  I wouldn't order it again.  Overall it was a good experience.  The decor is very relaxing with dim lighting and neutral colors.  There were a few televisions spread out through the restaurant.  There is a lot of parking. We would definitely go back."}
{"text":"When people ask me why I come to bone fish grill, it's only for the bang bang shrimp . The entrees do not have that wow factor or flavor for me , good seafood dishes is hard to find in Charlotte"}
{"text":"Too bad the service was so terrible, we didn't have time to complain, waiting on our drinks took about 15-20 minutes, as well just for our waitress to come by each time  and they were not even busy . The food was decent, but I could honestly not even tell . Waitress didn't know much about the food and, the girls were standing around talking about face book when we walked out of the restaurant. At the time of leaving we were waiting on our change from the check, which we waited for 15 minutes before leaving and left the change behind because it wasn't worth it . Forgot my drinks , the hollandaise was broken, when I asked for more hollandaise the waitress told me it was lemon butter but brought me back out real hollandaise. Don't do it even if you got a gift card you would probably be better off at outback ."}
{"text":"I went with my parents to this place for Valentine's Day and the food was nasty and over cooked.  The waitress was really nice but after we got our appetizers our main dish took an hour and a half. Then they decided to give us a complimentary dessert of doughnuts and they weren't even cooked all the way through. It was pure dough on the inside. I will never go there again or ever recommend that place to a friend of mine."}
{"text":"If your forced to come here and you're not a fish/seafood person, then I highly recommend the chicken teriyaki bowl. I was blown away by the flavor. The service was fine and the establishment was high class."}
{"text":"Now I finally understand why there is such a wait for Bonefish!  I have never visited ANY Bonefish before -- not for lack of trying -- and after three tries at this location, my hubby and I finally lucked out early one Saturday evening.  They only allow 20% of their seating in reservations, but we were able to snag a seat in the bar, which is first come, first served.  This is a small place, and it gets filled up VERY quickly.  We sat at one of the long tables in the center of the bar.  While there were others at the table, we still had an enjoyable experience.  Service is very good at Bonefish, and our server, Melissa, was attentive without ever being annoying.  We started with $5 drinks (available only at the bar), and the ceviche special.  Served with hunks of shrimp, scallops, fish, avocados and tortilla chips, this was a great way to start the meal.  I also tried their crab and corn chowder, which was spicy and one of the best I've ever had.    My hubby and I both tried their tacos - he had the fish, and I had the bang bang shrimp.  Both were absolutely delicious.  The tortillas were thicker than your normal flour tortillas and tasted homemade..is that true?  They were grilled and overfilled with shrimp and fish.  Yum!  We had a great experience and will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best restaurants I have ever been to. The service was excellent the drinks were amazing but the food once impressive beautiful delicious and all around amazing! Atmosphere was cozy and open."}
{"text":"Fresh grilled choices of fish. Fresh salsas and toppings with mangoes-peppers, onions, and there own east african Piri sauces.....heaven. Healthy, tasty and hard to believe you're in a fast food joint. Bonefish is to the twenty-first century sophisticated, health-conscience eater what McDs was in the 1950s....but oh so much better !"}
{"text":"Came here when first open up and keep coming back.  The service is getting better and better think they just had growing pains.  Our server was great this last time I think his name was Alex...sorry if I am wrong.  He did a terrific job and new menu better than previous serves will ask for him again, hopefully I have correct name!  The salmon is my favorite, but I will try sea Bass in future!"}
{"text":"Bonefish is great!  Very modern and sleek decor.  Definitely more upscale than most chains.  Love their bread and dipping sauce!  It is similar to Carrabbas, but better.  Less spice to oil ratio translates to more balanced flavor.  Their bang bang shrimp is delicious.  It's not as spicy as it sounds.  It's somewhat of a sweet heat with a slow kick.  The shrimp is quality shrimp!  They are almost meaty.  I cut mine in half so I can actually chew them with my mouth closed LOL.  My husband and I went to Bonefish a few weeks ago on a Sunday and were pleasantly surprised to find out the serve brunch.  Can't go wrong with some peach Bellinis and mimosas!  The service is good to great every time we go.  Honestly, the only drawback to the place is the jacked up parking lot.  I'm all for Simon Malls adding new dinning options to the area, however, building them in a parking lot and removing parking spots to bring more dinners in was moronic.  They should have thought that out a little more. It can be a dog fight for a parking spot at peak times.  They do have valet option, but I have never used it."}
{"text":"High end restaurant gone wrong. Came to bonefish tonight with my fiancé. One thing you can always count on from here is the drinks. I had an old fashioned and my fiancé had the raspberry martini which both were excellent, so shout out to the bartenders. Started with the usually fantastic bang bang shrimp, but was disappointed. The breading was falling off the shrimp before you even touch it, and the portion size has been dramatically reduced. My fiancé got the teriyaki bowl with mango salsa. The mango salsa was a nice twist and  gave nice flavor but as my fiancé put it \"nothing that she couldn't have gotten at the mall\". I got the special \"creole reddish\". The fish itself was good but the creole sauce and crawfish tails was disgusting. These are the types of places that give creole a bad name and puts people off to any creole meals because they don't have one ounce of knowledge on how to cook it., shout out to the cooks. We would come back for drinks but that would be it. Not worth the money for an upscale Applebee's."}
{"text":"Our waitress RHONDA was so sweet! I have been to the townsquare location and this location was so much better, probably due to the fact that our waitress was just so nice! We ordered the brunch special with bottomless mimosas and she came to check on us the perfect amount of times. My group will definitely be back to request her again"}
{"text":"Good, maybe very good, but not great.  Went there last friday night for dinner at near 7pm. Surprised to get a table with no wait.  They have a nice drink selection... Craft beers, wines. Lots of choices of appetizers... We skipped those and opted for the house salad and crab topped trout for an entree. Excellent salad, warm, fresh very good bread, and the entree was amazing, as were the garlic mashed potatoes. Key lime pie was also incredible.    I would have given them a 4th star were it not for the lack of organization between the many employees involvedmin serving me, it took forever to get water, then refills, and my second glass of wine seemed to take forever.  We had to ask for bread when about 20 mi passed and we didnt receive.  It also seemed like it was noones job to clear empty plates and glasses.      If you have a nice restaurant, nice atmosphere, good food, you need to fix these issues if you expect a table of two people to drop over 100 in your restaurant. Else at some point i will give up on your place and goto macaroni grill, cheesecake factory, etc, and have entrees just as good, while saving $$.. (And getting awesome cheesecake) :)"}
{"text":"The Chilean Seabas and bang bang shrimp was our order and they were absolutely amazing . The shrimp just perfect . The staff would come check on us every few minutes . Price is on an higher range but it's worth the food , ambience and service . Best place in town !"}
{"text":"Best fish in town.  Amazing quality of the catch of the day.  If you don't like fish they got steak or chicken.  Nice side salads. Friendly staff and superb service.  I'm like that you can have ad ons to your fish.   I probably going to have it again this Sunday since it lent season."}
{"text":"So what makes a restaurant stellar versus okay?  Is it the food?  The ambiance?  The combination of food and ambiance or some other factor that's hard to define?  I have been to Bonefish Grill in different iterations in different cities and I have to honestly say that it's not rocket science as to the appeal of this restaurant.    During my most recent visit in McCandless, our hostess was extremely pleasant, we didn't have a wait during our seating and our waiter was extremely jovial.  The décor was pleasant and the menu was pretty straight forward.  I have spent more money on so-called \"stellar\" restaurants and been dissatisfied with my experience. (Experience in this case being the culmination of food, service, décor, etc.,)  I have to honestly say that I was pleased with my \"experience\" at Bonefish Grill.  I ordered the Corn Chowder + Lump Crab as my appetizer and my sister ordered the popular Bang Bang Shrimp.  For our main courses, I ordered the grilled Scallops and Shrimp, my daughter Muff ordered the Crème Brûlée French Toast with bacon and my sister ordered the Atlantic Salmon.  Both my sister and I ordered the steamed broccoli and Potatoes Au Gratin as our sides.  We thoroughly enjoyed our warm bread and seasoned olive oil precursor before our meal.  All of our food was properly cooked and served at the proper temperature, the service was extremely friendly and welcoming and we enjoyed our experience.  Is it cutting edge food and service?  No!  Did the staff deliver what Bonefish Grill promised?  Absolutely!  I had a good meal at a restaurant that promised a pleasant experience and that's what I got.  I have been to \"quote, unquote \"cutting edge\" restaurants that seemed to expect me to grovel because I was  \"allowed\" to enter their golden edifices that claimed a dedication to providing the best food experience possible only to feel like Schlepprock!     Bonefish Grill is a good, solid seafood restaurant that delivers on providing flavorful food in an atmosphere where you can count on great service.  Who can ask for more at the price point that they offer?"}
{"text":"Decent experience... The waiter was great. The ambiance was great, and the rock shrimp was appetizer super good.  However, everything else was eh. I ordered cod fish with crab, and the lumps were dried small pieces. The fish was heavily buttered (yet, still not very flavorful) and overcooked. My sides were au gratin potatoes, which were average, and creamed spinach which was good. My husband ordered steak and crabcake - \"They were okay,\" he said.   I'd come here again if other people wanted to come here and try other entrees; otherwise, I probably wouldn't come back on my own."}
{"text":"Excellent service and spectacular food. We tried a bit of everything!! The bang bang shrimp and crab cakes were amazing! Salmon and lobster delishhhhhhh and the special for the night was Oscar with mushroom raviolis and asparagus were so good!!! Will try lunch menu next time!!"}
{"text":"The last time I ate at a Bonefish Grill was in September 2013. I was in New Jersey for two weeks of training for work. I loved the food so much that I ate there once more before heading home.  Eating at this chain was long overdue. In Charlotte, I told my friend that I'd like to go to a Bonefish Grill. She was good.  I booked a reservation online for 7:15 pm. The process was easy and straightforward.  We got there a few minutes after said time. We were promptly greeted by a polite woman who seated us in a booth.  I got the following items:  - Diet Coke with free refills - Complimentary bread with delicious garlicky oil dip - Crab cakes - Blackened fish tacos with greens - Chocolate lava cake with strawberries and whipped cream on the side  My friend and I shared everything, except for my Diet Coke and blackened fish tacos with the side greens. The funny thing is that I don't recall what she ate for dinner.  The crab cakes were amazing. There are lumps of crab meat delicately seasoned and made to perfection. The remoulade was so good that we asked for more.  The blackened fish tacos hit the spot. Grill the fish and place the portions in soft tacos, without dunking them in batter and making me figure out where the fish is. The dressing with the green salad was yummy, too.  The chocolate lava cake was incredible! So good. It was one of the best lava cakes that I have had in years. The strawberries were fresh and naturally sweet. My friend ate all the whipped cream. She was good to remember that I don't eat it.  Our server was personable and helpful. He promptly got me drink refills, which was nice.  Meals can get pricey. However, I have yet to have a bad meal here. I don't mind paying a bit more for decent food. Until we meet again, Bonefish Grill!  (121)"}
{"text":"We always eat here when \"in town\" for Cleveland Clinic appointments, since we stay at a hotel off of the Independence Exit. We have eaten here half a dozen times in the past year and always enjoy our meal. Staff is friendly and accommodating. Food is delicious. We have never had to wait to be seated, even when dining at peak times. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"My family went to eat here on the fourth of July. The waitstaff was understaffed but our waitress did a good job considering the circumstances. My father and I ordered the beer battered fish and we were both very satisfied. They gave my parents a complementary champagne for their anniversary that was that day. Very good food"}
{"text":"Stuff members stole my Apple EarPods.  As soon as I walked out of restaurant less then 2 minuets I realize that I left them inside. I came back right away. I saw table cleaned already. You can not miss them on the table. However no one saw nothing.  I turned on find my iPhone where you can find all Apple devices and I clearly see them in the restaurant. Manager told me they probably dumped in the garbage. But I don't believe. There were in someone pocket.  Just beware. Very frustrating experience"}
{"text":"Ordered the  larger piece of Chilean Sea bass but was surprised at  how small...liked the Ceasar salad, the mashed potatoes were  powdered much to  my horror...for this price should all be fresh!! Lovely decor but not sure if will be back...."}
{"text":"Great food, the Chilean sea bass was excellent with the side sauce they recommended and the sides were great...if you can get me to enjoy chickpeas then you've done well.  Service was terrible...both of our drinks were empty when our fish came and the guy never offered to refill them, not during the meal or even at the end of the meal...  Also, I showed the girl at the front a gift card at \"Roy's\" upon entering the restaurant which is in the same family of restaurants and asked if they accepted it...she said, \"yup, expires 4/30, we take this\".   When the bill came they wouldn't accept it and the manager didn't care what I had been told before we sat down.  That reason on top of the horrible service moves them from a 4/5 star review to 2 stars."}
{"text":"Just speaking from my experience, this seems to be another chain restaurant like any other Applebee's or Chili's. I'm solely basing this on non fish items.  When we first arrived, we were greeted and informed that a table or booth would be about a 20-25 minute wait, which is not bad at all, or we could sit down immediately at the bar area or at some communal tables. We decided to sit at one of the communal tables and we're quickly given a menu and ordered some water. The menu had a majority of grilled fish or shrimp as entrees. We opted to skip this and order other items as I always like to see what else chefs are putting out, in my experience, if you're specializing in one protein but have other items as well, the other items tend to lack.   To start we ordered a Lobster Bisque. When it came out, it looked very promising. The color of the bisque was very vibrant, there was a reasonable chunk of lobster meat centered on top. The flavor was delcisous but was a bit thick in my opinion to be a bisque. The consistency was that of a gravy, it could've and should've been a  it looser. Entrees ordered were the Baja Shrimp Tacos, Basil Fettuccine and Truffle Mac and Cheese. Drinks ordered were a BlackBerry Smash and Raspberry Iced Tea. Our drinks arrived in about 15 min, a bit long, but seeing as covers were high for the night I did not mind. I did notice that there servers were wearing chefs coats, or are they actually the chefs serving you?? I was a bit confused. I did see 2 people who seemed like chefs come out and give people their plates but, came out of the kitchen with their aprons on. From my schooling, I remember that this is a big no no! Anywho, back to the food! All the food arrived at the same time, under 20 minutes which was good. The reason it was not a bad wait is, one of the servers was walking around handing out free samples of their Bang Bang Shrimp. Nice touch. These are battered, fried shrimp covered in a sauce. It almost reminded me of orange chicken from a Chinese restaurant.   The tacos ordered were good. The bang bang shrimp were used for this. It included some cabbage slaw and a mango salsa with a fried \"tortilla\". Not really a tortilla of course, more like a thin fried dough. Next! The fettuccine looked great so I was anxious to dig in. I was disappointed when I put my fork in the pasta, I got a huge lump of pasta. All of it seemed to be stuck together as if sitting in my plate for some time after served. I literally had to use a spoon as well to tear apart the big chunks. Oh, and did I mention I got a BASIL fettuccine, where's the basil??? I had more artichoke hearts and grape tomatoes, just call it what it is! The mac and cheese, if I could call it that. Presentation was nice, served in an oval shaped ramican, the mac was topped with crunchy panko crumbs. Mac was in a white cheese sauce with mushrooms and truffle oil. First off, the sauce they tried to pass off as a cheese sauce seemed to be a thickened bechamel sauce. Where's the cheese??! I dug deeper into the dish and noticed that the bottom of the ramican was lined with mushrooms. Seemed like I was served half mushroom and half mac. The blackberry smash I ordered was nothing special either. Blackberrys muddled with lemon then served with water and a bit of sugar. That's exactly what it tasted like! Did I mention that the plates being used were extremely hot! So hot, that on two different occasions servers had to put plates down on our table on their way to their destinations because their hands couldn't handle the heat, even though some had cloths to hold the plates. One guest to my right did not seem too happy when he had to send back his steak because of it being the wrong temperature. His friends were waiting to start because of this mistake. Their party of 3 arrived before us, and we left first.   Is it bad to say that I left this place still hungry? I'm not attempting to discredit anyone, I'm must hoping that this place can improve as I had been looking forward to tasting the food here for some time."}
{"text":"Great shrimp appetizer -- enough to be the full meal actually.  Good service but stretched a bit on experience.  Convienient location.  Ample parking.  First visit was in Boca Raton Florida.  Similar venue on all things actually.  Sit at the full tables -- the others tables are just too small.  We were the young couple it seems yesterday at 69!  But 3 folk were there, comfortably, dining alone.  This is a good sign of a local place.  Beers.  Fine.  Chardonnay.  Fine.  The servings of appetizers are large enough to be a full meal."}
{"text":"I will never return here. Service was extremely slow as in 1 hour for a crab cake our waiter was nice but forgot several times my check it took about 20 mins from me handing him my card. Food awful my crab cake was mushy no crunch just a mushy pile of crab. I won't return here ever again I much prefer brio or yard house then this place. Not a good experience esp for a local that frequents town square. Also my waiter smelled like a box of cigarettes when he finally came to take our order at the table. No thank you"}
{"text":"Bonefish Grill is part of the same company that owns Carrabbas, Outback, Roy's, and Flemings. I am a huge fan of this place. They have a great menu with daily specials. When you walk in, you'll notice a nice dimly lit restaurant and the wait staff well dressed and uniform.   We went the week of Christmas and I got the Lobster Thermidor Dorado. I finished my plate as I usually do when I dine here.  I suggest the Bang Bang Shrimp or the Singapore Calamari for appetizers.  For main entrees, you basically select the fish/seafood you would like and then you select the sauce it's cooked in. My favorite is probably the Sea Scallops with Mango Salsa. The four choices are: Mango Salsa, Chimichurri Sauce, Lemon Butter, and Pan Asian.   This is a great place with reasonable prices (under $20 for most entrees). If you like Carrabbas, Outback, Roy's or Flemings and you enjoy fresh seafood - this is a must try.   5 Stars for service. 5 Stars for the Quality vs Price of the food. This is much better than most chain restaurants but it's not fine dining."}
{"text":"I really like this place! I used to think it was stuffy and not welcoming but I have found that not to be the case. Great atmosphere, especially for happy hour after a long day. Sit at the bar and relax. You MUST have their Bang Bang shrimp. It is one of the best things I've eaten. Service could be a tad quicker but I'm always entertained so it doesn't  bother me. You will enjoy\""}
{"text":"Dined Sunday evening. Service and food was horrible. Orange roughy was undercooked. Main entrees were served before the dirty dishes from our appetizers and salads were removed which cluttered the entire table. We were handed the check without having a chance to order dessert. Will not be going back. Bonefish, it's time to join the 21st century. It's called WI-FI.  AVOID AT ALL COSTS!"}
{"text":"There was plastic in our fish. The fish came in plastic and they left some of it on while cooking. The manager confirmed it was plastic. They didn't take the meal off the bill. No, We won't come back."}
{"text":"I haven't been here for a while, but it was a birthday celebration, so I came here on a weeknight. It wasn't busy, but the service was pretty drab.  The server wasn't really friendly or interested in making our experience good.  We had to ask for bread after sitting there forever!   The stars are for the food, which was very tasty.  The bang bang shrimp appetizer, the blackened tacos, the pumpkin ravioli, & all of the fish was amazing.  I left feeling very full, but wished the service was better."}
{"text":"Overpriced and nasty.. I went twice and was disappointed every time. Customer service was nice though. The team was awesome!"}
{"text":"We actually happened upon this restaurant by accident, after shopping at a nearby retail store. We stopped in for dinner and the ambiance and the food are absolutely amazing.  Our Server was Reina G, and she was was absolutely delightful.   The filet mignon was about as good as any I've ever had at any steak house in the valley, and I will definitely be coming back again."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Bang bang shrimp is a delicious appetizer.  Nice atmosphere, and I have always experienced attentive, prompt service."}
{"text":"Had a reservation, was seated prompty, menus were there, as were silverware. Server brought water quickly.  We ordered Calimari as an appetizer, tasted fine.  My friend ordered Lobster Grilled Cheese, which came with a a soup, and greens. I had Troutred enscrusted with pecans which was fine, along with  mashed potaotes, and a veggie.   All in all a very nice excperience."}
{"text":"The food was awesome here...it's reasonably priced and they seem to know what they are doing. I was very surprised because I ordered a filet mignon and they cooked it perfectly and my wife had 2 lobster tails and we just shared it and all under 100. Awesome"}
{"text":"The food at Bonefish Grill was pretty good. I didn't really like the wagyu dumplings I ordered for appetizer because they were watery and tasteless. I should have gone with the bang-bang shrimp. From what I hear those are really delicious... My entree redeemed the overall meal experience I was having. Though I wasn't blown away, the chilean sea bass was pretty tasty. Bonefish Grill won't be my top choice for eating out but it was a nice place to try."}
{"text":"Long wait to get our meal. Not the service we have received in the past. Almost an hour 50 minutes since we ordered. Drank 2 bottles of water. Finished our cocktails. Quite disappointed. Could have offered to refresh our cocktails on the house. Something for the inconvenience."}
{"text":"This restaurant is part of a chain.  They are consistently good across the country.  Decent prices and great cocktails makes me a fan.  HOWEVER, my one annoyance is the piped in music.  It's awful and not very appetizing.  It's like 80's soft rock, not Culture Club or Tears for Fears but no name crap with a faint disco beats, it's too loud and extremely annoying.  I was so distracted by it, I didn't order a second drink and left.  I hope someone in corporate reads this."}
{"text":"I need to start by saying that our service was incredible. Nathaniel M was professional, friendly and went above and beyond to be accommodating to my vegetarian diet. We would both go to any restaurant that he was serving at.   We were promptly greeted with warm fresh bread and water. Nathaniel took time explaining the different dishes to my boyfriend. He also was helpful and offered suggestions for things to me to eat.   I ordered the pad Thai without shrimp. Nathaniel suggested adding broccoli. The dish was flavorful and very nice looking, the noodles were just extremely al dente. I prefer my rice noodles a bit softer.   My boyfriend got the tilapia, jasmine rice and mashed potatoes and it was cooked perfectly.   I do wish they would have some variety for those of us who don't eat fish or meat, but I can understand why they don't."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to any Bonefish location and the service did not meet my expectations.  We came in with six people and a baby in a car seat.  They sat us at a six person table in the bar area and said that due to the table location we could not use a sling. If we wanted another table, we would have to wait even longer so we stuck with it. We had to awkwardly place the car seat behind our chairs and hope people walking by didn't trip over him.     Our server was also one of the bartenders, so we were highly neglected.  Drinks went long stretches of time without being refilled and it took forever before we were able to order.    Once we got our food it was really good.  The bang bang shrimp appetizer was delicious. Lots of flavor but not too spicy. I had the fish and chips for my main dish which was amazing.  Given that the food was good, I will likely give this place another chance in the future."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I got the Chilean sea bass and the ahi tuna with lime tomato garlic sauce. It was amazing how they serve really fresh seafood in Vegas. Our server was Brittany and she was awesome by the way. Great service and ambiance. I recommend this place"}
{"text":"The food here was phenomenal. I had the ahi tuna with mango salsa and my husband had the spicy tuna bowl, both of which were wonderful. The service is what earns this visit 5 stars. Our waiter, Philip I believe his name was, was on pointe the whole evening and had our meals to us in about 10 minutes. His service was excellent because he went out of his way to bring my sunglasses to me, right after my son had gotten sick (from coughing too much) in the parking lot. He brought us towels to clean up and stayed until he knew my son was OK. We will definitely be back here sometime in the very near future!"}
{"text":"this place is great.  Sevice. we were there the first time for a birthday. The manager was so nice. We got a surprise gift for the birthday. The second time we were there just for the food. The manager gave us free appetizers by mistake. LOL. Well, have no idea how the manager felt, we felt so happy. lol. in sum, i like the service there. they made us feel welcomed and sweet.  Food. I forgot what we ordered. But I do remember the free appetizer, shrimp. It was very good. The food was fast too.  Will go there again definitely."}
{"text":"Really loved lunch at Bonefish last week with a coworker. First is a tip to ask for the lunch specials menu which they don't hand out. It was better deals and good sized lunch portions. I ordered off of that menu and got bang bang shrimp tacos with a salad. Everything was awesome and not too spicy. My colleague got the soup with it and raved about how good it is. She is lactose intolerant, but takes lactose just to be able to eat it."}
{"text":"I had the wonderful privilege of hosting a couple friends & family events in the new banquet room that Bonefish just opened,  the room was a perfect size to hold more then 50 people, I brought 25 people one night and over 30 people the following night, the food was fantastic and the service & staff were all on point. My entire party had a blast and thanked me over & over.  One of the unique things about the room was that the window walls opened up so at one point they opened them and u could feel a pleasant breeze thru out the room, I ordered the crab cakes, which were absolutely delicious and also got my favorite item the bang bang shrimp, defiantly come to this location and spend a perfect evening dining and if u want to host a large party this would be the spot!!"}
{"text":"Just enjoyed a fabulous meal at Bonefish. I am so impressed with their menu, especially since they are a chain! We had the calamari and bang bang shrimp for our appetizers. The fresh bread with olive oil was outstanding. For dinner, I had shrimp and scallops, broccoli and a house salad. It was the perfect amount of food. The desserts that were ordered looked great as well-from crème brûlée to doughnuts! I would highly recommend giving Bonefish a try! They also have a gluten free menu for those who have gluten issues."}
{"text":"The employees are friendly and attentive. The service was fast. Definitely going back esp because of their Calamari."}
{"text":"My mom and aunt first visited Bonefish Grill when they were on vacation a couple of years ago, I believe, in Georgia.  When they found out there was a Las Vegas location, they were thrilled, and have been raving about it ever since.   Well, last night, we were celebrating a couple of pretty amazing health victories in my family, and my mom wanted to take us all out to dinner at Bonefish Grill.  We made a reservation,  and arrived about 15 minutes early.  We were greeted warmly, and told that our table was ready.   Within minutes, we had bread with an herb olive oil dipping sauce.   Our server, Karissa (Carissa?) was lovely.  She explained the concept of the restaurant, and that all of their fish is fresh and inspected by management every day.  She joked with us throughout the night, and checked up on us frequently to make sure we had everything we needed.    Service really makes or breaks a visit for me.  The food was wonderful, but it was the incredible service that we received from start to finish that impressed me.   Our server, the food runners, and we had an interaction with a manager that was so pleasant.  Seriously top notch service here.  Now, the food.    Well, ok, let me back up to the drinks first!! THEY HAVE A WATERMELON MARTINI.  Who doesn't love watermelon?  I was debating all day about the watermelon martini, and a nice malbec with dinner...but I ended up choosing the watermelon martini.  I can have wine any time I want.   I am SO glad I chose this drink!!  Hand-muddled watermelon, house-infused English cucumber and Fris vodka infusion, fresh sour, garnished with frozen watermelon cubes, this was the PERFECT summer drink.  Light.  Refreshing.  Satisfying.  I had two. I'm making it my mission in life to try to recreate this at home since Bonefish is a little far for me to drive to every day.    Happy hour is from 4-6:30, and offers great discounts on drinks.    Ok, now the moment you've been waiting for:  The food.   Appetizers: Bang Bang Shrimp:  lightly breaded, covered in a spicy, amazing sauce, these shrimp were cooked to perfection, and SO good.  My mouth was on fire in the best way.   Maryland crab cakes:  Delicious.  Lump crab meat in two yummy cakes with a red remoulade sauce:  Really really good.  The cakes weren't pretty, as they fell apart quite a bit, but the taste was great.   Ahi tuna sashimi:  sesame crusted ahi tuna served with wasabi, sriracha, and pickled ginger:  in a word...YUM.  The tuna was seared to a perfect rare, and was absolutely delicious.    Dinners:   I had the special:  Cod picatta with LOBSTER STUFFED SHRIMP.   This was lovely.  The cod was delicate, with an ever so light coating of breading and capers.  A light, delicious cut of fish.  The lobster stuffed shrimp...it was like a dream.  Decadent.  Delicious, and the shrimp were cooked PERFECTLY.  My favorite of the night.    My husband had an 18 oz bone in rib-eye that was seasoned beautifully. It was a little on the rare side (ordered mid-rare), but was delicious.  His only complaint was that there really was an AWFUL lot of fat on the steak, but he was satisfied.  The bite I had was great.  My mom had the grilled sea bass.  I had debated ordering this myself.  She let me taste it, and it was absolutely wonderful.  I'll be ordering this next time for sure.    Sides:  White truffle mac n cheese:  this was good!  I'm a mac n cheese snob, so I had to try this, and it did not disappoint.  I was too full to eat more than a few bites, but we took it home so I can heat it up for dinner tonight!  Sauteed spinach:  the only major disappointment of the night for me.  The spinach was bland.  There was no seasoning at all.  Not a fan.  I'll probably opt for green beans next time instead.   (I didn't try the other sides at the table, I was too full.)  All in all, this was an exceptional experience.  Impeccable service, delightful food, and wonderful, refreshing drinks made our celebration last night a little more savory.  I have every intention of returning to try out other dishes on the menu.   Thank you so much to the great staff for providing us with such excellent service last night.  We will be back."}
{"text":"I was hoping to find something tastier than a Chili's-esque seafood place. Unfortunately it was everything I feared - a boring chain with nothing special to offer.   Drinks: Do NOT fall for the $5 drink \"specials\". We tried a pineapple drink and a sangria. Pineapple drink was fizzy water + pineapple juice (no booze in sight!), and the sangria was half sprite. YES they put f-ing sprite in a red sangria. UGH  Appetizers: Coconut shrimp were just ok. The ones at TommY Bahama's are about 1000x better. Bacon wrapped scallops were covered in the most disgusting mango sauce I've ever tasted. I love mango, but this had a bizarre horseradish flavor.   Fish: The sea bass we had was just ok. Nothing special. Au Gratin potatoes were bad, green beans.. I mean ok, yeah, they didn't screw those up.   Service - one of the most annoying \"rehearsed\" car salesmen-esque waiters I've encountered in awhile."}
{"text":"Service was good. Atmosphere nice and relaxing (and no kids~this is for the adult appetite.) Coconut shrimp was a good start with warm bread. Waiter and restaurant manager were attentive. All that being said, my entree of sea bass w/ asian sauce, \"whipped\" garlic potatoes and garbanzo beans/spinach salad side was very disappointing!! Let me express strongly VERY!!  Sea bass: Not sure what the issue was in the kitchen, but the first dish they brought out was the small portion. I had ordered the large. Round one back to the kitchen. Next, my waiter came back with the same plate and said they cooked the wrong portion and that if I accepted this plate they would bring me out a side plate with another small portion on it. What?? I just want what I ordered. Besides, the one they kept trying to give me looked overcooked and had now been transported back and forth to the kitchen twice. No thanks. I'll wait for my correct order and told my partner to enjoy her meal and go ahead and eat without me (which she did enjoy..salmon.) Round three, the manager now comes to the table, apologizes but still wants to bring me back the same plate with another small plate with additional fish on it, as the kitchen cooked the wrong thing. I stated \"I don't want two plates of food. I just want what I ordered and am not sure what the issue is. By this time I would have thought they could have cooked the correct food! (10 minutes had passed) I'll wait for my correct order, thanks.\" My final plate finally arrives and it looks like the same overcooked piece of fish on my plate, along with another equally sized piece of fish next to it, all smothered in asian sauce. I said nothing and began to eat. As I suspected, the fish was overcooked and dry and tasted nothing like sea bass. And the sauce...so incredibly salty. I think they were trying to cover up the improperly cooked fish by burying it in sauce. Overall, it tasted like a piece of overcooked cod with a bottle off asian sauce poured on it. ZERO STARS.  Garlic \"Whipped\" Potatoes: Should be called Garlic potato puree'. The texture and look was runny, nothing whipped about it. Taste...like I stuck a whole garlic clove in my mouth. ZERO STARS  Garbanzo bean/spinach side: Garbanzo beans mushy and spinach drenched in oil. ZERO STARS   The manager stopped by to check in and I expressed to her my disappointment. This was my first trip to Bonefish and haven't had sea bass in a very long time. I was really looking forward to this restaurant and meal. I described to her each item on the plate and how I felt it was improperly cooked/presented, etc. She offered to take the meal off of my bill. I suppose I should have let her, but that's not in my character...and I did eat 1/4-1/2 of it. A compromise...take off the glass of wine I had while waiting on any plate of food to show up. She kindly did so and apologized again.   My final ask! Waiter, please bring me a piece of bread. I have got to get this fish and garlic taste out of my mouth.   Cleveland and vicinity has all of these restaurants that should be great by nature. Celebrity Chef owners, acclaimed brand name restaurants and a diverse community. I am coming to realize that perhaps the issue isn't with the restaurants, but rather who's cooking in the kitchen. I can tell you Michael Symon isn't cooking my trout at Lola's, nor is Aaron Sanchez preparing my taco's at Zocalo. Had they been I would have enjoyed those meals, I'm sure. I recently moved to Cleveland from Chicago and perhaps there's a reason behind that that I just can't seem to satisfy my palate in Cleveland. Chicago for sure has AMAZING FOOD on every corner. I will, however, thank Hyde Park in Cleveland. You've given me the one meal I'm still thinking about and can't wait to go back for. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Was a little disappointed the last time I went to Bonefish Grill.  Took my daughter for a little Sunday brunch before going to see a movie.  She ordered the kids scrambled eggs with bacon and toast, and I ordered the bang bang shrimp eggs Benedict with the au gratin potatoes.  Service was pretty decent and attentive.  However, when the food came out, both of our orders were incorrect.  Instead of the kids scrambled eggs, they gave her eggs benedict (which is not even on the kids menu), and gave me asparagus instead of the au gratin potatoes.  We ended up having to wait for my daughter's order, so obviously this wasn't a \"we just brought you the wrong plate\" kind of mistake, they totally didn't even do her order.  They brought my potatoes out right away, but I wasn't going to eat while my daughter was waiting for her meal. So I ended up eating cold eggs benedict, which I can tell is not very tastey.  To top it off, one of the eggs was only like half an egg, couldn't find the yolk.    I would also recommend that you tell the wait staff how toasted you like your english muffin for eggs benedict, because mine were hardly toasted - it was like eating straight out of the package.    I may be back again, but it's pretty iffy as there are much better restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"My favorite days are wednesdays just because of bang bang shrimp their their Thai coconut shrimp! It's so Devine!!!"}
{"text":"We decided to try the new Bonefish Grill that recently opened and we were very disappointed. We both ordered the fish and chips. The fish was extremely greasy and I was tasting it all afternoon.  There was very little fish hiding inside the tempura type batter. From now on, if we want good fish and chips we will be going to the Dubliner on 40th ST & Thunderbird Rd. Sorry Bonefish, you don't get our vote!"}
{"text":"Great dinner. Have been to the bonefish on Long Island in lake grove and love it. This is equal. Service is great.. a little slow would have gotten another star if perfect. If I could give a 4.5 it would have gotten it. Yummy shrimp and scallops in garlic sauce nice crunchy broccoli. Scallops melt in mouth delish as was the lobster. Will come again."}
{"text":"I really like this place! My wife and I have been here a few times. Last couple of visits, we went for just appetizers and drinks before heading out for the night. Bang Bang shrimp! Enough said. The Bang Bang shrimp is a must try. We also enjoy the coconut shrimp and the crab cakes too. They offer a nice selection of beers and full bar. The bar area is pretty good sized. One of the reasons we started coming here for appetizers was because you could get a seat in the bar area pretty quickly. The staff is friendly & knowledgeable. We enjoyed ourselves on every visit!!"}
{"text":"After waiting 20 mn without any consideration or  water they said brunch is over  I check online before coming here for the brunch ...poor  service !"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and got the lunch special which included 2 tacos (you have a choice of protein) with bang bang shrimp, and corn chowder with crab. The soup was rich and delicious with generous pieces of crab. The tortillas were a little tough but the shrimp was perfectly cooked and seasoned. I really liked the ambiance of the restaurant. I liked the service even more!"}
{"text":"After we were seated, the waiter had taken our order. We had ordered the Bang Bang Shrimp for an appetizer, a side salad, sea bass, and ahi tuna.   The gentleman sitting to the left of us received his burger, complained about it being \"medium instead of medium rare\", and had it replaced by the time we got our Bang Bang Shrimp appetizer.  The couple to the right of us (who were seated after us) had their appetizers and was finishing up their main course by the time i got my side salad. This is when i started to get impatient. I mean, its AHI TUNA! Its seared! Not even cooked all the way!!  After awhile, we had decided to pay for our tab and leave. I asked the hostess for the check and the manager came out, apologized and was nice enough to covered our bang bang shrimp and side salad.  I was a waitress before so i do understand things get backed up and was going to try Bonefish another day....  BUT when i went to the table to leave a tip, our waiter went to K.L and said \"its only been 18 mins since your salad came out\". WHAT?!?! We have been seated for over 40 mins and all we got was an appetizer and a side salad!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and food. The shrimp appetizer is phenomenal for sharing and all the entrees that I have ordered so far (on 3 visits) have all been great. My 2 year old daughter loves the fish n chips and that she is allowed to draw all over the table which keeps her occupied during our meal  Make sure you make a reservation because the wait can get pretty long!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Great fish, shrimp, and other entrees too. Their Mac and cheese is awesome! We had a lunch made up of lots of appetizers- coconut shrimp, mussels, bang bang chicken, ceviche, etc. all was wonderful! Highly recommend! I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Visited on a Wednesday night when the bang bang shrimp was half off. These are so good. Ordered a watermelon martini which was good...I didn't really like the pieces of black seeds in it but the flavor taste just like fresh watermelon fruit. I ordered the stuff tilapia. It was stuffed with crap meat, shrimp, scallops with capers on the top. It comes with two sides which I ordered broccoli and mashed potatoes. Ummmm...it wasn't the best piece of fish I had. I probably would not order it again. It wasn't bad but if I am going to a place that specializes in fish, it would be a little better quality."}
{"text":"Having visited the other (now closed) location in Henderson, I wasn't impressed with this place previously so I went in here with low expectations. I'm glad to say the new location converted me into their fan!   For appetizer I really enjoyed the goat cheese and beets salad. We ordered the specials of the day for entree and although I failed to get the names of the fish that we sampled (there were three types), they were all excellent - moist, flavorful, perfectly cooked.   Despite the fact that I didn't like the texture of the brownie dessert, I feel that it is a personal preference so it is not the chef's fault. Overall, I had a great experience here!"}
{"text":"My wife and I made reservations for 5pm on a Tuesday. Glad we did, even on a Tuesday. It seemed like 5pm was a perfect time because it sure picked up after that time. You get a 15% off coupon for making reservations right now.   Another great thing about 5pm is the fact that it is Happy Hour. Great prices. I had a Makers Mark and coke and my wife had the house wine. I don't know where else you can get a $3 Makers Mark drink.  Onto the food. The Thai Coconut Shrimp were amazing. Huge shrimp. Perfect size portion for two people. Highly recommend ordering this.   For our entree, I ordered the basil fettuccine with grilled salmon. My wife ordered the lobster Maui Maui (spelled that wrong) on their special menu. I received mine without the salmon and that was corrected immediately but I received a personal apology from the manager. He offered to take care of our appetizer for us and was very gracious for us coming in.   The grilled salmon was very tasty!! The pasta was delicious and light. My wife's meal was very good as well. The atmosphere was very nice. I loved the big tables and comfortable chairs. The giant booths looked comfy.   We received our bill and not only did he take off the appetizer (which I would of paid ten folds because those shrimp were delicious), he took off my meal for the mishap. I didn't use my coupon because I felt that would be overkill and we absolutely loved our first visit. Won't be the last. There was numerous items I'd like to eat. Customer service was outstanding and as for someone like myself who works in the restaurant business, that was very nice for them to do that and very appreciative."}
{"text":"Loved the interior when I walked in. Great place for fresh fish and shrimp. Prices aren't too crazy. Only downfall is the drinks. They hardly put any alcohol in it so that's why it's so cheap. Tried the bang bang shrimp and wasn't a fan too much mayo. If you order a fish entree order the burger and just take the buns away it saves you $5 and is about the same portion size.     Pros: fish and prices Cons: drinks"}
{"text":"House salad is no more then just lettuce on a plate with half cooked shrimp and 2 glasses of wine was $42. Way over priced, without solid food and service to back it"}
{"text":"The bang bang shrimp is the best. The customer service here is also amazing. I would also recommend the fish and chips. I never had an empty cup either. Bravo."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience! I emailed their website asking if I am able to order a dessert or cake in advance for my friends birthday. I got a response within 24 hours from Danny McCumber and he offered us reserved seating in the bar, a champagne toast and box of chocolates for the birthday girl. I was taken back at the excellent care just on an email. I was excited to see how it all came together. When I called to make the reservation the hostess was extremely helpful and very thorough. Upon arrival Marcus Power greeted me and made me feel as if nothing could go wrong and he had us taken care of. He is amazing! I have been in Vegas for 20 years and I can't remember the last time a manager had been so attentive. Good service just doesn't exist like that anymore! The food was perfect, our server was wonderful. our party of 8 was so impressed we plan to visit many more times. Kudos to a wonderful staff and management, you really made us all feel like it was all our birthday's!"}
{"text":"Great quality! Delicious bang bang shrimp! Quality service! Fantastic specials!  Walleye w/ blackened shrimp...get it when and if it's on special."}
{"text":"Last night, we made reservations for Bonefish.  Surprisingly, when we arrived, we were immediately seated.  We walked past at least 20 people that were standing around waiting.  Busy night!  We were promptly seated and asked if we wanted bread with our drinks.  Um, yes!  The bread was warm and delicious.  Then we ordered the scallop appetizer, which included four seared scallops wrapped in bacon.  They seemed to be cooked correctly because they were not chewy at all and they tasted delicious.  Loved them!  I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass, wife ordered the special which was a white fish served in lobster sauce, garlic mash, and chickpea salad.  My fish was specatular!  I was longing for more because it was a small cut.  It was cooked to perfection and was definitely the highlight of my dish.  The side of cooked chickpeas was very tasty.  Loved it and wanted more!  I washed it down with two glasses of yummy red sangria.  My wife said her fish tasted awesome and her serving was much larger than mine, even though we both ordered the 'regular' size.  She washed hers down with some yummy Chardonnay.    My daughter had fish n chips and she gobbled up every bit of it.  She really liked it.  My son had eaten previously, so he just had some fries, which he liked a lot.  Our server was very friendly and attentive.  Refills were on point and his demeanor was great.  This place has really good food and service."}
{"text":"Well we went out on a weekend night and decided to give this place a try. There were a few of us, kids done with college and out for a night of fun with friends. Had one round of drinks and it went down hill from there. The manager must have worked Walmart before this place. We were actually harassed for having a good time.... We were dumb founded this manager actually was stupid enough to come up to or table and state \" customers were concerned if we were driving \" this after one drink, don't laugh in the bar and if you do muffle it in a napkin or the over concerning patrons of the dump will be concerned for your welfare or was it the manager at her other part time job? We all are hard working successful people and were just beyond or selves, to say the least we left and spent or money elsewhere using Uber. None of us or those we know will go to this place ever again there are plenty of great friendly restaurants in this town that want us to have fun. Finally did this review not the entire story as they only serve half glass martini's as well, want there scores to be zero and leave or area."}
{"text":"We have been coming to Bonefish Grill since it opened! The food is great and the staff is so friendly. If you want something they will make it for you! Michael the Senior manager was awesome!! Thanks for a great meal!"}
{"text":"Went for ladies night out. food is exceptional!  love the bang bang shrimp Wednesday's for $6.  it doesn't get any better than that.  will always return."}
{"text":"I normally would not rate a chain restaurant above a 2 or three, but this is an exemption. The food was fresh nad nicely presented. I had the mussels and they were excellent. The bread with herbed olive oil was a very good.  The service was prompt and helpful. We will be back here."}
{"text":"This meal for the nine of us was just short of disaster. My Aunt's birthday. I brought a cake. NO CANDLES. They don't celebrate special occasions, except with a little box of stale cookies brought by the dumb as a post manager. The server did not know the menu. I ordered a salad. He did not even know that was on the menu. When dinner arrived, they tried selling all the dishes to us. Who had this? Who had that?  Dishes were put down at all the wrong seats. Worst service. Especially for this price. Took bread away during the meal. ??? No refills. Bussing was non-existent. They just plopped the cake down on the table and left messy dishes in front of most of us.  No forks. No plates. No offer of coffee or tea.One busgirl asked me where I got my Aunt's birthday cake, because it was so good. She had obviously tasted it. NEVER eat at this place. The food except for the sea bass was mediocre at best. This meal should have been free. What a joke. Go to Flemmings for superior service and food. I will never return. Fire the manager!"}
{"text":"Aside from the always amazing bang-bang shrimp, the spicy ahi tuna bowl was delicious. The bar was not too crowded, and the bartenders were friendly and personable, making for a great mid-week happy hour experience.  I'm not always a fan of chain restaurants, but if I have to pick one, Bonefish would be near the top of my list."}
{"text":"Brittany was such an amazing server. She was so patient with us, never let our drinks get low, answered our multiple questions, kept a smile and conversed with us. So thankful we had her.  And the food was warm, it's a limited menu but doesn't really matter because after trying 4 different plates (tasted my friends plates) they were all amazing. The Mango Salsa on the tilapia was what I had and everything was perfect."}
{"text":"We enjoy this seafood restaurant. Sure it's a chain restaurant. But when you live over 5-6 hours away from the coast that turns out to be a positive. The menu has plenty of variety and offers types of fish that are rarely available at your local restaurants. Cooking fish is not easy and on our multiple visits we've noticed some difference in the quality of the cooking. But let's not have perfection be the enemy of the quite good. And quite good is exactly how I describe Bonefish. It's far-far superior to its only in-kind competitor, Red Lobster. The restaurant's decor and server uniforms are designed similar to high end steakhouses.  All in all, a great addition to our restaurant options."}
{"text":"Service was AMAZING Food was AMAZING Drinks were AMAING  This is the spot on Sunday brunch  Potato au gratin is a must side dish!!  Will be back soon :)"}
{"text":"So Good! We started with the bang bang shrimp and it was the perfect size for two people. I got the seabass based on the reviews and I am so happy that I did. I love fish already and for those of you who do not like fishy taste the seabass is for you. This tasted like a steak to me. I got the lemon butter sauce and used that on my fish as well as the asparagus and broccoli I received for my sides. The seasonal veggie was zuchinni and tomatoes; but I have a tomato allergy so I paid the extra for the asapargus. I am giving Bonefish 4 stars because our waitress was not very good. She disappeared for quite a while and took awhile to return our drinks and water.I will return."}
{"text":"Going to bonefish grill for weekend brunch became one of our family tradition.  We love the Charleston location because they always have the best service and food is as good as always.  Hubby's fav was the brunch burger added with avocado, patty was juicy, bun was buttered and toasted nicely, paired with house salad to reduce the guilt.  Always work!  Mom loved the fish taco with mango salsa, she loved the fish was grilled but not deep fried, juicy but not dry, paired with the mango salsa, a little bit on the sweet side which was perfect option for a savory and sweet choice.   Since I'm eating for two, I had the bang bang shrimp benny and also the creme brulee french toaste.  lucky me!  Love the benny! bang bang shrimp was as good as always, I can never have enough of them!  However, the french toast was just ok, kinda a meh choice.  There was nothing creme brulee about it, it wasnt well soaked into the custard, it was dry inside while it was nice and crunch on the outside.    Did i mention bottomless mimosa / bellini? Hubby always have the OJ on the side so he can control how much to add in the champagne.  He is so smart~"}
{"text":"We go there at least 3-4 Times a month. Love it Always get a better table with a reservation.  Our fun kit place!"}
{"text":"I love Bonefish. I had seen a couple negative reviews about this one, so I was interested to see if it really was subpar. My mom thinks the Bang Bang Shrimp weren't quite up to their standard, but overall i thought the food was as it should be. This really is one of my favorite restaurants--the only reason it gets 4 instead of 5 is that the prices are just a little ridiculous for ME, though if you're used to eating at high-end restaurants these prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"We loved their happy hour and the $5 menu. The parmesan crusted fish was to die for, and everything seemed fresh. I think this might be our new, local seafood go-to place. Our service behind the bar was excellent. The only thing that was weak was the wedge salad's presentation.(I pictured something more fresh and green) I wish this place well!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went based on a promotion we received in the mail.  We stuck with appetizers only, they'll fill you up.  We had the bang bang shrimp - tasty, crispy, with a perfect sauce on them; the wagyu beef potstickers.  Nice dipping sauce for them.  Also had a cup of the crab and corn chowder.  The bomb!  And the fried Chincoteague oysters with fried dill pickles and a remoulade.  Ya gotta put a bite of oyster and bite of pickle on the fork, dip it into the remoulade and munch.  It's like tartar sauce, but the pickles are on the outside!  Yummy.  We were there during the happy hour 4:30- 6:00.  Noisy, and the wait staff was hopping.  Tough to get their attention for more water and the check.  Oh, and the crushed blackberry  virgin cocktail was refreshing."}
{"text":"The food and service were really really good;however apparently the location by Paradise Valley Mall has closed due to a corporate reorganization where they closed several of the restaurants nationwide. Too bad; I really really liked it!"}
{"text":"The food is always delicious and well worth the money. At this location they accept coupons and have their bang bang Wednesday specials! The location in Summerlin does not, so avoid that one if you can."}
{"text":"The staff were friendly and accommodating, but that doesn't make up for the poor quality of food. They drench everything with sauce to try and cover it up, but even that isn't enough. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Fish and chips here is pretty good but for the price a bit high also every else is lacking one way or the other either not enough food but good taste or missing the taste a bit ... a hit or miss here but the orchids martini was good"}
{"text":"I travel a great deal and try not to eat in Corporate locations. Bone Fish has completely changed my mind. I sat at the bar to catch the game, and felt like a true local! Bartender Rafia and Wendell were extremely helpful in food suggestions and bringing me into Bar conversations. I felt home. Even the Manager, Julie, stopped by to greet us and thank us for the business.   I haven't even got to the food. I had the Shrimp and scallops and my Boss had the Rainbow Trout. Perfectly cooked, perfect accompaniments, perfect service.  Thank you Bone Fish Matthews for making my visit spectacular!   Jeff"}
{"text":"After reading a couple of negative reviews on service, I was a little concerned. But since I had been to Bonefish in Atlanta many years ago, I gave it a try a few months after it opened. I was pleasantly surprised. They completely remodeled The previous Islands. The fish was fresh, tasty, and reasonably priced. Service was at tentative. The house citrus vinegrette salad dressing was superb. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"There are quite a few places to eat in the Crocker Park area. Bonefish Grill is definitely at the top of the list. The service and food are both top notch.   We had the shrimp tacos and the fish basket that came with scallops and jumbo shrimp. They were both absolutely prefect. Portion sizes were large enough to be quite filling especially after the bread we started off with. Our server was very attentive and the manager came by to give us a free appetizer on our next visit.   We came pretty early to catch happy hour without a reservation and it was still pretty busy. I would recommend at least calling ahead to avoid having to wait too long.   My wife and I had a great date night here and highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Blah! I was so exited to take my family if 4 kids , hubby and I and 2 quest for a Sunday brunch ... So disappointed :( the calamari was totally dry and overcooked  , my mouth hurt from chewing so much, the fish and chips had so much breading  on it and so full of oil , my kids all got stomach aches .... The server was not that great either, took about 35-40 min before they even brought out the appetizers , and no, they were not busy at all... Never again!"}
{"text":"Me and my friend went to Bonefish at roughly 3:00pm on Feb. 8th.  I was excised to try this chain, I heard great things about there martini and  appetizers.  To our dismay, we ran into their bartender, John.  We walked to the bar and sat down.  We waited for roughly 5 minutes, John was in a in depth conversation about Super Bowl, talking to the one customer in the building that was exiting.  He made no eye contact. John finally stopped talking enough about the Super Bowl for us to ask for a menu.   We placed  our order through John and we asked him if we can sit at.one tables away from the bar.  John said that was fine.  Our table of two people ordered 4 Martinis and one appetizer (a large Aishi tray I believe it was).  We didn't receive any napkins or silver wear, until 10 minutes after the food was served.  We were able to flag down a lady for silver wear, she asked us if we wanted water too.  Mind you......   There's not ONE SINGLE customer at this bar.   John comes to our table with the check.....  I believe the bill was 60.33. We inserted a 25.00 gift card and two twenties...........    Ten or 15 minutes go by and John never came back with the ticket.......We asked John for the ticket, he responded, \"Oh you guys need that?\"  John came by with the ticket and no change..........WHAT?  It was only 4.00, and some change that should have been coming back.........Im the type of customer that usually tips 25%.....   I believe John was aware of his worth, we were going to tip 10% for his lousy service .......  Quite frankly, 4.00 was too much for his service.  The food was good, but never have we seen such lousy rude service."}
{"text":"This place was surprisingly good...Especially to me, a person who is not a seafoody!!...The burger was good and the orange chicken and rice were a pleasant surprise!!..."}
{"text":"Took my mom here for mother's day.   Service- our server was very nice and attentive despite the restaurant being very busy.  Appetizers: Edamame- Pretty run of the mill and nothing to write home about, but damame is always delicious. Bang bang shrimp- A customer favorite and it's easy to see why. The breading was like and didn't overpower the shrimp and the sauce is a creamy slightly spicy concoction. Everyone enjoyed them.  Coconut shrimp- Definitely the winning appetizer dish of the evening. Some of the best coconut shrimp any of us at the table had ever had! Even my mother, who is not a shrimp eater to begin with, absolutely loved them. And the Thai chili sauce was delicious.  For the main dishes we had swordfish, Chilean sea bass, and a steak. All the dishes where thoroughly enjoyed and the garlic potatoes were great.  Dessert:  Creme brulee- extremely delicious and an extremely generous portion.   Macadamia nut brownie- It is impossible to go wrong mixing macadamia nuts and chocolate. That is all.   Strawberry short cake- Delicious,  but definitely overshadowed by the other desserts.   All around a good dining experience. We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Love this place! I've tried this place before back home in Orange County. Glad they have two locations in Vegas. The Bang Bang shrimp is delicious and tasty. Pork chops with potatoes were tender and juicy. My favorite is their sea bass! You definitely need to try their sea bass. As for alcohol beverages, the Moscow Mule & Watermelon cocktail were refreshing! We had Annie as our server. She was friendly and very efficient."}
{"text":"The service was good. I got a Kobe beef burger but it was dry. The salad and bread were very good. Then I got the donuts for desert and those were delicious!"}
{"text":"Love Denise! We came here for bottomless mimosa and bottomless fun. Denise is very attentive and great classy atmosphere. A little bit off the strip but worth the drive."}
{"text":"We have been to Bonefish several times and always had good food. The bang bang shrimp tacos are great and very reasonably priced. However, the last time there I decided to have fish and chips. They were totally inedible, mushy fish and gunky, mushy, thick breading. If it were not for all the good food we have had here I would have given them 1 star!"}
{"text":"So after having our weekend plans cancel suddenly last minute my honey and I decided on Bonefish since we had just received a BOGO in the mail.  So first off, we came in and asked for a table for two. They took us to the high top tables at the bar that are so super close to each other that you are practically sitting on your neighbors lap. That may be ok if you are at happy hour and open to mingling and doing a little networking. Or even if there is a long wait for the dining room and you are just famished that you just don't care. Totally not appropriate for a Saturday night date with my man. When we asked the hostess if there was another spot we kind of expected her to have to check first. Nope. She knew right where to take us. It's as if she was coached to take us to the uncomfortable bar table first to see if we would just settle first. Not cool!  Now I will say our server (I believe his name was Justin) was awesome. He was on top of it and helped us navigate through the menu. I settled if the the crab crusted cod. It was just kinda meh. I sucked it up because it wasn't bad. It just wasn't tasty either. My boyfriend got the trout which he hated. It was extremely oily/greasy to the point where he had to send it back and order something else. We both had the bacon Mac and cheese which was mind blowing. Put a cape on that dish because it literally saved our dining experience. Now thumbs up to the manager (Shelley?) for coming over and addressing our dissatisfaction with the trout. She was great and extremely professional.  Because of the great service by our waiter, the attentiveness of the manager and the bombalicious Mac n cheese, I will probably give it another shot but most likely just for happy hour drinks and appetizers."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch.  Nice, cozy ambiance.  Went for their cilantro lime salad with a side of ahi tuna.  When the plate arrived the salad was contained in a transparent plastic cylinder and the server proceeded to dump the salad onto the plate.  Odd presentation?   I was met with large chunks of raw red onion, red bell pepper and way overdressed spring mix.  The ahi was crusted in about a half inch of sesame seeds which totally overcompensared for the flavor of the fish.  I'm not picky but was disappointed for my first visit.  Wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"We went to celebrate a birthday. Seating was fast. The place wasn't busy which led me to believe the service was going to be good. But no! The waiter was mediocre.   My meal: The mahi mahi with lobster sauce was great but served with mashed potatoes and a strange spaghetti squash ... Needless to say the mashed potatoes and the squash looked exactly the same. Not at all impressed by the presentation.   His meal: Amazing filet with colossal shrimp and the mashed thing again with the stringy squash.   Drinks: the mojito and the sangria left us no impression.. It was just a drink.  SERVICE: Our waiter never refilled our drinks and disappeared constantly. Took too long to take our order and get our food out. Never offered to upsell or recommend food, drinks, or dessert.  Not in a hurry to return and sit. May take out some protein.   I felt like I went for the big catch and ended up with nothing but the \"fish-bone\""}
{"text":"Liked the old location, love the new one. Talk about friendly service! I ordered the orange roughy, but received the red fish instead. What did they do? Made it right by giving me the red fish for free, and also the orange roughy (superb dish mind you)! Was very happy with my experience here; highly recommended."}
{"text":"Mother's Day Gone Wrong!    It was supposed to be a nice dinner for my mother but this place is horrible from beginning to end.  The greeter ignored me after I checked in but we were seated 10 minutes ahead of our reservation.  Our server was unknowledgeable about their menu and inattentive.  It took 10 minutes for her to bring out sweetener for the iced tea that we ordered and refills were nonexistent.  3 of our 4 orders were wrong.  We weren't informed of any specials and our table didn't receive bread like the other tables did.  Their side salad was a \"spring mix\" with vinaigrette dressing (dressing good/spring mix bad).  The tilapia was dry and the truffle mac and cheese ($6 upcharge because it's a premium side) was flavorless.  The bill was $140, which is normally reasonable (1 appetizer, 4 nonalcoholic beverages and 4 entrees).  However the quality/taste of the food and the service make it \"highway robbery.\"  Even the drinks were disappointing.  How do you mess up lemonade and raspberry ice tea?  If you still decide to try this place after reading this review, just make sure to check that your plates and glasses are clean, as that was an issue also.  Side note:  I'm claustrophobic and they have a revolving door as their main door and just the mere sight of the darn things gets my anxiety level up.  They do have a regular door just a little ways from the main entrance that I was able to use.  This didn't effect the food or service rating but it was a negative towards their atmosphere, which was the only nice thing about this place.  Overall, this was a horrible experience and I will never eat here again nor would I recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"We get take out from here and it can be hit or miss. Well last night was a miss. Was told 15-20 it ended up being 45. The forgot some of our sides so I had to wait for those. I asked to have items removed from my dish and both contained the items I asked to have omitted. They asked me if I wanted silverware and they didn't provide that. The food was ok. Just overall disappointed with this to go order."}
{"text":"Had the Bang Bang Shrimp--fantastic. Side of mashed potatoes--awesome. Chocolate creme brulee--amazing Main dinner of vegetables and couscous--bland, bland, bland.  I know it's a fish place, but if you're going to offer a vegetarian option why does it have to suck? Did the chef taste this dish before putting it on the menu?  Stuff like this makes me grumpy...giving meat eaters more reasons to hate vegetarians!  (Well, mostly vegetarian. The shrimp was worth breaking the rules.)"}
{"text":"I went here for a business lunch and found it to be such a disappointment. For the price is the place you would expect it to have quality food and clean atmosphere, but it was not for me. Maybe it was just a bad day? Who knows but I walked in and used the restroom while waiting for my colleague, there were two bathroom stall, one was plug and the other one wasn't but there was one roll of toilet paper that was out and one that was about to be out. The floor was littered with dust and small paper debris. This was at 12 in the afternoon, there were many staff members standing around, since there was only about three tables I would expect them to try to clean the place a little bit. Skip to the food, it was not very good for the price and even if it was a little cheaper I would have still thought it was bad. The service was actually good, our waiter was very nice so it wasn't his fault that the place was dirty and the food was bad. I went back to the bathroom an hour later and it was still Not cleaned. Needless to say I won't be coming back. Cleanliness in a restaurant should be very important to the owner."}
{"text":"Great service and delicious food. I have been to bonefish in Maryland, DC and Las Vegas and I always have great service! I mainly come for the bang bang shrimp but I didn't realize Tuesday is a 3 course meal deal they have where you can get the bang bang shrimp for $6!! I was pleased and my daughter loves this place because of the bread and the fact she can draw on the paper table setting they put down after each meal."}
{"text":"I dined at the Matthews location last night, and sat at the bar. The  day boat scallops were amazing, and my friends Lily's salmon was wonderful as well. The only thing to out do the food was the amazing bar staff. Wendell, Richard, and Stephanie as well as your manager in training!!!!!!! Kudos to the managers for having such an outstanding staff!!! I will be back!"}
{"text":"The food and appetizers were delicious.  Not a cheap place to eat.  The main course portions are closer to appetizer size than entree size."}
{"text":"We dined at Bonefish the first night of their soft opening.  We were greeted by a very nice hostess named Ricci.  Our server named Steve had never waited tables before but did a great job taking care of our wants and needs.  The food was above average.  Served fast and hot.  A server supervisor asked if we wanted Expresso.  Really.  It's Espresso. Someone needs to train the trainer.  Am I axing for too much. Lol"}
{"text":"I usually sit at the bar when I dine at this location. And everything is ALWAYS on point! Service from the bartenders Shawn and Amy is impeccable. I usually come in alone and they make me feel like I'm not which makes me always want to come back! Food is delicious every time. I had the malbec marinated steak last time and oh my gosh it was superb! I will definitely get it again! The drinks are always good and everything is fresh. I love this place and recommend it to people that come in to the restaurant that I work at all the time! Oh and make sure you try the pumpkin ravioli they have as a side right now... its like heaven."}
{"text":"Last night I took my son here to eat dinner. It was his 1st time...my 2nd. My 1st visit was at their other location in town square about 2 years ago, & it was the worst experience ever that I swore I'd never give this place another chance! The only reason why I went the 2nd time was because they had sent me a buy 1 entree, get one free up to $25. We get there @ 7:30 pm & the place was packed! I had to park at Flemings next door & got the last parking spot over there ...both lots were full. We enter the restaurant & we were warmly greeted by the 2 hostesses & seated us right then. We waited about 10 min b4 our server came over to acknowledge us...now it's 7:40 pm. He walks up to r table & asks are you ready to order? I told him we needed a few min...he disappears again for 10 min & comes back @ 7:50 & takes r order. We ordered the bang bang shrimp for r app, which came out right away..I think by 8 pm. Those were delicious, but not worth the money! You get maybe 12 small shrimp for $11.50...$1 for each one?? Then our server Brant said he'd bring us out some hot bread , but came back 2 r table 2 say the bread was in the oven. We finally get r bread served at 8:30 pm & now have been sitting here an hour already...isn't the bread supposed to come out as soon as you get there?? Now I'm wondering where r food is cause we've been waiting 40 min on a MR Ribeye & my rare filet?? When I ask r server where's r food, he tells me there's 2 big parties on the other side of the restaurant & also that their computers went down earlier & that backed the kitchen up . I'm the customer...I don't want to hear all the excuses, I'm starving & want my food cause we've been waiting a very long time ! 5 min goes by & my son & i's eyes were on everyone coming out of the kitchen wondering if that's r food coming & I tell my son, I'm waiting 5 more min. If r food isn't here by then, were leaving...this is ridiculous ! The food comes out within that 5 min, & although the food was very tasty, it wasn't hot! The steak was room temp like it had been sitting on a plate for awhile...not like it just came off the grill! The only thing hot was the Au gratin potatoes! I wasn't impressed w r server at all ...I had to always look around for him & had to wait for the extras I asked for & by the time I received them, I was almost done & didn't need it now ! The food was very tasty & delicious...just not hot, & service was very slow ! Don't go if your starving & hadn't eaten all day like I did, cause I almost walked out! And lastly , r dinner plates were still on the table when we left...he never cleared r plates when he brought us r check! The tip I left him reflected on the service he gave us! Management, you need to take a look at your staff & retrain...cause the service sucks at both locations both times I've tried you! And both times we got male servers...Aweful! The ambiance of this place when you 1st walk in was a classy feel w the dark wood tables/booths, white linens on the tables & Dim lights & can't remember if there were candles on the tables. We didn't have 1 at r booth , but that would make a nice touch for that restaurant. They are a bit pricey to be in a neighborhood restaurant! With those prices , you need to relocate to the strip ...then your prices would make more sense !"}
{"text":"I think 4 would be fair however our waiter was way too in our faces, it was annoying to say the least and the fact that he repeated our orders and still got mine wrong and then blamed the cooks repeatedly telling me that he put the order in right and it was the kitchen's fault...just say your sorry and move on. It was like he could not leave it alone. On with the review...we went on a Saturday for dinner so it was packed. We almost could not get in the door. It was packed. I will say make a reservation because we did and after we finally got to the hostess we were seated immediately. The wait for others, over an hour. We were greeted by a waitress who was nice but then she tagged out with the waiter who was not good. He spent what felt like 10 minutes explaining the menu and drinks and apps and everything in between. He kept repeating himself. We were annoyed. They were out of the sea bass which was a bummer. We ordered apps. Our friends got the steamed edamamme which was really delightful. We chose the fried calamari which was lightly breaded and fresh. For drinks... they rocked it! My friend got the apple martini which was really good but on the very sweet side. Her hubby got a mojito which was excellent. I got the raspberry martini and it was so fresh and delightful. So good I got another. For our entrees I got the swordfish with mango also and chose to add an upgraded side of smashed sweet potatoes. What I got was the swordfish special that came with pumpkin ravioli. The manager came over and apologized and they corrected it. I did eat the pumpkin ravioli and they were very good. The fish was very fresh which is terrific! My friend got a salad and noted that the dressing was water. Her hubby got steak and crab cake. It was a very thin fillet and the crab cake was small. My hubby got a steak and enjoyed it noting it was cooked as requested. We opted out of dessert. We could not take our waiter any more. He was very intrusive. Overall the food and drink was very good but the wait staff was not good!"}
{"text":"my first time here and the experience was so great.. ambience was so nice, foods were so delicious, staffs are very professional.. overall were satisfied with this first class experience"}
{"text":"The appetizers were great, the service was very good, but my Ahi Tuna steak was very over done - to the point you could visibly see it was incorrect."}
{"text":"Honestly has such a great brunch menu for an affordable price. They do endless bottomless for like $20, and the food is actually good! The owner is super kind and even took pictures with me & my girls afterwards. I think I have found a reliable brunch place now. Plus, did I mention that there are different bubbly drinks you can have? They range from peach, mimosa, and even sangria. Also, get the French toast, super yummy!!"}
{"text":"I went here with my parents and boyfriend for dinner on a Friday night. We were told the wait would be 35 minutes, but it was more like 45. It was very loud in there with people talking, plus they had music playing too. No appetizers, just entrees. I ordered one of the wood-grilled fish, rainbow trout. It comes with a seasonal vegetable and a side. I asked what the seasonal vegetable was and our server said it was cous cous. Huh?? I was going to get the garlic mashed potatoes as a side since it came with a vegetable, but had to quickly change my order because I wanted a vegetable and a starch. We were all kind of annoyed by this as we had all chosen our side based on the fact that it came with seasonal vegetables. Also ordered was Mahi Mahi. The fish and side portions were adequate, but the cous cous was no more than a 2 tablespoon scoop. We left feeling hungry, but granted it was fish and that's not very filling. It was a bit expensive too, but again it's fish. Overall, it's way overrated. I thought I heard the server say it was part of a concept restaurant and as a whole I am very unimpressed with those restaurants. They seem to focus more on décor than they do food or service."}
{"text":"I had a 50$ gift card for this place and I always pass by it so my boyfriend and I decided to come here for dinner. The whole dining area is pretty dark as there aren't any windows, besides near the front where the bar is.  On the east wall is a huge piece of art in the shape of a fish made from some sort of metal (I think). I thought that was pretty cool. But my god is there a lot of wood. Feels like someone's grandmas house.   The food here can be a bit on the pricey side. This would be one of those places to come to on special occasions, for me at least.   I decided to get the spicy tuna bowl and my boyfriend got the rib eye steak with rice and fries.  The steak was cooked perfectly and the jasmine rice was a bit mushy compared to what I like but still good.  The spicy tuna bowl came with half an avocado, about 8 pieces (I think) of tuna with sesame seeds on it,  and wonton crisps on a bed of the same jasmine rice. I'm not a big fan of sesame seeds but it wasn't an overwhelming amount. The bowl was good but it wasn't something I was overly excited about. I could probably get a similar dish for a cheaper price somewhere else.   All the servers there wore chef jackets which was interesting, I would probably sweat my ass off wearing one all day.   I forgot our servers name, but the service was decent. We only saw her once when we first ordered, once when she checked up on us, and again when we wanted our check. Had to wait about 15 minutes after we finished eating before we even got our bill. I had asked a guy in a button up shirt (maybe a manager?), who took my boyfriends plate, for a to-go box and I never got it so I assumed he forgot about us. It seems there were other people that the employees would rather tend to - like the old, rich, white people.   Our server came back with our bill a few minutes later and offered to get me a box..alright then lol.   Overall the food was pretty good and the service was alright but I wouldn't recommend this place nor would I come back."}
{"text":"I went to Bonefish Grill with someone who'd raved about the Bang Bang Shrimp. Now personally I didn't think that there was much you could do to a shrimp that I hadn't already eaten but boy was I wrong...  Fried shrimp in a spicy aoili sauce, with just enough kick to keep your eyes open but not too spicy that your make up would water.   Everything else was a blur.   Bang Bang Shrimp...seriously they're amazing!"}
{"text":"Normally I really like Bonefish Grill and everything was going great until the waiter brought my entree and left with my soft drink to refill.  He took 10 minutes to return, and even took an order at the table beside me, and after reminding him, brought them a new drink, but not mine. Had to ask again. By now my entree is cold and and I'm in a bad mood.   Food was great but you lost two stars because of the drink."}
{"text":"Perfect experience! My parents, husband, and I came here last night for my birthday, and everything was amazing! I had a fresh pineapple martini that was on happy hour for only $5. We had two shrimp appetizers (bang bang and Thai coconut I believe?) and they were both so tasty! I added a cup of the corn chowder with lump crab meat and it was so good. I had the crab cake and filet mignon entree with the garlic-whipped mashed potatoes and fresh, steamed broccoli, and it all was exceptional! The creme brûlée dessert was to die for! They even gave me a hand-written birthday card with a coupon in it for a free appetizer, along with a couple chocolate covered strawberries on the house. Kelly, our server, was super friendly and on top of it! Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"One of the best Seafood places to eat in Vegas! Definitely recommend going to Bone Fish Grill. I love their Crab Cake & King Crab ! Must try"}
{"text":"Bonefish has fabulous mixed drinks, food and of course, their bang-bang shrimp! They also have bang-bang chicken, which if you come during happy hour is only $5! They used to have this fresh muddled strawberry drink that was amazing. I'm sad they just took it off the menu. I have never had a bad dish here and the service is really good!"}
{"text":"We love the food at bonefish. So we are in bar to be quick. Paul was supposed to be our server but he was chatting up a table of blond girls and oblivious to us waiting. The hostess even whispered in his ear and pointed to us. After another 5 minutes we sat at actual bar and asked if we could get food there. Austin was fabulous and took care of us right away.  We had iced teas while watched Paul walk the girls out still oblivious to us. I travel a lot and go to bonefish while I am way. I have to say you almost lost a really good customer tonight. The 3 stars is only because of Austin  Have to add props to john.  John made sure our food was awesome. He even noticed our dumplings came out too early so had them remade. I am now giving 4 stars Because of Austin and john. Paul made it impossible to give 5"}
{"text":"We went to the town square location several Months ago. The food was delicious but a bit pricy. Just learned that there is a location in Summerlin we had not known about. Decided to give it a go. Must say the service here is really great. We sat at the bar and ordered the bang bang shrimp and ahi tuna with some drinks. The food is to die for and the bartender was so friendly. We'll be making this one of our regular spots."}
{"text":"Great location at Town Square and its a nice restaurant. I ordered steak because I'm on a crazy diet and it was good, not the best I've ever had but it was pricey.  The chain is well known in town and I want to go back for the happy hour!  My friends ordered some seafood and even though I couldn't try any it did look good. I would try it again and make sure to hit them up for happy hour next time."}
{"text":"The look and appearance was sleek, which is standard to all locations. The service was okay and the food... mediocre.   The bam bam shrimp, Wednesday's half-priced special was the best item on the table. The ginger beef wonton potsticker appetizers I think they're called... friends said they couldn't tell if it was really beef.. it tasted like mush and that they were salty. I got a side of au gratin potatoes -fake cheese sauce, only a few of the cubed potatoes were actually cooked all the way through. My other side was broccoli which was steamed. It was much better than the other side. My friends also got alcoholic drinks. They said the drinks were okay, but not as strong as other Bonefish Grill locations up north."}
{"text":"WELCOME BACK BONEFISH! We missed you but you don't get 5 stars until you bring Grouper back.  Tito's Texas Martini may be the best in town and such a deal as well. We really enjoyed the Paco & Lola Albarino but it's $10 less a bottle at King's Fishhouse.  We loved the Bang Bang shrimp and Seared Ahi appetizers. However, the dinners were the real stars: Dorado with mango salsa on the side was incredibly fresh with a nice taste of the grill. Ditto for the Redfish special with Romesco sauce, on the side of course. Overall the food quality may be better than my memories of the old store in Henderson.  A couple of suggestions: I don't think open bus/service areas will ever be as popular as open kitchens were, so build a wall and add a door. It's ugly and distracting to have that area open to the lovely dining room. About those window shades, they're going the wrongway! Something is needed to block the lower part of the windows, to obscure the view of the parking lot and keep headlights from shining into the dining room.  A few minor issues that should be addressed but great food and drinks at reasonable prices. Hope they stick around for a long time."}
{"text":"I don't usually like chains but this one has great food and has excellent servers. I love the bang bang shrimp! Their drinks are alright - would be nice to have cheaper specials for martinis. Nice decor and reasonably priced food!   The manager is very nice too. :)"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this place.. I've come here three times.. Twice I went with friends that knew the people who work here and everything was ok.. But the third time I came with my fiancé. There was no one in the restaurant because it was raining but our service was awful. At one time I had to go to the hostess just to ask for our waiter. Next they cooked my fiancé steak wrong. When he asked about it they took it back and the second time they still cooked it wrong. After that we just wanted to leave we were going to spend our whole time going back and forth just to get a steak cooked correctly. The \"cook\" came out at least the cook that cooked his steak and he was the manager. He was ok but he said maybe bonefishs medium steak is different I thought asking for a steak cooked medium was the same across the board. The amount of money you spend here is not worth the service or the food! Don't bother coming here!"}
{"text":"The ambiance here is incredible. Spacious bar area with great tenders. Intimately lit dining room with comfortable booths. Background music kept a fast paced beat to keep the busy diners alive and attentive. Our dinner entrees were both fish and were exquisitely prepared with great veggie sides. Thanks to JD, Jason and Angela our server. We will be back again and again, if only for the Bang Bang!"}
{"text":"Mega yummy and rich! Danielle was our waitress, such a beautiful gem!!! She made the night fun. Food was quick and delicious, the bathrooms were clean! And food was tasty! See ya soon! Xoxo."}
{"text":"Our servers Billy and Chris were great at getting my friends their rounds on mimosas. It was my best friend's birthday brunch. She got chocolate strawberries and a coupon for bang bang shrimp on her next visit. Most of my friends recommend the blackberry sangria. It wasn't busy as we thought it would be when we went around 12. The endless bubble brunch is $20. It's also in Town Square, so you'll be able to shop around after. I got an omelette, which was good. I haven't ever had a bad omelette anywhere, and I'm not picky. The only thing I wish they did was to ask my friends who got a burger how they wanted it. They got it rare, and she didn't feel like eating after. They split our checks accordingly. We were in and out of there for as long we wanted to be."}
{"text":"Always great food and service.  Just got back into town, manager came over to talk and also gave us some chocolates."}
{"text":"This was a second visit this year. We were regulars at a Bonefish in Michigan and were excited to find one here. Our first experience about ten month's ago was disappointing but we gave it another shot. The food was tasty and the waiter was attentive. We were glad to meet the new manager which explained why the restaurant had improved. Three of us had fish and one of us had a steak. My haddock was ordered from the special menu so it had a sauce and artichokes. Our friend loved his fish and chips. The shrimp and scallops were tasty but the portion could have been larger. I love the sides at Bonefish. I had sautéed spinach with a hint of garlic. The mashed potatoes were just right. I tasted a green bean which was cooked in slightly too much oil. You can ask for it to be steamed. I personally would never order a steak in a seafood restaurant but I know that the same company owns Flemings next door. The hubby was satisfied with his steak which was a generous portion. My friend's raspberry martini was tart with a rim of sugar. We will definitely return now that we know it is under different management."}
{"text":"good food, great company, but very slow service.  the server only had 3 tables (1, 3 and 4 people).  Had to ask for the server multiple times and ahe forgot a drink for 1/2 of the meal."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I have been here or to any other location for that matter. The food was on point and everyone in my party seemed to enjoy. The food is pretty pricey but if it worth it or not you will have to decide for yourself. The only two complaints I have it the waitress seemed a bit odd. She wasn't a very good people person very mellow at best.  That's not always a bad thing just saying. And my biggest complaint is the floor is \"Filthy\" and everyone in my party noticed it so it wasn't just me. Several of us had on sneakers and we found ourselves slipping and sliding. If you stand back and look at the floor you can see some sort of greasy film on it, so be carefu"}
{"text":"What can I say, but what a great place that takes care of their customers!!!  Brought wife here for here birthday.  All meals were great but the fish.  Fish was good but ours ended up over powered by the burning wood.  Our fish ended up having a very strong Burnt Wood flavor.  Management found out and bent over backwards to make it right.  They ended up comping our entire meals.     With strong customer service, I will be back."}
{"text":"My wife & I had diner. We both felt rushed, our salads and main meal arrived a few minutes appart. Before we completed our meal, we were being pushed to order deserts. Not an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"I just tried to eat at Bonefish Grill at Concord Mills.  I called them at 5:45 pm to make a reservation for 6:30 pm or the next available. I was told a reservation was not required tonight. I arrived at Bonefish at 6:45 pm to be told that there was a 30 minute wait for two people and a child. I then asked the hostess why I was told a reservation was not required. The hostess that I spoke with at my arrival then said that I was not allowed to make same day reservations.  If you won't convenience and good service don't eat here. I was very disappointed and left due to inconsistency in what I was told."}
{"text":"We - 2 adults and 2 kids - enjoyed a delicious dinner with great service. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Food kinda sucks here not a big fan of the salmon it hade a really odd smell to   I gave it back and hade a salad instead"}
{"text":"The fish and chips is delicious, and the service has been fabulous every time I've been there. I always sit at the bar, and they really take good care of you there."}
{"text":"When Bonefish opened two years ago, several of my friends were super excited to share this place with the rest of us who had not had an opportunity to try.    My girls and I have been here several times.  When that happens, the husband gets sad because he feels like I am keeping him away from something amazing.  So, I had to take him there for my birthday dinner one year ago.  This review is for my overall impression of Bonefish from multiple trips.  Delightful happy hour specials.  I cannot come here without having the bang bang shrimp.  The last time I was there, I decided to opt for the bang bang shrimp burger.  With shared apps, I did not finish my burger, but that meant I go to take it home and enjoy the following day for lunch.  Sign up for the email.  Bonefish will send you emails for discounts or other fun events.  I feel like they are teasing me with the brunch that they offer on holidays.  I will make it there one day!"}
{"text":"The Bang Bang Shrimp is the best item on the menu. You cannot skip it! We brought out daughter & her Homecoming date for dinner & sat separately from them. The one thing hunny asked was that we get their check so they didn't have to worry about money. We asked the hostess and our waitress and they still didn't get it right.   The cocktail was ok. Like I said, the Bang Bang Shrimp are amazing! Hunny ordered a steak and I added on a soup. The soup was spicy, and lukewarm. The steak was cooked well. The green beans were al dente at best. It wasn't the best visit, but we would probably give them another shot."}
{"text":"Highly recommend bang bang shrimp$6 on Wednesday. Great to go or eating in. Try it as an appetizer or main dish. Other items are ok but not over the top. Not a great place tor kids. Brunch on Sunday's is limited"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. I loved the bang bang shrimp! The house salad was just ok. The salmon with pesto was fantastic. Green beans were good and mac and cheese would have been good except it was riddled with mushrooms. I somehow missed that part when reading the menu!"}
{"text":"I took my husband to Bonefish last evening for his Birthday. When I made the reservation the young lady asked if I was celebrating a \"special occassion\", I told her yes my husbands birthday. She said great. We arrived at restuarant, was seated quickly, waiter took our order and our food came in a timely manner. This is where I became very dissappointed with this place!  They did nothing for my husband...not even a tiny scoop of anykind of dessert with a candle....Nothing geeze I have never been to a restuarant that did not bring out just alittle something for the birthday person!  The next thing that irked me was that my bill came to $72.10, I put down a one hundred dollar bill, two one's and a dime. When the waiter came by to pick up my money, He says: \" Oh no change back\" That is the most arrogant statement a server can make to a customer. A server should NEVER ask a patron if they need change back!!!, just bring the customer their change back and let them leave you the tip. The service and the food were definitely not worth a 30% tip...he was lucky I even left 16%. I will tell everyone I know not to go to this place!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, even better service. Really made my girls birthday special. Thanks you guys!"}
{"text":"I have been too other bonefish locations liked it so much when the opened in Madison..excitement...so very very disappointed. We ordered 3 separate dishes and apps..all were one step away from tasteless. Service was slow..no water or bread was served..and then the bill came $$$$$ so much money for bad food.."}
{"text":"Bang Bang Shrimp = YUMMY in my tummy!!  Great as an appetizer and even better as Bang Bang Tacos- with their home style chips!!!  Not sure if they're still running the $5 special on Wednesday nights, but definitely worth the price regardless of the special.  Fish entree Eric had was delicious, I forgot what it was, something with a cream sauce, sausage, spinach...  Every time we dine there, they are consistent in their level of service.  Super nice, attentive, and friendly. Restaurant is always clean. Decore is great, with dark woods, a yellowish glow of lights that make the ambiance relaxing and private.  we go there for Bang Bang about once a month :o)"}
{"text":"Our birthday girl (mother in law) is on a diet and wanted a low carb dinner so we figured bonefish would be a good spot, she had never been there before.   Location is in town square,  but a stand-alone building so parking was ample.  They have a cute outside area which would be nice to hang out and have drinks. Interior was nice, looks similar to the bonefish that was on Eastern that has sadly closed.   We went for an early dinner and we were one of the first diners in the joint. our server Jamie was very nice, chatty and patient with us. They have iPads to take our order which was nice to see a company embracing technology an using it to their advantage.   We started off with the Hawaiian martini, it'a a little sweet for my tastebuds but the MiL loved it. We also ordered the mango martini which was very refreshing and had a nice little spice. I enjoyed the red sangria taste, however no fruit included- which I though was a little odd. It was entered into the iPad and instantly sent to the bartender- pretty cool!  We had the bang bang shrimp appetizer and edamame, both excellent. The soup is so tasty, that was slurped up in an instant! Eric enjoyed the Lily chicken and gobbled it up!  I had the server surprise me and she ordered the sea bass which was cooked to perfection. The MiL ordered dori picatta and was deeply disappointed. She had a few bites and ate her green beans and half of my sea bass. Honestly the scallops, fish and shrimp tasted quite awful and dry, like it was a frozen meal thrown in the microwave. We aren't the type to complain and the server saw she barely touched her food, so she sent the manager over to talk to us. The server and manager did the right thing and it was removed from our tab. It was a nice surprise and refreshing to know that there are still restaurants that care about the food, their reputation and most importantly, taking care of their patrons.   We polished off our meal with a coconut custard pie and they gave the birthday girl a small box of chocolate which made our dining experience better with the birthday girl leaving with a smile on her face.   Had it not been for the picatta, i would have rated this dining experience a 5!  But we'll be back!  Wednesdays are $5 bang bang shrimp - just so you know!"}
{"text":"We absolutely adore BFG!   Started going in Macon, GA many years ago. Moved to Tucson in 1/15 and found out they had a location in Mesa!   Made the drive up there and was not disappointed! Typical amazing food with better service and prices!   Don't listen to all these self entitled wieners, writing \"books\" about picking this place apart. They're \"laughable,\" at best. This place is hands down, the best bang for the buck.   We've lived in 7 states and have seen a lot of places. Very hard to beat BFG."}
{"text":"Out for dinner after work traveling. Looking for a lighter flare so stopped by a favorite place. I LOVE their fish. Since I eat out often I asked the waitress for her suggestion. I went with the Crab Crusted Cod. A great choice she suggested. I chose the wedge salad with blue cheese dressing as a side. (This has become a favorite of mine and this was really good and not watered down). Also had the au gratin potatoes which are always good.  I sat at the bar which I normally do when eating alone. Waitress was friendly and helpful and got me everything I asked for.  Chelsea took great care of me.   I have ate here several times and never had a bad meal. Great atmosphere. Good wine selection. I had a glass of merlot that was really good. I asked for name of it that she told me (the name escapes me) however is only sold to restaurants.   I will continue to frequent Bone Fish Grill for a long time to come. Keep it up."}
{"text":"*Note: I made this post December 2014, but thought I had already posted it at the time when I hadn't.*  If this review was solely on food, it would honestly be three stars. I don't know if it was just me and my taste buds that night, but, everything tasted \"meh\"; the first bite out of everything tasted good, but then every bite after that tasted kind of mediocre.   My family and I had dinner here and started with the Bang Bang Shrimp and Ahi Tuna Sashimi. The Bang Bang Shrimp is pretty okay, a good mix of flavors. The Ahi Tuna was okay as well. For our main courses we had Cold Water Lobster Tails and the Fontina Chop. The Lobster Tails were ok, every bite was as delicious as the last, contrary to the majority of my meal. However, the lobsters were plain with no seasoning or special flavoring; there are however, lemons and melted butter given on the side (along with a side of your choice: rice, mashed potatoes, etc.). When my Mother cooks Lobsters for dinner, she cooks them with a special sauce; making her lobsters extremely delicious with the seasoning and sauce being present through every bite. I'm mentioning this, due to the fact that, it may factor to why I see the lobsters as plain. Moving on, the Fontina Chop, was pretty good. Although, like I said, every bite after the first tasted mediocre to me."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here multiple times and have never had a bad experience. Their food is always amazing! We typically go on Tuesday nights which is their deal night that for a 3 course meal it starts at $16.90. We always get the steak and it is so juicy and flavorful! And since you are at Bonefish Grill you have to get an appetizer of Bang Bang Shrimp which is just $6 instead of the regular price when you order it with the dinner special. The cocktails here are also very good. This is just a great place to grab dinner with friends and/or family that isn't too overpriced."}
{"text":"First time here. Nice place but did not feel anything was super special. The soup was ok and I had the bang bang shrimp. My husband had a salad."}
{"text":"My girl and I stopped for an early Friday dinner at Bonefish. We were seated right away, and just beat the crowd.  I was very hungry and wanted a large portion of food, so I ordered the Alaskan Cod Fish & Chips. The only complaint I have was that the breading on the fish seemed to absorb an excessive amount of grease. Perhaps the fryers weren't on high enough? Other than that, it was your basic fish & chips.   I'm not a very big fan of chain restaurants as I feel they sacrifice on quality, natural ingredients because they're trying to cut costs. I'm a big fan of farm-to-table, so that's why Bonefish only got 3 stars."}
{"text":"It was a cold winter night but we ventured out to Bonefish Grill regardless of the windy and freezing weather. The food here first off was phenomenal. The flavors of every item we had came through with such perfection. I usually have the problem of a lot of chain restaurants adding too much salt to their meals but I did not have this problem here. We had a few apps and my favorite by far was the bang bang shrimp. It had the perfect amount of spice and the shrimp were actually a decent size. As good as the food was I think the service was even better. Everyone was super attentive and had no problem explaining dishes and answering questions. Over all it was a great dining experience and we will be coming back to this location in the future."}
{"text":"a little late in writing my review but better late than never.  now I might be biased but I loved everything about my visit to Bonefish Grill on 5.19.15.   the service was amazing ... which always starts off the mood right, the food was on point, definitely recommend the mule as a drink of choice (I had 3 ... don't judge) hahaha and the chilean sea bass.  For  dessert, try the strawberry shortcake sooo yummy, but I failed to get a picture because when they delivered it, the topping had a RING on it and then my finance cleaned it off and PROPOSED to me.   oh man .... thank you to the staff here for making an ordinary Tuesday ... EXTRAORDINARY !!! this will definitely be our spot!!!"}
{"text":"When I first saw this restaurant I was surprised they put it against a recently opened Target store. I would have never found it.  I took a girlfriend to dinner here. We got there when it opened so we had no wait. Our waiter was friendly but took a long time to deliver my special requests. We enjoyed the bread and pesto sauce. My girlfriend had a limited edition crab dinner complete with crabmeat. I had their special salmon on their daily special. Portion size is not overwhelming but enough to satisfy. We both found our meals good.  They are a bit on the pricy side but since we stuck to our entrees and regular beverages the bill wasn't overwhelming. After we paid our bill I asked for a refill which I never received. We then decided to leave.  I did not realize this place is a chain and will note that for future reference. I do like the fact that it is casual dining but I would have suggested a better location for it."}
{"text":"When I entered the restaurant, the first couple of things I noticed was a haughty appearing nod from a waiter and a peculiar smell.  I made my way through the dimly lit place to the bar.  I was greeted with an enthusiastic, \"well, hello there!\" from the bartender.  As I waited for my friend, I ordered a glass of Sauvignon Blanc.  They were out of the one on the menu; however, the bartender poured me a glass of the wonderful Kim Crawford. My friend had chosen for us to meet there.  She did not realize that I am not consuming seafood at this time, but I am so good at being a vegetarian that I could make a suitable meal at Hardee's if that were the only option.  We both ordered the spinach salad without bacon.  It came with egg and what appeared to be French fried onions, tossed in a warm balsamic vinaigrette.  When the bartender found out that I was vegetarian, he gave me a little bit of grief about it.  Which is not cool, but I, being the professional vegetarian smarty pants that I am, turned his comments into some off color jokes, making those in earshot snicker.  On the bartender's behalf, he was attentive. For my entree, I ordered three vegetables:  potatoes au gratin, steamed asparagus, and steamed broccoli.  Generous portions, and I was even more pleasantly surprised that each was perfectly seasoned!   I didn't love it and didn't hate it.  I typically do not choose chain restaurants, but Bonefish Grill did the best that they could to please yours truly, Ms. Smarty Pants."}
{"text":"My mom and I stopped for dinner on our way to the Nutcracker. The mahimahi Oscar is what I had and it was perfect. The orange roughy that mom had was delicious as well. Also,  you must have a piece (or 2) of their coconut pie.   This is the second time I have been at a Bonefish and not only was the food great, but the service is fantastic!  The servers are happy and very attentive. The atmosphere is nice, the drinks are good too!"}
{"text":"Chain restaurants are difficult but Bonefish does it right. It was a little tough because we weren't waited on for about 20 mins once we were seated. It seemed as though everyone was confused about who should wait on our table. Nonetheless, our waitress was great and helpful. The food was also super tasty. The salmon with the asian sauce was amazing. I highly recommend that dish. I'll for sure go in the future despite my hate of chain restaurants lol"}
{"text":"Just had a great meal with a friend.  Our servers had a great attitude, were friendly and created a very pleasant dining experience.  We ate simply ordering the beef potstickers and fish and chips. The food was excellent."}
{"text":"The best part of the meal was the dipping oil for the bread. I found the Bonedish Grille to be an upper scale Red Lobster."}
{"text":"GREAT PLACE!!!!! The food, the Service, the ambience.  I've been to more exclusive places and paid more money for the same quality of service that I've received here.  Most bang for your buck!!!"}
{"text":"We stopped here on the last night in town.  The place was pretty busy, but we got seated right away. Tried the Shrimp and scallops with the Pan Asian sauce, Au gratin and Rice. Everything tasted great and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"Our first time here and everything was fantastic!! You have to try the bang bang shrimp, it was like totally awesome !! Fur sure:) Cassy was our server and she was sweet and very patient with us newbies."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about Bonefish. My boyfriend and I come here at least once a week. The food is always amazing and the service is great. We've had Robert as our waiter a couple of times and he's awesome. He has very thorough knowledge of the menu as well as the cocktails. I totally trust his opinion.   The bang bang shrimp appetizer is SO good. I swear I crave it during the week. We've also had the flatbread appetizer that was equally as great.   I love the seared ahi tuna bowl. It has jasmine rice and avocado. The ocean trust tropic martini is my favorite. It's light and refreshing and fruity with just the right amount of heat from the jalapeño. The bartenders also make a great dirty martini with studded bleu cheese olives.   Our FAVORITE at Bonefish though is the weekend brunch. $20 for whatever brunch entree you want with BOTTOMLESS bubbles (mimosas, bellinis or blackberry sangria). I've had the Oscar omelette which was great but our favorite is the eggs Benedict. You can't go wrong with the surf and turf Benedict or the bang bang shrimp Benedict.   The manager is always walking around and is courteous enough to check on everyone through out the day. She's super sweet.   So excited Bonefish moved in to where islands used to be. Definitely check it out for weekend brunch!!"}
{"text":"We ordered the bang bang shrimp appetizer, shrimp pad Thai and lobster grilled cheese and it was AMAZING. Hands down the best restaurant I've been to in a while. The service was nice and quick as well. This restaurant is probably my favorite right now. I would definitely recommend this place to everyone I know."}
{"text":"I visited bonefish on 04/26/2014..as I enter the building around 9:30 the host was nowhere near.I approach the hispanic bartender and ask her that i need a table, she helpfully call the young skinny african American girl which from across the room ask me \"What do you want\". I found that to be very rude and for that reason I will not be visit this location anymore. Im a big bonefish fan and I alway recommend this place, i will recommend other locations except this one."}
{"text":"We can always be seated here quickly after church on Sundays so it's a go-to. We had a party of six and still didn't have to wait. Yes!  A staple appetizer here is bang bang shrimp. I swear there were over a dozen shrimp in my appetizer.   If you like sweet drinks, definitely try the red sangria. It's delicious! And I don't really like sweet drinks!  Four words describe their best entree: Parmesan-encrusted rainbow trout. Seriously, the rainbow trout covers the majority of the plate. It's seasoned to perfection and the portion size is huge.   I wouldn't get spinach again as much as I love spinach. It was under-seasoned. It was my second attempt with it so I know now it's not for me...even after adding table-side seasonings!  I didn't have room for dessert; I rarely do. But a second glass of red sangria.... yes!"}
{"text":"Two girlfriends and I wanted seafood (one gave up meat for Lent) to celebrate our common birth month, March. Despite having made reservations days earlier, the hostess stated there was a \"waitlist\". After clarification, she explained our reservations were still being honored. Thankfully the wait was minimal and we were still seated at our reservation time.   Our server was friendly. She didn't go into detail about the specials like others have in the past. We asked for a few minutes to look over the menu and she disappeared for quite awhile.   I ordered my usual: lobster chowder and bang bang shrimp as an entree. My chowder was smooth and rich as usual. It's a must-try in my opinion. Before I got halfway through it, my entree arrived. So I did have to rush and get it down. I wasn't leaving any of that for the dishwasher. I always get a side of jasmine rice with my bang bang shrimp. Tonight the portion was noticeably smaller which was okay because I was full.   Overall... an \"okay\" experience. Nothing horrible. Nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"This was our first time here and was wonderful. Kaylie was our waitress. She helped us make excellent choices when it came to ordering our appetizer (saucy shrimp, mmmmm). I had the tuna bowl and my hubby had the fish and chips. Both were excellent. I also ordered the raspberry martini which was delicious. We'll definitely come back and ask for Kaylie!!"}
{"text":"Visit the bar for happy hr every day from 4-6:30! Also bottomless mimosas and bellinis on Sunday for only $12!"}
{"text":"Bonefish Grill had been recommended to us by our new apartment manager. She did not steer us wrong.  The food was impeccable. My wife had the grilled trout and I had the Sir Will Fish and Chips; both were of an excellent quality and served in an attractive manner. The chocolate creme brulee for dessert was to die-for. Bonefish also has an extensive Martini menu. I had the raspberry martini which was both light and flavorful.  Our seater, server, and manager were all highly professional, courteous, and friendly, and genuinely made us feel that they were happy we were there. I am definitely recommending Bonefish Grill to my company as a venue for entertaining our visiting RVP's and clients. Thank you Bonefish for being a fantastic restaurant!"}
{"text":"...uh dropped a star since last time.  Wonder if I was just being kind since JC may have been watching since the last visit was for lent.  To be honest, the $90 total bill was not nearly worth the signature dishes (denoted by the starfish).  In fact, the only real reason why we came back was to exchange an audio interface at Guitar Center.  Otherwise, it's called Bonefish grill but lacks a wide variety of fish dishes, what gives.  The two and a half stars (rounded up) equates to a meal that you can make at home imo.  Good thing is that there are tons of options around if you are looking for the upscale chain (Texas d Brazil, Yardhouse, etc.)."}
{"text":"My new number 1!  Hubby took me here for my birthday and I absolutely loved it!!!  We had 5pm reservations, but showed up early.  They had us seated in seconds!  The waitress was very informative and had wonderful suggestions.  She never showed impatience with us at our slow decisions and when she discovered it was my birthday, she rummaged and found a candle to place on my dessert!  I LOVE HER!  The food was immaculate.  I can't say enough great things about this place.  All I can say is BANG-BANG Shrimp!!"}
{"text":"Yay!  The return of Bonefish Grill to LV/NV on March 18th at its new location:  6527 Las Vegas Blvd. South  Las Vegas, NV 89119 Phone: (702) 277-9876"}
{"text":"Omg. It's rare that I give five stars, but this place deserves it. The food was so good that my mother asked if she could meet the chef.  I got a sirloin with a lobster tail,  mashed potatoes,  and broccoli. My mom had the stuffed shrimp with mashed potatoes, and spinach.  My daughter had a lobster tail with spinach and potatoes au gratin.  We all loved our food.  It was seasoned well and tasted great.  The service was excellent, the parking was good, and the bathroom was clean.  This place is a must."}
{"text":"My husband and I went for the first time on a Thursday evening to celebrate my birthday. I really appreciated the decor and ambience - it felt tasteful and warm, using fabrics, wood, etc. to keep the noise level down. (I am so over the extremely loud warehouse style with all the noise ricocheting off the hard surfaces.)  We were immediately greeted and seated. The restaurant appeared about half-full. Our server was quickly at our table bringing water and menus.  While hubby's water glass was slow to be filled, the service was good.  I ordered the Bang Bang Shrimp appetizer, which arrived quickly and was very yummy! I was quite thrilled with the crisp texture of the shrimp and spicy sauce.  I had the fresh wild rockfish, thermidor-style, with mashed potatoes and steamed zucchini.  The rockfish was perfectly cooked, moist, with good texture. The sauce was a little bit too salty.  I was a little disconcerted by the four 2-inch long bones I found in my first fillet. Admittedly, our server only stopped by once but the manager was roaming the dining room and stopped at our table. When my husband pointed out the bones, she was quite insistent on bringing me new meal. I was a bit reluctant as I was already halfway through my meal but she insisted. The second meal arrived quite quickly. She also insisted on giving my husband a dessert so I would not be the only person at the table with the plate. (He tends to eat quite quickly and had already finished his meal.)  Hubby had a hamburger, plain with cheese only and fries.  Sigh...  The fries were fresh potato chips and he really liked them. He said the hamburger was just okay. (Fuddruckers is his favorite.) and although our server didn't ask how he would like it cooked, it was medium, just the way he likes it.  The crème brûlée was wonderful, as well as my complementary coconut pie with rum sauce.  The portions were just right, not huge nor lacking.  They happily accepted our $10 coupon that we found online. We will definitely recommend BFG to our friends and return ourselves."}
{"text":"We had a really disappointing experience at this restaurant. Our waiter was nice but was really pushing drinks and appetizers. Once we placed our order we didn't see much of him. Our food took a while to come out and when it did my salmon was dry and overcooked. I consider this inexcusable for a seafood restaurant. You should know how to cook salmon properly. When I told the waiter he said I should've mentioned it sooner. When the host came by at the end of our meal and asked \"how was everything?\" I told him that the salmon was dry. He said that is normal for Norwegian salmon. When I got home I looked it up and interestingly, there's really no such thing as Norwegian salmon. Which makes me wonder what fish they're serving. If the service had been better I could give this 2 or 3 stars but that and the disappointing food give no other option but a 1. I will not return and I don't recommend this place."}
{"text":"Jackie, our server was amazing. She was very attentive and knew just what we should get when we had questions. The for was delicious. The red snapper special was amazing, the pot stickers were so good. It was our first time eating here and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I love this place! I've visited a couple times with my husband and then with my sister and recently took my mom. Every time I enjoyed my meal. Service has always been good. I think the place is nicely decorated unlike a previous reviewer's thoughts.   Bang bang shrimp is the best. Had the tacos too which was awesome. The last time I went I had the truffle Mac and cheese and have to say it was 1 of the best I've ever had.  we will be continuing to come back and try more things!"}
{"text":"Staff deserves five stars but the silly revolving door is a menace to wheelchairs.  Good fish and steak from a wood-fired oven.  Too dark to read the menu- lots of people used the flashlight features on their iPhones to order. Very busy on a Friday night. Very busy."}
{"text":"It's called Bonefish but going by the chef, his food and his attitude it should be called BoneHead. He is clearly a jackass and won't care for anyone's dietary needs. It's besides the point that he serves shitty food that's directly off his menu.  Sorry blokehead bonehead chef. You can shutdown soon into the future."}
{"text":"Arrived at restaurant at 6:05 and was not approached for 30 minutes and only got service after flagging a person down.  Sat in the bar and tons of expeditors were serving others, but no waitstaff.  When our server finally came we asked about happy hour drink specials we were told $1 drafts, $3.50 house wines and half off well drinks.  When we received the bill it was not as she had stated, she said it was $1 off drafts. We both heard her and that is not what she said.  Also on website, Wednesday night is Bang Bang night and Bang Bang Shrimp supposed to be $6. That's why we went on a Wednesday, and.we made sure to look up the location on Tatum for that very reason.  When we got the bill, the Bang Bang shrimp was $10.50, and when we asked the manager, he said that this location didn't honor that.  Lastly, the food was not up to par.  We have eaten at Bonefish Grill in Ohio numerous times and always had good Bang Bang Shrimp and great service.  The shrimp was chewy and not as flavorful, we couldn't even finish it.  Mac & Cheese bites were not good and we only ate 2 of them.   We were so disappointed as we were excited to hear of the grand opening and had planned on bring friends.  Will not be back or recommending it to others."}
{"text":"I'm new to Phoenix but was stoked when I found out about Bonefish here! I came on Sunday and it was pretty quiet. I sat at the bar and the bartender was super nice and knowledgeable about everything. I ordered a cucumber martini in this cool ice cup, the Bang Bang shrimp and the Ahi Tuna and it was great. Consistent quality to the Bonefish's I've been to before. The only reason they didn't get a 5 star is because there wasn't anyone at the hostess table so I kind of just maneuvered myself to the bar. One of the best things about Bonefish is their service and it doesn't matter which location I've gone too there's always someone there to greet you and open the door. I've been told this is a new location so I'm sure they're just trying to get adjusted to everything but if you've never tried this place before I would def recommend. For dinner, I get the Lily's Salmon (on the menu it's Lily's Chicken but you can have them use the same toppings for the Salmon), The Tilapia Emperial or the Chilean Sea Bass."}
{"text":"Won't be returning to this version of the Bonefish chain.  We arrived for an early dinner so the restaurant was not crowded.  Our waiter was polite but clueless; a little too cute relying on \"charm\" rather than professional service  (AND he was teaching a trainee.)   The wedge salad had to be returned on account of the lettuce being brown and spoiled. It was replaced with a better one, but that didn't alter a bad start. The bread came late. I never received my soft drink ordered at the start and when I noted this to the server, he expressed surprise at the \"bar\", (having never checked I guess he would be surprised. ) I had to ask the trainee to refill our water which he did promptly and politely.    My entree came dripping off the side of my long white plate with an empty full half of the plate looking forlorn. The scallops were mediocre and the risotto was space and underwhelming. Remember,  this was the BEGINNING of the dining hours!  Clearly there is a problem with kitchen management as well as the wait staff department.  (BTW, the greeting host was also a dead loss, having neither \"greeting\" nor \"hosting\" abilities. )"}
{"text":"My husband and I visited this lovely restaurant during a business trip from California to Madison, WI. My husband and been there the day before with his clients and struck up a conversation with owner and head chef, Rod Ladson. He came back telling me what about the great food and what a great guy Rod was and that he had made reservations to bring me there. When we arrived, we were greeted very warmly by the hostess, who seated us promptly. Rod was sitting in one of the booths talking to some co-workers when we walked in and also greeted us with a big smile. My husband introduced us and Rod spent a few minutes talking with us and treating us like we were family. I noticed that he did this with other patron's that were there as well (even though he had an injury and was getting around on a scooter-type device), letting me know that this guy genuinely cares about his guests.  We exchanged conversation and pleasantries with Rod a few more times during our lunch as well as with our waitress, who was very lovely and sweet, and another server who my husband had met the day before. Everyone was gracious, friendly and made us feel like we were at home. On top of all that, the food was incredible. I had a creamy risotto with scallops and shrimp; while my husband had a beautiful salmon with mashed potatoes and green beans. Sounds basic, but it was anything but. I mean absolutely delicious. For desert we shared the best Key Lime pie I have ever eaten in my life. Chef Rod said a good Key Lime should make you pucker, and we puckered all the way to the end, almost licking the plate clean. We also ordered the Molten Chocolate Lava cake, but were to full to finish it. Can you say midnight snack :) This was definitely a wonderful experience and I can't wait to come back to beautiful Wisconsin and dine with Chef Rod and his wonderful staff. He is our new best friend!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for the first time on valentines day. We were really surprised on how slow business was for the type of holiday. Anyways, we were seated immediately and given our drinks just as fast. Unfortunately it took us a long time to decide what we wanted to eat because for a \"fish place\" there wasn't very much of it on the menu. We ordered the fried lobster dumplings which were amazing! My boyfriend ordered the steak with mashed potatoes and steamed veggies. I opted for the crab cakes with their seasonal side of chick peas and a side salad. I got my salad and honestly even for a side salad it was extremely small. I have been in the restaurant business for over 6 years. I know that a salad is one of the least expensive things on the menu to produce. But despite this dirt cheap food cost I got about a one ounce portion of salad. Despite this I really looked forward to the entree that I had ordered. Entrees arrive at the table and my boyfriends plate looks delicious! But my plate..... Not so much. I was surprised to receive two \"baby handful size\" of crab cake mix piles and a side of chickpeas bigger then both the handfuls of crab cakes, but not by much!!!!! I should have taken pictures of my meal, Bonefish would have been embarrassed! I was starved when we got there and left hungry after our meal. I know what people are thinking. That I'm used to the over-sized portions that the culture of America has made standard in the restaurant industry. However, that is simply not the case and had I thought to take pictures those would have proven my point. Bonefish grill is not worth the money. If a chain restaurant is what you are looking for, there are better ones for the money you will spend here. And at least you won't leave hungry!"}
{"text":"I didn't know what to expect from a chain restaurant, but I was thoroughly impressed. Went last night with my friend because I was craving fish. I wanted a lighter meal because it was getting late, 8:30 to be exact so I didn't get to try as many items as I might on another, hungrier occasion. Meal is started with some freshly baked bread and a nice herb olive oil for dipping, it was so very delicious. I had to ask for seconds, which I never do with bread. Decided to skip appetizers and just settled on a simple grilled salmon with the tomato basil garlic sauce...it was outstanding! Fish was perfectly cooked at my requested temperature of medium. Was disappointed that the seasonal vegetable selection was actually couscous, but I settled on that and a small mixed green salad, both were very flavorful. My dining companion had the lobster grilled cheese and it was outstanding. It is served with a nice creamy lobster bisque and mixed greens as well. Service was also spot on with drink refills being provided without me requesting them. Will definitely be back to try other items. The ahi tuna looked like a wonderful option as did their lobster mac and cheese."}
{"text":"I had never heard of Bonefish before but was given a $25 gift card so why not try it out? The good definitely outweighed the bad here. To be honest, the only thing that I disliked was the price point.   First of all, the service was GREAT. We barely noticed that the drinks and food were coming out slowly because our server was so helpful and attentive. We even took a while to decide on what to get and he never rushed us.   The drinks were pretty delicious and a good amount for the price. We had the grapefruit margarita, a sangria (I don't remember which one), and a white cranberry cosmo. The cosmo was too strong for my friend's taste so our server kindly brought us white cranberry juice to mix.   I won't bore you with every single detail of the food. Let's just say that you definitely need to get the bang bang shrimp. So worth it. The highlight of the food for me was that their portion sizes were perfect (read: not 10 servings on one plate) and the seafood was cooked amazingly as well. It's easy to overcook seafood but everything was tender and of good quality (firm, turgid meat).   The price is a little steep but I think we were just unprepared for the epicness so my friends and I will definitely return once we're ballin'. You do get what you pay for.   -1 star because my boyfriend got sick right after eating there. (He's still excited to go back anyway.)"}
{"text":"Nice place to eat fish... Rainbow trout was excellent, coleslaw... well not as sweet as expected, donuts were tasty! Don't forget to try apple martini with spices."}
{"text":"Went for happy hour with my folks. The drinks were delicious and the strawberry spinach salad was to die for!"}
{"text":"Every time I go to Bonefish, I am so impressed! This is the first one my husband and I have been to since we moved to Pittsburgh from Southern Maryland. It was excellent as always! Our server was just about the friendliest person ever and she really knew what she was talking about. She recommended the Chilean Sea Bass, and I decided to try it. It was absolutely phenomenal! Cooked perfectly, seasoned perfectly, and just simply melted in my mouth! My husband got the Atlantic Salmon and it was equally as good! The drinks are always great too...I got the ultimate martini - which lives up to it's name! Overall, we had yet another great experience at Bonefish! It's good to have a restaurant where you can always rely on them to give you excellent food and service :)"}
{"text":"This is one of my new favorite restaurants.  The food is very good.  The service is very good.  I would recommend this as a very nice date destination.  I would also recommend taking a family or group of friends.    Good Food---Good Service---Good Prices"}
{"text":"Always a wonderful and delish experience..the bang bang shrimp..to die for!!!  The clam corn chowder is the best i have ever had.  I love the atmosphere and the fact that Ralph, the managing partner, always comes around to greet each table.   He is ever present and insures that we as well as other diners have the best meal.  We try and visit 3 or 4 times a month.  Give it a try..you will be very pleased with the freshness, quality, and for seafood, reasonably priced....luv this place."}
{"text":"Oh my, best meal I've had in Vegas. Recommend.  Service, attitude, meal awesome.  Carlos, your fabulous."}
{"text":"Another great Tuesday lobster night.  I think I am getting hooked on the ahi tuna as well.  We ate at the bar and the bartender couldn't have been sweeter.  For dinner, we each ordered the lobster specials, as well as the ahi tuna.  Perfect portions and a great way to spend a Tuesday night!  Only one drawback:  the butter served with the lobster isn't clarified, but for the price, who cares??"}
{"text":"I've been to bonefish grill before back east and didn't care for it, thought we'd give it a try out here.   Had a reservation for Valentine's Day, we were 10 minutes early and they refused to seat us until 6, even though the table was ready.  Service sucked. Offered bread that never came. Waitress never came to check on us and we needed more martinis and water.   Food sucked just as before, wasn't worth the price."}
{"text":"I LOVE their Sunday brunch items! Their brioche french toast is amazingly good. I really like their fish tacos also, the mango salsa in it makes it special. Their creme brulee might be one of the best I've had, I love the berries on it."}
{"text":"Gr8 seafood restaurant w/nice recipes, fresh fish, superior service and nice ambience.  Presentation of my haddock dish and my girl friend's scampi dish made our mouths water.  Suggest reservations on weekend and parking can be a challenge.  Bread and pesto dip is a must.  Gr8 non-fish options available."}
{"text":"I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE their Chilean Sea Bass.  It was so buttery and melted in my mouth.  Has made it my favorite fish dish for sure. I loved the au gratin potatoes and veggies as the side dishes and the crème brulee was a good choice too.  Definitely returning :)"}
{"text":"Martinis ocean tropic trust, pineapple and the watermelon were all fantabulous and well worth the price i suggest folks venture out and try these martinis"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this restaurant more stars. The food was fantastic. My mother got sashimi and I got the fish and chips and everything was great. Sadly our waiter was not... Our service was absolutely terrible. While he was friendly he was far from fast. It was about 15 minutes after ordering to get our drinks, a water and a diet coke. It was another at least 20 minutes to get him to order our food, probably a half an hour to get a refill, and at least 45 minutes to get our food. And after we finished eating it was another 20 minutes to get the check. I'd be willing to go back for the food but the service was so awful I still wouldn't commit to it."}
{"text":"Visited here with a large group celebrating a friend's birthday.  The menu is quite large and has a lot of options but nothing too exciting. I ordered the Bang Bang shrimp as an appetizer to share and they were delicious albeit very unhealthy.  As an entree I ordered the Cobb salad but substituted shrimp for chicken. The base of the salad was very bland, romaine lettuce that consisted of mostly white and crunchy pieces.  The dressing was nice but maybe a little too much as the salad got soggy quite fast.  The shrimp was chewy and tasteless- nothing like the bang bang shrimp and lastly they forgot to add the blue cheese.  So, overall, don't get the salad.   Some of my friends have extreme allergies and found this restaurant to be less than ideal for their needs. The waiters weren't very aware of the items that may contain nuts or other allergens and had to ask the kitchen multiple times. The bread, for example, contained peanut oil which was a surprise.  My boyfriend ordered fish tacos and was surprised when they had pesto on them (was not listed on the menu) and as he is allergic to nuts he had to send them back.  I would not come back. Very below average food and bad service."}
{"text":"Catherine was the best!! She was super attentive to us, made sure we didn't need anything and didn't rush us at all. The food was amazing and the drinks just as awesome. It's a great place for brunch the atmosphere is super chill and it's perfect for a lazy Sunday type of outing. The prices are reasonable and good quality everything. I will most definitely be returning to this restaurant when I'm in the mood for a nice brunch and delicious mimosa :) thank you so much to the Bonefish grill staff for a great experience you're all awesome!"}
{"text":"My aunt regularly sends the Boodle and me giftcards to various restaurants, and we have actually saved up TWO $25 giftcards for Bonefish. We went on Friday night to do something different. We were trying to get the most with our giftcards, and I think we did a good job. I ordered the Pomegranate Martini that was good (it was a little too sweet but I enjoyed it), and Boodle ordered Legion's Juicy Jay.   We decided to split one of the salad entrees (the Cobb Salad) with chicken and we also ordered two appetizers - the edamame and crab cakes. The salad entree, even split in half, was plenty of food for us after the two apps. The salad was great -- lettuce was fresh, the grilled chicken was hot and had good flavor. The edamame was also excellent. I appreciate that it wasn't salted. Sometimes I find that edamame is too salty, and I enjoyed being able to to salt my own. The crab cakes weren't quite what I was expecting, but they tasted good. It was less of a cake more of just crab meet cooked into a circular shape. Like I was said, they tasted great but were missing that cakey texture and shape.   Parking at this location is plentiful and our service was excellent!"}
{"text":"First off want to give a shout out to Pamela our waitress she was awesome!!! My GF had the crab fried rice and fish tacos I had fish and chips food was amazing. I suggest people give this place a try I will be going back soon."}
{"text":"I have been anticipating the opening of Bonefish Grille for months.  We went for dinner Friday night around 7pm.  We expected a wait and were told it would be 50 minutes.  Luckily we found open seats in the lounge area where they offer both a bar menu and the full dinner menu.  Score!    I ordered ceviche and a cup of lobster bisque, while my husband had lamb lollipops and bang bang shrimp tacos.  The ceviche was fresh and topped with a wonderful guacamole.  The velvety bisque disappeared way too quickly due to the tiny portion.  The lamb presented beautifully, but lacked flavor.  And the tacos were SO small that they looked ridiculous in my husband's hand.  He finished each taco in two bites.  I guess the chefs know their portions are small because the meal is supplemented with the most delicious bread.  Be sure to say YES if they offer it to you.  $64 plus tip for three appetizers, one entree, and two cocktails seems pretty steep.  If you factor in the service which was sloooooow and inattentive, you may feel like you were ripped off.  I am hopeful that Bonefish will work out the kinks so I will come back again in a few months to see how they are doing."}
{"text":"Had an absolutely delicious anniversary dinner!! && FYI Bang Bang Shrimp Appetizer is a must!!"}
{"text":"Took Mother-n-law here for MOTHERS DAY Brunch on Sunday May 11th and she had eaten here before and was my husband & I's first experience.  We all three had the EGGS BENEDICT selection and while there were a few problems, quickly taken care of by Andy our server and bartender.  Must say Andy was the best that I have experienced in my 30 years in Las Vegas.  One of the most attentive servers ever.  He must be recognized for his prompt friendly service and making our experience the best.  We definitely will be back.  Great atmosphere and friendly staff  Marcus the manager was fantastic...THANK YOU MARCUS, ANDY & KARI."}
{"text":"This is not the first time we've eaten here, in fact I begged my husband to go back!  The food here was incredible! But the staff (bartender included) can certainly use some customer service training. Especially when your customer asks for clarified butter.  The absolute wrong approach is to explain to them that they don't know what they are asking for.  The right approach is to make it happen, even if you don't \"normally serve clarified butter with lobster\" (which makes no sense). Thankfully the manager did make to situation right.  We'll give this place another shot after the sting wears off a bit."}
{"text":"Had dinner here and overall it was pretty average, nothing amazing which is a shame as it's pretty pricey food. The service was excellent though!"}
{"text":"Bonefish has a very nice selection of seafood dishes.  The complimentary bread was super warm and fresh.  Both of our meals were very good, and were served in quick fashion.  Dan had the cod fish fry and I had grilled shrimp and scallops. Lots of delicious side choices to select from.  I do recommend the Herb Pesto sauce to go with any grilled seafood.....yum!  Our server was courteous, kind and attentive, can't ask for more.  Be sure to make a reservation, as it definitely fits up for dinner."}
{"text":"Ok, maybe we r spoiled...Food is ok not great.  We drive by here a lot and thought well let's try it and I do not think we will come back.  Coconut shrimp app is very good along with the bang bang shrimp.  Dinner portions were small and disappointing in flavor.  When we all tasted our food the response was the same....a shoulder shrug and ehhhhh it is ok.  All around no one thought it was great.  Fish and chips....fish fell out of batter..... cod just nothing really stands out about it - lots of carrots on it.  Potatoes au gratin taste horrible taste like they are frozen TV dinner potatoes.  Teriyaki chicken again nothing to write home about. The waiter was nice enough, but slow... we didn't order any drinks and no dessert. Sorry hiys"}
{"text":"Went to bonefish grill and I believe Wallace served us.  We did the 2 for $55, and started with the bang bang shrimp. I got the seasonal swordfish with pumpkin ravioli and spinach, and the wife ordered the salmon.  We finished with the brownie.  All items were delicious, and we loved the service. I don't usually do seafood, so I was thoroughly surprised and glad our food was suggested by our waiter."}
{"text":"I want to love this place.   Some really great people work here but unfortunately they can't get an order right. My GF had made specific requests and after the food arrived, we asked about it because the food didn't look right, we were then told the way we asked for it was not possible or \"would take a while\".   Drinks are good. Approachable feel.   $115 mistake. Ill take some responsibility for not being more clear or not refusing the food when it was brought to me, but I don't like being an asshole."}
{"text":"Great food and service.  Sea Bass was excellent.  We also had fish and chips also excellent.  We will be back for another dinner here!"}
{"text":"Ever since we first saw the signs for Bonefish Grill a few months back, we've been eagerly anticipating the opening. Bonefish Grill is one of the few chains I will look forward going to, as they are a cut above the other seafood chains (I'm looking at you, Red Lobster and McCormick). So today we headed down after work and got on line to wait (no reservations were available for tonight.) We were told it would be a 45 minute wait, and we were buzzed in after about a half hour.  With it being the opening week, the place was hopping. You can expect a few things from a brand-new, chain-run restaurant...long waits, unknowledgeable servers, inexperienced chefs, and more. I'm happy to say that aside from the wait to get in, everything else was fairly good. Right off the bat my ears were assaulted by blaring music being pumped in through speakers, and I will never understand why restaurants think people would rather listen to this stuff instead of talking with their party. We were seated at a high top table near the bar (but not considered bar seating) and our waitress came over after a couple of minutes and took our drink orders. The miss' had a question about one of the wines and we had to wait about five minutes for the waitress to get an answer and report back, but at least she made the effort instead of giving us a guestimate. The wine was moderately priced, and I was able to snag a glass of Reisling for $6.90 (I've paid $8-9 for a similar glass at other restaurants.)  For an appetizer we went with the signature appetizer, Bang Bang Shrimp ($9.30). If someone was to say the signature app was fried shrimp, most people (including me) would simply say \"meh.\" But these Bang Bang Shrimp are pure bangin'! The single order came with twenty shrimps all piled on a bed of lettuce. These bad boys ain't your everyday fried shrimp though. First the shrimp themselves...they are small and bite-sized, and ridiculously tender. They are not greasy or super-duper battered, but lightly battered and served with this amazing spicy sauce. If you've never had it before, the Bang Bang Shrimp is a must-have appetizer. It really sets the stage for the meal you will eat later.  Our waitress brought out our bread after we polished off our shrimp. It's plain ol' Italian-style bread, but it came out piping hot and fresh, and that makes a huge difference. They also give you a pesto-olive oil dip rather than plain butter which makes a world of difference. I'll take oil over butter for my bread any day, and I'm doubly down with that when they put that wonderful pesto in there.  For dinner I ordered the small portion of the Chilean Sea Bass ($23.30) along with a mango salsa. The bass was cooked perfectly and it came apart in big, meaty chunks...it didn't just disentergrate into fish flakes on my plate. It had a great flavor to it that was only enhanced by the mango salsa which gave it a bit of heat and sweet between the fruit, peppers and cilantro. For my \"starch\" I opted for the au gratin potatoes which were hands down, 100% TASTETACULAR! It's more like a casserole, and had this wonderfully crunchy topping that made it one of the better potato sides I've had out. The dish also came with seasoned veggies (mostly zucchini and squash) and they were cooked perfectly and were still a bit crisp and firm, not nasty and mushy.  The miss' ordered the day's salmon special called Lily's Salmon ($15.90) that was a salmon filet topped with goat cheese and spinach. This was definitely some of the better salmon I've ever tried, and the goat cheese also enhanced the fish. I avoided the spinach, but the miss' enjoyed combining all three ingredients into one tasty bite. Her dinner came with the mashed potatoes as a side and they were also pretty good...light, fluffy and creamy!  I expected some hangups having gone opening week, and was pleasantly surprised with the great experience we had. Sure, things were slow and the waitress might have been a bit off, but it the place just opened! I know the waitress was overwhelmed between the volume of customers that had to be served and having to learn everything she had to, so I'm not complaining about that. What's more important was the fact that the food was spot-on. Everything came out hot, fresh and delicious, and for me that's the biggest factor. The servers will learn the menu and be able to sell it in time, but the fact that the kitchen staff were able to deliver such great food so quickly is key. I definitely see Bonefish Grill becoming one of our favorite restaurants in the Huntersville area.I can't wait to go back after the grand opening hype has died down and the staff has some experience under their belts. But who can wait that long for Bang Bang Shrimp?! GO NOW, AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food. .shrimp and scallops were seasoned lightly but well. Steaks are great cuts and the au gratin potatoes are like a good Mac n cheese and loved  the  cucumber margarita . Definitely come back. And Mandy at the bar was great and helpful ! Soft opening success!  Corn and peas as the side were weak but everything else was top notch ."}
{"text":"Overpriced Americanized \"pan Asian\" food for the Asian dishes.  The environment was very pleasant and the wait staff was very friendly.  Was just not excited about the food there..."}
{"text":"The highlights of our dinner include service, restaurant set up and fresh, seasonal menu choices. I appreciate the accommodating staff. We were received well and everyone was helpful from the welcome to table service. The large booths, butcher paper covered tables and activity books with crayons made our seating comfortable. A Family restroom is an amenity and it  includes a stainless steel changing table. Dinner for us included grilled tuna with steamed broccoli and asparagus. Spaghetti squash was available as a seasonal vegetable. Although none of the menu items were ORGANIC, ask about sustainability and local foods. The salmon is wild caught. Bonefish Grill was perfect for kid-friendly dining in Las Vegas and a family fun evening."}
{"text":"Horrible experience on a Monday night. Came with my family for our last dinner of the holidays. The food was excellent, always is, but the quality of service was horrible.   For starters, they didn't honor our reservation and made us wait 30 mins to be seated while others who arrived after us were seated before. After that it was just slow service - mainly the kitchen/bar at fault, often with our table being served after other tables that were seated after us.   The final insult was the table next to us receiving a complimentary desert to apologize for the slow service, yet we weren't comped anything.  Full timeline is as follows:  6:15 - reservation 6:45 - seated 7:00 - drinks served  7:10 - bread came to the table 7:25 - soup arrives 7:50 - food arrives after the table next to us was served first 8:15 - table next to us receives a complimentary dessert for slow service, despite being seated at 7:00 8:25 - bill comes 8:35 - out the door"}
{"text":"Great waiter (Scott). Food is delicious. Manager (Marcus) is very personable"}
{"text":"From when you first arrive to when you pay the check, the experience at Bonefish Grill was delectable. The staff was very attentive, making sure we had what we needed and providing great recommendations.   Bonefish grill has a fully stocked bar. We had dirty martinis, beer, wine, jack and coke and even a fuzzy navel.   All the food was superb, including the bread they first serve you, the Mussles Josephine appetizer to the fish, lobster and filet mignon.   I personally ordered the ahi tuna steak topped with the mango salsa a side of string beans and truffle Mac & Cheese.  The tuna was cooked perfectly and the mango salsa was fresh and sweet. The string beans were crunchy and perfectly seasoned and the truffle Mac & Cheese was creamy and delicious. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"My best friend had her birthday brunch here and honestly the service was terrible. We brunch a lot and this experience was subpar. A couple of my friends were vegan and vegetarian and they were told they could not order off the pre made menu. I just feel they could have been more considerate when it comes to dietary restrictions. Also after 2 hours we received a total of 2 mimosas when it's \"bottomless\". I feel if you can't sustain the resources to maintain a bottomless mimosa brunch you should not advertise this. Also based on the \"contract\" that my friend had that she wasn't aware of we were forced to have one check for 20+ people."}
{"text":"Update for Sunday Brunch. Rolled in around 10:30am shortly after they opened, and there were only 3 ladies inside at a table. You know what that means......fast and efficient service. My waiter Mike was great. Ordered the Cream Brulee French Toast that comes with two slices of applewood smoked bacon, and strawberries with whipped cream. The french toast was delicious with a hint of vanilla and the crunchy sugar coating. I only drank iced tea because of my semi-hangover, but they have unlimited mimosas and other cocktails available for a good price.   I think they do a nice brunch here, I'm surprised it was a little slow. A couple large groups came in while I was dining. Give it a try and see if you can find something good for breakfast. I'm thinking bang bang shrimp benedict next time."}
{"text":"Wow what a great experience! I've never been to a Bonefish Grill before, but I will definitely be back.   My fiancé, his parents, and I went for my early birthday lunch. Our waitress, Hailey (yes, named after the comet) was so sweet and very helpful. We ordered the Bang Bang Shrimp, and I totally understand why it's so popular. You get a lot of bang for your buck. (Um, if that's not the slogan, it should be)   My fiancé and I got the fish tacos and the shrimp tacos. Both were delicious! The future in-laws got some special they had and they seemed happy too!  The kicker was when the manager came out at the end of our meal and gave me a birthday card and some homemade chocolate, thanking me for coming to their restaurant to celebrate my birthday. Wow, if service is consistent like that, I will be back !  Thank you to Hailey and the Birkdale Bonefish manager for a wonderful birthday celebration."}
{"text":"Let me first say, if you haven't visited Bonefish Grill yet, do so immediately!  Chef Rod Ladson makes this place great!! He hand delivered food, personally made sure everything tasted well and even made suggestions that weren't offered to us by our waiter. Definitely more than just a chef and the reason why I will continue to come back! I especially appreciate how attentive he was to all the dining customers, explaining ingredients...etc. He even helped suggest the perfect foods for my very picky toddler!  It was a very awesome experience! Oh yeah, and the Bang Bang Shrimp is to die for!"}
{"text":"You have to really screw up to not impress me. My first time here I came in for my lunch break and had the lunch combo with blackened fish tacos and a caesar salad. Both were terrific! Jenny was a great server and the restaurant was very clean. I'll come back again and bring the boss with me!"}
{"text":"Excellent fish and surf and turf!  Bang Bang Shrimp appetizer is a must have.   Salads are fresh, crisp and have nice ingredients with lots of flavor.   Gets super busy on Friday and Saturday nights so reservations are a must.   We have been a few times and have never left disappointed but expect to pay north of $120 for a nice dinner for two with appetizer, drinks and Tip."}
{"text":"My wife and I went with our parents a few weeks ago. By far the best fish I have ever had! Between the 6 of us we had a lot of their dinner specials, they were all excellent. I tried their watermelon martini it was amazing. My wife and I agreed their drinks were so good we would go back just for a drink sometime."}
{"text":"Not worth the price. Took family here for wife's birthday. Bang Bang shrimp was fine but could have had better food at Shomars at much better price. Fish tacos tasted \"super fishy\" and had bones. Tried popcorn shrimp from kids meal and it was near inedible. Wife liked her shrimp & scallops, but the rest was average or below. Bill was over $100 for 3 kids and 4 adults. Nothing but water and 3 meals were kids meals. I wouldn't have minded the amount if the meals had been of higher quality."}
{"text":"Starting it with a chocolate martini! And I had two of them, all while waiting on my sisters to arrive for their birthday. I love eating here with them because they always order Bang Bang Shrimp for an appetizer. Not only is the shrimp yummy but so is the garnish it sits on, it's like a mini salad. The Corn and Crab Chowder is my ultimate favorite. Sometimes I get a bowl as a meal and dip the bread in it, yummy. This time I had the Chilean Sea bass blackened with a side of lemon butter sauce served with mash potatoes and veggies, of course I added the soup also. This was my first time having this expensive fish and it was delicious. I am a salmon fan myself but keep seeing this fish on TV. The wait staff, manager, and bar staff were very professional yet friendly and warm. I felt very welcome to be there and will for sure be back."}
{"text":"I love Bonefish. I usually eat steak as my main course when I go there, and they make it exactly how I ask for it (Very well-done - don't judge me). The Calamari is always delicious and the scallops are just...insanely perfect. The service is top-notch and on point. I can't rave enough about Bonefish. I had the berry bread pudding for dessert for the first time, I may go back just for that."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night with the family.  Everything was excellent.  We ordered bang bang shrimp for an appetizer.  Even my 9 year old was eating them with chopsticks that were delivered with the dish.  Crunchy exterior with tender interior.  Tossed in a somewhat spicy cream sauce on a bed of lettuce.  It is the perfect amount for the 4 of us to share.  The raspberry iced tea was not to potent, yet not underdone either.  I must have drank 3 or 4 glasses of the stuff.  I ordered Misoyaki Sea Bass off the special menu.  It was grilled over oak, then topped with misoyaki marinade & pickle ginger relish, on a bed of sautéed spinach, mushrooms, and jasmine rice.  The Sea Bass was cooked perfectly.  Each time I pulled it with a fork it fell apart.  Was firm and tender and tasted wonderful.  The spinach and mushrooms added an earthy compliment to the fish.  The rice also cooked to perfection soaked up the sauce and was a pleasure to eat.  Overall, our service was outstanding.  Food was outstanding.  I'd eat here again anytime."}
{"text":"This isn't the cheapest place to eat but, if you have a special occasion, it's wonderful. The food simply melts in your mouth and everything we had was worth the trip, friendly service and warm atmosphere. And, it is located in Town Square where you can walk around and shop before you dine. Who want's to take me back for my birthday, lol  Loved it!"}
{"text":"Have to say this place was AMAZING! The food was to die for. Both hubby and I had the sea bass it melted in our mouths. The drinks were spot on! You have to try the winter cosmo trust me you will love it. Only reason they got four stars instead of five was the chef coats. My husband is a chef and to be honest no server should be in a chef coat. Those coats are earned not just worn. And to those in on the business it can be an insult. But other than that this place is a must vist. We will be back.  Btw shout out to our waiter jason he rocked!"}
{"text":"Es la primera vez que visito este lugar, mi esposo me dijo que era de mariscos aunque me imaginaba un menú más elaborado ya que soy de la costa de México, al final nada terminó por convencerme y termine pidiendo una bonefish Cobb salad estaba rica, también pedí Classic ice tea just a tap sweet.  El ambiente es agradable y la mesera muy atenta y amigable Muchas gracias."}
{"text":"My family and I came here for a quick dinner and ended up waiting at least an hour for our food, we're actually frequent diners here and this has never happened before. However Jake our server took excellent care of us and let us know that a member of the kitchen staff had walked out and that was the cause for the food delay. The manager Ryan took care of our food and we could not have been happier with the amazing customer service! I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"First impression, you walk in and can smell the fish immediately. It is not overpowering, but I have heard that even if it's a sushi or seafood restaurant, you should NOT be able to smell fish all around the dining area, however I am not an expert on that and it really did not bother me a great deal, I was there to eat fish anyway. Came for the Chilean Sea Bass, but they were out! At first I was pretty disappointed, but I ended up trying Rainbow Trout for the first time ever and I really liked it. As someone who is barely getting into eating fish, it was a great discovery to find that I don't always have to order THE MOST expensive type of fish every time I go to a seafood restaurant! We also got the bang bang shrimp since apparently it's the law to order it if you go here. It was good, not overly spicy. I wasn't blown away but it was worth trying.   Trout was great and had some nice char on it. Paired with the grilled lemon it was simple but tasty, which is how good food should be done. I got the whipped garlic mashed potato and steamed broccoli for sides. I did not care for the seasonings on the broccoli but it was mild enough that I finished them anyway. The mashed potatoes were good but almost too buttery (and I did NOT think that was ever even in the realm of possibility)  Overall good meal. Service was excellent!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Every time we have been here we have excellent service and the food is amazing. The only thing I ever had that I thought the portion was small was the french toast. It tasted good but not enough . The food is placed on your plate really nice and always looks so good when it comes out. The flavors are always wonderful.  I always order the lobster bisque soup no matter what. It is so good here.  For one of our lunches we ordered the hamburger. It has to be one of the best we have had in Vegas. You can taste the quality not some cheap greasy meat!! Its awesome! Another thing they serve before dinner is the bread. Oh wow me and my husband could not stop eating it. Its so good we could make a meal just out of that! lol Everything from the time you sit and eat to desserts are the best! It is almost like eating at a very expensive restaurant without the expensive prices!!  Usually we are too full to get desserts but this one time we had to try one our waitress recommended ~ it was the Crème brûlée oh wow it is THE BEST!!! So creamy and the flavors just burst in your mouth! You will savor every mouthful! This place is so good!!! If you get a chance to try we highly recommend it! You will fall in love with the service and the food!  This location was clean which is a plus!!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere of Bonefish Grill is quite and classy. This restaurant is targeting more of a special occasion or just a nice night out. The beer menu is slim, this is more of a wine/cocktail bar. The menu is actually small offering mostly entrees. The prices are higher than hour typical chain restaurant about $15-$30 meals. The food was okay, but nothing special. It's a chain style restaurant that is made to offer a more expensive feel with mediocre food. Also, most of the menu is seafood to steaks on the list."}
{"text":"This was my first visit and the Bang-Bang shrimp was awesome! Great martini, Pork chop and service!"}
{"text":"When you walk out of a restaurant after a $70.00 meal and say \"well, the bread was good\", it's usually not a good sign.   First of all the music that played throughout dinner was horrible. Terrible karaoke versions of songs by bands like America, The Eagles, and Melanie. (Melanie? Really?)   The mussels were not good at all, too much everything piled on top except mussels. The pumpkin ravioli was greasy, the ahi tuna drowning in sauce.  In a restaurant that had 190 people capacity there were only 6 of us in there and service was slow.  Anyway, I don't think we'll be back. I like Bonefish but I guess I'll wait until I get back to Nashville to eat there again.  Well, the bread was good."}
{"text":"visited Bonefish for the first time and can't understand any of the complaints. My friend and I had the bang bang shrimp appetizer (on special for $6) and we both enjoyed it. Bread was delicious, my stuffed tilapia was cooked to perfection and the potions were large. Our waitress Kelsey was very attentive, offered great suggestions and helped me out with a wine selection. We were both very pleased, I will be back. My friend left her credit card at the table and Kelsey even ran it out to us. Great waitress!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to the Bonefish Grill last night to celebrate his graduation. We made a reservation online, however when we arrived we were sat in the bar area and not the dining room... even though we had a reservation. Therefore, our server was the bartender who didn't come around to greet us or bring us water for about 20 minutes. It seemed like a semi busy night so we let it go. He eventually came over and we ordered a drink and the Bang Bang shrimp appetizer. The appetizer took another 20 minutes to come out, and BOY WAS IT DISAPPOINTING. I do not know how this is a signature menu item, in fact the thought of it makes me sick. Fried shrimp that is extremely overdressed with their overly creamy bang bang sauce. We then ordered our meal and sat there for 40 minutes without our server coming to check on us or to tell us that our food was on the way. In fact, several managers walked by us and never asked us how we were doing or reassured us that our food was coming. Honestly, we could have probably walked out without saying anything and no one would have even realized that we were gone. Our server, the bartender then returned to talk to us at 8:18 (mind you our reservation was made for 7:15) he told us he would check on our food. So we see him go to the kitchen and then he never came back to tell us anything about what he just went to check on, he just went back behind the bar and continued serving drinks. At this point my boyfriend and I were fed up, we just asked if we could pay for the appetizer and drinks because it was getting ridiculous by this point it is now 8:35, the appetizer was disgusting, and the service was extremely poor. Mind you, once again a manager never came over, she was hanging out with servers sipping on a coke and chatting. The bartender allowed us to leave without paying for anything even though we offered to pay for the drink and shrimp (that we didn't even eat because it was disgusting). No wonder this place has so many bad reviews!!! Businesses in Town Square often close when they are subpar, can't see this place being here in two years. Never again. ALSO - there are 3 other bad reviews just on this one day!!!! 05/13/18.. what horrible restaurant management."}
{"text":"Great new restaurant across from Paradise Valley Mall. Great service, excellent food and service for a great price.  The wine list is above average and well proved. My wife loves the non-alcoholic blackberry smash drink. The regular fish tacos are always excellent.  Overall, a go to place for consistently good weekday fare. And a good value."}
{"text":"My friend and I had dinner last night and it was great!! It is nice to find a place that serves such fresh and quality seafood!! Our server, Dionne, gave us impeccable service! The entire staff was friendly and you felt welcomed from the minute you stepped in until you left. The Manager came out and greeted us as well. It was just great! I had the George Banks scallops. My friend had the trout. They were both perfect. We have driven by numerous times, but the parking lot always looked full, so we thought that we'd never get in there. It was explained to us that the neighboring restaurants use their lot. So if you drive by, and don't have a reservation, don't be discouraged! Pop in and see if they have a table for you!"}
{"text":"Food is good but service is poor. Our server got one of my orders wrong, it took forever for our food to get to the table and after that the server didn't come back to check if everything was good until she gave us the bill."}
{"text":"A few days ago I had a very pleasant introduction to the Bonefish Grill while dining with Diane and friends, beginning with excellent complimentary freshly baked bread and butter, along with zesty Maryland Crab Cakes dipped in Red Remoulade Sauce.  These openers were soon followed by a good cup of Corn Chowder & Lump Crab Soup.  Next up for me was a Bonefish House Salad adorned with Pinenuts and Grape Tomatoes, and covered by a really good Citrus Vinaigrette Dressing.  And, to end on a high note I was presented with a moist and mouth-watering hunk of wood-grilled Chilean Sea Bass bathed in Lemon Butter Sauce and accompanied by really good Au Gratin Potatoes and very good Squash.  I ordered the large portion, which was more filling than it looked, and provided me with complete gustatory satisfaction.  Service by Krista H. was fine and responsive.  Diane quickly received requested Lemon Butter Sauce for her Parmesan Trout, and I was delivered more butter for the tasty bread.  4-1/2 stars overall!  I will surely be back!"}
{"text":"What a fantastic dinner experience! Our server was prompt and we never felt ignored.  The Bang Bang Shrimp appetizer was delicious! We also had the calamari which was good but not near as good as the shrimp.  For entrees we had Chilean Sea Bass with Asian sauce, spaghetti squash and steamed asparagus and another entree of filet mignon and Maryland crab cake with garlic mashed potatoes and spaghetti squash.  There isn't one bad word to say about anything we had.   Everything was hot, fresh and tasted amazing. We were all impressed with our dishes.  And dessert....holy crap was it good too.  Pumpkin Creme Brûlée, flourless brownie with raspberry sauce-ice cream & macadamia nuts and last but not least cinnamon sugar doughnuts with chocolate and sea salt caramel dipping sauces.    We cannot wait to come back again, one of the best first experiences we've ever had at a restaurant"}
{"text":"Very cold in restaurant. Had to move outside. Will finish review when we eat.  Turned out the staff was very accommodating and set a special table outside for us.  No longer freezing inside. To much AC.  Will review food after we eat.  Food was very good. Talipia with mango sauce, Carribien scallops and crab cakes were excellent."}
{"text":"Great food but the service is slow slow slow. I swear this one girl must be paying to work there, she needs a new career."}
{"text":"Went out for a Friday night dinner with family, and made a reservation for a large group. Bonefish gives a 15 minute window and they like to have most of the party to be seated. We ordered up glasses of wine, during happy hour and ordered two appetizers. The Thai Coconut Shrimp had a crispy, sweet outside and dipped in a sauce, I was lucky to even get a bite, they went so fast! And the Saucy Shrimp, placed on our end of the table, so I had more of this. Shrimp bathed in a lime tomato garlic sauce and olives, it was a great marriage of flavor.   The bread was fresh and warm, and that always is a hit with a large group of people. We ordered, and I kept hearing great things about this bang-bang shrimp, so I went with the tacos. Two soft shelled tacos, bang-bang spicy shrimp with lettuce and no sour cream. The tacos were creamy enough, and didn't need extra. I ordered a side salad and it was perfect., and not overly full. Our waitress was kind, and patient and made our dining experience very pleasant."}
{"text":"The bonefish grill is a chain and this location is as good as most locations. As the name suggests, this is a seafood heaven. That said, it is a bit heavy on your pocket. The lunch specials can be a reasonable value for money.   The bang bang shrimp is the best place to start. It can easily be the best starter that they have. My only gripe with it, is the amount of lettuce that goes into the bed the shrimp sit on. Way too much that no one eats since it isn't drizzled with any sauce or seasoning. The coconut shrimp can be considered as an alternative if you want something less spicy. However, with only six on the plate - it gets over even before it starts   The fish and chips are nice but a little too oily for my taste. It came with three battered pieces. By the second piece I was removing the batter. By the third piece I gave up and left most of it.   I normally stay clear of salads and prefer meats. However, their spinach salad (even offered as a side with your main) has me scraping the plate for every last piece.   Overall - this is an upscale restaurant (black napkins embossed with the bonefish logo) with upscale prices. Worth your time with your special someone or a client meal."}
{"text":"If I was rating our server I would have given 5 stars but my overall rating is 4 stars. Very good food, nice staff, clean and elegant environment. We ordered the fish tacos and pad thai shrimp; the tacos had a little kick to them and the shrimp were so thick and delicious.   What made this experience that much better was our server Billy. This guy is super cool and genuine, unscripted and real. It's nice to come across these rare servers that I wish could be copied and dispersed amongst all other restaurants.  When I come back I'll definitely ask for him   Our total for both dishes and a side of side of clam chowder (also a little spicy) was $34"}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience at Bonefish Grill. The food is always so fresh and yummy. Yesterday i came here wanting a snack before i went home so i ordered their famous bang bang shrimp which i think everyone in the world is aware of, mostly i wanted a watermelon cosmo they offered during the summer which i wasn't sure they were still offering and they weren't,he mentioned its only during the summer because they use real watermelon, my waiter Damien was very insightful and entertaining he kept me laughing the entire time i was there. He suggested the winter white cosmo which was definetly as good as the watermelon cosmo.How can i forget the bread with olive pesto mix they bring out with every meal omg to die for if eating bread was a sin iv'e commited a tons because i that bread is to die for .I took my boyfriend here over the summer for fathers day and may i add the Surf and Turf they only offer on holidays is bomb!!!! Im ready for them to bring it back."}
{"text":"I can honestly say I've never really liked fish filets until the Bonefish. My fish usually has to be fried or in a taco. The Chilean sea bass with the garlic tomato lime sauce is $$$, just Money! Add Jasmine rice and scalloped potatoes as a side with an ultimate dirty martini and mo' money, mo' money, mo' money! I've found what I like and I like what I've found! A winner in my book!  Pro tip #1 sign up for their email subscription and get free bang bang, bang bang! Shrimp on your birthday! Free.99 are you outta your mind!   Pro tip numero dos Make a reservation! Horrible location right smack dab in the middle of the Concord Mills parking lot!"}
{"text":"I'm not a breakfast fan but boy do I like brunch and this is a great place for that!  There are many items on the brunch menu that include shrimp, lobster and crab if that's your thing!  I had the California omelet which was probably one of the best omelets I have eaten.  My husband enjoyed the bottomless bubbles a little too much.  Service was fantastic!    We are using their event room for an event in January (which is why we came to sample brunch) and WOW!!  The room is very nice with floor to ceiling windows, seating for 55, a drop down projector & screen and a podium.  The room is no charge and they don't require a number count which is a great benefit since people don't know how to RSVP anymore.  They offer a brunch, lunch and dinner event menu.  Andy has been a pleasure to work with."}
{"text":"Bang bang shrimp and Monday $5 martinis. You can't beat that kind of deal. I got 4 martinis and everyone was better than the previous one. Take advantage of the good deal and get for drink on. The service was great our server was really helpful when it  came to helping me pick a drink."}
{"text":"My wife and I always have a great experience at Bonefish Grill!"}
{"text":"Overall I enjoy bonefish. Decent food selection for someone who doesn't like seafood and you can't beat the bang bang special on Wednesday nights. Tonight we did takeout. 20mins and we were out the door. Not a bad wait considering they were on a 30min wait inside."}
{"text":"I was hesitant to try this place because of some of the reviews, but really glad I did! I met two other ladies after work for dinner. The interior is really beautiful and welcoming and there is also outdoor seating. We were seated immediately and Edgar, our server, appeared moments later. I have to say he gave us great service the entire night. At one point he told us \"please stay as long as you like, this is my house and you are my guests\". We shared an appetizer of Bang Bang Shrimp. This is a must have if you go there! Edgar also told us it is half price on Wednesdays. Delicious, lightly breaded shrimp in a sweet/spicy/creamy sauce on a bed of lettuce. It was more than enough for the three of us - very generous serving. I had the lobster roll. It comes with fries and cole slaw but I was able to swap out the fries for green beans or any of the other sides. It was filled with lobster chunks - really yummy! My dining companions had the sea bass special and a chicken dish with goat cheese. Both said they were delicious. All of our food was presented beautifully. Also, they passed the water refill test! Someone was coming by checking if we needed more water the entire time we were there. I will definitely go back on a Wednesday and get some more Bang Bang Shrimp. Nice place for a special occasion dinner. Glad I waited until they worked out the service kinks."}
{"text":"Woohoo! Perhaps the best food I've ever tasted in Charlotte and some of the best food I've ever tasted in my life. And the waiters dressed like Chefs, make it an even more enjoyable experience. Expensive beautiful atmosphere, for us people who want to pretend to be rich for a day! The customer service was awesome and friendly, including the manager who went out of his way to help us with a minor issue. RECOMMENDED!"}
{"text":"We ventured over here for lunch away from the strip. It's a nice mid-range restaurant. The server was friendly and very efficient, which made the dining experience pleasant.  I had the bang bang shrimp. I was curious since it seems to be a 'thing' at Bonefish Grill. It was just ok. I expected something spicy that would be filled with a burst of flavor. It wasn't. It was fried shrimp with a light creamy sauce coating. If you're going to say something is spicy - it really should be spicy. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't heat either. The tortillas on the soft tacos were hard. I'm not sure if it was because the tortillas were not fresh or if they were grilled and left out too long. The side of pesto couscous was good. It was light and refreshing.  One dining companion had the grilled fish of the day lunch entree which was rock fish. Mango salsa was added. He got a side of Asian slaw. This dish was so good, he didn't even share one bite. He said it was really good. The other companion had the Lily's salmon lunch entree with fries. I didn't try this one either, but at least he offered. It was a beautiful presentation on the plate (except for the fries).  For dessert we shared the coconut pie. Keep in mind this isn't a cream pie (in case you're more familiar with that). It was served with whipped cream on top. It smelled sugary and sweet. Once I took a bit, I was intrigued. It had a familiar taste. The consistency and flavor was different, but it reminded me of coconut butter mochi. It really seemed like this dessert was inspired by one of my favorite treats. Yay! This dessert will definitely bring me back here!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit ever to a Bonefish grill and I was very pleased over all with the selection of wines and variety of foods offered. While the pricing was moderate-higher side, I felt the quality, freshness, and attention to detail balanced the cost. I ordered the Haddock special offered for the month and thought it was superb. The amount of food and freshness of it all made it positively perfect. I was delighted with my dinner paired with a red blend wine. The atmosphere of the restaurant along with the waiter made the experience even better. Our waiter was very pleasant and knowledgeable about all of the dishes along with the specialty drinks and wine pairings."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, experience will outweigh food for me on this one.  We walked in at 5:28 on a Tuesday.  The restaurant was not full at all, yet our only choice was to wait for a table in the dining room because they were \"waiting for people to get up\", or sit at a high top -- which the hostess was pushing on everyone who came in the door -- in the bar by the door where the cold will immediately hit you.  Why would I want to sit right next to the door in the middle of winter??  So we waited for about fifteen minutes when there were empty tables in the dining room.  I understand that they're very reservation oriented, but there were three six tops in my view that sat empty for the entire time we were there.  You can't tell me that you're holding a reservation for 18 or three reservations for 6 for multiple hours before they show up when there are people waiting in the lobby.  That's just not right.  And if the issue is that it's a Tuesday and you don't have all hands on deck, I guess the two managers standing around with the hostess will have to take a couple tables.    Once we were seated, our server was fine.  he was really good at paying attention to my boyfriend's iced tea level, and he made himself available without being on top of us all the time.  Our food was good, though I'd recommend not getting the mashed potatoes.  They were just meh.  But my Cosmo was delicious.  So yes, everything we ingested we were happy with.  The review is not food related at all.   But why do we have to eat in the dark?  I swear, the light level was not above nightlight.  I get that they're going for ambiance, but that was literally like trying to read a menu by candlelight.  Not favorable.  A little illumination never killed any ambiance for me.  I mean, it's not like they need big overhead fluorescents, but a couple lamps would be nice.    So on the whole, eh.  If we didn't have another $50 gift card staring at us, we probably wouldn't return.  And again, it has nothing to do with the food -- it's good, but not mind blowing.  But the waiting for a table in a half full restaurant on a Tuesday at 5:30, and then the sitting in the dark doesn't make the food good enough to put Bonefish on my list of places I MUST NOT forget about."}
{"text":"Always feel welcome here.  Incredibly great bartenders.  Management always says hello and usually with a good handshake.  You don't usually find that in a chain."}
{"text":"I love wine, I love dinner, so I went to their Coppola wine dinner with a friend to celebrate a birthday. This was a good chance to sample their fare along with paired vino!  The 4 course dinner started with Lobster stuffed shrimp paired with Chardonnay. Very tasty appetizer and the capers were an awesome addition! The salad was Arugula with goat cheese, cukes and watermelon, and it was a very good salad and great for the hot hot weather. This was  paired with a Sauvignon blanc. The servers came around frequently to ensure the wine was topped off. Impressive! Mahi mahi was our entree, which was nicely cooked and topped with crab, and sides of asparagus & mashed potatoes. We asked for lemons, which enhaced the fish, and both sides were very good. Mahi was paired with a red wine and our table of 4 really enjoyed all the wine! Chocolate creme brulee was the dessert. I love creme bruleee but am not a big chocolate fan, however I did like this brulee and the Cabernet it was paired with!  The seating was 2 large tables and a few 4 tops, and the private dining room is comfortable!  A great event at a great venue."}
{"text":"This is my second time I have been there. First time was mediocre, but this time the food was boring. I decided to start with the oatmeal for breakfast $3.90. Not much you expect from oatmeal... But the problem is that they gave me super sour/tart with awful tasting blueberries that weren't ripe. I had to remove them from the oatmeal. I told the waitress about them and didn't really get a sincere response. Next thing I see is another guy taking the box of blueberries somewhere else from the kitchen...I hope I don't get sick from it. Then I had the oscar omelet which was so so. Food is not as upscale as the place looks. I told my friend, don't take me here for my bday ever lol!"}
{"text":"I agree with Chad E.  a great place, but easily overlooked as it is set back in the parking lot and cannot be spotted from Independence without some effort.  For the longest time I did not know that Bonefish Grill was a \"chain\" since this was the only location I knew of - but that speaks to a lot since it feel like a unique restaurant.  Their servers are always great and I've had many good experiences at this location."}
{"text":"My roommate and I went to Bonefish Grill because we were craving the bang bang shrimp! Also on their website they are offering $10 off your bill through 4/20/15. All you have to do is pull it up on your phone and show it to your server! No printer necessary.   We decided to start with the calamari appetizer which is served with banana peppers and a sweet chili dipping sauce. The dipping sauce was delicious. They also had a few breaded pieces of red bell peppers with the calamari.   For our entrees, we both got the bang bang shrimp tacos. It comes with 3 tacos and your choice of fresh greens (with a balsamic vinaigrette) or house chips. We both got the fresh greens. The salad was good but a little bit heavy on the dressing.   The atmosphere of the restaurant is nice, a little more upscale than your regular chain restaurant. The lights were turned down low - that almost too low where you can hardly see your menu.   Our service was mediocre. Took a while to get our drinks refilled. But overall, not too bad."}
{"text":"This was our first time here, and it won't be our last. The service from start to finish was amazingly friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable. Thanks Tate!! Fresh baked bread with olive oil and pesto, perfectly grilled fish - we shared the Ahi and the Salmon, and wonderful veggies. The zucchini was probably the best I've ever had and their sweet potato mash... yum. The jasmine rice was a perfect complement to the fish as well. No dessert tonight, but next time for sure. Check it out!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in with my co-workers this past week for lunch... the restaurant is clean, nicely laid out, and a convenient location for us as it is close to the office. When we arrived we were promptly seated, and our waiter approached to take our drink order, once we received our drinks we then ordered some appetizers to share... we started with the Cold Snap Fresh Ceviche and Thai Coconut Shrimp.  The ceviche was not that exciting to me, felt there was something missing from other ceviches I have had- but the coconut shrimp was delicious! For lunch I chose the Shrimp Pad Thai, I was very pleased with my selection.   I would recommend Bonefish Grill- they had decent lunch specials, and the food was good.  I wish that our service had been a lil better- our waiter seemed to be a bit sparce on the appearances even though the restaurant did not appear to be full. Once we ordered the appetizers our waiter did not return till after they were delivered by a food runner, he then proceeded to take out lunch order- just seemed to be a large gap of time in getting the appetizers after we ordered them followed by quite a time gap in actually getting to order out lunch."}
{"text":"We went here a couple months ago and while I'm sure we will go back, I don't have much desire to return.    The service was great but the fish was average and I wasn't crazy about anything I ordered.    What sticks out to me the most was the memory of my husband getting an order of 'bang bang' shrimp.  To this day we still joke about it because he was up all night with the runs.  That's why we haven't returned!"}
{"text":"We had a bad experience here the other night so I definitely need to downgrade my rating to two stars.   I got an email about two weeks ago for a pineapple shrimp and coconut risotto special which sounded great and thats what brought me in. While looking at the menu I didn't see it listed. I asked our server about it and she thought they still had it but said she would double check. She brought our drinks and still hadn't checked on it.   When she came back to take our order she said they didn't have it anymore, that was awfully fast to take it off. Anyway I ordered the seared ahi with potatoes au gratin and steamed broccoli. Although the ahi was very good the sides were absolutely horrible. The potatoes were way undercooked, almost raw and the cheese sauce tasted like something from a birds eye frozen box. The broccoli was so overcooked it was totally limp and tasteless. I showed the server and she said she would tell the manager.   We had plenty of room for dessert since I didn't eat the sides. They had a chocolate lava cake specials described as \"hot molten chocolate center\". When it was delivered it was completely cooked through. No lava in the lava cake. It also was only served with whipped cream, no ice cream. The server saw we weren't eating it and we showed her the inside. She said she would have the manager make us a new one. The manager brought us a new one but it was practically the same. Again we didn't eat it. She brought us our bill and nothing was taken off.   I don't ever expect free food, but I sure don't think I should have to pay for something that I didn't eat because it was cooked improperly. The manager said he was sorry for all the issues we had and gave us a card for a free bang bang shrimp. Ya, thanks but we won't be returning."}
{"text":"Great service from WALLACE! Food was pretty good I got the seabass and truffle mac both were decent...I would be back for the service over the food! All the martinis I tried were excellent! Blue berry martini, some spicy martini and espresso martini! Great drinks!!!"}
{"text":"This is actually my second time there. The food is awesome, and the staff are as well. I am visually impaired and they have a braille menu which is really cool. I do recommend the corn chowder soup and the tacos. They are excellent. For dessert the last time I was there, I had a creme brulee. It was excellent and I'm not a dessert person at all. The music there is awesome. And the staff are wonderful."}
{"text":"Came here with my family last week.. It was my first time and I was thoroughly impressed .. I had figured the food would be good I just didn't realize that it would be that good! Their famous shrimp appetizer is a must have!"}
{"text":"We love coming here if we are craving seafood. We caught their happy hour that they have daily which is nice for the weekend. Had a very tasty martini and their signature bang bang shrimp. The service was good. Their crab fried rice is a must have side dish."}
{"text":"Where's Troy?!?!? He made this place. Without him it's just overpriced mediocre seafood."}
{"text":"We went to Bonefish Grill tonight to celebrate my brother-in-law's birthday. The staff is so friendly that we felt welcome from the moment we entered the restaurant until the moment we left. Our server, Celine M., was one of the highlights of our dining experience. She's very knowledgeable about the menu . . . she took our drink order but gave us time to look at the menu and decide what we wanted to order. I always appreciate that courtesy from a server. My sister and I both ordered the Georges Bank Scallops and Shrimp with the lime, tomato, garlic sauce. They were cooked to perfection and very flavorful. We both ordered Caesar salad and the sautéed spinach. We both love garlic so that spinach really hit the spot. She ordered the potatoes au gratin while I ordered the garlic mashed potatoes (garlicky, creamy goodness). My brother-in-law, who isn't a big eater, ordered the Saucy Shrimp appetizer as his entrée. It was a large enough appetizer that he actually took some home. He ordered it the last time he was there and liked it so much he had to have it again. We ordered the Macadamia Nut Brownies for dessert. It's a delicious flourless chocolate brownie topped with whipped cream and served with a side of vanilla ice cream. Celine brought out a beautiful strawberry/vanilla ice cream/whipped cream creation as a birthday surprise for my brother-in-law, who is very much a dessert person. We enjoyed our dinner so much that we're already planning on going back for my sister's birthday in August and we hope that Celine is working when we go in so we can ask to be seated in her section."}
{"text":"I came here for my birthday brunch, and it was fantastic. Our server was amazing. She handled our party of 8 seamlessly. Our drinks stayed filled, food was delicious and timely. Two people split an omelet, and it was split prior to coming out. All the food was amazing. I had the bang bang shrimp Benedict, and it was delicious. The restaurant sent out a special dessert for my birthday with a hand written card from the manager and a coupon for a free bang bang shrimp. It was awesome. Not only will I be coming back, but I will also be recommending this location to everyone."}
{"text":"Love this place! The hubby and I dined here for brunch today.He had the surf and turf eggs benedict and I had the bang bang shrimp eggs benedict, and it was great! The food was cooked perfectly. The Asparagus was cooked like it should be, crispy and seasoned just right. The Mimosa was to die for. Our waitress was Heather and she was very sweet and attentive. We will make it a point to go back again...Keep up the good work Bonefish!"}
{"text":"Great dinner...portions a bit small but VERY flavorful! Seated us promptly, service was good and environment was comfortable.  Additionally both the front of house manager and GM came to our table to see how things were and gave us a box of custom chocolate once they found out it was my birthday.  The best touch was that they served sample appetizers to people waiting to be seated...classy.  Overall, a must eat at restaurant!"}
{"text":"Not a good experience here. From water on the floor which I spotted when I walked in, still there from someone to slip on when I left,it only went downhill. Both Happy Hour appetizers were disappointing. The poke we sent back because it looked so dark and slimy. Then we got the wrong cocktail delivered to the table. The topper was when my daughters entree had a big black hair on it. After management apologized, a new entree was brought out with raw green beans!! Lots of choices in Vegas, avoid this one."}
{"text":"First the food part:  The fish was excellent.  Husband had Tilapia, while I totally enjoyed the trout.  I preferred the old menu to this newly released, more causal dining menu.  The wine list is very fairly priced.  Service was excellent.  Now the bad:  I called at 6:10pm asking to make a reservation for 6:30 or 7pm that night.  I was told they do not take reservations for within an hour.  Nor do they do call ahead wait listing.  I asked \"if we come within ten minutes, will there be a wait for a table for two?\"  I was told, \"No, I don't think that will be problem.\"  We arrived in less than ten minutes and were told that there was a 25-30 minute wait. I recognized her voice, and reminded her that I had just called.  She blushed, shrugged her shoulders, and referred us to the bar.  Where we paid for two glasses of wine, feeling like we had been screwed.  There WERE empty tables in the restaurant.  I would have gone elsewhere, but it was a long day of traveling and husband wanted to stay.  But it left a very bad taste in our mouths about this particular BoneFish."}
{"text":"I like coming here for happy hour. Nice place to relax and have a couple cocktails. Bang bang shrimp never disappoints!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice now with two very different experiences.   The first.. Amazing - 5 stars Our waitress was fantastic, our martinis full to the top, and the food was delicious. I was a big fan of this place.  The second...  Atrocious - 1 star (only because they have to get at least one) Our waiter was rude... First thing he said when he came to our table was 'are you all 21?' (our group ranged from 28 to 40s...) He proceeded to take our drink order, and at the very end asked for our IDs - Why not do that at the beginning? And why the attitude? * He didn't bring our waters - first thing we asked for... * We had to ask for bread.. Our waitress the first time brought it out first thing! * My martini was about 3/5ths full this time... I didn't know I paid for a partial drink!  I am giving this 2 stars due to the bad taste left in my mouth and the fact I will not be returning.  If you do go, stay away from the waiter with a tattoo of a blue ball or something like that on his arm... He will ruin your experience. Consistency is important and this place does not have it. And so is employees with a good attitude!"}
{"text":"Went here for my friend's 21st birthday. We were seated quickly (inside, although patio is available). The atmosphere was very nice however it was a bit too chilly. My friend got a dirty martini, which she really enjoyed. We shared the Mussels Josephine as an appetizer, it was absolutely delicious, both when i got it today and in the past. ALWAYS a must have! Plus it comes with enough to share. For my entrée i got the Tilapia Imperial - it was a bit too cheesy for me, with barely any shrimp or scallops as promised. Id give that dish in itself a 6/10. They always give you bread which is amazing with the dipping oil. But most importantly, our server was very friendly and got back to us quickly with anything we needed. Overall a great restaurant each time I come. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Went to the bar with a friend to kill some time while waiting for daughters at Town Square. We had vacationed in Florida and saw this place, but never stopped in..meh just another chain. Bartender asked if we like a menu..sure..we said just bring us a meal you like best. He was excited..\"you got it\" Nice dealing with a pro. We had crab cakes, a bisque, Fontina Pork chops with mashed garlic potatoes and the Lily's Chicken. I have to say we were surprised, the chop was one of the best I've ever had, and everything else was great. Drinks were never empty, and the pours were strong. Interesting note: he didn't bring out any fish!  Don't wait for the dining area, eat at the bar!"}
{"text":"Wanted to have dinner and as soon we walked in we were greeted. Place was not busy and there were alot of tables to fit 4 people. The host was gonna sit us across the toilet and I told her I didn't want that table. Then she was gonna sit us next to the kitchen and an isle. I specifically told not the isle or not near the kitchen or toilet. She kept looking around and I was able to count more than 10 tables.  I was already upset so I told her to forget it. She says \" let me see what I can do\" I told her you've done enough and walked away."}
{"text":"I had never been to Bonefish Grill before, but we had a celebratory lunch here a few weeks ago and I can't say I'm impressed.  We had the private dining area to ourselves, but we were a little disappointed to see the choices on the three-course prefix menu. The fish options were limited and all the entrees came with the same side option of cous cous salad, whether it made sense with the meal or not.   I decided on the corn chowder to start, followed by the tilapia topped with artichoke heart, feta and a very sad cous cous salad. I don't particularly like tilapia, but given the other options, it seemed like the only way to go. The cous cous salad could not be salvaged. It was gummy and I wasn't the only one that was pushing it around their plate, pretending to eat it. The soup was just ok, but I heard the salad was overly garlicky and salty, so the soup was probably the best option. For dessert, I opted for the key lime pie. It was nothing special, like most things about the meal.    I didn't get a chance to order anything from the regular menu, but based on this meal, I don't have much interest in checking them out again."}
{"text":"Ordered the shrimp pad tia and was beyond disappointed. Shrimp was so nasty and noodles were hard to chew. Have had this before and it has never tasted this bad."}
{"text":"Any time my wife and I go to this South Hills Bonefish Grille we are more than pleased.  They take reservations and that works out well and their food is excellent and we've never gotten bad service there.  We rate this place very highly.   I just cannot get enough of their pecan parmesan encrusted rainbow trout; it is soooooo delicious and the bang bang shrimp as an appetizer.  Doesn't get much better than this place. Highly Recommend!!"}
{"text":"Located at the old Islands Burger location across the street from Paradise Valley Mall.  Not real big on chain restaurants but heard good things about Bonefish Grill.  Came here on a Friday night and the restaurant was packed and they said it would be about a 20 minute wait and ended  up to be 10.  Ordered the Corn Chowder with Lobster, Mahi Mahi with Garlic Mash Potatoes, Atlantic Salmon with Potatoes Au Gratin.  The Corn Chowder was a little strong on the corn and makes me wish I had ordered the Lobster Bisque instead.  The Mahi Mahi had very good texture and was prepared well on the grill. The Garlic Mash Potatoes were also very good.  The Atlantic Salmon was also prepared and grill to perfection. As for the Potatoes Au Gratin it just did not hit the mark. I think I am just to used to how Don and Charlie ' s prepares theirs. The sauce I chose on the side was the Pan Asian Sauce which was pretty tasty but with wood grilling the salmon could stand on its own.  The Sourdough Bread was exceptional and baked fresh. We devoured the entire loaf.  Was not impressed by the side dishes but the fish grilled over wood was very good.  Will come back again."}
{"text":"Had the opportunity to give this Bonefish location a second chance when my in-laws wanted to take us to dinner there the other night.  None of the service issues mentioned in my previous review were evident on this visit but, that's not to say there weren't other service issues.  More on that later.  In terms of the food, they do a very nice job grilling fish over a wood fire.  There is no doubt there.  I had the large portion of Grouper and it was absolutely perfect.  Nice grill marks, very moist, excellent flavor.  My wife got the grilled scallops and shrimp with a mango salsa.  Her seafood was also quite good with the scallops perhaps a tad bit overcooked but, just barely.  The reason for 3 stars vs more stars lies elsewhere.  While the proteins are grilled very well, they seem to have an issue with oil.  No matter what it was on the plate, there just seemed to be a greasy quality to it and I really can't explain it any better than that.  It existed in the mango salsa, the lemon butter sauce seemed to have it (yes, i know butter is a fat but this is different!), it was there in the succotash that was the vegetable of the day as well. It was noticeable on our first visit in my wife's fish tacos too.  It's not that it makes anything taste bad, in fact, I'm sure it has something to do with helping stuff taste good.  It's just that it imparts a weird mouth feel.  On the service side, this time there wasn't any overkill menu rundowns, unannounced armpits in the face or anything like that, it was more of an attitude given off that felt like, \"this job is beneath me\".  I didn't say anything about it during the meal but, when we got in the car, my wife said, \"What was up with that server?\" and she had picked up the same vibe.  Beyond that, the service was absolutely attentive.  All this said, a MUCH better overall experience than visit one.  While it's doubtful Bonefish will be a destination for us as there are too many better non-chain options to patronize, I would gladly go back again with the in-laws or other friends who want to go."}
{"text":"For a chain restaurant, kudos to Bonefish in Independence, Ohio. There's a reason why this place is always packed. This place boasts some of the freshest seafood I've had here in CLE. I suggest reservations, I've never been able to come and just get seated (always had a wait).   If you've never come here, go for the Bang Bang Shrimp. It's breaded shrimp with a delectable spicy sweet sauce. It's one of their signature plates and I think on Wednesdays it's half off. Last few years, been to Hawaii a few times and was addicted to tuna poke! Poke is like seasoned raw tuna and the market for poke in CLE is non existent (except for Heinin's downtown). Was very pleased to see a tuna poke dish on this menu. It was a very healthy choice, comes with rice and plentiful servings. It's pan seared so the edges are cooked. I would venture to saw that it might have been previously frozen but still a very delightful dish that I would order again.   Loved our staff, very attentive and professional with excellent suggestions."}

{"text":"This Bonefish Grill has to be the absolutely worst one that i have ever been.   Every aspect of the service was slow, and the staff was not engaging.    The food was decently prepared, but not as to justify the price.  The Independence location is much better.  Go there."}
{"text":"Ceviche was tasty, but I felt like it should have been served in a goblet or large martini glass.  Bread was very good. The salad was delicious and perfectly dressed. My sea bass was grilled to perfection, but the mango salsa was a bit sweet for my taste buds. The prices were reasonable. I'd certainly come back again."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Bonefish Grill and I was pleasantly surprised.  The menu was great and the staff was very knowledgeable.  Our server Christine explained their restaurant concept without asking and mentioned her recommendations.  If a server eats at the restaurant it is a very good sign.  Each waiter/waitress also had a thermometer on them.  Our server was very efficient and had her act together.  We started off with the Bang Bang Shrimp as an appetizer.  They were good but the breading fell off of almost every one.  I have had different versions of breaded shrimp in a spicy cream sauce and the breading never fell off like this.  I believe the trick is to apply the breading, then cool them in a freezer for a few minutes.  After we ordered these they came out in literally 5-7 minutes.  Either they were made ahead of time or they are quickly made, skipping the chill process which may contribute to the breading mishap.  Despite the breading issue they were delicious.  4/5 stars  My girlfriend ordered the Blackened Baja Fish Tacos.  She said they were delicious but the Jasmine Rice was lacking any flavor whatsoever.  The tacos were spicy but offset nicely with the mango.  And it would have been nice to have more of the lime crema on them or on the side.  4/5  I ordered the Tilapia Imperial with Au Gratin Potatoes and Jasmine Rice.  The tilapia was cooked just the way I like it; crispy exterior but still flaked apart.  The shrimp/scallops/crab and lemon caper butter was average.  The Jasmine Rice was bland but some places server it like this.  I would recommend adding some kind of flavor to side.  4/5"}
{"text":"Went for dinner last night. 45 minute wait to be seated, after being told 20-30. Arggg!  I have no patience, so a 45 minute wait really made me unhappy. We made a dinner out of appetizers.   Bang Bang shrimp, pot stickers, tuna, calamari, ceviche.  Chocolate brulee for dessert. Pictures aren't the greatest, but oh well. Shrimp - very good.  Hubby's favorite. Pot stickers - ok, nothing fancy.  Not worth the price. Tuna - pretty good, don't know that I'd order it again. Calamari - OUTSTANDING.  My favorite of the night. Ceviche - hubby loved it, I hated it. Dessert - delicious! We will be returning!"}
{"text":"Last week, my friend and I were the first guests through the door of Bonefish. We had visited before, and our stomachs were in great anticipation of some Bang Bang Shrimp. The service was friendly, the food came out quickly, and tasted just as good as you'd expect at a place like this.   My only issues were with the crab toppings. If a restaurant offers crab topped anything, I expect it to be more than two pinch full of pieces. Is this what people who love Chipotle gripe about with their meats? Perhaps. I ordered some crab fried rice. All of the crab was just tossed on top of the dish, not mixed in. Certainly, that's not a huge deal- it's not troublesome to just mix it all in, but I wonder why it couldn't be done that way before getting to the table? My friend's crab topped fish had about 5 pieces for a whole filet.   Maybe the prices of crab went up lately? I admit, I haven't been watching the news very much lately. To save my sanity from the grievances of the new President and his Twitter fingers- maybe I missed out on what's happening in the seafood world.   That aside, the crumbs on the seat had to be dusted off as I sat down, one plate and two forks were dirty with visible food pieces. That's a bit much for a newly opened restaurant. We walked through the doors at 4:00pm. I instructed my stomach that it'll be a while before it tasted any bang bang shrimp again."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday for dinner with my husband, sister in law, and brother in law. From the outside the place looked really nice and to get inside you have to go through the revolving door.   When you enter to the left is the dining area and to the right is the bar area with some seating as well. Since we had a party of 4 plus a baby we sat in the dining area.   The service was exceptional for the place being super busy. Our waitress was very attentive to us and even loved the baby. She made our experience great.   We got the bang bang shrimp to start and it was delicious. It was highly recommended on yelp which is why we choose to get it for appetizer. For our entrees we tried the lobster stuffed shrimp and the crab crusted Alaskan cod. Both dishes were delicious. Even the garlic whipped mashed potatoes and potatoes au gratin that my husband got was good. The spinach made my husband's mouth dry/itchy so it was hard to eat and the green beans needed some salt because they tasted bland. Other than that we had a great meal and even got a couple of drinks (Moscow mule & Manhattan).   I would recommend this place and would like to try their happy hour and its daily I think from 4-630!"}
{"text":"We ate here on May 26, 2016.  The food was fantastic and our waitress was amazing and full of great suggestions and had a wonderful personality.  Highly recommend for a higher quality place to eat."}
