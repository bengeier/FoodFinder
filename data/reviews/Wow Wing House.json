{"text":"I live on Mahogany crt which is literally around the corner their are 135 different flavors of wings. I have gone through half of the list. I would write about each one but I won't. I will tell you my Top 3 so far if you love spicy at number 3 is Town of Jaffna its spicy and has alot of flavor I had to eat 2 pounds of those bad boys. At number 2 Devils Ranch a beautiful a lil kick with that Ranch flavor they have it rated in their menu 6 chilies but to be honest it's more like 4 chilies for me. At number 1 its the SPICY JERK BBQ it has so much flavor and different things I can not stop eating them they are amazing. You have to also try the onion rings for a side I don't know what they do with them but they are the best onion rings I have had so far. I'm rating this place 3 stars because the food is great but the staff are ......... Not the greatest let's say that my wife and her friends go there every weekend for wings and drinks with her friends and the bartenders do not know to make a drink they told my wife one sec let me Google how to make it.....They have this one cook who every time I see him hes hanging outside the place and  trying to get my wife or her friends number even random ladies numbers. Today I went there to get some wings for the kids and this guy is hitting on a 17 year old I Knew she was 17 because it was my neighbors daughter I walked up to him and asked WTF is he doing he just walked back inside and went to the kitchen."}
{"text":"I visited with my boyfriend last night. We entered the restaurant and there were no employees to be seen. There were two other patrons sitting at another table. After we waited about 5 minutes and still had not seen an employee, we decided to get up and leave. As we walked out the door, the other patron notified us that the employee working was standing in the back doing absolutely nothing. The patron shouted to the employee that customers were walking out, and the employee said nothing and did nothing. I would give zero stars if I could. Worst service I have ever experienced. We went to Wild Wing instead and had a great meal there."}
{"text":"this place was closed... we arrived at 6:30pm on a Thursday.  Place looked very small and did not post busniess hours.  Not sure if they are still in business or not."}
{"text":"Great food and good customer service. Location is perfect as its very close to my house."}
{"text":"Wings are good! Haven't eaten in always take out as it is close to home. Had the spicey lemon & gar par flavor. Both delicious! Owner said has problems sometimes with his interact machine. So call ahead   may need to pay."}
{"text":"Very nice place, wings are fresh, not frozen , which makes this place unique. I been to many wing place and the deal and the food is amazing. They have some spice house going on, infusion with some nation"}
{"text":"Restaurant was empty on a Friday lunch. Food arrived quick however the wings did not taste good. They did not taste fresh and were very dry. Soft drinks were bland/watered down. Personally would not come back. Nor will my coworkers."}
{"text":"Wings are really good. Had the BBQ ones. Great size wings also. Spicy wedges were good too but they don't give you as much as you'd like in a large container. The pizza was nothing special could probably get better pizza at pizza nova or Pizza Hut. A bit too pricy for the amount of food you get. Hence the 3 stars.."}
{"text":"Great location for the neighbourhood! My favourite wing flavour would be \"Texas homicide\" it was amazing!! I would literally stuff my face w/ all the chicken I can eat & lick the sauce off my fingers & even the checkered red & white wrapper they provide w/ the wings. It was that delicious lol its great to see a neighbourhood wing house joint. We don't have much of this type of restaurant atmosphere around the area where we can hang out & even drink late w/ friends. As a new restaurant starting up, I can solely say that they have all the right promos for almost every day of the week!

Go check it out! You won't be disappointed :)"}
{"text":"The wings are very fresh.  I got the hotter than hell wings and they were very tasty and the fries as fresh also.  The combo for one was well worth it."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: modern with lots of tvs all around, the music was also on really loud, it's definitely a different feel from St. Louis   Food: 1. Garlic Parm: wings were very well breaded with bread crumbs, but there wasn't enough sauce! I also wished that they would've marinated their wings! That would've given it that extra hint of flavour.   2. Cheese and gravy: this was subpar. Nothing too memorable, I'm a big fan of cheese and gravy, but I'll probably skip out on this one next time.   Overall: although the food was subpar, I'm Always in the mood for wings and there's SOOO many flavours to try out !"}
{"text":"I've driven past this place many times but never thought about stopping in but lately I've had a craving for wings so I've been on a quest to find the best wings close to home.  Walking in, this place is smaller than I expected. Very quiet. Only two patrons at the bar, way past their legal limit. It looks like only one server/bartender/cook/cashier/dishwasher.  Wow, they have 123 different flavours! Feeling for something a little sweet, I settled on the Japanese Jerk (for takeout). I like spicy too. Hmmm, it smells more like East Indian spices. Not complaining, just found it interesting.  Tastewise, they weren't bad but the flavour wasn't as pronounced as the aroma suggested. I think I might prefer a dry rub. Next time."}
{"text":"This location is closed for renovations! The website doesn't mention anything about it....same thing happened with the Richmond Hill location last year, they closed down for good with no mention anywhere. However, the Richmond Hill location still shows on the website.   I love wow wings, and travel far just to have them. This is not right!!!!"}
{"text":"3.5 star  Over 123 flavors and 7 TVs in the bar area. I am a fan!    69 cents wings on Monday let you pick 5 or 10  wings of any flavours...the question is which?   Humble Bee ~ honey horseradish and mustardy good  Forty Creek BBQ ~ whiskey bbq  The wings were of good size and meaty, deep fried perfectly.  Steam Whistle on tap with Rickards and Alexander Keith..  End with a piece of cheesecake from The Cheesecake Factory....  Life is good!"}
