{"text":"I had a wonderful lunch with my mother at this Bravo location. Our waitress was amazing and catered to our every need. Excellent!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Italian food. Don't be afraid because it's \"at the Mall\". Entrance is from the parking lot. Great ambiance. Pleasant bar with personable staff. But don't go for the drinks - go for the food. Nothing skinny about this food. It's just like mamma Mia made. Great portions. Dinner tonight, leftovers for lunch tomorrow. Great bread with super lite olive oil."}
{"text":"My first time was fantastic our waiter Yule was awesome!! The food was delicious. Tonight was a disaster. Plastic in the ravioli is not acceptable on any level."}
{"text":"Chose this place because of the Yelp reviews.  First time here, came with party of 6 for dinner.  It wasn't a perfect 5 star experience but it was definitely a solid 4 stars.

Let's start off with the appetizers, Fried Calamari and Crispy Shrimp Napoli.  They were money.  Very good appetizers.  The salads (Caesar and House) were both very good.

The misses were when it came to the steak orders.  One of the people in my party ordered a Ribeye and the other ordered a Sirloin (well done).  After the order was placed, the server came back and broke the news, they were out of Ribeyes.  Nothing worse than getting your mind set on an entree only to find out a few minutes later that the Chef said they are out.   Could have been avoided.  When the Sirloin came out it was very undercooked. It had to go back and took forever. 

My Lobster Ravioli Alla Vodka with Shrimp.  It was a little underwhelming when it came to the shrimp.  They were very small.  It did taste great though. My other family members got pizza and Baked Chicken Parmesan.  They really liked those dishes.

The management reduced the bill for the inconveniences and undercooked steak. So I can't complain.  The service was excellent.  In my book, 5 stars is a perfect Yelp experience and this was not a perfect experience.  Would I come back here again and/or recommend this place to friends.....Absolutely."}
{"text":"delicious food !! Love the lobster bisque and crispy shrimp Napoli , love to sit outside Especially in this nice weather."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I both loved our lunch date at Bravo. We both ordered delicious meals. Our server Bernadette made our experience at bravo very welcoming and enjoyable. Thank You Bernadette for your service! Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome service!!!
Great location- very easy to get to from Stephanie or Sunset. It is right between the Dillards and JC Penney. 
The foccacia bread they start you with is AMAZING!
For apps I would recommend the Spinach and Artichoke dip or the crispy calamari.
For dinner, the eggplant Parmesan, chicken scallopini, Gorgonzola crusted filet, mushroom ravioli, and lasagna are all so good.
The warm chocolate cake, with a molten lava center, and gelato vanilla bean ice cream is the best.
Try this place out. It is sister restaurants with Brio but its BETTER!"}
{"text":"I have been to Bravo 4 times since I have moved to Las Vegas from Brooklyn New York some of the best Italian food you can get is in Brooklyn New York so when I first came to Vegas and went to Bravo I was totally taken back not only by the food but by the service I have been there with friends and cousins from New Jersey they have all raised about the service and the food it is now my favorite Italian restaurant in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Food was uninspired. As an Italian-American, I felt a little insulted by this place. Seems like a bar with an Italian-Restaurant attached. Felt like a waste of money and I was disappointed after dinner. No more chain Italian joints."}
{"text":"Meh... Nothing spectacular. Me and my husband came here for our anniversary, we ordered their Pasta Fra Diavolo and it was alright. Nothing to write home about. The waitress we had gave me attitude when I showed her the Yelp check-in free appetizer and that soured my mood instantaneously. Our daughter came with us on our anniversary dinner (lack of a babysitter) and ordered a salad and spaghetti. They brought her the wrong salad and when they finally brought out the right one, it came out with main dish so it was wasted.. The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because the dessert trio was on FLEEK! My favorite part of the entire experience. But all in all, if we want Italian we are better off just going to Olive Garden."}
{"text":"Excellent service, Olga our server was great . The people that have bad reviews keep saying that after the second or third time they visit it was bad. I don't think so, if it was bad you guys keep coming back. It's like sex, it hurts so bad but it feels so good!! Stop writing bad things and just say you want something free. Amen!"}
{"text":"Omg!  Service from the minute we stepped in the bar was amazing! Bartender was knowledgable, sweet, attentive, etc. Then we went to our table and our bartender / mgr came to check on us and helped us with more drinks. Food was also unbelievable! I can't wait to come here again. All around fantastic experience!!!! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I go in regularly for a drink and some appetizers. Jenn is a great bartender! If your lucky enough to have her serve you, you will notice she is fast, she's sweet and she makes all her guests feel important. Best service I have had in a while."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Great food and ecellent service. Tomato bisque is delicious.  Eat here 3 times each week."}
{"text":"Just had dinner with my family and it was so amazing!! From the moment we walked in the door Valerie greeted us with a very warm welcome then after we sat we had ordered a bottle of wine Tara was so sweet she showed us the bottle while talking to us and poured three glasses. Bernadette was our server and I can't say enough good things about her!!!! She was so polite and patient with us, she also was very attentive and made sure we had everything we needed. Thank you staff of Bravo for such a wonderful dinner and experience."}
{"text":"Bravos used to be one of our favorites. We have always recommended it but just had lunch there today.  The food quality and portions have drastically decreased. My Pasta Woozie's
chicken was over cooked and the pasta undercooked. When I mentioned it to the waitress she said it was hard to get pasta right. Sometimes its undercooked or overcooked and its better undercooked. I barely touched it. My husband had the chicken bacon spinach flatbread that tasted fishy. Only good thing is they still have decent wedding soup."}
{"text":"We just had lunch here, and everything was outstanding...the food, our server Saudia, and manager Adam sending over birthday cake and gelato. The open and bright surroundings make the perfect atmosphere, and we most definitely will be loyal return customers."}
{"text":"This was my second time here and it was even better than the first.  We were there for Easter and it was packed.  It's nice to see that even on a busy day the service and food didn't suffer.  We ordered the Chicken Milanese and Lamb, both were delicious and portions were big enough for leftovers.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I love this place, it has awesome food, great atmosphere.
I've been here about 4 times, so far sence they opened, and everything is so good. The staff management and servers,  Tasha  our server  rocks she is always nice and takes great care of us when we're here.
Kudos to the cooks also thanks for your hard work.

Recommend this restaurant.

Great atmosphere outdoors also."}
{"text":"I hesitated coming here because initial reviews were just average. We had Shrimp Napoli for our appetizer and thought it excellent with the right amount of heat. Our entrees, Pasta Bravo and Lobster Ravioli were both good. We thought the portion size for the ravioli was small but it ended up being the perfect size. We had no room for dessert. We were in at around 3pm., so the restaurant was not busy. I probably would have been irritated at the noise level if the restaurant was full. Good \"in-between\" restaurant...not fast food and I think a bit better than Olive Garden for food and ambience."}
{"text":"Meatballs were more bread than meat. $14.99 serving of spaghetti was a cup. Five people at bar and it was about all he could handle. A senior woman sat at the end of the bar 10 minutes before he saw her."}
{"text":"Worth the stop. Very flavorful food. Not enough for vegetarian but what we had was great. Exceptional."}
{"text":"Both the food and service are excellent. Very similar to Bios's and Carrabbas. The rewards for dinner credits should be done without the Wi-Fi as it does not work correctly. They are slightly less expensive than the aforementioned restaurants, but food quality and quantity is equal.They are located in the Galleria Mall. Definitely recommend you try them out."}
{"text":"Place is clean, new, and has that real trendy, stuck up look to it. That always concerns me. However, hostess was nice, seated us quickly. Server, Juan Carlos, knows his stuff. Well versed on the menu, we order all 3 things he recommended, and none disappointed. We had the roasted tomato pizza, pasta diavolo, chopped salad, and i also noticed the wedding soup and got that. My two year old daughter ate(drank?) the entire soup like a monster. Between the 3 of us, my ticket for everything and a beer came to 40 bucks. That's less than anything in the food court. This will be our choice from now on."}
{"text":"Hello Bravo Management:

I would like to thank you and your team for ensuring that our dinner celebration of my mother's 93rd birthday was a perfect success last night.

We were promptly greeted, the service was very attentive, and the food was exceptionally delicious. We are confident that Bravo is the place to go when planning a special occasion.

Thank you very much, and we will see you soon.

Bravo!!"}
{"text":"I used to like Bravo Cucina, I would eat with my family, bring my friends, etc., till  Saturday lunch October 28 with my husband and my sister in law, I wanted the chicken Parmesan but they wouldn't serve it without the pasta and I didn't want the pasta. The server suggested the chicken Marsala so I ordered that. The sauce was okay but the chicken was as thin as a pancake and only one half breast. For 14.99 I don't think it was worth it. It came with a high blob of mashed potatoes so I guess I was supposed to fill up on those and not the chicken.  Next time I'll go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Went last sat late afternoon, parking was awful. Was gonna go back to The Rail (awesome), thought try someplace new. I ordered the calamari, lasagna and a house salad and the lava cake for dessert it was all excellent food but the service was terrible so bad the manager, comped our dessert next time I'll get takeout pizza from there the pizza was allthat"}
{"text":"This place is delicious.  The service, their specials and the food is great!!! If you are looking for some good Italian food, this place is a must!"}
{"text":"We're here all the time for dinner...love sitting outside on the patio...first time here for brunch on Sunday...this is gonna seem picky, but no jam or jelly?  Really?  Thanks for the dry nasty bread, Bravo...u have berries, why not create your own compote or preserves?  What a let down..."}
{"text":"The food here is consistently good and the menu is varied including new gluten free options. I had the lamb chops and polenta, all I can say is \"Bravo!\""}
{"text":"I heard that this restaurant was very good, and it rated highly on Yelp, so I gave it a try. I had the chicken parmesan.  When  I got my food the noodles were cold and the chicken had hot and cold spots in it, almost as if it were microwaved. The service and atmosphere were good."}
{"text":"Stopped in because we wanted some fettuccine Alfredo. Wow! Did we ever get more! Balsamic chicken over orzo and farro was fantastic. Had an eight year old with us that was catered to. Made her own pizzas with the chefs at the oven and was made to feel so special! We will come back...it is our new favorite place. Brian C was our waiter and couldn't be better! Fantastic! This is a must visit"}
{"text":"Food was excellent and our server, Dan was the best.  Adam, the manager visited with my friend and me and made us feel like we were valued guests. We will definitely return for more meals. Service and friendliness is scarce in Las Vegas and I very much appreciated this from Dan and Adam."}
{"text":"Bravo is an excellent upscale Italian chain with a new location at Summit Mall. This is the fourth location in NE Ohio, with other locations in Canton, Woodmere, and Mentor. I've been to the Woodmere location as well and this location is smaller. There was a pretty sizable crowd for a Wednesday night. Our waitress was very friendly and personable, which always adds to the dining experience. You are given a complimentary serving of bread with olive oil. The bread was excellent, as it usually is at Italian restaurants. We also got a calamari appetizer. It was really good. It came with two sauces, marinara and aioli. I wasn't really sure what was in the aioli sauce. Of the two, I preferred the marinara sauce, but the aioli wasn't bad. For my entree, I got the orzotto with mushrooms and prosciutto. It was excellent. I loved the hearty mushroom flavor, which dominated the dish. The parmesan and the boursin cheeses just added to it. Overall, if you're looking for a good place to eat in the Fairlawn area, head over to Bravo. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Wonderful food! Good service. Reasonable prices. The 5 oz filet may be the best steak I've ever eaten. The 1/2 size desserts are a great idea too."}
{"text":"Amazing meals and even more amazing service, especially from our server Juan Carlos! We came here for brunch before church and we highly recommend it. The servings are huge and the food is delicious. The atmosphere is nice as well. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Just tried this newly open restaurant. The staff were friendly & very attentive, fast service. The food was done quickly & tasted amazing. We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"The service is really good; better than the food, actually. Tasted like the mushrooms in my entree were dehydrated. That was really disappointing."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here 3 times and truly enjoy it. The vodka sauce is AMAZING.  I gave it 4 stars because one time we went, the server was having a tough time remembering things and seemed very overwhelmed. She was a great person though. Good chopped salad. Also, amazing peanut butter brownie dessert thing...yuuum"}
{"text":"Bravo is a pretty decent Italian place with the exception that they portions are small and the prices are a bit high. The taste / quality of this food is very comparable to an Olive Garden; but, it is 50% more expensive. If you are looking for good, quality Italian food at a reasonable price, stick to OG. This place will not knock your socks off but will leave a significant dent in your wallet!"}
{"text":"First time here and honestly, not the best. We had \"alright\" service from our waitress but the managers & front staff is poor service- we heard gossiping right from our table; & their food was alright- I wouldn't go back..."}
{"text":"The food is always good, the service was good too, the thing that I didn't like about it is that I saw that my appetizer was ready, and 3 waitress saw that and they didn't care abut it, because it wasn't for their table, until they saw one of the cooks that was going to bring us our appetizer one of the waitress decide to bring us our appetizer, we had the spinach dip, by the time we got our appetizer, the appetizer was cold. My husband order a salad and he had his salad after he got his meal, and we had our bread after they brought our meal too. Our server was busy, we understand that, but what we didn't like was that the other waitresses had the time to bring our staff because they were talking to each other and  didn't care about giving good service."}
{"text":"the soup and salads were good. one of us ordered a pizza. not good. to soggy and undercooked. don't let the what looked like a wood burning oven oven mislead you. my lagzana was also undercooked. the cheese was not melted but it used good ingredients

Please don't review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employees."}
{"text":"Went yesterday. Service was great. Our server was wonderful. We ordered a few drinks and a pasta for our 2 year old. The pasta was al dente. Couldn't order our meals as our daughter was being 2. But our server brought out dough for her to play with and a yummy complimentary dessert. Will definitely be back!!! Thank you Cesar for great service!!!"}
{"text":"Better than Brio! We love dinners here. Our waiter Bryan is always delivers pleasant service and makes the experience just as good as the food!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, service and atmosphere. Great addition to Galleria! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Good place!  I like the appetizers more than the main dishes.  The service is good, and friendly.  The atmosphere is noisy in the weekend.  The price is little high."}
{"text":"One of the worst service we have had in awhile last night.
Our server Saadia was downright impatient from the start and was rushing us with our orders that she kept on butting in and tellling us how we should order in sequence...I mean who does that???...even made face when my wife was trying to order for my daughter...She also kept turning around while we were still talking to her which was so off and rude
She then gave out to go boxes even if we were still trying to finish our meal and handed out our bill without us asking for it.
Granting it was Christmas Eve and maybe she was at the end of her shift and was in a rush to go home but still not a reason for her to be offensively impolite to us.
Place was not even full and saw only about 4-5 tables filled.
Didn't want to throw in the race card since we were Asians but really felt discriminated by her attitude towards us.
Not to mention food was salty and not as tasty as we have expected based from the reviews
I also kept the receipt as she even made a mistake in my bill and not even apologetic about it 
All in all...Horrible experience!
We should have just went to Brio
That one star is only because it's Christmas!"}
{"text":"It was a great dining experience. I loved the food the lobster bisque is amazing and my meal itself was hearty and delicious. I also had the most interesting take on a gimlet in my life. Totally recommend"}
{"text":"Visited this establishment on a Friday night after work with two other people. I called before to get us put on the wait list, so we did not have to wait for a table upon arriving. That comes in handy! The decor is very nice; very open and airy, with plenty of windows to let the natural light in. The menu is quite extensive for an Italian restaurant, with lighter fare, gluten free, and kids menus as well! The food is excellent. I chose the chicken and pesto spaghettini, as did another person in the party. The third person chose the chicken Milanese. Portions are very generous and you could easily take half home for leftovers. I split a bravo chopped salad with my friend, and we both enjoyed it. The desert menu---save room for their deserts!!--is mouthwatering. I ended up trying the warm chocolate peanut butter brownie (this is a single serving portion) that was TO DIE FOR!! 
The service could use some work--there were lulls in service where we were waiting for refills on drinks and the complimentary bread. All in all I was impressed with this new establishment and I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I am very fussy. Now I work in the mall and eat there constantly. Ate the fried shrimp dish at the bar menu. Wonderful, 5.00. Fast service. Then I ate their brunch menu eggs benedict were excellent. Sicillian omlet had speghetti sauce in it. Was shockedl but that was my one mistake. I am sicillian by the way. Just didn't expect sauce in my eggs. Anyway salmon salad is great. Italian dishes are wonderful too. Next trying sandwhiches. They look good in the pictures. Fast service. Polite waiters. Bend over backwards for you. I eat at the bar if I only have a short lunch. I cant get that quality at fast food for 5.00. Thats only at the bar though. Id like to sit at Bravos one day all day. I think they should have a buffet for me so I could do that."}
{"text":"The spaghetti and meatballs was a disaster. Super overcooked noodles, The sauce was spoiled and the meat balls had pieces of bone. Wont be back. But I must say the floor staff was very friendly and accommodating. This place is owned and operated by the Brio group of which i have never had a good experience. Food always tastes frozen or reheated."}
{"text":"My husband & I came in for lunch & Brian was our Server. He was exceptionally friendly & we really enjoyed having him wait on us. The atmosphere was warm, inviting & impeccably clean. We started out with the Minestrone Soup, which was fantastic & very flavorful. We both had chicken salads. The portions were great & tasted WONDERFUL. The chicken was sooo moist & bursting with flavor & the vegetables were grilled to perfection, not overly inundated with excessive oil or butter, which is challenging to find in restaurants now a days, since my husband & I are very health conscious individuals. Our waters & coffee were never empty & Brian checked on us several times to make sure we were content with everything. My husband & I will DEFINITELY be returning to this establishment in the near future!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, good food, great addition to the mall! Awesome service our waitor was Jordan he was well informed professional and quite entertaining, will definately come back!"}
{"text":"food wasn't bad. came out very late and our server had only our table of two and a table of about 10. didn't get a drink refill until asked for one AFTER the entree came out and I finished my drink before the appetizer came out. we saw our server about 3 times the whole meal which I believe is definitely not enough since there were about 4 other parties in the whole restaurant. won't be coming back sadly."}
{"text":"I was here couple times before and loved the place, thus today decided to order food for pickup / to go. Their NY steak was quite good, but unfortunately their Pasta Bravo was a huge disappointment for my wife! This might've been the most plain, ordinary pasta we've ever had, with only a hint of grilled chicken and mushrooms described in the menu, and barely any sauce. Just plain and dry, something you'd expect at a lowest grade restaurant. We're actually in disbelief and not sure if we'll forget this bad experience easily."}
{"text":"This was our first time at Bravo! And it was delicious! I started with the chopped salad, which tastes just like Brio's (they are sister restaurants). Then I had the mushroom ravioli and it was soooo good. The grape tomatoes on top tasted very fresh, the mushrooms were soft and light and the cream sauce was perfect. My husband had the sausage sacchiti (pasta purses filled with cheese) and he was very happy with it. We also got the seasonal dessert - lemon blueberry tart in creme angelise-  it was also very delicious- get it! 

Our server (Brian) had to be the friendliest server I've ever had. He very much reminded us of Jerry from parks and recreation. Always smiling, made great recommendations, helpful around our baby, he even brought a tablecloth to cover the stroller when we asked! 

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Food was great but service was not what we expected. Our server named Michelle was not knowledgeable with the menu, lack of personality and lack of a sense of urgency.  Our server made us most likely not to return. For being a slow night, service should be excellent especially since they just opened this week."}
{"text":"We tried this place for the 1st time in September on my birthday, and we loved it. The food was great, the drinks were great, overall the whole experience was great. Will be visiting again!"}
{"text":"I would give a lower rating if Yelp would allow it. I took my sister there for her birthday. Glass was in our salad and her mouth was cut...blood everywhere."}
{"text":"As I was walking in I noticed the strange similarities of this compared to Romano Macaroni Grille---- the dress attire of the wait staff and the bread/oil combo upon seating. Yes indeed it is the same company...along with PFCHANGS. So the monopoly is on here at Summit Mall. Haha
Anyhow. 
The service was OK. The waiter was pleasant and attentive. .until it got busy. ..the food all was good.
 My salad didn't merit a $15 price tag though. I got the Mediterranean with Salmon added and it was very sparse on everything in my opinion. 
The salmon was very fishy tasting and it was mostly mixed greens. I know they advertise zuchinni, feta cheese and other veggies.....but they shouldn't call this a \"Mediterranean \" salad by any means. It wasn't really. I was disappointed in it. 
The other diners got better dishes and I would visit here again just based on that. 
I just don't recommend the salad I got today. 
:))"}
{"text":"Rosie, our waitress, asked us if it was our first time at Bravo in the Galleria mall. We said yes. Soon after, she brought us a complementary of fried mozzarella ravioli. It was fabulous!! The bread was an herb bread that was absolutely delicious. Lunch could have easily stopped there. My wife and I each had a salad. Both were very tasty. The setting is bright because of all of the windows, a cheerful atmosphere. Fantastic experience."}
{"text":"3.5 stars...

I really was not wowed by this place, I found it a bit better than the average 3 stars.

The four star attributes about this place were the chilled salad on chilled plates, the warm herbed bread and sun dried tomato dipping oil. The latte was creamy and the tiramisu was rich. Our server was attentive and friendly and the atmosphere was welcoming.

What brought my score down was the ravioli. I didn't wow me. The edges were a bit stiff and the cheese filling was ok. The presentation though was very nice.

So I may try something tomato based next time I come in, since I'm always looking for meal alternatives while shopping."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful lobster bisque! One of the best I've had. Love chicken marsala. This time tried the speghatini with meatballs. Huge flavorful meatball, excellent marinara sauce. Atmosphere is chic and classy but they don't act like they're stooping down to serve you. Seated immediately and staff very attentive. Too bad we we're too full to get dessert. Must try the lobster bisque!"}
{"text":"We had dinner there last night.  We enjoyed our food, especially the pizza it was very delicious.
The service was really good,, our waiter Tim was great.
Very affordable and with a lovely ambiance."}
{"text":"Waiting for the folks again, I decided to try Bravo again for the third time.  As I walked in at around 1:30pm today, 11.10.16, the hostess never greeted me just turned her head like she was having a bad day.  I thought about turning around, but instead headed to a friendlier bar.  

Yul, name on the receipt, was my bartender.  Quick & super nice as I got an very important phone call so was pretty much on the phone from then on & still placed my order w/o interruptions.  The bar area was empty once again.  I usually wouldn't be on the phone like this either, but had Yul pick my 'pick two' salad & pasta entree.  He picked the chopped salad, which I always get at Brio.. it was good.  I picked through it, but not crisp lettuce at all.  Not like Brio.  And the linguine carbonara, which I love peas so that was good too, a little on the soupy sauce side.  Good is not great.  

Service was great this time & he seemed like he enjoyed being there too, not like I've witnessed before w/ their employees.  Will give them an extra star for service.  And one for the tasty olive oil w/ pepperoni & focaccia bread that I could've just eaten as an entree."}
{"text":"Went here last weekend. It's a family restirant and was a good place to go to for lunch. The service was great. They actually gave us a free appetizer just to try. Between our two appetizers and bread we didn't eat much of out main dish there but took it home and it was great later. Will defiantly be coming here again."}
{"text":"I got the chicken Bryan. Massive portion! Good food at an affordable price. The service was great, our server was very patient with us."}
{"text":"Food is delicious but I would prefer to not have a long hair cooked inside my meatball...."}
{"text":"WHAT HAPPENED TO THE GLUTEN FREE OPTIONS?  This is the main reason we dine here and when we went for dinner with friends on 11/5/17 several of their (formerly excellent) gluten free options had been removed from the menu. Sadly, this eliminates the attraction to dine at bravo since the remaining GF selections leave me few options. Too bad because we used to love coming here. Adding the chicken selections back on to the menu & maybe some bread & pizza considerations would be appreciated."}
{"text":"Had wonderful first visit! The cucumber gimlet is delicious and refreshing. Donnelle offered excellent service and gave us a free flat bread for being first timers."}
{"text":"This is my first time here and I love it! Food is delicious service is great and didn't take long at all to get my food, only one think I wasn't to happy with is the water they served tap water lol but not a big deal, definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, service and food! The manager on duty tonight was so friendly and gave us great insight into the menu. Our server, Rolando, was very attentive. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I attended a business dinner here with about 15-18 associates, we were seated in a back room that had been set-up prior to our arrival with four round tables, with service for six at each which provided a very comfortable dining experience.. We arrived a few minutes before our reservation time and were promptly seated and drink orders were taken as our group arrived in small groups a few minutes apart.The restaurant provided us with two assigned servers who were very proficient and other members of the staff joined in as needed to help serve the drinks and keep the bread and olive oil fully stocked on all the tables. The entire staff was very professional and outgoing and provide us with the best possible service the entire evening. As you can imagine as the evening wore on the demands on the staff only increased, I think our group for the most part is somewhat professional but rarely did our servers get a break since all the cocktails and appetizers were impossible to synchronize it was apparent from the start this staff is used to this kind of service and were well trained and equipped to handle anything this group threw at them.  

All the main entrée orders were taken at the same time by both servers and each offered substitutions to ensure each dish was made to our exact liking and by the sounds of it very few of us ordered straight off the menu without special request. All the food arrived at the same time fresh and warm and I heard no complaints from anyone, this is almost unheard of with a group of this size, no mistakes from the kitchen, no one having to wait while others were starting to enjoy their entrées. I have to give credit to the entire staff and management of this restaurant... I think I can speak for everyone in our group Well Done Bravo!!!

I started with a few Ketel One Martinis, up, shaken cold, a little dirty with cheese stuffed olives, as simple as I think this is to make, that's not always the case but the bartender executed these perfectly.

Italian Wedding Soup - This was a perfect example of how this traditional soup should be put together, a rich broth that tasted like it had simmered for hours, all the ingredients were tender and full of flavor. YUM!

Grilled Pork Chops - I was a little hesitant to order this dish because some restaurants struggle with these, they are usually under-cooked to ensure they aren't dried out or charred and tough, I think my dish had everyone at my table drooling after seeing they were fork tender and full of flavor, I gave a few samples out to a few who commented they were thinking of ordering the same but because of past experiences that didn't turn out so well they decide to go with something safe. 

GF Penne Pasta - Amazingly done, perfect texture, the sauce was delicious and the ratio of sauce to pasta couldn't have been any better anywhere. I really enjoyed this.

This dish also came with broccoli but the pork chops and pasta left no room for this. Sadly I don't think I even tasted it. Over-all Bravo exceeded our expectations and made our evening out a very enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"I have gone many times to the Brio in Legacy Village, and have gotten the Shrimp Mediterranean a couple times in the past. I placed a to go order today and got less than half the amount of food I've always gotten, so I'm not sure whether it's because of the location or the fact that the order was to go. But I'm super disappointed. Will continue to drive a half hour to get to the one in Lyndhurst, instead of this one that is down the street."}
{"text":"Let me start of with their excellent service, Juan Carlos our server is outstanding! I will definitely  ask him when we come back. Now the ambience is impressive, high ceilings, white linen tables,  and gorgeous french windows. 
Food was really good I had the pasta de diavolo with shrimp and pizza Margherita. Big portions plates and their complementary bread with sundried tomato olive oil is really really good. We will totally come back!"}
{"text":"Wow. I sat at the today, and was served at the bar, by the Bartender with the beard. He was really nice, quick and professional. The food I ordered was delicious. The meat ball and the crispy ravioli was amazing. I am so bringing my sister here who lives out of state, next time she visits. Thank you for the service and for being a great support at today's Charity Event."}
{"text":"The short and sweet of it:

I can't speak on the rest of the menu of Bravo Cucina Italiana, pastas and whatnots...But, I just had a pretty damn good burger which they have as part of their brunch menu. It was the Candied bacon, egg burger with a tomato jam thing...bomb! 

It was a nice afternoon so, we sat outside on the patio. Service and servers were very attentive,helpful and kept the Arnold Palmer's flowing. Also had the Calamari Fritte app, quite tasty...lightly breaded, cooked perfectly and served with a sweet marinara and a creamy horseradish sauce .

So, I took a rain check on the pasta...But if it's as good as that burger, I'll be back."}
{"text":"I got the mama's lasagna mmmmm! Best lasagna I've ever had. Great service, friendly waitress, the food was done fairly quick."}
{"text":"Good food - see my photos. Service was not the best, though. We didn't feel a warm welcome, more of a \"you sure you're eating here?\" vibe from the hostess who seated us. Our server was okay, checked on us and served refills without trouble except that she had her fingers inside the glass when she took it away.  With the place so fancy looking we were expecting better service. Prompt food arrival and prompt check delivery, too."}
{"text":"--CLIFFSNOTES OF THE BELOW REVIEW: Super yummy food, awesome wine, not that intimate, miiiiildly pricey (but doable)--

I went here with my two kids, which is already a test of its own, but it was a very positive experience. The atmosphere is not very intimate because there are limited numbers of booths, so mostly it's tables. Way better for a restaurant's bottom line, though. The outdoor seating is very appealing. 

The bread before the meal was nice and not too much that it would spoil dinner - though my one-year-old kept opting for that instead of the chicken I gave him. Turd...

I got the chicken scaloppini and my 4-year-old got kids' spaghetti and an added meatball. The kids' podtion is the size of an adult plate of pasta, which is awesome, and the quality is just as delicious. However, the meatball cost an extra dollar. That sucked - but it was a huge meatball, too, so I get it.

My dish was phenomenal, and I was extremely impressed by how well-balanced it was. There are a ton of capers, tomatoes, mushrooms, multiple cheese varieties, plus the chicken and sauce. Capers can very easily overpower a dish, but the components here were all impressively complimentary of each other. It was straight up delicious.

The wine I had deserves its own paragraph. I had the 6oz Moscato with my dish. I was expecting just a mild white, but oooohhhhhhh boy was that yummy. I could have drank a bottle like it was juice and asked for more. Damn. Dangerous (in a good way)!

I didn't stay for dessert because I am single with kids and am poor. Plus it was bed time."}
{"text":"Went here for my sisters birthday and the service was AMAZING. The food was pretty good, your typical Italian offerings but definitely worth the extra money compared to someplace like Olive Garden. Perfect for a date night or birthday type event."}
{"text":"OK our friends recommended this place. Last Tuesday I took my daughter and Grandbaby. Holy Cow... amazing! Brian, our server was the absolute best... First class all the way. Today we went back again, of course with Brian. The Shrimp Napoli is beyond delicious. The lunch special again was superb, Pasta Yoladina ??? So good, I had it for the second time. The lasagna is forget about it. Lobster bisque... WOW. BUT my one year old grandbaby loves the bread, shrimp, kids chicken Parmesan and Brian. very kid friendly. This is such. Find!!! Did I mention the shrimp and bread??? OMG we finally have a five star Italian place in our neighborhood. Also, the Peach Sangria, get the pitcher, is so good... Kids get pizza dough to play with. Superb!!! Go Brian!"}
{"text":"Have been here several times for happy hour & it was great for the most part. Decided to try it for dinner. Completely disappointed & may not go back for happy hour because of it. Started off with the bread being hard & not fresh. All the time for happy hour it was fresh & hot. Ordered calamari & spinach dip for apps. Spincah dip itself was good but the flatbread that it comes with was hard & not soft. Calamari was absolutely horrible. No taste in the batter & it was rubbery. Had calamari the day before @ Claim Jumper & it was amazing. Ordered the shrimp scampi for my main. So much red chili flake in it it burned my lips off. When it wasn't burning could tell there was no seasoning to it what-so-ever. Certainly no salt in the pasta water. Dinner mate ordered a medium rare steak & it came super rare. Waiting for waitress to come back so we could send it back took forever so finally got up & flagged down someone else. Rest of party was almost done eating by the time it came back cooked to medium. I ordered the pumpkin bread pudding which was the highlight of the night. IMO the only good item I had all night. Just all around bad experience. Like I said was really disappointed as I have been there several time for happy hour & they have all been pretty good."}
{"text":"Ok for a mall. 

The place is slicker inside than you would expect for a mall restaurant. 

The food was ok, but not amazing. The chicken parm was lackluster and the pastas were pretty generic, albeit tasty thanks to all the cream! The salads were actually pretty decent."}
{"text":"I had happy hour bunco for 12 girls and everyone loved the food and drinks were good too! Been there for lunch and dinner numerous times and it's always been very good."}
{"text":"All right, a lot to say about this place. As you can tell by the 5 star rating, it's all good things! 

First, Rebecca was our server and was easily one of the best servers I've ever had (and I'm a server!). We went during lunch time and they weren't very busy, but right off the bat she was extremely pleasant and knowledgeable. She explained their whole menu (we'd never been here before) and answered all questions. Who knows if she thought we were annoying or not because she really knows how to work for her money (good for you, Rebecca). 

After we ordered our starter salads and soup, she came out with an appetizer of their margherita flatbread COMPLIMENTARY. I don't know if they just had an extra one or they messed up somewhere, but it was amazing and such a kind gesture. 

I ordered a small Caesar salad (no croutons), my dad had the caprese salad and my mom the lobster bisque. ALL GOOD. The caprese was probably the least memorable, but that lobster bisque- I remember like it was yesterday (it was about a week ago), it was creamy and they weren't short handed with the lobster pieces. 

Mom ordered the pasta woozie- very good with fresh spinach! Dad had the pasta bravo- perfect al dente rigatoni and the sauce was good! I had the lobster ravioli alla vodka- amazing sauce and the ravioli had just the right amount of chewiness. 

We all took our pasta dishes in a box and couldn't even think about dessert because of how stuffed we were! But we'll definitely be back, and Rebecca I'm sorry, but we're asking for you :) (and I hope everyone requests you and you make a bunch of money because any server who puts on the perfect presentation like how you did, you deserve it!)"}
{"text":"We decided to visit this restaurant due to numerous recommendations from employees in the nearby mall. We were not disappointed. Had a wonderful, tasty pre-fixed dinner at a very reasonable cost. The regular menu has many wonderful choices as well. The service was superb! Highly recommend you try Bravo. Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Pasta diavolo (I ordered gluten free) was delish in salad/pasta lunch combo. Shrimp cooked to perfection. Liked lunch so much we returned for happy hour same day! Super value, great staff, good food, outdoor seating if you like. Recommend highly."}
{"text":"So the first restaurant from the expansion of Galleria Mall aka The Plaza at Galleria is now open! Im lovin this place and all I've tried so far here at the new Bravo! Cucina Italiana was soup and salad!

Lobster Bisque and Bravo! Chopped Salad with shrimp was what I got since I didn't want anything to heavy to eat before I did some serious shopping.

The lobster bisque was thick, creamy, and rich tasting, but not rich in calories!!! UNDER 500 cal!!  And the chopped salad was equally delish especially with the shrimp (xtra item). The plump, buttery shrimp made the salad though and is worth the additional charge for it. My whole meal was under 1000 cal and worth every cent. 
 
The menu that I scanned over had some entrees I look forward to try soon! There's a different menu offered during lunch, dinner and weekend brunch. From what I can tell, sandwiches are available during lunch only. Weekend brunch adds breakfast items like Berries & Cream French Toast and Sweet Potato Hash & Eggs!...mmmm

Kids menu available too.  The toddler who picked out chicken fingers meal liked her food. It came with a bowl of fresh berries too.

Ohh!! The complimentary ROSEMARY FOCACCIA bread with the olive oil dipping sauce!!! YUMMM to the second power!!  

The setting here is just gorgeous classy,and relaxed. Love patio with the mature trees surrounding the area. This place is perfect to dine al fresco when it's not a windy day. There are a lot of tables in the dining areas but spaced far apart enough so you don't feel like someone is invading your space. 

For a brand new place open less than a week, they sure have their act together.  Service was great! Staff was friendly. 

Things to note: You can make table reservations online! http://www.bravoitalian.com/reservations.html

Sign up and take advantage of their rewards card system. 5 visit credits of $7.95 or more, 6 visit will be $10 off! Im sure your server will explain it to you.

Yes this Italian chain's sister restaurant is Brio Tuscan Grille. The slight similarities are the design/decor. Differences Bravo! more family style and family friendly.  Prices a tad lower too. 

Access to this place is on Sunset Rd side.  Entrance from outside mall only since the Plaza at Galleria Mall is open air part of the mall. If you are in the mall go down the east hallway by Kohls. That was my only complaint, because there was no signs directing to where this place is inside the mall. We ended up at the new Larsens on the upper level. There is no wheelchair access outside  (to lower level)  either that I know of.

They close one hour after main mall closes at 10pm. Sundays till 9."}
{"text":"We decided to try out Bravo for dinner with some friends.  We made reservations but after walking in I realized it wasn't necessary during the week.  We were greeted and seated immediately.  

Our service here wasn't great.  Our waitress was a little off.  I had ordered a salad and she asked if I wanted a salad on the side.  Strange. During our meal it seemed as if she was avoiding our table.  We had to flag her down a few times for refills and the bill.  

A complimentary Rosemary bread basket is brought to the table.  Our first basket was over-warmed so the bread was really hard.  The new basket was much better.  Just enough Rosemary gave this bread thumbs up from me.  For my meal I chose the Romano crusted chicken salad.  The chicken had a weird flavor with it also being dry.  I wasn't too thrilled about it.  We had also split the chicken spinach and bacon pizza.  This was a winner.  Delicious combination of flavors with a great crust.  I'd definitely recommend ordering this again.  

Bravo was ok and I'd probably go back to try it again.  I just wasn't overly impressed."}
{"text":"Quick review: food was tasty, fresh and service was excellent.

Long review: ambiance is reminiscent of the Cheesecake Factory-great lighting and open. 

Food: I ordered the Roman salad which had Parmesan style fried chicken breast on top-the chicken was moist, tasty and came with two generous portions. Also on the salad was bacon, hard-boiled egg and freshly made ranch. Complimentary bread is soft and served with a tasty garlic oil that tastes like pizza, if you can imagine. My husband ordered the beef ravioli which he enjoyed.

Service: Jeraldine was so attentive, personable (we had such a pleasant conversation with her during dinner) and helpful. She went above and beyond honoring a yelp deal coupon, even though it was outside of the hours it's offered (sausage and ricotta stuffed banana peppers topped with mozzarella and tomato sauce-spicy but so tasty!). And even though my salad came back with dressing tossed in when I ordered it on the side, she apologized and quickly had a fresh one remade and brought out."}
{"text":"We were meeting friends in the area of the Galleria Mall and wanted a dinner where we could sit and talk in a nice setting at a reasonable price. I had been to Bravo before and thought it would fit the bill.
Ambiance: Located on the outside of the mall, it is easy to get to with ample free parking. The decorating is best described as \"Brio Lite.\" If you are familiar with the Brio chain of restaurants, this is the less well endowed kid brother. Overall, very pleasant - nothing too extravagant. The tables are very nicely spaced. the night we came, it was not crowded so no problem having a conversation, even at a fairly large round table for 6. Overall, a 4 rating for ambiance.
Service: the service was outstanding. Within a few minutes of our sitting, Jason, our server, was at the table to answer any questions about the menu and take our drink orders. Very friendly and welcoming. A few minutes after that, the food runner brought a small basket of tasty bread. Throughout the meal, the service was attentive. Our water glasses never got below half full. Service would rate a 5.
Food: I ordered the jumbo shrimp. The kitchen gets bonus points for presentation. The dish consisted of about six or seven shrimp laid out on the bed of or orzo and farro with some feta and roasted pepper thrown in. The taste was truly delicious. My only gripe was the name of the dish. It really should've been called average size shrimp rather than jumbo. My wife had the Porkchop. She said it was good but not great. Our friends had the grilled mahi. They felt that the preparation was a little spicier than they would've liked.
Value: The entrees were each between $17 and $22. You could add a side salad (very generous size) for an extra $4.25. Excellent value for what you pay. Overall, a strong 4 star rating."}
{"text":"We came here a few days ago ,trying to figure out where to eat at and we settled for Bravo ,it was the best choice.The atmosphere  was great the food was great and best of all the staff really took good care of us!!! I will definitely  be coming back with my husband  and when family comes into town,this will be our new spot!!"}
{"text":"Decided to check out the new place in town and was VERY happy here!  The food is LARGE and SO GOOD.  I had the Bravo pasta which was creamy and very full of flavor.  The lasagna was very good as well.  My fav was their calamari which they serve with two types of sauce... the white one is much better then the red! 
Beautiful atmosphere and friendly staff.  Go give this new place a try!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and the food is just amazing. While their salt encrusted NY Strip might've been the best one I've ever had, and I've been to tons of high end restaurants. I'd consider their steak legendary, because it could just as well be a subject of legends. Bravo is very reasonably priced and everything I've had so far was top notch. Very glad I found this place, just not sure if the 5-star reviews aren't going to make me wait longer next time."}
{"text":"This will probably be our last time visiting BRAVO!. I've eaten here a handful of times over the course of a year or so and each time it's become increasingly disappointing. Today's visit may be the straw that breaks the camel's back. It being Father's Day, I decided to give the restaurant another chance since my dad is a fan of the place. Surprisingly, it wasn't terribly busy. The hostess sat us immediately in a booth by the kitchen. We were greeted promptly, however...our waitress failed to build any sort of rapport with us throughout the entire meal, giving off a \"strictly business\" vibe. I refuse to give her name because, being a server myself, I don't rat out other servers. We were given drinks and table bread. Now, for their bread, I've ALWAYS been disappointed by their bread. It's a sad, lukewarm row of bland, (sometimes stale) pull-apart breadsticks. I've never been impressed with it tasting like it came out of Wal-Mart's bakery, so I knew what I was getting into. The waitress then recommended the Crispy Shrimp Napoli as an appetizer. It was quite tasty, although not remotely worth its $12.99 price tag for the amount received. I always order the Inslata Della Casa as it's (usually) one of the best salads I've ever had...and although it was still the same great salad, it was significantly smaller and they COVERED it with parmesan cheese which essentially caused every other bite to taste like I was eating a gym sock... I decided on my go-to, the Pasta Bravo...but I noticed the ingredients changed since I ordered it last. I decided to take a gamble and get the revised one anyway. My father decided on the Chicken Marsala and my significant other ordered the Pasta Fra Diavolo. He asked the waitress if he could add some ricotta on top of his pasta and she told him no because they don't carry it...when the last three times we've been there, they've added ricotta. Maybe they no longer carry it...but what kind of Italian restaurant doesn't carry ricotta cheese??

The next problem was that the entrees themselves took almost thirty minutes to come out. I'm in no way impatient in restaurants whatsoever and judging from not-terribly-busy dining room, yet the odd panicky scrambling of the line staff and cooks, I came to the conclusion that they were somewhat understaffed. When the food DID finally come out, we were offered grated cheese to which we all said \"yes.\" My father seemed to enjoy his meal, which was awesome. My pasta was absolutely bland. It needed something...some kind of seasoning. It was NOTHING to rave about. My S.O. found his pasta to be the exactly the same and on top of that, he watched his food sit in the window about five minutes ahead of my father's and mine, so his was lukewarm-to-cold by the time it reached the table. Both of us sort of forced down about half, after which combining it in one to-go box. My dad seemed pleased with his meal, so that's good at least. The waitress came and went, but very:

\"Anyone need anything else?\"
\"Uh...no, I think we're go-\"
*walks away*

My father then orders a few additional sides to take home with him that takes an additional twenty minutes (it's mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus) and my S.O. wanted another Diet Coke that he never recieved. The waitress returns with the dessert menu and to my absolute disbelief they REMOVED the cannoli dip from their menu. I was shocked... In my opinion, that incredible dessert was one of the things that MADE this restaurant. I about had it at this point... We all split a tiramisu that tasted like it was out of a box COVERED with cocoa powder causing me to do a \"Cinnamon Challenge\" a few times. After all is said and done...a whopping $111 for three beverages, one appetizer, three entrees, and one dessert. NOT worth it.

Such a shame where BRAVO! is headed. I absolutely LOVED this place when I first visited it. Now...I'm not sure if I'll ever be returning. BEAUTIFUL atmosphere...but when it's countered with rising prices, falling quality, and mediocre service...it puts in perspective just how many other authentic Italian restaurants are out there just begging for the trying.

BRAVO!? More like BRAV-NO."}
{"text":"Server was Great! All the food had terrific flavor.  Lasagna was only 2 layers and I think the presentation would be better thicker. The bread is the best table bread I've had in a while.  Great choice for dinner."}
{"text":"A new friend Roger took us out to eat at Bravo by the Mall.

The location and venue is first class. The server was upbeat, knowledgable and willing to help. We had a party of six and she stayed on top of our needs.

I ordered Spaghetti and Meatballs with a salad. The salad was fresh and crisp with a great presentation. The Spaghetti and Meatballs were very good. The noodles appeared to me homemade. My wife had Pasta Fra Diavolo with Chicken. It was a tad off with the Chicken just a little dry. Everyone else in our party raved about their dishes. 

So my meal and experiences were 5-Stars. My wife's was 4-Stars. There is no way to give 4  1/2. So for now they're 4-Star good.

Give them a try--You'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"Bravo was relatively empty for a Friday night, and we were seated right away. Menu has basic Italian selections and the children's menu did not disappoint. The calamari appetizer was cooked perfectly and the horseradish dipping sauce was dreamy. 
Lobster ravioli left a lot to be desired without pronounced lobster meat, and the sauce would overwhelm lobster any day. 
Chicken piccata was delicious. The lemon caper sauce was perfectly balanced between sharp vinegar & smooth butter with the capers being the star. It would have been a 5 star meal if it was not luke-warm. Herbed linguini side dish was piping hot, but chicken was cool. Bummer."}
{"text":"Same company as Brio although not as good as Brio. It's not bad considering its at the galleria mall..but everything I ordered was salty. Even my daughters pasta with tomato sauce. Overall would come back if I had to spend the day at the mall..but would not drive out of my way to eat here"}
{"text":"Excellent food, service, and prices.  The three of us were very satisfied.  Walking in we were immediately seating by friendly hostess.  Waiter was attentive and aware if anything was needed.  Waiter brought us refills before we asked for them; a sign of a great waiter.  Food was very good with good portions and the prices were very reasonable."}
{"text":"We are locals, go there at least once a week. We are seniors and usually share our main dish. Saadia was our server last night. All other servers always have the chef divide our meal and it is served on separate plates for us. We ordered the strip steak, salad, soup desert, and drinks with a cost of $52.00 dollars When the meal was delivered the meal was served on one plate with a very small extra plate and one steak knife for us to share. The steak was so tough we could not eat it. When we told her, her statement was, well you did order it medium rare. The menu has been reduced, prices have increased, we may not return, hope management reads yelp."}
{"text":"The best part of our experience was our server! He was attentive and had a great sense of humor. My only critique is the he practice wine pouring. On almost every refill, a small amount of wine dripped down my glass. It might not sound like a big deal but red wine drops are dangerous. 

The food was just ok. The bread was a little tough. I had the Spicy Scallop Marinara. It was ok but I am almost positive the scallops were frozen. I enjoyed the vegetables and sauce though. Personally, I like Brio better than Bravo."}
{"text":"My and my husband have been very curious about this place for a while now so we said let's go why not! When we walked in we were greeted very kindly by the host and sat as us at our table and said enjoy your lunch with a great smile. Everything was going great until we got our Waitress her name was Gisela B. Very cold unfriendly lady with no smile or customer service personality. Me and my husband felt very pressured and uncomfortable from then on. Anytime I told her I had a question I just felt very pressured and nervous to ask anything about the menu items because again it's my first time there so I don't know how this place works and how their food is made and what the extra items that come with the entree. We ordered the pepperoni cheese dip which was amazing! Then we ordered our lunch combo which was the lobster bisque which again was AMAZING! I got the balsamic chicken and my husband had the lasagna. Our waitress never came around our table to ask if we were doing ok and she never asked if we needed anything else or refills on our drinks. When we were finished with our food and needed boxes we waited and waited sitting there looking around like okayyyyy. Well this very very nice and polite gentlemen named Devonte if I remember correctly noticed us and came to our table and asked if there was something he can help us with and he offered to take our plates and box them up for us with a great attitude and a smile. So to sum this all up the food was amazing but our service was very very horrible and uncomfortable. What made us feel good was how this young gentleman came and helped us out. Needless to say we usually tip very well so even tho he was not our waiter he still got a little something for helping us out. I hope next time we go because we didn enjoy the food we get another waitress because she made the experience not worth while."}
{"text":"I have been here about 4 times now...  this is a very decent italian place.  A little pricey I think for some of the dishes.  Some dishes are large such as the lasagna whereas others are pretty small and pricey like the lobster raviolis.  Appetizers are pretty good.  Drinks are a little expensive."}
{"text":"This is our new favorite Italian place in LV!! Love the ambiance and the food of course was excellent!! the Shrimp Nappoli, Chicken Flatbread, caprese salad, Lasagna, and Sausage Tortellini was amazing then to end it with desert Cannoli Crumble yummy in our tummies if you're in the mood for italian this is the spot and to make it even better our waitress bekah she was just so friendly and always made sure our drinks were never low. Thanks again for an amazing dinner :)"}
{"text":"This restaurant can be an unpleasant experience if you get the waitress, Saadia. We really regret sitting in her section. She not only has a attitude, is rude, and impatient. She collects plates without asking. People are not even done with their food. She piles the plates on top of each other, and hands back to you when you tell her that you're not done. Really? When my dish has touch the bottom of the another plate? Does she know hygiene?I wonder if she is even trained to do this job. She does not really want to do her job here.  She tries to  cut corners in her job. On a separate occasion when I came here, I asked to get some fresh grated cheese and she gave me take out dried cheese. She claims it is the same cheese. We eat here often, we know our food. She is lazy and unwilling to help. To avoid having an unpleasant time here, where you have to spend time arguing with your server on simple requests, do not sit in Saadia's section. She will make you sad like her name.  Servers at the restaurant no longer have name tags on their uniform. However, she can be distinguished by her heavily braided hair, black complexion and attitude."}
{"text":"I've been to Bravo three times now and have enjoyed the food each time. Very good Italian food for a price that's slightly more, but not much more, than you would find at Olive Garden. I would like to see them add a little more to their menu options. Adding some classics like Chicken Parm would be a great start. Overall, though, very good food for a fairly reasonable price. I'm a fan."}
{"text":"We were looking for a nice Italian restaurant and my husband suggested trying Bravo. I hate going anywhere near the mall on the weekends but went anyway and we are so glad we did. Right from the get go we were greeted warmly by the hostess and told her in passing that it was our first visit. EVERY server we encountered from that point on welcomed us and thanked us for coming. I can't remember the last time I had such great (customer) service. The food is delicious and authentic as well. Their Italian Wedding soup is delicious ....the fresh bread is warm and so very good. The main course is a nice portion as well. To say that we will be going back soon is a given. Join their rewards club and you start getting offers immediately. We were just 
 blown away by the whole experience....and it will not break the bank. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Located in the Galleria at Sunset. Came here on a weekday night and it wasn't very busy.  They just happened to have a summer special 3 course, where we got a soup, main course, and dessert. 

We had to pay extra for our lobster bisque. It had good flavor but they had shrimp instead of lobster. I would recommend the pasta fra diavolo with shrimp, which had a good level of spiciness to it.  We also tried their Romano crusted chicken salad which was way too overdressed for my liking. Next time I'll ask for the dressing on the side.  

I was disappointed with our cannoli crumble that we got. It tasted like whipped cream with chocolate chips. Would give this 3.5 stars for ok service, inexpensive casual dining, and large portions. We still want to come back and check out their happy hour menu."}
{"text":"We enjoyed a late lunch here! Had the pasta Yandolino off the lunch specials menu. Very good and full of flavor. We ended our meal with the triple layer chocolate cake and espresso. Very good!! Our waiter was great and made suggestions. Over all a good experience!"}
{"text":"(This was over Valentine's Day weekend.)

I've never had a bad meal whenever I've gone to Bravo. Normally I order the Pasta Bolognese, but this time I ordered a Special. It was Gnocchi with Beef. (That is NOT the official name, but I can't remember what the name was.) Imagine the most tender Pot Roast, with huge chunks of roasted carrot, caramelized onions, and mushrooms, swimming in a rich beef stew-like broth over pillow-y (i know, i know-it's not a word...work with me, people!) gnocchi. YUM! 

Our server was kind, funny, and accommodating and I thoroughly enjoyed my meal. We went towards the end of the night, so many people were leaving and it was quiet- JUST the way I like it. Add a nice glass of their house red, some great conversation, and a little snow to look at - perfection."}
{"text":"Love the food the atmosphere was great the food was really good the waitstaff is the best thing I would recommend this place"}
{"text":"The two times I have been here I have thoroughly enjoyed it.  The food is always great and the portions are always large.  The restaurant is very nicely decorated as well.  I love that it is close to me and that new places are finally coming to Henderson.  The second time I came though it was dead inside, with our party being the only ones there, even though it was during what I would assume to be busy hours, Sunday around 6:30.  Hopefully this place can sustain customers as I will definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Our waitress, Leah, was fantastic. She was attentive and accommodating. The food on the other hand was less than desirable. I ordered the balsamic chicken which came on a bed of vegetables and orzo.. I couldn't eat anything except for the chicken. It was SO salty. Salted to the point where it burned my tongue. We ordered broccoli as well - same thing, salt."}
{"text":"Nice place, clean, cozy, food good and well balance taste, I got served \"Angel hair\"rather than Linguine on my scampi. (Mod you might want to check menu). Server was professional attentive and clean looking. Appetizer, salad, scampi and beer $50 lunch was good the 1 star missing is due to cook and mod eating in front of guests. (Like a mom and pop join). But good food cold beer and yes will be back again..."}
{"text":"Stop in for lunch on the 4th with family, great dining experience n great service, prices are a bit high like Brio in Town Square on the strip, I prefer cheesecake over these two, great dining with great service also but always a  line, 15 min. Wait."}
{"text":"2 hungry patrons on New Years Eve- we stood by the entrance/exit waiting for a Host to seat us but after 20 minutes not one single Host did! Terrible. Not even customer service."}
{"text":"This was my 3rd visit and by far the best,probably because Manuel was our server. The best service so far. I was a bit worried because our last visit we had to flag down people to get drinks refilled. Not this time our glasses were never even near empty. So besides the amazing service the food was really very good. Highly recommend the spinach artichoke dip. We split a house salad. Which was cold and crisp. My Husband had the pasta Fra Diablo, he liked it but I think he liked mine better I had the pasta Bravo and it was sooo good. I think my only criticism would be the cheese grating oh my goodness it took forever and a lot of muscle for the poor lady who served us our entree. I told her they should get the crank grater. It would be so much easier. Management news flash diners like Parmesan on their pasta. This is not the place to try and save money with stingy cheese graters. I would definetly recommend Bravo. Hopefully you'll be as lucky as we were and get Manuel as your server."}
{"text":"Gluten free pasta was amazing !!!! I have never had such well made GF pasta. Thank you to James who gave my Mom the box to with. This was such a treat. Living in CO and returning home , I always have a hard time finding something to eat while dining out here. Thank you !"}
{"text":"I love Bravo. It's not fancy and service can be a little spotty at times (our server last night forgot to put in our app, which ended up showing up AFTER our dinner). I'm not going to hold it against them. They have good pizza, good pasta, and it's better than any food court find at the Galleria."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for a nice lunch after walking around the Galleria mall. We had the following:


Chicken, Spinach & Bacon Flatbread $8.49

Grilled Chicken & Candied Bacon Sandwich $11.49

Scallop Marinara $13.49

The flatbread was great. The bread was quite thin and crispy while I could taste all the ingredients also. My wife said her scallop dish was good, nice and spicy. I tasted it and the only thing was that the artichoke slices in the dish didn't need to be there. They were a little chewy and made the overall texture of the dish awkward. And by the way, the scallops were baby scallops and not those ones you see in fancy restaurants. My sandwich tasted good and the accompanying, well-seasoned sweet potato fries were probably one of the best fries I've tasted here in vegas. Note to yelpers: Don't order the chicken flatbread appetizer and chicken sandwich as they have basically the same ingredients. Overall, I'd say this was a nice experience."}
{"text":"I was shopping at the mall and I stopped to read the posted menu outside the restaurant. They had a special of shrimp scampi and a side salad for $10.99.  That was a great price so I had to try it.  Jennifer was my waitress and she was very nice and attentive.  I really enjoyed the food and next time I am at the mall, I will stop by and try a different dish."}
{"text":"Have eaten here a few times.  Food is pretty good.  Happy hour has a nice menu.   Service is good."}
{"text":"This place is going to be my go to place for when I feel like Italian food. I had the fettuccine with a real good meat sauce and my husband had a ravioli dish that was delicious too. We both had two really good salads with our meals too. Desert was the most unique and delicious cheese cake with a creme brûlée topping ( I know your thinking, \"what\"?, but trust me it was delicious). I highly recommend this place and the prices were really reasonable."}
{"text":"I needed to find an Italian place for my dad's birthday. I stumbled across this place. They have happy hour here, but in the bar area only. They were nice enough to let us sit in the dining room and still get happy hour since it was my dad's 92nd birthday and he couldn't climb up on the stools in the bar area. By checking in on here, we got a free happy hour appetizer and ordered the fried ravioli. It was actually pretty good. We also ordered a coupke of drinks. The white peach sangria is nice and refreshing. 

For dinner, we ordered the chicken parmesan, eggplant parmesan and the linguine carbonara. They were all delicious. Good size portions too. If you order the carbonara, order it with the fried egg. I never heard of anybody putting an egg on it, but they give you rhat option and it's actually really good. The bread they give you to snack on is good too. 

Lastly, since it was his birthday, they let him choose a dessert, lit a candle and brought it over. He got the creme brulee and it was so good. The staff was all super nice. Always came to check on us and make sure we were good on everything."}
{"text":"Nice Veal Parmesan, thanks to Erin for the tip and great service! She is a charter member of the staff and her professionalism shows and is appreciated!"}
{"text":"I usually wait for a couple of visits at the earliest before I write a review, but this place is great! Great food, great service, great atmosphere. If you're trying to decide on somewhere to eat, you can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Had the Grilled Salmon Salad for lunch today. Best choice hands down! Nicely grilled portion of Salmon topped with crispy potato strings. Dressing was a light vinaigrette with just the right amount. Our waitress was friendly and attentive; however the hostess was quite the opposite...even made a few weird faces as she sat my son and I down. Not sure what her problem was today but I just brushed it off and kept it moving. First time here and will be back for sure to try some of their other dishes!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Great location. Extremely nice service. However, limited vegan options. Also, others who didn't order vegan food also complained about everything else being bland. Also, prom selection menu is misleading. Several groups members believed that one of the salads would come with fries. This was not the case. Once again, great service. Staffers were attentive and water glasses were always full. Incredibly nice staff. Everything except the food was 5 Stars. We loved the offering of crayons."}
{"text":"Are you kidding me!!!?? The best food ever! I don't even write reviews but I had to stop midway thru my meal to do it! This is too yummy for the price. The atmosphere... The service.. FIVE STARS hands down! Wish I lived closer or there was another Bravo by my house."}
{"text":"Our food was tasty but the service not so much.  The one exception was the sous chef who checked in twice.

I had tilapia and chopped salad, my wife had  a chicken and pasta dish.  Both   were  very good for a chain. 

I would give them another chance."}
{"text":"You really really need to work on your service. This place is full of incompotent floor staff. Seriously Bravo? Seriously? All the best food in the world can't save you from this incompetence. I am a regular here no more."}
{"text":"Okay folks! I went back too Bravo for dinner today! We were doing the whole date entire day thing. Went to Cowabunga in the morning and relaxed in the lazy river as well as hung out on the lounge chairs. That was really awesome! Then we went to Bravo for our dinner. Before I start my review I do believe that the management here are stellar and want to do a great job. I think they really want their customers to be happy and really do try to make that happen. I am really upset about writing this review. I really wanted it to be five stars and disappointed because I'm not sure when I will be back again. The decor is very nice and the place is clean. We were seated really quickly and our server showed up promptly. He got our drinks and took our appetizer order and was back pretty quickly with the drinks and our appetizers came out in great time. We ordered the shrimp Nepoli and the pepperoni dip. The pepperoni dip dish was pretty good. It lacked pepperoni but the sauce and cheese was a good dip for the chips. Now the shrimp Nepoli was kind of a disaster. The shrimp was overcooked and a bit chewy and the sauce was a little salty. We ate the appetizers and we were still waiting for the server to show back up and take our dinner order. There was a 30 minute delay between the time we finished our appetizers and the time we actually received our dinner. Maybe he was super busy. It didn't seem that way to me but who knows. Our food showed up and looked good. My wife ordered the Romano crusted chicken salad. I ordered the eggplant parmesan and it came with noodles on the side. Let's start with the salad. My wife was not happy with the salad and took a bite of the chicken and pushed all three pieces to the side. I didn't taste it so I don't want to speak for her I just know that she wasn't very happy with it. The eggplant parmesan was burnt on one side and they tried to hide it  as they left the side that had the crispy Brown up and the blackened part down. If you look closely at my eggplant  Parmesan picture  and  make it bigger ,  you can look at the edges of the eggplant parmesan and see that it is burnt on the other side. I'm not sure how they cut the eggplant for the eggplant parmesan dish, but it seems to me that this was probably a prefabricated dish where they just fry it. The eggplant was almost invisible. It was mostly just batter with sauce and cheese and things like that on it. The sauce wasn't bad but when I want eggplant parmesan I truly want eggplant with it. That is supposed to be the star of the show. Eggplant thick-sliced with a nice light batter around it and finished in the oven with a little bit of sauce and parmesan cheese. The noodles seem to be overcooked boxed noodles. They too were a bit chewy. They were also a bit drenched in butter I think the noodles may have had a little bit of parsley sprinkled on them. Maybe this is the way the noodles dish is supposed to be made,
but I thought maybe they should have some lemon on it to cut the fat and give it some brightness. We were going to box up our food and take it with us as there was a lot left. We ended up not taking any of the leftovers which was basically three fourths of the food with us. I was hoping that as I left the restaurant I would then be able to not be upset and possibly have some positivity come through from this. But as I pondered this review it just kept getting worse in my mind and also in my wife's mind. Truly disappointed and hoping this comes across as a patron that loved this place once and even brought everybody that came from out of town to visit us to this establishment for dinner. I don't know if the product has changed or if the kitchen crew has changed but something is different and it's not for the good. I hope this is received as constructive. My apologies I hope you make it and things bounce back. Good luck Bravo!"}
{"text":"We had our rehearsal dinner at this Bravo location and it was one of the highlights of our wedding weekend! The staff was extremely easy to work with, starting with the reservation all the way through the service at the event. Picking the menu was very simple and easy, and the printed menu was cool to have for our guests and made dinner selections very easy. We had their large private room to ourselves, which was really special. They let us come by a few times before the event to scope it out. And we also had access early in that day to drop off things like gifts/cake so we didn't have to bring them with us that night. We were able to control the music and the air for our own room. And we could even close/open the curtains to make it more private or not. Our party was for about 24 people, and when we first sat down, the tables were a little crowded. They brought us extra tables and set them up without even disturbing the dinner. The service was 5 stars throughout, they even cut up and served a cake we brought ourselves. Our guests kept talking about how delicious the food was, too. Really special, and a great way to kick off our wedding weekend!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to check out the new concept Brio Coastal Kitchen. The atmosphere has a nice coastal vibe. Service is great and the staff was friendly. The menu has nice options from small plates, salads, seafood, sandwiches, pasta and gluten free options. 

We started our meal with Buffalo Cauliflower, meatballs & polenta, prosciutto & burrata toast and whipped ricotta toast. The cauliflower was great they were cut into nice steaks topped with gorgonzola and a nice spicy buffalo sauce. The meatballs were flavored great and were nice and tender. The polenta was creamy, I didn't really care for the tomato marsala sauce, it tasted similar to bbq sauce. Both of the toasts were amazing. The burrata and the whipped ricotta were perfect. My wife had the Brussels sprouts salad with salmon. She absolutely loved the salad and the salmon was great as well, the only downside for her was the salmon was under cooked. I ordered the shrimp & grits. The smoked gouda polenta was a great touch, nice and creamy. The shrimp were seasoned and cooked perfectly. My only complaint was that it had way to much cream sauce and not enough grits. Overall great experience and would definitely return."}
{"text":"Went there to pick up my sons shoes at the Vans store which was amazing to hold them longer than needed. Best customer service and great food!!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and excellent food!!! This was my first time at this restaurant and it definitely won't be the last.   The server (Tyler) was pleasant and very attentive.  The manager (Kristy) came by our table to make sure we were satisfied with the food and the service.  We were very happy with our first visit to this restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"It's a beautiful restaurant with an  outdoor patio.  Had a girls date (3 pre-tweens and 2 adults), this restaurant fit our group perfectly.  As the girls said \"this place is fancy\". The kids menu includes a build your own pasta plus many other options, they were huge plates at a great price!  I had the lasagna...  yummy, a smaller béchamel lasagna with a small amount of ricotta/ meat, it was delicious.  I loved it!  My friend had the scampi pasta,  it was lemony but she wanted more spice, but was happy with it.  Definitely a great value for the quality/size of food!"}
{"text":"I'm not yelpin yuppy like the rest of the people here that write a 500 page review on pizza and tattle tale on a restaurant, so I'll just say this.
Great prices 
Great food 
Great service
All around good family restaurant."}
{"text":"Birthday dinner for hubby, bread came quickly, with the oil, very tasty, (ate too much of bread).
Birthday boy had Sausage stachetti (?)he likes sausage and cheese. For me it was Chick Scalopinni, nice chicken, but the pasta was dry, poured what remained of the dipping oil, that helped a bit. What I should have done was ask to sub a veg for pasta, and take half home.

Once you know how large the plates are, order half to go or split plates and salad, or split an appetizer."}
{"text":"Good food, would eat here again.  Service was okay.  I think our server was new and we had to remind him for things we previously asked for.  We never did get a salad with one of our meals that was ordered...  Tad bit pricy."}
{"text":"Went there on a Friday night and it was really noisy!  One of us had pizza and the other pasta with chicken.  Both were good but the pasta was a little too salty.  Bread was good and the salad had lots of veggies it in.  We would recommend it."}
{"text":"We both had the house specialty Pasta Bravo. Very good. The salads were excellent, too.
We will come back soon."}
{"text":"First time having dinner at Bravo.  They have a wide variety of food and usually o pkay it safe and get chicken and pasta.  Tonight however i decided to be Bold and decides to try the grilled salmon.  oh boy was that good..  it was delish..  the combo of sweet potato,  spinach,  feta cheese,  Asparagus , bellpeppers and balsaic vinigar was awesome. The salmon was cooked to perfection ..definitely worth going back. Service was great!"}
{"text":"My sister and I ate here for dinner and left with nothing but a five star experience from the food to the service. We started with a caprese salad which was very good!! I enjoyed a pork chop that was cooked to perfection with a side of delicious veggies and amazing mash potatoes. My two year old had the grilled chicken with veggies and the freshest fruit ever off the kids menu. I also ordered lasagna to go for the Hubby which he thought was absolutely delicious as well. Can't wait to bring the family back!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing service and delicious food!
The food here was so good!!
We also had a fantastic server!
Thank you Jennifer for being so efficient and attentive!"}
{"text":"My family and I went there for a dinner, we had a great time and the food was awesome. I love their spinach dip and lobster ravioli. Its a must try! Great customer service as well. 2 thumbs up"}
{"text":"This is our first time does it into the newly-opened Bravo and have to say really enjoyable experience. Our waiter Jordan was outstanding as well as the hostess in the chef who were really enthusiastic and give us a great sense of hospitality. Can't wait to come back again. Woo hoo!!"}
{"text":"Came here for Mother's Day brunch, and had a nice time. I started with the Italian Wedding Soup, then had the Eggs, Home Fries & Bacon. The soup was very good! The egg, potatoes and bacon were good, but a pretty standard breakfast, so nothing really out of this world. I thought it was odd that they didn't have any type of jam or preserves for the toast. The service was good and our server, Haylee did a great job! I wouldn't have a problem coming back, if I'm back on this side of town."}
{"text":"Awful.  Even for a chain.

Went here on another Christmas gift card...seriously, I may just give these away.

Sat down, ordered wine.  It was delivered in a glass the size of a shot glass, and all at $7/glass.

The food was, blah.  I had a veal parm that was killed with garlic, an accompanying pasta that was so greasy and slimy it was disgusting.

Even their bread was bad.

Service was good.

Two thumbs down on Pepsi products."}
{"text":"Rhonda is a great addage! She will be the local that will bring her long list of previouslymore than satisfied guests!"}
{"text":"Food was solid, waitress was overbearing. You have a rewards card, great. Tell me about it before the meal, after the meal, but not during. And not every dirty dish needs to be banished from the table the moment it becomes empty."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place this evening after doing some shopping. It's conveniently located in the Galleria at Sunset.

We missed happy hour by 10 minutes. Weren't able to see what they had but the bar seemed packed when we got there at 6:40. Happy hour is 3:30 to 6:30.

We were greeted by the hostess and then sat down at one of the booths. Overall the decor is nice. Slightly nicer than the standard Italian chain. Menu is simple and minimal. They have he staples like fried calamari, pizzas, lasagna, and chicken beef and fish.

They start you off with a focaccia style bread and spicy olive oil. Pretty tasty. 

We decided to go with the pasta trio featured on their 25 year anniversary menu. Comes with the lasagna, pasta diablo with either chicken or shrimp and 2 cheese ravioli. No sides. My friend added a chopped salad for 4.99 and I added the the lobster bisque for 5.49.

I gave the lobster bisque a solid 5/5. Sweet, buttery and definitely tasty. Wasn't much lobster though. Actual meat. Maybe 2 small pieces but for the price it was one of the best bisques I've had. The chopped salad was also good. A solid 4/5. Looked like a traditional Greek salad. Feta cheese, tomatoes, cucumbers and black olives.

Our mains were the disappointment. Lasagna definitely sadly fell short. Looked like they forgot a few layers. It was almost as flat as the ravioli. The lasagna and the ravioli were on the ends of the plate. For whatever reason they were cooler than the pasta diablo in the center. I think the plate the pasta at the end and have the ravioli and pagan pre made and portioned and set before. All 3 were just ok. This is where it went from a nicer chain to the standard Olive Garden. Gave our dishes 2/5. The chicken on my friends pasta was dry and my previously frozen shrimp were chewy. 

Overall good atmosphere, service was par and the ambience was nice. Just seemed to fall short on the mains. May try it again for the happy hour."}
{"text":"Great Food with Outstanding Service! Was my first time here. I was quite surprised how awesome the food was. Very tasty and full of flavor. I started off with the Lobster Bisque and a side Caesar salad, both were the best I have tasted in a long time. For main course I had the Mama's Lasagna. For desert I had the Pumpkin Caramel Bread pudding.  Great choices. I am so glad I asked my waiter Michael, for his recommendations. Bravo stands out from the competition and is a MUST GO TO."}
{"text":"First I want to say, the food tasted amazing. Both me and my husband agree that the food is really good. 

We placed an order thru GrubHub. When our order came it was missing the chopped salad and the lobster bisque. 
I ordered gluten free- Bravo Pasta and my husband ordered lasagna.

When I looked at my pasta dish I was concerned it did not look gluten free. I have been eating gluten free for years and I can often tell if pasta looks gluten free or not. So I decided to call and report our missing items and ask if they actually made my pasta gluten free. 

What was great is that they sent us out our missing items and I was pleased that they were willing to make things right. 

The reason for the 2 stars is that when I called to ask if the pasta I received was gluten free, I was assured on the phone that it was. When the second part of the order came, it also had their actual gluten free pasta in it and it was not the same as the first pasta I received. Had they just told me that they made a mistake on the phone I would have gladly waited but because I was reassured on the phone that the pasta I already had was gluten free, I ate it. 
Sadly, now I am sick. I have celiac so it is no \"lifestyle\" choice. I count on being told the truth.
I realize there are risks eating out but this I feel was beyond the norm of nondisclosure. 

I would eat here again but I would not order their food from GrubHub as I feel they do not read those orders in detail for some reason.


**** I would like to amend my review. They have gone into grub hub and relabeled their gluten free items so they can see the dishes ordered are gluten free. We have ordered from them since and we will again. The food is delish!"}
{"text":"I have to say this is one of the top 3 happy hours in Vegas/ Henderson. Great bar menu, great pub grub great place for a first date. Very friendly wait staff and Yule your a real pro. Thx."}
{"text":"Much better food this time.   You just can't beat alfredo sauce on top of lasagna.   Plenty of sauces and mix of beef and sausage.  Excellent flavor in meal.   The Italian wedding soup is awesome, more meat than pasta. 
Add excellent service and it made a great dining experience.   Only draw back was it took awhile for a slow restaurant."}
{"text":"Food amazing and the service excellent. Thank you Jordan for a wonderful experience. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Lots to like here. Service is always super solicitous, makes me double check the prices to see if I'm in a more expensive restaurant than I first thought. 

The lasagna looks amazing but it is packed with sausage and then some. Just know what you are getting."}
{"text":"I have visited this location several times with friends and my book group.  The service and the food has always been fantastic.  

Their bar area is really nice. Happy Hour offers a great menu and drinks. 

This is a great place to go with a large group. The menu has something for everyone.  Added bonus, separate checks."}
{"text":"My best girlfriend took me here for my birthday dinner and it didn't disappoint.  The complimentary bread is good-soft and warm with a hint of rosemary. Bring on the olive oil and balsamic! Mmmmm. 
I opted for a 2 course entree consisting of a Caesar salad and bacon wrapped balsamic meatloaf. The salad was outstanding. A good solid Caesar dressing and croutons that taste homemade. I have no clue what prompted me to get meatloaf but it was a home run for sure. I'm not a bacon person so I picked that off but the meatloaf was cooked to perfection and seasoned wonderfully. The balsamic glaze married so well with the beef. It came with a side of Yukon gold mashed potatoes and hericot vert (which I learned was basically very thin green beans) The potatoes were slightly cold but the green beans were excellent. The proverbial cherry on top was the crispy onion straws on top of the meatloaf. Fried onions...you can't go wrong. 
As if dinner wasn't good enough, my big mouthed friend (kidding!) let the server know that it was my birthday and they offered a complimentary dessert of my choice from the entire dessert menu. No kid sized birthday freebies here. We chose the caramel mascarpone cheesecake. It was good. Nothing out of this world but good. 
The restaurant itself is a mixture of tables and booths and it has a large bar area as well. We came on a Thursday night and were seated immediately. Our server was great, although she did a weird disappearing act after dinner that made us wait a bit too long for the check. 
I can't wait to go back and try other dishes at Bravo. It was a great experience all around. Bravo! Indeed!"}
{"text":"This restaurant just opened last Thursday in the Galleria Mall and my boyfriend and I decided to give them a try the day after on Friday. They offer brunch, lunch and dinner (I have attached pdf links for all on the bottom of this review), a large wine list and a good number of specialty drinks. They even have light and gluten free options! This is probably one of my favorite restaurants now along Stephanie St. since the majority of the restaurants on this street are what I call \"fast-food restaurants\" like Applebee's, Macaroni Grill, Miller's Ale House, etc. with a bunch of frozen goodies on their menus but here, everything we ordered tasted really fresh and homey!

Rosemary bread & oil: Super soft and flavorful, I'm a sucker for bread baskets. (Excuse the blurry photo, I was in a rush to eat it already lmao)

Shrimp Campanelle Al Forno $17.99: Grape tomatoes, mushrooms, green onions, lobster cream sauce, baked in wood fired oven. This dish is MASSIVE. I feel that many would consider this a family style portion! Very easily sharable. I wasn't starving but I was hungry and managed to only 1/3. Yeay for leftovers! Also had great flavor, super creamy and I loved the crunchy topping. Good portion for shrimp as well.

Ravioli Di Bello $15.49: Portobello ravioli, crimini mushrooms, tomatoes, parmesan, thyme, champagne brown butter sauce. This was still a large portion but not as crazy as mine lol large ravioli and perfect amount of filling. I loved the Champagne sauce, it was creamy yet had a slight tart and fruity taste.

Warm Chocolate Cake $6.99: Rich chocolate cake served warm with a molten lava center, topped with vanilla bean gelato. Loved this! It tastes like they use Ghirardelli Chocolate but I'm not sure. Super gooey and warmy but not a liquidy molten center like my boyfriend prefers.

Ambiance/Service: Really pretty on the inside, kind of had a Brio-type feel. High ceilings, open kitchen, very large bar area, lots of comfy outdoor patio seating and large windows making everything airy and bright! I can definitely see this restaurant being very popular! Everyone was really friendly and they had A LOT of staff working. It seemed like we came during a rush, as about 5 tables around us all started and finished around the same time! And one of the tables had about 8 people! Really great time management on their part. Our server was also great! Friendly, offered a few of her favorites, waters kept full, and was constantly checking up on us.

Overall, I definitely see myself coming here again. I can't give them 5 stars yet since I couldn't exactly see myself craving anything we had and as I haven't tried their specialty cocktails, or appetizers yet and only 2 entrees but if my second visit is just as great as this one, 5 stars it is! Great food, great service, great pricing for portion size, and we were out of there in an hour! :)

{"text":"Bravo and Brio at Town Square are both owned by the same company.  Both of these spots are delicious but I have to say the ambience and food I have tried at Brio has beaten out Bravo.  

Bravo is mid range regarding price but has some great chicken and pasta dishes.  The bread is absolutely incredible and I would come just for that. No draft beers is a bummer but they have a decent selection of great tasting bottled beers.  

Overall, Bravo is a great restaurant.  All of the staff has always been friendly and I will definitely return."}
{"text":"I was expecting more and was disappointed. Came here for a large group for a birthday party. The place was very spacious with a beautiful patio seating area. Our servers were Saydie and Dray. Sorry if I killed their names. We had a group of 15 kids and 10 adults. Our servers were great and very attentive. Saydie was very funny and went with our table's humor. My 3 stars goes to the food, not the service or ambiance.  

When I glanced at the menu, so many things looked delicious to me and I honestly had a hard time deciding what to order. I ended up getting the grilled salmon which was my server's favorite dish. So it had to be a sure thing. I was excited. When our food arrived, only half the table got their food while the other half had to wait an additional 5-10 minutes until their food arrived. I think this was due to the servers putting in food at different times. Needless to say, the timing was off. 

My dish looked beautiful and I was excited to dig in. Unfortunately, my dish was bland.  What killed it at first bite was my \"roasted\" sweet potatoes were still raw.  I tried to suck it up and eat it but it wasn't good.  So I politely asked the server for another order of the sweet potatoes. My salmon was not your typical salmon color, it was actually white which I thought was odd. Made me question if it was really salmon? All in all, there was no wow factor in this dish and the worst is when food is bland. I only took a few bites and took the rest home.  My new order of sweet potatoes came out fresh and hot and was way better.  I think they cooked it with coconut oil too because it had a little sweet after taste which was delicious.

I'm open to come back and try this spot again if someone invited me but I personally wouldn't choose to come here again. The prices are high and for what you're getting, I would rather go to Brio's where the food is amazing and consistent. Funny enough, we were actually at Brio's the night before and everything we got was on point. Sorry Bravo."}
{"text":"I have dined here about 5 or 6 times now. It's not Olive Garden basic, but it's not gourmet Italian either. If you are craving pasta, this will do the job. However I have to agree with fellow Elite Chris V., DO NOT get the pasta Bravo. It's just unimpressive and nothing special. 
The Alfredo sauce is good. The house salad with the creamy Parmesan dressing, super yummy. Honestly all of the salads are great. The steak is a solid choice but again simply mediocre versus wonderful. Nothing is bad, but the only thing that makes me love coming back is the dam cheesecake. A huge slice with a creme bruleed crust, worth the average food, every single time. 
And the service is outstanding. Even when they are slammed busy, or I order take out, they seem to be on point no matter what. I have also had a couple cocktails. This place would be great for salads, appetizers, and a bottle of wine. Truly between 3 and 4 stars, but considering there is nothing WRONG or BAD, I will go with the 4. I am just a picky Italian girl with high end taste. This place will get the job done."}
{"text":"My mom brought the hubby, baby, and I here after spending time taking Christmas photos in the mall. We came here around 1PM and all ordered something light from their menu:

Mom: Calamari 
Hubz: Spaghetti & Meatballs
Baby: Milk (lol)
Me: Shrimp Scampi - plain

As the waitress is taking our orders my husband asks the server what their craft beer is since the menu says, \"Ask your server for the craft beer list.\" She then responds with and kept repeating, \"I don't know why they have that on the menu, we do not have any craft beer.\" She didn't try to upsell him or offer any of the beers they actually did serve just kept repeating that they (the restaurant) should remove that off of the menu. Husband decided to order one of their Italian beers. 

While we waited for our food to arrive, the server brought out bread & olive oil for us to munch on. The bread was amazing! It was baked with a variety of herbs and was baked to perfection - a little crunchy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. 

Once our food arrived - which didn't take long considering around the time we were here there were about 10 people also dining in. All of our food came out correct and tasted OK. I kind of wish there were more shrimps in my shrimp scampi but other than that it was fine. The ingredients used to cook our meals were average - nothing to go home about and tell all your friends, basically.

I would say the restaurant's quality of food is a step higher than the Olive Garden. The good news is that none of us got heartburn after eating their food lol. If you are in the mall for several hours and do not want to eat their food court food, I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Had brunch with some friends on Sunday. Brian C. was our server and he was excellent. He was very patient with all of us (3 kids all under the age of 6 and 5 adults). He took all the drink orders right away and even got the kids orders started immediately. Everyone had great things to say about their food. I ended up ordering shrimp scampi which was very good. Brian also brought out some dough for the kids to shape into anything they wanted and when they were finished he took the kids to bake the dough in the oven. He sat them down in front of the oven until done baking and then brought them back to the table. Very nice touch. Kids menu pizza and grilled salmon are big portions and a very good price as well."}
{"text":"Last night was our second time at Bravo in 2 weeks; our first visit was lunch and if you want to try something absolutely fantastic try the meatball and marscapone Polenta. It was to die for!
Last night four of us had spaghetti Bolognese, Chicken Milanese, Shrimp Fra Diavolo and my choice was the Grilled Mahi Mahi.  Everyone thought their dinners were superb and they were. I actually bought two containers of the Bolognese sauce to bring home with me it was that good. And I make great Bolognese sauce.  One of my favorite soups to make is Italian wedding soup and Bravo's  yis outstanding; may  not be homemade but it's great nevertheless. Their salads are very crisp and fresh.
The delicious fresh, hot bread they serve before the meal is accompanied by a very good sun-dried tomato dipping sauce which they sell on a table next to the front door if you're interested in bringing some home.

Service of course was impeccable as it is at Brio their sister restaurant. The ambience is really very nice-a great place to bring guests.  White tablecloth, very tasteful and pleasant decor.  They have a beautiful patio section and the misters were on last night but the temperature was 106° and we decided not to chance it but we will definitely dine on that great patio our next time there.  The wall fountain next-door at Larson Grill  gives a very pleasant view. This is definitely our new go-to Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"The food and service as excellent.  This was our first visit to Bravo We went on Sunday and they served 
brunch until 3pm.  

My kids and wife had breakfast entries.  The portion sizes were good, presentation was excellent, and the  taste spot on.

I had the Sicilian Pizza.  It had lots of toppings, and was a thin crispy crust.

We tried the white peach sangria.  Found it to be overly tart compared to any other white peach sangria I have ever had.  It would have been better had it been a little sweeter. 

Other than that, the overall experience was good. 

I would definitely recommend this restaurant.  Can't wait to come back to try their dinners."}
{"text":"Super disappointed. First time checking this establishment and honestly I doubt I will ever go back or even recommend it.  First the server was horrible. Sorry but the server is everything!!! If you have a server that's lazy and doesn't know what the hell she's doing you shouldn't even have her there.  I had to ask her for everything. Never brought a bread basket even though every other table had it except us. My aunts coffee was empty she had to ask for a refill several times.  When she did bring the bread after I asked for it of course.. she brought no bread plates.  The food was super bland no flavor at all.  Our food took about a good hour and a half to even come out. When it did was was cold.  The latte was cold. I could keep on going but honestly not worth it. What I suggest....teach your servers how to treat guests how to attend to them. Your dining experience is everything. Coming from a food and beverage background it was disappointing."}
{"text":"I have only gone to Bravo Cucina at the Sunset location twice as it is not near where I live.  Both times to meet a friend for \"Happy Hour\" and was impressed both times.  Although limited, they have something for everyone on the happy hour menu.  I recommend highly the Crispy Shrimp Napoli and the Cheeseburger and Fries!  Pair that with $5 glasses of wine and you have a winning combination.  The restaurant itself is nicely appointed and very clean.  We had exceptional service from the hostess, bartender and wait staff...all very friendly!  If you are looking for reasonable prices and delicious happy hour food, near the Galleria Mall, give Bravo Cucina a try."}
{"text":"First time eating here. Food was delicious and service was great. I ordered the lobster ravioli, be aware the sauce has lobster in it not the ravioli. But it was still an amazing flavored dish. Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"My two favorite words beside bottomless brunch? HAPPY HOUR.  This place recently opened up at the Galleria Mall and I had heard it had a great happy hour, but I wouldn't believe it until I experienced.  We just happened to go on National Martini Day so they had even more drink specials than usual.  I can say with 100% certainty that their Happy Hour is UNBELIEVABLE.  Not only are their drink prices out of this world, their bar bite prices are amazing too!  We got 3 or 4 drinks each (two of us) and about 4 bar bite plates to share.  The bar bites are largely portioned so we were more than stuffed when we finally finished.  And everything we had was delicious!  I loved the flat bread I ordered and their spin on fried mozzarella was amazing too!  

I am normally not a martini person, but in celebration of National Martini Day I decided to step out of my comfort zone.  The bartender sold me on one and it was amazing!  I loved the food.  I loved the drinks.  I loved the pricing.  I loved the location.  I basically loved my whole visit!  My main issue is that the service was relatively slow for how not busy they were.  For example, the manager was testing the bartenders pours.  One of the bartenders had just taken our drink order when the manager said it was his turn and he chose to test his pour rather than throw together our drinks.  I understand from an industry perspective how important it is to test pours, but if the two patrons whose order you just took are sitting right there and could visibly see you chose to take you pour test for 5 minutes before making our drinks (which would've taken the same amount of time)...that's just poor decision making my opinion.  The customer should always come first.  It would have been different if we were at a table and weren't there to see it, but we just got the vibe from our bartender that he didn't really care about servicing us and had better things to do.  There was a female bartender on staff who took amazing care of us, though, balancing out our experience!  But, this place had just opened so I'm sure they are still working out the kinks and everything will begin to run smoothly with time."}
{"text":"My husband and I went for dinner last night around 6:45pm and sat at a table in the bar. We were there well over five minutes and neither of the two bartenders or the manager that were behind the bar ever even came by our table to say hello or drop off menus. Terrible service, we walked out."}
{"text":"Believe it or not, but we chose to have our baby shower here in their private banquet room (July 2015). They have a coordinator that works with you to select a menu that's served family style on the tables. They allow some decorating but honestly the decor is pretty nice and classy anyways (not to mention the restrooms were located directly by the banquet room). Some servers and kitchen staff even helped us carry gifts out to the car (which saved us several trips). Overall, it was very affordable and accommodating. We did hit one disappointing snag with the service from the coordinator: we discussed and inquired before booking the temperature of the room and whether or not the air conditioning could be controlled for the comfort of the room (we didn't want the room to get hot or stuffy.) The coordinator assured us that this would not be an issue and even explained that the room was on a separate thermostat. However, on the day of the event, the coordinator acted like we were from Mars when we asked for the air conditioned to be dropped a couple of notches. We weren't out to turn the place into an igloo--the temperature just needed to be dropped slightly because of the size of the room and amount of people. Ultimately she agreed and compiled, it was just stupid to have to convince her to do this. On the day of the event, the staff nailed it: food was awesome and guests loved it. The hostess was awesome and kind in the way she would direct our guests to the back of the restaurant. Their banquet room is the best kept secret in Fairlawn!"}
{"text":"Worst place ever my mom and I had dinner here I was so excited cause we live close by and we usually go to brio at town square .. we seat down our waitress was so rude didn't give us time to look at the menu I asked her if my mom that's very older and can't hear much basically yelled at her it was so ridiculous and unprofessional.. after we order she comes back with salads and just almost throw it at my mom I understand if u r having a bad day but don't take it on your customers , I'm in the service industry too and I'm going thru a lot and still put my head up and be professional. And the food not good the shrimp smelled weird .. the salmon was good though that's 5 stars but nothing else . I hope management will take a moment out of there time and talked to there staff !!"}
{"text":"Thank you Saadi for being so patient and attentive! You made our Father's Day dinner so nice! We never had to wait too long for anything. Your timing was great! We just enjoyed each other's company and the wonderful food."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a bite to eat with my dear daughter and was pleasantly surprised by the decor, management, and waitstaff. The food was good, and portions generous. Would eat here again if I visit the Galleria Mall again."}
{"text":"Excellent service & very helpful w/ my daughter's Allergies!!! Jordan is very attentive w/ our table!!! Only wish they had the Crackers like Brio.... Love this place !!!"}
{"text":"This is our first time here. Very friendly staff and the food was amazing. They also have a rewards program which is pretty cool. We will be back."}
{"text":"Three stars for service.  Four stars for the food.  My food was outstanding!  I got the tilapia with crab and shrimp.  The bread they brought out for us to share was just the right temperature with this amazing oil blend along with seasoning.  My friend got the chicken caprese.  Presentation was there!  

Now to the service..

Bravo only opened two and half weeks ago.  We have to give them that, however, the bartenders were having personal conversations and I had to interrupt to get my wine glass refilled and again to settle our bill.  The manager came over to assist the bartenders with something and she even seemed a bit frazzled with how they were joking around.  The bartenders didn't know how to process the coupon we had so the manager had to come over to do this.   When we got up to leave neither manager thanked us that we had serve us during the interaction however the bartender that was taking over took the time to do so which we appreciated.

I will absolutely be back however with Bravo being open for longer I would expect better service."}
{"text":"Awesome service, awesome food. I'm from orange county ca and bravo is way better than the olive gardens from back home. I had the chicken milanese and the pasta was delicious. My wife had the pasta bravo which was also great. They have a peach palmer that was yummy too."}
{"text":"Not impressed...I had surgery and requested to order from kid's menu. I was limited to the kid's menu. Server told me it was regular portion but didn't tell me that I would be charged regular prices. I only ate half my meal, didn't really order what I wanted because I thought I was limited to kid's menu and was charged full price! Food was mediocre at best...manager was rude even after I showed her my surgery card! I will not be coming back. There are so many more outstanding Italian restaurants to choose from in this city!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and amazing service. Highly recommended for lunch or dinner. I was very surprised and will recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a new Italian experience. BRAVO !!!"}
{"text":"Delicious as usual, ate at one of these twice in 2 weeks in 2 different cities. The flavors are great and the bread is good. We need one in Riverside."}
{"text":"(3.5 stars) Nice restaurant, good food and average service. Got the meatballs and polenta that was tender and tasty but lukewarm in temperature- I thought they were made to order or at least heated to safe food temperature. Italian meatball soup was good with plenty of mini meatballs and some vegetables. Saw the fire oven and ordered a spinach chicken pizza. Crust was thick and mildly chewy and had a spinach dip like sauce on top with some chicken, cheese and bacon- great combo of flavors. 
Server didn't check on us promptly after the food was delivered, but was good on refilling drinks. Food runners deliver your food, so you always have to raise your hand to claim the dish you ordered- it would be nice to not have to do that at a restaurant that is priced more than Olive Garden."}
{"text":"This is another must go to restaurant. They have the BEST Happy Hour food we have had for this price. The dirty Martinis are on happy hour daily. The food is awesome. Big portions and absolutely delicious. Brandon is the Bartender to ask for. He is amazing. We will be regulars here. Don't forget to download their App and get $10.00 of your next visit."}
{"text":"I came here for my birthday dinner with friends and family. We usually do Olive Garden for my birthday but since this place was new and also Italian we thought we'd try it out. I ended up regretting that decision. 

Our busboy was so friendly our waiter on the other hand was kind of a snood. He was an older gentlemen and just didn't have a good personality. We had lots of questions being that the place is new and we had never been there and seemed annoyed at every question we asked. 

& the atmosphere was literally so loud I couldn't hear  my own thoughts let alone the person across from me. 

Our food was average. I mean this place is not cheap. It's quite pricey actually and my food was just bland, I would think for a $20 plate of fettuccini Alfredo I would get something to talk about! Instead it left me wishing i had stuck to the usual Olive Garden. Most likely will not return."}
{"text":"Bravo is good every time. The food, service and atmosphere is amazing. Their new menu is not as good a before but is still better than most. The lobster bisque is amazing and highly recommended."}
{"text":"First time going to this place for dinner with my mom and it was pretty tasty. We shared the eggplant and zucchini appetizer, which was alright. The best part was the white tangy sauce served on the side. Then we split one of their small salads with crunchy pasta, bacon bits and a creamy Parmesan dressing --that was delicious! 

My entree was the grilled salmon and for me, it was cooked perfectly. Not dry at all, some may think it was a little undercooked but I had no problem with it. It was topped with asparagus and a balsamic glaze. Around the plate was spinach and bits of sweet potatoes and tomatoes. Overall, a very flavorful filling plate. 

The only negative remark I have to make is that service was a bit slow at the beginning getting our waters and bread basket, but it was pretty busy when we first sat down. 

Would come back again and try something else!"}
{"text":"This place was wonderful. The sangria was delicious and at $5 a glass on Sunday. Yum. The kids Mac and chews was super delicious."}
{"text":"A warm and sincere greeting by the staff coupled with delicious Italian fare and a family friendly atmosphere, we've been enjoying Bravo! (sister company to Brio) for a few years now. No matter what - if you order different dishes or their classics you'll be guaranteed consistency and greatness."}
{"text":"Went here with my bf last week. Got a table outside the weather was great and so was the service! I ordered the lobster bisque lunch portion and a pasta. He ordered a pasta with meatsauce. It was bomb! Really good and flavorful and the lobster bisque was great. Ordered a full portion of it the next day to go. I've been to the location in New Orleans didn't know it would be the same flavors!"}
{"text":"I don't know if it was because it's Sunday or what but the food was not as good today as it's been before. The bread and potatoes I had were definitely leftovers, the salad ingredients also tasted....not fresh, and the asparagus was not cooked at all. I ate it. It was fine, I was starving. I just really don't want to pay Bravo prices for leftovers. Ah well. Service was great as usual."}
{"text":"My family and I ate there for the first time last week! And we were not disappointed! 
Bravo is related to the Brio restaurant in the Town Square. And we enjoy eating there!
However, Bravo is much more convenient as less busy, the food and drink was better.
We ate in the bar and took advantage of the awesome happy hour specials, including the crispy shrimp Napoli, the flat bread spinach dip, as well as a pizza!

Our food was served fresh and hot. The service was outstanding!  Our server, Brian, was very attentive to our needs and provided great hospitality!

We will definitely return soon!"}
{"text":"Tried Bravo for the first time over the weekend. Met some friends for a nice lunch. The outside looks amazing, a nice upgrade to the galleria mall. 

We had a reservation, but it didn't seem that busy for 1pm on a Sunday. The waitress, Daniela was very attentive. My group hadn't seen each other in a while so it took us a while to look through the menu. She was very helpful at recommending and making substitutions for our table. I ended up ordering the 5oz filet and I was pleasantly surprised by how tender it tasted. Very melt in my mouth.. Yum! I would definitely order it again. Daniela made sure we had everything we needed and we never had to worry about refills. Excellent service! 

Hopefully, this place will pick up because it is a great addition to the restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"The service was fantastic. It really felt like eating at mom's house. Family style sinning with huge portions. The meatballs were huge. I had spaghetti and the sauce was homemade. Strawberry lemonade was just the right amount of sweet to the tart. This is a must visit. We felt like family."}
{"text":"Wow!  Best service ever. Their bar stools are so tall I couldn't get up on them (78 years old). Lol   We wanted to do their happy hour but had to leave. When we left the server Jen came after us and said you can sit on the patio and we will put the sprinklers on. We said that would be nice. We thoroughly enjoyed happy hour and great food. The shrimp is a must try. Jen and the manager came out periodicity to see how we were doing. Definitely will recommend."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised! Me and my boyfriend were at Summit Mall till pretty late on a Saturday and decided to hop into Bravo for a quick bite before heading home. We had the calamari to start and it was delicious. The lobster ravioli was so good and I had plenty for leftovers. Definitely prefer this to any other Italian chain restaurant I've ate at."}
{"text":"Bravo Cucina Italiana is awesome.  This is my second time here.  Their grilled Pork Chop is definitely what makes us come back.  We ordered that the first time we came here and was amazed with the flavor and tenderness of the pork.  I hope that it stays that way always!  Each time I talk about this place or recommend it, I always recommend people order the Pork Chops.  

The first time we came here, we also did happy hour and tried the meatballs which was full of flavor but, to my liking was just ok.  Today we ordered off the happy hour menu and we tried the Crispy Shrimp Napoli which I enjoyed.  That too was full of flavor.  I also ordered the White Peach Sangria which if you like fruity and sweet drinks, this is perfect.  It wasn't insanely sweet.  

The first time here, for my main course I tried the Pasta Fra Diavolo w/ Chicken which I barely ate because my pasta was dried and the flavor just wasn't there for me. This one dish alone hasn't stopped me from coming back.  

Not only is the food good here but so is the atmosphere and their employees!  Great service all around. 

So with that being said! Happy Eatings!"}
{"text":"Nice people,  good food,  great yelp deals.  The wine on happy hour sucks, but expected at that price.   Left the glass half full.   Middle class thinking Italian is good or at least better than olive garden,  hello.   Olive garden is the Macdonalds of Italian food,  of course its better.   Still if you are in Vegas,  this is OK price and food for your Italian fix."}
{"text":"Forgot about the happy hour free appetizer in Yelp. The deal was two full course meals for $29.95 which runs Sunday's thru Thursday's. Everything was good chopped salad, bread, entree and dessert but waiter didn't attend to our empty waters. We'll go back! Large portions not like some restaurants. They discontinued the deal for two dinners at $29.95. They said it was just for the holiday season. Well I thought it still was the holiday season thru New Year's Day. The place was empty so split a pizza not great and had two chopped salads. Wish we had gone elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere... great prices.  Awesome place... be sure to order the Fennel Sausage Bruchetta..."}
{"text":"Delicious! Me & my friend went here during Lunch We had the different flat breads & the Lasagna for a Lunch special It was Really Delicious! And I am a picky eater! I will be back real soon"}
{"text":"Great service and good priced italian food.  Very good ambiance and the staff from the front to the server was great.  Had the crispy shrimp appetizer and it came with 8+ shrimp! A good portion in a Napoli sauce.  Had the Bolognese and it was good.  Wife had the shrimp Diavalo and it was not too spicy with a lot of shrimp.  The restaurant is kid friendly also.  I would go again if i was in the area, but I would not make a special trip out there just to eat again."}
{"text":"Had their lasagna. It was very good, and it actually had substantial real meat in it-not like Buca di Beppo. The Mimosas are good, and our server was on top of her game. Only wish they had draft beer"}
{"text":"The first time I went I didn't have that great of an experience and Christy reached out to me. 
I came back and Ronnie took care of us. We had a much better experience the second time around. I must say that both times the food was fantastic! 
The first time we had issues with our server who did nothing but flirt with the hostess and waitresses the entire time  
But they redeemed themselves! Geraldine was a wonder server and was very attentive. She was on top of refills (unlike Hugo whom we had previously had where I did not get one single refill). 
I would recommend and would definitely come back after my most recent experience with them. 
Thank you for making it right Ronnie & Christy!"}
{"text":"Got some dish recommendations from a super cool waitress named Michelle. For an appetizer, the crispy Shrimp Napoli and for an entree, pasta fra diavlo. The shrimp on both dishes was cooked perfectly!"}
{"text":"Very good food we typically go here once a month food is excellent lasagna Bolognese is good chicken marsala is also good"}
{"text":"Italian food at reasonable prices. I had the lobster ravioli, while my wife had spaghetti and meatballs. First, the positives:

1) The busser/drink taker/food runner (sorry I didn't get her name) was awesome. This review would have gone south very quickly without her extraordinary effort to supplement our server.
2) Everything about our meal was good while not impressive. From the pre-meal bread and oil, the meals themselves, and the portion size of said entrees.
3) Really liked the decor/ambiance of the restaurant/bar, definitely do not feel you are at a mall.

Negatives:
1) Waiter was almost non-existent. By the time he got around to us, we'd already received our drinks and placed our food order. However he was nice enough to re-fill my wife's drink and bring us the check.
2) While the restaurant wasn't full (Saturday lunch), it did have 2 larger parties that seemed to throw it off just prior to our arrival, causing a longer than needed wait for our food to arrive (by the looks of it, they had plenty of staff).

Overall, I will give it another shot if over in the area."}
{"text":"First time here since the bravo transition. I was pleasantly surprised! Everything was delicious from the sandwiches to the pasta. Great spot for lunch or dinner. Also wouldn't be opposed to trying their brunch at some point."}
{"text":"I would go back to this place. We had really great service, the atmosphere is nice & the bathrooms are clean. The food was good, but not AMAZING."}
{"text":"Easter Brunch! Amazing! Very Happy! We ordered off of the Easter menu. Two of us had the Italian omelette and my daughter had the margarita pizza. We shared a carafe of the red sangria. Service was awesome. Food was great!. Will be going back soon."}
{"text":"Maybe a bad day because decided to try based on 4 1/2 stars but the waiter was super slow , didn't seem to want to be there , had to finally ask another waiter for water , never received our appetizer at all , food was just okay"}
{"text":"I think that Bravo is very similar to Brico. Chain Italian, better than Olive Garden or Macaroni Grill but still a chain. We went for lunch and got the Lobster bisque which was yummy, the bread and oil was good too. The sandwich was ok, the avocado was browning, which in my opinion is unacceptable when you pay that much for a sandwich. Cream Brulee was good. A good option for something \"upscale\" at Summit Mall."}
{"text":"I had my husband's birthday celebration here Last night and I just had to write about the overall experience. I hosted a small dinner in their private room  at no extra cost which was the perfect venue for a larger party- beautiful, clean and intimate. The staff was nothing less than Amazing! Lesha was very kind and knowledgable when it came to all the items on the menu and the other server assisting her (I hate that I 4got his name) but he was so good with my kids n very helpful. Managers Ashley n Moira were super accommodating, I was highly impressed

...now on to the food lol I'm extremely BIG on Food (because I cook extremely well myself) so here's my honest oppinion; I choose to have only the Summer Nights Menu to be presented to my guest because it was the most cost effective option, 3course meal for 20 bucks!  You really can't beat it. I was very apprehensive at first, after I found out this place was a food chain but I was pleasantly surprised, I had the Lobster Bisque and i loved that it was a little spicy and very flavorful n hearty a tad bit on the salty side tho but was still very good. The Chicken w/goat cheese was delicious and very tasty, The Salmon with the crispy vegetable hash was yummy too, the Berry Bread pudding was my favorite it wasn't too Sweet n I love that in a dessert, it makes u want to eat more of it.

They allowed my to bring in our own store bought cake  which was nice of them and they allowed me to decorate in advance which was convenient. Im all about \"celebrating on a budget\" i have a large family n it can get extremely expensive to go out to eat- but before I spend my whole paycheck on Generic places like Red Lobster(yuck!), i like to look for places who have better quality food for a more reasonable, family friendly price- and BRAVO in Henderson  is one of them! The overall food and service was outstanding. I will definitely be hosting more events here. Thanks again for an Awsome Experience! BRAVO! LOL"}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant with an outdoor eating area and outdoor bar area. The first time I was there it was the pre-opening and I had:

Shrimp Campanelle Al Forno
Grape tomatoes, mushrooms, green onions, lobster cream sauce, baked in our wood fired oven 17.99

OMG was this amazing!!! Huge portions and great quality. I also had the lobster bisque soup... amazing also!!

I've been back for Happy Hour, 3:30-6:30. There are drink specials and a special bar menu with items $4-6. Everything I tried is excellent!! The staff is great and the bar staff is extra friendly."}
{"text":"The food was great but the service from Saadia surpasses anyone's expectation.   She remembered what we had from the last visit which was months ago.   Make sure you ask for her section."}
{"text":"First visit to Bravo and I was more than pleasantly surprised by the decor. We have been to the sister restaurant Brio many times and were always impressed but Bravo is much closer to our home. Service was excellent.  My husband had Sausage Succhetti, and he said it was seasoned perfectly.  I had Grilled Jumbo Shrimp which was served on a bed of Orzo with vegetables.  It was perfect. I highly recommend this restaurant and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My first visit and it will not be my last. I was curious about what kind of restraunt  would be at a shopping mall, but was pleasantly impressed once inside. A large room with comfortable seating inside. Lighting bright enough that I did not need to pull out the iPhone to use the light. Bar off to the side and tables outside. Staff is extremely friendly and attentive. 
The Mahi Mahi came with incredible vegetables. The snap pees were crisp and sweet. The Sausage Sacchetti was served with incredible sweet sausage. The essence of anise was incredible. The stuffed cheese pasta blended wonderfully with the sweet sausage and red sauce. The desserts were wonderful. The ambience was wonderful. 
Try it, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed the Bravo! Cucina Italiana in PA, so I was happy that the new Henderson location was just as good.  First, not actually part of this restaurant, but adjacent, the new outdoor area with the water feature looks lovely and compliments the restaurant nicely.  Second, the restaurant itself is a breath of fresh air and more upscale than the rest of the mall: from the white linens, to the decor, the high ceilings, and even the restroom!

We dined on Sunday afternoon, so both Lunch and Brunch menus were available.  We had a hard time deciding, so I went with a lunch salad and the BF ordered off the brunch menu.  We got:

The Romano-Crusted Chicken Salad $13.99: Crispy chicken breast over a chopped salad of lettuce, bacon, scallions, hard boiled egg, cucumbers, tomatoes, tossed in a Parmesan dressing.  Delicious and Huge, even when sharing! 

And the Ham & Biscuit Benedict $9.99: Two poached cage free eggs, Cherrywood smoked ham, house made biscuit, topped with hollandaise. Served with brunch potatoes.  Also scrumptious!  The biscuit was soft and flaky, the ham & eggs were cooked perfectly, and the hollandaise was creamy and delicious. The potatoes were also fantastic.

A few notes: 
-You can make reservations on Open Table or on their website http://www.bravoitalian.com/reservations.html
-Sister property to Brio, but they have separate Rewards programs.  Bravo's is basically $10 off your 6th visit
- Also like Brio, they have a Bar Only food menu that starts at $3.95 
- This is part of the Galleria Mall update/expansion, however they do not have an interior mall entrance, only an exterior parking lot facing entrance."}
{"text":"A great addition to the selection of restaurants at the Galleria Mall. 

Their service was a bit slow, but we never had to wait for long (only paying the bill itself took awhile); both our bread baskets and our drinks were always being refilled. 

The food was fantastic and the seating was great for our rather decent-sized group. We often have to struggle the latter part especially, but no problems here.

It's definitely a huge step up from most of the places to eat at the mall and is one of the best choices of Italian food within the area."}
{"text":"I used to love this location when it was Bravo Cucina.  Stopped there today expecting to find Bravo, and it's since been changed to Brio Coastal Kitchen.  Not impressed.  Prices have increased, and portion sizes decreased. I ordered the house salad with shrimp.  The shrimp were micro-sized. Bravo used to bring out bread automatically.  Now you have to ask for it, and hope your waiter remembers.  Our waiter was aloof and had minimal personality.  Will not be returning."}
{"text":"This was our 5th visit and it is a great little place in the heart of Henderson and the Mall! 

It was probably one of the best dining experiences for two reasons, the food is amazing and so is the service! We had Rebecca, she was attentive to our not knowing the menu, helped with recommendations after we told her our tastes and was great at checking back to ensure we were happy and getting the experience we wanted.  She should really train some of the others there as we saw some who could use her skills.

The bread was to die for, pasta was cooked perfectly and one of us had a filet steak and it was better than most of the steak places in the area. We are thrilled that this place is here in Henderson and we feel it is much better than the \"sister\" restaurant Brio that is in Town Center! Great place!!"}
{"text":"You know it's hard to slam something when they do it for you.  I was all set to opine on the fact that my arugula salad was filled with spinach or mention that the shortcake in the strawberry shortcake was so hard I thought of a hockey puck.  I could have mentioned the dirty fork caked in old cheese or the mediocre wine (well, no I like all wine, even mediocre).  I could have told you about all of the minuses I experienced while visiting BRAVO Cucina Italiana, but then I checked their website (a yelper must get her facts straight) and I understood so much.  

Their website actually boasts that they have \"a chef in every kitchen\". 

Yep, I'm not kidding it says it on the dinner menu page.  That notice gave me such pause that I instantly understood why the food was so bad.  If the people/person or conglomerate that owns BRAVO thinks that it is a bonus point to have a chef in every kitchen in a RESTAURANT well then how much could they possibly care about the food or its quality?  Guess what BRAVO you need a chef in every kitchen, it's not a bonus and maybe if you didn't think of it as a point of pride rather then an essential ingredient to a RESTAURANT...well then maybe I would get arugula in my arugula salad and a cake that is...oh I don't know...soft like cake.  I'm just saying, you may want to change that.

Oh, and that second star you got - thank Eric our dashing young waiter.  I liked him so much I didn't complain and that says a lot about his ability."}
{"text":"we were looking forward to trying this new addition to the galleria mall, especially since it is brought to us by Brio according to all the commercials! The dining room was really nice toblook at but we were so disappointed. Went in tonight and it wasn't very busy. We were seated quickly, but the dining room was uncomfortably cold (and I always complain places are too hot!)

 The service was not great, we had to ask to have our drinks refilled several timed. Waited a long time for them to be refilled and they had so much ice in them they were gone with only a few sips. The bread basket was never offered to be refilled and my daughter asked for a plain cheese pizza and it came with pepperchini on it (not something a kid wants to eat)

By far the worst was my steak...it was ordered medium and came  rare. I sent it back and a few minutes later the same piece of meat came back barely medium, no apology. 

For the four of us, main dishes only (2 kids, two adults) with only sodas the bill was 80 dollars. 

Bottom dollar, ok food, but kitchen needs to learn how to cook a steak, turn up the heat in the dining room, get more waitstaff and reevaluate the price point!"}
{"text":"The service was excellent, thank you Michelle. The food was great.  The 3 course meal for only $20 ea was a deal. We will definitely come back. For our 1st time here, we received a complimentary flat bread appetizer.  Awesome birthday dinner!"}
{"text":"Not the best 
Disappointed and not fresh
Frozen Microwave food. 
The 3 coarse meal doesn't include desert. It's an extra $6  
Soup or salad plus dish plus $6 for deserts
Deceiving and disappointed
Service was good.
Will not go back"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner, not sure what to expect. It was great! Our server was Gera, really friendly, she made a couple of appetizer recommendations so we ordered the Shrimp Napoli and Crispy Ravioli. I could have had the shrimp for a meal, it was fantastic. My two dinner mates ordered the grilled salmon and really enjoyed it. The salmon had a delicious bed of red peppers, sweet potato, and asparagus. I got the lasagna bolognese, it too was delicious! The atmosphere was soothing and quaint. We were able to have a nice conversation. I will have to come here again the next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Much better than Olive Garden et al. Our server, Sara, was so friendly and professional. The enviorment here is great, along with the affordable delicious food!"}
{"text":"I just got back from a Friday Night dinner (6:30 pm) with a group of 15.  My family was celebrating my cousin's graduation tonight in one of the private rooms reserved for group dining.  I was sooo curious to see how the waitress was going to handle my outspoken family.  Almost, like watching a family member introducing their bf/gf to the family for the first time. I'll be rating my experience from a family style dinner perspective that my uncle paid for, awesome.

Service: 5/5 The waitress assigned to us was fantastic.  Amazing attitude, high energy, moved with a sense of urgency to take care of our group.  She had a busser who assisted with clearing the plates, but she took care of us from beginning to end while simultaneously taking care of her tables in the main room.  One of the best servers I've come across this year.  She was also so patient with our numerous photo requests.
The manager stopped by to make sure everything was ok and said goodbye to us individually when we left.  We appreciated that and thanked him for a great time.

Food: 4/5 Big platters of food was served to us family style in our room. Here's what I had: 

Focaccia bread: Was fresh and very good.  Very impressed right off the bat.
Chopped Salad: Fresh, tasty and just the right amount of dressing.  
Chicken Marsala: Chicken was juicy and the sauce was tasty with the right amount of mushrooms
Pasta Bravo: My favorite dish.  Pasta was prepped perfectly, the roasted red pepper cream was fantastic.  I went through 3 servings like I was carb loading for a marathon.
Shrimp Scampi Pasta: Once again, scored with the sauce and pasta and a good amount of shrimp. 

Creme Brulee: Great custard and the sugar crust. Solid.
Warm Chocolate Cake: I'm not really a chocolate person, but when the chocolate isn't too sweet and there isn't an overwhelmingly chocolaty taste, I'm down.  This was just that, perfect
 
Value:  I didn't pay, but my Uncle who did said the price was fair considering the excellent service and the tasty food.  Not one complaint from a group of 15 who can be amateur food critics at the drop of a dime.

Ambiance: 4/5 Our private group dining area was pleasant.  I really appreciated the oversized plates used for dinner.  It made it easy to pile on the different pastas in one sitting.  Of course I'll find a way to still eat multiple plates regardless, but I digress.

Summary: I was thoroughly impressed with this dining experience, blown away.  I can't reiterate how pleasant our server was.  My aunties are quick to let people know if they think they're doing something wrong, and they were all saying how impressed they were with everything about the group dinner tonight.  
This was my first visit here and I plan on coming back to see how a conventional dinner or happy hour will work out.  Pasta Bravo, some drinks will definitely be part of my updated review in the near future.  Bravo! Bravo Cuciana Italiana..see what I did there? =)"}
{"text":"Went to Bravo last night for dinner. For a Friday night, the restaurant didn't seem busy at all. We got there around 7 pm and were seated right away. I ordered the chicken marsala and my husband got the pasta bravo. Both were really good, but nothing super special. The portions are pretty big. Our waiter was awesome. No complaints. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Just ate lunch here, place looks great! 
The food was super lightweight and delicious. I had the caprese salad, the calamari, and the chicken & pesto spaghettini. I wish the caprese salad had thinner tomatoes but overall it was delicious, the dressing they used was sweet, but not overbearing. The calamari wasn't as crunchy as I hoped it would be but I was a big fan of their sauces on the sides. The spaghettini was so good! It was absolutely perfect. I loved how much vegetables were in it, their ingredients tasted so fresh!
Our server was also very attentive and my overall experience in this place was very pleasant.
Great food, great atmosphere, and awesome customer service! I'm definitely coming back to check out more of their menu and their wines. :)"}
{"text":"We've eaten here about 6 times now and it's been amazing every time. They're fun & friendly and do their jobs well (meaning you're seated, waited on and served in a very timely manner) . The food is FANTASTIC! I highly recommend the Pasta Carbonara and Shrimp Napoli. Even the bread they serve is awesome. We've been to the bigger Brio restaurants in town and this place is so much better! Love love love this place!"}
{"text":"My mom, myself, and a friend went out to eat at this location our waiter was so nice to us and took care of everything we wanted and we never had to ask twice. And even better than that the food was so wonderful it was the best food I've had in a really long time. This place is a must go."}
{"text":"Tried Bravo for the first time today. Having only been open for 6 days we expected a few minor glitches, maybe in service or in execution of dishes but that was not the case. Warm, friendly people greeted us as we came in. We were seated right away and our server, Tasha, came to take care of us immediately. The food was excellent and service superior! We will be back with friends and family"}
{"text":"I'll start off with- the service was great. They were attentive and friendly. 
The food was equivalent to dive bar food quality. Nothing special or worth the price. I've had a better salad for half the price and calamari was absolutely a frozen microwaveable mess. 
Unfortunate. 
The atmosphere is gorgeous! Just wish the food stood up to everything else."}
{"text":"Don't get the \"Pasta BRAVO!\" entree.

Now that we've gotten that out of the way, I think I can say that I've had enough good dishes to recommend this place. Located next to Dillard's and Larsen's Grill and facing Sunset Road, BRAVO! Cucina Italiana provides a sit-down option that's more upscale than other Galleria mall dining options such as Chevy's and Red Robin.

I had the complimentary rosemary focaccia on both occasions. It's soft and herbaceous, and it soaks up all the liquid you might want. Their house olive oil and vinegar is quite tasty, but I wasn't as impressed with the herbed red dipping sauce that they provided on my second visit.

I had Mama's Lasagna Bolognese ($17.99) during that first visit. It isn't exactly a traditional Italian lasagna. It's presented in an oval ceramic bowl, and it has an alfredo sauce and a Bolognese sauce, but it does have that gooey mozzarella on top, ricotta inside, and tasty ground beef spiced in an \"Italian\" way. There was a bit of a vegetable inside that give a crunch, and I enjoyed this as well. Oh, and the server hand-grates Parmesan cheese to top your lasagna to your liking. I had it 50% off on National Lasagna Day, and while I'm not sure how I feel about the full price value, I was quite happy with the deal.

The second time around, I focused on their happy hour menu. They call it \"Bar Bites\" and provide it in the bar / high top seating section 3:30-6:30pm on weekdays, and all day on weekends. I shared some appetizers with my friend because they're such a good deal.

The first app was Arancini ($3.95 Bar Bites price), which they describe as fried cheesy risotto. Maybe risotto is a bit off, and although they do invite comparisons to tater tots, they're very crunchy outside and creamy inside. They went well with either of the two dipping sauces, one a mildly spicy cream (\"diavolo\"), and the other a simple tomato sauce (\"pomodoro\").

The Crispy Mozzarella Ravioli ($4.95 BB) was perhaps more delicious. It has a similar blend of textures as the first app, but richer flavor from the mozzarella. It comes with a horseradish aioli and a marinara sauce. Again, everything was good.

The Spicy Bacon & Boursin Flatbread ($4.95 BB) sounded a lot better than it tasted. It should have been a home run with candied bacon, chared tomato sauce, caramelized onions, mozzarella, parmesan spicy aioli, and green onions. It wasn't bad, but none of the components stood out.

Finally, we split that underwhelming Pasta BRAVO! ($15.99). Underseasoned if al dente rigatoni, underseasoned dry chicken, uninspiring mushrooms, and a decent roasted red pepper sauce needed all the help it could get flavor-wise, and I did have it in the form of leftover sauces from the apps. I just didn't think to use it until the last few bites, and it shouldn't be necessary. I'm disappointed that a dish that bears the restaurant name and is described as their \"signature dish\" was so underwhelming, but at least a $10-off-an-entree birthday credit via their myBRAVO rewards program took the sting out of the wallet.

I didn't have any service issues, especially not on today's visit. They took orders and delivered food promptly (all apps simultaneously, entree son enough afterward). Also, they processed discounts just fine. I was glad to see that the BOGO Bar Bites appetizer w/ Yelp check-in worked in addition to the $10 credit.

I avoided downgrading my rating to three stars because I would definitely come back to BRAVO! for cheap happy hour appetizers and the lasagna. Legit sit-down restaurants are few and far between in this area of Henderson near Sunset Station, but it looks like this sister restaurant of Brio Tuscan Grille has managed to fill a neighborhood niche, give or take one particular pasta dish.

(UPDATE 12/23/15: Visit #3. Had $10 credit again for some reason, so I went back to Bar Bites. My favorite tonight was the Bravo! Fries at $3.95, with well-seasoned fries, delicious crumbled bacon, gorgonzola, creamy horseradish aioli, and green onions cut on the bias. The Bravo! Burger at $5.95 is quite serviceable overall with American cheese, the same aioli as the above fries, and unadorned fries w/ a side of ketchup. I thought the bun was rather bready though, and the patty wasn't perfectly medium-rare throughout. The Crispy Shrimp Napoli, $5.95, was the most disappointing due to too-soft shrimp and a relatively tame/bland sauce.)"}
{"text":"Delicious food!  Really nice outdoor patio too, with comfortable patio furniture and open fire pits.  Four of us all enjoyed the chopped salads and entrees, including lasagna, Pasta Bravo, and Pasta Fra Diavolo.  Very good happy hour appetizers too, especially the calamari (prepared perfectly, better than most), flatbread and Shrimp Napoli.  Cheap drinks during happy hour. Worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Shrimp app was good, service was ok, place was cold, lobster bisque was bad, and the Romano salad was ok. Might try again but not for awhile"}
{"text":"I came across this new restaurant at the galleria mall only because there was a 45min wait time at Gen kbbq lol. For apps, we ordered spicy shrimp and omg it was so good! For main course, I ordered eggplant Parmesan and the boyfriend had spaghetti with meatballs, both were so delicious! I like how their entrees are not drenched in so much sauce, However, they did not give us enough pasta! And then for dessert, you must have the cannoli! It was super yummy!"}
{"text":"The food was absolutely amazing... The hostess, chef, bartender, our waiter *Sherif and all the other staff were friendly, and were very personable. It was Sherif's second day and the entire staff seemed to be very helpful and understanding with him.  I will def. Be returning. My husband had the Shrimp Scampi and I had ordered Bravo Pasta. I would recommend both, also ordered spinach and artichoke dip. Everything was great. I love how they are running this restaurant. It says a lot about the management."}
{"text":"Went there to meet a friend for a drink at their bar. It's a nice place if you want a quiet non smoky place to catch up with a friend. Really friendly staff. Good wine selection. They gave us a free shrimp appetizer and it was really tasty.  I'll be going back for sure."}
{"text":"Just had my first dining experience at Bravo.  It was amazing! Nice decor, great service, and excellent food.  I'll definitely go back again."}
{"text":"I am floored at the prices on their menu. I will start there. When you walk in, it's like you walked into one of the fancier restaurants in the area. Yet, their pricing is so amazing. Service was impeccable. They were more than willing to move me seats when I asked (we were seated near the door to the patio seating & I get cold very easily). Completely professional wait staff & floor staff at all times. Our waitress, I believe her name was Rebecca (short blonde curly hair), made amazing recommendations. I had the chicken Marsala (sp?) since they didn't have chicken parm on their menu for the day. It was only $14 & honestly big enough to feed 2 people. My daughter got the kid's chicken parm, which was only $5 & as big as an adult plate. I am so baffled at the ambience, the pricing, the food quality, & the serving sizes. 
This place does NOT cut any corners. I highly recommend going & I am not upset with myself for not trying this place sooner. 
Thank you Bravo for this amazing lunch! You earned yourself a new repeat patron today!"}
{"text":"I was there last night and could not believe how horrible of service I had. I read their menu and it said 2 dinner courses for & 16.99. You had to choose from certain items on the menu to get that price. When the bill came they charged me $16.99 for each meal. When I asked about it they told me that is not what that said. Well it is what it says. If it wad gonna be $16.99 each I would have picked whatever I wanted off the menu. Not the selected dinners for that special. Never going back. Very bad advertising."}
{"text":"I've visited this place a few times and decided to finally get around to writing a review. I didn't even know of the Bravo restaurant chain until I came to this one in Henderson.  If I had to sum up this place, I would say that it is a classy looking restaurant with a casual and friendly atmosphere.

The few times that I have been here, one of the managers - Adam would always come around and check on us a couple times throughout the meal to make sure everything was going well. He's got to be one of the friendliest people I've ever met. You can tell that he's a very family oriented person - he was very accommodating of our two sons and even went as far as helping us pack our leftover meals to go himself because we had our hands full. 

The menu is a 1 pager, but in my opinion - the best restaurant perfect the items on their limited menus! Their pizza is a hit with the kids, and their lobster bisque has got to be some of the best I've ever had. It's thick and has actual chunks of lobster in it, you can't beat it. 

I've had their Chicken Parmesan (which is a huge portion) and their carbonara with sunny side egg cracked on top (my favorite). I've never left this place hungry. 

They even give out pieces of dough for the kids to play with - they can create their own shapes and they'll bake it for you!

Great food, great service, great price. I'm giving this place a 5. Keep up the good work Adam!"}
{"text":"I'm glad the Galleria mall has incorporated more diverse restaurants like Bravo. Walking in, I was blown away on how spacious and elegant it looked. Especially for being in the mall. We ordered the calamari as a starting appetizer. This was maybe one of the best calamari I have ever had. The Focaccia bread tasted fresh and it's dipping sauce tasted amazing. I was getting kind of full already so I decided to try the Grilled Salmon pasta. The salmon was flavorful and the pasta was light. We couldn't decide on the dessert so we ended up getting the dessert trio. It included vanilla creme brûlée, chocolate brownie and a cannoli. The desserts made my taste buds explode and my stomach happy. They were still warm like it came out of an oven and didn't taste bland at all. 
The only complaint I had was our waiter taking too long. We could see there was a mini meeting going on, but can't it wait till later? I think it took 20 minutes to ask and receive our check. The busser even asked if we got our check yet. Our waiter could of at least said I'm sorry for the wait or something like that.

Overall, I would come back for the food. Service needs a little improvement though."}
{"text":"A bit fancy for a mall restaurant but a welcome edition to the community! Newly built in the Galleria Mall. Spacious dining room and outdoor seating available. Staff was friendly and eager to please. 

The fresh baked Focaccia Bread and dipping oil they bring out before hand is fantastic. Some of the best table bread I've had. 

I started the meal with the Insulata Della Casa Salad. It was made with fresh lettuce, tomatoes, black olives and cucumbers tossed in feta and a Parmesan dressing. Everything was crisp and fresh. The salad was huge, enough to share with another. 

We also tried the Italian Wedding Soup. It was fantastic. It tasted fresh made. It was full of carrots, greens, orzo and little meatballs. It was very good, I'd order it again. It tastes homemade. 

For our entree' my son tried the Fettuccine Alfredo which was a bit thicker than I like but still good and the pasta tasted fresh made. He loved it and ate the whole dish. 

My husband tried a pizza. He likened it to Grimaldi's which is his favorite!! It's an authentic style pizza with a homemade chewy crust that still crunches a bit when you bite into it. 

I ordered the Pasta Bravo, their house specialty. I asked for Campanelle instead of the rigatoni it comes with. It was delicious! The sauce was creamy, spicy and tasted fresh made. The mushrooms were fat and still had some crunch to them. The chicken was tender, although I would have preferred a seasoned grilled chicken, it was kind of bland but the sauce corrected any blandness. 

This place is great! We'll absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"I must admit, I almost didn't come here since Bravo only had 3.5 stars on Yelp. But, when I went to make reservations on OpenTable, I noticed it was 4.4 stars, so I figured why not? I'm so glad I did!!

I started out with the strawberry mojito. It was wonderful. Freshly muddled lime and all!

They bring out bread with what I assume was red pepper infused olive oil/spices. It was really yummy (I ate it all, naturally). 

As an appetizer, I ordered the lobster bisque. It was good, but nothing special. It was thicker than I'm used to (not necessarily a bad thing) and it did have big chunks of real lobster in it, so that was nice. 

I ordered the Woozie as my entree (basically fettuccine Alfredo with chicken and spinach). The pasta was PERFECTLY al dente. Couldn't have been cooked any better! The Alfredo sauce was also delicious and I ate every bite (and lapped up the rest with my leftover bread). 

Creme brûlée is my weakness. Whenever I see it on the menu, I have to order it. I was almost upset to see it on the menu here because I was so full, but I ordered it anyways. And I'm glad I did. It definitely places in the top 5 I've ever had (excluding the times I've been to Italy, of course). It's small and manageable, so I definitely recommend it even if you're full! 

I arrived at 7:45 and had all my food/drink by 8. So, they definitely get you in quickly. I sat in their outdoor area which was nice. I was sort of nervous about eating at a chain, but it didn't let me down. I love Italian food and I was blown away by Bravo!!"}
{"text":"I was excited when I saw Bravo was opening near my house because Bravo was my favorite restaurant when I was in college. I just had to give it a try to see if I still liked it as much as I did back then. We stopped in for lunch last weekend. I can tell that they are making a serious effort with service as a new location. I hope that they keep it up because the service was great and very attentive. 

The herbed bread with seasoned dipping oil was as good as I remember it being. I just wish they provided a little more oil because the tiny dish comes out with barely any oil on it. 

I remember that they always had good salads so I started with the insalata della casa. This salad has bacon, crispy pasta, and a parmesan dressing in addition to the vegetables. The salad was even better than I remember. My husband hates all vegetables and he was disappointed that he had passed on salad.

For lunch I ordered the lobster ravioli with vodka sauce and my husband ordered the sausage sacchetti with tomato sauce. The ravioli was good with plenty of flavor and even tiny pieces of shrimp on top. The portion was perfect for me, just enough food without being over the top. I liked my husband's dish more though. The sauce on the sacchetti was bolder than my vodka sauce and I loved it.

I would say Bravo is leaps and bounds above an Olive Garden and closer to a Maggiano's quality. Awesome food and service at very reasonable prices. We'll add this to our list of regular restaurants to visit."}
{"text":"I had lunch there today and the service and food were amazing. Ernesto was our server and he was on top of everything. I never asked for a refill because he was right there with a new one. I had the eggplant Parmesan and it was a 1000 times better than Brio. I love eggplant and stopped getting it at brio because the quality of food has seriously gone downhill there. The only complaint I had was that the food could have been hotter. But I saw it come out of the window and tight on to the tray and to our table so I know it wasn't the server. I've waited tables for awhile and notice EVERYTHING. I actually can't wait to return and have the yummy cheesecake Ernesto suggested. This is the best food and service I've had in a WHILE."}
{"text":"The service here was amazing! Everything that I ordered had incredible flavor, and was portioned just right. It was a little pricey, but definitely quality food in a relaxing environment."}
{"text":"They decided to completely redo the menu and took off all our favorite dishes...including the Fra Diavolo.
We came in tonight and were so disappointed that we left. I don't understand why Bravo would mess with their menu and not even offer anything close to the old favorites. There's no point in coming here anymore.
Cutting up my Bravo Rewards card."}
{"text":"Love this place! Awesome ambience and great food selections, staff is always friendly as well 2 thumbs up"}
{"text":"Great service! Delish food! Reservations kept! Large party seating that is comfy! Pork chops are a must! Split the salad for us! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Went here for Father's day. The restaurant is located by/in the Galleria mall in Henderson. Can a good restaurant be in such a location? Absolutely!

I had my doubts since the eatery is not in a freestanding building (but attached to a mall...). I was blown away by the ambiance of the place and the food was top notch. The portions looked small until I started eating. I only got halfway through my dish when I hit a wall and couldn't go any further. 

I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Was really sad because the first time I came here it was great....but this time not so much...every person seemed like they were doing us a favor for seating us or waiting on us.....the waitress was a complete waste of employment. I asked for ice and more bread and she said ...\"Jesus\" under her breath...like ordering more bread was so taxing for her........adriana was the worst....I'd swear and call her something but not worth it"}
{"text":"This is a wonderful Italian restaurant. My husband and I have eaten there three times. I joined the Bravo club and they send me $10.00 off coupons. The food is excellent and the restaurant is so pretty with all the windows around. The last time my daughter had the salmon, I had the talapia and my husband had the prime rib, all delicious. The service is also excellent."}
{"text":"I visited your restaurant last night for the first time.   I came with group of 9 women ( our Bunco club) .. we had a beautiful side room .. we can get loud..  This was perfect..we were blessed to have a waitress named Becca.. she was fabulous. She provided excellent service, was very accommodating...we played a couple of party games ..she delivered a trash bag for all of the wrappings ..with a smile and said she would clean it up... of course we didn't let her..she had enough to do with serving the 9 of us. Becca ..we truly appreciated your outstanding service.  So let's talk food ! Super Yummy ...served hot ..which is unusual for a large group. Everyone ordered something different and we all loved our food..so delicious and large portions. Bravo is clean.. and could be even romantic if you visit with someone special.  We sat around the fireplace and Becca took a group photo of us all.   Well Done Bravo !!! I will be returning soon to celebrate my husband's birthday. He's going to love those huge yummy pork chops."}
{"text":"Our Server Tasha was awesome.  We ordered 2 appetizers, the Caprese Salad and Calamari, both were delicious.
The Pepperoni Pizza was also very good.
We will definitely come back.  There menu has a wide selection.  I am very happy that they have a rewards program.  Everyone is very professional and nice."}
{"text":"Amazing happy hour! 
Definitely worth coming for it. I don't remember the times during the week, but it's all day during the weekend!! My kind of happy hour. 

I always get the caprese salad HH3.95, and the crispy shrimp Napoli HH5.95. They're normal dish size for better discount. 
Cocktails range from 4-6 dollars. I enjoy the Pinot Grigio wine and Italian lemonade 

Our bartender Brian was so nice, he mixes a mean cocktail, and quick to serve us when we need it."}
{"text":"I am starting to understand why people don't like this place anymore....they are not consistent.

We came during happy hour, they offer a Moscow Mule, I cannot have vodka so I asked if they can do a Mexican or Irish and the Bartendar said NO?  When I asked why she said it's because it comes out of the inventory and they are very strict with their inventory.

So even though the food is decent, this is not a place I will come back to for happy hour.  The lack of consistency may make it that I stop coming here altogether, because like other Yelp reviews, you are expecting to come find something and what you find is change....

Change is good however, when you take certain foods off the menu or you cannot deviate from a happy hour drink because of an allergy, the customer does not come first, the bottom dollar and inventory is apparently more important to them then customers coming in and enjoying themselves...

The above was a previous visit, now from today...when the menu says mixed greens, in the store it's normally a Spring Mix, NOT HERE!  This salad with mixed greens was Chopped Romain Lettuce mixed with everything else??  I guess that's mixed greens???  Sadly after tonight's visit this place will be off our list for good.  I still encourage other Yelpers to give this place a try and write your review with your honest opinion."}
{"text":"For a chain, Bravo is fantastic!  The bread is delicious and the food is always great.  I had a filet mignon that was seared \"Scampi style\" and have also had the chicken scallopini.  Salads are delicious, service is great, and atmosphere is adequate.

The only reason it's not 5 stars is the tables are very close together and somewhat cramped."}
{"text":"Excellent food especially eggplant Parmesan.  Parking is terrible because it is in the Mall.  Very delicious Caesar salad also.   Husband had filet and enjoyed it very much. Salad was ala cartel as is soup also.  Excellent bread.  We always enjoy this place although it is a bit noisy."}
{"text":"One of my family favorites! I grew up eating here so many times, but this review is for my most recent visit for a weekday lunch. The restaurant was mostly empty except for a few tables, so there was no problem getting a table without a reservation. Bravo had this awesome lunch special where you choose a soup or salad, and two 1/2 portion of their classic pastas for $14.99. I chose the Della Casa salad, which came in a generous portion size and had nice crunchy bacon bits on top. 

For my two pastas I chose my all time favorite, pasta woozie, which is a fettuccine Alfredo with spinach and chicken and the pasta bravo, a rigatoni pasta with an amazing red pepper cream sauce topped with chicken and mushrooms. Both pastas came in decent portion sizes and kept me full until dinner.

Overall, this is an awesome lunch deal with nice portion sizes and a great way to try some of their classic pastas."}
{"text":"Veal Parm is bomb. This restaurant makes me not give up on italian food. (I'm Asian) lol. Amazing amazing food and service is excellent. Our waiter Hugo is the nicest guy. He is very helpful and prompt woth our requests. 

This place is now my go to italian spot. Will surely be back."}
{"text":"I figured it would be better given a pretty solid 4-Star rating. 

Service was fine, my drink was always refreshed before it ran out. Plenty of gluten free possibilities. Pretty standard Italian classics on the menu. 

It just wasn't very good. 

My fra diavolo came as chicken instead of shrimp, but that happens. Wouldn't even have knocked off a star, as they were quick to acknowledge and fix that. Well done there. 

But it also didn't taste like much of anything. Suffice to say, it tasted like a really good lean cuisine, and about was about twice the size. Salt and cheese didn't help. The sauce had the look and texture of too much emulsifier in the recipe. And the pasta was over cooked. 

Others in the group seemed pleased with their meals, enjoying the various Alfredo, Caprese, Scampi, and Parm options. 

Not awful. Just hoping my family never decides to return. I'll never be back on my own, for sure. For $5-8 more I'd drive a couple miles to Ventano every time."}
{"text":"There was a bug in my wife's dinner. Disgusting. They took the charge off the bill for her dinner, which is appropriate. But still. Bugs should not be in \"freshly\" prepared food."}
{"text":"Wanted to try a new spot for Italian food and found this while driving by The Galleria. It has a big outdoor dining area, but it was too cold this evening to be outside. While looking at the menu outside, the hostess was wiping down the doors and cane outside to ask if we needed help with the menu. We asked if they had fettuccini Alfredo and she said they have a Pasta Woozie that would be equivalent, but it has spinach in it, but I can request no spinach.

We decided to go in and have dinner there. The restaurant is actually pretty big with a bar to the left, a sectioned off private dining area for large parties, and a central dining area. The decor was warm and intimate, but still casual enough for me to feel welcomed. Our server Jeraldine was attentive and fast. 

A side of rosemary foccacia bread served with their signature dipping olive oil was a good start. The bread was soft and not crumbly. The lobster bisque was creamy and had good chunks of lobster in it. Definitely would reorder again. The calamari appetizer came with two sauces on the plate. A creamy horseradish and a pompodoro sauce. The horseradish did not have a strong bite to it, which was fine by me. The pompodoro had a strong alcohol aftertaste to me, which I did not like at all. The waitress explained to me that pompodoro was just tomatoes, so no alcohol was in it. My s.o. did not taste the same thing I did and said the red sauce tasted fine. So I just skipped the sauce afterwards. The calamari was a little heavy breaded, so probably will not reorder again. The fettucuni alfredo was creamy and rich. The pasta dish I got with grilled chicken and a slightly spicy red sauce was full of robust tomato flavor, so I enjoyed that. The Island Smash cocktail was refreshing and had a pineapple and basil garnish. The hostess and waitress checked on us several times to make sure we were happy and had everything we needed. Just really good service from start to finish.

All in all, I would come back to dine again. The food was familiar Italians fare with slight adjustments to make it their own. Service is great throughout our meal. Prices are average. Except the appetizers which were almost the same price point as the entrees, but service makes up for it. Atmosphere would make for good casual date night, but still welcoming for families."}
{"text":"The food is so good here!!!
It's located in a mall so it's kind of convenient but I worry about the holidays 
Sadly I moved away 6 months ago
But great service
Great bartenders 
I liked the managers they are nice 
I never disliked anything we ever ordered. 
Ate there 6x in 2 months"}
{"text":"Excellent! I am so happy that this place came to the Galleria Mall here in Henderson! It is a classy little restaurant with beautiful indoor or outdoor seating! The food is all so fresh and healthy! My kids, who are generally very picky and steer clear of anything \"healthy, even loved the food here! 
It is a perfect place to relax after a day of shopping!"}
{"text":"We stopped here while we were shopping at the mall for a couple glasses of wine and a small bite and had a great experience.  Good wine selection. Excellent service. We decided on the pepperoni pizza and it was delicious! I'm excited that there is an above average dining option at this mall!"}
{"text":"First time eating at Bravo Cucina Italiana and was thoroughly impressed! The decor provides an open and welcoming ambiance and the servers all wear white shirts and ties. Cesar B. was our server and did a phenomenal job - personable, knowledgeable, perceptive, and quick on refills. Rosemary bread basket and dip were fantastic. Both my wife and I ordered the White Peach Palmer (white peach syrup with tea & lemonade) and loved it! Just the right amount of sweetness and tanginess. I ordered the Pasta Fra Diavolo with shrimp. It tasted as good as it looks in the pics, excellent flavor and rich creamy sauce. My wife ordered the Pasta Woozie dish. The sauce and pasta tasted great and the large spinach leaves tossed in added to the flavor and texture. Both our dishes were part of a three course meal special. For about $17/$18 each we got a large Caesar salad (one of the best I've tasted), the main dish, and a small dessert (peanut butter brownie & chic chip canoli were great). Great value and great experience...will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, excellent service from Chef Filo Ramirez!!!!! My husband loved this place and we will return very soon! Tho we didn't had the best experience from the Hostess. The server and food changed completely our opinion from the whole journey."}
{"text":"You have to do Happy Hour and get the shrimp.  The meatball appetizer will blow your mind.  Anything with the masala sauce is a must."}
{"text":"Looking for a place to grab dinner we choose Bravo since we were in the area. We loved it!!!! great food, great service, and now its one of our favorite go to places!!"}
{"text":"The lobster bisque is WONDERFUL, GREAT FANTASTIC, I will come back just for that no matter how rotten the place might or mighr not be. . Ok now the rest we did not like our waiter, he was not very personable, forgot half our drinks, dis not come by enough even though the pla e was not busy. Did not ask us if it was our first time but I noticed a waitress ask some customers beside that and they got a complementary appetizer. The food was fantastic I had the spaghetti and my wife had the chicken parm."}
{"text":"Service was slow, but it was mother's day.  Had the grilled chicken chopped salad and it wasn't that great, but not bad either.  My son's kid's meal chicken parm was actually really really good.  The \"mac n cheese\" that came with it was extremely good.  Maybe next time I'll pretend to be a kid and order it for myself."}
{"text":"Excellent service in the bar from Bryan.  Great FRESH food.  I have to say, Bryan did seem a bit overwhelmed at moments being the bartender, server, and patio server.  I got the Chicken Milanese on his suggestion.  Needed a little extra sauce.  I cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"The Bravo Cucina used to be my favorite place. 
After today we are so disappointed and annoyed. 
The menu has change, \" there is nothing I can do about that\". 
The hostess sat us and said our server will be right with us. 
15 mins later still no one has stopped by to see if we need anything. I see other server and bus boy chatting at the cooking station and no one to bother and ask if we need something to drink mind you it was 114 degree outside. I guess the hostess saw us getting irritated and came and ask. 
We told her that no one stop by. She went to the cooking stations where the servers are and 4 of them just looked at each other.  It seems that no one knew who's table it is. Regardless of who's table they should have been working together as a team. They should got each others back. 
We ended up going to Ventano instead and had an excellent dinner."}
{"text":"Really nice atmosphere, beautiful bar area and patio as well. Dining room for parties or groups. Great service, dining bonus app or card for perks. Very good menu selection and don't skip the dessert!"}
{"text":"Was here again last week and everything was still delicious. Have to mention our server Cassandra, she's awesome! She was attentive without being intrusive and super friendly. We will definitely request her from now on."}
{"text":"Great lunch on a beautiful 80+ degree spring day. Enjoyed patio seating. Server Rebecca and the manager Adam were fantastic. Food came out hot, fast and tasty."}
{"text":"Came here tonight for our anniversary. We were seated right away, the ambiance is perfect for a relaxing date night. We were served by Yul who is very cool, attentive and friendly. In fact, all the other staff checked in on us and greeted us for our anniversary which was sweet. It was such a lovely experience. Food was delicious. We ordered the crispy ravioli (very good and addicting) for an appetizer. We also took advantage of the Dinner for 2 promotion. My husband and I left happy and full. We will surely be back and will recommend Bravo! to our friends and family."}
{"text":"Great food for the price!  My children's entrees were cooked to perfection...chicken fingers lightly crispy, tilapia wonderful.  I had chicken pesto spaghettini? It was little mushy and I did not taste any pesto.  Professional waitstaff, Jordan, took our entrees and packaged them personally."}
{"text":"This place was really great.  The complimentary bread they gave us was really good.  The dipping sauce wasn't your typical olive oil and vinegar, it had some type of dried tomato bits in there.  I actually enjoyed it.  My friends and I devoured the bread easily. 

The waitress said the plates were pretty big, and was easily sharable with two people so a couple of friends split an an entree. I however, didn't think it was that big of a plate.  When I go to other italian restaurants, I usually only eat about a third of a plate, here I finished like 4/5 of my plate.  I'm not sure if I was just really hungry, or if the plates seem smaller.  

I got the shrimp pasta in the \"diavalo\" sauce and it was delicious! It had a nice kick to it.  I think it tastes similar to the alla vodka sauce, but it had a taste of some herbs and a little spice which i prefer over the simple creaminess of the alla vodka.

I very much enjoyed my meal and would recommend it!"}
{"text":"The portions were big and the food was delicious! The service was great. The server was very attentive and quick. The music and ambiance are delightful.  Overall we had a great experience dining here."}
{"text":"This place has one of the best happy hours in the area! I have only visited this restaurant during happy hour (3:30-6:30) so my review will be based on the food from that menu. Their happy hour consist of wines or cocktails from the house. Whichever you decide to get will be a hit! They also have a list of side dishes you can order (fried shrimp, flatbread, pizza dips, among many other) for a very reasonable price. I have pretty much tasted all of their happy hour menu items and there has not been one that I do not like. I would recommend trying the shrimp at least once because it is mouth watering. 

I was also impressed with the cleanliness of the bar and restaurant. I would also like to thank the staff for being prompt and friendly!"}
{"text":"Delicious! You can pretty much get anything you want here since you can alter any item on the menu just to your liking, but why would you do that when their food is fantastic already?  The service is great, the ambiance is just right, and the food makes you remember why the Olive Garden and Macaroni Grill just don't make the cut.   Depending on what you order, meals can get a little pricey, but I felt the food was well worth it.  A lovely taste of \"upscale\" in a city that is quite the contrary."}
{"text":"Went to BRAVO! tonight for birthday celebration.  Ambiance is nice but the food was a disappointment. First of all, we ordered calamari as an appetizer.  It came to the table totally overcooked, hard, and unseasoned.  We told the server and he did have the kitchen remake the calamari. Second round was better but nothing to be impressed by.  The Caesar salad was the best part of the meal. Salad was fresh and dressing was plentiful and tasty. Next the main courses...between the four of us we had a Margherita pizza, Chicken Scallopini, Chicken Marsala, and Chicken parmigiana.  Pizza was tasteless, chicken scallopini looked like a half portion and pasta was hard and not cooked enough, chicken parmigiana was ok but quality of Olive Garden, chicken Marsala sauce was loaded with salt--surprised my daughter doesn't have canker sores in her mouth and the green beans were hard enough to use as a boomerang. Then we had to ask for a dessert for my husband for his birthday! I would think it would've been recognized since it was listed on the reso! Overall, the entire party was disappointed and will not return for a 2nd bad experience! Not impressed and prices aren't warranted compared to food quality. Mediocre at best...GO TO BRIO, instead..."}
{"text":"This was potentially one of the worst meals I have ever had in my life. First off, the service was beyond slow and the restaurant wasn't even half full. Secondly and most importantly, I ordered off of the gluten free menu because I have an allergy and received my pasta. After being halfway done with my pasta, the waitress makes her way over to check on us only to notify me that what I was eating was not gluten free. They did not make us pay for our meal after I asked to speak to the manager; however, I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. Happy Sweetest Day!"}
{"text":"Really needed this in the area. For the price you can't get a better meal. The service was great. Our server was Jennifer.  She was very informative and helped make sure my wife's dish was exactly what she wanted.  We will definitely be back.   As my wife said \"I think we found our new favorite Italian place\"."}
{"text":"My oldest niece, Jessa, was visiting from Utah and she loves Italian food. Plus, being a teenager she also loves the mall. So I knew Bravo would be the perfect place to take her and my other niece Jannaliese (who's 7).  Bravo has been on my radar since they have been upgrading the Galleria mall. I've heard many good things from the Yelp community about this place. 

We went on a Tuesday afternoon for lunch and they had a semi busy lunch crowd. The hostess seated all three of us quickly. Our waiter was there in a flash with water and a kids menu for Janna. He asked if we had been there before and since we had not he explained the lunch specials. Plus, on that particular day it was national lasagna day and they were serving a full portion for half price. What a great deal! 

We all looked at our menus and decided on what to get. I loved the kids menu for Janna. She had lots of options and she could color on her menu. They included games that kept her busy and even her own kids cup. My niece Jessa ordered the Pasta Woozie which  was their version of Fettuccine Alfredo with chicken and spinach. Jana ordered the Chicken Fingers off the kids menu and I had the Lobster Bisque. After taking our order our waiter brought us some delicious breadsticks that were more of a focaccia bread with a flavored oil to dip them in. While we were waiting for our lunch our waiter brought Jana out some pizza dough to play with and make into whatever she wanted. After she was done they will bake it for her. 

Our food came out in a reasonable time seeing that it was lunch time and they were starting to fill up. Jessa's was a large bowl to tasty looking noodles, sauce and chicken. Which was really was excellent. The sauce had a great cheesy bite to it. Jana's Chicken Fingers were made with actual chicken and it even came with fries and fruit. Just a suggestion check the blueberries! There were several that I had to pick out for her that were rotten or just not edible. My Lobster Bisque had great flavor despite its unsavory appearance. It had obviously been sitting out while my nieces food was finishing being cooked because it had a film on the top after sitting. It was garnished with some bay shrimp which did add a nice texture difference in the creamy soup.

When we were given back Jana's pizza dough masterpiece we all quickly realized that it was not the art piece she had made, but another child's. Since she wasn't supposed to eat it I didn't make a big deal about it. 

The atmosphere is definitely fancier then the food court at the mall. Bravo is covered in dark woods and high vaulted ceilings. Both my nieces kept saying how fancy it was. The service was just ok. I know our waiter tried, but fell short a bit. Waiting for our check and my card took a lot longer then it needed to. 

I came in expecting to love Bravo and I left thinking it was ok. There are a few things they still need to work out being that they are still new. But things like rotten blueberries are just not ok to me. I'll definitely give this place another shot in the future."}
{"text":"My first time and will NOT be my last.  The food was very good and our waiter Daniel was awesome.  Can't wait to try other dishes on their menu.  

Great patio entertainment during happy hour.  If you haven't gone yet, check them out."}
{"text":"Just had dinner here with my husband and we are leaving happy and full. For a Friday night this place was not busy. We missed happy hour by a few minutes, but was still able to click on the Yelp check in and redeem an appetizer for a future visit. The menu here is not big and even offered gluten free options. We started off with the calamari. It came with  horseradish sauce and marinara sauce. The calamari was not as crispy as I usually like it, but the breading to protein ratio was good and seasoned appropriately . I wish the horseradish sauce would have more tang to it, but I enjoyed mixing the two sauces. 
My husband decided to do their promotion which was a two course meal starting at $12.99 that included a entree and salad. He got the shrimp scampi pasta and chopped salad. The salad was a good size. I enjoyed the red wine vinegar dressing, but felt it was drenched a little more than I liked. The pasta was good. It came with angel hair and garlic bread. I thought the sauce was a little peppery, but I added lemon which made it taste so much better. I knew I wouldn't want a whole meal so I decided to try their meatball and polenta appetizer as my meal. But in all honesty, we were so full after eating the calamari and the complimentary herb bread that I barely touched the meatball. I did try it and I loved the polenta. It was perfectly seasoned and had a great consistency. The marsala glaze was good with the meatball. All in all this place is good. I do agree the service could be a little better, but our server did try. I was more upset at the fact that she didn't ask if we wanted bread or dessert. We had to ask for ourselves. But she did make great recommendations, so thank you!"}
{"text":"SERIOUSLY Great Italian Food! Appetizers were delicious.. Great Happy Hour! Had a Ginger Pineapple Martini that was TO DIE for! The manager of the restaurant was very attentive & can't help but compliment his hair! This restaurant has the BEST personality out of any Italian restaurant I have ever enjoyed Hands Down! I will DEFINITELY be back!"}
{"text":"We came in about 45 minutes before closing time. Our waitress was very friendly and personable. I mentioned that we hadn't been to Bravo before and we were surprised with an appetizer on the house (very cool). The bread and oil was delicious, the app was delicious, our salads were delicious. Here is where the star was lost: 1. There was a solid 30 minute gap between the time that we finished our salads and the time that we got our entrees. 2. We weren't offered dessert, or even a dessert menu. I have worked in the restaurant industry before. I know that people coming in at closing time is annoying but I feel like we were there in plenty of time to be offered dessert. We felt rushed finishing our entrees because they took so long to receive even though we were one of only 3-4 tables occupied in the restaurant. Survey says: I'm not totally deterred, we may be back. I wasn't impressed enough to put Bravo on our restaurant regular rotation list."}
{"text":"5 of us had lunch on 2/25/16. Our waitress, Rosalynn, was terrific. The food was  very, very good and the portions were generous. The atmosphere was very pleasant. Great experience."}
{"text":"Better than Olive Garden, not as good as most mom and pop Italian food or high end places. Got the rigatoni bolognese (sp?) and the meatballs and polenta. Both decent. I like my bolognese as a thick meat sauce but it seems more tomato chunks than meat.  Meatballs and polenta were good.  I like that they gave me bread and olive oil with my to go order."}
{"text":"Wonderful Itaian food. The staff were amazing to us and the food was really yummy! Oh, and get the peach tea (In The Bottle) so GOOOOD!"}
{"text":"I did not expect this place to be so good.  It's just outside the mall, but is excellent!  The food was great, service was great, and atmosphere was very nice.  I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I feel like dining is all about the experience, and Bravo knows it.

I tried Bravo for the first time a couple weeks ago and it was probably one of the best dining experiences I've had. Besides the food being good, the service was just plain amazing. Our waiter Aaron was probably one of the sweetest guys I've ever met. He recommended a few dishes for us, and told us the reasons why he liked them so much. 

To start we ordered the Calamari, which was perfectly cooked. I hate when calamari is too soggy or when it's overly crispy, but this calamari was just right. It was paired with a spicy horseradish sauce (MUST TRY) and a marinara sauce. 

I ordered the classic spaghettini and meatballs. Now, this spaghettini was different from others in the sense that it had a pomodoro and marinara sauce mixed together. That mixed with the meatballs was absolute perfection.

Bravo is definitely a must try if you're in the Henderson area. I'll be back soon to get my pasta fix."}
{"text":"Had dinner there last night and it was everything I was hoping for! Cesar was our server and he was excellent!  The fried ravioli and meatballs with polenta apps were delicious.  I enjoyed the salmon and husband had the sausage with pasta. Both amazing!  Ended with their creme brulee cheesecake, so good!! Can't wait to go back and try more yummies!"}
{"text":"This is my second time here in a week. Excellent service and very good food. Nice open seating concept with plenty of room to stretch out. Eggplant Parm is really good as is the Spaghetti and meatballs.
Haven't had dessert yet so no opinion. Only 1 negative comment I am a big proponent of Management staff working the floor and checking with guests. 3 Managers moving around constantly and never once stopped by. During our 45 minutes I only saw one of the female managers stop at a table. If Carl's JR Managers can check on a guest so can or so should fancier places.
Good place to try for Italian."}
{"text":"Great Italian food. I had the special course meal option. Starter course with a chopped salad light a refreshing perfect amount of added parmesan  cheese and dressing. Main course the Grilled chicken with sun-dried tomatoes goat cheese. The sun dried tomatoes goat cheese was terrific, the chicken was tasty and paired great with the Yukon gold mashed potatoes. Third course a tiramisu for two was great way to finish the meal. 
The special course meal for 3 courses only cost $20 great price and great meal. 
Definitely would recommend this location and restaurant. The manager was engaged greeting everyone at their table to ensure everything was wonderful. Great impression!!!"}
{"text":"A great happy hour and delicious food! Never disappoints. I have been here many times and it is consistently good. Everyone is friendly and the atmosphere is nice."}
{"text":"Not too bad of a dining experience.  The service was good and helpful, and the place nicely decorated with a peaceful ambiance.  Mostly because of that, I couldn't bring myself to give them 2 Stars.  However, the food was only ok.  The chop salad had way too much red onions.  And the Chicken Marsala need more spices for flavor.  It was a nice surprise that by just checking in on Yelp, the restaurant offered you a free appetizer.   However, only valid in the \"bar and lounge\" area only.  So with our party of 16 in the dining area, the offer was not valid.  Too bad, would've given an extra star for the nice gesture.   Most likely would not dine here again.  Other Italian places in town way better in Town Square or at Fashion show mall."}
{"text":"We split a chicken berry salad and split an eggplant and pasta dinner. The salad served was the wrong one and the pasta with the main dish arrived cold. Our waitress brought us a hot bowl of pasta.
The restaurant is lovely . I also noticed a  nice private room ."}
{"text":"Seriously, this place is it. The food is fresh, servers are beyond pleasant and friendly. The decor is lovely and airy. I feel like it gets overseen a lot. But if you're looking for good food, great combination options, and a lovely dining experience, come to bravo! Ps- they have lit lunch combos and prices too!"}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant on one of our first date nights out since having our son. I admit, it wasn't my first choice but we wanted to stay close by just in case. 

I love the spacious, comfortable and spotless inside. I'd never been there but my husband described it as the \"cheaper\" cousin of Brio. I still thought it was very nice inside. 

The service was quick and friendly. We had less than an hour to make a movie across the street and the server was great. Drinks and food came quickly, glasses were always full, and we didn't have to wait any time at all for our check. 

The food was very good! I tried the Pasta Bravo, their signature dish. I really liked the roasted red pepper cream sauce. The chicken was a little dry but, overall the dish was enjoyable. My husband liked his filet a lot, and it was cooked just as he asked. 

They do have an app with a rewards program. Supposedly you get a birthday coupon, which I was celebrating, but I had just signed up when we got there, so we didn't get a coupon. 

I will definitely consider coming back here with others to dine out nearby!"}
{"text":"We Love going there for happy hour apps & food is always tasty. Service is really good & consistent."}
{"text":"Saw the pic on Yelp so thought we'd give it a try. Delicious! We both had the lunch special with salad and pasta for 10.99. I couldn't be happier with the food. Best Caesar salad I have ever had! Next the Pasta Bravo. It's pasta with chicken and red pepper cream sauce. Delicious. The Rosemary bread served with all meals is so yummy served with an olive oil and sundried tomatoes. They also had us try a flat bread app that had spinach, cheese bacon onion that was really good too.
I think this is my new favorite restaurant :)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend was able to conveniently make a reservation for two on their website. It wasn't too busy when we arrived (around 6:00pm on a Saturday) so we were seated rather quickly. 

Leisha was quick to greet us and get our drink orders then gave us a couple minutes to look over the menu. She was able to answer questions we had about certain dishes and gave us suggestions about an appetizer. 

They brought out warm bread and some sort of oil to dip it in (you can buy it in a bottle for $7 and some change if you really like it!)

We ordered calamari to start -- presentation was beautiful, not heavily battered, sauces were delicious (creamy horseradish and marinara). Definitely recommend! 

My boyfriend ordered the grilled chicken & sun-dried tomato goat cheese with mashed potatoes and green beans. The chicken looked dry but it definitely was not! It's an interesting (but still good) taste, so try it if you're adventurous. 

I ordered the Parmesan crusted beef medallions... omg it was delicious! Recommend, recommend, recommend! The Parmesan crust on top of the three beef medallions was like a cherry on top of ice cream. Then there was this potato medley -- sweet potatoes and crispy potatoes with onions and bacon. Heavenly! 

I'll come back again, but maybe not to spend $24 on three beef medallions. It was good to try, though!"}
{"text":"This place was great.  The food was fresh and tasty.  The service, at 1:00 PM on Saturday, was great.  My water was always filled and my dirty plates were quickly cleared.  The half lasagna and salad was plenty of food for me. The bread and tomato oil they serve with it was amazing!  We will be back here to eat again!"}
{"text":"After a second visit to Bravo, I've become a fan. We had a satisfying first meal at lunch time, but weren't overly impressed. Our second meal left a more lasting, favorable impression. For the most part, we did not feel any of the growing pains that normally would be experienced from a newer restaurant. Bravo is solid option for us and a nice addition to the Galleria expansion.

It's was our fault the we had a pedestrian experience on our first visit mainly because my wife and I ordered pedestrian dishes. I had the fettuccine alla bolognese with a cup of wedding soup and my wife ordered the candied bacon burger. We split the bravo cheesecake for dessert. Everything was satisfactory but I did get a little perturbed from lack of communication by the kitchen because with my seat facing the kitchen, I witnessed the cook sell my pasta well before the burger was finished, leaving my entree to sit dying in the window for at least 7-8 minutes.

Our second visit was enjoyed outside on the patio with perfect weather. I recommend dining alfresco as you have a nice view of the newly built canopy with some palo verdes dominating the nice landscaping. My entree was the spicy scallop marinara and my wife ordered a Bravo chopped salad and the broiled tilapia with spicy tomato sauce. Although these items from the light menu were easy on the calories, they were heavy on the flavor. Comprised of many components, with sweetness from the scallops, tang from the artichokes, bitterness from the spinach, and heat from the sauce, the flavors were still well balanced and I was happy with my choice.

Service was excellent on both visits and everything ran smoothly without complication. Parking is directly in front of the restaurant so your walk won't be too far. There's also a happy hour which could be a possible getaway spot to grab a snack and a drink if the wife is dilly dallying in the mall for too long."}
{"text":"I am never one to embrace chain restaurants, but I gave this one a shot per my friend's request.  I started my meal with a side salad that was doused in dressing and not that fresh (so if you're going to come here...definitely get dressing on the side), but it wasn't so bad. Then came my pasta...I made sure to state twice while ordering that I didn't want chicken in the Pasta Woozie, and what did I get? Chicken. After a few minutes (a suspiciously short time actually) a fresh plate sans-chicken was delivered to me.  My waitress never apologized, but when she came back over, I asked for some parmesan cheese.  That was the last I saw of the waitress until our check was delivered.  The dish itself was nothing special-- not a very rich sauce, boring shrimp, and not a very large serving.  For the price and mediocre service, there are plenty of better places you can go."}
{"text":"Great food and service and a great spot for a celebratory lunch. Lobster bisque and bravo pasta, Yum!!"}
{"text":"I am decidedly an Italian food snob.  There.  I have said it.

I was waiting for Bravo to open to see if it would bring a new place for me to enjoy or be another Italian place I would turn my nose up at.

The most recent visit sealed the deal for me.  And it wasn't my usually Italian food snobbery.

I started with the lobster bisque.  Lobster bisque can be a risky move, but done right, oh, I am in heaven.  It was so good.  I nearly licked the bottom of the bowl.  Some shrimp chunks.  Not salty.  Yum!

I had the most amazing salad!  Mediterranean Roasted Veggie Salad.  Oh it was a taste explosion.  I am not a vegetarian, but this salad sounded too good to pass up.  (Besides, I am dieting.)  The warm grilled salad was so good even my carnivore hubby said it looked good.

Maybe it's not traditional Italian, but this place is worth the trip."}
{"text":"This place has only been open a week, but you wouldn't know it. They really have it together. We made a reservation and we're immediately seated upon arrival. The food was excellent and reasonably priced. We are always looking for a place with patio dining and this was great. The patio overlooks a courtyard with waterfall. It's perfect for dinner with your love or a group of friends. Sangria Rose was tasty and they have low calorie options. I almost didn't yelp because I want to keep this place to ourselves."}
{"text":"What once was \"Bravo Cucina Italiana\" is now \"Brio Costal Kitchen\". We used call ahead seating thinking we were going to be dining at Bravo but when we arrived, we quickly realized the restaurant had changed its name and menu. Although Brio is owned by the same company as Bravo, nothing is the same with the exception of the bread they bring before your meal. With open minds, we entered Brio willing to try it out and hoping that the change wouldn't effect experience. The menu has small plates, offering numerous options to share as appetizer type bites, along with a pasta section and entrees or house specialties. My husband and I shared the buffalo cauliflower and whipped ricotta toast from the small plates section. The buffalo cauliflower was ok but nothing to rave about. Spicy roasted cauliflower with Gorgonzola. The whipped ricotta toast was delicious. For our main dishes we ordered the center cut filet which comes with asparagus and fingerling potatoes and the shrimp scampi pasta. Because I can't eat spicy food I asked the waitress to omit the chile flake in the pasta dish but unfortunately the sauce is pre made and they were unable to do so. Once I learned that they don't make the sauces in house for each entree, I knew these dishes would be less than stellar. But again, I kept an open mind and at my request; they substituted the sauce to just a garlic butter. Easy right? The shrimp scampi pasta was not very good. Bummer! Sauce seemed to be nonexistent and I had to salt it twice. It was angel hair pasta with some diced tomatoes and shrimp. It actually had a fish tank flavor similar to how a goldfish bowl smells if you don't keep it clean. My husband said the steak was ok. It had a bit of an overwhelming rosemary seasoning. The asparagus and potatoes were fine. So here's the worst part. We ordered the infusion flight. A sampling of infused alcohol. Upon starting the last glass we realized there was a bug in the drink. We let our waitress know and the manager took the flight off the bill. Sad to say that Brio doesn't come close to Bravo. They should have left Bravo as it was. No need to change something that was so good. So disappointed. We will miss Bravo."}
{"text":"I had a great time here! Leisha was a professional and tentative server. 5 star for service and food.

We ate early so the place wasn't busy, which is how I like it. We ordered Lobster Ravioli and Veal in addition to the lobster bisque soup, as for drinks a Dr. Pepper and Prosecco. I would come here again to explore the menu more. It is near the mall and I like shopping."}
{"text":"Went to dinner for a family members bday! The menu is such a good of variety! The atmosphere is so nice, seating outside too! Defiantly will return soon, had the Salmon salad one word AMAZING!!!!"}
{"text":"Never understaffed, balanced menu, nice decor. It's a chain restaurant but it feels like the hot new place in town to eat. We come for my mother in laws birthday and they always make her feel special"}
{"text":"Great place and atmosphere! Good prices! The Mediterranean salad is awesome. We also love the service. Jason has always taken care of us and he is the best!! 
Good selection of drinks and deserts!b"}
{"text":"Came here to check out the new restaurant at the Galleria. We had heard that the food was good, and we wanted a new Italian spot, so we decided to go on a Thursday night (so it wasn't too busy).

The wait staff and hostesses were all very attentive and polite. The decor was up to date, and we were seated promptly. 

My husband ordered some pizza, my kids had several items off of the children's menu, and I had pasta with fire roasted peppers and cream sauce. The dish I chose was pretty bland, and the macaroni and cheese the kids had looked like Kraft straight out of the box. The pizza was ok, but the crust was soggy in the middle. 

I really wanted this place to be good, but I probably won't return. 3 stars for service - 0 for food. I'll stick with Maggiano's."}
{"text":"I think this place is in some way related to Brio, which you will know from my review of that restaurant that I didn't have the best experience. I was hesitant to try this place but decided to give it a shot since I had to go to the mall anyways (this place is right outside of the Galleria Mall). Oh man was I glad I did because the food here is freaking fantastic. They bring bread to the table right when you arrive and it's so good. It had rosemary in it and comes with an olive oil mix to dip. For my entree, I went with the grilled salmon and it was cooked to perfection. What I love about this place too is that they note on the menu what items are under 600 calories, which allows me to eat guilt free! 

I've been here a few times since and I honestly have never ordered anything I didn't like. I've tried a handful of their sandwiches, pasta, and dessert and I loved everything. I also recommend the sangria and the peach bellini if you're feeling a refreshing fruity drink. They have a happy hour Yelp check in offer here too so make sure all you Yelpers check in!"}
{"text":"Wow!  We didn't know where to eat tonight, and decided to check out the newer restaurants at the mall.  We decided to have Italian and tried Bravo.  We ere seated immediately and our server came straight to the table.  Our drinks arrived very quickly.  We placed our entree orders and opted to add salad/soup.  Our server commended us for our choices.  The focaccia with olive oil was delicious!  While we were enjoying our bread, another server brought over a Margarita Flatbread, on the house for first-time diners.  My husband enjoyed his Lobster Bisque and my Caprese Salad was delicious!  For entrees, we enjoyed Mama's Lasagna Bolognese and Spicy Scallop Marinara.  The entrees were hot and huge!  We could only eat half, but they were simply delicious.  We enjoyed the fresh grated Parmesan.  

We will definitely come back.  Great service, delicious food and good prices.  You are getting quality for the price, and the price is right"}
{"text":"Great service. Great sausage and broccoli pizza. Staff is always friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Spicy scallops delicious spicy was excellent pasta done right definitely a surprise dish today loved it"}
{"text":"Although the food was amazing, it took them over 40 min to put our drinks on the table which we ordered almost immediately.  They took over 20 minutes to put waters out. We were there to celebrate my grandmas 88th birthday and to see family we haven't seen in a long time.  we had requested a room in the back because she is hard of hearing. When we arrived they told us they didn't have anything in the back available and took us to our table. She couldn't hear much the whole visit.  They took our food ordered while we were still waiting for our drinks which it was expressed that we were displeased.  The drinks finally came and they had either put in the wrong drink orders or the bar did them wrong.  We had to send back several drinks because they weren't what was ordered.  They also didn't put the correct drinks in front of people.  Once we got our drinks it was much better, we ordered our food and it came out great.  The server was trying his best but he looked new and flustered.  He really should have had more help I don't think it was his fault.  For a place that clearly gets busy I would have expected better service.  (Again food was amazing) I would eat here again only for the food not for the service."}
{"text":"For a chain, yep: 5 stars. 

What sealed the deal was finally giving the bar menu a shot today. We've visited this Bravo location dozens of times over the years, we've sampled countless menu items (from pasta to crab cakes to pizza), and we've always had consistently good food and service. This restaurant puts all of the Italian chain restaurants to shame--it's the best food and is very reasonably priced.

Tonight, we got to Bravo around 6:00. The happy hour ends at 6:30, but then starts again at 9. That's pretty nice for those who just want a drink and a light meal a bit later in the evening. We had two sangria rosas and a peroni. The sangrias were fresh and I could tell no corners had been cut in making the drinks. We also shared caprese salad, shrimp napoli, a chicken/bacon/spinach flatbread, and a balsamic onion/portobello mushroom/gorgonzola flatbread. For our party of three, it was the perfect amount of food. Each dish was flavorful, fresh, and tasty. The portions were generous, and as I noted, were great for sharing. It's Bravo's attention to detail that really sets this chain apart.

The bill--for the drinks and each dish--came out to 33.00 before the tip. Considering that most chains are still relying on microwaves, 10 cheese blends, etc. you really can't beat the food at Bravo. It's made-to-order, consistent, and delicious."}
{"text":"What a nice place... Great food, and not expensive. I had the caprese salad and the skinny menu fillet mignon... They were both awesome. Also the manager Tara went above and beyond for us to be happy :) great for dinner and lunch"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery tonight. I remember the good food from a Yelp event here so it was on! Parmesan crusted beef medallions, sweet potato mix, asparagus and bread. Oh my Goodness!!!! This was excellent. 

I will definitely be back and no issues ordering here."}
{"text":"Everybody was super nice, our server Bryan went above and beyond. I'd definitely recommend him to anyone, also our food got to us in less than ten minutes. And the food was phenomenal, great experience overall."}
{"text":"Yum! 

What a fantastic Italian restaurant. The staff is very friendly right as you walk in the door. We visited on a Tuesday night and there was no wait for a table. Bread is quickly brought to the table and is delicious! I had the Sausage Sacchetti and it was phenomenal! Yes, phenomenal!!! We will be returning very soon!"}
{"text":"We live near the mall and are always disappointed with the lack of selections available in this area. We decided to venture out and try this restaurant. We had a brand new server (I only know this because another server told us she was new). She was amazing! So friendly and thorough when it came to ordering and assisting us! Service wise it was one of the best experiences we've had in the valley! The food was quite delicious- I ordered the pick two lunch combo of shrimp and orzo- highly recommended! It was wonderful that they have healthy choices for kids! We ordered our son the Salmon- it comes with vegetables and fruit which is amazing ! We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Pasta fra a diavolo is great and the caprese salad. 
October specials are very generous. BOGO pasta (to go pasta of equal value, included with ordered pasta)"}
{"text":"Beautiful place to eat. My waitress (Katlin), was awesome. The food was light and very tasty and filling!!! Hats off to the staff."}
{"text":"Where's my damn Bravo?  Same great staff, not same level of food. I will hold off on a full review for now as I hope my next visit here is better."}
{"text":"Great service by all the team first one no to many 733restaurants do the teamwork like this Jaradine was our server but we felt welcome by all the staff
We started at the bar the bartender \"U\" I think was his name was cool no objection when we ask if I can transfer the check to the Table we're definitely coming back"}
{"text":"My first time eating a Bravo was a fantastic experience! Our waitress Cassie was the best! She was so bubbly and personable. She also helped us by sharing be some of her favorites with us. I had the Spicy Marinara Scallops and it was AMAZING! The pasta was the most fresh pasta ice ever had in my life, the scallops were plentiful, and the over all flavor was mouth watering. By far the best Italian dish I've ever had in my life! The the wonderful food, great service, and al of the great specials that Bravo has to offer I know without a doubt my husband and I will return many more times in the near future!"}
{"text":"We went here for a quiet night out and it was amazing, as it always is.  We love the atmosphere, the service was amazing and I wish I remembered our servers name because he was awesome!  He was a young, probably mid twenties black man with longer hair!  If you go back and see him, definitely get him,  He gave us a lot of privacy and only came around when he was needed!  The only issue I have with Bravo, and in reality - it's not a big deal but their drinks are not very good for the steep price tag.  Other than that the night was amazing!"}
{"text":"Really love the food here..and service is good.. 

The Hostess Staff is one of my complaints. Why make a reservation.. The hostess do not care that you made a reservation. They do not seat right away or they give the booth you requested away to guests that walk in.. They stand there and talking away and have no care in the world you made a reservation..!This has happened twice.. Mothers Day we know it was busy but when other parties are being seated and you are still waiting 20 minutes for a table you made a reservation a month ago, and the hostess just standing are talking away.. This is one of the reasons I have not returned since that day.. 
I would of not made this complaint, but called a reservation in on a Tuesday 8/9 and Checked in with the hostess asked for a booth.. Said the next booth would be cleaned and ready. Another guest walked in without a reservation and they wanted a booth and the hostess took them to the booth I was waiting for.. I spoke to the hostess and told her what happened Mothers Day.. Oh I am sorry.. and explained that is one of the reasons I have not returned.. Another party was getting up from the booth we will give you that one..!  Oh well.. I am sorry about that.. It was why make a reservation you get seated faster without one..  

I gave my server my Bravo card, never logged my reward card.. This was twice.. Why have a card if the staff doesn't care to log your points.. I noticed it when I dined the next time which was 
8/15 and was seated right away for the first time without a reservation .. Very nice Hostess and in a booth.. 
It was my Son's Birthday.. The server was so very sweet.. The kitchen over seasoned his steak so we had to wait to have the steak redone.. While I sat there with my food.. The manager came over to apologize.. and offered him a salad..We were offered a Birthday dessert.. Twice I have dined no bread was offered.. Had to ask for bread  with dinner never received any for lunch when I dined when I asked the server..It was sad that this had to happen on his Birthday.. I really did not want to come back here to dine here.. But he picked this place for his Birthday.. You have great food & service is good.. I am just not sure I will be back anytime soon.."}
{"text":"We met some friends for dinner here the other night. I thought it was very average. We were seated promptly after arriving and our server came over to the table shortly after. I realize the restaurant has only been open a couple of weeks but she didn't seem to be trained very well. She was not familiar with the happy hour and had to go to the bar and ask. 

The Rosemary bread was good, but very little olive oil was brought out and there was none on the table. We also had to send an order back as it was hard as a rock. I ordered the house pasta, the pasta Bravo and the house salad. The salad was ok, nothing great. It could have used fresh grated cheese. The pasta dish was average as well. The sauce was good, but the pasta itself had no taste, like the pasta water had not been salted.

 For dessert we ordered the warm chocolate cake and it was the best part of the meal. A warm lava cake with vanilla gelato, very rich and gooey :)  I wish the rest of the food had been that good. I may give it one more chance after a few more more weeks but not impressed with the first visit."}
{"text":"We have tried this restaurant twice, both times for dinner.  The atmosphere is nice, but a little noisy.  Service is good.  Food is just OK - maybe a step or two up from Olive Garden.  Everything was actually a little bland.  I wouldn't NOT go back, but there are so many great Italian Restaurants in town, and so many more to try."}
{"text":"I love coming here for lunch. It's hardy enough but not heavy like some Italian food. I love the pizza bravo (I get it without meat ) also if you have a chance go here for brunch (sat-sun until 3pm) and order the French toast sticks. It is the best French toast I've ever had!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to give Bravo more than 1 Star.  We came here on Easter and I thought maybe it may have been just cause it was busy. We ordered pasta bravo, flat bread and a pizza. The pasta was so under seasoned I  had to add salt and pepper. The pizza and flat bread were so salty it was hardly edible. My arugula was not washed thoroughly and I only know this because it was in a to go container and I had to wash it. Being that i live in Henderson I really want to support Bravo. With that being said, I booked a baby shower in June for 25 people and I am hoping that it won't be embarrassing. I know Brio is their sister restaurant and I actually would not mind driving there at this point. Maybe have an inservice day.

***Updated Review **** met with Christy regarding the mix up . Tried another take out order yet again not even a month later. A \"manager\" by the name of Morgan 1) called my daughter a liar regarding a loyalty discount 2) Told me to \"come down in person to look at her computer , I don't have to talk to you call back tomorrow\"
Here's the thing I do not know how this place is still open. The servers have bad attitudes, the food is lukewarm or cold and everyone looks miserable and sounds miserable working there. If you really hate your job don't work there. The negative energy transfers . This situation could have easily been diffused. Instead MORGAN wanted to be the BOSS. Good Luck to this establishment cause I will make sure everyone knows how \"great\" everything is.
I would rather drive the 25 minutes in the other direction to Brio where you know the food will always be great along with the service."}
{"text":"I looove pasta, and since my boyfriend and I are always looking for new Henderson restaurants to try, we decided to give this place a whirl. It was alright, but I don't think I'll be coming back any time soon. 

Service was fast - we were in and out in about 45 minutes, so this restaurant is good if you are in a bit of a hurry but want something better than the food court. I think our waitress may have been coming off a double shift or something, though, because she was \"neutral\" in the friendliness department, and kind of out of it. 

We ordered two of the special, which was supposed to be soup and pasta. $1 extra for lobster bisque. We ordered 1 lobster bisque (special) and 1 Italian wedding soup (special). When the bill arrived, we realized we had been charged for two lobster bisques instead. I pointed this out to the waitress, who then spent a solid 3 minutes arguing with me that the bill was correct. In the meantime, I told her, \"well, it's only a dollar, but I'd hate for it to come out of your tip instead,\" because I wasn't planning on paying that extra dollar (I'm not necessarily cheap, but I don't like to be ripped off). It felt incredibly silly arguing about that one dollar.

AND she forgot my wine until we were almost done with our meals! I would rather have just had it taken off. 

The food was OK, not spectacular, and not terrible, either. There was a really cute fireplace outside though, so maybe when the weather is nice it would be lovely to come for some cocktails and snacks outside."}
{"text":"Great food, excellent service and good portions for the price.  We split a Chicken Ceased salad and couldn't finish it.   Our waitress, Geraldine was attentive and knowledgeable. The manager, Roni shared a lot of info about the banquet room for use in our business lunches. Both are great representatives of Bravo!  

Bravo!"}
{"text":"We were early for dinner and had to wait, standing, for quite sometime for a table.  There were several empty tables which made it confusing.  Our server was busy but took good care of us.  Busboy when asked for bread drip promised to bring it but never did.  Our food was good, but doubt we will go back.  Management seemed to be the problem."}
