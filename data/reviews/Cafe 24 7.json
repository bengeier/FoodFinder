{"text":"Worst place. Worst service. Waited just short of 27 minutes for a salad and appetizer. Told they were too busy and backed up. We walked out. I wouldn't recommend. I was told that even tho their pastries look amazing and huge...they are dry and stale from sitting there for days."}
{"text":"I eat at here. Food was great, but my credit card information was stolen.  I had several charges on my credit card that I did not charge.  Someone had breakfast on my tab. Not cool. Watch using your credit card here. I suggest using cash!"}
{"text":"The service is always pretty lousy. You always have to ask for refills of water, soda, tea and no one is all that friendly... BUT last night was the WORST. We ordered, then waited 30 minutes for our food - when it came out - fajitas - there were no tortillas, condiments or salsa for another 5 minutes! When we got our tortillas, it was a total of 2 in one foil with a promise to bring more - which again, we had to ask for from the manager...   This terrible services went on the whole time while the manager, assistant manager and the rest of the wait staff wandered around aimlessly. Not an un-bussed table in the house - but satisfied, cared for customers? I love their fajitas... but the service (this time) was enough for me to choose to stay away for ever..."}
{"text":"Their \"baked macaroni and cheese\" is nothing more than pasta shells tossed in generic nacho cheese sauce.  Disgusting beyond belief.    You have to be BAKED to eat here---unfortunately I wasn't."}
{"text":"Ate at the casino's coffee shop, Sunday , March 19. 2017, with my wife. Our waitress, an asian lady, was obviously very ill. She was sneezing and coughing all three times she came to our table. She did cover her mouth, but should not have been working around food or people. Secondly, her mastery of the English language is lacking. We could barely understand her due to the fact she did not speak in complete sentences and spoke softly. No thank you, no pleasantries, no personality. Very unpleasant experience. My wife has been sick since Sunday."}
{"text":"Not good!  Waited 25 minutes for dinner. Food came out cold. Our nachos smelled rotten. Manager comped our meal which should have been since we did not eat. Offered us a free pastry but declined...who wouldn't! This place needs a complete change in staff and cooks."}
{"text":"\"Ugh... I'm done!\" I said as I wiped away my tears. I've had enough of a certain friend of mine who had talked shit to me for the last time. My sister, feeling my pain suggested that we go where every saddened Indian Girl goes when feeling bad... the nearest Indian Casino!! WHOO!! Well... okay, maybe not the nearest Indian Casino... but the one across the freeway and down the road... the brand spankin' new Lone Butte Casino.   When we go into the Nuevo riche diner... I was surprised by how shiny it all was! There were deli cases showing off desserts that looked meh and these pedestals that showcased modern Native Art... but it didn't mesh well with the decor of the place. The dining room was big and the tables were very well spaced apart.  We were escorted to our table, sat down and looked over the menu trying to decide the best way to cap off the night. The menu contained all American favorites in all their greasy goodness. Think of the Late Night Denny's menu but sans the moon over my hammy and you'll be dead on. Were told that Alan (or Alec?) was our waiter and would be by soon to take our drink order. So we waited... and waited... and waited... and waited! The last time I waited this long for a friggin' drink order it was because the bar was being danced on by stripper wannabes getting their Coyote SURE Ugly on!!  Yeah, I'll wait for the clear-heeled ones to vacate the bar... sure, why not? But this was NOT the case at Cafe 24/7.   Not wanting to wait around in this crazy color changing world... oh yeah - did I tell you about the colors?! OMG! These damned lights in the ceiling keep changing!! Like from green to yellow to blue to pink to clear and back again!! It's not even a gradual change either!! It's a sudden change and the moment my eyes get used to the new hue, the color changes again! It was distracting and annoying especially when looking at the huge multi-screen TV behind the deli case that for some reason was set to channel 12 and displayed everything in green!   But anyway... I digress... I got up and went to the deli case and told two employees that we have been waiting for a very long time. I learned that the staff is very good at apologizing and the hostess took over our table. We ordered and got our food very fast. Okay now the food...  Our sampler appetizer that came with potato skins, chicken tenders, onion rings and mozzarella sticks were good and light and crunchy and crispy and nothing was over done or soggy. I was happy and surprised. I don't know why, but I always expect casino food to be bad food. The next round was our entrees. I ordered the Angus burger with cheese and bacon and this half pound bad boy had too much bacon on it!! I shared with the sis who was happy to receive it to go on her Turkey Sandwich, more on that in a second. My burger was cooked well and was fresh as was the toppings and bun. I was delighted but I wasn't happy with having to pay extra for French fries, seriously - it should just come with it. At the other Gila River Casinos, fries come with everything. Boo on Café 24/7 on this faux pas. My sister's turkey sandwich was awesome! It was piled high with nice... real... turkey! Lol! Like, someone took a knife to the bird minutes before it hit our table. No pre-packaged water logged sodium filled meat product here!   We ate and I tried to laugh and get my mind off of the night's drama. When we were approached by the Café's manager, he informed us that the café is actually owned by the same company that is associated with Chase Stadium and not the Casino's usual food and beverage department. He also slightly chuckled when I tried to seriously complain about the long wait at the beginning of our meal. *sigh* just like a man huh? Oh well...  To my Yelpers: all in all - if you're on that side of town and it's late... like really late and you're over 21 and the thought of going to Denny's by the freeway seems too disgusting for words... feel free to go to Café 24/7. The food options are the same but it's done so much better. The service might be shit like ours was, but get up and to go the deli, complain and you should be alright. I say go but don't go out of your way to go. Oh and leave your rose-colored glasses at home! Cuz the color changing throughout your meal might make your eyes bleed! I'll give it one more try before I die... but just one."}
{"text":"Food is ok, service needs lots of work.  Forgot the sides, needed to remind them to refill drinks.  Hope they get it fixed.  Deserts were the best"}
{"text":"Service not great.   Slow to take order.  Food took too long to arrive.   The only bright spot here is the 3.99 price for the egg breakfast.    Great value.    Can't beat the price for eggs bacon and hash browns.    Eggs were good.   Bacon OK.   Hash browns greasy and bland, salt helps.   But hey for 3.99 not expecting gourmet.    Left full."}
{"text":"The food may be good but man the service is horrific. I can't comment on the food because I've been here almost an hour and no food. It took about 20 minutes just to get water. No the place isn't packed and swamped as there are empty seats everywhere.  Put the wait in at Ling Lings cause this place is horrible.  One bright spot, Ann the hostess was awesome! The best last if the place was the hostess named Ann!"}
{"text":"Quite disappointing....The sirloin steak was soo hard as if it was frozen then thrown in the grill.   I expected better than that.  Server didn't seem like she cared .."}
{"text":"I really can't understand why people bitch so much about this place...Word of advice, don't go when they're crazy busy!  Great Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner selections!  Generally good service!  The Tiramisu is an excellent dessert choice!  The $3.99 Eggs my way breakfast can't be beat for the price.  Your drink is included, and most people eating in there use comps like myself.  The Wildhorse Pass salad is terrific, as is the Club Sandwich, Hot Roast Beef Sandwich, Fish N Chips, Prime Rib on Friday... This Place is good, way too many naysayers!"}
{"text":"The breakfast buffet was amazing!!! Everything was great. The best I've had in a long time if not ever. Great service as well."}
{"text":"The Veggie Burger and sweet potato fries were not good at all! If you want pickles on your burger, they give you a hard long pickle on the side that's very hard to cut. The onion looked old and didn't taste like onion."}
{"text":"Utterly \"meh\" experience. Six of us stumbled in on a Sunday morning, having stayed the night at the hotel/casino this café is located in, hungover and in serious need of greasy food.   Well this was the place. There was a short wait at 9 a.m., which was spent in the small waiting area by the glass display case of sweets a la Denny's with elderly and bleary-eyed patrons (though their eyes were glazed over due to marathon slot playing, not marathon drinking, I suspect).   When our table was ready, we rounded the corner (it was nice that this created a dining space entirely closed off from the sound and sights of the casino), past the buffet set up (silver chafer sets heated from beneath, nothing special) and to our table in the middle of the room. Giant screens above our heads were projected upon with sports channels.   And the lights ... those colored lights. What the hell. First of all, it's NINE A.M., no need for a club like atmosphere in a place that clearly wants to be some sort of contemporary greasy spoon. And they abruptly change from red to blue to green, no gradual transition. (Then at one point, the already dim regular  lights went off entirely, leaving the restaurant to be lighted only by these creepy lights, ick).  Our server arrived and she was typical casino employee - short, gruff, no nonsense and I'll say it, rude. (When she finally arrived with our drink orders, a friend mentioned we were ready to order, as in \"hey don't run off after you deliver those, we are hungry and you've already taken forever to get waters so let's hurry this along.\" Her actual response: \"you're not doing anything until I set these drinks down.\" Yikes).  The options were typical diner fare: club sandwiches and burgers (available early), omelettes, mozzarella sticks, garden salads, etc. Though you could get a burger at 9a on a Sunday, you could get nothing stronger than an iced tea - they don't serve booze until 10 a here. Between that and the colored lights, they were not being very kind to my hangover.    I got the chicken fried steak (I know, I think I was still drunk) and it was incredibly un-special. (I've never had it before so have nothing to compare to, but wasn't impressed). I wasn't surprised it was bad, steak in a casino diner is a gamble (yeah!) but how did they manage to mess up breakfast potatoes? They were a mix of undercooked and mushy, and flavorless, were probably not made to order but scooped out of that chafer dish I passed on my way in. It was Denny's quality (and barely made that achievement) but with prices that would be about $2-3 more per entrée than them.    I was not a winner here. Not at all."}
{"text":"This place is  either amazing  or super bad. Tonight it was good times.  I was seated right awau and my order taken. Look. .im not going to go on and on. ..i wanted  cheap breakfast and i did get it t"}
{"text":"We ate on Thanksgiving day. Decor was simple and nice. Though we had to wait about a half an hour the restaurant was not packed.  My husbands, the three people at the next table and my food was cold; not lukewarm....cold. The people at the next table thanked my husband for ordering a side of gravy. They said they also did and it was the only thing warm on their plates. My meal was to come with a side of horseradish sauce, it was left off my plate. I asked for it as soon as my plate was served. Five minutes later I was still waiting, we asked again; it took another five minutes to get. Our bill was $51, we gave Francisco $100; he explained he had to break the bill as he did not have that much money. I left to purchase something and returned about 15 minutes later. My husband was still waiting for the  money. We called Francisco over and asked where our money was, he had completely forgotten that he had taken our money."}
{"text":"how can you beat $6.99 steak & eggs? the husband loved them so much he had them two days in a row!! they were cooked perfectly!  i had the chicken strips the first day which were okay. the baked mac and cheese the second day. they were alright, typical diner food.   i liked that the service was quick and that the staff was friendly. also, the fact that they completely separate the casino from the restaurant is great. no smoke or ding-ding-dings from the machines!"}
{"text":"I am giving this place 3 stars because the food was good. But man our server was the worst. I asked for white toast. She brought me sourdough. When i told her i asked for white she said they didnt have white. Their sourdough is their only white toast. Ok i like sourdough. That wasnt my problem but if i aaked for white tell me you dont have white when i ordered to begin with. Also in any restaurant you should never let yiur customers drinks go empty. My coffee was empty for some time. And when i say empty i mean comletely empty for my entire meal. She asked if i wanted a refil when she brough my check.  Again good food but service was horrible."}
{"text":"Good food at a good price, and as the name says, it's open 24/7. Way better prices (and quantity) than the food at our hotel. Loved the 3-egg California omelet with avocado, Boursin cheese and sun-dried tomatoes, with hash browns and toast for just $10. It's inside the casino area, but the restaurant is non-smoking. Lots of giant pastries in the cashier area. Would have given it more stars for better ambiance, but all-in, this place is a bargain. After breakfast, we got free bottled water in the casino. Hotels also provide free bottled water in the rooms and at the desk to-go, and you need it in this dry climate!"}
{"text":"Cafe in Lone Butte. Food good at times I guess it depends on the chef. Great late at nite when u need some breakfast.."}
{"text":"3.5*   We get food comps here often thanks to my FILs regular donations to the slots, the 2* average is truly puzzling to me, the food is good to very good, and we've never had poor service. My only complaint is that they stopped making my favorite salad, the caprese. Being open for the eponymous 24/7 is welcome in AZ, where they generally roll up the streets at 10pm for dining.   Typical diner fare, the dining room is cheerful, and there are some counter seats where you can catch the game if you like. Scott and my Mom dig the burgers, breakfast all day selections, and club sandwiches; I favor their soups, salads, mac & cheese with chicken added, and shrimp cocktail. On Friday nights, they have a Prime Rib full dinner special for $17.99 that Scott and my FIL both enjoy.   The baked goods are gynormous, and some are quite tasty. The cream puffs are the size of a softball, and my family loves them. I've enjoyed the fruit tart, strawberry shortcake, and tiramisu, they are impossible to finish alone, but great for sharing.   If you are staying at the hotel, you can call and order pick up, or order at the counter, and they'll tell you when to pop back in to collect your food.   Granted, we know most of the staff, (Francisco is our favorite waiter) but again, I've never had, nor seen any of the poor service referenced in other reviews. FYI: the Lone Butte Cafe 24/7 is their sister location, but has a slightly different menu."}
{"text":"We have eaten here twice now. The food was pretty good the first time though the second time my burger was overcooked on one half while the other half was rare. Both times the service was terrible, especially the second time. Our server spent most of her time talking to other employees, if we even saw her at all. We had to grab another server and wait for her to find our server to get refills on our drinks and order dessert. Once our server finally arrived at the table, the manager came along with her. The manager didn't seem concerned that we were getting poor service and did not apologize, only making sure our drinks were finally refilled and then walked away. I was left with the impression that we were an inconvenience to them. We never finished the dessert as it was very dry and had no flavor. Finally when we mentioned the poor service when we were paying, there were again no apologies or any concern."}
{"text":"My first impression was alright, i was seated immediately, then the trouble began.  Took my waiter 15 minutes to even acknowledge me, then he skipped over me to an older, richer couple and took their order, waited another 10 minutes before he came to take my drink order, another 15 for my food order. When all was said and done, and i was ready to get a to go box and pay, i waited 35 minutes! i had to get up, stand by the back of house entrance and ASK for a to go container from a server that wasn't even mine! He never offered to take my card until he saw i was pissed and getting up after throwing my food in the carton. I told him don't bother, and left.  I got to the counter, they helped me right away and were very friendly, when i signed the ticket, the girl looked at the tip amount which read.... you guessed it folks..... $0.00!    The toast was buttered too heavily, the ham though was freaking outstanding! Strong coffee which is how i like it, eggs cooked to perfection but the most distasteful part of the breakfast were the potatoes....... hard mush..... that's all i can say.... hard mush  Another lesson learned, one more place to cross off the list folks if you visit wild horse pass.  Cafe 24/7 is so very much not worth the trip downstairs or from anywhere else."}
{"text":"The wait time to get a table is always longer than it should be because the hostess is always MIA...I don't know if she's a part time server or if she's over at the black jack table playing a few hands or what...  With that in mind, the food is VERY GOOD and I have been here at least a dozen times and it always impresses me for a casino coffee shop. My favorite is the Monday Night special of spaghetti and a huge fluffy meatball smothered in delicious sauce (needs some salt though)..Tonight I chose the 24/7 over Olive Garden for spaghetti.  The servers can be kind of slow and not that motivated to move quickly but on a slow night (Mon-Thursday) the food comes out pretty fast.   They have a nice bakery where you can get some desserts to go, as well as some Deli sandwiches or a Coffee/Smoothie...also if you prefer you can sit outside near the fire pit, which I haven't done yet but looks kind of cozy if you want a different atmosphere.  Overall, I am a fan of this coffee shop and will keep returning....,"}
{"text":"Breakfast was omelette (very fresh and tasty) The toast was burnt. Ate dinner there one night & hubbys Philly cheesesteak was the worst he said he'd ever had.  Didn't like the wings. Sent them back for Mac n Cheese. That was huge and tasty."}
{"text":"Alright, lets do some ratings...!  Seating hostess 1 STAR - ignored us while she figured out some answer to a meaningless question she had. Obviously she can only handle 1 thing at a time.   Restaurant 5 STARS - new and clean with a cafeteria feel.   Waiter and his shadowing assistant 5 STARS. Polite, checked on us, informed us and overall provided good service.   Food 3 STARS - we averaged $10 a meal and the portions we not fitting for the cost. Food tasted decent but the bacon was horrid. It was hard and tasted greasy old.   Here's the kicker for me-you have to walk through a heavily overpowering cigarette odored casino to go eat and leave. I gasped for air as I exited the building and luckily kept my breakfast down. - 5 STARS for me"}
{"text":"Came here the last night and the morning before we left back to cali. the ngiht before i ordered the Ceasar salad with shrimp and hot tea.  DINNER TIME  SALAD with SHRIMP: they use the jumbo tiger shrimp for their salads and food. the salad wasa  bit bland cz they barely threw in any of the dressing. i had to ask for extra cheese on the side :..[ i love cheese!!!  The tea: the tea was pretty good. they brought out honey for me ^_^ cz they love me lol  MORNING TIME  STEAK and EGGS with FRUIT: the steak was about 6oz. it was kinda dry at medium rare. wasnt seasoned. i ordered egg whites and they really packed it on my plate LOL no complaints on that LOL. Seasonal fruit woudl be melon, canteloupe, pineapple and grapes  Coffee: it gave me a head ache. it was too bitter no matter how much creamer/half n half and sugar i put in  Orange juice: tasted like Minute maid orange juice =/ i can tell between fresh, minute maid or simply orange -_- im a big orange juice fan"}
{"text":"Waitress was polite and friendly,  facility was clean,  other than the awful stench of casino perfume.    huevos rancheros was a decent tasting meal,   overall we had a tolerable meal but it's hard to enjoy anything in the foul cloud of stinky air in Lone Butte"}
{"text":"WOW!!  Best food ever!  Amazing!  Beautiful peaceful patio with lovely waterfall in the middle of it, great service.  I am visiting from Seattle and who would think the cod fish and chips would impress a gal from the seafood kingdom in the Pacific Northwest!  Highly recommend it to visitors AND locals!!"}
{"text":"I've ate this place only once before until just now .   It's located inside the Wild Horse Pass Casino   cafe 24/7 the food is really good actually for a casino restaurant it's good.   I've ate other casino restaurants before they're OK nothing to brag much about .    Cafe 24 / 7 has something good going for a casino restaurant, however there is a flaw in they're system..   The service slow , it wasn't busy inside at all. I ate it once before and again , it was slow I waited 20minutes for the food after I placed the order .   Other than that, it's good. I'll come back and try again."}
{"text":"Affordable food. I am staying at the Sheraton which for food options is way too expensive. The wait staff is friendly and the prices are super cheap. I had the French toast with bacon and ham and my mom had the blue corn pancakes and both were good sized and tasty. You can barely hear the casino noise in the cafe. And since I ordered too much extra meat I decide to take it back for lunch with a good sized side salad for $2. Breakfast and lunch for $13!"}
{"text":"When my friends said do we really want to eat here we should have left.  There is nothing else close to the casino during the day so you are kind of trapped.  The smell of cigarettes is very strong in the restaurant.  Just walking into the restaurant the staff are very unfriendly and make no effort to greet, they just don't care, that permeates every member of staff in the restaurant.  We sat and waited and after about 10 minutes the surliest of waitressed came to take our order.  Her attitude may have actually got worse with time.  And by the way - how hard is it to bring ice-tea, with a straw and lemon?  Who knew they would have to personalize the experience for each of us at the table times three (once for the drink, again for a straw and then again for lemon) FOR THREE OF US, that's nine visits.  I had a salad that was instantly forgettable, the other dishes were equally bad.  I'd starve before eating here again"}
{"text":"Ordered, never got our pepsis after 20 minutes until another server took pity on us.  In the end, our waiter never came back after taking our order. We walked out after wasting 45 minutes."}
{"text":"Just get the 5lb burger.  They cook it pretty damn good for a 5lbr (ask for it med rare!)"}
{"text":"It's all about expectations. I don't understand people that give this place 2 stars because \"it's just like Denny's.\"  Well yes it is, I wasn't expecting French Gourmet.  I like the cosy atmosphere inside a loud and noisy casino. The servers are friendly, but most of the times they are busy. The food is diner standard, and not bad at all. I've tried the Mac & Cheese which is delicious, I like the crusty oven baked tops. I've had the open face roast beef which was good, and so are the burgers and fries. The average price of a meal is between 10 to 15 bucks. I think it's a good value for what you get."}
{"text":"Kind of between a 2 and 3 we ordered the prime rib special. Nothing special about it. One went back as it was overcooked. Mine was tough. The only good thing really was the dessert. They are huge!  Service was fast and that was why we went there. The other restaurants at the casino had at least an hour wait. Drinks not refilled and it really wasn't that busy. No dinner in the future if I go back. Just breakfast."}
{"text":"The absolute worst dining experience food wise. However gave it one start for the gut renching laughter we experienced, the server we had, and the manager for comping the bill. We had the French dip, the meat looked like leather. There was a twist tie in our burger, my chicken was grey, and the ribs looked fake. Everything at the table was returned and even the chef agreed that he should have never served it to us. I feel bad for the staff, because again they were very friendly and super nice- but in wouldn't consume anything from that kitchen if it were my last meal on earth."}
{"text":"Food was ok.  Went with a group of people and each meal ordered was considered \"ok\".  One complaint I will share is that we asked to replace fries with onion rings on one of the burger plates.  We were told that it would cost .99 cents extra, which was fine (usually there is a cost to \"upgrade\" to onion rings).  So was very surprised with the burger came with four (4)...yes, four small onion rings.  Stick with fries next time!    The huge eclair caught our eye when we went by the bakery case and we were excited to splurge with one.  Skip it, folks.  It was very dry and the filling was skimpy (actually it was thicker in the dead center of this huge eclair but overall, the experience was not worth the cost.    Most likely won't be back to this cafe.  We actually chose to eat here because we attended a concert at the casino."}
{"text":"This place is truly terrible, spent an hour waiting for my food, saw my server once. Food was brought to the wrong tables twice, baked potato tasted terrible. I would have paid to not eat there. Ruined my overall mood for the night, prime rib almost made me hurl.  Avoid this place, I would give anywhere else in the casino a try, it couldn't possibly be worse."}
{"text":"We went here a couple times while at the hotel for the weekend. We went for breakfast which is served all day which is great. They had a buffet that day so we tried that... came with a drink each and had some tasty things on it. Biscuit and gravy, bacon, sausage, waffles and french toast(both the waffles and french toast were stale). It was an average meal you'd expect. Our server however was not average. She was awesome!! She brought out drinks and water for everyone and never once was our glass low on drinks. She went above and beyond. I think it was a good option for a quick meal at the casino. We ordered some late night fries and onions rings here too when everything else was closed. Onion rings were very good and we got lots of ranch with them... Nice!! I wouldn't drive to eat here but it's a nice place to have at the casino for a quick bite."}
{"text":"We eat here all the time service is pretty good and the food is always good I sent back 1 time just because of bein cold no big deal and the price is the best with all the comps we get for playing...lol"}
{"text":"After a night of gambling and drinking at Lone Butte Casino, this place hits the spot fo late night munchies.  It's your typical 24 hr casino coffee shop.

{"text":"Sat outside near the fire place. Food came out fast this time around. I order the steak & eggs, everything I was cooked perfectly. Will be back for 2nds!"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and don't bother. The waitresses are horrible and they were more content on cancelling my order, then receiving a tip from a satisfied customer. Based on the manager's demeanor it's understandable why poor service is acceptable; she offered no resolution. Oh, and had I not asked for the check so I could leave, I would've been there all night waiting for it."}
{"text":"Slow service, wait staff who clearly don't want to be there, food was disgusting. Would strongly suggest against going here."}
{"text":"No windows, so it's kind of dreary inside. Fancy lighting on the walls that changes color. I had a breakfast skillet that was mostly potatoes, the sausage was cheap skinny link sausage that had been sliced into discs, and flavor was lacking somewhere. I needed to add salt and ketchup, and I don't even like ketchup on my breakfast foods. Too many potatoes. And the price for a dish was about a dollar or two more than it should be."}
{"text":"Look, it's a 24/7 Native American Casino resturaunt, what do you want? Borden Ramsey? Yeah it's kinda slow but I would say it's a bit better than Denny's and a lot closer. A decent menu, decent food. Look, you're here to gamble and have fun, it's not fine dining give them a break."}
{"text":"The cafe is inside the Lone Butte Casino. It was nice, clean with a bright atmosphere. Waited the usual 2-3 mins to look over the menu before our waitress greeted us for drinks. I asked for flavored ice tea but was told they don't do flavored ice tea. Water with lemon was fine. My partner had hot tea. We placed our orders n it took about 17 mins for it to be brought. It was hot n fresh. Food was delicious n tasty.  My concern was with the wait time for some of the other patrons. A family of 3 were seated next to us and no one greeted them for 10 mins. They kept looking around for their waiter but they had waited enough n walked out.  The restaurant needs more teamwork as communication is lacking. Another customer was seated at a dirty table n the mngr scolded the hostess for it in front of everyone. All the servers were not happy and we were not even asked if we were happy with our food. We did not get a refill on drinks till we finished eating.  3 stars for the good food. Service is lackluster."}
{"text":"Never order the Cedar Plank Salmon. I rather open up a can of tuna. The fish was hard, dry and shouldn't even been served to a customer let alone charged $13 for the dish."}
{"text":"So I ordered the Nathan sliders as an appetizer. The menu specifically states that you get 6 mini hotdogs with your choice of topping. It lists cheese, relish, mustard and a few other things. I asked our server if it was nacho cheese or shredded cheese. She said either or. As I go to pay the tab says $1.99 for cheese added to our hotdogs. I explain to the check out lady that it was a mistake the menu says includes. She then has to go speak to her manager. She comes back and tells me she cannot remove it, it included a shredded cheese not a nacho cheese. Not only does the menu not state what type of cheese but the server didn't even specify. Most would just roll over because it's only $2 but I was in a feisty mood so I continued to argue. Finally a manager comes over and TELLS me not explains to me why it's an up charge. I TELL her back that it is crap they should be specific and our server said it was fine. 10 minutes later she took the sliders off all together. I wasn't asking for that just the $2 so that is why they get a 1 star. After all that I go to pay and she asks me how everything was....... \"Actually it wasn't even that good\" was my answer. So more importantly don't eat here because the food is basically terrible."}
{"text":"Cafe 24/7 has one of the best Fish & Chips I've ever had! It's the reason they get 5 stars instead of 4... it's that good. The fish is flaky and tasty! I believe it's Cod as well which is always good.  The wait staff and servers are always friendly and prompt. The dining area is nice and clean and you rarely, if ever, have to wait for a table.  Definitely worth a visit if you're in the area or love good Fish & Chips!"}
{"text":"I read the reviews from other reviewers and I agree with most that indicated service is lousy.  It's a wonder something hasn't been done to eliminate the poor service.  It was almost as bad as it can get when we visited the Lone Butte Casino.  The hostess was pleasant and seated us fairly quickly.  Then, the wait began.  It was a mighty long time before our server even arrived at our table.  Eventually, Valerie showed up and took our order.  We'd been there so long there was no reason to give a drink order before our lunch.   Cafe was pretty much empty but when other patrons arrived we noticed Valerie delivered their drinks before we even had ours.  Finally I got up and walked over to her and asked her if she wouldn't mind bringing us the drinks we had ordered.  In a slow fashion we eventually received those.  Another lady sitting at the table next to us, received pretty much the same service we did ... poor.  Our lunch ordered didn't require anything that needed a long time to fix.  What's to do on a soup and tuna salad?  We were just about ready to walk out when she finally delivered our order.    The soup was absolutely excellent.  Bread was a tad stale but still good.  However, when the service is this bad, it ruins the whole meal.  Why hasn't the management done something about their poor service reviews?  Obviously, there was no tip."}
{"text":"We were seated and 15 minutes later not a single person came to bring us water, take our order, anything - so we left. I can't really comment on anything other than the service but I would give it zero stars if I could."}
{"text":"Dang it! Why didn't I check Yelp before coming here!?I hate when I do that.  Don't go here, you'll hate it. It took thirty minutes to get our food which wasn't even worth the wait.  It was very bland and greasy. Plus we weren't the only ones. There was a manager at one table dealing with food issues, another table where the guy told a server that if his sever doesn't get them the bill they're walking out, another table that had stopped eating and started looking around anxiously and then there was us, 25 minutes and counting to receive a burger and a sandwich. Nope wouldn't go back. Bland, greasy, overpriced food with seriously ridiculous wait times."}
{"text":"Breakfast for lunch at the Wild Horse Pass casino diner sounded good, but ended up being a mix of good and bad.  The diner itself can be a little hard to find, being situated adjacent to the gaming next to the poker room.  The atmosphere is pretty cheery, with a huge pastry case greeting you as you walk in with nummy looking contents.  Our waitress was great - fast, solicitous and accurate.  It's the food that will keep me from coming back, though.  I opted for the breakfast skillet that ended up being some undercooked, greasy potatoes and veggies placed into a skillet-shaped pyrex dish.  Chef - where's the caramelization?!  Not to mention, where's the skillet?  My lunch partner got the monte cristo sandwich that turned out to be some lunchmeat between two pieces of french toast - literally.  I held back laughing at his sandwich since he did have to eat it and all, but it was pretty pitiful looking.  Those two items and one soda (one water) added up to $22.  Seemed expensive for what we got.  Can't recommend the place, but also haven't found a good alternative at that casino either."}
{"text":"The cheese sauce on Nachos and Macaroni & Cheese used to be amazing 5 cheese blend.....the price of Macaroni & Cheese went up $2.00 but they changed recipe! Used to be large shell pasta with the amazing cheese sauce. Now it is horrible; regular elbow macaroni & what does not taste as good as Velveeta cheese. PLEASE GO BACK TO OLD RECIPE MACARONI & CHEESE!! I WILL CHANGE RATING TO 5 STARS....PLEASE!"}
{"text":"Four Casino Cafe that's open 24/7 this place has all the things you could desire at any hour of the day. They have an egg special $5 eggs anywhere you like it you two eggs meat potatoes and toast for 5 skates can't beat that I had the black and blue chicken sandwich on a brioche bun it was delicious the onion rings were not so delicious cuz it was a beer batter and are really greasy but the sandwich kick butt"}
{"text":"Ordered from room picked up in 15 mins, food is a step above Denny's. I had the steak & eggs for $10, not a Shula steak but okay for the price. If your looking for a quick bite nothing fancy open 247 this is the place."}
{"text":"Great, fresh food! I had the chicken fried steak with mashed potatoes, and a steamed vegetable medley. Reasonably priced and the portions are huge so you definitely get more than you pay for. There is also a breakfast buffet only that is offered for $13.00. On this menu comes eggs, potatoes, waffles, biscuits n gravy, sausage. I will try this out next time. The atmosphere is modern and very comfortable. Staff are very attentive, professional and friendly. I gave this place 4 stars because I think if they offered a lunch buffet as well, it would be a better place, but still not complaining. Food is fresh, delicious, tasty and very filling! I recommend you check this place out if ever here at this casino. I live in Tempe so it's a hop, skip and jump away from where I am at, and will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Well the service can be a challenge from time to time, but for the most part the food has always been on point.  I usually stick to what I like, so for me it's the 8-12 wings with carrots and celery and the wife gets the fish platter.  I really love the tv's everywhere and the display of any drawings that are going on in the casino."}
{"text":"It's not all about gambling for me but when I get out for a bit and want some good wings this is the place I go . Combined with free play and the food voucher that I get its a great place to get out. The food is good the service can be iffy at times but I'm never in a hurry"}
{"text":"Visited on 6 march, 2016 while parked in a Motorhome in the RV parking area. We had spent the night and enjoyed the gambling/casino. Then came breakfast:  * Service was slow * Finally got water toward the end of the meal * No silverware when meal was served. Took several minutes to get. * Coffee was never refilled. * Had to ask for a check. * Got double billed on my AMEX card. Still waiting, after 2  1/2 weeks for a resolution following several calls to customer service rep (Terra L.) who has assured me \"It is coming\". The 1st response was: \"A computer glitch.\" The 2nd was: \"It was processed on the 15th of March.\" Still waiting.  On a positive side-The food was good."}
{"text":"10-15mins for the server to acknowledge us, once he got to us we figure we should order right away since we don't know how long it would take for us get our food and drinks, 3mins for drinks and 10mins for food to come. The food was good and server nice but overall I gave it 3 stars because it took so long for the server to even acknowledge us."}
{"text":"The food here is disgusting. I ordered the French dip sandwich and received what may have been boiled pork on a bun. I couldn't tell what the meat was, by taste, to be honest. And it didn't smell appetizing either. I took one bite and spit it out. My waiter offered to get me something else. I ordered a cheeseburger because I figured \"you can't mess those up!\" Wrong. I have no idea what that meat was, either. Whatever it was, it wasn't cooked properly. I ordered cheese fries as the side to my dish, and the cheese atop the fries was burnt to a crisp. Yuck. The most appetizing thing that my husband and I ordered was the spinach and artichoke dip. It was actually pretty good! But my suggestion would be to slice up those artichoke hearts into more user friendly, bite-size pieces."}
{"text":"We had breakfast here and it was the best breakfast best service best best best!    Definitely make sure to find yourself there if your at wild horse pass casino and hotel."}
{"text":"Went here with a few friends after church. Two of them are regulars here, and me and the other were there for the first time. The two regulars ordered the chicken fried steak breakfast and a chef salad. I had the fish, sweet potato fries, and potato salad. And the other had the chicken strips. All of the plates were served like HUGE servings.... the food was pretty good..... and the cheesecake slice was like a quarter of a cheesecake! Service was kind of slow, but overall it was a decent visit."}
{"text":"Not the worst but definitely not the best. Ok if you're very hungry and in a hurry. Had the NY strip and it was ok, nothing spectacular. Wife got the prime rib which again was just ok. But i guess you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"I love the out-door seating here. Beautiful!! You can almost forget that you are in a casino!   My husband and I brought his Grandma and Mon here for a little fun!! After we were seated, our drinks came fast, and we were told about the $4 breakfast special. MMMmmmm....Sounds good!! AND cheap!!   It took a really long time for our food to come out, and there were maybe six tables in the place being used. So, the $4 food. You get what you pay for. Extremely runny eggs, dry biscuits, and bacon that looked like it had been in the warming pan all morning. Because we were hungry, we did manage to choke it down. BLAH....If you visit this casino, try the food court. We will next time!!"}
