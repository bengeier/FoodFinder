{"text":"Pros: Philly cheesesteak,fries
Cons: No private seats, no Wi-Fi

On Monday around 1:00PM, the food court was crowded, but the line to the restaurant was not big. We did not take so much time to ask for our lunch. The restaurant seems clean and not messy.
One big point for this restaurant was that we did not need to wait so much for our food to be ready. Something that happens a lot of times with the so called \"fast-food\" restaurants. Because the court was crowded, it was hard to find a seat for us. We needed to spend some time to find a seat. This time I ordered the Philly cheesesteak and fries.
Overall, the experience was nothing special. Not bad neither fantastic. Just the good feeling when you leave a \"fast-food\" restaurant that knows what they are doing. The fries were not greasy and the sub was tasteful. The next time that I go back to Canada if I want to have a quick and good food for sure I'll eat here again!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches and French fries

Love their loaded fries"}
{"text":"Mediocre cheesesteaks.  Nothing much else to say.  Bleh.  I've had better cheesesteaks at airports around the country.  I'm sure people only eat here because of the location."}
{"text":"Located in the main food court in the middle of the terminals, this small eatery was open early at 4:30 to serve breakfast.  Hardly any line so I figured to try it out.   Unhappy employees,  visibly so.  I tried cheering them up and they just grunted,  so if you need ambiance or a smile,  try somewhere else.  

The food though?  Within 3 minutes I had my scrambled eggs, home fries, sausage, and toast.  Topping it off was a bottle of orange juice all for $10 and change.  Just like a food truck outside of a college,  it was quick and tasty,  with little fanfare. 

I will come back simply because as a frequent traveler this location gives me what I need,  something different,  quick,  and relatively tasty food."}
{"text":"The food is good but the service is terrible with a capital T.  Now they are supposed to open at 7 am.  I got there at about 7:10am and the guy working said they weren't open yet because 2 other workers didn't show up.   I decided to wait and was able to order my food.  Still when a place of business opens at 7 am they need to do so everyday.  And for the workers that didn't show up, Fire them both!  This is fast food!  People eat at fast food restaurants because they get their food fast.  Anyway if you want breakfast but want to be on time for work in the morning skip Charlies and try McDonald's.  They are always open on time."}
{"text":"i love the free samples they do. Small portions when it comes to fully loaded fries. The sandwiches can be kind of dry at times. Oh yea I don't think they store the Mayo properly."}
{"text":"I usually go to the Charlies at the Beaver Valley Mall, but yesterday I was out at Robinson Mall and decided to use my stamped Charlies \"buy 7, get 8th free small sub card\" I had been saving. When I ordered and handed the cashier (and manager apparently) \"Angel V\" my card, he asked where I got it from. I said the Beaver Mall, why? He said I could not use it, and could not have it back! He said the numbers stamped on the card were different than his stores numbers. because it's a different location (different stamp) obviously! So I couldn't use it which makes no sense. I still don't understand. I argued it was my property and to give it back so I could use it at the Beaver Mall then and get my free sub. He refused to give me it, tried ignoring me, then embarrassing me in front of other customers and then said he was calling security. I did nothing wrong. I was outraged! I told him I'd call his boss, and I have, but no answer back. It is not right how he treated me, and I will happily never go there again! Worst Charley's ever."}
{"text":"Oneida was very rude. She didn't want to do her job. She talked to the customers like we were dumb. I get that you are in a location where the mall is dying but should that make you more eager to get customers. Not treat them like they are worthless"}
{"text":"The people here don't speak English fluently, and I had a very difficult time ordering a plain cheesesteak with cheddar sauce.  Ultimately, it came out with the wrong cheese.  With some effort, I managed to get it corrected.  -1 star.

A \"large\" cheesesteak, fries, and a drink cost me a little over $13... Pretty steep for a meal in the mall food court, but the portion size is my primary complaint.  For that price, you'd expect a plentiful helping of steak... In truth, the total amount of steak was about equivalent to a regular hotdog - no joke.  I would have been embarrassed to even serve that as a sandwich - much less a $13 dollar sandwich. -2 stars for measly portions  at premium prices.

I wish I would have went to the Chick-fil-a next door.  I won't be eating here again."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever! Had to buy 2 subs because they messed up the first one I ordered and then when I ordered the second one the cashier put in the wrong sub and when I got to the end of the line the man putting lettuce etc...on subs told me I would have to buy another one because my receipt was wrong...need to hire some employees who speak and understand English and not blame customer for their mistakes!!!! I will never eat at this establishment again if I could give a zero I would...by the time I finally got the correct sub I was so upset by their ill treatment that I couldn't even eat it!"}
{"text":"Awful service. Workers could barely speak English and I had to repeat my order at least 5 times until they understood me and it took two people to take my order. It cost me $18 for two small sandwich combos. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"GM of the store is there today. He is extremely outgoing and helpful. Food was delicious. And about the same price as subway but way better quality meals. My new favorite place for a quick sandwich."}
{"text":"I've been here twice.  The first time (several weeks ago) my friend noticed a hair in my sandwich as I opened up the paper to take that first bite.  I remember the replacement sandwich was good though -- the bread was nice and warm.  My friend and I got fries all dressed up in bacon and cheese and all that jazz and it was quite satisfying.

The second time was today.  I waited for several minutes for the sandwich, then I was told I would have to \"wait a minute\" for fries.  I was asked again if I wanted cheese or bacon and cheese, etc.  I wanted cheese, and had to state this to three different people.  It was weird -- there seemed to be a disconnect between the guy taking orders and the people making the food.  I waited for several minutes.  I finally get my food.  I high tail it out of there because I had been waiting so flippin long and was hungry!  I drive home, open up the bag, then the paper wrapping up the sandwich and fries individually... and... no cheese.  After all that!  There was almost no lettuce and zero tomato on the sandwich... just some meat (which wasn't all that great), ranch sauce and that's pretty much it.  It was underwhelming to say the least.  The fries were okay.  The bread was probably the best part.  My dog enjoyed a lot of the meal.

The one redeeming quality of this place is that the strawberry lemonade was delicious.  It was huge (didn't fit in my cup holder, unfortunately)... but they actually put strawberries in it.  Very refreshing.  The strawberry lemonade alone upped the review from one star to two!

I won't be back for the food, but might get the strawberry lemonade again."}
{"text":"So I just got done ordering a 10 dollar sub from this place and I was over at Mcdonald's in the food court because they forgot something in my order over there... I came back to Charley's to get some napkins and ketchup and some worker pops out of nowhere to tell me I need to pay him 1 DOLLAR PER NAPKIN... 
yes he said \"GIVE ME 1 DOLLAR FOR EACH NAPKIN..\" 
I told him that I already ordered a sub and he still insisted \"ONE DOLLAR FOR EACH NAPKIN, GIVE ME!!\"  
The way he was so greedy for a customer taking a few napkins I assume he is the owner? I don't know who he is but he was so rude and inconsiderate to a paying customer, I am beyond offended and will never patronize this location ever again. The 10 dollars I had just forked over a sub sandwich was not worth that horrible treatment.  Next time I want a sub I am going to subway or the pizza place, Charley's is absolute garbage and that MIDDLE AGED MIDDLE EASTERN GUY needs some lessons in manners."}
{"text":"Stopped off here mid shopping! This actually has a different name as you'll see on the drinks pic I upload! This is located in the food court to the left hand side in Square One shopping centre in Mississauga! 
It's pretty good as foodcourt food goes! Mine was a little dry (asked for mayo but she barely filled it on one side) and I got the veggie steak (no steak)
Would come back here! 
Service isn't great, there is a big language barrier; but my only real issue was the fact you're ignored and zero eye contact while they're cooking. even when I asked about ketchup they just threw their arm in one direction and looked away again! Anyway at least I can see the food being made so I'll be back  cause to be fair, was very yummy!"}
{"text":"I remember when Charley's Grilled Subs first opened on State, back during my earlier college years.  I remember that when it first opened I was extremely  happy, because for whatever reason I was in a major Philly cheesesteak phase.  It was something I'd always order at restaurants and even make special trips to the West Towne Mall food court to hit up the Steak Escape.  I've never even been to Philadelphia and I probably wouldn't know a good cheesesteak from a bad one.  It didn't really matter - that is what I yearned for, and my wishes were answered when Charley's opened.

Back then I went all the time, usually getting the regular Philly with fries but basically trying everything on the menu.  I probably came here at least once a week in between classes or after a session at Memorial Library.  I'd have to say it was my favorite restaurant in Madison at the time.

Fast forward five years and I'm living in Middleton.  I haven't been to Charley's since college, but my friends and I need to grab a quick bite before the UW Hockey game.  I've been basically out of town for the better part of a month and I get the sudden urge to see if Charley's is as good as I remember.  Short answer: yes!  The Italian Deli sandwich was delicious.  I skipped the fries as I never was a huge fan and went with a large sandwich.  Long answer: not quite so much...  It turns out I'm not used to eating this type of food anymore, and the heartburn became intense around the second period.  I shared this discomfort with my friend, and we both spent the remainder of the night saying \"Oh, there goes the Charley's again.\""}
{"text":"Man, I really like Charleys. I know it is in the mall, but the location outside of the mall was where I used to go in a couple times a month. Sometimes, I think about going to PV Mall and planning it around lunch. The fries are crispy, hot and fresh! I ask them to mix me up 1/2 ranch 1/2 BBQ sauce. Stir it up real well and dip the fries in it. Whoo baby, that is GOOD stuff."}
{"text":"The customer service was some of the worst that I have ever experienced. The cashier was extremely rude and refused to answer any of my questions about the menu. She clearly hated her job and proved to me that she doesn't deserve it. The food was mediocre and there are much better options in the airport for the same price."}
{"text":"I wanted this to be a good place to eat, but it wasn't.  I had the straight Philly Steak sub and it was really tasteless!

No flavor to the meat or the cheese .. c'mon, really?!

Not coming back to this or any Charley's."}
{"text":"They do not accept coupons.  They 'ration' ketchup by handing out two packets with fries.  It feels like an assembly line."}
{"text":"Advertisement on the menu boards were definitely deceiving...
My food (turkey melt wrap with lettuce) was sloppily made and taste was very bland.. They advertise their fries to be done three ways (cheese, cheese and bacon, and ultimate = cheese, bacon, sour cream), which made it look amazing -- but they were very stingy with their cheese and if you want more, of course it's extra.
I also saw another customer with the ultimate style but it was drenched in sour cream... YUCK!

Customer service sucks as well..
The girl who seemed to have more experience and obviously has been there for a while was only bosing around the new guy who was at the register taking the orders.
New guy sucks.. had no sense of urgency to anything.. or didn't know the words \"I'll be with you in just a second\" or \"sorry for the delay\"..

All I wanted was a side of ranch and it took 5 minutes to get his attention and another 5 just to get it and another 3 to cap it with the lid and hand it to me..

I should've gone to Taco Bell next door... #lessonlearned"}
{"text":"I have an unpleasant experience yesterday 12/23/14  with an immature girl cashier at Ontario Mills Mall in Ca. There's two cashiers one girl and a guy. They're both helping customers, the girl was already done helping her customer. I was next in line as I was waiting for her to call me but NO she was pretending to do something around the counter and I was still standing waiting for her to call me, then when the guy cashier was finished helping the other customer he was the one to call me. After he called me, that immature girl called the next customer behind me. That's BS she shouldn't be picky on which customer she's going to help, she made me wait till the guy cashier to call me. I was very upset . She shouldn't be a cashier to begin with. I was really upset, I told the guy cashier what she did and he apologized and that the girl knows I was upset. The guy said she's just busy doing other stuff. Doing Other Stuff? Isn't she supposed to be cashiering first before she does other Stuff. I'm not ever gonna go to this place ever again."}
{"text":"The General Manager Rigo was very friendly and extremely courteous to me, he was extremely professional in the sale of a Regular Philly Cheese steak and Bacon and Cheese Fries. The food is exquisite and it also has an exceptional presentation, I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Had my first Charley's meal. Went with the Philly Steak grilled sub with the mushrooms, onion and bell pepper. Never saw the mushrooms I ordered and paid extra for! Even though I asked the cook if he had added them. Also had the bacon cheese fries. I've had much better cheese fries.So I'm a little disappointed. But the place was alright over all.
They have a great menu so I'm going to say A-ok for now. 'll try them again at some point since I got a punch card and its near where I often shop and my friends kids like the place."}
{"text":"I really do love this place.
When I was in school at least, they had decently cheap deals on Tuesdays, a large cheesesteak and fries for like $6, normally $9. At one point I scheduled myself around when I would go here on Tuesdays.
One day I was passing through the MSP airport and saw it in the foodcourt for the briefest of moments but couldn't stay (and it was 6am), deeply disappointed.
Always go back when I go to Madison, really good for a basic chain!"}
{"text":"Tasty philly sandwich for airport fast food, prepared to order. They had interesting tasting peach lemonade, I had never heard of it before, but it was refreshing. Good, friendly service too."}
{"text":"I stopped here walking out of the mall and I very rarely eat at the \"food court\"
I think the staff here did a great job today from start to finish.  I like that all of the subs are freshly made to order on a grill as opposed to the microwave/toaster oven at the big name joint next door. Fries were also made at ordering and were hot.
The regular size sub was more than enough and the meal was a little more expensive but a lot better tasting."}
{"text":"\"1 regular cheesteak please.\"

Strike one, but for me, or the restaurant? 

I'm at the  Pittsburgh international airport, getting lunch before my flight.

McDonald's? No. Sbarro? Nah. Quiznos.. meh. What's this, a cheesesteak joint in Pittsburgh?

Anyone who loves steaks knows you don't order it like this. But this place has 3 sizes. And seemingly provolone and onions are defaults...

\"Onions?\"

\"please.\"

Pay the guy, wait for my order. I see a girl putting a roll through a toaster.... Hope that's not mine.

\"lettuce, tomato, mayo?\"

Pause... \"no thank you\" Strike two, c'mon!!

Steak was kinda dry/overcooked. Cheese was nice but, hard to mess that up. Can't expect an amazing steak at the airport, so they get 2 stars. 3 stars cause its in Pittsburgh, and at the airport, and a better option than anything else, tho the burrito place next door looks interesting.

Roll was toasted. Strike three. Minus 1 star"}
{"text":"Get some people who speak English PLEASE! They gave me buffalo sauce instead of barbeque, didn't give me anything I asked for on my sandwich and gave me a strawberry lemonade when I clearly asked for blueberry. I have no problem with immigrants but y'all gotta speak English if your going to work in America!"}
{"text":"I ordered the cheesecake and asked for provolone cheese. The guy taking his time ringing me up told the lady. Waiting on food she decided to put the cheese of her choice on my sandwich. I simply reminded her to use provolone cheese. She stated \" read the menu we do not change anything\"  but she did change the cheese after I had to tell her it was ordered with provolone cheese and she was told before. Very rude and disrespectful. First time there and the last. 
Food is okay but not for what they change."}
{"text":"Decent enough food, prepared pretty quickly, but at $23.07 for 2 medium subs +sodas & fries, it's very very overpriced.  
 
 *Many*  other places nearby to get more value for your money."}
{"text":"For mall food court food lunch wasn't bad. 

My son and I grabbed a quick lunch after shopping after being tempted by a sample they offered us. He had the California chicken sandwich and I had the chicken teriyaki sandwich. We also got an order of loaded fries and a lemonade. The sandwiches were hot and tasty, although the meat was a bit on the salty side and there was more on side of the sandwich than the other. The last two inches of one half was nothing but bread. The fries were crisp and loaded with ranch, cheese, and bacon bits. The lemonade was good and they even give you one free refill. 

Two sandwiches, an order of fries and one large drink was approximately $19.00."}
{"text":"I go to charleys often its not busy so i am not sure why my order got messed up. Simple add mushrooms, onions and green peppers. When i went back i told the she asked if it was grilled in i said no and got handed a cup of onions. I'll be going to subway from now on!"}
{"text":"The menu here is a bunch of creative sandwiches, all done up on a flat-top, Philly style. They use fresh ingredients and the bread is really tasty. 
I don't eat fries much, but theirs are not too greasy.

The place is always filthy, so I'll take them down a star."}
{"text":"NOT ACCEPTING ENJOY COUPONS ANYMORE!!!!  what is that about?  you can't change your mind mid-year after i bought the book.  those effin SOBs."}
{"text":"I don't know why, but I love this place.  It's slightly greasy, unhealthy but cooked in front of your eyes.  

When I come here, I have the Philly Cheese Steak with fries.  The cheese melts on top of the meat and the bun is so crispy.  The fries are nice and fat.  This is a great place to come before you shop and then you can work off all the excess calories trying to find your way around Square One."}
{"text":"I love that this place its right across the street from my job. The employees know my order and make it in a timely manner.  this place."}
{"text":"Only one person taking orders n making the food n serving food. Waited for 20 min to get my sub.  The chicken California to be exact. Was made w all chicken n minimal ranch....I paid almost $9 for this sub n fries w no ranch. I asked for ranch n was charged another 54 cents. The fries were not good either. I hope they close this place soon as they rip u off n the food is waaaaay overpriced."}
{"text":"My girlfriend order the chicken philly and the picture showed this big sand which but what we got look nothing like the picture. When I ask for more chicken they told me that's their quantity and can't put more chicken. The philly steak was good but you must ask to put bbq sauce or they won't put it in the San which even though the picture shows it with bbq sauce. Like I said before failed advertising on the chicken sandwich but here's a actual picture so you know I'm not making this up"}
{"text":"Decent enough subs here but yikes--the calorie count folks!  Nothin' much under 500 calories here!  And if you're ordering fries with your lunch--forget about it!  The ultimate fries come in at 598 calories and the large fries weigh in at over 600!  

Thanks Charley for putting the nutrional info on your website!

So how are the subs here?  Pretty good and definitely a cut above what you get at Subway or Jimmy John's.  Keep in mind though--you're pretty much getting mall food court chow here.  I went for the turkey cheddar melt, which I ended up cutting in half and taking part of it back to the office, and a side salad.  

Oh, and Joe G.'s comment about the rather odd dialect spoken here--definitely spot on!"}
{"text":"I've never seen employees as angry and disgruntled as this restaurant. Scowling. Grimacing. Can't imagine how bad working their has to suck, but Jesus...even the robots at Sbarro are faking smiles. Food was edible but I was afraid I was eating dismembered former patrons."}
{"text":"Best Philly Cheese Steak around and by far the best restaurant in this food court. New Habanero BBQ is awesome and employees are always super friendly. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is now called Carolina Grill Company owned by a family. Food is always fresh. Fries made to order. Pricey but the portion speaks for itself. If I was to get a cheese steak in nc. It would be here."}
{"text":"There are mostly bad reviews here but our philly cheese steak sandwich tasted pretty good. My complaint is even though both sandwiches were made by the same person at the same time one sandwich was significantly smaller than the other (shouldn't I have been charged significantly less? LOL!) so to me this place has poorly trained employees which means poor management."}
{"text":"These are truly the sweetest people you'll ever meet! Love the Philly cheesesteak, and the fries! Cute place in Carolina mall"}
{"text":"It's not Philly... heck, it's the Pittsburgh airport.  But for those of us passing through with no real hope of getting anywhere near a proper cheese steak, the offering here is more than passable.  

Soft fresh rolls, the right choices of toppings, and quick service make this my regular stop when passing through the airport - and thanks to it's central location, it works for any airline connection!  

My seatmate (and sometimes my flight attendant too) eyes my sandwich jealously when I unwrap it.  Mmmmm....

The only lament I have?  The ratio of meat/cheese to bread is a bit low, often leaving me with two or three \"bread only\" bites at the end of my roll.  Boo, especially when the plane is taking off and I may be weeks or months away from my next PA stop."}
{"text":"Worst customer service I literally got disrespected by the staff food was sloppy I Will never be back"}
{"text":"Charley's has pretty good hot  sub sandwiches, and good lemonade.  Their fries are decent but nothing special."}
{"text":"Eh... not quite worthy of 2 stars, my usual \"leaves a lot to be desired\" rating, but not quite good.  

I had my first Charley's recently and am writing this review in case anyone is wondering if it is a good replacement for the usual go-tos.

Better than a toasted Subway sub, sure.  So is a bowl of plain yogurt.  But, it's not quite at the caliber of a Great Steak & Potato or Steak Escape, and not even in the ballpark with DiBella's.

Soft, squishy bread and your typical food court hot sub offerings inside.  Decent fries.

I prefer good crusty bread surrounding my grilled shaved steak product, but there's really nothing wrong with this place."}
{"text":"Philly steak and fries for lunch, nothing special. It was a good portion and average price for the size of the meal. The meal was prepared fast and cooked in front of your eyes. It delicious and well presented for fast food. One thing that keeps me coming back is the Cajun seasoned salt on their fries. It is a nice blend and keeps me wanting more every time I pass by. I'm a sucker for good seasoning. Therefore I will be back."}
{"text":"Hold up! Did I just bite into the best chicken cheese steak sub of all time? I'm telling you, this place, located in Paradise Valley Mall, has the best subs...PERIOD! When I was about to order, two young men were raving about how bomb the combo was and implored me to get it. Hey, you will want to buy two, because the six inch just isn't enough...lol. All jokes aside, do yourself a favor and go to the food court at PVM and grab a sub! They are delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Certainly dont know why this is the only Franchise in the city, but i sure am glad to have it on base available to me and my brothers in arms. 

I prefer grilled subs just over the fact that more flavor is brought out from the juices of the meat and caramelization from the vegetables. They offer Grilled Salads, Chicken, Deli, and my personal favorite.. Steak! Yea, theres the infamous Subway, Quizno's, and Port of Subs, although this Sub joint is one of a kind, literally. 
I love ordering their Philly Cheese Steak Deluxe which has grilled onions, green peppers, and provolone cheese. To top it off like i do, add some lettuce, tomatoes, and mayonnaise. 8
Not enough? Well good thing i forgot to mention they have Gourmet Fries! \"Whats gourmet fries, Wingman Lawrence?\" Im  glad you asked. They are fries with a twist, including cheddar cheese, bacon, and ranch! And boy are they to die for.. 9

Not really on the healthy side aspect, but this would be the fast food joint for me to splurge if im in the area."}
{"text":"Service is great here and you can always ask for those cards where your 7th or 8th sub is free. I love banana peppers on my sandwich and I always use a buy one get one free sandwich coupon here too:)"}
{"text":"Charlie's subs is one of those places you just end up at and then think, \"how did I get here and why did I spend so much money on this?\"

A meal combo should not cost me close to $20. I could go to a sit down dinner for that money and be served.

With all the other food options available in the area I would definitely go elsewhere."}
{"text":"If you cannot get on the base, don't worry about it, you are not missing much with this place at all.  The employees at not friendly, they don't look happy to be there and they act like short order cooks.  

I'll explain this last part.. Obviously the meat used for the Philly is some sort of beef that is ordered in attached to wax paper.  The meat is so thin and not fresh it sticks to the paper.  The girl literally reaches in the place where the meat is and throws it to the grill. If she cannot get all the meat off the paper, the extra meat is thrown in the trash and your sandwich gains bread.

There is very little pride in this place, you don't really get what you pay for here, the fries and not that great, and the word loaded, which the advertise is nothing like the picture.  I will not be back to this place and both the people who work here and eat here are really missing out on what a Philly cheese steak really is....it is SO MUCH MORE the what you will get here."}
{"text":"Probably similar to other franchise locations, but this airport location is the only one I have been to. 

With everything grilled up fresh, their cheese steak sandwiches are just more tasty than the Quiznos across the food court. I personally like a bit more seasoning on the grilled meat and vegetables.

Service is always friendly and fast which is important for the airport..."}
{"text":"On one hand I would give this place two stars. On the other hand I would give this place four stars. So three stars it is!

Located in the main food court Charley's Grilled Subs offers a variety of tasty meaty subs for your pre-flight meal pleasure, but primarily variations of cheesesteaks. Everything here is made to order and grilled in front of your eyes. The food is absolutely delicious. The meat is cut thin and lightly salted. The bread is nice and soft. The provolone is deliciously melted. They make a great cheesesteak and very quickly at that. 

They are also the unhappiest people in the airport. The McDonald's people were smiling more. They did not smile, they looked depressed and forlorn. They don't even talk to each other shouting orders and then disappearing in the back when their duty is done. Even their walk is one of dejection and sadness, more of a shuffle really. 

Come for the food, but don't expect the people to smile!"}
{"text":"This is the way to do breakfast while traveling and in airports. Fresh food. Delicious and large portions. If you're like me debating what and where to eat - eat here."}
{"text":"Philly cheese steak should have cheese melted and blended on the grille, not sitting on top."}
{"text":"I threw up when I was done!
So, I decided to try something different, I was going to go somewhere else in the food court, but I said, hey that line is hella long!  The food must be good!  I'll try Charley's!  You know.....I should have asked for my money back when she handed my my fries after I paid for my meal!  Who does that?  I don't understand this!  There were 4 people in front of me, and you give me my fries!  Ok, so yes I did voice my opinion right then and there, OUT LOUD!  That I don't see me EVER coming back here!  Why did they give me my fries now!   So one of the workers said they were down a man.....OK  I still have my fries and there getting cold!  Ok so  I didn't even think about it, but I hate pepper jack cheese, and that's what they put on the sandwich!  They don't even ask if Pepper Jack is ok!  So I go and take a table, and start eating it. Ummm the bun is soft, but there's no flavor in the steak!  Then OMG, here comes the Pepper Jack cheese!   Yea!  I really didn't care for this sandwich, I ate as much as I could, because I was hungry!  But as soon as I left I seriously threw up!  WOW!  Ummmmmm yea!  That sealed the deal!  They will never, ever get another dime out of me.  I should have gone to Denny's like I had planned!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Regular Chicken Philly. The chicken was overcooked and burnt. It was just a poorly made sandwich. Have definitely had better. 
Should have gone for the Chick fil a."}
{"text":"4300 Meadows Ln the black woman of this family hardly ever gave vegetables without onion, green pepper, almost no mushrooms, and even put a few slices of sour cucumber."}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I've been to Charleys for a grilled sandwich. Only because it's located in the food court at the BX. I used to eat these sandwiches more frequently when we lived close to a base back in the day. I'm glad I decided to revisit this place. Luckily it was just after the peak time at lunch, so the line wasn't too long. They seemed to have quite a few choices for sandwiches, other than your standard philly steak and cheese. There were a few chicken choices and and italian. I ordered the veggie delight, which basically comes with all the veggies just no meat. It was pretty good, I didn't miss the meat."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food tatses so fresh and the fries are always hot and crispy. I love their chicken sandwiches, my favorite is the chicken California (I think that's what its called), which comes with ranch. Delicious! The Phili cheese steaks are also really good, but I personally prefer chicken on my subs.

The menu is also very simple and easy to follow. Just pick a sub and the size of a sub, then decide if you want to make it a combo. Super simple! Also you can up your fry game and order them with cheese and bacon and stuff (I'm also not a big fan of the special fries just because they feel like a meal by themselves; so I only order them if I don't want a sub). And you add the toppings (such as lettuce, tomato, jalapeños, pickles, etc) at the end. 

Quick tips, if you want pepper or salt make sure to grab some packets because they don't add salt so you have to do that yourself, but honestly those fries are so good you don't need the salt. And the first refill is free, but any after that they charge you - I'm not sure how much but point is they charge you. 

The only reason I took off a star is because sometimes the staff is a little mean. It usually happens at night, which is understandable because its late they're ready to go home. But otherwise they're pretty nice and helpful! 

Charley's will always be my favorite food court place and as long as they stay open I will keep going! Definitely worth trying, and 20 times better than Panda, just saying."}
{"text":"I just had to write a review because you need to understand what you are/are not getting when you dine here. First of all, it's in a food court. I'll just leave that right there.
Great, fresh food made to order? You betcha! Nice friendly people? Not so much! I actually found it endearing, almost nostalgic being from NY. The employees (owners maybe?) are probably immigrants or maybe English is not their first language? I only suspect this from their heavy accents and my inability to clearly understand them. I could be wrong...would never want to assume! 
It reminded me of Greek diners open 24/7 up north. The food was fantastic. But you didn't go there for the warm, friendly atmosphere, that's for sure! And if you had a problem with your order? Oh man! Don't you dare tell them! 
But if you are looking for an awesome Philly (I had the chicken) made fresh to order, exactly the way you like it (they asked me twice), awesome fries and a decent bang for your buck, this is the place."}
{"text":"I was excited to try a new sub place, even if it was in a mall.  I saw they had a deal for a philly cheese steak and fries for $5.49.  The guy asked if I wanted to add a drink for a $1 more.  I said sure, then my total was eight something.  I thought, boy, that's a lot of tax.  Turns out the drink was actually $1.69.  Not a big deal and I wasn't going to fight over 69 cents, but why did they lie to me?  Weird.  Then I get my sub and it's basically the size of a six inch from Subway.  Great.  I finished it in about 4 bites.  Have you ever had those philly cheese steak sandwiches from Costco?  They are in the frozen section.  You microwave them.  I think those are actually better than these.  I won't be going  back here.  The food is a rip off.  I wouldn't mind paying $8 for mall food if it was really good- Sarku, Sbarro, etc.  But this crap isn't worth even $5.  If you want, I can take a dump and wrap it up and sell it to you for $8.  Probably would be more nutritious and taste better too."}
{"text":"Tasty and delicous!    My expectations were low because this is at an airport, but my steak sandwich was great and the fries were very good.  Service was pretty quick and the dudes working the cash register and grill were efficent and appealing.

I'd choose this place over McDonald's or Quiznos for sure."}
{"text":"The sandwich tasted good, while hot, and it cooled fast. Once lukewarm, it tasted like something I'd nuked from the freezer. Same with the cheesy fries."}
{"text":"Oh, is this place delicious  . I can't say anything other than incredible things about Charley's subs in Beachwood place. We are regulars here and we always get the cheesesteak sub with all the extras and the chicken cheesesteak as well. You cannot beat their fries and for me and my kids, we love the cheese fries. Heck, you only live once and as long as you eat in moderation you can enjoy these things - who's with me?
The lines here are usually long and lunchtime is a bit hard for me to get in. The staff is very polite but with all the people it may take a moment more than what you want.
Don't worry- it's so good and worth it . We always come to this place as their are so many options at the mall for food- this one is the best ."}
{"text":"I work downtown and occasionally visit this location.  Sara, the cashier was OUTSTANDING! She instantly knew exactly what I liked to eat and drink and it completely threw me off, in a good way of course!  Everyone there is always pleasant however, Sara is one of the best.  Keep her around.. she's definitely one in a million!"}
