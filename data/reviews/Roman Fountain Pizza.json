{"text":"Roman Fountain is our go-to when we're looking for classic neighborhood pizza. Prices are good, crust is tasty, overall good quality pizza. Like their salads and extras too. Love that it's family run and I've always had friendly customer service/delivery."}
{"text":"If it is Friday it is time for pizza. We always order from Roman Fountain. We followed it when it moved from another location to the current spot. Pizza is always excellent. Salads and calzones are also very good. We have tried several of the speciality pizzas but our trinity of pepperoni mushroom and sausage is our favorite. We have probably eaten dozens of pizzas a year over many years. Not a restaurant but for pizza carryout it cannot be beat."}
{"text":"We were disappointed with our pizza. The crust was undercooked and the quality of ingredients in the toppings were lacking. We try to always support small businesses in our community, but we will find somewhere else to get our pizza in the future."}
{"text":"I just recently moved to lwood, and I got the Roman coupons in the mail, so I tried it out. Pretty good pizza, better then any crap chain but not GREAT. I was hoping it would be bc I like Angelos but don't like spending $20 bucks for a pizza. So over all Roman was good but I'm not running back asap for another pie"}
{"text":"A co-worker mentioned how much they like Roman Fountain and it occurred to me that we have not been to Roman Fountain since possibly pre-2000.  With the first snowy and blustery weather of the season, I thought a salad and pizza was in order.  I ended up revisiting a former friend - Roman Fountain.

We did a chicken caesar salad and a pizza with pepperoni, mushrooms, green peppers and extra sauce.  Overall, I was very impressed with both the salad and the pizza.  It was very enjoyable and I would recommend them to others.

Note: the chicken in the caesar is kept in a separate container.  The dressing was very good.

The pizza was picture perfect.  Golden crust in a typical Cleveland-style (not thin, nor clearly not deep dish).  My only comment - they hover on that \"slightly skimpy\" range of toppings.  It was enough to qualify as adequate, however it is sitting at that low range.

Extra sauce is a necessity.  Their sauce is very flavorful and quite thick so extra sauce still soaks in well.  To give you an idea, there was still no sauce dripping off the pizza.

Like I said, a perfectly fine job.  The order was taken correctly and it was ready when promised.

Another point worth making, their pricing is reasonable compared to some of their competition. I'm sure being take-out or delivery only and being in business sine the mid-50's allows more favorable pricing.

Keep up the good work.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Free delivery and pretty decently priced food! I dig it. It's not amazing or anything but the quality is very solid and I was pleased with my stromboli! We got pick up and it took about five minutes longer than expected but the staff was nice and the food was good enough that I quickly forgot about the wait. We tried an appetizer sampler, too, and it was okay.. Again, it wasn't amazing but it was very well priced for some good greasy foods!"}
{"text":"Won't EVER  go there again,stood there for 10 mins waiting to pick up my order and was completely ignored even tho the person in the back saw me standing there, don't even wanna give one star"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Roman Fountain and always order it when I am getting pizza in the Lakewood area. My favorite is artichoke & pepperoni pizza. The staff is helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"A great option for a good neighborhood pepperoni pizza. Their pizza is so tasty, even my New Jersey native pizza snob husband requests it when we are feeling too lazy to cook. In addition to the good pie,  I especially love their Greek salad! Delivery is always prompt and friendly, and the food arrives fresh and just as ordered. In addition to the great food and service, I love how they decorate their front windows according to every holiday/season. It was the original reason I noticed the place and wanted to check it out, and the delicious food has kept me coming back."}
{"text":"Wow. I'm shocked at the quality vof the ingredients and how they build their pizza. I should have known from how good their lasagna is, but I was expecting much more divier of pizzas....boy was I wrong!! Thanks for the pleasant surprise. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Good local pizza. Have yet to be disappointed with their pizza. Chicken wings are ok. Fried and tossed in franks red hot. I hate that. Give me something different!!"}
{"text":"For a long time I've been loyal to a certain other Lakewood pizza establishment that I won't mention here... however, I've gotta say Roman Fountain's specialty Artichoke Chicken Pizza is soooo tasty that I keep coming back for it.  I like to order this white pizza when I'm in the mood for something different.  It's got a white garlicky ranch sauce, fresh tomatoes, big chunks of moist chicken, artichokes, and red onions.  I usually get this with their Caesar salad.   It's simple but done well with perfectly crisp lettuce, big chunks of shaved Romano cheese and tangy dressing.  The delivery was super fast and friendly too-- two thumbs way up!"}
{"text":"Only tried this place because they sent me a certificate for a free pizza in the mail.  Ordered a pizza and cheese sticks and sides of garlic sauce.  The pizza was wrong and the garlic sauce had leaked all over he box.  Pizza wasn't horrible, but probably won't bother with them again."}
{"text":"We just moved to Lakewood in October and received a coupon for a free pie. Since it was a snowy Saturday night we decided to give in and eat some comfort food. My husband stopped in to order the pizzas. He said the place is very nice, family owned, all fresh ingredients. We ordered two pies and they were delicious. I am from New Jersey/New York and we have the best pizza there. This pizza did not disappoint. I was very satisfied with the quality and the taste. Prices were more than I usually pay, but maybe by 3 dollars per pie. Will definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"Ever wondered what Pizza Hut would taste like if it wasn't a chain? Well, this is it.

Meh."}
{"text":"After moving into our new home in Lakewood we received a new resident gift certificate from Roman Fountain for a free medium pizza with 5 toppings! First of all, this is incredibly generous! Who doesn't love free pizza? We ordered our pie with pepperoni, ham, green pepper, pineapple and red pepper. We also ordered chicken tenders, fried zucchini and a Caesar salad. I'm giving Roman Fountain 4 stars for customer service (free pizza!) and quick delivery. While I enjoyed my Caesar salad and chicken tenders, I can't say I would order their pizza again. There was just something about this pizza that was very... \"meh.\" And I don't know that I've ever described pizza that way. While I realize we ordered 5 toppings they completely dominated the pizza and I barely tasted any cheese or sauce. The crust also just wasn't that interesting."}
{"text":"I really love their pizza. It's a great basic crust with loads of fresh ingredients for the price. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Love ordering from Roman Fountain!! The employees are always so nice ! Garlic Parmesan wings are the best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Roman Fountain is my favorite west side pizza joint. The pizza, itself, is great, which is what keeps my husband and I coming back.The prices are reasonable and you get good quality as well as a decent amount of food for your money. Their chicken wings are so good too - crispy rather than being drowned in sauce. Every time we've had special requests or changed up our usual selections, the folks at Roman Fountain always make it happen. I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We are not native to the area, only just moving here January 1st, and we were desperate to find a good pizza place. We found a great one!  We have had Roman Fountain Pizza for almost three weekends in a row.  Healthy?  Probs not, but we always look forward to it. Their delivery is speedy, and their delivery people are always so kind!  The pizza is probably the best I've ever had, and it's great for saving and munching on during the week. We've never had jalape√±o poppers with cream cheese before, and now I can't think of any other way to have them. Great job, guys!"}
{"text":"After four and a half long years of living in Lakewood, I believe I have found the best pizza place in this lovely burg, namely this eatery, possibly named after a vulgar sex act.

Seriously, I have found this place to be the most consistent and tasty take-out pizza in town. The search for such a joint has drained my wallet and expanded my pants size, but GODDAMMIT I finally did it. 

Seriously, though, that name isn't doing you any favors."}
{"text":"Gotten take out sausage pizza here many times and I dig it.  They have great coupons in the local coupon books.  People are super nice and they are always working their ass off when Im in there.  Place is always busy and thats a good sign.  Cant comment on delivery time because aside from having a newborn at home or being paralyzed I think people can get off their ass to get food.  If this place served 40s it would be a 5 star joint no doubt."}
{"text":"I really appreciate how nice the people are that work there. The food is pretty tasty, too."}
{"text":"Always great pizza, always great service. You can't go wrong with any of their pizzas, however I'm partial to the Hawaiian, the Deluxe. And the specialty meat pizza.
In a city of great pizza shoppes, Roman Fountain stands out as one of the best."}
{"text":"Great local pizza joint with quick delivery. We tried to give 3 1/2 stars, only because I asked for extra sauce and the pizza was still kind of dry. Luckily I have some Don P's at home to dip the crust and actually the whole slice!! We got bacon and mushroom great combo! All in all good value a great delivery. If they did get the sauce Ratio and maybe make the crust less thick than they would be the best in Lakewood. 

But come on Lakewood where is the cracker crust?!?"}
{"text":"Roman Fountain has redeemed my faith in finding decent delivery pizza in Lakewood Ohio. They have saved me from a life of humdrum, frozen disappointment, and trips to the East side for ever. I just discovered what most of Lakewood seemed to have already known. Why were you keeping this from me? Not only is their pizza FAB U LOUS, (tell them you want it well done. It will not be burned, just perfectly golden brown) so is their pasta and salads ans cheesy garlic bread. The crust is not too thick, and the price is right. Angelo-- good luck to you if more people find Roman Fountain. Keep your greasy, overpriced, goo. I'm very happy I found the Fountain. I wounder if they deliver this early?"}
{"text":"Pizza was really good. I liked the sauce but could use a little more cheese. Delivery time was 40 minutes."}
{"text":"Ordered this 5 days ago. IT WAS AWESOME! Meat pizza is so amazing. My boyfriend (who is drop dead gorg) LOVED it!

Our favorite place closed and this took over EASILY! Can't wait to order again on our next lazy cheat day!"}
{"text":"Pizza cheese is frozen. (You can tell from quality)  But doesn't make it bad.  Do not recommend the chicken caesar salad.  Should've asked for the dressing on the side.  I just assumed.  Pizza crust is the bees knees. Over all,  Not bad.  I was just looking for something very specific."}
{"text":"Thank you, Roman Fountain, for delivering us our 'za during a snow storm on National Pizza Day. I'm not even sure I liked green peppers before trying your pepperoni and pepper pizza, but this experience honestly may have converted me. Great cheese-to-sauce ratio, perfectly greasy pepperoni, and crust that I could actually tolerate without dipping sauce. And kudos to the delivery guy who didn't roll his eyes at me when I came to the door in head-to-toe pizza pajamas. I appreciated the chuckle. Yeah pizza!!"}
