{"text":"My husband and I love the pizza! We get the St. Anthony's and it is amazing! We tried the whiskey hot wings today and they are delicious! Staff is always friendly and drinks are good! We will definitely be back,,,,,"}
{"text":"2 adults and 2 teen boys all enjoyed food and service. Had meatball sub, chicken parmigiana and fettuccine Alfredo plus family Caesar salad. Didn't try pizza but wish he had!"}
{"text":"Love this place, terrific pizza and wings! The rest is probably great too I just can't ever order anything else. Best in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"This place was a wonderful find!  From the food to the service, we had an all around great experience.  The pizza is delicious and the bologna was AMAZING.  Special thanks to Michael R., our server!  Would definitely come back for seconds."}
{"text":"Two stars for food, but service was great. If you look at my pictures, I'm a badass foodtographer, so my photos do the food way more justice than it deserves - trust me, it looks WAY better than it actually tastes.   Truffle fries didn't look that great, but the truffle smell permeated in the air, so I still had high hopes...worse truffle fries I've ever had. Not that it was disgusting, just not very good at all. Definitely wouldn't recommend. Although I'm not going to lie, everybody thought it ended up being the best part of the meal.   The Dillinger takes 30 minutes to cook, so be sure to order as soon as you know you want it. Ours actually took longer than 30 minutes, but okay. I honestly do not understand what the hype is about. I love deep dish pizza, but this was like eating a dense piece of bread with all the toppings. My friends compared it to eating a week old baguette or wheat thins except thick. It was just really dry, dense, and hard to eat. I literally only took two bites out of my pizza and my boyfriend forced himself to finish one whole slice (we were all super hungry, but I just couldn't). I usually never try to get food taken off the bill no matter how bad it is, but my boyfriend doesn't like to pay for food that he has to try and force himself to eat. The manager came by and asked us what was wrong with it and it was so bad that we were at a loss for words to even try to explain. I felt super awkward because I didn't  want to seem like an asshole, but it was really bad. The manager did take the Dillinger off for us though, so that's a plus.   We also ordered the St. Anthony's but substituted the sausage for chicken and added an egg (for an uncharge). The chicken was so dry, it was legit dehydrated chicken. My friends said that it was just like the chicken they buy for their cats.   The Californian was okay to me. My friend who ordered it thought that it was super greasy. I thought it was definitely better than the other two (which still isn't saying a lot).  My friend ordered the spumoni , which I thought was okay. She said this was the first time she has not enjoyed spumoni because it tasted weird. I think spumoni always tastes kind of weird though, so I wouldn't know.   The mud pies were okay to me as well. Everybody else said it tasted frost bitten, but I only took a small bite, so again I wouldn't know. Definitely not worth $9 a slice though.  Long story short, we wouldn't ever return here for their food. Although our server and the manager was great, we all would have rather had some Pizza Hut or Tostinos."}
{"text":"Tartufo pizza was great! Loved the idea of a complimentary soup to start. Service was ok but random and a bit distracted. Would be interested in going back and trying again though"}
{"text":"Cal Italia pizza was unique (in a good way) as it successfully incorporated fig jam, Asiago and prosciutto into a nice pie.  Food served hot as it left the pizza oven.  Super inexpensive."}
{"text":"Golly. This was the worst pizza I've ever had. They had the most dry pieces of chicken I've ever had to chew on. It crunched when I ate it. I don't think it was suppose to crunch. The sauce was horrid and the combination of the ingredients was even worse. To be honest it was about a month ago and I can't for the life of me remember what I ordered. I know my friend ordered their specialty and there was nothing special about it. They sent it back. Even their simple margarita was lackluster. Mud pies for dessert. Never again. They were frozen with frost bite all over it. I can't say I enjoyed any part of that meal. Oh yeah. Even their Dr. Pepper was weird. It was like not enough carbonation and not enough concentrate. It was like they took Dr. Pepper and mixed it with regular water. Overall I have used this place as a curve when I grade my meals. I always say now. At least it wasn't as bad as Little Tony's."}
{"text":"Was really looking forward to trying out this place and giving it Chicken Parm Test.  You can easily judge a true Italian restaurant by the quality of the chicken parm they serve.  Plus I love chicken parm!  So I show up last night around 8:30pm while some UFC fight is on the TV at the bar.  Well the host is so involved with watching the fight he ignores me standing right in front of him at his stand for a solid 5-10 minutes.  Finally I decide to just seat myself.  I already had the feeling this wasn't going to go well.....  I wait another 10 minutes sitting alone at a table in the middle of the restaurant until a waiter asks me if I need a menu and a drink.  He takes my order for a diet Pepsi and hands me the menu which I wanted to look through even though I knew what entree I was ordering.  I considered a salad or appetizer but decided against it because I remembered reading other reviews saying they give you a complimentary pasta fagioli soup.  I got my diet soda right away, but it was too sweet and FLAT.  The waiter comes back a good 10 minutes later to take my order.  So I order the chicken parm and he tells me \"sorry we're all out of chicken parm\". Well....so much for that!  I will not be back based on the service and general atmosphere of the place.  Can't explain why but it seems very harsh and not homey despite the booths lining the walls of the place. Maybe it's the brick walls with high ceilings and bright lighting."}
{"text":"Great build your own Old Fashioned and don't miss the Meatballs they are perfection.  Family size portions are available and the prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"I have been a regular at Pizza Rock since they opened and consider it one of the best in Las Vegas. But Little Tonys is nowhere near the quality and taste of the original. The salads and starters , like the calamari ,are very good. But the pizza , in my opinion is no better quality than a first rate frozen. They are poor copies of the original and anyone who is a Pizza Rock fan will notice it at once. Too Bad."}
{"text":"I'm writing this as a Brooklyn boy (Bensonhurst if it matters) who has lived all over and worked in the culinary field for over 35 years: Go to this restaurant. From the meatballs to the bread to the sauce to the pizza, every bite is worth more than you pay and just as good as anything I have ever tasted. The service was also great, not that I honestly paid much attention to anything but my next bite. Go to this restaurant."}
{"text":"The pizza's were delicious and the service was good. Two big downers: our waiter failed to tell us about the early bird specials which I happened to discover on the drinks menu, and which saved us $2 on each of our 9\" Pizza.  Also the noise level was incredibly high. It was impossible to carry on a conversation with other members of our party without shouting. Loud music overhead and brick walls makes for lousy horrible acoustics."}
{"text":"Was staying at the Palace Station and came into Little Tony's with friends. We had a blast as our waitress/server was very friendly. We had the Meatball Appetizer and Cal Italia Pizza. The meatballs were really good, just wish it came with bread. The Cal Italia was pretty good as well.  We came back Sunday to watch football and had the Old Chicago and The New Yorker. Now these are the ones that made me give the 5 stars. I hope this restaurant picks up in popularity since it is hidden away at the Palace Station."}
{"text":"just had a Michigan ave pie with my wife... UNBELIEVABLE.... BEST PIZZA IN VEGAS!!!   WELL worth the trip away from the strip...."}
{"text":"The BEST gluten free pizza I've ever had!! The crust is amazing and does not taste gluten free at all! My husband tried it and loved it too! Little Tony's is located inside the Palace Station Casino a little off strip but is worth the cab for this pizza!!"}
{"text":"Service was great! Artichoke spinach was the best but the Dillinger pizza was awesome!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went for an early dinner to avoid the heavy crowds and unfortunately that didn't matter. The waiter was very helpful in finding a wine to try and letting my wife try the sauce on the dillenger pizza (pizza had good flavor but a touch spicy and a bit over cooked, if it wasnt for the extra sauce we would have sent the pizza bavk) to see if we would like it. However he only checked on us once early on in the meal. We were told the dillenger pizza would take 30 mins. Which was not a huge deal because we order a salad to start (the caprese salad, salty but not bad), however we waited almost 20 min.after our drinks were empty And I had to flag down our server. By that time we were ready to go and very aggravated.  Now I understand you get busy but we were not the only table to have that issue and he had to walk by our table everytime to fill up other customers beverages and orders. My wife and I would love to go back to try other pizzas they offered but after the poor service and over cooked pizza we won't be back. We also had a groupon so I don't know if they felt the wouldn't get tipped well so they didn't try very hard and that's why we had poor service but whether you have a groupon or not we tip based on service so I guess food for thought, just because you have a child with you or a groupon or both shouldn't be a reason for poor service. That's coming from experience."}
{"text":"Love this place. Good atmosphere inside the restaurant despite the not so great atmosphere in the casino. I ordered a pizza with like 5 cheeses and prosciutto and a balsamic drizzle on it because it said it was the food network winner. It was delicious....but when I went to receive a comp the lady was telling me how great the New Yorker pizza was. I went back and asked the gentleman running the place about it and he said people go crazy over the New Yorker so that is definitely what needs to be tried next time. Also had the honey whisky wings that had a lot of sauce and flavor and the perfect amount of spice. Great service as well. Great bar great beer."}
{"text":"This place is  delicious,  we ordered the \"New Yorker\"  pizza... And it's quite amazing!!  The staff is really great too"}
{"text":"Cute Italian place. Pizza is good! My fav has been the Diaviola. Very conveniently located near Sportsbook. On Saturday they have a great \" date night\" special; salad, large pizza, dessert, 4 beer/wine for $50. I like this place better than the sister chain Pizza Rock."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice. Very basic overpriced Italian restaurant. Service is average, the employees are pleasant, and the place was totally dead on a Friday night. I guess we will see how long the Hotel subsidizes this average restaurant.  Subway is next door, I wish we went there.  There full service bar is reasonably price.  The chicken Alfredo is delicious, but they don't make a pizza."}
{"text":"Pizza was great but the service was AMAZING! Waiter was on his A-game! Constantly refilling drinks, changed the channel because we were talking about the Texas Astros baseball game... He flipped it right to the channel! And our plates were cleaned! I recommend eating pizza here versus getting the typical Pizza Hut, Dominos, etc!"}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend love this Italian Restaurant. We find it one of the best Italian restaurants in Las Vegas. Even though half of their menu is pizza and there are about 10 or less other entrees, I love their Chicken Parmesan, it's the best I've ever had. Needless to say, their mozzarella sticks are probably the best I've ever had, as well. Way better pricing than some places on the strip, and the quality is amazing."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed in the new menu. We have been here several times in the past and enjoyed the 9\"pizza option that allowed us to try several speciality pizzas. They have eliminated a couple appetizers as well as small portion of pasta. Disappointing to say the least. We won't be purchasing anymore Groupon or living social deals that used to make for a great evening out."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I wandered in to LIttle Tony's- just looking for a place to eat before a movie on a Friday night. We were pleasantly surprised. The atmosphere is great. We climbed into a big, round, red leather booth and were instantly brought a nice, small portion of soft bread- nothing too overwhelming or too filling. Danielle, our server greeted us. My boyfriend is a vegetarian, and likes to get recommendations from servers. Not only did Danielle lead him to try a new Irish Whiskey, which he loved, she combed the menu with us, explaining things and helping to choose two yummy pizzas! ( we don't even eat pizza!)   I had the bronx, and he had a balsamic reduction fig pizza. Both were very tasty.   This place is romantic enough for a date, and atmospheric and accommodating for a family dinner.   The only thing that could be improved is the complimentary soup-- ours was just broth with 3 fava beans and some stewed tomatoes.  I like the idea of light, but this needed a little something more.  Good food, wonderful atmosphere, and attentive service! See if Danielle is there- she is the best! She will guide you with sincerity, patience and poised attentiveness."}
{"text":"So I suggested you guys should get the Meatball sandwiches and you did it... that is a great way to get repeat customers is to listen to your customers.  I tried the meat ball sandwich and it is GREAT that meat ball with that sauce and cheese... the bread was so soft and perfect.  Can't wait to see what other creations this restaurant comes up with.  I think any great restaurant should have a crave food and I know they are known for there pizzas but I haven't found one person to say that the meatballs weren't great.  I guess what I am saying is that I have found my new crave food with Little Tony's meatballs.  One day I will try the Hot House Made Calabrese Sausage or not order the Cal Italia and try the Sausage & Peppers.  Maybe another dish that can be converted to a lunch sandwich.  Every time I go in the staff gets better and in more synch with each other.  If there is only one complaint is that we had ordered the family Alfredo to take home for dinner after having lunch there.  By the time we got home there was no sauce left it either got soaked up or there wasn't enough prepared with it."}
{"text":"Food is amazing all made from scratch right down to the sausage and pepperoni. This restaurant takes authenticity to an entirely different level for restaurants. I am sure more awards to come for  best Everything."}
{"text":"The New Yorker is fantastic.  I have had it several times now.  They got rid of the JERK  with the pony tail that was the lead bartender a while back and the atmosphere is much much better now.  I would highly recommend and the value for your $ is great."}
{"text":"It's 4.5 star food, but I have to give it a 1* so that hopefully someone like the owners notice this because it's a problem that needs to be addressed.    First the pros:  I go here all the time, but not anymore since I can only go during the day for reasons explained later.  Best Sicilian slices you will ever have.  I love the sauce and how they will make the pizza however you want it.  I have had slices, specialty pizzas, and calzones, all of which were phenomenal.  The bad: the girl who works there usually at night has the worst customer service attitude and skills I have ever come across.  She screwed up my order horribly, but I am very understanding and was like, \"no big deal...it happens.\"  However when I brought it to her attention she gave me a dirty look and didn't say a word, not sorry, or anything.  Later on, another patron sitting next to me comments how the attitude of her and other workers was really bad. His words were: \"These are some real attitude having MFers here.\"  So I bring this up to someone who knows the restaurant.  I used to work at Palace Station so I know who to talk to.  I find out that she is married to the regional manager of the restaurant and is best friends with the manager, and was told based on that I could forget about any complaint going anywhere and the best course of action is to write a Yelp review.  So here you go...  Update:  One of the owners was very responsive and assured the issue had been resolved.  I went back the next night for more outstanding food (best pizza in Vegas).  The service was great as I was fortunate enough to get a great server who was polite, professional, and did an outstanding job.  Hopefully this doesn't happen again, but if it does, I will be sure to Yelp."}
{"text":"This is a place yoyu have to stop at if you are ever in vegas, the food in this place was amazing, we ordered the calamari to start, it was cooked to perfection. Then we ordered Cal Italia pizza Which had Asiago, Mozzarella, Imported Gorgonzola, Sweet Fig Preserve, Prosciutto de Parma, Parmigiano-Reggiano, Balsamic Reduction. It was to die for all the amazing flavours working together and the crust was so delicious I could eat it all day. We also had Chicken Alfredo and it was good too but the pizza kept my hands busy I couldn't put it down.  All the staff were very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu everything was reasonably priced, I would have eaten here everyday and tried everything. If I could give more than 5 stars I would, I'm definitely coming back to Vegas just for this place."}
{"text":"Was looking for quality Italian food, and we definitely found it here. We were skeptical due to the location but were happy with the results. The service was great and so was the food."}
{"text":"Great meal for a great price. Server very attentive. Loved the cheesy garlic bread and of course the pizza."}
{"text":"I purchased a Groupon for here, and I am extremely pleased with that decision.   I had never been inside Palace Station until I made my trek to Little Tony's. While the decor of the restaurant and the location were not my favorite, I could understand that the restaurant was aiming for a \"classic\" vibe.   Since we had a $50 Groupon, and it was just the two of us, we had to go a little bit crazy. We ordered the garlic fries, the mac and cheese, and baked salsiccia, and a cast iron pizza. The fries were awesome, which you would not expect of an Italian restaurant. The weren't too garlicky, which is definitely a common theme in flavored fries. They also weren't crunchy. I like my fries softer, so this was perfect.   The mac and cheese was fantastic -- al dente and overwhelmingly cheesy. I would not hesitate to order this again.   The baked salsiccia was my least favorite of the dishes. It didn't have enough flavor for me, but I also don't eat sausage. My dining companion said the sausage cased in house was great. I would still pass on this one.  The cast iron pizza was a huge hit. Not too saucy but perfectly thick, cheesy, and salty. At $25, I am not sure that I would come here to get it at full price, but I was extremely happy with it. Our carb overload left me happy as a clam.  The service was also excellent. The waiter/bartender was always helpful, informative, and passionate. He made the experience even better. The restaurant was not busy, and I hear that it doesn't get super busy, but I wish more people knew about it. It blows Pizza Rock out of the water."}
{"text":"Amazing food & amazing service. The bartender aaron was very personable & made it feel like home instantly. The food was one of the best meals I've ever had. I would definitely recommend the rosemary fries! Love love love it!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple times since opening date & the food has been good. This time tried some pasta ordering through postmates for delivery. Lasagana looked really flat but tasted way better than it looked. Mostaccioli & meatballs very good with 3 large meatballs. Forgot to take pics because we were really hungry but will have again! postmates was awesome!"}
{"text":"I used to think this was a very good place to go. Now I know, I can not live without this amazing perfect dining experience. 150% outstanding every second, every single time. WOW"}
{"text":"Delicious! Excellent menu. Food was amazing. They do a lot of their food from scratch. Well priced. We had great service. Would come back again!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were craving pizza on Friday night! Unfortunately- we called Little Tony's. We have been to the restaurant quite a few times and we have had takeout here without an issue in the past. The pizza has always been quite outstanding-- that is until Friday, February 02. We ordered deep dish, The Frank Nitti, along with Lasagna and a Caesar salad. We ended up eating the lasagna as the pizza was just disgusting. It was the first time I have ever had deep dish pizza without any fillings. The crust was like sponge cake, it was like a giant sponge cake, dry and void of any flavor. I didn't want it to ruin movie night, so I took some pics of it and I called Little Tony's the next day to complain. The girl who talked on the phone with me was disinterested and not willing to do anything about it. So, I said to her that if we were dining in the restaurant, we would have sent the pizza back and they would have made us another one. She seemed to get upset on the phone asking me if we have had their deep dish before, and how did we have it delivered. Anyway, talking to her was pointless, she took my name and phone number, promised to have management call me and no one ever called me back. We threw the pizza out and I am shocked by the lack of customer service and not caring about their loyal customers. If you are reading this Little Tony's, I didn't get the name of the girl on the phone, my check number is #2322498. I have my receipt."}
{"text":"What a great little secret. Little Tony's is an exceptional deal for the price. The dishes are large and can feed more than one person. I had the bruschetta which said three people as an appetizer. The pizzas were done perfect, they were fresh, hot and the crust was light and bubbly.The cheese did not overpower, nor did it smother the other ingredients  The help at little Tony's was exceptional. I took a soccer team with 40 people to their establishment and they handled it perfectly. The service was excellent  the food was excellent and the price for the meal was exceptional.Little Tony's is great little place to visit, Ihope you enjoy if you go."}
{"text":"Great pizza from this restaurant located off the casino in Palace Station.    It's got the decor of an east coast pizzeria with brick walls and checker tile floors... but it's a tall open space, so it could be a bit more intimate if they really wanted to recreate that ambience.   3 types of pies are on offer... American, New York and Chicago.  I opted for the Old Chicago deep dish...  Wow... Delicious thick buttery crust... hearty toppings... great heaping of sauce on the top... perfect.  I can't claim any authenticIty to you Chicago Pizza purists as I'm no expert, but I can say this pizza was delicious.  Can not wait to return to try a New York style pie!  Definitely worth the slog through the smokey casino if you're in the area and want good pizza."}
{"text":"We ordered the Old Chicago and the New Yorker. Great pizza, cooked well, nice thin crust on both. Not sure we are fans of the dollops of ricotta piped on after the pizza is cooked, we had to spread it around so we werent eating a big lump in one bite. It worked out ok. The calamari mild and spicy were both great. Service was attentive and friendly. We used a Groupon, we feel it's overpriced,  just dont get $20 for pizza. We probably would go back for happy hour or for the board specials."}
{"text":"Have eaten once at Pizza Rock and then heard this place was a sister restaurant.  Decided to check it out so I didn't have to drive downtown and put up with the parking there.    The decor was very nice in comparison to the casino and not as kitschy as Pizza Rock.  I sat at the bar and was able to ask the bartender to change the TV over to the football game I was interested in watching.  I was there around 11am and while the place was not busy, the service was good.  The menu was an abbreviated version, but thankfully included the \"New Yorker\" pizza.  The pizza was very good and at $17, it was much cheaper than the same pie over at the Rock ($25).  I don't know that I could tell any difference.    If you're staying on the strip, I'd say Little Tony's is worth the short drive for some good pizza."}
{"text":"This spot wasn't even on my radar til it was featured on Groupon! My guy goes to Palace Station for the sports book, but I rarely venture in myself. This spot was a lot better than expected and is a big upgrade from the previous forgettable restaurant!  MEATBALL APP: Get it, they're just as good as sibling Pizza Rock's version. 3/$5 is enough to share, they're huge and swimming in a great sauce. Save it for dipping your pizza crusts. HOT HOUSE MADE CALABRESE SAUSAGE: I almost didn't get this after reading the menu description that said it was sauteed in local honey, but I'm glad my guy suggested it. Spicy sausage meets sweet sauce, surprisingly balanced with good but not overwhelming heat. CAPRESE HOUSE SPECIAL SALAD: The small is still big enough to share, but I found this salad overdressed and underwhelming. The mozz was good, but there were barely any peppers or olives. All of the produce was super fresh though. THE STATION PIZZA: Classic meat-heavy pizza with pepperoni, salami, linguica, bacon, bell pepper, olives, tomatoes, and two types of onions. Overflowing with toppings, you can share a 9\" small and still be satisfied. My guy and I both agreed we'd get this again. CAL ITALIA: One of their featured award-winning pies, with four cheeses, sweet fig preserves, prosciutto, and balsamic drizzle. I've had similar pies and enjoyed them, but the balsamic almost overwhelmed this version. Still good, but not great. SAUTEED SPINACH: Where can you find shareable sides for only $3 these days?! This order was a huge heap of spinach, lightly seasoned and an awesome addition to our otherwise heavy dishes.  CARAMEL BREAD PUDDING: I'm not much of a bread pudding fan, but it was my guy's choice and it was actually pretty good. Served in a cute skillet, caramel flavors are only hints rather than a punch in the mouth, good for sharing.  Service was attentive and friendly throughout, wish I'd caught the guy's name because I'd request him again. Seat yourself, snag a cushy booth if you can. Note that they have lunch specials and HH specials to take advantage of, as well as the occasional deal up on Groupon."}
{"text":"Classic Italian pizza  Cal Italia was unbelievably good along with caprese salad.  Single portions are large enough to share. Yes it will be different than most Italian restaurants you have been to.  Excellent quality food.  Great to have this wonderful restaurant at Palace Station"}
{"text":"We came here for dinner. Kids eat free on Wednesday's. That is even better for us since we have a 4 year old daughter that loves pizza and spaghetti. My daughter was given crayons and a menu to color on.   As we entered, we were seated by the waitress. I like the decor inside (see my photo). It is kid friendly. Our waiter came by to give us menus and took our drink orders. I ordered an iced tea while my daughter had a pineapple juice.   We ordered a couple of happy hour items which were the three meatballs in a garlic pasta sauce. So garlicky and good. Meatballs were soft and flavorful. Next were the garlic Rosemary fries which were bomb! The fries were crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. You can taste the garlic and rosemary. Perfect blend of flavors. I can eat this all day. Finally we ordered a 9\" The Station pizza which consisted of small pepperoni, mushrooms, yellow peppers, olives, ham, small cherry tomatoes cut in half, etc. The pizza crust was crunchy and fresh. The ingredients were fresh which is how a pizza should be made. I was impressed with this place. The waiter refilled our drinks. I definitely enjoyed my food here.   Service was great and I enjoyed my meal. I definitely recommend this place if you crave a good pizza and spaghetti."}
{"text":"Food = good...Manager with the beard and bald head = Jerk. Pls go somewhere else. I love Tonys and have been to mothership in SF...superb. That said, there are far too many winderful pizzerias in LV to waste your time and money with this mook."}
{"text":"Fantastic! I'm writing this review as I sit inside of Tony's, I couldn't wait to say how great it is. The food was great, excellent pizza and the pepperoni was great. Dessert was even better. Kind of an odd location inside the casino at Palace Station but well worth it."}
{"text":"The food was good and so was the service. Only complaint is they sold the place to Stations and the menu was cut down. The meatballs are gone. The Chicago thin crust is gone. The pizza is still good, but it isn't the same.  If you are nearby, it is worth trying; but I wouldn't go out of my way."}
{"text":"Have now been there 4 times and every time has been great!! Easily the best calamari I've had in Vegas!! The pizzas are dynamite and the wait staff has always been professional and courteous!! The best part of Palace Station is this gem of a restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Do not eat here.. Terrible food.. Lousy service! Told the waiter three times we did not want to be rushed.. Empty restaurant so no reason. Food came out while we were still eating our salad. Waiter did not even get my husbands dinner order so shared my entre with him. Ordered s bottle of wine and waiter just poured it without even offering us a taste first. We were comped desert which was the best part of the meal."}
{"text":"North Beach style Italian cuisine. We came here to celebrate my S.O.'s sister-in-law's birthday. We sampled almost everything on the menu. The New Yorker pizza was perfect as was the salami and cheese appetizer plate with honey. The homemade sausage is really good too and had the right. When each of our individuals meals arrived they was enough to feed two people each. Our servers were really good to us and they served my friend a slice of Dago Mud Pie and helped sing happy birthday. We could not have asked for better food or experience. Thanks Little Tony.  We'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Melissa at the bar is great. Really cute and super friendly. Had their porter from Barleys Brewery. Paired great with the Bourbon BBQ Chicken pizza (thanks for the recommendation, Melissa).  She also made me a fantastic Espresso Martini, just the way I like it (and just the way it should be) with Vanilla vodka, Kahlua, and fresh brewed espresso."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza and drinks . I had the the duchess and my boyfriend had the Capone drink both were incredible and I highly recommend them . The marinara sauce  is homemade and has great flavors. The service was great and everyone was friendly ."}
{"text":"We just dined in and we used a goupon and we were not disappointed. The groupon says it's $50 for 2 ppl but there was 4 of us and they didn't care.  The pizza was delicious. The same chef/owner from pizza rock from downtown.  We will be back. FYI they have a $1 soft serve come special. Get it! It's Delicious!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Been here 3 times now. It's not what you would expect to find in a place like Palace Station. The menu is similar to Pizza Rock but has more of a wider selection. Everything we have ever ordered is great - and the decor is fun and funky also!"}
{"text":"i really like the pizza here however it seems like the staff has changed. not for the better. the last few times i visited  there was no welcoming, a waitress walked right passed me the first 10 minutes without saying anything to me. very dissapointed in the staff. its too bad, i hope they can get it together."}
{"text":"The service was outstanding, our waiter Marcuswas very kind. We only had one problem, one person in my party ordered the chicken fingers and it was undercooked, but replaced it and took it off the bill. I recommend this restaurant, the food was delicious, but is not what we expected. We really expected pizza rock because it is the same owners but a totally different food venue . If you're looking for a classic Neapolitan pizza this is not the place because they don't have the correct  oven to cook them. The manager came out and explain to us the difference between this place and pizza rock and the difference of the ovens. The meatballs were on point and the pizzas were just okay. But the service was incredible and the people are very friendly . If you're really into pizzas like I am, I highly suggest you check out pizza rock before coming here. I would def  come back if they started making real Neapolitan pizza here, but they don't. If you just want a good pizza this is definitely a place to go ,  but I'm just being honest that it's not the real deal. Outstanding service and very awesome people work here. I like they have kids meals too! I'm gonna try it again sometime ."}
{"text":"Excellent service, great Caesar salad, lasagna and spaghetti with meatballs.  The free bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar is awesome!  Amazing Italian wines for 29 a bottle!"}
{"text":"Great service/good pizza/great crust/great lasagna.  Portions were large and they have a good drink menu with lots of choices."}
{"text":"Ever had a \"mouth-gasm?\" I have. And it happened after I ate the pizza from here.  Little Tony's is the sister restaurant of Pizza Rock, with a smaller menu and without all the craziness. It's hidden inside Palace Station and I can only assume that it's not busy because most people don't know it's there? Well now you know, you're welcome!  We ordered some food to-go for my brothers birthday dinner. We originally were going to dine in, but my grandma has a hard time walking and we figured it would be better to eat at home. Unfortunately because of this, most of the food was cold when it arrived, but even cold that shiz was delicious. Here's what we had:   -Meatballs -Baked Salsiccia- Baked Mostaccioli Pasta, House made Fennel Sausage, Ground Beef,  Garlic, Light Tomato Cream Sauce -Cheese pizza -New Yorker Pizza-Tomato Sauce, Mozzarella, Sliced House Made Sausage, Pepperoni,  Ricotta, Garlic, Oregano, Oil -Old Chicago Pizza-Tomato Sauce, Mozzarella, Provolone, Sliced Meatballs, Fennel Sausage, Garlic, Ricotta, Romano, and Oregano -Pepperoni Pizza  I really enjoyed everything, but my favorite was the New Yorker. This pizza had delicious slices of pepperoni, sausage that's made in house, and dollops of fresh ricotta cheese. I could not get enough of this pie and while eating it, I wish it didn't have to end. The flavors on this pizza were unlike any I have had before. Pricing is a bit on the $$$ side, but I think it's worth it. They use only fresh ingredients and some items they only make a certain amount of per day. My family seemed to enjoy the food as well, commenting that it was different than what they are used to. They are from Chicago and loveeeee their pizza. There was so much food we had leftovers for days. Let me tell you that I hate leftovers but I gladly ate the leftover food from here. It was so good. I literally can't wait for my next meal here."}
{"text":"Awesome food,  you must,  must,  must go here. Totally worth the drive to the \"questionable\" area of Las Vegas at Sahara and  the 15. We had the Cal Italian pizza, the New Yorker, meatballs and split a Ceasars salad, yummmo!!! Our server , Mark, was great and gave us great recommendations. Used a Groupon,  we will definitely be back, don't you miss it."}
{"text":"Unbelievably good pizza. Ice cold beer. Friendly bar service from Aaron. The Hard Hat special is impossible to beat. $7.99 for individual pizza and a soda, $9.99 if you want beer! We've been everywhere for pizza. Including Italy, Chicago and New York, this pizza is just SOLID. Almost forced myself to finish because it was THAT good."}
{"text":"This place was good. We were influenced to come and try this place out through Groupon... And we weren't disappointed.  We made reservations for 9 and waited a while to get our table set up.  FOOD: The appetizer was delicious. Ordered the meatballs and the sauce they came in was fantastic.  The cesar salad was pretty decent too.  The cheese that was in it was a bit over bearing for me, but then again I'm not a big fan of the smelly foot cheese.  For the entree, I ordered the parmesan eggplant !!! It was my absolute favorite hands down!!!! Last we ordered the Milligan pizza (???? I think that's what it was called) Chicago style.  Let me tell you that it takes about 35 minutes to cook this bad boy and once you see it you'll know why.  Its a super deep dish thick crust !  It had a strong flavored cheese on it that I wasn't too crazy about, but then again I'm a plain Jane kind of gal.  I tried my son's simple pizza which including pepperoni and sausage toppings and that was tasty too.    In all, it was a good experience.  If you guys are at place station, this is a yummy place to stop by and try.  Go and see MICHAEL R.! He was a good waiter."}
{"text":"The Skinny update: skip the Dillinger - the \"world's best pizza\" is pretty terrible; hit the spaghetti & meatballs special, sausage and peppers or the sautéed spinach instead (3.5), service is pretty good at this pizza joint (4)value: with some hits and misses on the menu this place rates a 3.5 with bump up to 4.  Okay,  right off the bat,  there are some great things about Little Tony's but some changes have happened since  my last review.   The complimentary soup is now gone which isn't a huge loss in my eyes as it wasn't that great to begin with.   The spaghetti and meatballs special for 2 on Sundays is still really a great value and absolutely delicious for $26.99. The generous helpings of garlic bread (half a loaf) ,  Caesar salad (large portion, also really good with their house dressing) that come with it are also excellent Italian American classics (see previous review for more details).   So we came in with a $50 Groupon we got. We finally deviated from our spaghetti special leanings to try the Dillinger. At $35, it is the most expensive pizza on the menu... But was it worth it? Magic eightball reads absolutely not.   Sporting a kind of deeper crust with a coating of cheese, the Dillinger crust was too doughy and thick in texture for my taste. It's not a really good representation of deep dish pizza at all (hardly a Gino's or a Lou Malnati's). The sauce was very bland for a \"smoky vodka sauce\", and the vegetables were not completely cooked on top of the pizza. As a matter of fact, the broccoli was on the verge of rawness which was off putting. The small slice of dry chicken on top really didn't do it for me in terms of protein/vegetable ratio. Overall, the flavors and textures didn't work well together at all and I would hate for others to think that this dish is representative of what this restaurant has to offer.  We also got the fennel sausage with peppers and sauteed spinach. I loved the tangy, rich tomato vodka sauce that smothered the fennel sausage. It was so good and such a guilty pleasure. I would not hesitate to order it again and the serving size is quite generous (it sports at least 3 large sausages in the dish). The only thing that would have made it better would be some bread to mop up some of the delicious sauce. The sauteed spinach was also a solid dish but didn't have the wow factor of the fennel sausage.  Despite the disappointment with the Dillinger, we still really love this place and are interested in exploring their menu. Service is still good and prompt with refills. The spaghetti Sunday special is the best value here and we'll definitely hit this place up again for that alone (3.5 starred review with a bump up to 4 stars)."}
{"text":"Visiting Vegas for the week. We like to dine off the strip. Little Tony's was not far so we decided to try it. Great choice! The server was excellent(Michael). We had the calamari appetizer,the Cal Italia pizza,Spaghetti Bolognese,Mud pie for dessert. The pizza was the star! The combination of cheeses, fig, prosciutto was delicious. Followed closely by the mmm mmm meatballs. So good the meatballs were not heavy,very moist great seasonings. I would have given a 4.5 if possible, not a 5 only because the first time the calamari was brought to the table it tasted like it had been cooked in oil in which other food had been burned. However, a new plate was brought out promptly and it was cooked perfectly. Very light coating and calamari sooo tender. Well worth it. Make this a must go destination. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Really good. I would say it's all the good stuff about Pizza Rock  (minus the green beans) without the size. It is small and hopefully a secret that only some of us will know about. I would have liked my drink to be bigger, the food to come out faster but happy it is near downtown without going to the grand and dealing with their parking. Honestly I think this pizza is better! Way to go!"}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time. I was greatly impressed by the pizza I ordered. It was a hand tossed pepperoni pizza. I wish I could order one here at home in LA.  My husband ordered the spaghetti with meat sauce and meatballs. He wasn't too happy with his dish, I loved it and ate most of his. They serve their pasta Al dente. Which I love, but since my husband doesn't care for it that way, I never get to have it my way. My dining guests ordered the calzones and was pleased with theirs. The service was fast and very friendly. Since I always stay at the Palace when I'm in Vegas, I'll be back eating at Tony's again.  I'd recommend the restaurant and it's menu greatly."}
{"text":"The food & service was excellent. We got the Cal Italia Pizza which is the Food Network Pizza Champions Challenge gold medal winner. Our server John was very friendly & attentive. Definitely coming back again."}
{"text":"This restaurant was disgusting and deserves an audit by the health department, and classes on how to cook. Go somewhere else, as there are cleaner establishments ran by people who know food safety and preparation for better pizza. The staff even had an opportunity to make it better, but were completely unapologetic and showed no sense of empathy or professionalism to the matter; and so pizza lovers and possible lifetime patrons have been lost. It gets one star because zero was not a choice."}
{"text":"We came to Little Tony's based on reviews and having read someone's review that it is similar to Pizza Rock.  We ordered the New Yorker and the Bourbon BBQ pizza, meatballs and baked chicken and shrimp pasta.  Everything was absolutely delicious and just fantastic.  The only thing that wasn't good was the bread that came with the pasta and their ice water, but definitely no deal breaker.  The service was on point and the food came out super fast.  I highly recommend this place.  Definitely coming back for seconds."}
{"text":"Very good Pizza.  Very good service. Got The Station which is a classic American. Coming from Connecticut and working out of New Haven I'm sometimes hard to please with pizza. 5 star pie with possibly the best crust I've ever had. The bartender Michael is very friendly and can answer all questions. All in all the mixed greens and cherry salad, the station pizza, and the service were all five-star"}
{"text":"Had to try the pizza Champs pie. Went for lunch and found out they have some great specials. We ordered two of the $8 1 top pizza with salad and drink.  Awesome deal! You get and 8-9 pie that is hot fresh and bubbly cheese.   The salad was great. Nice bit of spring mix perfectly dressed with halved grape tomatoes and slivered purple onion. The dressing which I am assuming is house made ranch, was very good.  The Pizza also was very good. A real hand toss dough with a light tomato sauce with real mozz cheese, no fillers here. The cup n char pepperoni was perfect and I love that flavor you get from this topping when the edges start burning and curling up. AWESOME!!!   Overall great food experience. Service on this visit was ok. Nothing spectacular. I felt ignored for a while but the place was pretty empty. I WILL be back soon to explore the menu more."}
{"text":"Been hearing about Pizza Rock downtown and this place run by same owners. Just opened, lots of choices of pizzas. Had margarita, small size, tasty topping. Very interesting crust, the bottom was crunchy and stayed like that, never had one like it before. It was good, not the best. Warning: buffalo wings extremely spicy! Had to take of most of the sauce, it was burning and hard to eat. Think beer bottles are overpriced at 7 dollars for Rogue. Service was good, very attentive."}
{"text":"Food was delish but service was a little poor. Ordered the Calamari Fritti, Hand cut fries with Parmigiano, Pancetta and Honey as our antipasti. These were both awesome! The fries were different and delicious! Onto our entree's, we got Chicken Fettuccini Alfredo, Lasagna Bolognese and a 13' Chicago Cast Iron 'Old Chicago' Pizza. We each enjoyed our dishes. The portion we fairly large, so we for sure had leftovers. Overall, food is goooood! We would come back again! Thanks Little Tony's!!"}
{"text":"Came here a few visits back because of a Groupon we purchased.  Has been a regular stop ever since.  My wife is Sicilian and makes pizza all the time.  Hers is only second to Nonna's pizza.  This style of pizza is unfamiliar to most.  At Little Tony's, it was close.  The thin crest with fresh authentic toppings is what we like.  Their pies are the real deal.  If we want \"real\" pizza when in Vegas, this is the place.  We have tried most of their specialty pizza's with the NY styles being our favourites.  At home, we rarely head out for thin crust pizza b/c we make it home.  But in Vegas, we head here."}
{"text":"Great food. Was with a large group and everyone liked their food. The pizza was outstanding as was the service."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great service! Michigan Thin Crust Pizza, Caprese Salad, and Tiramisu are delish! We ordered the Dillinger Pizza, sounded better on the menu than eating it. I would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Just paying our bill...first time...sooo good...cute atmosphere...lots of TVs to catch the sports...yet subtle music...good lighting and yummy fresh food! The Caprese salad was big enough for two and delish...as was the appetizer garlic bread...we both had pizza and it was bursting with freshness...parm cheese on the table...love that! And our server, Marcus was so hospitable...we would come back just for him. So, in a nutshell...food and service were beyond refreshing!!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza. Great service from our server Paul, and best of all a huge whiskey selection!"}
{"text":"Excellent service food everything!! Closest pizza to Chicago we have found yet since we moved here"}
{"text":"Really bummed about this one.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE Pizza Rock and Capo's. With that said, I don't so much LOVE LOVE LOVE Little Tony's. We were seated right away, for a table of 10, and the hostess/bartender/waitress (all the same person) was very friendly and accommodating. But, because she was what appeared to be the only server (aside from the busgirl) present or working that night the service was really slow. The food was flavorful, but luke warm (maybe because it sat at the kitchen window for too long waiting to be delivered to our table?). But, what really sealed the rating for us was the fact that not one, not two, but 5 plates on our table and/or served to us were dirty. One of the plates even came with a piece of dried pepperoni attached to it. When we asked the busgirl to bring us some clean plates, and noted the dried piece of pepperoni on one of our plates, her reaction was almost like she was being put out and she certainly didn't seem fazed that the plates were dirty. Not sure we would return. We can get better service from Tony's other restaurants, so why chance this place again?"}
{"text":"We ordered the Newyorker and it was great! The mozzarella added a mild flavor to the thin crust pizza."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken Alfredo. My husband got their pasghetti & meatballs.. Food was ok our waiter was extremely friendly & helpful.. However prices were way to high for such a casual place. Chicken was good but somewhat dry.. Spaghetti was good but not enough meatballs. No soup or salad came with our meal like most places..our meals were like $15 each.. Way overpriced."}
{"text":"Back again the night before Super Bowl with.my old Friends ..... of course the Spaghetti - Chianti - Meatballs Still .... Are The Best !!!"}
{"text":"Had came to Palace Station for The Oyster Bar, but the line/wait was just too long and we were on a time crunch to catch our Book of Mormon show in downtown.  So it was pretty much between pizza or the Chinese fast food next door.  It was about 11AM and the place was pretty much empty other than another couple and a solo diner... I guess it was too early for pizza for everyone else.  Not for me though!!  We ordered the Chicago style deep dish... I forget the name, but its the one with ricotta and meatballs.  Also to make me feel less guilty, I also ordered the caprese salad. The waiter had quoted about a half hour wait for the deep dish pizza to be ready as the dough takes a while to cook.  And exactly at the half hour mark our pizza came out.    I'll start with the meh.  Caprese salad, not that it was disgusting, but it was probably the most boring and least tasty of caprese salads I have ever had.  I was expecting beautiful, juicy tomatoes on a bed of salad greens (the menu said there was greens) with creamy mozzarella layered in between.  No, there no real substantial bites of tomatoes, but more greens and peppers in the salad.  The mozzarella was bland and just blah.  Yes, blah, thats the word that comes to mind when I think of their caprese, blah.  Deep dish pizza came out piping hot, with a tasty, crispy crust.  Better than BJs deep dish, reminiscent of Golden Boy in SF.  One slice and I was full.  I wish the meatballs weren't sliced so thin as they got kind of lost with the sauce and everything else.  Ooey gooey cheese, theres no such thing as too much cheese in my book, especially if it's ooey gooey!  We weren't able to finish the pizza, so ended up taking the rest of it back to our hotel room.  Usually, I love cold pizza, hot, cold.. makes no difference to me!  However, this style isn't the type that can be enjoyed cold like your regular crust pizzas, so that was a bummer.    Overall, I'd come back for their pizza and a different salad next time.    ***I have never tried authentic Chicago style deep dish pizza before, so I have nothing to compare this to!****"}
{"text":"this is easily the worst chicken parmesan ever! it was cold, not cooked through, no cheese on it, then it came out in a box, even though we never asked for it to go. Then, it was cold once it got put back on a plate.  I may go back, but never for any pasta, i would recommend strongly NOT to order any chicken dish there, and when you order, you MUST ask for water, and be sure and tell the bartender girl that it is NOT to go, the place was almost empty, and I can understand why"}
{"text":"Food was excellent, pizza is definitely unique and was staff extremely friendly, especially John! We will be back"}
{"text":"Fantastic place for a decent weekend lunch.   Stopped in for the first time around noon on a Saturday and grabbed an order of Spicy Calamari and a 9\" pepperoni pizza.   The calamari was fresh and lightly fried alongside thin slices of Friggitello peppers (what most folks call pepperoncini). A wedge of lemon and a nice spicy marinara are served alongside.   The pepperoni pizza was nice and cheesy with a great tasting crust."}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza and a haven for those who are whiskey connoisseurs. Extremely great service and awesome decor of a speak easy feel"}
{"text":"Here with a Living Social coupon. The restaurant itself is nice, old style Italian. Located next to the food court in the back of a getto casino. The California pizza I order was pretty good. (I'm a pizza aficionado) . 4 stars for the food. 4 stars for the restaurant and the service. 2 stars for the location."}
{"text":"Good pizza. I would not recommend the caesar salad until they make it a little more tasty (anchovies perhaps?) and use croutons that are not as hard as a piece of wood"}
{"text":"Aaron was a great bartender. Jansey was amazing with her service; made me feel at home and gave me everything I needed. I thought that the service stopped there, but then this server Fred killed it too. My friends offered me a free room at the Bellagio, yet I stayed with Palace Station due to Little Tony's! My only negative is that the management seemed over-bearing. I spent a week at this hotel and was at this place every day studying for a test. I had seen in more that several occasions people that I only assume were managers, chastise employees (in front of costumers). Not only is that unprofessional, but the openly vocal reprimands didn't seem accurate or acceptable. At least not from my perspective."}
{"text":"New Yorker pizza is awesome as usual.  Fettuccini Alfredo for the kiddos and a plain basil pizza all washed down with Stella Artois.  A nice and easy after work dinner spot"}
{"text":"Most amazing Pizza I've had here.  Old town Chicago Pizza is amazing and will not be disappointed.  Cute and super polite waiter/bartender to boot. He's a keeper and gives good recommendations."}
{"text":"Excellent service, prices, atmosphere. The pizza was delicious, with generous ingredients, and the meat was good quality. The sauce and crust were also excellent.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Just left there and had to write a review! Kash was amazing! He was very attentive and probably one of the best servers I have encountered during my visit here in Las Vegas. He ALWAYS had a smile on his face and made sure our waters were filled. My Boyfriend and Kash had some small talk about the baseball game that was on, and even recommended clubs we should attend during our stay. We will definitely be back! Kash is beyond amazing! Oh yeah, and the food was pretty spot on. Everything during our meal was amazing. Stop by and thy this place out!"}
{"text":"First, a little background. We eat out every single night, bar none, and know almost every restaurant in Las Vegas. And, we are Chairman players at Station Casinos, and eat in their restaurants very frequently.  We tried LT shortly after they opened. The food was good (not great), and despite the fact that there were only 3 occupied tables, no manager ever visited our table. There were several issues with the kitchen, but it was new and we let it go.  Tonight, we tried LT again. Nothing has changed. There continue to be issues with the kitchen, among other things. After water glasses sitting empty, and after being told that water was coming, we eventually had to go up to the bar and ask for water ourselves. How embarrassing.  We ordered a large Caprese salad, which was quite good (it better be good for that price). We also ordered a white pizza, which was OK. And, we ordered a Chicken Parm dinner, which was NOT OK at all. It doesn't even come with pasta! So that was an extra $3 for pasta. We asked for half marinara/half Alfredo sauce, and that was an extra charge, too.   When our salad came out, we asked for some time to eat it before the pizza and parm came out. We were told they would take 15-20 minutes (perfect!). But the chicken came out alone, without the pasta, without the pizza, in less than 5 minutes. We asked if they could keep it warm until we finished the salad, but in literally 2 minutes, it was back, this time being delivered by a clueless manager named Sabrina. We tried to tell her that it was just sent back to be kept warm, but she was so confused and defensive, and frankly, totally uncaring. So it went it back again, only to come back a couple of minutes later, this time with the pasta underneath the chicken. And there was no Alfredo sauce to be found until 5 minutes later, when it came out separately in a small bowl.  We were told that pasta would be served in a square dish, but it came out underneath the chicken. And this cost extra.  Our server, Marcus, had an excellent personality and must have been frustrated by the lack of support from the manager, as well as the numerous deficiencies from the kitchen. How could this manager not back him up? Who wouldn't be frustrated by this absolute failure of management? Poor guy.  I tried to talk to Sabrina, but she could not have possibly cared less what I had to say. I tried to explain myself, to let her know that we were very engaged in the local restaurant scene, but she was having none of it, just defending herself by stating how long she was in the restaurant business. Instead of welcoming my feedback, she was so annoyed that I dared even to talk to her.  After knowing all the issues that occurred, she never came back to our table. Not once. She never apologized. She never offered us even a cup of coffee. Nothing. She walked past us several times with her nose in the air (both literally and figuratively).  And, we never saw her approach even a single table to check on anyone in the dining room. Maybe she just couldn't handle the truth.  After we finished eating, we sat for a while, and Sabrina had lots of opportunities to come back, to check on us, to make things right. She did none of it. She knowingly and intentionally let us leave unhappy.  Frankly, she is an embarrassment to Tony's good name, and a total misfit for this restaurant. Tony did not get where he is today by allowing such unprofessional managers to represent him. I hope he gets wise and cuts her before this new restaurant, with so much potential, crashes and burns.  We will try it again, maybe for the third time, or maybe for the last time. And we will be absolutely certain to report back here what we experience."}
{"text":"The caprese salad was yummy & the basalmic dressing outstanding! The mozzerella and pepedew peppers took it up a notch. We also had the ranch pizza, hawaiian (don't think it's called that) & a pepperoni/ sausage pizza. Loved them all! My favorite was the ranch! We had some extra dressing to dip the crusts in.  Our waiter (also the bartender) was wonderful. Friendly, attentive & knowledgable. Did not expect much inside Palace Station, but this place hit it out of the park!"}
{"text":"The first time I dined here my pizza was very good though them charging me to substitute toppings was very odd and our server, Kash, was good about checking on us and refilling our drinks. I came back a few months later and noticed the menu was different, so I asked about it. I can't remember my servers name this time, but she was very sweet and let me know that the restaurant still says \"Little Tony's\" even though it's now owned by Station Casinos. She said that's why the menu had changed and even though they were still attempting to make the Cal Italia and Dillinger (I assume with Tony's permission) several other items like the Salami and Cheese Board, several pastas, the Caprese House Special (made with house made hand-pulled mozzarella) and honestly too many other items to mention are no longer available on the menu. It still says Tony Gemignani on the website for the restaurant, so I really have no idea what's going on lol. The menu was certainly different on my last visit and the food was absolutely different even in size.   Mozzarella Sticks ($7) - This came with 7  sticks, a side of sauce and was very good. Too bad it was no longer on the menu anymore when I went back!   Sausage with Peppers ($12) - Hubby ordered this and I naturally tried it. Very tasty and they didn't skimp on the sausage with there being a whole one on top and then a bunch of sliced sausage underneath. Again, too bad it was no longer on the menu when I went back.  New Yorker ($10) - Tomato Sauce, Mozzarella, Sliced House-Made Sausage, Pepperoni, Ricotta, Garlic, Oregano, Oil. This pizza tasted great! I did notice that it was still on the menu when I went back however my server told me it could only be ordered now in the 16 inch size instead of the personal size I had ordered before. Crazy! I did ask them to substitute the sliced sausage for meatballs and was very surprised when the bill came to see they not only charged me $3 for the meatballs, but charged me $2 for sausage that was supposed to come on the pizza to begin with and I didn't even get. When I asked about it I was told that they sometimes have to charge for substituting certain items. I don't get it and felt ripped off regardless of the pizza tasting so good.  Personal Cheese Pizza ($6.99) - This is the pizza I experienced on my second visit when I found out Stations took over Little Tony's. Huge difference in the size of the pizza. I couldn't believe how small it was compared to not only before, but come on it was like 2 or 3 bites for each slice. The pizza tasted good, but wasn't anything special. Price was cheap, but it's not worth it in my opinion compared to what I had from here previously. I don't think this restaurant should have the same name if it can't maintain consistency as well menu items previously offered."}
{"text":"We love this place!  We came for the pizza and were not disappointed in the slightest!  Absolutely love the Cal Italia and no visit to Little Tony's is complete with out their meatball appetizers.  Service was on point and the atmosphere was comfy like a Italian family restaurant from back home in NY.  It's a Pizza Rock fix close to the strip with a home setting.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Pretty good spot with great service.  We had the Don Giovanni pizza (white pie with mozzarella, prosciutto, arugula, parmigiano, peppadew peppers, and goat cheese) and the Brooklyn calzone (mozzarella, spinach, ricotta, and garlic).     The pizza and the calzone were good and well made, but nothing to get \"foodie\" excited about. The cheese was pretty good quality, but if the ingredients were higher quality, I probably would have given them 4 stars.    Prices are reasonable and they have a great drink and food happy hour 3-6pm, and then 9-close, 7 days a week.    Our waitress was very friendly and polite.   This spot is under 3 miles from the strip, so well worth a quick Uber trip."}
{"text":"Had dinner here for the first time. Food was great, calamari was excellent as was my lasagna. Our server Chris was very accommodating and knowledgeable too."}
{"text":"Update to my review.   Still an excellent pizza the service BLOWS NOW!  Twice in a row, and there won't be an opportunity for a third unless it is take out.  It is seat yourself, their isn't enough staff, they are rude and you won't get anything that you ask for unless you get up to go get it. We waited 20 minutes on change after 15 minutes on a box and the check and asking twice. A dinner that should have taken an hour or so took over two and us missing a show we had planned to attend!"}
{"text":"Little Tony's is pretty bomb!  I found this place by accident via Yelp (after my travel buddies wanted food options for Vietnamese or Italian cuisines).  We settled on Little Tony's due to its nearest distance to our next destination of the night.  Now that I'm writing this review, I find out that this place is owned by Tony Gemignani (known as the World Pizza Cup Champion).  Link - http://www.tonygemignani.com/  This place is still listed on Tony Gemignani's website, but Yelp reviews have noted that the restaurant is now managed by Palace Station Hotel & Casino, so the quality has not really remained the same.  Little Tony's is a hidden gem in the Palace Station Hotel & Casino.  Between myself and my travel buddies, we tried the following: - New Yorker Pizza - with tomato sauce, mozzarella, sliced house-made sausage, pepperoni, ricotta, garlic, oregano, oil  (New York / New Haven style - 16\" pizza) - Spaghetti and Meatballs Pasta - with marinara and parmesan - House Special Salad - family size - with mixed greens, mushrooms, tomato, olives, pepperoncini, red onion, salami, mozzarella, and house dressing  Large portions!!  Perfect for 3 very hungry fitness addicts!!  We each also ordered a drink (beer / wine) and our total bill with tip was less than $20 per person.  Definitely will be returning when back in Las Vegas!  Loved this place.  ENJOY!!"}
{"text":"Food: Great Service: Not  Food is fine, the atmosphere was relaxing. Our server forgot to bring out napkins and silverware. Granted most people eat pizza with their hands. I had the bourbon bbq pizza. Having a napkin and silverware at the ready would be a nice option.   The floor directly beside where I was sitting, needed to be mopped ! Quite a few times staff members, including management  walked directly over the dirty floor. The floor was dirty before we were seated.  Just not acceptable."}
{"text":"Palace station now you have 2 bomb eateries in you. Found this place on groupon, wow. So impressed. Excellent cust service from the moment my wife and baby stepped in. Nice waiters, hipster bartender made great drinks and the Dillenger pizza ... Best Ive ever had and Im a man who loves my piZza. Will def be back. They have 1 big screen at the bar, great for watching games. The best"}
{"text":"Excellent for when you are in the mood for a pizza fix! It's hard to find decently priced pizza, that is good quality, near the Strip, so I was happy to try out this gem. Less chaotic than Pizza Rock in terms of the menu items, so they do everything they offer very well. Enjoyed the selections we made and would like to come back and try some more in the near future.  Almost forgot the rundown! We purchased three 9\" pies for four guys at lunch and we were satisfied.  - The Bronx (9\") - $11 - Pepperoni (9\") - $9 - Picante (9\") - $11  Came out to $33 with the Local's Discount!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Better then I thought.. I had mozzarella sticks with marinara sauce and house salad for dinner. The mozzarella sticks were great.. it had enough cheese and when you bit into it.. cheese didn't squirt out from the other end. The marinara sauce was delicious. I had the house salad for $4.99 and it was fresh with right amount of everything. It was a little heavy on the dressing, but over all good. Customer service was good and the restaurant was clean. Next time I come I want to try their pizza."}
{"text":"The food here was really delish - but the service not so much.  We ordered the meatballs and then the Dillinger. Meatballs and sauce were super easy as was the Dillinger, although if we had been able to read on the menu that it would take 40 minutes we may have opted for something else. It looked as if they had a manager and 1 bartender on duty. But the barman didn't really seem to know his stuff and was very slow...I have no problem waiting for a drink but I watched 2 older women wait at the bar to place their food and beverage order for at least 15-20 minutes while the server/bartender chatted away with a young woman next to us (maybe his girlfriend?). My husband and I will probably come back some time to try their other items, but maybe not at lunch time."}
{"text":"Great price awesome food. The pizza is awesome its owned by the same company as \"Pizza Rock\" in downtown which is always packed out because its so awesome. Little Tony's has the same great food and quality and the atmosphere is a little quieter which makes it nice if you're trying to get into a great pizza place on weekend. I recommend it highly. The service is great and the price is fair.   The only reason that I'm not giving it 5 stars is because its located in the Palace Station Casino and the management of that property is unprofessional and the hotel is disgusting. If you're staying at the palace station this place may just make up for the flaws the hotel has... just maybe but those run deep."}
{"text":"I like that this place is owned by the Pizza Rock guy. The menu is less elaborate but the prices are better.  We usually sit at the bar abd get pretty decent service, which was the case this time. The traditional-style caesar was a delicious start, and a deal for $5. We had the spaghetti and meatballs. It was a little watery (probably wasn't drained enough), but the overall flavors were spot-on. Yummy sauce, and the meatballs were tender and flavorful. We also had the New Yorker pizza, extra crispy. It was well put together and cooked perfectly. Loved the fresh dabs of ricotta cheese. Pretty solid choice for pizza, pasta, etc."}
{"text":"Went here with the Fiancee and I haven't laughed so much in my life. That's a good thing though.   The most unfortunate thing about Little Tony's is that it's nestled inside Palace Station. A cool hip pizza joint in the middle of a depressing casino. It's a shame really. It's just like WuHu noodle house being in the Silverton. Not something you expect.  We were seated immediately as the Palace Station faithful were not crowding the restaurant on this night. This is where the night went from good to amazing.  Ordered an IPA and when our server (Mike, which I've been told 3 Mikes work there, but was assured that all the Mikes were friendly) totally biffs it and spills the beer on the empty part of the booth (we did not get spilled on). He immediately picks it up and plays it off. He starts wafting the air and says something to the effect of, \"the aroma is really going to add something to your dinner.\" He cracked us up the rest of the night.   I was sold on this place. Our server became the coolest guy in the world. We talked to him most of the night and he was probably the funniest, nicest server I've ever had.   Oh right, the food!  The food was just as good as the service.  WHISKEY WINGS. That's the jam. Mike warned us about the wings. These are wet wings with a heat bite that sneaks up on you. Your scalp will be sweating in no time with these wings. Pain was worth it.  Ordered two pizzas, the Picante and the Tartufo. The Picante is a spicy pizza with both serrano and banana peppers with Cholula hot sauce on it as well. This heat does not sneak up on you as much. It's either you take a bite and it's fine or you get a bite and your mouth is on fire. It was more complicated than just being hot though. It had a ton of flavors going on and the heat added a nice kick.   The Tartufo was the opposite. A more culinary refined pizza with truffle oil, Italian goat cheese and Prosciutto De Parma. This was our server's recommended suggestion. It was a great pizza that you wouldn't necessarily think was a great pizza. Definitely a must have.  I had a great meal with an unintentional show. This is worth the trek through the Palace Station."}
{"text":"Totally overpriced and the food is not worth it.  Had the 3 Cheese Burger.  No flavor to the meat.  The bun was tasty and so were the rosemary garlic fries.  We also ordered the Chicken & Shrimp Alfredo.  Did not taste like an alfredo sauce.  Actually had no flavor whatsoever."}
{"text":"Actually went to Palace Station to go to the Oyster Bar, which came highly recommended by my cousin who lives in Vegas.  When we got there however, they told me it was only 21 and over, and I had my two kids.    Without a backup plan, we decided to eat at Little Tony's which was in the same casino.  It was a total gamble without doing any research, not to mention it was relatively empty.  We ended up ordering garlic bread, Caesar salad and a pizza.  The garlic bread was perfect, fresh garlic, a little cheese and parsley.  Perfectly crisp on the outside, and soft and chewy inside -- I could have just eaten that.  Caesar salad is a salad we sort of use to gauge authenticity at Italian restaurants these days.  This salad was perfectly dressed, good amount of anchovy flavor without being fishy.  Fresh slices of Parmesan.  It was better when I added a squirt of lemon, but really a great Caesar.    Pizza had a great thin crust, just a little burnt like we like it.  A little crisp, not soggy.  Great toppings, sauce has hint of sweetness, but good.    Decor wise it was classy, Italian sports bar theme, with some nice  HD TV's showing sports, which we are always a fan of.    This place blew me away to be honest, we got really lucky.  It was a miracle we were even at that casino, and to find such a great Italian spot...wow.  My only regret is I didn't get to try the spaghetti or lasagna, another gauge of a true Italian restaurant, but especially since I hear they make their own pasta.  Anyway...great spot here off the strip.  Even better than Grimaldi's. Highly recommended for good Italian food!"}
{"text":"Since I still haven't properly tried Pizza Rock, or any of his other restaurants for that matter, this was my introduction to the cuisine of the famous Tony Gemignani. It was certainly a good first impression.  With a rapidly expiring Groupon to my name, I arranged to meet a couple of friends here for an early dinner. While I was waiting for them, I noticed that it was the tail end of happy hour. Upon inquiry, the host informed me that they do honor happy hour pricing for Groupons. This unexpected surprise bode well for the night.  After my friends arrived, we got seated. We were shown to a booth, having been indecisive with the choice between that and a table. This was great. I felt comfortable because of the cushions below and behind me, but they were actually very unobtrusive. Moral of the story: go for a booth if you can.  I appreciated the decor, with the retro faux brick walls and the clean, modern black table tops meshing well, and the good lighting allowing us to eat with our eyes first (and take photos of course). They have plenty of TVs and they were almost all tuned to the Thursday night NFL game, which was a nice plus for two of us fantasy football managers.  Anyway, I seem to have digressed a little. The food was great, and stacking discounts made money a forgotten issue at the meal went on. (Quick note: I didn't go for the alcohol tonight, but during happy hour, well drinks are $3, draft beers and wine by the glass are $2 off, and specialty cocktails are $3 off.)  We definitely ordered every happy hour appetizer, and then some. The Classic Meatballs ($3 HH for 3 meatballs) were moist, tender, and savory, with a nice pool of sweet tomato sauce lending more flavor but not covering up the meat at all. The Calamari Fritti ($5), which we had in a traditional style, came with a marinara sauce and a spicy calabrese sauce, the latter of which was the more interesting of the two even if it was starting to edge into too-spicy-for-me territory. The Garlic-Garlic bread with cheese ($5) was tasty in the super-cheesy middle sections, but got a little boring at the ends.  I think I had the most mixed feelings about the Italian Fries ($3) They have four different types of fries, and although we skipped the Truffle fries and Gorgonzola fries, we did go for the Rosemary Garlic fries and Honey Pancetta Parmagiano fries. I'm a little sad to say that, although the fries are nicely crunchy outside and fluffy inside, they're clearly under-seasoned. The Rosemary Garlic fries merely have ketchup to help cover up this flaw, and I left those alone after a few bites. However, I really liked the other variety because the honey, pancetta, and parmesan stacked sweet, smoky, and savory flavors (note: add more cheese from the parmesan dispenser if necessary). I just wish that the foundation was solid.  Because 9\" pizzas were $2 off for Happy Hour, we felt more comfortable sampling different varieties instead of going straight to the higher value 16\" pizzas. My choice of the New Yorker ($8 HH), per another friend's recommendation, was a nice meaty pizza with pepperoni, sausage, and dollops of ricotta on which I probably should have used a knife to spread out a little. The ricotta definitely added an unexpected dimension. The Tartufo ($10 HH), a white pizza, had some nice touches from the light truffle oil and goat cheese, although I would have liked just a bit more prosciutto. The Quatro Formaggio ($8 HH) was a nice combination that didn't have me missing the cheese at all, aside from the rather pronounced crust on the edge. Speaking of which, I never skip the crust anyway, but the dough was delicious on all of the pizzas - crispy and crunchy in just the right amounts.  I should also mention that our server was friendly and engaging from the moment we entered the restaurant, building a nice rapport at least with my more sociable friend. He had a nice sense of humor and wasn't too intrusive, haughty, or whatever issues you might have. He even left me something interesting on my phone when he borrowed it to run the Groupon voucher... nah, just kidding on that. It was a nice joke though.  It wasn't perfect in every way, but my experience at Little Tony's left me wanting to return, especially for the fries with honey and pancetta. And the excellent meatballs, of course. Actually, I should finally check out Pizza Rock now since its Green Valley Ranch location is closer to me. Besides, it's probably gonna be a while until the next Groupon."}
{"text":"This is in the Palace Station.  The food is outstanding.  There are no sides so if you want garlic bread it is extra.  The portions are BIG.  You will not leave hungry.  I ordered the lasagna with Alfredo sauce.  It was Devine.  Howard had the chicken parmesan.  He devoured it. The pizza looked and smelled wonderful.  I ordered Tony's Tiramisu, Malibu rum infused lady fingers, shaved valrhona chocolate, showered in frangelico.  Yummy!  Run don't walk to eat here.  You will love it."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town and stumbled upon Little Tony's via yelp, and I'm glad we did.  We started off with the meatballs which were cooked perfectly and the sauce was delicious.   Our table then shared The Dillinger, which is everything I wanted it to be, and we also shared the Frank Niti, which was a beautiful/yummy pizza that the vegetarians at our table could enjoy. The entire staff was super friendly (each of them thanked us on our way out), and the establishment was squeaky clean. There's no reason for me not to give them 5 stars. Can't wait to come back and try more."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was nice. Food was yummy. Order was a little messed up, overall waitress was friendly though. Would give it a second try..."}
{"text":"Since posting my first review, I have been back 3 times.  Instead of pizza, we order the meatball and sausage calzones and they are delicious."}
{"text":"Been to pizza rock, and really liked it, but we hate going downtown, so we wanted to try little tonys, because its the same owner and the food is the same , and closer to our house, its in palace station casino, which is kinda weird, its not the best place for it, but  we really wanted to try a different pizza so we didn't mind, don't let it scare you off that the place is not busy, we went for lunch, they have booths and tables, we got a comfy booth,  there was only one server, but only one was needed at that time, he was great, and since we have eatin at pizza rock we already knew what appetizers we wanted, we got the meatballs, the SAUCE IS AMAZING!! and we got truffle French fries, I got them well done because I had gotten the gorgonzola fries at pizza rock and they were soggy, so these turned out perfect.  and then for lunch we got the station pizza, had red sauce, with lots of different meats and veggies on it,  it was  a fairly thin crust, but it held up well to all the toppings, and they don't skimp on the toppings,  but the pizza's range about 20 and up depending on what kind you get. they have deep dish as well, so give this place a go, you wont be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place is maybe a little shy of 5 stars. Great service. I was very surprised how tasty everything was. The meatballs app was awesome. Me and my gf ordered a few pizzas to try. I was very impressed with the station pizza. It was basically like a supreme pizza with a ton of toppings. Not too heavy and the sauce was not too acidic. I would say just right actually. Cal Italia was good too, but I liked the first pizza better. Had bread pudding for dessert and it was pretty good too. I would come back and try more pizzas, it's a good selection and great quality."}
{"text":"If you happen to find yourself in Palace Station, then go here!  I love Pizza Rock, so I expected to enjoy this place and I did. A bonus is that you are able to get smaller versions of their pizzas here.   The Whiskey Wings are right up my alley. I love saucy wings that are a mixture of bbq and spicy. Total personal preference and I really dug them. Also came with a side of blue cheese which is always how I consume wings.   Ordered the picante and the tartufo pizzas. Really enjoyed the fun flavor combos of both and the crust had a nice char on both of them. I would say that I liked the tartufo a little better because I am not a fan of sausage and the spicy sausage on the picante pizza was too greasy for my taste.   Only complaint is that I wish they had more beers on tap, although they have a large bottle/can selection to make up for it.   The service here was fantastic. We always had people checking in on us. Our server, Mike, had us laughing the entire time."}
{"text":"We read the Yelp reviews and bought a Groupon coupon to give it a try on our trip to LV. It is in the Palace Station Hotel/Casino.  We ate a late lunch/early dinner at 5 pm on a Tuesday and we had our choice of tables.  From the Yelp reviews we decided we had to try the meatball appetizer.  5 STARS.   3 large meat balls for $5 and the sauce was mopped up by the bowl of fresh bread.  So good.  My wife is an Egg Plant Parmesan snob.  She rated this as the best she's had in years.  The waiter recommended a side of pasta and sauce as the entrée is a la carte.  The pasta was equally delicious.   5 STARS.   Where we had a departure from perfection was with the Chicago style pizza.  Ordered a Michigan Ave. pizza which had 3 cheeses and house made pepperoni, tomato sauce and a deep dish crust.  All of the toppings; sauce, pepperoni and cheese were wonderful but the crust on the bottom was probably 7/8 inch thick and so overwhelmed the toppings the pizza seemed dry.   We wish we'd have ordered a NY style.  The pepperoni is apparently homemade and is peppery and wonderful.  3 STARS.   The service for drinks was very slow when there wasn't food being brought out.  The thick pizza took 30 min. and our drinks were dry for 20 min. after the appetizers.  The casino atmosphere is not optimal but the restaurant itself is very nice, quiet and tastefully decorated.  They have a sister restaurant - Pizza Rock in old LV a block north of Fremont."}
{"text":"I love this place the food is amazing the vibe is awesome!!! My servers chris and Amber were great! Also the bar staff was excellent!!!"}
{"text":"Reviews are opinions and this opinion is bay an Italian New Yorker living in Las Vegas. After 5 years I have given up trying to satisfy my palette with a great pizza. Instead I amuse myself by gambling on those opinions and editorials I read in local publications. All in all I can recommend better places to get a bad pizza!  My expectations at Little Tony's was low and I was not disappointed. Out of 3 pizza's ordered only one was cooked correctly. My pizza had a relatively thin crust and the dough was cooked. The other two pizza's we sampled  were thick crust when it said it would be thin, but worse then that they were both under cooked. There was nothing to WOW about as far as pizza is concerned. Service added to the bad taste in our mouths and when a manager stays away from your table because they know they didn't represent the restaurant well, Then you know why at lunch time there were only 3 tables occupied. Try Russo's where an Sicilian makes the pizza right in front of your eyes! (PS he's off on Tuesdays)"}
{"text":"Found this gem from Groupon! Amazing food and service. Homemade marinara sauce, pizza dough, bread..everything! A sister company of Pizza Rock. We had the Margarita pizza, spinach and artichoke dip with sourdough garlic bread, whiskey bbq chicken wings, lasagna, and shrimp fettuccine Alfredo. The service was also great. Always topped off our drinks asked if we were okay and friendly. Definitely a must try! We'll be going back!"}
{"text":"Delicious place inside the palace station casino. The meatballs are great, must get when visiting. The bbq pizza had a unique flavor. Overall this place is great to visit if nearby."}
{"text":"My first time eating here so I ordered a few things. The meatballs are about a 5-6 on a scale of 1-10. No taste at all. Pizza is about a 7.  Spaghetti and meatballs is about a 5. Prices are pretty cheap but I now know why. Everything is bland...reminds me of prison food. I'll never be back. Refusing to pay for the spegetti and meatballs."}
{"text":"This place is great!! My daughter's soccer team came into town for a tournament and I was looking for a place to accommodate about 40 people.  I googled/called around and found this place.  It's located in the Palace Station although it's not a straight shot to get to once in the hotel since it is smack in the middle of the casino but easy enough to find.  The place isn't huge but it has a capacity of about 75-100 people and it has a very open feel with the high ceilings. It has a full bar which the parents were happy about, according to a parent, Aaron, the bartender, was excellent and his pours were spot on.  The atmosphere is very casual and the look is a stereotypical Italian pizza joint.   The food is plentiful and tasty.  Good enough variety of pizza and pasta on the menu that don't overwhelm you like some other places. The service was excellent and attentive. Our waitress did a great job catering to our group of 40 and on top of that was able to do separate checks for each family, which can be hard.  The manager, Wayne, was great to deal with.  I made the reservations with him a week ahead and he called me to confirm the day of the dinner.  So overall, our team's experience was great.  If you have a big group and want a place to dine in Vegas, Little Tony's is the place to go and ask for Wayne, he'll hook you up."}
{"text":"had a groupon for $50, went with buddy to try it out sat a bar, was actually happy hour, great deal on top of our groupon!  started with calamari, was ok, would probably pass on it next time also had meatballs, a bargain at a buck apiece! thought they were pretty good, will come back for them again can make a meal out of them and a few beers!  my buddy had the lasagna, said was pretty good I had sausage and peppers, was happy with that dish too!  unfortunately the meatballs and calamari were pretty filling (in addition to a few beers!) so ended up boxing sausage and peppers for lunch next day  guess this place replace the old pasta palace, which was no loss.... saw few other people taking advantage of groupon or living social deal too! many sat at bar and had pizza, which I will have to try next visit ....only so much you can eat in a visit!  in any case, when the line is too long at oyster bay, this place definitely worth a shot! appreciated them accepting groupon for happy hour too! thanks guys, look forward to next visit!"}
{"text":"I wanted to try Little Tony's based on Yelp reviews and one in the local paper.  I wasn't so sure I was going to be a fan because, unlike other Yelpers, we weren't as blown away by Tony's flagship restaurant, Pizza Rock, on Fremont.  But we were pleasantly surprised.  Loved the fact that they were open late, and also that there was a Happy Hour in progress, so we saved a few bucks on our drinks and food.   I had the St. Anthony 9\" pizza, a white pie with mozzarella and sweet sausage, red peppers, ricotta, and basil.  It had quite a kick to it, and I loved it.  The wonderful surprise was that it was CRISP, which was my complaint with the soggy Cal Italia pizza I'd had downtown.  Our terrific and friendly server, Alexis, explained why Little Tony's does a crispier job with the 9\" pizzas.  It was filling, too, so I managed to eat only half. It made a great breakfast the next morning!  Hubby, remembering how much he enjoyed the meatballs at Pizza Rock, ordered a four-bagger - for $4 HH price! - and a side of veggies to put them on top of.  And since he'll be fending for himself while I hit the road, he ordered another portion to stick in the freezer.  Alas, it was the end of the culinary road, and only three remained in the kitchen, so they were gifted to us.  I tried to take pictures of my beautiful pizza, the big bowl of veggies, and the warm and inviting atmosphere, but as it happens way too often, Yelp was \"a bit funky right now,\" and I couldn't post or even save them to my phone.    But there'll be a next time, and I hope to be able to capture them then."}
{"text":"Little Tony's has a nice ambiance and a nice variety on the menu. Very friendly and professional service as well."}
{"text":"Went there for a quick lunch & it didn't disappoint. We ordered the meat ball appetizer. WOO-HOO!!!!!!!!!!! Out came 3 huge balls & they were done to perfection!!! Tasty. Tasty. Tasty. Can't wait to go back & order the lasagna AND the balls."}
{"text":"We really enjoy the fresh menu options. The thin crust is my favorite. The cheese options are complimentary to the sauce options.  If you love Pizza Rock, this will be a favorite too!"}
{"text":"My husband and I just got done having dinner at Little Tony's it was the absolute best and our waiter Paul was such a fantastic waiter , very knowledgeable of the menu  and very helpful. It's rare to come across good service at a restaurant. Thank you Paul for the great service and hospitality we will definitely recommend little Tony's.  The Welch's"}
{"text":"Little Tony's is located inside Palace Station, in case you're trying to find it. We also found out that this is a sister restaurant to Pizza Rock from downtown (cool! We like pizza rock!)  It's a small little place, pretty cozy, but cute.  We enjoyed the El hefe on draft (from banger brewery downtown!) and started with the meatballs. Those were probably the highlight of our meal. The meatballs were delicious, made from beef, pork and veal, but that sauce really kicks them up a notch.   For our main, we shared the Dillinger pizza. It's a deep dish, topped with chicken, onion, artichoke hearts, three different cheeses (so it says, but I couldn't tell if the cheddar was on it) among other toppings, but it didn't have sauce. The first few bites were delicious, but that's about all I could have! The pizza is hugeeeee and trust me, we've had our fair share of deep dish pizzas, but after it was all said and done, we decided it was just OK. Maybe the staff hyped it up for us, maybe we believed it when it said it won best pizza in 2014 or maybe we are just being too tough on them? Either way, it wasn't our favorite.  Although, I would prefer to go to pizza rock over Little Tonys, it was fun to check out palace station for the first time."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Good pizza and nice service. Not impressed w the pasta. Calamari was good."}
{"text":"Had dinner last night with my husband after the UFC fight.  First we waited 20 minutes to be acknowledged.  We were getting ready to leave when we finally got asked for a drink.  We stayed and I wish we didn't!  We had the New York Pizza and it was the worst pizza I have ever had.  We got soup and bread to start with and that didn't even taste good.  The soup was cold and all broth with a couple of noodles and 2 beans.  The bread was sliced so thin you can see through it.  The service is horrible.  The manager came and asked how things were and we said it wasn't great and she laughed and walked away.  She looked like a slob for being a manager with jeans and a causal shirt.  The table next to us ordered a deep dish pizza and the server brought it out burnt!  She just told the people to try it.  As you can see we were not impressed with this place.  I will not be going back and I will make sure people we know don't even waste money going there!  Pretty sad when you wish you ate at McDonald's!"}
{"text":"First time here and it was towards closing. That being said, the food on this Thursday night was fair to poor, to say the least. The prime rib, broccolini, and baked potato all came out cold. I was hoping it was hot in the middle but no, cold as well. Sent everything back and it all came back out the same way. I didn't have the heart to send it back a second time. The meat had more than normal fat and cartilage. I had to wait 5-10 minutes for the creamy horseradish, which is supposed to come with the prime rib automatically. The veggies were barely cooked and the baked potato had these hardened pieces of cheddar cheese on each half. I was hoping Little Tony's would be a good option for dinner but this entire fiasco took over an hour for one person and the restaurant was empty. The waitress/bartender was very friendly and apologetic but the kitchen needs a wake up call. I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Go and get the St. Anthony Pie.  It is delicious!    I have tried many of the other pizzas and they are all good.  Room is nice and casual feel.  Good wine and beer list."}
{"text":"Since this is owned by the same people who own Pizza Rock I had to try this place out.  It's kind of odd that it's located inside Palace Station since it's not a trendy casino and which is why it took me a couple months to actually check this place out.  This restaurant is very similar to Pizza Rock and has many of the same menu items.  I had the sangria which was just meh. I wouldn't recommend it. Very sweet. I thought it would be served in a wine class but it was served in a glass you'd serve soda. I would have a beer next time instead.   I tried the meatballs and they were the same ones that you can find at Pizza Rock. They are amazing and so tender and the sauce is tasty. I would recommend trying these if you had not.   We then tried the picante pizza. Very spicy as you would think but tasty. I enjoyed it. If you enjoy food on the hot side this pizza is for you.   We then had to save room for dessert because they had a bread pudding that could not be found on the Pizza Rock menu. This was a perfect size and was great for splitting.   Overall very good but similar to Pizza Rock."}
{"text":"As our second choice to a very popular place, we opted to listen to our hunger over waiting in line for a more tasteful late lunch. Very simple menu. So simple I could have made it myself.  The service was unsatisfactory early on and decided we wouldn't order drinks. Not much else to say."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and his friend would come here every time they're in Las Vegas. They loveeeee their pizzas, so he brought me to try it out. We wanted to get two pizzas (Dillinger and Cal Italia), but it would have been too much for us. We shared a Cal Italia instead. This pizza was very interesting. I've never had anything like it. It was sweet and salty and cheesy and a whole lot of flavors dancing around. The dough was nicely cooked. Large slices of prosciutto covered the pizza topped with pieces of sweet fig preserve. They were very generous with the cheese too. A light drizzle of balsamic really helped tie all the flavors together.   I definitely will return to try the other pizza!"}
{"text":"Everything was great here food was awesome service was fast and friendly we will definitely  be coming back !!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza spot! The complementary soup is a nice touch. I ordered a Caesar salad and the Dillinger. The pizza was a beauty and absolutely worth the wait. Soooo good! I also had the tiramisu for dessert. It came in a cute mason jar but was a very thick consistency and tasted like straight sweetened condensed milk. Too sweet for me and not quite what I expect. They also have happy hour from 3-6 Monday through Friday and from 10 to close every night!"}
{"text":"Tried the Eggplant Parm w/ spaghetti & blend of tomato & alfredo sauces. Good-sized portion. Sauce was unremarkable. Eggplant was delicately fried, tasty. Pasta done al dente. Next time I think I'll try a pizza as that is what most reviewers are raving about. Joe's  root beer was a tasty, not too sweet root beer."}
{"text":"Opening caveat, I am just realizing that I need to take the Yelp categories more literally: three stars is A-OK, and that's what I'm giving Little Tony's; my previous reviews of other restaurants suffered from grade inflation....  In terms of Little Tony's, we had a perfectly good meal late last night. Service was attentive, from both the server and the manager. And prices were good: we happened to arrive late enough to benefit from the nightly happy hour from 10 p.m. until closing. In terms of food, the meatballs were FANTASTIC. Tasty and HOT (temperature-wise), with plenty of red sauce. The calamari was edible, but much too large and rubbery for my tastes. The 9\" New York-style New Yorker pie was acceptable. Too much crust and not enough gooey, mozzarella-y, tomato-y middle for me. That may be in part because when I lived in New York City, no pizza place served 9\" pies; there was always tons of middle relative to crust. Still, Little Tony's 9\" New Yorker was dry; it tasted good, but it wasn't an East Coast, tri-state area pie.  I think that's just the problem with having lived in New York City: when you leave, you judge pizzas (and bagels!) by degrees of disappointment. Eating at Little Tony's, you will leave well fed, but you will not leave thinking you've had an out-of-body-experience that landed you in New York."}
{"text":"Me and my daughter  just had a amazing late dinner at Little Tonys  . The food is wonderful and the staff is even Better !! The manager  Amber took great care of us and was very helpful and are waiter  Michael  was nice and full of good info  on the food , I ask lots of questions  when I go some place and he had the answers . I'll   be back again and again and will be letting all my friends  and family  know that when in Las Vegas  it is a must  for a good  meal   as well as a good time 5+********  !!!!!

{"text":"Little Tony's is the best kept traditional Italian secret in Vegas.  The prices are amazing!  The food is extraordinary!  Calamari is delicious!  Pizza is delicious and the mud pie is to die for!  Must have in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Best Italian cuisine I've had in years. New Yorker Pizza was delicious. Check it out at the Palace Station."}
{"text":"Tony's pizza is the best and now I get to enjoy it without having to go to Pizza Rock since I try to avoid going downtown.   I always go for the Neapolitan award winning margarita and a New Yorker...this time I went and tried the Dillinger since it got world's best pizza award. Honestly, I wasn't that impressed with it. The edges seemed a bit burnt, the toppings were a bit thinner than I expected (small thin slice of chicken breast on each slice) and I couldn't find the bacon anywhere or the artichoke hearts...did they run out? Forget? For $35 I expected a lot more but didn't want to knock the review down a star because all other times at a Tony's spot have been 5 star experiences.  The service was excellent, granted I didn't run into the lady that the other guy below had a problem with, but from the host to the waiter everything was smooth. Our server was really helpful in explaining exactly what went into making each item and what his preference was in how to enjoy them...lemon to taste on the Dillinger, parmesan in the soup, etc...  I'll be back as this place is just about as good as their Pizza Rock location...I'll just stick to the regular award winning margarita and New Yorker and pass on the Dillinger."}
{"text":"Great pizza and cold beers.  Was a good stop while traveling with kids.  Staff was very kid friendly."}
{"text":"Pizza Rock is cool, but Little Tony's is even better! I know they have the same owners, but there's just something about this little spot inside of Palace Station. Maybe it's the soft serve ice cream? They have more of a homey feel and I think the service is a bit more personalized too. Their deep dish pizza is spectacular and I've tried pizzas from NYC to Tuscany. Similar to how Oprah LOVES bread, I LOVE their pizza."}
{"text":"First time here at Little Tony's and I cannot wait to come back! Amber was our server and she was amazing! We had the Tartufo pizza, sausage and peppers , and spaghetti and clams! Everything was perfect! But most of all we were excited with the extensive whiskey/bourbon selection at the bar!"}
{"text":"Good place to get some good pizza when staying at palace station. They do have specials a 9 inch pizza with a drink for $9. You allowed one topping and the pizza is a decent size for the price. It's better than any deal on the strip. It's a thing slice pizza with a thick airy crust. It's a very good pizza."}
{"text":"Had the lasagna, Rosemary truffle fries and pizza for the family. All very tasty, service was great and atmosphere was kid friendly."}
{"text":"The 3 of us shared a Dillinger pizza today.  All I can say is WOW!  That is a great pizza and definitely worthy of the World's Best Pizza award.  There are so many flavors and they all complement one another.  Fantastic bacon wrapped crust!  The menu says they only make 10 per day, so if you get a chance, order it.  I had 2 slices and was absolutely stuffed, but it was totally worth every bite.  Very nice servers and did I mention the pizza?"}
{"text":"My second visit here and it definitely improved since my last time. Entire staff was attentive, helpful and very friendly.   I decided to skip the spaghetti and meatballs this time and get a pizza. The pizza and meatballs were delish and were included on the happy hour menu."}
{"text":"Our server was extremely friendly and attentive. He made sure to check on us throughout the meal.   The pizzas were pretty tasty, too. Wasn't the best ever, but way better than many places.  Would enjoy going back if we are on the West side, and looking for pizza."}
{"text":"I am a fan of Pizza Rock and when I had the opportunity to recently dine at Little Tony's, I went for it.  It's a more \"dumbed down\" (I mean that in the best possible way) version of Pizza Rock - many of the menu items are the same.   The decor is much different - this restaurant has large booths and a more Italian feel.  Although we were there on a slow Tuesday night, our service was painfully slow. Luckily we weren't in a hurry and weren't too bothered by it.  We ordered The Dillinger - they only make 10 a day. HOLY COW!  There is so much going on, it's hard to explain, but it was definitely delicious. We also had the honey, pancetta and parmigiano fries, which were tasty, but not as good as the gorgonzola fries.  Overall, a good experience, but nothing I would go out of my way for. It's not often I am near Palace Station, and Little Tony's probably won't change that - but if you are in the area, it's worth a visit."}
{"text":"I'm starting to loose faith with some of the postings on yelp. I see high ratings for this place but that was not my experience. I had a Caesars salad that was flavorless and tasted like is was pre made and taken out of the refrigerator . Once served there was no offering of fresh ground pepper. My main course was the chicken parm. The chicken was tender but there was very little cheese or sauce on it. For the price they charge it should come with a side of pasta, but it doesn't. I was with one other person who had pizza, the problem was his food was served 15 minutes before mine and I just sat waiting and waiting. My last comment is on how many times do you need to be asked how the food is. I was interrupted 4 times by 4 different people, I think this job should be left to the server and once is enough."}
{"text":"My expectations were set pretty low in terms of Little Tony's. Since I haven't found great pizza yet in Las Vegas, I was expecting another decent but not delicious place. I... I was wrong.   Little Tony's is inside the Palace Station Casino, a little ways off the Strip. You have to navigate your way through Palace Casino to find it too, so expect some walking and bumping into people in the narrow walk ways between slot machines. Enter Little Tony's! A hostess station and a bar greet you, with a large dining area with tables & booths beyond.  We were sat at a booth and our server came to take our order. They were running a special where you get a 9\" pizza and a soda for like $6 or something crazy like that. We each ordered that: She got her's just plain cheese while I got mine with pepperoni & black olives. Our pizzas arrived shortly thereafter, looking delicious! After pulling out the first slice and taking a bite, I was very, very happy. The base/bottom crust of the pizza is pretty thin, just how I like it, piled with sauce, cheese & toppings. It was very tasty. Even when it came to the crust, it was absolutely tasty. I'm going to be honest...they had some other stuff on their menu but I didn't even glance at it. I wanted pizza and nothing else. And pizza I got. And pizza was delicious.   Our server was really friendly, though maybe a bit tired of dealing with people all day. Nevertheless, she was nice and got us our food in a timely manner without any issues. Our bill for both of us was less than $25.00. I'll definitely be back. Delicious pizza at an awesome price? Eff Yea!!!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for authentic Italian food and great scotch drinks.  This is definitely the place to be! The meatballs, sausage, and prosciutto are amazing. The caste iron pizza is a must try! You won't be disappointed. The flavors in every dish compliment each other for a  comfort food feeling. The pictures and lighting make Tony's feel like you're at home around the family table talking to family and close friends."}
{"text":"This place used to be amazing.  5-star amazing.  Used to be.  Prior to August 1st, this restaurant was owned by the same people who own Pizza Rock - and had the same homemade pasta and delicious pizza at a much cheaper cost.  It was our hidden gem off the Strip.  As of August 1, 2016, Stations Casinos bought the restaurant.  The menu has changed, the pasta is no longer homemade, the meatballs are not nearly as good as they used to be, and prices have increased.  The service is good, of course, and the people are friendly.  But I'm giving Little Tony's 2 stars because they used to be one of my favorites and now my disappointment is crushing.    So to everyone who's been here before -- it's not the same.  It's not even close to being the same."}
{"text":"Falls far short of his other establishment, Pizza Rock. We have dined here three times, once being delivery via Bite Squad. All three times, the pizzas were very greasy underneath, and the delivered pizza had the wrong toppings on it. As for dining in, both times the staff was cold and unfriendly. I recommend skipping Little Tony's and just head a couple miles east to Pizza Rock."}
{"text":"Little Tony's is probably the best pizza I've ever eaten.  Enough said.  Chicago style pizza located in the Palace Station Casino.  This is the only thing it doesn't have going for it, but it's definitely a hidden gem in Las Vegas and not to be missed. I'd vote it's cab-worthy from The Strip.   Full service bar as well.  Decor is great, but recall, it's located in a casino; not what you'd expect. Service just ok, but all can be overlooked once you sink your teeth into their pizza!  Can't wait to get back to Vegas and mostly to see if this will be as good the second time around."}
{"text":"Looking for that delicious Pizza Rock pizza but don't want to deal with the large amounts of people and the crazy wait times, BAM!!  Everything we ate was delicious, and service was excellent.  A great alternative to Pizza Rock!"}
{"text":"Good food awesome staff... They are kind and helpful but it may take a while if they get busy worth the wait have patience"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Ordered the Dillenger deep dish, honey and bacon fries and meatballs. All amazing and tasty. Micheal was our server. Great guy. I will be back."}
{"text":"This is one of the best pizza places in town. Always order the New Yorker and it's perfect every time. I also like to get the garlic and rosemary fries as well, delicious.  This location is never really busy, which I appreciate. The most tables I've seen seated here is like 4 haha. With that said, service varies at times. Some days they're really on it, some days service is slow. Seems like they run lean here and don't have too many people working.  Besides that, I have no complaints. Come here for a delicious meal!"}
{"text":"North Beach SF grade pizza in Vegas. AMAZING! Gotta try the Jalapeño Hef beer too. So good!  I found the place via Living Social which is always a gamble, but this time it was a big win.  The staff is super friendly and knowledgable of the owner's other restaurants. The decor is so cool. I felt like I was in New York.  I had my three sons with me and they always go for a pepperoni. They loved it. Thin crust and the cheese and pepperoni are so flavorful.   My boyfriend and I ordered the Don Giovanni pizza and it was perfect. We also had the mixed greens salad and it was great. I enjoyed the picked sweet peppers in it. It was unique and tasty.   For dessert we shared a tiramisu which came in a small mason jar. My boys and I couldn't get enough.    This was our favorite meal in Vegas this week. Affordable, family friendly and good eats."}
