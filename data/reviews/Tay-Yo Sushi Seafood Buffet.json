{"text":"Buffet is one dangerous place for me and my extended family. We will eat all day and all night just sitting there talking and eating away. This place was discovered by my two aunts which I give two thumbs up. The sushi wasn't your typical buffet. It was like it was made to order. They had a lot of hot dishes but I stuck with the sushi. The prices weren't bad and the service is great."}
{"text":"I liked Makino's, they almost double the selection of sushi.It was way more fresh, and I hate how the seating is arranged in the new Tay yo, there was no privacy whatsoever. Everybody can see u stuff your face! The sushi wasn't fresh at all and I can't help but feel guilty when the bill came and I realized that I could of gone to the Bellagio buffet and spent the same amount and had fresher sushi there. Bummer, it was a bad call for me to go there. I'll spend my money more wisely next time, everybody should also."}
{"text":"We cut out a buy one get one free coupon and headed down to Tay Yo to give it another try. The last time we weren't too happy, but the price is right for another go. Shocked to find the place is closed! They folded on the 26th. The last visit wasn't good, but I didn't think they would close up, but they are history. Drove to Wonder Sushi on Green Valley Parkway and guess what???? They are gone too! after all these years!!!! Now we are Sushi Homeless again in Henderson. Times are tough for everyone. Sad."}
{"text":"How lucky am I to score \"First\" tag on this review! I thought they were mere urban legends by now: You hear about them all the time, but rarely experience if for yourself!

While I should be working, I'm writing this review. It would be unfortunate if someone else swooped in and snagged this golden opportunity right when I'm lingering on it's cusp.

We came here on a recommendation, and it featured all the typical offerings you come to expect at a Japanese buffet: Crab legs, assorted sushi and sashimi, tempura, even a fondue fountain like my favorite place Makino.  Only after receiving my credit card slip did I realize that Tay-yo actually IS Makino! I actually thought it was closer in resemblance to Todai.

Makino is another off-strip seafood buffet that is immeasurably better in several aspects. The variety of sushi is definitely more ample in selection and the cost is a slight few dollars more. Tay-yo does have a prime rib carving station, which made me do a jaunty dance gig in delight. I love prime rib, especially the whitish chunks of animal fat.

Draft Kirin for $0.99 a glass may just be worth the visit!"}
