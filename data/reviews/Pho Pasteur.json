{"text":"Not the best pho place in Toronto but it opens 24 hours which is amazing
Their Pho is standard MSG filled broth. Their Bun rieu is pretty decent. The spring rolls here are huge. The menu is also huge here, you can get all kinds of dishes. 
Their Avocado milk shake is very good too"}
{"text":"The stark decor of this restaurant eerily reminds me of a horror movie. It's also strangely fitting since this place is open 24-7. Hmmm...

The pho is pretty good though. The soup is more flavorful than other places, but the large portion of noodles sort of blands the soup out (shush, I know I used bland as a verb). I like that they don't skimp on the extras (basil/herbs, limes, sauces, etc.) and that utensils are at each table for people help themselves. 

Service is typical for pho restaurants. They are friendly towards customers, but don't expect anything amazing. 

Prices are much too high for Chinatown (and pho in general). I guess it makes sense since they need to offset the costs of being open all the time. I just wouldn't choose to come here because of it. Chinatown has so many fantastic and cheap food places that this place is not special enough for the price difference. I guess this would be a great place for late night cravings?"}
{"text":"Its always a good sign when you enter a restaurant and the waitresses dont speak English...that means it's authentic! Unfortunately it doesnt always mean the food being fantastic.  We had the bun with grilled pork and egg roll.  Huge portion, pork was actually grilled, we were pleased.  Had the pho tai nam sach, the portions were huge, but really disappointing.  Where was all the cilantro, green onions and onions in the dish?  The meal felt very bare. Semi-disappointing."}
{"text":"I have had a 4 stars experience and a 3 stars experience at Pho Pasteur so let's say 3.5 stars!

Food: A-
Service: B-
Food presentation: B+
Atmosphere: B
Prices: B+
Recommended?:  Yes

Highlights:

1. Open 24 hours! 

2. The beef Pho and the spring rolls are real tasty.

3. Large portions and reasonable prices. (Large pho would feed four for 10 bucks!)


Tips:

1. Stay away from anything 'special', for example stay away from the special beef pho!

2. Cash only.

3. Make sure you communicate exactly what you want and then double check that they have brought you what you asked for when they bring you the food! I say this because on my second visit they mixed up our orders and our waiter was not helpful at all. However, eventually, the owner/manager did resolve the issue."}
{"text":"Around the world reviewing pho.

My prayers have been answered. 24 hour pho. Genius, pure genius.

I've tried almost all of the Vietnamese restaurants in Toronto and this has one of the best Pho broth. I would say it's the 2nd best in the city.

The service is horrendous. They yell unnecessarily constantly. 

My vegetarian friend ordered no meat. It arrived with meat, we sent it back and they simply pulled the meat out, but left a bunch of small chunks of meat in it. Very not acceptable.

It's good though... And 24hours... So... Whatever I'm there."}
{"text":"Second edit: I changed it and gave it three stars now. The quality really fluctuates!!  Regarding my first edit about the health inspection, the most recent one is a pass so I decided to give it another shot. Why risk it? Well, the other closest pho place nearby is pho hung and the service and quality there is just lacking. Unless there is another health inspection issue with this restaurant, I won't be going anywhere else if i am looking for pho in Chinatown. 

First Edit: it is sad to see my favourite pho place get a conditional pass from the health inspection recently. Knowing how lenient they are with those inspections, I'm a bit grossed out, and I can't and won't recommend this place. 

The pho here is one of the best I've had in Toronto (downtown anyways).  Since it is a 24/7 place, the quality of the pho does vary.  When it is good, it is fantastic.  Sometimes, it is not as good, but I always go there, I'm willing to take my chances. 

It is pricier than other pho restaurants, but the portions are a lot larger!  A medium here is a large elsewhere.  A large here is really extra large! You need two people to finish a large here!  Great deal if you're looking to share one with a friend. 

Great spring rolls here too, and it's a good deal if you order the vermicelli that comes with the spring rolls (large portions as well)."}
{"text":"This is my favourite pho joint in Toronto. When I moved here from Boston in 2005, I immediately noticed a dearth of quality pho places. The broth was often full of fat, and / or had no flavour, or was just infused with copious amounts of sodium in order to make up for the lacking flavour. That's not mentioning the mystery chewy meat that would accompany the pho and all too often with a few miserable soggy beansprouts and wilted Thai basil on the side that even a starving mountain goat would refuse.

Enter Pho Pasteur!  Interestingly the same name as a chain in Boston, but different. Apparently it is a place / restaurant in Vietnam. I've tried upwards of 15 pho places in Toronto and there are some where I like the broth as much as Pho Pasteur, but there is always something else lacking.  Let's be clear, if you are expecting a haute dining experience then this is not the place for you. The interior is clean, albeit has not changed much since the 1980's.

However, the service is fast, the servers (except for the weird guy at night) are amazing, the spiced broth with various flavours including cinnamon is delicious, the meat top quality and in copious amounts as well as loads of fresh beansprouts, Thai basil and chilis on the side. Did I mention the broth is almost always consistent?! I know some of my breathmint conscious compadres do not like onions, but I love the copious amounts of green and regular white onions served with the pho and while the prices are a bit higher than other places, it is 24 hours and the pho comes chock full of meat, unlike other stingier places. The sate pho is not bad here, but I've had better at other places, however the quality of the regular pho is hard to beat. There is also a great selection of other Vietnamese dishes, I liked the hot pot fish, the goat Curry and the tomato beef.

As the place is run by Vietnamese, they will never give you the bill until you ask for it, unlike some other joints in Chinatown.

In summary, good pho, good side veggies, great selection of other Vietnamese dishes, clean, consistent and always open!"}
{"text":"Looks like they changed owners from Vietnamese to Chinese. 

Pho tastes good. One of the best in downtown Toronto for authentic food.

New Chinese guy was mopping the floor with cheap detergent so I almost threw up. Luckily I had a jacket to cover my nose in between bites"}
{"text":"I'm not a Pho snob, connoisseur or expert by any stretch, but after consuming what they serve at Pho Pasteur, I might have to become one.  Who knew broth could be this incredibly flavorful, the beef meatballs, brisket, tendon and tripe so tender but holding their unique textures, making every bite of my \"Beef Special\" Pho (#1) slightly different from the last. 
The \"small\" serving size was overkill so I'm not sure who'd ever get a \"medium\", let alone a \"large\". I had no complaints about the service, but then again, I was the only patron at 4pm on a Sunday evening. As usual, I went with the waitress' suggestion. Instead of my staple, post-meal drip coffee+condensed milk, I went with the \"Salted lemon with soda water\" (#128). Turns out they muddle a \"pickled\" lemon along with some salt and add some good ole Canada Dry club soda. Certainly refreshing, although I was sad at losing the broth aftertaste.
Finally...a 24-hour, no-frills, satisfying joint I can call my favorite!"}
{"text":"While the prices here are about a dollar more than other places, I always have a similar experience when having a pho fix at this restaurant that makes it worth it;

1. My food is consistently good, and I seem to keep fishing never ending beef slice after beef slice after beef slice from my bowl (awesome!) and;

2. There's always an interesting character sitting somewhere in the restaurant. Wether it be 2 guys who finished off half the menu by themselves to the surprise of EVERYONE in the restaurant at 3 in the morning, or a caucasian vagrant who speaks fluent vietnamese while slurping down broth.

How could you NOT want to come try this place?"}
{"text":"I was just really hungry, didn't care how it looked and I just wanted bun bo hue.  

A large it was. Plenty of noodles (asked for pho noodles) and there was pig blood, whoo hoo!  The beef was tough but I was too hungry to complain and there was only one worker, my complaint would mean nothing. As I neared the end, msg overload snuck up on me hard and I stopped immediately. I just couldn't  finish it. 

I usually don't eat that much and even though I loved the pig blood inside.... It's not enough for me to come back."}
{"text":"I think my wife and I have been to every Pho place in the Chinatown area.  Most have been disappointing.  This one is quite good, though.  The soup, noodles and meat are all very good.  Nice selection on the menu.  Spring rolls were also very good.  Love that it's open 24 hours a day.  Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Awesome pho! Full of meat, not overboiled noodles! Huge portions! Only the place is not really nice! But I came for Pho! And minus is for not accepting credit or debit, just cash."}
{"text":"Absolutely massive amount of meat for the price you pay, which seems to be an anomaly for most pho places. Soup is good and nothing to complain about in the noodles. 24hr service is just makes this place amazing."}
{"text":"The first pho meal I had since I left Arizona in May. I decided to go to this place because of what everyone on Yelp was rating it. The pho was good. They have SMALL, MEDIUM, & LARGE size bowls. I ordered the #17 which was gigantic! but i finished it like a champ. :) I ordered the one with the tripe, tendon, and beef brisket. The beef brisket had too much fat though. If they trimmed up the fatty content and heightened the quality of their beef, I could probably honor them a 4 star.

Customer service was adequate, they were fast bring the food out and the lady who took our order was friendly.

Also, the good thing about this place is the fact they're open 24hrs. That's convenient for those who are craving pho after a night on the town. :)"}
{"text":"The main redeeming quality of this place is that it's open 24hours. As such, I have only been here late nights 1 or 2 am when I've had a craving for some sweet pho lovin.

As such, visiting here so early has been hit or miss for me. Sometimes the noodles are soggy and bloated, sometimes the pho is sub-par. A few times have been spot on.

Service is friendly, however the place is a bit sketch, and as discussed the quality is very inconsistent. Prices also verge on the expensive.... 11 bucks for a bowl of medium Pho? Yikes!

Food:1
Service:3
Ambiance:1 (very sketch! nasty washrooms... RUN!)
Overall: 1 of 5 stars"}
{"text":"The pho here is bad. I consider myself a pho connoisseur and I will never go back to this place ever again. The quality of the meat is terrible and the broth is sub-par.

They also only take cash."}
{"text":"Didnt expect anything new from this place in the beginning thinkin just another pho place in this area..but really surprised by the taste. 
Definitely better than most pho places in finch and north york area where all asians are gathered. 
Broth was much more densed than other places. I got a large size pho and it had unlimited amount of meat. 
I wish this place was near my area(finch) so i can go there everydayyyy. 
We also ordered a shrinp roll. Nothing too amazing or too bad; mediocre. 
Definitelllyyy comin bakkk.

Service: i understand asian servers can be rude but the waiter here was very attentive and explained menu nicely."}
{"text":"Huge piles of perfectly crisp, bite-sized spring rolls, plenty of sawleaf herb with your pho, perfectly seasoned broth (an extra kick of cinnamon compared to most places) and it's 24 hours. Pho Pasteur is one of the best cheap spots in Toronto."}
{"text":"I went to the restaurant at 3:00am. I ordered a beef noodle soap small size. What I get is not worth to the prize. I just got a small amount of noodle. I won't come again."}
{"text":"Similar to most pho joints, Pho Pasteur is a no-frills restaurant located on Dundas, just west of Spadina in the heart of Chinatown. Open 24 hours, I bet its popular with the late night post-clubbing crowd.

I tried the Beef Rice Noodle with Tendon. Here, the pho comes in 3 sizes - small ($7.99), medium ($8.75) and large ($9.75). What really surprised me when I first opened the menu was the price! The prices are higher than what I'm used to, especially given that the restaurant is located in Chinatown where there are plenty of good, cheap eats.  Having said that, they were quite generous with the rare beef and tendon. As for the broth, it had a rich flavour which wasn't too salty. And I'm certainly not a pho connoisseur, but I thought this broth was damn tasty! 

My friends went with the Chicken Rice Noodle Soup. I didn't try any of it but they assured me it was delicious. They come here often and always order this, so it must be good! 

To drink, I ordered the Vietnamese Coffee - with condensed milk and ice. Only after ordering it, did I noticed the price on the menu: $5.50. For only a tiny bit of coffee, I found the price to be rather steep. Sure, it tasted good, but it didn't taste any different from the coffee's I've had at other Vietnamese restaurants for a lower price. 

So, what's the verdict? Sure, the prices are on the high side but their pho is delicious!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Digusting.. bad quality meat and also quite expensive. No thanks!! 
This place is only worth going to if you stumble across the area at 3am and literally starving."}
{"text":"Gotta love the pho and spring roll combo at 3AM. This place is 24 hours so you can go anytime....and they keep the quality pretty consistent whatever time of day you go.

I do think they have one of the better pho soup broths in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Oh my, this is some pho-tastic soup!  Every aspect of this place is pho-nominal, from the pho-togenic presentation to the magni-pho-cent fatty chunks of meat. It was abso-pho-king-lutely delicious, I gobbled it down like an Idahoan pho-rmer after a long day in the fields. I postulate that a new subatomic particle is responsible for the incredible flavour, hopefully CERN will find this elusive pho-ton with a mass somewhere north of 4 TeV. \"I pity the pho\" who doesn't know the true nature of this Vietnamese delight.

Enough of this punny pho-lishness, down to the nuts and bolts! Tender chunks of close-to raw beef in my dish made me very happy, as did the hand-cut noodles. The broth was near-perfect, salty and pho-rmidable and although the medium size was enormous, I found myself consuming phor too much of it along with the much lauded Sriracha 'hot cock' sauce and their own fresh chili sauce, which was really tasty. They serve an extra-pho-gant plate of super-fresh and crunchy bean sprouts on the side with full branches of purple basil and other leafy herbs to pho-lavour your broth. I'll not beat around the bush, the accoutrements were all pho-gasmic, truly masterful pho-llatio!  Bravissi-pho!

The restaurant was clean and well lit (the lighting was perhaps a bit garish, but quite forgivable) and the service was fast and pho-riendly.

This famous 24 hour spot is no phony, if you want really good soup anytime, check out Pho Pasteur, it's some of the best soup I've ever had, and it's really cheap for the enormous bowls that they give you. What are you waiting for, don't be a phool, it's open now!"}
{"text":"Pasteur is the best Vietnamese restaurant in Toronto. 

The pho broth is very flavorful without being too oily.  If you like things spicy, request satay in your pho and you will be treated to the pinnacle of pho delights. The rare beef is fresh and nicely sliced. Get a large if you are very hungry and your hungry will be satiated quite nicely.

The rice dishes are also very good. My particular favourite is the grilled beef with rice (I often opt for an additional fried egg on top). The beef is nicely grilled, with subtle seasonings and garlic. The rice is generously piled on the plate.. Drizzle the fish sauce over the dish and it transforms into an exquisite masterpiece revealing itself with every bite.

The fresh fruit shakes are also noteworthy. Try the green bean, pennyleaf, and coconut."}
{"text":"Been here twice past midnight and was surprised that the bean sprouts and basil leaves were fresh looking! I appreciated that it was open 24 hours because i occasionally get a craving for pho late at night. 

another thing to note, they have the tomato beef stew thing in size large! most places only have size small so that was a pleasant surprise. I've also had the rare beef noodles and it was yummy.

The staff were attentive and although some didn't understand English, they were still able to communicate.

Come here for pho when you find yourself hungry at 3am =)"}
{"text":"Pho Pasteur ?????? is arguably one of the best pho in the GTA - I'm not kidding. They have the best crispy spring rolls (Ch giò) in town, and you have to order this without fail. It is not your typical spring roll, it is larger than normal, and the customary tradition would be to wrap a spring roll in lettuce with basil, vegetables and dip this in fish sauce - delicious! 

We also ordered a large portion of grilled pork chop (Com Suon Hot Ga) that is served with a sunny-side up egg and of course delicious Vietnamese condiments like shredded vegetables with fish sauce. 

One of the unique noodle dishes would be the Hue-style Beef Vermicelli Soup which is bursting with flavours and spicy enough to bring on a manly sweat. Ending of on a sweeter note, we ordered a traditional Vietnamese iced coffee (cà phê sa ?á), which is the perfect drink after such a feast."}
{"text":"I had pho here tonight and I felt like someone beat me up--I mean this in a good way. I could barely move from all the broth sloshing around in my belly, I had a mad case of soup sweats, and I just wanted to curl up and go to sleep.

This is my usual spot for pho in Chinatown. I took a break from it for a while because the broth was unusually weak on my last visit but I decided to give it another chance for Pho-bruary and it seems to be back on track.

The Pho-ndamentals
Pho Tai Gan (rare beef and beef tendon); medium = $7.75
Broth: invigorating and refreshing, if a bit on the light side; could be richer but the combination of aromatic spices imparts a lovely flavor
Beef: thin, lean slices of beef
Tendon: I like their thick, smooth slices instead of chunky globs 
Noodles: dried, i.e., not fresh noodles but steeped just right in the broth
Garnishes: the mung bean sprouts and basil are always super fresh and they include saw leaf (shout out to Deanna W!)

Service: I always see the same reticent waitress who doesn't talk much but gets the job done and she flashes a sweet, genuine smile each time I say good-bye to her.

Other: I really enjoy the summer rolls here; they make them fresh to order and do not skimp on the shrimp. The place is always sparkling because the waitress is constantly wiping down surfaces and mopping.

3 and 3/4 stars which I will round up to 4 because of my favorite waitress"}
{"text":"I went there again for dinner. The pho was still good as before. The springrolls were tasty.  The bill was higher than average.  

Not sure when this happened, but someone took my wallet out of my coat pocket.  So beware of where you put your wallet.  My coat was hanging on one of the chairs."}
{"text":"Funny name for that restaurant... but : 

Best broth ever. I had a Pho Tai Bo Vien and I loved it. The meat is excellent and comes with vegetables. Broth taste very good and is not fatty at all.

One bad point : it's expensive  $  $ !!!

One good point : best place for hangover meal ; open 7/7 24/24 

MIAM MIAM !"}
{"text":"Yum. This is an unassuming little eatery, so I had zero expectations when I walked in late one night. It was reassuring that the place was spotlessly clean and the staff friendly.

The pho was spectacular. The price was definitely on the not-so-cheap side of normal, but certainly not pricey.

So I went back. Again. And again. And again. 

This has now become my go-to restaurant when I'm in Chinatown. And no matter what I order, it's delicious - I've had several of the pho dishes, and am now working my way through the other items. So far, every single entree has been excellent. The fried rolls? I've had better, but then I don't usually order them, so it's fine. The shakes are thick and not too sweet - yum.

Well worth your time and money."}
{"text":"Certainly in the Top 3 Pho restaurants in the city, at least in terms of what I've tried.

The broth is beautifully aromatic and has a lot of flavour; it doesn't just taste like salt water, like many cheap pho broths often do. This is certainly a broth made with LOVE.

The noodles are never overcooked, they use nice cuts of beef, and the sprouts and herbs are always fresh. What more could you ask for in a bowl of pho? Also, the food is consistent and the service is friendly.

The eccentric man small older gentleman who works the late night shifts with a slightly high-pitched throaty voice (I don't recall his name; call him \"Mr. Pasteur\") is quite the character and it's always a pleasure to be served by him."}
{"text":"Cockroach in my pho. Kitchen is horrendous- should have known.  Owner blamed cockroach on \"the holidays\". I don't know what that means. Never again."}
{"text":"Too much MSG !! Service was great. Pho soup was hot enough. But both of us felt the MSG was way too much.  We had to drink tons of water, yet the next day we still felt unpleasant taste of MSG."}
{"text":"It may be 1 or 2$ pricier than other places but it also makes up for it in quantity. Portions here are huge and fortunately quality is not compromised.

Pho is delicious and comes with plenty of accompanying garnishes (they certainly don't skimp out like many other Pho joints).

The rice dishes with grilled pork, chicken and or beef are also delicious and will satisfy the greatest hunger.

Fresh rolls and fried spring rolls are just as tasty as they are generous in portion.

Overall, it's a Yum Yum situation."}
{"text":"It was my first Phó I ever had, and it was great. Love that it is open late!"}
{"text":"i got the most expensive rice plate from a pho joint here. when i got the order i thought wow this is quantity for the money. then i realized it just had A TON of rice. other than the massive amount of rice it still is larger than other rice plates. my shredded pork was super cold. i think it might have come out of the refrigerator and someone just didn't bother to at least put it in the microwave. 
i've been here other times ordering different dishes and they were all subpar."}
{"text":"Since about two years ago my bf found this little pho restaurant, we've been frequent customers. We are especially in love with the satay beef pho that it's gone to the point that once we walk into the restaurant they know what we want without ordering. I've been to a lot of pho places (and i really mean A LOT) and none of them has surpassed this place. It just caters to my taste buds so perfectly that I have to come back to this place pretty much every week. While it is more expensive than other places, my bf and I usually share the large which is exactly good enough a portion to completely fill our tummies- all at the price of approx 13 dollars for the two of us. 

So YES! Will be coming back to this place (every week)!!!"}
{"text":"*disclaimer* I don't eat Pho.

Now that we got that out of the way, I do enjoy other Viet-treats.  The menu sucks for non-pho eaters. On Last visit I ordered cold shrimp rolls which were fine, but really basic and lacking all of delicious herbs. 

I asked (as there was no option on the menu) for a Bun (vermicelli dish) sans meat. I was here with my SO who had come to try the Pho satay and I was too hungry to just watch him eat.  

I get it, I am annoying for asking them to make me something that isn't on their menu, but all I wanted was \"pork bun no pork\" it should be doable, especially since I was willing to pay the pork price. Regardless,  I got some sort of heap of very oily noodle, not even vermicelli, fried with a couple random bits of vegetables. It was barely editable. Most disappointing when I got the bill and they had charged me $9 and change for it.  If we had gone to Xe ula down the street, I could have had a decent bun and a milkshake for that. 

We won't be returning. We are spoiled, living in the east side where there are tonnes of quality options i guess."}
{"text":"Pho and vermicilli are very good. Spring rolls are very fresh.

Open 24 hours, it's even busy after club hours (we've had to wait for a table at 3am). It's a tiny bit pricier than the other Viet joints in Chinatown (Xelua/Pho Hung) but they put more meat in their pho. 

Don't order the drinks, not worth it compared to what you get from Xelua (they have the best), since they are smaller.

This place is in my regular list of places to eat out."}
{"text":"I used to frequent here when I lived in Chinatown.  Their price point seems to be higher for a Vietnamese restaurant but the portion is quite generous, both in quantity of meat and bean sprout.  I like their pho more than other spots in Chinatown but the broth tends to be on salty side.  Bun bo hue taste good as well and the spicy level is hot enough, but the broth isn't as flavourful as Pho Linh.  They also serve large selection of menu, and their spring roll is HUGE but quite delicious.  One of my favourite item is their curry goat with bun, so yummy and tasty.  Service wise is similar to other Vietnamese restaurant.  Overall a good place to grab Vietnamese bite. Not the best in term of pho or bun bo hue but good enough to worth visit in Chinatown.  3.5/5"}
{"text":"After having been curious to try this hidden gem for the longest time, I finally made it in here for a solo lunch on a cloudy Sunday afternoon. And yes, it is indeed a gem.

I take a seat looking out onto Dundas as a smiling lady places a pot of lukewarm tea (could be hotter), a cup, laminated menu and order form in front of me. The place looks to be a little outdated, but clean. They are playing CHUM FM. And the place is rather empty (given, it was about 3:30 pm).

There are 3 sizes of bowls - S, M, L to choose from, which is nice. The prices here are slightly more expensive than Pho Hung or Xe Lua, a size small bowl is $6.99. I almost go for medium #1, but at the last-minute go for a small instead. And thank goodness. When I get my meal - real quick-fast by the way, about 4 minutes later - it is a pretty hefty \"small\", accompanied by a giant heap of deliciously crisp bean sprouts and a nice assortment of herbs. 

Initial reactions - bean sprouts are really healthy looking. A weird observation, but one of those things that you notice when you see it. The broth is letting off so much steam you may as well call him Thomas. Another weird observation, I know, but it made me realize that neither Xe Lua, Pho 88, nor Pho Hung have ever brought any bowl out to me quite so piping hot. The thin slices of beef are perfectly medium rare, and there is lots of it. I'm not normally a fan of tripe, but this is delicious as it's cut very thin, like the onions and the noodles. Yes, the noodles are fantastically thin. Broth packs excellent flavour. And by the end of it all, I've fished out every possible noodle and I'm stuffed.

A great meal to accompany the sounds of Beyonce and Katy Perry."}
{"text":"You be a phool to not order pho here and that's exactly what we did for dinner last night. We had just come back from an exhausting bike ride of the Toronto Islands and the phor of us were famished. 

Usually I order my go to 'bun vermicelli with chicken and spring roll' but one of my friends was just raving about this amazing and cheap unphogettable experience he had at Xe Lua, c'mon!  that prompted me to hunt on Yelp for a Pho restaurant that we hadn't all gone to.  

Voila Pho Pasteur!  Got good reviews. Only one of the phor of us had been. (not me) No bias.

I've walked pass Pho Pasteur several times it's just a stone throw away from the corner of Spadina and Dundas and it's open twenty pho hrs!  Honestly though I'm not a phonatic about eating soup. I do have it from time to time when I'm sick and seeking comfort food. 

I must add I did have my fair share of pho back in the day though after a late night car meets/club/party, we'd get pho'ed up as they were the only places open so late.

Atmosphere: its family oriented lots of tables for phors. Decor standard. Good lighting.

Pho usually cheap right??!  Well not here.  I cracked open the menu, wtp things were priced 30-40% more than Xu Lua ?! ie. $9 bowls instead of $6 , a spring roll order is $7.45 

Granted I don't mind paying more if it's worth it.. but that had to be determined. Anyways did I find something I took a liking to from the menu description. 

Rice Noodle Bowl + Grilled Chicken (served on the side) came in just the Large size. $12

The wait no more than 7 mins when the bowls of soup arrived. 

Revelation moment:

Dayum this is good broth, it has various levels of flavour. The rice noodle used is the banh pho,  translucent and flavorless type not the flat ho fan mush you find at many shops. The noodle is more firm in texture. 

This experience sets the mark so far, it's my Pho baseline for 2012. 

It was excellent and worth the price of admission. My friend also admitted he liked the broth better than what he had at Xe Lua. 

To settle the score with my friend, we paid the bill and walk over to Xe Lua to do a back to back comparison..  You'll have to check the upcoming review for that one. :)

Pho Pasteur Pho Sho!"}
{"text":"They keep the restaurant simple and clean. Pho was satisfying. Service is nice."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Pho Pasteur in over 8 years as it was my first and last time (so I thought). Definitely not a place I would go if I wanted pho. I didn't have a good experience because I clearly remembered the soup was very salty and noodles didn't taste fresh, plus wilted vegetables were served.  Guess that's the problem with a restaurant that opens 24 hours,  one would question the freshness of their soups and quality of their food.

Since our go-to pho place was closed tonight due to water issue, a friend convinced us to try Pho Pasteur as it was his go-to pho place.  We were hesitant,  but because we were all hungry and fact he was treating we gave it a try.

Price wise it was a little more expensive than the usual pho restaurants: $8.75 for small,  $9.75 for medium, and $10.75 for large. 

I ordered the pho dac biet since that's the standard special pho with a bit of different meats (rare beef, flank beef, beef balls, tendons, and tripe). Good amounts of meats, but beef was a little overcooked as it was tough and chewy.

Service was friendly and efficient, plus lucky for us our friend spoke Vietnamese so that helped,  but we also managed to speak Cantonese to the server as well which was a bonus.

Overall,  I am surprised that the experience wasn't too bad, pho was decent as broth was flavourful and not too salty, then again when one is hungry we usually don't complain too much unless it's really horrible. 

Will probably give it another try because of the convenient location and their 24 hours operating times. Cash only."}
{"text":"After driving 10 hours from USA to Canada, this was the first place we went for food. I was super hungry and was impressed with the Bun Rieu. It looked and tasted good. Thumb up. Some of my friends ordered Pho and they said it was okay. Edible but not top on their list. 2 of my friends order Bun Bo Hue and only had 1 bite. too unappetizing. 

The bathroom was clean just in case anyone wonders. I would suggest dipping your chopsticks and spoons into the tea to make sure that they are clean. They also put a sign in front for reminder --- \"CASH ONLY\"."}
{"text":"I feel very conflicted about only giving this place three stars for a number of reasons. First, it is always there for me. As this is the only 24 hour pho joint in the city (as far as I can tell), I know it will always be there for me at 3 AM when I need it most. You cannot say that about most restaurants outside of Chinatown. Second, they make a beautiful takeout package. Pho is something that is not easy to transport given the hot liquid and the need to keep the ingredients separate so that you can put it all together in your house. This place always manages to keep all the separate containers intact and makes sure that anything that can be spilled is wrapped tightly in a plastic bag. Third, this place is fast. I know pho is pretty much just broth and meat but this restaurant can have your meal ready faster than anywhere else in the city. 

So why only three stars? The quality of the beef has really gone downhill. When I first started coming here about three years ago, the cuts of beef were always decent and I would typically eat every last piece in the bowl. In recent years, they have started mixing the strips of beef with so much fat and gristle that I end up taking about half of it out and putting it in a separate bowl that is not pleasant to look at and far less pleasant to eat. This problem could so easily be solved if they would stop being so cheap and return to their roots but I have started to lose hope after three or four bad experiences. Pho Pasteur - get your act together!"}
{"text":"This place has the WORST Pho I've ever tasted. I only went here because it was 4am in the morning and my friend and I were starving. I took 3 bites and push my bowl back and said I'm done. Even while I was famished I still could not stand the taste of how bad it was.  I've had Pho in Melbourne, Sydney, Vancouver and  Vietnam so I know good/decent Pho and the Pho this place serves is an embarrassment.  Might as well give me pubic hair noodles, piss broth and shit for meat and it'd taste better."}

Pho Pasteur is located in Chinatown, it's little off the intersection and at a smaller building so you have to look out for a sign.

Its very bright inside and cleaner than I expected it to be. It's always nice to see authentic asian restaurants that are clean especially in Chinatown. They have extensive selection of different types of meat that could be served on top of soup noodles. They have small sauce dishes on side which I like, cause then I don't have to use the spoon. They are open 24 hours so you can drop by after a night of partying and drinking.

Ordered: RARE BEEF AND TRIPE NOODLE SOUP - So far this is the best Vietnamese noodle I had in Toronto. The soup was rich and full with flavor-although I like mine with a bit of hot sauce. It came with lots of thin sliced rare beef and tripe on top, there was so much of it I found it a little difficult to mix it up before taking a bite but I am not complaining! Just for personal preference, I wish they put in more cilantro but that's just me. Hot sauce tasted a little watered down and they only take cash.

SUMMARY: Make sure to bring cash to grab some of this pho goodness! :)"}
{"text":"Food is poor, service is slow and waitress/owner (I guess?) is only interested in serving Caucasian clients (it's obvious based on her behavior). I will not be returning. Done deal here. I recommend you look else where"}
{"text":"Pho was great, service was quick, and servers did not rush us out the door. Love that."}
{"text":"My friend and I were in the area and are huge pho fanatics. We heard good things about Pho Pasteur so we were excited to give it a try. 

Perhaps our expectations were too high or they were just having an off night but the entire overall experience wasn't a good one. The staff was really rude/ indifferent to us. The food took a very long time to be served and I can honestly say it was the least impressive pho I've ever had. Very bland and overdone. We ordered a side of spring rolls and they too were very unappetizing. The food was overpriced for pho in general but also for the quality and there were flies in the establishment. They didn't accept credit or debit so we had to go down the street to an atm machine. The only perk for this place is that it's 24 hours, but even that won't persuade me in returning here."}
{"text":"One of the most repeating restaurants in Toronto. Always order menu #1, their house special pho which taste so authentic and wonderful. I brought many friends and families, they always enjoy their food so much!"}
{"text":"- relatively high prices compared to nearby competitors
- food is average. Doesn't justify price 
- open 24/7 though"}
{"text":"Short review 

A little big expensive but DELICIOUS broth and it's available 24 hrs :D

The soup is continuously inflused with flavour. Maybe that's why it's so tasty?

Would go here in the late nights."}
{"text":"Being a 24 hour place, quality and price can be expected to be somewhat subpar. Price was higher than I'd like to pay for pho, but the convenience of 24 hour service is nice.
I got the spring rolls and beef pho. The spring rolls were delicious, as if they were made in house. However, the pho was disappointing.
The noodles were too hard for my liking and the broth was a little watered down. I'd like to mention that I ate here around 3AM.
No where near the worst pho I've had but certainly not the best. If you're craving pho in the middle of the night and you're in the area, consider eating here!"}
{"text":"A good place for late night eats. Our party of 9 came in after the fireworks and we were invited to take over the \"Reserved\" table. I wonder who that was reserved for.

Getting in and out of the seats to go to the bathroom was a little challenging because the chairs are so close together.

The Pho was...it was there. I got the 101 which I expected to have everything, but it didn't. I'm not sure why they called that the special. Still it hit the spot."}
{"text":"Their soups such as their pho are amazing.  I've heard some complain that it's too salty but I like my food to be somewhat salty so that isn't a concern for me.   But their pho broth has tremendous depth of flavour with bountiful rice noodles and side condiments of bean sprouts, lime, thai basil, and culantro (saw tooth herb I think it's called).  I have tried some of their other dishes such as their bun, etc and I didn't really care for them.   I guess it's their soups that draws their customers."}
{"text":"Everyone makes excuses for the service and cleanliness because it's an Asian restaurant, right. Well stop it!  We shouldn't have to settle for nothing but an acceptable level of service and hygiene from any asian restaurant. This is Canada and not some back water country in Asia. Diners have a right to be served in a clean healthy environment. No more excuses that this is how it is in asian restaurants. If they can't maintain an acceptable service level consistent with N. American practices and adhere to safe food handling guidelines then they shouldn't be operating at all, despite how good the food is PERIOD!  And WTF is up with the greasy dishes & utensils."}
{"text":"L'avantage de vivre au Canada c'est l'ouverture H24 de certains restaurants. Le Phô Pasteur en fait partie. A la recherche d'un lieu pour manger après 22h et pas envie de l'éternel Hot Dog? Allez faire un tour dans ce resto où vous pourrez déguster votre bol de Phô pour environ 8$ avec un service rapide et souriant."}
{"text":"Need 24-hour pho? Have 24 hr pho. That's all that needs to be said.

If you need more of a review, there are plenty here, but this place has average food at an average price with outstanding hours."}
{"text":"Craving bun, we lazily walked up Dundas toward Spadina and Chinatown on a warm Sunday afternoon. Pho Pasteur is the 24 hour pho joint just far enough off the main drag of Spadina that it doesn't get much attention. Since a couple new spots opened next door that brightened things up we thought of giving Pho Pasteur a sober daytime chance. It turns out that Pho Hung, the long-time chinatown pho restaurant, has not much to worry about. Pho Pasteur has generous portions with large bowls of bun almost overflowing with minty greens, vermicelli noodles, large pieces of meat and shrimp, and thick juicy/crispy viet rolls. Served with the usual side of dressing, the meal was satisfying and very filling. While the rolls were full of flavour and not greasy, the chicken and beef were not quite up to Pho Hung's typical dainty offerings. Given that this is a neighbourhood eatery and not part of the chinatown tourist strip, it is a good place to frequent as a quieter alternative. I'd like to try another item on the menu sometime and sample their chili sauce that I noticed after using the Sriracha sauce."}
{"text":"Waited half hour for vermicelli with extra chicken was hardly any chicken and vermicelli mush!!! Threw the whole thing out. 17$ plus I tipped them 3$ ha what a joke"}
{"text":"I eat a lot of pho. I still eat a lot of pho. And if I have to eat pho when I'm in Toronto this is my first choice when I'm near downtown/Chinatown.

While the price became higher over the years the rate of price raise is pretty much in line with other popular pho places around the city. I miss the days of x-large phos being under $10 but those days seem to be over I most places so can't really fault Pasteur I guess.

When I'm here I'm usually torn between the typical pho and satay. Both are very flavorful and tasty and I end up drinking most of the soup without realizing. Probably unhealthy if you consider the base salt and the added salt from the sauces you often mix in but it's just so good.

When it's hot out you can ask for your tea cold. It's pretty refreshing and better than just ice water. Pretty good for large groups too since they have randomly long table connections with like dozen chairs, which I usually occupied with just few people since the place isn't too busy during the random hours we tend to visit."}
{"text":"I'm not a stranger to bad service or no service in china town, since I'm not really here for the service. But this one woman in this restaurant was giving us attitude for the moment we stepped in till we left. She refused to split our bill for two. Took away our bowls before I was even done. And always gives this rude stare. Never had this happen to us before. Also the utensils are always oily, make sure you \"wash\" them in tea."}
{"text":"I saw someone write about the smell in this place.. it is pretty awful. Almost like someone smoked 10 packs a day for a year there...its in the walls..

However, I got over the smell after a few minutes and decided to stay because 1) I was starving 2) too lazy to go elsewhere 3) I heard this place was good.

Was it - well yes, it was pretty good pho. Probably the second best I've had. I almost never eat the sprouts anywhere else; here I found myself adding more and more! So fresh! The meat was good too.

It was a bit on the pricier side for Pho. For that reason and that I can't erase the smell of the memory, I probably won't return - but the food itself is good if you'd like to try."}
{"text":"Are you kidding me?! This place sucks ass! We came here for a late night bite. I tried the pho #3 and shrimp rolls. Obviously the people who give this place good reviews doesn't know shit about pho. The pho was salty and the noodles were soggy. The service sucked too. The lady behind the counter was rude. Make sure she doesn't try to short change you because that's what she did to us. If this was the last pho place on Earth, I still wouldn't come. Bye bye."}
{"text":"Every time I'm here it's late and I'm a bit inhebriated. I go full Yelp adventurer and want something that isn't Pho. I get the 65 or whatever it is. It's called like special soup or something. It has crayfish pancakes. The menu doesn't mention the fact it has crayfish pancakes. Its basically wonton soup with crayfish. I'm sure it's very traditional, I'm not sure how many people order it. I just need to remember to stop ordering it. This has happened to me twice now. 

So in conclusion when at PHO Pasteur , have the PHO. It's okay but at three in the morning it does the trick."}
{"text":"I was always scared of this place because it's open 24 hours.

When I came back to visit Toronto a friend of mine informed me that my old go to pho place Golden Turtle had been renovated and now the food sucked, so he brought me here because apparently this place has amazing broth.

I can indeed confirm that the pho broth was incredibly tasty. I also like how stark and weird the decor is. And well I guess it would have to be so you don't have weirdo's loitering in your 24hr pho joint that is beside a housing project."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in Toronto and I feel the need to be verbally abused by someone who looks like my auntie, I will make sure to go here. The actual food will almost make it worth the shattering of ego. Had the Pho Ga (chicken pho) cause I've been battling a cold, and it did the job. Pretty tasty, though not the best I've had."}
{"text":"Pretty good pho and stew. Not always the cleanest and the service can be a little slow sometimes but overall the food is pretty darn tasty. Lots of options, try the stews!"}
{"text":"Still decent broth, but the prices have definitely gone up. Over $7.00 for an order of spring rolls is insane. Just a tip: they're pretty greasy, anyway.

The pho remains large with lots if accompanying sprouts and basil, but there were only  a few small bits of tendon in my soup. There used to be a lot more."}
{"text":"Pho Pasteur (in Toronto) kind of had a Pho Hoa (in Vancouver) essence. I think since they both open 24/7 it sort of felt like this would be a good after partying/hang over spot.

My BBH wasn't anything out of the ordinary. I ended up not finishing it which doesn't happen a lot. My friend had requested for a vegetarian Pho but towards the end of her meal she found a piece of beef tripe in her soup. She pointed it out to the staff and they immediately apologized and took that off the bill, so that was good of them.

Do I like Pho Pasteur better than the Pho Hoa's in Vancouver? Yes. If given the opportunity to visit Toronto, would I eat here again? Most likely not."}
{"text":"Their bun bo hue is legit and authentic. It has pigs blood and pigs feet. Its even better because they debone the pigs feet.  When it's 2AM and ur hungry after being out all night, it doesn't get better than pho Pasteur. And yes, it's better than the xelua down the street."}
{"text":"Note to self: next time bring a bib.

That was one splashy, slurpy, and slooshy good time. 

Splashy: Great, strong beef broth.

Slurpy: Yummy noodles, ever-so slightly firm.

Slooshy: The medium was huuuuuge, so my stomach was slooshing around the entire walk back to the office.

As well, the soup was served with a huge side of fresh basil, limes and uncut peppers, so we were left asking for nothing. The service, like Susan C wrote was efficient and quietly friendly. 

Can't wait to return for more pho and a non-pho tour of the menu."}
{"text":"Went to this place tonite. Been twice before. The service is normally mehhh... but passable in the previous 2 times. Tonite was a joke and annoyingly frustrating. 2 viet boys were manning the waiter duties, early 20's both appear to be straight from vietnam. English was terrible; could not speak basic grade 1-2 english or chinese (cantonese or mandarin). I did hear some mumbling in viet. I asked one one guy for cold instead of the regular hot tea. 99.5% of viet eateries will know what that means in 2 seconds. One of the idiot kids kept trying to act tough and stupid and pretended not to know. After asking him 3-4 times and him responding \"..huh? huh? what u mean?\" I gave up and gave him a death stare. Felt like smacking this idiot. He got pissed, turned around and flail his arms like FU buddy and walked into the kitchen to bish about me. I tried to flag the guy again to no avail. I then flagged his buddy and he came over. He could actually understand grade 1 english and returned with cold tea. He also gave me extra bean sprouts when asked though he didnt exactly have a smile on his non-customer service face. I dont know who runs this joint but it seems everyone is pissed, dont give a crap, and any special request or question is ignored. The prices here arent exactly cheap either. They round off to the nearest dollar sometimes and rip you off an extra 25-30 cents if you're not paying attention to the bill. Then when you ask them to correct it they sigh and get upset. Stupid idiots... needless to say I left without giving a single cent in tip which they deserved. The dac biet pho overall is pretty good. I liked the fact they are one of the very few pho joints that give lemon grass as part of the side dish with bean sprouts and thai basil. Makes it taste and smell really good. Yum! I would say the pho here is almost as good as Tien Thanh but the service makes it subpar and dumbed down version by a mile. It's too bad the increase in min wage has jacked the pho prices at Tien Thanh. Otherwise that would be my prime and only choice for pho in TO. The pho at Pasteur is above average; I would give it an 8/10. But the service is a minus -10/10. YMMV. *welp*"}
{"text":"At 3am when you're hungry after a night out this is the place to go. Although it can be busy at time, the service is great, the pho is amazing and you';ll get the food fast.

Recommended order: #1 special

Keep in mind, it's cash only"}
{"text":"Their pho is a winner my books.   No shortage of meat and good broth.   Only complaint is drafty seating near the door in the colder weather."}
{"text":"Food here is average at best. Service here is always a hit or a big miss. Last time I was there that ridiculous looking man with the red hair was in a mood. The only thing this restaurant has going for it self, is that it's open 24 hours. During regular business hours there are other better vietnamese restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"DONT BOTHER! I'm even too upset to type. 

Customer Service is horrible lol I'd rate it -1/5
Food is 2/5"}
{"text":"The pho is pretty good. It's not too oily, the noodles were a bit too soft but overall it was worth the money I paid for it. Lots of meat/assorted things and noodles compared to other places. 

Drinks were too expensive to buy, especially with so many cheaper places nearby. Still, if you're looking for pho this a place you can come to. Not a very strong statement I know, but I'm just neutral like that."}
{"text":"Decent quality and size pho, open 24 hours which is why this place is the spot.. Horrible decor and service. Washroom is always so dirty and gross, you should just wait until you get home"}
{"text":"Had some great food here at 5:30am in the morning finding myself craving for Phor. The staff's friendly and service's prompt. I'm surprised to find out there're 3-4 groups come and go this early. Ordered their signature spring roll which has yam in there with a small bowl of beef Phor. With a full stomach, I Started my day with so much Phor-powered energy!"}
{"text":"It was 2am... Me and a friend walked in and saw the menu... $10 for spring roll!? get outta here! we decided to go down the street to Train restaurant instead"}
{"text":"With all the positive reviews, I felt disappointed. 

I eat pho frequently. A lot of places are about the same. The biggest strike against Pho Pasteur is the price. This place is about $2 more than I expect on every single item. Before you say $2 is not much, consider that Pho is generally cheap. It's about a 20-30% price difference if I factor in tax and tips. And the portion isn't really larger (nor do I want it to be larger than other pho places). 

Ok ok. It's open 24 hours. But so what? Makes no difference to me. 

As for the food itself, I didn't find the pho any different from other places (meaning it's very delicious). No difference and higher prices = I'll never come here again, especially when I have many other choices. 

It might have been that particular day but I felt the restaurant was a bit sticky and muggy."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Pho in Toronto! 
Since its a 24/7 place many people don't think its a top restaurant but once you try it you quickly change your mind. The ambience isn't great but the food is amazing. Take a look at Pho Tien Thanh, I'm pretty sure it high on people's list only because it's on Ossington and Hipsters like to Yelp."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Pho place downtown.  It is a bit pricier than the likes of Pho Hung, Pho 88 etcetera with a small ringing in at $7.99, a medium for $8.75 and a large for $9.75 - but its worth it for the added quality.

When we arrived, we were the only table of Asians in the restaurant.  There was Lady Gaga blaring in the background.  Our first thought was - should we stay or should we go?  

I ordered #1 - Pho Dac Biet (Special Beef Pho) in medium.  I must say that a medium at Pho Pasteur is the equivalent to a large in some of the other pho restaurants that fill your bowl up to the brim to make it appear you are getting a large, but alas, its mostly soup that fills your bowl.  Not at Pho Pasteur!  They are generous both in the quantity of beef parts, and rice noodles.  Their soup base is bold and savory, but like most other pho places, makes you sip water for hours on end after consumption.

Pho comes with the standard fixings of bean sprouts, basil, mint, chilis and lime wedges.  One thing I liked about Pho Pasteur is that they actually provide condiment dishes for you.  Unlike most other pho places where you must use one spoon for the soup, and another spoon to serve as a makeshift sauce holder.  

I realized quickly that the prices here are probably what make it not as busy as the likes of Pho Hung and Pho 88 - which are more budget friendly for the student population.  So don't let the lack of customers fool you, Pho Pasteur is wonderful!"}
{"text":"I usually like to avoid the long lineups and chaos at Pho Hung and head over to Pho Pasteur for my pho cravings. 

Somewhat more pricey than the other pho joints on the spadina-chinatown strip but I find it's worth it because the 1) the place is open 24 hours 2) they tend to be a little more generous with the beef  3) they include sawtooth herb or vietnamese coriander in their herb plate (i find this is not used as much in toronto pho places as it is in ottawa). And I find the broth is more complex and less salty than Xe Lua or Pho Hung. It's a very heady, boiled down to the bones broth which I appreciate. The meat is also decent here, provided you don't order any of the brisket or tripe cuts that is when you're liable to get the stringy or fatty bits.

This place is not as bustlin as pho hung or xu lua but for my pho fix in chinatown I find that it does me just right. Plus it's open 24 hours-how many other pho joints operate under those conditions?"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Pho and this place does it REALLY WELL.  The price is a bit on the more expensive side compared to some of the other places in the neighborhood but you get what you pay for. It' s open 24 hours so the broth is simmering all day long so it's by far the most flavourful broth you'll find in Chinatown.  Get past the slightly disconcerting decor/atmosphere when you first walk in, and you'll see the servers are genuine and polite and the Rare Beef Pho Saté is the best in the city.  Only rookies will tell you to go to Pho Hung or Xeu La or the others, as far as I'm concerned this is the only place you want to be going for Pho, and you can get it 24/7!"}
{"text":"Pho Pasteur is one of the top 3 pho places compared to everywhere else on Spadina (and there are many). Why? The quality is better, the broth is more flavorful with lots of umami. The noodles are never too soft, the rare beef or brisket is always tasty and the accompanying accoutrements have never been wilted or slimey.

The atmosphere is a bit more dim, sometimes smells like smoke, so those are the downsides. Costs more than your average pho, around $8-$9 but to me it's worth it.

If you're looking for good pho with a slight edge above the others, this place hits the spot."}
{"text":"I came to check out this place with my friend based on his recommendation and familiarity of the place. 

Pho Pasteur is a great place to try authentic Vietnamese cuisine, especially in the late hours of night, since this place is open for 24 hours. The interior design is not the strongest, as compared to its competitors, but its food makes up for the lack of restaurant style setting.

The pho broth has a body and depth in flavour. The broth was not too salty and had a lot of beef essence. There was generous amounts of beef given in my bowl , which was very satisfying. The spring rolls were one of the most delicious Vietnamese Spring Rolls I have tasted in a long time. There was generous amounts Shrimp, Pork, Taro, Fungus inside the rolls, and they were huge in its size. They are expensive, compared to other pho places, but it is worth the price, from the quantity and quality of the care they take to make the spring rolls. 

The service was very pleasant as the owners were very happy to help out with every request my friend and I had. Also, they were more pleasant to us since my friend was a frequent of this place so they knew him very well. 

Overall, Pho Pasteur is a great place if you are looking for some good homestyle Vietnamese food , as well as finding some good food for those late night cravings !"}
{"text":"I've been here way too many times at 4 AM. It's open 24 hours and it's cash only. 

Studied all night, hungry? No problem. Pho Pasteur is open.

Went partying or drinking and need something filling late at night? There's Pho Pasteur.

It's not uncommon to see groups of mildly drunk patrons frequenting this fine pho establishment. If you're lucky, you get to hear conversations ranging from the scientific of how we're one step closer to reaching Mars to the authentically profound discussion of what it means to find a true love. 

While you're waiting for your food, sip on some warm tea to soothe your stomach for the giant bowl of pho noodles and delicious beef broth you're about to ingest. 

It's a bit more expensive than your typical pho restaurant but the quality broth and hours more than make up for it in my opinion. The portions are large and the meat is sliced thin for easy consumption. All bowls come with bean sprout, culantro, mint, a single red pepper, and half a lime."}
{"text":"Worst experience I have EVER had at a restaurant. I am going to give you(yelp) a detailed review reason why. I walked into Pho at 2:20am and notice the manager who was 60 years old with a purple pony tail(by the way). Then he proceeds to take two pills out of his back pocket, takes both of them and laughs stating he has high blood pressure. This moment I noticed something was wrong. But being in Downtown Toronto this was one of the only places we could drive to get food so I had to eat it.  By the way I ordered Pork Chops, Shrimp and Rice. After I sat down it took Twenty Minutes to get my food and when I received it was COLD. So I told the manager and he told me there is no possible way my food could be cold, I need to sit down and eat the food. Calmly I grabbed my food and told him to feel the Shrimp and he could see that it's freezing cold. Then he told me I was tripping all the food is fresh and shrimp gets cold quickly. So I asked him why is all my food cold and he said \"that's impossible\". So I asked him why would I randomly say my food is could? And he can touch the shrimp or any piece of my food and if it's hot I'll give him an additional $100 he told me no. Then the manager proceeded to yell at me in another language and call me a NIGG*R. Simply the most disrespectful experience I have ever had in my life. Not once did I address him inappropriately by calling him out of his name or act ignorant. Sad part is I never once asked for my money back or my food to be recooked. All I wanted was an apology for the cold food. 

This is my first time in Toronto and this was the worst experience of my LIFE!! Please do NOT eat their. The customer service I received was terrible and should not be accepted."}
{"text":"Pho Pasteur is the place to be for late night Viet food cravings. The food is tasty and fresh. Service is quick and efficient. My boyfriend and I usually come after 11:00 PM and the only waiter during the night shift (not sure of his name) always makes our dining experience ten times better! He is very animated and seems to be genuinely enjoying his job. His vibrant personality is the most memorable detail of this restaurant and keeps us coming back. 

The only downside is that the crowd can be sketchy after midnight. Lots of drunks and individuals who .... don't seem to have it together."}
{"text":"By far the best Bun Bo Hue (#19) in Toronto... I've had this dish in numerous restaurants in Toronto and many other cities. So far haven't found any that comes close to this. Try their rice dishes too - #66 - some of the best pork chops I've had."}
{"text":"One word.....BORING.  
Food = Boring. How can you mess up on Vietnamese food. 
Service = Boring - waiter did not seem to want to be there.
Decor = Boring  and not clean 
Price = Not worth paying.  Go to McDonalds, you'll get better food there and it's cleaner."}
{"text":"OMG. This could be one of the hidden pho gems in the city. I want to be clear though, there was zero customer service in this place, it was really hard to get our waiter's attention when there were all of three tables occupied (ours included) but holy moles when our food came it hit the mark. I got the beef brisket well done and it was delicious, the broth was so hearty. Don't expect too much in terms of ambience. Again, zero points here. But if you want a good pho fix I do not hesitate to recommend this place amongst the mish mash of hit and miss restaurants in the Dundas Spadina area."}
{"text":"Authentic 24h Vietnamese spot for pho.  Efficient service, pho is good.  Only issue is slightly sketchy location means homeless ppl come wandering in at night - tip: sit facing the door."}

{"text":"Wandered around Chinatown in TO and found this 24 hr. pho place. Steady traffic of people. All happy with their food. 

My brother loved their rare beef pho and the spring rolls.

I love vermicelli. Especially pork because usually it is flavored pretty well. In the 2 days in a row we went during our 4 day vacation, we had the same things and they were consistently good. 

I loved the vermicelli. The noodles could have been a little less sticky, but the pork is so good. Plus the egg roll was delicious. 

The server was sort of neutral to us the first time (we might have been a little obnoxious), but the second night he was super friendly. There seemed to be a lot of regular customers, too. That's always a plus. 

Prices were reasonable for just entrees. Service was fast. Next time i make it to Toronto, I'll probably be here for a night or two."}
{"text":"Had the spring rolls(kinda greasy) and Sweet and Sour chicken soup. Both were good, pineapple and chili's totally made the soup. 

Other then the food, this place is great for people watching. It's amazing how many drunk people came in. FYI to get in the restaurant you PULL the door, out you PUSH"}

Very seasoned, the food has excellent flavor!
I've been once, and dream of it since, I def plan to go back when weather gets warmer though

Came back a second time and it wasn't as great as the first time,  was just OK."}
{"text":"Really? People like this place?

Found weird brown specks in my water.

Only come here if you are desperate"}
{"text":"I made my way to my regular spot, Pho Pasteur, after Susan C. claimed that the broth was back on track.  Good news, broth is back on track!  I didn't find it to be off side in the first place.

My update is similar to my original review, though for this particular visit, the noodles were pretty firm and sticky.  That's never been a problem before.  I also found a hair in my soup too, but that sort of thing doesn't bother me -- remove and continue to eat.  Am I weird?  I dunno.  I blame living in a developing country for giving me this increased tolerance for filthy food. 

3 stars for this visit, but still a 4 star place for me."}
{"text":"The service was nice with fast service and lots of candy when the bill came. Their springrolls were good but I did not enjoy the pho very much. I'm sure there are better places in the city. 
It's nice that they're always open though for late night outs!"}
{"text":"This is really a 3.5 star rating.

They are open 24-hours and give you lot a generous portion of everything if you get the beef soup house special.  The broth taste clean and was nicely seasoned.

You can tell this place knows pho because as part of the condiments plate regulars such as bean sprouts, lime, chili peppers, and thai basil, they also provide culantro.  Culantro is similar to cilantro and does get mistaken for it because they look similar.  Culantro helps to balance out the flavours of the pho by add a bit of fresh raw bitterness to soup.

I will definitely add this place to my list of late-night go-to eats."}
{"text":"Looks a little bleak on the inside, but the food is delicious and looks great on your plate!

Haven't even tried the pho- I get plates of stuff and they're just too good to switch now! #66 and #79. You won't regret it.

Friendly service and you get a lot of bang for your buck.  Open 24 hours and great after a night of drinking or the morning after!

Cash only, folks."}
{"text":"Not gonna lie, it was some of the best pho I've ever had. The owners are Vietnamese and you can tell from their pho that this is the real stuff.

However, it's pretty expensive, relative (or not) to its location in Chinatown, where everything's supposed to be cheaper. My bowl of Small Beef Pho with Beef Brisket was $7.99 (one of the cheapest on the menu). Mind you, it filled me up and I was full for hours to come, and after tax it came to $9.00. Strategic pricing indeed as you would leave a $10 bill to include tips. 

The Vietnamese condensed milk coffee + ice was $3.99, and the Grilled Pork Vermicelli was $10.99 

The food came less than 5 minutes after I had ordered. Interaction between the customer and waitress was minimal as they just give you a pencil and paper to write down what you want. 

I'm not sure if I would come here again (repelled by the price) since there are much cheaper eats across the street, but the quality is definitely worth the price. 

NOTE: as for WiFi, it was free from the Dragon City Mall next door."}
{"text":"Coming from the frozen tundra of Buffalo, I thought a 24 hour Pho spot was the stuff of dreams! That is until I stumbled in at 2 in the morning to a relatively busy restaurant en-route to my hostel. My friend with me was a vegan so there were not many friendly places for her and a huge bowl of Pho seemed like the best idea. I had the Pho with brisket and my friend had a tofu/rice platter. The waiter mistakenly brought her a huge platter of noodles and beef, then replaced it after she pointed it out. We got loads of food and two drinks for a low price! The waitstaff was wicked friendly and the Pho was soooo delicious!! I will go back as frequently as I can!!"}
{"text":"I always come here for the Bun Bo Hue. This is the only vietnamese place in Chinatown that makes close to authentic. I decided to change my usual to the grilled pork chop, it doesnt come with the traditonal steamed egg & i ordered an avacado shake for lunch. the lady there was talking shit about me at the counter because I ordered a shake for lunch. She probably didnt know I knew what she was saying. I was so disgusted. Left no tip & still talked shit in Viet when i left the restaurant. Never coming back here again. Terrible & awful thing to say about your customers. Food is pricey as well."}
{"text":"They're open 24/7 so it was convenient to grab a bite early in the morning before we flew out.

Serve time is quick. My beef stew was ok however, I preferred it w/ ho fun and had asked if I can substitute if it came w/ rice noodles instead. She said yes but my order came out to be rice noodles anyways. Not a big deal but still. Hubs ordered a Pho Dac Biet. Came w/ all sorts of things, even plastic. Yes, a piece of plastic was found in his bowl halfway through. Not too happy about that and he stopped munching.

Didn't have CAD so they were willing to take USD but at a 1:1 rate which made our meal a bit pricey."}
{"text":"The only things Pho Pasteur has going for them is the fact that they are open 24/7 and they have fast service. Other than that the quality of the pho is actually pretty poor. I ordered the raw beef and tendon pho and received 1) really tough pieces of beef, 2) minuscule amounts of tendon and 3) undercooked noodles. I think we deserve higher quality ingredients for our beloved comfort food. 

That being said the above points might not be relevant for someone who is intoxicated enough and need some warm noodles in their belly at 3am.."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of bun bo hue but the one I had here yesterday night was so spicy that I wasn't able to eat any of it without rinsing it in my boyfriends beef stew and I have a really high tolerance for spicy food already! The bowl was also unpleasantly oily.

Their tomato beef stew on the other hand was very flavourful and rich but also a bit too oily to our liking. 

Overall, try the beef stew, avoid the bun bo hue unless you can take very very very very spicy food."}
{"text":"Whew.....you eat enough pho and eventually you find one that fits. Came here late at night, it's open 24hrs, and the place still had a few patrons but seemed pretty quiet.

It's just a few yards off Spadina and tucked around the corner from pho88. Perhaps this dark and dank section of Dundas scares off the usual passerby and the store front isn't the most inviting but nothing gained if nothing ventured.

Rock solid pho place which does it the right way, quality sliced beef raw, gooey beef tendon and a slick broth just glistening with the rendered fat from the beef.

Humongous springs rolls which were decidedly not typical. Filled with taro root (wu tau) and spicy. Surprisingly delicious. Different but in a very good way.

The 'fixin's' here top any other pho place in the downtown, better than the turtle or pho tien or xe lua. The noodles were decent, a bit shredded and the broth is rich and flavorful.

Mama, If that's movin' up then I'm movin' in."}
{"text":"Order the brisket and rare pho. Broth was fat and fairly oily, that's my biggest complaint about this place (see pic). The meat wasn't very tender. The service was good and the give you a good selection of bean sprouts, coriander, basil etc. That's better than other pho places. Prices are on the higher side"}
{"text":"This is a 24 hour pho. I went after a clubbing night and the food was really good. Service was fast but it cost approximately $8 to $9 for a small bowl of pho."}
{"text":"I was quite surprised a 24/7 Pho eatery would be this good! I have been here a few times & have sampled their Pho & their rice dishes.

First time I ate here I had rice with shredded pork, porkchop, steamed egg & pickled root vegetables. The rice itself was infused with flavoured oil of some sort, the porkchops were tender juicy & most enjoyable to eat, the steamed \"egg\" had scrambled egg, & chopped pork & vermecelli mixed into it & steamed into a block shape. This classic dish I always had at various restaurants from my days of yore as a young fat kid & thus far this place wins the title of being the best in Toronto!

Some days later I went here again & had staple of all Viet restaurants, Pho with all the garnishings & various meat of different animals. The beefballs were soft, the tripes were good, & the beef was pretty flavourful thanks to the delicious soup base. Overall the pho was good but does not sway me in any way particular.

Overall this is a great 24/7 eatery & I will surely come again to revisit fat kid memories."}
{"text":"first of all, this place is open 24 hours. at a drunken 3am, almost any pho is good pho. however, this place ACTUALLY has good pho!

the sprouts are plump and crisp, the soup is steaming hot and is delicious, and the service is fast! the decor leaves a bit to be desired, but i'm not fussed about that.  

the prices are more than you'd expect to pay at a pho spot along spadina, but it's WORTH IT. the small rare beef pho is $6.99 and i feel like you get more beef, and at what seems like double the noodles... (skimping on the noodles is my #1 complaint about pho hung). the spring rolls are about $7-8, but are made to order, chock full o' goodies and fried fresh. i do not lie, the spring roll is GREAT. 

it's worth the extra $$$."}
{"text":"I have been here many times - it's cheap, good, and fast. It's a great place for a quick meal and good pho. It's also 24 hours!

Reviewed as local

As it so prominently displays on the building's facade (several times), Pho Pasteur is a Vietnamese pho restaurant that is open 24/7. Despite my general aversion to eating a proper meal somewhere that keeps the same hours as Macs / Couche-Tard, this would be the one exception. This restaurant is neatly tucked away just around the corner Dundas and Spadina.

Clientele can be a bit sketchy depending on when you go. If you're like me, you'll usually come here after the clubs have closed, usually well into the early AMs. Place is usually fairly full, though never truly packed. The wait staff is pretty non-descript with one very notable exception: a flamboyantly colourful waiter who always seems to get the late shift (at least when I go). While I always enjoy his presence, he was absent on our most recent trip: I hope he's ok.

The food is consistently good (especially if nothing else is open): The quality of the noodles and broth is great and their shrimp summer rolls are fresh. The stand out dish to go for is the Pho Tai Hoac Sate (Beef rice noodle soup with satay beef) or #3 (you can also get with beef balls or #4). However, make sure you specify that you want Satay on the order otherwise you will just get the standard Pho broth (I made that mistake and was sorely disappointed).

Made a point to come here with my wife out of a sense of nostalgia on our last trip. Food was good as I remember even though I was sober this time, so feel confident providing an accurate review."}
{"text":"After a beer-filled event, we headed over to Pho Pasteur for some eats.
It was pretty tasty, I had pho with beef, tripe and brisket.  Not soapy tasting at all.  And they had fortune cookies and sweets.

I ordered some take out for the BF, some vermicelli noodles with grilled chicken.  He seemed to enjoy it.  

I was happy with the quality and flavour of pho.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Located in Chinatown, this place is okay for a late night eat. The service and food is horrible. I don't know why this place is even popular pho place when the pho isn't even good. Literally this place is just full with drunk college students after coming from the club and saying how great this place is... 

The whole place is dingy looking, tables are dirty, pho is far below average, and the waitress is rude. Definitely will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Mindblowing? No. Good? Yes.

Pho Pasteur's kind of the go to place you tend to hear about if someone's thinking of Pho. It think it's more a name recognition thing than anything else, maybe it's just that it easily sticks in people's heads and it's just simple to remember. But while the ambience is nothing special the food comes out quickly and it's pretty tasty."}
{"text":"I went here once after getting off work at 4am and all my usual pho haunts bejng closed. Pho was so-so, but for 5:30am and the place being mostly empty, it was just what the doctor ordered and the service was awesome. Worth it if the other places aren't open. I've only gone once, so not enough to make a fair overall assessment.

Nov.1/2015

Visited for a second time as was deliriously hungry having not eaten for 12 hours and my usual was closed, and again, this is what the doctor ordered. Pho was better this time (although with so much time between visits, it's tough to be able to know exactly how much better) and the rolls were delicious. Ordered extra noodle and wow, did they ever load on the noodles! Almost too much, I would have liked more broth, but they definitely didn't skimp! Service is still very friendly.

Only point against is that the prices are way too high on the appetizers...almost double what they are for the same thing on other places. I ordered pork skin rolls and they were $7.50/$7.95 as opposed to $4-4.50 anywhere else. That's a steep increase. I thought that the reason for this may have been that they give you 4 instead of 2 rolls, but it's not the case. They were delicious, but all the apps seem to be at least $2-3 more here, so be prepared to pay for the equivalent of two mains if ordering an app. 

Still, it's worth the trip. Pho is the best food there is!"}
{"text":"only thing good about this place is that it is 24 hours. 

We came here after a night out since it was the only place that was open. We walked in and it was pretty packed with dirty dishes everywhere. The server told us it will be 20 min wait. So we asked we can seat separately since there was a table for 4 and table for 2 open and he was like really confused then finally let us sit. 

Here, you write your own order down...then you give it to them...then you get your food with the noodles hangout of the bowl. The food is decent but I can only give them 2 star due to the HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE service and the cleanliness of the restaurant"}
{"text":"Pho Pasteur, which is turns out has no relation to the American chain I know from Boston, is a high quality Pho restaurant off Dundas.  

The FOOD:  Now, with Vietnamese pho places, you are not there for fancy tablecloths or flowers on the table or waitstaff that write your order down...you're there for that Vietnamese breakfast stable (which we always eat at night in N. America), pho.  This place does a mean pho with a nice hearty broth that's appropriately clear in color but thoroughly rich.  They've spent some time making this before serving it out.  It also comes loaded down with a hearty does of meat and noodles.  Much less skimpy than Pho Hung.

We also had a tasty chicken noodle dish.  These dishes are served in a  pretty basic way...as in Vietnam, if's your own job to spice the dish up to taste with an assortment of table side hot sauces, sriracha, lime, mint leaves, etc.  Portions are generous at the very least.

The SERVICE:  We had a friendly, slightly shy, server taking care of us.  She was actually quite sweet and insisted I take a fortune cookie after my meal.  Again, compared to the super-popular Pho Hung, I got the distinct sense that this restaurant appreciated my business.  

The AMBIANCE:  Well, it's a simple cheap ethnic restaurant....you're here for the cheap and tasty food.  In fact, you should be happy the tables and chairs are cheap, because that means they don't have to skimp on the food to make money.

OVERALL, this is definitely one of the top three Pho places I've been to in Toronto.  I'll definitely be back.  The price for dinner for two with no drinks ran to $26 with tax and tip...it's a little high for a pho place, but you're paying for a higher quality than many of its neighbors."}
{"text":"This 24 hours restaurant is one of the best pho i found in downtown for late night. I mostly get beef pho and although not amazing, it is good enough for post-drinking food. 

Their service is pretty decent considering how understaffed they are. Although servers are a bit too slow, but they are always nice

If you haven't tried yet, I would also recommend their spring rolls. These are not the typical skinny spring rolls you find in many restaurants. Instead, they are very thick and have lots of ingredients. 

Like many places in Chinatown, this restaurant do not accept cards, so make sure you bring enough cash."}
{"text":"It was down and dirty pho. Sometimes this is a good thing, but what bugs me is I don't know why everyone raves so much about this place. 

The broth was good, not over or under seasoned, but for me that's just what I expect from traditional cooking. You gotta really be out of it to screw up something perfected over many generations.

I'm taking it down a star for reasons of relativity. It's not the best pho in town, let alone even china town.

Looking downtown? Golden turtle shows more creativity."}
{"text":"Despite what I said in my last review about not having any pressing need to come back here... I did... and was pretty impressed.

As I said before, there isn't anything too special about the pho here - it's fairly standard for Chinatown pho and it's pricier than other places...

HOWEVER...

I had Bun bo Hue here.  It was legit and good bun bo Hue.

For those who don't know, bun bo Hue (BBH) is similar to pho - but the version from the imperial central Vietnamese city of Hue (if you travel north-south through Vietnam, you'll find huge variance in 'common' Vietnamese dishes - most of what we have in North America is southern Vietnamese).  It uses a thicker rice noodle (similar to spaghetti) and the broth is spicier (usually red) and is a better balance of spice, sour, salt and sweet (similar to Thai).  Furthermore, rather than the usual pho toppings - BBH usually has some combination of beef shank, oxtail, pig knuckle, ham and cubes of congealed pig blood.

From the description, it sounds gross.  But let me tell you this: BBH is the highest form of Vietnamese noodle soup.  When done right, it's downright transcendental.  I've compared it as culinary heroin.  It balances all the flavours and has a great range of textures.  It's a full meal in a bowl.

Unfortunately, it is also amazingly easy to fuck up.  BBH to Vietnamese food is what xiao long bao (soup dumplings) to Chinese food -- in it's true form, it's mind-blowing -- but every restaurant sells a watered down, inferior copycat version.

Outside of Vietnam, I've found *one* place that serves proper BBH - a tiny hole in the wall in Vancouver that specializes in BBH (they literally only have BBH and appetizers on the 'menu').  Much like XLB, you usually have to go to a specialist to get a decent version.

I occasionally get cravings for this culinary heroin and not knowing any good BBH joints in Toronto, I cave in and order it sometimes at your run of the mill Viet joint and they serve me a shitty, stepped-on BBH.  Usually just your standard pho but they use round noodles, just beef shanks and they throw some chili oil in the broth.  I really can't hate on them for offering variety and trying - but it sucks and always leaves me unsatisfied.

Well - I have to say that Pho Pasteur serves up a pretty damned good BBH (for a non-specialist).  The broth was sufficiently spicy and flavourful and they included the oxtail, Vietnamese ham, pig knuckle and blood.  It was lacking banana blossom - but very few place have it.

Anyways - upgrading Pho Pasteur to 4-stars for the tasty, tasty BBH offering.  Far from the best I've had, but the best I've had thusfar in Toronto."}
{"text":"A new city but same old Pho. I wouldn't consider myself a pho expert but after tasting home made pho at a friend's...all other phos that I've tasted in restaurants have failed to meet my taste buds expectations with their commercialized flavors. This restaurant was just like the rest...the only appeal was that it's open 24 hrs which would be quite convenient if you live in Toronto. 

The place was actually quite clean ( even the restrooms) and the staff was friendly. You might be wondering why this place earned only 2 stars from me, since the food was alright and the place was clean.  It's because they don't accept $100 bills!!! I was so shocked when she said she wouldn't take it. There were a lot of us eating so our bill came up to around $50 something....you would thing they would have change for that. Apparently at 1pm ( which is the time we ate there), they don't."}
{"text":"I needed to see what the hype was about. I went to Pho Pasteur many many many years ago post-clubbing, and surprisingly, wasn't very good.

However, recently, there was a huge hype for this place, so fellow Yelper, Ian L., and I went to go check it out after a long day of gruelling work on a long weekend. 

I had the Beef Rice Noodle with Brisket, Tendon, and Tripe (because I absolutely love tripe).  We had determined that all the ingredients were quite fresh, and that the noodles - REALLY good. However, the broth was a bit more on the greasier side -- but quite flavourful.

My friend also had the avocado milkshake - typical stuff.

However, one BIG downfall of this place was the PRICE. NOT used to seeing Pho being THAT expensive. I can go down the street to Pho Hung for some delicious pho that would be around half the price."}
{"text":"I just had a bowl of Pho Gha with extra vegetable (2$++) and a glass of orange juice. Super tasty. I like the fact that it opens 24/7, clean and quick services."}
{"text":"Y'all ain't even right on Toronto Yelp.  Like, when did this site take off, last week?  Why hello web 1.0; how nice to see you again!  ANYWAY, this pho is sub-par.  Broth is not particularly flavorful, noodles are just decent, meat is fatty... Despite the fact that they do have that extra perilla (Dieterle, holla!), thoroughly unimpressive.  Skip it."}
{"text":"Came here for my pho fix a few times after a friend recommended it to me.  Ordered the special beef rice noodle soup which was very yummy (excellent soup base, tasty noodles, good meat).  

Love how the place is open late for the late night crowd.

I hear the non-pho dishes are the best here!  Will come back to try those next time!


Edit :   Once again came here to one of the best pho places in Toronto, and one of the few open 24/7.

Tonight we ordered 02. Chicken Rice Noodle Soup (small) and 78. Spring Roll, Grilled Pork Chop w. Vermicelli.

The Chicken Rice Noodle Soup was very delicious, the last time I had this noodle soup done well was at the vietnamese restaurant in downtown Kingston, Ontario.  This one was even better.  Would have liked the chicken more soft, but otherwise the taste was perfect."}
{"text":"Portions are massive. Ordered the rare and well done brisket pho. Came with a literal mountain of beef. 

Similar to what's been said before , service was pretty minimal. But the pho makes up for this. 

Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Visited Pho Pasteur because it was late enough that the other pho restaurants we know of were closed. I was not let down! I ordered the pho ga and was surprised at how generous they were with the meat. We also ordered the vegetarian spring rolls which were just okay. The dish had 8 spring rolls, which was a bit too many and pricier that I wanted. 

While I've had better pho than this place, the appeal is it's open 24-7 so I would definitely return in the future."}
{"text":"Good ol' Pho Pasteur, you never changed after so many years. Had been coming to this place ever since I was still in school and and always in downtown. My cousin had found out this place and we both decided to try it out years ago.  And up until 2017 it's still good as I remember. 

This place goes unnoticed as it isn't along Spadina, its slightly West on Dundas but its a small shop and nearby an alley parking area. (Sounds sketchy?) Right along that part of Dundas it is the more not-so-nice to say part of Chinatown, it looks more old not as revitalized as some store fronts along Spadina. But that being said, usually the gross and more ghetto looking places are usually the prime places that have good food! And I have to say this is one of them. 

Very authentic vietnamese food here. Their portions are pretty big as well. I ordered take out that time and when I opened the box the box was packed! I had ordered the chicken vermicelli and they just loaded the entire box up. So much chicken as well as noodles and salad. They don't cheap out in the portions and their pricing is very reasonable as well. 

Big portions at a decent price is a winner. Always great quanity and quality here. This place is open 24/7 too! How they do it? Beats me...? But if I was ever in the area late night I know I could always count on this place to be open because they never close. 

Only critique about this place is, they need to renovate... its looking very dated and old."}
{"text":"I remember trying this place out with my father, and we both agreed the pho was not pleasant at all. Not the correct fragrance or flavour at all (or lack of). The meat and vegetable quality was not good either. Their restaurant itself is very petite. The only good thing was that the staff were very friendly."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place as when I walked it most of the people where Vietnamese, but I found the food to be mediocre at best. I ordered the vermicelli as that is one of my go to's at pho places, but the noodles tasted like they were instant noodles and the spring roll tasted like it was fake meat. For a location that is in the heart of china town it needs to much better and serve better food. 

This place is open 24 hours so that is a bonus, but unless you go her after a night of partying I would say stay away."}
{"text":"Pretty typical Vietnamese place. The beef noodle soup is tasty but it isn't all that hard to mess it up. It's a good post bar/club location especially on your way back to the Annex.
Cheap and cheerful."}
{"text":"This place looks greeeezyyyy.. sticky tables, drunkies drinking beer near the front, \"pasteur\" just sounds f&*%ed up too. 

BUT

the food is GOOD HERE. More pricy then other vietnamese restaurants in chinatown, but hey.. its 24 hours! Electricity bill must be ridiculous keeping that stove on ALL DAY LONG!"}
{"text":"Not that consistent it depends what time you go and the cook's mood.If you are some neat freak this place is not for you!  There is time I go there  and very impressed with the dishes. I like the signature pho, the broth is solid and also they are very generous with the meat. The best part is the thinly sliced habanero pepper in macerated in the white vinegar. It is so fruity and elevates the dish big time,super refreshing. The spring roll is big portion great appetizer for two. I found there are a few times I went late at night the quality of the food is not as good. But opening 24 hours is a big commitment. I would rather go in earlier when the cook is happier food taste a lot better.  I recommend the pho; spring rolls and goat curry."}
{"text":"Just landed in Toronto and friend recommended we eat here (since I'm Asian I guess?).  The place was packed which is always a good sign. The downside was that it took forever for the food to get out since, as the server kept mentioning, they only had one cook in the back while the place was packed. We had to wait quite a bit for our food to come out but it wasn't really that big of an issue.

Ordered their Durian shake which was awesome. I can tell it wasn't that powdered one that they mix with water or whatever. This tasted like it was made fresh from the actual fruit. Their eggrolls weren't anything to write home about. Not a big fan of it to be honest. Ordered their number 69 which was some kind of mixed meat rice plate. Had baked shrimp, some sort of egg monstrosity and a porkchop. Overall it wasn't that bad but as with all the other stuff I go (besides the shake), it was average."}
{"text":"Be warned.  This is not the Pho Pasteur anymore you once knew. Seems like it's a different owner now. 

Long story short, I got a piece of steel scrub scrap in my bowl.

** update **
It turns out I got food poisoned from that bowl of pho. I had a series of terrible stomach aches and eventually needed a thorough medical attention. 

What a mess."}
{"text":"Great for a flavourful light after club meal. Delicious and nutritious without the heartburn and the feeling of being full the next morning."}
{"text":"VIBE
So I confess. This is the first time I've had a sit down pho meal. I never grew up on pho, so I guess I didn't know what I was missing. That said, gat damn those bowls are huge. I can't eat it all in one sitting.  We came here at about 2 p.m. in the afternoon on a Friday so there wasn't really a \"vibe.\"  It was mainly the staff and maybe another table of four. But I have a feeling this is a university hot spot. It's also 24 hours.  Hey oh! That's always good if you're wanting a late night Vietnamese fix. Ah, gotta love the options we have in the T Dot. Service is very friendly and quick.  Décor is as you would expect in Chinatown:  simple table cloths and the obligatory Buddha somewhere. 

WE ATE
My three dining companions had the beef pho. A small bowl is huge. A medium bowl is MASSIVE. One of our dining companions was SWEATING through his meal! I had the goat curry on vermicelli. It's not too spicy (I think you can add the heat if you want) and it's mega hearty. I hardly made a dent in my bowl and I was stuffed! The bone is still on the goat and there's a lot of carrot in there as well. I think you can also get French baguette with it, but I didn't get any (bummer).  It's a great left-over meal for the next day or if you're ravenous at 3 a.m. on a Saturday night.

{"text":"The generous teepee of fresh bean sprouts, bouquets of basil, plump little red hot chili peppers, juicy lime quarters, and even a mystery celery-like herb was the first sign that Pho Pasteur wasn't like the rest of 'em. My seafood pho ($7.50) came chock full of extra large tail-on meaty shrimp, delicately scored bite-sized pieces of squid, imitation crab meat, and tons of chewy fish balls. Everyone else's assorted thinly sliced beef and tender chunks of tendons were reported to be done just right. The rice noodles themselves were thin and not mushy. The broth was flavourful before and after my hoisin and hot sauce massacre.

The service was prompt and friendly. It was late on a weekday, but quite a few tables were actually filled. They were great about constantly refilling our teapot that was emptying out with every other round of pouring for five thirsty people. The air conditioning blasting from above was a little strong at first, but there were no more complaints once the piping hot bowls of pho came and we didn't break into the usual beads of noodle sweats."}
{"text":"My go to pho place downtown. They don't use MSG. I know this because I am super sensitive to MSG and will have symptoms 30 mins after I eat something with MSG. I also get my pho without noodles and the lady there is so sweet as she gives me extra veggies.

The only beef (ha! pun intended) is that when I order rare beef, I don't get rare beef, the beef comes cooked. But it doesn't bother me too much as the broth is amazing.

My 2 go tos are the rare beef pho and the pho with the grilled pork chop which is heaven!"}
{"text":"3am. It's late, and you've stumbled into Chinatown. If you can't make it a block further north, this is probably the ONLY time you should come here. 

Just to give it a fair shot, I came here a few weeks ago on a regular Thursday night. I felt bad because a buddy had passionately defended the place so much the night before.

Pho was mediocre at best. I ordered the Dac Biet Special. Too much noodle to broth ratio, and the meat was fatty. I actually didn't even finish the bowl! 

Also ordered some spring rolls. They were decent, but still very greasy. I do like the fact that they use taro in the filling. Still, I would say these were average, but for the price?!  $9.00 is extortion!

True to my original conclusion, you have to be half in the bag to make it through the meal. It's still okay to turn back, you've probably made enough bad decisions for one night!"}
{"text":"Pretty average pho place but whatever... at least I'm full. Accidentally ordered the #8 which was mostly fat, but that's my bad. Broth is alright and sooooo many noodles. But like I said though, I'm full and satisfied, and I guess that's what matters."}
{"text":"This place is open 42/7 great for that afyer drinking meal. A bit more expensive than usual but they put lots of meat in it. Its a great alternative to the oyher pho places."}
{"text":"I'd heard so many reviews about Pho Pasteur being the best in the city, both from friends and online reviews I had read, so I had to check it out. I had other Pho restaurants among my favourites before but I am always scouring for the city's best Pho, so definitely wanted to give this place a fair try. From the outside this restaurant is complete no frills, and though 99% of the Pho restaurants out there aren't anything fancy, somehow the ambiance of this place made me a bit hesitant at the outset. Something about this venue struck me as being a bit more \"unclean\" from other Pho venues; maybe it's the \"open 24 hour\" factor or the location, either way, something about it just turned me off a bit but I went into it with an open mind. 

A bit more pricey than other local Pho venues, and the portions are not larger by any means. I ordered the chicken pho and an avocado shake, my significant other the rare beef. Although yes, I do have to say that there is a lot more meat in the pho, I was very disappointed with the quality of the chicken in my dish. My bowl was filled with skin and cartilage, so even though by looking at the portion it seems like they are giving you more meat with your pho, it's a bit misleading to say the least. The rare beef was good as was the avocado shake, but the standard chicken pho was quite disappointing.

I gave Pho Pasteur a second try when my significant other brought takeout home for the both of us, both chicken pho this time. We were both disappointed with the dish, again the same complaint - lots of chicken skin/cartilage. 

People have raved about the broth and this being the best in the city, as well as the best bowl of Pho you will ever have. I would beg to differ; I've had much better broth at other fares, and better qualtiy of meat as well. On the plus side, it's 24 hours, so if you do need to fix that hankering for Pho at 4am, this is the place to go. No frills and open around the clock. Would I go back? If late night and my other picks were closed, then yes (but I would avoid the chicken pho). During normal hours, I would definitely choose another venue over this one. Not the best pho in the city in my opinion."}
{"text":"I'm basing my review on the pho I received.
The pho actually had flavour which I did not expect from a 24 hour restaurant.
The portions was fitting to the price.
BUT@@@
The rice here is terrible.  It's honestly something I could have done at home & been better.  The beef in the beef & rice combo does not look like beef.. It looks like dried pork???

The restaurant is relatively clean and bright.

*Sidenote: The guy who manages the place does seem to get confused as he delivered the wrong items to our table twice that was meant for another table."}
{"text":"I don't really get why many claim this is the best Viet/best pho place in downtown Toronto. It certainly is not a favourite of mine!

Yes, the pho is HUGE. But you pay more. So it's same-same!

Both times I've been here there have been gross fruit flies all over the damn restaurant. I know, Viet places aren't especially known for extreme cleanliness to begin with, but this is the only place I can remember there being swarms of fruit flies on repeat visits.

I prefer Ahn Dao on Spadina or Pho Canh Buom at College/Dufferin. Not that either specifically have better PHO, but overall service and menu variety is better."}
{"text":"Best pho in Toronto, worst Pho in Toronto, most mediocre Pho in Toronto!
It seems like opinions vary more drastically than usual when it comes to what is offered at the Pasteur! I'm not an expert when it comes to Pho, but I have to say the broth served by Pasteur definitely brings a smile to my face! I personally prefer a broth that is complex, smooth, and yet not overly strong in any one sense and Pasteur seems to achieve that with a rich broth that is not too salty, spicy, or otherwise and allows flavor incorporation from the add ons. 
The most popular choice is the rare beef pho, which is indeed very tasty. The price difference between a small and large is very minuscule, but in my experience the large will feed about two people!

I've only tried the BBQ pork vermicelli and spring rolls from the non-pho items, and while the spring roll was one of the tastiest I've had in a while, the pork dish was not very impressive.

Overall recommended with the understanding that consistency of the broth is co-dependent on many factors that may vary after the date this review was written! Chances are you will love it!"}
{"text":"Saltiest soup I've ever had in my life and poor service- they wouldn't take back the soup!"}
{"text":"For pho, probably the best I've had on the east coast. No MSG broth and incredibly beefy taste. Urban legend is that the broth was brought over from Vietnam and has constantly been added to and never stopped boiling. (This is probably not true but great urban legend anyway.)

I'd have given it 5 stars if it weren't for the consistency of the Pho Broth.  The first few times was amazing.  The last time I went (probably about a year later) i thought it wasn't as good.  

Their spring rolls are also incredibly tasty (they are the big fat ones.. not the minature versions).

Nevertheless, a really solid Pho place and best of all, it was open till late... like real late.  A great place to go to when you have a 2am hankering for Pho."}
{"text":"Remains a good value place for a constantly good pho, rapidly served and with fresh ingredients and nice staff.

Only disappointment is the brisket beef, often too fatty, chewy or thick and hard to chew."}
{"text":"There was a worker with a insect spray can spraying the front door. 

Get inside the restaurant at around 11pm and theres quite a few people eating. And there's like a bunch of flies flying around.

But the pho is really tasty, the broth is legit. 24 hours is a nice gimmick.

I wouldn't come back unless they get rid of the flies tho."}
{"text":"Really?  This is the best Vietnamese place in town??  The pho was good, but everything else seemed... meh.

I ordered pho tai and it was great.  They don't pull tight with the meat, and it is delish.  And I loved that they autoserve you a pot of hot jasmine tea when you come in.

However, the cha giò was... weird.  I have been known to eat these spring rolls like a wood chipper going through logs.  This is the first time I took a bite of cha giò and didn't want any more.  I'm not sure, but my (Vietnamese) consort theorizes that they use wonton wrappers instead of rice paper.  I dunno, but something makes the texture really strange and not crispy.  Do not want.

And what's up with using cubes of ice instead of crushed ice in 3 bean dessert drinks??  Argghhhh.

All in all, it wasn't horrible, but it was the least tasty meal I had in Toronto.  And I had 2 meals at Tim Horton's, so that's saying something."}
{"text":"Great cheap convenient and various sizes of pho-- you can get a small medium OR large--- small is enough!
Generous with sprouts, basil, fixings etc
Fast and hits the spot every time
Was good 10 years ago and still is
Delicious!"}
{"text":"Pho Pasteur has all your pho cravings covered any time of the day, provided you have cash. My friend and I came after a night shift, ravenous. I ordered a number 6 large (I'm a sucker for brisket), an avocado shake, and we shared a lemongrass pork and rice. Broth is rich and flavourful, meat is delicious, noodles gliding into the mouth effortlessly, portions generous---what more can two famished souls with a major hankering for pho ask for? Recommended."}
{"text":"Maybe it's that I was having it at 6am, and delirious from overnight Greyhound induced sleep deprivation, but I think this is my favorite bowl of Pho in the city. I had the brisket and tripe, and it was perfection. I will most definitely be back, at any time during the 24 hour period in which this gem finds itself open."}
{"text":"Did I really just spent $20 in a pho restaurant? But all I did was order a bowl of  pho and vietnamese coffee....

I walked in and there's one old asian man wiping a nasty spill on a large table. Did the table look clean after he wiped it? No. But he gave me that table to sit anyway.

I asked for a cold vietnamese coffee while I waited for my friend, it never came.

My friend and I ordered two bowls of pho and my coffee, but didn't put down the size. He never asked us what size and just served the medium. We didn't find out until the bill came.

Towards the end of the meal, I asked for my coffee again. It finally came. Waaaaaaay too sweet.

The bill came and it was $26. $8.75 for the medium pho (we wanted the small), and $5.50 for the coffee. Yes you read right FIVE DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS for coffee that came too late and was too sweet.

The broth for the pho was good, but not $8.75 good.

Definitely not coming back."}
{"text":"As a youngin' who spent a good deal of time in Viet communities, I roll deep in Pho, and let me tell you, I can tell a good bowl when I see it. This my friends, is a damn good bowl to be had. 

The broth is beautifully rich and perfume-y, the noodles, perfectly prepped with the right kind of bite. The ladies here saw me come here almost every day when I was in Toronto this summer, so they were extra nice to me. Also, I find that any place willing to give you a nice heaping pile of bean sprouts and herbs, along with the sawtooth herb is pretty legit. Their Bun Bo Hue is really tasty as well, although I can't speak for their other food offerings. I literally just couldn't get enough of the pho. Yes, it's more expensive than your average bowl, but their sizes run extra large and are always filled with tons of tasty meat morsels and that broth is worth every damn penny. Also, 24 hour pho? 

Oh HELL yes."}
{"text":"Just came from this garbage hole 15mins ago. There were 2 seated customers in the whole restaurant. We were ready to order but the waiter kept running around cleaning tables and ignoring us. The older waiter just looked at us. Finally ordered #18 and #13 medium. Based on reviews, portions are huge??? Ours were not, few pieces of meat and small amount of noodles. The fresh shrimp role $8 were nice and dry. Noticed a Caucasian couple leaving and was thanked numerous times for coming, etc... When we left there was silence, no thank you or bye or see you next time. The only good thing about this place is that it's open 24hrs. Obviously not coming back. But if you're white, please come again."}
{"text":"We came here twice and had very different experiences. The first time we ate here, it was very empty (we were basically the only people there). We ordered and shared a large pho (#1 on the menu) as we weren't too hungry and had plans for dinner already. The pho tasted great and the meat to noodle ratio was just right. The experience was quite good so we went back again about a week later. This time, it was busier, and we did not have as great as an experience. We sat down, and there were menus/pens/checks on every table, basically it seemed like we were supposed to write down the order ourselves...I did that, no one came by, so I went up to the cashier to hand in the check. Didn't really mind, however, what bothered me was when the food came and I noticed how dirty the bowls were. Also this time, the beef was either completely overcooked (almost inedible) or it was almost raw...the soup didn't seem hot enough to cook the beef. After our second experience, I do not think we will return to this establishment. There are so many pho places in Toronto...I know there must be a better one than this."}
{"text":"Can you really expect much from a 24hrs pho restaurant? I am glad i went in with zero expectations! Portions are big, service was ok, food was very meh. Noodles were very choppy and a bit too soggy. Spring rolls were no good! Probably wouldn't come here again unless I was very desperate."}
{"text":"Pasteur is another Pho joint in Chinatown with the typical decor and service. They have a very extensive menu. They are open 24 hours, should you need a pho fix late into the night. They serve their pho piping hot, in generous portions, and all the trimmings come fresh. The couple of times that I've had Pasteur, I can honestly say that the quality was consistent (not fantastic), and they never jibbed me out of meat. This is something I can't say for other Pho establishments. The prices do seem a bit higher than next door but they are nothing outrageous."}
{"text":"Pho Pasteur does NOT serve the Best Pho in Toronto! But at 3 in the morning and you are hungry and no other Vietnamese restaurants are open in the wee hours.. this is the BEST Pho one can get!! 

Up in the boring suburbs where I live, there are not many places that are open 24 hours/7 aside from MacDonald's and Tim Hortons.. and what do you do when you wake up in the middle of the night and you are hungry.. and do you want a Big Mac? Not really, I rather just starve.... 

Pho with Rare Beef ($7.99) small 
- compare to what I been paying in Scarborough where a small is $5.99 that's definitely a lot pricier.. (yes I need to get over it! It is DT, not Scarbrough!) 
- Broth is well flavoured and has this salty rich meaty taste.. the more you drink, the more you get thirsty! :) 
- Noodles are the dried type, but cooked proper with no funny taste 
- Size wise is decent.. a small size is great as a midnight snack! 

Services here is fast and efficient.... my request for extra fresh chili peppers were fulfilled and he got me 3 extra large one!! Those were so spicy, and brought tears of joy to my eyes! 

Pho Pasteur probably would not be my choice Vietnamese Pho joint if others in the area are opened... but it would be the best choice if nothing else are open!! 

CASH Only!"}
{"text":"The pho and food here is marginally better than Xe Lua, but the prices are way higher. You get some questionable people coming here from time to time though but everyone minds their own business. The service is usually good and don't be afraid to wave them down if you need something. They tend to leave you alone to eat."}
{"text":"One night, my 24-hour Pho Train (Xe Lua) was closed for unknown reasons, and we had to find somewhere else that was open at 1 am. I've walked past Pho Pasteur probably millions of times in my life, and I've usually been kind of intimidated by it because it looks sketchy as hell, but this night, we gave it a chance.

Eh. I wasn't really taken aback by it. It is definitely more expensive - every dish is at least $1 or $2 more than what it would be at Xe Lua or Pho Hung. So my pho wasn't cheap this time. And it wasn't really good either. I personally hate when there are fatty or stringy cuts of meat, and most of the meat here ended up in my napkin. Besides that, the spring rolls were too greasy and the broth was just OK. 

I did notice that they had more options of herbs to put in your broth, but that didn't really make it taste better.

My final verdict on this place: It's OK if nothing else is open. Besides that, I'd go elsewhere."}
{"text":"One of the better pho places downtown"}
{"text":"Pretty good Pho, the brisket is very tender and the soup didn't leave me too thirsty. I got #14 but I think I'd skip the shoulder next time and get #17.

Service: None, it's not that kind of place
Price: Okay (S $9.75, M $10.50, L $11.75)
Taste: Okay to Good
Uniqueness: None"}
{"text":"I couldn't stop drinking the broth, it was delicious!
Decent pho overall. Sort of authentic. 
Salty as the ocean. MSG, maybe? 
Giant bowls. (Medium is huge, Large is super huge!) 
Very filling.
Relatively clean, for a Chinatown cafeteria style eatery. 
Medium quality ingredients.
Vietnamese staff. Friendly and helpful. 

Taste was quite good, elevating Pho Pasteur  to 4 stars!"}
{"text":"Decent, passable, tastes legit, but not ultra great."}
{"text":"Wonderful, unpretentious, go-to spot for flavourful, fresh pho (#13 is my fave). Having also gone to Golden Turtle, Pho Hung and Pho 88 a lot, this one is the winner in the area.

Their spring rolls and bunh thit nuong are quite good as well, although on the latter we run into some less-than-tender pork once in a blue moon. Great mì bò kho and avocado \"milk shakes\", although they don't seem to have much to do with milk; they're more like smoothies (and that's not a complaint.)"}
{"text":"Food was ok, nothing special.

The smell was horrible though. There was a garbage smell coming from the kitchen! Not even from the bathroom. The bathroom surprisingly smelled fine. But the restaurant smelled horrible instead of smelling like food or broth."}
