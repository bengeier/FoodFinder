{"text":"Great food, great price. Can't beat a 1/4 chicken dinner with rice, potatoes and salad for $6!"}
{"text":"It was a great disappointment. Should've just gone to Subway.  I honestly went here to try out Karine's and unfortunately it just happened to be closed that day because of a family emergency. So I decided to try them out since it was on the opposite side. Turns out that they were halal (had to ask) and I hadn't had gryos in a while so I said why not and went for their $4.99 \"super special\" (without tax) which included potatoes, rice, salad and gryos.  Sounds great but the potatoes was actually just one small baked potato cut into half (each half could've been eaten in one bite) with no taste. Rice was bland! I'm pretty sure they just added a yellow color to it for the sake of it. They gave me a small amount of Tzatziki sauce which actually brought the plate to life but it couldn't save it. Salad options given to me were either black beans, cabbage thing, and some beet thing so I chose the cabbage thinking it would be like coleslaw- it tasted a lot more like cabbage dipped in vinegar and tossed in black pepper.  The actual gyros was good compared to the rest actually so that's something and the person did give me an okay amount of it so it wasn't too bad.   I opted to not to take out because i thought they'd give bigger portions but in fact i got a smaller amount then those who got the take out. Plus there's this barrier of stuff so you can't see what the hell they're doing to your plate. Overall, I finished still hungry and very unsatisfied and mostly filled with regret. I ended up buying a can of soda for another $1 to fill me up because the whole thing leaves you quite thirsty.   So for a final of $6.65, i say i really should have thought twice. Even a hotdog and fries from a stand nearby would've been way better. Try something else, this isn't worth it."}
{"text":"Exceptional value, great taste. Ignore Vivian's review. She clearly has no idea what spanakopita or gyro meat is, so why is she even reviewing a Greek food place?"}
{"text":"ONLY 3 stars for this amazing place?!! Yelp sometimes disappoints me so badly :( This place is amazing! I have been here more than 8 times and their food is always delicious. They have vegan/vegetarian options that change every time, their gyros is delicious, so is their moussaka. They also have meatballs in tomato sauce, lamb shanks, fish, and many other options. Their specials are $4.99 for a whole meal! Recently I have been getting their gyros special a lot which comes with rice, potatoes, choice of beets or cabbage salad, and an amazing garlicy yogurt sauce. Where in Toronto can you get a delicious meal for only $4.99?! The food tastes homemade, and the place is at the center of a food court. Not a fancy place to eat, but it is perfect for take out. The staff are nice and they recognize you after going once or twice. My fiance told them that I make moussaka sometimes at home, and the next time I went there the owner asked me what I thought about their moussaka dish! I have seen a lot of people who are regulars here, people who love Souvlaki House's food. I just wished more people could review this place so their rating would not go down because of one person's bad experience. This place deserves way better than this.  Tips: I personally think their beets option is better than the coleslaw. Their soups are good (you can get it for $1 if you order their regular food) They don't take credit cards: Just debit or cash. I especially recommend their gyros special; so flavorful!"}
{"text":"Food court style service.  It's very cheap. 5.99 for a meal at the time of posting.  Rice is very wet and watery.  Potato's are very wet and bland. Gyros flavorful but it's been left steaming.  Chickpea is okay nothing special but good enough.   Value wise I'll rate it a 4. But I'm rating it purely on taste. It's quite average and some of items are below average."}
{"text":"What a DISAPPOINTMENT. The lady serving the food had so much attitude.. maybe she was having a bad day? Then I proceed to the cash register and the man behind the cash was worse!!!!! He asked me if I had cash and I politely said no. He charged me a credit card transaction fee without letting me know first and then gives me attitude about how it's \"always been like this\". I'm sorry?! I was supposed to know this? To make things even worse, the food wasn't good at all. I'll never return again. Don't ever eat here!!!!"}
{"text":"absolutely dreadful ... i decided to give this place a try because the food looked REALLY GOOD and also there's usually a lot of people who come here so i was like WHY THE HELL NOT  the first time i went here i got this gyro thing. i have NOO idea what meat it was (actually i don't even know if it was meat; it looked like a sausage but it didn't TASTE like a sausage... my brain and tastebuds are hella confused) all i know was... IT TASTES WEIRD AND BAD. every bite of that thing was a huUGE regret  i was starving today after 3 hours of a studio class so i had to refuel with SOME FOOD OTHER THAN MCDONALDS AND MY OCCASIONAL TIMMYS BLUEBERRY MOOFFIN. i have been eyeing this round looking piece of bread looking thing for a while now so i was like okay les get it. it was $3.5 and you know i expected it to be filled with some kind of meat or something BUT NO I THINK ITS LIKE SOME KIND OF VEGETABLE its black and IDK but man it tastes weird... not as bad as the gyro but still bad LOL im sorry but this place seriously didn't do me justice (I didn't feel too well after eating it and I can't really tell if it stank or not but this dude moved away from me on the subway LOOOL)  unfortunately after two bad experiences with this place i can gladly say i won't be having ANYTHING from here anymore   ***i saw the dudes grabbing fries to eat with their hands like um... i just find that unsanitary... oh and  they took FOREVER TO ask me what i wanted like forreal there's like one customer in front of me and three of you guys LIKE GET YO BUTT OVER HERE AND TAKE MY ORDER !!! DONT STAND AROUND EATING FRIES?"}
{"text":"I love their meatball special here. It comes with your choice of salad, rice, meatballs, and potatoes. The prices are decent and the portions are also decent. The food tastes very homey, and I don't feel like crap after eating. I usually come here when I'm looking for a cheaper lunch during the workday."}
