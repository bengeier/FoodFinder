{"text":"Horrid online experience. Ordered dinner and after an hour called to find out where food was. they told me no record but would check into it. A separate firm called to tell me they had no record, (apparantly they outsource), but asked me to forward my confirmation and they could get the restaurant to make my dinner as soon as possible. Not sure anyone in their right mind would wait 2 hours for delivery chinese. Terrible experience, never again."}
{"text":"Portions are huge so I always have leftovers for lunch the next day.  Take-out is ready within 10 minutes or you can request a specific time.  The Combo's for one are great.  And they never forget the fortune cookie to top it off.  Takeout server is very friendly."}
{"text":"Ordered chicken balls. Chop suey, kung pow chicken and fried rice. The chop suey was dry and lacked a true flavor to it. The kung pow chicken was also lacking flavor and was not spicy at all as indicated. Will not order from here unless i just want chicken balls and rice."}
{"text":"To be clear, I'm rating Oriental Taste as a Chinese take-out and delivery place, not as a fine-dining establishment.  And as a take-out and delivery place, it's excellent.   We've been ordering from them for years, and are always happy and full at the end of the meal. The food is considerably less oily than many typical restaurants, and even after delivery time, the lemon chicken's crispy coating is still crispy, for example. Portions are generous, and not stretched with excess junk like green peppers. Our usual go-to choices include the aforementioned lemon chicken, the sweet & sour chicken balls, Mongolian beef, crispy ginger beef, General Tso chicken, Singapore noodles, and chicken fried rice. Never gone wrong with any! And delivery has always been pleasantly quick."}
{"text":"My favourite Chinese Food takeaway go to in Toronto! So good I don't even bother to try other places. Mongolian chicken, curry mixed veg is all good!"}
{"text":"Cheap eats, fresh food. We order at least once a week from OT. How can you go wrong with a dinner for two for a couple of sawbucks!. Can't remember a time we were disappointed with the quality."}
{"text":"Well where do I start the food is really terrible I order chicken wings,chicken  fried rice mix vegetable and chicken balls. The fried rice was stale maybe 3 days old ,another thing the carrots had mold these people are crazy to thing it's acceptable Yo serve human beings that kind of crop The wings looked like it was runner over  by a truck overdone and no taste and the chicken balls had no taste very crispy and over done overall the food tasted stale ,the food was very expensive for the crop they gave me . I wouldn't want it for free. I called because I wanted voice my disappointment, The lady I spoke to told me they have been open for 25 yrs and no as never complain well really I only write reviews when it's really bad I would not feed my dog that crop why because I love my dog too much and also I love myself. I threw the food in the garbage because I knew they would not return my money. I would never order from there again, I think I am done ordering Chinese food from any resturants in Toronto unless I can go in person"}
{"text":"While I've never set foot in the place, I kind of know where they are and still order from them even though we're located on the west side of Spadina, that should say something... They have this uncanny ability to remember, even after months of not ordering anything, and then they know where to go, what we like to order, amazing! The delivery is fast and reliable, and the Chinese food is satisfying and tasty. Just what the doctor ordered when in the mood for late night Kung Po Chicken or Shrimp. You know, the good old stand by's. With the distance they have to drive to get past Spadina, the food still arrives hot and fresh, so don't hesitate to order even if you are at the fringes of their delivery area. They were running a special off their menu with a minimum order amount so you may want to ask for that. Along with extra hot sauce packets..."}
{"text":"Well as with all Chinese food joints, they have their strong dishes and weak ones, today i discovered one of their weakest, their General Tso's chicken was quite simply terrible..., like holy crap bad... their sauce was bizarre, like they tried to turn that red sweet and sour sauce into general Tso sauce, it was just really weird and i just couldn't finish it. My buddies crispy ginger chicken was really good though, so beware, stay way from the general Tso's chicken if you know what's good for you.."}
{"text":"For our bi-weekly office team lunch we frequently choose this joint.  Usually we get a variety of dishes and just share.  The Mongolian Chicken is a big hit with a lot of my co-workers. Personally, I am more for the General Tso Chicken or the Chicken Lo Mein in Black Bean Sauce...  They offer free delivery with orders over $15 and if you order more than $30 they throw in a free Sweet & Sour Pork.   For lunch they also have a special menu with 12 dishes that are just $5.95 each.  I don't know how the service is at their location since we always get delivery, but with that they are awesome. Even large orders just take 30 min to arrive and the driver is always really friendly."}
{"text":"Had this delivery and Did not enjoy. Ended up throwing out a significant part of the food Best part was the spring rolls. The Har Gau weren't so great, and the meal went downhill from there. Felt it was overpriced, and garbage quality. I'm perplexed that anybody could like this. Also was unimpressed that even though I paid a tip in advance, the driver did not deliver to my apartment door and had me come to the lobby. So poor service, terrible food."}
{"text":"this is an ok place.  the food is cheap but ok quality. combines both thai and sushi food.  nothing to write home about but good for late night food (I think we stopped there around 9pm on sunday)  the best part of the night was when the waitress came up to us asking if we're interested in jewelry=) and then my fortune cookie told me that I should \"expect kisses in unexpected places\" - this made my day (um... night) =)"}
{"text":"What is Oriental Taste?  It reminds me of the Canadian-Chinese food that they cook in Thunder Bay - it's very different from the Chinese food that you find in China Town and some purest won't go near it because it isn't at all authentic.  I like it.  I like it because it's greasy Chinese food that hits the spot after a night out.  It's cheap, and they have those \"buy $30 worth of food and get free somethingsomething\".   I had the fried rice, pan-fried pork noodles, chicken and veggies and another chicken dish - Kung Pao maybe? Regardless it was greasy good.  Big servings that will last you through lunch the next day.  So why only 3 stars? Well, the waitress made me feel uncomfortable.  When I told her that I needed a minute, she just smiled and stayed there - right beside me - waiting for me to make my decision.  Standing....over me....watching me....I'm still having nightmares.  Oh, and they didn't have Coors Light."}
{"text":"One of my good Asian spots to eat especially if I'm in the area ( queen/parliament, not a far walk from Eatons centre)  I've been coming back to this restaurant on and off for 3 years now. The bartender/hostess and I are friends now. It was really nice to see her again after couple months hiatus.   The prices are good for the amount of food you are getting. I always get a ginger ale and 2 spring rolls and switch between the fried rice or the chow mein. This time I wanted to try something new, so I got the shanghai noodles. I'm obsessed with shanghai/thicker sized noodles and I don't know why. My takeout from here usually lasts about 1-2 days, depending how hungry I get in the next few hours.   My entire takeout bill was below $20. 3 spring rolls, noodles and ginger ale. They have lots of party trays for sushi and dinner combos for 2-8 people. They also have a lunch special for $6-8 and a all you can eat sushi from 5 to 11pm.   Enjoy fellow oriental lovers :)"}
{"text":"Chinese/Sushi restaurant with a bar and ambient country music (CMT Network).  The food is good; it's just small things that rub me the wrong way.  It kinda smells like a dumpster.. No wait, not 'kinda.'  The waitress is very nice, I wonder if she can smell the dumpster ambiance.  The food tastes good, but I must say...  the dumpster smell is..distracting.  If you should happen to use the washrooms, take a huge whiff of the air down there; smells like a dumpster.  I can't just dislike this place because of the dumpster smell, I mean, its across from Moss Park.. the food is also cheap for the large portion size but...again, it smells like a dumpster in there.  I recommend take out at this place, because of the dumpster smell.  Their ice cream is really good too... but again with the dumpster smell... they need to Febreze that place, fo real."}
{"text":"Oh wow, I should have read the reviews before ordering. We order shrimp fried rice there was tons of rice and on top only 6 shrimps nothing else not even vegetables, lemon chicken was almost floating in oil because it was fried I dont know how many times, another fried rice but with beef, it was the exact same rice with no vegetables and only the little piece of beef on top maybe 10 little pieces. Seriously what is this place is no good for food, Do Not ORDER from here!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a spot in the neighborhood for some Sunday night sushi and this was the closest place we found.  As we entered the surprisingly dingy restaurant, we found an unusual cast of characters at the bar glued to what appeared to be a cartoon.  We proceed further into what was essentially an empty restaurant with a lingering smell of old carpet.  The earlier commented who said that this place could use with a good spray of Febreeze was right on the mark.  That being said, we did get some good value on the sushi we ordered.  Unfortunately the two desserts we wanted to try were sold out.  All things considered, will I come back here? Most likely not, but if cost is an issue, it's worth considering.  I recommend spending a bit more and going to a place like Miyaki."}
{"text":"Fast service. Great late night budget food place it'll get the job done but don't expect fancy."}
{"text":"Cheap, big portions. Not very tasty. Shrimp fried rice was white rice and big tiger prawns. What happened to peas, carrots, fried egg, sauce? Super dry  Egg rolls were over cooked but not bad.  Overall would NOT RECOMMEND it"}
{"text":"We were craving Chinese and Oriental Taste turned out to be exactly what we were looking for, We had the ginger beef, vegetable chop suey, cantonese crispy chow mein, and spring rolls, which came to 35 with tax and tip (and free delivery). Everything was hot, fresh, and not too greasy, considering we're talking about Chinese fast food.  No one would ever confuse this with a gourmet food, but it was easy to order online, the food came quickly, and it was a great value. They'll be getting my call again next time I feel like having Chinese."}
{"text":"I can trail off into (dot dot dot dot dot) about this place. That's how speechless I am.   Firstly, upon walking in, you'll be greeted with an aroma like no other. Detect sarcasm? It doesn't quite smell like Chinese food; just smells dirty. Whatever, I knew about the hole-in-the-wallishness of this place but I still decided to walk in with my boyfriend for a break-from-work kind of lunch.   A few surprising things:   1. A lot of office goers seem to frequent this place... It doesn't look work-lunchy appearance-wise but it was.   2. Food was undoubtedly cheap and for the price I paid, pretty good. I liked my Mongolian Beef meal.   3. There's sushi and thai on the menu. I shied away from it but there were others in the restaurant eating sushi and judging from their expressions and sighs of happiness, I am guessing it's pretty good.   The weird thing (other than the smell):  The owner is super nice... but then there's this weird woman. Either his wife, daughter, sister or another employee - weird Asian woman who was totally stoned and shuffling around the restaurant. When I asked her if we could seat ourselves upon going in, she looked at us and waved and mumbled. After a meal, she brought us our bill, and then disappeared leaving her credit card machine behind. After about 10 minutes, she shuffled back to our table and left with the credit card machine (without giving me a receipt). I was shifty-eyeing with my boyfriend and waiting around. So she came back after 2 minutes or so to give me my receipt. So weird.   Probably not going back. May get delivery. Good food, creepy dine-in experience."}
{"text":"I've ordered form this place twice now from TasteAway.com. The first time I ordered a spicy fried rice with pork and their house special egg foo yung. Both items were delicious. The fried rice is actually spicy, unlike a lot of Chinese places I order spicy food from.    The second time I decided to try their curry chicken. This one was a bad choice. It's bland, the curry sauce was lacking and barely noticeable. I like Asian curries that are thickly covered in the distinct yellow curry sauce."}
{"text":"Given that a chicken teriyaki bento box was $8.50, I probably should not have expected much. Nevertheless, the chicken was hard to chew on and came with this weird sauce. The place itself feels like a hole in the wall. I should say that the service was good and the lady serving the food was really nice. There's some other decent options in the area though, so I don't think I'll be stepping my foot in this venue in the future."}
{"text":"OK. My three year love affair with this horribly-named Queen of Delivery came to an end when I left Toronto's east side. Admittedly, I don't regret a lick of the move. However, today I was reconnected with OT and I loved every moment of it. The bEast isn't so bad.   I have reviewed the joint twice before (I think this is my first second update on a review!), but I have something major to add: Don't be afraid of their sushi menu!   I had always avoided the Japanese side of their menu, but I was hankering for some delivery sushi, and I am sequestered to the east due to that flash flood that stole all of my glorious power(s).   I went for the california rolls, gyoza, edamame, green salad and miso soup. The verdict? The best Japanese delivery for under $20 I've ever had. Did I risk the sashimi? Heck no. I'm no joker. But, I likely will if I dine in."}
