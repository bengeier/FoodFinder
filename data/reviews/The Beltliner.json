{"text":"I was close by the Beltliner yesterday and decided to pop in for a late lunch ... and in glad I did! I had the Big Salad and it lived up to its name ... it was humongous! The chicken that came in the salad was very moist and tender. The service was excellent and the food was delicious. What more could I ask for?"}
{"text":"Two stars for our past visits and if it was possible to give it zero for this one I would. We come downtown from the far SE every few weekends for breakfast here. With my parents being in town we suggested trying it and told them to expect great food. What a mistake. Besides the service being atrocious (middle aged lady, crap attitude, poorly drawn on eyebrows) the food couldn't even be described as decent this time around. Warmish, and my mother explicitly explained she wanted her eggs poached medium, slightly runny but not raw. Guess what, mucusy eggs that could hardly pass for poached soft. Nothing but attitude and \"well that's how medium is here\" when she pointed it out. They were replaced - slammed down in front of us without a word- by ones that might as well have been rocks they were so over cooked. No follow up, no caring what so ever from this \"server\". The hashbrown pave was completely devoid of any flavour and moisture and was borderline burnt. After reading other similar reviews I feel like the 10% I left her was probably more than she deserved. What a waste of a 30 minute drive!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place, wasn't as busy as I was expecting it to be (which was great). I ordered the Mushroom Eggs Benny and it was delicious! The best part, however, were the 'hashbrowns'. The Beltliner has a very unique twist to traditional hashbrowns, and I love them!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere was good, nice decor. Hot chocolate, vanilla latte and coffee were good, though 1 coffee order was forgotten. Service was slow, it's Sunday but still slow. Food was average. French fires were mushy. Beet salad is good but again it's nothing special.   Portions are large. It has a great locations next to Central Memorial Park and a walk in the park while you wait for your table is perfect. Their convenient text reservation system nicely enable this."}
{"text":"Overall atmosphere and decor is pretty cool. Started with a latte which was delicious and creamy. I ordered the Beltliner Benedict with medium poached eggs and hash browns.  Looks and tastes like they use premium ingredients- the bacon on the benny was delicious as were the sundried tomatoes and they make a top notch hollandaise. My eggs were not medium, more like the softest poached eggs I've ever had. I like my eggs to stay together so I can scoop up a bite with everything on my fork.   The hash browns are odd- they come in these layered stacks that I understand are supposed to be different and cool, but they were a little undercooked and didn't have much seasoning (I needed to use ketchup, and I never use ketchup).  I give this experience three stars because I think there's a lot of potential here but there are some improvements needed."}
{"text":"We stayed at the Fairfield Inn, which was right next to The Beltliner. Of course,  we decided to give them a try.   We went at night about a hour or two before they closed, and ordered the vegetarian lasagne. It was exactly as the name suggests, and loaded with vegetables. I think the pasta used was made by them (not store bought). It was SO delicious. It came with \"garlic bread\". It looked like hot dog bread coated with tumeric. I'm just assuming here. It was good, but not anything special.   Our server was very friendly, and made us feel very welcome.   Overall, I really wish the portion size was a bit bigger for a dinner plate, but it was delicious. It was about $15 I believe, and I will definitely be back next time I'm in Calgary!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food. I like the variety in the menu. Nice flavours in the pork belly on rice.  I have to deduct a star for their biscuits and gravy. The menu says \"house-made buttermilk and chive biscuits, white gravy\". I wanted flaky biscuits and a peppery white gravy, such as is available anywhere in the US. Instead they served me herby cheddar biscuits and a little dish of some complex, gamey, golden sauce - a creamy BROWN gravy! It felt a bit like ordering mac and cheese and receiving linguine alfredo. Yes, there were biscuits, and yes, there was gravy, but there were no biscuits & white gravy."}
{"text":"My partner and I went to the Beltliner at approximatly 10am on Saturday September 23 2017.  This was our first time in the diner as a co worker suggested it when it first opened but we hadn't tried it out until now.  My partner was paying for parking as I went inside and was greeted by the owner, Brendan Bankowski.  I asked for a table for two.  He said we can sit at the bar or wait for a table.  I said we would wait. I asked how long it would be and he said aprximately 10 minutes.  I felt that was reasonable as I looked around and there was a table for 4 empty and some tables finishing up.  Keep in mind I was the only party waiting at the entrance other than large table of 6 which was tucked away in the hotel lobby attached to the restaurant.   He asked for my name and entered into an electronic system.  He then asked for my phone number which I was hesitant to give.  I asked why he needed it and he said so I would get a text when my table was ready.  I was not comfortable with giving more personal information other than my first name so I declined. I think this may have thrown him off because it went downhill from there.  He said I could wait over there and pointed to the entranceway to the hotel lobby where the other party in line was waiting. So I stood off to the side until my partner showed up.  My partner approached him and asked for a cup of coffee while we wait. He said \"I can't help you but one of my servers can\".  So my partner stood right beside him while he stood there at the counter and asked the server for a cup of coffee.  We then waited for half an hour to be seated. In this timeframe parties of two were going and people coming in ahead of us were being seated.  I looked around and saw a table for two so I went up to him and asked him if we could have that table and pointed to it.  He looked at me and said \"no\".  So I asked why not? And he said \"because you can't\".  He said i was number 10 on the list of parties to be seated.  I then asked how can that be when he said earlier it was going to be 10 min. So I asked for the owner.  He said he was the owner. At this point I was stunned. He was becoming visually and verbally irritated.  Shaking and condescending towards anything reasonable that I asked.  I said that a friend of mine's husband (i mentioned her name) owned partially with the Beltliner and had mentioned coming there.  He said \"I don't know who you are talking about\".  I said we'll can I have your card.  He condescendingly said sure and went to get it.  While he was doing that I spoke to one of his servers and said I don't know what is happening? I just didn't want to give my phone number and instantly we became the enemy in his eyes.  She said \"he's the owner and you best talk to him\".  But clearly he would have no interest in trying to make this already bad situation better because when he came back he said to me that I was being \"aggressive\" in the same condescending voice \"you name drop and you think you know our system....you don't know our system so leave and never come back....oh and make sure you get my name spelled right\".  I was stunned.  I said I'm not being aggressive I'm just trying to understand why you are seating others before us and clearly we had arrived before all the others.  I would like to note that I researched before going and the Beltliner is not on the Nowait app nor does it allow reservations on Open Table on weekends. I carefully placed my coffee down and said \"are you sure this is what you want and how you want to treat your customers?\" He said \"just leave and get out and don't come back\".  At this point there were many others behind me waiting to be seated.   I said to them I wouldn't be served because I didn't want to give him my phone number for the wait list. I said to them he was incredibly unprofessional and abrasive towards me.  It was horrible and I will never be back.  We then went to Suzette's where we had a lovely crepe breakfast greeted by a happy and welcoming hostess."}
{"text":"WORST customer service experience in my life!!!!! I can't post without at least one star, this place is ZERO STARS. We were treated like an inconvenience rather than a guest by the \"manager\". Asked to move in a half empty restaurant, as they were \"waiting for the lunch rush\", at 11 am, which apparently has more important customers than my sister and I, as if we would last longer than an hour, empty tables all around us. Never in my life have I been treated with such passive aggressive and downright rude behavior by a service industry manager. Horrible place, I wouldn't go if I were you, they don't care about customer service at all."}
{"text":"It's quite nice in the Beltliner, but it's not really my cup of tea. There was a half hour wait, and service was really slow (and the waitress seemed a little miffed that a few folks in my party were ordering more than one drink). I went with a party of 3, and we all had either the creme brûlée french toast or the buttermilk waffles. The buttermilk waffles were good, but pretty standard fare, but we all found the french toast to be too sweet, quite soggy and a little weird tasting. I ordered hashbrowns on the side (because hashbrowns are my FAVORITE THING  in the WORLD), and I was incredibly disappointed. Instead of hashbrowns, I got a weird starchy potato-brick. It was kind of like au gratin sliced potatos but then all mushed together, deep-fried and cut into a triangle.  You cannot call that hashbrowns. That is BLASPHEMY. Hashbrowns can be two things - home fries or shredded, fried potatoes. A weird starch-brick is NOT A HASHBROWN.   The atmosphere was really nice in the Beltliner though. If I go back, I will probably order something with bacon and eggs (as the sweet stuff doesn't seem to be their forte), and I will avoid the so-called hashbrowns."}
{"text":"Excellent presentation, friendly.  I tend to judge my breakfast places based on their \"hashbrowns\". The Beltliner had a different take on the potato front, more like scalloped potatoes. Tasty yes but better with a baked ham for dinner. Please bring back some variation of a hashbrown :)  Enjoyed the breakfast overall and as a bonus...They make Bulletproof coffee!"}
{"text":"Went for brunch this morning- first time trying this restaurant.  Likely will not be going back.    The place has a nice feel to it and the wait staff were friendly and attentive- unfortunately the food was medium (at best).  We ordered the mushroom Benedict and the buttermilk waffle.  The eggs on the Benedict were ordered soft and they came hard and the English muffin was extremely hard and difficult to cut.  The waffle had more of a pancake texture (not crispy at all) and only came with two blueberries, a half strawberry and small piece of pineapple.  Very underwhelming.  Many other restaurants in the city that serve better brunch."}
{"text":"Meh. One of the things i love about Calgary are the great places to go for a Saturday morning breakfast. As such i gave eaten a LOT of breakfasts!  This place is average. Only a few choices for actual breakfast on the menu.  Since there are so many great places to eat here i probably won't be going back. Can't even remember what i had it was that good."}
{"text":"Average food. Shit service.  I live in the neighbourhood, and was happy to have a place like this a block away from my place. For starters- the food is nothing more than ok. I gave it a couple of tries, and the food seemed to get worse. Cool concept with the hashbrown, until you taste it, and realize this is probably what cardboard soaked in heavy cream tastes like.... My advice- make your own brunch if this is the only option you have."}
{"text":"Great food and great price for what you get. The big salad is a big salad they are not lying. Perogies are great and well as the burger, meatloaf and grilled cheese if you love lots of cheese pair it with their tomato soup. Great place to stop before a flames game or theatre."}
{"text":"The best place to eat in downtown, delicious food, quick & nice service & huge menu list. Must try this place out if you haven't been here yet. You'll fall in love with their food."}
{"text":"I had the same experience as others as far as a long wait for food, but great service. I had the veggie burger with hash browns ( strongly suggested by our server) as well as a veggie smoothie. The hash browns alone were enough make another visit. My burger and smoothie were also delicious. My bf had the merguez skillet and mom had the quiche. Both were also impressed with the food. Beltliner will definitely be on my breakfast roster."}
{"text":"Maybe it was an off night - but I agree with the two and three star reviewers; wish I had read those before we saddled into the seat.   Waitress was inattentive, our water was only offered to be refilled right when we were leaving;   I ordered the meatloaf- it was a thin, flimsy portion- certainly not what I expected from a \"diner\" type place ( perhaps I've been spoiled by diner delux). It was pretty basic-no real zip,but at 18 bucks - a bigger more fresh type portion would have been ideal- roasted carrots were good.   We came here because the restaurant next store -native tongues- was packed. However our diner type fare took 25-30minutes to get to our table.   It is what it is, but I doubt I'll be returning."}
{"text":"This place is deeeeelicious!!! We came from LA on our honeymoon and staying nearby! My wife wanted brunch and I wanted a burger! She absolutely loved the waffles and I had the best burger I've had in a really long time.   When it came time for desert, we asked the waitress what she recommended and she advised us to go for the sundae. We're not much of the sundae loving people but that sundae was amazing! It was so good that the second night we skipped desert at the other restaurant just to come here for desert!"}
{"text":"Their pie is great!!! Aside from that, the food is generally underwhelming for the price. If you're I. The beltline and need a place to sit and chat with friends it is a comfortable atmosphere. Maybe just go for pie and coffee!"}
{"text":"Had a terrible meal at Beltliner. Got there at 11:30 waited 20 minutes for a coffee even though the place was pretty much empty. The owner or manager spent more time chatting with his friends and their kids in the booth than helping out the two waitnresses that were on staff. Waited another 35 minutes for our food not to mention the fact they forgot to bring cups for our tea and utensils. Food was average at best. Their gluten free bread is not nutritious and falls apart.  There was a massive glob of mayo and a chunk of chicken on my club sanwich, didnt bother to spread the mayo or cut up the chicken and one had lettuce on it and the other didn't?! I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Most horrible experience in any restaurant in Calgary!!! Food was incredibly bland and our sausages were burnt and on top of that there was hair in our meal. Our server was unapologetic and treated us with no respect. We made a complaint to the owner and he was uninterested in what we had to say. Staff and management were extremely inappropriate and rude. Stay away from this place!!!!"}
{"text":"The Beltliner MUST be good as it is always busy, often lined up on the street.  Been here several times, usually off peak hours. The atmosphere is up beat and funky. The wait staff are knowledgeable, prompt and friendly. Then there is the food. Well what can I say about their menu other than amazing!  Every time I'm there I find a new favourite."}
{"text":"The Beltliner is fantastic! I go there for brunch often, the service is always friendly, fast and welcoming. The menu is delish and there is lots to choose from. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice, and it was great each time. First of all, their restaurant has such a cool layout and I love the atmosphere. The staff are all very nice and relaxed, even when I came by myself they did not make me feel uncomfortable at all.   I've only ever gotten the grilled cheese here, which was fantastic the first time and had a bit too much cheese the second time. The tomato soup is also delicious, and I don't even like tomato soup! Their vanilla latte was also superb and was quite big. Really recommend this place to anyone in the area, their meals are nicely priced as well."}
{"text":"Tomato soup was bland,  grilled cheese sandwich adequate but definitely not worth $13."}
{"text":"The Beltliner is my ALL TIME favourite for breakfast. Every time I am visiting Calgary it is a MUST. The hashbrowns are awesome (kind of deep friend, peel-apart scalloped potatoes?!) Their eggs benny with roasted cherry tomatoes and fresh basil is to DIE for, the quiche is un-be-liev-able, and their Saskatoon Fries are soo yummy (dessert for breakfast- why not?) Lattes are perfect, and served in a giant mug.  I went early one morning and sat down at a table of my choice because I was the first an only customer of the morning. Moments later, a family with a whole bunch of small children came barrelling through the door and piled onto the bench seat  right beside me. One of the waitresses didn't skip a beat in politely inviting them to sit in the corner booth on the opposite side of the restaurant.  I was so grateful that my relaxing morning was not interrupted.  The decor is cute and kitschy and the girls are all in plaid. It is nice and open and you can sit at the bar if you wake up too early and don't feel like facing other humans.  Great place."}
{"text":"Aw man, I gotta say, this place was pretty 'meh'  - the service was good but the tasting menu wasn't very impressive. Generally under seasoned and the pie dough wasn't cooked through. Cool place and nice people and great location... Food just wasn't great, it wasn't bad but it wasn't great."}
{"text":"I was meeting my friend for Sunday brunch yesterday and knew I had to try The Beltliner. I had heard many good things about it, so I was excited to finally go there. The wait was about 40 minutes, which is pretty typical for most places on the weekend. Luckily, they take your phone number and text you when your table is ready. They serve Fratello coffee here and give you large mugs too (double win!). It seemed like every table around me had at least one person ordering the Buttermilk Waffle. So naturally I had to order that! It was pretty large and was perfectly cooked. Nice and fluffy, and definitely quite filling! I really enjoyed it.   Our server Samantha was a sweetheart. She was attentive and was always around if we needed anything. Even though it was very busy, we felt welcome and did not feel rushed despite the lineup outside. A man I believe was the manager came to clear our plates and did a quality check to make sure all was well. Great service overall!  Definitely worth a visit, but either go before the rush or if you are not in a hurry."}
{"text":"After a disappointing first experience, we decided to give the Beltliner another shot and try the dinner fare.   The service was perfect - our waitress gave excellent recommendations and was a true expert on the menu selections. Also, I was glad to see the beer menu has been updated with some very unique craft beer selections at reasonable prices.   We had the chicken & waffles with Meatloaf and shared the dishes. The batter was great on the chicken and the waffles were soft and fluffy. The meatloaf was tasty and hot - only complaint was the portion size was small in comparison to the chicken.  Overall, I would recommend others to try out the Beltliner as it appears they have dialed in their menu and really kills it on the service side. Great job guys."}
{"text":"Urban diner, I went for breakfast.  I ordered the 2 x 2 x2 . Bacon, eggs, and potatoes.  The coffee was above parit.  Modern decor.  The food was somewhat boring.  Service was very professional.   General speaking, the flavours and food left something to be desired.  Lines were busy and we had to wait for a while.  Will give it another shot to see if their lunch menu is better."}
{"text":"I was prepared to love the Beltliner, but I felt kinda let down. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't horrible by any means and I'll definitely go back and give them another shot. I got the smoked salmon benny, because eggs benedict is kind of my benchmark dish for judging brunch restaurants. My biggest disappointment was the hollandaise -- it was bland and frothy. The only thing worse would be \"hollandaise\" from a package. When the server brought it to me, one of the eggs had rolled off the muffin onto the plate, which isn't a huge deal but I would have preferred an offer to fix it or add more hollandaise (before I knew the hollandaise was bad) since it got smeared on the plate and not so much was left on the egg. Anyway. The potato casserole thing was great, I'd go back for that alone. Could have done with another chunk of it though, the plate seemed pretty empty. Part of my problem might be the price. I could have overlooked a lot more at a $12 price point instead of the $18 they charge.  My dining companions had the veggie lasagna and the big salad, and they both seemed happy with their food, so that's great. My mom in particular liked the lasagna -- she said it wasn't weighted down with a ton of doughy noodles like a lot of places do it. The noodles were layered flat like a proper lasagna instead of just tossed in the dish.   Like I said, it's worth another try. I'll update my review when I go back."}
{"text":"If they can't get the 2x2x2 right....there's no motivation for me to try the rest of the menu.  I ordered the 2x2x2 and the only good thing is that it was only $10. My wife had the bacon version with over easy eggs. The presentation was really poor, the food was near lukewarm as was the coffee, the bacon was limp and both the bacon and the eggs were dull colored...not appetizing to look at. I had the sausage version and they tasted like damp cigars from the first bite.   In my opinion, even Denny's provides much better value and portions. Consistently at Denny's I get my food steamy hot and flavorful and at comparable pricing. So to sum it up for this review.....NOT worth bothering with if you are looking for breakfast fare....less than a dozen breakfast items to select from as well."}
{"text":"Good coffee. Good breakfast. Decor reminded me of Portage Bay Cafe in SLU. Definitely worth a return visit."}
{"text":"Disappointing. Great decor. Unfriendly service and mediocre food (all 4 plates). Won't go back."}
{"text":"Fun vibe, good variety on the menu. I've been twice and both times the service has been less-than.  Friendly, but SO SLOW. Last time my bfast (eggs, bacon, hash) came out cold.  Disappointing. Will go back to try out the lunch and dinner menu"}
{"text":"Do not waste your time or money! I have gone to the Beltliner many times as I live in the neighbourhood as I used to recommend the place when it first opened. However, I have to say that the service and food quality has consistently declined.  When I go out to eat the food is a part of the experience but the service is a lot of what I pay for and it drastically affects my level of satisfaction. I went most recently for weekend brunch and was not impressed with the attitude and shortness of the waitress, manager and owner. I was very surprised at the lack of respect. It was clear to me that a customer's individual satisfaction was not of importance to the people that work at the Beltliner. The goal is just to make a dollar. I feel that they are getting comfortable and not putting customer service first. My recommendation is to avoid going to the Beltliner and find another location for brunch where patrons are still appreciated and the individual experience is still a core value."}
{"text":"Would need to try to go back for lunch to really rate The Beltliner. My breakfast was okay, was hoping for more. Pb&j pancakes wouldn't be my first choice again. Large pancakes with 2 small spoonfuls of jam/pb on top. Service and atmosphere was really nice though. Will be back."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast. The hash browns are really unique, it's basically a stack of potato layers. Everything was really good. A bit pricey, but I'd recommend it."}
{"text":"Besides the food being awesome, you can get $5 quality bourbons all day! This place is next to the Fairfield Inn which makes it perfect for work!!"}
{"text":"Super comfy, friendly service and breakfast beer. My BF and I have enjoyed breakfast here several times. Drinks in mason jars, all day breakfast, and a cozy atmosphere keep us coming back. Sun-dried tomatoes overwhelmed the Benedict eggs, but those hash browns are amazing."}
{"text":"Tried this joint out twice now once for breakfast and once for diner. The breakfast was extremely slow and the potatoes had no real flavour and shaped in cubes.  Steak sandwich was over cooked. On a plus side the chicken soup was ok however was more broth than anything else. I also ordered a salad and it was good but a massive portion and again the flavour department was lacking as the chicken was extremely bland.  The saddest part of the whole Experience is the pie. Thick crust again with no flavour and the filling was just meh."}
{"text":"Nice cozy bistro style restaurant.  Large glass windows and high ceilings.  Friendly staff.  A few deer antlers for decoration.  Eclectic diner menu.  Quiche with arugula salad was very good.  Draft beer was tasty and you must try the surprise tall can of beer for $5.  Gluten free clubhouse if you ask for it."}
{"text":"Came here on a busy Saturday morning. Great service and atmosphere! Make sure you're hungry because the portions can be quite large. Delicious food, I wanted to try everything on the menu! I recommend trying the chicken and waffles."}
{"text":"I REALLY love The Beltliner, and have made myself a regular over recent months. The decor is cool hipster (you'll get your water in a jar) plus traditional diner, and the space itself is bright and open. The coffee cups are humongous, which is a welcome serving the morning after any night at the bar. I always order the traditional eggs benedict, which have never disappointed, but have left me with virtually nothing to say about the rest of the menu. I keep meaning to go for something else, but why give up a good thing? Staff has always been awesome and accommodating. If you arrive when it's busy and you can't get a table, you can leave your number and they will text you when one comes available. The Beltliner is a worthy stop if you're downtown and want a delicious breakfast!"}
{"text":"You can't beat the convenience of a restaurant under your hotel! Dale E and I stopped by for brunch before his big event and it was very enjoyable.   The atmosphere is kind of chic-hipster-chill, and I was glad I was able to snake us a booth - they're comfy! My server was a bit of an enigma - she seemed pretty stand-offish at first, but warmed up a bit towards the end. The place was pretty hopping around lunchtime on a Tuesday, which is always awesome to see.   I ordered the merguez and eggs, and a side of hash browns, and it was great! The dish came in a cast iron dish on a beautiful logoed plate and was pretty hefty! The eggs were a little runnier than I like (I prefer the yolks runny but the whites not snot-like), and when I mixed some of the snotty whites into the rest (I assumed the cast iron was piping hot) I was surprised the dish was quite lukewarm in places.   The flavours were great, the little pieces of sausage were rich and tasty, and the sauce was delicious! The hash browns are amazing - make sure you get them! Layers of potato pressed together and deep fried (I assume) - it made for a fun eat as I peeled the layers off!  I'd definitely dine here again next time I'm in Calgary!"}
{"text":"Wife and I went half and half on a belt liner Benny and a creme brûlée French toast. Great idea, both were great and their house hot sauce is awesome on the Benny. Service was great as well. Eat here"}
{"text":"Yep, yep, yep. I am a fan of the Beltliner, and I think you will be too. I've tired the chicken and waffles which was a 10/10 in my books (talk about #comfortfood). The chicken was perfectly battered on the outside and juicy and moist on the inside. And the waffles similarly were coated in crunchy goodness and filled with soft fluffy pancake love - YUM! Also the eggs benedict, which was really good, minus the salmon (just not a fan of the combo)...go for the mushroom instead (way better). The eggs were cooked beautifully and slathered in the most delicious hollandaise sauce. And did I mention the hashbrown potatoes....they're delectable.   I love the overall vibe of the place. It's colorful and spacious, and I think it's cute how you get the bill in a children's book.  .... I do find the tables to be a bit too bit close, but I know it could be worse...   Coffee was great and I dig the free water.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I've gone through the menu fairly extensively and found quite a few things for the vegetarian. The big salad is awesome, and well, anything with syrup on it has rocked as well.  Love the staff, and the fact that they have an actually coffee counter with take away coffee. They can do soy drinks as well, which is a huge bonus for the few with aversions to dairy. They are also open ALL DAY! So when you're hungry past 1pm, you can still eat.   Also, the brown liquor cabinet is amazing. $5 ounces of beautiful whiskeys, rums and tequila. I've certainly been making my way through. I encourage you too as well!  The patio looks amazing in the afternoon."}
{"text":"A relatively new place to check out.  Pretty busy on a Sunday around 1pm, but got a seat.  Nice looking place.  Service was good, server was pleasant and fast.  Food was OK 2 eggs, 2 strips of bacon and toast for $9 is about average.  Eggs were a bit over done over easy.  Food was good, but nothing to scream about."}
{"text":"Why does the 'modern' in modern diner have to include expensive and irritatingly kitsch?  Pros: I enjoyed my eggs benedict, my coffee, and my friend's orange juice  Cons: Could you just call the potatoes deep fried scalloped potatoes or something, cause that's not really hashbrowns. I tried to initiate my European friend on fried chicken and waffles here and that was a mistake. An order of hot chocolate took like ten years to make. The kitsch level indicator (number of visible mason jars used for drinks x 0.25 + cost of meal x incidents of hipster whimsy) was through the roof."}
{"text":"'Twas the night before the night before Mother's Day, and all through the house, not a creature was stirring...except for a six year old snoring and a mother on a Yelpy quest for the perfect Saturday early Mother's Day brunch with her baby...  Truthfully, it took me until after midnight to find this newcomer on Yelp amongst all of the other great diners and brunch spots in Calgary. What won me over was the $5 kids menu items, as well as a great selection for the big kid at the table too!  When we arrived the next morning, we knew there would be a little wait. Our hostess took my cell number and said they would text us when our table was ready (fabulous!!). So baby and I grabbed a chocolate chip cookie that was very aptly described as a \"something that tastes like a squashed brownie\" (baking courtesy of Corbeaux...simply amazing cookie, btw), and a Fratello coffee. We went across the street and sat in the sunlit park while we waited for our table. The text came way faster than we expected and we were seated immediately upon our return.  My little one had the chocolate chip pancake (and I stress - singular - she couldn't even finish the one...and that is saying something for the Pancake Monster!). I ordered the PB&J Pancakes - fig jam, my favorite, and pistachio butter. Both dishes came with healthy dollops of house-churned butter and delicious authentic maple syrup.   Can I just talk about the staff for a minute? They were all so helpful, friendly and actually TALKED to my 6 year old. You all rock in my world!   I have been telling all of my friends about you, Beltliner, and we will come back with friends!!"}
{"text":"After coming back to Calgary from North Carolina, I was really looking forward to biscuits and gravy.  Unfortunately the biscuits weren't that great (fairly dense), and the gravy was the kind of gravy you serve at thanksgiving or Christmas.. not with biscuits and gravy.  Not worth the money, however, the dishes my friends ordered looked good."}
{"text":"Been waiting awhile to check this place out and it did not disappoint, coffee was delicious, food was solid and of course the team provided some great service.   Will be back often I'm sure."}
{"text":"3 for lunch but 4 star for breakfast.   I had the club sandwich for lunch and got it to-go. The sandwich was sloppily put into the container. The meat had all fallen out of the bread. And they didn't send me with dressing for the salad. So not such a good experience for lunch.   As for breakfast I decided to give it another try since it was close to our hotel. The atmosphere here is nice. I ordered the pancake stack with Nutella and strawberries. Very healthy, right?? Don't judge  it was delicious. Too much for me to eat myself but what I did eat I throughly enjoyed!!  I almost forgot... the maple syrup was superb. Drizzled on top of Nutella, pancakes was yummy!"}
{"text":"Good comfort food. They only have one beer on draft. The place is good for a casual dinner after work or brunch. Definitely not a place for a date"}
{"text":"Celebrated a friend's birthday here :) Really enjoyed the food The biscuits were to die for! Steak & eggs was pretty good, but the chicken & waffles gets the home run!!! Can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"Always had this preconceived idea that diners were dirty and greasy, with the food very fast food like. This place definitely makes you think twice about diners.  A relatively new place that has beautifully chic and modern decor, that was extremely welcoming. An extremely welcoming and lively space, with attention for the details. Mason jars for cups, a Dr. Suess book for the receipts, and excellent service all tied together to bring a wonderful lunch experience!  The portions were a good size and will definitely fill you up! Thought the prices were a bit high at first, but the portions definitely made up for it. The Beltliner Burger was amazing! All the different tastes all came together perfectly to compliment the burger patties. The bottom bun did get quite soggy, making it a mess to eat, but so worth it!! The Tomato Soup was also awesome! One of the best I've ever had.  Friends also had the Big Salad and Spicy Salami Benedict, which were both amazing! The Benedict also came with these potatoes which were unique and delicious!  Service was fast and friendly, making this is a must try if you're in the downtown Calgary area!"}
{"text":"The pie is grand and the coffee is wam bam thank you ma'am! My in-laws can't get enough of it and even request we send mail it to them in Toronto."}
{"text":"Awesome diner. They have great coffee (they serve Fratello coffee, same as Analog).  Really cool decor, simple but very classy for a diner. I definitely recommend this place for a meal anytime of the day."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place doesn't have more stars. I stayed away because usually anything less than 4 stars is terrible. Not this one!! Great food, great staff, great environment. My only complaint is I wish I would've found it sooner. I do also wish they had take out of the full menu, but I get it."}
{"text":"So awesome! Coffee was fantastic, eggs were fresh, sausage was delicious. The hashbrowns where different and I've never seen them presented that way before I loved it. No complaints! Wish I lived in Calgary so I could go here more but I will always go here every time I'm in the city."}
{"text":"So, my sister and I went to The Beltliner one morning on a whim. We arrived around 11am, and just managed to beat the lunchtime rush. Let me tell you, this place gets packed!  Before we even get the actual menu, this place serves Cru Juice, Corbeaux pastries and Fratello coffee - the best of every world! We were seated to have lunch and given menus that seemed very familiar but also different in the most splendid of ways. The Beltliner has their own twist on a bunch of classics!  Now, I ordered the grilled cheese with tomato soup, and my sister ordered the chicken noodle soup. The chicken noodle soup was hearty and warm and full of flavour! But, let me tell you about the tomato soup. Now, I do not like soup. But this tomato soup I had literally rekindled my love of it, and I've been craving it every day since we went to The Beltliner. I cannot tell you what makes it so special but I have literally never had tomato soup that good, let alone any other kind of soup. The sandwich was also great - the cheese just melted in your mouth and the onions gave it a hint of freshness! I might use a less touch bread if it were up to me, but that's the only complaint I have.  Well, after all that, you didn't think we left without dessert, did you? We ended up ordering the Blue Plate special (which changes every day) and it was French toast with almond butter, Nutella, whipped cream and fresh fruit. It was a phenomenal way to finish off lunch! The service we received was AMAZING - the waitress was super attentive, showed up at all the right moments and had some great recommendations to make! If you're downtown and don't know where to stop for a bite to eat, definitely hit up The Beltliner - just make sure you beat the breakfast and lunch rush!"}
{"text":"The Beltliner is exactly what I needed when I woke up on New Years Day. After a night of drinking, greasy breakfast food always hits the spot.  I love how brightly lit and colourful the restaurant is. It manages to feel both modern and cozy at the same time.  I started off with a bottle of Cru orange juice and wow! This was some of the best OJ I've ever tasted. Seriously! It tasted like biting into a ripe, juicy, orange. I'm so disappointed you can only buy it in stores in Calgary. Edmonton loves OJ too!  There are lots of vegetarian options on the menu which is awesome. After much debate, I decided on the space jam and ricotta french toast. It arrived with thick fluffy bread and just the right amount of toppings. I must have been hungry because somehow I managed to wolf the whole thing down even though the portions were very generous.  Our meal was topped off by receiving the bill inside a discarded children's library book. I'm always a sucker for kitschy touches like that. Well done Beltliner!"}
{"text":"Went to the Beltliner for an early dinner once. The place is very new, modern and classy. The rabbit pot pie was well-cooked and the size of the portion was enough to fill me up. The tomato soup was phenomenal, I'd definitely come back just to get the soup!!  Service was fast and good and server was knowledgeable about the menu."}
{"text":"I was really excited walking into this restaurant. It looked like a highly themed Disney ride.A throwback to what a diner should be - every detail laid out with purpose and meaning. Our server was bright, bubbly and seated us in a corner table. We had just finished a Saturday afternoon rafting on the bow and the three of us were hungry.  We started with the deep fried pickles.  The pickles were an assortment of sizesfrom gherkins to big dills. They were crusted in a mixture of cornmeal and I believe panko? Either way, they were tasty enough, but the breading almost instantly fell off as you bit them.As a vegetarian - I ordered a Grilled cheese and Caesar Salad, no bacon.  The pickles came out fast - and then it happened.... the waiting began, 15 minutes, 30 minutes 45minutes  finally almost an hour later our mains came -   at this point we were all watching the kitchen \"pass \" to see what food was coming up. I was less than thrilled to see my grilled cheese sit up there for about 6 minutes before they finally took it out. When I got it, the cheese was  a semi congealed unpleasant very average sandwich.  The caesar salad was incredibly average with the only standout being that the croutons were made of waffle bits.   My tablemates were very not thriilled with thier meals either. They likely would have enjoyed their meals more had the wait not been so brutal. I cant recall what they had, I just remember tha the hashbrown  square, which  in theory sounded delicious ended up being little more than a large square of potato. Where was the cream and butter the server romanced so well?   A total disappointment. The servers pleasantness which at first was so sweet, in lack of any acknowledgment of the elepant in the room ( the ridiculous wait time) just became incredibly irriatitng.  I really was excited to go here - I had high hopes when I walked in - I may try again when perhaps they have worked out the kinks in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Service is quite attentive and it's a really cool place. When you're there check out the washroom even more retro stuff in there, anyway cool decor all around. The food is all good that I have had and the hash browns are like nothing you have ever had and should be tried."}
{"text":"Feeling brunchy today? The Beltliner is a solid bet. There's something to be said for a well laid out eggs benny, and I've got to admit their solid food presentation made me like it all that much more. They aced the hollandaise look. Just seeing that creamy yellow laid out across some steamy bennies as they bring it to the table is enough to make me want to ask if I can buy a pint glass of it. Could I? I can't confirm, sorry. I managed to control myself this time.   The fried potato hash-brown dealies are quite good. It seems like save potato, compacted into a cake and then the whole thing is deep-fried. They've got a flaky, crunchy outside and a warm, soft potato-y inside. They're really quite great and oh so easy to slather ketchup on.  Another advantage they have over many brunch places is the lineup, or rather lack there-of! Many very similar spots have lineups out the door regardless of the day and time you go. I showed up at noon and instantly got a table. How wonderful!  And here's where I can feel myself getting snobby and wanting more, more, more. As good as Beltline is, I don't really think they bring anything new to Calgary's brunch scene. They do a good job emulating the feel of Calgary's proven favourite brunch destinations, to the point that I couldn't help but feel like I'd been there many times before, but this was my first experience. There's a good chance I missed something really special, but for how new they are, I guess I was expecting a little change up in concept from the likes of Diner Deluxe and Blue Star and Red's and Dairy lane, and...  There's no reason not to go to The Beltliner, it's really quite good. If you're well experienced in brunching around town, I did struggle to find ways to pick them out of a crowd.  I'll definitely be back if I'm looking for a brunch location in the area."}
{"text":"I was disappointed by the Beltliner, as were my friends. I got the Merguez and eggs ( I assumed a type of baked eggs, which I usually love, and try the ones at Cleaver if you want to be blown away!). The 'poached' eggs had an unappealing gelatinous film on the top and were really unappetizing. I had asked for them to be done medium, which they were not, so when I clarified with the waittress she said that they sous-vide the eggs, which I just find strange. Like, either poach them properly or bake them, but sous-vide eggs are not the best. However, the merguez chunks were good as was the tomatoey sauce underneath, so I picked around the gross filmy eggs. At the end we decided to split a pie, which was decent (popcorn flavour). My friends had been to the Beltliner multiple times but vowed this was to be the last as everything was a bit too expensive for just being kind of bland. Decidedly lacklustre."}
{"text":"The food and the service were both good, I got the mushroom benedict and my fiance got the chicken and waffles. We were in and out in a little over a hour which was great!"}
{"text":"Yum! Awesome breakfast. Interesting food, every bite delicious. Nothing bad to say about this place. Even the art in the bathrooms was cool - periodic table of hip hop poster? Nuf said."}
{"text":"Great spot across from the Central Memorial Park Library which is a great place to stroll! Mother Frittata is avail sultry delicious and the portions are generous. Love the coffee here and the room itself, beautiful place."}
{"text":"So came here with some high hopes and basically blinded by the light.... Streaming in through the window.  In ten days they should have the blinds sorted so come after that!     We had deep fried pickles and Po boy oyster sandwiches for appies - pickles were a hit, oyster underwhelming.  I had the rabbit pot pie ... Found a rib bone - maybe that's for luck?  My friend had the chicken and waffles and lets just say the Nash does it better"}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot in downtown Calgary!!  Wonderful food, great service!  We tried it all - the 2x2x2, the waffle, the mushroom Egg Benedict - all were wonderful!  Great way to start your day!"}
{"text":"Best lunch/brunch I have ever had in my life! Would drive 6 hours back to Calgary just to go there. So amazing'"}
{"text":"Service was great but found the dinner menu was a bit limited. More tailored to your home-style cooking crowd."}
{"text":"I'm struggling to rate it a 3 or 4. 3 because it's nice, it's good and I'll come back again but will still be looking for other brunch places because I may not be in the mood to be on the wait list next time. 4 because I like the decor and flavor of food and coffees were good. This place is busy. Came on Sunday at 11am and the place is already packed with a waiting list for about 30 mins for a table of 2. Think for table of 4 would be 2 hours. A lot of people walked in and walked out because of the wait. In the end, my friend and I got seated in 15 mins! We both ordered cappuccino and it's delicious. It was a big mug and I had 2! I ordered the creme brûlée French toast, which was more like bread pudding. My friend got the waffle and it was fluffy, warm and tasty. The waffle was bigger portioned than the French toast. My friend and I stayed for a bit longer and the tables beside us had turned over twice already.... I did feel that I was rushed a tad bit because, we were given he check without requesting it. Felt like we couldn't really relax and enjoy a Sunday brunch. All in all, flavor was good but presentation was a bit lacking and plain (I mean, the menu says fruits come with the French toast, but who puts 1 strawberry and 1 piece of melon only?!) , atmosphere and decor was rustic/trendy and coffees were awesome. For now it's a 4 star and will see how it is on the next visit."}
{"text":"Super-wicked space, awesome food!  Got here early for a workday lunch. Exceeded all expectations!  Can't wait to bring my kids!"}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere and good choice of music. It's a nice little diner for a casual meal. Some good variety for cocktails and to eat."}
{"text":"Went there this past Sunday..!! There was a wait but that's fine until people who came in after us had been seated so I went up to ask and the girl said she has txt me but unfortunately I did not receive a txt she really didn't seem to care..!! Sat own ordered the eggs Benny it was awful eggs were still raw I did ask for medium poach..!! I did have a caesar and that was good..  I did However notice that there was quit a bit of plates being sent back for what ever reason.. Over all the experience wasn't what I expected..!!"}
{"text":"I travel to Calgary for work alot and stay in the hotel that's connected to this place so eat here almost every week. I love the staff and the service has always been great. They are super accommodating re: celiac and dairy allergic. The menu is mostly comfort food but menu is diverse enough to eat really healthy here as well. Good job beltliner!"}
{"text":"Rude Staff. Mediocre Food.   Went there for a breakfast meeting and asked for an omelet. After all it is a breakfast place. Server said NO. Not we don't have them (which is ridiculous) or let me check. Just No. Had to settle for some west coast breakfast which was mediocre at best. Maybe they should try accommodating their guests and be civil."}
{"text":"Chicken and waffles will change your life. Seriously, I could eat this every weekend."}
{"text":"Like the atmosphere, but it's overpriced for slowish service and an average breakfast. I've been twice and each time the food took a while (granted, it was busy both times).   The first time I had an eggs benny - the potatoes were amazing, but the benny itself was cold and the bread underneath almost too tough to cut through. The second time I had a waffle which was OK... and was disappointed that our $4 side of bacon only had 3 1/2 pieces.   The atmosphere is funky, but on both occasions service was slow with few visits from the serving staff.   Feels over-priced for what we got."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and food. We tried their waffle and a bennie - both were scrumptious. Will go back any time."}
{"text":"I never have good luck here. Last time I came the chicken and waffles was so over cooked and gristly, also just not tasty at all.  And tonight I shared biscuits and gravy with a friend while waiting for our table at Native Tongues.   First bite was ok.... Until we both looked at eachother with a sour face because the biscuit had this AWFUL bitter after taste. It tasted like having blood in your mouth when you bit your tongue. It tasted like maybe way too much baking soda? It was actually awful.  This restaurant reminds me of a nightmare where all the food looks amazing but then you bite into it and your realize it's all plastic."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for breakfast and for lunch and have yet to have a negative experience. Food has always been great along with very attentive staff.   So far I've had the waffles, soup and a couple sandwiches and all were made exceptionally. You can find Fratello coffee here and it's refreshing to not have to drink burnt swill in the morning.   This place does get busy so plan to come 30 minutes before you think you should.   Not to be missed. One of the best spots in downtown Calgary."}
{"text":"After reading previous reviews, I was so excited to finally try this place out! Unfortunately, it was far from what I was expecting.  When we first walked into the restaurant, it was bright and tastefully decorated. It wasn't too busy that day, so we were seated immediately and shortly thereafter, we placed our orders. I ordered the veggie burger and my dad ordered the Beltliner burger. It wasn't too long of a wait and service was decently average, but when the food was presented, I was a bit skeptical.   Firstly, the burger was massive. So massive in fact that they could not deliver it whole, but as two separate halves. Tomatoes and lettuce were piled onto one bun and the portobello patty, pickles, onions, and egg were on the other. To my dismay, the colour of the bun was alarmingly orange. It seemed as though they were trying to give off the impression of a brioche bun, however it simply looked incredibly artificial and off putting. A portion of wrinkled, pale looking fries accompanied it. Overall, it did NOT look appealing.   Regardless, I tried to maintain high hopes for the place as my fellow helpers gave it such rave reviews. So I combined the two halves of my burger and took a bite... or tries to. The burger was so huge I could not fit it into my mouth, so I ended up eating it with a knife and fork in the two halves it was initially presented as.   The first bite was... unusually. The portobello patty had been marinated in a balsamic vinegar sauce and was also served with pickled onions and pickles, so you can imagine how vinegary and tangy it tasted. In addition, I was expecting the portobello patty to have been pan-fried or crispy, however it was rubbery and thick- almost as if they had boiled it and soaked it in marinade. This made the bottom bun extremely soggy and the texture of the burger horrendous. The fries tasted as good as it looked, dry, powdery and old. My dad's beef burger didn't taste any better as he said \"it had quite a strong, beefy odour\".   Maybe we ordered the wrong items or maybe the kitchen was having an off day, but I was incredibly disappointed. I truly wanted to love the place, but we will NOT be coming back."}
{"text":"A new diner in the up and coming beltline? Wellll..... I don't know. Oh, they make their own butter? Their own bacon? Grind their own chuck?  Wow!  What?? They have a bunch of kinds of pie? SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!!  I stopped in here tonight with a mission and that mission was pie and coffee. I wanted diner pie in a new diner.  First of all, this place is beautiful. We came in the evening so we got to see the low lights, interesting fixtures, and tea lights on the tables. Comfy Boothe's, wooden tables, and a bar to belly up to.   My favorite thing right off the bat was how friendly the staff were despite being really busy and selling 30 pies today! And I must mention the 16 oz coffee cups. Now THAT'S a cup of coffee. Doesn't hurt its Fratello coffee, one of my faves.  I ordered lemon meringue pie, another of my favorite things in the world, and I was not disappointed. Real lemon, tangy and sweet and topped with brown sugar meringue. I chose to top it with a scoop of Fiasco vanilla bean gelato. I am so smart, s-m-r-t.  Breakfast is available all day, everything looks delicious! There's a kids menu and a full bar. Pretty much the best combination ever. Also, high chairs for the minis.   Will be back ASAP."}
{"text":"Yum! Quick service and a good array of breakfast food - I got the 2 x 2 x 2. I was deciding btwn that and the creme brulee french toast - I would have loved to try just normal french toast which I was bummed about. All in all, really good food and service.   Random perk: One of the bathrooms has an amazing array of origin's maps - the origin of comic books, video games, and wine - thought that was neat!"}
{"text":"Been here 3 times. First trip got a 5, second trip got a 3, third trip got a 4.  Food is really good, the first time we went it was 2 of us on a busy saturday at peak brunch hour. Service was good, we didn't have to wait long for a table (maybe 15 mins) and the service was attentive, and spot on! Food was great, and the coffee in our cups stayed hot and full!  The second trip was a weekday afternoon, popped over after the lunch hour to visit with a friend over coffee and pie. Although we were seated right away, and got coffees, we did not get a refill or a water for the 1.5 hours we were there. The staff were gathered at the front chatting with each other, and not much minding the 4 or 5 tables that were occupied. The pie was divine!   the third trip was a weekday lunch, and they did a good job. Good food which came up hot and fast. I had to ask for a coffee re-fil, but it came straight away so i was happy!   If you can't tell, i like coffee! I go out to a diner because i'm after food and coffee (as opposed to food and drinks.) Surprisingly, the busier this place seems the better the service is. I expect it might be because they keep their best staff (or the manager) on the busiest shifts, but maybe they need to shadow the new servers a little more closely on those slow afternoons. Definitely worth a stop in though, the hash browns are fantastic."}
{"text":"I don't know why Calgary has so much amazing breakfast food, but it does.   The Beltliner is the premiere spot for ultra hip and overpriced breakfast... but hey, it's also incredibly delicious. And instagramable.   Smoked Salmon benny is my fave. The way they do their potatoes is pretty special, so make sure you try those.  They're also one of the only places I know that serve ~bulletproof coffee~   As I mentioned, it's expensive compared to other great breakfast options, but usually worth it.  Don't forget to Instagram..."}
{"text":"The Beltliner is among many hip spots in downtown Calgary. The food, feel and staff are very friendly, fav dish is the chicken and waffles."}
{"text":"Good food. Friendly service. Central location. Will keep coming back for their Chicken and Waffles. One of the best I've had!"}
{"text":"A few growing pains - normal for a new restaurant but I would say once they smooth things out it's fantastic. On Good Friday, we came around 12:30 and it was a 2 hour wait and when we finally sat down it took over an hour to get our food. This wasn't even the peak of waiting for a table - some after us were told 2.5 hrs.   Between the 2 of us we ordered mushroom bennies, tuna melt, classic Belgian waffle, and banana cream pie. Best thing on the menu was the crispy scalloped potatoes served on the side of the bennies entree, next was the banana cream pie (we asked ours to be served with a dollop of Nutella).   Mushroom Benny was mild on the truffle taste and a little shy on the mushroom quantity but overall the side stole the show on this plate. Tuna melt with a side of tomato soup - tuna was delicious (not the canned tuna kind here) a touch under seasoned but the cheese and crunchy bread made up for it. The tomato soup was a great texture not the soupy kind of tomato soup. I wish the Belgian waffle was served warm..this was cold and very underwhelming, I'll give it a fair review when I try it freshly made (I guess this was their pit of the day..I saw a few waffles being sent back while we were waiting for our table)   The pie deserves its own paragraph. I dunno where you get your pies but I feel like I haven't seen much homemade pies served in restaurants anymore. I guess this was a special day because a local famous chef came in to make the pies, but it's at least beltliner's recipe. YOU MUST TRY THE PIE!   We were pretty hangry from all the waiting so we started stacking things to keep us entertained. But the servers and manager seemed to be on board...until we spilled the cream. Hey! At least we were fun company."}
{"text":"Not my cup of tea I guess. Service too slow, food not all that good.   The Creme Brûlée French Toast was awesome as were the spicy Lamb sausage.   The ambiance is pretty cool."}
{"text":"Really dig this place. I had a weekday off so we came here for brunch and was able to bypass all of those crazy brunch lines that usually happen on weekends.    First, let's talk about the coffee. It was delicious. Usually when you order coffee at a diner, I'm hesitant.  The coffee usually comes out as bland and uninspired frankly. But not here my friends.  So good.  And when I asked to have my coffee in a to-go cup since we had to leave early, the waitress even offered to top up my to-go cup as well at no extra charge. Talk about stellar service.  Next, the setting and atmosphere at the Beltliner is very modern and classy. Great place to catch up with friends and there's also a small patio outside as well. .  In terms of food, I ordered the 2x2x2 off the menu. Simple and easy. The sausage was a lamb sausage if I recall and it was full of flavour. My friend ordered the Baked Chocolate Milk French Toast. She wasn't a big fan of it so we'd probably order something else off the menu next time.  Will be back."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot. Coffee is fantastic here. Food is good here!   Sometime it can get a bit loud but most places that are busy will be that way. Great choices all across the menu.   Honestly didn't care for the lunch/dinner here seemed to bland. There are not alot of drink choices either."}
{"text":"We stopped in for breakfast yesterday and we're told it would be 15 mins for a table.  We waited maybe 7 mins and we were seated at a comfy booth.  The restaurant has a fun, cool interior with big windows and high ceilings.   Our server was very friendly and service was prompt.   I had the Hutterite Bacon Benny (16$ ish)  and my man friend had the Big Bankowski. (22$)   We both ordered soft poached eggs.  Our food arrived very quickly, and we dug in:)  both of our eggs were verrrrry slightly under poached, giving them a smidge of a slimy texture, totally still edible, just the gooeyness was a turn off.  The hash browns are prepared in this amazing Mille feuille style, with layer upon layer of thinly sliced potatoes baked to crispy perfection :)  the hutterite bacon was crisp but not hard, and delicious.    I would recommend this breakfast experience, although it is a little pricier than other equally as tasty diners."}
{"text":"Excellent choice. Friendly, helpful staff. Had the mushroom eggs Benedict. Interesting potatoes look like a fried block, but break up into perfect hash browns. Buttermilk waffles large & tasty. Lamb sausage tasted like lamb chorizo. Great coffee."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with a coworker.  Wow. I had the portobello mushroom burger. The best I have ever tasted. I am from Vancouver,  but will be back when I come next to Calgary."}
{"text":"The Beltliner is one of the newer diners in Calgary that is located on 12th avenue SW downtown.  I heard about The Beltliner through Yelp! new busineses, creeped some photos and been meaning to head over to give them a try.  After a gym session, a couple of guys wanted to go for brunch.  We were pondering where to go, Alex suggested The Beltliner.  I got super excited then realized that it was Sunday, around 1130am and it's normally the busiest time for brunch.  Alex mentioned that he's been there a few times and there was either no line or just a 15 minute max wait so we headed over.  We parked on the street and walked over.  Although there was no line, Dustin who had gotten there before us was told that it was a 40 minute wait.  All good, because Dustin lived a few blocks away.  He gave the hostess his number and she would call when the table was ready.    We strolled over to Dustin's to watch some tv and before we knew it the phone rang and our table was ready.  When you do the 'put your name on the waiting list and leave method' they will only hold your table for 10 minutes so don't go too far!  We arrived and got seated at a booth.  There's not much privacy because they are open booths and you can touch the table next to you if you wanted to.  The Beltliner is modern but fun diner.  The décor is cute and simple, the music is awesome and the vibe is pretty sweet.  We were poured waters and handed menus.  It's not a huge menu but there are a lot of options and to be honest, I was a bit overwhelmed only because I didn't know what I wanted!  Dustin was feeling some comfort food so he went with the tuna melt and tomato soup.  Alex decided to go with the fried chicken and waffles and I went with a bowl of tomato soup and the spicy salami benedict as suggested as one of the favorites by the waitress.  As we were waiting, I was bobbing my head to the music and admiring the space - my tomato soup quickly came out.  A nice drizzle of basil on top of the thick creamy soup - bliss!!  It was delicious and smooth.   It was an exciting moment when the rest of the food arrived.  Alex's chicken and waffles look so bomb I was jealous I didn't go with my instinct.  My spicy salami benedict didn't WOW me with the presentation, I wish the hollandaise was dripping off the egg but it was just a blob of hollandaise on each egg and it would be nice if there was a side of fruit or even a couple slices for presentation.  The potatoes are not your ordinary cubed/shredded hash browns but they were little cubes.  Thinly sliced potatoes stacked on one another and fried to a cube shape.   They were nice and crispy on the outside but stacked potatoes on the inside, I found they didn't have any flavor.  The benedict was ok.  I asked for medium poached eggs but the eggs I had were like extra soft, I thought they weren't fully cooked, the salami was nice and crispy but obviously salty and the banana peppers were a nice touch.  Alex gave me a bite of his chicken and waffles and they were deeeeeeeeeeeeelish!  3 pieces of super crispy fried chicken, fluffy waffles with some nice salty gravy.  Dustin really enjoyed his tuna melt and dipping his sandwich into the tomato soup, both guys were quite satisfied.  Our waitress was sweet and always alert.  I was surprised that they had a dinner menu because I had thought they were only a breakfast/brunch diner.  Oh! For you coffee fans, they also have a small to-go coffee counter that offers Fratello coffee, Cru Juice and house made pastries and snack!  Next time I will try something else (probably the chicken and waffles) because the benedict just didn't do it for me and grab some pastries.  AND I will have to try them out for dinner sometime!"}
{"text":"What's that you say? Hashbrowns in a cube?!  This place has piqued my quality over quantity radar, will definitely be coming back for another great meal. The brunch punch was THE perfect compliment to my meal (who thought something as simple as apricot juice and rum would taste so damn good?) The eggs benny were quite tastey as well.  You hashbrowns stay cubed and classy now, I'll be back for more of your baked and layered goodness."}
{"text":"IT was a pretty great experience. The wait to get in was 30 minutes, but they text you when your seat is ready so you can meander and do other things. They have a coffee bar when you first walk in with really good priced drinks (4 bucks for a large latte) and muffins etc.  The place was spacious and you don't feel crammed in like a lot of these diner locations.   The servers were all really nice and helpful.   Here it is.... The make it to order CAESAR.... You could pick so many options! I choose the peperoni, pickle, Chocolate cake, and a breakfast Sammie.... YES YOU GOT IT! CHOCOLATE CAKE. They all come out on skewers on top of your Caesar, not actually in it. The cake was okay, not the super huge fluffy piece of chocolate cake I was craving, but was still good once it thawed a bit. The egg sandwich was a delicious breakfast sandwich on an egg muffin. The peperoni was DISGUSTING.... and that is only because I don't like gamey meat. I asked them what kind of meat it was and it turned out to be Bison. They did mention they change their peperoni offerings regularly. I will have to give it a retry when it isn't bison. Overall it was delicious and unique experience!  I would recommend this place. OH and make it a double, it's only 3 bucks more :D"}
{"text":"It's nothing short of refreshing to be in the downtown of Calgary sitting on the Beltliner's patio tasting different bourbons , tequilas, and whatever else your heart desires for 5 bucks per drink. If you haven't considered at least stopping for one during your travels I highly suggest you do. Where else can you get a Blanton's Special Reserve for 5 bones - nowhere . And as mentioned in a previous post the food is killer upscale diner deliciousness"}
{"text":"I had the Merguez and eggs on a busy Saturday morning.  The place was busy, the food was warm , but not hot. I asked for extra bred, .. and got it after I finished my meal.   I would go again , and maybe try the same thing, I feel like I caught them on an off day."}
{"text":"We ordered the OG Ceasar with the breakfast Sammie. So delicious and fun! Interesting little eatery with a great menu! I'm super excited to come back again!"}
{"text":"One of the best service in Calgary!! Didn't have to ask anything. Things were already on my table. Thumbs up for the fast best service from a server looks like Julia Roberts~!"}
{"text":"Our continuing search for a good Sunday brunch brought us to the Beltliner. I had heard good things before, and the wife has already been here for lunch before. Met some friends here and surprised to find only a 10 minute wait for a table.  As always we base all brunch on Eggs Benedicts. As far as I'm concerned, If you can't make a good Eggs Benny and mimosa, you can't call yourself a brunch place. I'm happy to report both were PHENOMENAL. The eggs were cooked perfectly, with a good hollandaise sauce and fixins. Friendly staff, nice mix of clienetele and good location with plenty of street parking. Looking forward to coming back for lunch!"}
{"text":"Good fresh food, good size portions and friendly service. Only drawback on this place was the service time, but it's busy, which is a good thing. Really enjoyed the good and atmosphere here."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant this today for the first time and was completely disappointed. My husband and I waited 10 minutes for someone to ask us for our drink order, 20 minutes for food. I ordered grilled cheese sandwich and fries, my husband ordered the clubhouse. Our food took about 30 minutes to come, while we waited our drinks finally came. By the time our food came, our glasses were empty. The food was cold (no one should ever have to eat grilled cheese cold) when it came. Cold fries, cold sandwiches.  We had a waitress kind of ask us in passing how it was and when I started to talk, she just walked away.  If you want  diner food, don't waste your money. You will get better food and better service at Humptys."}
{"text":"Went for brunch the other day. It was average. We read on Avenue magazine that this was one of the best brunch places in Calgary. So we headed there waited 45 mins for a table (not horrible if this was the best brunch in Calgary) so we grabbed a coffee which was good! Where they lost stars was the flavour in the food. I got the lobster mac n cheese. Very bland and there was no lobster in it. My boyfriend had the chicken and waffles the oil needed to be changed it seemed because it came off really dark. But the gravy could've had more spice in it.   Great atmosphere though and was good coffee might come back for coffee!"}
{"text":"First thing that impressed me - the mug of coffee holds more than a thimble sized amount of coffee. It's also damn good coffee (which it should be, they're using great beans).  Second thing I liked - the space between tables along the banquette is actual space. Not, you need to be waif model thin in order to sneak out. This is great news, because once your tummy is full of deliciousness, you need that extra space friends.  My friend and I had a great brunch...we did the truffle mushroom bennie which was great, but not amazing. I loved their take on a hashbrown and was super responsible in that I did not eat the entire thing (I may have filled up on truffle hollandaise...oops!)  There's also great people watching here...we had quite the thrill upon noticing a see through pair of pants. What can I say - my life is pretty boring, I'll take excitement when I can get it.  Bottom line - the menu has many other delights that I'm anxious to try. You should too!"}
{"text":"Items Selected: Space Jam & Ricotta 2.0 French Toast - Blueberry Jam, Lemon Ricotta, Powdered Sugar, St. Leon Maple Syrup Perogy Poutine - Potato Cheddar Perogy, Gravy, Hutterite Bacon, Quebec Cheese Curds, Green Onions Saskatoon Berry Pie - Whipped Cream and Vanilla Bean Gelato from Fiasco Gelato  Essentially a hotel restaurant, its attachment to Fairfield Inn & Suites next to Central Memorial Park infusing the space with an everything-to-everyone feel from the kitchen forward, The Beltliner fails where many of Calgary's 'reimagined diners' succeed by way of taking itself too seriously, the focus on a theme getting in the way of good, honest cooking as the menu attempts to veer interesting before getting the basics straight.   Visited just after noon, the combination breakfast and lunch menu offering everything from Eggs to Salads or Meatloaf, it was having already perused the online options that a patient wait preceded service, the middle-aged woman not near as pleasant as the folks at Diner Deluxe, OEB or Belmont as she perfunctorily jotted down an order before moving on to the next table where she repearted the same routine without even looking up.  Trying hard to be hip, the menu running a gamut of gastropub ideas with some more typical options for those desiring something simple, it was with both appetizer and entrée delivered simultaneously that the meal got underway as The Black Keys played overhead, the \"Perogy Poutine\" a new spelling with a good concept set back by too much Gravy despite great Dumplings and gooey Curds melted to Cast Iron while the \"Space Jam & Ricotta 2.0 French Toast\" was not soaked enough for its thickness and still dougy even after adding St. Leon Maple Syrup.  Annoyed that the Monte Cristo originally entertained was not only un-fried but served with a Mustard Sauce, dessert consisted of tender Saskatoon Berries baked in an all-Butter Crust, the decision to add a scoop of locally-made Vanilla Bean Gelato enough to dissuade a planned visit to their flagship as the texture was icy and granular on the tongue."}
{"text":"A great modern diner in Vic park. The service is always great and the food is fantastic. The decor is well done and not too kitchy. I enjoyed the private washrooms and thoughtfulness to have an old oven converted to a baby change table.  The only two things that bothered me were not being able to get a real person on the phone when I tried calling to see how busy they were; when I left a message they didn't call me back, also their prices are a little expensive for what you are getting."}
{"text":"Another addition to Calgary's brunch and breakfast scene. Came her for brunch on the long weekend and it was definitely busy but not 2 hour wait busy. Me and and my gf sat at the bar in full view of the kitchen.   We started off with the coffee which didn't come in a small cup. We we were given a latte in large mason jar. Definite plus! We had ordered the chicken and waffles, creme brulee waffle, and poached egg. Here is where they start to lose stars.  The order took closer to an hour for it to arrive and but it didn't seem like it was only ours, a few others were waiting as well. When the food did arrive the chicken barely had any meat, pretty much all batter. The poached egg was cold but we were too hungry to send it back. The French toast was delicious and something I have never had before.  Overall, the service was great, our waitress made sure we were full on water, coffee and tried to speed up the kitchen. But the food definitely needs some improvement. In the end we were comped for the creme brulee. In the end I would say give this place a shot and see if you fair better with the food then I did. Happy munching"}
{"text":"The service here was great! Walked in, very quickly greeted! My coffee was served in big mugs great for the morning! The salmon Benny was fantastic! Full of flavor, the potatoes were amazing, very different and unique how is a stacked potato! Definitely worth trying!"}
{"text":"Dinner last night at Beltliner....I had the most wonderful experience.  The service was outstanding even before I ordered.  Love it when your server participates in playful banter.  I don't recall her name, but she made me laugh. I ordered a margarita that was great and then we discussed the menu.  She honestly guided me through the menu and I ended up ordering the club and tomato soup.  Both were fantastic and exactly what I wanted, even if I didn't know that before ordering.  Would love to come back next time I'm in town for business and try other items on the menu.  1) cleanliness: outstanding - you can tell they care 2) service: simply the best - loved the banter 3) atmosphere: pleasant and warm - very inviting 4) food: was really good - haven't tried the total menu, but what I did try was great.   My one and only complaint would be they don't take AmEx.... or more specifically, they don't offer up that information before ordering. As a business traveler its frustrating to use any other card than your corporate card.  I did ask before ordering if they take credit cards as I heard they didn't.  was told yes, we take.  my fault, the question should have been do you take American Express.  My experience was too good to drop a star...but it is something they should proactively point out to customers."}
{"text":"What the Beltliner does well it does very well but sometimes the chef tries to reinvent tried and true dishes with less than spectacular results. I started with an egg cream -- which I didn't know you could get in the wilds of western Canada -- and it was every bit as good at the last one I had in Brooklyn.  My guest had the steak and eggs, which was huge! and very good. My meatloaf and mashed potatoes, while tasty, were served in broth. It was basically meatloaf soup. I sent it back to remove the broth and was happy with it. Just not sure where the chef's head is at on that one.  However, let's talk about desert. I purposely left room for pie and it was not good. Not good at all. The crust on my saskatoon pie was dense and hard. You know, there is nothing shameful in serving a light, flaky, traditional crust.   All that being said, I will certainly go back because there are dishes on the menu that I quite want to try. That and they have root beer floats on tap."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I used to always come here for a late night 'breakfast for dinner' evening. Progressively it seems the food has just gotten worse along with the service. I was coming in for breakfast alone as I was working a job later on downtown nearby I figured I had more than enough time to come by eat and relax. I was sat beside the window and it took a while to be greeted, a little longer to get my drink and the server left before I could ask to place my order which was unfortunate because the restaurant wasn't as busy as I've seen it. 30 minutes or so goes by after I'd ordered (only keeping track of time since I knew I had somewhere to be) the server keeps walking by looking at me confused as i'm sure it might have been why I still didn't have my food. Another 10-15 minutes goes by and another server brings it by and leaves. My eggs/hollandaise were cold and my english muffins were hard and ended up just not eating them. Keep in mind this has been a progressive thing not a one time experience. Really disappointed as I used to recommend this place to almost everyone."}
{"text":"Enjoyed breakfast at the Beltliner during a visit to Calgary.  The coffee was strong and good.  Service was prompt and friendly.  The food was really good.  Inside it is a updated dinner feeling, that is clean and sharp."}
{"text":"I'm going with 4 stars because this place is kid friendly. Anytime a restaurant is good with kids, they get that extra bit of support from me. We were able to park our stroller at the front, where it was watched while we were eating. They have a number of highchairs, so it's convenient for those children still using them. The food was good. I had the grilled cheese and side salad. I would have liked if the sandwich was a little more grilled, but there sure was a great amount of cheese in it! My husband enjoyed his sandwich and our daughter had the pancakes. Also of note, the kids menu is priced perfectly and you get a lot of food for the price you pay."}
{"text":"Looks like an interesting diner considering I am staying at the Fairfield Inn right above. Service wise it was slow, food wise had some interesting concept but not sure if I can call it great.   Lobster Mac n Cheese claims to be fresh Atlantic lobster so I had to try it to see how fresh. In terms of lobster you probably got around 1.5 claw which makes you wonder how fresh is it and where is the rest of the meat and this is Calgary so where is the fresh Atlantic lobster from? Freshness it was a little less fresh than a restaurant that have live swimming one. The sauce was cheesy, creamy and well seasoned. The sauce was also made with lobster bits which you can see from the texture and colour.   The pie fries was an interesting concept. Pie strips (apple in this case) with vanilla cream. It is a finger food dessert. I like it but wish there was a little more apple in it."}
{"text":"Ecstatic that this place is 2 blocks from me, because even it were miles away I'd be a regular.  Everything is done well here - relaxing decor, friendly staff, huge coffees, cocktails and beer, and morning comfort food of the highest degree.  The menu has all the classics, but with minor twists that will have you wanting to order two plates.  Sat at the bar and got the eggs Benedict and the chicken and waffles- both perfect for sharing.  Both were great, not much else to say - I would definitely order again but will explore the menu a bit more next time (French toast and pancakes looked delicious)  Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Went on a saturday with a close friend only because of the convenience in location.  We got there around 1pm, was packed and had waited about 20-30 minutes.  The service was great - friendly staff, speed of service was prompt, and the atmosphere itself was great  But i was abit underwhelmed by the food. They had a decent variety of options for brunch, but both the hashbrowns and eggs benedicts weren't that great to taste"}
{"text":"The food here is solid.  Service is always very friendly and prompt.  Portion sizes are on the larger size and pricing is in line with standard diner fare. The is the perfect location for a downtown stay good for business lunches.  Business lunches at this location are a perfect fit with their location and the speedy service.  Fantastic atmosphere in the heart of the Beltline."}
{"text":"Club sandwich was all bread no meat. Fries were good but not worth $15. Service was good and quick."}
{"text":"Seems like most people dislike this place for the service, so fortunately our service was great on a Sunday for breakfast (930 am isn't really brunch is it?)  A party of 4 plus my little one had lots of space and luckily it was pretty kid friendly - high chairs and lots of other lil babies around.    Our server was friendly and prompt, refilling coffee once during the meal.    I ordered the french toast and was happy with the ricotta and berries - although a few more berries would have been nice.   My chai latte was somewhat underwhelming, lacking in a robust chai flavour, but overall my experience here was great.  Next time I am getting the hashbrowns, as my husband got them and I wanted to eat them all from his plate!!"}
{"text":"We live around the corner from The Beltliner so naturally we were pretty excited when they opened their doors. There were a few growing pains when they first opened up, but we forgave them when we tasted the food! We've been a few times and are making our way through their menu. The Chicken and Waffles are a favourite, as is the tomato soup. We've also tried the 2x2x2, the mushroom as well as the salami Benedict, the Beltliner burger, grilled cheese sandwich, French toast, rabbit stew, as well as about 3 different pies. We haven't been disappointed with anything we've ordered. I love that they serve delicious Fratello coffee in massive mugs, and that they automatically bring you ice water. The servers are friendly and knowledgable about the menu. Keep up the good work Beltliner! We'll keep coming!"}
