{"text":"The lunch \"bento box\" is an unbeatable value. For $10 you get miso soup, small salad, 6 pieces California roll, main dish with rice and ice cream for dessert. Sometimes they have sesame ice cream, very delicious. There are other lunch specials with sushi for a few dollars more.
The restaurant has a modern feel, there's a large amount of seating, and it's clean. It's a little noisy, but I guess that helps with the vibrant atmosphere.
It's sometimes hard to wave down the staff, but they are quite prompt once you catch their attention."}
{"text":"Sorry folks, but the food here last night was yuck!

I think they figured that since everyone was going to be eating on patios in the abnormally warm weather, they might as well serve the lunch leftovers.  

Edamame is not supposed to be yellow-green, soft and sitting in 3cm of warm water.  I went to pick up the first piece and it dripped all over the table and my hand.

The servers kept forgetting us, so we had to keep calling them over.

Salad also arrived sitting in 3cm of water and the lettuce was transparent.  Clearly this was not a salad made within the last 24 hours.  The miso soup was good.

I had vegetarian sushi: avocado roll, sweet potato roll, asparagus roll.  Not bad, even though the asparagus rolls were unravelling.

My friend had: spicy tuna roll, spicy salmon roll and something else that she didn't finish because she said it was mediocre.

I was terribly disappointed.  I have eaten at the Thornhill one, which is why I suggested eating at this one and boy oh boy did I regret it."}
{"text":"Not the best, but not the worst place: it's good for rolls but the sashimi is average (decent considering the prices).  It's pretty big and even on Friday night seating hasn't been an issue.  The service is also pretty prompt.  In the winter time it can get chilly near the door, so I'd recommend trying to sit as far as possible unless you want to keep your coat on."}
{"text":"I am visiting in Toronto, staying next door to Ginza. Ordered food to go. Tom yum  soup with shrimp - vegetables where not fresh, and soup was tasteless. For the main dish I had seafood stir fried noodles. Again tasteless. It was so bad I am not going to give them a second chance."}
{"text":"Opened an account just for this experience. In one word: terrible.

The service was completely abominable. Waitress was extremely rude. Barely listened when I placed my order, only to come back and ask me to repeat my order. Food sub-par at best.

Honestly, if you're looking for cheap sushi in Yorkville, there are much better places to go than this."}
{"text":"GREAT PLACE!!!

PRICE: 
Very reasonable especially considering it's in Yorkville. You're looking at $5-$12 for single rolls. They also give 10% if you pay with cash for take-out orders. 

SERVICE: 
Wonderful! The ladies there are amazing and very accommodating. They always have a genuine smile and try to help whenever they can. Love Claire and Cynthia!

AMBIANCE: 
It's not the best date night kind of place considering it's quite an open space but the overall decoration is quite unique and cool. White tables, chairs and lines across the walls are backlit with pink lighting. Great place to go with friends and coworkers.

FOOD: 
Great quality food. Portions (in speaking of their sashimi) are very generous and always fresh. I've been to many other sushi restaurants including Asuka in the area which charges a lot more and I can honesty say that Ginza is up to par with them in freshness and portions. 

DO NOT MISS: 
If you go, which you should, do not forget to try the following:
- Salmon sushi pizza (best sushi pizza I have ever had anywhere...hands down.)
- Kamakachi roll
- Spicy chopped scallop sushi
- Spicy tuna roll"}
{"text":"I first noticed this place because of the \"We now serve ramen!\" sign out front. Had it once and the service size was quite large. Returned a couple other times only to discover this latest time that they've removed the ramen specials from the menu, even though it's still on the menu sign outside of the restaurant. Disappointing.. Otherwise though, the prices are good and servings are plentiful.

Also, for lunch they usually just give you the all you can eat menu but there is an actual a la carte menu with lunch specials, if asked. More selection on there if you don't want a buffet."}
{"text":"came here for lunch on a whim and was pleasantly surprised! the lunch menu had a lot of options and were at decent prices.

I ordered a bento box and it came with a good amount of food. I felt like I got more than i paid for!"}
{"text":"Food is ok, as well as the service. If you want really good sashimi, go to some Japanese operated restaurants."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I have to retract the raving review I wrote about Ginza earlier.  Something happened to this place around summer 2012, perhaps a new management or a new ownership.  The tablecloths disappeared together with the friendly servers.  The new servers are inexperienced with very poor English.  Can someone teach that waitress not to grab my glass with her dirty hands on the rim where I am going to put it in my mouth?!?  The menu is the same, but the sushimi pieces seem to be smaller.  Also, I have a suspicion that the soy sauce that they pour into the 'light' sauce bottles is not so light, so beware."}
{"text":"My subsequent visits to this restaurant were lovely! I think their food is quite delicious and fresh, appropriately priced a notch above the psychological $10 mark. My advice would be to opt for their bento box lunches; the variety and taste is amazing."}
{"text":"I never got a chance to order from them as they refused to deliver to my building because of a previous parking ticket in the area. I thought this was pretty unreasonable and pathetic service."}
{"text":"It's a nice restaurant 
the sushi is not the best, I had better sushi before 
friendly restaurant to go with your kids
overall we had a nice experience"}
{"text":"This place is pretty terrible. Tasteless/ boring rolls, average service, lame decor. The food was so forgettable I'm surprised I remembered to write this review."}
{"text":"I did not find the food here particularly memorable.  I ordered a short rib bento box, which came with pieces of sushi and dumplings. For $14, the portions were fairly large. The short ribs, however, were very dry and chewy. My friend ordered chicken teriyaki, which was so unnaturally dry. 

After some thought, we asked them if it was possible to re-cook the chicken.  They were understanding and promptly brought out another batch.  

As a whole, the service here was great -- the waiters are very friendly and attentive. The food left something to be desired.  I may return to try the other dishes, since the prices (for this area of the neighbourhood) seems to be a good deal."}
{"text":"Neither great, nor horrible. On Easter Sunday the restaurant was as expected, empty.  Still service was slow. Well priced and good amount of food, but the Ginza and Rock-N-Roll rolls were almost too big. For the less experience chop-sticker, it made for a messy situation. Won't be rushing back."}
{"text":"Mmm... I like!  I pass by this place a lot and bypass it just as many times because I thought their prices would be the same as other excellent, but pricy restaurants in the Bay-Bloor vicinity.   The exterior at a very quick glance does look very design-y so I never really gave it a second thought.  I'm so glad I finally made a stop here!

For $13 plus tax and tip, I got an 18 maki (spicy tuna, dynamite, California) set of fresh, delicious rolls that were beautifully made, with the main ingredients surrounded by a thin layer of rice.  There was none of the thick sticky rice mess you would experience in other inferior sushi places that seem to proliferate in Toronto.  The set came with a not-salty (!) miso soup and a tasty salad.  Edamame was complimentary.  We also got the Ginza combo for one ($16) that came with a generous portion of sushi, sashimi and a handroll.  Everything was just made so well, with that extra touch of care and attention to the quality of the food.  Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"I will give it 3.5 Star.
It is actually one of my fav sushi place in terms of the quality of the food.
Miso soup and black cod it really good.

However, compared to before, the size of the roll as well as the black cod gets smaller.
Price is slightly expensive compared to other sushi resturants. 
These two are the main reasons i only gave out 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"I don't know why people don't find it very weird when totally different Asian cuisines are mashed together. Ever eaten at Michael's CrÃªpes and Gefilte Fish? Didn't think so.

Cultural Frankensteining aside, it really adds another dimension to AYCE ordering. Sometimes you just feel like cleansing your palate between bites of sashimi with a random order of fried coconut shrimp, Pad Thai, curry or Har Gow (oh yeah, Ginza throws a little Chinese dim sum in there too, while they're at it).

My picks: seaweed salad, white tuna, salmon sushi pizza, and sure, the coconut shrimp. Bottomless lunch is $14. Go nuts."}
{"text":"I looovee sushi, and this place was kinda a disappointment :( 
The decor is nice...but it doesnt make up for the sushi.
First off, I thought it had worms in my edamame beans! HOLY CRAP. but it turned out they were pieces of black soba noodles scattered in my dish.....
We ordered the ginza roll, spicy salmon roll, and some sort of scallop roll.

the ginza roll was pretty big as people had described, but not too big to fit in my fat mouth!! haha! it had a lot of things in it, which SOUNDED good--soft shell cramp, shrimp, salmon-the works! but it soft shell crab was cold and the favors just werent there.

the spicy salmon roll--was just a salmon roll with some kind of hot sauce that i didn't even like--so that was a disappointment as its a pretty basic roll! usually i like it when they at least chop up the salmon and mix it with a spicy sauce!

the scallop roll (i forget what it was called) was pretty good! better than the spicy salmon roll..nice and soft.

overall the rolls are pretty small, except the speciality ones. and i dont think i will make this my go-to-place for sushi.

it just needs more life in its food and service!!!"}
{"text":"Ah Ginza. You were once so fresh, so new, so completely next-door to my office, and your lunch specials were so outrageously priced it was almost more expensive for me NOT to frequent your establishment.

When it first opened, I was there. 6 bucks for miso, salad, edamame, and a bento or sushi combo or sashimi bowl. Then it was 7. Then it was 8. Now, the lunch specials average around 11 dollars, and the lunch AYCE is 13.99 Should you pay the extra 3 dollars? Yes. The AYCE menu includes a few Dim Sum options, all the appetizers, all the sushi and sashimi. It also features a few thai selections. My advice is to either prepare yourself to eat all that you can, or go somewhere else with cheaper lunch specials (Sushi Club on Charles perhaps?)

The sushi is above average quality - not as good as Wow! (but who is?) but far better than a lot of the yorkville/bloor station area alternatives. There are cheaper AYCE places in the neighbourhood (Natural, Aji Sai to name a couple) but Ginza's fish is tastier, their rolls are better made, and their selection is superior. The service tends to be sparse around lunchtime, but you can still get in and out, fully satisfied in an hour."}
{"text":"I've been to this location several times and I must admit, the main reason why I eat here is because the prices are incredibly \"cheap\" for a Yorkville location. 

My experiences at this restaurant have ranged from good to disappointing. I suppose it depends on the waiter/waitress that you get. There was one time when the service was so slow my friend and I could have snuck out without paying (but we didn't!), and there were other times the service was quick and efficient. Nothing really consistent with the service, but again, it all depends on who your server is. 

The one thing that I can say is consistent about this place is the quality of the food which is comparable to your average take out sushi joint. Nothing great or unique about the taste or plating, pretty standard and edible. I usually order the \"Ginza Favourites - Bento Box\" which consists of miso soup, salad, salmon sushi, fried dumplings, shrimp sushi, california rolls, steamed rice and ice cream. For $12 this meal is a bargain considering the amount of food you are getting! The ice cream was freezer burnt a few times but I guess ultimately you are getting what you pay for!

Overall, if you happen to be in the Yorkville area and are not willing to fork out a lot of cash this is a good alternative for a cheap meal."}
{"text":"Large portions, good sizes. Fire Cracker Dream and Golden California Roll, both with good flavor. The prices were really good too."}
{"text":"Nice decor and decent service, but underwhelming sashimi. The escolar (or super white tuna) was just shy of still frozen so I could still feel/taste the ice crystals while I ate. The octopus tasted slightly fishy. I also sampled their Philadelphia roll, which was a'ight, but nothing special. On the bright side, I liked the house salad -- the ginger sesame dressing is served on the side, so you don't have to drown the greens if you don't want to. Also a plus: free edamame. Outside of those two things... Ginza is alright, but not really worth a special trip."}
{"text":"Love this place - it's my default \"let's do sushi tonight\" place. 

Am proud to say I found this place before everyone else did through that Groupon-type promotion last week!

One of the best things about Ginza is that they start you off with a bowl of free edamame. Yes, the stuff you pay up to $8 for as an appy elsewhere, this place gives it to you free (and rightfully so, I've never ordered an edamame starter since spotting bags of 'em at T&T Supermarket for $1.99). 

I've been to Ginza countless times so I won't be writing a story about my \"first time\" (though I must say, it was deliciously memorable!) so I'll spew out a list of must-trys:

- Combo GS5: a good mix of dynamite roll, cali roll and I think it's a spicy tuna roll but either way it's got big hunks of tuna and doesn't taste all mercurial! And comes with miso soup (and the flavour has depth, unlike the watered down stuff I've come across).

- Dragon Roll - it looks like a dragon! basically it's like a big dynamite roll topped with avocado

- Pad Thai with chicken - generous amounts of perfectly cooked chicken and the best sweet&sour pad thai tasting sauce.

The above three are my staples there but the Boston Lobster roll (lobster inside! and the entire roll is deep fried and drizzled with mango sauce) and the Ginza roll (soft shell crab!) is worth a try too though the are priced at $15. 

Anyway....in a nutshell....get your bum over to Ginza for sushi!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't have come across this restaurant if it weren't for the group deal last year. My review is based on the sushi/sashimi side of the dinner menu. As mentioned, they start you off with a bowl of edamame beans before we even ordered anything.

Ordered:
Ginza Roll - You can't go wrong with their signature roll, right? For $15, it was well worth it. It was huge. I could barely fit 1 pc into my mouth. Topped with unagi and sweet shrimp, with soft shell crab & shrimp tempura. Absolute heaven.

Spicy Kamakachi roll - Topped with smoked salmon, with tempura bits and spicy sauce. 

Seafood tempura - What a platter. I never had soft shell crab, crab meat, squid, cooked salmon, scallop in tempura batter. Then again, anything in tempura batter is good.  It didn't disappoint.

Sashimi boat (15 pcs) - Very fresh and tasty. 

Fried banana w/ icecream (FBI)- Served in a martini glass. Loved the presentation. And it was amazing. The fried banana was soft and crispy, served along  green tea ice cream. I would honestly come back just for this one again.

Despite hearing reviews about other restaurants treating customers poorly with their group deals, this one disproves that. The waitresses were friendly and attentive. There was hardly a moment where my cup of tea was empty! They encouraged that I could order take out for home as there was money left in my voucher instead of leaving it to waste.

There's a number of signature rolls that I didn't have a chance to try. I would definitely go back for round 2."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Ginza, but unfortunately was a bit disappointed.

I came here for dinner with some friends to try out an Asian restaurant in the area that none of us had ever been to before. We were welcomed and immediately brought complimentary green tea. I love it when restaurants do this without you having to ask for it. I also like that all of the tables had low-sodium soy sauce so you didn't have to ask for it. The restaurant is clean; however, the menus are looking a bit worn out. I 

I ordered three smaller dishes:
1) Mango Salad ($5) - mango, green / red peppers, and white / red onion slices - this was fine, although a fair amount of the mango was not ripe enough so was a bit tough to eat. 
2) Asparagus roll ($3.50) - basic 6 pieces of asparagus maki. I liked how the asparagus was steamed and not tempura. 
3) BBQ Squid ($6) - this was my most disappointing dish of the night. I love good grilled squid, so this is a critical dish for me! For starters, it arrived quite a bit longer after my other dishes and my friends' dishes - to the point that I had to ask the waitress if it was coming because I wasn't sure if they had forgotten about it or not. Once it arrived it was way too overcooked. It was charred in many places and a lot of pieces were extremely tough, making it inedible. 

I may return to Ginza in the future, although I would try different dishes. I wouldn't rush back here as there are many other Asian restaurants in the neighbourhood where I have had better food at a similar price point."}
{"text":"Food was good. Service was ok. Nothing stood out. Good workday lunch place. I believe they do have a really well priced take-out special that we did not take advantage of."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant on several occasions.  On most occasions, while fresh, the sushi is sloppily arranged and spicy rolls aren't really spicy at all.  The tempura is heavy, with bits falling everywhere.  There isn't a great deal of bento box variety and the portion sizes are inconsistent.  But worst of all was my most recent experience here, due to the service.  When ordering, those in my party did not receive orders at the same time - not even within 10 minutes of one another.  When ready to pay and leave, waiters looked at us, made eye contact as we signalled we were ready to pay, then turned and walked away.  After a half hour of this dance, they finally decided to let us pay, at which point they accused us of not paying the full bill - because they couldn't do math.

I've also had the thai offerings at this restaurant, which are at best sub-par.  There is much better thai and sushi in this city - and even within the city block - for equivalent or better prices.  And, the service is better elsewhere. Don't go here."}
{"text":"Update: they still don't bring much of your food, and their machines calculate tip AFTER tax. Beware. 

Started well and ended disappointingly. 

Food way better than expected; enjoyed fried tofu, grilled eggplant, green dragon roll. 

Unfortunately after that initial first round of serving our order, we seemed to be missing several things we ordered and service, despite a quiet half-filled restaurant, became enragingly slow. I don't appreciate waiting twenty minutes for the bill I asked for and missing part of my order. After asking more than once. 

Ps they seem to serve sesame balls as one half per order .... This is the first time I've gotten half of a whole as one order anywhere. Unimpressed!

I'll revisit with a sharp eye."}
{"text":"Made a reservation, confirmed on the phone. Arrived at the time and they didn't honour it"}
{"text":"My mother said this was the best sushi she'd ever eaten. And it was delivery. And she's from New York. So that's saying something. 

The portions were satisfying and everything they did was perfect , whether it was a slab of tuna on rice or a cucumber maki or something fancier. Yes, I got sweet potato tempura rolls, and yes, they were absolutely perfect with a bit of spicy mayo. The little things were surprising too, such as spinach in the salad rather than iceberg lettuce.

Better than Izu? Possibly. Definitely less expensive. Delivery was fast and their map is huge if you order $35 worth of stuff. I wasn't at home this time but I'll be ordering it from many parts of the city."}
{"text":"Trendy atmosphere and I was excite to go here because the menu is really unique but I was disappointed. It sounds more unique than it tastes and I probably won't be back to this place when there are better sushi places around."}
{"text":"Yorkville isn't  known as a destination for Sushi, or Japanese food for that matter, but if you ask me I'd say Ginza is the creme of the Yorkville sushi crop.

With a super slick post-mod minimalist interior Ginza is an aesthetically pleasing space, not surprising as it is afterall named for the ritziest neighbourhood in Tokyo.

Food is quite good and served quickly here by black-clad servers who are smilingly subserviant.  Thumbs waaay up for the  Boston Lobster Tempura roll which is drizzled in mango reduction...simply a must have and in fact every dish I've tasted at Ginza is pretty fab.  Considering that Ginza is located in Yorkville, the pricing here is very fair and comparable to those \"Sushi Alley\" eateries, which serve a far lesser quality of Japanese fare.

My only caveat was the sob-fest elevator tunes playing in the background namely the Barry Manilow, Barbra Streisand, Lionel Ritchie WTF did we time warp back to 1979!?!  
It did nothing to help the mood as I was meeting up with a dear friend who was needless to say having relationship issues and nothing beats talking about breakups while listening to \"Endless Love\" and \"The Way We Were\" play in the background...sniff

Ginza, come for the delicious well priced food and ambiance...just not  for the music."}
{"text":"Came here hungry after listening to a lecture at UfT. My overall experience was good but not amazing. 

Service: the lady who say us wasn't very warm. My boyfriend tried to order a cocktail and she said \"we don't have cocktail\" I was confused so I asked if she meant they didn't have a liquor license but she explained they only had beer and wine but she seemed annoyed. When I asked for another ayce sheet she said ok and never came back lol. Our actual  server  was a sweetheart! He seemed a bit shy but he was very attentive and his service was speedy. Drinks were always refilled and he checked on us regularly throughout the meal. 

Food: came here for ayce sushi for dinner. About 25 a person which I found average. The sushi was fresh and I regret not ordering more nigiri. I was disappointed that shrimp tempura was not included in ayce only veggies. I'm also not a fan of mayonnaise and that spicy ketchup in my sushi. I could if fine without it."}
{"text":"This new Ginza location opened up last year, they have a few other locations.

The interior here at the Yorkville location is super nice. Boss took me for lunch today and we were both impressed. (Normally we go to Shogun, which tries for a more traditional Japanese style look). Ginza, on the other hand, is very modern looking.

This place is busy at lunch but the service was incredible. Fast and efficient, no messing around.

Good lunch deals too. Fancy bentos for ranging from $6.99 for gyoza to $11.99 for blackened cod. Most were $9.99. Bentos come with 3 pieces california roll, 3 pieces salmon, rice, salad and miso. Plus free ice cream.

Ginza gives out free edamame too. That is awesome. We were brought a big bowl of it with our tea, immediately after we sat down. 

I tried a spicy chicken bento. Chicken came out lightly breaded, not greasy, and topped with a tasty spicy red sauce. Portions were not huge but definitely more than adequate for lunch. 

The menu here is really impressive, loads of options. Sushi and thai food. Weird combination. 

I need to go back and try some of the signature rolls, I saw some of them coming out to other tables and they looked gorgeous. Very fancy and artistic. Hopefully they taste good. 

This place has 5 star potential if repeat visits continue to impress."}
{"text":"Just went back recently to try their lunch special! Wowza! For something like $12 you get a very delectable bento box. It comes with miso soup + salad + 1 terriyaki component + rice + potato pancake + 8 piece roll + ice cream.

How does their bento box differ from other places?
1. More options than just beef/chicken/salmon terriyaki. I had eel :)
2. The miso soup had some interesting new ingredients, these tiny thin mushrooms. A nice surprise.
3. The rice is actually sticky and quite a generous serving.
4. Refreshing component of a potato pancake. What a great idea and definitely authentic Japanese (which is a surprise because this place is run by Thai).
5. The 8 piece roll that comes with it is not those lame cucumber rolls. I had a lovely spicy salmon roll with generous portions of salmon mixed with some hot sauce.
6. And I got ice cream!!

As per usual, you get some edamame for free!

Great lunch deal, very filling, very delicious and good service!"}
{"text":"I tried the Shabu Shabu, which was a new item on the menu (with a huge poster on the front door, inviting you to try it). Unfortunatley, it was a complete miss. Waiters seemed to just discover how the portable heating system was working. One of them even seemed not to know that there is a need to add water when the pot runs out of it (she looked at it smiling when the veggies started to roast instead of boiling... I was nice enough to tell her that some water should be added again). Meat was not good (frozen and bland, if not with a suspicious taste - I am still hoping not to get sick tonite...). Forget about it...

Also tried some special dragon rolls... 8 cm in diameter is too big! and most importantly, it was not really good and not tasty...

hopefully I took a Sapporo bier, which may kill the germs... and save my life.

(why 2 and not only 1... the setting is nice and staff remain nice, but a litlle bit lost somewhere in the twilight zone in the 1970s... like the background music)."}
{"text":"Went here today for lunch. The food was not terrible but it also wasn't the best either. I've definitely had better. The sushi was okay, the tempura was less then average (the crispness was not there), the teriyaki was okay and the fried rice was terrible, and the edamame was undercooked and came with no salt. My usual sushi place is Akita just down the road, and I'll just stick to that for the time being. The price was pretty cheap though, but you also get what you pay for."}
{"text":"The sushi at Ginza isn't great, but it's affordable.

I had dinner there last week and ordered a Sushi Combo #1 ($16), and substituted the Tuna for Hamachi (+$1), and ordered 1 Ikura ($2.50).

The meal was filling.  The Salmon piece were decent, but the Ikura (Salmon Roe) was not good at all.

I'm giving Ginza a 3 because their prices were not a rip off.  The place isn't an authentic Japanese place though, but it doesn't take someone Japanese to realize this."}
{"text":"Went for AYCE and a lot of food we ordered didn't get through and we ended up having to reorder and wait. Service was also disappointing. Overpriced for this kind of quality."}
{"text":"After getting rained on I decided to take shelter and have lunch at this place by myself. The hostess was very sincere and handed me a paper towel to dry myself.
I saw a lot of well dressed people and a bunch of hip young crowd at the next table. 
I thought to myself I should invite my friends here next time we want to go out.
The price is very good and the philadelphia cheese/salmon roll met high my expectations."}
{"text":"Yoicks.  First, I will preface my review with the fact that pan-Asian restaurants in Toronto are pretty darn awful - they offer everything, but don't do any dish quite right!  However, having a hankering for sushi and this being the closest place, I decided to get some takeout spicy salmon rolls.

When I picked it up, the sushi chef was yapping away on a bluetooth headset and there were hundreds of rolls being made, ready to be served, under some plastic wrap.  Some looked like they had been sitting there for a few hours.  

When I unwrapped my spicy salmon rolls, the fish was a strange greyish hue - now I know farmed salmon is naturally not pink and they often add dyes into the feed to make it pink - but this just looked unappetizing.  The rolls were loosely rolled and all the filling was falling everywhere, and the \"spicy\" bit - which is usually hot sauce and kewpie mayonnaise, was very badly mixed (in fact, I think theirs was just sriracha).  Nevertheless, I ate it, and it tasted okay, and I wasn't sick afterwards.  So, for a quick and desperate bite of sushi, I may come back again."}
{"text":"Came here on my first Toronto visit with a friend and we loved it! Service was great, although we seemed to get there just before they had a crazy lunch rush. 

The rolls tasted fresh, the menu had some of my favorite \"girly\" martinis listed which was a plus, and the prices were decent.

A nice place to come for lunch if you are waiting on checking into your room at the Delta Chelsea :)"}
