{"text":"Unfortunately this review will not be glowing with praise. First, our waitperson was unfriendly,to say the least. Seemed as if she would rather have been somewhere else. Food was mediocre. Whoever the manager of this place is needs to realize that just because you are onsite to a senior community there are many other places to eat that seem to be much more receptive to their clientele. Pricing here is fairly average but one thing I noticed was an up charge to split a plate. And then our waitperson said everyone around here does it. NOT TRUE!   It is my understanding that the owners of the golf course also own the Tavern. Guess that says a lot cause they don't care about how the staff in pro shop treats residents here.   Needless to say, I will be limiting my dining in this establishment to very few or none. Not that I think anyone cares."}
{"text":"Formerly the Blue Heron Grill, the Tavern by the Lake is under new management, has a new menu and new chef and kitchen crew.  We recently had a club dinner for the Old Stogies.  It was sit-down and a set menu which ended up to be a refreshingly wonderful surprise.  The New Years dinner was horrible, but we were overjoyed at just how good the Tavern could be.  A wine distributor was brought in to give us information on the four wines accompanying our dinner and he was short and sweet in cluing us in and not giving us more information than we ever wanted.  The first course was a hot shrimp scampi which ended up to be lemony linguini topped with three shrimp.  The shrimp were nothing to discuss but the linguine was simply delicious.  The spices and the lemon made for a great appetizer.  Following were ravioli \"pillows\" which we know from travel in Argentina as Sorrentinos.  These were stuffed with four cheeses topped with a creamy vodka sauce.  Simply wonderful and now the tables were talking about why these first two items were not on the regular menu.  The main course were short ribs atop mushroom risotto covered with a thick rich red wine sauce.  Holy moly!  Was this good and few could finish the portion served.  The matching wine was heavy enough for the richness of this dish so it was a perfect match.  Cannoli drizzled with chocolate coupled with Prosecco wine finished the meal.  So if you are in or around Sun City and you think of the old Blue Heron, please think again.  Something new is in town."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times in the past few years . A nice clean atmosphere to dine  to include buffet events. The current chef aims to please  and prepare food in a small limited kitchen.  The food from past and present chefs has improved but what lacks is the wait staff.  The   somewhat limited menu  offers foods such as a fish ,chicken and a steak dish, french onion soup,  soup of the day, several salads and several appetizers. Basic easy  desserts like brownies , cheesecake and ice cream     Our meal from a few months ago was almost a turning point not to return. Our appetizers, soup   salads plus main course all were served together after a 45 minute wait.The waitress had to be asked to refill our waters. As we were eating, she  laid our checks on the table never asking if we wanted dessert or coffee. Our dining mates said the food was okay ( fried fish special,  a grilled steak, soup , salad) , all nothing special though food was brought out hot and plated nicely.  In the past we attended a private party in  a separate private rented room. 6 pm dinner turned into an 8 pm dinner because one of the wait staff that was hired for the party was removed to the main dining room to help with restaurant dinner service.  However we have in the past  enjoyed  buffet meals and dinners here. So even though our experiences have been varied with inconsistency of quality and wait staff service, we would certainly try another time.  The  new chef we met has a challenge using the small limited kitchen that probably was never intended for extensive culinary preparation. He intends to improve menu choices etc.  Stand by for future updates because we will try some future meals again Update: from 3 to 4 stars rating. We have recently eaten here and invited out for karaoke night , an event which used to be a regular feature at Tavern on the Lakes . The place was packed . We were surprised that we had  attentive waitress service since in the past service was an issue not so much the food .  The food was very good  and tasty, came out in good portions,  nicely plated,  and hot.   However,  whatever was ordered such as salad, appetizer and entree all came out at the same time . The noise  level here was so loud it was hard to talk with each-other at the table . Menu prices reasonable,  beer and wine menu, overall more menu choices added.  We did enjoy ourselves and probably would return again. UPDATE:  May 2018 now 5 stars. we have eaten here again, last year and this year for Passover Seder and most recently for Mother's Day Brunch. Buffets all good. Hard to please everyone but something for everyone. Salad, potato, green vegetable brisket just to name a few at March's buffet. Brisket at buffet in March tender but very salty for many tastes. Desserts  usually berries and whip cream and  macaroon cookies. Today's Mothers day buffet, one of the best so far : deviled eggs, chicken salad in croissants, waffles, quiches   bacon, green salad, baked salmon, roast beef with, mushroom gravy, steamed broccoli and carrots, sour cream coffee cake, and a beautiful dessert table just to name the highlights. Food was tasty and hot. Salmon tender, beef mostly tender, neither over salted. Chicken salad delish. Everything cooked and baked on the premises. The 4 of us thought the coffee cake was the best pastry, tender and moist  Wait staff efficient and accommodating. Price with tax and gratuity about $32 per person. Food displayed nicely, hot food served hot. All in all a wonderful buffet. Most recent photos  taken today on main page of Tavern on The Lakes"}
{"text":"The food is excellent and the wait staff is knowledgeable and helpful. There are a lot of restaurants in Indian Land, but my out-of-town guests always opt for this. Except for the Friday night fish fry, it is usually not crowded. However, reservations are suggested. It is very convenient to Waxhaw via Jim Wilson Road.   Note that it is in the clubhouse of a public golf course in the middle of Sun City Carolina Lakes. There is a guardhouse at the entrance, but it is for information only, since the roads are now public."}
