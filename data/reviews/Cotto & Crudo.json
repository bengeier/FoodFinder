{"text":"I have been to this establishment twice.
And on both occasions I have felt like I wasted my time and hard earned money. 
They are amateurs in the restaurant business."}
{"text":"This place is great it's close to my office so I just walk over for lunch. The service is great from the servers to the cook, and so is the food.
I have tried their veal sandwich, salad, and steak and every single one has impressed me so far.
Definitely a great place."}
{"text":"Well I was hungry and found this place. Went in as it said Italian and was ready for my usual disappointment with this country's fake Italian culture. I looked around and said ok the place looks comfortable. There is a small hot table sort of thing and a menu as well. Ok cool so far. Oh and they are actually speaking Italian. Well the anticipation is killing me let's order some food and see what they got. I ordered some of the Friday special fish. Well hey what's up with this it's actually really good. And there is no attitude from the staff. People are acutely friendly. Like really not that fake pretentious friendly but actual eye contact friendly. Then I ordered my go to sausage sandwich. Wow this is really good. So I'm really confused because this place has nice friendly staff with authentic really really good real Italian food. Why is it so hard for other places to do this. I have reviewed several places and I'm very critical especially if you claim to be Italian. This place seams to be able to do this perfectly with little effort. It's very refreshing to see this place function. I don't think they could tell by me just sitting there in amazement at the place but it's really good and I don't just say that. My suggestion for all other Italian places to go by here and have a bite to eat. And please try to learn something. 
I will stop by here every chance I get. I would defiantly stop by with clients I'm trying to impress. 
Great job people please keep up the amazing job."}
{"text":"Simple simple simple. Local Italian Erie Servicing businesses and the local area. Pizza Pasta and some meat entrees with a limited menu.  Everything seems to be made fresh daily with very limited seasoning and or flavor.  Excellent service with tentative wait staff.

Portions are nice. Pizza and pastas are large.  Meat entrees are there. Sandwiches  are fresh  and look amazing  with typical choices of toppings including hot peppers onions mushrooms.  Excellent coffee with homemade Italian sugar cookies.

Atmosphere has been updated with a cool and new trendy look not typical for the local Italian Diner in the area. 

Some of the items were priced fairly and we're good value for lunch and some items I felt were overpriced. I definitely will give this place another shot, but I won't be rushing back anytime soon.

Reasonably simple wine selection starting from $20 and up for both red and white."}
{"text":"Walking into Cotto & Crudo immediately brought me back to Italy, and the best part was it was less than 3 minutes away from my office making it an ideal go to lunch spot under $13. The employees were friendly and bilingual in both Italian and English. A majority of the menu is made to order -- the rigatoni Carbonara we ordered (I know, not very 'Italian' but the heart wants what it wants) was fresh and piping hot and full of creamy, heavenly goodness and loaded with bits of ham and other things that were going to have me avoiding the scale for a few days. 

The only \"aw, maaaan\" factor is their hours. I made the recommendation as a dinner option to my co worker and when she arrived there at a little after 5:30pm, they were closed for the day. Cotto & Crudo is going to make for some seriously fierce competition in the other wise perpetually packed Dimanno Bakery that's a few blocks away."}
