{"text":"My friends graduation gathering turned into a terrible experience because of the server and manager's lack of respect and customer service."}
{"text":"This is one of the few places on campus where you can have a \"proper sit-down meal\" in a quieter setting at the University. It has gone through a few different name and decor changes over the years, and overall, the quality has stayed about the same.  They have a decent variety on the menu, though it is largely predictable: burgers, club sandwiches, quesadillas, etc. Don't expect to have your socks blown off, but if you are looking for a place on campus to have a grown-up meal, this is pretty much your best, if not only, option."}
{"text":"The Last Defense Lounge is yet another place on the U of C campus you can find a beer and a burger. But the somewhat more secluded location and brighter ambiance makes it my choice over the Den (which I am way too old to be in now) and the related Black Lounge.   The food here is actually pretty ok. They offer sandwiches, pizzas, burgers, salads and all the usual stuff with some things like fish tacos and rice bowls mixed in. Working on campus makes this a convenient place to have lunch, and I find the food to be a cut above the Den/Black Lounge.   So if you're on campus, stop here for lunch, and check out their daily drink specials. Some of them are pretty decent!"}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've had in recent memory.  The house made chips were a great side. Great service nice patio.  Definitely would repeat."}
{"text":"Food was good and prepared exactly how I asked but nothing to brag about. I ordered a burger and fries and they were good, but the burger does not come with cheese. Paying extra for cheese was not a fun surprise."}
{"text":"LDL is the best place to have a casual sit-down meal on campus. Since I work on campus, I am totally a regular here. They just launched their new menu three weeks ago. I'm not ashamed to say that I've been to LDL twice since then.   The first time was right after the new menu launched. I ordered some pasta which, unfortunately tasted pretty bad / seemed like it had been under a heat lamp for a while. This isn't typical for LDL, usually their stuff is pretty great.  Today I had the chicken fingers, and holy cow, they are the best I've had anywhere, ever.  Can we talk about this for a second?  I mean, it's easy to make average chicken fingers. But these aren't average. They are tasty, Panko bread crumb laden pieces of juicy tenderness. Be still my heart!  And the (hot!) honey mustard sauce that goes with it... oh mama, I'm salivating.  Whenever I'm bringing people on campus this is where I take them. LDL is a sure thing."}
{"text":"Solid pub food., nothing special' quieter than the pub downstairs \"Den\"?  Had the wrap and gyoza. Gyoza was small meat sausages wrapped and very large. See photos"}
{"text":"I like the LDL. It's a go-to place for graduate student clubs as events get MAJOR discounts. It's a great place to hang. There are large windows, and tables that easily push together for larger parties.  When I go I typically eat the quesadilla or the pizza. Both are good and veggie friendly. The menu has expanded a lot in the last few years and I highly recommend checking it out again if you'd given up on it in the past..."}
{"text":"It's a good restaurant for students. Just a bit loud"}
{"text":"I just ate here and ordered the cauliflower bites as well as a sandwich with a side of garlic mashed potatoes. It was almost completely uneatable! The potatoes tasted like they were made from a box and left in the fridge for a week. Completely void of seasoning (certainly no garlic) and tasting of papier mach√© mush, they were absolutely terrible. The cauliflower bites were almost as bad with an awful honey garlic sauce and too much deep-frying. You would barely know it was once a vegetable. The sandwich itself was very greasy. It was literally dripping grease. I am shocked at how badly this place has gone downhill. Please do not waste your time and money there!!"}
{"text":"Ok seriously, you overhauled your decor, PLEASE do the same with your staff. While I've always enjoyed good food at the LDL, the service is terrible, and they are ALWAYS short-staffed. I don't know if this is just university students flaking off their scheduled shifts or working their first service jobs, but it is honestly embarrassing to take business reps there - however, on campus we really don't have any other options. (The Den is just as bad.)    And now this enforcement of UCID having to be presented to eat there, I'm sorry, who do you think IS already eating there?! What person in their right mind would drive all the way down to the U of C, pay EXORBITANT parking fees, just to sit in the LDL and be ignored by their server? Maybe for your evenings and weekends, but I'm there for a business lunch, not to dance on tabletops and destroy bathroom stalls.   Now if you'll excuse me, I have to drink a gallon of water to wash down the beverage-free meal I was just treated to."}
