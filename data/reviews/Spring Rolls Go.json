{"text":"I LOVE their Red Thai Curry Chicken. Yum. It's basically a really creamy curry sauce that's not too spicy. The mix of the chicken breast slices with the veggies in this sauce are just perfect. Their Japanese Style Udon is pretty good too. But it's a little on the sweet side especially if you don't like sugar.  That's about all I like from them though. Their Pad Thai SUCKS. If you like Pad Thai, honestly the fast food place Thai Express is MUCH better. I had their dumplings before, they were yummy, but kinda expensive. It was like $5-6 for just 3 dumplings."}
{"text":"Just ate at spring rolls. What a disaster. The spring rolls were cold and soggy. The shu mai was freezing and too mushy. Hot and sour soup was ok. Pork buns were cold hard and dry. What a bust."}
{"text":"Give the Ramen a try.  This is a new dish on the Spring Rolls Go menu.  And they've added sushi into their repertoire as well.  I guess this is truly Asian Fusion now.  I approve of both choices and enjoy a place to buy ramen, locally.  Yum!"}
{"text":"We met our longtime friend from highschool here mainly because it was easy to get to, we wanted something different than usual and we saw it from our hotel window. We were there mid-afternoon and the place was deserted, which was great for us because it allowed us to sit and talk, unrushed and without having to shout. The food was good, but not mindblowing. The experience was amazing, but that was because of the company we had."}
{"text":"Maybe I am the only person in Toronto who like Spring Rolls...  and you know what? That's ok with me.  Do they have the best Thai food?  No, but of all the major chains (Thai2Go or Green Mango) I think they have the tastiest menu and nicest restaurants. This is the kind of place I would bring my parents if I wanted them to \"explore\" Thai food without being too authentic (lol)  I ordered the the Sexy Summer Springrolls as an appetizer. They were good but the house springrolls are better and half the price. I also ordered the Shanghai Beef Noodles which are always good.   The restaurant was empty (we were the only patrons) and the service was quick. My one major beef with this place is the TVs. Every booth was equipped with a small flat screen TV which I guess might be good during the World Cup but I find TVs in anything but a bar distracting. That being said the decor was nice and clean. They also have a takeout section in the back."}
