{"text":"The food is good. The service is acceptable. They are dishonest. They sell Groupon's and then refuse to honor them at certain times of day even though nothing is said about that on the Groupon."}
{"text":"I've eaten at numerous Indian restaurants around the valley. From the best claimed by my Indian friends to the TV famous curry corner. This one is the best in my opinion. Their garlic nan is on point, cooked to perfection. Their curry dishes are bursting with flavor. Their vegetable pakora is amazing! The dishes are a little pricey, but honestly most Indian food just is. I usually can't finish an entire curry dish, but I wouldn't say one dish is big enough for two either. My wife and I usually order a different dish and share so we can try new dishes alongside our comfort dishes. Atmosphere is great too, haven't had any of the issues claimed in some of these other reviews. Never had a problem with the wait or with music volumes. Some people are just too hard to please I guess. Food is incredible, just do it!"}
{"text":"This is hands down the best Indian food in the Valley. I've had most of the menu and everything has been delicious. My favorite items are he aloo tikki appetizer, the aloo naan with raita, the chicken makhani, and the salad with chicken. The kheer is also amazing. They're also very accommodating to different levels of spice.   This place is definitely worth a try. The lunch specials change daily and include a curry, rice and naan. They're a great deal. Love this place!"}
{"text":"The food was good, don't get me wrong. But the after affect is what turn me down. Tandoori Times 2 used oils with trans-fat to cook their foods. I would like to support the local business, but trans-fat should be banned in Arizona."}
{"text":"I need to clarify why I'm providing a mediocre rating.  As a family, we've been ordering from this restaurant for years (and periodically dining in as well.)  The food has been consistently good and l really like the variety on the menu.  Besides the traditional Tandoori options, curries, meat and vegetable options, they've got some wraps which I really enjoyed.  However, the service level (for our last couple of visits) has been very poor.    It's as if the customer is inconveniencing the establishment if you're dining in.  So, in a nutshell,  I would rate the food as being quite good.  The naan is sometimes over charred but I'd still recommend the various dishes.  However, the service level detracts from the dining experience.  In addition, although I'm all for creating an ambiance, I'm not sure the belly dancing adds to the whole dining experience especially since it's a Middle Eastern art form.  My recommendation:  Place a carry out order (because the food is good) but avoid dining in because the service level is very inconsistent (including some of the supervisors that assist the cashiers/service staff)."}
{"text":"We went there after a long time and boy was I shocked. We ordered methi chicken and mutton special of the day, the food came out within 5 min but the gravy was cold!!! Although the naan was good and hot but it just don't make up for the cold gravy items . I dint expect this"}
{"text":"When we are in the mood for some North Indian style MEAT we head to Tandoori Times.  I've eaten at both Tandoori Times locations and both are delicious. My only complaints are that some of the dishes are a little heavy on the oil but that can be typical for some Indian places - especially those that are more Pakistani in nature and they do not offer much of a vegetarian selection.  We taken family and friends to this restaurant, some of which have never had Indian food, with great success. The food is generic enough for the American palette but still delicious for those of us that huff spices in our spare time.  I've yet to try their Chaat on the weekends but I'm dying to do so!"}
{"text":"agree the tikka masala has gone a little thin in the past few months . will only go here on a lunch hour so i can order the special and get a good value. last trip 4 people had lunch and a 2 had a glass of wine and it was $ 100 since everyone ordered ala carte too steep for the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"The staff are very friendly here, but the chicken tikka masala has gone downhill since I last posted my review.  It got a lot more runny/ watery and lacks the flavor it used to have.  Kind of disappointed bc it was my weekly fav dish."}
{"text":"Disappointed the first time, but with our faith in Mr K's taste, we tried it again and was pleasantly surprised.  First time we went for lunch and had mainly chaats (Indian snacks) $4.99-$5.99, which are only served Sat & Sun 12pm-5pm.  Our obsession with chaats started at the famous Vik's Chaat Corner in Berkeley, when we used to live in the area.  Unfortunately, the chaats here were lacking in flavor, which is a big problem given Indian food, especially chaats, is all about the spices.  For the Phoenix area, we prefer Little India Chaat in Tempe - it lacks decor and service but is made up by cheap prices and tasty food.  Given our obsession with good naan and our faith in Mr K's taste, we decided to give it another shot.  We went for dinner on a Sunday and ordered:  Saag Ghosht (lamb cubes with spinach in a light cream sauce) $12 - highly recommended by Howard Seftel as \"helpfully\" quoted on the side of the menu - we, on the other hand, found the lamb cubes themselves to be dry and bland despite being in a tasty sauce  Fish Goa Curry (fish filets in coconut curry sauce) $14 - Sunday's daily special so came with rice, one naan and salad - this fish was the BOMB: perfectly balanced subtle spices that complimented the tender flaky fish instead of overwhelming it - the naan is as good as Mr K claims  Great modern decor and good service.  We are definitely going back on a Sunday night for the Fish Goa.  Thanks for another good recommendation Mr K!"}
{"text":"Dear Tandoori times,  Here's my experience and I hope you'll shed some light to the areas that needs improvement and make Tandoori a better place than it is.  I went there with 3 friends (girls) and that's when you usually don't pay much attention to what you eat as we were so busy talking.   I started with self-serve unlimited Tea..OMG! the glasses were so DIRTY I just couldn't find one clean cup in there. Almost all of them were stained with Tea...argh..disgusting. I let the waitress know and asked for a disposable cup for my Tea :(  Fortunately to take my mind off, my friends had ordered Veggie sampler that arrived on time - it was a lot in quantity, nicely decorated and to top if off it tasted great. (by far this is the only food on the menu I liked the most.)  When sampler arrived we also ordered Entree. The young waitress seemed good listener, made a note of all that we requested and disappeared.  We ordered naans and 2 types of curries out of which one was Navratan Korma plus two of my friends ordered Mango Lassi.   Guess what?  This order took them so freaggin forever that I had to stop by the waitress and ask, are you really bringing the food?   Finally after some 100 years (or it seemed like it!!) the food arrived and the Navratan Korma.  And and !!! the waitress forgot our order of 2 Lassi'. Can you believe? we thought she'll bring it now and that became never. Anyways, my friends lost hope in the end and we never bothered to remind them ;) nor were we charged so we guessed the waitress had Lassi-Amnesia and let go.  By the way, When Navratan Korma arrived, it shocked all of us so much so that we stopped our conversations and asked is this Navratan Korma, really? really? (Million dollar expression on all of our faces, haha!) because all it had was Potato, Eggplant, Peas, Corn and Paneer may be.   'Navratan means nine jewels and this dish is supposed to contain a mix of 9 fruits, vegetables and fried nuts. In true Mughlai cuisine fashion, cream (or cashew nut paste) is added to form the gravy.' referenced from www.cookingandme.com  Ok! that doesn't mean that you have to have ALL of the 9 jewels (fruits / veggies) in it but at least be FAIR right? and try some Beans, Carrots, Peppers that are abundantly available in Pheonix.  Aren't they?  That's it!! that is when I decided I'll reach out to the management and call out about my concerns.  Summary (PLEASE): 1. CLEAN up those stained Tea cups 2. Remember the Order given 3. Bring the food before the hunger dies 4. Navratan Korma means total of 9 Veggie or Fruits  5. Fix the crazy spraying faucet in the Ladies restroom  Thanks for taking the pain to read my little note Peace be with you."}
{"text":"Food was delicious, fantastically spicy. New  and exotic flavors for us. A little pricey but it is after all delicious!"}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed in the decline of this restaurant. I once loved the food here. But my last experience was so bad that I haven't been back. We came for lunch and the place was nearly empty (that should have alerted me. Normally it was at least half full a few minutes after opening.) We ordered. I'd brought a friend who loved Indian food and hadn't discovered this place. She was very excited about coming and the free Chai. After ordering we walked over to the Chai station and drew  two cups. Ugh. It was watery, milky and bitter. It tasted old and not at all up to their normal standard. I mentioned the poor quality to the server, who was really trying to be helpful. I even went over and got her a cup and she couldn't drink it. She went to the back and come out and said, \"The cook's don't want to make a fresh batch.\"  Whaaa?  So we dumped the chai and waited for our food. I ordered  the Chicken Tandoori with garlic Naan and my friend had the Chicken Tikka Salad and we waited. And waited. And waited. You could hear arguing for the kitchen. Not a good sign. The server avoided us. After 45 minutes I called her over.  She said the food for coming.  I drank a lot of water while waiting so off to the bathroom and on my way I pass a staff member leaning over a counter eating his lunch. They just opened!? They had customers!? When the food finally arrived it is...meh...not the quality I was accustomed to and not the place I'd bring anyone else for sure. This visit was on March 15, 2012. I haven't been back since to a place that was once a regular once a month stop.  Oh yeah. And my friend hasn't been back either.  I honestly think it has a big management problem."}
{"text":"My boyfriend And I love to eat!!! We first dined here about 8 months ago and looved it so much!! Our second time back was this past Friday..why we waited so long to go back is beyond me...we were so satsified and I could eat there every day! Their garlic naan is out of this world! I I ordered 2 more pieces to go  My assumption based on our dining experience is that we will eat there once per week..either dine in or take out! Love it! Our server was great too!!"}
{"text":"I love their goat curry Friday.  Totally rad!!!  The food is delicious, music is great, and entertainment is excellent.  They have a dancer come out and dance with the audience."}
{"text":"service was exceptionally slow, but the food was tasty. we tried a variety of dishes from lamb, goat, chicken. I didn't get a refill on my water until after an hour or so. the belly dancer was entertaining though"}
{"text":"So thankful this place is nearby in the northwest valley. The Indian food is very good. Try this place if you really like authentic Indian food. Good food and nice staff. Prices are slightly high but worth it ."}
{"text":"I had dinner 2 weeks ago with my friend @ this restaurant .  Food is all tasty but price was kind of expensive for us. We ordered  Marsala chicken half size(4 or 5 small chicken) and 2kinds of curry(very small) N 2 kinds of naan bread(was looks really small ) We paid =50 bucks + 20% tips!"}
{"text":"It's clear the owners are trying, but they are definitely stuck in a hard place with pricing. $13.95 for a lunch buffet had better be far and away better than any competition. Instead, the buffet is at best the same quality as nearby Indian buffets. And an extra charge for naan with the buffet?? Get out of here. Expect to spend $18-20 on a single lunch. That makes the cost DOUBLE that of others. It is not bad by any means and do take note that this could be a 3 or maybe even 4 star review at a more competitive price point. The bottom line is, lowering the price would bring more customers, allowing greater volume at lower margins.They may not get rich quick, but they probably wouldn't be headed toward bankruptcy so quickly either. Won't be back."}
{"text":"The food is always delicious but the servers and atmosphere don't measure up. It's a shame because they have so much potential. The beer was not cold. Either the girl let it sit out too long before finally delivering it or their cooler is broke. The chicken Tikka masala will run you $12 but we got less than a whole breast worth of meat. It was all yogurt sauce. Don't like that. Also, turn on your air conditioning people! We had to pack up our dinner and leave because it was so hot in there we couldn't even enjoy our spicy Indian food. Now about the \"service\".... get it together! Get your staff properly trained. There's nothing worse than terrible service. The only reason we go back is because the food is actually good. This place has steadily been disappointing every time we come. I suggest ordering it to go. Skip the warm beer, careless service, and 85 degree temperature setting on the thermostat! I know we will from now on!"}
{"text":"Good food. Spicy, I was sweating like a wh. on quarter night. They just need to stay stocked better though... OUT OF TWO OF 4 ITEMS WE ORDERED INCLUDING RICE PUDDIN"}
{"text":"My wife and I really love Indian cuisine and have been coming here regularly for a few years now, enjoying the tasty food they have to offer. The establishment is clean, casual and comfortable. Unfortunately, as other reviewers have pointed out, the customer service has really slipped over the past several months to the point where we won't likely return. If we do, it will be for take-out only. During the past few visits, the waiters have been inattentive and food has taken quite a while to arrive to the table. Tonight, curiously, half my dinner arrived and it was another 10-15 minutes before the rest of my meal and all of my wife's meal arrived. Yet, we watched as other guests who arrived after us get their meals served ahead of us. Hey, mistakes happen and sometimes the kitchen gets disorganized and behind. I get it. Just give me some communication and, perhaps, apologize for the slow service and we'll be understanding. But the wait staff has fallen short there too on each occasion. Again, if we go back, we'll stick to take-out."}
{"text":"For the price, this is a great great indian place for lunch!  For $8, you can get a great lunch special, 2 naan, rice, salad, & entree.  The curries are very well made and the naan is hot out the oven.  I love it here."}
{"text":"We have come to Tandoori Times2 for years, always loved the lunch specials that were very reasonably priced for the quality, choices available and especially the price. So sad to find out as of a week ago, the daily lunch specials are no more and they have gone to a buffet. I don't much care for buffet as you tend to eat too much to feel like you get your money's worth (13.95 Tues thru Thursday, 16.95 Fri. - Sunday, with dessert and appetizer included on the weekend). The regular menu is still available for individual entrees but with a la carte pricing. The food on the buffet is still the same, great Indian food but don't like the fact it has been sitting out for hours when previously with the lunch specials, it seemed fresher as it was made to order. All in all, we spent $38.00 including tax, which is too much for lunch. Very disappointed in this menu change and will rethink other options when craving Indian food."}
{"text":"Delicious food!! But the service is always really slow, but we know that now so we just show up early so by the time our food comes it's closer to when we actually wanted to eat."}
{"text":"My vote for favorite Indian food goes to Tandori Times 2.  The food is great, the restaurant has a very cool atmosphere, the wait staff is extremely friendly, and they offer great daily specials.  This locations is definitely less crowded during dinner time but I'd eat at Tandori Times 2 any time!  I am sad to say I have to change my original rating for Tandori Times 2.  Not once but twice while dining with friends my debit card was swiped for not only my bill but my friends bill as well.  The first time the problem was taken care of quickly.  The second time I got the run around before they took care of the problem.  I have been hesitant to go back to Tandori Times 2 since this happened and will never go back  without cash."}
{"text":"We have never tried Indian food before, when we went we had a waiter that explained everything to us. The food was great! I forgot alot of the names of the dishes we had..but I do love the garlic naan they serve. Also I have been back for lunch takeout and  order the tandoori chicken wrap. It was delicious! I also love their chai tea."}
{"text":"Went for lunch the other day and sadly it seems it has gone downhill.  The food is still fairly delicious but the service was really lacking.  Waiter did not understand the menu, hence did not quite get our order right.  Very very slow and inattentive service.  Our appetizers were served after our entrees.  It shouldn't take 40 minutes after ordering naan to get it.  Drink refills were lacking and they served us a dish we didn't order.  Also it was very hot and humid in there and they explained after we said something that their air conditioner wasn't running at full capacity. OK, but maybe they should mention that before you shell out $70 for a lunch where sweat is dripping off your forehead into your rice.   All in all an unpleasant experience but will come again later to see if things are any better."}
{"text":"Me and the wife were in the mood for something different... Indian food was something different for us so we Yelped something Indian and this spot popped up!   So we entered and were greeted by the waitress, nice little place. I look around and the atmosphere is nice, theres a few families in there, some people at the bar, your usual nice atmosphere. We really wanted some authentic Indian food, and as far as I can tell, I think we found it. Because we had no experience with Authentic Indian food, I had to give it the \"Authenticity Test\"... here's the test... When you want to find out how authentic and ethnic restaurant is, you look at how ethnic its population is. This restaurant passed the test. It was very nice and refreshing to see the diversity in this place. We proceeded to look very lost and confused about their huge menu so I  asked the waitress for help because we were clueless to the lingo on the menu and she was really cool about it, she explained what everything was, and how you pair it...   We began with the Samosas, a pastry filled with potato and green peas, with garbanzo beans on the side, served with three different chutnies, a green one, a red one, and then some pickled stuff there was ginger in there for sure, the Samosa was really good, but I gotta say the garbanzos were freakin delicious.... it was freakin' good, all of it! Then we ordered the Chicken Tikki Masala, with some rice and Naan... the whole thing was gone...   I guess the best thing I can say is that this place from the sounds of it seems very authentic, the food is good, and the server was cool... the only thing that I felt awkward about was around 7:30 a belly dancer came out and I honestly didn't know what to do... I had my pregnant wife sitting next to me while this girl is doing her thing... didn't really know the etiquette, I reached for a dollar, then realized I was in the wrong place... then everybody else started to take out dollars... so then i got confused... it was a weird dynamic... didn't know where to look, like, if i looked did I look like a pervert, I mean there's families around!!! But at the same time I think I was supposed to! So from the looks of it... you give her a dollar, but then she'll stand you up and make you dance with her... take what you will from this... go there it was a cool experience."}
{"text":"This place confuses me. It seems very popular but I came here to try the food and found it very bland. I had the vindaloo which was hardly spicy and way too salty. Can't say I haven't had better because there are several places down the same street that do it better. The night I was there they also had a belly dancer. Seriously WTF? That's like going to a soul food restaurant and seeing a polka band or going to a Thai restaurant and seeing ninjas dancing with samurai swords. That said, I realize there is a market for ethnic food made safe for the masses (Macayo's, Panda Express, Benihana, etc) but that's not my thing. It's perfect for folks that wanna try the food for the first time without any of the discomfort of being surrounded by people of the same origin as the food they are trying."}
{"text":"This has to be one of the best indian restaurants I've been to internationally. They've nailed a lot of dishes down perfectly to that \"Restaurant Style Indian Food for America\" type of cuisine.  I've been here 3 times now and the food has consistently been good, which is a good sign. And I'm referring to the location near 50th-something street and Bell (there is another one I've heard is NOT as good as this place with the same name). I've tried the tandoor chicken, lamb tikka masala, karahi chicken and chicken makhani. The naan is really good too. The free chai is the icing on the cake.  Their meat is really always juicy and tender, barely EVER dry like it is at so many other indian restaurants. I'm very apprehensive about eating at 95% of indian restaurants anyway...as most re-use other people's food, over/undercook things, or grossly underflavor things.  We've had the same waitress all 3 times...I'll agree, the service from her end could really use some major improvement. BUT, Indian restaurants in general are FAR from perfect, and some leeway is required.  Would definitely eat here again, even if I were disappointed at least once."}
{"text":"So I ate here like three months ago. i might've been 1 out of 3 other customers that cold january afternoon, but when I walked in, i didn't get greeted (probably due to my shy quiet nature) and sat down at one of the tables. It took a minute or two before anyone realized I was there, didn't think too much about it, they were all flummoxed about me just sitting there with my kindle reading. but I came in knowing what it was that i wanted to eat, the Chicken Tikka Masala (by far favorite all-time dish). ow to kinda jump away from the review a little bit. I moved to Phoenix June of last year, into an area that has a high concentration of Indian restaurants, but it took me a little while, going from shop to shop trying to find the best chicken tikka. Tandoori Times 2 hit it on the head, the chicken was tender, the sauce was spicy but not overpowering, slightly citric and sour (but really freaking good), the naan was crispy, but folded really well while scooping up sauce and chicken. but this place has won me over for when I need to get my curry fix :D"}
{"text":"The food is great. Their chicken wrap  is really good. The onion naan is wonderful.Their chicken salad is one of my favorites.  I love the Chai tea. But the wait for the food and the bill was agonizing. In the time it took to get the food and the wait for the bill I could have driven to Flagstaff and back. Not really...but literally it was at least 30 minutes before they finally came over to give us the bill. And it wasn't even busy in there! So if you like their food, which is above average call them for pick up, unless you like not having anything better to do with 2 hours of your life."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying we are regular customers and love their food. If not for those past experiences we would not be able to rate them at all because after waiting 40 minutes for someone to look in our direction or offer us a water we finally left.   The place was pretty busy but we were seated relatively quickly as no one else was waiting. All open tables aside from one needed to be bused and we were asked if the table nearest the door was okay or if we wanted to wait a couple minutes for another table. We took the table, sat down, and the wait began.  A line quickly formed at the door and the wait staff began running around trying to bus the tables that had also being awaiting their attention. After seating this small rush a 6 top stood at the door for about ten minutes waiting for them to push a couple tables together. Their server was however conscientious enough to quickly bring them water, lucky dogs... They began making their way around to the new tables and getting water out. Us having had a good 5 minutes wait on the other tables sat waterless feeling a little like second class citizens. At the 40 minute mark it was obvious that our business was not wanted so we packed up and decided to call it a night.   In the staffs defense the place was crowded and there were only two serves and a manager in the front of house. That being said, the place isn't that big and a little direction, organization, and help from the manager would have made this manageable for the staff on hand. For patrons to wait that long without so much as a blink in their direction is unacceptable.  As we headed for the door I looked at a table that had been there before us. They sat food-less with empty drinks and I realized I had made the right decision. I wouldn't be eating last nights leftovers and writing a Yelp review right now, I would be waiting for food."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant sometime back. I'm an Indian and I would not say they prepare authentic Indian dish, but the food in general was good. I had vegetable briyani, but it was like peas, vegetable & mild spice...more like vegetable mixed rice rather than Briyani...my hubby ordered Lamb Briyani...n it was also kinda customized as an American version. But ambiance of the restaurant was good and it has a bar. Nice environment then most of the Indian restaurant I visited.  There was this restaurant guy who started to smoke so nearby to us when we where having our dinner..I felt that behavior to be rude."}
{"text":"Not much I can say other than this place is good and tandoori village is awful. I had the Lamb curry, and my wife had the Chicken Tikka Masala. It was all wonderful, I wouldn't order the Paneer Pakora again but that's ok. It'll save us some money. Like I said, really really good."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  The flavors are deep and rich. We have been coming here for a few years and it consistently hits the mark. Tony is a great server and and adds just the right amount of guidance to make it a great experience.  It is a great place!!"}
{"text":"Very nice place. Beautiful interior.  Great food and beer! Love this place. Highly recommend going when they have the belly dancers! Bring $ to tip a buck or two!"}
{"text":"I always stuff myself at TT2 , the food is that wonderful.  I live close by and have been eating here once a month for a few years now.  It never fails me.  Even their desserts are well crafted, and the free Chai is a delight.  A solid, classic neighborhood curry house that brings a smile to my tummy whenever I visit, and I visit often.  You should as well!"}
{"text":"I have tried many different Indian restaurants and I keep coming back to Tandoori Times.  Their naan is the best!  The Chicken Biryani is a delight while the Chicken Tikka Masala is to die for!  You can't go wrong with the homemade desserts.  The servers are nice and this is a kid-friendly place.  My only comment would be the length of time it takes from beginning to end can be long but they allow you ample time to digest your meal.  They have a belly dancer on Friday and Saturday nights.  Try it and you won't be disappointed.   Closed on Mondays and daily from 2:30 - 5:30."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful and entertaining time here with great food..thanks to A PHO GRILL ..great show by d lady that danced BhangRA. .I even got an award for Belly Dancing...Will surely be back...."}
{"text":"Tasty lamb dishes and the garlic naan is addicting. Will be back!"}
{"text":"I am a regular at this spot. Past two visits the food quality was poor. Yesterday their relish was stale. The quality and service has dropped significantly in past 6 months or so."}
{"text":"Sunny, I would say if you price your items right, you might get more plus returning customers."}
{"text":"I have been here several times and everything I have tried is incredible.   I enjoyed the chicken vindaloo lunch special today and it was amazing.  I even licked my spoon clean!  Seriously good food!"}
{"text":"Love this place! If it's your first time It's fun to order a few different things then share as a group. Potato Naan is my favorite, but the garlic is yummy too. Any of the vindaloos are great. if you like spicy you'll love it!  Sometimes the service is slow. So order to go if your in a huge hurry. Otherwise sit back and enjoy a meal. it's a very calm place to eat. Not a lot of noisy music. Good for your digestion!"}
{"text":"Tandoori Times 2 had me hooked when I first opened the restaurant door! The smell of Indian food is fragrant and warm. Staff is friendly and fast. We ordered the Lamb Tikki Marsala for the second time because it really is that good! Also the naan is fantastic too! This is Glendale's best kept secret."}
{"text":"I tried this place after I bought a Groupon for it. I was pleasantly surprised. The lamb tikka masala was awesome! The best I've had in a while. The service was good. It was very clean & i liked how you can see the chefs cooking in the kitchen.  I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I go here almost every Friday whether for dine in or take out. They are my favorite Indian food in all of phoenix. They know me by name and are always very kind. I really love to order spicy and they always accommodate and it tastes perfect every time! Truly love this place and their staff."}
{"text":"So far, this is my favorite Indian restaurant in town. The food is delicious! My go-to order is the Paneer Tikka Masala with the Chili Paneer Naan - something I have never had anywhere else. The wait times can become excessive, however. My last order was placed through Eat24, Yelp's online ordering partner, and I waited in the restaurant over an hour past my expected pick-up time (which was already extended past an hour due to a busy night). If this was improved it would easily be a five-star review."}
{"text":"The food here is beyond bad. I've tried several things on the menu and found all of them to be ridiculously terrible. I'm really confused where these positive reviews come from. I would have to assume its people who've never had English/Indian food before (which is definitely possible in Glendale Arizona) but this place should be ashamed.  It's certainly not saved by at service either, no specifics but let's just say their ability to handle a disgruntled customer leaves something to be desired.  Just don't go here."}
{"text":"Great food, but the service is extremely, extremely (yes,  double word is deserved) slow.  I ordered a drink, and the service was so slow at the drink actually showed up after the check. The drink was ordered with dinner!"}
{"text":"This place was the goto spot, not its just on a downward spiral. Food cartons half filled, vindaloo was very oily, and the rice watery. Half hour wait longer than what was quoted, and it's the third time prices were raised, 3 dollars for naan is a no deal. Get your stuff together."}
{"text":"If you know Indian food then you can tell upon entering that this is the real deal.. These people know how to cook and are proud of it... I saw somebody using what looked to be the size of a boat oar in a pot almost big enough to get in and it smelled like heaven.... I sometimes just order the naan bread on my way home to accompany a salad.... it is like 3 bucks and the best in town...  you can close your eyes and pick anything off the menu and you will not be disappointed.."}
{"text":"I was greatly impressed. My mom and I went here a little after they opened for dinner and it was absolutely wonderful. We both are \"kind of\" experienced with Indian food...but not really. So it was really great to have a server who was intelligent, patient, and genuinely nice.   The restaurant was very open, colorful, and comfortable. The food was delicious. My mom had plenty of meat-eating options and I had plenty of vegetarian options. Hint: skip the salads and appetizers to have room for dessert. The rice pudding is cool and refreshing and not like any other rice pudding I've ever had. Expect to pay about 10 bucks for whatever main dish you order and everything else is awesomely inexpensive...like 2 bucks or so for sides and desserts.  I absolutely loved this place. It is good food for the die-hards and good service for the new, shy foodies who are just getting into Indian cuisine."}
{"text":"They have great tasting Indian dishes. All We ordered pakoras, alu tikki chat, kadai paneer and naan. Garlic chili naan was very nice. I reached just 10 minutes before the kitchen closing but we were able to order whatever we wanted. Everything tasted fresh and looks like they make it to order.  Will surely return to try the rest of dishes on the menu!  P:s they don't have a buffet but they do have lunch combos."}
{"text":"We are regulars here.  Any place that my 6-year-old daughter will go to that doesn't have an indoor playground must be good. Love the Chicken Tika Masala.  Spiced to order.  Last few times we went, they did not have the 'Flying Horse Royal Lager', which is a bummer.  Would give 5 stars if they didn't 'nickle-and-dime' you over the rice and naan - should be included with an entre!"}
{"text":"One of the Best place in Glendale for Indian food. Make sure you have enough time to go there as it will always crowded."}
{"text":"Great food, tastes fresh and they have something for everyone. The menu has vegetarian, seafood, and meat options. The naan was fantastic and the ambiance is modern, open, and yet cozy as well. 10/10 would eat again."}
{"text":"Increase of prices ( this being my favorite Indian joint in phoenix based on taste ) not appreciated !"}
{"text":"So here's how our Friday night went down at Tandoori Times 2:  Arrive and walk in the door. Sign says \"Please wait to be seated.\" So we wait, and wait, and wait. A few waitresses made eye contact with us, but no on really bothered coming over to welcome us. There were a couple open tables and I could have sat myself, but you know, in a new place you want to play by the rules as much as possible - so we kept waiting. After about 5 minutes a young lady came over and asked if we'd like to sit in the open table less than 5 feet away. \"Yes please.\" I responded.   After sitting at an empty table for about 7 more minutes, we still had yet to be given our menus, silverware, or even a cup of water. At this point I wanted to leave, because frankly I wasn't having the best time.   Fortunately our waters and menus arrived, after being in their doors for about 15 minutes.   Guess what happened next? If you guessed more waiting, you're right. We say at our table with empty bellies and waters in hand, for about 10 more minutes before our waitress returned. She asked if we were ready to order - I wasn't sure if she meant drinks or food. Fortunately my girlfriend was quick enough to position that we were ready with our whole order.  We ordered a couple soft drinks and all of our food, at this point I think our waitress recognized that we were a bit annoyed by our wait, and promptly returned with our soft drinks. Props to her for some mediocre situational awareness skills.   Our food came out maybe 10 minutes after we ordered it. Things are looking up! Or so I thought...  About 5 minutes into eating, really loud hookah bar music started pumping through the speaker, then she appeared. The belly dancer. Now I've never seen a real live authentic belly dancer before, so I had pretty unestablished expectations...I was a clean slate. To be as un rude as possible about her appearance - It wasn't the most appetizing thing to watch while eating, frankly I wanted to tip her so that she wasn't dancing in the faces of my date and I but I think tipping would be giving her false signals, such as I enjoyed her presence.   I feel like tipping a dancer, strip club style and having her stuff it in her garments somehow, is not what should be happening while eating dinner. Unless I'm having the steak special at HiLiter.  After not finishing all the food, because I had lost my appetite, we got the check, paid and left.   Now I know what Tandoori Times is like.   I really think they could benefit from nixing the belly dancer from the payroll and investing in a hostess instead.   I'm giving it two stars, as my girlfriend was amused by my attitude about the place throughout the evening, and the food wasn't even bad! It just came with a really bad experience. Well, at least she had a good time."}
{"text":"I frequent this location more times than I care to admit. The food is always amazing and on key. So far this is the best place I have been for a really good Chicken Tikka Masala. When I first got here I would have rated the location a 5 however the portion size I noticed for the To-Go orders (only way I order) has decreased however the price has not. I am truly hoping this was due to shortage in To-Go containers but if not I will definitely have to find a new place. Also the inside staff are not the friendliest when I go in for take out. I'm generally met with subpar looks and never a hello. Food is great but seems like the value is dissolving."}
{"text":"Tasty food, decent prices and quick service. I especially like the Chilli naan and Malai Kofta here."}
{"text":"The food is so good! Geez the service ruins it for me everytime. Slow. Slow. Slow. shouldnt ever have to ask for a refill on water when thats all your drinking?! At the end of my meal, before asking for the check I asked for more of the yogurt stuff that comes with the biryani. Took forever to get the check and when he brought it I had asked again for the sauce. Upon bringing it back, he mentioned he didnt put the side on the bill... not my fault. But he said it like he was doing me a favor hahah this is not the only time ive had slow service. It just seems like they dont care at all."}
{"text":"Work in the area, so I've stopped by with coworkers countless times.  The service has been bad 9 out of 10 times.  But the food is some of the best Indian food in town, lunch specials are really good and the happy hour is great, so until now I just put up with it...  ...Until today, when I tried to call in an order and they hung up on me.  Three times.  Literally just clicked the button to end the call without even picking up, and left me in a confused silence - I had full bars.  I hope it was just a phone problem, but honestly, it didn't seem that way.   Also, splitting a check here is an absolute nightmare.  They write all the checks by hand and refuse to get some form of electronic system.  I understand that splitting a check 10 ways is crazy, but there's only typically 3-4 of us.  Depending on who waits on you, they will throw a fit when you ask to split the bill.  The saving grace though, is there's one waiter who's always really good and will do it for us no problem.  Everytime we go, we pray that we get placed in his section...haha.  Honestly I can't say I won't come back, because there isn't much else in the area and the food itself is really good.   But don't expect any form of hospitality, and don't bother during full-price hours.  The dinner prices aren't work this.  I'm not a fancy restaurant type of person, I don't require top-notch service.  But I'd at least like to not wait 40 minutes for food during my lunch hour, then another 40 for the waitress to bring the bill, and have her get angry at us for trying to pay the damn bill."}
{"text":"Same base was used for all the foods, thus all the dishes tasted very similar..  Proper ingredients were limited in the dishes served thus lacking the layers needed.  Spices (not heat but actual spices) were mild and lacked as well.  The food seems more geared towards to Caucasian patronage rather than how the food should  be prepared.     The pro was that the paneer was fresh and properly made as well as basmati."}
{"text":"Love this place ! Nice happy hour, great for a group. Excellent food and service!  Belly dancing on some evenings. It's one of our favorite places to go in the West Side."}
{"text":"When I talked to the owner of Tandoori Times at his Scottsdale restaurant some months ago, he mentioned that he was opening a second location on Bell Road in Glendale.  \"But don't you think there's a lot of competition already from the all the other Indian restaurants in the area?\" I asked.  \"Competition? There is no competition.\"  Now, his response could be taken as being cocky, but given how this guy has turned his original restaurant into a success (complete with random sword-wielding belly dancer on Friday and Saturday nights) , I didn't really doubt him. And so when I got word the Tandoori Times \"2\" finally opened in Glendale, I was all over it and went there for lunch today.  Bringing some colleagues along with me, we headed out on Bell and found Tandoori Times in a shopping center parking lot with a temporary sign covering one for a now-vacated Kokopelli Grill. Walking inside, it was definitely smaller than the Scottsdale location but still bright and clean and done up well. Not really any booths inside, but tables could easily be rearranged for large groups.   Having only been to Tandoori Times (#1) for dinner, I was curious about what they did for lunch. We got our regular menus as well as one for lunch specials, which come with a naan, rice, salad, and daal (lentils). The lunch specials of the day were lamb vindaloo, chicken jalfrezi (boneless chicken in spicy curry) and navratan korma (a vegetable dish). I opted for the jalfrezi, one colleague got the korma and the other opted for veggie biryani (a rice dish). The service was prompt, courteous and efficient, and we got our food pretty quickly. I know the owner is a big stickler for good service so it was great to see nothing slid in the new location.  As for my lunch, I wasn't much of a fan of the salad, which was basically iceberg lettuce with ranch, and the daal was a little on the bland side, but the naan with the chicken was excellent. Really good flavor to the jalfrezi (not quite as excellent as my mom's, for sure, but still really good). And I'll admit that I'm a naan purist who can easily tell when a naan is done in a tandoor (a clay oven) and when it isn't - which is why Tandoori Times and Tandoori Village are leagues ahead of all the other Indian restaurants in the valley in that department. I took a taste of the korma and it was pretty tasty, but my other collague said his veggie biryani was a little too mild for him, which is surprising since the chicken biryani I've had at the Scottsdale locale has always been pungent with flavor.   In any case, as far as lunch goes, I enjoyed mine and am now amped that another option has opened up on this side the Valley. Sure, it could have been more pefect by overtaking the TGI Friday's near where I work, but you can't have everything now, can you.   4 stars (I'll save star #5 for dinner sometime)."}
{"text":"This is the best Indian food we've had since we lived in Germany! That is saying something! The korma was absolutely delicious, and onion and garlic naan was delish (just a bit charred), the service is excellent, the atmosphere is great, the pricing is spot on, and the portions are huge and easily enough for family-style! No charge for sharing even! This is our new favorite restaurant!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad I discovered this little gem. Completely authentic Indian food. I've had the chana masala and the...cottage cheese cubes with peas (forgot what it's called). Neither disappointed. Also, I shared both with my 6'5\" boyfriend and we still had leftovers (rice and naan as well). If you don't like spicy food, make sure you request a mild flavor (for any of the dishes). They also have complimentary self-serve chai tea which is so delicious I find myself often daydreaming of it. Mmmm...freeeeee.....  On Saturday evenings, they have a live belly dancer and Indian house-sounding music, which creates an awesome atmosphere. It's not too much to where you can't enjoy your food and time, but there's opportunity to get involved and dance with the dancer if you so desire."}
{"text":"Wait time for take out was an additional 30 min upon arrival. Chicken in the briyani was over cooked and crumbly. Aloo ghobi was sour (spoiled?). Won't be returning. This used to be my go-to place. Too bad about this experience. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"I wouldn't visit this place. I am from south India and was disappointed with the chicken biriyani served at this place.It was just chicken pieces added to vegetable rice."}
{"text":"So I have to admit it's my first time eating Indian food but for my first experience it was fantastic have that tandoori chicken which was probably the best chicken I've ever had moist full flavor little spice also had the lamb kebab which was okay probably when they get that again but on the other hand the lamb wrap was phenomenal probably just the sauce that was in it then Brad was pretty good too I also definitely highly recommend the mango drink thick but flavorful only thing the service is a little slow took by 30 minutes after we ordered to get her food but way worth the wait I will be back there very soon"}
{"text":"At first I wasn't sure why this wasn't in the \"recommended list\" from my friends who are experts when it comes to Indian food, but after trying it out, I now know why.  Tandoori's dishes have a lot of \"fillers\" so the meats we got in our order were very minimal compare to the other Indian restaurants.  The flavor is more Americanized than I thought so it didn't hit the \"authentic mark\" in my opinion.  Service is horrible, but I didn't have much expectation on this field so it's pretty much the food that I have issues with.  It's fun to try this restaurant once if you are running out of option, but I personally wouldn't go back again."}
{"text":"The food was average, I've had better Naan and fish masala somewhere else. One of my friend got his order wrongly token, so he waited sadly 10 more minutes for his correct order. The Belly Dancer was cool."}
{"text":"Very good local Indian food. I ordered the buttered chicken w/rice and garlic naan and everything was really good. I ordered take out and my food was ready in 15 minutes and tasted super fresh, I even had leftovers for the next day! I will definitely be returning to dine in and try some of their other authentic Indian dishes."}
{"text":"I have the same comment as Pete...Where's the beef? or Lamb? we ordered 4 dishes of different curries of whick lamb vindaloo is my usual fav. the last few times there was a few potatoes and just a couple shreads of lamb. the sauce was good tasting but no meat. i take my family and friends to eat there but will think twice now because of the change in food portion."}
{"text":"First of all, delicious food! Love the chicken dishes (yum vindaloo) and the seasoned rice is very tasty!  But second of all, I am positively impressed that this restaurant in Glendale delivers to North Phoenix (in the \"Streets\"). I live just under 10 miles away and they deliver to me!! Yes, the wait for delivery can be long, but they are a very busy restaurant at dinner time and they use third-party delivery drivers. However, I tried delivery last night from my home address (I have had delivery from them before from a closer location) and even though it took exactly 2hrs and 15 mins from when I placed my order, it arrived piping hot and was DELICIOUS! It was worth the wait. I hope they continue to offer delivery at such a distance and that people will grant them the patience (and the drivers too) to get to you!"}
{"text":"Love the modern spin on the indian food.  High quality food and always good service.  Really good naan and dishes that will satisfy everyone.  Lunch is the best value because dinner is ala carte style so dishes don't come with naan, rice, etc.  This is actually our favorite indian food spot in Phoenix.  Go here!"}
{"text":"Wandered in here for lunch with my wife. I had the lamb vindaloo and she had the vegetable korma. It was the best vindaloo I've had in years and teh service was pretty damn good too."}
{"text":"Well, it took us 4 trips until we finally found this place open (they're closed on Mondays, and between 2-5pm), but fourth time's the charm, I guess!   I had to dock a star for their lack of samosas and the usual sweet brown sauce I've had at every Indian restaurant I've been to.  I ordered the Aloo Tikki (chickpeas, onions, and potato patties), asking them to leave off the tamarind chutney and replace it with raita(yogurt with mint and cucumber)...it was very flavorful and moist, though a bit spicy(my fault for failing to ask for mild).  I also had the Vegetable Korma--incredible!!!...It was a thick stew of squash, potatoes, peas, corn, and carrots, and it almost tasted pumpkin-y...so savory! The best part was the corn kernels--they were slightly crunchy and added an amazing dimension of texture.  Jamie's meal was the Lamb Masala. We'd been meaning to try lamb again, as the first time we had it(elsewhere), it was chewy and just, not very appetizing. Well--our minds were changed!...this lamb was tender and succulent, and the Masala sauce? incredible!--full of complex flavors and spices...it was amazing!  We also got 2 breads--the Onion Naan (so soft, almost moist in a good way, and FULL of onions), and the Chicken Naan(full of tandoori-cooked chicken, and infused with a smoky, almost barbecue, flavor---wow)...  so. some of the most well-spiced, tastiest Indian food I've had, as well as very friendly and helpful service= 4 stars :)"}
{"text":"We were out this way and had a gift card for Carrabba's so I wanted to use it up (I normally try to avoid chains). I didn't think how packed it would be for Valentine's. We had parked in front of Tandoori, so we figure as long as there was alcohol and it was still happy hour... Upon entering I was gifted with a long stem red rose. (But since we believe in gender equality, I shared it with my guy.)  All of the cocktails were along the sweet vein, but I guess that probably goes better with Indian food.  My bf got Beef Masala and I tried the Bengun Bhartha (when we go out, I enjoy meatless). It was a long wait for the food, but so worth it!  I've never had anything like my eggplant smash, but it was amazing with the plain naan. The spices on the masala were spot on.  Then... there was a belly dancer! With my little exposure, dancers and food just are awkward.  This lady was so great; she was obviously having fun interacting with ppl.  They need to open in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Um...WOW!  We left there licking the sauce off the spoon!!  My husband and I just moved to Phoenix and have been looking for a good place to eat Indian food and we finally found it!  We went in pretty hungry and ordered the spicy tandoori wings, lamb korma, chicken tandoori, chicken curry, garlic naan, and rice.  Oh, and 2 beers :).  Could't find one thing wrong with the food.  The sauce for the lamb korma and chicken curry was thick and ooooh so tasty.  Best I've had to date.  The atmosphere is nice and colorful without going overboard.  Bathrooms are clean and, to my delight, they have a 'Hinglish' poster to read while doing your business - quite amusing.    The service was exceptional.  Our server, Melissa, was a delight.  Good conversation  without going overboard.  She was efficient and quite pleasant.  Even the busser was great!  My water was filled as soon as he noticed my water cup was getting low.  Definitely going back for more."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out with a couple of friends and we were all pleasantly surprised. The waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu and let us know if things were spicy or if they might be out of something. Since our waiter told us that all of the curries are generally mild, I asked to have them make my lamb tikki masala a little more spicy ( like 5 or 6 on a ten point scale) and it came out perfect. To go along with the curry, we got rice and garlic naan (which is like a flatbread - super good). Be warned though, the rice and naan a plate is 2.75 each. Refills on the water were constant which is good because I drink a lot. Oh! and they have free chai tea there which was delicious, if I had known earlier, I would have drank that the whole time during my meal. To top the good experience off, we got the assorted desserts which was graciously given to us for free from our waiter whom I'd like to mention was easy on the eyes. Overall, it was a really great experience and I would come back again."}
{"text":"I am a fan of Indian food and thought the food at Tandoori was alright but not good enough to forget that my chicken tikka masala to go was about $19 including a piece of bread. Usually I have done buffets at Indian restaurants and this was my first time ordering something to go, but I was surprised to find out that it did not come with rice. Having to order and pay for rice separately is like going to an Italian restaurant and finding out that pasta is not included with your alfredo. If the amount of food I got was large enough then no big deal, but it was not enough to justify the price in my opinion. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"So so so good! We had garlic naan, chicken tikka masala, raita, rice and tandoori chicken. Everything was seriously wonderful. Great service and nice ambience. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Great Indian food in Phoenix - awesome service - nice ambience and good for a dinner with friends"}
{"text":"Never have I experienced Indian food before, for the first time today my daughter and I decided to experience it together for her birthday. I do have to say the overall experience was great we were greeted immediately with great customer service, they were readily available to explain all the meals being that this was our first time.My daughter had beef masala, and I had chicken masala, with a salad and rice and of course the garlic naan, the naan was amazing! I personally was not a fan of the chicken masala, however my daughter and I loved the beef masala. It is a bit on the pricey side a little bit more than I wanted to pay for lunch $63.00 including tip. I did not like the fact that everything was al la carte off their dinner menu, they do have a lunch menu however nothing look appealing otherwise the dinner menu has better options. Hence the three stars just for pricing."}
{"text":"Most authentic Indian food outside of India!  I know, because I've been!   Don't let the idea of  exotic food scare you away...there's something for everyone here, even vegetarians and children!  Try the paneer (pressed cheese) dishes or samosas choley if you don't like meat.  Try the chicken or paneer Makhani if you don't like the heat!  For medium-spicy dishes, the Chicken Tikka Masala is excellent with a side of rice and naan bread!  If you want a bite of something that'll bite you back with a really great flavor, try the Tandoor Fish wrap!  The key to eating reasonably is to go as a group of 2 or more, get rice and naan and a couple different items to share with the entire table.  You don't have to drink alcohol, but there's a full service bar at all 3 of the Tandoori Times locations and the beer selection is above-average!  This is the 2nd of the 3 locations and features a nice inside area with a squishy, but comfortable patio where you can enjoy hookah while you eat.  Bellydancers join the fun on Friday and Saturday nights.  Decent value if you crave very good quality food, an exotic atmosphere and an authentic Indian experience.  Ok, the bellydancing isn't exactly authentic, but it's definitely exciting!  One of my favorite weekend hangouts...solid 5 out of 5!"}
{"text":"Stopped by during a business trip to Arizona, our waiter was in the bathroom same time as me and he didn't wash his hands (had already eaten my meal by that time). Following that horrific experience our food was mediocre at best. Bottom line I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"This place has the best tandoori chicken that I have ever tasted. It is so flavorful... They also have tandoori spicy chicken wings that I recommend. I have never had problems with their service like some of the other reviewers. Some might think it is a bit pricey but my motto is that you can't put a price on good food.  I love their garlic naan. Their chicken saag is also very good. Everything I have ordered here  has either met or exceeded my expectation. The menu is ala cart so if you want rice then you need to order it on the side but they give you a lot."}
{"text":"Craving Indian in West Valley. Sadly, I missed our International Supper Club UYE hosted by Monica O. this month at Taj Mahal. I was REALLY craving Indian food last night after an evening of Homecoming pictures with my high school junior and friends. Hubby calls, and I declare it was DATE NIGHT! We ruled out American cuisine because we discerned years ago that on Friday and Saturday nights, most decent American restaurants were packed.  While the crowds pack into those restaurants, we go ethnic. I suggested Tandoori Times because it was closest to my location. Off to Bell Road we both trekked.  On my way into the restaurant, a woman decked in Indian finery discreetly informed me that my dress was hiked up. I quickly adjusted myself. Seeing all the equipment she was bringing in, I held the door for her. \"Are you playing an instrument for us tonight?\"  \"No, I will be dancing.\" I saw the sign on the door, \"Belly dancing. Friday and Saturday night.\"   I entered the restaurant and was warmly greeted by wait staff. 2 thirds of the tables were full. I was shown to a table of two. I perused the menu and scanned quickly what others in the room were ordering. I noticed there were a large number of Indian families dining at the restaurant.   Tip: Complimentary hot Indian spiced Chai with milk in a dispenser is available in the corner. It is unsweetened, so add your own sugar or artificial sweetener.  We loved our appetizer! Mixed Vegetable Pakora ($7.95) served with tamarind chutney. Crunchy spinach, potato and onion morsels in a delicately spiced with a sweet sauce sauce. We loved eating it mixed with the other condiments: mint chutney, garlic chili sauce and pickled ginger and sliced green chili. We will definitely order it again when we return.  For mains, we chose our time-tested Chicken Makhrani ($13.95). Tandoor baked chicken pieces simmered in a creamy, tomato based sauce. This signature dish is what brings us back to Tandoor Times.   We paired this curry with the Bengun Bhatar ($11.95), a vegetarian eggplant curry cooked with tomatoes. The eggplant had a beautiful smoky flavor and the subtle treatment of seasoning was a nice balance to the more robust Makhrani. I loved the pairing, but my husband was not sold. I think he isn't a fan of the big chunks of tomatoes. So the search continues for the perfect match to our Chicken Makhrani. We lapped the food up with Basmati rice ($3) sprinkled with peas and an order of naan ($2.50).   When our lovely server asked us if we had room for dessert, my response, \"Maybe I should order the Gulab Jamun for appetizers the next time.\" She met my response with a giggle.   Ah, I nearly forgot, back to the lovely artist I met entering the restaurant. While we were enjoying the main course, a member of the staff called the guests to attention and introduced our lovely entertainer. Indian music blared as she enraptured the room with her virtuoso dancing. The best part was watching the wait staff smile and grin broadly as she interacted and teased customers. My reserved husband was thankful she gave us a miss for a solo performance. We kept our gaze on our food. I stole glances as I shared the glee of watching others squirm with embarrassment. It was all in good fun. The staff invoked clapping and cheering throughout the evening. It was hard maintaining a conversation but it was all in good spirit. So, if you want a quiet intimate evening, maybe Tandoori Times is not for you on Friday and Saturday nights."}
{"text":"I had the lamb vindaloo and it was very delicious and as indicated SPICY. The waitress was very nice and brought me yogurt to help put out the fire in my mouth!!! :)  He had Beef Masala, which was marvelous. The garlic naan was fantastic. The rice was decent.  We will be going back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"The best Indian cuisine I have tasted so far. The wraps are very tasty. The Garlic Naan, spicy chicken wings, coconut chicken, chicken tikka masala and chicken makhni are truely a die for entrees. I would truly recommend this restaurant to all my friends and colleagues."}
{"text":"Great food and A+ service. I am definitely coming back again. We ordered the tandoori shrimp, naan garlic bread and chicken kormi"}
{"text":"If the service were as good as the food, they would have gotten four stars.    First, the chef cannot make ANYTHING spicy.  I don't know if he doesn't know how or he just doesn't care to, but he just cannot make a \"chefs hot\" dish to match a real Indian chef. He sends out chili powder to the table if you want a dish hotter.  Really lazy and doesn't care is how it seems to me.   We have tried three different times to get a spicy dish. A baby could eat this food. NO heat at all.  The servers are extremely slow.  They have no sense of urgency.  They mostly stand with their elbows on the counter staring out at the dining room. Also, check your check total. They almost always get it wrong -- in their favor by a few bucks. If you come in off peak, they are NOT happy to see you. They will let you know that you have a limited time to eat and they are closing the doors. That is a terrible business practice.   For the taste of the food, you think this place would be packed. The Groupon will pull you in but the service will send you running.  It is a real shame what the servers do to the reputation of what could be a fine restaurant, but it is management's fault for not keeping an eye on the servers."}
{"text":"The tastiest Indian cuisine I've had in a very long time, and the waitstaff was friendly and attentive. The chef knows how to temper the spices to your liking. The lamb tikka masala is a must-have! I wish the rice and the naan bread came with the entrees, though; they have to be ordered separately."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I wanted some Indian food and found this restaurant. They have a nice and open area full of tables and a bar(ish) area. There is a small number of staff members. Their menu had a large amount of items to choose from. Four pages worth. Things are a little expensive. I wouldn't come here if you are expecting to get a $7 combo meal. We arrived right before they closed at the end of their lunch hours and had to order our food to go. I am not sure why they close and then open again a few hours later.  The staff was nice even though we arrived right as they were closing at the end of their lunch hours. They gave us drinks while we waited for our food.  Their food is AMAZING!! I had the Chicken Tikka Wrap with mint sauce. It was soooo good! We will be coming back to try more items on the menu."}
{"text":"This is one of the worst Indian restaurants I have ever been to and I get food from here almost every week. Why you ask? because below average indian food is good food and this is the best of the worst nearby.   People seem to be complaining about their prices but it no different than most other Indian restaurants. The lunch special is great deal; you get a salad, rice, soup, regular naan and whatever dish they are offering that day.  I personally prefer their coconut chicken and chicken korma. Always go for the garlic naan, you can't possibly regret that decision."}
{"text":"So, I am sorta new to Indian food.  I was introduced to it last year by my Indian coworkers and I am hooked.  This place is by far my favorite.  I liked it from my first visit, the waiter was helpful, knowledgeable and put up with my indecisiveness.    I have liked everything that I've tried here and I've tried a lot. I usually go with my Indian friends and therefore get to try new things that I might not have ordered for myself.  My personal favorites are the Chicken Korma, Chicken Tikka Masala, and some sort of shrimp dish that I don't remember the name of at the moment.    They usually have a belly dancer on the weekend which is always fun to watch."}
{"text":"Pathetic service. I am an Indian and I know how indian food is supposed to taste like. The food I got served was a joke. The server had the balls to argue with me and tell me that I had no idea how indian food is supposed to taste? Really moron I was born and brought up in India. Wish ok could give a minus rating. Want to save money? Never eat here."}
{"text":"Used to be my go to place when I lived in the west side.   Pros: Yummy food. I usually get chicken curry, lamb vindaloo and their garlic nan. Not the best I have eaten but great if u live in the west side.  Large portion in my opinion.  Cons: Place can get rly loud especially when they have large 10+ something group  They can get rly expensive for 2 people over $40.  Neutral: Staffs are ok. Sometimes you get friendlier staff than others. Could be improve."}
{"text":"Tandoori Times has a number of locations here in the valley and I've had the good fortune of eating at this one and the one located off of I-17 & Cactus.  I've eaten at this location at least 10 times as it's one of my wife's favorite restaurants.  We went on a Thursday night and walked in with a Groupon which they readily accepted.  One of the positives is that they have a full bar and a very nice wine list which my wife appreciates.  I like the full bar in case I want an old fashioned as I'm not much of a wine drinker.  I ordered the lamb vindaloo and the Princess ordered the chicken vindaloo.  The dinner portions are really family style with enough food for a couple of people so needless to say, we went home with leftovers.  It sure didn't hurt my feelings to have to scarf that down for lunch the next day.  The basmati rice is terrific, a little saffron and other spices and it's perfect with the vindaloo over the top of it.  The meal comes with naan and I love naan.  We buy it at Costco just to have around the house.  The naan here is a whole different level than what I pull out of that bag, let me tell you!  Soft, light, and perfectly toasted.  We upgraded to the chili naan which has green chilies sprinkled all over it.  It's awesome, definitely worth the next $1 or whatever it is.  Finished the meal with dessert, (surprise, surprise).  Went with the rice pudding which is of a much lighter consistency that what I would say most Americans are used to. It was very good, perfect way to end the meal and cleanse my palate, which is my argument for always having dessert .  It has the same flavor components as typical rice pudding, cinnamon, raisins, a little nutmeg, just not with the custard-like consistence.  They seem to be gradually upgrading the restaurant with new paint and decorations; it's a very comfortable restaurant with consistently good service.  I think you'll like it."}
{"text":"This will be a simple post...I love indian food, and this is HANDS DOWN the very best in Az. The Chicken makhani is so buttery, so savory...the Chicken tikka masala, the best I ever had. Service is always good, the food comes out fast. It's not super cheap, since you have to pretty much order everything ala cart, but it is worth it. If you go on Friday or Saturday there is also belly dancers. When in rome!"}
{"text":"Went in there to have dinner .. Tandoori chicken was ok types , spices not blended in properly .. Chicken tikka masala was good .. But punjabi prawn curry was dissapointment .."}
{"text":"Met up with some old college friends for dinner at Tandoori Times 2 a couple of Fridays back. We started with Samosas - mmmmmm. Went with my standard Vindaloo, and it was tasty as always (as was the Naan).  Friday night is belly dancing night.  The dancer was a) very good, b) very personable c) very funny and d) beautiful.  All of that was an unexpected bonus to a nice dinner and a great time catching up with old friends."}
{"text":"I decided to take my family to this location after 2 misses at the scottsdale location. Hoping for better food and service we went early hoping for a clean environment, fresh food, and good service. We were disappointed on all fronts. The staff was incompetent and a glass of water was simply to 'hard'. The floor was sticky, tables and chairs were dirty. The food was old and stale despite ordering al a carte. They even changed their naan bread so now it tastes like a pizza crust. Yuck. Im done with this restaurant and their incompetence. Please shut down and let someone take your location."}
{"text":"I am rating based on my experience. I had been gifted a Groupon from a friend and upon entry I presented it to the waiter. We were happily greeted and seated quickly. The service was nice and they were very attentive. The food was fine. It wasn't spectacular, but good! Wouldn't mind coming again, but perhaps not when its busy."}
{"text":"Such a great surprise. Amazing food. Great service D our server suggested great meals from the menu. We will defy. Be back!"}
{"text":"This is the first time I have eaten Indian food, so I would not be able to say if it is the best around. Here is what I do know, I had the lamb tikka marsala. It was very good and they brought the chutneys on the side so I could adjust the heat according to my own white boy whimpy palate.  The service was good and I will be back to try other things to expand my culinary boundaries."}
{"text":"This is the best Indian food that I have ever had in Arizona... maybe even in the entire United States! The chicken tikka masala is to die for. I'm used to Indian food in London, and anyone who's eaten indian in london knows that indian out here doesn't even compare! But this place is absolutely amazing! My mother (who is indian and a snob when it comes to indian food) surprisingly loved this place! whenever i tell her i'm going to Tandori Times she is very very jealous.   The staff is nice, service is good. Havent been there when the bellydancer is there, which would kind of irritate me. Only thing i didn't like was that one of the waitresses didn't speak english. Which was odd seeing as she was a server.  I was just asking for a take away box and it seemed too much for her to handle.   Decent Prices, a bit pricey compared to thai or pizza or something, but its well worth it.  Apart from the Chicken Tikka Masala (that i order everytime i go) the Eggplant dish is also very good, as well as the lentils and the Garlic Naan.   This place is a must!"}
{"text":"Time for an update, and I'm taking away a star for one reason. The food has remained delicious and the lunch specials are priced right (the lamb vindaloo I had there on 4th July was awesome), but there's something that pissed me right off when I ordered takeout recently. Portion size. It's $9-$11 dollars for an 8-oz container of food, depending on what you get. Get three different containers along with rice and a naan and you're almost at $40. That's WAY too expensive, no matter how tasty the food is. I know how to make this stuff (technically, although I have problems achieving the flavour) and I know what the ingredients cost. They're making money hand-over-dot at this place and the final issue I have is that my 8-oz container of chicken makhani was less than half chicken and the rest sauce. See my Tandoori Village review for more information on this. They need to knock their prices WAY down. I want a take-out meal for two and I want it to be under thirty bucks. When I can get three pounds of Chinese food for under $20 (see my review of Chen & Wok in Surprise), paying double that for less food doesn't strike me as a particularly good deal. Don't anyone make the mistake that this place is haute cuisine either. It ain't Gaylords. Not by a long shot. And Gaylords is pretty far from haute cuisine itself."}
{"text":"Yes, yuuuuussss you made my list.   On a Sunday, when vaguely far away breakfast brunch options are only legal in other counties, you, consummate professional, invoking me in with  hot tea, warm atmosphere, and friendly service.   Ask, if you don't know. Aditya, my counselor, proved to me there are still flavors out there. Experiences to be had.  It should be added that I notoriously hate yogurt, and potato and grapefruit ( it's not a grapefruit, is not a fruit, it's a fucking lie).   And somehow they made it all work.   Cheers man. To Aditya, to the cook, bring that shit, you guys prove that American food still sucks."}
{"text":"This food is amazing here. I have been here a few times and loved it every time. But every time we go it's literally dead in there which I find odd but I think it has to do with the location, you can't see it from the road you do have to know where your going to get to it. Our service tonight was okay, not the best, our waitress was very much an airhead and the other waitress actually had to check on us a few times. But I go there for the amazing food. Their garlic naan is amazing and beef vindaloo was delicious! If your looking for amazing Indian food this is the place!"}
{"text":"Awesome service, very nice waitress, and really comfortable and clean interior.  But the food leaves a little something to be desired. It seemed like everyone at the restaurant enjoyed it, but I found the food to be quite plain and probably watered down for the locals. Very high prices for Indian food as well.  Maybe it's just not my taste, but if you go home without any stomach pains, it probably wasn't real Indian food."}
{"text":"What a great unexpected surprise of delicious Indian food in my hood! We didn't get to do too much research on Indian restaurants that night and since there are not many great Indian restaurants in Central and North Phoenix, I didn't feel compelled to put in the effort. Learned helplessness you can say. After driving around before our movie, we found this wonderful restaurant and will be coming back for more.   Tandoori Times has great ambiance with fun Indian art on the wall. Our servers were very pleasant and you can tell they were happy working there. We tried the lamb briyani, saag paneer, and chili naan. Although they had some innovative and creative Indian dishes we decided to stick with more traditional dishes. The saag had a slightly more watery consistency than what I am used to but the taste was incredible. The lamb briyani was light and not so oily like other briyani dishes. My favorite was the chili naan, which was light, fluffy, and tasted awesome baked with chilies and cilantro. Their side \"condiments\" was unique, which included a mixture of pickled chopped ginger, lemon, garlic and other spices.   We were so glad to have tried this restaurant and hope to be back to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"More like 3.5 stars this is their 2nd location with the 1st in old town scottsdale.  There isn't much to the decor but it's pretty clean and the food is consistent.  While they need more hired and seasoned help the staff is friendly and do what they can.  But the real reason to go there - the naan.  Hmmm....hmmmm... good.  Pillowy soft and freshly made in their tandoor oven."}
{"text":"Went here and got the Prawn Vindaloo. It packs a decent punch and the flavor is wonderful. I paired it up with a pesto naan and could not be happier. Everything I've tried here has been amazing and I will keep coming back every now and then to dine! Their chicken tikka masala and lamb is always great as well. If you're a fan of curry I would definitely give this place a try! Their mango ice cream had a very subtle flavor and was a pleasure to try as well."}
{"text":"Oh my god. Was this a win or what?   I enjoy spice and Indian food a lot, but I'm always nervous about cleanliness and getting an explosive asshole later in the evening.   However, my experience at Tandoori Times 2 left me with no worries, a belly full of Lamb Boti Masala and Flying Horse beer.   As soon as we walked in I was addicted to the smell, curry permeated my clothes as I began to salivate.  The waitress was knowledgeable about the dishes and helped in my selection process. The side of rice for $2.50 was HUGE. It disappointed me that they didn't serve the rice with the dish, but it was worth the $2.50   We had a free cup of chai tea to top of our meal!   I will definitely be coming back. I'm addicted."}
{"text":"Indian food in Arizona.  I think Tandoori Times is a solid Indian restaurant for great saucy masala, soft and tender fish, hot crispy naan, and super flavorful chicken.  But minus points for Justin Y. to receive an unpleasant bathroom experience after T.T. and the food took literally forever to come out.   I really did appreciate the ALL YOU CAN DRINK self-serve chai tea  I liked it. JY didn't."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Indian food, and I was very impressed! I wish I could give 4 1/2 stars; the only thing I would take a half star off for is that it was too loud inside the restaurant. The music, although very cool and authentic Indian sounding, was just too loud to be able to hear one another speak. And also, this is really really a personal preference, but the barefoot belly dancer just kinda freaked me out a little! :-p  But other than that, the restaurant was fun, festive, comfortable, and we had fantastic service.   And the food - wow!! Everything we had was incredibly flavorful and so well spiced; just really interesting and unique flavor. The naan was Out. Of. This. World!! It was warm and fresh out of the tandoor with a soft, doughy/chewy texture and so much more flavor than I could have imagined you could pack into a piece of bread! The plain butter naan was my favorite but the garlic naan was pretty fantastic too, with a generous amount of fresh garlic on top.   We will definitely come back to tandoori times 2 again!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! I loved the Chicken Tiki Masala, the tandoori chicken is amazing! The service was great even when we came in close to closing time!! They gave us great food and it tasted great!!"}
{"text":"Note: I have only been here once as my fiance isn't a big fan of Indian food.. but I have been day dreaming about it ever since.  My friend I grabbed lunch here on a Friday afternoon. Considering we went during what would normally be considered the \"lunch rush\", I was surprised that it wasn't more crowded. But, she had raved about their lunch specials so I was excited to try TT out. We were quickly greeted with ice water and offered fresh brewed chai. Our waiter was great. While he was new (he had just started a week before) but was friendly, knowledgeable and seemed super enthusiastic about the food.  We decided to split an order of Samosas to start. Wow, best Samosas that I have had EVER. The outside was cooked perfectly, soft but crispy and warm. The filling of potatoes and peas was creamy and spiced perfectly. They were served with a garbanzo masala chutney that was out of this world. Seriously I could have eaten the chutney with a spoon.  My friend had the lamb vindaloo which is the special on Friday, so she was served her main course, a salad, rice and naan. This is the dish she had raved to me about, and she seemed to be equally pleased with it the day we went. I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala and it didn't disappoint. The chicken was tender and the sauce was wonderfully creamy with just enough heat. I also ordered a side of chili naan... it was huge WAY too much for one person, but was so delicious I wanted to eat the whole order.   I will be back... And, while I would like to say that I will try other dishes, it will be hard to pull myself away from the Samosas... and the Chicken Tikka Masala. Seriously. Check this place out."}
{"text":"The spicy wings are not cooked all the way through. Normally I have never had a problem with this restaurant and love the tandoori spicy chicken wings. The wings were undercooked, please fix this problem as I've been going to this place for years. Paid 15.00 for something I can't eat.."}
{"text":"This place is a gem. I love the way they treat my family when I come here. The belly dancer always engages with my daughter. The servers are always kind and attentive without being intrusive. We like the paneer tandoori as an appetizer and the chicken tikka masala. The naan is top shelf too. Overall you are going to have a great night."}
{"text":"Long waiting time.. expensive food..lunch specials are also not worthy.. rice was not properly bolied.. taste was good but there are lot of good indian restaurants in the valley which are also not so expensive.."}
{"text":"Our first visit to Tandoori Times 2 will not be our last. The chicken tikka wrap features high end flavor and great naan.  Tandoori lamb chops are savory, well seasoned, and tender.  Today's delight was dessert. Ras malai. Part of the fun of exploration is looking up what you had for lunch to reinforce the flavor experience.  We look forward to visiting again."}
{"text":"Loved the food or maybe it was the 4 hours of non stop driving that precipitated this. In any case, service was attentive, although we went at nearly closing time. Food was hot and tasty. Not much to complain about, I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for good Indian food."}
{"text":"This was my second visit, and to be honest, I'm not someone that eats Indian food very much, this time I went with a party of 8 many of them are from India.  This time around I opted for the SEEKH KABOB LAMB, which was mostly meat on a plate of onions and peppers.  I really wished that bread or Ngo would have come with it, but I resolved that pretty quick with another order.  My co-diners were very good, they helped explain other items on the menu to me and help me pick out future dishes.  Overall the food is very good and very ethnic.  The service struggled not only with our larger party but the lunch rush.  If you like Indian food or want to try it, I would suggest Andoori Times."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised. I'm Indian and so I'm always skeptical of places like this. I thought it was really good. Seriously. Just don't expect an Indian experience it's adapted for a wider audience."}
{"text":"Love this place! Especially for their lunch buffet, which is available during the week and on weekends. Lots of variety and high quality. Good service too."}
{"text":"Their food is so amazing. You can definitely do family style. I don't know exactly what we had. I know the bread was good. And I believe we had shrimp and coconut curry. Those were fantastic. :)"}
{"text":"I work very close to this restaurant. I have eaten here many, many times. The service is not always the best but the food has always been excellent. In my opinion the food is MUCH better than the Maharaja Palace. I can honestly say that I have never had a bad meal here. I also work with many people from India and they all love the place. To me that is a good sign. The only down side I have ever seen here is the service. Like one of the reviewers said before, I have had issues with being charged wrong, etc. I would recommend it for anyone that loves Indian food like I do."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The food is so good!  I have ordered multiple things off the menu over the course of a few visits, and I have yet to be disappointed. I have nothing bad to say about the food or service. Portion size is a bit small but the quality is outstanding."}
{"text":"Eat here if you can. Very good food in a clean and friendly environment. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because on the day I came butter chicken was not available and because it's more expensive than other  similar restaurants."}
{"text":"Amazing! I had the tandoori chicken (chef hot), plain rice and garlic naan. Thank you for actually making it HOT and not holding back one bit."}
{"text":"This is one of the better places to go for Indian food. I have only had the lunch items at this place. I usually go with either the chicken or lamb lunch special. It's pretty clean and service was good for a busy lunch time. I hear they have a belly dancer on Friday evenings."}
{"text":"Probably the best Indian food we have had in Phoenix after living in Dubai for 5 years. Wait staff is efficient and friendly. Dal Tardhka and Tandoori is good. It was a bit strange being entertained with a belly dancer and Arabic music though. Would be nicer to have Hindi music and bharatnatyam dance."}
{"text":"This is THE BEST INDIAN FOOD ON EARTH!!! Hubby and I had the chicken tikka masala and tandoori chicken recommended by our host Tamina and boy was she right! We were blown away by how fresh and how perfectly spices and cooked it was. We will be back very very soon."}
{"text":"First and foremost the service of the Host was fantastic....(I'm sorry I didn't get your name. However, he is Indian). 5 STARS to you my friend!  Well it's about time I have decent food and beyond decent in the Phoenix area. I've been suffering from the move from Los Angeles and not having access to a variety of amazing authentic foods and choices. Finally, Tandoori Times has met my needs to this overdue craving of something delicious.   I recommend their spin on the Chicken Tikka Masala. Their's is not what I am accustomed to having that is rich in tomato which provides that amazing color to the eye from the redness of the tomatoes. Their's is orange and on a paler side. But that's okay it was still very good. The chicken choice of meat is on the lower end of the cuts, legs, thighs...I've had chicken tikka masala back in L.A. at one of my favorite places and it's pure white-breastedsuperlicious! NO JOKE.   I was not a fan of the curry here. It is bland and flavor is super light. The naan garlic bread is fresh, yet a bit oily. It is still good. I had the trio of deserts: rice pudding, mango ice cream and some sorta what they call it a carrot cake...was more like mush. Sorry. I took a bit of each and honestly cannot say I had another bite. I didn't like it and wouldn't order or recommend it. Sorry....I'm not a fan. However, I still gave you 4 stars. Come on now!!   The ambiance of the restaurant is quiet pleasant and I am into architecture and design. Oddly, enough I noticed the lighting again the drapery with two different color light bulbs in blue and orange. It was so amazing. The simple things that catch my attention....OOooooHHHH....AaaaH.   Anyways, it's a very nice place and I would absolutely recommend it. Great place for any occasion. Check it out! : )"}
{"text":"We drove by and decided to stop. Wed night. Not a good sign. We Waite Dover an hour for an appetizer. Place was in total disarray - food was mediocre- not a good experience..."}
{"text":"May I say I have been here a few times before and I don't think I would have given a 5. Maybe a 4, or 3 at times. They do get points for the delicious free chai, though.  This time, the company  made all the difference... I went with a group of coworkers/friends from India, I arrived late and they had already ordered (we usually eat family style, which I love)...  What a great surprise their choices were... We first got 3 different dishes, all dry... one chicken, one fish and one I believe was lamb, that last one looks to me like sausage/hamburger meat consistency... (I need to learn my names)  Then we got rice (white and saffron) and biryani. Plus 3 dishes with reddish sauce (fish, chicken and shrimp)...  Plus 2 baskets of naan... I think only the naan in the top was garlic and the ones at the bottom were plain, but they were still very good. Also, I asked for some butter to eat with a piece of naan an they brought me what seemed to be real, rich, flavorful butter. Yum...  Plus, let me say it again... the free chai. Delicious chai.  Well, if you don't take sugar you may want to take your own sweetener because they only have sugar and Sweet'n Low...  Of course, the service was very good, and may I add that in the past we have asked for split checks and they don't seem to frown about it."}
{"text":"On Sunday, July 6, I read a sign on the front door of this restaurant that read, \"We are closed on Sunday, July 6 in honor of Independence Day.\"   If the owner decided to use the July 4 weekend to take off for San Diego or something, I would have appreciated his being honest. I don't appreciate being insulted with a pitch that you are closed on July 6 \"in honor of\" July 4.   The worst part is that I drove 20 miles to pick up my mom for her birthday and then drove an additional 20 miles from her house to Glendale in order to read the sign about celebrating July 4 on July 6. Lesson learned. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from here today, as their webpage advertises that they now deliver. We recently had a baby, so this seems like a good excuse to try it. Sweet!  First, the good news: the food was (as always) very tasty. I'm very happy to have such a good Indian restaurant so close to home.  The bad: they charge a delivery fee of $10, plus a fuel fee of an additional $5. This turned a $35 lunch for two into $50. This seems pretty extreme, and given that the place is only 2 miles from home, a pretty bad value proposition.  Get the takeout, skip the delivery and save yourself $15."}
{"text":"\"Where's the Beef?\" is the statement that comes to mind when you order food from here.  My delivery bill came out to be 77.61.  14.50 was for delivery.  I ordered: Lamb Biryani, Tandoori Lamb Chops (4 pieces), Garlic and Onion Naan, Goa Prawn Curry a la carte.  The taste of the curry, like a 4, was good unfortunately the prices here are pretty expensive for only a few pieces of prawn, 5 or 6 small pieces  They didn't even cook shrimp right.  It was tough, hard, and chewy.  Way overcooked.    The Naan itself was very good and dipping it in the Prawn Curry sauce was great.  It tasted fresh baked.  The Lamb Chops were small pieces of chops.  Taste was a 2.5-3.  Overcooked and dry.  Portion was small.  The 4 pieces combined probably equaled one piece pork chop at most restaurants.  The Lamb Biryani was mostly rice.  Hardly any lamb but a few small slices.  Again, where's the beef (Wendy's commercial from the 80's).  The order was $77.61 and only got a little bit of meat.    So disappointed.  2 stars because the food tasted decently fresh but the cooking technique was off, taste was okay but lack of flavor, and small portions for high prices was a turn-off."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT! Food was great service was outstanding! Had a party of 21 couldnt have picked a better place! Had a BLAST thanks Adi for the excellent food and Service...Plus the Belly dancer was fantastic! Thank you made my mothers birthday fabulous!"}
{"text":"I would really like this place...If the service was a tad faster.  It is slow, let me repeat, it is S   L    O   W.  I have been here a couple times now.  It takes them awhile to acknowledge you, then when you are seated it will be a nice wait before they return. It is slow from the moment you order, down to when you need your check.  You get the picture.  But damn it, I enjoyed the food here. If it wasn't for the slow service, I would be here regularly.   I like the garlic naan, the chicken tikka masala, and the chili prawns.  Can't forget the curry chicken, or was it vindaloo.  Anyhow, I had a number of items here and I think there was only one that I thought was okay.  But for the most part the food was tasty.  The rice was too dry, but it is jasmine i think, and I think that is how this type of rice is to be.   There is free chai too.  That is always nice.  I would come back more if the service was better.  I thought the food was great, so hopefully the service sector improves, and then I would make this my regular spot for dinner or lunch."}
{"text":"Yummy Indian food. Much better than nearby Taj Mahal. A little pricey but offers Indian food in a location where it is often hard to find! Love carrry-out. Really quick!"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved the food,and we tried a variety. Major issue is with the service. It was the worst of ANYWHERE I have ever eaten.  There is no excuse for this,especially on a Tuesday with only 4 tables occupied. They really need some management present in that establishment!"}
{"text":"Great Naan choices. The menu is delicious and has many options. The service is great and it is conveniently located."}
{"text":"This place was great for lunch. I think it was my first time at this location. I'd definitely go again for lunchtime. :)"}
{"text":"Finally, a decent Indian restaurant in Phoenix...and I have tried a lot of them!  We went to Tandoori Times 2 from a recommendation of a guy I work with who is Pakistani and is married to an Indian woman (yeah, I know, their parents were probably ecstatic when they brought each other home)...So we figured, if he is recommending it, why not?!  We were pleasantly surprised. We had some Samosas, Chicken Tikka, Palak Peneer and vegetable biryani. All came out piping hot and quite tasty.  The Chicken Tikka was tender and not at all dried out. The Palak Peneer was excellent - a little sweeter than I am accustomed to, but still very nice. My son, who is three, couldn't get enough of the biryani - he kept shovelling it in. And the samosas choolay (sp?) were very good! The sauce they brought them out in was just spicy enough to enjoy without overrwhelming the food.  So 3 stars for the food, and 1 star for the service. Our server, Omar, is an ASU student and he was great. He said he is studying elementary education so he was really good with our son.  We will definitely be eating here again!   BTW, while the restaurant is good for kids, unless your child is able to eat spicy food - I don't recommend it. In our case, my son seems to be able to eat all the spicy foods his mom so loves..."}
{"text":"Another great find in Glendale. This restaurant was recommended to me by Indian friends from my school - and I believe they visited Tandoori Times frequently.   They serve both Northern and Southern style cuisines. I tried something new every time I went and was also happy with the food. My favorite is the Chicken Tikka Masala.  In the evenings (on the weekends) they have a belly dancer but I find it to be more of an annoyance than entertainment because it appears that she works for tips and gets in your face."}
{"text":"First off, I had never had Indian food before here- so Indian food critics, I'm not the reviewer for you.   For not having Indian food before, I have to say that this place is great! The staff are very friendly and helpful with the menu. They have a good selection of bottled beers (I stuck with kingfisher an Indian import). Very good. They have happy hour from 4-7 everyday- not bad on prices.   This is now the second time I have been here. Ambiance is nice and casual, yet still feels kind of fancy. On Fridays nights there is a belly dancer which adds an interesting element. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with this place. My boyfriend and I went on a Thursday night and the place was almost empty. There were only 4 other tables besides us. When we walked in there was a sign saying to wait to be seated, so we waited, and waited. Finally after about 4 minutes, one of the staff looked up from something behind the bar and noticed us. He instructed us to \"sit wherever\". We chose a table by a window on the North side of the restaurant(apparently a bad choice) . After another 5 minutes we were given menus. Another 5 minutes later we were brought some water. We placed our order. We had Samosas for an appetizer. They tasted ok but were very dry. They were served with \"Tamarind chutney\" rather than a tamarind sauce. The chutney was mostly garbanzo beans with some fresh onion and cilantro and a tiny drizzle of tamarind sauce. We ordered Lamb Biryani and Chicken Korma plus rice and Naan. The Naan was very good and the Korma was ok. The Biryani was not good. The lamb was very dry and the dish really just tasted like bell peppers. The Raita was very watery and didn't add any flavor.   During the meal we were ignored by the waitstaff. There were 2 people working and they checked on the 2 tables on the West side of the restaurant 3 times each while we were trying to flag them down for more water. Both of them hung out behind the bar. One was reading the other seemed to be on the internet. We finally got more water after about 15 minutes. Then we were ignored again while the waitstaff continued to cater to the other tables. We had to flag them down again for our bill, and again to get them to take the money.   Never again."}
{"text":"Having lived in New Delhi as a child for 4 years, I have always been on the lookout for a good Indian restaurant in the States, wherever I have lived (I even found a good one in Fort Wayne, Indiana!).  For most Indian restaurants, the trend is to put out large tubs of curries and tandoori chicken made with ready-made pastes.  With pre-made pastes, it is impossible to get a fantastic Indian meal, it must be made with fresh ingredients, from scratch (even down to making your own cheese).  It got to the point that I could not scratch that itch for the authentic tasting stuff so I started making it on my own at home.  Just like Mexican food, the best stuff is made at home, not in the restaurants.      However, the Tandoori Times bistro came along in Scottsdale and I had finally found my culinary nirvana.  Then as if prayers were being answered, Tandoori Times 2 came to Glendale.  Their tandoori chicken is exactly as I remembered it at Modhi Mahal's in Delhi, as is the dal, nan, mattar paneer.      I've read a lot of mixed reviews of TT2 here on Yelp ranging from \"beyond bad\" to exquisite.  I don't understand this, maybe because most Americans don't know what to expect with Indian food because they either think it's native American food or they've never had it in their life before (most Americans already know Mexican food, whether they like it or not).  One thing about food from India, is that it is an ancient cuisine going back thousands of years.  Mexican food as we know it (tacos, enchiladas, tostadas etc.) is relatively new.  Why is this important to know?  Well, even the rice is different, basmati rice has been developed for thousands of years to get the size of grain and taste:  they CARE about what grain of rice they use, it has to be basmati (Uncle Joe's Brown rice just isn't the same, sorry).  This is the feeling I get from TT2, they know what authentic Indian food is and what it takes to make it and it is no trivial, slap-a-burger-on-the-grill-and-fry-it type of food.  It takes days of preparation to put out the correct recipe and it doesn't come from canned pastes.      This really shows up in the end result at Tandoori Times 2 and makes their somewhat high priced menu worth it if you know what really goes into making good cuisine of India.  Finally someone is putting in the time and effort to making really good Indian food."}
{"text":"We've been here before but it had been a few years. Definitely enjoyable Indian food and since I'm allergic to some common Indian ingredients it is helpful that the staff were friendly and understanding. Our waiter went back to double check ingredients on a dish before I ordered. Everyone at our table liked their food and drinks. Note that most of the meals don't come with rice and you need to order it separately. This is pretty standard Indian fare, but enjoyable. I could have done without the dancer, but that's part of the atmosphere."}
{"text":"The food is totally terrible. Me being from India, I expected a bit more from this restaurant, but looks like the chef just forgot how to put out a good dish. I ordered a Paneer saag which was bland, watery and lacked any flavor what so ever. The paneer was old and fragmented, distasteful and above all, it was STALE. I would never pay $11 for a dish and get stale food. The soda had no fizz and wasnt cold enough, The music was so loud that I had to shout if I had to talk to my wife sitting across the table from me. The ambience is poor and the lighting is so dull that it resembles more like a whore house rather than a restaurant. I am never going back to this restaurant or any of its other locations. The food is utter boring and would suit a palette which has no taste of spices. Disappointing."}
{"text":"This has always been a favorite place of mine. However, we haven't been here in awhile because we were so busy planning our wedding! Our biggest mistake! Shame on us!  Tonight, I was immediately reminded of how great the service was and delicious our food is. Tony and Noha were amazing! We were greeted with smiles and they were so friendly and personable! Definitely ask for them the next time you visit. The entire staff was welcoming and am so pleased with our experience all together.   And it was our first time seeing  the evening entertainment! The Belly Dancer - we couldn't take our eyes off of her. So talented and danced beautifully!  Definitely worth having a date night here.   The food, as always..... Wonderful! Fresh, healthy, quality food, and full of flavor . We cannot wait to comeback. I could honestly eat here everyday. Thanks for the wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"I've decided. I'm never coming here again. The first time I came here a week ago was great.... This time, it sucks. Waitress took 5 whole minutes just to hand me a menu. Then she had the gall to ask me if I needed a few more minutes. Um, yes... Considering the closed menu in front of me.  Their food is good, based on my last experience. I wouldn't know this time around because I've been waiting over 30 minutes. Granted, there are a fair amount of people here, but over 30 minutes, and I was supposed to have an appetizer. Yeah right!  There's one server who is actually paying attention to me and he keeps telling me how backed up the kitchen is due to take out orders... I think they need to reevaluate how their kitchen is run, especially if this is a regular occurrence. Waiting 40 plus minutes for food is absolutely ridiculous. I was hungry when I walked in. Now I'm HANGRY.  -------------------------  OK, this is in response to \"Sunny.\" I was offered pompadam as \"compensation\" for sitting there 40 minutes with no food. I wasn't in the mood for it. So, the waitress asked me if there was anything else she could bring me. I looked at her with renewed hope and said, yes, could I have Naan instead, fully under the impression that this would be comped. More time passed with no Naan, and by this time, nearly 45 minutes after ordering my appetizer, it finally made its way to my table. The waitress then comes back and says if I still want the Naan, they have to charge me for it. Are you kidding me? It took 45 minutes to get am appetizer. I'm clearly agitated and now you're going to take away the item that was supposed to make it better? No, I'm sorry, that is NOT good customer service. And on top of it, instead of just admitting you made a mistake, you attack me for MAKING you comp the Naan. Really?! Is a $3 basket of Naan really worth losing hundreds of potential dollars I could have spent over the coming years as a loyal customer worth it? And by the way, most other Indian restaurants offer Naan as part of the meal, complimentary. So, I hope you are happy. I think you have great food. But your handling of the situation leaves a lot to be desired.   And for the record, if tandoori chicken takes longer than average to prepare, perhaps you should consider saying that on the menu and mentioning it at the time of order."}
{"text":"The food was bland. The service was kind, but very slow. The naan tasted like Wonder Bread. I have been to many Indian restaurants, some good, and many just okay. In almost all of them, the food was better than in this place. Also, there were more Indian people in all of those restaurants than in this place. That should have been an early hint."}
{"text":"My husband loves Indian food, so we stopped by for lunch since we were on Bell Road already. I had to order the Chicken Tandoori wrap again. It was good and the naan was just fluffy enough... My husband ordered the daily special (Beef Stew, Garlic Naan - extra $, and comes with rice). The daily special was AWESOME! We had great service and the waiter was good to look at too. Great food, good scenery, I am one happy woman!"}
{"text":"We were first introduced to Tandoori Times 2 by an Indian friend who took us there for lunch. They have an affordable lunch menu that is worth checking out. More recently, we've ordered different dishes to-go and then eaten it at home with our own rice. I highly recommend the coconut chicken, butter chicken, and tikka masalas. The garlic naan is also well done. We've enjoyed their food each time.  Pros: -Taste!  Cons: -Price is a little high."}
{"text":"They serve one of the best tandoori chicken in the valley. Unlimited Chai !Service is good.  If you are looking for a quiet dinner avoid Fri,Sat and Sun. They have Belly Dancing and the worst part is they put the music so LOUD, the even its difficult for the server to hear you"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! It is a bit of a hidden gem, not easily seen from the road. We got the chicken tikka masala (wonderful) and the curried chicken which I have dubbed the best I've ever had! We also got the naan basket which is several different flavors of naan. We will definitely be going back. Food was amazing, service was fantastic!!"}
{"text":"I am so excited to finally find great Indian food in Phoenix! So far I've been here twice and the food is delicious and authentic. I will definitely be coming back! Perfect tandoori chicken and shrimp vindaloo. Yum!"}
{"text":"I have visited this restaurant multiple times, mostly as a part of a large party (greater than 6) and I'm impressed at the quality of service.   The ambiance is nice and the belly dancing on Friday nights are pretty good (people really get into it!), although it does get loud due to the music.   The staff is pretty friendly and generally let you know right away if something is not available and suggests alternatives. I have found that some of the tables do not have the necessary spoon/fork/knife at times and the staff does not bother to check that.  The food is generally good, but I have been disappointed once by the okra curry (bhindi masala), it was not what I expected. The quantity of food is good and for $20, we usually end up eating a lot and even taking some food home.   The free Chai (tea) is an added bonus!"}
{"text":"In short : Very Very tasty Indian Non-Veg Food. Service is Ok. Pricing is a little to the higher side.  Tandoori chicken is well cooked. Lamb Biryani is my Favorite. Chicken Biryani is excellent. (I'm a fan of Biryani(s) ). Yes, the Naan is good and chicken masala is the perfect side. Do not try out Veggie curries here. Mostly they are not well cooked or seasoned. Staff is Ok. Service is a little delayed, but understandable.  I've been there only for Dinners and the Ambience looks intimate. Somedays they have a belly dancer (well she's good with Bollywood songs too )  They seem to have some happy hours and lunch time discounts, but I've tried out only Dinners and the pricing is a little to the higher side.  Bottom Line : Tasty Food, Need to carry a heavy Valet, Suitable if you are planning to impress someone."}
{"text":"So I was having a really bad craving for Indian food one day. I had always heard about this place and was curious so I went in. Initially I wanted to get my food to go but the manager or owner (sorry I'm not quite sure) struck up a conversation with me and talked me into dining in and enjoying my meal there. And why not this was a rare day I was off work. Kids at camp. Why not? The gentleman answered all of my questions about the menu and and what he recommended. And the food was delicious!! I had a side salad, nann bread, rice, a spicy chicken tikka masala and it was all so good! I will definitely come back and I recommend this place to anyone who is looking to have a great meal and service."}
{"text":"I was a regular customer at this location for the last year or so, but have recently been turned off by certain events.  I've been here several times, and I pretty much always go with the same people.  Splitting our checks has never really been an issue, except the last two times that we've been.  We usually just ask for an even split between two or three cards- not a huge deal.  However, my friend has been charged TWO times for one order, meaning, they haven't charged one of the cards given.  The first time this happen, they took care of it quickly, however, the second time, they gave her the run-around and wanted her to ask the person whose card had not been swiped to come back in with it.  What if she was dining with someone she didn't know?  How is this her fault?    Needless to say, I would only visit again with cash in hand."}
{"text":"We went for our son, who had to write a paper on Indian cuisine.  My husband is most adventurous with food and will try most anything.  He did eat about 1/2 of his.  My son and I just took one bite.  We were not impressed! The waitress was very nice, service was good.  The food was not to our liking though.."}
{"text":"i've eaten indian food in nyc, london and mt kisco ny.....alll very good and tendoori is right up there with the best.  excellent food excellent service.  our server was raymond and he was very attentive and very helpful.  we were a group of 4, each having something different.  i highy recommend the mango chicken. can hardly wait to go back........all of us were very pleased."}
{"text":"Tandoori is absolutely delicious. Me and my husband love going there for lunch especially. The chicken tikka masala wrap it very good and so is the chicken makhani the naan bread is fresh daily. The service is great the staff if very attentive. They also have complimentary Indian tea during lunch and belly dancing on Friday nights. One of the best places to eat in the northwest valley"}
{"text":"Just finished dinner with my girlfriend here at this restaurant and I must say the food was outstanding!  I never really sat down and enjoyed food from India before but I must say the food is AWESOME! My girlfriend is  big fan of the dishes and she convinced me to try it and I'm hooked! The restaurant is clean and the service is wonderful. It seems that the weekdays are the best time to go is like after 6p.m. it's pretty quiet. I understand that they have a lunch buffet as well so I'm sure that's very good as well. I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"My favorite Indian restaurant anywhere in Phoenix.  The food is amazing here. I am so sad that the #3 location closed, but I am willing to drive the extra distance!  Try the saag paneer, garlic naan and the malai kofta."}
{"text":"I went about a year ago because of a groupon. We had just moved to the valley and were jonesing for some Indian food. This place had some pretty good reviews- so we took our groupon and checked it out.   The atmosphere is really nice. It is upscale and has a nice decor. It is different than a lot of the more run down Indian places I have been to.   Anyways, thank god we had a groupon. This place was so expensive. I have had Indian food in different parts of the world (Germany, California, Kentucky, and Georgia) and was shocked at the prices. Plus here (and other valley Indian places) you have to pay for rice. Why do I have to pay for rice? How am I supposed to eat this liquid delishness without a semi-solid medium to bring to my mouth? I know its only 1-2 dollars, but its the principle. Just give me rice! And keep it coming. Don't nickle dime your customers, I was already paying 13 dollars for an entree.   The food was really good. I enjoyed it. I had my usual of Paneer tike masala and it was perfect. Husband had chicken vindaloo and liked it. He is a hot and spicey lover, and like most restaurants it did not quite bring the heat. He wants to enjoy his meal with tears streaming down his face and his sinuses cleared for the next year. This place while flavorful, did not bring the heat he so desperately is searching for. We also shared some naan, and I don't really remember if it was good or bad, so I guess it was just ok.  So I liked this place, but will I be back? No probably not, its just too rich for my blood. I am still on the hunt for spicy, delicious Indian food that is cheap in the valley. Anybody know where I can get some?"}
{"text":"Best food, great service, don't believe the reviews. We got the biryani which was exceptional. The Chicken Vindelu was AMAZING! Very spicy but a very good spicy flavor. Will definitely recommend and I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Food was fantastic had the paneer tikka masala, service was great, never needed to ask for drink refills. Nice place not too loud."}
{"text":"So delicious! The amazing spices are going to haunt my dreams!  Unlimited chai, mango lassi, matter paneer and garlic naan... I almost died. Stole some of my boyfriend's raita that came with his lamb biryani (which was enough to feed two hungry people very happily) since my matter paneer was so deliciously spicy!  We were one of two guests on a Thursday night and waited for nothing, service was amazing, our server had great suggestions for both of us."}
{"text":"One my favorite Indian restaurants in AZ. Amazing tasty food, Anything from tandoori wings to shrimp biryani chicken tikka masala. Staff is friendly and cooks are on point every time this is the only Indian place I eat and recommend in AZ Must Try"}
{"text":"Didn't like the vibe and service was slow as f and hella expensive for much better dishes that are less expensive !"}
{"text":"We placed an order for delivery and were told it would take 30-45 minutes to receive. We waited an hour, called the restaurant and were told they had not received the order. Spoke to the manager who said they did have the order and it would be to us in 45 minutes (2 hours after ordering). Very disappointed. Our food still hasn't arrived. To be continued..."}
{"text":"This place is really horrible. Salty dishes and very little food for the money. Goat is grissley and very little meat. I have gotten better naan at Safeway. The naan is dowy thick under cooked. I eat in a lot of Indian restaurant all over the country and this one is off my list. You want good Indian food try Delhi palace in Tempe and compare fir your self. This is it once fir me here."}
{"text":"I was a little apprehensive about eating Indian food in Glendale - I lived in Los Angeles for years and had access to some pretty amazing Indian food. Tandoori Times 2 is located in a strip mall in Glendale and is honestly pretty unassuming.  Service was pretty good - our waitress was on top of things and kept our water glasses full and offered her suggestions when prompted.   For dinner we ordered the   Samosa Choley: Two crusty pastries stuffed with green peas & potatoes served with garbanzo masala assorted chutney - The pastry was cooked to perfection and the garbanzo bean masala was super flavorful and quite honestly the stand out of the appetizer.   We also had a an order of the plain naan and the pesto naan - The stand out winner was the classic plain naan!   The Chicken Tikka Masala was great - the portion was a little on the small size. We ordered a Lamb dish as well which was pretty good. My favorite was the goat curry which is the special offered on Fridays.   If your in the area and looking for something other than your typical TGI Fridays than this is a great place to explore!"}
{"text":"The Channa Masala is incredibly bland and was served alone for 11.99. Rice is additional.  The Chile Stuffed Naan for 2.95/pc is not 'stuffed' with chili.  There is a miniscule amount of chili sprinkled over the top.  Otherwise it is the same as the naan for 1.95/pc.  If you want flavor, this is not the place to go.  Maharaja Palace across the street is much better."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this restaurant. Their butter chicken is by far my favorite dish with the garlic naan. It has boneless chicken pieces with a creamy butter sauce (it almost tastes cheesy, probably why I love it!). Every person that I've brought here to try it, has loved it!"}
{"text":"I'm not saying it because I worked here for a few months, but they have the BEST Indian food in town. I got to try almost everything on the menu and my favorites are the chicken tikka masala (classic), chicken makhani and the wraps. The lunch specials are worth the price, very well served! Sunny and Tamina, if you see this, I miss working with you guys."}
{"text":"I really like this place. We had very good service. The waitress was friendly and helpful so we're the other employees.  I ordered the special beef dish can't think of the name now but it was a bit on the spicy side which I really don't mind. This dish came with naan bread and a delicious side salad oh and rice. They do not skimp on rice. And fyi if you order it as a side you will get the same amount as you would if it came with the special. I decided to upgrade the bread to spicy and that was pretty good too. If you are not into the spicy thing don't do it or even order the beef special I will edit the review later when I get the name of it. own The beef was so tender it just melted in my mouth. I was very pleased that I didn't have to chew meat for five hours or choke to death. Please try the tandoori shrimp appetizer it is the bomb.  the shrimp is very tasty and it seems grilled it has some char like it was. It lies on a bed of some grilled peppers and onions. You will receive a few sauces with your appetizers and they are very good.one is red one is green and the other is a pickled ginger kinda sauce. Each one has their own unique flavors. So it is totally up to your own taste buds. Oh my friend ordered the tiki masala dish and that was so good.  The chicken was cooked to perfection in the beautiful curry sauce. I think it's curry but if you eat Indian food you know what I am talking about. They say most of this food has been cooked in clay ovens. That is why it has an original old school flavor. I will tell you that I will be back. I want to try the wraps. We seen this lady across from us tearing up a wrap... and I am sold. More reviews to come."}
{"text":"Well I have to admit that I am not a fan of Indian food with my bad experiences I've had in the past. But those past memories started to go deeper and deeper away when I at here. Hence my 4 star review. It reality should be 4.5 stars but this is my first time here and I don't want to waste 5'stars on only one try if possible.  We came on a Sunday night about 9pm so a little late. There were still tables when we sat and I really liked the decor in the restaurant. We ordered and were greeted with great service and ordered Thi chili prawns and curry chicken. Both came out fast and hot. Very tasty.  I'm not a big fan of Indian food, but Tandoori was very good. That's a lot seeing Indian food is not my first choice when we go out to dinner. We will be back here!"}
{"text":"NEVER order UberEATS with this restaurant. They are unaware how to work the application. After waiting over an hour for our food to be picked up we called the restaurant, as well as, UberEATS helpline. Turns out they never hit the pick up button. The food arrived cold and chewy."}
{"text":"I love this place! Always delicious,  live belly dancing some nights,  and intimate setting in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"Tandoori-Times 2 is a restaurant that has reached a new low among Indian restaurants servicing the Phoenix area. I was there on Friday night last month to pick up lamb biryani that I'd ordered through phone. Having eaten some really good (and bad) biryanis across many states (CA, TX, IL, NC, FL etc.), I didn't expect great things here, especially after seeing the reviews on Yelp. But I still decided to give this place a benefit of doubt. And boy was I in for a rude surprise. The lamb biryani, as this place calls it, consisted of a few boiled lamb pieces thrown into rice that was already mixed with some gravy. It absolutely had no taste, flavor or at least the looks to pass of as biryani; it was simply distasteful.  I was so repulsed with what I got that I felt like going back and asking the cook which fool taught him to make biryani like this. This place rightly deserves all the negative feedback its been getting lately. I've advised all my colleagues and friends never to eat here."}
{"text":"We ordered chicken tikka, chicken tikka masala (chef hot), rice and naan bread (with potatoes) and everything tasted amazing. Portions were perfect for the price. Our server was really nice. Very satisfied with our first visit and definitely plan to return!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  Chicken tikkamasala was our favorite. They also offer a lunchtime buffet and happy hour options from 5-7."}
{"text":"So I have never eaten alot of Indian food, but friends of ours suggested dinner there so we went.  I am so glad I did! Talk about delish!  The Chicken Saag was one of the best things I have ever eaten.   Prices are reasonable, service is so-so and the food=yummo. We had chicken saag, chicken tikki masala, fish masala, garlic naan and rice.  The four of us left stuffed and happy.   It was so good, I went back the following week for lunch only to discover some terrific lunch specials.  8 bucks for more lunch then you can eat.  All I can say is \"GO\"."}
{"text":"Whether you have never tried Indian food or quite the connesuir this place will definitely be a delight for you.  Each time I have been here the food has been great and service has been on top of their game as well.  Prices are reasonable and can cater to large parties or even children.  It's located in a newer looking strip mall on Bell Rd near Arrowhead.  The \"chains\" are all around but this place stands out from some of those other meager places.  The inside is clean and nicely decorated in Indian decor as expected.  I will be back and think others should check the place out as well."}
{"text":"Lovely food, terrible service. Just entered for lunch as the second table of the day. Got water immediately from water guy. Waiter saw me and started cleaning trays behind counter. 5 mins later I made eye contact with him again and back to cleaning trays he went. 5 mins later I left with water guy giving me a 'sorry' look as I exited."}
{"text":"This place has amazing lunch specials!  Their patio is a perfect place to have lunch all winter long.  I have been there when they were slow and when they were busy and understaffed.  Their crystal ball was incorrect on the understaffed day but they weren't aware that 30 people were going to show up in a group."}
{"text":"This place is the only Indian place to go in this area. Great quality food, friendly service that goes the extra mile. We feel welcomed and valued when we eat here.  The garlic Naan is to die for. Don't miss the chicken tikka masala, and if you like it a little spicy, I recommend the beef vindaloo.  Rice is perfect and fluffy, exactly how it should be. Mango lassi is on point, and a great selection of both alcoholic and non alcoholic drinks available. I recommend the mojitos, too!  This isn't a budget place, but it IS the real deal. Don't miss this gem of a place.  I rarely give rave reviews, so when I do... you know it's good!!"}
{"text":"Whoa close the place already. We went there today it was such a big mistake we didn't see the price of buffet horrible buffet costed $15. It hurt it pinched oh god I'm disgusted by it. There were 2-3 horrible veggie items one dessert. We went thinking there will be lunch combos. Chettinaad has $11 buffet which is so much more worth what we ate today. I'm so disgusted. I wanted to give no stars. How dare they charge $15 for this buffet.  The problem is the flavors are not there, variety is not there. This was the shortest smallest buffet. We saw the price only when we reached the table with our plates filled, our bad. Phoenix Indian population is coming of age now. Restaurants can't put Indian painting and sell sub standard food. Food is the only thing that will bring people back again. Go checkout other buffets, chettinaad and mint indian. They have a huge buffet, you see and you will know what I mean. There has to be 2-3 appetizers, 2-3 types of rice, 2-3 desserts, and 4 curries in vegetarian and non-vegetarian each and then it costs $11. Indians for sure are not going to your place anymore. It was our mistake we landed there."}
{"text":"I called at 7:56 pm and the girl said 45 minutes for pick up. I've never heard of 45 mins for pick up but I ok was with it. I got here at 8:30 and the girl said it's gonna be another 10 mins. I sat and sat and sat...i am writing this review as I sit here waiting...it's 9:15 now...still waiting.   My food better be made out of gold."}
{"text":"Hands down the BEST Chicken Tikka in Phoenix! As good as a middle of the road restaurant in England - in other words WAY better than anywhere else I have found in the valley. Highly recommend you try it. Service was ok, tables etc are a bit downmarket, but not offensive."}
{"text":"This place is pretty damn good. Even though it was busy, we never had to ask for more to drink or pretty much anything. They got an extra star for the service. As for the food, it was pretty traditional. I didn't see anything on the menu that jumped out as a restaurant specialty. That's a shame because I'm always looking for new things to try. I ended up getting the Chicken Vindaloo. I would have preferred mine to be a bit more spicy but the waiter said that I can request extra spicy the next time."}
{"text":"I love going here on Friday nights because of the belly dancing! They always have a different dancer every time I'm here. If you want some entertainment while dining in, belly dancing starts at 7:30pm on Fridays and Saturdays. The music starts getting louder with the belly dancer in the house. In the evenings, they also light up candles at the table, eliciting this romantic vibe. I personally think it's best to dine inside because of the fragrant aroma of Indian spices, which is lacking if you choose to sit outside the patio area.    The food is always on point here. I enjoy all the curry dishes there. My top two favorite curries are the chicken tikka masala and methi chicken, consisting of rich flavors and spices.  You can't have curry without the naan. I love dipping the garlic naan into the curry. The biryani, a flavorful Indian rice dish, is undoubtedly worth a try. I had the prawns biryani, and everything was well-seasoned and tasty. A cooling yogurt sauce was provided with the dish. To top it off, complimentary chai tea is provided. I like to add some sugar to the tea as it changes it from bland to just right. My boyfriend requested chutney, a side dish with a hint of spice, to add to our meal.   Warning: the service is slow. It took awhile for us to receive our menus. Then, it took a little longer for the waitress to take our order. Finally, our food came out in 30 minutes even though it was not a full house. I would suggest that they provide some complimentary snacks, e.g. bread, while the guests are waiting. I have ordered togo before, and they're super efficient at getting my order ready. I would call in my order, and the food would be done in 30 minutes for pick-up. If you're in a rush, I suggest ordering take-out.   Overall, the portions are not big enough for the price. Four stars for the delicious food, and two stars for the service while dining in. Average of 3 stars."}
{"text":"Better than we expected.  We stopped in fairly late on Tuesday night and it was still quite busy.  There were three of us and we ordered the lamb vindaloo, a lamb special, sag paneer and naan.   We requested them \"chef spicy,\" which our charming waitress informed us was as hot as it gets.  We were delighted to discover that this was actually quite spicy.  Both lamb dishes were excellent.  The naan was fresh and hot from the oven.  My only quibble was with the saag paneer which was heavy on the saag and light on the paneer, but still pretty good.  It's a bit pricey for a neighborhood Indian joint - about $60 for the three of us with one beer, but it's also a bit nicer than the typical Indian restaurant.   Service was friendly and efficient.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"The bad. No samosas during the week, why? The lamb chops, which our server recommended, were crap. The tiny quarter sized piece of meat was oh-so-good but they were full of fat and bones, so it was about $12  for 5 bites of lamb and a plate of bones.   The good. Nicely styled restaurant, bright colors and modern open layout. The appetizer we ordered was a veggie patty on a bed of spicy chickpeas. The lamb vindaloos was one of the best I've had. The garlic naan was perfect.  Complementary chai is available, I thought is was a bit week but good none the less.  PS: No belly dancers here on a Wed evening. Maybe they have them here on the weekends like they do in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I came here with my Mom and sister. I ordered the aloo gobi, and it was amazing! The food was very flavorful and the service was amazing. The price was also very reasonable as my meal cost only about 10 dollars. My family and I had an awesome experience at this restaurant. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Bland, overpriced and small portions that make sharing family style even more costly.  The serving staff here couldn't satisfy the rats in Karni Mata Temple they are so disconnected from their customers. Ask about a dish and get a bland, uninspired description. Want a refill, good luck getting your server's attention. Manage to catch one of the other servers, he walks off because you're not in his section.  Considering our party was one of three tables in the place, there's no excuse for rude, crappy service.   A plus is the naan. It was delicious and I'd come back for that. As take out only.  Conclusion - Phoenix has a plethora of average, run of the mill Indian restaurants and this place blends into the crowd. With bad service and an attitude that you, as the customer, don't matter - do yourself and this restaurant a favor and take your money somewhere else.  TIP: If you're in the area and open to new things, try the French restaurant next door. Great service and good food. Now I understand why I watched person after person go in there and not Tandoori Times 2."}
{"text":"I just got around to writing this review. The food is best Indian food in town. BUT The woman who works here at night has no customer service skills and not friendly ever, whether I am taking food to go. Or in person, she is not helpful. I don't want her as server. Everybody else is great. just so happens I seen her never smile or nice to other patrons as well. If I'm eating food sit down and want to also place to go order, or in need of anything (chutney, ect) she acts annoyed. She doesn't like to answer a question if you wonder what a dish is, to try something new. I love the food but I would not want service like this with friends/family- so I will only do that at Scottsdale location. I think her name Tamitha. (whom I believe is who other reviewers are talking about, e.g. review under mine) You can definitely lose business due to this some people wouldn't come back at all. But my friends and myself love the food. so I go to scottsdale location. **Sigh** not so much this location anymore makes me sad."}
{"text":"I have been in this neighborhood for a week from Calif, could'nt find a good independent place to eat untill i drove past this indian bistro. It is similar to chaat cafe in fremont ca. Very pleasant interior, food was great. Crew seemed very disorganized and inexperienced. Need basic customer service training. Customers were waiting for a long time before some one seated them,One almost spilled water on me.One hand did not know what the other was doing. I still will recommend this place. Just bear the inexperienced crew in the dining area, I will visit this place again"}
{"text":"We've been here a few times now and every time has been great. Last night we had the chicken tikki masala and chicken makhani with rice and naan. We finished that off and ordered the dessert sampler which was a great way to experience their desserts. Service was great and if I could eat only one dish the rest of my life, it might just be their makhani."}
{"text":"The ambience was absolutely amazing, the servers make you feel welcome and we enjoyed the food. Everything was full of flavor as well as the rice. We were blessed to see a belly dancer and danced around during dinner. We ate the methi chicken, and the lamb valadoo. Everything with full of flavor and the best meal I have had in a long time. Will Definitely come here again on This side of town!"}
{"text":"I dined here for the very first time last night, so I can not comment on the consistency of the food or service, just my one time experience.  We were immediately greeted and seated when we arrived, and when the gentlemen found out that we had not been there before he told us all about the weekend experience with the belly dancing, and hookah. He also told us to make reservations for the weekends, cause they do get very busy.  Our Waiter was very nice, and offered up some great suggestions for noobs like us (this was only my 2nd time eating Indian food). We ended up ordering the Chicken Tikki Masala, and the Coconut chicken w/ rice. The food arrived reasonably quickly, and neither dish was runny at all like other reviews point out. Everything was hot, and delicious, and there was enough left over for probably 1 meal. It did take awhile for our server to get our check to us, but he was very aware cause when he brought our check he also brought some complimentary ice cream as an apology and a thank you for our patience.  Over all I had a great experience at this restaurant and wish it hadn't taken us so long to try. We will be back."}
{"text":"I'm a bit surprised by the cost of the naan and the main dishes, 13.95 for curry dish that does not come with rice. 3.25 for the naan. The curry is delicious but I have to save for a year just to come back. Love the perfect spices in the dishes."}
{"text":"This place is back after having faded for a while. We hadn't visited in a while because recipes had changed and not for the better. The current recipes are still a bit different than many years ago, but this time the quality rivaled its former glory.  Samosa appetizers may be pricier than other places but you also get garbanzo salad and pico de gallo with it. Portions are not too big or small for one person. Standard \"medium\" spicy level for entrees is hardly spicy at all, but you can easily add your bam! if that's what you like. Great vegetarian options! We tried the paneer and the veggie korma at was all very tasty. Naan and rice are very well prepared. Servers hustled and had good attitudes, but service was a little slow: they seemed understaffed for a Friday with large parties and a full house for dinner. Finally, they still have a talented belly dancer on weekends, which is fun. We will start coming here again."}
{"text":"I have been to this place for almost 5 years now, at least once a month. Their foods have never disappointed me. The line can be long on a certain Saturday depending on the rush hours but in general, you will be seated within 20 minute maximum wait -- average wait is immediately to 5 minutes. Order any of the dishes. Chai tea is refillable. I would definitely come back every month like usual as long as they keep the quality of food they way it is."}
{"text":"So we discovered this place while we were in the area getting some fine liquor from bevmo. We did a take-out, not bad at all. Food was very delicious, we ordered soy a substitute for meat. It tasted better then dead bird(chicken), highly recommend if you want good protein and not want to eat meat all the time. They have many variety of soy dishes, and each soy cooked item is quite similar to chicken tender shape and size, so yeah fills you up well & leaving behind a better taste."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the food here, everything is cooked and seasoned to perfection. The service is sometimes a little slow, but I go for dinner and don't mind since the food is so delicious. The naan is so good, and the tandoori wraps are amazing."}
{"text":"Great food! It's a break away from the usual flavors of the typical American diet. You'll love this place. Try the veggie byriani rice instead of just plain white rice to add some extra spice"}
{"text":"I love this place. Best Indian food around here. And the most awesome free chai ever!  My favorites here are the mango lassi, the garlic naan and the chicken makhani! And I pretty much order the same thing every single time! But at times when I'm feeling adventurous, I go for the Goan fish curry (probably the only time I'll touch fish in non-sushi form) or the chicken biryani!  They have a big menu to choose from and the food is as authentic as it gets. They do tone the spice levels down quite a bit though - which might be a good or bad thing depending on how spicy you like your food to be :-)  I love this place and take all my non-Indian friends here whenever they crave Indian food! I'd vouch for it's awesomeness any day!"}
{"text":"Due to the terrible service we experienced, I should give this place 1 star but the food was delicious so I'm giving it 2 stars.  Four of us went here on our lunch break.  Note to self and others, do not go to this place if you are pressed for time!!  Our waitress had no idea what she was doing and messed up 2 of the 4 orders at our table.  We were never offered anything to drink besides water and had to ask several time for plates once our food arrived.  And trying to separate our payment was simply too much for her to handle.  I will say my chicken tikka masala was absolutely delicious and is one of the best I have had in Arizona.  They do charge extra for rice, which I find odd.  The best part of ordering Indian food is pouring the sauce over rice.  The naan was excellent too!  The terrible service and extremely long wait time for our food as well as our check was unacceptable, so I don't see us going back."}
{"text":"Oddly enough, ended up here again today - with different people. The weekday lunch was very different from the weekend lunch.   For each week day there are several (10? maybe) different entrees and their price depends on the meat/vegetarian vegetarian is $8.95, I think and then the meat/seafood dishes run up to $13 or so. (Yeah, I should have taken notes.) The bad part is that unless you know what is in a dish, there is no hint until you look at the regular menu to figure out what kind of meat or the price or what it is. For instance, if you don't know that saag paneer is vegetarian and is cottage cheese/cheese spinach dish, it would take you a while. Some were easier to figure out than others. So, we ordered a chicken dish, lamb dish and saag paneer. If you are a regular or eat a lot of Indian food, I'm sure it is a snap, but it was rather bewildering to us. The waitress was helpful, but it could be easier to \"translate\".  The lunches on that menu all come with a big piece of naan, salad (with a lot of onion) and a very good side of rice that was fixed up - okay, I definitely should have taken notes. The entrees were pretty good - not great, but better than perfectly fine at the price point. They are a little small, BUT with everything else perfectly adequate. The naan was TERRIFIC - really. I gave half of mine away, but because I just can't justify the calories - it was yummy though.  Salad could use fewer onions and maybe a touch less dressing, but okay. Rice was pretty good.   Weekday lunch is a great value! If I don't go back soon, it is because of watching what I eat, not because I don't want to.   Would consider giving it a higher rating, but I'm not at five stars with this restaurant, even with the great weekday lunch value. Service is fine and efficient.   Oh, and I hate the way the chairs scrape on the hard floor."}
{"text":"One liner: Great/Delicious Indian food w/ good happy hour specials but could improve on service.   I am not quite sure I agree with the restaurant's color scheme for its name/logo but the food is great!  I really love Indian food and eating at this restaurant was definitely a treat for that reason. They have \"Happy Times\" or a happy hour menu. We started off with a King Fisher 22 oz ($1 off at happy hour) and a mango lassi with a shot of vodka. I'd recommend both the beer and the mixed drink.    For appetizers,  we decided to get the Chicken Naan and the Spicy Chicken wings... both were freaking delicious. It looks like they used tandoori chicken to stuff the naan with and so it was scrumptious.   They served it with a mint green chutney.. then there was also some red chutney and pickled veggies of some sort.. I don't know why but they gave us two different condiment sets and one of the mint chutneys tasted like it had a bit more salt and ginger than the first... the server said they came from the same batch so I'm not sure.   We also ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala. It was really creamy and perfect for dipping naan in. I really didn't expect to find such good Indian food in AZ.  The other entree that we ordered was Chicken Tandoori... yeah probably too much Tandoori.. I didn't know at the time that I ordered but the spicy chicken wings is pretty much the same thing as the tandoori chicken.. but the tandoori chicken may have had a heavier coating of spices. I kind of wish the waiter would have offered his opinion that we had ordered very similar dishes and recommended something else but it is okay. All of tandoori style items were good.  They get 4 stars instead of 5 because I definitely believe the service could have been better. They seemed to only be really attentive at the start and then if there were any issues. I don't know if they were understaffed b/c it seemed like there was a waiter/manager, waitress, and then a bus-lady. My friend was definitely dying for some water during parts of the meals - she doesn't handle spicy too well. =P  Last and probably least... they also have a self-serve complimentary chai tea... i had the chai tea just from the pot and it was basically like warm milk with a tiny bit of cinnamon. My friend added some sugar to it and it turned okay/good.   Entrees average about $10-$13. Naan ranges from about $1.50-$3. Appetizers during happy hour range from $3-$8+. Add in alcohol and you're looking at a not inexpensive meal but definitely good quality."}
{"text":"Summary: Without claiming to be the Arizona's foremost expert on Indian cuisine or, in fact, even knowing what the hell I'm talking about; this is my favorite Indian food restaurant. The rice is never sticky, the naan is always perfectly toasted and sacrilegiously tossing chicken tikka masala atop the two of 'em completes an excellent naan taco. This review is pretty much giving that combination of items along with the chicken tikka wrap 5 stars. I certainly can't vouch for the whole menu.  Pricing: The $6.95(?) chicken tikka wrap on the lunch menu is delicious. Lunch service is prompt. Dinner prices and portions are average. Indian food seems to always be in the $$ range minimum.  Concerns: If you're thinking about coming here on a Friday or Saturday, you may want to consider calling ahead to find out if you're going to be subjected to Shiva's meal tarnishing minions, the belly dancers, along with the accompanying 100dB Indian techno soundtrack. It only happened to me once and, thank Vishnu, I was signing the bill at the time."}
{"text":"Very good food. I had the Tandoori chicken. It was perfectly cooked. The garlic naan and sauces were great. Only complaint was they did not clear dishes when we were done eating."}
{"text":"I'm giving them an extra star for their lunch specials which is an incredible value for the amount of food that you get.   This is my favorite Indian restaurant in the area. It's right next to school! Favorites include Achari lamb...Mmm so flavorful with no hint of gaminess, and the lunch portion will feed you for several meals. I've also had the chicken tikka masala which was good and chicken biryani which came with a HUGE side of raita, yay! Biryani is the food of my people (Bengalis) so I am very picky when it comes to it. I'd say TT2s biryani satisfies my cravings. I also love to end my meal with their complimentary chai. Watered down some days, good other days.   Didn't care for the chicken tikka wrap lunch special, thought it was too dry. Their naan is too doughy for my liking; I prefer mine light and a little crispy. Other than that I have no complaints thus far.   Their decor is nice, and their dinner prices are pretty standard for a nice Indian restaurant. Their red meat is halal too! Definitely will be frequenting this place!"}
{"text":"Disappointed with the food & the service, staff were unpleasant after making us wait for an hour. Was a forgettable experience, I would never like to visit Tandoori times again."}
{"text":"My wife and I recently moved to Glendale and hit the jackpot of Indian food here! We were not expecting to find an Indian food place as good as where we came from, but Tandoori topped it! It is reasonably priced, the staff are very attentive and friendly, and everything made tastes fresh. If you like Indian food, I would absolutely recommend Tandoori Times 2!"}
{"text":"So I went there today for dinner with a friend. I ordered lamb korma which was just ok nothing so special about it. My buddy ordered their chicken sekh kabobs which were literally tasteless, I mean seriously no TASTE, seemed like chef completely forgot to add any spices to the meat before cooking it.   I have been to this restaurant many many times but today's visit was very disappointing and total waste. I am definitely think twice before going back."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good Indian food in the middle of the desert!  We went with a group and while the service was a tad slow for an empty restaurant, the portions and flavors did not disappoint.  The location is a bit hidden in a strip mall, but don't let that deter you.  I personally enjoyed the variety of the naan they offered and will be back."}
{"text":"I've been here twice already. Dining area is very clean and bright. Food was solid, but wouldn't say it's spectacular. Out of all the dishes I've had here so far, I would say Malai Kofta is my favorite. Being that there aren't too many Indians on this side of town, I didn't really come in with really high expectations anyways. However, if you're comparing this to restaurants in areas densely populated with Indians (like where I'm originally from in NJ) this is about a notch below that. I would give this a 3.5 stars, but since the prices are fair (especially the lunch specials), portion sizes are quite large, and the chai is free, I'd bump this up half a star."}
{"text":"One of my favorite place, love the Chicken tikka masala dish. I highly recommend to try the great food."}
{"text":"Decent Indian food. Fast (though a bit... efficient?) service. A dancer came in during peak times on a Friday.  Prices and variety are decent. It's pretty good but I probably would not travel very far for Tandoori times. If you are in the area, go for it."}
{"text":"I love love love chicken tikka masala, rice and garlic naan.  I normally go there once a week to eat there.  Tandoori Times and Tandoori Times 2 are probably most the same places.  The services are wonderful.  They know exactly what I want to order.  I could say that this Tandoori Time has the BEST chicken tikka masala than any other Indian restaurant.  you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Tandoori would have gotten 5 stars if the air would have been at a decent temperature!!! Also service was good but slow so the warm temperature made it seem slower"}
{"text":"I rate this place a 3.5. My wife and I eat here often because we love the food, particularly their lamb dishes. The lamb kebabs are terrific and the lamb tikka masala is one of the tastiest dishes I've had anywhere. They make great naan (the chile and potato varieties are the real standouts). The onion bhaji is also a must.  A word of caution: Stay away Friday and Saturday nights if you don't like belly dancing. Having some proto-stripper clang loud-@$$ zills (finger symbols) in my ear while I try to eat does nothing for me...nothing good at least. Also, belly dancing is of Mid-Eastern origin so I have no idea why it would be featured at an Indian Restaurant. If I wanted to watch a stripper, I'd prefer to do so the old fashioned way. At a club of ill repute, in the dark, where the staff and I can both veil our combined sense humiliation and degradation. Also be on the lookout for the owner. Be prepared for endless conversation if he's there and drinking.  I'll will be returning to Tandoori Times often, but I'll be hiding out, averting my eyes and leaving my handful of singles at home!"}
{"text":"10 minutes... nobody acknowledges I'm here.  It's 1:45 and the restaurant isn't that busy, 2 servers, both of which pass me several times, and no greeting... no menu... no water... just flat out ignored.  Other patrons started to notice I was being ignored, even after hand gestures to get attention.  When the server's casual conversation started with the adjacent table I had to get up and just leave.  Unbelievable."}
{"text":"We were recommended to go there for my birthday. We ordered the tandoori wings which were good. We also ordered chicken tika masala with garlic naan. I did not enjoy either. The tika masala had a very sweet taste to it almost like a squash flavor and it didn't have that signature orange redish color. It tasted nothing like the tika masalas I've had in NY and here in AZ. The chicken itself was lacking flavor. The naan tasted very bland and not as pillowy as I'd like. The waitress was quick with us and didn't have patience for us to decide what to drink. I would not recommend it here, rather go back to Marigold Maison."}
{"text":"I'm surprised at the sub-4 star here. This is not just super rich food it's also well made and fresh. You can tell because the flavors change a little each time you go. They are using the goods most available. Also they don't use too much oil in their food. Not much at all. They use their meat and veggies to get their flavor and nut purée to add creaminess vs dairy.   Service is outstanding.   I'm almost all the way through their veggie dishes and have had all their naan. I've been to a lot of Indian restaurants in CA and in the northern Midwest and this place probably takes more care of their cuisine than anywhere I've been. Nothing to subtract. I'll be here every week.   Thanks Tamina!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing Indian food!!! Funny to me how the surrounding chain restaurants, burger and fast food joints on Bell Road are so darn busy while this place sits quiet and unassuming, tucked away just between 55th and 57th avenues north of Bell Rd. I am no Hemingway so I can't elaborate on just how delicious, fresh and authentic their food really is. My only suggestion is to eat here. If you're not familiar with Indian food, they'll be more than happy to explain their dishes, as they did for my 15yo son. Great lunch specials and spectacular service!"}
{"text":"Tried out this place on Father's Day , food was wonderful, service great!! Enjoyed very much. Neha was great waitress."}
{"text":"Great happy hour food selection. Service was a bit slow but they were busy and my waitress was super nice. I liked what I ordered, Naan, Indian salad, and a potato knish type of food with peas.  I am not sure I would come back here if it was not happy hour. The prices are high. I enjoyed talking to the belly dancer, who is also a teacher. The fire dance was pretty amazing."}
{"text":"I love their food but I'm only giving 3 stars because of the poor service we received today.  Our table was ignored for much of the meal.  It took forever to get our order taken, and then when the food finally came out one of the meals was missing and the server was completely unapologetic.  We waited for the last meal to come out and we saw it sitting under the heat lamps while the server was at the cash register doing something else.  Finally one of us got up, walked over to her, and asked if that was his food.  It was his food, and again, she was completely unapologetic.  If I could have tipped less, I would have, but unfortunately gratuity was already added because we had 8 people."}
