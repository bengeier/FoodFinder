{"text":"This is our go-to take out spot around the corner from our house. Vermicelli and Pad Thai are our usuals, but last week we got adventurous and rolled our own rice paper rolls. It was actually pretty fun/funny and tasted great!
Good food, fast, and priced right! It's great!"}
{"text":"One of the best pho places you can find!  Not only is the pho good but the amount of meat you get, is just unbelievable.  Maybe the chef was in a good mood and put a little more for me this morning... not complaining at all.  

Service was great as well.  Food came out fast and hot.  And the best part is... a large size pho is only $6.50!!!  This price brings me back to the early 2000's.  You can't find this price anywhere anymore.   Most places are at least $8.50+... and the size of a large here will be a X- large everywhere else.  The amount of meat you get in a large here is equivalent to 3 other bowls in most places.   

I didn't get a chance to try anything else here this morning.  But am pretty sure this place will get other items right.

Will i come back... definitely.  It is pretty far for me but anytime im in sauga area again, i will hit this place up."}
{"text":"I live near there and not only is it convenient but it's also a very nice restaurant! The staff is nice and friendly, their food is great too! I am Vietnamese and I find their pork chops to be very good! It is nicely seasoned and very delicious. Their pho is also good most of the time but sometimes the beef can be a little too chewy. 

Also, all the Vietnamese restaurants I've tried are all more expensive so this place has pretty good prices. They did renovate recently and I definitely like the new look better! They also have free wifi which is very useful.

This place also has a large variety of different food items on the menu, Vietnamese, Thai and Chinese. Mostly Vietnamese though. I also love their different fruit shakes, like the mango, avacado or strawberry. They also have some traditional Vietnamese desserts that are very nice and refreshing.

I definitely reccomend this restaurant for any pho or Vietnamese food lovers or anyone wanting to try some authentic Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"Really wish this place was better since I live nearby, but their pho is so watery and bland it's a shame.  Meat was over cooked and really hard to chew.  It is amazing that they even got that wrong.  It looks like business is not doing so great here so to save money they sacrifice good quality food, which in turn loses more customers and more cost cutting.  Tried it a few times since it's so close and really gave it a chance, but it's pretty awful."}
{"text":"Horrible Thai place, ordered mango salad & stir fried chicken with rice. Chicken tasted stale. They even charged me for the food that wasn't consumable.

Tried this place based on the reviews but looks like they are staged too."}
{"text":"This is one of my al time favourite pho spots! I get the vegetarian pho, no tofu and no baby carrots (never took to them), and the mango salad is a must! The staff here is always so friendly, happy to see you and the service is quick!!"}
{"text":"Service is excellent. Food is fantastic and authentic. Beef soup is excellent because the broth is well done. Fresh rolls are amazing.  Staff always very friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"A good neighborhood spot. I was hesitant to visit given its location in a seedy strip mall, and the 3-star Yelp review, but I was pleasantly surprised. 

I got a large rare beef noodle soup to go ($7.50+tax). The broth was the standard size, but the noodle and beef quantities were bigger than I expected. The pho was just as good as at all of the either pho joints I've tried in the area. While the ambience is certainly lacking, this is a good place to get some takeout. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"You know you have a gem on your hands when your friends from Scarborough rave about this place. Thank goodness I live 5 minutes away, because this place is my favorite pho restaurant in Mississauga. 

Firstly the staff are very warm, friendly, attentive, and always smile. 

The pho/menu entrees are just so delicious. They are not stingy with the amount of food you're given. They make sure you'll be well fed. They have a little bit of a secret menu too and can do special requests. For example I always order rare beef and beef balls pho and instead of a side of sprouts I have my pho with red cabbage. Not only does it give the soup a nice array of colour but it still gives it a nice texture with the noodles. A must try. 
Another is their chicken wings. Oh my. Just so good. You can have them non spicy, or spicy but the dry rub they put on it is next level. I can't put my fingers on it but it can get very addictive. Only drawback from the chicken wings is if you don't tell them to cook them crispy they sometimes will and sometimes won't so it's hit or miss, so make sure to mention how you want them done. 

They recently renovated, and got new furniture/menus which is a plus for them because now it actually looks very nice and has that ambiance they were lacking before. 

All in all it comes highly recommended, and I'm sure you won't be disappointed. You've got a returning customer for life."}
{"text":"New management, different cook. We used to dine here but in our last visit the meat in my pho and my wife's rice combo dish tasted funny. Someday we will try again if they change their ways"}
{"text":"One of the best pho spots I've been to! Very generous portions especially with their pho bowls. They do not skimp on the vegetables or meat like other places I've been to so I'm definitely a fan."}
{"text":"This is my go to pho spot for years. Always great service and delicious food. Their rice dishes, vermicelli dishes and of course pho and fruit shakes are some of my personal faves. Prices are excellent, cheaper by at least $1 in comparable to many other pho restaurants."}
{"text":"Tried this place and was pleasantly surprised !
Service was good And prompt and they were able to answer my questions with no hesitations ! 
I got curry chicken and it was decent and I tried the pork chop and thought it was tasty ! 
I'll definitely be back and give some pho a try next time ! Oh prices are fantastic !!"}
{"text":"Pho Mi Binh Minh is located in Mississauga in the No Frills plaza and is my absolute favourite place. It's very authentic there. It's owned by a Vietnamese family.  The service is great, very friendly.  I've been here many times and always order their spring rolls which has taro in it, so good and their fresh shrimp rolls as appetizers. My daughters always get the pho beef balls noodle soup. I always in the past got the pork chop on rice or the vermicelli noodle bowl with bbq beef. I've also had their dinner for 2.  Which comes with the sweet and sour shrimp soup with the soya sauce fish in a stone pot with a bowl of rice. Amazing!! This time around I had the bun bo hue.  It's the spicy beef soup.  It's comes with pigs blood and pig feet but I forgo all that and got rare beef slices instead. All the items on their menu are amazing you can't go wrong. Highly recommend this place. Price is very reasonable and big portions!"}
{"text":"Decent Vietnamese food and service. Food tastes okay but does need some improvement due to the lack of consistency in quality. Same dish taste differently each time you order. If you're hungry, it is a place for quick meal and take out."}
{"text":"Not the best pho that my partner and I've had, but the vermicelli bowls were really good, as were the fresh roll wraps (shrimp and grilled pork). Plus service was friendly and quick! 
And they have wifi! 
We will be back for those vermicelli bowls and to try out other things on their menu!"}
{"text":"I've had their pho a few times when my mom orders take out from Pho Mi Binh Minh. However, last weekend we actually went there for dinner. We were the first ones there but it picked up in less than 10 minutes. 

The restaurant lost a star because the interior decor is lacking and the TV volume was pretty loud...some random movie on AMC was playing.

Me and my sister both ordered the bun bo hue. You can tell them if you want it mild or spicy, which is great for non-spicy eaters like me! The broth was great and it was mild just as I wanted it. My dad got the crispy noodle basket with seafood and it tasted great!

Pho Mi Binh Minh's food is awesome...from what I've tried so far (including their pho)! The downside is that it's not close to my house."}
