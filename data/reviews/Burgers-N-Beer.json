{"text":"I enjoy their sliders and my husband likes their stuffed burgers. A basket of fries is enough for two to share. We enjoy the fries with malt vinegar. The owners, Mr and Mrs C, are great hosts and often check-in to ensure that everything is okay.   The food comes out quick. The only complaint is that the space is tight, the tables are a little close together and the chairs aren't comfortable."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've ever had. Definitely a standard favorite. Also try the buffalo blue cheese fries."}
{"text":"Service very disorganized, waited 20 minutes to be seated. Left when wait staff continued to walk by without saying a word."}
{"text":"Not a fan of this place. Out of all the food options in DTW this one is my least favorite. Last time we stopped in for a beer and food the bar was over crowded so we got sat at a table. The waitress acted like everything was a joke and was a smart ass bitch to us. Food sucks and the service sucks"}
{"text":"Stopped in early at 5 pm on a Thursday for our first visit.  Had a surprisingly good crowd already and a good vibe.  We ordered the wings, which were delicious and definitely \"jumbo\" sized like the menu said.  We decided to grab a burger as well and it was cooked perfectly ... nice and juicy.  Fries were great, too!  Our server was always arriving at just the right time, so all around great experience.

Adding to our list of \"go-to\" burger spots!"}
{"text":"Long wait, burger way overcooked. Ordered medium and it was well done. the waitress was polite but seemed annoyed that I was in a rush. I didn't have time to wait for them to cook a new one and to their credit they didn't charge me for my soda though I offered to pay for that at least. If burgers is part of your name and you can't get it right, that's not a good sign. There are way better options in the area."}
{"text":"Sadly, this wonderful restaurant  changed one of the reasons we go there.  They no longer have the French fries that were the best.  They changed to a steak fry. Disappointing.  I won't go back after being a frequent customer for 15 years."}
{"text":"Burgers N Beer has become THE place that we take people when they visit Willoughby.  The food is tasty and inexpensive - the perfect combination for a night out.  It features a full bar and stocks Christmas Ale during the holidays.  The burgers are great, as are the wings and ribs, and one serving of fries could feed an army.

Every time I've gone to Burger N Beer, the owner has been there, chatting with patrons, and not in a cheesy restaurant manager way.  He truly cares about his customers and making sure they're satisfied with his establishment.  Sometimes the service can be slow, but for the most part, Burgers N Beer is spot-on for fun, fabulous food."}
{"text":"One of their specialties is their ribs. Very dissapointed. Ribs tasted like they were fixed a week prior, heated in a microwave with some sauce. My husband had a burger and said it was not the best. The house salad tasted like they had just poured it from a bag. Service was okay. This place has gone downhill."}
{"text":"Terrible experience twice in a row. 
First time my family and I were sat, I had to physically get up to find a server. Then our server and another one were arguing over rolling silverware and complaining about another server. 

Second time, ordered spinach artichoke dip. Our server, who was nice, told us their delivery truck ran late and the dip is in a box in the basement; she can see if someone can go and get it if I really want it or I can chose something different. We left and had fresh dip at Willoughby brewing co.  

Never again will I go to burgers n beer. No wonder they always have groupons for here."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast on a Sunday morning. It was moderately busy, but there were still plenty of tables open.  We were seated immediately and we promptly put in our orders for eggs and coffee.  Our waitress brought 2 large mugs of pretty bad tasting weak coffee and then, no exaggerating, we never saw her again.  Others got seated near us by other servers, but our server had vanished.  

Also, do these servers have some kind of a rule that they can only refill coffee at their own tables?  This one server filled up the people next to us and behind us but completely skipped us and another table that didn't belong to her.  I'm sorry, but if you are carrying a full pot of coffee you could refill everybody's cup.  

Anyway back to breakfast.  It never came.  We waited over 50 minutes and got nothing.  I might not have cared too much if our waitress had returned, warmed up our coffee, or just given us an occasional status update, but like I stated, she vanished.  
Also, I want everyone to know that they were not short staffed in the dining room. There is no excuse for the horrible service we got. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Friday, August 2, 2013, 1:15-lunch... Waited for 22 minutes for 2 lunches, gorgonzola burger not properly cooked, cold red meat on the inside was what I got but according to the waitress that's what medium done looks like... Wound up just eating my onion slices on the burger bread for my lunch. Other lunch of chicken strips were all cut into as if the cook perhaps wasn't sure as to whether or not they were done... Our ice teas sat empty... No refills that day, waited almost 15 minutes for our check and the waitress didn't come with it until we were standing at the door. Last but not least... That was the RUDEST, NASTIEST waitress ever!! 
We will not ever go back and would never recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times and I have not been impressed. The service has been below average. Both times we were rushed to a seat without any form of greeting, the waitress gave the impression that she didn't want to be there, our orders came out completely wrong, and we didn't get offered any refills. The food is okay, but the experience is not worth the time or money."}
{"text":"I went here for breakfast with some of my coworkers.  We had a great time!  It's a cozy little place in DTW.  I got french toast which was delicious.  The eggs and sausage I got were also really good.  The eggs were a bit bland, but nothing a little salt and pepper couldn't fix.  (Another minor disappointment -- they were out of mamosas!)  I wasn't blown away, but the people were really nice and the food was better than I was expecting.  They got a little flustered when we went to pay (because there were so many of us and some people were trying to pay for others, etc.) but overall a great experience.  The staff was patient and even amused with our rowdiness and I thought they were really accommodating.  Happy to find this place!

NOTE: I am pretty sure I reviewed the right place... I think this place is also known as Burgers, Beers & Breakfast, but when I looked it up under that name on here the address was slightly different.  So I just reviewed the place with the correct address.  If I'm wrong somebody let me know and I'll just copy/paste this little review under the correct establishment.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"This is a great little place for a lunch or casual dinner. We were looking for a bite too eat for a late lunch last weekend and decided to stop in. I love the decor inside - lots of cool posters and knick-knacks. I ordered a Magic Hat and the Bruschetta Burger, which was very yummy. They serve their burgers on a toasted garlic baguette-type bread instead of rolls which is even better. B ordered the Poblano Burger which looked equally as good and it was gone within 5-10 minutes - a testament to how good it was. We shared the mixed fry basket which included their regular curly fries and sweet-potato fries - both very crispy and delicious. The burgers were both cooked very well to our desired \"doneness\" and the toasted bread was a great departure from the typical hamburger bun. 
The servers are friendly. Ours was, at times, a little slow. When the bf went to help her carry our empty baskets back to the bar because she had full hands, she frantically told him not to because she said it could get her fired so that was a little awkward but I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"The rudest, disorganized, dirty place I have ever had the displeasure of visiting.  If you do not mind being treated like a piece of #%&P!!! and are o.k. with unremarkable food this would be the place to go."}
{"text":"Amazing. I love the atmosphere. The staff and owners are great. The burgers are actually cooked to the right temperature and not based on color which is fantastic. An excellent go-to place with big groups or out-of-town guests. Also, surprisingly my friend with Celiac's disease goes here often and orders the hamby with no bun and has never had cross contamination from it, he says it's truly the only burger place he knows where if you say \"no bun\" the burger never comes into contact with bread."}
{"text":"My new favorite restaurant in Willoughby. I had the Muffaletta burger, being from the south I missed my southern food.  I was not disappointed."}
{"text":"The go-to burger joint in Downtown Willoughby!  

B-N-B is always hopping; a great place for lunch or a casual dinner.  The juicy burgers are served on tasty Texas toast, fries come in ginormous helpings, and you can't beat Mimi's famous ribs.  Service is fast and polite and on weekends a convenient valet service is offered at the door.  Burgers has a nice selection of beer and awesome happy hour deals.  

And trust me, nothing compares to B-N-B Chicken Tortilla Soup on a crisp fall afternoon."}
{"text":"Stopped in last night somewhat accidentally.  We were looking for the Willoughby Brewing Co, but I think the gps was confused because it led us here instead.  We didn't really care so we went in anyway.  The place is small and divey for sure.  I kept getting whiffs of smoke blowing in through the back door, which was unpleasant.  The menu is pretty limited, even for bar food.  My husband is a burger lover, so he was totally pleased, but don't expect many options if you aren't.  They have other sandwiches, some appetizers (mostly deep fried), and a couple salads.  I had a salad and chili combo ($8).  The chili was acceptable, but I wouldn't call it good.  The salad had way too much cheese on it for my liking.  My husband had some kind of cheese stuffed burger ($9), which was huge and served on some kind of garlic bread.  He seemed to enjoy it.  The fries must be ordered separately ($4), but it's a large enough portion to share.  

If everyone in your party wants to eat burgers and fries, you shouldn't have a problem with this place.  I do think the prices are a little high for the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Meh. There was nothing really special here. We got some breaded mushrooms to start and those were mushy little grease bombs. The burger I got was incredibly overcooked and lacking in flavor. 

What I witnessed among the staff and customers was a little offputting and made me uncomfortable. Some of the staff were joking around with each other and getting pretty physical in the packed bar for all to see (goosing each other and making inappropriate comments) and some of the same was happening among some regular customers and staff. My food wasn't very good to begin with and this didn't help at all. When I saw the lack of professionalism among the staff, I began to wonder about the kitchen and what horrors happened there."}
{"text":"Ths place iz crackin....tht why I like hole in the wall places....they knw how to do it. Burgers and brewz iz hella good.. hella cold in the winter time tho"}
{"text":"So, wanna know one thing that is truly underrated in my book? 

BAR FOOD. 

Fries, burgers, good sandwiches and a nice selection of alcoholic beverages to back them up and wash them down. An experience today, that happened BY ACCIDENT, helped us find a new spot for just that. 

Truth be told, my wife and I weren't even going to stop in. We had coupons for a place we heard of and were all excited to try...which, we discovered later, had closed some time before and was now a realtor's office...

Blast it all. BUT...

We did the eeny-meeny-miney-mo, and headed for Burgers, Beer, and Breakfast on Erie Street. 

The place is warm, homey, and BUSY. Also, just a suggestion, when you step through the swinging doors in the front, watch out! They bite. 

The staff, however, and thankfully, did NOT. We were seated fast and shown a menu with a lot of variety. Now, despite the well-maintained bar, we didn't get any libations, but there were, as far as I could see,  plenty of drinkable selections of all types. 

Instead, I got a really fine pulled pork sandwich, served on half a loaf of garlic bread no less, and a side of really great onion rings. My wife got the fish tacos, which were crispy and flavorful. When we were done, we were full and happy...which was good, because that food kept us toasty warm while walking through a winter white-out that would have made old Dick Goddard take to the winds aloft, let me tell you ! (Cleveland joke, trust me:) One thing, the sides are not included with the sandwiches, but by the size, they'd have to charge twice as much. You get a lot for your dollar there, let me tell you. 

Parking is one issue; we heard there was a private lot, but we parked up the street. Still, it wasn't far. The bill was reasonable, and the service was good and the staff personable and nice. The place is...cozy, but they make best use of space and I liked the warm atmosphere. We saw a whole of local folks, even on a day as blustery as today, going in and out, all happy, full and with smiles on their faces. 

All in all, a nice experience. I've heard that on weekends they do quite the breakfast as well (they have a whole side to the restaurant reserved as a breakfast joint.) I can hardly wait to try that next time I'm out there.

So, if you're out and about, and you find yourself near, stop in...for some Burgers and Beer:)"}
{"text":"Not a fancy place, but the best ribs I have had. They are the old Mimi's recipe and each bone was cut separately, which made them very easy to eat."}
{"text":"Excellent burgers, decent beer selection, great onion rings.  Excellent bar food.  We usually sit at the bar, and the bartenders are attentive, and friendly.  This is a good, fun, divey type bar.  Not divey in the sense that you need to be careful walking out of the place, but just nice and casual.  

We frequent the Goose a lot during the week, and we typically only make it down this far on Saturday afternoons. Does that make sense?  Probably not, but I need to remember to drive down the couple blocks to enjoy burgers here when I'm not in a \"Goose pizza\" kind of mood.  :)  

Enjoy - get a burger.  :)"}
{"text":"Saturday night, around 12:00am-ish. A friend of mine is starving. The place is open but their kitchen is closed. 

Booooo on you, BnB. You should really change that. People need food when they're drinking and some of us would like more options in the DTW than just Frank n Tony's. Respectable adults don't go in there late night for food. We would come to BnB, though! 

Sigh."}
{"text":"Typical bar food ordered a bacon cheese burger and fries for 13.00 bucks I got a good burger and a hardy helping of fries the only thing that up set me was she put me on hold meaning putting the phone Down and told a story to her Bar patron and dropping serval f bombs  I was driving and on hands free with a 4 year old in the back seat shame shame on you"}
{"text":"Excellent food, burgers are quite large and sweet potato fries are a real treat! We went on St Pattys day and all of the other waiters but ours seemed to be able to handle the crowds, that is why the stars aren't more."}
{"text":"The burger was very good. The fries not so hot. Sent them back twice and they still came back toooo crispy. The loud vulgar man at the bar didn't help the ambiance. $6.50 for a strawberry daqueri in a rocks glass was over priced too."}
{"text":"4 stars because my visits have totaled 4 and I need more exposure to a place before I can do the coveted 5. :)

Ok atmosphere: Typical quiet small town / not fancy sports bar.

Staff: Exceptionally polite and refined for what you would expect by the initial ambiance. 

Food: I have only had wings (Garlic and Parm) and they are among the best I have had anywhere. Crispy, fresh, large, and tons of fresh chopped garlic and real parm sprinkled on top. This is no Garlic flavored sauce purchased in bulk.

I am told that the ribs are to die for and I am committed to tearing myself away from those amazing wings to give them a try.

The area is like a smaller Chagrin Falls without the falls. Burgers - N - Beer is in front of Willoughby Brewing company and you really must give it a try. 

Monday is wing night and they are .55 per wing; which is a really good price now days (So miss .10 wing nights LOL)."}
{"text":"Came here several years ago and remember thinking that it was awesome. Not sure what took me such a long time to come back. They're known for their stuffed burgers with garlic bread buns... really! It's what I've always ordered when I came here in the past and it's no different this time. Got the Italian burger... stuffed w/ capicola, salami, provolone & topped w/ marinara. It was good, juicy and tasty! I remember having the jalapeño burger last time and I enjoyed that, as well. 

You can't have a burger without fries, right?!? So we got a basket of their garlic fries to share. Ohhhh... the garlic fries!!! Hand cut, topped with shredded parm, bits of garlic. Oh, wow!

Our server was nice - pretty quick and efficient. Should really be a 4.5 star rating. 1/2 star off only because kitchen staff forgot to top one of the burgers with cheese and two other burgers did not have any lettuce, tomato and onion. It was still awesome, though!"}
{"text":"We stopped as a group into burgers and beer and sat on the patio. Our server was pretty quick and I got the burger boy which is one of their best sellers. The burgers there don't come across so you have to order them separately. From a place called burgers and beer is exactly what you would expect a greasy tasty burger with all intended references to pulp fiction. I have an iced tea which was pretty standard as far as iced teas go what am I to complaints are wobbly tables and empty condiments. We had to borrow catch up from a separate table and they were out of sweeteners for the iced tea.

For two people both eating and $8 burger in splitting a couple dollar order of fries you can get out of there under 20 bucks or so. One unfortunate side effect of sitting on the patio is it you don't get super duper fast service but that's okay that's why you sit on a patio is to enjoy your time out there. The place is technically called burgers beer and breakfast and one day I would love to try and see what they have on the breakfast menu. Since this review we have been back several times so it's a pretty solid burger place cuz that's pretty much all they do. They do have a kids menu with the standard kids fare and they're pretty much willing to adapt to what your kid wants if they have it to make it. But in the afternoon it is a lot of adults so keep your kids at home save it for happy hour"}
{"text":"This place is warm and friendly and the food is standard bar food. Ordered the chicken Buffalo flavor. They don't give you a side order with the sandwiches which are pricey $7.25-$8.75 for chicken. All their sandwiches are served on a half loaf of bread.   No plates, just baskets and napkins. Wish the food was better or at least better presented. The place is charming."}
{"text":"This place is dirty and the food is sub par."}
{"text":"This place has very good burgers. I tried the stuffed burger with pepper jack and jalapenos. It was very good and tasty. I did not need any ketchup or mustard or anything. The fried are good, but they don't come with the burgers so you have to add them on. This makes it fairly expensive in my opinion. It would be worth it if burgers came with fries for the relative same price. 

The beer I ordered was too expensive also :)  We'll go back again, but I'll get a coupon first."}
{"text":"This is, in my opinion, the best burger in the greater Cleveland area!  Fun, quirky staff, great prices and specials, and of course - THE BURGER!  I bring friends, both local and visiting from out of town, to experience the burger.  Worth the drive, all you west-siders!"}
{"text":"Well off to another burger joint we go ...... when you 1st trip your way into B/B  you realize, this place is a BAR !   OK, I knew going in, and pass the place 100 times a week but I don't drink beer so which way to the food !?!? 

It was a Friday night and we were seated pretty fast,  it was a nice night most people were outside knockin a few years off so there was plenty of seating.  There's still a slight hint of stale smoke in the air probably left behind by the decades when taking a bite of food and drag on a smoke was in vogue.  (so glad those days are gone)   Or could have been the open door to the rear where the grim reaper was mingling while people smoked.   

We had burgers (duh)  I suppose it would have been silly to order anything besides the places namesake.   I had \"a burger\"  no cheese, nothing special just lettuce and tomato, my gal a veggie burger and we shared a basket of fries.  I was pleased to hear the kitchen yelling out to the servers as soon as orders were up,  she ran over and brought our order right over. (nothing worse than staring at your food up on a line while servers mill about)  The burger was so HOT, the only way it could hotter is if I pulled up a chair and ate it straight off the grill !!  The fries were hot too and came out as ordered minus salt. (not sure if its special?)   My gal's veggie burger was hot too and not dry at all, she was happy.  We both left feeling full and will stop in again.  

This is old town corner bar eating with good food, it was was pretty tame when we were there but no one put any money in the juke and most of  the people were eating and only a few having a drink so it was quiet.   

 I would go here before I would go back to 5-guys or Burger-fi, 

Watch your step leaving :)"}
{"text":"The morning following a birthday celebration of a friend brought me back to Willoughby to fetch my rig. You see, being a responsible Yelper, one should never drink and drive, so I left the wheels in the driveway and had the old lady pick me up. I don't recall much of the drive home, but I was told it was filled with a bunch of meaningless drunken ramblings and stories from the memorable night out. 

The next morning I picked up my car in a hangover haze, messy hair and eyes not yet capable of being directly exposed to light. At that point, the only thing to provide relief would be breakfast from a greasy spoon diner. My friends, much more familiar with the area than myself, recommended a joint called Burgers N' Beer N' Breakfast. I was a little nervous as I was still at a very fragile state and incapable of fully functioning on the same level with the rest of normal society. I needed a mellow space. Somewhere I wouldn't be hassled. Somewhere I wouldn't stand out as the mess I felt like and probably looked like as well. 

Inside, the place is divided in two. On one side, they serve breakfast daily from 7am until 1pm. The other side is a bar/grill serving typical Americana classics from 11:30am-11pm Monday thru Thursday and until 12am Friday & Saturday. The bar is closed Sunday, although I think the breakfast side is still open. 

The place was bustling when we arrived around noon although we were quickly seated at one of the last remaining tables. On one side, the degenerates with hangovers scarfed fried eggs and hash browns  while the other side somehow choked down massive burgers at this un-Godly hour. The people eating lunch probably couldn't relate to what the rest of us were going through. There was just no way.

The food, served by a friendly and efficient staff was perfectly acceptable and extremely inexpensive. I got two scrambled eggs, hash browns, a side of toast and bacon all for $4 and some change. Not bad at all! 

I certainly felt better following the meal. All the essential vitamins and minerals included in the breakfast was just the elixir needed to refuel my drained and tired body from the previous night of drunken debauchery. If you're ever in the area and looking for a local alternative to the boring and predictable Denny's or Ihop, check out Burgers N' Beer N' Breakfast."}
{"text":"Terrible. Tried to have lunch there today and the AC doesn't work well. Was so bloody hot we had to give up and leave within three mins of sitting there. Of course we were charged $5 for the two sodas we didn't even drink. Not a great impression won't be back."}
{"text":"Racist as hell .....the manager told the valet company they didnt want any black people working there ...thats horrible and not how u run a business.....some people need to learn especially this place. I will never take my black son or boyfriend there."}
{"text":"It was good, finally got the chance to wat here. Peanut butter burger, need I say more."}
{"text":"Burgers are solid 3 stars.  You would expect better with Burger as the namesake.  The last time I visited with the wife and friend, we ordered 3 different burgers just to sample B & B's best.  Ordered all 3 medium but received all 3 well, sad and really disappointing.  They did recover with our appetizer with respects to this review.  I really loved their wings, large, juicy, lots of sauce, and sprinkled with Parmesan.  I WILL go back for wings but probably skip the burgers, more importantly, go hit the beers a little hard during their pretty reasonable happy hour.  Place is small, service is good, and I hear they have decent ribs and breakfast.

Burger of choice:  Blue Cheese Burger."}
{"text":"We usually only frequent this place for its breakfast. The specials throughout the week cannot be beat. But on weekends everything is full menu price which isn't bad either. The place is always full on weekend mornings. I looove Matt's mega blueberry pancakes, one fills an entire plate, for $1.75 per cake, you can't beat it. He usually gets the meat filled selections, whether it's the pork chops and hash or corned beef, he's happy. Service can be spotty so don't go if you are in a hurry but overall it's the best breakfast spot in dtw."}
{"text":"Love the food.  Their version of Manners' Big Boy is wonderful.  It's on garlic bread, and it's a HUGE burger, but they've got the sauce right.  And it rocks with sweet potato fries.  The restaurant/bar is tiny, crowded, and loud, and the owner is polite to the customers; however, I've heard him dress down his servers in front of everyone.  Parking is impossible, so go for the valet.  Wish it were open on Sundays!"}
{"text":"If you are a regular customer you get good service. If you are just an occasional customer wait staff pretty much ignores you. Left twice after 20 minutes of being ignored. Won't be back ever again."}
{"text":"If I want a tasteless burger, there are plenty of places to find one without paying the price they charge here or sitting with the crowd.  I don't know how they draw the number of people they do, because dry burgers with no beef flavor and cold, limp fires just don't cut it."}
{"text":"Have you ever gone to a restaurant and just not felt welcome? This would be the place!!
We walk in the back door and the hostess just stares at us only to say \"Im gonna seat you guys in the back\".....what!?

The food was Ok!!

I ordered the Corned Beef Hash and it was not what i expected. Chopped corned beef over hash browns is not the same. The italian sausage patties are strange to look at...LoL

Bad first impression does not work well when im spending my money......this might not be in my re-visit list on the near future!!"}
{"text":"Got take out last night. My Son is a plain burger kind of guy so, no fancy sauces can disguise a bad burger. Burgers are on really nice baguette that has a garlic spread on it, at least that's what it seems. Medium has a bit of pink, burger is nice size. He enjoyed it. We also ordered the Big Boy, which is just like it sounds- American cheese, special sauce & lettuce. On the bread, you tend to loose some of that Big Boy idea- but I tend to like a lot of sauce, so could just be me! One order of fries is enough for two people. The Garlic Parm were tasty, not too over powering of garlic- could maybe use a bit more Parm. But fresh cut fries were cooked well, held up to the short ride home. Staff was cheerful and patient, but walkways are tight- you will get bumped into!"}
{"text":"Has been packed every time we've gone, dinners and breakfast. With good reason. This is a place that perfectly lives up to its name.

The burgers are large, juicy, and have real flavor; you don't have to rely on the toppings (though every one we've tried has been good, too.)

Fries are above average; rings worth a try.

Breakfast wasn't as good as the burgers, but our omelets left us stuffed and happy.

This place is not about adventures in fine dining. Tables are jammed together; it gets noisy and there appear to be a lot of regulars so there's a lot of joking and moving around. The servings are large, and you're probably not going to be reheating this stuff the next day; you eat it or you leave it. 

If it were easier to find parking (they do have valet), and not so packed ... and not so guilt-inducing, we'd go more often. But such is the price of delivering so well on such a blunt promise: you want burgers, beer or breakfast? They got 'em."}
{"text":"This place is located in downtown Willoughby approximately across from the old post office.  As the name states they have burgers and beer and its divided into two separate restaurants one which serves breakfast.  The beer selection leans heavily in favor of domestics with a few mass produced imports on tap as well but the prices at $3.50 for import and $2.50 for domestic draft are pertty reasonable.   Especially during happy hour when domestics drop to $1.50.  Now there's a recession buster.  The place isn't fancy or anything typical hole in the wall bar although I'd say its clean so it doesn't look dingy or anything.  I've had the specialty burgers on both visits the first time the portabella stuffed burger and the most recent visit the Gorgonzola stuff burger.  I'd say the burgers are highly average.  Nothing special, if I was to go again I'd probably just get the bacon cheese burger with the fried egg since that would be hard to screw up.  The burgers are served on garlic toast like bread which is pretty tasty but way too much bread.  The burger just wasn't all that juicy or flavorful for my liking.  If I wanted a burger in this area I'd definitely rather go to Burger Nuts which you can see my review for.  They give you much more choices for toppings, its quicker and cheaper.  They do have Mimi's rib sauce though that those long time Clevelanders may remember.  I only sampled the ribs once though so I can't give a full review as to how good they are.  To summarize, its not a bad place to go but I'd be more likely to grab drinks here than to eat.  I have not tried the breakfast side though so don't judge that from my review.  Olivor Twist has much better selection for lunch and as I mentioned Burger Nuts' burgers are far superior, both a better choice in the Willoughby area."}
