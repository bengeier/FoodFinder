{"text":"Probably my favorite place to get a quick breakfast. It's self server. They have breakfast specials. It's quiet on the weekends unlike other BF place were you have to wait to get seated."}
{"text":"Really good cupcakes. The place is clean and the pasty is delicious. Did not try any of the sandwiches. Owner was fairly friendly until I told him I saw the place on Yelp. Then he became very short and did not want to talk anymore. Odd."}
{"text":"I just rediscovered these guys today, they used to be at bagel nosh in gilbert. Best chicken salad ever!  My wife had the tuna salad and was equally impressed. Great fresh food."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast and tried the Mediterranean Omelette (it was JUST ok). I wouldn't consider this food 'gourmet' as they advertise. The prices are fair for the amount of food you receive; I spent $22 on three people. There is not a huge variety of items, what you see is what you get.   I SO appreciated the plastic utensils; most restaurants use 'dishwashers' and you just NEVER know. What irks me is that most restaurants--this one included--give you one napkin. What can I possibly do with one napkin? I'm far from sloppy, but if you're not going to have a dispenser of sorts on the table please leave more than one on the table.  The service was mediocre at best. But the appearance itself is nice; nestled in Old Downtown Chandler across from the park (it was easily accessible and there was plenty of parking.   OAN...they have one bathroom, which creates a ridiculous line in the narrow hallway.  My overall experience wasn't horrible, I just can't say that I'd be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in downtown Chandler. Indoor and outdoor seating with a monster menu posted above the cashier...something to fulfill everyone's tastebuds. The bakery is fantastic! Try a warm cinnamon roll or Apple Danish. You won't be disappointed! The portion sizes for the price are a little off but you leave feeling full and satisfied."}
{"text":"This place has the most amazing food. Most bakery's have good food but this place has the most amazing taste and best variety I have ever seen. They make custom sandwiches and the taste will blow you away. I will put there pasteries and food to any place in town. It is the best kept secret in the greater Phoenix area. MY NUMBER ONE CHOICE FOR ANY MEAL!"}
{"text":"Tried this place on my lunch break one day and didn't know what to expect. Walked in, not much to see. I got the vegetarian sandwich, and it was so good! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I love the roast beef ortega with ciabatta bread. Cool small spot perfect for lunch. staff is very friendly, place is very clean too."}
{"text":"I've only been for breakfast, but it is very good... I believe it is family run too, which is always nice. Do yourself a favor and check it out."}
{"text":"I highly suggest not ordering a cake from here. My cake was very dry, the fondants was rock solid. The cake was held up by straws and the whole thing collapsed on the short, slow drive home. They gave us nasty looks when we arrived back to have the cake repaired."}
{"text":"Meh...the Hot Pocket was kinda bland...had to add BBQ sauce to give it flavor...unfortunately was kinda a bust.  Wife's Veggie pocket was kinda bland too."}
{"text":"I don't go out of my way to eat here, but if I'm in the area and I want a walk up, order, meal (no waiter) without really waiting, I stop by. They have pictures of all their dishes, which all are pretty standard, but I still appreciate the pictures as they help me decide.. .nothing fancy or too unique, but everything I've ordered is tasty.   The last time i had lunch here with my toddler, we got the Honey Mustard Club on Ciabatta and we both enjoyed every bite! It was very tasty and id definitely get it again another time. I also tried their house made pastry, of which they have a big display of. It was the walnut danish. ..that was actually really really delicious flaky, moist, chock full of walnuts and cinnamon. ..i think I'd actually now go out of my way to get one again.   The place isn't really enticing to foodies, it offers pretty standard sandwiches/breakfast, but tasty ... ive never seen it full or busy except once but i will continue to come here as long as the people are nice (which they've always been!)and the plates are good and desserts are displayed ;)"}
{"text":"We get all our custom cakes here, which are EXCELLENT! :) Grabbed lunch, Sante Fe chicken sandwich on in-house made focatia, sooo yummy!"}
{"text":"Best Chicken salad sandwich I ever had!.  There have been a lot of contenders too!  The sandwich was perfection. Choice of home made forcaccia or ciabatta bread.  It had a generous portion of chicken salad  with sprouts, lettuce, tomato, and oh so rare was that it was served toasted, warm and perfect  with a secret sauce in lieu of mayo.  Along side some delicious potato salad.  My fave sami ,,,,"}
{"text":"This is a new downtown chandler brunch eatery. Thought I'd give it a go and people watch for a bit. ;)  Hot sandwich: Sicilian. Chicken, melted provolone cheese , artichoke hearts, spinach, tomatoes, on a focaccia bread with marinara sauce. Overall it mimicked the flavors of an Italian meal. There were a few spinach leaves that were not wilted like the rest of it.   A la carte: Banana Walnut French Toast. 4 slices of French toast with banana circle chunks and caramelized candied walnuts on top and a side of maple syrup. A good ending for brunch.   I don't know what it was but after eating those carb-loaded entrees I got a good coma and took a first afternoon nap that was years overdue for 3 hours!! ;)  There was a wandering fly just waiting to eat the food too.   The bathroom - uh let's just say that I would never use it again. I needed a mask!"}
{"text":"I have been getting breakfast and lunch here for a few weeks now and will continue to go back.  Everything is made fresh and the bread is amazing.  I am not typically a pasta salad person but the pasta salad here has been changing my mind about that. I would like to see more sandwich menu options but otherwise I have zero complaints!"}
{"text":"Great find!  Friendly and extremely quick service.  Breakfast special sandwiches were awesome and made to order. Wife loved the presentation."}
{"text":"This place has to be some of the best food I have ever eaten. The owners & staff are always accommodating making sandwiches that aren't even on the menu. Give this place a chance and it will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Nice place in Old Town. Had the breakfast burrito but was put off by the cheap sticker on the menu asking 25 cents for extra salsa. Good food, friendly staff, nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is a gem of a place. I stopped in while at a conference at the hotel around the corner, and was pretty pleasantly surprised. They had some great and different sandwich options. They were very good. The menu isn't extensive, but it seems like they do what they do well. The bakery treats are pretty nice and look quite impressive.   The place is small but also has some outdoor seating which is pretty nice at lunch time in a Chandler \"winter.\""}
{"text":"Really good breakfast and coffee! I just wish they were open on Sundays because they would see me a lot more."}
{"text":"Attention Chandler! Hidden Gem for lunch, step right up! The sandwiches are fantastic. The bread is fresh and the ingredients are top quality. Even the cupcakes are delicious. I have always walked by and thought they just sold wedding cakes (as they are always in the window), but they do so much more."}
{"text":"Extremely friendly staff.  Checked this place out today for lunch and there is a a breakfast all day menu and lunch menu including coffee and teas.  Nice place to come to enjoy a quick meal.  Seating is indoor and some tables outdoor."}
{"text":"We had breakfast here this morning and really enjoyed the casual vibe and good food. The chef was super flexible in customizing my order and food arrived very quick.   Also we had the cinnamon buns, they warmed them up to serve and were amazing!"}
{"text":"Downtown Chandler is going to look really nice...right now, we have to put up with the major construction.  Nevertheless, we decided to go to the 3rd Fridays Art Walk.  More and more merchants are attending this event!  There were no coffee shops to be found around here (Starbucks at San Marcos close very early) until In Pockets decided to open for business for the once a month event.  Very nice people behind the counter and we were greeted right away.  They serve coffees and pastries and other things, but we were there just for that.  People were in and out of there that evening.  I got a capuccino with an oatmeal cookie.  My DH ordered latte with chocolate croissant.  My son had been eyeing the huge vanilla cupcake.  We loved it and we were doing the happy dance.  My friend and her daughter decided on the Oreo Milkshake and chocolate cupcake.  Apparently, they did not like the shake one bit.    It tasted like it came from a mix, which might have been.  Can't wait for the next 3rd Friday to come back here again.  We'll pass on the shakes for now..."}
{"text":"Great breakfast.  Good lunch.  Great place to grab a quick meal in downtown Chandler.  Patio seating is a great place to have breakfast."}
{"text":"InPockets used to do most of their business from cakes and catering, only opening on weekdays.  They've recently expanded their menu and hours.  I didn't even notice their signature \"pockets\" on the menu anymore.  Looks:  InPockets still seems more bakery than restaurant.  They have a few tables in front of a display case, filled with impressive pastries.  Wedding cakes decorate their front windows.  Food:  Breakfast and sandwiches, but they are AWESOME sandwiches.  We had the Santa Fe chicken and the chicken salad.  Each comes on a choice of FRESHLY BAKED ciabatta or focaccia.  Both breads were amazing.  The chicken salad was the best I've ever had, with cranberries and walnuts in it.  It tastes like food from a caterer.  I recommend the cole slaw over the pasta salad for your side.  We also had a piece of carrot cake, which was quite good.  Value:  The sandwiches were $8.  (Maybe a tad pricey w/o a hot side or a drink.)  The small piece of carrot cake was good value at $1.50.  The waffles and/or French toast at breakfast looked like a good deal at $4.  Service:  Just a counter, but I think the owner was working.  She was very nice.  Verdict:  I'll definitely go back.  The freshly baked bread alone is worth the trip."}
{"text":"Really yummy very cute place! My gf and I went in for a nice little breakfast then walked around after - beautiful morning ! :)"}
{"text":"Fastest and Most Affordable lunch in downtown Chandler  Every day I search for lunch in downtown Chandler. I'm a creature of habit as most of us are and therefore I tend to stick to the same place when I find something good - I try not to but sometimes it happens.  I've walked passed In Pockets... hundreds of times? scary but probably. I haven't given it much thought as it's been tagged as a bakery and I'm not into sweets and stuff. However, they've been putting out signs on the sidewalk about breakfast (another thing I don't do) and sandwiches for lunch as well. Long story short I decided to venture back in (tried it once in October) and thought it was ok.  This place is very undervalued for as good as it is and not as well known as it should be. That needs to change. This is by far the fastest lunch in downtown Chandler and one of two most affordable. (not counting fast food crap).   For about $8 there are a variety of great deli sandwiches and chicken breast on focaccia or other great breads. Lots of different gourmet sandwich variations and all fill me up for that amount. Their bread is excellent, soft and warm and even the ciabatta was perfect and not hard like it typically is at most places.  The pasta salad was superior. The locale is nice, good inside seating and very friendly and attentive owner and workers taking your order and bringing the food out to your table.  I'm not a coffee guy but I know a few people at Gangplank that walk down here and get their cup of joe and mocha stuff here - if they like it from here it must be good. They also make cakes and pastries and all that stuff - again, not a sweets guy but it all looks good in the window.  I'm most definitely making In Pockets a more common visit for lunch each week. And they have a punch card too for loyalty rewards."}
{"text":"It is right across the street from where I work. Everyone is always so friendly and nice. The food has always been perfect and have amazing chocolate chip cookies. It's nice having a little local place such as this."}
{"text":"We were not looking for fast food for breakfast but we were not looking for a full on sit down restaurant either. InPockets seemed to fit the bill perfectly for what we were looking for.  Kinda similar to a Panera Bread, you place your order at InPockets at counter, take a number and find a seat, then you are served your order. Seating inside is pretty limited so we were relegated to eating outside. Fortunately it was early enough in the morning that we didn't have to bake in the hot AZ sun.  Our breakfast came out and I was pleasantly surprised that the food actually looked like the food in the pictures on their menu! The breakfast sandwich I had was fresh and tasted great. My lady's breakfast was also cooked to order and was equally as tasty. The employees at the counter as well as the server were very pleasant and accommodating especially considering how busy they were for Saturday morning.  So if you're looking for an affordable breakfast/lunch option in Chandler that isn't fast food then I suggest stopping by InPockets. Fast and affordable, InPockets was a good meal to end our trip to AZ on :)"}
{"text":"Imagine a Hot Pocket hot from the microwave. Now imagine it tasting about 1,000,000 times better. That's InPockets in Chandler.  InPockets stuffs flaky homemade bread with a variety of tasty fillings. There is the traditional German family recipe of corned beef and cabbage, Italian sausage and marinara sauce, pulled BBQ pork, and my favorite (so far), of roasted turkey breast, provolone and bacon. They also have a breakfast pockets menu.   If you're not into glorified Hot Pockets, try one of their fresh-baked pastries with a drink off of their wonderful gourmet beverage menu, including Caramel French Vanilla Coffee or Hot Chocolate Latte."}
{"text":"Ok breakfast nothing that great, nice service"}
{"text":"This place is great.  Found it randomly after arriving at PHX airport.  Food was excellent, and the lunch special was an incredible deal.    I would go back again and again but the mileage between Torrance and Chandler would add up quickly.    If you can find a parking spot around there, definitely stop by for a sandwich!"}
{"text":"My husband and were visiting for a few days while he was on a business trip and I are breakfast here twice! The food is great, service is quick, and what you see in the photo on the menu is definitely what you get! Everything is made to order and they have a wide variety to choose from. I had the American breakfast one day and a Belgium waffle the next. The batter for the waffle was made from scratch, not a box which was awesome. If I you visit Chandler, I highly recommend stopping in stone time!"}
{"text":"Great food. Great atmosphere. Everything is great. Loved the chilaquiles and lox benedict. They have great baked goods as well."}
{"text":"Updating my 18 month old post. So yes they have the best cupcakes in Chandler for sure. Probably be best in the whole Phoenix metro area. They are that good.  My kids love their cupcakes for their birthdays.  But now you need to add their chicken salad sandwich. Knowing how good that is, it takes it from a 4 star to a 5 star. I am fan!"}
{"text":"very friendly staff and excellent cookies.  I didn't see any sandwiches or pockets so I wonder where that name comes from.  We sat outside and enjoyed the atmosphere.  Nice place to meet up with someone."}
{"text":"I'm from out of town. I came here for breakfast...it was simply exquisite so I came back for breakfast before I went back home. Food tasted fresh, prices are reasonable and clean environment. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast and had the cinnamon french toast. It was delicious. The staff was very friendly and professional. The location is great...sitting outside looking over beautiful Downtown Chandler people watching was perfect!"}
{"text":"1st visit to this shop but it won't be my last. I had the Sicilian open faced sandwich. It was delicious!  Prices are good too."}
{"text":"We stumbled into this place yesterday and wow are we lucky! The food is great, prices fantastic and excellent staff. Small but great ambience. I can not wait to go back!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for an awesome breakfast place in the east valley, look no further. The eggs Benedict, breakfast burritos, and platters are to die for. The service is second-to-none, and the atmosphere is clean and cozy. There can be quite a line for lunch, but the service is quick, so don't.be intimidated. The entrance is easy to miss, and the menu is on the small side, but you simply can't go wrong with anything on it. It's pretty quiet in the morning, so it's a great spot to enjoy breakfast and read a bit of news before heading into the office."}
{"text":"What a great little bakery! $11 for a soda with a sandwich and pasta salad and a coconut chocolate cookie! It was delicious, and comfortable, and filling, and... delicious!!!! Definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"I ordered decorated jumbo cupcakes for a small birthday dinner party.  One of the four cupcakes was to have Happy Birthday Grandma written on it.  The cupcake had a plain white plastic circle with the happy birthday grandma written in black marker.  Wow, I'm beyond disappointed.  Tacky, sigh... too late to get something else personalized.  after dinner party ..... the white circle was fondant not plastic...still did not like how it looked The cupcakes were delicious though."}
{"text":"Decent cupcakes. Don't compare well to places like the coffee shop in Gilbert but tasty. Not the friendliest owners. Not much for conversation!"}
{"text":"I stopped by yesterday for lunch, and I had the ham and honey mustard sandwich.  It was ok.  I only ate half.  I was going to have the other half later, but it really didn't settle in my stomach well.  The cibbata bread was soggy.  The atmosphere of the restaurant didn't impress me.  It was dark with very high ceilings that made the noise louder.  It just didn't feel inviting.  No effort on decor at all.    I guess if I was desperate for a sandwich while in that area I might go back, but it wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"Spot on food. Had a simple breakfast burrito. And it was delicious. Quick service, prices are a good value considering the location. Lots of great choices, I heard the eggs Benedict is perfect. I will frequent here often, it's a great spot. Highly recommend"}
