{"text":"Unique location. Good wings. Friendly service. I think I'll be back sooner than later. Lemon Pepper was my favorite flavor."}
{"text":"Come see Deron. He will tell you to your face he has the best wings and he doesn't lie. Real homemade wings"}
{"text":"These were bomb wings.  The sauces were delicious and the lemon pepper one was the best one. 10/10 would come eat here again."}
{"text":"BEST WINGS EVER !!!! Lemon pepper, hot and fire is my all time favorite. Hands down, love the wings !!!! Definitely a must go !!!"}
{"text":"Tried this little food truck a few days ago and was very impressed. The wings had great flavor and were cooked to perfection. We tried the cheese and ranch fries and they were amazing! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Ordered thru uber eats on 02/22/2018 Wings were BOMB ! Was not disappointed I will be coming back soon. Fries were also yummy !"}
{"text":"Just ordered about 15 mins ago. THIS SHIT IS SMACKIN. Got damn . I'm only out here visiting from San Diego but hands down im getting another order before I leave !"}
{"text":"Smackin' Wings are some of the best smelling and tasting wings I have ever had! I work in the same complex they are based out of, and the delicious smell gets me hooked every time. Deron (the owner) is a very likeable, succinct, and hard working. He will do his best to get your order out to you ASAP because he hates keeping any of his customers waiting. Deron cares about each of his customers, and strives to make each order of wings just as good as the last one he whipped up. I recommend calling ahead of time with an ETA. This food truck, although seemingly obscure, has a ton of customers some nights! If you're looking for some unique, well seasoned wings, I definitely recommend Smackin' Wings. Although it's a small operation, you will definitely enjoy the wings from this humble but high-quality food truck!"}
{"text":"Wings could have been fired a lil harder but overall these are Pretty good wings! & it's black owned which is just an added bonus! I'll definitely be back in the future..."}
{"text":"Just grabbed a 12 piece with fries and water.   Came out to about $17.   Good price for the quality of food.   I really enjoyed the fries and the wings were well made.   The service was great and wait time was not too bad.   Good wings, great fries, solid price."}
{"text":"This is literally down the street from my house about one block and I'm super happy about it. I'm a super big wing fan and search them out when I travel. I ordered the fried wings with mild sauce They put the sauce on the side I'm assuming to keep it crunchy. It was delicious and filling. It was your run- of- the- mill batter Flavor but it was crunchy and satisfying. Next time I want totry the garlic parmesan to get more flavor."}
{"text":"I had very high expectations based on the photos and reviews. I finally was able to make a trip to Smackin' Wings last night. When I say I was thoroughly impressed, I mean it!  This is some of the best fried chicken I've had in the Phoenix area. The breading is perfect and taste is unforgettable. I got Lemon Pepper on the side, perfection!  Stop by.  You won't be disappointed and your stomach with thank you!"}
{"text":"I've tried a lot of wing places in Arizona, but this was by far the best.  It was really good.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wings were real good. Guy actually cooked them 5 mins before close (3:30am) and had to wait an extra 20 mins after they were done to get paid because my card was having problems. Yet he waited and was cool about it. Would recommend to everyone. Will be going back for a late night meal again."}
{"text":"Great wings. Been to a lot of BBQ all over the country and these wings compete with the best. Must try the hot sauce!"}
{"text":"Discovered this was right around the corner from my house and decided to give it a shot. Ordered the fried wings and fries and was not disappointed. Probably the meatiest chicken wings I've ever had, and they were fried perfectly. I got the hot wing sauce on the side and the flavor was top notch. The crinkle fries were also perfect. Crispy on the outside, and soft in the inside. 10/10, would eat again."}
{"text":"Read the great reviews... tonight my wife and i decided to give it a shot. Dude said, \"these are the best wings in town\"- yep...mhm... he was right. I'd definitely put these wings up against any wings out here in the valley. Slamming"}
{"text":"Took awhile to find the truck, but after two calls and determination we finally found smackin' wings. They are located on 11th st and Indian school in phoenix south on 11th in a small neighborhood.   We order the smackin' hot wings and parmesan garlic wings with fries. Took about 10 minutes and while we were waiting for them to cook the smell was absolutely delicious. It was to-go so we brought it home and enjoyed the local wings.   We kinda messed up and got normal wings but next time we're gonna get the fried chicken wings since the sauce is on the side to preserve the crunchiness of the chicken since it's in a Togo container.   Definitely a must try!!! #foodgang"}
{"text":"This place is never open! The hours on Yelp are misleading! Their website says they close at 1:00am. Went there twice now and both times there was no one there! Please have consistent hours! Tired of driving there and then never being open!"}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to try and was not disappointed. The lemon pepper had a great taste and was actually better then Wingstop. I was surprised because it was not a dry rub but was a sauce. Next time I'll try the fried wings with lemon pepper to see if the coating allows the sauce to absorb more flavor. The fries were also good and had a nice seasoning sprinkled on them."}
{"text":"Ordered for dinner tonight expecting plain wings but nope! They were delicious. They were crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. They also are not selfish with the sauce! I love alot of sauce and they put just the right amount!"}
{"text":"These are the best Wings in and out of Town!!! No exaggeration. Thanks to my pregnant wife's cravings we found smackin wings and it is our new Favorite wing place. I had lemon pepper wings and my wife had hot   But you need to get your fries with the sauce and cheese well worth the price and our 40 minute drive, YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED, Show some love to Smackin Wings!"}
{"text":"Best lemon pepper sauce I've ever had, I highly recommend these wings and will be going back for more!"}
{"text":"Damn cooked perfectly   I got the breaded fried chicken wings w/ fries... Bomb!!!!  Simple and delicious , the chicken was cooked perfectly almost juicy but not too greasy. Crispy breading that had a slight crunch.   I will be back especially since this truck is literally parked in my neighborhood. Looking forward to trying some flavors next time."}
{"text":"Found this place in search of wings.  When arriving we were really excited because the smells were amazing and I was intrigued that the lemon pepper flavor was a sauce and not a dry rub.  Well, once we were able to indulge we were not impressed.  Almost had the taste of Tyson frozen chicken, nothing special. Needless to say not worth the trip and won't be back."}
{"text":"Hands down best chicken in town! Smackin is an under statement! Get you some ASAP! Also you can order through Post-mates! Make sure to try The Cheese Fries (Nacho Cheese) with Ranch! From now on I will be going here when I want wings!"}
{"text":"BOMB.com !!!! The wings are really flavorful.... mostly someone who is pregnant and has craving ... well I recommend the place!  Something so simple as Wings and fries but they are yummy!"}
{"text":"So i ordered this place using Postmates. Of course I'm upset bc i accidentally ordered bone in wings instead of bone less. Regardless i started eating these wings & all was going good until i got to the middle of the chicken & it was all purple from the blood. I was kind of grossed out but kept going. Next wing was worse & the third i couldn't even eat my wings anymore. What kind of chicken are they using???? Sauce was good & the fries could've been crisper"}
{"text":"Best wings in town! The wings doesn't have the unpleasant taste of the wings being in the fridge for a long time like a lot of other places. Juicy on the inside. The ranch fries is amazing. But it's hard to tell if they are open, no one ever picks up the phone. You really have to test your luck, but the food makes it all worth it."}
{"text":"Definitely found my new spot for wings here in Tempe. The sauce was delicious and the wings were absolutely succulent. Being southern, it's been hard to find a decent wing place and I am happy that now I found one."}
{"text":"I loved them before but now their chicken seems to feel like Tyson and frozen, big, fat, fatty and kinda gross. I could definitely tell the difference cause their older wings had a certain smell, when you would eat them. I like wings, thin, and crispy but i but into a huge fat piece. Idk what happened and now they never put ketchup the last 3 Times and they always give me the wrong drink too. Kinda disappointed and it's going downhill. I get cutting costs but the quality is definitely gone. I don't think I'll be ordering from them again if the chicken is like this."}
{"text":"Soooo I've been blessed to only eat here once... it was so amazing that I've wanted to eat here again & again... and again but I haven't had the privilege to do so because the h are inconsistent! I wanna eat, what I want to eat, when I want to eat it!  Update: yea... still loving these wings! And they were open! It's hot so give him some time to open. He's the best!"}
{"text":"Best wings I've ever had and service is always tip top. I would recommend this place to anyone looking to support a local growing business that I guarantee will expand here soon. You heard it first here, get your SMACKIN WINGS!"}
{"text":"Drunken nights seem to always end with me ordering wings from here through the Uber Eats app. The wings are cooked perfectly and are always fresh upon delivery. The seasoned fries are definitely my favorite!"}
