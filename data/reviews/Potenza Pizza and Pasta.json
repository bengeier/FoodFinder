{"text":"it's the Best Pizza) thank you for delivery foods, your delivery is very fast, I like your menu, Pizza with chicken, broccoli, with ranch and mild sauce it's Deluxe, I advise everyone to try this FOOD!) thank you so much Pizza Potenza!"}
{"text":"Great Pizza the guys here were very nice and I look forward to coming here again. After just moving to shadyside I will be coming here a lot more"}
{"text":"So glad I found this place. Yammy pizza and kabobs!  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"They automatically sent ranch, without a request, in the box with the pizza. Does it get any better than that in Pittsburgh?"}
{"text":"I placed an online order for wings and had to pay extra just to get ranch dressing. The order arrived with no ranch. Called the store and they said the \"might\" credit me on my next order. There will not be a next time. I can get mediocre food at a million other places."}
{"text":"The Hoagies are on point. A lot of the places near me close at 1000 so i gave Potenza a try just before midnidght, and outside of it taking a while to get to my door (45min to an hr), everything else was kosher. Pricepoint is cool. Food was hot. All was good"}
{"text":"I travel a lot and so far I can say they have the best kabob in town and they give large quantities. Best kabob place in pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I was staying at at Holiday Inn Express. The guy at the front desk recommended this place. I and 3 other friends ordered food here. The food took over an hour. It was cold on arrival and was mediocre at best. They forgot to give us forks and napkins, and when I called to see where the food was, they person who answered  was very rude. I will NEVER eat here again."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery of a pizza and a salad last night.  Pizza arrived without the correct toppings.  Salad did not have the correct dressing.    Do they deserve a 1-star rating for a botched delivery order?  Probably not.  We've ordered from Potenza a few times in the past and have been pleased.  However,  I'm sure that establishments like this have a high turnover rate with employees,  so the service and food quality may vary widely over a range of time.   I guess best you can hope for from reviews like this one is to gain an accurate snapshot of the business at a particular point in time.      So, currently,  it is a 1-star.   There is nothing worse than waiting 30-45 minutes for delivery and then the order is wrong.    Calling them back and yelling at them does nobody any good.  Calling and asking them to fix their mistake doesnt work because you are starving and dont want to wait another 30-45 minutes for the corrected order to arrive. So the only thing to do is turn to Yelp and hope you can effect some change that way.  I'll probably give Potenza another shot some time in the distant future when I can be reasonably sure that the people who screwed up my order last night no longer work there."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza in Pittsburgh.  Aiello's and Mineo's have found a common enemy.  Take a look at their specials; all of them are worth trying at least once.  For the most part, I order only the pizza, and I either pick up or eat at the restaurant.    Try getting a pizza with meatballs, sausage, and garlic (if you're into that kind of thing). Their specialty pies, such as Meat Lover's and Hawaiian, are all delicious.  They have a huge menu, but I'm probably not going to explore it any time soon (the pizza is too good to give up).  Maybe you need kabobs, pasta, gyro, or calzones (very good) in your life.  Potenza will satisfy these cravings.    I've been to both Aiello's and Mineo's, and unless you like to pay $20 for a pizza while drinking obscenely overpriced beverages, do yourself a favor and eat at Potenza Pizza."}
{"text":"(Writing this as I order here for the first time. Ordered at 1:02pm & it's now 1:15pm. I want a fresh review. Ordered a catfish 3 piece dinner that comes on bread with fries & coleslaw. Also ordered a slice of Raspberry cheesecake.)  Delivery came at 1:51pm.  Everything I ordered was there.   Visual inspection:  Comes with pita not bread! Definitely a plus for me. Could tell immediately the french fries were just your standard cheap frozen fries. Nothing special and not what I prefer.  Fish looked ok, nothing special, cheesecake looked fine. Didn't even see the tiny container of cole slaw til I started eating.  Taste:   Catfish was your typical frozen fishy taste. Breading had no flavor whatsoever. Threw it on the pita with some tarter & hot sauce and tasted a lot better. You get no lemon at all. Guess they prefer to save money and still charge $11.99. Fries as stated, just your average frozen. Not a fan of them. Ended up covering them with franks hot sauce & ranch & they were good that way lol. Cole slaw was probably the most disgusting cole slaw I've ever eaten in my entire life, & I love some good slaw. Being thrown in with the fish & fries it was just warm mush. Cheesecake wasn't bad. Probably would of been better if I threw it back in the fridge since it came hot sitting on my food container.  All in all, it felt like an average diy dinner purchased from Aldis. Edible but nothing was beyond ok. (no offense to Aldis) The menu here is just ridiculous. Probably the longest pizza place menu I've ever seen in my life. Being a fan of kitchen nightmares it makes me think to that. The more you offer the more you skimp on quality ingredients. Think restaurants like Red Lobster & Olive Garden have smaller menus.  Will definitely order again & try something different. 2 star review off one order isn't really fair but I'll edit it later based off future purchases.  12/13 edit: Was going to order an x-large specialty pizza & was looking for extra ranch. Really, on your 900 item menu I can't order a few extra? Get with it. Yeah, it's stupid & I could call but that's the point of online ordering. I don't have to. Something so simple & I'll order my $20 pizza somewhere else tonight."}
{"text":"I ordered the mixed grill platter that included beef, kofta, curried chicken, basmati rice, and tzatziki sauce and a tiny dish of peppered salad. The food was so delicious that I was able to finish the entire dish without having to pack any of it, which was pretty remarkable since it was easily more that what I can normally devour in a single meal.  The only reason this place didn't get 5 stars was that the wait was a little long, but given how good the food was, it's a picky point. Should I come down that way again and be hungry I'll definitely return."}
{"text":"There is a big sign on the side of their building that advertises a large plain pizza for $6.99.   My large plain pizza tonight was $9.08 with tax.   Last time I checked, Micky D's didn't charge 20% more than what was on the drive thru menu.  Bunch of frauds."}
{"text":"I really like Potenza. The portions are generous, orders come hot and on time not earlier and in the 2 years I've been ordering from them: they have never made a mistake. Trust me, that's not easy to accomplish with someone who orders like me. I am happy to tip above and beyond, but I want my order exactly as I order it.    The beef ravioli is very good! The sauce isn't anything to write home about, but you can always count on those little pasta's being plump and full of yummy ness! Baklava is AWESOME so sweet and flaky, and always:  generous servings.   I think my favorite thing though... is their crab cake balls. Totally indulgent junk food. You green smokers out there? Get on those crab balls! Munchie heaven.  Last thing: They have a lot of coupons: so before you pay full price go see whats being offered."}
{"text":"Every time we just can't do hospital food one more time, we order from Potenzas.  Great variety and we've never had a bad meal.  We've been loyal customers for 3 years and will continue to be!!  I love the eggplant Parmesan sub and any kind of pasta.  Also, if you have a sweet tooth, get the baklava, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"While all of Potenza's food is on par with almost anything else of the same price in the city, I'm personally a fan of their regular and gourmet hoagies. The ingredients are always fresh and the service is fast."}
{"text":"I almost never leave reviews. I just received an incorrect order. Whatever ... Too hungry to care. As soon as I bite into it... It is inedible. Doughy. Seriously? I call back and ask that they send the driver back because at this point it is late, I'm exhausted, my appetite is gone and I just want my damn money back. He reluctantly says ok and agrees to send driver back. One hour later - no driver, no phone calls ... Just a gross uncooked pizza. I called but of course they are not answering. This is a wonderful introduction to Pittsburgh. I've been on a plane all day, I'm starving and this is the experience. One star for getting my soda order right. This is not how you run a business.  Update: I called this morning to ask about my refund. They said that I could come in and get my refund. No. I'm from out of town w/o a rental. So the money I would spend on a Lyft would completely defeat the purpose. I asked that they send a driver to return my money. They did about an hour later. I gave them the entire uncooked pizza back. But of course I didn't get my tip back. Whatever."}
{"text":"Had an awful experience here. The workers are rude. The man who took my order got my name wrong, when the delivery man brought my food, he called to my department at work and asked for someone who nobody knew (wrong name) so the guy left. I called looking for my order and the man was very rude to me and said the driver left my food with the security guard. He lied! The security guard at my job said he left. So I called back asking for a refund, the man was very rude and said the driver was on his way. The driver called me and asked me to come outside, I did, he SPED up to me, I seriously thought he was gonna hit me! Handed me my food and sped away. Not only did this entire situation take up my entire lunch break, but my cheesesteak was complete MUSH! It was so soggy from sitting in the car so long. I was HIGHLY disappointed. I understand things happen such as a misheard name....however, do NOT lie and say the food was left and do NOT drive like a maniac and try to look tough. My coworkers and I will not be ordering from here again when there are much better places around anyway."}
{"text":"To say anything else but delicious about the food here would be a lie.  I ordered a smoked turkey wrap and could not have been happier.  Instead of using a tortilla like most places do, they used a pita...a nice fresh pita, yum!  The turkey was moist, bacon was salty, tomatoes were nice sized slices and lettuce was crisp.  What pulled it all together was the honey mustard dressing (packaged, but still good).    Only downside I had with it was that it was to come with a side of cole slaw and a pickle spear.  Pickle spear was lacking and tiny.  Cole slaw was nonexistent.  Maybe next time they will get it right."}
{"text":"The last time I ordered I got a disappointment with cold fries no dipping cheese and a badly made cheese steak hoagie. But that was the first time I've ever had a bad xp. So I'm giving them another try now."}
{"text":"A hidden gem!!!  Had no idea this place existed until I placed an order online with GrubHub.  What a great find!  They were quick, the pizza was cooked to perfection (I'm a basic cheese pizza gal so this was by no means a crazy specialty pizza), and my hubby's chicken parm hoagie was both ginormous and scrumptious (he said it has been a while since he had had one that good).  Great combo specials on the pizza/hoagie too!  I highly recommend giving this place a shot!"}
{"text":"They have a GREAT menu (pizza, gyros, wraps, mexican foods, shish-kabob, ect) It's crazy! &good!!! I looked at the menu for 20min because I couldnt decide! It just kept getting better every section of the menu! :)"}
{"text":"Seems like people either love or hate this place. I'm the former.   Gross. Just flat out gross. I left without finishing my meal  I never do that    Stay hell away from their non-pizzalike food. I got a 'kabob.' The meat was dried out, tasted old. The rice tasted like they bought it, like, 10 years ago. It was actually stale! How do you have stale rice?!?  And the place had, like, 6 people in it. Do they all work there? If so, how are they even in business? No one was doing anything.   Maybe their pizza is better, I dunno. Again, it's either one star or four with this place. Regardless, I'm not going back and I'll do my best to keep friends away."}
{"text":"This place claims to serve kabobs and naan well that is def not the case.  Well let me back up, they do serve it but it is TERRIBLE and EXPENSIVE!  I just ordered a mix grill kabob with a side of naan (or 6\" pizza cut in this case!).  The naan was a 6\" piece of Pizza dough with some seasoning, didn't taste like anything at all, more dried out and hard from being sent thru the oven.  The chicken was probably the best out of the mix grill.  I'd have to say the 3 pieces of 4 beef were the worst.  Dry, nuked, over cooked etc.  I am going to end this review early.  I paid 13.36 for junk, learn from my mistake, save your money."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever! Ordered on GrubHub and started out not a huge deal, I ordered extra ranch and marinara to go with breadsticks and boneless wings. When the order arrived the driver refused to even enter the hotel lobby. When i arrived back to my room, not only was the food cold, ALL of the sauces were missing. Unfortunately the hotel did not have marinara or ranch that I could purchase. I called the restaurant and asked if they could send the sauces. The man who answered the phone stated he would send them as soon as a driver arrived back. 20 minutes went by and it was my first meal of the day, so I just ate the food. I called the restaurant back to ask them to cancel the missing items as they were no longer needed. A different man answered the phone and rudely told me to wait. He handed the phone to yet another gentleman who the proceeded to call me a liar and began to scream at me stating they were never actually going to deliver the missing sauces as I had been lying about them not being in the box the entire time. I would never order here again. The boneless wings were way over cooked and spongy and the breadsticks were bland and tough. They also definitely need to work on customer support."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place is only rated 3 stars... y'all must be expecting some Mercurio's or something. This place has delicious pizza (all kinds have been tried), and the JUMBO WINGS are the best in town. Do yourself a favor and get yo self summa those."}
{"text":"We ordered a sicilian pizza because we like our pizza thick, however, our pizza was no thicker than a standard round pizza -- very disappointing.  There was hardly any crust also.  I will say the roasted red peppers as a topping were good.  The other thing we didn't like was that it was pretty salty."}
{"text":"Potenza is the new favorite pizza place to order from for my wife and I. We've tried numerous places over the last year, and Potenza seems to be the most consistent for quality.  My favorite hoagie is chicken parm, as I order one almost every time we call in an order to any pizza shop. I guess you could say that's what I use to compare. I have to say that even if the pizza was awful, I'd at least be calling Potenza to order their chicken parm hoagie! It's that good. Large pieces of breaded chicken, good sauce, and a nice balance of cheese that isn't too overwhelming. Not to mention the large is big enough to feed a few people...or one of me.  Fortunately, the pizza is really good, as well. We've only had cheese, and recently tried the white pizza. Is it the best plain cheese pizza in Pittsburgh? Nope (our nod goes to Fiori's), but you're not going to have any complaints. It's very good for your run-of-the-mill pizza place in town, a la Milano's or Parma, and the white pizza was excellent!  The other great thing has been the delivery. We seem to get a call from every delivery person - regardless of who we order from - asking about where our place is. Potenza's drivers seem to be the nicest ones we've had to deal with.  In short, if you're looking for a pizza joint with consistent quality and service, Potenza is a safe bet...and seriously...best chicken parm hoagie that I've found more recently in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Took an hour for delivery... OK  Paid extra for bread and meatballs... Didn't get them... Fine  Opened dinner... ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE!  Gross, gross, gross!   Do not get food from here! What a waste! I just threw away $40 dollars."}
{"text":"Good food.  Quick delivery. Wonderd why it was a little on the high side as far as price. 2 canoli s turned into 6 @ 3.99 a piece. The callings were the gourmet large, I didn't know there was a choice,  and wasn't asked which size I wanted.  Large salads,  huge garden salad.  Live and learn...."}
{"text":"I got a chicken spinach pizza and whenbi got it i ate a few pieces and it was fine. I kept some for lunch the next day and the first piece I went to eat had like a white fuzz sting. So on to the next one and black hair all over it. Their wings were hard to chew guess they were over cooked."}
{"text":"Had the gyro and the meat was just awful. Super dry, tough, and lacked flavor. The sauce was mediocre. Wouldn't get it again."}
{"text":"The best in the area and some of the most attentive customer service you will ever receive. Definitely worth every penny and the food's tasty."}
{"text":"The bad reviews on here are unwarranted. If you're looking for a good slice of pie, look no further.   Potenza Pizza consistently impresses me with their food and service.  The pizza is among the best in the East End area, and their prices are a steal.  As a Pittsburgh native and a college student in the region, I have tried my share of pizza joints and have ultimately settled on Potenza as my go to pizza order.    A personal anecdote about the service:  I live close enough to Potenza that I can bike to pick up my order.  Once when strapping my order to the back of my bike, and employee came out and offered to drive my order to my apartment free of charge.  After I declined, they helped me secure my order and wished me well.  I wouldn't go to a pizza joint on centre avenue expecting the fine dining and service of a French Restaurant, but never have I had a negative experience with the employees there."}
{"text":"They have a family feast / hungry man special that includes a large pizza (no topping), whole hoagie, breadsticks and a 2 liter of soda.  The total cost is $24.60 with tax and whatever you want to give the driver for a tip if you are having it delivered.  At the bottom of the receipt it says, \"Collect 10 Different Receipts To Receive Free Med Cheese Pizza\".  If you were to order the above items individually you would end up paying an additional $6.17 so if you have a coupe of people that are hungry and you can agree on what type of hoagie to split, this is a decent solution.    As far as the food, it's average.  The breadsticks are good but there's never enough butter / garlic / cheese on them.  The pizza is good but you can taste that the sauce is canned - I only know of two pizza shops in the city that actually makes their own sauce (and that doesn't mean opening the can and pouring it into a bowl).  I wish they would offer a salad instead of the hoagie because there are times when I am burned out on the same two or three hoagies that are actually cooked right and don't arrive a soggy mess."}
