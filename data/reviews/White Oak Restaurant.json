{"text":"White Oak is the sort of place where the owners remember your favorite dishes even if you have not come around for a month. It is not hard to put up with less than awesome ambience for the 'crispy chicken' or 'dry ribs' as it is sometimes known. The faux meat concoction pleases staunch meat eaters and the usual suspects alike."}
{"text":"Located in the corner of a mall, White Oak II is  devoid of pretense. I've been served my water in Mc Donalds paper cups, haven't heard more than a word of english, and am baffled by the odd hours. The delightful food and genuine owners make this humble restaurant one of my favorite. My favorite dish is the \"Salt and Pepper Ribs\", completely vegan of course and my favorite experience is when half way through my meal, the owner read my mind and pointed the fan straight at me (perhaps I was breaking out in a sweat). If you don't like the atmosphere, get take out, because this is the best chinese food you'll ever have."}
{"text":"White Oak underwent a transformation a couple of years ago and boy oh boy am I glad it did! At the previous White Oak I was once served vegan fish that was still frozen in the middle... eep! But with a revamped menu and friendly staff this place is now one of my favourites in Calgary.  The menu has Asian and Western style dishes all prepared vegan. Curry, a Vietnamese-style vermicelli bowl, pizza, and faux meat Chinese-style dishes are only some of the offerings available. Prices are quite low - you can eat for well under $10 - and everything I've tried there has been pretty tasty.  This place is a little jewel hidden in the navel of Chinatown. I hope they do well, because they deserve to!"}
{"text":"I miss the White Oak that I used to know; the language barrier between myself and the friendly couple who owned it, managing still to remember myself and various friends or family that I would bring along...the tasty vegan dry ribs, dumplings, and shanghai noodles with veggies. This place used to be a weekly venture for me. My padre and I went on the last day before they changed over and I was bummed. Luckily, the lovely people of White Oak still own a little tiny space in that same mall area where they sell their vegetarian products so you can make them at home.  This used to be my favourite place ever. I am giving White Oak four stars for what it WAS. I am NOT a fan of the new endeavour, Veggie Fusion Express. Mostly because I HATE Asian fusion, and also how every vegan Chinese restaurant that Calgary has (there were three) have made some sort of sad shift. I hate it, I hate it, I hate it. I miss you White Oak."}
